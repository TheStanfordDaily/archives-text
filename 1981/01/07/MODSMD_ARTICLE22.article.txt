# Students find balanced diet possible on Food Service
## 
### Lisa Berry 
It was only nine weeks ago when
Marie, a freshman from New York
City, came to Stanford weighing 120
pounds Today the indicator on her
scale reads 132. Marie is unhappy over
the fact that she has gained weight. In
addition to being unhappy. Marie is
also frustrated because she can't seem
to drop those extra pounds while conti
nuing to eat her meals prepared by Uni
versity Food Service.
Sound familiar? It seems as though
many students here (especially
freshmen) have a tendency to gain
weight when taking their meals at the
University's dining halls.
Dr. John Dorman, a physician at
Cowell Student Health Center, believes
there are many reasons that help ex-

i i person may not necessarily be hungry when he
or she goes back for seconds. They will go back
because the food is available . . . all that the
student has to do is eat. 9

plain why students are susceptible to
acquiring additional weight, especially
during their freshman year. It is during
this time, believes Dorman, that social
and academic pressures affect stu
dents.
For the first time in their lives, most
students are living away from home.
They experience the freedom of being
on their own. but along with that free
dom a certain amount of stress is also
present. A new academic as well as so
cial environment leads to the creation
of a "stressful situation" where it's
easy for a person to neglect his or her
diet. The tendency to overeat becomes
common as an undergraduate attempts
to handle the anxiety that Stanford
presents through food.
For others, however, the freedom of
being independent is initially not so
welcome. Homesickness is enough to
cause them to overeat. Ann, a junior
from Los Angeles, recalls, "I was so
homesick during my first quarter here
that I ate constantly in the hope that
my problem would go away ... but it
didn't. In addition to being homesick I
had another problem: nine additional
pounds."
Availability causes consumption
Lois Ohms, the University's Test
Kitchen Dietician, believes that stu
dents eat more while at school simply
because the food is there. "A person
may not necessarily be hungry when he
or she goes back for seconds. They will
go back because the food is available
and no cleaning up will be required as
far as dishes are concerned. All that
the student has to do is eat." In this
sense, believes Ohms, Food Service
provides "a luxury for students here."

The idea of luxury also ties in with
the notion that mealtimes are the most
convenient occasions when a student
can get together with his or her friends.
"The dinner hour is a time for social
izing," says John, a junior from San
Jose. He adds, "It's nice to be able to
sit in the dining hall for an hour or so
and relax with my friends whom I
haven't seen all day because we've all
been so busy with classes, work and
outside activities." A leisurely spent
dinner hour is unquestionably wel
come, but John is quick to point out that
"it's easy to overeat when socializing.
You'll get up and grab a second dessert
just because it's there â€” not because
you're hungry."
Regardless of the many reasons why
so manv students overeat and conse-

quently gain weight, the fact is that
they do. Currently there aren't any
statistics on how many people actually
do gain weight here, but it is generally
agreed that this phenomenon is a prob
lem and should be dealt with rather
than being ignored.
Food Service blamed
Unfortunately, it seems as though
many students are satisfied with the
answer that Bob, a sophomore from
San Diego, gives for explaining why he
hasn't lost the 14 extra pounds that he
gained during his freshman yeaf. "It's
impossible to lose weight while eating
at Food Service. All of the foods are
starchy 1 and the desserts are loaded
with calories. There's no way a person
can take off a pound while eating that
type of food," he said.
Is Bob correct in stating that it's
"impossible" to lose weight while eat
ing at Food Service? Kay Malik,
Wilbur Food Service manager, says
she disagrees with Bob and other stu
dents who follow a similar line of rea
soning. Malik said she believes that it
is possible for a student here to eat a
well-balanced diet (whether it be a re
ducing or a maintaining one) and re
main healthy.
The most important point here is
that one must be very careful about
which foods and how much of them he
or she eats, she said. Malik feels that
Food Service allows a sufficient selec
tion of foods whereby a person need not
starve himself or herself and become
sick if he or she decides to go on a seri
ous reducing diet.
It is vital, said Malik, for a student to

become conscientious about his or her
eating habits if he or she wants to lose
weight through a healthy diet. "As long
as a student makes his or her food
selections wisely, it's entirely possible
for him or her to drop extra weight,"
she said.
Reducing possible
Adam, a junior from Chicago, is
proof that Malik's claims are valid.
Last year he lost approximately 35
pounds while continuing to eat at the
University's dining halls. Most of his
additional weight was put on during his
freshman year. He attributes this to his
love of homemade desserts and breads.
"I just couldn't stop (or so I thought)
eating those foods in excess," he ex
plains.
Adam recalls that he never com
mitted himself to a serious reducing
diet during his freshman year because
he said he felt that since he had paid so
much money for his meal plan, he
should eat as much as his taste buds de
sired. When reflecting back on this
type of thinking Adam said that it was
just an excuse for not losing weight.
'Don't let ridiculous ideas like that
stand in the way of what you know you
should be doing," he suggests.
Jean is another example of a for
merly overweight undergraduate who
managed to lose 43 pounds last year
while continuing to eat her meals at the
University's dining halls. The process
was slow (she lost two pounds a week),
but she was able to take off all that
weight without jeopardizing her
health.
She points out that it wasn't until she
finally made it one of her objectives to
take careful note of how much food she
was eating that she realized she was
eating when she wasn't really hungry.
In addition to eating when not hungry.
Jean also came to the conclusion that
"the types of foods that made up my
diet weren't the best. I always had des
sert and it was seldom when I didn't go
back for seconds."
Moderation important
While dieting. Jean ate a variety of
good and healthy foods, all in moderate
amounts. She followed a 1200 calorie
per day diet and never suffered from
hunger pangs. The bulk of her diet was
made up of fruits, vegetables, dairy
products, poultry and occasionally
meat. Desserts, gravy, and highly
caloric toppings like butter and salad
dressing were completely eliminated.
When asked what the most difficult
aspect of dieting was for her. Jean im
mediately replies: "Desserts. Passing
up homemade desserts every night for
months was so hard, especially in the
beginning. Desserts were the first
thing that you'd see in the food lines as
you walked through. It seemed as
though everyone was having dessert
except me."
In an attempt to cope with this dif
ficulty. Jean kept telling herself that

she was doing herself a favor by losing
weight and improving her health. Once
she had been on her diet long enough so
that her weight loss was noticeable,
"skipping desserts became easy be
cause my friends were constantly com
menting on how much better I looked
Sticking to my diet became simple
once I began getting positive feedback
from other people And what really
made me feel great was that other
friends of mine came to me for advice
on how to diet successfully at Food Ser
vice."
Exercise crucial
In addition to dieting. Jean in
corporated an exercise program in her
daily routine in an effort to tone up her
newly slender body. She began getting
back into shape very slowly. For two
months she walked as much as she
could It was after this two-month peri
od that Jean started jogging
She began very slowly, covering only
a half-mile at a time initially Since
then she has built her distance up to
three miles. (It has taken her four
months to reach this point.) Jean re
calls, "I was sore for two months be
cause of jogging, but I stuck it out and
I'm glad I did. "
Now an avid jogger. Jean adds that
"It's been great (referring to her ex
ercise program) because not only have
I improved my muscle tone, but it's
been a lot easier to maintain my
weight. Jogging curbs my appetite and
results in my craving foods that are
good for me and not that high in
calories, like fresh fruit and raw vege
tables."
Looking back on her accomplish
ment. Jean points out that anyone who
desires to lose weight badly enough can

"It's true that there are a lot of fattening foods that
are served by Food Service. But no one is forcing
you to eat them.'

do so while continuing to eat his meals
at the University's dining halls.
"There's no truth to the statement that
it's impossible to lose weight here. All
that's required is will power and dedi
cation. If you're careful and choose
your meals with care it's possible, and
not too terribly difficult." she states.
It's up to you
"It's true that there are a lot of fat
tening foods that are served by Food
Service. But no one is forcing you to eat
them. You and you alone are respon
sible for how much and what types of
food you eat." she said.
Adding that "I've never enjoyed my
life so fully as I do now." Jean en
courages anyone who needs to lose
weight to do so now. "Don't let the fat
tening food that's served in the dining
halls scare you. There's also plenty of
healthy, low calorie food there too. You

just have to make it a point to eat with
care. If you do, not only will you look
better, but you'll feel a lot better about ,
yourself."
Yet in spite of the inspirational ex
amples set by Jean and Adam, there
are still people like Bob who insist that
"it's impossible to lose weight while
eating at Food Service."
For these frustrated students who
are disappointed with the selection of
foods provided by Food Service. Lois
Ohms (who is also responsible for de
signing the master menus here) points
out that her menu selections reflect
those foods that most students say they
prefer Based on feedback that she re
ceives from various sources, Ohms de
signs her menus accordingly.
Representatives voice concerns
One area of input Ohms uses is ad
vice given to food service managers on
campus by each dorm's P'ood Service
representative. These representatives
attend biweekly meetings where they
let the food service managers know
what foods are popular and what others
are not among the student body.
Another way Ohms judges the popu
larity of specific foods here is through
the use of student taste panels. Any stu
dent can sign up if he or she wishes to
participate. Lists where one can sign
up are posted in the Food Commissary,
located on Pampas Lane. "Student
taste panels are an excellent way in
which students can let us know what
foods they'd like to see included in their
diet." says Ohms. "It's a shame that
more people don't participate."
Another channel through which stu
dents can express their likes and dis
likes regarding their meals is through
the checkers in the food lines. All stu
dent comments, both positive as well

as negative, are recorded by the check
ers. Next, these comments are re
viewed by the Food Service managers.
Finally. Ohms herself studies them.
Depending on how frequently a specific
request is made. Ohms tries to modify
the master menus so that students'
preferences are reflected in their com
position.
While it has been demonstrated by
many here that it is possible to control
one's weight and eat well. Dorman
points out that unless a person in
corporates healthy, conscientious eat
ing and exercise habits as a part of his
or her everyday routine, he or she will
never be completely successful at
keeping those lost pounds off for good.
"The key is to completely retrain your
eating and exercise habits for the rest
of your life," he said.

eating when she wasn't really hungry.
In addition to eating when not hungry.
Jean also came to the conclusion that
"the types of foods that made up my
diet weren't the best. I always had des
sert and it was seldom when I didn't go
back for seconds."
Moderation important
While dieting. Jean ate a variety of
good and healthy foods, all in moderate
amounts. She followed a 1200 calorie
per day diet and never suffered from
hunger pangs. The bulk of her diet was
made up of fruits, vegetables, dairy
products, poultry and occasionally
meat. Desserts, gravy, and highly
caloric toppings like butter and salad
dressing were completely eliminated.
When asked what the most difficult
aspect of dieting was for her. Jean im
mediately replies: "Desserts. Passing
up homemade desserts every night for
months was so hard, especially in the
beginning. Desserts were the first
thing that you'd see in the food lines as
you walked through. It seemed as
though everyone was having dessert
except me."
In an attempt to cope with this dif
ficulty. Jean kept telling herself that

she was doing herself a favor by losing
weight and improving her health. Once
she had been on her diet long enough so
that her weight loss was noticeable,
"skipping desserts became easy be
cause my friends were constantly com
menting on how much better I looked
Sticking to my diet became simple
once I began getting positive feedback
from other people And what really
made me feel great was that other
friends of mine came to me for advice
on how to diet successfully at Food Ser
vice."
Exercise crucial
In addition to dieting. Jean in
corporated an exercise program in her
daily routine in an effort to tone up her
newly slender body. She began getting
back into shape very slowly. For two
months she walked as much as she
could It was after this two-month peri
od that Jean started jogging
She began very slowly, covering only
a half-mile at a time initially Since
then she has built her distance up to
three miles. (It has taken her four
months to reach this point.) Jean re
calls, "I was sore for two months be
cause of jogging, but I stuck it out and
I'm glad I did. "
Now an avid jogger. Jean adds that
"It's been great (referring to her ex
ercise program) because not only have
I improved my muscle tone, but it's
been a lot easier to maintain my
weight. Jogging curbs my appetite and
results in my craving foods that are
good for me and not that high in
calories, like fresh fruit and raw vege
tables."
Looking back on her accomplish
ment. Jean points out that anyone who
desires to lose weight badly enough can

"It's true that there are a lot of fattening foods that
are served by Food Service. But no one is forcing
you to eat them.'

do so while continuing to eat his meals
at the University's dining halls.
"There's no truth to the statement that
it's impossible to lose weight here. All
that's required is will power and dedi
cation. If you're careful and choose
your meals with care it's possible, and
not too terribly difficult." she states.
It's up to you
"It's true that there are a lot of fat
tening foods that are served by Food
Service. But no one is forcing you to eat
them. You and you alone are respon
sible for how much and what types of
food you eat." she said.
Adding that "I've never enjoyed my
life so fully as I do now." Jean en
courages anyone who needs to lose
weight to do so now. "Don't let the fat
tening food that's served in the dining
halls scare you. There's also plenty of
healthy, low calorie food there too. You

just have to make it a point to eat with
care. If you do, not only will you look
better, but you'll feel a lot better about ,
yourself."
Yet in spite of the inspirational ex
amples set by Jean and Adam, there
are still people like Bob who insist that
"it's impossible to lose weight while
eating at Food Service."
For these frustrated students who
are disappointed with the selection of
foods provided by Food Service. Lois
Ohms (who is also responsible for de
signing the master menus here) points
out that her menu selections reflect
those foods that most students say they
prefer Based on feedback that she re
ceives from various sources, Ohms de
signs her menus accordingly.
Representatives voice concerns
One area of input Ohms uses is ad
vice given to food service managers on
campus by each dorm's P'ood Service
representative. These representatives
attend biweekly meetings where they
let the food service managers know
what foods are popular and what others
are not among the student body.
Another way Ohms judges the popu
larity of specific foods here is through
the use of student taste panels. Any stu
dent can sign up if he or she wishes to
participate. Lists where one can sign
up are posted in the Food Commissary,
located on Pampas Lane. "Student
taste panels are an excellent way in
which students can let us know what
foods they'd like to see included in their
diet." says Ohms. "It's a shame that
more people don't participate."
Another channel through which stu
dents can express their likes and dis
likes regarding their meals is through
the checkers in the food lines. All stu
dent comments, both positive as well

as negative, are recorded by the check
ers. Next, these comments are re
viewed by the Food Service managers.
Finally. Ohms herself studies them.
Depending on how frequently a specific
request is made. Ohms tries to modify
the master menus so that students'
preferences are reflected in their com
position.
While it has been demonstrated by
many here that it is possible to control
one's weight and eat well. Dorman
points out that unless a person in
corporates healthy, conscientious eat
ing and exercise habits as a part of his
or her everyday routine, he or she will
never be completely successful at
keeping those lost pounds off for good.
"The key is to completely retrain your
eating and exercise habits for the rest
of your life," he said.
It was only nine weeks ago when
Marie, a freshman from New York
City, came to Stanford weighing 120
pounds Today the indicator on her
scale reads 132. Marie is unhappy over
the fact that she has gained weight. In
addition to being unhappy. Marie is
also frustrated because she can't seem
to drop those extra pounds while conti
nuing to eat her meals prepared by Uni
versity Food Service.
Sound familiar? It seems as though
many students here (especially
freshmen) have a tendency to gain
weight when taking their meals at the
University's dining halls.
Dr. John Dorman, a physician at
Cowell Student Health Center, believes
there are many reasons that help ex-

i i person may not necessarily be hungry when he
or she goes back for seconds. They will go back
because the food is available . . . all that the
student has to do is eat. 9

plain why students are susceptible to
acquiring additional weight, especially
during their freshman year. It is during
this time, believes Dorman, that social
and academic pressures affect stu
dents.
For the first time in their lives, most
students are living away from home.
They experience the freedom of being
on their own. but along with that free
dom a certain amount of stress is also
present. A new academic as well as so
cial environment leads to the creation
of a "stressful situation" where it's
easy for a person to neglect his or her
diet. The tendency to overeat becomes
common as an undergraduate attempts
to handle the anxiety that Stanford
presents through food.
For others, however, the freedom of
being independent is initially not so
welcome. Homesickness is enough to
cause them to overeat. Ann, a junior
from Los Angeles, recalls, "I was so
homesick during my first quarter here
that I ate constantly in the hope that
my problem would go away ... but it
didn't. In addition to being homesick I
had another problem: nine additional
pounds."
Availability causes consumption
Lois Ohms, the University's Test
Kitchen Dietician, believes that stu
dents eat more while at school simply
because the food is there. "A person
may not necessarily be hungry when he
or she goes back for seconds. They will
go back because the food is available
and no cleaning up will be required as
far as dishes are concerned. All that
the student has to do is eat." In this
sense, believes Ohms, Food Service
provides "a luxury for students here."

The idea of luxury also ties in with
the notion that mealtimes are the most
convenient occasions when a student
can get together with his or her friends.
"The dinner hour is a time for social
izing," says John, a junior from San
Jose. He adds, "It's nice to be able to
sit in the dining hall for an hour or so
and relax with my friends whom I
haven't seen all day because we've all
been so busy with classes, work and
outside activities." A leisurely spent
dinner hour is unquestionably wel
come, but John is quick to point out that
"it's easy to overeat when socializing.
You'll get up and grab a second dessert
just because it's there â€” not because
you're hungry."
Regardless of the many reasons why
so manv students overeat and conse-

quently gain weight, the fact is that
they do. Currently there aren't any
statistics on how many people actually
do gain weight here, but it is generally
agreed that this phenomenon is a prob
lem and should be dealt with rather
than being ignored.
Food Service blamed
Unfortunately, it seems as though
many students are satisfied with the
answer that Bob, a sophomore from
San Diego, gives for explaining why he
hasn't lost the 14 extra pounds that he
gained during his freshman yeaf. "It's
impossible to lose weight while eating
at Food Service. All of the foods are
starchy 1 and the desserts are loaded
with calories. There's no way a person
can take off a pound while eating that
type of food," he said.
Is Bob correct in stating that it's
"impossible" to lose weight while eat
ing at Food Service? Kay Malik,
Wilbur Food Service manager, says
she disagrees with Bob and other stu
dents who follow a similar line of rea
soning. Malik said she believes that it
is possible for a student here to eat a
well-balanced diet (whether it be a re
ducing or a maintaining one) and re
main healthy.
The most important point here is
that one must be very careful about
which foods and how much of them he
or she eats, she said. Malik feels that
Food Service allows a sufficient selec
tion of foods whereby a person need not
starve himself or herself and become
sick if he or she decides to go on a seri
ous reducing diet.
It is vital, said Malik, for a student to

become conscientious about his or her
eating habits if he or she wants to lose
weight through a healthy diet. "As long
as a student makes his or her food
selections wisely, it's entirely possible
for him or her to drop extra weight,"
she said.
Reducing possible
Adam, a junior from Chicago, is
proof that Malik's claims are valid.
Last year he lost approximately 35
pounds while continuing to eat at the
University's dining halls. Most of his
additional weight was put on during his
freshman year. He attributes this to his
love of homemade desserts and breads.
"I just couldn't stop (or so I thought)
eating those foods in excess," he ex
plains.
Adam recalls that he never com
mitted himself to a serious reducing
diet during his freshman year because
he said he felt that since he had paid so
much money for his meal plan, he
should eat as much as his taste buds de
sired. When reflecting back on this
type of thinking Adam said that it was
just an excuse for not losing weight.
'Don't let ridiculous ideas like that
stand in the way of what you know you
should be doing," he suggests.
Jean is another example of a for
merly overweight undergraduate who
managed to lose 43 pounds last year
while continuing to eat her meals at the
University's dining halls. The process
was slow (she lost two pounds a week),
but she was able to take off all that
weight without jeopardizing her
health.
She points out that it wasn't until she
finally made it one of her objectives to
take careful note of how much food she
was eating that she realized she was
eating when she wasn't really hungry.
In addition to eating when not hungry.
Jean also came to the conclusion that
"the types of foods that made up my
diet weren't the best. I always had des
sert and it was seldom when I didn't go
back for seconds."
Moderation important
While dieting. Jean ate a variety of
good and healthy foods, all in moderate
amounts. She followed a 1200 calorie
per day diet and never suffered from

products, poultry and occasionally
meat. Desserts, gravy, and highly
caloric toppings like butter and salad
dressing were completely eliminated.

Sound familiar? It seems as though
many students here (especially
freshmen) have a tendency to gain
weight when taking their meals at the
University's dining halls.
Dr. John Dorman, a physician at
Cowell Student Health Center, believes
there are many reasons that help ex-

i i person may not necessarily be hungry when he
or she goes back for seconds. They will go back
because the food is available . . . all that the
student has to do is eat. 9

plain why students are susceptible to
acquiring additional weight, especially
during their freshman year. It is during
this time, believes Dorman, that social
and academic pressures affect stu
dents.
For the first time in their lives, most
students are living away from home.
They experience the freedom of being
on their own. but along with that free
dom a certain amount of stress is also
present. A new academic as well as so
cial environment leads to the creation
of a "stressful situation" where it's
easy for a person to neglect his or her
diet. The tendency to overeat becomes
common as an undergraduate attempts
to handle the anxiety that Stanford
presents through food.
For others, however, the freedom of
being independent is initially not so
welcome. Homesickness is enough to
cause them to overeat. Ann, a junior
from Los Angeles, recalls, "I was so
homesick during my first quarter here
that I ate constantly in the hope that
my problem would go away ... but it
didn't. In addition to being homesick I
had another problem: nine additional
pounds."
Availability causes consumption
Lois Ohms, the University's Test
Kitchen Dietician, believes that stu
dents eat more while at school simply
because the food is there. "A person
may not necessarily be hungry when he
or she goes back for seconds. They will
go back because the food is available
and no cleaning up will be required as
far as dishes are concerned. All that
the student has to do is eat." In this
sense, believes Ohms, Food Service
provides "a luxury for students here."

The idea of luxury also ties in with
the notion that mealtimes are the most
convenient occasions when a student
can get together with his or her friends.
"The dinner hour is a time for social
izing," says John, a junior from San
Jose. He adds, "It's nice to be able to
sit in the dining hall for an hour or so
and relax with my friends whom I
haven't seen all day because we've all
been so busy with classes, work and
outside activities." A leisurely spent
dinner hour is unquestionably wel
come, but John is quick to point out that
"it's easy to overeat when socializing.
You'll get up and grab a second dessert
just because it's there â€” not because
you're hungry."
Regardless of the many reasons why
so manv students overeat and conse-

quently gain weight, the fact is that
they do. Currently there aren't any
statistics on how many people actually
do gain weight here, but it is generally
agreed that this phenomenon is a prob
lem and should be dealt with rather
than being ignored.
Food Service blamed
Unfortunately, it seems as though
many students are satisfied with the
answer that Bob, a sophomore from
San Diego, gives for explaining why he
hasn't lost the 14 extra pounds that he
gained during his freshman yeaf. "It's
impossible to lose weight while eating
at Food Service. All of the foods are
starchy 1 and the desserts are loaded
with calories. There's no way a person
can take off a pound while eating that
type of food," he said.
Is Bob correct in stating that it's
"impossible" to lose weight while eat
ing at Food Service? Kay Malik,
Wilbur Food Service manager, says
she disagrees with Bob and other stu
dents who follow a similar line of rea
soning. Malik said she believes that it
is possible for a student here to eat a
well-balanced diet (whether it be a re
ducing or a maintaining one) and re
main healthy.
The most important point here is
that one must be very careful about
which foods and how much of them he
or she eats, she said. Malik feels that
Food Service allows a sufficient selec
tion of foods whereby a person need not
starve himself or herself and become
sick if he or she decides to go on a seri
ous reducing diet.
It is vital, said Malik, for a student to

become conscientious about his or her
eating habits if he or she wants to lose
weight through a healthy diet. "As long
as a student makes his or her food
selections wisely, it's entirely possible
for him or her to drop extra weight,"
she said.
Reducing possible
Adam, a junior from Chicago, is
proof that Malik's claims are valid.
Last year he lost approximately 35
pounds while continuing to eat at the
University's dining halls. Most of his
additional weight was put on during his
freshman year. He attributes this to his
love of homemade desserts and breads.
"I just couldn't stop (or so I thought)
eating those foods in excess," he ex
plains.
Adam recalls that he never com
mitted himself to a serious reducing
diet during his freshman year because
he said he felt that since he had paid so
much money for his meal plan, he
should eat as much as his taste buds de
sired. When reflecting back on this
type of thinking Adam said that it was
just an excuse for not losing weight.
'Don't let ridiculous ideas like that
stand in the way of what you know you
should be doing," he suggests.
Jean is another example of a for
merly overweight undergraduate who
managed to lose 43 pounds last year
while continuing to eat her meals at the
University's dining halls. The process
was slow (she lost two pounds a week),
but she was able to take off all that
weight without jeopardizing her
health.
She points out that it wasn't until she
finally made it one of her objectives to
take careful note of how much food she
was eating that she realized she was
eating when she wasn't really hungry.
In addition to eating when not hungry.
Jean also came to the conclusion that
"the types of foods that made up my
diet weren't the best. I always had des
sert and it was seldom when I didn't go
back for seconds."
Moderation important
While dieting. Jean ate a variety of
good and healthy foods, all in moderate
amounts. She followed a 1200 calorie
per day diet and never suffered from
hunger pangs. The bulk of her diet was
made up of fruits, vegetables, dairy
products, poultry and occasionally
meat. Desserts, gravy, and highly
caloric toppings like butter and salad
dressing were completely eliminated.
When asked what the most difficult
aspect of dieting was for her. Jean im
mediately replies: "Desserts. Passing
up homemade desserts every night for
months was so hard, especially in the
beginning. Desserts were the first
thing that you'd see in the food lines as
you walked through. It seemed as
though everyone was having dessert
except me."
In an attempt to cope with this dif
ficulty. Jean kept telling herself that

she was doing herself a favor by losing
weight and improving her health. Once
she had been on her diet long enough so
that her weight loss was noticeable,
"skipping desserts became easy be
cause my friends were constantly com
menting on how much better I looked
Sticking to my diet became simple
once I began getting positive feedback
from other people And what really
made me feel great was that other
friends of mine came to me for advice
on how to diet successfully at Food Ser
vice."
Exercise crucial
In addition to dieting. Jean in
corporated an exercise program in her
daily routine in an effort to tone up her
newly slender body. She began getting
back into shape very slowly. For two
months she walked as much as she
could It was after this two-month peri
od that Jean started jogging
She began very slowly, covering only
a half-mile at a time initially Since
then she has built her distance up to
three miles. (It has taken her four
months to reach this point.) Jean re
calls, "I was sore for two months be
cause of jogging, but I stuck it out and
I'm glad I did. "
Now an avid jogger. Jean adds that
"It's been great (referring to her ex
ercise program) because not only have
I improved my muscle tone, but it's
been a lot easier to maintain my
weight. Jogging curbs my appetite and
results in my craving foods that are
good for me and not that high in
calories, like fresh fruit and raw vege
tables."
Looking back on her accomplish
ment. Jean points out that anyone who
desires to lose weight badly enough can

"It's true that there are a lot of fattening foods that
are served by Food Service. But no one is forcing
you to eat them.'

do so while continuing to eat his meals
at the University's dining halls.
"There's no truth to the statement that
it's impossible to lose weight here. All
that's required is will power and dedi
cation. If you're careful and choose
your meals with care it's possible, and
not too terribly difficult." she states.
It's up to you
"It's true that there are a lot of fat
tening foods that are served by Food
Service. But no one is forcing you to eat
them. You and you alone are respon
sible for how much and what types of
food you eat." she said.
Adding that "I've never enjoyed my
life so fully as I do now." Jean en
courages anyone who needs to lose
weight to do so now. "Don't let the fat
tening food that's served in the dining
halls scare you. There's also plenty of
healthy, low calorie food there too. You

just have to make it a point to eat with
care. If you do, not only will you look
better, but you'll feel a lot better about ,
yourself."
Yet in spite of the inspirational ex
amples set by Jean and Adam, there
are still people like Bob who insist that
"it's impossible to lose weight while
eating at Food Service."
For these frustrated students who
are disappointed with the selection of
foods provided by Food Service. Lois
Ohms (who is also responsible for de
signing the master menus here) points
out that her menu selections reflect
those foods that most students say they
prefer Based on feedback that she re
ceives from various sources, Ohms de
signs her menus accordingly.
Representatives voice concerns
One area of input Ohms uses is ad
vice given to food service managers on
campus by each dorm's P'ood Service
representative. These representatives
attend biweekly meetings where they
let the food service managers know
what foods are popular and what others
are not among the student body.
Another way Ohms judges the popu
larity of specific foods here is through
the use of student taste panels. Any stu
dent can sign up if he or she wishes to
participate. Lists where one can sign
up are posted in the Food Commissary,
located on Pampas Lane. "Student
taste panels are an excellent way in
which students can let us know what
foods they'd like to see included in their
diet." says Ohms. "It's a shame that
more people don't participate."
Another channel through which stu
dents can express their likes and dis
likes regarding their meals is through
the checkers in the food lines. All stu
dent comments, both positive as well

as negative, are recorded by the check
ers. Next, these comments are re
viewed by the Food Service managers.
Finally. Ohms herself studies them.
Depending on how frequently a specific
request is made. Ohms tries to modify
the master menus so that students'
preferences are reflected in their com
position.
While it has been demonstrated by
many here that it is possible to control
one's weight and eat well. Dorman
points out that unless a person in
corporates healthy, conscientious eat
ing and exercise habits as a part of his
or her everyday routine, he or she will
never be completely successful at
keeping those lost pounds off for good.
"The key is to completely retrain your
eating and exercise habits for the rest
of your life," he said.
It was only nine weeks ago when
Marie, a freshman from New York
City, came to Stanford weighing 120

sert and it was seldom when I didn't go
back for seconds."
Moderation important
While dieting. Jean ate a variety of
good and healthy foods, all in moderate
amounts. She followed a 1200 calorie
per day diet and never suffered from
hunger pangs. The bulk of her diet was
made up of fruits, vegetables, dairy
products, poultry and occasionally
meat. Desserts, gravy, and highly
caloric toppings like butter and salad
dressing were completely eliminated.
When asked what the most difficult
aspect of dieting was for her. Jean im
mediately replies: "Desserts. Passing
up homemade desserts every night for
months was so hard, especially in the
beginning. Desserts were the first
thing that you'd see in the food lines as
you walked through. It seemed as
though everyone was having dessert
except me."
In an attempt to cope with this dif
ficulty. Jean kept telling herself that

she was doing herself a favor by losing
weight and improving her health. Once
she had been on her diet long enough so
that her weight loss was noticeable,
"skipping desserts became easy be
cause my friends were constantly com
menting on how much better I looked
Sticking to my diet became simple
once I began getting positive feedback
from other people And what really
made me feel great was that other
friends of mine came to me for advice
on how to diet successfully at Food Ser
vice."
Exercise crucial
In addition to dieting. Jean in
corporated an exercise program in her
daily routine in an effort to tone up her
newly slender body. She began getting
back into shape very slowly. For two
months she walked as much as she
could It was after this two-month peri
od that Jean started jogging
She began very slowly, covering only
a half-mile at a time initially Since
then she has built her distance up to
three miles. (It has taken her four
months to reach this point.) Jean re
calls, "I was sore for two months be
cause of jogging, but I stuck it out and
I'm glad I did. "
Now an avid jogger. Jean adds that
"It's been great (referring to her ex
ercise program) because not only have
I improved my muscle tone, but it's
been a lot easier to maintain my
weight. Jogging curbs my appetite and
results in my craving foods that are
good for me and not that high in
calories, like fresh fruit and raw vege
tables."
Looking back on her accomplish
ment. Jean points out that anyone who
desires to lose weight badly enough can

"It's true that there are a lot of fattening foods that
are served by Food Service. But no one is forcing
you to eat them.'

do so while continuing to eat his meals
at the University's dining halls.
"There's no truth to the statement that
it's impossible to lose weight here. All
that's required is will power and dedi
cation. If you're careful and choose
your meals with care it's possible, and
not too terribly difficult." she states.
It's up to you
"It's true that there are a lot of fat
tening foods that are served by Food
Service. But no one is forcing you to eat
them. You and you alone are respon
sible for how much and what types of
food you eat." she said.
Adding that "I've never enjoyed my
life so fully as I do now." Jean en
courages anyone who needs to lose
weight to do so now. "Don't let the fat
tening food that's served in the dining
halls scare you. There's also plenty of
healthy, low calorie food there too. You

just have to make it a point to eat with
care. If you do, not only will you look
better, but you'll feel a lot better about ,
yourself."
Yet in spite of the inspirational ex
amples set by Jean and Adam, there
are still people like Bob who insist that
"it's impossible to lose weight while
eating at Food Service."
For these frustrated students who
are disappointed with the selection of
foods provided by Food Service. Lois
Ohms (who is also responsible for de
signing the master menus here) points
out that her menu selections reflect
those foods that most students say they
prefer Based on feedback that she re
ceives from various sources, Ohms de
signs her menus accordingly.
Representatives voice concerns
One area of input Ohms uses is ad
vice given to food service managers on
campus by each dorm's P'ood Service
representative. These representatives
attend biweekly meetings where they
let the food service managers know
what foods are popular and what others
are not among the student body.
Another way Ohms judges the popu
larity of specific foods here is through
the use of student taste panels. Any stu
dent can sign up if he or she wishes to
participate. Lists where one can sign
up are posted in the Food Commissary,
located on Pampas Lane. "Student
taste panels are an excellent way in
which students can let us know what
foods they'd like to see included in their
diet." says Ohms. "It's a shame that
more people don't participate."
Another channel through which stu
dents can express their likes and dis
likes regarding their meals is through
the checkers in the food lines. All stu
dent comments, both positive as well

as negative, are recorded by the check
ers. Next, these comments are re
viewed by the Food Service managers.
Finally. Ohms herself studies them.
Depending on how frequently a specific
request is made. Ohms tries to modify
the master menus so that students'
preferences are reflected in their com
position.
While it has been demonstrated by
many here that it is possible to control
one's weight and eat well. Dorman
points out that unless a person in
corporates healthy, conscientious eat
ing and exercise habits as a part of his
or her everyday routine, he or she will
never be completely successful at
keeping those lost pounds off for good.
"The key is to completely retrain your
eating and exercise habits for the rest
of your life," he said.
It was only nine weeks ago when
Marie, a freshman from New York
City, came to Stanford weighing 120
pounds Today the indicator on her
scale reads 132. Marie is unhappy over
the fact that she has gained weight. In
addition to being unhappy. Marie is
also frustrated because she can't seem
to drop those extra pounds while conti
nuing to eat her meals prepared by Uni
versity Food Service.
Sound familiar? It seems as though
many students here (especially
freshmen) have a tendency to gain
weight when taking their meals at the
University's dining halls.
Dr. John Dorman, a physician at
Cowell Student Health Center, believes
there are many reasons that help ex-

i i person may not necessarily be hungry when he
or she goes back for seconds. They will go back
because the food is available . . . all that the
student has to do is eat. 9

plain why students are susceptible to
acquiring additional weight, especially
during their freshman year. It is during
this time, believes Dorman, that social
and academic pressures affect stu
dents.
For the first time in their lives, most
students are living away from home.
They experience the freedom of being
on their own. but along with that free
dom a certain amount of stress is also
present. A new academic as well as so
cial environment leads to the creation
of a "stressful situation" where it's
easy for a person to neglect his or her
diet. The tendency to overeat becomes
common as an undergraduate attempts
to handle the anxiety that Stanford
presents through food.
For others, however, the freedom of
being independent is initially not so
welcome. Homesickness is enough to
cause them to overeat. Ann, a junior
from Los Angeles, recalls, "I was so
homesick during my first quarter here
that I ate constantly in the hope that
my problem would go away ... but it
didn't. In addition to being homesick I
had another problem: nine additional
pounds."
Availability causes consumption
Lois Ohms, the University's Test
Kitchen Dietician, believes that stu
dents eat more while at school simply
because the food is there. "A person
may not necessarily be hungry when he
or she goes back for seconds. They will
go back because the food is available
and no cleaning up will be required as
far as dishes are concerned. All that
the student has to do is eat." In this
sense, believes Ohms, Food Service
provides "a luxury for students here."

The idea of luxury also ties in with
the notion that mealtimes are the most
convenient occasions when a student
can get together with his or her friends.
"The dinner hour is a time for social
izing," says John, a junior from San
Jose. He adds, "It's nice to be able to
sit in the dining hall for an hour or so
and relax with my friends whom I
haven't seen all day because we've all
been so busy with classes, work and
outside activities." A leisurely spent
dinner hour is unquestionably wel
come, but John is quick to point out that
"it's easy to overeat when socializing.
You'll get up and grab a second dessert
just because it's there â€” not because
you're hungry."
Regardless of the many reasons why
so manv students overeat and conse-

quently gain weight, the fact is that
they do. Currently there aren't any
statistics on how many people actually
do gain weight here, but it is generally
agreed that this phenomenon is a prob
lem and should be dealt with rather
than being ignored.
Food Service blamed
Unfortunately, it seems as though
many students are satisfied with the
answer that Bob, a sophomore from
San Diego, gives for explaining why he
hasn't lost the 14 extra pounds that he
gained during his freshman yeaf. "It's
impossible to lose weight while eating
at Food Service. All of the foods are
starchy 1 and the desserts are loaded
with calories. There's no way a person
can take off a pound while eating that
type of food," he said.
Is Bob correct in stating that it's
"impossible" to lose weight while eat
ing at Food Service? Kay Malik,
Wilbur Food Service manager, says
she disagrees with Bob and other stu
dents who follow a similar line of rea
soning. Malik said she believes that it
is possible for a student here to eat a
well-balanced diet (whether it be a re
ducing or a maintaining one) and re
main healthy.
The most important point here is
that one must be very careful about
which foods and how much of them he
or she eats, she said. Malik feels that
Food Service allows a sufficient selec
tion of foods whereby a person need not
starve himself or herself and become
sick if he or she decides to go on a seri
ous reducing diet.
It is vital, said Malik, for a student to

become conscientious about his or her
eating habits if he or she wants to lose
weight through a healthy diet. "As long
as a student makes his or her food
selections wisely, it's entirely possible
for him or her to drop extra weight,"
she said.
Reducing possible
Adam, a junior from Chicago, is
proof that Malik's claims are valid.
Last year he lost approximately 35
pounds while continuing to eat at the
University's dining halls. Most of his
additional weight was put on during his
freshman year. He attributes this to his
love of homemade desserts and breads.
"I just couldn't stop (or so I thought)
eating those foods in excess," he ex
plains.
Adam recalls that he never com
mitted himself to a serious reducing
diet during his freshman year because
he said he felt that since he had paid so
much money for his meal plan, he
should eat as much as his taste buds de
sired. When reflecting back on this
type of thinking Adam said that it was
just an excuse for not losing weight.
'Don't let ridiculous ideas like that
stand in the way of what you know you
should be doing," he suggests.
Jean is another example of a for
merly overweight undergraduate who
managed to lose 43 pounds last year
while continuing to eat her meals at the
University's dining halls. The process
was slow (she lost two pounds a week),
but she was able to take off all that
weight without jeopardizing her
health.
She points out that it wasn't until she
finally made it one of her objectives to
take careful note of how much food she
was eating that she realized she was
eating when she wasn't really hungry.
In addition to eating when not hungry.
Jean also came to the conclusion that
"the types of foods that made up my
diet weren't the best. I always had des
sert and it was seldom when I didn't go
back for seconds."
Moderation important
While dieting. Jean ate a variety of
