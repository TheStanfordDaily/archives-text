## Experts view agriculture as future source of food, fuel 
### Washington Post 
The increasing world population places the
burden on developed nations of redoubling their
efforts to help feed the hungry millions of develop
ing countries. Most leaders in agriculture believe
it can be done only by increasing research efforts.
We all have vested interests in agricultural re
search. says Dr. Ray Moore, associate dean and
director of the agricultural experiment station at
South Dakota State University.
"We all must eat," he says. "Will we some day
adapt corn, wheat, oats and barley to use ni
trogen-fixing bacteria and trim our use of high
energy fertilizer? A substitute for oil for energy
also is important.
"Our future crises are going to make our pres
ent one look like a lamb by comparison.
"The risk is high, and the cost will be great for
basic kinds of research, but the impact of success,
be it ever so remote, is so great that we cannot af
ford not to do the research, even if we will not see
a payoff in the immediate future."
Considerable progress already has been made.
Some examples:
Sugar beets are a prime candidate for alcohol
fuel production because they store their energy as
sucrose, a fermentable sugar, according to a re
search report by Devon Doney and J.C. Theurer,
research geneticists at Utah State University.
"The sugar beet is very efficient," the report
says, "storing from 40 to 45 percent of its total
biomass as sugar. The easiest and cheapest meth
od of producing alcohol from biomass is from
fermentable sugars.
"One gallon of alcohol with nine gallons of
gasoline provides 10 gallons of gasohol. Nine mil
lion barrels of crude oil are imported daily. Alco
hol fuel will replace one-tenth of that. Scientists
are expected to substantially revise (and perhaps
reverse) this one-to-nine ratio while simultane
ously turning more of the plant itself into alcohol.
Fuei that is 10 percent alcohol would mean 330
million fewer barrels of oil imported to the U.S.
each year."
Improvement of the ability of legumes to fix ni
trogen from air is one of the keys to cheaper and
better food production, according to 150 scientists
who gathered at Gainesville, Fla., for the Sixth
American Rhizobium Conference. Rhizobium is
responsible for nitrogen fixation in legumes such
as peanuts and soybeans.
"Until recently growers have relied on

chemical fertilizer to supply nitrogen to the soil
for their crops," says Walter Scudder, University
of Florida horticulturist, who for 10 years has
been conducting Rhizobium research with soy
beans. "But with the high cost of energy involved
in the making of fertilizer and the concern over
nitrate pollution, this practice is becoming pro
hibitive to the grower."
Scudder and others at the conference felt that
scientists can improve the nitrogen fixing process
begun by nature by learning why the bacteria in
fect only certain plants and how they gain entry
into the root svstem.

The fuel properties of maturecd wood
harvested from natural forests have been known
for a long time, but little is known about the
energy potential of juvenile, fast-growing hard
woods raised under intensive silvicultural sys
tems.
This need led to an investigation into the poten
tial fuel value of woody biomass, short-rotation
trees at the University of Illinois, which is now in
progress. Unlike fossil fuel, wood supplies are re
newable, and in the future wood may serve as a
standby fuel for industry when oil or low sulfur
coal is scarce.
Someday woody biomass may even satisfy a
significant part of the nation's energy require
ments, according to the researchers.
With low ash and sulfur content, the biomass of
2-year-old sycamores is a relatively clean fuel
compared with coal, their research report said.
Because ash is not combustible, it stays in the
furnace and tends to interfere with combustion.
A significant amount of sulfur in fuel is espe
cially undesirable because of problems with cor
rosion and emissions into the air. The heat content
was somewhat greater in our young samples than
in the matured wood of the same species.
A new white potato called Bel√üus has been de
veloped by Dr. Raymon Webb. USDA Science and
Education Administration plant breeder. Tai
lored to growing requirements in the Northeast
and Midwest, it is rated very high in quality, has a
medium-late maturing date and is resistant to
major potato viruses, Webb says.
