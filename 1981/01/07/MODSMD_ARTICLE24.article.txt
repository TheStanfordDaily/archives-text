# Lockheed designs lab for shuttle
## 
### 
A working model of an all
purpose table-top laboratory de
signed to fit into spacelab on the
space shuttle, was delivered to
day in NASA's Ames Research
Center by Lockheed
Designed and built by
Lockheed Missiles and Space
Co. Biotechnology Organization
under contract, the portable
laboratory — officially the gen
eral purpose work station — is
intended to support general life
sciences laboratory experi
ments conducted in weightless
space.
The scientists' hooded work
bench is extremely versatile,
according to Lockheed Project
Leader Philip Wagner. "It is
capable of being adapted to the
particular requirements of
many different life science ex
periments," Wagner says. "An
important function for it is to
protect experimenters as well

as the specimens from
biological contamination and to
control liquids and chemical va
pors released inside the labora
tory in a zero-gravity environ
ment."
The laboratory — really a
controlled environment "Clean
room" — also has a camera
stand available, to photograph
experiments, and interior light
ing and connections that bring
electricity, water, vacuum and
data links to the experimenter.
The tiny laboratory can be
used in one of the three positions
in zero gravity — (1) in its
storage rack in one wall when
used by a standing ex
perimenter; (2) partially pulled
from the rack and used by a
seated experimenter; and (3)
pulled entirely out of the rack,
pivoted 90 degrees, and used by
tow experimenters seated op
posite each other.
