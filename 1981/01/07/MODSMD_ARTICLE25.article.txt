Supernova seen
Utilizing a special wide
field telescope at Cerro
Pobles, Chile, Drs. Marina
Wischnjewskv and Jose
Maza of the University Chile
have recently discovered a
supernova in galaxy Fornax
A.
Generally, supernovae re
sult from the colliding and
subsequent collapse of stars.
This violent degeneration
emits an amount of light
equivalent to that of the "pa
rent" galaxy which produced
the explosion.
The supernova discovered
bv Wischnjewsky and Maza
occurred 50 million years
ago. But the light from this
collision, was not observed
here until November 30.1980.
Now. as more light from the
collapsed galaxy reaches
earth, this supernova seems
to grow more luminous: In
one month's time, it has
grown four times more radi
ant

This supernova is unusual
as it was apparently sired by
the recent crashing of two
galaxies. This means a mix
ture of stars produced the ex
plosion being observed an
event which occurs only once
every hundred years (ap
proximately ). No such su
pernova has been observed in
our own galaxy, the Milky
Way, since 1604.
Quake damage
predictable
What kind of damage
would a major earthquake
really inflict on the Bay
Area's modern skyscrapers
and historic structures? An
answer to this problem is
now possible, thanks to the
new computer which engi
neers at the J. H. Wiggins
Company, headquartered in
Redondo Beach, have recent
ly produced.
The computer, designed
with the needs of building of
ficials in mind, can be used

by safety departments to de
termine how safe specific
buildings are when exposed
to earthquakes, severe
winds, or tornadoes.
The computer-seer was
created using data from past
earthquakes which allowed
researchers to determine
how factors such as size or
building age relate to earth
quake damage. Information
was compared with theo
retical models, which were
than analyzed and modified.
Rings still a mystery
Toronto (AP) — The
braided rings of Saturn, the
most dramatic discovery of
the $500 million Voyager I
space mission, remain a
mystery, a leader of the Voy
ager scientific team re
ported Monday.
"I have to tell you right
now that our progress in un
derstanding the rings is dis
appointingly slow," Brad
ford Smith, University of

Tucson astronomer, told tht
annual meeting of the Ameri
can Association for the Ad
vancement of Science.
Smith, a leader of the Voy
ager I scientific team, said
the strange, twisted and
braided structure of the
rings, in apparent defianceof
the laws of orbital physics,
could be due to high order in
teractions between the rings
and with Saturn's gravity or
with the planet's electrical
and magnetic fields.
Voyager, a $500 million
project launched more more
three years ago. astonished
scientists with its discovery
of hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of tiny ringlets in
the three braids, stretching
50 miles across and 50,000
miles above the surface of
Saturn.
Smith also reported that
ground-based observations
have picked up still another
satellite of Saturn, its 16th
moon, giving the planet as
many moons as Jupiter.
