## Revolutionizing football 
### 
As a faithful reporter
searching only for truth, jus-'
tice and the American way. I
feel it is not only my job to re
port sports to you. our
reader, in a truthful and
forthright manner, but also
to look for ways in which to
make sports reporting as en
joyable. entertaining and
most of all. as enlightening
as possible
In my erstwhile study of
that most American of
sports, football. I have come
up with two ideas which will
not only make it easier to un
derstand that ballet of brute
force which takes place on
the hallowed gridiron, but
will also benefit those all-im
portant constituents of sport,
the fan. the player and the
network
These ideas will not only
make that ballet of brute
force known as football more
palatable for you. our
faithful reader, but will
make the game more effi
cient. streamlining it so that
even a Cal graduate can un
derstand the nuances of that
great American game
Your faithful reporter
must admit that the first of
these ideas did not originate
here, but in that bastion of ef
ficiency. the ideal for every
government agency, the
United States Postal Ser
vice.
The Postal Service has de
duced the following: that if a
five-digit ZIP Code can aid in
delivering the mail, that a
nine-digit ZIP Code can do it
almost twice as effectively.
I say humbly that I only
take the idea to its logical ex
tension If I did not. I'm sure
someone else would, for it is
beautiful in its simplicity.
If nine numbers work bet
ter than five for those hardy
souls who trod through the
snow, rain and gloom of
night, than why tell you. our
faithful reader, only how
many points each team
scored? That barely
scratches the surface of
what took place in that ballet
of brute force known as foot

ball
For instance, say Stanford
beats Oregon State 34-14.
What does that really tell you
of the action, the physical
battle waged so gallantly be
tween the sidelines 0
In what has been labeled
the Post Office Plan, the
aforementioned score would
read as follows Stanford
34-27-T2. Oregon 14-15-T5.
Not only would you. our
faithful reader, know how
many points were scored
(34-i4), but first downs
(27-151. and for those of you
who appreciate the mighty
feats performed on the other
side of the football, turn
overs (T2-T5).
Yes. it is amazing in its
simplicity. But there is more
to this humble plan than
meets the eye. In the genius
of its simpiicity. in a plan
that could only have ori
ginated in the hallowed halls
of our government, there is
the plan that could right our
economy.
Think of the savings! The
average game story of that
ballet of brute force known
as football now takes up to 30
column inches. But by giving
you. our faithful reader, the
needed information in six or
seven simple numbers, the
average game story will now
need only 10 or 15 inches.
But why limit this plan to
just the score of a game?
Why not extend it to players'
numbers? No longer will
John Elwav be known as just
No. 7. Sure you know who he
is. but what else does that
number tell vou° Does it tell
you how many touchdowns

ly number 7 does not But

screams it aloud.
Think of the publicity that
will be reaped from this!
"John Elway. the 7-27 Bomb
er." Or Darrin Nelson. No.
31-889 (yards gained). Of
course, the numbers would
change with every game, but
it is only to ensure that you.
our faithful reader, will be
given the most accurate in

formation in the most con
cise manner possible
If any of you are like me.
you spent the recent two
week respite from the
bowels of Green Library eat
ing and drinking, solidly en
trenched in front of the tele
vision watching every col
lege except Stanford in this,
our great nation, play in the
bowl games.
I do the same thing every
Christmas holiday, as do mil
lions of other fans I try to
gorge myself with enough
college football to last until
Labor Day. And as usual, by
the time the Orange Bowl
rolls around New Year's
Night. I was so overstuffed
that the only thing I could do
was run a down-and-out to
the bathroom for some Alka
Seltzer.
Evidently NBC knew how I
felt, for they loaded the Or
ange Bowl with enough elec
tronic gimmickry to light the
city of Miami for a decade.
They put a microphone on the
head referee and they put a
reporter on the sidelines to
get the players' reactions be
tween plays, to give you, the
fan of that great American
game, the real action.
However. I feel they
missed the point. There are
few among us who can really
know what it is like on the
sidelines. But we do know
what goes on in the stands.
Therefore. I humbly suggest
that NBC-TV put a micro
phone on the average fan.
Nothing more could give
you. our faithful reader, the
real feel of the game. Think
of the undiscovered mother
lode of commentary, the
analysis you get when you sit
in the stands watching that
ballet of brute force known
as football. Comments like:
— "Hey. siddow r n in front,
you jerk' You didn't buy but
one ticket. I can't see noth
ing."
— "Kill the bastards."
— "Timmy, what do you
mean you have to go to the
bathroom again? This is the
third time this half!"

tension If I did not. I'm sure
someone else would, for it is
beautiful in its simplicity.
If nine numbers work bet
ter than five for those hardy
souls who trod through the
snow, rain and gloom of
night, than why tell you. our
faithful reader, only how
many points each team
scored? That barely
scratches the surface of
what took place in that ballet
of brute force known as foot

ball
For instance, say Stanford
beats Oregon State 34-14.
What does that really tell you
of the action, the physical
battle waged so gallantly be
tween the sidelines 0
In what has been labeled
the Post Office Plan, the
aforementioned score would
read as follows Stanford
34-27-T2. Oregon 14-15-T5.
Not only would you. our
faithful reader, know how
many points were scored
(34-i4), but first downs
(27-151. and for those of you
who appreciate the mighty
feats performed on the other
side of the football, turn
overs (T2-T5).
Yes. it is amazing in its
simplicity. But there is more
to this humble plan than
meets the eye. In the genius
of its simpiicity. in a plan
that could only have ori
ginated in the hallowed halls
of our government, there is
the plan that could right our
economy.
Think of the savings! The
average game story of that
ballet of brute force known
as football now takes up to 30
column inches. But by giving
you. our faithful reader, the
needed information in six or
seven simple numbers, the
average game story will now
need only 10 or 15 inches.
But why limit this plan to
just the score of a game?
Why not extend it to players'
numbers? No longer will

gorge myself with enough
college football to last until
Labor Day. And as usual, by
the time the Orange Bowl
rolls around New Year's
Night. I was so overstuffed
that the only thing I could do
was run a down-and-out to
the bathroom for some Alka
Seltzer.
Evidently NBC knew how I
felt, for they loaded the Or
ange Bowl with enough elec
tronic gimmickry to light the
city of Miami for a decade.
They put a microphone on the
head referee and they put a
reporter on the sidelines to
get the players' reactions be
tween plays, to give you, the
fan of that great American
game, the real action.
However. I feel they
missed the point. There are
few among us who can really
know what it is like on the
sidelines. But we do know
what goes on in the stands.
Therefore. I humbly suggest
that NBC-TV put a micro
phone on the average fan.
Nothing more could give
you. our faithful reader, the
real feel of the game. Think
of the undiscovered mother
lode of commentary, the
analysis you get when you sit
in the stands watching that
ballet of brute force known
as football. Comments like:
— "Hey. siddow r n in front,

— "Kill the bastards."
— "Timmy, what do you

As a faithful reporter

feel it is not only my job to re

to look for ways in which to

joyable. entertaining and

as possible
In my erstwhile study of
that most American of
sports, football. I have come
up with two ideas which will
not only make it easier to un
derstand that ballet of brute
force which takes place on
the hallowed gridiron, but
will also benefit those all-im
portant constituents of sport,
the fan. the player and the
network
These ideas will not only
make that ballet of brute
force known as football more
palatable for you. our
faithful reader, but will
make the game more effi
cient. streamlining it so that
even a Cal graduate can un
derstand the nuances of that
great American game
Your faithful reporter
must admit that the first of
these ideas did not originate
here, but in that bastion of ef
ficiency. the ideal for every
government agency, the
United States Postal Ser
vice.
The Postal Service has de
duced the following: that if a
five-digit ZIP Code can aid in
delivering the mail, that a
nine-digit ZIP Code can do it
almost twice as effectively.
I say humbly that I only
take the idea to its logical ex
tension If I did not. I'm sure
