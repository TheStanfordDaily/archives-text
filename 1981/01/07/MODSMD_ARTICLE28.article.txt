# Academic woes finish Ward for '81
## 
### Chris Haft 
Stanford's men s basketball
team will have to face its rigor
ous Pacific-10 Conference
schedule without one of its best
players. Orlando Ward The jun
ior from Santa Ana was ruled in
eligible Monday for the re
mainder of the 1960-81 season
because of academic dif
ficulties.
Ward, who was unavailable
for comment, will not attend
Stanford for the rest of the
academic year, according to
Cardinal head coach Dick
Dißiaso. "I imagine Orlando
will probably take a couple of
courses someplace else,
Dißiaso speculated
Whether or not Ward will re
turn to Stanford in 1981-82 re
mains unsure. "I would hope we
could entertain that possi
bility." Dißiaso said hopefully.
"Just like all students, he, has
the right to petition for readmis
sion."
Ironically, Ward, an econom
ics major, was still eligible by
NCAA standards but failed to
meet Stanford's requirements.
In Dißiaso's words. Ward
"wasn't making normal
academic progress" — that is.
he wasn't maintaining a pace
that would allow him to com
plete 36 units in a year. The
NCAA, meanwhile, essentially
prescribes that once an athlete

is eligible to begin the school
year, he is eligible for the whole
year.
Ward first learned of his sta
tus by mail during Christmas
vacation and had to miss Satur
day night's Pac-10 opener
against California. Because
University offices were closed
for the holidays, he could not

discuss his situation with school
authorities and receive his ul
timate penalty until Monday.
"He met with people in
academic counseling, just like
any student would." Dißiaso
said
The sixth-year coach implied
that he knew Ward was ex
periencing scholastic troubles.
"He's been aware of certain
things academically," said
Dißiaso, who follows his
players' academic pursuits bv
talking with their advisers peri
odically.
More recently. Dißiaso has
talked seriously with Ward
himself. "We've had three long
conversations since Friday,"
Dißiaso said, explaining that
the talks amounted to "my giv
ing him the opportunity to ex
press how he feels, and trying to
get him to recognize problems
and discover what he needs to do
to correct them.
"He had all the feelings you
could imagine he would feel,"
Dißiaso continued. "He thinks
he's let his teammates down and
he feels bad about not doing the
work, because he feels capable
of doing it."

Dißiaso emphasized that
Ward's dilemma shouldn't be
regarded as extremely dis
astrous.
"It's not a tragedy. Death is a
tragedy *— there are no over
times there. But if you don't
graduate in four years the world
won't come to an end."
Apparently adept at
philosophizing. Dißiaso must
now contend with the im
mediate effect of Ward's in
eligibility. The Cardinals have
to try to replace a 6-foot-8 for
ward who averaged 10.7 points
and 6 7 rebounds a game, third
on the team in both depart
ments.
"There's no question it
(Ward's absence) will have
some effect." Dißiaso ad
mitted "He had displayed, par
ticularly early in the season,
that he was our best defensive
front-line player. He also pro
vided emotional leadership for
the team . . . This will force us
strategically to make changes
in our defense and offense. We'll
have to do things to take advan
tage of Jeff's (Ryan, Ward's re
placement in the starting line
up) strengths."
