### 
San Francisco (AP) — Frank
Robinson, former star out
fielder for the Baltimore Ori
oles and major league
baseball's first black manager,
met with San Francisco Giants
owner Bob Lurie for two hours
yesterday to discuss the Giants'
vacant manager's post.
After the meeting. Lurie said
Robinson "is anxious to become
a manager, he's in the running,
he's one of six people I am talk
ing to for the job. They're all in
first place, but I must say he is
an impressive fellow."
Lurie said he has several oth
er interviews on tap this week.
His decision will come at the
end of next week, he said.
Lurie said he would not neces
sarily stay within the organiza
tion for a manager to replace
Dave Bristol, fired last month

during baseball's winter meet
ing in Dallas. Bristol was the
fifth manager to lead the team
in seven seasons.
"I'm looking for the best
available person," Lurie said.
"My name has been tossed
around every time a managing

job opens up. but nothing ever
happens," Robinson, 45, said
earlier. He was fired in June
1977 after 2 1/ 2 years as the Cleve
land Indians' manager. He cur
rently is the Orioles' first-base
coach.
Robinson said that "natural
ly. I'd be interested in the job.

but I don't think I would take
just a one-vear thing."
Lurie, whose team finished in
fifth place in the National
League West last season with a
75-86 record, reportedly is con
sidering four other former ma
jor league managers for the
position .
