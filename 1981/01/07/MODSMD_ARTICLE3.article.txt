# Protest letter sent to Carter
## Faculty group opposes aid to El Salvador 
### Jiri Weiss 
The U.S. should stop sending military aid to El
Salvador and withdraw its military personnel from
there, according to an open letter to President Jim
my Carter.
The letter was signed by at least 90 Stanford facul
ty members, including Nobel Prize-winning chemist
Linus Pauling.
Distributed by the El Salvador Solidarity Com
mittee (ESSC), the letter is part of a nationwide
petition drive on college campuses.
The object is to attract the attention of" as large a
political spectrum of faculty as possible and make
them aware of the massacre of their own colleagues
in El Salvador," said Anon Hadar, a drive coordi
nator.
Hadar said he hopes the letter will influence Pres
ident-elect Ronald Reagan's policies toward the
U.S.-backed junta in El Salvador. The junta has
ruled the country since October, 1979.
Students, faculty slain
The open letter claims that 40 professors, 78 pri
mary and secondary school teachers and 390 stu
dents were killed in recent political violence. More
than 8000 people in total were killed last year, ac
cording to estimates made by the Manchester
Guardian.
The National University of El Salvador was at

tacked and occupied by the army and national guard
last June, leaving 50 dead. 100 arrested and millions
of dollars in estimated damage.
"President Carter's human rights policy has put a
break on the worst kind of human rights violations,
but Reagan's election has given a free hand to the
junta." said Jean Franco, chairman of the Spanish
and Portugese Department here. "El Salvador is in
a state of civil war."
U.S. policy critical
According to Mary Pratt, assistant professor of
Spanish and Portuguese here. U.S. policy will de
termine how much more killing will happen. "The
analogy with Nicaragua is very strong." said Pratt,
who also signed the open letter.
"The media has been misrepresenting the conflict
in a systematic way as a conflict between a Cuban
backed radical left and a radical right with the gov
ernment in the middle. The press tries to get people
to think that here is no such thing as popular revolt,"
Pratt said.
"Of course, the petition is only going to achieve
something in conjunction with other activities —
such as the recent refusal by the longshoremen's un
ion to load weapons shipments bound for El
Salvador." Pratt said.
Some of the letter's signatories fear the U.S.
might invade El Salvador. "After all. the U.S. did it

in Guatemala in 1953 and in the Dominican Republic
in the '605." Franco remarked.
Future moves
The U.S. Committee in Solidarity with the People
of El Salvador (CISPES), which organized the na
tional petition drive, is planning further political
moves. On January 16 it will hold a symposium at
UC-Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium. Partici
pants will include professors, foreign policy experts
and a representative of the Democratic Revolu
tionary Front (FDR). The FDR is the main opposi
tion party in El Salvador, said Hadar.
The symposium will be cosponsored by the ESSC
and a rally is planned for the following afternoon at
the Civic Center in San Francisco.
CISPES and ESSC are also getting help from Am
nesty International, the human rights organization.
Amnesty International has charged that since last
year — after most civilians in the government re
signed to protest human rights violations — "at
least 2000 Salvadoreans have been killed or 'disap
peared' while in the hands of conventional and aux
illiary security forces of EI Salvador."
The organization also claimed many were tor
tured and savagely mutilated — "arms lopped off,
flayed, beheaded."
