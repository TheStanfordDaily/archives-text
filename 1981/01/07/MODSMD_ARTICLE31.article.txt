# 'I hate to lose Wiggin says
## Cards feel blue as Green goes 
### Steve Odell 
Unlike many coaching
changes, Denny Green's ap
pointment to the head football
coach's post at Northwestern
was met with little surprise.
Previously Stanford's of
fensive coordinator, Green has
been regarded as one of the
brightest young football minds
in the nation, and it was highly
understandable that he should
be snatched up by a team that
has recorded only one football
victory over the last three
years.
Paul Wiggin, the Cardinals'
head coach, acknowledged that
the move was not a shock.
"He came here with that kind
of goal," Wiggin said. "We
knew he was the best and that's
why we made a real effort to get
him (when Wiggin hired him
from the San Francisco 49ers
last year). One of his ambitions
while he was here was to ex
press his abilities which would
open the door for a head job —
and he did."
Though Wiggin worked only
one year with Green, he made it

clear that the 31-year-old would
be missed.
"Denny had great command,
he was highly respected, and he
was also very well-liked That is
unusual, because usually you
have to sacrifice at least one of
those three in order to gain an
other," Wiggin said.
"I hate to lose him," Wiggin
added, "but I'm also excited for
him and glad that we lost him in
the way we did."
Dave Ottmar, the Cards' tight
end coach, reacted in a similar
manner when asked about the
loss of Green. "On the one hand,
I'm really sad to see him go. He
had an excellent grasp of the of
fense, and he really knew how to
utilize the big guns," Ottmar
said. "But by the same token,
this is a great opportunity for
him and I wish him the best of
luck. I would have liked to see
him stay, but that's life in the
coaching ranks."
Green will be missed for
much more than his extensive
storehouse of football knowl
edge, though. He related well to

the players, as sophomore half
back Vincent White testified
"He was a good friend, some
body who would mess around
with us There was a good close
ness between him and the
players — we could always go in
and talk to him," White said.
"But it was an opportunity that
was pretty hard to turn down,
and it was a good move for him.
On the other hand, I wish he
could have stayed here longer.
He was so effective in teaching
us."
Sophomore tight end Chris
Dressel echoed White. "He
(Green) got along with the
players really well, and I en
joyed being a friend to him. You
always knew where he was com
ing from.
"He is very deserving of the
job, that's for sure," Dressel
added.
The 1980 season was Green's
second tour of duty with Stan
ford. He had previously served
as running back coach under
Bill Walsh in 1977 and 1978, and
was instrumental in the recruit

ing of All-America halfback
Darrin Nelson.
In 1979, Walsh left Stanford
for the 49ers and hired Green to
coach San Francisco's re
ceivers and teams.
Green, the first black head
coach ever in the Big-10 Con
ference, will be succeeded by
Jim Fassel, who has coached
the Cardinal quarterbacks and
receivers the past two seasons.
Wiggin stressed that under
Fassel, the offense would be
based on the "same concepts"
to "maintain continuity" in the
offense.
At Stanford, Green had some
of the best talent in the nation to
build his offense around Now at
Northwestern, he is faced with a
gigantic rebuilding job to try
and turn around a disastrous
program.
"It'll be a real challenge for
him," Wiggin predicted, "but
he'll do a good job. He's a tire
less worker, and you'll see im
provement in that program.
We'll miss him here, though —
that's for sure."

knew he was the best and that's
why we made a real effort to get
him (when Wiggin hired him
from the San Francisco 49ers
last year). One of his ambitions
while he was here was to ex
press his abilities which would
open the door for a head job —
and he did."
Though Wiggin worked only
one year with Green, he made it

clear that the 31-year-old would
be missed.
"Denny had great command,
he was highly respected, and he
was also very well-liked That is
unusual, because usually you
have to sacrifice at least one of
those three in order to gain an
other," Wiggin said.
"I hate to lose him," Wiggin
added, "but I'm also excited for
him and glad that we lost him in
the way we did."
Dave Ottmar, the Cards' tight
end coach, reacted in a similar
manner when asked about the
loss of Green. "On the one hand,
I'm really sad to see him go. He
had an excellent grasp of the of
fense, and he really knew how to
utilize the big guns," Ottmar
said. "But by the same token,
this is a great opportunity for
him and I wish him the best of
luck. I would have liked to see
him stay, but that's life in the
coaching ranks."
Green will be missed for
much more than his extensive
storehouse of football knowl
edge, though. He related well to

the players, as sophomore half
back Vincent White testified
"He was a good friend, some
body who would mess around
with us There was a good close
ness between him and the
players — we could always go in
and talk to him," White said.
"But it was an opportunity that
was pretty hard to turn down,
and it was a good move for him.
On the other hand, I wish he
could have stayed here longer.
He was so effective in teaching
us."
Sophomore tight end Chris
Dressel echoed White. "He
(Green) got along with the
players really well, and I en
joyed being a friend to him. You
always knew where he was com
ing from.
"He is very deserving of the
job, that's for sure," Dressel
added.
The 1980 season was Green's
second tour of duty with Stan
ford. He had previously served
as running back coach under
Bill Walsh in 1977 and 1978, and
was instrumental in the recruit

ing of All-America halfback
Darrin Nelson.
In 1979, Walsh left Stanford
for the 49ers and hired Green to
coach San Francisco's re
ceivers and teams.
Green, the first black head
coach ever in the Big-10 Con
ference, will be succeeded by
Jim Fassel, who has coached
the Cardinal quarterbacks and
receivers the past two seasons.
Wiggin stressed that under
Fassel, the offense would be
based on the "same concepts"
to "maintain continuity" in the
offense.
At Stanford, Green had some
of the best talent in the nation to
build his offense around Now at
Northwestern, he is faced with a
gigantic rebuilding job to try
and turn around a disastrous
program.
"It'll be a real challenge for
him," Wiggin predicted, "but
he'll do a good job. He's a tire
less worker, and you'll see im
provement in that program.
We'll miss him here, though —
that's for sure."

Denny Green, shown giving instructions during last year's Big Game, will face a big challenge trying
to turn around Northwestern's football fortunes. An effective and popular coach at Stanford, Green
will be missed by those he worked with here.
Unlike many coaching
changes, Denny Green's ap
pointment to the head football
coach's post at Northwestern
was met with little surprise.
Previously Stanford's of
fensive coordinator, Green has
been regarded as one of the
brightest young football minds
in the nation, and it was highly
understandable that he should
be snatched up by a team that
has recorded only one football
victory over the last three
years.
Paul Wiggin, the Cardinals'
head coach, acknowledged that
the move was not a shock.
"He came here with that kind
of goal," Wiggin said. "We
knew he was the best and that's
why we made a real effort to get
him (when Wiggin hired him
from the San Francisco 49ers
last year). One of his ambitions
while he was here was to ex
press his abilities which would
