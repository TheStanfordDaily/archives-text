Lennon killer pleads insanity
New York — Mark David Chapman, ringed by armed
court officers in a heavily guarded courthouse, pleaded in
nocent yesterday to killing former Beatle John Lennon
His lawyer said Chapman won't deny the shooting but will
offer insanity as his defense.
Defense attorney Jonathan Marks acknowledged that
his client is mentally competent to stand trial.
"Not guilty." were the only words spoken bv the 25-
vear-old Chapman during a brief appearance before State
Supreme Court Justice Herbert Altman
The judge appointed two psychiatrists and a psy
chologist to examine the defendant, one of them a veteran
of the Son of Sam multiple murder case. Pretrial hearings

Ripper suspect charged
London — Police indicated yesterday they believe the
five-year reign of terror of the Yorkshire Ripper is over
after the indictment of a truck driver for one of the
slayings. But fear and tension has not vanished from Eng
land's northern cities.
Police chiefs sifted through a mountain of evidence on
the 13 killings blamed on the Ripper the day after 35-year
old Peter Sutcliffe was charged with last November 's gris
ly murder of Leeds University student Jaqueline Hill
They were careful not to state that Sutcliffe is the knife
wielding killer who mutilated his victims, all of them
women, and legal restrictions on the British press kept
news reports to a minimum.
But detectives said tire tracks found at the scene of
Hill's murder and witnesses' descriptions of the killer link
the murder to at least two other slayings and one non-fatal
attack attributed to the Ripper

Brown's staff named in plan
Sacramento — Development of a computerized list of
Gov. Jerry Brown's political supporters was part of a
much larger program to create a national constituency to
further Brown's political ambitions, according to a highly
confidential document obtained by The Los Angeles Times
The newspaper disclosed on Dec. 6 that Brown had em
ployed a special task force, consisting of about seven peo
ple. to compile extensive lists of political supporters at
state expense for eventual use on the governor's new state
leased computer mailing system
Following the Times story, the governor's office in
sisted that the lists were merely a part of Brown's effort to
improve his communications with Californians
However, a confidential Nov. 14th memo marked "eyes
only" for the head of the task force shows that the task
force and the computer system were elements of a master
plan that called for use of Brown's "entire staff" inputting
together a national political organization for the governor

other Soviet bloc countries, private farms in Poland pro
duce about three-fourths of its food

eral court and personally escorted three white girls to all
white Buckeye High School yesterday, refusing for a sec
ond day to bend to a federal judge's desegregation order

black Jones Street Junior High School, which is 15 miles
away in Alexandria, as part of a desegregation program
ordered by U.S. District Judge Nauman Scott.
State District Judge Richard Lee intervened after Gov.
Dave Treen. on the advice of the state attorney general,
withdrew the state troopers who had accompanied the
girls to class on Monday.

the federal judge barring state officials from interfering
in the case.
The girls had no comment for two dozen reporters
clustered at the entrance to Buckeye High
