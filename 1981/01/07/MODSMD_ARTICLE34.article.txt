# Economy braces for Chrysler failure
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
In the mid-19705, executives of
Haves-Albion Corp. began playing
a hunch that, somewhat to their
disappointment, is beginning to
pay off.
Hayes-Albion, a Michigan-based
manufacturer of metal castings,
exhaust pipes and other auto parts,
began cutting back the volume of
business that it did with Chrysler
Corp. out of fear that the auto
maker was headed down a long,
bumpy road.
"We were concerned about our
exposure and thought that in order,
to protect ourselves, we should be
trying to capture the business of
larger, stronger companies." said
Robert Negri. Hayes-Albion treas
urer. Chrysler now accounts for
only 8 percent of his company's
business, down from a peak of
nearly 20 percent at one time, he
added
Should Chrysler fail. Negri now
estimates that only about 150
Haves-Albion employees would be

laid off. less than half the number
that would have been affected a
few years ago
In a similar fashion, the entire
U.S. economy has been reducing its
"exposure" to a Chrysler failure,
getting ready for what has been
forecast as a financial earthquake.
Studies a year ago estimated that
as many as 400.000 jobs might be
lost should the auto company be
forced out of business. But many
analysts say that Chrysler's gradu
al contraction during 1980 —
through layoffs, plant closings and
production cutbacks — has reduced
the potential magnitude of a
bankruptcy, should one occur.
Nearly 1000 of the company's
5000 dealerships have closed since
the beginning of 1979. Almost half
of its factory work force of 100.000
has been laid off.
"For the nation as a whole, the
impact of a Chrysler failure would
not be a substantial one." said
Sandra Shaber. a senior economist
with Chase Econometrics, the eco

nomic forecasting arm of Chase
Manhattan Bank "It would not be
a national catastrophe." she said
But others disagree, noting that
the recession has weakened sever
al auto industry suppliers and the
entire national economy.
"The shutdown of Chrysler now
would probably be worse for the
economy than it would have been a
year ago. principally because one
has to worry more about the ripple
effects on suppliers losing what
Chrysler owes them." said Allen
Sinai, vice president and senior
economist at Data Resouces Inc., a
Cambridge. Mass.. economic con
sulting company. "More com
panies are stretched thin now than
a year ago and the loss of Chrysler
would do more than just throw
thousands of people out of work."
Chrysler's immediate future will
be decided in the next few weeks
when the Chrysler Loan Guarantee
Board weighs the company's ap
plication for another $400 million in
federal loan guarantees.
