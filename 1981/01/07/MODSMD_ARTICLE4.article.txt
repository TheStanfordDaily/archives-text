### Karen Halbo 
The Medical Center will begin con
struction of a new cardiovascular re
search building next year — its first
major building project since the cen
ter's establishment 30 years ago.
The new $14 million building will co
ordinate heart research presently
pursued within the University. It wiil
also provide space for academic and
research programs now in the
Cardiovascular Surgery and
Cardiology departments.
University officials announced
plans for the new building on Decem
ber 9. They said $9 million in grants,
gifts and pledges has already been
raised.
The 31.000 square foot building will
house laboratories for cardiovascular
specialists in radiology, pharma
cology, anesthesia, pediatrics, im
munology and pathology.
Planning for the building began af
ter the Max C. Fleischmann Founda

tion of Nevada provided a grant for $4
million. Since then, $5 million has
been donated by various foundations
and individuals. Once construction be
gins. the building will be named after
an individual who, according to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy,
donated a large gift to the project and
at present wishes to remain
anonymous.
After the plans were announced.
Kennedy praised Dr. Norman
Shumway. head of the cardiovascular
surgery department and Dr. Donald
Harrison, head of the cardiology de
partment. for their work in the heart
research field
"The Harrison and Shumway teams
have established international reputa
tions for excellence in teaching and re
search relating to cardiovascular dis
ease." Kennedy said.
Harrison's department has re
searched cardiac pharmacology (how
drugs affect the heart), and the use of
computers to detect, monitor or pre
vent heart diseases.
Shumway's department has ex
plored cardiovascular replacement —
using mechanical devices to replace
diseased areas and heart and lung
transplantation.
The new building, will provide
space for the academic and research
programs of the two departments and
help integrate existing research in
heart transplants and treatment of
cardiac arrhythmia (an abnormal
heartbeat often causing sudden
death), according to Dr. Lawrence
Crowley, vice president for medical
affairs.
Crowley said it will help provide a
more comprehensive attack on the
outstanding problems of
cardiovascular disease.
If all goes according to plan, the
building will be located directly north
east of and adjacent to the Stanford
University hospital. It will consist of
three levels: an underground animal
facility, a ground floor for laboratory
research space and an upper floor for
faculty and staff offices a library and
conference space.
The architect for the new research
center is the firm Mellmuth, Obata
and Kassabaum of St. Louis and San
Francisco.
