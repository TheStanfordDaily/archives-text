# Iran responds to latest hostage proposal
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — Iran yesterday re
layed a new set of questions about the
latest United States proposal on re
lease of the 52 hostages to Washington
through Algerian mediators, White
House press secretary Jody Powell
said last night.
State Department officials im
mediately went into an unusual late
night meeting to discuss the questions.
in a move that touched off intense
speculation here that Iran was pre
pared to take another step in the nego
tiations that began In early Novem
ber.
In Tehran yesterday, Iranian For
eign Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai
said on Iranian television that
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had au
thorized the government to accept un
specified guarantees by Algeria "to
solve our problem with the United
States," according to news agencies.
There was no elaboration of Rajai's
remarks after his meeting with Kho
meini, and no explanation of what he
meant by Algerian guarantees.
Officials in Washington said they
did not know the exact meaning of Ra

jai's comments and they refused to
disclose the substance of the questions
they had received. But there were in
dications that the questions dealt in
part with the amount of frozen Iranian
funds the United States was prepared
to turn over at the time of the hostage
release.
The latest American proposal, ac
cording to administration officials, in
cludes return to Iran of some $4.5
billion of their more than $8 billion in
frozen assets plus another 1.6 million
ounces of their gold.
In addition, the U.S. is prepared to
return the rest of the frozen assets
when the Iranians agree to participate
in a settlement commission that will
include binding arbitration of U.S.
corporate and individual claims
against the Tehran government
Tehran Radio said yesterday that
the head of the Iranian hostage nego
tiating commission, Behzad Nabavi,
would hold a news conference today —
normally considered a sign that some
new Iranian position is about to be an
nounced to the Iranian people.
In addition, the U.S. officials in
volved in the negotiations expect that

they will have to take to the Supreme
Court any agreement that requires
transfer of American claims against
Iran from U.S. courts to an interna
tional tribunal. That process alone,
sources said, would take at least two
weeks.
Some Washington officials cau
tioned late yesterday evening that the
early reports from Tehran may not
hold up.
News agencies also reported the fol
lowing from Tehran yesterday:
ABC reported last night that Iran
was willing to accept in principle the
new U.S. offer but the American of
ficials described that report as much
more positive than the situation war
rants.
CBS Radio, quoting highly placed
sources in Iran, reported late yester
day that the Iranian leader. Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, had told the Ira
nian prime minister's office that it
was "now all right to release" the
hostages
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
was quoted by the Associated Press
last night as saying that Khomeini's
statement "sounds positive. On the

other hand, there have been other ref
erences in Tehran to statements by
Iranians to the effect that guarantees
approved by the Algerians would be
sufficient. But we don't know what
those statements mean."
A team of United States officials
headed by Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher met at the State
Department in an unusual evening
session to formulate the answers to
the questions raised by Iran
This meeting coincided with news
reports, denied by members of the
U.S. policy-making team, that the Al
gerians had informed Washington that
Tehran "accepted in principle" the
most recent U.S. proposals.
Reporters and television teams de
scended on the State Department De
spite a paucity of reliable informa
tion. the speedup in diplomatic activi
ty and the welter of rumors created an
atmosphere of drama in Washington.

From the Daily wire services
Washington — Iran yesterday re
layed a new set of questions about the
latest United States proposal on re
lease of the 52 hostages to Washington
through Algerian mediators, White
House press secretary Jody Powell
said last night.
State Department officials im
mediately went into an unusual late
night meeting to discuss the questions.
in a move that touched off intense
speculation here that Iran was pre
pared to take another step in the nego
tiations that began In early Novem
ber.
In Tehran yesterday, Iranian For
eign Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai
said on Iranian television that
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had au
thorized the government to accept un
specified guarantees by Algeria "to
solve our problem with the United
States," according to news agencies.
There was no elaboration of Rajai's
remarks after his meeting with Kho
meini, and no explanation of what he
meant by Algerian guarantees.
Officials in Washington said they
did not know the exact meaning of Ra

jai's comments and they refused to
disclose the substance of the questions
they had received. But there were in
dications that the questions dealt in
part with the amount of frozen Iranian
funds the United States was prepared
to turn over at the time of the hostage
release.
The latest American proposal, ac
cording to administration officials, in
cludes return to Iran of some $4.5
billion of their more than $8 billion in
frozen assets plus another 1.6 million
ounces of their gold.
In addition, the U.S. is prepared to
return the rest of the frozen assets
when the Iranians agree to participate
in a settlement commission that will
include binding arbitration of U.S.
corporate and individual claims
against the Tehran government
Tehran Radio said yesterday that
the head of the Iranian hostage nego
tiating commission, Behzad Nabavi,
would hold a news conference today —
normally considered a sign that some
new Iranian position is about to be an
nounced to the Iranian people.
In addition, the U.S. officials in
volved in the negotiations expect that

they will have to take to the Supreme
Court any agreement that requires
transfer of American claims against
Iran from U.S. courts to an interna
tional tribunal. That process alone,
sources said, would take at least two
weeks.
Some Washington officials cau
tioned late yesterday evening that the
early reports from Tehran may not
hold up.
News agencies also reported the fol
lowing from Tehran yesterday:
ABC reported last night that Iran
was willing to accept in principle the
new U.S. offer but the American of
ficials described that report as much
more positive than the situation war
rants.
CBS Radio, quoting highly placed
sources in Iran, reported late yester
day that the Iranian leader. Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, had told the Ira
nian prime minister's office that it
was "now all right to release" the
hostages
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
was quoted by the Associated Press
last night as saying that Khomeini's
statement "sounds positive. On the

other hand, there have been other ref
erences in Tehran to statements by
Iranians to the effect that guarantees
approved by the Algerians would be
sufficient. But we don't know what
those statements mean."
A team of United States officials
headed by Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher met at the State
Department in an unusual evening
session to formulate the answers to
the questions raised by Iran
This meeting coincided with news
reports, denied by members of the
U.S. policy-making team, that the Al
gerians had informed Washington that
Tehran "accepted in principle" the
most recent U.S. proposals.
Reporters and television teams de
scended on the State Department De
spite a paucity of reliable informa
tion. the speedup in diplomatic activi
ty and the welter of rumors created an
atmosphere of drama in Washington.
