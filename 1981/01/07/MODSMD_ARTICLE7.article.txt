## Social Security taxes increase 
### Los Angeles Times 
American workers will take home less of
their pay starting this week when the biggest
Social Security tax increase in the program's
44-vear history takes effect.
the tax hike will take another $78 a year out
of the pay of a worker earning $15.000 annually,
bringing his total Social Security tax bill for
1981 to $997.50 The tax increase rises propor
tionally with income, with the maximum tax
increasing to $1975 from $1587 for workers
earning over $29,700 a year.
Employers, who have to match their work
er's Social Security contributions, will also pay
the increased tax and are expected to pass the
hike on to consumers in the form of higher
prices.
The higher tax, which will raise an extra $15
billion a year for the nation's struggling Social
Security program, was approved by Congress
three years ago as part of a package of similar
increases through 1990 designed to rescue the
fund from insolvency.
But higher-than-expected inflation and un
employment have caused a new drain on the
fund, and most experts don't think the added
revenues will be sufficient to finance the ex
pected increases in Social Security payments
over the next two years.
Recent audits of the fund have indicated that
its reserves will be depleted by 1983 unless Con
gress approves further Social Security tax in
creases or allows the program to be partially
funded out of the government's general reven
ues from income taxes.
Nearly one out of every six Americans gets a
Social Security check in the mail each month,
and most of those who don't get a check pay the
taxes that support the program. As a result,
proposed solutions to the financing problem
and other reforms have usually died in the
cross fire of criticism from recipients and tax
payers.
Both sides will get some new ammunition
Feb. 6. when President-elect Ronald Reagan
turns 70 and becomes eligible for a monthly So
cial Security check — despite his presidential
salary of $200,000 a year.
The increase that took effect Jan. 1 boosts
the Social Security tax rate to 6.65 percent
from 6 13 percent — an increase of 8.5 percent
in the withholding rate. Thus, the tax bite out of
$15,000 will go to $997.50fr0m $919.50. The max
imum salary subject to the tax also changes,
rising to $29,700 from $25,900. Under the cur
rent law. the tax rate is scheduled to be hiked
gradually to 7.65 percent by 1990. The max
imum income which can be taxed will increase
in step with wage hikes during that period.
Social Security taxes were first levied in
1937 at the rate of 1 percent of the first $3000 in

income. The rate remained the same for 13
years but beginning in 1950 it started to move
up every few years to keep revenues in line
with benefit payments to retired workers and
others. This year's maximum dollar increase
of $388 surpasses the previous largest increase
of $333 that took effect in 1979.
At the prodding of President Jimmy Carter,
Congress passed the tax increases in 1977 to
prevent the Social Security fund from going
broke and having to draw on general tax reven
ues to make the promised benefit payments.
But almost immediately, workers began com
plaining about the higher taxes, prompting an
unsuccessful effort in Congress to repeal the
increase. Many experts believe the lawmakers
will feel similar pressure in coming months as
they again wrestle with how to finance the ris
ing cost of the program.
"They don't have to do anything, as long as
Congress and the public are willing to pay the
bill," said Lester Thurow. an economist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In 1980, the fund paid out $123 .6 billion in old
age. survivors and disability benefits, or about
$4 billion more than it received in Social Secur
ity taxes. This pattern is expected to continue
in 1981, both because the recession has raised
unemployment, leaving fewer workers to pay
the taxes, and because inflation is pushing up
the cost of the program. Social Security
payments, which are tied to the consumer
price index, went up 14.3 percent in 1980 and a
similar increase is expected in 1981.
Among the suggested reforms are boosting
benefits at a slower rate than increases in the
consumer price index; increasing to 68 from 65
the age at which a retiree can obtain full bene
fits, and using general revenues to fund that
portion of Social Security payments going for
hospital care.
Rita Ricardo Campbell, an economist at the
Hoover Institution who headed the Reagan ad
ministration's Social Security transition task
force, doesn't believe the fund can remain sol
vent without basic reforms in the benefit pro
grams.
A task force report suggested that the prob
lem will worsen over the next 30 years as
Americans born in the "baby boom" years af
ter World War II reach retirement age. The re
port suggested raising the eligibility age for
Social Security payments, phasing out benefits
for surviving spouses and other reforms.
"Politically, any change in the benefits will
be very difficult to make," Campbell said.
"But nobody receiving a benefit currently or
within the next few years would receive less
than they are already getting."
