### 
New York (AP) — U.S. Rep.
Raymond Lederer, the only con
gressman accused in the
Abscam probe to win re-elec
tion. was being sworn in for a
third term today in Washington
as his trial was starting in
Brooklyn.
An aide said the Philadelphia
Democrat intended to be pres
ent on the House floor when
Speaker Thomas O'Neill admin
istered the oath of office shortly
after noon. Then Lederer
planned to fly to New York,
where jury selection was to be
gin in a federal courtroom.
Lederer is the sixth member
of the House to stand trial on
Abscam charges. Four others
have been convicted and the oth
er, Rep. Richard Kelly (R-

Fla.). is on trial in Washington.
Lederer, 42. is accused of ac
cepting a $50,000 bribe from un
dercover FBI agents posing as
representatives of Arab sheiks
who promised jobs and industry
for his congressional district in
return for his cooperation in im
migration matters. Lederer al
legedly took the money on Sept.
11.1979. at a hotel near Kennedy
International Airport.
Other officials convicted
He has pleaded innocent to
the charges of bribery, con
spiracy. accepting an unlawful
gratuity and interstate travel in
aid of a racketeering enterprise.
Bribery, the most serious
charge, carries a prison term of
up to 15 years.

The government claims
Lederer received $5000 of the
money with the remainder
divided among Camden, N.J.,
Mayor Angelo Errichetti; Phil
adelphia Councilman Louis
Johanson; Philadelphia lawyer
Howard Criden and another un
identified individual.
Criden. Johanson and Er
richetti were convicted in Au
gust of similar Abscam of
fenses. At that trial then-Rep.
Michael Myers (D-Pa.), also
was found guilty of Abscam of
fenses. Myers was expelled
from Congress and lost a re
election bid.
Double jeopardy
Errichetti, Johanson and
Criden are not on trial now, hav
ing appealed their convictions

and claiming any trial on
charges stemming from the
Lederer case would constitute
double jeopardy because the al
legations are similar to those of
which they convicted.
Lederer's trial is expected to
last about 2 to 3 weeks.
Sen. Harrison Williams (D-
N.J.), the only member of the
Senate indicted in the political
corruption investigation, is
scheduled to stand trial in
Brooklyn in February or March.
The other three represent
atives convicted of Abscam of
fenses — Frank Thompson (D-
N.J.), John Murphy (D-N.Y.),
and John Jenrette (D-S.C.) —
all lost re-election bids in No
vember. All are appealing their
convictions.
