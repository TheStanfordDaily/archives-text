# Senate examines Reagan nominees
## 
### 
Washington (AP) - Opening
day niceties out of the way, the
97th Congress is getting down to
the business of taking a close
look at the people Ronald Re
agan wants to run his adminis
tration.
Confirmation hearings in the
newly Republican-controlled
Senate were scheduled today for
Cabinet nominees Richard
Schweiker for the Department
of Health and Human Services.
Caspar Weinberger for De
fense, Malcolm Baldrige for
Commerce, John Block for Ag
riculture and Donald Regan for
Treasury.
Also, the House and Senate
were meeting jointly today to
carry out a constitutional re
quirement that they ratify Re
agan's victory bv certifying the
Electoral College vote results.
Most of today's confirmation
hearings were expected to be
marked by a lack of fireworks,
if not friendly questioning.
However, Block was likely to
be questioned closely about his
avowed opposition to the Soviet
grain embargo and to the food
stamp program, which is ad
ministered by the Agriculture
Department he hopes to head.
Hearings on Reagan's nomi
nation of Alexander Haig to be
secretary of state, his touchiest
appointment, are to begin Fri
day before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
Some Democrats have said
they want to examine Haig's
role as former President Rich
ard Nixon's chief of staff during
the days before Nixon was
forced from office because of
the Watergate scandals of the
early 19705.
But Sen. Sam Nunn of Geor
gia, a respected Democratic
member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, called
Monday for Haig's confirma
tion.
"For those who are insatiably

curious about the Nixon era and
Watergate, there are plenty of
books they can buy," Nunn said.
It was not clear how much
fuss would be stirred either by
Haig's connection to Watergate
or by his career as a four-star
Army general who headed the
military forces of the North At
lantic Treaty Organization.
Senate Minority Leader Rob
ert Byrd said he has detected no
concerted Democratic cam
paign to delay or kill the Haig
nomination.
Howard Baker, the new Sen
ate majority leader, said he ex
pects that the various Senate
committees will approve all of
Reagan's nominees by Jan. 20,
Inauguration Day, and that the
full Senate will confirm them
shortly afterward.
Baker said fast action on Re
agan's nominees would permit
Congress to go to work on the
new president's plan for the
economy, which the majority
leader said would be worked out
in advance with congressional
leaders and formally proposed
to Congress by early February.
The newly elected Congress'
first session Monday was
marked by good-humored cere
mony in the Republican-con
trolled Senate and some bitter
partisan quarreling in the
House.

On the House side, Rep.
Thomas O'Neill's re-election as
speaker on a party-line vote re
flected the continued Demo
cratic control of that chamber.
Taking note of the increasing
ly conservative tone of both
Houses. O'Neill said: "Being
elected every two years, we are
acutely aware of the desires of
the people. We intend to adapt to
the changed circumstances."
The GOP gained 33 seats in
last November's elections and
Republicans hope to take con
trol of the House in 1982.
Nonetheless, under O'Neill's
leadership, the Democrats beat
back an attempt by Republicans
on Monday to get more voting
power on two key committees,
Ways and Means, and Rules.
That prompted Rep. Henson
Moore (R-La.), to complain that
the Ways and Means Committee
was "being stacked by the same
people who were overwhelming
ly repudiated on Nov. 4" and
Rep. John Rousselot (R-Calif.),
to accuse Democrats of choking
off debate on the issue of giving
Republicans additional seats on
the two panels.
"It is a mistake to gag this
House and prevent it from
fulfilling the promises made in
the last election," Rousselot

said.
The Ways and Means panel,
which the Democrats dominate
23-12. will have jurisdiction over
Reagan's plans to propose a tax
cut and other economic meas
ures. The Rules Committee,
where Democrats prevail 11-5,
controls the speed and pro
cedures under which the new
president's legislative pro
posals would be considered in
the House.
Despite the squabbling in the
House, much of Monday's open
ing sessions on both sides of
Capitol Hill was devoted to
good-natured pomp and circum
stance.
Old, new and former mem
bers of the Senate shook hands
in a mood of general conviviali
ty among members of both po
litical parties.
Vice President Walter Mon
dale, carrying out one of his last
official acts before leaving of
fice, swore in 34 new and re
elected senators.
Among those sworn in were
Paula Hawkins (R-Fla), the
second woman member of the
Senate; Jeremiah Denton (R-
Ala ), a former prisoner of war
and retired Navy admiral: and
John East (R-N.C.), a polio vic
tim who took the oath in a wheel
chair.

the business of taking a close
look at the people Ronald Re
agan wants to run his adminis
tration.
Confirmation hearings in the
newly Republican-controlled
Senate were scheduled today for
Cabinet nominees Richard
Schweiker for the Department
of Health and Human Services.
Caspar Weinberger for De
fense, Malcolm Baldrige for
Commerce, John Block for Ag
riculture and Donald Regan for
Treasury.
Also, the House and Senate
were meeting jointly today to
carry out a constitutional re
quirement that they ratify Re
agan's victory bv certifying the
Electoral College vote results.
Most of today's confirmation
hearings were expected to be
marked by a lack of fireworks,
if not friendly questioning.
However, Block was likely to
be questioned closely about his
avowed opposition to the Soviet
grain embargo and to the food
stamp program, which is ad
ministered by the Agriculture
Department he hopes to head.
Hearings on Reagan's nomi
nation of Alexander Haig to be
secretary of state, his touchiest
appointment, are to begin Fri
day before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
Some Democrats have said
they want to examine Haig's
role as former President Rich
ard Nixon's chief of staff during
the days before Nixon was
forced from office because of
the Watergate scandals of the
early 19705.
But Sen. Sam Nunn of Geor
gia, a respected Democratic
member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, called
Monday for Haig's confirma
tion.
"For those who are insatiably

curious about the Nixon era and
Watergate, there are plenty of
books they can buy," Nunn said.
It was not clear how much
fuss would be stirred either by
Haig's connection to Watergate
or by his career as a four-star
Army general who headed the
military forces of the North At
lantic Treaty Organization.
Senate Minority Leader Rob
ert Byrd said he has detected no
concerted Democratic cam
paign to delay or kill the Haig
nomination.
Howard Baker, the new Sen
ate majority leader, said he ex
pects that the various Senate
committees will approve all of
Reagan's nominees by Jan. 20,
Inauguration Day, and that the
full Senate will confirm them
shortly afterward.
Baker said fast action on Re
agan's nominees would permit
Congress to go to work on the
new president's plan for the
economy, which the majority
leader said would be worked out
in advance with congressional
leaders and formally proposed
to Congress by early February.
The newly elected Congress'
first session Monday was
marked by good-humored cere
mony in the Republican-con
trolled Senate and some bitter
partisan quarreling in the
House.

On the House side, Rep.
Thomas O'Neill's re-election as
speaker on a party-line vote re
flected the continued Demo
cratic control of that chamber.
Taking note of the increasing
ly conservative tone of both
Houses. O'Neill said: "Being
elected every two years, we are
acutely aware of the desires of
the people. We intend to adapt to
the changed circumstances."
The GOP gained 33 seats in
last November's elections and
Republicans hope to take con
trol of the House in 1982.
Nonetheless, under O'Neill's
leadership, the Democrats beat
back an attempt by Republicans
on Monday to get more voting
power on two key committees,
Ways and Means, and Rules.
That prompted Rep. Henson
Moore (R-La.), to complain that
the Ways and Means Committee
was "being stacked by the same
people who were overwhelming
ly repudiated on Nov. 4" and
Rep. John Rousselot (R-Calif.),
to accuse Democrats of choking
off debate on the issue of giving
Republicans additional seats on
the two panels.
"It is a mistake to gag this
House and prevent it from
fulfilling the promises made in
the last election," Rousselot

said.
The Ways and Means panel,
which the Democrats dominate
23-12. will have jurisdiction over
Reagan's plans to propose a tax
cut and other economic meas
ures. The Rules Committee,
where Democrats prevail 11-5,
controls the speed and pro
cedures under which the new
president's legislative pro
posals would be considered in
the House.
Despite the squabbling in the
House, much of Monday's open
ing sessions on both sides of
Capitol Hill was devoted to
good-natured pomp and circum
stance.
Old, new and former mem
bers of the Senate shook hands
in a mood of general conviviali
ty among members of both po
litical parties.
Vice President Walter Mon
dale, carrying out one of his last
official acts before leaving of
fice, swore in 34 new and re
elected senators.
Among those sworn in were
Paula Hawkins (R-Fla), the
second woman member of the
Senate; Jeremiah Denton (R-
Ala ), a former prisoner of war
and retired Navy admiral: and
John East (R-N.C.), a polio vic
tim who took the oath in a wheel
chair.
