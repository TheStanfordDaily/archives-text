# Anti-draft rally well attended
## 
### Jan Mireles 
Opponents of the draft yesterday
urged those eligible for registration to
be "conscious of their decision."
Will Barnes, a 21-year old Stanford
student who refused to register, said
at the noon rally on White Plaza he
would not urge anyone to evade draft
registration, but at the same time he
himself "did not want to be part of the
extension of any government ideology
of extreme consumption."
Members of Stanford Against Con
scription, sponsor of the protest, and
others outspokenly opposed to man
datory registration called for an end to
the requirement and offered support
to resistors.
San Francisco Board of Supervisors
member Harry Britt echoed Barnes'
criticism of government ideology,
calling President Carter's move
toward registration "unnecessary and
stupid.
"The youth of our country is not
going to go to El Salvador and fight for
the priorities of the right," he said.
Britt, a member of the gay com
munity. met with some applause as he

referred to the draft as "the ultimate
perversion of all perversions.
"The draft is immoral and a prime
example of the same sexist mentality
that denies women free expression.
What we need is more creative ap
proach to foreign policy in responding
to problems," said Britt.
Father Daniel Berrigan, a Jesuit
priest, denounced nuclear weaponry
as an absurd march to oblivion. He is
facing charges in Pennsylvania for his
alleged role in destroying two re-entry
vehicle cones for the Mark 12 nuclear
warhead inside a General Electric
plant.
Maria Santos Ramos of the United
Farm Workers union added that
group's support for resistors of regis
tration. "We don't want the children
we've worked for to be drafted. Our
union and our people are against the
draft." she said, noting the long battle
farm workers have waged for their
children.
During his brief address, Barnes
told the crowd of about 400 "I have de
cided not to register and risk a jail sen
tence." Students applauded as he ex
plained his reasoning.

"Force which destroys humanity
cannot breed human rights," said
Barnes.
Though Barnes said he does not
want to go to jail, he realized the possi
bility. "It's a big issue, but the bottom
line is that you have to take a stand. I
don't want to go to jail. There are
many people who haven't registered,
so I don't think it's that much of a
risk," he said.
The speakers shared the opinion
that draft registration is not needed.
Britt called the mandate "a form of
slavery,"' and Berrigan warned
"there will be no earth if we grant it
place."
Students attending the rally carried
various signs bearing slogans like "no
blood for oil" and "register mail not
males."
Fred Cheever, a graduate student in
European History, said working at a
nuclear "think tank" convinced him
that war should be avoided. "When it
comes to an invasion versus total de
struction I'm against any military ac
tion. I'd rather have the invasion," he
said. "Basically I am a pragmatic
pacifist. I'm against killing any
thing."
Not all students at the rally had
clear convictions about the draft,
though. Joe Kennedy, a junior major
ing in history, said he doesn't like the
draft but registered anyway.
"If I were drafted I wouldn'trun. I'd
either go or go to jail." he said, adding
that his final decision would depend on
the reason for war.
"I wouldn't fight in any conflict sup
porting a Third World rightist regime,
but ultimately a government has the
right to call up citizens."

During his brief address, Barnes
told the crowd of about 400 "I have de
cided not to register and risk a jail sen
tence." Students applauded as he ex
plained his reasoning.

"Force which destroys humanity
cannot breed human rights," said
Barnes.
Though Barnes said he does not
want to go to jail, he realized the possi
bility. "It's a big issue, but the bottom
line is that you have to take a stand. I
don't want to go to jail. There are
many people who haven't registered,
so I don't think it's that much of a
risk," he said.
The speakers shared the opinion
that draft registration is not needed.
Britt called the mandate "a form of
slavery,"' and Berrigan warned
"there will be no earth if we grant it
place."
Students attending the rally carried
various signs bearing slogans like "no
blood for oil" and "register mail not
males."
Fred Cheever, a graduate student in
European History, said working at a
nuclear "think tank" convinced him
that war should be avoided. "When it
comes to an invasion versus total de
struction I'm against any military ac
tion. I'd rather have the invasion," he
said. "Basically I am a pragmatic
pacifist. I'm against killing any
thing."
Not all students at the rally had
clear convictions about the draft,
though. Joe Kennedy, a junior major
ing in history, said he doesn't like the
draft but registered anyway.
"If I were drafted I wouldn'trun. I'd
either go or go to jail." he said, adding
that his final decision would depend on
the reason for war.
"I wouldn't fight in any conflict sup
porting a Third World rightist regime,
but ultimately a government has the
right to call up citizens."
