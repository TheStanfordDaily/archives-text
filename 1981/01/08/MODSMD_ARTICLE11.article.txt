## Scott Richter Register for draft or pay the price 
### 
Julie Barnard is to be com
mended for her recent dis
cussion "Draft registration and
alternatives," (Daily, Jan. 5)
As she says, registration for the
draft is a major personal de
cision. with far-reaching politi
cal and social (and, I would add.
moral) effects. It deserves
much reflection.
Yet, I don't believe that
Barnard quite touches all the is
sues involved. Specifically, I
think that she overlooks at least
two important questions. One of
these has to do with the political
implications of failure to reg
ister; the other with the moral
implications.
Political implications
What of the political implica
tions? Bat-Hard writes: "In the
history of the U.S., we've never
had registration without a draft,
and we've never had a draft
without a war. In any apparent
national emergency, there have
always been more than enough
volunteers to satisfy military
needs."
This is a sad misreading of
history, if only because it im
plies that registration and the
draft somehow cause war.
Immediately following World
War 11, Admiral Thomas
Moorer was a member of a task
force assigned to study how the
Japanese arrived at the decision
to attack Pearl Harbor. He re
ported that "without exception,
beginning with Prime Minister
Konove and on through the mili
tary command structure, they
all said the same thing, i.e.,
'The Congress passed the draft
by only one vote; the Congress
refused to fortify Wake and
Guam islands, and the U.S.
Army was training with wooden
guns.' Consequently, the
Japanese told me, they were
confident that the United States
simply did not have the will and
determination to defend its in
terests."
Barnard states that failure to
register would inform the public
about sentiment toward the
draft. Indeed, it would inform
the world.
Those required to register

should weigh the reflections of
Moorer as they consider the
message that they will send to
the country. If they doubt the re
levance of these concerns, they
should weigh the ruthless ag
gression in recent years of the
Soviets and their proxies in
Angola, Ethiopia, Cambodia
and Afghanistan. And what now
of Poland? At what point will we
defend the interests of free
dom?
If direct ground war with the
Soviet Union should erupt, it is
clear that our ability to fight it
whenever and wherever neces
sary is our only hope for avoid
ing resort to nuclear weapons.
Registration and the draft may
not be the best way of redress
ing our current military decline.
But in light of the alternatives, I
believe it warrants no less than
stoic compliance by those called
to serve.
A fair draft — one not riddled
with exceptions and deferments
for the elite — is not so great a
price to pay for living in liberty.
This brings me to the moral
concerns with which I think
Barnard's column fails to deal.
She correctly notes that a cons
cientious objector (CO) must
have a " 'deeply held moral,
ethical or religious' objection to
war. killing or military action.''
But let us be clear. It is not pos
sible to obtain CO status with re
spect to particular wars. Objec
tion must be to all wars, without
exception.
I would not presume to dis
courage anyone who sincerely
holds such belief from pursuing
objector status. But Barnard's
implication that some might
pursue this as a way of evading
the draft leaves me deeply trou
bled. Such evasion demeans
those who sincerely do object.
More importantly, I wonder
how those succeeding in such
evasion could live with them
selves for the rest of their lives,
especially if they found their
friends dying in wars in which
they also should be fighting.
My primary concern, how
ever, is not with conscientious
objection. It is with those who

consider, as Barnard mentions,
"going underground," evading
registration and avoiding pun
ishment. It is also with those
who now weigh the decision, as
Barnard further suggests, in
terms of the likelihood of ever
paying the $10,000 fine or spend
ing five years in prison. These
people face the gravest moral
question.
Having lived 19 years
and looking forward to living
many more years in the pros
perity and freedom that this
country provides, do these peo
ple now not have some obliga
tion either to obey to law or the
accept the punishment? If the
one law be unjust, is not
payment of the penalty still due

for the protection given by all
the laws? Indeed, is this not for
most the truest test of moral ob
jection to registration and the
draft: whether one stands or one
runs?
I humbly submit that it is. I
submit that Socrates did not die
in vain making this very stand in
Athens so many centuries ago.
Rather, he died knowing that his
own act of moral principle
would do far more for the cause
of justice than would any at
tempt to avoid the punishment
that he did not deserve.
Those now called to register
should weigh Socrates' argu
ment as they make their own de
cision.

cal and social (and, I would add.
moral) effects. It deserves
much reflection.
Yet, I don't believe that
Barnard quite touches all the is
sues involved. Specifically, I
think that she overlooks at least
two important questions. One of
these has to do with the political
implications of failure to reg
ister; the other with the moral
implications.
Political implications
What of the political implica
tions? Bat-Hard writes: "In the
history of the U.S., we've never
had registration without a draft,
and we've never had a draft
without a war. In any apparent
national emergency, there have
always been more than enough
volunteers to satisfy military
needs."
This is a sad misreading of
history, if only because it im
plies that registration and the
draft somehow cause war.
Immediately following World
War 11, Admiral Thomas
Moorer was a member of a task
force assigned to study how the
Japanese arrived at the decision
to attack Pearl Harbor. He re
ported that "without exception,
beginning with Prime Minister
Konove and on through the mili
tary command structure, they
all said the same thing, i.e.,
'The Congress passed the draft
by only one vote; the Congress
refused to fortify Wake and
Guam islands, and the U.S.
Army was training with wooden
guns.' Consequently, the
Japanese told me, they were
confident that the United States
simply did not have the will and
determination to defend its in
terests."
Barnard states that failure to
register would inform the public
about sentiment toward the
draft. Indeed, it would inform
the world.
Those required to register

should weigh the reflections of
Moorer as they consider the
message that they will send to
the country. If they doubt the re
levance of these concerns, they
should weigh the ruthless ag
gression in recent years of the
Soviets and their proxies in
Angola, Ethiopia, Cambodia
and Afghanistan. And what now
of Poland? At what point will we
defend the interests of free
dom?
If direct ground war with the
Soviet Union should erupt, it is
clear that our ability to fight it
whenever and wherever neces
sary is our only hope for avoid
ing resort to nuclear weapons.
Registration and the draft may
not be the best way of redress
ing our current military decline.
But in light of the alternatives, I
believe it warrants no less than
stoic compliance by those called
to serve.
A fair draft — one not riddled
with exceptions and deferments
for the elite — is not so great a
price to pay for living in liberty.
This brings me to the moral
concerns with which I think
Barnard's column fails to deal.
She correctly notes that a cons
cientious objector (CO) must
have a " 'deeply held moral,
ethical or religious' objection to
war. killing or military action.''
But let us be clear. It is not pos
sible to obtain CO status with re
spect to particular wars. Objec
tion must be to all wars, without
exception.
I would not presume to dis
courage anyone who sincerely
holds such belief from pursuing
objector status. But Barnard's
implication that some might
pursue this as a way of evading
the draft leaves me deeply trou
bled. Such evasion demeans
those who sincerely do object.
More importantly, I wonder
how those succeeding in such
evasion could live with them
selves for the rest of their lives,
especially if they found their
friends dying in wars in which
they also should be fighting.
My primary concern, how
ever, is not with conscientious
objection. It is with those who

consider, as Barnard mentions,
"going underground," evading
registration and avoiding pun
ishment. It is also with those
who now weigh the decision, as
Barnard further suggests, in
terms of the likelihood of ever
paying the $10,000 fine or spend
ing five years in prison. These
people face the gravest moral
question.
Having lived 19 years
and looking forward to living
many more years in the pros
perity and freedom that this
country provides, do these peo
ple now not have some obliga
tion either to obey to law or the
accept the punishment? If the
one law be unjust, is not
payment of the penalty still due

for the protection given by all
the laws? Indeed, is this not for
most the truest test of moral ob
jection to registration and the
draft: whether one stands or one
runs?
I humbly submit that it is. I
submit that Socrates did not die
in vain making this very stand in
Athens so many centuries ago.
Rather, he died knowing that his
own act of moral principle
would do far more for the cause
of justice than would any at
tempt to avoid the punishment
that he did not deserve.
Those now called to register
should weigh Socrates' argu
ment as they make their own de
cision.
