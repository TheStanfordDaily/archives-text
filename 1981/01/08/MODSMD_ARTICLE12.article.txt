Code realistic
I would like to comment on
Akil Gupta's piece, "The honor
code, grades and doubts" (Dai
ly, Oct. 23).
According to Gupta, the honor
code binds you "by your honor to
limit the scope of your educa
tion. to dehumanize, and to al
ienate yourself." Surely this is
an overstatement. The honor
code isn't perfect, and the
gripes about its fallacies are
common, but to say that it de
humanizes the student and lim
its his education is a falsehood.
The honor code was estab
lished some 60 years ago
through student impetus to
create a community of trust, not
an atmosphere of distrust de
rived from the need to have all
our actions monitored.
In Gupta's opinion, competi
tion between individuals causes
alienation. I tend to agree with
this point, but I cannot agree
that the honor code has anything
to do with competition. Com
petition occurs when individ
uals eager to advance them
selves strive to achieve more
than their peers in terms of any
thing from grades to social pres

tige.
Competition is more of a re
sult of human nature than of
anything like the honor code. A
similar honor systtni is nonexis
tent at other institutions such as
M.I.T. and Harvard, which are
as competitive (if not more)
than Stanford. Furthermore,
there is no honor code outside of
college, but competition is very
much alive.
Nor does the honor code pre
clude group learning. What it
does preclude is submitting
work done with others to be
graded as an individual effort.
Whether or not the course work
is to be done as a group effort is
solely up to the instructor. In
deed, learning to work in groups
could be an invaluable part of
higher education and a prere
quisite for success in today's so
ciety.
There can be no denying that
grades play an integral role in a
student's life and possibly even
in determining one's future, but
it seems hardly fair to blame the
existence of grades on the ex
istence of the Stanford honor
code. The part that the honor
code does play is that it legit
imizes grades; it adds credibili
ty to a grading system we are
unfortunately committed to.

One can hardly expect that by
abolishing the honor code, the
imperfections of the grading
system will be remedied. The
honor code is the only"rule"
that Stanford requires its stu
dents obey. In a very simplified
form, it says two things that
govern the behavior of students:
1) That students will not give or
receive unpermitted aid in ex
aminations or in any assign
ments used as a basis for grad
ing;
2) That they will do their share
and take an active part in seeing
to it that others as well as them
selves uphold the spirit and let
ter of the honor code.
The honor code is meant to re
move constraints, not create
them. It is meant to give value
to those achievements that
would otherwise be less mean
ingful if they were gained in an
atmosphere of distrust. In
short, the honor code seeks to
humanize us and to prepare us
realistically for the complex so
ciety that we face â€” the "out
side world" where there will be
no proctoring of our pro
fessional ethics.
