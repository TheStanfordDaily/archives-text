## New Wave meets the New Year 
### 
Something about aging over
night has never worked for me
No matter how much it still
looked like 1980, I could sense
that within a few hours civ
ilization and reality as we know
it would be older. At the stroke
of twelve, a cosmic force de
scends on all things earthbound
and politely ages them.
Having categorically failed in
years past to avert the subtle
change by holding my breath at
midnight, I swore that this time
I'd participate in, and even en
courage, the catharsis. Physics
teaches us that energies of this
sort progress in little packets,
or quanta. Because of these
quantum leaps, it can seem like
1980 and in the blink of a neuron
become 1981. It was this
nanosecond that I would ride to
glory.
Priming the consciousness
for this kind of hypersensitivity
could have proved a problem
had Carlos not shown up with
enough LSD to kill most of Santa
Clara. We arrived in San Fran
cisco sometime between the
acid taking effect and Carlos in
sisting we do more. Stumbling
up and down Broadway, we felt
that sense of a city happily
grown out of the '60s and into the
'80s. Sure, City Lights Books is
still there, but they sell Sid Vi
cious' memoirs now.
"See the Chinese people" said
Carlos. "Very progressive cul
ture. Sense stuff before it hap
pens. They adapt well."
Much of the rest of the street
had gone to some lengths to
punk out; lots of re-sold Salva
tion Army gear from New Wave
boutiques, and an assortment of
red, green and purple streaked
Mohawks, skinheads and crew
cuts at $65 a head which includes
your New Wave stylist's auto
graph in his own blood on your
forehead.
But those Chinese women just
turn the old collar up, put on
straight leg pants and blow
Devo right off the stage. A well
placed comb in the hair and
toothpick spike heels . . . these
women don't mess around. It's
either the LSD or all the oriental
women are very strong. But just
under the first layer, just behind
the eyes, the>'re sensitive and
very fragile. They all look like
Yoko Ono to me. This city

breathes survival.
As I open my mouth to tell
Carlos my Ono sensitivity per
ception, he throws a bit more
acid in and pulls me down some
side street in hot pursuit of two
single women sporting a split of
champagne Never one to scoff
at single women packing their
own champagne, I find myself
inside Gino and Carlos' Cafe,
and securing glasses from the
barkeep. offer to pour and toast
properly.
Susi clutches the bottle; she
has just escaped from the pages
of Fitzgerald novel, and has the
fur. confetti and stupid laugh to
prove it. Benny, her more con
templative cohort, is apparent
ly trying to glean just what
place we have in her universe at
this moment, when Susi lets out
a wail having something to do
with her brother being in jail.
Ah . . . yeah. Drag. But she's se
riously upset by all this, and
Benny's attention is slipping
away from my Quantum New
Year theory to the performance
Susi is giving the bar.
"I don't care it's my brother
man my brother in jail. Maybe if
I get thrown in I can at least see
him ..." Susi needs to pack in
all the theatre that the Chinese
girls keep well hidden behind
the too brown eyes and the
toothpick heels. Benny is now
well on her quest... at all costs
protect Susi. Absorb it all. All
the danger, pain and potential
pain.
It takes about 15 minutes for
Carlos and me to get exclusively
involved in their destinies, and
feel desperation in Susi's cries
and shots of J&B. to feel Ben
ny's soft psychic hands pet and
comfort her. Carlos being the
more compassionate of us, and
Susi still clutching the cham
pagne, he follows her through a
maze of side streets and tav
erns, sometimes as audience,
sometimes as actor in her very
absurd scenes. Benny and I
wander half looking for them,
half wandering insanely
through North Beach.
"Susi, she's so crazy, I mean
she's beautiful, but she's so
fucked up. I mean like the last

time I saw my mother four
years ago, her and Susi got ar
rested for shoplifting man. With
my mother. I mean man, I
known her for a long time man."
With the unity and closeness
Benny is expressing right now,
no harm could come to Susi,
even with Carlos. Susi is just
asking for love in a strange lan
guage; Benny is listening too
hard to hear. One doesn't fall
without the other as a cushion.
Regardless, Benny is getting
nervous. A little more frantic,
more filled with the purpose of
our quest, we zig-zag through
new wavers and old wavers, the
confetti and streamers and sing
ing horns and smashing bottles,
still dancing lightly over the mo
ments, not wanting to miss the
cosmologically synchronized
flash when it all changes.
"That stupid bitch. Why does
she have to get this way? Her
brother is the only family she
got, but he's safer in jail any
way. I could kill her."
"Be cool Benny, calm down.
You're not her mother."
Stop. Turn. Stare. "I know I
ain2 her mother. I'm her fuck
ingfriend."
A moment that lasted an
eternity later I see them, Carlos
and Susi stumbling happily
along Broadway lacing the
crowd with Susi's streamers
and laughing in that awful voice.
"I'm gonna kill her," as Ben
ny runs to hug her and cuss the
woman out. "I was worried,
where you been?" 'Whatsit
matter? My brother .. .' "I
know, in jail. Susi . . . some
times you're so stupid . . ."
"You still love me?" "C'mon
I'll take you home. To my place.
It's closer."
It hit. The only lock is sur
vival and the only key is sur
vival. Friendship is survival,
love is survival and this city is
survival. As Susi and Benny
wandered up Lombard St.,
Carlos handed me the bottle of
champagne and we toasted all
the surviving Yokos on the
street. It's 1981. We'll survive.

ing horns and smashing bottles,
still dancing lightly over the mo
ments, not wanting to miss the
cosmologically synchronized
flash when it all changes.
"That stupid bitch. Why does
she have to get this way? Her
brother is the only family she
got, but he's safer in jail any
way. I could kill her."
"Be cool Benny, calm down.
You're not her mother."
Stop. Turn. Stare. "I know I
ain2 her mother. I'm her fuck
ingfriend."
A moment that lasted an
eternity later I see them, Carlos
and Susi stumbling happily
along Broadway lacing the
crowd with Susi's streamers
and laughing in that awful voice.
"I'm gonna kill her," as Ben
ny runs to hug her and cuss the
woman out. "I was worried,
where you been?" 'Whatsit
matter? My brother .. .' "I
know, in jail. Susi . . . some
times you're so stupid . . ."
"You still love me?" "C'mon
I'll take you home. To my place.
It's closer."
It hit. The only lock is sur
vival and the only key is sur
vival. Friendship is survival,
love is survival and this city is
survival. As Susi and Benny
wandered up Lombard St.,
Carlos handed me the bottle of
champagne and we toasted all
the surviving Yokos on the
street. It's 1981. We'll survive.

Something about aging over
night has never worked for me
No matter how much it still
looked like 1980, I could sense
that within a few hours civ
ilization and reality as we know
it would be older. At the stroke
of twelve, a cosmic force de
scends on all things earthbound
and politely ages them.
Having categorically failed in
years past to avert the subtle
change by holding my breath at
midnight, I swore that this time
I'd participate in, and even en
courage, the catharsis. Physics
teaches us that energies of this
sort progress in little packets,
or quanta. Because of these
quantum leaps, it can seem like
1980 and in the blink of a neuron
become 1981. It was this
nanosecond that I would ride to
glory.
Priming the consciousness
for this kind of hypersensitivity
could have proved a problem
had Carlos not shown up with
enough LSD to kill most of Santa
Clara. We arrived in San Fran
cisco sometime between the
acid taking effect and Carlos in
sisting we do more. Stumbling
up and down Broadway, we felt
that sense of a city happily
grown out of the '60s and into the
'80s. Sure, City Lights Books is
still there, but they sell Sid Vi
cious' memoirs now.
"See the Chinese people" said
Carlos. "Very progressive cul
ture. Sense stuff before it hap
pens. They adapt well."
Much of the rest of the street
had gone to some lengths to
punk out; lots of re-sold Salva
tion Army gear from New Wave
boutiques, and an assortment of
red, green and purple streaked
Mohawks, skinheads and crew
cuts at $65 a head which includes
your New Wave stylist's auto
graph in his own blood on your
forehead.
But those Chinese women just
turn the old collar up, put on
straight leg pants and blow
Devo right off the stage. A well
placed comb in the hair and
toothpick spike heels . . . these
women don't mess around. It's
either the LSD or all the oriental
women are very strong. But just
under the first layer, just behind
the eyes, the>'re sensitive and
very fragile. They all look like
Yoko Ono to me. This city

breathes survival.
As I open my mouth to tell
Carlos my Ono sensitivity per
ception, he throws a bit more
acid in and pulls me down some
side street in hot pursuit of two
single women sporting a split of
champagne Never one to scoff
at single women packing their
own champagne, I find myself
inside Gino and Carlos' Cafe,
and securing glasses from the
barkeep. offer to pour and toast
properly.
Susi clutches the bottle; she
has just escaped from the pages
of Fitzgerald novel, and has the
fur. confetti and stupid laugh to
prove it. Benny, her more con
templative cohort, is apparent
ly trying to glean just what
place we have in her universe at
this moment, when Susi lets out
a wail having something to do
with her brother being in jail.
Ah . . . yeah. Drag. But she's se
riously upset by all this, and
Benny's attention is slipping
away from my Quantum New
Year theory to the performance
Susi is giving the bar.
"I don't care it's my brother
man my brother in jail. Maybe if
I get thrown in I can at least see
him ..." Susi needs to pack in
all the theatre that the Chinese
girls keep well hidden behind
the too brown eyes and the
toothpick heels. Benny is now
well on her quest... at all costs
protect Susi. Absorb it all. All
the danger, pain and potential
pain.
It takes about 15 minutes for
Carlos and me to get exclusively
involved in their destinies, and
feel desperation in Susi's cries
and shots of J&B. to feel Ben
ny's soft psychic hands pet and
comfort her. Carlos being the
more compassionate of us, and
Susi still clutching the cham
pagne, he follows her through a
maze of side streets and tav
erns, sometimes as audience,
sometimes as actor in her very
absurd scenes. Benny and I
wander half looking for them,
half wandering insanely
through North Beach.
"Susi, she's so crazy, I mean
she's beautiful, but she's so
fucked up. I mean like the last

time I saw my mother four
years ago, her and Susi got ar
rested for shoplifting man. With
my mother. I mean man, I
known her for a long time man."
With the unity and closeness
Benny is expressing right now,
no harm could come to Susi,
even with Carlos. Susi is just
asking for love in a strange lan
guage; Benny is listening too
hard to hear. One doesn't fall
without the other as a cushion.
Regardless, Benny is getting
nervous. A little more frantic,
more filled with the purpose of
our quest, we zig-zag through
new wavers and old wavers, the
confetti and streamers and sing
ing horns and smashing bottles,
still dancing lightly over the mo
ments, not wanting to miss the
cosmologically synchronized
flash when it all changes.
