## 'Popeye' fascinating, frustrating, and full of contradictions 
### Jim Mattson 
Popeye might be the year's
most frustrating movie. It has
enough very, very good things in
it to make a couple of nice mov
ies or one great one. But, some
thing's gone awry — like Jello
that's been left on the counter
overnight. Popeye just doesn't
hang together. It's not a terrible
movie, merely a sloppy one.
The movie's title credits
promise much. The director is
Robert Altman. the idiosyn
cratic creator of such triumphs
as M*A *S*H and McCabe and
Mrs. Miller and of such dis
asters as Quintet. He seemed
like a good choice for bringing
the squinky-eyed orphink sailor
to the screen: they share some
thing of the same grumbly vi
sion of an inherently cock-eyed
world.
The second creative force in
volved in Popeye is
screenwriter Jules Feiffer, a
professional misanthrope
whose efforts outside of mov
iedom include a syndicated car
toon strip and several bleakly
funny plays. Hiring him to do
the screenplay for Popeye was a
curious choice, and his product
is a curious one.
It seems to me that a
screenwriter has two options in

transforming cartoon charac
ters into human ones: you either
humanize (and, often, sen
timentalize) the surreal quirks
of the cartoon, or you flatten out
and exaggerate the human char
acters until they take on ap
propriately inhuman character
istics. Feiffer. apparently with
Altman's blessings, has taken
the latter tack.
It's an interesting idea, but
somewhere, things go wrong.
Popeye's characters are car
toonish; when they get beaten
up. they bounce. The trouble is.
for all the care that has been
taken with makeup and cos
tumes (both of which have been
designed with wit and a sharp
eye on the most popular cartoon
fashions), the people under
neath still look like people.
When they get beaten up. it's
Hard not to cringe a little.
It's probable that Altman and
Feiffer never really intended us
to warm to these characters; af
ter all. when we watch a cartoon
we seldom really empathize
with what we see on the screen.
I guess that leaves us with snap
py dialogue and fast action —
neither of which, sadly enough,
is present in Popeye to any great
degree.
Altman is a master of over

lapping dialogue, where we're
meant to catch only bits — the
crucial ones — of what's being
said. He employs the technique
here, serving mainly to dilute
Feiffer's dialogue (I assume it's
Feiffer's dialogue, though,
knowing how Altman has
worked in the past, there's a
chance that a good part of it was
ad-libbed on the set) and to mud
dy any sprightliness it might
once have had.
One character (Olive Oyl's
father. Coal) recites "you owe
me an apology" until we feel
that we deserve one. too , anoth
er character, a tax collector,
stretches a thin joke about taxes
until there's nothing left at all.
Arch-villain Bluto is given
almost no lines; instead, he
grunts — and two grunts are not
necessarily funnier than one.
At the beginning of this re
view, I said that Popeye
possesses some very good
things, and they're there, sure
enough, buried beneath this
rickety framework The per
formances. for example, could
scarcely be better — it's as if
the actors, squeezed in by the
script, do their very best to
work their way out of it with
sheer talent.

Robin Williams plays
Popeve. His hair has been
cropped close and dved blond;
one eye. true to character, re
mains perpetually shut; and he
has been fitted with bulging
forearms that look like hairy
loaves of French bread But,
though he looks terrific, he isn't
given all that much to do; if he's
the hero of the movie, he's an
oddly passive one
Popeve mumbles to himself a
lot. which is sometimes funny
but most often tedious. When he
isn't mumbling, he's usually
whining about his troubles,
which is worse. Williams does it
all gamely enough, but he only
begins to seem to be having a
good time when Popeve finally
becomes more active. The car
toon character was a little
rooster of a man. always ready
to crow or fight. Williams
seems to sense this, and when
given a chance, he struts and
crows with the best of them. At
the movie's end, he does somer
saults and dances a little jig. All
this was probably in the script,
but the moment's energy and
joy belong to Williams alone.
Shelley Duvall plays Olive
Ovl. This seems to be the role
she was born to play, and she's

wonderful. Duvall. too. has been
altered by the makeup depart
ment. but not as much work was
required as was required with
Williams. Her hair has been
styled to make it look as though
she's topped by a frying pan
with earrings. She's even paler
than usual, so her face becomes
a great round moon against the
sky.
But the face, and pipestem
body, and screechy voice are all
part of Duvall's standard equip
ment. She exaggerates them,
surely: her movements become
an orchestrated series of
birdlike twitches and cowish
glides. The movie's funniest
scene is the one where
Swee'pea, left in a basket, is dis
covered. Olive is certain that
the noise of the baby's rattle is a

rattlesnake, and she literally
climbs the walls (or, in this
case, the pier) in her flight to
safety.
Swee'pea, played by
Altman's grandson, is a cute
kid. and he gives the movie
some needed warmth whenever
he's on-screen. (Interestingly,
if I remember correctly, the
Swee'pea of the cartoon was a
cynical little bastard; I guess
it's hard to make a real, non
cartoon baby look shrewd.) And
at least the foundling doesn't
have to sing any of Harry
Nilsson's music, which is based
on the premise that one song
should sound pretty much like
every other.
The movie's verv fine to look
at, and the sets are as effective
as the makeup. Olive's home

town of Sweethaven has been
built against a cliff, so it seems
as if the village is always ready
to tumble, with its inhabitants,
into the sea. Altman plays with
the ability of the cartoon to
make objects reflect subjective
states; when Bluto sees red, the
reaction shot shows that the set
and costumes have, indeed,
turned red.
It's difficult to know what to
make of all this: in Popeye, the
good and the not-good are
wedded irrevocably. This un
natural marriage between
seeming opposites is what
makes Popeye not a good movie,
(nor even an especially enter
taining one), but one that is
fascinating for its contradic
tions.

here, serving mainly to dilute
Feiffer's dialogue (I assume it's
Feiffer's dialogue, though,
knowing how Altman has
worked in the past, there's a
chance that a good part of it was
ad-libbed on the set) and to mud
dy any sprightliness it might
once have had.

At the beginning of this re
view, I said that Popeye
possesses some very good
things, and they're there, sure
enough, buried beneath this
rickety framework The per
formances. for example, could
scarcely be better — it's as if
the actors, squeezed in by the
script, do their very best to
work their way out of it with
sheer talent.

Robin Williams plays
Popeve. His hair has been
cropped close and dved blond;
one eye. true to character, re
mains perpetually shut; and he
has been fitted with bulging
forearms that look like hairy
loaves of French bread But,
though he looks terrific, he isn't
given all that much to do; if he's
the hero of the movie, he's an
oddly passive one
Popeve mumbles to himself a
lot. which is sometimes funny
but most often tedious. When he
isn't mumbling, he's usually
whining about his troubles,
which is worse. Williams does it
all gamely enough, but he only
begins to seem to be having a
good time when Popeve finally
becomes more active. The car
toon character was a little
rooster of a man. always ready
to crow or fight. Williams
seems to sense this, and when
given a chance, he struts and
crows with the best of them. At
the movie's end, he does somer
saults and dances a little jig. All
this was probably in the script,
but the moment's energy and
joy belong to Williams alone.
Shelley Duvall plays Olive
Ovl. This seems to be the role
she was born to play, and she's

wonderful. Duvall. too. has been
altered by the makeup depart
ment. but not as much work was
required as was required with
Williams. Her hair has been
styled to make it look as though
she's topped by a frying pan
with earrings. She's even paler
than usual, so her face becomes
a great round moon against the
sky.
But the face, and pipestem
body, and screechy voice are all
part of Duvall's standard equip
ment. She exaggerates them,
surely: her movements become
an orchestrated series of
birdlike twitches and cowish
glides. The movie's funniest
scene is the one where
Swee'pea, left in a basket, is dis
covered. Olive is certain that
the noise of the baby's rattle is a

rattlesnake, and she literally
climbs the walls (or, in this
case, the pier) in her flight to
safety.
Swee'pea, played by
Altman's grandson, is a cute
kid. and he gives the movie
some needed warmth whenever
he's on-screen. (Interestingly,
if I remember correctly, the
Swee'pea of the cartoon was a
cynical little bastard; I guess
it's hard to make a real, non
cartoon baby look shrewd.) And
at least the foundling doesn't
have to sing any of Harry
Nilsson's music, which is based
on the premise that one song
should sound pretty much like
every other.
The movie's verv fine to look
at, and the sets are as effective
as the makeup. Olive's home

town of Sweethaven has been
built against a cliff, so it seems
as if the village is always ready
to tumble, with its inhabitants,
into the sea. Altman plays with
the ability of the cartoon to
make objects reflect subjective
states; when Bluto sees red, the
reaction shot shows that the set
and costumes have, indeed,
turned red.
It's difficult to know what to
make of all this: in Popeye, the
good and the not-good are
wedded irrevocably. This un
natural marriage between
seeming opposites is what
makes Popeye not a good movie,
(nor even an especially enter
taining one), but one that is
fascinating for its contradic
tions.
Popeye might be the year's
most frustrating movie. It has
enough very, very good things in
it to make a couple of nice mov
ies or one great one. But, some
thing's gone awry — like Jello
that's been left on the counter
overnight. Popeye just doesn't
hang together. It's not a terrible
movie, merely a sloppy one.
The movie's title credits
promise much. The director is
Robert Altman. the idiosyn
cratic creator of such triumphs
as M*A *S*H and McCabe and
Mrs. Miller and of such dis
asters as Quintet. He seemed
like a good choice for bringing
the squinky-eyed orphink sailor
to the screen: they share some
thing of the same grumbly vi
sion of an inherently cock-eyed
world.
The second creative force in
volved in Popeye is
screenwriter Jules Feiffer, a
professional misanthrope
whose efforts outside of mov
iedom include a syndicated car
toon strip and several bleakly
funny plays. Hiring him to do
the screenplay for Popeye was a
curious choice, and his product
is a curious one.
It seems to me that a
screenwriter has two options in

transforming cartoon charac
ters into human ones: you either
humanize (and, often, sen
timentalize) the surreal quirks
of the cartoon, or you flatten out
and exaggerate the human char
acters until they take on ap
propriately inhuman character
istics. Feiffer. apparently with
Altman's blessings, has taken
the latter tack.
It's an interesting idea, but
somewhere, things go wrong.
Popeye's characters are car
toonish; when they get beaten
up. they bounce. The trouble is.
for all the care that has been
taken with makeup and cos
tumes (both of which have been
designed with wit and a sharp
eye on the most popular cartoon
fashions), the people under
neath still look like people.
When they get beaten up. it's
Hard not to cringe a little.
It's probable that Altman and
Feiffer never really intended us
to warm to these characters; af
ter all. when we watch a cartoon
we seldom really empathize
with what we see on the screen.
I guess that leaves us with snap
py dialogue and fast action —
neither of which, sadly enough,
is present in Popeye to any great
degree.

with earrings. She's even paler
than usual, so her face becomes
a great round moon against the
sky.
But the face, and pipestem
body, and screechy voice are all
part of Duvall's standard equip
ment. She exaggerates them,
surely: her movements become
an orchestrated series of
birdlike twitches and cowish
glides. The movie's funniest
scene is the one where
Swee'pea, left in a basket, is dis
covered. Olive is certain that
the noise of the baby's rattle is a

rattlesnake, and she literally
climbs the walls (or, in this
case, the pier) in her flight to
safety.
Swee'pea, played by
Altman's grandson, is a cute
kid. and he gives the movie
some needed warmth whenever
he's on-screen. (Interestingly,
if I remember correctly, the
Swee'pea of the cartoon was a
cynical little bastard; I guess
it's hard to make a real, non
cartoon baby look shrewd.) And
at least the foundling doesn't
have to sing any of Harry
Nilsson's music, which is based
on the premise that one song
should sound pretty much like
every other.
The movie's verv fine to look
at, and the sets are as effective
as the makeup. Olive's home

town of Sweethaven has been
built against a cliff, so it seems
as if the village is always ready
to tumble, with its inhabitants,
into the sea. Altman plays with
the ability of the cartoon to
make objects reflect subjective
states; when Bluto sees red, the
reaction shot shows that the set
and costumes have, indeed,
turned red.
It's difficult to know what to
make of all this: in Popeye, the
good and the not-good are
wedded irrevocably. This un
natural marriage between
seeming opposites is what
makes Popeye not a good movie,
(nor even an especially enter
taining one), but one that is
fascinating for its contradic
tions.
