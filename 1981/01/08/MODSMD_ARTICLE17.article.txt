# The 						mirror cracks, slowly

A friend of mine who is an Agatha Christie ad
mirer recently remarked that he didn't see any
point in filming her novels unless a means could
be found of simulating her technique of building
suspense and uncovering the solution to a mys
tery.
I'm not sure that is possible. Christie always
withheld pertinent information from her readers
until the very end — which is why no one ever
guesses the killer's identity in her books and why
some people complain that she is basically unfair;
translated to the screen, this exclusion of the au
dience amounts to deprivation, and the business of
last-minute revelations delivered in a lengthy
harangue by a detective (Hercule Poirot or Jane
Marple) is lethal, dramatically. In Murder on the
()rient Express the conclusion took up the whole
second half of the movie: the train stalled in the
snow and the movie ground to an appropriate halt.
Death on the Nile was somewhat livelier — there
were several murders — but The Mirror Crack'd,
the latest Christie picture, never gets going.
The movie begins with a screening of an antique
drawing-room mystery (meant to be a parody, but
it is broad and sloppy) for the citizens of a small
English village. The print tears just as the detec
tive is about to unmask the culprit, and when the
lights go up on the disappointed audience. Miss
Marple (Angela Lansbury) is among them and she
solves the mystery for them. This tamely humor
ous conceit is a fair example of what is to come: a
great deal of explication of what amounts to very
little action.
The cast of characters derives mainly from a
company filming Mary, Queen of Scots on loca
tion in the village, but the Hollywood types and the
snatches of second-rate bitchy repartee between
the two leading actresses (Elizabeth Taylor and
Kim Novak) are really just dressing. The movie is
about how Miss Marple and her nephew Dermot
(Inspector Craddock of Scotland Yard, played by
Edward Fox) find the killer of a garrulous woman
from the village (Maureen Bennett).
Since 77u> Mirror Crack'd does not furnish
much inspiration for a director (Guy Hamilton,
whose specialty is flashy chase scenes — he
directed four of the Bond pictures — here resorts
to bogus subjective camera suspense tricks, pre
sumably to keep himself awake), and the adap
tors, Jonathan Hales and Barry Sandler, have all
but ignored the possibilities suggested by the
milieu, we're left with plot and character
(caricature, actually). The story line of The Mir
ror Crack'd (the title is out of Tennyson: "The
mirror crack'd from side to side/'The doom has
come upon me,' cried/The Lady of Shalot") is
reasonably clever, in a precious way, but when it
has been entirely paid out one may notice that

some knots still remain. An important detail, for
example, is that the lover/assistant (Geraldine
Chaplin) of the movie director (Rock Hudson)
calls each of the other suspects to announce that
she saw him or her poisoning the drink of the de
ceased. We shouldn't balk at how stupid a game
this is — people in mysteries often act in a per
ilously dumb manner — but we aren't told why she
feels it incumbent upon her to trap the murderer,
if indeed that is what she is trying to do.
I suspect that the popularity of the Agatha
Christie movies has more to do with the presence
of so many stars than anything else, and though
there are no real performances in The Mirror
Crack'd, only the actors are worth watching.
Rock Hudson telegraphs, as usual, and his at
tempts at playing high comedy are ludicrous, but
Tony Curtis, as the producer, gives funny twists to
his line readings and scrunches up his nose as if he
had smelled sour milk when the inspector asks
what he thinks are stupid questions. He gives his
character — seen far too briefly — shadings of
Sammy Glick and those marvellous cartoon luna
tics in Once in a Lifetime and Singin' in the Rain
who don't register that there is a world outside
Hollywood. ("Give me the Coast," he demands of
a long distance operator. "Whaddya mean,
'Which coast?' ") He wakes the picture up, just as
he woke up The Last Tycoon.
Elizabeth Taylor looks radiant in some shots,
though in one scene she wears a kimono that
makes her look unpleasantly thick, like Ethel
Merman. Kim Novak, who enters in a pink outfit
that swallows her up except for her decolletage,
manages one funny insult in that breathy con
tralto before her character is relegated to the sup
porting ranks. Geraldine Chaplin flashes one elo
quent anguished look from those amazing waif's
eyes. Edward Fox is stuck with the kind of stiff,
repressed Britisher role that Alex McCowen usu
ally plays, but his reading of a speech about his ad
miration for Taylor's acting is sweetly gallant,
and he leaks smiles when his cleverness is ex
posed. These are only moments, but they keep one
watching the film.
There is one casualty: Angela Lansbury. Done
up to look like Margaret Rutherford as Miss Mar
pie, she gets to use none of the gift for full-scale
burlesque she revealed in her lewd, frightening
portrayal of the cannibalistic Mrs. Lovett on
stage in Sweeney Todd a year and a half ago, and
none of the other dramatic skills that she has man
ifested through the years. Miss Marple is an old
dear whose most salient quality is her persistent
curiosity — hardly a treasure trove of possibilities
for a prodigious actress. Watching Lansbury in
live performance, one is practically seduced by
her; who wants to see her reduced to geriatric
amorphousness?

eyes. Edward Fox is stuck with the kind of stiff,
repressed Britisher role that Alex McCowen usu
ally plays, but his reading of a speech about his ad
miration for Taylor's acting is sweetly gallant,
and he leaks smiles when his cleverness is ex
posed. These are only moments, but they keep one
watching the film.
There is one casualty: Angela Lansbury. Done
up to look like Margaret Rutherford as Miss Mar
pie, she gets to use none of the gift for full-scale
burlesque she revealed in her lewd, frightening
portrayal of the cannibalistic Mrs. Lovett on
stage in Sweeney Todd a year and a half ago, and
none of the other dramatic skills that she has man
ifested through the years. Miss Marple is an old
dear whose most salient quality is her persistent
curiosity — hardly a treasure trove of possibilities
for a prodigious actress. Watching Lansbury in
live performance, one is practically seduced by
her; who wants to see her reduced to geriatric
amorphousness?
A friend of mine who is an Agatha Christie ad
mirer recently remarked that he didn't see any
point in filming her novels unless a means could
be found of simulating her technique of building
suspense and uncovering the solution to a mys
tery.
I'm not sure that is possible. Christie always
withheld pertinent information from her readers
until the very end — which is why no one ever
guesses the killer's identity in her books and why
some people complain that she is basically unfair;
translated to the screen, this exclusion of the au
dience amounts to deprivation, and the business of
last-minute revelations delivered in a lengthy
harangue by a detective (Hercule Poirot or Jane
Marple) is lethal, dramatically. In Murder on the
()rient Express the conclusion took up the whole
second half of the movie: the train stalled in the
snow and the movie ground to an appropriate halt.
Death on the Nile was somewhat livelier — there
were several murders — but The Mirror Crack'd,
the latest Christie picture, never gets going.
The movie begins with a screening of an antique
drawing-room mystery (meant to be a parody, but
it is broad and sloppy) for the citizens of a small
English village. The print tears just as the detec
tive is about to unmask the culprit, and when the
lights go up on the disappointed audience. Miss
Marple (Angela Lansbury) is among them and she
solves the mystery for them. This tamely humor
ous conceit is a fair example of what is to come: a
great deal of explication of what amounts to very
little action.
The cast of characters derives mainly from a
company filming Mary, Queen of Scots on loca
tion in the village, but the Hollywood types and the
snatches of second-rate bitchy repartee between
the two leading actresses (Elizabeth Taylor and
Kim Novak) are really just dressing. The movie is
about how Miss Marple and her nephew Dermot
(Inspector Craddock of Scotland Yard, played by
Edward Fox) find the killer of a garrulous woman
from the village (Maureen Bennett).
Since 77u> Mirror Crack'd does not furnish
much inspiration for a director (Guy Hamilton,
whose specialty is flashy chase scenes — he
directed four of the Bond pictures — here resorts
to bogus subjective camera suspense tricks, pre
sumably to keep himself awake), and the adap
tors, Jonathan Hales and Barry Sandler, have all
but ignored the possibilities suggested by the
milieu, we're left with plot and character
(caricature, actually). The story line of The Mir
ror Crack'd (the title is out of Tennyson: "The
mirror crack'd from side to side/'The doom has
come upon me,' cried/The Lady of Shalot") is
reasonably clever, in a precious way, but when it
has been entirely paid out one may notice that

some knots still remain. An important detail, for
example, is that the lover/assistant (Geraldine
Chaplin) of the movie director (Rock Hudson)
calls each of the other suspects to announce that
she saw him or her poisoning the drink of the de
ceased. We shouldn't balk at how stupid a game
this is — people in mysteries often act in a per
ilously dumb manner — but we aren't told why she
feels it incumbent upon her to trap the murderer,
if indeed that is what she is trying to do.
I suspect that the popularity of the Agatha
Christie movies has more to do with the presence
of so many stars than anything else, and though
there are no real performances in The Mirror
Crack'd, only the actors are worth watching.
Rock Hudson telegraphs, as usual, and his at
tempts at playing high comedy are ludicrous, but
Tony Curtis, as the producer, gives funny twists to
his line readings and scrunches up his nose as if he
had smelled sour milk when the inspector asks
what he thinks are stupid questions. He gives his
character — seen far too briefly — shadings of
Sammy Glick and those marvellous cartoon luna
tics in Once in a Lifetime and Singin' in the Rain
who don't register that there is a world outside
Hollywood. ("Give me the Coast," he demands of
a long distance operator. "Whaddya mean,
'Which coast?' ") He wakes the picture up, just as
he woke up The Last Tycoon.
Elizabeth Taylor looks radiant in some shots,
though in one scene she wears a kimono that
makes her look unpleasantly thick, like Ethel
Merman. Kim Novak, who enters in a pink outfit
that swallows her up except for her decolletage,
manages one funny insult in that breathy con
tralto before her character is relegated to the sup
porting ranks. Geraldine Chaplin flashes one elo
quent anguished look from those amazing waif's
eyes. Edward Fox is stuck with the kind of stiff,
repressed Britisher role that Alex McCowen usu
ally plays, but his reading of a speech about his ad
