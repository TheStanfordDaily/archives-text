# Iran rejects transfer of hostages to Algeria
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Tehran — Iranian government
spokesman Behzad Nabavi yesterday
rejected — for the moment — any
transfer of some of the 52 American
hostages to Algeria if Washington
meets only part of Iran's demands for
their release.
Nabavi repeated at a press con
ference that the hostages would be put
on trial if Iran were convinced that the
United States did not want to comply
with the Iranian parliament's condi
tions for freeing the hostages and in
stead was trying to buy time.
Nabavi would not say whether the
three Americans recently transferred
from the Foreign Ministry were with
the other 49 hostages. Their place of
detention is secret, he said.
Asked about Tuesday's statement
by Prime Minister Mohammed Ali
Rajai about accepting Algerian good
offices in the hostage matter, Nabavi
said Algeria had not made any com
mitment beyond Algeria's role as in
termediary.
"The Algerian government," he
said, "has handed the Iranian author
ities a communique taking into ac
count the positions of both sides on the
hostage question. But that does not
mean that Algeria has made a pro
posal off its own bat."
Algeria also has agreed that U.S. fi
nancial guarantees to Tehran be de
posited in Algerian care, Nabavi
added.
Nabavi, Iran's chief negotiator on
the hostage-release question, did not
reply when asked to confirm reports
that Iran had accepted the principle of
the latest U.S. offer.
"Once the problem has been clari
fied, I shall tell you what has hap
pened," he said.
An informed source meanwhile re
ported "progress" in the Algerian
mediated U.S.-Iranian talks.

But it was pointed out that Tehran
had not yet received the U.S. response
to Tehran's most recent request for
clarification.
The Algerians originally entered
the picture as custodians of Iranian in
terests in the United States after
diplomatic relations with Iran were
broken last April and the Iranian Em
bassy in Washington was closed.
When the Iranian Parliament voted
Nov. 2 to open negotiations on a solu
tion to the hostage crisis, authorities
there designated the Algerians to
serve as intermediaries, and they
have served in that capacity ever
since.
Some recent news accounts of
statements by Iranian officials have
given rise to speculation that the Al
gerians have been initiating proposals
of their own, but U.S. officials flatly
deny this is so. "They are in
termediaries," State Department
spokesman John Trattner said yester
day. "They have not changed their
role."
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
has recently defined the Algerian role
as that of "positive intermediary." He
explained:
"When they come to the United
States to get our response, they do
more than accept the document. They
also ask questions about the docu
ment, undertaking to anticipate the
questions the Iranians may put to
them, so that they can deliver the
document with a rather full under
standing on their own part of the docu
ment's significance and meaning.
They do that in reverse when they re
ceive the Iranian response to our docu
ments."
With time "clicking away," one of
ficial noted, "The turnaround time
from the Iranians is faster — that's
one of the obvious things we are sen
sing here."
