Reagan picks last cabinet member
Washington — President-elect Ronald Reagan tapped
Utah education official Terrel Bell yesterday to be educa
tion secretary, ending a long search for someone to head
an agency that President Jimmy Carter created and Re
agan has vowed to dismantle.
Bell. 59, was U.S. education commissioner during the
Nixon and Ford administrations. He is now Utah's com
missioner of higher education.
The choice of an education secretary comes two weeks
after Reagan's earlier self-imposed goal of completing his
Cabinet selections by Christmas. The president-elect ad
mitted publicly that some candidates turned down his of
fer of the education job.
The naming of Bell left the final makeup of the Reagan
Cabinet with one black. New York lawyer Samuel Pierce,
nominated to be secretary of housing and urban develop
ment. For the first time in six years, there was no female
Cabinet secretary.
The only woman so far named to a top-echelon job in the
incoming administration is Jeane Kirkpatrick, a
Georgetown University professor who was named United

Nations ambassador, a post Reagan has described as Cabi
net-level.
Begin government faces collapse
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menaehem Begin of Israel
is facing an imminent collapse of his fragile parlia
mentary coalition and the prospect of an election before
the scheduled end of his term.
The end to Begin's rightist Likud government — beset
by rampant triple-digit inflation and constant inter-min
isterial squabbling — could come as soon as next week.
And, according to a timetable that was being circulated
widely in the Knesset (Parliament) yesterday, a national
election for a new Parliament and prime minister would
be held on May 17, six months earlier than scheduled. Be
gin was elected in 1977.
The opposition Labor Party is preparing a motion to dis
olve the Knesset on Tuesday, on the basis of charges that
the government's ability to function has disintegrated.
Barring an llth-hour shift of alliances, it appears that Be
gin s opponents could muster enough votes to defeat the
coalition.

On paper, the Likud government has enough of a margin
— albeit paper thin — to withstand a Labor Party
challenge The coalition can count on 61 votes of the
Knesset's 120 members.
But separate threats of resignations made this week by
Finance Minister Yigael Hurvitz and Education Minister
Zevelun Hammer over a controversial teachers' wage in
crease proposal have jeopardized up to 12 votes in Begin's
coalition. If either of the ministers quit and took with him
party allies in the Knesset. Begin's government would cer
tainly collapse.
Poles protest near Soviet border
Warsaw, Poland — A new labor conflict in Poland sharp
ened yesterday as militant workers and farmers in a town
near the Soviet border refused to negotiate with a govern
ment commission dispatched to hear their grievances.
A spokesman for the militants in the the town of
Ustrzyki Dolne. about 10 miles from the border, said they
rejected the commission as not being authorized to sign an
agreement.
The commission arrived in Ustrzyki Dolne on Tuesday
after workers in 17 nearby factories stopped work for an
hour to support some 70 farmers and workers occupying an
administrative building in the town since Dec. 29.
The spokesman, Jan Wolinski, said the talks would be
"nonexistent'' until the government provided "a compe
tent commission equipped with powers" to negotiate re
sponse to a list of 14 demands. He said these included gov
ernment investigation of local corruption and an end to al
leged local "repression" of members of Solidarity, Po
land's biggest independent trade union.
He said the protesters would call regional strikes if no
agreement is reached with the government by Saturday.
Kenya accuses man of holiday blast
Nairobi — The New Year's Eve bomb blast that killed 15
persons at the landmark Norfolk Hotel here was the work
of a Palestinian terrorist, according to a statement issued
yesterday by the Kenya government.
The government identified the terrorist as Qaddura
Mohammed Abd-el-hamid, who. it said, is a Moroccan na
tional and a member of the Popular Front for the Liber
ation of Palestine. The PFLP has denied responsibility for
the explosion.
Kenyan investigators said the man arrived in Nairobi on
Dec. 23, bearing a Maltese passport with the name Muradi
Aksali. Authorities said the passport was one of five car
ried by the terrorist.
The government here said that Qaddura was known to
have been a member of the A 1 Fatah group in Lebanon and
subsequently joined the PFLP.

Thatcher confident about economy
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher believes
her monetarist policies are beginning to produce signifi
cant signs of long-term improvement for Britain's bat
tered economy, despite the country's current severe re
cession.
But she fears her government's confidence and de
termination could be dangerously eroded by its sharp fall
in public opinion polls, British media preoccupation with
bad economic news, her ministers' failure to effectively
accentuate the positive and damage done by a few min
isters who publicly disagreed with her policies or leaked
details of dissension within her Cabinet.
This underlies a spate of optimistic new year
statements by Thatcher and some of her senior ministers
during the past week and Monday's unexpected reshuffle
of part of her Cabinet.
Thatcher sent an unmistakeable message to dissenters
within her Cabinet by firing as leader of the House of Com
mons Norman St. John-Stevas, whose concern about the
harshness and social divisiveness of Thatcher's survival
of-the-fittest policies had surfaced in both public ut
terances and private asides.
Minor earthquake shakes region
San Juan Bautista — The third small, but significant
earthquake to rattle the central California coastal area in
a week occurred early yesterday, but like the others it
caused no damage or injuries.
The earthquake, which registered up to 4.5 on the
Richter scale of ground motion, occurred about 3:42 a.m.
and was centered just west of San Juan Bautista, about 80
miles southeast of San Francisco, said seismologists at
UC-Berkeley.
Dow Jones plunges 23 points
New York — The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
fell 23.80 to 980.89, for its biggest drop since it lost 26.45
points last Oct. 9.
In the first three sessions of the year the average
climbed 40.70 points to its highest level in more than four
years.
Declines outnumbered advances by a wide margin on
the Big Board.
The NYSE's composite index fell 1.85 to 77.29.
Today's Weather
Low clouds through tomorrow. Partial afternoon clear
ing today. High in 50s to low 60s. Lows in upper 30s to 40s.
Chance of rain tomorrow.

Reagan picks last cabinet member
Washington — President-elect Ronald Reagan tapped
Utah education official Terrel Bell yesterday to be educa
tion secretary, ending a long search for someone to head
an agency that President Jimmy Carter created and Re
agan has vowed to dismantle.
Bell. 59, was U.S. education commissioner during the
Nixon and Ford administrations. He is now Utah's com
missioner of higher education.
The choice of an education secretary comes two weeks
after Reagan's earlier self-imposed goal of completing his
Cabinet selections by Christmas. The president-elect ad
mitted publicly that some candidates turned down his of
fer of the education job.
The naming of Bell left the final makeup of the Reagan
Cabinet with one black. New York lawyer Samuel Pierce,
nominated to be secretary of housing and urban develop
ment. For the first time in six years, there was no female
Cabinet secretary.
The only woman so far named to a top-echelon job in the
incoming administration is Jeane Kirkpatrick, a
Georgetown University professor who was named United

Nations ambassador, a post Reagan has described as Cabi
net-level.
Begin government faces collapse
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menaehem Begin of Israel
is facing an imminent collapse of his fragile parlia
mentary coalition and the prospect of an election before
the scheduled end of his term.
The end to Begin's rightist Likud government — beset
by rampant triple-digit inflation and constant inter-min
isterial squabbling — could come as soon as next week.
And, according to a timetable that was being circulated
widely in the Knesset (Parliament) yesterday, a national
election for a new Parliament and prime minister would
be held on May 17, six months earlier than scheduled. Be
gin was elected in 1977.
The opposition Labor Party is preparing a motion to dis
olve the Knesset on Tuesday, on the basis of charges that
the government's ability to function has disintegrated.
Barring an llth-hour shift of alliances, it appears that Be
gin s opponents could muster enough votes to defeat the
coalition.

On paper, the Likud government has enough of a margin
— albeit paper thin — to withstand a Labor Party
challenge The coalition can count on 61 votes of the
Knesset's 120 members.
But separate threats of resignations made this week by
Finance Minister Yigael Hurvitz and Education Minister
Zevelun Hammer over a controversial teachers' wage in
crease proposal have jeopardized up to 12 votes in Begin's
coalition. If either of the ministers quit and took with him
party allies in the Knesset. Begin's government would cer
tainly collapse.
Poles protest near Soviet border
Warsaw, Poland — A new labor conflict in Poland sharp
ened yesterday as militant workers and farmers in a town
near the Soviet border refused to negotiate with a govern
ment commission dispatched to hear their grievances.
A spokesman for the militants in the the town of
Ustrzyki Dolne. about 10 miles from the border, said they
rejected the commission as not being authorized to sign an
agreement.
The commission arrived in Ustrzyki Dolne on Tuesday
after workers in 17 nearby factories stopped work for an
hour to support some 70 farmers and workers occupying an
administrative building in the town since Dec. 29.
The spokesman, Jan Wolinski, said the talks would be
"nonexistent'' until the government provided "a compe
tent commission equipped with powers" to negotiate re
sponse to a list of 14 demands. He said these included gov
ernment investigation of local corruption and an end to al
leged local "repression" of members of Solidarity, Po
land's biggest independent trade union.
He said the protesters would call regional strikes if no
agreement is reached with the government by Saturday.
Kenya accuses man of holiday blast
Nairobi — The New Year's Eve bomb blast that killed 15
persons at the landmark Norfolk Hotel here was the work
of a Palestinian terrorist, according to a statement issued
yesterday by the Kenya government.
The government identified the terrorist as Qaddura
Mohammed Abd-el-hamid, who. it said, is a Moroccan na
tional and a member of the Popular Front for the Liber
ation of Palestine. The PFLP has denied responsibility for
the explosion.
Kenyan investigators said the man arrived in Nairobi on
Dec. 23, bearing a Maltese passport with the name Muradi
Aksali. Authorities said the passport was one of five car
ried by the terrorist.
The government here said that Qaddura was known to
have been a member of the A 1 Fatah group in Lebanon and

Thatcher confident about economy
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher believes
her monetarist policies are beginning to produce signifi
cant signs of long-term improvement for Britain's bat
tered economy, despite the country's current severe re
cession.
But she fears her government's confidence and de
termination could be dangerously eroded by its sharp fall
in public opinion polls, British media preoccupation with
bad economic news, her ministers' failure to effectively
accentuate the positive and damage done by a few min

details of dissension within her Cabinet.
