old are encouraged to attend. Delec
table delicacies will be provided.
Correction
The open letter to the president pro
testing U.S. arms aid to El Salvador

has not yet been sent, since it is still
circulating for signatures. The CIS
PES is not affiliated with Amnesty In
ternational. The rally against U.S. in
tervention in El Salvador is at the Civ
ic Center in Berkeley on Jan. 17. The
symposium on El Salvador on Jan.
16th is in Wheeler auditorium at
Berkeley. The Daily regrets the er
rors.
