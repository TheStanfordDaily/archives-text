# New American Historical Association president
## Gordon Craig to head historian's group 
### Karen Springen 
Emeritus professor Gordon Craig of
the Stanford History Department, one
of the nation's leading scholars in
modern diplomacy and German his
tory. has been chosen president-elect
of the American Historical Associa
tion.
According to Craig, "the job is less
honorific than laborious."
Craig, who has been at Stanford
since 1961, held the endowed J.E.
Wallace Sterling professorship in the
humanities until attaining emeritus
status. He is also the first vice-presi
dent of the Comite International des
Sciences Historiques for the 1980-85
term.
He will become the third Stanford
AHA president in 10 years when he
succeeds Harvard professor Bernard
Bailyn in December 1981.The late
American historian. Prof. David Pot
ter was president in 1971 and French
historian Gordon Wright was presi
dent in 1975.
"I hope I can be as good as these two
fellows were." said Craig.
Conscious of history
He said the organization functions
not only to represent history but to
"make people more conscious of his
tory in life."
Craig cited the professional status
of women and minorities as two major

issues he hopes to address during his
two-year presidential term. He said
the two tend to receive jobs that are
not permanent and not on the tenure
track.
"We've got to keep looking at the
problem and not think that since we've
hired two women the problem is
solved," said Craig.
He added that " Ph.D.'s don't get the
kind of jobs that they should get be
cause of their talents" as a result of
the employment structure. "We need
to look for alternative careers for his
torians," he said.
An ahistorical nation
"We have tended to become an
ahistorical nation." He said, for ex
ample. that the U.S. has not had a his
torical president since John Kennedy.
"Carter never said anything about his
tory."
According to Craig, the problem
stems from the training of graduate
students to become much too special
ized. Educational goals should be re
oriented so students "begin to think of
writing the big books that the public
will read."
The AHA teaching division is con
cerned with the profession at all
levels. But Craig said it is particularly
interested in improving its position
with the lay public.
Membership is another important

concern "In times of inflation, the
dues have become more and more im
portant." he said. There are currently
about 15.000 dues-paving members of
the AHA.
According to Craig, the job should
not affect his role here although he
will travel to Washington more than
he would normally. As an emeritus, he
only teaches half-time. He is now
teaching "The Diplomatic Revolution
of Our Time" with Alexander George.
Power questioned
Craig also questioned the real
power of a national organization. He
hopes the AHA will "speak with a
louder and more effective voice."
He positively pointed, however, to
the group's "large budget" of about
$15,000.
The AHA serves both a domestic
and international role. Domestically,
private and professional historical as
sociations wish for affiliation. The or
ganization also deals with practical is
sues such as textbook selection.
Internationally, the AHA has a na
tional representative. "We also play
our role in exchanges of scholars,"
said Craig.
A nominating committee selected
Craig from about 60 candidates. He
ran against Lawrence Stone of Prince
ton. Neither candidate was told the
identity of his opponent. The two

wrote biographies and a 50-word
statement.
Craig's statement, similar to that of
his opponent's, emphasized current
unemployment, experimenting with
part-time positions and promoting af
firmative action and hiring.
Members voted by mail ballots, and
Craig received official notification of
his victory in December.

According to Craig, "the job is less
honorific than laborious."
Craig, who has been at Stanford
since 1961, held the endowed J.E.
Wallace Sterling professorship in the
humanities until attaining emeritus
status. He is also the first vice-presi
dent of the Comite International des
Sciences Historiques for the 1980-85
term.
He will become the third Stanford
AHA president in 10 years when he
succeeds Harvard professor Bernard
Bailyn in December 1981.The late
American historian. Prof. David Pot
ter was president in 1971 and French
historian Gordon Wright was presi
dent in 1975.
"I hope I can be as good as these two
fellows were." said Craig.
Conscious of history
He said the organization functions
not only to represent history but to
"make people more conscious of his
tory in life."
Craig cited the professional status
of women and minorities as two major

issues he hopes to address during his
two-year presidential term. He said
the two tend to receive jobs that are
not permanent and not on the tenure
track.
"We've got to keep looking at the
problem and not think that since we've
hired two women the problem is
solved," said Craig.
He added that " Ph.D.'s don't get the
kind of jobs that they should get be
cause of their talents" as a result of
the employment structure. "We need
to look for alternative careers for his
torians," he said.
An ahistorical nation
"We have tended to become an
ahistorical nation." He said, for ex
ample. that the U.S. has not had a his
torical president since John Kennedy.
"Carter never said anything about his
tory."
According to Craig, the problem
stems from the training of graduate
students to become much too special
ized. Educational goals should be re
oriented so students "begin to think of
writing the big books that the public
will read."
The AHA teaching division is con
cerned with the profession at all
levels. But Craig said it is particularly
interested in improving its position
with the lay public.
Membership is another important

concern "In times of inflation, the
dues have become more and more im
portant." he said. There are currently
about 15.000 dues-paving members of
the AHA.
According to Craig, the job should
not affect his role here although he
will travel to Washington more than
he would normally. As an emeritus, he
only teaches half-time. He is now
teaching "The Diplomatic Revolution
of Our Time" with Alexander George.
Power questioned
Craig also questioned the real
power of a national organization. He
hopes the AHA will "speak with a
louder and more effective voice."
He positively pointed, however, to
the group's "large budget" of about
$15,000.
The AHA serves both a domestic
and international role. Domestically,
private and professional historical as
sociations wish for affiliation. The or
ganization also deals with practical is
sues such as textbook selection.
Internationally, the AHA has a na
tional representative. "We also play
our role in exchanges of scholars,"
said Craig.
A nominating committee selected
Craig from about 60 candidates. He
ran against Lawrence Stone of Prince
ton. Neither candidate was told the
identity of his opponent. The two

wrote biographies and a 50-word
statement.
Craig's statement, similar to that of
his opponent's, emphasized current
unemployment, experimenting with
part-time positions and promoting af
firmative action and hiring.
Members voted by mail ballots, and
Craig received official notification of
his victory in December.
