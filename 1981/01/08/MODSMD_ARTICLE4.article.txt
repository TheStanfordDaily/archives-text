### Samuel Howe 
The board of overseers of the Hoo
ver Institution gathered Tuesday
night in Washington D.C. to hear a
speech bv one of the Hoover's hon
orary fellows, but it was no ordinary
honorary fellow who made the re
marks.
President-elect Ronald Reagan, the
first person to be accorded honorary
membership, told 200 people at a re
ception following the board's annual
meeting that he was "deeply grate
ful' to members of the institution for
"the support and expertise they have
provided me in the past and are pro
viding now" »
Reagan, who last addressed stu
dents here in 1976. singled out the Hoo
ver's director. W. Glenn Campbell, for
special praise, saying the institution's
"excellence has emerged in large part
because of Glenn Campbell. It is he
who has worked so hard and planned
so well. . . And it is he who has effec
tively administered this 'brightest
star in the constellation of think
tanks."
Also. Reagan said. "During the re
cent campaign I called on more people
from the Institution to help with my
campaign than from any other institu
tion "
In the receiving line at the recep

tion, which was held at the Sheraton-
Carlton hotel, were Campbell and his
wife Rita, also a senior fellow at the
institution, George Bush and his wife
Barbara, who were celebrating their
35th wedding anniversary and Alan
Hoover, son of the late president.
Included among the guests were
several cabinet designates and ad
visors to Reagan, including Martin
Anderson and Darrell Trent, who are
on leave from the Hoover. Supreme
Court justice William Rehnquist, Cali
fornia Sen. S.I Havakawa. Elizabeth
Taylor and Stanford president Donald
Kennedy rounded out a list of promi
nent guests,
Reagan, who deposited some 25 tons
of papers from his eight years as gov
ernor of Caliornia with the Institution,
joked often through his remarks,
saying that because of the number of
honorary degrees which he has re
ceived from various schools and or
ganizations, "I am waiting for some
one to tell me that what has most re
cently happened to me was hon
orary."
The Hoover board of overseers met
Tuesday afternoon to evaluate past
programs at the Institution and to pro
vide recommendations for future pro
grams. according to public relations
director George Marotta.
