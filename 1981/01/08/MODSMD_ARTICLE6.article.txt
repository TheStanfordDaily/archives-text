## Libya annexes Chad, warns Sudan 
### Washington Post 
Paris — Libya Tuesday an
nounced a merger with Chad, its
huge neighbor to the south
whose long-embattled capital
was taken over by government
forces three weeks ago with the
aid of Libyan tanks and planes.
The unpredictable Libyan
leader. Col. Moammar
Khadafy. has sought unity in the
last decade with a number of
Arab states — so far in vain —
and is said to be pushing for an
association of states under Lib
yan influence in Africa's Saha
ran and Sahel regions as part of
an Arab and Moslem resurgence
of which he sees himself as the
leader.
Unlike previous tries with
Arab states that were never ef
fective — including one still un
der discussion with Syria — the
unity declaration with Chad is
backed by the presence of Lib
yan troops and armor. In addi
tion. it comes against the back
ground of Khadafy's annexation
in 1975 of a 60-mile-wide swath
of Chadian border territory and
reports of promising uranium
deposits in the otherwise deso
late central African country.
Khadafy recently told an in
terviewer that Chad, which is
more than twice the size of Tex
as, is part of Libya's "vital liv
ing space."
Caution urged
Diplomats of France, the
Western country most con
cerned by the fate of its former
colony, nevertheless urged cau
tion in interpreting the an
nouncement, recalling the pre
vious announcements that were
never translated into fact. They
conceded, however, that in this
case Libya has the means to en
force its will.
"This," said one official, "is
more like the Anschluss
(Hitler's merger with Austria)
than Khadafy's platonic unions
with Tunisia. Egypt and, now,

Syria."
Although Libya has denied
that Libyan forces took part in
the conquest of the Chadian cap
ital of N'Djamena on Dec. 15.
the joint Chadian-Libyan com
munique issued Tuesday by the
official Libyan news agency
Jana said Libya would send mil
itary experts to "help safeguard
security and reinstate peace."
Open frontier
The communique, read over
Libya's Radio Tripoli and
monitored in Paris, called on all
other countries to recognize the
government of President
Goukouni Oueddei in Chad. Is
sued at the end of a four-dav vis
it to Tripoli, the Libyan capital,
by Oueddei, the communique
also stipulated that the Chad-
Libya frontier will be open "to
accomplish the merger of the
two brother peoples."
Western intelligence esti
mates based on satellite recon
naissance of the largely desert
country were that about 4000
Libyan troops took part in the
final phase of the 16-year Chad
civil war. Libyan spokesmen
said that they were part of a Lib
yan-trained Islamic Legion.
French and other sources say
the Libyan battle plan was
worked out by Soviet and East
German military technicians,
of which there are large num
bers stationed in Libya.
Warnings to Sudan
Tuesday's communique
warned neighboring Sudan
"against any aggression against
Chad from Sudanese soil." In
formed sources say Egypt sup
plied Oueddei's main rival in the
civil war, Defense Minister
Hissene Habre, through Sudan.
Jana said that a statement by
Sudanese President Gaafar
Nimeiri that the war has only
just started in Chad "con
stitutes the start of ag
gression." Habre. whose fief is
the mountainous country

bordering Sudan, signed a
cease-fire but later swore to
continue guerrilla warfare.
Niger exposed
Experts say that the two
countries now the most exposed
to new pressure from Libya are
Chad's eastern and western
neighbors, Sudan and Niger. In
mid-October, Khadafy called on
the Touaregs, a leading Saharan
desert nomad people, to rebel in
northern Niger and Mali and
come to Libya as "a base" to
conduct their struggle.
"I declare the frontiers of
Libya open to the sons of the
Touaregs in Mali and Niger."
the Libyan said. "I call on them
to revolt, raise their heads and
take up arms."
Niger's nc r thern desert con
tains France's most important
source of uranium for its nucle

ar energy and defense pro
grams. These deposits have
helped give rise to the reports
that similar deposits could be
found in Chad.
French troops have been sent
to reinforce the mining region of
Arlit in an apparent effort to re
assure both the Niger govern
ment and the country's large
French community.
But France's failure to block
Khadafy's takeover of
N'Djamena has obviously
shaken faith in French protec
tion in the region. Several
French-speaking African lead
ers have publicly and privately
voiced concern over France's
hands-off attitude in Chad de
spite a bellicosely worded
French communique just 36
hours before the fall of
N'Djamena.
