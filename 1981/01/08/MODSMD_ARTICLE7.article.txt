# Gang of Four trial to have lasting impact on China
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — When the trial of the "Gang of Four"
and other radical leaders of the Cultural Revolu
tion began, it seemed to be largely a vendetta
against Jiang Qing, the widow of Chairman Mao
Zedong, and an effort to vindicate the radicals'
principal victims.

!\eivs analysis

By the time the formal guilty verdicts are pro
nounced and sentences imposed, the process will
have gone much further and wrought several ma
jor political changes in China. Among them:
—After more than than two years of hesitation,
the Chinese Communist Party reluctantly
criticized Mao and his policies over the last 20
years of his life. It had no choice, for Jiang made
Mao and his policies her defense. The line was
finally drawn between "crimes" and his "mis
takes."
As artificial as this may seem, it was politically
unthinkable two years ago, and still too difficult
an issue on which to get a consensus six months
ago. For the future, it means the abandonment of
most of Mao's policies, and Chinese leaders now
see that as essential to all economic, social and
political development.
Radicals discredited
—The leftist radicals have been discredited to
tally. Before the trial, their policies and
philosophy were already being characterized as
bankrupt, but testimony and evidence presented
in nearly six weeks of court hearings, including
tape recordings of their own meetings, portrayed
them as nothing more than power-hungry
schemers using radical rhetoric to manipulate the
people.
No other propanganda campaign, according to
Chinese who follow the trial on television and in
the press each day, would have had the same im
pact as the relentless and factual exposure of the
radicals in court. This in turn is an important as
surance to those worried about another pend
ulum-like shift that would bring the radical lef
tists back to power.
—A start was made on establishing the rule of
law by warning all party and government officials
that they will be held accountable in the future for
their crimes. In the past, all this was handled ex
tralegally by the party, with the results that most
officials believed themselves to be beyond the
law. The current leadership has insisted that this
must be changed as an essential step in the coun
try's socialist democratization.
With many participants reading party-ap
proved scripts, the trial fell short of Western stan
dards of jurisprudence, but Chinese saw it as pri
marily an exposition of the defendants' guilt and a

necessary effort to establish a framework into
which the substance of law will later grow.
"Unless these people were tried for their
crimes — wrongful arrests, torture, murders and
treason — then the talk about establishing the rule
of law before which all men would be equal would
be a joke," a British-educated law professor from
Shanghai commented privately. "As this was the
first such case we had, there were mistakes, but
we had to start with this case. Chinese law will
evolve, just as the various Western legal tradi
tions have evolved. The important thing was to
make a start."
Moving on
Even before the trial ended, China had moved
on to other questions — the party's assessment of
Mao's and its own mistakes over 30 years in
power, a reshuffle of the top leadership, a new ec
onomic program — in a transition whose matter
of-course style increasingly characterizes Chi
nese politics under Deng Xiaoping, a party vice
chairman and the country's most powerful leader.
"Think back to the Cultural Revolution, when
Liu Shaoqi (the late Chinese head of state) was
purged, and the hundreds of millions of people
who were mobilized in mass movements as part of
it," a newspaper editor here remarked, "and
compare it with the situation now. Do you see a
million Red Guards in Tiananmen Square waving
little red books? Do you see mindless slogans
pasted up all over? Do you see mobs attacking
their political opponents? This is a fundamental
change in Chinese politics, and it has come so qui
etly that even we do not appreciate it fully."
China has a demonstrated ability to revert to
older practices, and tomorrow or the day after the
streets may again be alive with the summoned
masses protesting this, denouncing that.
"Like everyting else in China, politics reflect
thousands of years of feudalism," a social scien
tist commented. "These patterns will not be al
tered in one, two or even three tries."
Yet, the trial is being taken by many thoughtful
Chinese as evidence that the old patterns are
changing and will continue to change.
In first announcing plans for the trial more than
a year ago, the current leadership was declaring
its intention to break from past practice in favor
of a system that would bolster greater de
mocracy.
The fate of Jiang Qing and other members of
the Gang of Four was uncertain, in fact, until they
were shown on television being handed copies of
their indictments.
Previously, detailed charges were not pub
lished in such cases — too many political secrets
were believed to be involved — and a propaganda
campaign was substituted for any sort of legal
procedure.
