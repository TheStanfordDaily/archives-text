# Australian diplomats face ban on alcohol
## Pakistan implements reforms to keep Islamic state 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Islamabad, Pakistan — In the latest
step in Pakistan's effort to turn itself
into a model Islamic state, foreign mis
sions in the country have been asked not
to serve alcohol at their receptions.
All embassies and foreign aid agencies
have received a circular from General
Zia ul-Haq's military government asking
them to serve only soft drinks at parties
where Pakistanis are present.
Alcohol was banned in Moslem Paki
stan three years ago as part of the gov
ernment's program of "Islamization,"
but foreigners with diplomatic privi
leges were allowed to import liquor for
their own consumption.
The first warning regarding the serv
ing of alcohol at diplomatic receptions
came in January 1978. The Australian
Embassy, which held its annual national
day party that month, pioneered a sys
tem whereby waiters served soft drinks
on trays but alcoholic drinks were avail

able to those who discovered a discreet
partitioned-off bar in a corner.
This procedure was apparently ac
cepted and the "Moslem corner" as it
was jokingly named became de rigeur at
all non-Moslem diplomatic receptions.
Ordered to 'go dry'
This month's directive, which comes
again just before Australia Day, has
been taken by diplomats in the capital as
a booster request. It appeared at the
same time as Pakistan International Air
ways was ordered to "go dry."
As part of the drive for changes that
reflect Islamic traditions, General Zia
recently ordered the country's judges to
discard their wigs and gowns inherited
from the British Raj and adopt national
Islamic dress of formal black coat and
baggy trousers. Women students have
been asked to wear the "burqa" or
Moslem cloak to their colleges, and all
Moslem students now have to undergo

compulsory examinations in Islamic
studies.
In the first step toward the Islam
ization of the economy, the military gov
ernment this month introduced interest
free banking in Pakistan's commercial
banks. The procedure, run alongside the
conventional interest-based system, has
so far attracted few customers other
than General Zia himself, senior govern
ment officials and army officers.
Wealthy complain
Less wealthy clients have said that
they cannot be expected to give up their
interest when the average earning is
around a monthly 450 rupees (about $50)
and inflation is running at around 30
percent. But government officials point
out that the interest-free accounts are
actually profit and loss accounts, which,
if invested wisely, can give an even bet
ter return to depositers. The deposits are
initially to be invested in government

projects and the profit or loss will be
assessed every six months.
The Pakistan Banking Council this
month placed large advertisements in
every newspaper declaring: "By the
grace of almighty Allah all the branches
of the nationalized banks have opened
separate counters for interest-free bank
ing — may Allah bless us with success."
Quite how the profit, or, theoretically,
losses, on these bank deposits will be
assessed is not yet clear. But some feel
that the banks will be encouraged by the
government to pay slightly above the
current rate on interest-bearing ac
counts to popularize the new system. The
first test of this, however, will not come
until the first half-year "profits" are
drawn up in July.
Meanwhile, on Jan. 26, Australia's na
tional day, the way drinks are served will
be the test case for the other Islamic in
itiative.
