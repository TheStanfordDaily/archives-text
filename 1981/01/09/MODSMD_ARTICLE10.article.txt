# Poles dispute over 40 hour work week
## 
### 
Warsaw, Poland (AP) — A new confron
tation between Poland's independent labor
movement and the communist government
appears to be taking shape over the 40-hour
work week.
The presidium of Solidarity, the nation's
largest independent union with about 10 mil
lion members, was expected to give final
approval today to a demand for a five-day,
40-hour work week with no reduction in pay.
The government, seeking a solution to the
nation's grave economic problems, says the
country cannot afford the 40-hour week yet.
Deputy Premier Mieczyslaw Jagielski,
who negotiated the agreements that ended
last summer's wave of strikes and recog
nized the workers' right to form unions free
of Communist Party control, said in a tele
vision appearance that the government was
standing by its counterproposals.
They call for either two Saturdays off
each month or all Saturdays free but with an
extra 30 minutes on the job each day.

"Not everyone was unanimous in this
complicated matter," Jagielski said.
"However, taking into account all factual
arguments, a close study of the possibilities
and the economic aspects basic for every
citizen, the government expects that its de
cision will meet with understanding on the
part of the crews and trade unions."
Solidarity claims the Gdansk strike set
tlement on Aug. 31 promised a five-day
work week with no extension of the working
day.
Meanwhile, the government was grappl
ing with a regional labor dispute in the
southeastern corner of the country 10 miles
from the Soviet border.
Workers and farmers occupying a gov
ernment building in the town of Ustrzynki
Dolne refused to negotiate with a govern
ment delegation led by Stanislaw Ciosek. a
minister without portfolio responsible for
trade union affairs.
Jan Wolinski, a spokesman for Solidar

itv's regional office in nearby Rzeszow,
claimed the government delegation "can
not undertake any decision and is not au
thorized to sign any agreements."
He said the militants would not negotiate
until the Warsaw government dispatched a
"competent commission" to deal with their
complaint that local authorities were
harassing Solidarity activists.
About 70 farmers and workers took over
the administrative building in Ustrzynki on
Dec. 29. Workers in 17 local enterprises
staged a one-hour sympathy strike Tuesday.
A student protest loomed in Lodz, Po
land's second largest city. Dissident
sources said students in the law and admin
istrative colleges were threatening a sit-in
today unless the regime agreed to some 30
demands. They include freedom for politi
cal prisoners, screening of a controversial
film on last summer's strikes in the Baltic
seaport of Gdansk and curbs on the security
services.
