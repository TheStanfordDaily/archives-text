# Open Space District saves pieces of wilderness from urban development
## 
### Sherry Norman 
Someday soon it may be possible to walk a
network of trails from Los Gatos to San Mateo,
through untouched rolling foothills and parks.
This is the dream of the Midpeninsula Regional
Open Space District.
The Open Space preserves are a near-at
hand wilderness experience in an area of rapid
urban growth, designed for passive recrea
tional use, such as hiking and nature study. The
district currently operates approximately 8600
acres, spread over 13 preserves scattered from
Los Gatos to San Carlo's, and from the San
Francisco Bay to Skyline Boulevard.
Midpeninsula is an independent public agen
cy funded by a regional property tax. It was
created by the voters of Santa Clara County in
1972, and joined bv south San Mateo in 1976. to
preserve foothill and bavshore lands in their
natural state for public enjoyment.
A small percentage of district land has been
gifted to the Peninsula Open Space Trust, a
private nonprofit organization set up to receive
gifts of land which it can either give or sell to
the district. The majority of Open Space land
has been purchased, sometimes using
matching government funds, and often at
bargain prices, from private owners who wish
to see the land maintained in its natural state.
More than 90 percent of Midpeninsula's
budget is allocated for the acquisition of land
before it becomes either developed or too cost
ly. The Los Trancos preserve is an example of
land slated for development that the district
purchased in order to maintain its undeveloped
state.
The district often cooperates with city or
county agencies in joint acquisitions which
would be too costly to purchase or maintain in
dependently. According to Charlotte Mac-
Donald, public communications coordinator,
the district hopes to have acquired enough sig
nificant Open Space parcels and easements by
1987. which when combined with city, county
and state park lands, will create a corridor of
undeveloped land stretching the length of the
Midpeninsula.
After this top priority objective is achieved.

a larger percentage of the district's funds will
be apportioned for improving the facilities and
increasing access to the land
Access to the preserves will be improved,
but none of the land will be developed as tradi
tional parks with all their amenities Ranger
Bob McKiben said, "It's truly open space."
Some areas are capable of absorbing heav
ier usage without damage to their ecosystems,
such as the Los Trancos preserve, which
ranger John Escoban said is the prototype of
developed Open Space land, with a parking lot.
signs and a self-guiding trail system. More sen
sitive areas, with fragile plantlife, will be des
ignated refuges and will remain relatively in
accessible and unpublicized.
Proposition 13 reduced the Open Space Dis
trict's original income base of 10 cents per $100
assessed valuation by more than 50 percent.
With the aid of state bail-out funds and re
allocations of existing tax revenues, the dis
trict has recovered approximately 65 percent
of their pre-Proposition 13 income.
The district is working to educate the public
regarding the need for open space and how it
should be used. Much of the land will remain
unmarked and difficult to find until funds are
diverted from the acquisition of land to its de
velopment. However, free pamphlets and
maps are available and the land is there for
anyone to visit from dawn to dusk. Docent
tours are scheduled every Sunday afternoon at
Los Trancos. or upon request, at any of the oth
er preserves. District officials expect the
number of visitors to continue increasing as
the existence of the lands becomes better
known and open land becomes more of a rarity.
The preservation of open land, as such, is a
relatively new concept. The formation of the
Open Space District was a grassroots effort,
said Mac Donald. Its success has been depen
dent upon the willingness of the citizens of San
ta Clara and San Mateo counties to support
land preservation through taxation. Expansion
to neighboring counties would be contingent
upon local citizen movements to create such an
organization, he said.

Page Mill Road, across from the Los Trancos preserve. There

are no signs marking Monte Bello, but it is public land and open
for passive recreational use.
