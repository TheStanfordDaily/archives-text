# Study finds cholesterol causes heart attack and death risks
## 
### 
Boston (AP) — A 20-vear
study has turned up new
evidence to support the theory
that people who eat a lot of high
cholesterol food have excessive
levels of cholesterol in their
bloodstreams and are more
likely to die from heart disease.
For a decade, health experts
have increasingly believed that
high-cholesterol food is bad for
the heart. Until now. re
searchers have been unable to
show that individuals who eat
this way for a long time have
more heart trouble.
Dr Richard Shekelle, who
directed the study, said he hopes
the work will convince skeptics,
including some in the medical
field, that eating too much
saturated fat and cholesterol is
unhealthy.
He conceded his study found
that only slightly more heart
disease was discovered among
those on a high-cholesterol diet.
But he blamed this largely on
the difficulties in gathering
statistics on people's eating
habits.
Even though his statistics are
not particularly dramatic,
Shekelle's is the first major
American study to find a long
term health advantage to cut
ting cholesterol in the diet.
His findings are at odds with
guidelines issued last summer

by the National Academy of Sci
ences That group said people do
not need to limit their consump
tion of cholesterol andsaturated
fat because there is no evidence
that this will save lives.
"For at least 10 years, the
weight of evidence indicates
that what we eat is related to the
risk of development of pre
mature heart attack," Shekelle
said in an interview.
' 'One of the pieces of evidence
that has been missing, however,
is showing this in individual per
sons — showing that what indi
vidual men ate was in fact re

lated to their long-term risk of
heart attack. I think that is what
this contributes."
The doctors surveyed the eat
ing habits of 1900 men who
worked for Western Electric in
the Chicago area in 1957. 1958
and 1977. They noticed an as
sociation between the diet
scores and the level of
cholesterol in the blood. When
the doctors surveyed the men 20
years later, they found that
changes in their eating habits
determined whether their
cholesterol levels had gone up or
down.
