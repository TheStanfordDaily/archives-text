## Rethinking registration 
### 
Posters emblazoned with
"Resist the Draft" abound on
Stanford kiosks, in Stanford
dorms, and even on Stanford
bathroom stall doors The prob
lem plaguing the ranks on both
fronts of the emotional regis
tration battle is that quiet,
logical, and in-depth reasoning
is in critical short supply.
The Kent State tragedy is
reminiscent of the conse
quences of emotional lack of
reason A close examination of
the battle strategies of each fac
tion in today's registration skir
mish provides a thought provok
ing insight that may not solve
the registration dilemma, but
will insure a well-thought un
derstanding.
What isn't registration? Reg
istration is not a contract with
the government to serve. Regis
tration is not a moral, emo
tional. or spiritual support of
war. Resisting registration is
not resisting the draft. Regis
tering is not a vote for ag
gression. hostility or oppression
of Third World nations. Why?
Registration does not imply that
a registeree will comply with a
summons to serve if the draft is
reinstated. Therefore, regis
tration does not say, "I will
serve." Resisting the draft
says."I object to serving and
will not serve." Resisting regis
tration says."I am choosing to
resist bureaucratic detail and to
commit a felony."
How can a felon or unap
prehended felon voice his or her
voice with popular credibility?
Within the present system of
government, non-violent per
suasion through active vocal
consideration of the facts is
more politically and formally
legitimate than commiting a
felony and attempting to argue
in public view with a bench war
rant issued for your arrest. Sim
ply. the most legal action and
the most politically effective
action within the present milieu
is to register, comply with the
law. then protest and challenge
the status quo. Without an out
standing felony charge, cons
cientious objection can debate
in the public without fear
The best wav to influence the

government ideologically is to
exert power on the Congress,
the American people, the courts
and the executive branch Battl
ing over the compulsory draft in
the courts is an especially effec
tive means to stir thestatusquo
Hoes each citizen have the fun
damental right to treely choose
and guide his or her own destiny
within the bounds of legitimate
freedoms and liberties 9
The ACLU has taken politi
cally powerful approach by util
izing the courts to consider the
constitutionality of regis
tration. Action against the draft
can be accomplished more legit
imately and more effectively bv
working within the legal
framework of the courts than
simply not filling out a regis
tration card.
Does filling out a registration
card induce the government to
reinstate the draft and commit
open aggression'' Registration,
like the death penalty, is in
tended to be a political deter
rent. If the United States is pre
pared and capable of self-de
fense. other nations will be far
less inclined to attempt a possi
bly costly aggression.
Vladmir Sahkarov, an ex-
KGB agent now living in the
United States, commented in
1979. "The Russians will attack
the United States as long as the
loss of Russian lives can be min
imized. Unless the United
States has the deterrent of ob
servable readiness. Soviet ag
gression will be inevitable" The
death penalty is intended to pro
vide a powerful consequence to
commiting serious crime Reg
istration is simply political in
surance against aggression, not
in support of it. Because the
death penalty exists, are we in
favor of killing American
citizens or preventing crime?
The vehemently pro-draft
faction insists that patriotism
demands registration. This per
ception can be equally inflexible
as the anti-registration view. In
recalling the Revolutionary
War. patriotism was heart-felt
by supporters of a cause deman

ding fundamental rights Free
dom of expression, freedom of
petition, and freedom to protest
are all fundamental rights
I
Patriotism would dictate that
the American people consider
registration and the draft and
then, based on the traditions,
history, and present ideals of
the United States, take ap
propriate action Based on these
criteria, registering, then pro
testing or supporting the draft is
the legal, expedient, and effec
tive solution for those of regis
tration age
On January 20. the Reagan
administration will commence.
President-elect Reagan does
not support a peacetime draft
and registration may be
eliminated. Yet, a problem may
arise if registration is ended.
Without the registration con
troversy. the public discussion
of the issue will disappear over
the political horizon and public
query into the ramifications of
future registration and the draft
will disperse. Consistent public
involvement is needed.
For those of registration age
and those of pre- and post-regis
tration age. one fact must be
considered: The earth is a mon
tage of political perceptions,
roles and philosophies where
conflict is often inevitable. If in
the future, registration or the
draft is ended or reinstated,
what views are the most logical
ly reasonable? What action will
reconcile the interests of the na
tion and the rights of the individ
ual 0 The posters are partially
correct in saying. "Think before
you register." but also think
during and after.

For those of registration age

roles and philosophies where
conflict is often inevitable. If in

The Kent State tragedy is
reminiscent of the conse

What isn't registration? Reg
istration is not a contract with
the government to serve. Regis
tration is not a moral, emo
tional. or spiritual support of
war. Resisting registration is
not resisting the draft. Regis
tering is not a vote for ag
gression. hostility or oppression
of Third World nations. Why?
Registration does not imply that
a registeree will comply with a
summons to serve if the draft is
reinstated. Therefore, regis
tration does not say, "I will
serve." Resisting the draft
says."I object to serving and
will not serve." Resisting regis
tration says."I am choosing to
resist bureaucratic detail and to
commit a felony."
How can a felon or unap
prehended felon voice his or her
voice with popular credibility?
Within the present system of
government, non-violent per

consideration of the facts is
more politically and formally
legitimate than commiting a
felony and attempting to argue
in public view with a bench war
rant issued for your arrest. Sim
ply. the most legal action and
the most politically effective
action within the present milieu
is to register, comply with the
law. then protest and challenge
the status quo. Without an out
standing felony charge, cons
cientious objection can debate
in the public without fear

government ideologically is to
exert power on the Congress,

The ACLU has taken politi
cally powerful approach by util

can be accomplished more legit

simply not filling out a regis

Does filling out a registration
card induce the government to

like the death penalty, is in

fense. other nations will be far
less inclined to attempt a possi
bly costly aggression.
Vladmir Sahkarov, an ex-
KGB agent now living in the
United States, commented in
1979. "The Russians will attack
the United States as long as the
loss of Russian lives can be min
imized. Unless the United
States has the deterrent of ob
servable readiness. Soviet ag
gression will be inevitable" The
death penalty is intended to pro
vide a powerful consequence to
commiting serious crime Reg
istration is simply political in
surance against aggression, not
in support of it. Because the
death penalty exists, are we in
favor of killing American
citizens or preventing crime?
