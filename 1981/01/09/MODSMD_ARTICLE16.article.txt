Growth from grief
Todd Harris misjudged the
Stanford community's response
to the killing of John Lennon
("A Lennon Retrospective,"
(Daily. Jan. 7). Lennon's death
did not "go so unnoticed here."
Just as Rolling Stone's Scott
Spencer writes — and Harris
quotes — "Lennon's death is
everywhere." Everywhere in
cludes Stanford.
Harris correctly notes that
there were no candle-lit vigils in
White Plaza, while people
gathered in public places
throughout other parts of the
world to mourn humanity's loss.
However, this is no reason to
think that people" here did not
also feel that fatal gunshot in
the chest. Like those who were
closest to Lennon. people here
mourned in private.
The reactions were different,
but not entirely because of the
timing. Ironically. Lennon was
shot on the first day of Dead
Week But since the "Stanford
reality" entails term papers
and finals, students felt they
could not neglect their daily re
ality any more than could a
banker or baker. Most stopped
to think, some wept, but every
one carried on. Like many. I felt
a black cloud over my spirits on
Tuesday, but I continued to
study despite the news. I believe
that this response is entirely
consistent with Lennon's
message.
In the recent Playboy in
terview. Lennon summed it up
nicely. He said the story of the
Beatles had a theme: makeyour
own dream.
"It's quite possible to do any
thing. but not to put it on the
leaders and the parking meters

. . . you have to do it yourself."
Perhaps Lennon's death will
bestow his hope and courage
upon his progeny.

Wednesday's Daily, particu
larly the articles on depression
at Stanford and on John Lennon,
have moved me to write this.
What I find depressing, not just
about Stanford, but about the
world, is the lack of dreamers.
There is so little aspiration for
one's day existence.
There is no longing for love,
but rather resignation to sexual
frustration. There is no desire
for quality but rather accep
tance of TV sitcoms. There is no
concern or compassion but rath
er a sensationalist news en
vironment that callouses and
conditions us to increasingly
sordid details of violence.
I find I have to consciously
shield myself from the brutality
and boredom of "normal" life,
in order to hold onto the very ca
pacity to think and feel deeply.
It depresses me that so many
people do not make this effort
for themselves. Sure there is
more pain if you're more sensi
tive to everything around you;
but there is also rapture and lots
to be learned
There is more tp life: there is
as much meaning in your life as
you put there. As Yoko sings,
"Please never be afraid to cry
. . . Don't ever be afraid to fly
.. . Don't be afraid to be
afraid."
