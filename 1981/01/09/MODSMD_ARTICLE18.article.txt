# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Mike Charlson Needed repairs or administrative waste? 
### 
Hev, did you hear? Tuition is
going up another 13.6 percent.
Lucky Stanford students will get
to pay more than $10,000 just for
tuition, room and board next
year.
Now I'm not one of those who
constantly questions whether

my multi-thousand dollar in
vestment is worth it. I firmly
believe it is. Of course, I could
get an outstanding education
across the Bay. for a fraction of
the cost, but I chose to come
here, and I am quite happy.
At the same time, however, I
feel that students have a right to
demand efficient use of our
funds. That's my complaint: I
see a whole lot of waste around
this place.
I find this widespread waste
discouraging because I know
this University is managed by
top-notch people. I know they
generally do a good job. But at
times I have to wonder.
Take the recent repaving of
Santa Teresa Street near Tres
idder. Now no one who ever
traveled the old street would
deny that repaving was long ov
erdue. But did we really need to
widen the street? And are the
pretty curbs and tree planters
worth the expense? And was it
an aesthetic improvement to re
move the retaining wall from in
front of the press loading dock?
I think not in each case. I un
derstand the fact that the street
serves many functions as ser
vice road. parking lot and pedes
trian plaza. But even aesthetic
arguments — arguments which
carry a great deal of weight
with me — do not convince me
that these little extras were nec
essary. I think the area might
have looked very nice had plan
ners kept the shrubs and trees
which previously existed. Of
course, those shrubs had to go to
allow for the wider street and
pedestrian walkway.
It was definitely a mistake to
remove the retaining wall. The
press loading dock and
courtyard area is without a
doubt the biggest eyesore on
campus after the shops on
Bonair Siding. That wall used to
spare unfortunate passersby
from exposure to the filth which
accumulates at the dock. Now,
with the wall removed, visitors
to the Alumni House get a pan

oramic view of the unstacked
pallets, empty boxes and übi
quitous dumpster. How quaint!
Now campus planners assure
me that this eyesore will be
taken care of. Plans are being
drawn right now to landscape
the Press Courtyard and make it
an area suitable to expose to the
public. The cost: $35,000 or
more.
Of course, the landscaping
won't help the loading dock.
Planner Max Mazenko. who said
he was aware that the dock was
an eyesore, said that without the
wall it is now "incumbent upon
those people (the press ware
house workers) to maintain a
cleaner area." Fat chance!
To make matters worse, the
$145,000 budgeted for improve
ments to Santa Teresa and the
Press Courtyard all came from
borrowed money. The operating
budget — which receives half of
its income from tuition — will
be paying off these projects for
years to come, with interest.
No doubt, this year's plant
improvement program will in
clude money for a new chilled
water line which will necessi
tate tearing up the new street.
("est la vie.
Of course we can all point to
examples of waste in construc
tion projects here. It seems that
as soon as something is built, it
is being repaired or replaced.
Unfortunately the repairs are
often worthless as well.
Been in Meyer Library late
ly? I had to drag myself in for
some reserve reading just
before finals last quarter. I was
terribly disappointed to find the
periodicals section doubling as
the Arctic while friends basked
in the 80-degree heat of Area
320.
Remember last year when
the University spent $500,000 to
completely rework the heating
and ventilation system at
Meyer? After years of trying to

fix the original system — a sys
tem which planners admit never
worked — everyone gave up and
decided to start over. But alas,
the new system doesn't work
either.
I heard a student ask a person
at the loan desk to turn off the
heat because people were
sweating on the third floor. The
employee's reponse was that all
he could do was call the central
steam plant and ask them to cut
off the steam. It would take 24
hours for the steam plant to act
on the request. Helluva great
system!
And here's a real sin You
can't even call Operations and
Maintenance (a.k.a. Service
Operations, a.k.a. Plant Ser
vices) to your problem
Why? Because they are inept!
I'm not just saying that. I
have seen it for myself, and so
have lots of other people. I have
been quite active in the com
munity here and know many ad
ministrators. professors, and
students. In five years I have
never heard anyone say any
thing good about Operations and
Maintenance.
In fact, it is widely believed
that if you want a job done right,
you call an outside vendor. They
are often less expensive (Opera
tions and Maintenance charges
departments betweeen $15 and
$30 per man-hour), and outside
vendors do a better job. It's just
sick!
I could go on and on. The bot
tom line is this: Given the high
cost of attending this institu
tion. it is incumbent upon the ad
ministration to put an end to the
waste.
I don't mind spending the
money. I'm convinced the
educational opportunities here
are virtually unlimited. But for
God's sake, don't throw our
money away.
