## Carter pushes federal salary hikes 
### Washington Post 
Washington — President Jim
my Carter recommended
Wednesday that senior officials
of the executive branch and
members of Congress receive
an immediate 16.8 percent pay
raise, a proposal that if ap
proved by Congress would af
fect almost 35,000 top govern
ment employees and cost $183.1
million during the current fiscal
year.
Administration officials said
that Carter, in the budget he will
submit to Congress next week,
will also propose that all gov
ernment employees receive a
5.5 percent pay raise for the fis
cal year that begins Oct. 1.

Pay of senior federal officials
has been frozen for four years.
The pay levels recommended
by the president are substantial
ly less than those that were pro
posed to him last month by the
the nine-member advisory Com
mission on Executive, Legisla
tive and JudiciaJ Salaries,
which urged pay raises for top
government employees ranging
up to 40 percent. Nonetheless,
Carter's proposals, which must
be approved by Congress to take
effect, amount to a sizable part
ing gift to senior officials of the
incoming Reagan adminis
tration and members of Con
gress.
Under the proposal, for exam

ple, the salaries of Cabinet of
ficials would increase from
$69,630 a year to $81,328 The
salaries of members of the
House and Senate would in
crease from $60,662 to $70,853
under the Carter recommenda
tion.
The proposals would affect
800 executive level employees
— the top officials of the ex
ecutive branch — and another
33,500 executive branch of
ficials, including members of
the senior executive service and
GSl4s and 15s, at a cost of $164.4
million this fiscal year. They
would also affect the salaries of
the 535 members of Congress

and a handful of top appointed
officials of the legislative
branch at a cost of $18 7 million
this fiscal year."
Supreme Court decision
The president's pay raise pro
posals, which were submitted to
Congress Wednesday, did not in
clude anything for federal
judges. This was because the Su
preme Court, in a unanimous de
cision last month, granted itself
and other federal judges the 16.8
percent pay raise that Carter
urged now also be granted to top
officials of the other two
branches of the government.
The 16.8 percent figure and
the court decision both grew out
of the same action — the pay cap
imposed on the salaries of sen
ior federal officials by Con
gress. This cap froze the
salaries of officials who were
paid $50,112 or more.
In his message to Congress,
the president noted that while
the salaries of top federal of
ficials have risen by 5.5 percent
since 1977. the consumer price
index as risen by about 45
percent during the same time
and salaries for executives out
side of government by about 25
percent.
To prevent this from happen
ing in the future, Carter urged a
permanent lifting of the pay cap
so that the top officials of the
government would receive cost
of living pay raises at the start
of a fiscal year as other federal
employees have received.
