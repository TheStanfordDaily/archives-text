### Brad Crystal 
President-elect Ronald Reagan, an honorary fellow of
the Hoover Institution, has appointed two Hoover scholars
and a Graduate School of Business professor to the new Of
fice of Policy Coordination, a transition task force of about
30 people that is setting a policy-making agenda for Re
agan's first 100 days in office.
Chosen as director of the task force was Darrell Trent, a
senior research fellow and associate director of the Hoo
ver Institution.
Business School Prof. Henry Rowen was named as
Trent's senior adviser and Richard Staar, another Hoover
Institution senior fellow, was named associate director for
national security.
During the campaign Trent served as Reagan's coordi
nator of economic and domestic policy working groups.
Trent worked closely with senior Hoover fellow Martin
Anderson, who was chief domestic policy adviser during
the campaign.
Last month Anderson became the first Hoover fellow to
be appointed to a full-time post in the new administration
when he was named Reagan's assistant for policy develop
ment.
The main goal of the policy coordination group is to sift
through and analyze reports put together by transition

teams, and then to make recommendations consistent
with Reagan's campaign statements, according to a re
cent San Francisco Examiner article.
Trent, who describes himself as a laissez-faire econo
mist, was a prominent consultant in the Nixon adminis
tration, where he said he "found very few things that gov
ernment can do better than business." Trent was first dep
uty assistant to Nixon in 1969 and in 1973 he became acting
director of the White House Office of Emergency Pre
pardeness.
He has been with the Hoover Institution for the past six
years.
As Trent's senior adviser, Henry Rowen, former presi
dent of the Rand Corp., said he is working in a variety of
energy and national security matters, particularly the
"problems of oil supply security."
Staar, a foreign affairs specialist who is editor of the
Hoover Institution's annual International Communist
Yearbook, declined to comment specifically on his work
on the task force.
The task force is expected to complete its work by In
auguration Day, at which time Trent, Rowen and Staar
will probably return to Stanford, unless they are appointed
to permanent posts.
