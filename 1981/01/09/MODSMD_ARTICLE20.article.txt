### 
Washington (AP) — Terrel
Bell, the man chosen to head the
Education Department, is
steering clear of any disagree
ment with Ronald Reagan over
the incoming president's cam
paign pledge to dismantle the
newest Cabinet agency.
Bell, who was U.S. com
missioner of education from
1974 to 1976, supported the for
mation of the Education De
partment last year, but said
Wednesday in an interview he
took that position mainly be
cause of his desire to reduce the
size of the old Department of
Health, Education and Welfare.
Asked if he agrees with Re
agan's stated plans to abolish
the Education Department, Bell
replied: "I haven't taken a posi
tion on that. I've said we ought
to look at what alternatives
might be."
He refused to say what those
options might include, but there
have been reports Reagan is
considering downgrading the
department to the level of an in
dependent federal agency.
"I don't think it's been
finalized that it (the depart
ment) is going to be abolished,"
said Bell, now Utah's com
missioner of higher education.
Streamline HEW
Bell said his Senate testimony
in favor of the Education De
partment last year grew out of
his desire to have education pro
grams withdrawn from HEW,
which he said was" always
stronger than his wish to see a
new department created.
"I wanted to see an opportuni
ty for the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare to shrink
in size and maybe streamline
their administrative proc
esses," he said. "The size of the
department was so huge it was a
tough management problem for
anyone."
One of the most immediate
problems Bell will face as sec
retary is handling bilingual
education regulations which the
department has drafted to guide
school districts in providing
equal opportunities for students
for whom English is not a pri
mary language.
While he was education com

missioner in 1975, Bell super
vised the drafting of some in
terim bilingual guidelines
which were used while the final
version was drafted. He refused
to characterize the newer
guidelines, which have come un
der heavy fire from members of
Congress who complain that the
regulations would be too ex
pensive and burdensome.
He also declined to talk about
other policy matters during the
interview, saying he would re
serve his responses for Senate
confirmation hearings, which
are likely to be held next week.
The secretary-designate has
served in a variety of federal

education jobs. He was as
sociate education com
missioner from 1970 to 1971 with
responsibility for regional of
fices and acting commissioner
of education for six months in
1970.
Bell studied school adminis
tration as a Ford Foundation
Fellow in 1954-55 at Stanford
University. Born in Lava Hot
Springs, Idaho, he received a
B.A. degree from Southern Ida
ho College of Education in 1946,
an M.S. from the University of
Idaho in 1954 and a Ph.D. in
educational administration
from the Universitv of Utah in
1961.
