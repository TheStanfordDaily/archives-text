# Cards face No. 2 OSU, number-less Ducks
## 
### Chris Haft 
Of Stanford's two Pacific-10 Conference
basketball opponents this weekend, the first
appears impossible to undermine, while the
second is remarkably undermanned.
When the Cardinal men visit Oregon State
tonight, they will face a Beaver squad that
owns both a 10-0 record and more talent than
a room full of Rhodes scholars. Tomorrow
the Cards meet Oregon, which has lost
almost enough players in the past vear-and
a-half to stock a whole team.
Displaying a superstitious bent, Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso has his entourage
housed in Eugene's New Oregon Motel for
the entire trip. Last year, blessed by the
New Oregon's confines, the Cards defeated
Oregon 60-59 for a rare road victory. Usual
ly the team would stay in Corvallis for the
Oregon State game and then travel to
Eugene for the Duck match.
Good luck, however, won't be enough for
Stanford. In fact, against powerful Oregon
State, nothing might forestall the Cards!
doom. The Beavers have all the ingredients
necessary for a luscious basketball concoc
tion: quickness, size, adept ballhandling.
accurate shooting, and astute coaching.
"They just do a lot of things well,"
Dißiaso said of the Beavers. 2-0 in the
Pac-10. "They pass the ball so well that
when they reverse the ball on you ( move the
ball from one side to the other), they get a
15-foot shot instead of a 20-footer "
The Beavers' superior ability to find a
player for a basket shows in the number of
assists they amass — they average 24 .8 per
game, a remarkable figure.
No less remarkable is Steve Johnson, Or
egon State's 6-foot-10'/2 center. Averaging
19.8 points per game, Johnson has made 79
of 101 field goal attempts for an unheard-of

78.2 percentage, exceeding his NCAA re
cord of 71 percent set last season.
The backcourt contains the most multi
talented Beavers, Ray Blume and Mark
Radford. Since both of them stand 6-foot-4.
they also possess fine size for their position.
The superb duo have played together in the
backcourt for four seasons now, and though
their scoring has diminished slightly this
year (Radford averages 11.9 points per
game. Blume 10.9), their skills have not.
F'orwards Jeff Stoutt, one of the better
outside shooters in the conference, and
Charlie Sitton, who Dißiaso called last
year's best high school player on the West
Coast, complete the starting lineup.
It is a lineup well-orchestrated by head
coach Ralph Miller, who has compiled 496
career victories, third most among active
major college coaches in the nation.
' "He (Miller) has who he wants at every
position." Dißiaso said.
Trying to decide how to defense the
Beavers, who established a school single
game field-goal percentage record two
years ago against Stanford (71.1 on 32-of-45
shooting), poses severe problems.
"If we play a sagging man-to
man . . we've done that before, and they
hit their first 10 shots." Dißiaso said. "Then
we could get in their jocks, and they would
hit back-door layups. If we play zone, they'll
shoot the lights out."
Dißiaso has another alternative: repeat
the famous stall that nearly produced an up
set victory in Maples Pavilion last year. To
do that, however, would be to risk a iynching
from the 11,000 or so "Orange Express" fa
natics that will fill Gill Coliseum tonight.
"It sounds like we just shouldn't go."
Dißiaso summed up. chuckling.
However, the Cards will go. if only be

cause they actually have a chance at beating
Oregon. The Ducks have only eight — that's
right, eight — players available.
"The conference hasn't given me per
mission to play yet," Oregon coach Jim
Haney joked.
Four Duck players — all starters at one
time or another — have been sidelined.
Jerome Williams (chipped shoulder blade)
and Gary Gatewood (broken left wrist) are
in jured, Ray Whiting is reportedly enduring
personal problems and is redshirting, and
only yesterday Barry Walker was declared
academically ineligible.
The Ducks endured similar attrition last
year, when Haney. dismayed with the
team's mutinous atmosphere, suspended
two players before the season even began
and ousted two more players in December.
Somehow, the Ducks have compiled a de
cent 7-4 record, though they lost their con
ference games at Arizona and Arizona State
last weekend.
One of Oregon's assets is aggressive 6-
foot-9 center Mike Clark, who averages 15.1
points and 9.5 rebounds per game. "He's a
powerful, physical player," Dißiaso said
respectfully.
Forward John Grieg (11.5 points an out
ing) provides scoring help, as does
freshman guard Fred Cofield (11.4). Felton
Sealey. averaging 9.3 points per game, usu
ally plays well against the Cards.
