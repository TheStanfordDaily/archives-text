## Christmas at NBC Sports: football rules 
### 
Christmas time in New-
York City is more than
Siberian weather, crowded
department stores and debu
tante balls.
At NBC-TV Sports (situ
ated in the heart of Rock
efeller Center) the holidays
are prime time. In a recent
10-dav stretch. NBC covered
three American Football
Conference playoff games,
three college football bowl
games i the Fiesta. Rose and
Orange*, and the UCLA-De-
Paul basketball showdown

sports coverage is filled with

Pete Axthelm. "just like
watching your record

lineup was as gratifying as it
was extensive.

New York studios, the action

designated gambler) and all
purpose host Bryant Gumbel
are fairly straight on the air.

soup in Studio 6A
Last weekend. Gumbel.
Axthelm and countless mil
lions across the country
sweated out a series of
playoff games that can best
be described as bewildering.
The first game was Minne
sota at Philadelphia, the
NFC Central Chumps pitted
against the best team in foot
ball for the first 11 weeks of
the season. Eagle head coach
Dick Vermeil is a highly
emotional sort who likes to
have his team in Super Bowl
form and fervor by October.
Unfortunately, the Super
Bowl is played in January, by
which time the Eagles are
generally plucked.
Last Saturday was Jan. 3,
and predictably, the Eagles
looked shot, or least
wounded. With Minnesota
quarterback Tommy
Kramer throwing for two
scores, the Vikings jumped
to an early 14-0 lead. Had you
taken the Vikes and the seven
points which came with
them, you could all but cash
in your bet. Right?
Wrong! Minnesota — a
team which had only two

turnovers in its last six
games — suddenly conspired
to hand Philly the ball eight
times Even the Eagles can
not resist such largesse.
They win by 15.
Next up was Buffalo at San
Diego — an intriguing
matchup of very big "D"
(Bills) and very, very big
"O" (Chargers). Las Vegas
had installed the Chargers as
a five-and-a-half-point favor
ite. but for the wrong reason.
Buffalo can survive Dan
Fouts and John Jefferson and
Kellen Winslow. but the Bills
can't do without their own
quarterback. Joe Ferguson.
Straddled with a badly
sprained ankle Saturday.
Ferguson was all but im
mobile and simply could not
plant when he threw. None
theless, the Bills led 14-3 at
halftime,
Though the Chargers
looked shaky, they did not
choke. Early in the third pe
riod. they rammed the ball
right up the Bills' zorch,
scoring with ease in four
plays. Gumbel was so dis
gusted he threw his Coke at
the monitor.
It only got worse for him,
much less the Bills. With
barely two minutes to play.
Dan Fouts hit ex-unknown
Ron Smith for 50 yards and

the decisive score. The
Chargers won 20-14 and cov
ered the points.
Sunday's action began in
Cleveland's Tundra Bowl
where the Browns took on the
Raiders for Antarctic su
premacy. Cleveland (fa
vored by three-and-a-half)
got on the board first when
Oakland (and ex-Stanford)
quarterback Jim Plunkett
connected with Cleveland
cornerback Ron Bolton for 42
yards and the game's first
touchdown.
Though Gumbel was
pleased (he loves the
Browns), the Oakland bet
tors at NBC were ready to
hang themselves. Luckily for
their health, the Raiders
came back.
Oakland's splendid secon
dary shut the door on All-
Pro Brian Sipe, while the
heretofore harried Plunkett
suddenly snapped back with
a selection of big plays.
"Plunkett doesn't complete
many passes," Axthelm
said, "but he kills you with
the few he does complete."
Indeed, Plunkett's neat un
derhand pitch to fullback
Mark van Eeghen and his
subsequent 27-yard strike to
tight end Raymond Chester
(both in the final period)
combined to bury the

Browns Mike Davis' last
second interception of Sipe
ended the suspense and
saved the rent for those Oak
land bettors. The Raiders
won 14-12.
The final game of the
weekend, the Cowboys' rous
ing 30-27 upset of Atlanta,
was the best of the four. For
three-and-a-half periods, At
lanta looked like the best
team in the league. But with
six minutes left and a 27-17
lead, the Falcons went to the
prevent defense.
Uh-oh. As they say at NBC,
the prevent prevents noth
ing. By the time you could
say Danny White and Drew
Pearson, the two had com
bined for the TDs that flat
tened the Falcons. Notice
that no one is talking about
Roger Staubach this week.
As soon as the games were
over, Axthelm and friends
were plotting a Sunday
doubleheader first pitting
Philadelphia and Dallas
(CBS-TV, 9:30 a.m. PST)and
then San Diego and Oakland
(NBC-TV, 1:00 p.m.). The
early lines have Philadelphia
a one-point favorite and San
Diego a four-point choice.
A word to the wise (but
this comes from me and not
Axthelm) — take Dallas and
Oakland. «

Last weekend. Gumbel.
Axthelm and countless mil
lions across the country
sweated out a series of
playoff games that can best
be described as bewildering.
The first game was Minne
sota at Philadelphia, the
NFC Central Chumps pitted
against the best team in foot
ball for the first 11 weeks of
the season. Eagle head coach
Dick Vermeil is a highly
emotional sort who likes to
have his team in Super Bowl
form and fervor by October.
Unfortunately, the Super
Bowl is played in January, by
which time the Eagles are
generally plucked.
Last Saturday was Jan. 3,
and predictably, the Eagles
looked shot, or least
wounded. With Minnesota
quarterback Tommy
Kramer throwing for two
scores, the Vikings jumped
to an early 14-0 lead. Had you
taken the Vikes and the seven
points which came with
them, you could all but cash
in your bet. Right?
Wrong! Minnesota — a
team which had only two

turnovers in its last six
games — suddenly conspired
to hand Philly the ball eight
times Even the Eagles can
not resist such largesse.
They win by 15.
Next up was Buffalo at San
Diego — an intriguing
matchup of very big "D"
(Bills) and very, very big
"O" (Chargers). Las Vegas
had installed the Chargers as
a five-and-a-half-point favor
ite. but for the wrong reason.
Buffalo can survive Dan
Fouts and John Jefferson and
Kellen Winslow. but the Bills
can't do without their own
quarterback. Joe Ferguson.
Straddled with a badly
sprained ankle Saturday.
Ferguson was all but im
mobile and simply could not
plant when he threw. None
theless, the Bills led 14-3 at
halftime,
Though the Chargers
looked shaky, they did not
choke. Early in the third pe
riod. they rammed the ball
right up the Bills' zorch,
scoring with ease in four
plays. Gumbel was so dis
gusted he threw his Coke at
the monitor.
It only got worse for him,
much less the Bills. With
barely two minutes to play.
Dan Fouts hit ex-unknown
Ron Smith for 50 yards and

the decisive score. The
Chargers won 20-14 and cov
ered the points.
Sunday's action began in
Cleveland's Tundra Bowl
where the Browns took on the
Raiders for Antarctic su
premacy. Cleveland (fa
vored by three-and-a-half)
got on the board first when
Oakland (and ex-Stanford)
quarterback Jim Plunkett
connected with Cleveland
cornerback Ron Bolton for 42
yards and the game's first
touchdown.
Though Gumbel was
pleased (he loves the
Browns), the Oakland bet
tors at NBC were ready to
hang themselves. Luckily for
their health, the Raiders
came back.
Oakland's splendid secon
dary shut the door on All-
Pro Brian Sipe, while the
heretofore harried Plunkett
suddenly snapped back with
a selection of big plays.
"Plunkett doesn't complete
many passes," Axthelm
said, "but he kills you with
the few he does complete."
Indeed, Plunkett's neat un
derhand pitch to fullback
Mark van Eeghen and his
subsequent 27-yard strike to
tight end Raymond Chester
(both in the final period)
combined to bury the

Browns Mike Davis' last
second interception of Sipe
ended the suspense and
saved the rent for those Oak
land bettors. The Raiders
won 14-12.
The final game of the
weekend, the Cowboys' rous
ing 30-27 upset of Atlanta,
was the best of the four. For
three-and-a-half periods, At
lanta looked like the best
team in the league. But with
six minutes left and a 27-17
lead, the Falcons went to the
prevent defense.
Uh-oh. As they say at NBC,
the prevent prevents noth
ing. By the time you could
say Danny White and Drew
Pearson, the two had com
bined for the TDs that flat
tened the Falcons. Notice
that no one is talking about
Roger Staubach this week.
As soon as the games were
over, Axthelm and friends
were plotting a Sunday
doubleheader first pitting
Philadelphia and Dallas
(CBS-TV, 9:30 a.m. PST)and
then San Diego and Oakland
(NBC-TV, 1:00 p.m.). The
early lines have Philadelphia
a one-point favorite and San
Diego a four-point choice.
A word to the wise (but
this comes from me and not
Axthelm) — take Dallas and
Oakland. «
Christmas time in New-
York City is more than
Siberian weather, crowded
department stores and debu
tante balls.
At NBC-TV Sports (situ
ated in the heart of Rock
efeller Center) the holidays
are prime time. In a recent
10-dav stretch. NBC covered
three American Football
Conference playoff games,
three college football bowl
games i the Fiesta. Rose and
Orange*, and the UCLA-De-
