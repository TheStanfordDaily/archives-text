# Jaworskis four problems: Dallas front line
## 
### 
Tampa, Fla. (AP> — Quarter
back Ron Jaworski has four
problems on his mind as he pre
pares to lead the Philadelphia
Eagles into Sunday's National
Football Conference cham
pionship game against the Dal
las Cowboys.
Not necessarily in this order,
they are:
1. Randy White.
2. Too fall Jones.
3. Harvey Martin.
4. Larry Cole.
White. Jones. Martin and Cole
are the Cowboys' defensive
front four who will be attempt
ing to rush or sack Jaworski in
the battle for the conference
spot in Super Bowl XV at New
Orleans Jan . 25.
"From an offensive stand
point, being the quarterback,
the thing that I'm most con
cerned with is their front four. I
believe that will be the real kev

to the football game." Jaworski
said.
Jaworski, who completed 257
of 451 passes (57 percent) in
directing the Eagles to the con
ference Eastern Division title,
says his protection is going to
have to block Dallas' four down
linemen in passing situations.
The quarterback recalled
that in the second half of the last
game against Dallas, the
Eagles were able to do that.
"We got about 280 to 290 yards
in the air in that second half, so
that my main concern is that my
guys up front are able to keep
those people away from me to
be able to get the ball down
field." Jaworski said.
The Eagles came to Tampa
Tuesday to escape the frozen
north and work out under the
temperate Florida weather con
ditions.

Jaworski isn't unaware that
his job against Dallas will be
tougher because of injuries that
have sidelined two of the
Eagles' top three wide re
ceivers. Charley Smith is out
with a broken jaw. and his re
lief, Scott Fitzke, is on crutches
with a broken foot.
"We do have some problems
at the wide receiver spot,"
Jaworski said. "It's going to be
important that Rodney Parker
(a free agent wide out) come up
with a big game."
Jaworski said he felt that
Parker had the ability to fill the
void.
"He showed that in the second
Dallas game . . . making some
big, big catches," Jaworski
said. "Of course there was the
one that he caught for a touch
down that put us ahead in that

point differential that enabled
us to win the division."
Dallas and the Eagles each
posted 12-4 regular season re
cords, but the Eagles earned the
championship on the basis of
more points scored in intra
division competition.'
"Right now we're still up in
the air as far as who the third
guy (wide receiver) is going to
be. I think . . . you'll see (run
ning back-special teamer)
Louie Giammona as the third
receiver," Jaworski observed.
The Eagles and Cowboys split
their regular season two-game
series, each winning at home.
How does Jaworski feel about
the chances of the Eagles win
ning the odd game out?
"It can be done, there is no
question about it," Jaworski

said. "We're there and we've
just got to find a way to win this
football game.
"The Dallas Cowboys are a
great football team and so are
the Philadelphia Eagles ... We
just have to go out there and ex
ecute better than the Cowboys."
Jaworski's passes accounted
for 3 529 yards in the regular
season. He tossed 27 touchdown
passes. It easily was the best
season for the one-time Youngs
town State quarterback, a sec
ond-round draft choice of the
Los Angeles Rams in 1973. He
came to the Eagles in 1977. in
exchange for the rights to tight
end Charles Young.
Jaworski admitted that he set
a dream this year of being the
quarterback of a Super Bowl
team. He's 60 minutes from
making that dream a reality.

How does Jaworski feel about
the chances of the Eagles win
ning the odd game out?
"It can be done, there is no
question about it," Jaworski

said. "We're there and we've
just got to find a way to win this
football game.
"The Dallas Cowboys are a
great football team and so are
the Philadelphia Eagles ... We
just have to go out there and ex
ecute better than the Cowboys."
Jaworski's passes accounted
for 3 529 yards in the regular
season. He tossed 27 touchdown
passes. It easily was the best
season for the one-time Youngs
town State quarterback, a sec
ond-round draft choice of the
Los Angeles Rams in 1973. He
came to the Eagles in 1977. in
exchange for the rights to tight
end Charles Young.
Jaworski admitted that he set
a dream this year of being the
quarterback of a Super Bowl
team. He's 60 minutes from
making that dream a reality.
Tampa, Fla. (AP> — Quarter
back Ron Jaworski has four
problems on his mind as he pre
pares to lead the Philadelphia
Eagles into Sunday's National
Football Conference cham
pionship game against the Dal
las Cowboys.
Not necessarily in this order,
they are:
1. Randy White.
2. Too fall Jones.
3. Harvey Martin.
4. Larry Cole.
White. Jones. Martin and Cole
are the Cowboys' defensive
front four who will be attempt
ing to rush or sack Jaworski in
the battle for the conference
spot in Super Bowl XV at New
Orleans Jan . 25.
"From an offensive stand
point, being the quarterback,
the thing that I'm most con
cerned with is their front four. I
believe that will be the real kev

to the football game." Jaworski
said.
Jaworski, who completed 257
of 451 passes (57 percent) in
directing the Eagles to the con
ference Eastern Division title,
says his protection is going to
have to block Dallas' four down
linemen in passing situations.
The quarterback recalled
that in the second half of the last
game against Dallas, the
Eagles were able to do that.
"We got about 280 to 290 yards
in the air in that second half, so
that my main concern is that my
guys up front are able to keep
those people away from me to
be able to get the ball down
field." Jaworski said.
The Eagles came to Tampa
Tuesday to escape the frozen
north and work out under the
temperate Florida weather con
ditions.

Jaworski isn't unaware that
his job against Dallas will be
tougher because of injuries that
have sidelined two of the
Eagles' top three wide re
ceivers. Charley Smith is out
with a broken jaw. and his re
lief, Scott Fitzke, is on crutches
with a broken foot.
"We do have some problems
at the wide receiver spot,"
Jaworski said. "It's going to be
important that Rodney Parker
(a free agent wide out) come up
with a big game."
Jaworski said he felt that
Parker had the ability to fill the
void.
"He showed that in the second
Dallas game . . . making some
big, big catches," Jaworski
said. "Of course there was the
one that he caught for a touch
down that put us ahead in that

point differential that enabled
us to win the division."
Dallas and the Eagles each
posted 12-4 regular season re
cords, but the Eagles earned the
championship on the basis of
more points scored in intra
division competition.'
"Right now we're still up in
the air as far as who the third
guy (wide receiver) is going to
be. I think . . . you'll see (run
ning back-special teamer)
Louie Giammona as the third
receiver," Jaworski observed.
The Eagles and Cowboys split
their regular season two-game
series, each winning at home.
