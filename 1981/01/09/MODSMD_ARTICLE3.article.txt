Investment alternatives yielding
higher returns should be available to
Stanford faculty, according to a report
of the Committee on Faculty and Staff
Benefits presented yesterday to the
Faculty Senate. The Senate also heard
a report by J. Myron Atkin, dean of the
School of Education, on recent de
velopments in the school and in the
field of education in general.
The Committee on Faculty and
Staff Benefits and the Task Force on
Retirement Policies recommended
that investment alternatives to
TIAA/CREF (Teachers' Insurance
and Annuity Association/College Re
tirement Equity Fund), the Univer
sity's retirement plan, be made avail
able to Stanford faculty and staff.
Committee member Jack
McDonald said $1000 invested in

CREF ten years ago would now be
worth only $1400. He cited another
plan that yielded $2400 on the same in
vestment.
Thus he said the committee believes
that faculty and staff should be given
freedom of choice among
TIAA/CREF and a number of other al
ternatives.
President Donald Kennedy said he
accepts the recommendation and will
appoint an ad hoc group to explore the
alternatives. "We're going to try to
get it done as fast as we can," he said.
Reporting on the School of Educa
tion, Atkin recounted its estab
lishment in 1917, and said the school
today has 40 tenured and tenure-track
faculty.
Approximately 450 students are en
rolled, most of them women and all of
them at the graduate level, he said

Approximately 30 percent of the stu
dents are from abroad.
The School of Education is still
quite visible and influential in arts
education, physical and health educa
tion and social studies, but has lost
ground elsewhere, according to Atkin.
He cited as weaknesses a dwindling
presence in curriculum fields as
sociated with elementary and secon
dary school teaching, like
mathematics education and science
education.
Problems facing all education
schools today include a distressingly
low academic ability of those entering
teaching, according to Atkins. He
quoted one statistic that said in 1979,
college-bound high-school seniors who
intended to teach scored an average of
392 on their SAT Verbal exams.
He said teaching has become less

lesirable due to the fact that starting
alaries of teachers are lower than
hose for any other college graduates
ixcept social workers. Violence in the
schools and limited opportunities for
advancement also make teaching less
attractive.
In other business, the Senate unani
mously approved the list of candidates
for Baccalaureate and Advanced
Degrees submitted by the Committees
on Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment and Graduate Studies.
Provost Albert Hastorf reported
that a Task Force in regard to Cable
Television is being formed. Some Pe
ninsula communities have contracts
with cable television and the question
has arisen as to whether the Stanford
campus should also join the cable ser
vice.
