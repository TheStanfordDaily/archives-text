## San Francisco: land of lattes and espresso

Caffe Flore
22M Market St. at Noe

H2I
No more than two blocks
from Castro and Market, you
might expect Cafe Flore to be
primarily a gay coffeehouse.
Surprisingly enough, however,
the atmosphere in the Flore
seems to change by the hour.
Early in the day.it is often a
gathering place for the leather
chains-and-safety-pin crowd. As
the afternoon wears on. some
gays, wearing regulation

moustaches, jeans and t-shirts
may walk in, or some members
of the up-and-coming business
elite in their late 20s and early
30s. or whatever.
The Flore faces onto Market
with a large expanse of win
dows. giving the tables inside a
panorama of the street. A small
yard with picnic tables in front,
and a few benches on the side
complete the furnishings. The
waitresses dress as if they are
on their way to a night club, and
look somewhat out of place bus
ing tables in that sort of attire,
high boots and all. But they
serve a good cappucino, and
their regular coffee is good, too,

though it lacks body They serve
beer, wine and pastries as well
When I was there, interview
ing a source for a story, con
versation inside the cafe was
made difficult by the loud taped
rock music that might have
been most welcome under other
circumstances.

Along much more mellow,
lower-pressured lines is the
Mission Blue Cafe Located in
lower Bernal Heights, the at
mosphere is more intimate and
cozy than the glassy Cafe Flore.
The clientele is of a less am
bivalent character, too — a mix
ture of the post-SDS Left and the
lower-income population of the
area.
The Mission Blue plays host
to a variety of local folk artists
and other musicians who per
form often on the stage at the
end of the coffee room. The fre
quent poetry readings and polit

ical benefits lend the Mission
Blue the stereotypical image of
the European intellectual cof
feehouse or the kind of place
that would attract a person who
got his history major from San
ta Cruz in 1970 Stanford stu
dents may notice some ele
ments of the ASSU Coffeehouse
in the dark niches and the earth
mother aura.
The beverages, too. are com
fortable Espresso and regular
coffee drinks, such as cappuc
cino. are made well They
steam apple cider, and offer a
good selection of teas. Sand
wiches. too. are made. Lattc is
95 cents, espresso 65 cents.
Noteworthy, too. is that an
"anarchist coffeehouse" is held
there about once a month for
people of the state-less per
suasion to meet and talk

Yet another kind of tone is set
when you enter the Cafe Com
mons The clean lines of the
room, the window onto the south
Mission District, the whiteness
of the walls — all lend a modern
cast to the room. 11 incorporates
features of a restaurant (a fair
ly extensive menu of quiche,
soup, sandwiches and desserts)
an<j.a library, with copies of lo
cal newspapers and more exotic
ones like lia iron's or the Ni'ir
York Times Review of Hooks for
patrons to read through Much
more than the Flore or the Mis
sion Blue, this would be an easy
coffeehouse to go to at 9 a.m. to
read an economics book; it is
geared toward hanging out.
When I was there, for a business
meeting, we stayed for four and
half hours, ordering between us
two cups of coffee, a soft drink
and a bowl of soup.
The music is non-obtrusive
and blends well with the gener
ally unharried pace of the Com
mons. Latte is 95 cents,
espresso 65 cents.
