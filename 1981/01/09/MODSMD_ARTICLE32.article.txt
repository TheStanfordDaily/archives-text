If you want both hot food and a "hot"
time, La Fortuna should be high on your list.
Inexpensive, genuine Mexican food is
served up in a homey atmosphere here. The
modest decor, consisting of Mexican paint
ings and natural wooden furnishings, adds
to the authenticity of the popular estab
lishment.
La opened on El Camino 27 years
ago, but has operated in Redwood City for
the past 20 years.

It is difficult not to feel immediately com
fortable at La Fortuna We recognized sev
eral Stanford students at this eatery Many
families also seemed to be enjoying the fes
tive atmosphere.
On our pre-Christmas visit, small lights
and candles were placed throughout the one
room restaurant.
Our waitress was not overly fluent in
English, blit she served our orders correct
ly
Fortunately we asked for water — the

cooking here may seem a little spicy for the
uninitiated palate. Beverages include Mexi
can beer ($1.25), American beer (75 cents),
tea. soft drinks and Mexican hot chocolate
($1.00).
Our spicy dinner began with a Mexican
restaurant standard — a small wooden bowl
of tortilla chips, accompanied by an ex
tremely peppery tortilla sauce. Tortilla
chip aficionados should savor the chips,
however, since the bowl is not refilled.
We began our meal with nachos ($3). The
traditional Mexican appetizer was a spicy
blend of beans, cheese and chile peppers
atop thick chips The cheese was good but

needed slightly more melting.
Next on the agenda were small salads
garnished with radishes, tomatoes and pep
per.
After the spicy beginning to the meal, we
welcomed the bland corn and flour tortillas
which accompanied our entrees — they
were warm and delicious.
Entree choices range from low-cal steak
to burritos to enchiladas to tacos to tostados
to chile rellertos. In addition, breakfast is
served anytime.

Kntrees. attractively placed on large oval
dishes, were prepared to order and served
quickly. Customary Mexican hot rice and
beans accompanied each meal — they were
a steaming asset to the main courses. The
beans were saucy, smooth and topped with
parmesan cheese.
The beef tostada ($3.50 for the dinner in
cluding two. $2.75 for the dinner including
one and $1.25 for a la carte) was brimming
with meat For those not used to the spice of
the other entrees, the tostada is a wise
choice. It was declared a zestv treat.
Another of our choices, the hot enchiladas
verdes (s4t. was an extremely peppery
blend of cheese, green peppers and onions.
The enchiladas were made with a green
tomato and hot green chile sauce and topped
with avocado slices.
The cheese enchilada ($3.50 for a com
plete meal of two) was another fine exam
ple of authentic Mexican cuisine.
Bunuelos with sugar and cinnamon (35
cents) and bunuelos with Mexican syrup (75
cents) are the dessert offerings.
About 60 people almost filled the one
room restaurant. The atmosphere was
bustling and busy, and no one had to wait for
a table. No reservations are needed. Take
out orders are also available but do not in
clude tostaditas and tortillas.
The overall air here seemed cheerful, as
we listened to the buzz of loud voices We
saw a tape deck by the cash register but no
music was playing on our visit.
In all. you are guaranteed to leave La For
tuna in fine spirits. But be forewarned that
your breath may not be at its best after
sampling this spicy cuisine!

The beef tostada ($3.50 for the dinner in
cluding two. $2.75 for the dinner including
one and $1.25 for a la carte) was brimming
with meat For those not used to the spice of
the other entrees, the tostada is a wise
choice. It was declared a zestv treat.
Another of our choices, the hot enchiladas
verdes (s4t. was an extremely peppery
blend of cheese, green peppers and onions.
The enchiladas were made with a green
tomato and hot green chile sauce and topped
with avocado slices.
The cheese enchilada ($3.50 for a com
plete meal of two) was another fine exam
ple of authentic Mexican cuisine.
Bunuelos with sugar and cinnamon (35
cents) and bunuelos with Mexican syrup (75
cents) are the dessert offerings.
About 60 people almost filled the one
room restaurant. The atmosphere was
bustling and busy, and no one had to wait for
a table. No reservations are needed. Take
out orders are also available but do not in
clude tostaditas and tortillas.
The overall air here seemed cheerful, as
we listened to the buzz of loud voices We
saw a tape deck by the cash register but no
music was playing on our visit.
In all. you are guaranteed to leave La For
tuna in fine spirits. But be forewarned that
your breath may not be at its best after
sampling this spicy cuisine!
