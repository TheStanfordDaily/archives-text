How many different ways
can omelettes be prepared''
We thought about 20 — until
we saw the 350 combinations
listed in The Cookbook's
menu
And according to Stanley
Roberts, vice-presi
dent/general manager of the
three Cookbook restaurants,
the kitchen really offers
more than lOOOomeiettes, all
made with four extra-large
eggs Unsurprisingly. Rob
erts said that The Cookbook
in Prunevard uses 35.000
eggs per week.
The amazingly large menu
features several hundred en
trees which are served from
7a m to 10p.m. seven daysa
week Breakfast, lunch and
dinner entrees are available
throughout the day.
The restaurant, which
opened in Town and Country
Village just a month ago.
seats 154 There were few pa
trons on our visit only 10 days
after The Cookbook opened
Roberts hopes to appeal
particularly to students with
the long hours and casual at
mosphere of the estab
lishment. The Cookbook even
sports pictures of Stanford
on its walls. Gingham cur
tains. small booths and
wooden tables seemed de
signed for a pleasant dining
atmosphere.
Somewhat overwhelmed
by the huge menu, we de
cided on the crabmeat Vic
torian sandwich and the
Mexican scramble from our
gingham-aproned waitress.
The crabmeat Victorian
($4.35) consisted of chilled
shredded crabmeat on an
English muffin, alfalfa
sprouts and a fresh pineapple
slice, topped with melted
cheddar cheese. The_ crab
tasted unfresh We found the

sandwich to be slightly
bland, but fruit and potato
salad attractively com
plemented the dish
The Mexican scramble
($3.95) was a rather unique
combination (We had ex
pected a traditional egg dish
with a spicy sauce.) Three
eggs with green beans and
onions were served in a bowl
and topped with cheddar
The interesting mixture is
not for anyone squeamish
about tasting green beans in
an omelette. The dish is
served with hash browns
Although we hungrily an
ticipated the cornbread
which Roberts said accom
panies all meals, ours never
arrived But we did receive
an abundant dish of onion
rings ($95).

We felt gluttonous but
could not resist the dessert
descriptions. A mouth-wa
tering. rich German choco
late cake with coconut icing
($115) and a bowl of fresh
watermelon, grapes and
melon topped off our meal.
For those interested in a less
calorific ending, coffee
ground on the premises is
also available. Other
beverages range from
freshly squeezed orange and
grapefruit juice to hot choco
late to wine.
Reservations are not
needed.
