"As good as the food in
Bangkok" — that's how
KPIX-TV Evening Magazine
described this exquisite Thai
restaurant
Inside the Khan Toke Thai
House, my companion and 1
settled comfortably on red
pillows around a iow. dark
wood table. Minutes later we
sipped a refreshing drink It
was chilled Singha Stout, a
full, honev-colored beer de
livered by a waiter garbed in
a close-fitting, tailored jacket
and genie-like pantaloons He
had approached us across the
red carpet in stocking feet
and kneeled to serve us.
Under the table, our feet
also lacked shoes. It is the
custom when dining in the
style of the Royal Thai Palace
that guests disrobe their feet
at the door so they can enjoy a
lounging posture during the
tantalizihg meal Guests can
also opt to sit in sunken booths
of beautifully carved
teak wood tables.
The dining style in the Khan
Toke Thai House includes soft
lighting that highlights a de
cor ot rich reds tinged with
gold Figurines, some of the
Buddha, flowers and candles
dress up the alcoves of indi
vidual dining areas. Cur
tained picture windows gave
us an outside view to a hidden
garden Elaborate-looking
serving dishes and vessels

catch the eye as do the
servers in traditional Thai
costume
This restaurant offers a
sense of adventure and a
friendly attitude so that we
were not hesitant to ask about
the contents or the seasoning
of the food
Rangson. the owner, serves
customers himself. In a Thai
restaurant where we were un
familiar with spices and
methods of preparation, we
surely needed suggestions.
Thai chiles, found in many
dishes, can be hotter than
fireballs. Their effects are
best soothed when followed
bv a dish accented with a
mildly sweet puree of peanuts
and coconut milk
Thai cookery is character
ized by a mystique of original
spices We discovered deli
cately flavored herb sauces
and hot. spicy sauces just
lightly applied.. Favorite
herbs vary from ginger to
basil to curry to coriander to
mint. Special Thai ingre
dients include lemon grass,
peanuts and coconut milk
Thai food is a scenario of
Chinese-stvle dishes. How

ever, the Thai eat with silver
ware rather than chopsticks,
and the taste is also quite dif
ferent But the cuisines of
China. South Asia and India
influenced the Thai, particu
larly in the use of curries.
The dishes here exemplify
the preferences of many dif
ferent regions. Nur Num Tok
($3.25) is a spicy beef salad
dish from southern Thailand
It consisted of thinly sliced
beef on a small bed of
shredded lettuce and gar
nished with radishes.
Satea ($3.95) is a skewered
beef appetizer served with
finely ground peanut sauce
and a sweet and sour
cucumber sauce. The sauces
are each distinctly flavored
and textured.
Tod Mun ($3.45) was a de
lightfully light, thin fried fish
cake with green beans,
smothered in the sweet
cucumber sauce.
Ped Nun Chao ($4.95), roast
duck pieces sauteed with
spinach and celery, is another
example of the exotic prepa
ration here. The Nun Chao
sauce is a glaze made from
the duckling drippings and a

touch of sugar. Although
spiced and pleasingly mild,
this main dish is very tasty
and succulent
The Chef Favorite ($5.95)
was one of ours as well. This
main dish is a bountiful serv
ing of prawns, pork and bean
cakes in a spicy secret sauce.
11 provides a small bite of eve
rything.
The best treat of all is the
Kung Ten ($6.75). a main dish
of giant prawns stuffed with
ground pork and spiced with
coriander root, black pepper
and garlic. The prawns lie
decorated with orange and
cucumber slices and radish
(lowers on lettuce leaves.
Looking back at the menu,
we recognized only a few des
serts. Banana fritters, typical
San Franciscan fare, are
Thai-style here. The fritters
were lightly fried, almost as
if they had been steamed
crisp, and topped with a honey
glaze and fresh coconut. The
other desserts surprised us.
Thai custard is a square of
sweet gelatin, and banana
custard is a creamy white
pudding. Special ice cream
and jack fruits remained

mysteries to be tried next vis
it. And a truly unique drink
was a coffee-tea blend.
Treat follows treat at the
Khan Toke Thai House. But
before the dessert and in be
tween courses come stories
and explanations courtesy of
Kangsan. an agreeable,
cheerful host. Areewan,
Rangsan's wife, never misses
a night of cooking at the Khan
Toke Thai House. Areewan
has 20 years of experience and
cooks almost every dish.
Most of the Thai dishes are
cooked to order, the perfect
result of much practice.
Marinades are popular to add
flavor and tenderize the
meats. The spices seep in un
der the careful scrutiny of the
chef. Areewan herself
chooses the imported spices.
The Khan Toke Thai House
offers a complete six-course
meal in the royal Thai style
with beverage for $9.95 per
person This includes an ap
petizer. choice of salad, soup,
choice of two entrees and
Thai dessert.
Weekends demand reserva
tions since the restaurant
holds only'about 70 people.
Dinner hours are 5 p.m. to 11
p.m.. seven days a week.
Weeknights are best. Also.
Sundays feature a weekly spe
cial. entertainment and spe
cial showings of films of Thai
land.
We left full, satisfied and

The dishes here exemplify
the preferences of many dif

($3.25) is a spicy beef salad
dish from southern Thailand
It consisted of thinly sliced
beef on a small bed of
shredded lettuce and gar
nished with radishes.
Satea ($3.95) is a skewered
beef appetizer served with
finely ground peanut sauce
and a sweet and sour
cucumber sauce. The sauces
are each distinctly flavored

Tod Mun ($3.45) was a de
lightfully light, thin fried fish
cake with green beans,
smothered in the sweet
cucumber sauce.
Ped Nun Chao ($4.95), roast
duck pieces sauteed with
spinach and celery, is another
example of the exotic prepa
ration here. The Nun Chao
sauce is a glaze made from
the duckling drippings and a

touch of sugar. Although
spiced and pleasingly mild,
this main dish is very tasty
and succulent

The best treat of all is the
Kung Ten ($6.75). a main dish
of giant prawns stuffed with

coriander root, black pepper
and garlic. The prawns lie
decorated with orange and
cucumber slices and radish
(lowers on lettuce leaves.
Looking back at the menu,
we recognized only a few des
serts. Banana fritters, typical
San Franciscan fare, are
Thai-style here. The fritters
were lightly fried, almost as
if they had been steamed
crisp, and topped with a honey
glaze and fresh coconut. The
other desserts surprised us.
Thai custard is a square of

custard is a creamy white
pudding. Special ice cream

was a coffee-tea blend.

cooked to order, the perfect
