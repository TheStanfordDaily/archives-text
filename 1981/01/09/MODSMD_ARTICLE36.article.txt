One of Hitchcock's master
pieces. and — I'm perfectly seri
ous — one of the greatest movies
the cinema has produced. Even af
ter many viewings have reduced
its suspense, this film fascinates
with its incredible command of
film form, its perverse wit, and its
dark vision of an empty society.
It's one of the most influential
films of the last two decades: it
has been endlessly imitated, but
its richness of theme and detail
have never been matched
Hitchcock's genius is for implicat
ing his audience in the crimes of
his characters — we are placed in
the role of first an impulsive thief
and then a psychotic. Both.
Hitchcock suggests, are equally
possible states of mankind.
Anthony Perkins gives a
brilliant performance as Norman
Bates, a young man with family
problems. The incredibly
evocative score, composed entire
ly for strings, is by Bernard Her
rmann Janet Leigh and Vera
Miles are also featured

The script is slight — an uncer

unexpectedly fine comic ensemble

who declare war on their idiot
male boss Fonda's a bit unsure of
herself, but she plays against type

and unabashedly earnest that you
smile regardless of what she's

One of Hitchcock's master
pieces. and — I'm perfectly seri
ous — one of the greatest movies
the cinema has produced. Even af
ter many viewings have reduced
its suspense, this film fascinates
with its incredible command of
film form, its perverse wit, and its
dark vision of an empty society.
It's one of the most influential
films of the last two decades: it
has been endlessly imitated, but
its richness of theme and detail
have never been matched
Hitchcock's genius is for implicat
ing his audience in the crimes of
his characters — we are placed in
the role of first an impulsive thief
and then a psychotic. Both.
Hitchcock suggests, are equally
possible states of mankind.
Anthony Perkins gives a
brilliant performance as Norman
Bates, a young man with family
problems. The incredibly
evocative score, composed entire
ly for strings, is by Bernard Her
