Begin may resign over economy
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin s frag
ile parliamentary coalition majority moved closer to col
lapse yesterday as attempts to resoive an interministerial
impasse over the deteriorating economy failed and Begin
himself began sending out signals that he will resign if any
of his Cabinet ministers decide to defect over the weekend.
Begin, who earlier in the week said that even if he lost a
parliamentary vote of confidence he would remain in the
premiership in a minority government, reportedly has
told his closest aides that he will resign if either of two
Cabinet members threatening to quit actually does so on
Sunday.
By handing in his resignation, sources close to the prime
minister said. Begin may head off an opposition Labor
Party move to dissolve the Knesset (parliament). The op
position is preparing to introduce such a motion next Tues
day.
Education Minister Zevelun Hammer and Finance Min
ister Yigael Hurvitz both vowed to quit the government —
and take their coalition partners with them — if they do not
prevail in a Cabinet vote Sunday on a controversial pro
posal to increase the salaries of Israel's teachers by 30 to
60 percent.
Former CIA agent sentenced
Baltimore — Former CIA agent David Barnett was sen
tenced yesterday to 18 years in prison for selling informa
tion. including the names of 30 U.S. operatives and seven
potential double agents, to Soviet spies for $92,600.
Barnett could have received a life term for his guilty
plea to a single count of transmitting secrets to a foreign
power. He will be eligible for parole in six years.
U.S. District Judge Frank Kaufman said he was impos
ing a shorter sentence because Barnett had cooperated
fullv with the FBI and the CIA after entering his plea last
Oct. 29.
Barnett, of Bethesda. Md.. admitted revealing the
names of seven Soviet consulate officers the CIA had
sought to recruit as double agents and the identity of 30
covert CIA operatives and several foreign collaborators
with the CIA.
The government has never revealed what happened to
the people Barnett identified, but prosecutors said they
were endangered.
"Obviously the Soviet Union thought (the secrets) had
some utility because they paid good hard United States
currency for the information.'' said U.S. Attorney David
Queen.
Watt, Stockman testify before Senate
Washington — Ronald Reagan's controversial nominee
as secretary of the interior yielded to environmentalist at
tacks yesterday and signed a conflict-of-interest
statement pledging that he will not take part in federal de
cisions that could directly benefit his legal clients of the
past 3 1 2 years.
James Watt has been the director of the Mountain States
Legal Foundation in Denver, a tax-exempt public-interest
law firm that has represented ranching and development
interests that often do business — and frequently do battle
— with the Department of the Interior.
His association with the conservative legal group, which
often has joined in suits against the Department of the In
terior. has drawn the wrath of the nation's largest environ
mental and conservation organizations'during Watt's con
firmation hearings before the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee this week.
Watt signed the statement late yesterday as the hear

ings neared their end The action was announced by com
mittee Chairman James McClure (R-Idaho) who said
Watt responded to the urging of Sen Henrv Jackson (D-
Wash.) the ranking Democrat on the committee.
Another Reagan appointee had smoother sailing yester
day. David Stockman, the Michigan congressman chosen
to be director of the Office of Management and Budget,
faced no opposition during his four-hour appearance
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
Poles may strike over 5-day week
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's largest independent union
yesterday demanded a five-day work week and some local
chapters instructed members to stay home tomorrow,
raising the specter of a nationwide union-government con
frontation.
In another development, Warsaw Television said there
were signs of 'anarchy" in scattered Polish towns includ
ing W'loclawek. Jelenia Gora. Krosno, Olsztyn.
Czestochowa and Torun.
It claimed "open pressure" was being exerted on local
authorities to force leadership changes and added, "This
is simply a display of noisy anarchy hindering the develop
ment of public law and order."
Although the national union federation Solidarity vowed
during a meeting in Gdansk to defend its demand for free
Saturdays, it stopped short of threatening a nationwide
strike. The action was taken despite the government's
claim that a 40-hour work week would further cripple the
nation's economy.
Most Poles now work a six-dav. 46-hour week of five
eight-hour days and a sixth, six-hour day.
Solidarity's determination to gain free Saturdays was
the first major threat to the relative calm that has pre
vailed in Poland since last December, when Soviet and So
viet-bloc troops massed on Poland's borders, raising fears
of military intervention.
Western and Czechoslovak sources said, however, that
military activity along Czechoslovakia's border with Po
land has decreased.
Mexico union vote set after riots
Tijuana, Mexico — In the wake of three days of campus
violence, officials of Autonomous University of Baja Cali
fornia and members of two striking unions agreed yester
day to poll university employees to settle a dispute over
unionization.
The union elections, scheduled for next week, could end
a two-month-old strike that has shut down this Mexican
state university system, which is attended by more than
30.000 students.
The decision to hold the union elections came on the
heels of a violent confrontation in Mexicali Wednesday be
tween striking teachers and service workers. Gunfire
wounded at least one person, and a building and at least
seven cars were set afire.
Striking teachers and workers had occupied buildings at
each of the four university campuses — Mexicali, Tijuana,
Enseneda and Tecate — until this week when bands of
strikebreakers and purported undercover agents hired by
the government retook the buildings by force.
Most of the strikers are believed to be members of the
Socialist and Communist parties. The strikebreakers re
portedly were members of Mexico's ruling political group,
the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
Brown calls for 10% spending cut
Sacramento — Declaring it is "simply not possible" to
continue state spending at current levels. Gov. Jerry

Brown said yesterday state operations in the coming year
must be cut 10 percent compared to inflation
In his annual address to the Legislature. Brown painted
a gloomy picture of state finances and said the lawmakers
face "painful choices" to balance the 1981-82 budget
without a tax increase.
The response to the Democratic governor's 9'2-minute
address was restrained and predictable.
Republicans labeled it as a speech of empty rhetoric.
Some Democrats praised Brown for offering a realistic
approach to the state's budget problems, but both Demo
crat and Republican legislators objected to his proposed
cuts in school, local government and welfare programs.
Brown said the budget bill he will submit to the Legisla
ture on Saturday will propose an increase of only 0.2
percent in spending on general state operations, which
"will fall 10 percent below the rate of inflation.
"That means painful choices that we have to make to
gether." Brown said.
Although the speech lacked specific details about
Brown's proposals for state spending, it confirmed the ac
counts in recent days of his intention to cut spending in the
coming year
"It is simply not possible to fund state and local govern
ments at their historic rate," Brown said.
"From an historic vantage point, we have reached a wa
tershed. For the first time since World War 11. state gov
ernment spending will clearly not keep pace with infla
tion." he added.
Soviets launch huge nuclear sub
Washington — The Soviet Union has surprised the U.S.
intelligence community bv launching a new cruise missile
firing submarine that will make American aircraft car
riers 10 times more vulnerable than they are now. Navy
officials disclosed yesterday.
The jumbo submarine, code-named Oscar, is almost
twice the sizeof the largest U.S. attack sub now at sea. and
when in service will extend the lethal reach of Soviet anti
carrier forces from today's 20 miles to 200 miles, they
said.
Oscar is not bigger than the biggest U.S. submarine, the

Trident But the Trident is a ballistic missile sub, which
has adifferent mission The Soviets also havea larger ver
sion of that type, called the Typhoon
Attack submarines are designed to sneak up on other
submarines or surface ships and destroy them before
being detected. Quietness, speed and diving depth often
decide who wins this deadly battle of hide-and-seek.
Critics of the main U.S. attack sub. the Los Angeles class,
argue that its size is a drawback; that smaller subs would
be harder for the enemy to find. Oscar suggests Soviet
naval leaders have not bought that argument.
Missile subs are basically underwater launching plat
forms for ICBMs. Here, too. the Soviet high command has
gone the United States one better in size The new U.S. Tri
dent missile submarine, longer than the Washington Mon
ument is high, has been more than matched by the Soviets'
new Typhoon, which is about 50 percent bigger than Tri
dent. according to analysts.
" Worst-casers" at the Pentagon warn that several Os
car submarines could surround a U.S. aircraft carrier,
World War II wolfpack-style, and bombard it and escort
ing warships with accurate cruise missiles.
Stocks fall for second day
New York — The stock market suffered heavy losses for
the second straight session yesterday, still reeling from
the effects of a well-known investment adviser's "sell"
recommendation.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 15.19 to
965.70. on top of Wednesday's 23.80dr0p.
New York Stock Exchange volume dropped off to 55.35
million shares from Wednesday's record total of 92.89 mil
lion.
The decline began on Wednesday after Joseph Granville
of Holly Hill. P" 1 a., recommended that subscribers to his
telephone "early warning service" sell all their stocks.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy with haze and fog through tomorrow. A
chance of rain today. Rain likely tomorrow. Lows in the
upper 30s and 40s. Highs in the 50s to low 60s. Light winds.

power. He will be eligible for parole in six years.
U.S. District Judge Frank Kaufman said he was impos
ing a shorter sentence because Barnett had cooperated
fullv with the FBI and the CIA after entering his plea last
Oct. 29.
Barnett, of Bethesda. Md.. admitted revealing the
names of seven Soviet consulate officers the CIA had
sought to recruit as double agents and the identity of 30
covert CIA operatives and several foreign collaborators
with the CIA.
The government has never revealed what happened to
the people Barnett identified, but prosecutors said they
were endangered.
"Obviously the Soviet Union thought (the secrets) had
some utility because they paid good hard United States
currency for the information.'' said U.S. Attorney David
Queen.
Watt, Stockman testify before Senate
Washington — Ronald Reagan's controversial nominee
as secretary of the interior yielded to environmentalist at
tacks yesterday and signed a conflict-of-interest
statement pledging that he will not take part in federal de
cisions that could directly benefit his legal clients of the
past 3 1 2 years.
James Watt has been the director of the Mountain States
Legal Foundation in Denver, a tax-exempt public-interest
law firm that has represented ranching and development
interests that often do business — and frequently do battle
— with the Department of the Interior.
His association with the conservative legal group, which
often has joined in suits against the Department of the In
terior. has drawn the wrath of the nation's largest environ
mental and conservation organizations'during Watt's con
firmation hearings before the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee this week.
Watt signed the statement late yesterday as the hear

ings neared their end The action was announced by com
mittee Chairman James McClure (R-Idaho) who said
Watt responded to the urging of Sen Henrv Jackson (D-
Wash.) the ranking Democrat on the committee.
Another Reagan appointee had smoother sailing yester
day. David Stockman, the Michigan congressman chosen
to be director of the Office of Management and Budget,
faced no opposition during his four-hour appearance
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
Poles may strike over 5-day week
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's largest independent union
yesterday demanded a five-day work week and some local
chapters instructed members to stay home tomorrow,
raising the specter of a nationwide union-government con
frontation.
In another development, Warsaw Television said there
were signs of 'anarchy" in scattered Polish towns includ
ing W'loclawek. Jelenia Gora. Krosno, Olsztyn.
Czestochowa and Torun.
It claimed "open pressure" was being exerted on local
authorities to force leadership changes and added, "This
is simply a display of noisy anarchy hindering the develop
ment of public law and order."
Although the national union federation Solidarity vowed
during a meeting in Gdansk to defend its demand for free
Saturdays, it stopped short of threatening a nationwide
strike. The action was taken despite the government's
claim that a 40-hour work week would further cripple the
nation's economy.
Most Poles now work a six-dav. 46-hour week of five
eight-hour days and a sixth, six-hour day.
Solidarity's determination to gain free Saturdays was
the first major threat to the relative calm that has pre
vailed in Poland since last December, when Soviet and So
viet-bloc troops massed on Poland's borders, raising fears
of military intervention.
Western and Czechoslovak sources said, however, that
military activity along Czechoslovakia's border with Po
land has decreased.
Mexico union vote set after riots
Tijuana, Mexico — In the wake of three days of campus
violence, officials of Autonomous University of Baja Cali
fornia and members of two striking unions agreed yester
day to poll university employees to settle a dispute over
unionization.
The union elections, scheduled for next week, could end
a two-month-old strike that has shut down this Mexican
state university system, which is attended by more than
30.000 students.
The decision to hold the union elections came on the
heels of a violent confrontation in Mexicali Wednesday be
tween striking teachers and service workers. Gunfire
wounded at least one person, and a building and at least
seven cars were set afire.
Striking teachers and workers had occupied buildings at
each of the four university campuses — Mexicali, Tijuana,
Enseneda and Tecate — until this week when bands of
strikebreakers and purported undercover agents hired by
the government retook the buildings by force.
Most of the strikers are believed to be members of the
Socialist and Communist parties. The strikebreakers re
portedly were members of Mexico's ruling political group,
the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
Brown calls for 10% spending cut
Sacramento — Declaring it is "simply not possible" to
continue state spending at current levels. Gov. Jerry

Brown said yesterday state operations in the coming year
must be cut 10 percent compared to inflation
In his annual address to the Legislature. Brown painted
a gloomy picture of state finances and said the lawmakers
face "painful choices" to balance the 1981-82 budget
without a tax increase.
The response to the Democratic governor's 9'2-minute
address was restrained and predictable.
Republicans labeled it as a speech of empty rhetoric.
Some Democrats praised Brown for offering a realistic
approach to the state's budget problems, but both Demo
crat and Republican legislators objected to his proposed
cuts in school, local government and welfare programs.
Brown said the budget bill he will submit to the Legisla
ture on Saturday will propose an increase of only 0.2
percent in spending on general state operations, which
"will fall 10 percent below the rate of inflation.
"That means painful choices that we have to make to
gether." Brown said.
Although the speech lacked specific details about
Brown's proposals for state spending, it confirmed the ac
counts in recent days of his intention to cut spending in the
coming year
"It is simply not possible to fund state and local govern
ments at their historic rate," Brown said.
"From an historic vantage point, we have reached a wa
tershed. For the first time since World War 11. state gov
ernment spending will clearly not keep pace with infla
tion." he added.
Soviets launch huge nuclear sub
Washington — The Soviet Union has surprised the U.S.
intelligence community bv launching a new cruise missile
firing submarine that will make American aircraft car
riers 10 times more vulnerable than they are now. Navy
officials disclosed yesterday.
The jumbo submarine, code-named Oscar, is almost
twice the sizeof the largest U.S. attack sub now at sea. and
when in service will extend the lethal reach of Soviet anti
carrier forces from today's 20 miles to 200 miles, they
said.
Oscar is not bigger than the biggest U.S. submarine, the

Trident But the Trident is a ballistic missile sub, which
has adifferent mission The Soviets also havea larger ver
sion of that type, called the Typhoon
Attack submarines are designed to sneak up on other
submarines or surface ships and destroy them before
being detected. Quietness, speed and diving depth often
decide who wins this deadly battle of hide-and-seek.
Critics of the main U.S. attack sub. the Los Angeles class,
argue that its size is a drawback; that smaller subs would
be harder for the enemy to find. Oscar suggests Soviet
naval leaders have not bought that argument.
Missile subs are basically underwater launching plat
forms for ICBMs. Here, too. the Soviet high command has
gone the United States one better in size The new U.S. Tri
dent missile submarine, longer than the Washington Mon
ument is high, has been more than matched by the Soviets'
new Typhoon, which is about 50 percent bigger than Tri
dent. according to analysts.
" Worst-casers" at the Pentagon warn that several Os
car submarines could surround a U.S. aircraft carrier,
World War II wolfpack-style, and bombard it and escort
ing warships with accurate cruise missiles.

Begin may resign over economy
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin s frag
ile parliamentary coalition majority moved closer to col
lapse yesterday as attempts to resoive an interministerial
impasse over the deteriorating economy failed and Begin
himself began sending out signals that he will resign if any
of his Cabinet ministers decide to defect over the weekend.
Begin, who earlier in the week said that even if he lost a
parliamentary vote of confidence he would remain in the
premiership in a minority government, reportedly has
told his closest aides that he will resign if either of two
Cabinet members threatening to quit actually does so on
Sunday.
By handing in his resignation, sources close to the prime
minister said. Begin may head off an opposition Labor
Party move to dissolve the Knesset (parliament). The op
position is preparing to introduce such a motion next Tues
day.
Education Minister Zevelun Hammer and Finance Min
ister Yigael Hurvitz both vowed to quit the government —
and take their coalition partners with them — if they do not

posal to increase the salaries of Israel's teachers by 30 to
60 percent.

Poles may strike over 5-day week
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's largest independent union
yesterday demanded a five-day work week and some local
chapters instructed members to stay home tomorrow,
raising the specter of a nationwide union-government con
frontation.
In another development, Warsaw Television said there
were signs of 'anarchy" in scattered Polish towns includ
ing W'loclawek. Jelenia Gora. Krosno, Olsztyn.
Czestochowa and Torun.
It claimed "open pressure" was being exerted on local
authorities to force leadership changes and added, "This
is simply a display of noisy anarchy hindering the develop
ment of public law and order."
Although the national union federation Solidarity vowed
during a meeting in Gdansk to defend its demand for free
Saturdays, it stopped short of threatening a nationwide
strike. The action was taken despite the government's
claim that a 40-hour work week would further cripple the
nation's economy.
Most Poles now work a six-dav. 46-hour week of five
eight-hour days and a sixth, six-hour day.
Solidarity's determination to gain free Saturdays was
the first major threat to the relative calm that has pre
vailed in Poland since last December, when Soviet and So
viet-bloc troops massed on Poland's borders, raising fears
of military intervention.
Western and Czechoslovak sources said, however, that
military activity along Czechoslovakia's border with Po
land has decreased.
Mexico union vote set after riots
Tijuana, Mexico — In the wake of three days of campus
violence, officials of Autonomous University of Baja Cali
fornia and members of two striking unions agreed yester
day to poll university employees to settle a dispute over
unionization.
The union elections, scheduled for next week, could end
a two-month-old strike that has shut down this Mexican
state university system, which is attended by more than
30.000 students.
The decision to hold the union elections came on the
heels of a violent confrontation in Mexicali Wednesday be
tween striking teachers and service workers. Gunfire
wounded at least one person, and a building and at least
seven cars were set afire.
Striking teachers and workers had occupied buildings at
each of the four university campuses — Mexicali, Tijuana,
Enseneda and Tecate — until this week when bands of
strikebreakers and purported undercover agents hired by
the government retook the buildings by force.
Most of the strikers are believed to be members of the
Socialist and Communist parties. The strikebreakers re
portedly were members of Mexico's ruling political group,
the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
Brown calls for 10% spending cut
Sacramento — Declaring it is "simply not possible" to
continue state spending at current levels. Gov. Jerry

Brown said yesterday state operations in the coming year
must be cut 10 percent compared to inflation
In his annual address to the Legislature. Brown painted
a gloomy picture of state finances and said the lawmakers
face "painful choices" to balance the 1981-82 budget
without a tax increase.
The response to the Democratic governor's 9'2-minute
address was restrained and predictable.
Republicans labeled it as a speech of empty rhetoric.
Some Democrats praised Brown for offering a realistic
approach to the state's budget problems, but both Demo
crat and Republican legislators objected to his proposed
cuts in school, local government and welfare programs.
Brown said the budget bill he will submit to the Legisla
ture on Saturday will propose an increase of only 0.2
percent in spending on general state operations, which
"will fall 10 percent below the rate of inflation.
"That means painful choices that we have to make to
gether." Brown said.
Although the speech lacked specific details about
Brown's proposals for state spending, it confirmed the ac
counts in recent days of his intention to cut spending in the
coming year
"It is simply not possible to fund state and local govern
ments at their historic rate," Brown said.
"From an historic vantage point, we have reached a wa
tershed. For the first time since World War 11. state gov
ernment spending will clearly not keep pace with infla
tion." he added.
Soviets launch huge nuclear sub
Washington — The Soviet Union has surprised the U.S.
intelligence community bv launching a new cruise missile
firing submarine that will make American aircraft car
riers 10 times more vulnerable than they are now. Navy
officials disclosed yesterday.
The jumbo submarine, code-named Oscar, is almost
twice the sizeof the largest U.S. attack sub now at sea. and
when in service will extend the lethal reach of Soviet anti
carrier forces from today's 20 miles to 200 miles, they
said.
Oscar is not bigger than the biggest U.S. submarine, the

Trident But the Trident is a ballistic missile sub, which
has adifferent mission The Soviets also havea larger ver
sion of that type, called the Typhoon
Attack submarines are designed to sneak up on other
submarines or surface ships and destroy them before
being detected. Quietness, speed and diving depth often
decide who wins this deadly battle of hide-and-seek.
Critics of the main U.S. attack sub. the Los Angeles class,
argue that its size is a drawback; that smaller subs would
be harder for the enemy to find. Oscar suggests Soviet
naval leaders have not bought that argument.
Missile subs are basically underwater launching plat
forms for ICBMs. Here, too. the Soviet high command has
gone the United States one better in size The new U.S. Tri
dent missile submarine, longer than the Washington Mon
ument is high, has been more than matched by the Soviets'
new Typhoon, which is about 50 percent bigger than Tri
dent. according to analysts.
" Worst-casers" at the Pentagon warn that several Os
car submarines could surround a U.S. aircraft carrier,
World War II wolfpack-style, and bombard it and escort
ing warships with accurate cruise missiles.

Begin may resign over economy
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin s frag
ile parliamentary coalition majority moved closer to col
lapse yesterday as attempts to resoive an interministerial
impasse over the deteriorating economy failed and Begin
himself began sending out signals that he will resign if any
of his Cabinet ministers decide to defect over the weekend.
Begin, who earlier in the week said that even if he lost a
parliamentary vote of confidence he would remain in the
premiership in a minority government, reportedly has
told his closest aides that he will resign if either of two
Cabinet members threatening to quit actually does so on
Sunday.
By handing in his resignation, sources close to the prime
minister said. Begin may head off an opposition Labor
Party move to dissolve the Knesset (parliament). The op
position is preparing to introduce such a motion next Tues
day.
Education Minister Zevelun Hammer and Finance Min
ister Yigael Hurvitz both vowed to quit the government —
and take their coalition partners with them — if they do not
prevail in a Cabinet vote Sunday on a controversial pro
posal to increase the salaries of Israel's teachers by 30 to
60 percent.
Former CIA agent sentenced
Baltimore — Former CIA agent David Barnett was sen
tenced yesterday to 18 years in prison for selling informa
tion. including the names of 30 U.S. operatives and seven
potential double agents, to Soviet spies for $92,600.
Barnett could have received a life term for his guilty
plea to a single count of transmitting secrets to a foreign
power. He will be eligible for parole in six years.
U.S. District Judge Frank Kaufman said he was impos
ing a shorter sentence because Barnett had cooperated
fullv with the FBI and the CIA after entering his plea last
Oct. 29.
Barnett, of Bethesda. Md.. admitted revealing the
names of seven Soviet consulate officers the CIA had
sought to recruit as double agents and the identity of 30
covert CIA operatives and several foreign collaborators
with the CIA.
The government has never revealed what happened to
the people Barnett identified, but prosecutors said they
were endangered.
"Obviously the Soviet Union thought (the secrets) had
some utility because they paid good hard United States
currency for the information.'' said U.S. Attorney David
Queen.
Watt, Stockman testify before Senate
Washington — Ronald Reagan's controversial nominee
as secretary of the interior yielded to environmentalist at
tacks yesterday and signed a conflict-of-interest
statement pledging that he will not take part in federal de
cisions that could directly benefit his legal clients of the
past 3 1 2 years.
James Watt has been the director of the Mountain States
Legal Foundation in Denver, a tax-exempt public-interest
law firm that has represented ranching and development
interests that often do business — and frequently do battle
— with the Department of the Interior.
His association with the conservative legal group, which
often has joined in suits against the Department of the In
terior. has drawn the wrath of the nation's largest environ
mental and conservation organizations'during Watt's con
firmation hearings before the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee this week.
