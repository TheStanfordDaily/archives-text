# Most see draft sign-ups as federal duty
## Registration draws many to Post Office 
### Nancy Koehn 
Varied duties called University students to the
Stanford Post Office this week.
Career goals pulled seniors in to mail graduate
school applications. Juniors and sophomores
came to buy stamps for letters home. And many
freshman waited in line to register for the draft.
"I am registering with the Selective Service
because it is my duty to my country," said Chris
Karlovich, a freshman from Sacramento and one
of hundreds of thousands of American males born
in 1962 and therefore required by law to register
with the Selective Service this week.
Karlovich acknowledged that "there are many
arguments against registration on the grounds
that it's an infringement of rights." But, he
added, "as Americans, we have rights, but we
have to give a little to our country in exchange for
these rights. This giving includes registering for
the draft. "
Karlovich's reaction to registration reflected
the general mood among 18-year-olds who were
registering at the Post Office — though it may not
have reflected the mood of 18 year olds at large.
'Registration Is the law'
Many students filling out the 4-by-6 inch card in
the White Plaza postal branch this week gave
similar rationales to Karlovich's in explaining
why they were complying with President Jimmy
Carter's registration program.
"I feel I should obey my country's laws. I am
against war. But registration is the law. If no

body obeyed the laws, the country would be a
mess," said Ed Callaway, a Branner resident.
Alan Hartford, an 18-year-old sophomore from
Berkeley, agreed. "To disobey the law and not
register is an extreme form of protest. If there is
a fundamental conflict between the law and what
I consider right, I would break the law, but in the
case of registration I do not see this conflict."
Hartford, who said he considered not regis
tering after reading several anti-draft leaflets,
said he did not think registration necessarily an
ticipated a national draft or a war.
'Doesn't bring war closer'
"Registration is a psychological, not a prac
tical move for the government," Hartford said.
"By having a group of registered men, the gov
ernment feels more prepared for war. but I don't
feel my registering brings war any closer."
Scott Lindball, a freshman from Los Angeles,
said he did not fear a national draft as a result of
registration. "Registration makes a peacetime
draft easier, but one hopes the government has
the discretion to implement it wisely and only if
it is necessary," said the Rinconada resident.
Finding out options
Although freshman Paul Montoya said he did
not fear an imminent draft resulting from regis
tration, he did not register Wednesday. "I came
over here to find out what my options are. I am
considering conscientious objector status, but I
haven't read any anti-draft literature or been to
anv rallies, so I don't know all the facts."

Under law, eligible 18 year olds have until to
day to register. Students from Stanford Against
Conscription (SAC) distributed anti-draft
leaflets and information concerning alternatives
to registration at a booth outside the post office.
"I am not telling interested students not to reg
ister. I am telling them to think about it seriously
first," said SAC member Larry Ausubel. "Many
of the students registering this week have not
thought about it. We want to make students
aware of the implications of their decision to reg
ister or not register."
Estimating non-registrants
Ausubel estimated 15 percent of eligible Uni
versity freshmen would not register. Refusal to
register carries a prison penalty of five years.
"We are talking of about 75 freshman who have
decided to become possible felons out of convic
tion."
Eligible students choosing to register may pro
test registration by refusing to file their social se
curity number, waiting until today to register or
by applying for conscientious objector status
with the Selective Service, according to SAC
member Julie Barnard.
Karlovich said he does not consider these
methods of protest legitimate. "Conscientious
objectors are running away from registration.
This really isn't fair to other people that do reg
ister or serve in the military. Refusing to serve
infringes on our rights."

anv rallies, so I don't know all the facts."

Under law, eligible 18 year olds have until to
day to register. Students from Stanford Against
Conscription (SAC) distributed anti-draft
leaflets and information concerning alternatives
to registration at a booth outside the post office.
"I am not telling interested students not to reg
ister. I am telling them to think about it seriously
first," said SAC member Larry Ausubel. "Many
of the students registering this week have not
thought about it. We want to make students
aware of the implications of their decision to reg
ister or not register."
Estimating non-registrants
Ausubel estimated 15 percent of eligible Uni
versity freshmen would not register. Refusal to
register carries a prison penalty of five years.
"We are talking of about 75 freshman who have
decided to become possible felons out of convic
tion."
Eligible students choosing to register may pro
test registration by refusing to file their social se
curity number, waiting until today to register or
by applying for conscientious objector status
with the Selective Service, according to SAC
member Julie Barnard.
Karlovich said he does not consider these
methods of protest legitimate. "Conscientious
objectors are running away from registration.
This really isn't fair to other people that do reg
ister or serve in the military. Refusing to serve
infringes on our rights."
Varied duties called University students to the
Stanford Post Office this week.
Career goals pulled seniors in to mail graduate
school applications. Juniors and sophomores
came to buy stamps for letters home. And many
freshman waited in line to register for the draft.
"I am registering with the Selective Service
because it is my duty to my country," said Chris
Karlovich, a freshman from Sacramento and one
of hundreds of thousands of American males born
in 1962 and therefore required by law to register
with the Selective Service this week.
Karlovich acknowledged that "there are many
arguments against registration on the grounds
that it's an infringement of rights." But, he
added, "as Americans, we have rights, but we
have to give a little to our country in exchange for
these rights. This giving includes registering for
the draft. "
Karlovich's reaction to registration reflected
the general mood among 18-year-olds who were
registering at the Post Office — though it may not
have reflected the mood of 18 year olds at large.
'Registration Is the law'
Many students filling out the 4-by-6 inch card in
the White Plaza postal branch this week gave
similar rationales to Karlovich's in explaining
why they were complying with President Jimmy
Carter's registration program.
"I feel I should obey my country's laws. I am
against war. But registration is the law. If no

body obeyed the laws, the country would be a
mess," said Ed Callaway, a Branner resident.
Alan Hartford, an 18-year-old sophomore from
Berkeley, agreed. "To disobey the law and not
register is an extreme form of protest. If there is
a fundamental conflict between the law and what
I consider right, I would break the law, but in the
case of registration I do not see this conflict."
Hartford, who said he considered not regis
tering after reading several anti-draft leaflets,
said he did not think registration necessarily an
ticipated a national draft or a war.
'Doesn't bring war closer'
"Registration is a psychological, not a prac
tical move for the government," Hartford said.
"By having a group of registered men, the gov
ernment feels more prepared for war. but I don't
feel my registering brings war any closer."
Scott Lindball, a freshman from Los Angeles,
said he did not fear a national draft as a result of
registration. "Registration makes a peacetime
draft easier, but one hopes the government has
the discretion to implement it wisely and only if
it is necessary," said the Rinconada resident.
Finding out options
Although freshman Paul Montoya said he did
not fear an imminent draft resulting from regis
tration, he did not register Wednesday. "I came
over here to find out what my options are. I am
considering conscientious objector status, but I
haven't read any anti-draft literature or been to
anv rallies, so I don't know all the facts."
