# Area residents commence fruit removal to end fly infestation
## 
### Gale Warner 
As part of the current battle to con
trol the Mediterranean fruit fly, or
"medfly," infestation in Santa Clara
and Alameda counties, Palo Alto and
other cities in the area are mobilizing
their own voluntary fruit removal pro
grams.
This Saturday, 500 volunteers from
dozens of organizations in the com
munity will distribute information
and plastic disposal bags to over 15,000
Palo Alto homes. Residents are asked
to remove all fruit, soft vegetables,
and ornamental berries from their
trees and gardens, and to use or pre
serve as much as possible.
Volunteer crews will assist senior
and disabled residents with fruit re
moval. The fruit that can't be saved
will be placed in sealed bags and car
ried away by the Palo Alto Sanitation
Company as part of its normal trash
pick-up.
At Stanford, crews began to remove
fruit from trees Wednesday and hope
to have completed about 85 percent of
the task by late today, according to
Herbert Fong, the University's
ground maintenance manager.
A crew that fluctuates between four
and 10 members is picking the several
tons of avocados, oranges, limes,
grapefruits and guavas on Stanford
land.
However, Fong said, there is insuf
ficient manpower to pick the fruit
from the trees at private residences.
Residents of the 612 private homes
on campus are being asked to pick the
fruit from their own trees and place it
in plastic bags for the University to
pick up next Wednesday, according to
Carol Price, president of the Campus
Homeowners Association. A letter
outlining the voluntary plan is being
mailed today, she said. Those resi
dents who have physical limitations
that may make it difficult to pick the
fruit, or those who wish to offer their
services to help these physically lim
ited residents can call Meredith
Einaudi at 327-2786 to find out how to
get or give help, Price said.
Fong said the measures being taken
on campus are precautionary at this
point, since there have been no dis
coveries of fruit fly infestation on
campus. He said the fruit-removal
crews will not spray the trees.
The removal of the fruit is intended
to eliminate breeding grounds and

food for flies. The voluntary programs
were developed in response to vigor
ous outcry in the local community in
favor of finding alternatives to aerial
spraying of the controversial
pesticide Malathion.
The Mediterranean fruit fly is a
native of Africa that resembles a
shriveled house fly. It is a serious agri
cultural pest in the subtropical areas
of the world where it is established. It
was first discovered in Santa Clara
County in June 1980, after probably
being transported here as maggots in
fruit from Hawaii or Mexico.
Any soft-skinned fruit is a potential
medfly target. Adults can lay eggs in
any of 200 known species of host fruits
and vegetables. Hungry larva then
hatch and eat their way out. Damage
is extensive and usually can not be de
tected until the fruit is opened.
Geoffrey Paulsen, who is coordi
nating the Palo Alto fruit removal pro
gram, stressed that medflies must be
controlled immediately before spring
fruit arrives and while colder tem
peratures are slowing down the flies'
reproductive cycle. Though the pro
gram is not mandatory, said Paulsen,
it requires full community coopera
tion in order to succeed. "We would
like to avoid the mess of passing an or
dinance," he said.
Confusion about pesticides
There are many misconceptions
about the voluntary program, accord
ing to Paulsen. Some think they have
done their duty if they buy a com
mercial poison and spray their trees.
The confusion lies in the distinction
between Malathion spray, a common
house and garden pesticide which is
not effective against medflies, and
Malathion-bait spray, a potent poison
which does kill medflies but is not sold
commercially.
Even if agricultural officials spray
your trees with malathion-bait, said
Paulsen, "spraying is still not an al

ternative to stripping because no
spray will kill larva already inside
fruit."
Paulsen also emphasized that while
their methods and goals are similar,
the city voluntary programs are not
the same as the Medfly Project now in
operation by county, state and federal
officials. The voluntary programs are
preventive, to keep the fly from
spreading further within the county,
while the Medfly Project is working to
eradicate the insects in known in
fested areas.
The Medfly Project, which director
Jerry Scribner of the California De
partment of Food and Agriculture de
scribed as a "seven-day-a-week,
round-the-clock effort," has four
phases: quarantine, fruit removal,
ground-spraying and the release of
sterile flies. Officials hope to control
the medfly problem with these meth
ods and so avoid controversial aerial
sprayings.
Quarantined area
A 575-square mile area in Santa
Clara and southern Alameda counties
is now quarantined, meaning that no
local produce is leaving or being
moved around within the area. Any
fruit that leaves this area has the
potential to spread the medfly, and ag
ricultural officials say it is absolutely
vital that residents respect the
quarantine.
Beginning this week California Con
servation Corps members will strip all
fruit trees within a quarter-mile radi
us of known infestation sites. Located
mainly in the cities of Santa Clara and
Palo Alto, these sites are defined by
the confirmed presence of a fertile
adult medfly.
In addition, all fruit trees within a
half-mile radius of an infestation site
will be selectively sprayed with
malathion-bait to kill adult flies. Since
larva are transferred to the ground by


Adult female Med. fly
fallen fruit, where they wait for warm
weather to hatch, the ground under the
trees will be sprayed with another or
ganophosphate, fenthion, to kill them
as they emerge.
The last phase of the Medfly Project
involves the release of nearly 200 mil
lion sterile medflies in the county per
week in order to throw off the repro
ductive cycle. A high ratio of sterile to
fertile flies will dramatically reduce
the chance of successful breeding,
said Scribner. Flies are shipped in
from laboratories in Mexico. Hawaii
and Peru, and are sterilized by a stiff
dose of radiation while in the pupal
stage. They are then hatched in local
labs and released all over the county
by roving trucks and USDA airplanes.
These techniques have been suc
cessful before, according to Scribner.
The medfly was declared eradicated

in Los Angeles County a few weeks ago
as a result of a nearly identical pro
gram.
However. Scribner said, only a sin
gle infestation site was known in L.A..
while over 200 active sites have been
reported in the Santa Clara County
area.
The Medfly Project has less than
two months to control the problem. At
the end of February, over 2000 medfly
traps will be set throughout the county
to test the effectiveness of the ground
techniques, Palo Alto city officials
said.
If the problem is still serious, aerial
spraying of malathion over large parts
of the county will be likely despite pro
test from residents and city councils.
A minimum of three and a maximum
of 12 separate sprayings of malathion
would take place over a two-year peri
od.
Governor Jerrv Brown declared a

state of emergency in the infested
counties on Dec. 24. alerting the Na
tional Guard and making state funds
available. Over $4 million has been
spent on the Medfly Project, which
Scribner called a "modest expen
diture" compared to the threat the
medfly poses to the state's $12 billion
agricultural industry.
The San Joaquin Valley in Central
California supplies 25 percent of the
fruits and vegetables in the U.S. and 40
percent of the winter produce. Should
the medfly spread there, the entire
area would be quarantined for at least
two years, with disastrous effects on
produce availability, consumer food
prices and world trade.
Some produce could leave the
quarantine area if first sprayed with a
fumigant. However, the fumigant
turns many fruits and vegetables to
mush and may soon be banned as a
health hazard by the FDA.

state of emergency in the infested
counties on Dec. 24. alerting the Na
tional Guard and making state funds
available. Over $4 million has been
spent on the Medfly Project, which
Scribner called a "modest expen
diture" compared to the threat the
medfly poses to the state's $12 billion
agricultural industry.
The San Joaquin Valley in Central
California supplies 25 percent of the
fruits and vegetables in the U.S. and 40
percent of the winter produce. Should
the medfly spread there, the entire
area would be quarantined for at least
two years, with disastrous effects on
produce availability, consumer food
prices and world trade.
Some produce could leave the
quarantine area if first sprayed with a
fumigant. However, the fumigant
turns many fruits and vegetables to
mush and may soon be banned as a
health hazard by the FDA.
As part of the current battle to con
trol the Mediterranean fruit fly, or
"medfly," infestation in Santa Clara
and Alameda counties, Palo Alto and
other cities in the area are mobilizing
their own voluntary fruit removal pro
grams.
This Saturday, 500 volunteers from
dozens of organizations in the com
munity will distribute information
and plastic disposal bags to over 15,000
Palo Alto homes. Residents are asked
to remove all fruit, soft vegetables,
and ornamental berries from their
trees and gardens, and to use or pre
serve as much as possible.
Volunteer crews will assist senior
and disabled residents with fruit re
moval. The fruit that can't be saved
will be placed in sealed bags and car
ried away by the Palo Alto Sanitation
Company as part of its normal trash
pick-up.
At Stanford, crews began to remove
fruit from trees Wednesday and hope
to have completed about 85 percent of
the task by late today, according to
Herbert Fong, the University's
ground maintenance manager.
A crew that fluctuates between four
and 10 members is picking the several
tons of avocados, oranges, limes,
grapefruits and guavas on Stanford
land.
However, Fong said, there is insuf
ficient manpower to pick the fruit
from the trees at private residences.
Residents of the 612 private homes
on campus are being asked to pick the
fruit from their own trees and place it
in plastic bags for the University to
pick up next Wednesday, according to
Carol Price, president of the Campus
Homeowners Association. A letter
outlining the voluntary plan is being
mailed today, she said. Those resi
dents who have physical limitations
that may make it difficult to pick the
fruit, or those who wish to offer their
services to help these physically lim
ited residents can call Meredith
Einaudi at 327-2786 to find out how to
get or give help, Price said.
Fong said the measures being taken
on campus are precautionary at this
point, since there have been no dis
coveries of fruit fly infestation on
campus. He said the fruit-removal
crews will not spray the trees.
The removal of the fruit is intended
to eliminate breeding grounds and

food for flies. The voluntary programs
were developed in response to vigor
ous outcry in the local community in
favor of finding alternatives to aerial
spraying of the controversial
pesticide Malathion.
The Mediterranean fruit fly is a
native of Africa that resembles a
shriveled house fly. It is a serious agri
cultural pest in the subtropical areas
of the world where it is established. It
was first discovered in Santa Clara
County in June 1980, after probably
being transported here as maggots in
fruit from Hawaii or Mexico.
Any soft-skinned fruit is a potential
medfly target. Adults can lay eggs in
any of 200 known species of host fruits
and vegetables. Hungry larva then
hatch and eat their way out. Damage
is extensive and usually can not be de
tected until the fruit is opened.
Geoffrey Paulsen, who is coordi
nating the Palo Alto fruit removal pro
gram, stressed that medflies must be
controlled immediately before spring
fruit arrives and while colder tem
peratures are slowing down the flies'
reproductive cycle. Though the pro
gram is not mandatory, said Paulsen,
it requires full community coopera
tion in order to succeed. "We would
like to avoid the mess of passing an or
dinance," he said.
Confusion about pesticides
There are many misconceptions
about the voluntary program, accord
ing to Paulsen. Some think they have
done their duty if they buy a com
mercial poison and spray their trees.
The confusion lies in the distinction
between Malathion spray, a common
house and garden pesticide which is
not effective against medflies, and
Malathion-bait spray, a potent poison
which does kill medflies but is not sold
commercially.
Even if agricultural officials spray
your trees with malathion-bait, said
Paulsen, "spraying is still not an al

ternative to stripping because no
spray will kill larva already inside
fruit."
Paulsen also emphasized that while
their methods and goals are similar,
the city voluntary programs are not
the same as the Medfly Project now in
operation by county, state and federal
officials. The voluntary programs are
preventive, to keep the fly from
spreading further within the county,
while the Medfly Project is working to
eradicate the insects in known in
fested areas.
The Medfly Project, which director
Jerry Scribner of the California De
partment of Food and Agriculture de
scribed as a "seven-day-a-week,
round-the-clock effort," has four
phases: quarantine, fruit removal,
ground-spraying and the release of
sterile flies. Officials hope to control
the medfly problem with these meth
ods and so avoid controversial aerial
sprayings.
Quarantined area
A 575-square mile area in Santa
Clara and southern Alameda counties
is now quarantined, meaning that no
local produce is leaving or being
moved around within the area. Any
fruit that leaves this area has the
potential to spread the medfly, and ag
ricultural officials say it is absolutely
vital that residents respect the
quarantine.
Beginning this week California Con
servation Corps members will strip all
fruit trees within a quarter-mile radi
us of known infestation sites. Located
mainly in the cities of Santa Clara and
Palo Alto, these sites are defined by
the confirmed presence of a fertile
adult medfly.
In addition, all fruit trees within a
half-mile radius of an infestation site
will be selectively sprayed with
malathion-bait to kill adult flies. Since
larva are transferred to the ground by


Adult female Med. fly
fallen fruit, where they wait for warm
weather to hatch, the ground under the
trees will be sprayed with another or
ganophosphate, fenthion, to kill them
as they emerge.
The last phase of the Medfly Project
involves the release of nearly 200 mil
lion sterile medflies in the county per
week in order to throw off the repro
ductive cycle. A high ratio of sterile to
fertile flies will dramatically reduce
the chance of successful breeding,
said Scribner. Flies are shipped in
from laboratories in Mexico. Hawaii
and Peru, and are sterilized by a stiff
dose of radiation while in the pupal
stage. They are then hatched in local
labs and released all over the county
by roving trucks and USDA airplanes.
These techniques have been suc
cessful before, according to Scribner.
The medfly was declared eradicated

in Los Angeles County a few weeks ago
as a result of a nearly identical pro
gram.
However. Scribner said, only a sin
gle infestation site was known in L.A..
while over 200 active sites have been
reported in the Santa Clara County
area.
The Medfly Project has less than
two months to control the problem. At
the end of February, over 2000 medfly
traps will be set throughout the county
to test the effectiveness of the ground
techniques, Palo Alto city officials
said.
If the problem is still serious, aerial
spraying of malathion over large parts
of the county will be likely despite pro
test from residents and city councils.
A minimum of three and a maximum
of 12 separate sprayings of malathion
would take place over a two-year peri
od.
Governor Jerrv Brown declared a

state of emergency in the infested

in Los Angeles County a few weeks ago
as a result of a nearly identical pro
gram.
However. Scribner said, only a sin
gle infestation site was known in L.A..
while over 200 active sites have been
reported in the Santa Clara County
area.
The Medfly Project has less than
two months to control the problem. At
the end of February, over 2000 medfly
traps will be set throughout the county
to test the effectiveness of the ground
techniques, Palo Alto city officials
said.
If the problem is still serious, aerial
spraying of malathion over large parts
of the county will be likely despite pro
test from residents and city councils.
A minimum of three and a maximum
of 12 separate sprayings of malathion
would take place over a two-year peri
od.
Governor Jerrv Brown declared a

state of emergency in the infested
counties on Dec. 24. alerting the Na
tional Guard and making state funds
available. Over $4 million has been
spent on the Medfly Project, which
Scribner called a "modest expen
diture" compared to the threat the
medfly poses to the state's $12 billion
agricultural industry.
The San Joaquin Valley in Central
California supplies 25 percent of the
fruits and vegetables in the U.S. and 40
percent of the winter produce. Should
the medfly spread there, the entire
area would be quarantined for at least
two years, with disastrous effects on
produce availability, consumer food
prices and world trade.
Some produce could leave the
quarantine area if first sprayed with a
fumigant. However, the fumigant
turns many fruits and vegetables to
mush and may soon be banned as a
health hazard by the FDA.
As part of the current battle to con
trol the Mediterranean fruit fly, or
"medfly," infestation in Santa Clara
and Alameda counties, Palo Alto and
other cities in the area are mobilizing
their own voluntary fruit removal pro
grams.
This Saturday, 500 volunteers from
dozens of organizations in the com
munity will distribute information
and plastic disposal bags to over 15,000
Palo Alto homes. Residents are asked
to remove all fruit, soft vegetables,
and ornamental berries from their
trees and gardens, and to use or pre
serve as much as possible.
Volunteer crews will assist senior
and disabled residents with fruit re
moval. The fruit that can't be saved
will be placed in sealed bags and car
ried away by the Palo Alto Sanitation
Company as part of its normal trash
pick-up.
At Stanford, crews began to remove
fruit from trees Wednesday and hope
to have completed about 85 percent of
the task by late today, according to
Herbert Fong, the University's
ground maintenance manager.
A crew that fluctuates between four
and 10 members is picking the several
tons of avocados, oranges, limes,
grapefruits and guavas on Stanford
land.
However, Fong said, there is insuf
ficient manpower to pick the fruit
from the trees at private residences.
Residents of the 612 private homes
on campus are being asked to pick the
fruit from their own trees and place it
in plastic bags for the University to
pick up next Wednesday, according to
Carol Price, president of the Campus
Homeowners Association. A letter
outlining the voluntary plan is being
mailed today, she said. Those resi
dents who have physical limitations
that may make it difficult to pick the
fruit, or those who wish to offer their
services to help these physically lim
ited residents can call Meredith
Einaudi at 327-2786 to find out how to
get or give help, Price said.
Fong said the measures being taken
on campus are precautionary at this
point, since there have been no dis
coveries of fruit fly infestation on
campus. He said the fruit-removal
crews will not spray the trees.
The removal of the fruit is intended
to eliminate breeding grounds and

food for flies. The voluntary programs
were developed in response to vigor
ous outcry in the local community in
favor of finding alternatives to aerial
spraying of the controversial
pesticide Malathion.
The Mediterranean fruit fly is a
native of Africa that resembles a
shriveled house fly. It is a serious agri
cultural pest in the subtropical areas
of the world where it is established. It
was first discovered in Santa Clara
County in June 1980, after probably
being transported here as maggots in
fruit from Hawaii or Mexico.
Any soft-skinned fruit is a potential
medfly target. Adults can lay eggs in
any of 200 known species of host fruits
and vegetables. Hungry larva then
hatch and eat their way out. Damage
is extensive and usually can not be de
tected until the fruit is opened.
Geoffrey Paulsen, who is coordi
nating the Palo Alto fruit removal pro
gram, stressed that medflies must be
controlled immediately before spring
fruit arrives and while colder tem
peratures are slowing down the flies'
reproductive cycle. Though the pro
gram is not mandatory, said Paulsen,
it requires full community coopera
tion in order to succeed. "We would
like to avoid the mess of passing an or
dinance," he said.
Confusion about pesticides
There are many misconceptions
about the voluntary program, accord
ing to Paulsen. Some think they have
done their duty if they buy a com
mercial poison and spray their trees.
The confusion lies in the distinction
between Malathion spray, a common
house and garden pesticide which is
not effective against medflies, and
Malathion-bait spray, a potent poison
which does kill medflies but is not sold
commercially.
Even if agricultural officials spray
your trees with malathion-bait, said
Paulsen, "spraying is still not an al

ternative to stripping because no
spray will kill larva already inside
fruit."
Paulsen also emphasized that while
their methods and goals are similar,
the city voluntary programs are not
the same as the Medfly Project now in
operation by county, state and federal
officials. The voluntary programs are
preventive, to keep the fly from
spreading further within the county,
while the Medfly Project is working to
eradicate the insects in known in
fested areas.
The Medfly Project, which director
Jerry Scribner of the California De
partment of Food and Agriculture de
scribed as a "seven-day-a-week,
round-the-clock effort," has four
phases: quarantine, fruit removal,
ground-spraying and the release of
sterile flies. Officials hope to control
the medfly problem with these meth
ods and so avoid controversial aerial
sprayings.
Quarantined area
A 575-square mile area in Santa
Clara and southern Alameda counties
is now quarantined, meaning that no
local produce is leaving or being
moved around within the area. Any
fruit that leaves this area has the
potential to spread the medfly, and ag
ricultural officials say it is absolutely
vital that residents respect the
quarantine.
Beginning this week California Con
servation Corps members will strip all
fruit trees within a quarter-mile radi
us of known infestation sites. Located
mainly in the cities of Santa Clara and
Palo Alto, these sites are defined by
the confirmed presence of a fertile
adult medfly.
In addition, all fruit trees within a
half-mile radius of an infestation site
will be selectively sprayed with
malathion-bait to kill adult flies. Since
larva are transferred to the ground by


Adult female Med. fly
fallen fruit, where they wait for warm
weather to hatch, the ground under the
trees will be sprayed with another or
ganophosphate, fenthion, to kill them
as they emerge.
The last phase of the Medfly Project
involves the release of nearly 200 mil
lion sterile medflies in the county per
week in order to throw off the repro
ductive cycle. A high ratio of sterile to
fertile flies will dramatically reduce
the chance of successful breeding,
said Scribner. Flies are shipped in
from laboratories in Mexico. Hawaii
and Peru, and are sterilized by a stiff
dose of radiation while in the pupal
stage. They are then hatched in local
labs and released all over the county
by roving trucks and USDA airplanes.
These techniques have been suc
cessful before, according to Scribner.
The medfly was declared eradicated

in Los Angeles County a few weeks ago
as a result of a nearly identical pro
gram.
However. Scribner said, only a sin
gle infestation site was known in L.A..
while over 200 active sites have been
