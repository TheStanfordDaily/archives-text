# Reagan statement may hurt Carter Iran efforts
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — President-elect
Ronald Reagan said yesterday he will
not provide "a blank check" to the
Carter administration's diplomatic
efforts to settle hostage-related issues
with Iran, a comment that may add a
new obstacle to the already-com
plicated task of negotiating the re
lease of 52 Americans by Inauguration
Day, Jan. 20.
In a brief exchange with reporters,
Reagan also expressed support of the
Carter administration's efforts. But
his refusal to sign "a blank check" —a
phrase he was volunteering for the
second day in a row — was expected to
add to the doubts in Tehran about the
wisdom of concluding an agreement
now that would have to be carried out,
in part, by the successor adminis
tration.
Reagan's comment, more
equivocal than that he made on the
same subject during his fall campaign
for the presidency, came as Deputy
Secretary of State Warren Christ
opher conferred in Algiers with the au
thorized intermediaries in the indirect
negotiations with Iran.
According to administration
sources. Christopher's sudden trip
Wednesday night was prompted by a
message from the Algerians early in
the same day raising "rather techni
cal questions" about U.S. proposals
for handling frozen Iranian gov
ernmental assets.
On Tuesday, the Algerians had re
layed to Washington an Iranian re
quest for clarification on the same
points, which were described as de
tails of the timing and methods for re
turning Tehran's money in connection
with the hostage release
After receiving Washington's
cabled reply early Wednesday, the Al
gerians requested additional informa

tion to make it possible for them to ex
plain the complex legal and financial
situation to the authorities in Tehran.
State Department sources said the
Algerians withheld all or part of the
Washington cable while awaiting a
fuller explanation, rather than send
ing it on to the Iranians.
President Jimmy Carter and his
senior advisers decided Wednesday
afternoon to send Christopher and sev
eral U.S. experts to Algiers to clear up
the questions in person, according to
the sources.
The officials said the Christopher
mission is unlikely to offer substan
tive changes in the U.S. positions in
the indirect negotiations.
The Iranian questions, according to
sources familiar with them, were con
sidered cause for hope in Washington
because they requested additional de
tails of the financial arrangements set
forth in the most recent U.S. pro
posals. This seemed to suggest that
Iran was prepared to modify or aban
don its insistence on financial "guar
antees" — guarantees that the United
States has declared to be un
reasonable and impossible.
There still remains a gap, which
Christopher described on leaving
Washington as "measured in large
numbers," between the amounts of
frozen Iranian assets that could be
quickly provided to Iran when the
hostages are released, and the sums
that Iran would like to have.
There is yet no suggestion of a shift
in the Iranian position on the wealth of
the late deposed shah, Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi, according to U.S.
sources. But unless Iran changes its
demands on this point, there is no
chance for an agreement, the sources
said.
