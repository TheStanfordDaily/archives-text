# Algeria faces power games in Iran
## 
### Washington Post 
Paris — Despite its prudence,
discretion and skill as go-be
tween in the hostage crisis. Al
geria Wednesday showed signs
of getting caught in the Tehran
power struggle which so often
has frustrated past efforts to
free the detained Americans.
Symptomatic of such fears
was an uncharacteristic Alger
ian foreign ministry statement
disavowing Iranian suggestions
Algeria had proposed a secret
plan to solve the 14-month-old
crisis.
Reacting to such suggestions
from Behzad Nabavi. the chief
Iranian negotiator, the Algerian
spokesman said the report was
"premature."
"For the moment there is no
question of Algeria exercising
the role of mediator." the
spokesman said, in noting Ira
nian officials had since "cor
rected" Nabavi's statement.
But a long list of previous in
termediaries — ranging from
Palestinian guerrilla chieftain
Yasser Arafat to the United Na
tions. European socialist lead
ers to non-aligned movement
politicians and three French
lawyers — have all come to
grief in strikingly similar fash
ion.
Domestic influence
Either by fault or inattention,
they have been sucked into Ira
nian domestic politics — and. in
some cases. American election
year rivalries.
Hitherto, the Algerians had
managed to avoid such pitfalls
through a combination of dis
cretion. good timing and luck.

Despite serious political dif
ferences going back to the Viet
nam War when revolutionary
Algeria, fresh from a devas
tating war of independence
from France, identified wholly
with Hanoi. Washington and Al
giers have always managed to
keep their large economic in
terests free of controversy.
The United States buys rough
ly half Algeria's light, pollution
free oil — amounting to 8
percent of American imports —
and Algiers has relied heavily
on U.S. oil and business ex
pertise as a counterweight to
the still influential French pres
ence in Algeria.
Pragmatic stands
Algeria's credentials with
revolutionary Iran are equally
impressive, but nonetheless
curious. Algeria helped
Avatollah Khomeini's efforts to
bring down the shah, but since
his triumph Algeria also has
taken pragmatic stands without
provoking the wrath Khomeini
has reserved for other like
minded countries.
As the Iranian revolution has
become increasingly radical
ized. the Algerians have been
criticized in the revolutionary
press as an infidel Islamic coun
try. But so far the Tehran au
thorities have not cared to act
on such criticism, although
their tolerance of such apparent
pragmatism remains without
adequate explanation. Nor did
Tehran react when Algeria con
demned the seizure of the U.S.
embassy and the hostages. And
Algeria successfully kept a foot
in both the Iranian and Iraqi

camps when Iraq invaded Iran
last September
A subseqent Politburo
statement by the Algerian Na
tional Liberation Front did call
for withdrawal of Iraqi troops
and negotiations on the basis of
the 1975 accord between the two
countries worked out by the Al
gerians.
Spared criticism
Iran once again found this
position palatable and spared
the Algerians the withering
criticism reserved for all other
countries that did not side
wholeheartedly with Tehran in
the war.
In any case the Algerians
have proven serious, meticulous
intermediaries who have gained
the respect of both parties, ac
cording to diplomats involved in
the negotiations.
For example, for the first
time since the hostage seizure, a
go-between really knows how to
explain the separation of
powers of the American gov
ernmental system to the Ira
nians. who in turn feel confident
with men who haye their own
unimpeachable revolutionary
credentials.
If Algeria does succeed in re
solving the hostage crisis, its
prestige stands to exceed that
which it enjoyed right after
gaining independence and again
in 1975. Then, the late president
Houari Boumedienne brought
about the end of the U.S.-. Is
raeli . and Iranian-backed
Kurdish rebellion in Iraq by con
vincing Iraqi strongman Sadam
Hussein to accept a com
promise solution.

It was the rejection of its
terms, ironically, which
Hussein invoked to justify his in
vasion of Iran last September
(observers are convinced he
also acted preemptively for fear
Avatollah Khomeini's revolu
tionary message would stir up
the Shia Moslem Iraqis who ac
count for 60 percent of the popu
lation.)
Despite their realism,
courage, pragmatism, knowl
edge and concern, the Algerians
are playing a dangerous game
as Wednesday's jittery
statement proves.
