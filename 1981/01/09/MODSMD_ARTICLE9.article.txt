# S.E. Asia battles Chinesebacked guerrilla groups
## 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand (Agence France-Press) —
The surrender of a top Malaysian guerrilla leader
has thrown a light on the region's protracted
jungle insurgencies, and China's role in them.
With the exception of Singapore, a mini-island
republic. Southeast Asia's non-communist states
have been battling communist guerrillas — most
of them pro-Beijing — for up to 30 years.
While none of the movements is currently
strong enough to threaten a government in power,
the guerrillas constitute a serious strain on re
gional relations with China, which refuses to dis
avow them.
Beijing has moved in the past two years, how
ever. to scale down overt backing of the parties as
part of its current emphasis on winning friends to
help tame pro-Soviet Vietnam.
To this end. for example, 17 months ago Beijing
suddenly halted 17 years of beaming Thai Com
munist Party broadcasts from southwestern Chi
na.
Little impact
But the gesture, while appreciated in Thailand,
did not go far toward soothing the suspicions of its
neighbors who continue to choke on what they con
sider a prime Chinese sophistry: China's effort to
maintain what it calls party-to-party relations
with overseas communists while simultaneously
promoting friendly ties on a government-to-gov
ernment basis.
"You cannot go on shaking us by the hand," a
local non-communist diplomat was recently
quoted as telling a Chinese colleague, "while at
the same time kicking us. . .
One reason China continues backdoor moral
and financial support to the overseas parties is
that it ensures China a policy lever on regional
governments.
Without the implied threat of stepped-up sup
port to guerrillas, some analysts believe, the As
sociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) —
or at least some of its members — might adopt a
more conciliatory policy toward Vietnam, for in
stance.
Burma influenced
Similarly, the message cannot be lost on
Burma, where pro-Beijing insurgents, battling
since independence from Britain in 1948. control
huge hunks of the remote north and northeast
bordering China.
China's other key reason for sacrificing good
will to support foreign parties is the fear that any
quick turnabout would create a vacuum that
would be immediately filled by the Soviet Union
and Vietnam.
For the time being, the perceived threat from
the Soviet Union has indeed forestalled any anti-

Chinese backlash among ASEAN countries. Thai
land. Singapore. Malaysia. Indonesia and the
Philippines.
But ASEAN leaders, especially those in
Moslem Malaysia had Indonesia, continue to have
doubts about China's long-term goals. Such suspi
cion. some Western diplomats believe, represents
a threat to ASEGAN's ability to maintain its battle
against Vietnamese aggressiveness over the long
haul
To prevent any slippage, the diplomats say.
China appears to be rethinking its stance in a
move that could lead to a dramatic gesture
toward ASEAN, such as an announced end to its
partv-to-partv support.
Examining the question
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said
after a visit to Beijing last November that he be
lieved Chinese leaders were examining the ques
tion. "They understand that .so long as they give
material or propaganda or moral support to in
surgency movements in Southeast Asia, their re
lations with the governments of these countries
will always be filled with suspicions and doubts."
he said.
The question is certain to come up when Chi
nese Premier Zhao Ziyang visits Burma and Thai
land later this month, his first trip abroad since
assuming office.
Last March, the issue soured a regional tour bv
Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua, whose fail
ure to disavow the guerrillas led to fresh doubts in
Indonesia about restoring diplomatic ties with
Beijing.
Indonesia suspended its relations with China in
1967 after accusing Beijing of involvement in an
abortive 1965 communist coup. Singapore, which
also has no formal relations with China. has said it
will establish them only after Indonesia does.
Into the mainstream?
Chinese leaders have suggested one way around
the problem would be to bring the communist
movements into the mainstream of political life.
But this is not likely to be acceptable to govern
ments in the region, especially following the
charges made by the former chairman of the
banned Malayan Communist Party, Musa
Ahmad.
Ahmad, the top regional insurgent leader to
surrender in years, told a nationwide television
audience in Malaysia this week that China was
preparing a long-range strategy to dominate the
region.
Scaled-down support to the overseas parties, he
said, was a tactical maneuver aimed at buying
time for spreading Beijing's influence in the
future.

While none of the movements is currently
strong enough to threaten a government in power,
the guerrillas constitute a serious strain on re
gional relations with China, which refuses to dis
avow them.
Beijing has moved in the past two years, how
ever. to scale down overt backing of the parties as
part of its current emphasis on winning friends to
help tame pro-Soviet Vietnam.
To this end. for example, 17 months ago Beijing
suddenly halted 17 years of beaming Thai Com
munist Party broadcasts from southwestern Chi
na.
Little impact
But the gesture, while appreciated in Thailand,
did not go far toward soothing the suspicions of its
neighbors who continue to choke on what they con
sider a prime Chinese sophistry: China's effort to
maintain what it calls party-to-party relations
with overseas communists while simultaneously
promoting friendly ties on a government-to-gov
ernment basis.
"You cannot go on shaking us by the hand," a
local non-communist diplomat was recently
quoted as telling a Chinese colleague, "while at
the same time kicking us. . .
One reason China continues backdoor moral
and financial support to the overseas parties is
that it ensures China a policy lever on regional
governments.
Without the implied threat of stepped-up sup
port to guerrillas, some analysts believe, the As
sociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) —
or at least some of its members — might adopt a
more conciliatory policy toward Vietnam, for in
stance.
Burma influenced
Similarly, the message cannot be lost on
Burma, where pro-Beijing insurgents, battling
since independence from Britain in 1948. control
huge hunks of the remote north and northeast
bordering China.
China's other key reason for sacrificing good
will to support foreign parties is the fear that any
quick turnabout would create a vacuum that
would be immediately filled by the Soviet Union
and Vietnam.
For the time being, the perceived threat from
the Soviet Union has indeed forestalled any anti-

Chinese backlash among ASEAN countries. Thai
land. Singapore. Malaysia. Indonesia and the
Philippines.
But ASEAN leaders, especially those in
Moslem Malaysia had Indonesia, continue to have
doubts about China's long-term goals. Such suspi
cion. some Western diplomats believe, represents
a threat to ASEGAN's ability to maintain its battle
against Vietnamese aggressiveness over the long
haul
To prevent any slippage, the diplomats say.
China appears to be rethinking its stance in a
move that could lead to a dramatic gesture
toward ASEAN, such as an announced end to its
partv-to-partv support.
Examining the question
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said
after a visit to Beijing last November that he be
lieved Chinese leaders were examining the ques
tion. "They understand that .so long as they give
material or propaganda or moral support to in
surgency movements in Southeast Asia, their re
lations with the governments of these countries
will always be filled with suspicions and doubts."
he said.
The question is certain to come up when Chi
nese Premier Zhao Ziyang visits Burma and Thai
land later this month, his first trip abroad since
assuming office.
Last March, the issue soured a regional tour bv
Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua, whose fail
ure to disavow the guerrillas led to fresh doubts in
Indonesia about restoring diplomatic ties with
Beijing.
Indonesia suspended its relations with China in
1967 after accusing Beijing of involvement in an
abortive 1965 communist coup. Singapore, which
also has no formal relations with China. has said it
will establish them only after Indonesia does.
Into the mainstream?
Chinese leaders have suggested one way around
the problem would be to bring the communist
movements into the mainstream of political life.
But this is not likely to be acceptable to govern
ments in the region, especially following the
charges made by the former chairman of the
banned Malayan Communist Party, Musa
Ahmad.
Ahmad, the top regional insurgent leader to
surrender in years, told a nationwide television
audience in Malaysia this week that China was
preparing a long-range strategy to dominate the
region.
Scaled-down support to the overseas parties, he
said, was a tactical maneuver aimed at buying
time for spreading Beijing's influence in the
future.

The surrender of a top Malaysian guerrilla leader
