In 60 developing nations worldwide, or thousands of
communities here at home, fighting poverty starts with
good ideas. That's why Pcace Corps and VISTA need â– 
people who can think . . . and learn . . . and share their
knowledge with others. We'll train and place you where
you can help build self-reliance, develop needed skills,
and leave behind new and better approaches to old
problems. Because, when it comes to inspiring change
.. . often it's the thought that counts.
