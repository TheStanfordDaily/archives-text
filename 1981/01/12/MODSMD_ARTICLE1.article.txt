# Mascot choices trimmed to 30
## 
### Kimberly Brown 
Cardinals, Griffins and Trees have
been the three most popular, or at
least most publicized ideas during the
Stanford mascot campaign.
Yet the search goes on and Stanford
creativity continues to originate new
possibilities.
Some of the ideas recently compiled
by the ASSU Mascot Committee from
a two-week student survey conducted
in December are questionable. How
ever, no question about it — the list
says something for Stanford ingenui
ty.
The Stanford Trees have evolved
into three new branches, giving us the
Stanford Palm Trees, Redwoods, and
Sequoias.
The Stanford Griffins have led to
other warm-blooded mascots such as
the Stanford Gators, Sheep, Squirrels,
Students, and Farmers.
Some of the 30 simply defy classi
fication — the Stanford Bollards, the
Stanford Linear Accelerators (or just
Accelerators), the Stanford Steaming
Manholes, the Stanford Red Hots, the
Stanford Red Tiles. . . .

The list of 30 suggestions was edited
from over 500 responses to ASSU ques
tionnaires posted throughout the cam
pus and contains the "most viable"
ideas, said Jeff Bradach, chair of the
Mascot Committee.
The committee's goals last quarter
centered around soliciting opinions
through football game polls. Daily edi
torials, dorm notices, and several or
ganizational meetings open to the
Stanford community, he said. The cur
rent list is the culmination of the com
mittee's efforts during the fall.
Bradach said this quarter's objec
tive is to develop these choices into
"something more tangible." The com
mittee intends to narrow the list and
hire a cartoonist to depict each possi
bility.
After the mascots are portrayed.
ASSU will launch a massive publicity
campaign. According to Bradach, the
ideas and the shapes they assume will
be showing up on full-page Daily ad
vertisements, at the Sunday Night
Flicks, and during dorm sherry hours.
The committee toned down its ef
forts last fall in an attempt "not to ov

erdo everything since the elections
aren't until spring," Bradach ex
plained. But this quarter, "students
will be made much more aware of the
choices and will actually make de
cisions on them," he said.
The University had no athletic sym
bol except for the red block letter "S"
until the early 1930s when the Indian
was adopted. The Indian remained
Stanford's mascot until 1972 when it
was officially discontinued following
the protest of 55 native American stu
dents. Former President Richard
Lyman said it would never be official
ly associated with the University as
long as he continued office.
The issue has been varying in in
tensity ever since. Last year a group
headed bv a Palo Alto insurance ex
ecutive initiated a movement to
"Bring Chief Lightfoot Back to the
Farm." Early last fall supporters re
surfaced under the name of "Friends
of the Stanford Indian," even though
President Donald Kennedy had issued
a statement insisting that the Indian
would not return as mascot.
A 60 percent majority must be
achieved in the election this spring
before any mascot will be put into ef
fect. Kennedy has formed an adminis
trative mascot committee to approve
the final choice. If a 60 percent majori
ty is not obtained, the ASSU commit
tee will recommend the most popular
idea.
"Kennedy's committee is addi
tional proof that this issue isn't going
to linger," Bradach maintained. "If
nothing gains a majority of the vote
we'll probably be the Cardinals forev
er.
"This is the year to end the issue,
and I think people realize this." Brad
ach said. "Kennedy has given us the
opportunity to work on it — we should
take the opportunity and do something
definite."

Cardinals, Griffins and Trees have
been the three most popular, or at
least most publicized ideas during the
Stanford mascot campaign.
Yet the search goes on and Stanford
creativity continues to originate new
possibilities.
Some of the ideas recently compiled
by the ASSU Mascot Committee from
a two-week student survey conducted
in December are questionable. How
ever, no question about it — the list
says something for Stanford ingenui
ty.
The Stanford Trees have evolved
into three new branches, giving us the
Stanford Palm Trees, Redwoods, and
Sequoias.
The Stanford Griffins have led to
other warm-blooded mascots such as
the Stanford Gators, Sheep, Squirrels,
Students, and Farmers.
Some of the 30 simply defy classi
fication — the Stanford Bollards, the
Stanford Linear Accelerators (or just
Accelerators), the Stanford Steaming
Manholes, the Stanford Red Hots, the
Stanford Red Tiles. . . .

The list of 30 suggestions was edited
from over 500 responses to ASSU ques
tionnaires posted throughout the cam
pus and contains the "most viable"
ideas, said Jeff Bradach, chair of the
Mascot Committee.
The committee's goals last quarter
centered around soliciting opinions
through football game polls. Daily edi
torials, dorm notices, and several or
ganizational meetings open to the
Stanford community, he said. The cur
rent list is the culmination of the com
mittee's efforts during the fall.
Bradach said this quarter's objec
tive is to develop these choices into
"something more tangible." The com
mittee intends to narrow the list and
hire a cartoonist to depict each possi
bility.
After the mascots are portrayed.
ASSU will launch a massive publicity
campaign. According to Bradach, the
ideas and the shapes they assume will
be showing up on full-page Daily ad
vertisements, at the Sunday Night
Flicks, and during dorm sherry hours.
The committee toned down its ef
forts last fall in an attempt "not to ov

erdo everything since the elections
aren't until spring," Bradach ex
plained. But this quarter, "students
will be made much more aware of the
choices and will actually make de
cisions on them," he said.
The University had no athletic sym
bol except for the red block letter "S"
until the early 1930s when the Indian
was adopted. The Indian remained
Stanford's mascot until 1972 when it
was officially discontinued following
the protest of 55 native American stu
dents. Former President Richard
Lyman said it would never be official
ly associated with the University as
long as he continued office.
The issue has been varying in in
tensity ever since. Last year a group
headed bv a Palo Alto insurance ex
ecutive initiated a movement to
"Bring Chief Lightfoot Back to the
Farm." Early last fall supporters re
surfaced under the name of "Friends
of the Stanford Indian," even though
President Donald Kennedy had issued
a statement insisting that the Indian
would not return as mascot.
A 60 percent majority must be
achieved in the election this spring
before any mascot will be put into ef
fect. Kennedy has formed an adminis
trative mascot committee to approve
the final choice. If a 60 percent majori
ty is not obtained, the ASSU commit
tee will recommend the most popular
idea.
"Kennedy's committee is addi
tional proof that this issue isn't going
to linger," Bradach maintained. "If
nothing gains a majority of the vote
we'll probably be the Cardinals forev
er.
"This is the year to end the issue,
and I think people realize this." Brad
ach said. "Kennedy has given us the
opportunity to work on it — we should
take the opportunity and do something
definite."
