# Mugabe consolidates power in cabinet shuffle
## 
### Washington Post 
Salisbury, Zimbabwe â€”
Prime Minister Robert Mugabe
fired controversial Manpower
Minister Edgar Tekere and de
moted Joshua Nkomo,
Mugabe's former co-leader in
the country's guerrilla war, in a
wide-ranging Cabinet shakeup
Saturday.
The downgrading of two
critics who have support in dif
ferent parts of the military
demonstrated that Mugabe is
confident he is in firm command
of the nine-month-old govern
ment and his own party despite
occasional outbursts by his ri
vals.
Mugabe removed Nkomo as
minister of home affairs with its
control of the police to the low
key position of minister of pub
lic service. The move means
Mugabe's party now commands
all organs of state power which
Nkomo complained is in vio
lation of an agreement made
with his party when it entered
into a nominal coalition govern
ment last April.
Nkomo's immediate response
to the shift was negative.
"I'm quite clear in my mind,"
he said in a telephone interview.
"The whole thing is in complete
violation of our understanding."
Mugabe could have serious
difficulties if Nkomo or the mili
tary forces loyal to him reject
the changes. Nkomo still has up
wards of 20,000 troops nominally
under his command until they
are integrated into the new na
tional army along with
Mugabe's loyalists and some
forces from the former Rhode
sian army.

There are fears that some of
Nkomo's forces will resume
factional violence that peaked
two months ago rather than ac
cept the demotion of their lead
er.
Typical of Nkomo, however,
he left the door open for agree
ment, saying that he plans to
call a meeting of the Central
Committee of his party to dis
cuss the changes. "I will put my
position to the party leaders and
they will put theirs to me," he
said.
Mugabe used the expansion of
the Cabinet to give Josiah Chi
namano, deputy leader of
Nkomo's party, a position as
transport minister, giving the
party five ministries and three
deputies among its 20 members
of parliament.
"You couldn't consider that
an ungenerous offer and I don't
think they will either," the
prime minister said.
Mugabe also was considerate
in his remarks about his former
guerrilla ally, saying he thought
it was better to remove Nkomo
from his sensitive position be
cause he was on the firing line of
public criticism over the slow
ness in changing the formerly
white-dominated police. His
plan calls for Nkomo to switch
positions with Richard Hove,
the current minister of public
service.
In contrast, the prime min
ister was almost brusque when
questioned about Tekere. He
made his unhappiness with the
outspoken secretary general of
his party quite clear by failing
to even mention his name in the
list of Cabinet changes.

Dismissal of Tekere, ac
quitted on a technicality of
murdering a white farmer five
months ago, is likely to enhance
the government's standing in
the West and reassure the ner
vous white-minority population
of less than 200,000.
It also demonstrates that
Tekere has not been able to use
his brief surge of mass support
after his acquittal to challenge
Mugabe for leadership and that
Mugabe feels he has nothing to
fear from Tekere's reputed pop
ularity with the party's mili
tary.
Questioned about the reason

for the firing, Mugabe simply
said, Tekere "needs quite a lot
of rest" after the ordeal of his
murder trial.
He denied that the minister
was removed because of the
murder incident, noting that
Tekere was acquitted. The
ousted minister was freed on the
basis of a now-repealed indem
nity law imposed by the white
government to protect officials
involved in killing guerrillas or
their supporters.
Mugabe also announced that
Emmerson Mnangagwa, the
minister of state in the prime
minister's office, would be put

in charge of integrating the
armed forces and would chair
the joint command established
to carry this out.
This meant that Mugabe, who
also serves as defense minister,
was appointing a civilian to at
least temporarily replace Lt.
Gen. Peter Walls. Walls, who
commanded the Rhodesian
forces and was retained by
Mugabe in the same post, has
been barred from the country
after criticizing the government
and disclosing that he had
plotted a coup before the Febru
ary elections that brought
Mugabe to power.
