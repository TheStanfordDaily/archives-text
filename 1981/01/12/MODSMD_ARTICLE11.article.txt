# 400 contaminated in France
## Workers protest nuke accident 
### 
Paris (AP) — A mysterious fire at a nuclear re
processing plant has ignited a new controversy
over France's ambitious drive to harness the
power of the atom.
Despite an exhaustive preliminary study, of
ficials say they have been unable to determine the
cause of the blaze that broke out Tuesday in a silo
housing nuclear wastes.
The fire was extinguished in a few hours and
spread no further than the silo, they said. But
three employees were contaminated by high-level
radiation from the fire at the plant in La Hague,
near the English Channel coastal city of
Cherbourg, plant officials said.
Labor unions covering the plant's 2500 workers
said as many as 400 other people were con
taminated to a lesser degree by fumes.
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing's govern
ment has allocated $30 billion for nuclear develop
ment for the 10-year period ending in 1985. By that
time, half of France's electricity should be nucle
ar generated, twice the projected U.S. rate of 25

percent.
Rising oil prices since 1974 have intensified the
government's desire for nuclear power. France
currently imports 75 percent of its energy needs,
compared to 55 percent for Western Europe as a
group.
But the accident has raised serious questions
about the nuclear development.
Union officials say management should have in
formed the workers immediately about the fire
and evacuated the plant while firefighters ex
tinguished the blaze.
The manager of the plant denied union claims
that 400 workers were contaminated. The man
ager, Maurice Delange said readings from sensor
devices were within acceptable limits and there
was no reason to interrupt normal plant opera
tions while the fire was fought.
Two days after the fire, about 1200 union work
ers demonstrated outside the gates of the plant to
protest management's handling of the adfcident.
