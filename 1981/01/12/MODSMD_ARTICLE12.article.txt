# New biz school dean emphasizes need for direction, common goal
## 
### Jan Mireles 
For someone who took a
$100,000 corporation and turned
it into a $1 million corporation,
Rene (Wren) McPherson
doesn't act overly proud of
himself.
Rather, the lanky, silver
haired new dean of Stanford's
Graduate School of Business,
considers himself ordinary.
"People are people. All that
big shot stuff is baloney," said
McPherson. "I can be just as
raunchy as the next person or
just as nice."
McPherson said he is people
oriented. His 12-year tenure as
chairman of the Ohio-based
Dana Corporation, which pro
duces car and truck parts,
evidenced great changes in the
Dana's management style.
In his efforts to increase pro
ductivity McPherson worked to
incorporate ideas from employ
ees at every level. He said that
he believes everyone is valuable
and has something worthwhile
to offer.
"It may sound corny," said
McPherson, "but sometimes
you have to be corny."
The dean said he plans to op
erate under the same
philosophy at Stanford.
McPherson became GSB dean

Sept 1, but made a preliminary
visit one week last April to
"take the temperature" of the
school and faculty.
McPherson was eager to get
acquainted with his new sur
roundings and met almost ev
eryone in the school.
"He made himself available
to anyone who wanted to talk to
him," said Director of the
GSB's Public Information De
partment, Herb Blanchett.
"He met with 95 percent of
the faculty. The other five
percent were probably out of
town," Blanchett said.
McPherson admits that he
worries about losing touch with
people and their needs.
McPherson said he combats
the problem by forcing himself
to sit back and carefully con
sider alternatives. McPherson
said that Nancy, his wife of 33
years is also "very good at
checking me when I get out of
line."
An innovator, McPherson
said he has definite plans for the
business school. He said he
doesn't think there is enough
emphasis on executive educa
tion. "We live in an interna
tional world; we can't isolate
ourselves for long," he said.
"This is an outstanding

school," he said. "I am not here
to straighten them (faculty)
out. 1 am here to find our direc
tion We have to have an agree
ment — a common goal," said
McPherson.
Charles Horngren, account
ing professor and head of the
search committee which
selected McPherson,echoed the
dean's belief that accomplish
ments- must be faculty
motivated.
"Ideally, for changes to be
successful, the faculty and dean
should be working together in a
harmonious way," said
Horngren.
McPherson has been at Stan
ford for only three months, but
the faculty reaction so far is
positive. Horngren says he is
pleased with the new dean.

"He has enormous personal
warmth, great energy and a
dedication to excellence I am
very optimistic about his
tenure," said Horngren.
McPherson was selected from a
list of 70-100 names
"He came with sterling rec
ommendations from everyone
we contacted in both academia
and business," said Horngren.
"and he's a demonstrated lead
er. A dean has to be a leader to
be successful." Horngren
added.
A 1950, M.B.A. graduate of
Harvard University,
McPherson has worked his way
through Dana Corporation and
has served on a number of cor
porate boards establishing cor
poration policies and offering
advice.

tional world; we can't isolate
ourselves for long," he said.
"This is an outstanding

school," he said. "I am not here

McPherson.
Charles Horngren, account
ing professor and head of the
search committee which
selected McPherson,echoed the
dean's belief that accomplish
ments- must be faculty
motivated.
"Ideally, for changes to be
successful, the faculty and dean
should be working together in a
harmonious way," said
Horngren.
McPherson has been at Stan
ford for only three months, but
the faculty reaction so far is
positive. Horngren says he is
pleased with the new dean.

"He has enormous personal
warmth, great energy and a
dedication to excellence I am
very optimistic about his
tenure," said Horngren.
McPherson was selected from a
list of 70-100 names
"He came with sterling rec
ommendations from everyone
we contacted in both academia
and business," said Horngren.
"and he's a demonstrated lead
er. A dean has to be a leader to
be successful." Horngren
added.
A 1950, M.B.A. graduate of
Harvard University,
McPherson has worked his way
through Dana Corporation and
has served on a number of cor
porate boards establishing cor
poration policies and offering
advice.
