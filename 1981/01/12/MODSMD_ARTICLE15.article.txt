# Recent Stanford study reveals method for preventing infant deaths
## Fatal virus traced to 'carrier' blood donors 
### Bill Beyda 
Premature infants now stand
a much better chance of living
because of the results of a Stan
ford University School of Medi
cine study. The study found that
ctyomegalovirus, CMV, a lead
ing cause of death in premature
infants, can be eliminated by
careful screening of blood
donors.
The normal, healthy adult is
not likely to contract anything
more serious than a cold upon
exposure to the virus, according
to Dr. Carl Grumet of the
Pathology Department. The vi
rus remains in a latent form,
however, and some adults be
come unknowing carriers, said
Grumet, one of the researchers

in the three year long study.
Grumet said that if one of
these "carrier' adults donates
blood, and this blood is then giv
en to infants through a trans
fusion. the infants stand a large
chance of contracting the virus
if they receive a sufficient
amount of blood
It is the lack of development
of the immunological system in
premature infants that makes
them so susceptible to the virus,
according to Grumet.
The significance of the results
of the study, according to
Grumet. is that this infectious
disease which causes a high
mortality rate among certain

premature infants "is now pre
ventable in practice and at very
little expense."
Prevention essential
The key is in the prevention of
the disease, said Grumet, be
cause once the infant has con
tracted it, there is very little
that can be done.
Currently. CMV infections af
flict about 7.5 percent of the pre
mature infants born in the Unit
ed States today. 13,500 out of the
210.000 infants. The reason most
of the infants are given blood is
to replace the small amounts
taken from them for various
tests. Even small amounts of
blood have to be replaced in
these infants, according to
Grumet.

The study involved 164 pre
mature infants who received
transfusions Ten out of the 74
irtfants<l3.s percent)receiving
CMV-positive blood, contracted
the virus. Of the 90 infants who
received CMV-negative none
contracted the virus.
Innovative use
Dr. Ann Yeager of the
Pediatric Department, another
researcher, helped develop one
of the techniques used for
analyzing the blood for CMV
content. It's not a new techni
ques. Yeager explained, but this
technique was not previously
used to test for CMV in blood.
She said the technique, called
indirect hemagglutination, is
one of manv that will indicate if

CMV is present, but it has the
advantage of speed over many
of the others
The results of the study were
released at the annual meeting
of the American Association of
Blood Banks (A ABB) in Novem
ber. and will be published in the
Journal of Pediatrics according
to Yeager. Until the data is pub
lished, the researchers don't ex
pect to see their findings put
into practice nationwide.
The reaction locally has been
good, according to Yeager. and
many Bay Area hospitals are
setting up CMV screening pro
grams. Researcher Elizabeth
Hafleigh, director of the Tran
fusion Service, hopes that the
AABB will make CMV blood
screening a future regulation
Actual practice
Stanford now tests all blood
for CMV and only allows CMV
negative blood to be used for
premature infants, according to
Hafleigh.
The results of the study are
also being examined to de
termine whether they can be ap
plied to adults with weakened
immunological systems, such
as those who have had heart
transplants.
In addition to Grumet.
Yeager and Hafleigh. Ann
Arvin. John Bradley and
Charles Prober participated in
the research.

chance of contracting the virus
if they receive a sufficient
amount of blood
It is the lack of development
of the immunological system in
premature infants that makes
them so susceptible to the virus,
according to Grumet.
The significance of the results
of the study, according to
Grumet. is that this infectious
disease which causes a high
mortality rate among certain

premature infants "is now pre
ventable in practice and at very
little expense."
Prevention essential
The key is in the prevention of
the disease, said Grumet, be
cause once the infant has con
tracted it, there is very little
that can be done.
Currently. CMV infections af
flict about 7.5 percent of the pre
mature infants born in the Unit
ed States today. 13,500 out of the
210.000 infants. The reason most
of the infants are given blood is
to replace the small amounts
taken from them for various
tests. Even small amounts of
blood have to be replaced in
these infants, according to
Grumet.

The study involved 164 pre
mature infants who received
transfusions Ten out of the 74
irtfants<l3.s percent)receiving
CMV-positive blood, contracted
the virus. Of the 90 infants who
received CMV-negative none
contracted the virus.
Innovative use
Dr. Ann Yeager of the
Pediatric Department, another
researcher, helped develop one
of the techniques used for
analyzing the blood for CMV
content. It's not a new techni
ques. Yeager explained, but this
technique was not previously
used to test for CMV in blood.
She said the technique, called
indirect hemagglutination, is
one of manv that will indicate if

CMV is present, but it has the
advantage of speed over many
of the others
The results of the study were
released at the annual meeting
of the American Association of
Blood Banks (A ABB) in Novem
ber. and will be published in the
Journal of Pediatrics according
to Yeager. Until the data is pub
lished, the researchers don't ex
pect to see their findings put
into practice nationwide.
The reaction locally has been
good, according to Yeager. and
many Bay Area hospitals are
setting up CMV screening pro
grams. Researcher Elizabeth
Hafleigh, director of the Tran
fusion Service, hopes that the
AABB will make CMV blood
screening a future regulation
Actual practice
Stanford now tests all blood
for CMV and only allows CMV
negative blood to be used for
premature infants, according to
Hafleigh.
The results of the study are
also being examined to de
termine whether they can be ap
plied to adults with weakened
immunological systems, such
as those who have had heart
transplants.
In addition to Grumet.
Yeager and Hafleigh. Ann
Arvin. John Bradley and
Charles Prober participated in
the research.
