## How many sang for John Lennon? 
### 
Just as I was typing the finish
ing strokes on my own im
passioned eulogy for John Len
non. I happened to read Todd
Harris's thrashing retro
spective (Daily, Jan. 7) con
cerning Stanford's feeble show
of grief or reverence at the loss
of one of our generation's few
true spiritual leaders. To the
degree to which I felt his
criticism rang true, it seemed
my tribute suddenly took on a
frustrating shade of corniness.
and I ripped it to pieces.
At this point I didn't quite
know whether to undertake an
indignant satire on Stanford
apathy, reattempt a toned down
lament of my own admiration
and sorrow, try for a profound
assessment of Lennon's signifi
cance on our generation, or just
go study. Ruling out the latter,
what I have finally produced I
hope, is a tasteful blend of the
first three.
Lennon was a phenomenally
idolized personality, whom we
can hail as a creative legend or
brilliant and visionary prophet.
By his own rejection of such
idealization and prescribed im
agery. he made it possible to ad

mire him in a much more per
sonal and complete sense. The
man beneath the symbol was so
deeply revealed through his mu
sic and by relentless fame, that
he seemed to transcend the glit
tering adulation and inspire our
genuine devotion.
Our sorrow then, is just as
genuine, and so is our helpless
outrage. There is something so
brutally ironic about the
manner of his death to inciting a
bitter and depressing
pessimism about both human
nature and individual destiny.
Yet it is the perspective in
which the senseless tragedy of
his death is felt as only one in the
deluge of disasters which has
plagued and sensitized our
generation which is the grim
mest disaster of all.
Yes, it appears the real world
beyond Stanford is a far more
complex and impassioned place
than any of us can quite con
ceive. but it certainly provides a
stimulating backdrop for our
liberal educations.
We find we can study the
world but as individuals feel
helpless to change it or save it.
Yet if we can open our minds

and hearts, communicate, and
let ourselves be made more
aware, then perhaps we can
each play our role with a
broader range of concerns. It is
an abstract hope but that same
hope which inspired much of
Lennon's music.
In this sense I feel the re
levance of his work extends
even beyond the limited per
spectives within which most of
us will seek to "contribute to so
ciety". By simply advocating
such ideals as love, peace, and
unity, much of his music and
lifestyle inspired a kind of con
sciousness raising during a
crucial period of our history, the
significance of which extends
throughout the present. This
broader consciousness, while
seeming to some to be of vague
consequence, will ultimately be
the determining characteristic
of human destiny. It seems self
perpetuation for "our" gener
ation must begin with a "cons
cience" reevaluation of what
constitutes "our".
Just how tuned in most Stan
ford students are to social con
cerns and worldly awareness
can't fairly be determined
either by their dismal display of
concern at Lennon's passing, or
by taking for granted their well
documented well-readedness.
While too many of us seem to
confuse spiritual awareness
with intellect and are less will
ing to accept the challenge of
real communication then that of
academia. it is also true that
many are simply very individ
ualistic and not inclined to mob
action.
However, whether or not
John Lennon was personally
able to touch and inspire every
one of us, it is up to each of us to
find someone or something that
can. As we virtuously strive to
reach our potentials we should
be able to step back and truly
see these elaborate degrees of
security we seek in their real
perspective. Then we might just
thank God, or fate, or whatever
it is that we believe in that we
are where we are and be willing
to unselfishly bear a little more
responsibility for making the
world a better place for others.
Modern heroes are hard to
find, but even harder to lose.
Our generation so desperately

needs inspiration, communica
tion, and humility that the loss
of one individual who so
courageously embodied all
these virtues is the kind of hard
ship most difficult to overcome.
Lennon rocked the human spirit
and there are few people I know
who have ever made it possible
to admire them so completely.
Rest in peace John, and thanks
for EVERYTHING. You always
were and always will be . . .

real communication then that of
academia. it is also true that
many are simply very individ
ualistic and not inclined to mob
action.
However, whether or not
John Lennon was personally
able to touch and inspire every
one of us, it is up to each of us to
find someone or something that
can. As we virtuously strive to
reach our potentials we should
be able to step back and truly
see these elaborate degrees of
security we seek in their real
perspective. Then we might just
thank God, or fate, or whatever
it is that we believe in that we
are where we are and be willing
to unselfishly bear a little more
responsibility for making the
world a better place for others.
Modern heroes are hard to
find, but even harder to lose.
Our generation so desperately

needs inspiration, communica
tion, and humility that the loss
of one individual who so
courageously embodied all
these virtues is the kind of hard
ship most difficult to overcome.
Lennon rocked the human spirit
and there are few people I know
who have ever made it possible
to admire them so completely.
Rest in peace John, and thanks
for EVERYTHING. You always
were and always will be . . .

Just as I was typing the finish
ing strokes on my own im
passioned eulogy for John Len
non. I happened to read Todd
Harris's thrashing retro
spective (Daily, Jan. 7) con
cerning Stanford's feeble show
of grief or reverence at the loss
of one of our generation's few
true spiritual leaders. To the
degree to which I felt his
criticism rang true, it seemed
my tribute suddenly took on a
frustrating shade of corniness.
and I ripped it to pieces.
At this point I didn't quite
know whether to undertake an
indignant satire on Stanford
apathy, reattempt a toned down
lament of my own admiration
and sorrow, try for a profound
assessment of Lennon's signifi
cance on our generation, or just
go study. Ruling out the latter,
what I have finally produced I
hope, is a tasteful blend of the
first three.
Lennon was a phenomenally
idolized personality, whom we
can hail as a creative legend or
brilliant and visionary prophet.
By his own rejection of such
idealization and prescribed im
agery. he made it possible to ad

mire him in a much more per
sonal and complete sense. The
man beneath the symbol was so
deeply revealed through his mu
sic and by relentless fame, that
he seemed to transcend the glit
tering adulation and inspire our
genuine devotion.
Our sorrow then, is just as
genuine, and so is our helpless
outrage. There is something so
brutally ironic about the
manner of his death to inciting a
bitter and depressing
pessimism about both human
nature and individual destiny.
Yet it is the perspective in
which the senseless tragedy of
his death is felt as only one in the
deluge of disasters which has
plagued and sensitized our
generation which is the grim
mest disaster of all.
Yes, it appears the real world
beyond Stanford is a far more
complex and impassioned place
than any of us can quite con
ceive. but it certainly provides a
stimulating backdrop for our
liberal educations.
We find we can study the
world but as individuals feel
helpless to change it or save it.
Yet if we can open our minds

and hearts, communicate, and
let ourselves be made more
aware, then perhaps we can
each play our role with a
broader range of concerns. It is
an abstract hope but that same
hope which inspired much of
Lennon's music.
In this sense I feel the re
levance of his work extends
even beyond the limited per
spectives within which most of
us will seek to "contribute to so
ciety". By simply advocating
such ideals as love, peace, and
unity, much of his music and
lifestyle inspired a kind of con
sciousness raising during a
crucial period of our history, the
significance of which extends
throughout the present. This
broader consciousness, while
seeming to some to be of vague
consequence, will ultimately be
the determining characteristic
of human destiny. It seems self
perpetuation for "our" gener
ation must begin with a "cons
cience" reevaluation of what
constitutes "our".
Just how tuned in most Stan
ford students are to social con
cerns and worldly awareness
can't fairly be determined
either by their dismal display of
concern at Lennon's passing, or
by taking for granted their well
documented well-readedness.
While too many of us seem to
confuse spiritual awareness
with intellect and are less will
ing to accept the challenge of
real communication then that of
academia. it is also true that
many are simply very individ
ualistic and not inclined to mob
action.
