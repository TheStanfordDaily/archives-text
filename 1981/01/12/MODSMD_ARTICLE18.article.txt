## Rebecca Fox Congressional purity test fails 
### 
A few questions from a pros
pective employer. Yes or no?
"Peace is best guaranteed
through military strength rath
er than through world govern
ment."
"Society can be improved by
giving preferential employment
treatment for a few years to
women and ethnic minorities."
"Workers on strike should be
permitted to collect unemploy
ment compensation and food
stamps."
"Affirmative action pro
grams actually limit the ave
nues of opportunity for all
citizens and substitute bureau
cratic desires for those of merit
in selecting personnel."
Not reminiscent of the aver
age employment application,
these are four of the 43 questions
which make up what columnist
Jack Anderson reports has be
come unofficially known as the
"ideological purity test." This
screening barrage of yes or no
questions prepared by the Re
publican Study Committee has
been offered to the 68 new Re
publicans of the House and Sen
ate for use in culling through
prospective employees for their
Capitol Hill operations.
According to Anderson, the
Republican Study Committee
reports that "one out of four
new Republican members have
asked the committee for refer
rals on potential staffers who
have taken the test." The Com
mittee insists that their screen

ing tool is in no way a pass fail
issue and offers as proof one
woman who "failed" the bat
tery and was hired anyway.
These freshman members
share a frightening zeal for this
concept of ideological purity. Of
course, it would not be difficult
for the astute Washington job
seeker to ascertain which way
of answering these questions
would be more likely to assure
that the conservative novice
member would take them under
his wing and onto his payroll. A
closet liberal would be aware
that any revelations of ideol
ogical taint would incur a swift
invitation to play in the Con
stitution Avenue traffic.
Ideological purity is a concept
that activates challenges from
those mindful of the lessons of
history. Blacklists and crusades
under the banner of morality
are overexposed signals warn
ing of danger, yet they should
not loose their significance.
President-elect Reagan in
tends to form and is forming a
strong and unified adminis
tration, that not coincidentally
reflects this ideological purity.
He is exercising the greatest
possible personal control over
the hiring of people for all sub
cabinet offices in government.
Approved candidates for these
positions will find their names
on what is known in Washington
as The List. The List has been
compiled by Reagan staffers for
almost all government agencies

and has been approved by Rea
gan. As the head of Reagan's of
fice of personnel states, "We're
just trying to use some good
business procedures."
It is probable that Reagan's
government will be an efficient
one. It is also probable that its
members will soon find them
selves stagnating from a defi
ciency of ideas resulting from a
tack of non-ideologically pure
sources.
Conceivably, those zealous
freshman members of Congress
see themselves as exercising
"good business procedures" by
screening their staff for ideol
ogical purity. There is no deny
ing the conservative climate of
the country. Conservatism is in
vogue.
It is the new star on the belly
of Dr. Suess' fantasy majority
of Star-bellied Sneetches. The
poor plain bellied sneetches
with no stars on their tummies
are definitely not invited to the
weenie roast on the beaches.
The members are scanning for
stars with their ideological puri
ty test.
However, it would seem a
healthy atmosphere if ever
those job-hungry sneetches see
stars when a prerequisite to hir
ing turns out to be an examina
tion of personal beliefs. The new
members are walking a delicate
line of invasion of privacy.

publicans of the House and Sen
ate for use in culling through
prospective employees for their
Capitol Hill operations.
According to Anderson, the
Republican Study Committee
reports that "one out of four
new Republican members have
asked the committee for refer
rals on potential staffers who
have taken the test." The Com
mittee insists that their screen

ing tool is in no way a pass fail
issue and offers as proof one
woman who "failed" the bat
tery and was hired anyway.
These freshman members
share a frightening zeal for this
concept of ideological purity. Of
course, it would not be difficult
for the astute Washington job
seeker to ascertain which way
of answering these questions
would be more likely to assure
that the conservative novice
member would take them under
his wing and onto his payroll. A
closet liberal would be aware
that any revelations of ideol
ogical taint would incur a swift
invitation to play in the Con
stitution Avenue traffic.
Ideological purity is a concept
that activates challenges from
those mindful of the lessons of
history. Blacklists and crusades
under the banner of morality
are overexposed signals warn
ing of danger, yet they should
not loose their significance.
President-elect Reagan in
tends to form and is forming a
strong and unified adminis
tration, that not coincidentally
reflects this ideological purity.
He is exercising the greatest
possible personal control over
the hiring of people for all sub
cabinet offices in government.
Approved candidates for these
positions will find their names
on what is known in Washington
as The List. The List has been
compiled by Reagan staffers for
almost all government agencies

and has been approved by Rea
gan. As the head of Reagan's of
fice of personnel states, "We're
just trying to use some good
business procedures."
It is probable that Reagan's
government will be an efficient
one. It is also probable that its
members will soon find them
selves stagnating from a defi
ciency of ideas resulting from a
tack of non-ideologically pure
sources.
Conceivably, those zealous
freshman members of Congress
see themselves as exercising
"good business procedures" by
screening their staff for ideol
ogical purity. There is no deny
ing the conservative climate of
the country. Conservatism is in
vogue.
It is the new star on the belly
of Dr. Suess' fantasy majority
of Star-bellied Sneetches. The
poor plain bellied sneetches
with no stars on their tummies
are definitely not invited to the
weenie roast on the beaches.
The members are scanning for
stars with their ideological puri
ty test.
However, it would seem a
healthy atmosphere if ever
those job-hungry sneetches see
stars when a prerequisite to hir
ing turns out to be an examina
tion of personal beliefs. The new
members are walking a delicate
line of invasion of privacy.
