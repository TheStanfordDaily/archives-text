## Department names change with the wind 
### 
It always amazes me how fre
quently University departments
change their names. And I'm be
ginning the believe it is some
thing of a sham, a clever ploy to
keep University observers thor
oughly confused.
Of course it could be a con
spiracy. Maybe someone in
Purchasing (excuse me, they
are calling themselves Logistic
Services this week) is getting
kickbacks from all of the sta
tionery printers who handle the
University account.
Whatever the reason, this de
partment title musical chairs
stuff is a pain in the neck.
The other day I was trying to
get in touch with Jason Mavis.
When I first got to Stanford, he
was in charge of a group called
Plant Services, a fancy name
for group which handles every
thing from changing light bulbs
to installing new thermostats.
I knew they were no longer
called Plant Services. This was
pointed out to me a few years
ago by an employee who an
swered the phone number which
the Faculty/Staff Directory said

was 'Plant Services.' I re
member being intrigued be
cause the phone book said:
Plant Services
Emergency calls 24 hours a
day 7-2281
Other times 7-1984
That had always confused
me. But anyway, I decided to
call Plant Services and was told
in no uncertain terms that I was
trying to reach a non-existent
department. "The group is
known as 'Service Operations!'
the woman said. "A new and
better euphemism," I thought.
Anyway the other day when I
tried to contact Mavis, I looked
up Service Operations in the
phone book. But when I dialed
the number, and told the woman
what I wanted, she told me that
Service Operations no longer
existed. Imagine my dismay.
"No, you really want to talk
with someone in Operations and
Maintenance," she said. The
whole group had been re
organized under the heading Fa
cilities and Services, she told
me. I decided not to argue.
I seem to have similar prob

lems getting in touch with peo
ple in the Planning Office. Back
in the good old days, when I
wrote news for this paper, I fre
quently had to call planners.
And each time, I had to work to
remember the latest name for
the planning office.
At one time, it was called Fa
cilities Planning and Engineer
ing. Later it was dubbed Design
and Construction. Then it went
through a few other incarna
tions before it was officially
pronounced The Planning Of
fice, the very name everyone
had always used to refer to the
place, at least in the vernacular.
An associate of mine in the
Planning Office told me he used
to have a business card which
was illegible because of the
number of times he had had to
cross out the name of his depart
ment and replace it with that
week's name.
I notice now that the campus
computer facility has changed
its name. Formerly, the place
was known affectionately as
SCIP, or the Stanford Center for
Information Processing.

Now, for reasons no one can
explain to me, they have re
named themselves CIT, or the
Center for Information Technol
ogy. How pompous! Now who
would ever guess that the Cen
ter for Information Technology
is the main compute?- center on
campus? It makes no sense.
I'm convinced it's a con
spiracy.
Let's just hope the problem
doesn't get any worse. I mean
things can go to far. What's so
wrong with having an old, con
ventional, descriptive name for
a department? Leaving depart
ment names alone for a year or
two might allow people to get
used to this place. People might
have a clue about where to go
for some information or a ser
vice. It might even save some
money. (So much for the kick
back theory.)
Hey, is it true that the News
and Publications Service is be
coming the Center for In
tracampus Information Dis
persal and Printing?

number of times he had had to
cross out the name of his depart
ment and replace it with that
week's name.
I notice now that the campus
computer facility has changed
its name. Formerly, the place
was known affectionately as
SCIP, or the Stanford Center for
Information Processing.

Now, for reasons no one can
explain to me, they have re
named themselves CIT, or the
Center for Information Technol
ogy. How pompous! Now who
would ever guess that the Cen
ter for Information Technology
is the main compute?- center on
campus? It makes no sense.
I'm convinced it's a con
spiracy.
Let's just hope the problem
doesn't get any worse. I mean
things can go to far. What's so
wrong with having an old, con
ventional, descriptive name for
a department? Leaving depart
ment names alone for a year or
two might allow people to get
used to this place. People might
have a clue about where to go
for some information or a ser
vice. It might even save some
money. (So much for the kick
back theory.)
Hey, is it true that the News
and Publications Service is be

It always amazes me how fre
quently University departments
change their names. And I'm be
ginning the believe it is some
thing of a sham, a clever ploy to
keep University observers thor
oughly confused.
Of course it could be a con
spiracy. Maybe someone in
Purchasing (excuse me, they
are calling themselves Logistic
Services this week) is getting
kickbacks from all of the sta
tionery printers who handle the
University account.
Whatever the reason, this de
partment title musical chairs
stuff is a pain in the neck.
The other day I was trying to
get in touch with Jason Mavis.
When I first got to Stanford, he
was in charge of a group called
Plant Services, a fancy name
for group which handles every
thing from changing light bulbs
to installing new thermostats.
I knew they were no longer
called Plant Services. This was
pointed out to me a few years
ago by an employee who an
swered the phone number which
the Faculty/Staff Directory said

was 'Plant Services.' I re
member being intrigued be
cause the phone book said:
Plant Services
Emergency calls 24 hours a
day 7-2281
Other times 7-1984
That had always confused
me. But anyway, I decided to
call Plant Services and was told
in no uncertain terms that I was
trying to reach a non-existent
department. "The group is
known as 'Service Operations!'
the woman said. "A new and
better euphemism," I thought.
Anyway the other day when I
tried to contact Mavis, I looked
up Service Operations in the
phone book. But when I dialed
the number, and told the woman
what I wanted, she told me that
Service Operations no longer
existed. Imagine my dismay.
"No, you really want to talk
with someone in Operations and
Maintenance," she said. The
whole group had been re
organized under the heading Fa
cilities and Services, she told
me. I decided not to argue.
I seem to have similar prob

lems getting in touch with peo
ple in the Planning Office. Back
in the good old days, when I
wrote news for this paper, I fre
quently had to call planners.
And each time, I had to work to
remember the latest name for
the planning office.
At one time, it was called Fa
cilities Planning and Engineer
ing. Later it was dubbed Design
and Construction. Then it went
through a few other incarna
tions before it was officially
pronounced The Planning Of
fice, the very name everyone
had always used to refer to the
place, at least in the vernacular.
An associate of mine in the
Planning Office told me he used
to have a business card which
was illegible because of the
number of times he had had to
cross out the name of his depart
ment and replace it with that
week's name.
I notice now that the campus
computer facility has changed
