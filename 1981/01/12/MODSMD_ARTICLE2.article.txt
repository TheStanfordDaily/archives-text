# Minority council seeks unified efforts on issues
##

"Never before on campus has there
been a group composed of all the mi
norities organized to meet in an on
going way," said former COP mem
ber Sibby Freeman, who co-chaired
the Minority Coordinating Committee
last year.
The council, an independent body
which began last winter quarter,
forms a minority consensus as an effi
cient means of treating common mi
nority problems here, said Freeman.
Citing new student week as an ex
ample, he said minority groups pre
viously duplicated one another's ef
forts.
"We were comparing things that
were going on in both the Native
American community and the black
community."
The council represents the Chicano,
Native American, Asian American
and Black communities here. Each
group has a faculty, staff, under
graduate and graduate represent
ative.
This whole group meets once a quar
ter to discuss constituent minority
concerns, while a core working group
of not more than two representatives
from each community meets each
month.
The council also consists of at-large
members such as a COP represent
ative.
According to COP member Nancy
Takahashi, current issues include the
status of recruiting minority pro
fessors and the question of minority
admissions. She said, for example,
that black students recently met with
President Donald Kennedy to voice a
feeling that most blacks here are from
wealthy communities.
The question of minority admission
"will focus the whole group on and ad
dress a timely issue," said Takahashi.
"We try to choose an issue that affects
all the communities."
The committee asks, for example,
"Where are students coming from?
Are we hiring minority staff in upper
level positions? Why is it that Asian
Americans are not a minority group
on campus?" she said.
Takahashi emphasized, "Our kind
of committee has really never existed

within the university before."
According to anthropology pro
fessor Renato Rosaldo, the Chicano
faculty representative last year, mi
nority groups have a tendency to be
played off each other. "It is important
to coordinate our efforts," he said.
Rosaldo also spoke of the dif
ficulties of addressing a problem of
common interest to the different fac
ulty, staff and student representatives
and the different communities. He
said, for example, "sometimes there
are issues that are just paramount to
faculty."
Associate Director of Annual Fund
ing Harold Boyd, a member last year,
described the council's function as "a
forum for the sharing of mutual prob
lems." He added that it provides a
"mechanism for addressing these
problems."
Freeman cited implementation as a
problem. "There wasn't any formal
action as such last year, he said. But
the council addressed, for example,
the mascot issue.
Before the Minority Coordinating
Committee began, there were only ad
hoc groups formed to discuss minority
concerns. "There was never anything
that was multi-issued and on-going,"
said Freeman.
He emphasized that the council acts
as an agent for working out solutions
together. "It's nothing dramatic," he
said,"but the unified effort increases
efficiency.
"We're in a period now at the Uni
versity where most of us agree as to
the goals we'd like to see. but we're a
little short on how to get there." he
concluded.
Some people have suggested the
possibility of a Minority Services Cen
ter But according to Roble resident
fellow Deane Haskin. Co-chair of the
committee, the council has not yet dis
cussed the center. She said, however,
"I have heard of the idea and it sounds
like a good one."
The first general meeting of the
committee will be January 15. Accord
ing to Freeman, who resigned from
his position as co-chair, his successor
will probably be chosen at the meet
ing.

"We try to choose an issue that affects
all the communities."
The committee asks, for example,
"Where are students coming from?
Are we hiring minority staff in upper
level positions? Why is it that Asian
Americans are not a minority group
on campus?" she said.
Takahashi emphasized, "Our kind
of committee has really never existed

within the university before."
According to anthropology pro
fessor Renato Rosaldo, the Chicano
faculty representative last year, mi
nority groups have a tendency to be
played off each other. "It is important
to coordinate our efforts," he said.
Rosaldo also spoke of the dif
ficulties of addressing a problem of
common interest to the different fac
ulty, staff and student representatives
and the different communities. He
said, for example, "sometimes there
are issues that are just paramount to
faculty."
Associate Director of Annual Fund
ing Harold Boyd, a member last year,
described the council's function as "a
forum for the sharing of mutual prob
lems." He added that it provides a
"mechanism for addressing these
problems."
Freeman cited implementation as a
problem. "There wasn't any formal
action as such last year, he said. But
the council addressed, for example,
the mascot issue.
Before the Minority Coordinating
Committee began, there were only ad
hoc groups formed to discuss minority
concerns. "There was never anything
that was multi-issued and on-going,"
said Freeman.
He emphasized that the council acts
as an agent for working out solutions
together. "It's nothing dramatic," he
said,"but the unified effort increases
efficiency.
"We're in a period now at the Uni
versity where most of us agree as to
the goals we'd like to see. but we're a
little short on how to get there." he
concluded.
Some people have suggested the
possibility of a Minority Services Cen
ter But according to Roble resident
fellow Deane Haskin. Co-chair of the
committee, the council has not yet dis
cussed the center. She said, however,
"I have heard of the idea and it sounds
like a good one."
The first general meeting of the
committee will be January 15. Accord
ing to Freeman, who resigned from
his position as co-chair, his successor
will probably be chosen at the meet
ing.
