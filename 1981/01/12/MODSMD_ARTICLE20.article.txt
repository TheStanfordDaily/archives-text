Bollards are best
Teresa Butzerin informed us
in her article "In search of the
ideal idol" (Daily, Nov. 26) that
the 10-year quest for a Stanford
mascot "... will culminate in a
historic election this spring." 1
greatly fear that if we choose
our mascot from the candidates
listed in her article, we will be
making a grave mistake. The
most appropriate mascot has
been overlooked
The "Bollards" may initially
appear as degrading to Stan
ford, but on further considera
tion they are surely our best
choice. Bollards are sturdy: un
bending and unmovable. They

are cold and hard. But, above
all, as a mascot, they are revo
lutionary. Indeed, do they not
characterize Stanford students:
progressive, undaunted and
unique 9
Furthermore, consider the
newspaper headlines after sev
eral Stanford victories: "Tro
jans Bruised, Battered and
Beaten by Bollards"; "Brazen
Bollards Bash Beaver
Blockade"; "Bears Belted Bad
ly by Bollards." The favorable
alliterative possibilities are
great: brave, bold, bullish, built
and brilliant, to name a few.
Come spring, let us vote for

the ideal idol. Already im
mortalized in Gaieties 1980,
bollards epitomize Stanford stu
dent traits. The Stanford
"Bollards" will battle best!

Above suspicion
We were pleased to learn that
Stanford men don't cause the
problem of rape. How can this
be explained? Is it heredity or
environment? Their finely
tuned moral sense, or the
weather?
We don't know. But it's inspir
ing to be around a uniquely civ

ilized bunch of guys, who test
well too.
And it raises exciting ques
tions. Do Harvard men share
these qualities? Cal men?
Potrzebie State College men?
Are they all above suspicion?
Could we cure rapists by admit
ting them to Stanford? Who is
this select group of men, any
way, that causes all the trouble?
Guys who couldn't get into the
college of their choice, that's
who.
