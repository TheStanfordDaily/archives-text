## Reagan delays income tax reform 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington— President-elect Ronald
Reagan, to the dismay of many of his sup
porters, appears to be backing away from
some of the clear-cut economic policy
pledges that were among the hallmarks of
his election campaign.
Reagan also apparently has run into unex
pected snags trying to develop an anti-infla
tion recovery plan that his aides once said
would be unveiled on Inauguration Day or
immediately thereafter.
Instead pf being ready then, the package
of tax cuts, spending restraints and reduc
tion of business regulation may not be dis
closed until sometime in February.
There is now a debate within Reagan's in
ner circle over whether to propose delaying
until mid-summer the effective date of a 10
percent cut in personal income taxes, which
Reagan plans to ask Congress to approve.
Originally the idea had been to make the re
duction retroactive to Jan. 1.
The promise of a balanced budget —
which candidate Reagan said would be
achieved by 1983 and maybe even by 1982 —
has now been described by Reagan's chief
economic spokesman as attainable only in
1984, the final year of the president's four
year term.
Opposition
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), the Reagan
adviser and chief sponsor of a bill to cut per
sonal income tax rates 10 percent a year for
three years, said he was strongly against
any change in the timing on the measure.
"I think for both political and economic
reasons, we should go ahead with the ori
ginal plan," Kemp said recently. People ex

pect Reagan to keep his campaign pledge,
Kemp argued, adding that the reduction
should keep the economy from taking a
nosedive this spring.
But David Stockman, Reagan's choice for
director of the Office of Management and
Budget, told the Senate Governmental Af
fairs committee that the effective date was
not a major concern.
"Whether we make the first installment
Jan. 1 or June 1 is not very important,"
Stockman said. "It's a technical issue —
what is important is that it (the tax cut) be
extended over three or four years."
Business taxes
If personal tax cuts may be delayed, there
seems to be unanimous agreement within
Reagan's circle that reductions in business
taxes designed to spur investment in plant
and machinery would be retroactive to Jan.
1. That would allow companies to go ahead
with capital outlays right away without
waiting for Congress to complete action on
the measures.
The backlash was illustrated by a tele
gram sent to all U.S. senators by Howard
Phillips, national director of the Con
servative Caucus, in protest against the one
year slippage in the timetable for a bal
anced budget under the new administration.
"I urge you to vote against confirmation
of Donald Regan to be secretary of the
Treasury," Phillips wrote. "Mr. Regan's
statement indicating acquiescence in feder
al budget deficits for the next four years is
not what the American people expect or re
quire. A vote for Donald Regan is a vote for
deficit spending."
The crossfire among Reagan's advisers

and the president-elect's caution about
making decisions was unexpected in view of
the comprehensive economic proposals that
he put forth last Sept. 9.
Grim report
One aide said that the President-elect has
been somewhat "disengaged" from the eco
nomic policy planning thus far. Last
Wednesday, however, he spent two hours
with a team of economic advisers and got a
grim report on the outlook for eliminating
the budget deficit.
Sources close to the transition office said
Alan Greenspan, former chairman of Presi
dent Gerald Ford's Council of Economic
Advisers, who attended the session,
projected a $75 billion deficit if the three
year tax cut plan was put into effect.
Reagan, asked Thursday if a decision had
been made yet on whether the effective date
of the income tax proposal would be de
layed, replied "No, we're working right now
on the entire package of economic proposals
we hope to be submitting early, in a matter
of weeks, to Congress."
The unexpected delay apparently has
doomed a recommendation from Kemp and
Stockman that Reagan declare an "econom
ic emergency" to mobilize Congress and the
public behind his program for reviving the
economy and checking inflation.
That widely publicized proposal was, at
one point, said to be getting serious con
sideration from Reagan. On Tuesday, how
ever, Treasury Secretary-designate Regan
came out against it as unnecessary, and the
early February timetable for the economic
proposals seems to rule it out.
