# Senate questions Haig's attitudes
## 
### Washington Post 
, Washington â€” Alexander
Haig, Ronald Reagan's choice
for secretary of state, Friday
strongly defended his per
formance in the service of an
other president, Richard Nixon,
while Democratic senators for
the first time called openly for
authority to subpoena docu
ments and tapes relating to
Haig's White House years.
Nixon, Haig told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
on the opening day of his con
firmation hearings, "was en
titled to the presumption of in
nocence until proven other
wise." As for his own actions
during those years, Haig said he
"worked hard within the bound
aries of the law and the advice of
lawyers to support him."
Anticipating that the Demo
cratic Senate minority would
try and use his controversial
role in the Nixon White House as
a way to question his suitability
for the nation's top diplomatic
post, Haig came to the packed
hearing room prepared to con
front his critics head-on.
He produced a nine-page sum
mary of what he called "the
facts" on all the controversial
items raised by the Democrats,
including his roles in Nixon's
pardon, wiretapping of officials
and reporters and the bombing
of Cambodia. He also told the
committee that he, personally,
had no objection to any sub
poena and that he did not have

anything to hide.
The former four-star general
and commander of NATO
troops won considerable praise
from both Democrats and Re
publicans during the all-day ses
sion for the overall talents he
has displayed through much of
his 35 years of government ser
vice.
Democratic concern
Nevertheless, a number of
Democrats made clear that
their concerns were not limited
to specific acts that may or may
not be recorded on some secret
tape recording or stored in a
locked file. Rather, a number of
them focused on Haig's at
titudes toward power, the presi
dency and the Constitution and
questioned how those views,
combined with his many years
of military service, would in
fluence his actions as secretary
of state.
Before Haig said a word at
Friday's session, Sen. Claiborne
Pell (D-R.1.), the ranking mi
nority member on the 17-person
panel, told the audience that "in

the 16 years I have served on
this committee, I do not recall a
nomination that has come
before us that has caused the
concern and worry in the Senate
that this one has."
Pell, in his opening
statement, also quickly brought
into focus the committee's
sharp partisan split when he
asked it to approve the issuance
of subpoenas for specific re
cords "to help judge what kind
of a secretary of state" Haig
would make. Pell and other
Democrats argued that clearing
the air would be to everybody's
benefit, including Haig's, and
that the symbolism of such a
move would convey a true spirit
of openness.
The committee chairman,
Sen. Charles Percy (R-11l ), and
the Senate majority leader, Sen.
Howard Baker of Tennessee,
warned, however, that such a
move would probably lead no
where, that Nixon would proba
bly take legal action to stop it,
and that it would delay confirm
ing Haig, possibly until after the

inauguration, which, they said,
would be dangerous considering
international troubles.
Prepared statement
In his prepared statement,
Haig said the decision to use
wiretaps to stop news leaks was
the president's, not his, and
that, when asked who had ac
cess to various information, he
supplied names but "never de
cided on which individuals were
to be tapped."
Haig also claimed that "at no
time did I ever suggest in any
way an agreement or 'deal' that
Mr. Nixon would resign in ex
change for a pardon from Mr.
Ford."
Haig also addressed the cov
ert Nixon-era activities in Chile
aimed at preventing the elected
Marxist president, Salvador Al
lende, from taking and exercis
ing power. Haig claimed he
"was not deeply involved" in
policies toward that country and
that "in general" he had no re
sponsibility to review or ap
prove any CIA covert activities
in Chile.
