# AT&T tried for anti-trust acts
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Six years and about $260
million after the government filed suit, the Amer
ican Telephone & Telegraph Co. is coming to trial
in a case that could determine the future of the
world's largest corporation.
At 9:30 a.m. Thursday, U.S. District Court
Judge Harold Greene will take the bench in his
wood-paneled courtroom here and bang down the
gavel to open an antitrust trial that could last two
years.
Everything about the case is big, including the
stakes. AT&T has been charged with violating the
Sherman Act by using its monopoly power to
freeze out would-be competitors. Even if AT&T
wins and avoids the threat of being dismantled,
the final decision could determine whether the
firm is allowed to enter new markets such as data
processing.
As a result, AT&T says it's already spent more
than a quarter of a billion dollars on legal prepara
tion. The Justice Department says it's spent about
$10 million.
Both sides are using teams of about 50 lawyers.
More than 15 million pages of written material
have been researched. The testimony of more
than 400 witnesses will probably be introduced.
And unless a settlement is negotiated or Con

gress somehow enters the picture, it will ul
timately be up to Greene to determine if AT&T —
which likes to describeits phone system as "the
envy of the world" — will be broken up.
The Justice Department, in a recent brief, said
it remained convinced that only the dismantling
of the Bell System would "redress the monopoly
power that AT&T possesses, has abused and likely
will continue to abuse."
AT&T responds that the prosecutors are
stretching the law to suit their needs and cannot
possibly justify such a "Draconian remedy" as
the break-up of the Bell System.
The giant company is also arguing the alleged
anti-competitive actions it took were no more
than reasonable responses to ambiguous orders of
the Federal Communications Commission,
"taken in full public view and subject to im
mediate regulatory supervision and control."
AT&T is made up of several parts, any of which
would be large companies on their own.
It provides about 140 million telephones
throughout the country, has more shareholders
than any other firm — over 3 million — and just
last month became the first corporation to report
annual profits of more than $6 billion.
