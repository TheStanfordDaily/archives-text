# Chrysler, UAW negotiate freeze
## 
### 
Highland Park, Mich. (AP) -
Treasury Secretary William
Miller is ' 'going beyond his legal
mandate" in asking the United
Auto Workers to restrain its de
mands on Chrysler Corp. after
the union's contract expires
next year, union President
Douglas Fraser says.
A report published Friday in
dicated Miller wants as
surances that the UAW, which is
bargaining with Chrysler over a
proposed $600 million wage
freeze, will not try to catch up
all at once when the freeze is
over at the end of the current
contract in September 1982.
Miller, chairman of the
Chrysler Loan Guarantee
Board, is orchestrating efforts

to rescue the No. 3 automaker.
According to the Detroit Free
Press, Miller also wants as
surances from suppliers that
they will maintain normal
shipments through March.
Chrysler has asked the suppliers
to cut prices 5 percent in the
first quarter and not to raise
them beyond their original level
for the rest of the year.
But a supplier of exterior ve
hicle hardware said Friday it
had cut off shipments to
Chrysler because of the "cash
flow situation."
More than 100 banks are being
asked to convert half their
Chrysler loans into preferred
stock, but based on an interview
with Miller, the Free Press said

the treasury secretary wants
the banks to convert all the
loans instead.
Fraser said Friday night that
bargaining on the wage freeze
would shift to Washington today
"as a convenience," after one
more session today.
He said Chrysler would deal
with suppliers and Miller with
bankers in an effort to meet
Miller's goal of a loan board
meeting on Wednesday.
Congress has approved loan
guarantees of up to $1.5 billion
for the No. 3 automaker, and
Chrysler has used $800 million.
On Dec. 23 the company applied
for another $400 million.
