# Stanford beats Oregon, loses to OSU
## It's no title, but Cards happy with split SPORTS

Eugene, Ore. — Forget about
a NCAA championship Hold the
chants of "We're No. 1!" Don't
consider even a Pacific-10 Con
ference title. Just be com
fortable with the knowledge
that Stanford's men's basket
ball team had a successful road
trip.
Saturday night the Cardinals
defeated Oregon here, 82-76, for
their first victory away from
home in six games this season,
and played respectably Friday
evening in an 76-62 loss to soon
to-be-No.l-ranked Oregon State
in Corvallis.
The victory culminated what
Stanford head coach Dick
Dißiaso described as a month
long period of improvement.
"Anyone who saw us play in ear
ly December would say we're
not the same team," he said.
"There's no correlation be
tween the way the team is
playing now and three weeks
ago," agreed Oregon State head
coach Ralph Miller. "You have
to give Dick an A' for results."
Besides being climactic, the
Oregon triumph was a timely
one for Stanford, which stands
seventh in the Pac-10 with a 1-2
record (5-7 overall). To prove
that they had indeed gotten bet
ter, the Cards needed a victory
rather than just another strong
effort against Oregon, an under
manned team whose talent ap
proximates Stanford's.
Frosh, Welch keys
Stanford's improvement has
pivoted on the development of
the four Card freshmen and the
emergence of Brian Welch as
the team leader, scoring and
otherwise.
The freshmen were led by
John Revelli, who contributed 19
points and eight rebounds
against Oregon. Revelli's scor
ing was highlighted by his 11-
for-12 free-throw shooting, four
of those extending Stanford's
lead from 70-67 to 74-67 in the
game's waning moments.
Jones scored 10 points and for
the most part coolly faced the
Ducks' defensive harrass
ments. Roger Lemons, who
gained notoriety early in the
season for his slam-dunking an
tics, stuffed twice late in the
game to eliminate any last
minute comeback hopes Oregon
might have had. And Hans
Wichary played only 10 minutes
but scored seven points, five of
them midway in the second half
to help forestall an Oregon
surge.
"They're getting to under
stand what they're supposed to
do," Dißiaso said of his first
year men. "For example, when
Oregon went into its half-court
trap, they immediately went

into the offense (and looked for)
the most likely recipient for a
pass."
The most likely recipient for
many of the Cards' passes has
been Welch. Averaging 16.0
points a game, the smooth
shooting junior recovered from
his disastrous performance at
Berkeley last week to score 21
against Oregon State and 19
against Oregon, both team
highs.
More importantly, the 6-
foot-7 forward recently estab
lished himself as a source of en
couragement and inner
strength. Welch thus fills the
void left by academically in
eligible Orlando Ward, who usu
ally stoked the Cards' spiritual
fires.
No collapse
Against Oregon, the most
positive trait the Cards exuded
was not collapsing, though they
nearly succumbed to Oregon's
repeated second-half rallies.
Stanford gained its biggest
lead an instant after the second
half tipoff when Jones, who
dazzled the opposition in both
games with his quickness, ex
tended the margin to 44-28 with
a breakaway layin.
Recovering from this slap in
the face, the Ducks began their
first comeback attempt. Two
minutes after Jones' layup Ore
gon trailed only 44-38, with
Felton Sealey's three baskets
sparking a 10-point outburst.
Turnovers aided the Ducks'
streak. Stanford gave up the ball
without a shot four times during
Oregon's rally, after commit
ting only three such errors in the
first half.
The Cards righted them
selves. scoring 10 of the next 12
points to assume a 54-40 lead
with 12:58 remaining. Jeff
Ryan's three baskets led Stan
ford's resurgence.
Ryan's next basket, a follQw
of Jones' missed layup. gave
Stanford a 62-52 lead with 7:30 to
go, but David Brantley's two
free throws and slam dunk
enabled Oregon to creep within
62-56.
The Ducks threatened even
more seriously moments later.
Mike Clark, Oregon's best
player, personally shrunk Stan
ford's lead from 70-62 to 70-67.
The 6-foot-9 senior tipped in a
missed shot while being fouled,
added the ensuing free throw,
and banked in a short jumper
with 3:20 left.and three Cards
taped to his jersey.
Then came Revelli's clutch
free throws. Twice he hit both
ends of a one-and-one situation,
each time ignoring the shrieks
of the 9122 wolves assembled in
McArthur Court, where many a
visiting player has been in

timidated by the audience.
Revelli, however, remained
unflappable. "I like the pres
sure,'' said the 6-foot-7 center
forward. "I enjoy playing
against crowds like that — I like
to shut them up."
Matters were different the

night before at Corvallis' Gill
Coliseum, where many ex
pected undefeated Oregon State
to treat the Cards like pigs at a
slaughter. Neither team, how
ever, really got out of the pigsty,
though Stanford ultimately
spent more time wallowing in
its own mistakes.
Except for Steve Johnson and
Mark Radford, who both scored
26 points, OSU slogged of
fensively. No other Beaver
scored more than seven points,
and without Johnson (12-for-14)
and Radford (13-for-22), the

hosts made only nine of 32 shots.
"Our outside shooting was as
bad as it has been all year,"
lamented Miller.
Stanford, meanwhile, mud
died itself with turnovers — 24
in all. Radford. Ray Blume,
Lester Conner and William

Brew, the Beavers' quick, en
terprising guards, created most
of the Cards' mistakes.
"They have a lot of ex
perience — and hands all over
the place," Jones said of the
Beaver backcourt. Two lapses
in particular precipitated Stan
ford's downfall.
Welch's 15-footer gave the
Cards a 16-14 lead with 11:07 left
in the half, but they lost their ad
vantage after baskets by John
son and Conner. The next thing

Stanford lost was its ballhandl
ing competence, yielding the
ball four straight times on
Beaver thefts to fall behind
22-16
Stanford stubbornly stayed
within six points, 39-33, early in

the second half. A description of
the following action, however,
reads like a death toll: Blume
hit two free throws. Radford
stole a pass. Welch traveled.
Radford sank a 20-footer. Doug
Marty committed an offensive
foul. Johnson made a tip-in.
Marty threw a pass out of
bounds. Johnson again followed
in a miss. Blume stole the ball
from Lemons and glided down
court for a breakaway lavin. Re
sult: 10 consecutive Beaver
points, a 49-33 lead. 10,125
screaming OSU zealots.
