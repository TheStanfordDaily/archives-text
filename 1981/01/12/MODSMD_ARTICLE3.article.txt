### Diane Johnson 
Two University volunteer organiza
tions kickoff annual fund raising
drives tomorrow with an evening of
speeches and audience questions. Of
ficially associated with the University
Office of Development, these two
groups, Heritage Fund and Senior
Pledge, are sponsoring the evening in
an attempt to increase Bay Area fi
nancial support for each group's fund
raising project, according to Wendy
Gibson, director of student develop
ment for the Office of Development
Although both Heritage Fund, a stu
dent volunteer organization, and Sen
ior Pledge, established to make sen
iors aware of the need for their finan
cial support after graduation, seek to
raise money for the University, each
group accomplishes its goal through
different sources.
History major Bryan Collins, chair
man of the Heritage Fund, described
the kickoff as a motivational meeting
for its 60 student volunteers. In this
way, volunteers will be prepared to
answer questions and supply accurate
information to Bay Area business peo
ple — potential Heritage Fund con
tributors.
The primary issue in this year's
kickoff is tuition. The money received
from business contributors is used for
freshmen and sophomore scholar
ships. According to Collins, it is im
portant that both the solicitors and the
donors have a clear understanding of

the costs in sending a student to
school. Peninsula Times Tribune
donated one full scholarship to help
kick off the 1981 campaign. Last year
the Heritage Fund received $33,000.
enough to fund one year of University
tuition for nine students. This year's
goal is roughly the same.
Orientation
Senior Penny Ramos, a history ma
jor, is chairman of the other group.
Senior Pledge. She described tomor
row's event as an orientation for all in
terested students on how the Univer
sity uses its funds. By making seniors
aware of the need for financial sup
port. Senior Pledge volunteers hope to
maximize student contributions.
I
The pledge may consist of any
amount but the suggested donation is
$81. keeping in spirit with the year, ac
cording to Ramos This amount would
be paid over a three-year period in al
lotments of $20, $30 and $31. Although
it is possible for the contributors to
specify the recipient of their gift - en
gineering students may donate to the
Engineering Department — most
money is put into the general fund for
use wherever necessary, Ramos said.
The kickoff is a promotion for a
week of solicitation which runs Janu
ary 13 to 19. During this time approx
imately 100 volunteers will contact
seniors and encourage them to make a
donation. Many volunteers will as
sume the role of "house represent
ative" for each residence on campus

These 70 volunteers will inform sen
iors in their house about the pledge
event. The remaining 30 volunteers
will coordinate contribution activity
through organizational arms of Senior
Pledge, the steering committee and
the Student Pledge Corps, said
Ramos.
Four phone-a-thons will also be held
to reach off-campus seniors. Ramos
commented, "My personal goal is to
see 50 percent of the senior class par
ticipate in the pledge, whether
through money donations or the giving
of their time. I believe that we can
beat last year's donation of $30,000 by
$10,000." '
