# USC upsets UCLA in Pauley
## 
### Associated Press 
Second-ranked Oregon State kept rolling
toward a possible No. 1 rating among the nation's
college basketball teams, but the wheels came off
for N0.7 UCLA as the Bruins were edged on their
home court by arch-rival USC.
The loss by top-ranked DePaul to Old Dominion
gives Oregon State its opportunity to lead this
week's poll. An unofficial vote came from fans at
Corvallis, Ore., who learned about the DePaul
loss and were chanting "We're No. 1" in final
minutes of the undefeated Beavers',Bo-53 romp
over California Saturday night.
Mark Radford scored the first 10 points for Ore
gon State and finished with a game-high 22 points
as the Beavers raised their overall record to 12-0.
Cal is 9-2 for the season and took its first Pac-10
loss.
At Pauley Pavilion on the UCLA campus, the
Bruins missed three chances to put the game
away with free throws in the final minutes. Then
USC's Maurice Williams sank a 20-foot jump shot
from the left corner with about two seconds re
maining to give the Trojans their 68-66 upset over
UCLA, which had led since the first moments of
the game.
Oregon State now holds first place in the Pacif
ic-10 Conference with a 4-0 record. Arizona State,
USC, UCLA and California each have one loss. Ar
izona State topped Washington 90-72 Saturday

night and Washington State dealt Arizona its sec
ond league loss 80-71.
Stan Morrison, in his second year as coach for
USC, now has two victories over UCLA in three
tries, but his erratic Trojans have an overall 7-5
record. UCLA is 8-2 in all games including an
earlier loss to DePaul, and both teams are 2-1 in
the Pac-10.
Morrison had a good view of Williams' winning
shot, but in his case seeing was disbelieving.
"I was right behind him when he shot and saw
the ball go through and thought. 'It can't happen.
It can't go in.' But it did."
Morrison said he told his Trojans before the
game that to beat the cat-quick Bruins they had to
"run harder and block off better on the boards."
Williams, who scored 20 points, got the ball af
ter it was brought down the middle of the floor by
guard Jacques Hill, weaving through the pressing
UCLA defense.
"I didn't want to go into overtime. I just relaxed
and took my shot." the 6-foot-6 sharpshooter said
of the winning basket. "I'm glad to be a member
of a team that beat UCLA at Pauley, not many
teams do that."
No USC team had beaten the Bruins at Pauley
since 1970. At home in the Sports Arena their re
cord was only a little better as UCLA holds a 37-4
edge over the Trojans in those years.
