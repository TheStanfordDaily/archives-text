Eugene, Ore. — Pity poor John Revelli, Keith Jones, Roger
Lemons and Hans Wichary. After a half-season of placid
Maples Pavilion, they were going to be subjected to real Pa
cific-10 basketball, Oregon style, where they take their
basketball as seriously as they do their environment.
Playing teams like Wisconsin-Superior in places like
Maples is no preparation for Oregon State's Gill Coliseum and
Oregon's McArthur Court. How could Stanford's freshmen
know what college basketball is like from playing at Maples?
As Gertrude Stein said about Oakland, there is no "there"
there. It is an impersonal building, with all the charm and
homeyness of Albers Wall.

Commentary

And Stanford students will never be mistaken for basket
ball fans. The students who do suffer theembarassmentof not
having anything else to do on game nights always seem as if
they are waiting for someone, or something, to entertain
them.
But the students who inhabit places like Gill or Mac Court
don't wait: they create things. Things like hate for their oppo
nents. Or points for their team. They weren't kidding when
they called crowds like those who hosted Stanford this week
end "the sixth man." Any visiting coach who brings his team
into one of these dens does not do so willingly.
Gill Coliseum is not an imposing edifice. Nor is Mac Court
in Eugene, which looks like a surplus warehouse the Army
couldn't give away. On the inside of each, however, is basket
ball heaven. Every seat in the house is right on top of the
court, even it is three stories high. And every seat in each was
filled with screaming spirit.
With 6:18 showing on the clock Friday night, more than
10000 Beavermania fans in Corvallis stood up cheering and
yelling for Oregon State — that's 6:18 before the opening
tipoff and a full 90 seconds before Ralph Miller's unbeaten
team came onto the court.
Don't forget, this was a packed house for a team solidly en
trenched in the Pac-10's second division. Selling out Gill Col
iseum to watch Stanford play basketball is roughly akin to
selling out Stanford Stadium to watch Oregon State play foot
ball.
But the hoop-crazy people in Oregon don't care. Friday
night's 76-62 win over Stanford was the 27th consecutive
sellout of Gill, and the following night's game against Cal
(won by OSU 80-53) made 28.
In Eugene Saturday night, Mac Court was near capacity.
More than 9000 fans crammed in to the tottering palace to
watch two teams who were winless in the Pac-10, despite the
fact that the game was being shown live on local TV.
This kind of rabid fandom has blown apart many a wise
game plan for visiting teams. Composure is lost, minds go
blank and coaching instructions go out the window. It was this
snakepit into which Stanford tread with four freshmen who
are still getting used to the fact that they are now in the big
time.
And believe it or not, Stanford looked good this weekend.
They split the games, beating Oregon 82-76, but no one ex
pected anything more, considering the nation's best team was
one of the opponents. More importantly, they were com
petitive. Or rather, they weren't embarrassed.
What's more, they enjoyed it. Somebody should tell these
innocent freshmen that you're supposed to lose your cool
when the Mac Court crowd screams at you. Somebody should
let Revelli know you can't make four free throws down the
stretch when the rafters are shaking. Somebody should tell
Lemons that you don't make two breakaway slam dunks to
seal a win on Oregon's home court.
Somebody should let Jones know you don't drive on Steve
Johnson, Oregon State's 6-foot-10V2 center. These games are
not to be enjoyed, but endured. At least before now.
"It's a great place to play," Lemons said of Mac Court.
"There was a lot of enthusiasm out there. No matter who the
crowd is cheering for, it gets me going. I was excited to play
here. I've heard so much about it."
"I had a good time," Revelli said of Stanford's second con
secutive win at Mac Court. Of his near-perfect (11 of 12) free
throw shooting, Revelli added: "I was totally concentrating.
You get to shut the crowd up. It's something to aim at."
The only preparation the freshmen had was a good talking
to. No noise machines during practice, no special plans. And
they emerged from their baptism-by-fire with nary a scorch.
"The seniors said it would be noisy," Lemons said. "The
freshmen knew something was going to happen."
Something did happen. Stanford refused to fold down the
stretch, the mark of the rattled team, the mark of Stanford
teams from the recent past. Maybe the difference is the
freshmen. They didn't know any better. They just treated the
Oregon courts like any other.
I know one thing: I'm not going to be the one that tells them.
Why spoil the fun?
