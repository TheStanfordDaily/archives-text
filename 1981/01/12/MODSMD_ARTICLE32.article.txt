# East battles West in Shrine All-Star circus
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
The 56th annual Shrine circus
occasionally masqueraded as a
football game, but for the most
part it was just a lot of slapstick
routines. The inevitable pigeons
flew in formation, clowns wan
dered in the stands, and balloons
filled Stanford Stadium Satur
day. all part of the tradition of
the East-West All-Star game.
Which, if anyone is interested,
the East won by a score of 21-3.
Players with multi-colored
helmets and cartoon names like
Tom Flick and Major Ogilvie
auditioned for the pro scouts sit
ting in the press box, while fans
cheered loudly but without feel
ing.
Marriott's Great America
sent over a brigade of fresh
faced dancers and singers in
red. white and blue to liven
things a bit. But none of that was
quite as interesting as those
guys called Shriners walking
around in funny purple hats with
tassels on top.
The halftime show starred
Daffy Duck. Bugs Bunny and
Porky Pig in an almost gag
gable salute to the youth of
Arnerica. also provided by
Great America. The animals
gave stirring renditions of
"Hound Dog.'' "Rock Around
the Clock" and "Rock and Roll
Music."
They're in tough company,
however; past highlight acts
have included the Royal Canadi
an Mounted Police, Hawaiian
dancers. Mexican dancers and
the Kilgore Rangerettes from
Texas.
The game itself was a typical
confrontation, with the East re
iving on a strong running attack,
and the West exhibiting an
almost dazzling passing game

Wayne Hardin of Temple
coached the East, assisted by
ex-Notre Dame coach Dan De
vine and Johnny Majors of Ten
nessee Tim Clifford of Indiana
split time at quarterback with
Wake Forest's Jay Venuto. The
running attack featured most

notably Ogilvie from Alabama
and North Carolina's "Fa
mous" Amos Lawrence.
Heading the West was UCLA
head coach Terry Donahue,
with Pat Mallev of Santa Clara
and Arizona's Larrv Smith his
assistants Tom Flick of Wash

ington and the much-ballyhooed
Neil Lomax of Portland State
did the quarterbacking.
At wide receiver for the West
were John Mistier of Arizona
State. David Verser of Kansas
and Mark Nichols from San Jose
State. Frank Hawkins of Ne
vada-Reno and Hubie Oliver of
Arizona made strong im
pressions as all-purpose running
backs.
The East leapt to a 7-0 lead
within the first two minutes of
the game when linebacker
Ricky Jackson of Pittsburgh,
the game's MVP, recovered a
fumble on the West's 30-yard
line. Lawrence carried three
times to the 7. Ogilvie twice to
the 2 and Lawrence scored over
left tackle.
The first half was uneventful,
with sloppy offensive play on
both sides and a series of
pushing matches and punts cen
tering around midfield. The
East squad finally put together
a scoring drive on the first
series of the second half.
Clifford showed that he was
both a running and passing quar
terback. leading the team to the
15-yard line. Lawrence then
scored around left end.
Donahue's team continually
put together an exciting passing
attack, only to have it fizzle
each time inside the 30-vard
line. Brian Sullivan of Santa
Clara kicked a record-breaking
52-yard field goal in the middle
of the third quarter for the

West's only points
Ken Naber, Stanford's only
contribution to the game, at
tempted a 30-yard field goal in
the first quarter but it was
blocked by Frank Warren of
Auburn
Hardin's squad scored the
final touchdown of the game on
the first series of the fourth
quarter Clifford once again ex
hibited a surprising amount of
versatility, leading his team to
the 22-vard line on a series of
short passes.
Clifford then hit wide re
ceiver Notre Dame's Pete Holo
han with a 17-yarder to the 3. Af
ter two incomplete passes, Clif
ford found tight end Tim Sher
win of Boston College in the
right corner of the end zone.
The West kept the quarter in
teresting. largely through the
efforts of Lomax and Verser.
Lomax completed three to
Verser for 13, 29 and 28 yards.
However, Coach Malley seemed
to forget about Verser each
time his team penetrated the 30-
vard line. He consistently fell
back on conservative calls,
trying to force the ball into the
end zone by way of running Ol
iver.
All in all both teams were sur
prisingly effective at moving
the ball, a difficult task because
the coaches had only one week
to prepare a team, and in a
carnival-like atmosphere. But
only the East was successful at
scoring, and that was the dif
ference.
