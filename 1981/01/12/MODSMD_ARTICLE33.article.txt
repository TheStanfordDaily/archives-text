# Super Bowl XV: Eagles vs. Raiders
## Defense stops Dallas 20-7 Plunkett leads 34-27 win 
### 
Philadelphia (AP) — Wilbert Montgomery, hobbled by a sore
knee, ran for 194 yards and scored one touchdown yesterday as the
Philadelphia Eagles beat the Dallas Cowboys 20-7 to win the Na
tional Football Conference championship and advance to the Super
Bowl.
The Eagles will take on the Oakland Raiders, who beat the San
Diego Chargers 34-27 in Sunday's American Conference title game,
for the National Football League championship in the Louisiana Su
perdome Jan. 25.
Montgomery, whose 42-yard touchdown run gave the Eagles a 7-0
lead just 2:11 into the game, became the first player to gain 100
yards or more against Dallas in 29 Cowboys' playoff games. Mont
gomery wound up 2 yards shy of the NFL playoff ground-gaining re
cord of 196 yards set by the Eagles' Steve Van Buren in 1949 against
the Los Angeles Rams.
Dallas tied the score in the second quarter on a 3-yard run by Tony
Dorsett, but the Eagles went ahead to stay with 7:42 left in the third
quarter on Tony Franklin's 26-vard field goal.
Philadelphia wrapped it up — and entered its first NFL cham
pionship game since beating the Green Bay Packers 20 years ago —
on a 9-yard scoring burst by fullback Leroy Harris with 1:47 to go in
the third quarter.
Harris' touchdown was set up after Dorsett was stripped of the
ball by rookie cornerback Rovnel Young, with Eagles linebacker
Jerry Robinson recovering the fumble and returning it 22 yards to
the Dallas 38. The key turnover stopped a Dallas drive that seconds
earlier had reached the Philadelphia 40 on a 28-vard pass reception
by tight end Jay Saldi.
Franklin added a 20-yard field goal with 2:10 to play to complete
the scoring.
The Eagles, a slight underdog even though they had edged Dallas
for the NFC East Division title, surprised the Cowboys by control
ing the game on the ground. Dallas' weakness was supposed to be its
cornerbacks, but instead the Eagles exploited the Cowboys' rugged
defensive front line and linebackers.
The game itself started in 16-degree temperature with the wind at
14 mph, making a wind-chill factor of 17 degrees below zero.

San Diego (AP) — Jim Plunkett passed for two touchdowns, one
covering 65 yards to Raymond Chester on a deflection, and ran for
another score in a wild first period that propelled the Oakland
Raiders past San Diego into the Super Bowl yesterday by a 34-27
score.
The American Conference championship game was a good, old
fashioned shoot-out, an aerial display reminiscent of the old Ameri
can Football League days in a game between two original AFL
franchises.
Dan Fouts, San Diego's record-smashing passer, accounted for
more yardage than Plunkett, completing 22 of 45 attempts for 336
yards and two touchdowns to Charlie Joiner. But the Raiders in
tercepted him twice and pounced on a costly fumble by the
Chargers' Mike Thomas, which led to an Oakland score.
Plunkett was far more precise than his more heralded rival.
Along with the electrifying bomb to Chester, he passed 21 yards for
a touchdown to running back Kenny King and sprinted 5 yards for a
score when his receivers were covered during the Raiders' 21-point
first period. Plunkett finished with 14 completions in 18 attempts for
261 yards.
The Oakland quarterback, continuing an up-from-the-ashes
odvssev which he can culminate two weeks from now in Super Bowl
XV against Philadelphia, struck with lightning suddenness on the
game's third play, barely two hours after a fierce thunderstorm had
swept through the stadium.
Plunkett tried a simple 5-yard pass to King, waiting at the 40-yard
line. But the ball bounced off King's hands and into Chester's at mid
field. The Oakland tight end wheeled and sprinted untouched for a
touchdown with just 1:35 elapsed on the clock.
Fouts signalled the start of his own aerial circus on the Chargers'
first play of the game. He unloaded a 55-vard pass to Ron Smith, and
followed with a 17-yarder to John Jefferson to move the Chargers to
the Oakland 14.
But Lester Hayes, thecornerback who had intercepted 13 passes
during the regular season and four more in Oakland's two playoff
victories, snatched yet another one, killing the threat.
The next time the Chargers got the ball, Fouts passed 12 yards to
