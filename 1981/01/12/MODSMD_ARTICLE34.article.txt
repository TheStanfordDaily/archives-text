# Stanford takes two out of three but Japanese steal the show
## 
### Linda Sue Park 
Stanford's gymnastics team
came away from the regular
season opener Friday night with
a 2-1 record as the men beat San
Jose State and the women fin
ished between Cal State-Full
erton and Washington. A Maples
Pavilion crowd of more than 900
was also treated to the first ex
hibition ever performed by a
Japanese team here.
The results of the men's com
petition held true to coach Sadao
Hamada's pre-meet predictions
as Stanford topped the Spartans
253.10-222.50. Outstanding per
formances were turned in by
Mike Lee. Jim Campanelli and
Kirk Druey, who finished 1-2-3
in the all-around.
In vaulting, the team scored a
total of 45.55 for a 9.1 average
per competitor. Best marks
were garnered by Campanelli at
9.4 and Chris Smith at 9.25.
The women's team total of
135.05 was good enough for a
split, edging Washington's
133.40 but lpsing to Cal State-
Fullerton, which finished at
138.05. The injury jinx that has
plagued the team lately struck
again, as freshman Anne Friend
suffered a knee sprain during
vaulting warm-ups. By the time
the last floor exercise began,
coach Jackie Walker was down
to four of her nine gymnasts.
The improved depth of the
team shone through during the
meet. Stanford scored well de

spite the injuries to Karen Hall,
Trina Wiggins and Friend.
Competing in only two events
because of sore knees, star re
cruit Merilyn Chapman tied
Fullerton's Julie Goewey on the
balance beam with a 9.4, a new
school record. Anne Smith fin
ished third all-around in a
strong field with 34.65, and
teammate Julie Bledsoe was
not far behind at 33.75.
The audience was awed by the
Japanese All-Star team, which

is currently touring the west
coast. Composed of the best
high school and college gym
nasts. the visitors performed at
the end of each round of com
petition. earning loud applause
for the difficulty and complexi
ty of their routines.
Hamada hopes to make their
visit to Stanford an annual
event, perhaps leading one day
to an official competition be
tween Stanford and the All-
Stars.
