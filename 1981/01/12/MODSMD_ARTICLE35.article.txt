### Bill Beyda 
The Stanford Cardinals
opened their NorCal Conference
season Saturday night with a
disappointing loss to San Jose
State. 75-66 at Maples Pavilion
The teams were within six
points of each other throughout
the game except during the clos
ing moments.
Before the game, Stanford
coach Dotty McCrea said the
Cardinals' game plan was to
"get the ball inside, and to take
advantage of our height."
McCrea had hoped to take ad
vantage of the Spartans' in
juries. San Jose State only used
six players, but they were used
effectively.
"The six girls that played
knew about the injuries, knew
they had to pull through, and
they did," said San Jose State
coach Sharon Chatman. Stan
ford was never able to get the
ball inside, and their outside
shots were challenged.
The game started well for the
Cards, and they held the lead un
til the 6:30 mark of the first half,
when the Spartans pulled ahead
27-26. San Jose State held on,
going into the half with a 38-36
edge.
Stanford's performance in
the first half was well balanced,
with Kim Kupferer. Ann Miller
and Louise Smith each scoring
eight points. Smith led the team
in rebounds at the half with five.
San Jose's first-half offense was
headed by Elinor Banks with 17
points and Karen Mason with 14.
Stanford lost its outside
shooting touch in the second
half, and didn't threaten the
Spartans until there was only
4:07 left, when they pulled to
within one point. With 3:16 re
maining Stanford regained the
lead 61-60, but San Jose pulled
ahead again, this time for good.

San Jose State moved to a
69-64 lead with about a minute
left. The Cards repeatedly
fouled to stop the clock and try
and get the ball back, but there
wasn't enough time for them to
make a comeback.
"It was a tough loss for the
girls." McCrea said. "We

missed the easy shots tonight.
They intimidated us. When
we're intimidated, we lose."
McCrea praised Miller, who
seemed to shoot more con
sistently than the rest of the
team. A favorite with the fans
was guard Denise McGuire, a
five-foot-five sophomore from

Pearl River. N Y. who sparked
the team when she entered the
game in the second half.
The loss drops Stanford's re
cord to 9-8. The Cards' next
three games are on the road, at
Fresno State. USF and UOP.
Stanford returns to Maples Jan
28 to host Santa Clara.
