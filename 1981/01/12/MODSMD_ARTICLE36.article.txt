Binding pact sought in hostage crises
Washington — Carter administration negotiators are at
tempting to draft a legally binding, international agree
ment that would set down the terms of the settlement for
release of the 52 U.S. hostages and would be signed by
either Iran or Algeria on Iran's behalf, informed sources
said yesterday.
The sources declined to describe the exact nature of the
document, which might take the form of an executive
agreement, but said it would be signed by President Jim
my Carter on behalf of the United States before Jan. 20 and
would be binding on his successor. There is precedent for
such a binding agreement assumed by a president without
the expressed approval of Congress.
The agreement also would represent a public, legal
commitment by the Iranian and American governments to
abide by terms that are still being negotiated. A major is
sue still unsettled is the timing for release of the hostages.
In Algiers, with time running out. Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher has told Algerian in
termediaries that by Inauguration Day the United States
could transfer to an escrow account under Algerian con
trol less than $5 billion plus 1.6 million ounces of gold,
worth roughlv $1 billion, out of the Iranian assets frozen by
Carter in November 1979
Nixon-Haig tapes subpoenaed
Washington — Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.), chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, last night issued
a subpoena in an attempt to get indexes and logs of still
secret 1973 tape recordings between President Richard
Nixon and Alexander Haig while Haig was serving as
White House chief of staff.
The subpoena follows a decision by the committee Sat
urday to take such action if less formal arrangements
could not be worked out. The committee is holding con
firmation hearings on Haig as President-elect Ronald
Reagan's choice for secretary of state.
Committee staff director Ed Sanders said the commit
tee had hoped to obtain a list of the Nixon-Haig tapes from
the National Archives voluntarily, but there was not
enough time to complete negotiations.
At the same time. Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.), another member of the committee, pre
dicted that Haig will be confirmed, but he warned that "if
we continue with an orgy of Watergate for the next several

months it would severely damage" Haig's ability to oper
ate at a time of danger around the world.
The Republican leader said "the last thing on earth that
we should do is have a rerun of the entire Watergate hear
ings." That, he said, is what concerned him about some of
the recent Democratic moves in the committee to gain ac
cess to the tapes
The committee action is not expected to keep Haig from
being confirmed by the Senate before Reagan's inaugura
tion Jan 20. but it has the potential of keeping the subject
alive after Haig is installed in office.
Kania condemns Solidarity's farmers
Warsaw, Poland — Tension between the ruling Com
munist Party and newly formed independent trade unions
was on the rise again yesterday amid rumors that Polish
leader Stanislaw Kania has made a new unannounced visit
to Moscow.
The Polish press agency PAP late Saturday released the
text of a strongly worded attack on the fledgling farmers'
branch of the new. nonparty union group called Solidarity
by Kania, the Communist Party chief.
Although the speech was neither broadcast nor printed
in the official press over the weekend, its contents were
the strongest condemnation yet made of the new trade un
ion movement, which is unique in Communist Eastern Eu
rope.
"The political gamblers," Kania said, want to destroy
the traditional farm organizations of Poland which are
based on cooperatives dominated by the Communist Par
ty. and the peasants' political party which is subservient to
the Communists.
The party boss also referred to some Solidarity activity
as counterrevolutionary, a very serious charge.
The speech was made apparently on the same day that
the industrial members of Solidarity successfully shut
down most major enterprises to enforce their demand for
a five-day. 40-hour workweek.
Brzezinski gives final advice to allies
Washington — Zbigniew Brzezinski, in his final major
address as President Jimmy Carter's national security ad
viser. yesterday called on Western Europe and Japan to
join the United States in constructing a "regional security
framework" in the Persian Gulf area.
In a "last hurrah" speech to a French group in Paris, the

text of which was made available here, Brzezinski pro
posed an annual "strategic summit" meeting of Western
nations and Japan to consult regularly on political and mil
itary challenges.
He gave his views on the international situation, with
proposed solutions for global problems, as his departing
contribution to the incoming Reagan administration.
In the process, he took positions different from some of
those favored by some Republicans.
For example, he said he opposes establishing U.S. mili
tary bases in the Persian Gulf region, as reportedly urged
bv former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger during a re
cent "private" trip to the region.
Similarly, Brzezinski said it is simplistic and mislead
ing to blame all the world's troubles on Soviet aggression
and American weakness.
The foreign policy expert, who will return to Columbia
University to teach and write after inauguration day. told
the French Institute of International Relations that the
major cause of global unrest is the "dramatic awakening"
of former colonial peoples in the Third World — developing
nations that the West needs as markets, as suppliers, and
as outlets for its capital.
Plant fire injures French workers
Paris — A mysterious fire at a nuclear reprocessing
plant has ignited a new controversy over France's am
bitious drive to harness the power of the atom.
Despite an exhaustive preliminary study, officials say
they have been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
that broke out Tuesday in a silo housing nuclear wastes.
The fire was extinguished in a few hours and spread no
further than the silo, they said. But three employees were
contaminated by high-level radiation from the fire at the
plant in La Hague, near the English Channel coastal city of
Cherbourg, plant officials said.
Labor unions covering the plant's 2500 workers said as

many as 400 other people were contaminated to a lesser
degree by fumes
Union officials say management should have informed
the workers immediately about the fire and evacuated the
plant while firefighters extinguished the blaze.
The manager of the plant denied union claims that 400
workers were contaminated. The manager. Maurice De
lange said readings from sensor devices were within ac
ceptable limits and there was no reason to interrupt nor
mal plant operations while the fire was fought.
Demonstrators arrested at Harvard
Cambridge, Mass. — Twenty-two people were arrested
Saturday as about 80 young demonstrators picketed the
Harvard Square post office in the final day of a week-long
protest against the latest round of draft registration.
Police said 19 of the demonstrators were arrested when
they tried to block the entrance to the post office, where 18-
year-olds were supposed to register for the draft last
week.
About five of the demonstrators resisted arrest and
were dragged into waiting police vans as the remaining 60
protesters chanted, "The whole world is watching."
"We have about 400 people using the post office on a nor
mal Saturday, and we had to protect their rights." said
Cambridge Police Capt. Henry Breen.
"We tried to cooperate with them and even blocked off
half the street for the protest," Breen said. "But when
they blocked the entrance, we had to act."
All 22 people arrested will be charged with disorderly
conduct, Breen said.
