# Draft unconstitutional?
## Student files class action suit 
### Philip Eure 
As 18-year-olds queued up at local
post offices to register for the draft
last week amid a national resurgence
of anti-draft protest, a University stu
dent continued his legal battle against
peacetime conscription.
In one of two suits pending in the
federal courts challenging the re
sumption of draft registration, junior
Benjamin Detenber. and two other
men continued using the U.S. Con
stitution as the chief weapon in their
fight against registration.
"Our primary argument is that
peacetime draft registration is un
constitutional. There are simply no
provisions for it in the constitution,"
said Detenber, a communications ma
jor.
Reached by telephone at her Boston
office, Detenber's attorney, Allison
Porter, who wrote the case brief, ex
plained the rationale behind the Phi
Psi resident's legal battle, saying,
"Since draft registration during
peacetime and during a period of no
declared war or national emergency is
unconstitutional, this law violates a
contract between the American peo
ple and their government."
Detenber's case, a 10-page Com
plaint Class Action suit, filed jointly
with Princeton University student
Harrison Miller and Wellesley, Mass.
resident Christopher Olson, charges
that the government has no "compell
ing interest in limiting conscription to
males 18 to 20. The suit also charges
that draft registration is an invasion of
the plaintiff's right to privacy â€”
"their right to be free from unwar
ranted governmental intrusion," ac
cording to the case brief.
According to Detenber and Porter,
since his suit challenges the constitu
tionality of peacetime draft regis
tration, it could very well put an end to
the process if a federal court agrees
with his arguments in the case.
July 19 last year, a U.S. District
Court in Boston denied a preliminary
injunction in Detenber's suit. The le
gal proceedings in this case are now
being delayed or "stayed," pending
Supreme Court action in the second of
two suits challenging the resumption
of draft registration.
Last July, three hours after the pre

liminary injunction against regis
tration was denied in Detenber's case,
a three-judge panel in a Philadelphia
federal court granted a permanent in
junction against the draft registration
process.
The panel's decision stated that the
proposed registration of only males
was a "violation of their rights to
equal protection under the law.
"Congress could not constitutional
ly require registration under the Mili
tary Service Act of only black or only
white citizens or single out any politi

cal or religious group simply because
those groups contain sufficient per
sons to fill the needs of the Selective
Service," the ruling continued.
As a result of the Philadelphia case
ruling, the Selective Service's plans
for draft registration halted tem
porarily while the federal government
attempted to appeal the decision. On
July 20, Supreme Court Justice Wil
liam Brennan lifted the Philadelphia
court's permanent injunction against
registration until the full court could
