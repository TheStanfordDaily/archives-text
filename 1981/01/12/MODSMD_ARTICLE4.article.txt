# Draft unconstitutional?
## Student files class action suit 
### Philip Eure 
As 18-year-olds queued up at local
post offices to register for the draft
last week amid a national resurgence
of anti-draft protest, a University stu
dent continued his legal battle against
peacetime conscription.
In one of two suits pending in the
federal courts challenging the re
sumption of draft registration, junior
Benjamin Detenber. and two other
men continued using the U.S. Con
stitution as the chief weapon in their
fight against registration.
"Our primary argument is that
peacetime draft registration is un
constitutional. There are simply no
provisions for it in the constitution,"
said Detenber, a communications ma
jor.
Reached by telephone at her Boston
office, Detenber's attorney, Allison
Porter, who wrote the case brief, ex
plained the rationale behind the Phi
Psi resident's legal battle, saying,
"Since draft registration during
peacetime and during a period of no
declared war or national emergency is
unconstitutional, this law violates a
contract between the American peo
ple and their government."
Detenber's case, a 10-page Com
plaint Class Action suit, filed jointly
with Princeton University student
Harrison Miller and Wellesley, Mass.
resident Christopher Olson, charges
that the government has no "compell
ing interest in limiting conscription to
males 18 to 20. The suit also charges
that draft registration is an invasion of
the plaintiff's right to privacy â€”
"their right to be free from unwar
ranted governmental intrusion," ac
cording to the case brief.
According to Detenber and Porter,
since his suit challenges the constitu
tionality of peacetime draft regis
tration, it could very well put an end to
the process if a federal court agrees
with his arguments in the case.
July 19 last year, a U.S. District
Court in Boston denied a preliminary
injunction in Detenber's suit. The le
gal proceedings in this case are now
being delayed or "stayed," pending
Supreme Court action in the second of
two suits challenging the resumption
of draft registration.
Last July, three hours after the pre

liminary injunction against regis
tration was denied in Detenber's case,
a three-judge panel in a Philadelphia
federal court granted a permanent in
junction against the draft registration
process.
The panel's decision stated that the
proposed registration of only males
was a "violation of their rights to
equal protection under the law.
"Congress could not constitutional
ly require registration under the Mili
tary Service Act of only black or only
white citizens or single out any politi

cal or religious group simply because
those groups contain sufficient per
sons to fill the needs of the Selective
Service," the ruling continued.
As a result of the Philadelphia case
ruling, the Selective Service's plans
for draft registration halted tem
porarily while the federal government
attempted to appeal the decision. On
July 20, Supreme Court Justice Wil
liam Brennan lifted the Philadelphia
court's permanent injunction against
registration until the full court could
decide the issue.
In denying a permanent injunction
against registration, Brennan cited
the Carter administration and con
gressional appropriation of substan
tial funds to the registration effort as
rationale. Brennan also noted that the
plaintiff's safety was not endangered
in awaiting a Supreme Court decision.
The high court is presently expected
to rule on the Philadelphia suit by
July. If the court overrules the Phila
delphia decision and allows draft reg
istration to continue, it will in effect
have ruled that sex discrimination is
admissible in the case of military con
scription, said Porter.
If the Supreme Court, however, up
holds the three-judge panel's decision
to enjoin draft registration on the
basis of sex discrimination against
males. Congress would then presum
ably rewrite the law to include wom
en, added Porter.
According to Detenber, his class ac
tion suit, currently stayed in a U.S.
District Court in Boston, goes much
further in its ramifications than the
Philadelphia case.
"Our case is broader than the Phila
delphia suit. Sex discrimination, the
main theme of the Philadelphia case,
is just part of our suit. We are also
challenging the constitutionality of
registration, and this has not been
done before," he said.
Named as defendants in the case
are the director of the Selective Ser
vice, Bernard Rostker, Postmaster
General William Bolger and Presi

dent Jimmy Carter. They are cited for
their respective roles in the im
plementation, processing and author
ization of draft registration.
Since Detenber's suit essentially
challenges the constitutionality of the
peacetime draft registration of either
sex, Porter believes this case will con
tinue regardless of how the Supreme
Court rules on the Philadelphia suit.
Contacted at the Justice Depart
ment in Washington, attorney Andrew
Wolfe, who is defending the federal

government's position against De
tenber, declined to comment on the
class action suit.
An article printed in the New York
Times last July, however, cited a brief
filed with the Supreme Court in which
the Justice Department called regis
tration "an important element in the
package of our national responses to
Soviet aggression." The brief added
that the absence of a draft registration
plan would ' 'leave the country without
a means of conscripting an army and
seriously handicapped in the event of a
national emergency."
Meanwhile, the Carter adminis
tration and the Selective Service re
cently warned against that knowing
failure or neglect to register is punish
able by up to five years imprisonment
and/or a $10,000 fine.
