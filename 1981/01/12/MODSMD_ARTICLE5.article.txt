# Minister resigning may end Begin's majority
## 
### Washington Post 
Jerusalem â€” Israeli Finance Min
ister Yigael Hurvitz made good on his
threat to resign yesterday, thereby
virtually assuring the collapse of the
government of Prime Minister Men
achem Begin.
After nearly eight hours of uninter
rupted debate in which Begin fruit
lessly sought to reach a compromise
in an inter-ministerial impasse over
Israel's deteriorating economy. Begin
announced through a spokesman that
the cabinet would meet again today to
discuss the "political implications" of
Hurvitz's resignation.
But because Hurvitz will take with
him the three votes of the parlia
mentary Rafi faction, thus further
diminishing Begin's already paper
thin Likud coalition majority, the only
practical option that appeared avail
able to the prime minister was to sub
mit a motion to dissolve the Knesset
(parliament) and schedule national
elections.
The cabinet ministers appeared
unanimous on the inevitiability of the
collapse of the government, with Jus
tice Minister Moshe Nissim saying. "I
think this can be assumed," and
Health Minister Eliezer Shostak de
claring, "Of course the government
will (fall). One has to go to early elec
tions, and I think this will be the opin

ion of the prime minister."
The opposition Labor Party said
yesterday it would give the govern
ment until Wednesday to dissolve the
parliament before it submits such a
motion itself.
Patch together
Begin theoretically could attempt
to patch together a slim Likud majori
ty by recruiting into the coalition
some of the Knesset's many one-man
factions, in exchange for political
promises. But the prime minister has
indicated that he would rather initiate
an "honorable" end to his government
and take his chances on a new elec
tion.
If Begin does move to dissolve the
Knesset, as expected, a national elec
tion would be held, most likely in mid-
June, five months before his four-year
term is scheduled to expire. The Labor
Party is seeking to advance the elec
tion to less than three months from
now.
Thin smile
Begin emerged from the cabinet
session looking wan but forcing a thin
smile to a crowd of waiting reporters.
Without making any comment, he got
into his car in a cold, driving rain and
was driven home.
