# Minister resigning may end Begin's majority
## 
### Washington Post 
Jerusalem — Israeli Finance Min
ister Yigael Hurvitz made good on his
threat to resign yesterday, thereby
virtually assuring the collapse of the
government of Prime Minister Men
achem Begin.
After nearly eight hours of uninter
rupted debate in which Begin fruit
lessly sought to reach a compromise
in an inter-ministerial impasse over
Israel's deteriorating economy. Begin
announced through a spokesman that
the cabinet would meet again today to
discuss the "political implications" of
Hurvitz's resignation.
But because Hurvitz will take with
him the three votes of the parlia
mentary Rafi faction, thus further
diminishing Begin's already paper
thin Likud coalition majority, the only
practical option that appeared avail
able to the prime minister was to sub
mit a motion to dissolve the Knesset
(parliament) and schedule national
elections.
The cabinet ministers appeared
unanimous on the inevitiability of the
collapse of the government, with Jus
tice Minister Moshe Nissim saying. "I
think this can be assumed," and
Health Minister Eliezer Shostak de
claring, "Of course the government
will (fall). One has to go to early elec
tions, and I think this will be the opin

ion of the prime minister."
The opposition Labor Party said
yesterday it would give the govern
ment until Wednesday to dissolve the
parliament before it submits such a
motion itself.
Patch together
Begin theoretically could attempt
to patch together a slim Likud majori
ty by recruiting into the coalition
some of the Knesset's many one-man
factions, in exchange for political
promises. But the prime minister has
indicated that he would rather initiate
an "honorable" end to his government
and take his chances on a new elec
tion.
If Begin does move to dissolve the
Knesset, as expected, a national elec
tion would be held, most likely in mid-
June, five months before his four-year
term is scheduled to expire. The Labor
Party is seeking to advance the elec
tion to less than three months from
now.
Thin smile
Begin emerged from the cabinet
session looking wan but forcing a thin
smile to a crowd of waiting reporters.
Without making any comment, he got
into his car in a cold, driving rain and
was driven home.
Hurvitz, who last year was charged
by the cabinet with the task of institut
ing stringent anti-inflation measures
to salvage Israel's steadily worsening
economy, said he was unable to accept
a compromise on a special study com
mission's recommendation to in
crease the salaries of public school
teachers by 30 to 60 percent.
"I was very worried by the wording
of the compromise solution. It was too
watery. We are determined not to
break the wage front — not even to
start negotiations on the subject,"
Hurvitz said. He has warned that the
teachers wage hikes will trigger a
wave of similar demands in other sec
tors of Israel's economy and lead to la
bor bargaining chaos throughout the
country.
Wage recomendations
Cabinet secretary Areyh Naor said
the cabinet voted 11 to 2. with two
abstentions, to accept the study com
mission's wage recommendations "in
principle" and start negotiating with
the teachers. Voting against the cabi
net majoirity were Labor Minister Is
rael Katz and deputy prime minister
Yigael Yadin.
Education Minister Zevelun Ham
mer had threatened to quit the cabinet
if his position were not upheld. Ham

mer would have taken with him the 12
Knesset members of the National Re
ligious Party, thereby dooming Be
gin's Likud coalition.
Cabinet sources said Begin sought
to resolve the impasse by proposing
approval of the teachers' raises, but
postponing negotiations for payment.
Build a bridge
"We tried to find a compromise —
to build a bridge. The prime minister
did his best, and I suppose you can say
the finance minister did his best. The
name of the game is compromise, but
in the end it did not work," Naor said.
Some of the cabinet ministers, how
ever. said they were angered because
Hurvitz submitted his resignation
before the vote was taken on the wage
issue.
When asked whether Begin was se
riously considering remaining as the
head of a minority government. Naor
replied, "Anvthing's possible, but
there are questions of such a thing.
You can't be sure how people will vote
in such an arrangement. Tomorrow
we will discuss all the possibilities and
the political consequences."
Under Israeli law, Hurvitz has 48

hours in which to withdraw his resig
nation. although Naor said there
would be no attempt to dissuade him
from remaining out of the govern
ment. It was unclear last night wheth
er Begin would wait the 48 hours
before submitting a motion to dissolve
the Knesset.
On paper, the Likud coalition had
enough votes to withstand a vote of no
confidence — on Nov. 19 it survived
such a motion by only three votes —
but without the Rafi faction it would
be unable to prevail in an .opposition
challenge.
In recent days Begin has told his
closest aides that if Hurvitz resigned.
Begin would initiate steps to hold elec
tions in June or July, thereby pushing
Likud's rule past the four-year mark.
Begin, who was elected on May 17,
1977, and installed in office a month
later, would be the first prime min
ister is Israel's history to serve a full,
uninterrupted four years.
However, Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres said last night that "the
honor of the state is more important
than the honor of the (Likud) govern
ment." and that he would press for
elections in less than three months.

principle" and start negotiating with
the teachers. Voting against the cabi
net majoirity were Labor Minister Is
rael Katz and deputy prime minister
Yigael Yadin.
Education Minister Zevelun Ham
mer had threatened to quit the cabinet
if his position were not upheld. Ham

mer would have taken with him the 12
Knesset members of the National Re
ligious Party, thereby dooming Be
gin's Likud coalition.
Cabinet sources said Begin sought
to resolve the impasse by proposing
approval of the teachers' raises, but
postponing negotiations for payment.
Build a bridge
"We tried to find a compromise —
to build a bridge. The prime minister
did his best, and I suppose you can say
the finance minister did his best. The
name of the game is compromise, but
in the end it did not work," Naor said.
Some of the cabinet ministers, how
ever. said they were angered because
Hurvitz submitted his resignation
before the vote was taken on the wage
issue.
When asked whether Begin was se
riously considering remaining as the
head of a minority government. Naor
replied, "Anvthing's possible, but
there are questions of such a thing.
You can't be sure how people will vote
in such an arrangement. Tomorrow
we will discuss all the possibilities and
the political consequences."
Under Israeli law, Hurvitz has 48

hours in which to withdraw his resig
nation. although Naor said there
would be no attempt to dissuade him
from remaining out of the govern
ment. It was unclear last night wheth
er Begin would wait the 48 hours
before submitting a motion to dissolve
the Knesset.
On paper, the Likud coalition had
enough votes to withstand a vote of no
confidence — on Nov. 19 it survived
such a motion by only three votes —
but without the Rafi faction it would
be unable to prevail in an .opposition
challenge.
In recent days Begin has told his
closest aides that if Hurvitz resigned.
Begin would initiate steps to hold elec
tions in June or July, thereby pushing
Likud's rule past the four-year mark.
Begin, who was elected on May 17,
1977, and installed in office a month
later, would be the first prime min
ister is Israel's history to serve a full,
uninterrupted four years.
However, Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres said last night that "the
honor of the state is more important
than the honor of the (Likud) govern
ment." and that he would press for
elections in less than three months.
Jerusalem — Israeli Finance Min
ister Yigael Hurvitz made good on his
threat to resign yesterday, thereby
virtually assuring the collapse of the
government of Prime Minister Men
achem Begin.
After nearly eight hours of uninter
rupted debate in which Begin fruit
lessly sought to reach a compromise
in an inter-ministerial impasse over
Israel's deteriorating economy. Begin
announced through a spokesman that
the cabinet would meet again today to
discuss the "political implications" of
Hurvitz's resignation.
But because Hurvitz will take with
him the three votes of the parlia
mentary Rafi faction, thus further
diminishing Begin's already paper
thin Likud coalition majority, the only
practical option that appeared avail
able to the prime minister was to sub
mit a motion to dissolve the Knesset
(parliament) and schedule national
elections.
The cabinet ministers appeared
unanimous on the inevitiability of the
collapse of the government, with Jus
tice Minister Moshe Nissim saying. "I
think this can be assumed," and
Health Minister Eliezer Shostak de
claring, "Of course the government
will (fall). One has to go to early elec
tions, and I think this will be the opin

ion of the prime minister."
The opposition Labor Party said
yesterday it would give the govern
ment until Wednesday to dissolve the
parliament before it submits such a
motion itself.
Patch together
Begin theoretically could attempt
to patch together a slim Likud majori
ty by recruiting into the coalition
some of the Knesset's many one-man
factions, in exchange for political
promises. But the prime minister has
indicated that he would rather initiate
an "honorable" end to his government
and take his chances on a new elec
tion.
If Begin does move to dissolve the
Knesset, as expected, a national elec
tion would be held, most likely in mid-
June, five months before his four-year
term is scheduled to expire. The Labor
Party is seeking to advance the elec
tion to less than three months from
now.
Thin smile
Begin emerged from the cabinet
session looking wan but forcing a thin
smile to a crowd of waiting reporters.
Without making any comment, he got
into his car in a cold, driving rain and
was driven home.
Hurvitz, who last year was charged
by the cabinet with the task of institut
ing stringent anti-inflation measures
to salvage Israel's steadily worsening
economy, said he was unable to accept
a compromise on a special study com
mission's recommendation to in
crease the salaries of public school
teachers by 30 to 60 percent.
"I was very worried by the wording
of the compromise solution. It was too
watery. We are determined not to
break the wage front — not even to
start negotiations on the subject,"
Hurvitz said. He has warned that the
teachers wage hikes will trigger a
wave of similar demands in other sec
tors of Israel's economy and lead to la
bor bargaining chaos throughout the
country.
Wage recomendations
Cabinet secretary Areyh Naor said
the cabinet voted 11 to 2. with two
abstentions, to accept the study com
mission's wage recommendations "in
principle" and start negotiating with
the teachers. Voting against the cabi
net majoirity were Labor Minister Is
rael Katz and deputy prime minister
Yigael Yadin.
