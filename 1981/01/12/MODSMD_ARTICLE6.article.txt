# Army mutiny spurs guerrillas
## 
### Washington Post 
San Salvador — Machine-gun fire
and the blasts of rocket-propelled
grenades echoed through the dusty al
leys of working-class neighborhoods
in this capital yesterday as leftist
guerrillas staged coordinated hit-and
run attacks throughout the country in
their first concerted military drive to
overthrow the U.S.-backed regime
here.
A mutiny by elements of the
Salvadoran Army to the west has
weakened the Salvadoran regime's
show of solid opposition to the guer
rillas. A nationwide curfew was de
clared for last night from 7 p.m. to 5
a.m. today.
Scores of people were reported dead
— guerrillas, government soldiers and
civilians killed by both sides — but
there were no reliable casualty fig
ures.
Despite the ongoing fighting, the

guerrillas have not succeeded in tak
ing any major cities or garrisons, and
there is very little evidence thus far of
massive popular support for the insur
rection the leftists hope to ignite.
The government was sporadically
broadcasting reports that the situ
ation was under control, but several
government officials privately ex
pressed serious concern about a poten
tially disastrous mutiny in Santa Ana,
El Salvador's second largest city, lo
cated about 45 miles west of the capi
tal.
Soldiers rebel
A group of government soldiers re
belled there Saturday night in coordi
nations with the guerrillas' announce
ment of their final offensive.
Reporters attempting to reach the
scene yesterday were turned back at
gunpoint, but telephone interviews
with residents of Santa Ana indicated
that heavy fighting went on there

throughout the day, and that the guer
rillas occupied much of the city. At
least 40 people are believed dead.
Two-thirds of the barracks at the
2nd Infantry Brigade headquarters
were burned Saturday night, accord
ing to sources close to the military,
and the government radio announced
that a loyal colonel, Baltasar Valdez,
was murdered in the course of the
mutiny.
Revolt leaders
The leaders of the Santa Ana inci
dent, according to the government,
are Lt. Col. Albino Vladimir Cruz and
Capt. Francisco Mena Sandoval. Both
are considered loyal to liberal Col.
Adolfo Arnoldo Majano. who was
forced out of the ruling junta here last
month and has since gone into hiding.
The government radio network
called the two officers in Santa Ana
traitors and said they had gone over to
the side of the "terrorists." It is not
clear how many of their troops joined
them.
A split in the army here could be dis
astrous for the current U.S.-backed
regime, which U.S. President-elect
Ronald Reagan said he plans to con
tinue supporting.
Government coalition
This government is a coalition
between the Salvadoran armed forces
and Christian Democratic politicians,
but it stands or falls on the support of
the army.
Despite the appointment of civilian
Jose Napoleon Duarte as president
last month, the regime remains essen
tially a military government and has
grown increasingly conservative in
the 15 months since it seized power in a
bloodless coup and gained Washing
ton's backing with promised reforms
As many as 10,000 people died here
in politicai violence last year, many at
the hands of the government military,
which the leftist opposition calls gen
ocidal.
Little active support
But now, after months of waiting, as
the guerrillas launch their "final of
fensive" in earnest, they appear to be
receiving very little active support
from the people they have called on to
revolt.
As guerrillas fanned out through
some neighborhoods yesterday morn
ing. residents neither ran from them
nor to them, but watched passively as
the young leftists, many with
banadanas covering their faces,
marched bv.
