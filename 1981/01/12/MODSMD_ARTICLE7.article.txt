## Carter may aid military junta 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The State De
partment's Latin America bu
reau, despite the objections of
its ambassador in the field and
the known reluctance of Secre
tary of State Edmund Muskie,
has recommended presidential
approval of a resumption of mil
itary aid to El Salvador that
would place six U.S. heli
copters. $5 million worth of
equipment and at least six U.S.
military advisers on the ground
in that wartorn country as early
as next week, informed sources
said.
The sources said that the re
sumption of aid, which was sus
pended Dec. 5 following reports
that Salvadoran security forces
were involved in the murder of
four American churchwomen
there, is also strongly supported
by the National Security Council
and the Defense Department.
Muskie. who has vetoed in
creased assistance to El
Salvador's military-civilian
coalition on several occasions,
including a proposal last month
to send several dozen U.S. mili
tary advisers there, met Friday
on the issue with presidential se
curity adviser Zbigniew
Brezinski and Defense Secre
tary Harold Brown. Sources
said the three officials have
scheduled another meeting for
today, after which they plan to
present their recommendations
to President Jimmy Carter,
who is expected to make a de
cision early next week.
Promised investigation
Defense and NSC officials, as
well as the State Department
bureau headed by Assistant Sec
retarv of State William
Bowdler, have justified the re
sumption on grounds that a
promised investigation of the
murders is underway, with FBI
assistance. They have argued
that the Salvadoran government
has taken steps to consolidate
moderate and civilian control
over extreme rightist members
of the security forces believed
involved in widespread political
violence.
At the same time, in a series
of interdepartmental meetings

and congressional briefings,
those in favor of the aid have
maintained that U.S. in
telligence reports show marked
increases in both the calibre and
quantity of weapons flowing to
El Salvador's leftist guerrillas
over the past several weeks
from sources including
Nicaragua, Cuba, the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Libya
and Eastern Europe.
Arguing that there is no time
for delay, they have pointed to
the guerrillas' own statements
promising a "final offensive"
against the Salvadoran govern
ment before the Jan. 20 in
auguration of U.S. President
elect Ronald Reagan
(In reports Friday from El
Salvador, news agencies said
that the armed forces have been
placed on high alert but that the
anticipated allout offensive had
failed to materialize yet. There
were two reports of violence in
the capital of El Salvador be
tween soldiers and unidentified
gunmen, although no casualties
were reported.)
Administration battle
The current battle over El
Salvador within the Carter ad
ministration has somewhat al
tered the traditional lineup over
this issue and others that re
peatedly has found the State De
partment as a whole opposed to
Brezinski's NSC and the Pen
tagon.
According to sources, the
most direct opposition to the re
sumption plan so far has come
from Patricia Derian. head of
the State Department human
rights bureau. Over the past
month, since the aid was first
suspended, Derian's office has
been involved in a largely losing
protest battle as various items
of assistance have been gradu
ally reinstated.
The human-rights argument
is based on the fact that, despite
the urgency of the situation, and
the administration's Dec. 5
promise that aid would be
withheld "pending clarification
of the circumstances of the kill
ings," there is no reason to be
lieve the investigation thus far
has been either rapid, com
prehensive or conclusive.

Administration battle
The current battle over El

ministration has somewhat al

this issue and others that re

partment as a whole opposed to
Brezinski's NSC and the Pen
tagon.
According to sources, the
most direct opposition to the re
sumption plan so far has come
from Patricia Derian. head of
the State Department human
rights bureau. Over the past
month, since the aid was first
suspended, Derian's office has
been involved in a largely losing
protest battle as various items
of assistance have been gradu
ally reinstated.
The human-rights argument
is based on the fact that, despite
the urgency of the situation, and
the administration's Dec. 5
promise that aid would be
withheld "pending clarification
of the circumstances of the kill

Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the United States-educated black minister
who was in the late '70s a powerful figure in Zimbabwe (then known
as Rhodesia.) Robert Mugabe, today head of Zimbabwe, this week
ousted Edgar Tekere and demoted Joshua Nkomo, two guerrilla
comrades who helped Mugabe's coalition replace Muzorewa in Oc
tober's elections, and establish a black-ruled government.
Washington — The State De
partment's Latin America bu
reau, despite the objections of
its ambassador in the field and
the known reluctance of Secre
tary of State Edmund Muskie,
has recommended presidential
approval of a resumption of mil
itary aid to El Salvador that
would place six U.S. heli
copters. $5 million worth of
equipment and at least six U.S.
military advisers on the ground
in that wartorn country as early
as next week, informed sources
said.
The sources said that the re
sumption of aid, which was sus
pended Dec. 5 following reports
that Salvadoran security forces
were involved in the murder of
four American churchwomen
there, is also strongly supported
by the National Security Council
and the Defense Department.
Muskie. who has vetoed in
creased assistance to El
Salvador's military-civilian
coalition on several occasions,
including a proposal last month
to send several dozen U.S. mili
tary advisers there, met Friday
on the issue with presidential se
curity adviser Zbigniew
Brezinski and Defense Secre
tary Harold Brown. Sources
said the three officials have
scheduled another meeting for
today, after which they plan to
present their recommendations
to President Jimmy Carter,
who is expected to make a de
cision early next week.
Promised investigation
Defense and NSC officials, as
well as the State Department
bureau headed by Assistant Sec
retarv of State William
Bowdler, have justified the re
sumption on grounds that a
promised investigation of the
murders is underway, with FBI
assistance. They have argued
that the Salvadoran government
has taken steps to consolidate
moderate and civilian control
over extreme rightist members
of the security forces believed
involved in widespread political
violence.
At the same time, in a series
of interdepartmental meetings

and congressional briefings,
those in favor of the aid have
maintained that U.S. in
telligence reports show marked
increases in both the calibre and
quantity of weapons flowing to
El Salvador's leftist guerrillas
over the past several weeks
from sources including
Nicaragua, Cuba, the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Libya
and Eastern Europe.
Arguing that there is no time
for delay, they have pointed to
the guerrillas' own statements
promising a "final offensive"
against the Salvadoran govern
ment before the Jan. 20 in
auguration of U.S. President
elect Ronald Reagan
(In reports Friday from El
Salvador, news agencies said
that the armed forces have been
placed on high alert but that the
anticipated allout offensive had
failed to materialize yet. There
were two reports of violence in
the capital of El Salvador be
tween soldiers and unidentified
gunmen, although no casualties
were reported.)
