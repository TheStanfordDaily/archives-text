# Future negotiations still planned
## Poles strike for 40-hour week 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw, Poland — A large proportion of Po
land's industrial workers supported their new in
dependent trade union Saturday and defied gov
ernment and Communist Party orders to report to
work.
In the country's largest industrial centers,
workers stayed away from their jobs to reinforce
their union's claim for a five-day, 40-hour work
week.
The official government news agency PAP
claimed that 65 percent of the country's economic
enterprises functioned normally Saturday, but
this figure was clearly misleading.
In the major industrial centers of northern Po
land, as well as in Warsaw, Wroclaw, Lodz and
Katowice, the biggest industrial plants were
closed, or operating only with skeleton crews, ac
cording to eyewitness accounts.
Government propaganda
While the government issued no official
statement in response to the partial shutdown of
economic activity, the key evening television
news program, which is under government con
trol, attempted to show that the one-day worker
protest demonstration sponsored by Solidarity
had failed.
The government showed its concern over the
one-day work action by publishing in major news
papers a general outline of its new proposed eco
nomic reform program. An independent umbrella
group for the unions, Solidarity, has complained
that it was not fully consulted in the formation of
the program.
While the published program was vague, it did
concede the necessity for including "more inde
pendence and self-governing in all enterprises."
The evening television program showed people
shopping in Warsaw and Katowice as normal on a
Saturday. However, the program failed to show
scenes in the northern port cities, where local
sources said nearly all enterprises were closed
except for crucial food outlets.
Solidarity, which claims to represent 10 million
of the country's 13 million workers, asserts that
the government committed itself to install a 40-
hour work week as part of the agreement which
ended a series of strikes in Poland last summer.
In addition, the union, which is the first in

Eastern Europe to be formed outside Communist
Party control, claims that Polish workers were
promised a 40-hour work week 10 years ago by de
posed party leader Edward Gierek.
The government and Communist Party have re
sponded by saying that Poland's distressed econo
my cannot afford a drastic reduction in weekly
work hours. In December the government
decreed that every other Saturday would be free
instead of the normal six-day work week.
As an alternative, the government offered
workers the right to a five-day work week if they
would add 30 minutes to each working day.
A union spokesman in Gdansk, a stronghold of
the Solidarity movement, said the dispute with
the government should not be viewed as a confron
tation but "as a first step leading to an agree
ment."
"If Solidarity gets information showing the en
tire seriousness of the economic situation, Soli
darity may change its decision," he said.
Through the evening news broadcast, the gov
ernment and party accused the independent union
of an unwillingness to compromise the issue. The
impact of the newscast was to charge the union
with further endangering Poland's weakened eco
nomic condition.
Failure to deliver
Solidarity, on the other hand, said the govern
ment and party had failed to deliver on commit
ments it made to end the workers' summer
strikes.
In addition to failing to deliver on the commit
ment to a 40-hour work week, the government has
not given the new union access to the national con
trolled press as promised. The government has
also increased its pressure against political dissi
dents.
"Talks with the government will be resumed,"
the Solidarity spokesman said.
Labo% Minister Janusz Odowski, in a last
minute effort to defuse the confrontation, said the
two sides had all of January to negotiate an agree
ment on the issue. He said workers who stayed
home Saturday would be docked a day's pay, but
he did not repeat an earlier warning that they
would also lose an annual bonus worth a month's
salary.

economic activity, the key evening television
news program, which is under government con
trol, attempted to show that the one-day worker
protest demonstration sponsored by Solidarity
had failed.
The government showed its concern over the
one-day work action by publishing in major news
papers a general outline of its new proposed eco
nomic reform program. An independent umbrella
group for the unions, Solidarity, has complained
that it was not fully consulted in the formation of
the program.
While the published program was vague, it did
concede the necessity for including "more inde
pendence and self-governing in all enterprises."
The evening television program showed people
shopping in Warsaw and Katowice as normal on a
Saturday. However, the program failed to show
scenes in the northern port cities, where local
sources said nearly all enterprises were closed
except for crucial food outlets.
Solidarity, which claims to represent 10 million
of the country's 13 million workers, asserts that
the government committed itself to install a 40-
hour work week as part of the agreement which
ended a series of strikes in Poland last summer.
In addition, the union, which is the first in

Eastern Europe to be formed outside Communist
Party control, claims that Polish workers were
promised a 40-hour work week 10 years ago by de
posed party leader Edward Gierek.
The government and Communist Party have re
sponded by saying that Poland's distressed econo
my cannot afford a drastic reduction in weekly
work hours. In December the government
decreed that every other Saturday would be free
instead of the normal six-day work week.
As an alternative, the government offered
workers the right to a five-day work week if they
would add 30 minutes to each working day.
A union spokesman in Gdansk, a stronghold of
the Solidarity movement, said the dispute with
the government should not be viewed as a confron
tation but "as a first step leading to an agree
ment."
"If Solidarity gets information showing the en
tire seriousness of the economic situation, Soli
darity may change its decision," he said.
Through the evening news broadcast, the gov
ernment and party accused the independent union
of an unwillingness to compromise the issue. The
impact of the newscast was to charge the union
with further endangering Poland's weakened eco
nomic condition.
Failure to deliver
Solidarity, on the other hand, said the govern
ment and party had failed to deliver on commit
ments it made to end the workers' summer
strikes.
In addition to failing to deliver on the commit
ment to a 40-hour work week, the government has
not given the new union access to the national con
trolled press as promised. The government has
also increased its pressure against political dissi
dents.
"Talks with the government will be resumed,"
the Solidarity spokesman said.
Labo% Minister Janusz Odowski, in a last
minute effort to defuse the confrontation, said the
two sides had all of January to negotiate an agree
ment on the issue. He said workers who stayed
home Saturday would be docked a day's pay, but
he did not repeat an earlier warning that they
would also lose an annual bonus worth a month's
salary.
