# Entertainment task force report does not satisfy finance committee
## 
### Kimberly Brown 
The ASSU Senate Finance Commit
tee yesterday decided the ASSU Task
Force report on contemporary enter
tainment was "not specific enough" to
establish a replacement for Special
Kvents
The report made two final recom
mendations — that a committee be set
up to design and implement an enter
tainment project, and that a second
committee be organized to review the
entire ASSU.
The Finance Committee request for
a more detailed report will be voted on
at tomorrow's senate meeting. The
committee asked that the Task Force
be given another five weeks to com
plete the report
The Finance Committee reviewed

the final report and recommendations
compiled by the Task Force, which
was established last fall to investigate
the ASSIJ's ability to provide contem
porary entertainment on campus.
During fall quarter the Task Force
analyzed the operation of the past Spe
cial Kvents project, which was discon
tinued alter incurring a $92,000 deficit
from 1978-79
According to the report. "Special
Kvents is the ASSU. Special Events'
history reveals serious lack of con
tinuity. accountability, and pro
fessionalism which are common to all
ASSU projects." The report goes on to
recommend that ASSU pursue the ob
jectives of educational experience,
community service, and financial sta
bility for contemporary entertain

ment and all ASSU projects.
The Task Force concludes it is
"charting a difficult course." but
"firmly believes that there are
creative and constructive ways" to
overcome the problems. It is op
timistic about the future of both ASSU
and a student-run entertainment
project.
The Finance Committee found the
final report and its recommendations
"creative but not specifically
feasible."
Most committee members agreed
that the Task Force outlined too many
general,guidelines, failing to substan
tiate them with sufficient details.
The Finance Committtee unani
mously opposed the recommendation
that a committee be organized to re
view the entire ASSU. Gary Reiff.
chair of the Finance Committee,
maintained that Special Events had
inherent problems but relating these
problems to the ASSU in general is un
documented.
The committee voted to have the
Task Force spend an additional five
weeks investigating and outlining
plans for a "formal project " such as a
spring Bluegrass Festival. Task
Force members will base their study
on the guidelines of the final report,
concentrating now on practicalities
such as structural problems, funding
sources, advertising, negotiating, and
security.
Basically, the formal project
analysis will constitute a "how to" for
concert production and promotion.
Assuming the senate approves the
Task Force's five-week investigation
Wednesday night, the study will begin
immediately. Their goal will be to
have plans for a Bluegrass Festival
drawn up by February 18 — plans
which should be detailed enough to go
into action directly thereafter.
The meeting involved some debate
on what grounds the report and its
final recommendations should be ac
cepted — intrinsic value or practicali
ty.
Doug Mitchell. ASSU Senate chair
and member of the Task Force, ques
tionned the real value of ASSU's pro
ducing concerts. Reiff agreed saying
"If other departments don't want to do
concerts they must have sufficient
reason Why must we do them?"
He concluded that ASSU is placed
into a Catch-22 situation \4ithout suffi
cient reason.
