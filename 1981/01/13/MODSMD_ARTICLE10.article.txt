# Arab countries want self-defense
## U.S. bases threaten stability 
### 
Manama, Bahrain (AP) —
Arab officials on the Persian
Gulf say building U.S. military
bases to protect the vital oil
routes to the West may pose
greater threats to their stability
than do a growing Soviet in
fluence in the area or the Iran-
Iraq war
Increased U.S. presence just
a decade after the end of British
colonial rule in this area could
create a political issue that one
official described as "ex
plosive."
Senior officials in Bahrain, an

island state closely linked to
Saudi Arabia only 18 miles
away, said Persian Gulf nations
are exploring a do-it-yourself
security system for policing the
narrow. 600-mile-long water
way that leads to the Arabian
Sea and Indian Ocean.
The officials, who declined to
be identified, suggested in re
cent interviews that the West
could help by assisting the Arab
gulf states in coordinating mili
tary purchases, stockpiling
spare parts and maintaining
their new hardware.
"I doubt you will ever see
anything in writing, such as a
pact," said one official, even
though Saudi Arabia, Oman and
Kuwait have all suggested vari
ous plans.
One sign of the new self-de
fense approach was Kuwait's
purchase ear\ier this month of
eight fast-attack boats from
West Germany. Another, of
ficials here say, was the dis
patch by the United States of
four early-warning radar planes
to Saudi Arabia after the out
break of the war between Arab
Iraq and non-Arab Iran in Sep
tember.
Former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger sug
gested on his recent Middle
East tour that a permanent U.S.
presence was needed in the Per
sian Gulf area.
Kissinger's suggestion an
gered officials here, expecially
since his remarks came at a
news conference in Jerusalem,
which is viewed by Arab states
as an Islamic holy city under Is
raeli occupation.
"There can be no serious
agreement (on gulf security)
without first solving the Arab-
Israeli problem." said one sen

ior official. "Don't ask us to
look to Kabul (capital of Af
ghanistan) and Soviet occupa
tion and not look at Jerusalem
and Israeli occupation."
The linkage is enforced by
threats by extremist Palesti
nian groups to sabotage oil in
stallations or attack oil tankers
if Arab gulf states break ranks
on the Palestinian question.
Another fear expressed by
gulf officials is that an introduc
tion of U.S. troops would be seen
as a return of foreign domi
nation only a decade after Brit
ain ended colonial rule over the
sheikdoms.
Gulf officials indicate they
would welcome recovery of U.S.
prestige and power during the
administration of Ronald Rea
gan but suggest that drastic ac
tion may not be necessary to
protect the gulf, through which
pass 15 million barrels of oil dai
ly to the industralized nations of
the West.
