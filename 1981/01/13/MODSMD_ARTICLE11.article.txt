# S. Korea to hold open elections
## 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo — South Korean Presi
dent Chun Doo Hwan announced
yesterday that presidential
elections will be held next
month and said he will keep his
promise to lift martial law
before the voting begins.
The time-table announced in
Chun 's new year message was a
surprise Earlier speculation in
the South Korean capital, Seoul,
had indicated the election would
be held late in the spring, proba
bly in May.
The president, in a national
address on radio and television,
said that since "overall
domestic stability" has been
"restored." there is no reason
to delay the election.
Chun, the former army gener
al who came to power in a mili
tary crackdown last May, is ex
pected to win a seven-year term
as the candidate of a new party
whose private backers are
former army colleagues.
Little opposition
He is expected to have little
serious opposition. The major
politicians active before his
ascension to an interim presi
dential term have been ar
rested. banned from politics or
placed under house arrest.
Under the new political ar
rangement permitted to de
velop under tight government
controls, two pro-government
parties, two nominal opposition
parties and several fringe
groups are expected to field can
didates. New laws tightly re
strict the type and extent of
campaigns that can be waged.
Sources in Seoul last month
said there were several pres
sures operating to achieve an
early election, the main one
being a desire by the govern
ment to shore up its image as a
democratically elected body
and earn more respect interna
tionally. Anothier is to have a
greater appeal to South Kore
ans. many of whom regarded
the military-supported regime
as illegal under Korean law.
Domestic pressure
Chun seemed to acknowledge
the domestic pressures yester

day when he said that "the peo
ple. in their concern for stability
above all else, can hardly wait
to see the government of the
fifth republic come into being."
The continued imposition of
martial law was also generally
unpopular in South Korea. It
was partially imposed in Octo
ber. 1979, when the late Presi
dent Park Chung Hee was as
sassinated, and more strongly
enforced after student and labor
upheavals swept the country
last May.
In the traditional new year's
message, Chun also unveiled a
new wrinkle in relations with
the North Korean communists.
He invited North Korean Presi
dent Kim II Sung to visit Seoul
"without any condition attached
and free of any burden."
Safety assured
He said he would guarantee
Kim's personal safety and of
fered to let him travel to any
part of the country. Chun said he
is prepared to visit North Korea
on the same terms, if an invita
tion is forthcoming.
There was no apparent reason
to expect Chun's unusual invita
tion to be accepted by the north.
Relations have been especially
cold since last May, when Chun
took control of the government
in Seoul.
After a mild improvement in
their relations began in early
1979. giving rise to a series of
procedural talks on future unifi
cation of the countries, the at
mosphere has been intensely
hostile. The government in
Pyongyang has renewed its
propaganda attacks, calling the
Chun government a "fascist
clique," and according to South
Korean authorities has begun
sending more armed infiltration
squads into the south.
The north originally had pro
posed meetings between prime
ministers of the two countries,
following a series ,pf working
level talks.
Chun, instead, is proposing
that the country's top leaders
get together to create an at
mosphere in which eventual uni
fication could be achieved.

last May.
In the traditional new year's
message, Chun also unveiled a
new wrinkle in relations with
the North Korean communists.
He invited North Korean Presi
dent Kim II Sung to visit Seoul
"without any condition attached
and free of any burden."
Safety assured
He said he would guarantee
Kim's personal safety and of
fered to let him travel to any
part of the country. Chun said he
is prepared to visit North Korea
on the same terms, if an invita
tion is forthcoming.
There was no apparent reason
to expect Chun's unusual invita
tion to be accepted by the north.
Relations have been especially
cold since last May, when Chun
took control of the government
in Seoul.
After a mild improvement in
their relations began in early
1979. giving rise to a series of
procedural talks on future unifi
cation of the countries, the at
mosphere has been intensely
hostile. The government in
Pyongyang has renewed its
propaganda attacks, calling the
Chun government a "fascist
clique," and according to South
Korean authorities has begun
sending more armed infiltration
squads into the south.
The north originally had pro
posed meetings between prime
ministers of the two countries,
following a series ,pf working
level talks.
Chun, instead, is proposing
that the country's top leaders
get together to create an at
mosphere in which eventual uni
fication could be achieved.
