Salisbury, Zimbabwe (AP) â€” Joshua Nkomo,
chief political rival to Zimbabwe Prime Minister
Robert Mugabe, said Sunday he was refusing to
accept a ministerial demotion, causing the first
Cabinet crisis for the nine-month-old black ma
jority government.
"My position is the same,'' Home Affairs Min
ister Nkomo said in a telephone interview Sunday.
"I cannot accept this post."
Mugabe announced a Cabinet shuffle Saturday
that consolidated all economic and security
portfolios in his party's hands. Among other
things, Mugabe switched Nkomo with a member
of his dominant Zimbabwe African National Un
ion. Public Service Minister Richard Hove.
The move deprives Nkomo, leader of the Patri

otic Front party, of control over the national po
lice. Nkomo said this violated promises made af
ter British-supervised elections last February
that the two parties would share security posts.
Mugabe's Press Secretary, Godfrey Chanetsa,
said he believed Nkomo eventually would accept
the Public Service post.
"If he wants a fight on his hands, he will lose
that and lose any power he now has," Chanetsa
said.
"He has little choice but to accept our offer."
The Cabinet crisis raised fears of renewed vio
lence between the 36,000 guerrillas who remain
from rival forces led by Mugabe and Nkomo in the
seven-year war against white rule.
