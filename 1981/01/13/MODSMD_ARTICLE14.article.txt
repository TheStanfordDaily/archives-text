# There's no business like auditioning...

What "class" gives only two
units for about 250 hours of work
and still has almost 300 people
vying for 45 spaces 0
The answer: Ram's Head's
spring production of West Side
Story which will be performed
in April in Memorial
Auditorium.
Prospective Tonys. Marias
and Riffs auditioned in two-hour
blocks Saturday. Sunday and
yesterday in a process which in
volved one hour of dance in Lit
tle Theater, an hour of singing in
Mem Aud and a lot of nervous
excitement.
Picture yourself in the follow
ing setting, just having walked
up the steps of Mem Aud:
After having your picture
taken in the lobby, you sit in the
auditorium. Eleven others
either stay with you in Mem And
for singing or go with you to Lit
tle Theater for dancing (Men
should be heartened since wom
en outnumber you about three to
one and the musical is one of the
few with better male than
female parts.)
If you're in the Mem Aud
group, you settle back to watch
everyone sing the song of his or
her choice.
You may notice producer
Jane Wollenberg, director Steve
Ullman and music director
Mark Swanson observing the
performances since they pick
the cast. Wollenberg herself
was chosen last spring bv the
previous producer.
A production staff of about 25
was organized fall quarter. Eve
ry member of the group is a stu
dent.
When everyone has both sung

and read the West Side Story
excerpt involved in the audition
packet, you move to the Little
Theater
Your dance instructor says
"keep up that energy" as you
learn a Puerto Rican folk dance
and four basic points for im
provisation. Another exercise
uses group movements similar
to those required in the actual
production
You may be worrying since
you are a singer and not a
ballerina but the directors are
looking for energy, vitality,
drive and learning ability. Tech
nical Director Vince Foecke ex
plained. "There are a lot more
criteria than simply being a
good dancer."
And Wollenberg pointed out.
"If someone looks right and acts
right, we can teach them."
You may also be concerned
since only about 140 people usu
ally audition for shows here. But
the cast is twice as large as that
of some previous shows, such as
Pippin, which Ram's Head put
on last spring, and there are ad
ditional openings in the off
stage chorus and technical
crew About 150 people will be
incorporated in some aspect of
the production.
Now that you've completed
the surprisingly enjoyable audi
tion process, all that's left is
hand-wringing until today when
call-backs are announced.
Remember that selection is
difficult for the directors as

well. "It's a painful process for
us trying to get 50 out of so much
talent." said Wollenberg. "A lot
of people who've been leads,
directing and producing other
productions are here."
Casting will be announced
Friday and rehearsals will start
next week The cast will re
hearse three times a week win
ter quarter A rehearsal retreat
to Lake Tahoe is also planned
for the first weekend of spring
quarter
Spring break rehearsals are
also scheduled because of short
er than usual rehearsal time.
Also. West Side Story is a dif
ficult. complex show to pro
duce.
According to Wollenberg.
"We (the directors) are going to
try to keep it very structured
and not burn out people." Over
all, she said, "we hope thai we

have the same kind of feel" as
â€¢Jesus Christ Superstar. The
budget will be smaller, how
ever. at about $15,000
The show will have several
new twists. For example, both
the time and the city will be un
specific.
And. according to Wollen
berg. Ullman does not want any
visible difference to exist in the
gangs. "Racially, he intends on
not making the Jets light and the
Sharks dark," she said "We
want it to reach the whole cam
pus. to represent all elements of
the campus."
Wollenberg hopes 10.000 peo
ple will see the show which will
play split weekends for six
nights rather than the tradi
tional four consecutive nights.
The show will be performed
Apr. 16. 17. 18 . 23 . 24 and 25.
