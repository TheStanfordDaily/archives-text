## El Salvador another Communist deception? 
### 
The El Salvador Solidarity
Committee claims that the
Salvador civil war derives from
a genuinely popular revolt, that
American fears regarding the
creation of a new communist
state derive from anti-Com
munist hysteria. I wonder how
many of the 90 Stanford faculty
members who have signed an
open letter to President Carter
concerning the Salvador issue
are aware of Communist
camouflage tactics and of past
parallels. A detailed survey
would require a full-length arti
cle. 1 shall content myself with a
few examples.
During World War II the Yu
goslav communists solemnly
declared that they aimed only at
the national liberation of their
country and not at overthrowing
the existing social order. Within
a few years, these promises
were forgotten. The original
program of the East German
Socialist Unity Party (itself a
camouflage for a communist
party) was actually less radical

than that of the German Social
Democratic Party; but the par
ty line changed soon enough.
During the three years 1945 to
1948. most right-thinking, that is
to say. left-inclined intellec
tuals in the Western world were
convinced that the Czech com
munists should be taken at their
word, that Czechoslovakia was
quite different, that Czechoslo
vakia would maintain her ac
customed liberties within a so
cialist framework The Prague
coup of 1948. however, disap
pointed these hopes and put a
hard-line Stalinist regime in
power.
Middle-aged readers will
likewise remember Western
newspaper propaganda with re
gard to the Chinese communists
who — according to the Western
prestige media — were nothing
but agrarian reformers or Jef
fersonian democrats. But the
credulous were soon un
deceived.
Cuba's experience was little
different. Castro seized power

in the guise of a Cuban na
tionalist; The New York Times
assured us'that stories concern
ing his communist affiliations
were but the product of Cold
War propaganda. A few years
later Castro publicly boasted of
the manner in which he had
always followed the Marxist-
Leninist path.
Then came the Vietnam War.
Campus activists never tired of
telling us the war derived from
a popular movement launched
by South Vietnamese guerrillas
battling for national liberation
from the American yoke. No
one, least of all the Hanoi gov
ernment, now denies that the
war was decided by regular
forces from North Vietnam,
that the Viet Cong in South Viet
nam played but a minor part,
that the balance of power in the
new Vietnam overwhelmingly
rests with the north, and that
the aim of the war was to set up
a hardline communist regime in
alliance with Moscow.
Americans, we were told dur
ing those far-off days of campus
revolt, acted in the manner of
criminal lunatics, especially
when they invaded Cambodia.
Cambodia was a supposedly
neutral state, wrecked by U.S.

intervention. Now Prince
Sihanouk openly admits what
he had denied in the past, that
communist forces were operat
ing against the Americans from
Cambodian soil, and that he had
authorized Czechs. Chinese,
Russians and others to use the
port of Sihanoukville (Kompong
Som) as an unloading point for
supplies to the Vietminh and the
Vietcong.
Marxist-Leninist tactics of
concealment are no different in
Africa. While the war against
Portugal was going on, MLPA
(Popular Movement for Liber
ation of Angola) emissaries in
this country played down or de
nied their communist affilia
tions. My colleague Peter
Duignan and I were much re
viled by reviewers in 1961 for
pointing out some of these links
in a published work. Now the
MPLA takes pride in its tran
formation from a "popular
movement," embracing the
progressive elements of the
bourgeoisie and the petty
bourgeoisie as well as peasants
and workers to a Marxist-
Leninist party. The new party
now does what the "movement"
denied in the past. The MPLA
rigidly follows the dictates of

"democratic centralism;" it
depends on Havana and Moscow
for its existence.
There is nothing mysterious
about communist camouflage
techniques, as elaborated by
Lenin. Lenin proclaimed that
left to its own devices, the work
ing class will only acquire a
trade union consciousness, that
is to say. they will battle only for
better wages and working condi
tions. The proletariat thus re
quires a disciplined Marxist-
Leninist party to lead the work
ers. The dictatorship of the pro
letariat turns out to be the dic
tatorship over the proletariat.
This dictatorship is imposed
step by step, through a series of
class alliances. As the revolu
tion advances, yesterday's
friends become enemies, des
tined for the dustbin of history.
There is no mystery about
these tactics, well-publicized by
Marxist-Leninist theoreticians.
The mystery lies in the manner
in which decent, well-meaning
progressives allow themselves
to be fooled over and over again.
The imbroglio in Salvador is ad
mittedly of a complex kind. But
we do have a duty to be wary.
