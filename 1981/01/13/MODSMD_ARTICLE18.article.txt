Right to resist
I was both angered and scared
when I read Scott Richter's edi
torial entitled "Register for the
Draft or Pay the Price" (Daily,
Jan. 8).
Although I am opposed to
draft registration and Richter
defended the pro-draft side of
the issue, that is not why I am
writing this letter. What I find
objectionable and downright
frightening is his idea of "stoic
compliance." Asks Richter. "If
the one law be unjust, is not
payment of the penalty still due
for the protection given by all
laws?"
I find this idea in conflict with
the basic principles of freedom
and democracy. Indeed, I have
always felt that if a law is un
just. people should fight it until
it is changed. If everyone were
to always comply, we would be
come a society of mindless ro
bots doing whatever the govern
ment wanted us to do. Living in
this country would be an Or
wellian nightmare. What is the
use of fighting the Russians if
we have to stoop to their level to
do it?
I would like to remind Richter
that the need to fight unjust

laws was the main principle be
hind the American REvolution.
Did the colonies have a moral
obligation not to resist British
rule simply because it would in
volve breaking the law? If
Americans had always met un
just laws with stoic or apathetic
compliance, we would still have
slavery and prohibition, and the
vote would be restricted to
landed white males over the age
of 21.
Richter may not agree with
those who feel that draft regis
tration is wrong, and he is cer
tainly entitled to his opinion, but
I find it disturbing that anyone
would tell another person to
abandon his or her deeply held
moral convictions just because
of something Socrates did, or
that anyone would so blindly
confuse legality with morality.

My letter is in response to
Hewitt D. Crane's opinion in the
Jan. 7 issue stating that ad
vertisements on Stanford's
basketball scoreboard add "a
hick-town flavor and slightly

raw edge to an otherwise great
academic University campus."
The number of "hick-town" res
idents attending Stanford may
be small, but I for one took
Crane's letter as an insult to my
background. I couldn't care less
if Stanford's scoreboard is com
pletely covered with advertise
ments. but I do mind when some
self-appointed big shot thumbs
his nose at us "hicks". If you
don't get your nose out of the
air, Mr. Crane, you may drown
in the next rain storm. Besides,
since when does the appearance
of a scoreboard indicate the
level of academic sophistication
of a university?
