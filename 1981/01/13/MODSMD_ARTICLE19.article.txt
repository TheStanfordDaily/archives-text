## Harold Montgomery Personality and campus art 
### 
Everybody talks about art
having a personality But con
clusions about individual works
are largely projections of the
viewer's attitudes onto the
lifeless hulk After all. if beauty
is in the eye of the beholder,
then personality is in the psy
chosis of the analyst. For in
stance. there is the hackneyed
proverb of the half full or half
empty water glass While it is
undoubtedly true that most
works of art do evoke an emo
tional response from even the
most casual of passers-by. it is
surely shaky turf to claim that
the active personality of the art
work inflicts such a perception

on said viewer.
Rather, it is for basic reasons
of form or color or position (or
lack thereof), that people of
identifiable types tend to group
around the fountain, sculpture,
or in sad cases.' the open space
which creates a compatible am
biance for their lifestyle. The
socialite finds himself at the
Tresidder terrace, even in the
worst of weather: the cynic at
the claw: and the future scrap
metal dealer at the Italian
House sculpture.
The place to be if you are feel
ing schizophrenic is obviously
the Albers' Wall. Depending on
which personality has a grip on
you at the moment, you can
choose either the East or West
face. Feeling happy? Then try
the West face in the afternoon.
As .you walk down its length,
note how the sun gleams off the
little metal sticks, as if some so
lar computer were reading the
wall's primitive form of com
munication with its Ã¼biquitous
electric eye. There must be
some sort of message in
corporated into the arrange
ment of the metal rods and un
derstanding it is only a matter
of emotive interpretation. To
me. the West face is an open ad
monition to look at the other
side.
The East face is a truly
fascinating work of art. It is
never still. Initially it is the
complex geometric shapes that
grab one's attention. But even
tually. the reflective properties
of the highly polished black
granite panels entrance the
viewer. The unhappy schizoid
should pause on this side of the
wall and contemplate the depth
of its blackness; the clarity of
the reflection; the fact that the
panels don't quite fit together;
the place in the center of the
wall where the viewer can stand
and see no reflection of himself;
the condition of his hair; move
on about his business; and final
ly. realize that whatever had
him down before is probably
now gone.
The diehard schizoid can
choose neither side, for his mind
is so purely divided that only an
edgeof the wall will do. Theonly
solution for this person is to
dress as weirdly as possible, as
sume the lotus position directly
in front of his favorite edge,
wait for Physics 51 to dismiss,
and be prepared to face the ridi
cule of thousands of physics
nerds.
The striking thing about the
Green Library fountain is that
one can never tell exactly how
long it will stay standing up.
Like the second story modules
of the Library itself, we expect
the fountain to have a structural
half life of a year or so, at which
time it will simply fall over,
passing into artistic oblivion,
and providing material for in
numerable administrative
headaches and Daily columns
like this one.
Having previously seen it only

in photographs. I was surprised
to find that the fountain in fact
spouts downward: I had ex
pected the reverse. I was
shocked, experiencing the same
kind of surprise one feels upon
learning that Harry Truman
was really only 5-foot-10. What a
delightfui sight it would be. I
had thought in my foolish in
nocence. to see this weird piece
of metal spewing water tens of
feet in the air. drenching the
passers-by. and slowly flooding
the courtyard How delightful.
But it was not to be.
Still, there remains this
gnawing feeling of structural in
stability What will happen to it
when the winds come in the
spring? Within what distance
will it be safe to park one's bike
on windy days 9 Unlike Meyer
Library, which we all secretly
wish would fall down but won't,
the Green Library fountain
seems destined to.
The fountain has that wonder
ful intangible quality that
makes you want to run up and
hang something off of it. And. in
fact, that is exactly what people
do. At any given time, you can
always find someone's finest at
tempt at improving campus art
slung over the big red I.U.D.
This art. then, is art for the
do-er (pronounced Dewar).
Here is art for the person who
likes to participate; to get in his
own piece of over-sized col
legiate graffito and display it
for the world's perusal.
The fountain behind Memori
al Church must be the premier
candidate for the nerd fountain
on campus. Simple in its sym
metry. yet complex in the
number of tiles in the fountain
itself, the Keith Memorial Ter
race offers a secluded spot for
those the world would probably
rather be left alone.
The mathematical possi
bilities for entertainment here
approach infinity. Try this:
count the number of tiles in the
fountain, multiply by the
number of letters in the word
sesquepedalian. divide by 93,
and. BINGO! You have the dis
tance in cubits to the nearest of
fice supply store.
If you forgot your calculator,
take a look at the tiles on the
ground, and note that they are
hexagonal. Getting interesting,
isn't if Remember that the
measure of each angle in a regu
lar hexagon is 120". I'll leave this
one to your imagination.
Then, do fun things with the
number six. Multiply it by 60.
and remember that was
how much money you spent at
the Tresidder game room last
week Write three of them in a
circle, and remember the movie
The Omen. Remember how bad
it was. Remember that you're
late for class. Remember to
forget that you ever came here
in the first place.
