From the Daily wire services
Iran took legal steps yesterday to
open the way to resolving the hostage
crisis, but a U.S. negotiating team re
ported "serious problems" in gaining
Iranian approval of a Carter adminis
tration plan to exchange frozen Ira
nian assets for the 52 American cap
tives.
President Jimmy Carter, asked
about prospects for a settlement,
said: "It looks better but I can't pre
dict success." Carter said. "We've
made them (the Iranians) a reason
able proposition."
The speaker of Iran's Parliament.
Hashemi Rafsanjani. told a news con

Iran's Parliament was presented
with two emergency bills aimed at

hostages at the same time Iran re

The agreement, which would call
for an initial return to Iran of $2.5

terms in much the same way that one
administration is bound by a treaty

hostages, sources said.
