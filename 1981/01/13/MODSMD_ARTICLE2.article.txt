# Problems still impede speedy hostage release
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Iran took legal steps yesterday to
open the way to resolving the hostage
crisis, but a U.S. negotiating team re
ported "serious problems" in gaining
Iranian approval of a Carter adminis
tration plan to exchange frozen Ira
nian assets for the 52 American cap
tives.
President Jimmy Carter, asked
about prospects for a settlement,
said: "It looks better but I can't pre
dict success." Carter said. "We've
made them (the Iranians) a reason
able proposition."
The speaker of Iran's Parliament.
Hashemi Rafsanjani. told a news con
ference in Tehran that "all roads"
were open to settling the 14-month-old
hostage issue and that he expected
parliamentary approval of two emer
gency bills on arbitration of Iranian
and American claims and nationaliz
ing the wealth of the late shah of Iran.
Iran's Parliament was presented
with two emergency bills aimed at
solving the U.S. hostage crisis by Jan.
16. four days before the inauguration
of President-elect Ronald Reagan,
who has warned he will conduct
hostage talks with a "clean slate."
"If we do not reach a result by Jan.
16 it is not clear how the negotiations
will continue with the new incoming
administration," Iran's top hostage

negotiator. Behzad Nabavi. said in
presenting the legislation
Carter has set Jan. 16 as the dead
line bv which a hostage agreement
must be reached if the terms are to be
put into effect before Reagan is in
augurated Jan 20.
Reagan said Sunday he will start on
the hostage talks with a clean slate if
Carter fails to get an agreement. "I
still hope and prav the president will
succeed in what he has been trying to
do. If not. then we have to start." Rea
gan said
The Carter administration is work
ing on a "legally binding" plan that
calls for freeing the 52 American
hostages at the same time Iran re
ceives the first of three installments
of its frozen assets, informed sources
said yesterday
The agreement, which would call
for an initial return to Iran of $2.5
billion in assets from the U.S. Federal
Reserve Bank, would have the effect
of "binding" Carter's successor to its
terms in much the same way that one
administration is bound by a treaty
signed by another.
But just as a later administration
can abrogate a treaty. Reagan could
overturn any agreement on the
hostages, sources said.
Administration officials said thev
consider that highly unlikely in light of
the historical continuity of U.S. for
eign policy. But Reagan has said he
will not unconditionally accept any
solution agreed to by the Carter ad
ministration.
Nabavi said the first emergency bill
asks the Parliament, or Majlis, to ap
prove a third-party arbitrator to settle
financial and legal claims between
Iran and the United States.

The second bill asks the Majlis to
nationalize the wealth of the late shah
and his relatives, Nabavi said, a move
that would make it easier for the Unit
ed States to return the shah's assets to
Iran.
Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Ra
jai's office announced that a claims
committee had been established in
Iran and told Iranian companies and
individuals with claims against the
United States or debts to the United
States to submit substantiating docu
ments within 30 days, according to the
official news agency Pars.
Rajai. according to Tehran Radio,
said resolution of the hostage issue "is
making progress." but neither Rajai
nor Rafsanjani would predict whether
Iran would approve the newest Ameri
can proposals or when the hostages
would be freed.
