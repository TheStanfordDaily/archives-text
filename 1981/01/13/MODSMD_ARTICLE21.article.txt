Washington (AP> — To keep
up with the new technology of
harnessing the sun's power to
heat, cool and light the nation's
buildings, a special lexicon has
emerged to describe the prin
ciples and concepts surrounding
solar energy applications, ac
cording to the Solar Energy Re
search Institute (SERI).
A sample of the solar glossary
includes:
Absorptivity — the ratio of so
lar energy absorbed by a sur
face to the solar energy striking
it. All solar-heating systems are
based on storing solar energy
within a material for a period of
time, whereas cooling systems
use materials with low
absorptivity to do exactly the
opposite.
Clerestory — a window that is
placed vertically (or nearly so)
in a wall or roof above one's line
of vision in order to supply natu
ral light to a building.
Convection — the transfer of
heat energy from one location to
another by the circulatory mo
tion of air or water which has
been heated.

Glazing — covering with one
or more panes of glass or sheets
of plastic.
Greenhouse Effect — refers
to the tendency of some trans
parent materials such as glass
to block and transmit radiation,
incorporating both direct
Heat sink — a masscapableof
absorbing heat, such as con
crete or other masonry walls
and floors, barrels of water.
Passive system — a solar
heating or cooling system that
uses no external mechanical
power to move or store solar
heat.
Retrofitting — the installa
tion of a solar heating or cooling
system into an existing build
ing.
Thermal mass — the amount
of potential heatstorage capaci
ty available in a given assembly
or system. Drum walls, con
crete floors and adobe walls are
examples of thermal mass.
Trombe wall — named for
Felix Trombe of France, it is a
thick concrete wall sometimes
used in passive solar heating
systems.
