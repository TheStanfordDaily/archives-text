"He's netting older, and he's
netting fatter. " Suzie Mutant of
the Mutants
Don't get the wrong idea. This
here review aims to be a favor
rebel one. I'm not goin to call
him God or anything like that-he
didn't even look like a KING
(OK. let's be frank, could any of
you really read that Springsteen
review in this rag some months
ago without makin a gaggin
dash for the potty?). IN FACT
for all of you who DID NOT get
to see Elvis because the tickets
went on sale the Sunday after
finals were over, I'll tell you
what he looked like — he looked
like mv Uncle Tom-honest to
GOD! '
Uncle Tom is about fiftieish
with a comfortable pot and hair
baldin into a dignified grey
(conservative cut). He's a lead
er (i.e. plant manager) among
men and furniture factory work
ers. and likes to tell alota bad
nigger jokes too. but unlike
Elvis, he knows better than to
tell them in public places. But
back to Elvis . . . this guy
walked out on the stage in a
ghastly looking green suit, vest
right offa the back of the
barkeep in GUNSMOKE-vou
know, lotsa gold and black
thread with intricate design,
and . . an ascot?! Yeah, that's
what it was. my date confirmed
it Not even a frickin skinny
TIE. Is this New Wave or
WHAT? he don't look a thing
like his picture on Taking Liber
ties.
OK OK looks ain't everything.
My uncle, though sometimes a
chump. WAS a good provider for
seven voracious kids. And after
the first thirty minutes passed. I
quit sweatin and sneakin anx
ious looks at my watch. Yeah. 90
minutes for 2500 of us. No longer
an asshole, Elvis is now a good
provider, too (I thought Uncle
Tom might go one up on him).
I was upstairs in the bar when
Elvis came out on the stage —
Didn't get back downstairs in
time. But I'd heard from the
night before that he soloed sans
Attractions the first song,
standing in the dark as the lights
came up slowly on all his guilt
ridden and vengeful glory. Just
like the guys in The Dirty Dozen
when they sneak into the kraut
headquarters under cover of
dark but by the time they pull
outta that place at the end of the
flick, everything's blown to hell
and burnin in the night and the
1/2 Dozen (that's what's left of
em) don't even need to use the
headlights on their trucks as
they tear off
Well, although I missed the
BIG entree. I didn't really miss
much. He sang a new song (so
I'm told) that I wouldn'uv rec
ognized anyway but then he
called up the boys from "A"
Company (a. Pete b. Steve c.
Bruce) and the hits FINALLY
began to fit the fans! Armed
Forces are what we're talkin
about, and Accidents Will Hap
pen no doubt referred to that
tear jerkin scene where what

zizname gets in the back as the
Dozen pulls out guns, blasin, af
ter the successful mission
Boohoo
Most of the concert followed
along the same lines and that is
to say it was one crowd pleasin
number after another. IN
FACT. I think those folk in the
front row were strung up by
their thumbs as they dangled
there ALL NIGHT (just like
Mussolini, except they got him
upside down and bv the ankles).
A good percentage of the songs
came off the (let Happy album
and it was truly a wonder to see
that they hadn't lost any of the
Delerious hurry up of the re
cordings (none of them had for
that matter). He got some of the
real bitter medicine down with
the first few numbers: songs
like "B-Movie" released his
frustrations brought on by his
past experiences with vagina
dentata and those blood sucking
boor j wars.
I'm not a man who allows
himself to be swayed by the easy
outs advocated by popular psy
chology — or popular music for
that matter But what a fever he
started in my hrain. As he
jerked through this one, I be
came aware of a dropping toler
ance level-nasty stuff-vicious
thoughts towards old girlfriends
that was squeezing my shrink
ing heart. And when he got to
that line . . . H-movie that's all
yeirr to me. . . (rant no woman
to art on me // can't stand it
irhen I throw punchlines you
ran t FEEL. I made for my
date's throat and tried to choke
her while actually seein the
faces of three or four other
groovy babes that had done me
the dirty on previous occasions.
So what's so bad about a little
group therapy? After Elvis
helped us flush away all these
festerin hostilities, he decided it
was time to provide a more re
laxing atmosphere. Followin a
few new numbers (to be re
leased soon on another new LP >
he got familiar again with the
slowdown version of
"downtime Is Over" while
changin his demeanor from sub
human rage to just plain
PATHETIC!
He's got this habit of lettin
loosa the guitar and makin these
awful twitchin gestures with the
arms They looked like they
were pinned to his side, so of
course all he can do is rotate at
the elbows.
I was thinkin that this guy
could've made Jerry Lewis a
great poster child.He didn't do
too much more of that though-I
guess even HE could tell how
ugly he was makin himself on
that one Look at the picture! I
think it was taken during
"downtime" Ugly, huh? But
you should uv heard his voice
( The ('hron said he sang like a
rifle range and that was a nice
insight in another wise dismal
review)! Tootin through "Sec
ondary Modern" he threw up his
forearms and huzzahed the way
Brother McDonald at the First
Weslevan Church did when he

used to GET BLESSED every
Sunday right after the hymn. I
thought the ol' Costello boy was
goin to be assumed into some
it here (i.e. heaven, limbo, ob
servational isolation)!
NOW IT'S ALMOST THE
END OF THE CONCERT AND
ONE THING IS PUTTIN A BIG
DISAPPOINTMENT IN MY
EVENING By that I mean
Elvis did not stand pigeoned
toed and knee knockered
ONCE'! And I know he knows
how to do it: he did it on Satur
day Night Live and he does it on
a t-shirt I have. Even Bro
McDonald at 75 fell out into the
aisle splav-legged now and
again-but no. just those hideous
arm rotations ... AH WELL.
But posturing or no, Elvis and
those marvelous Attractions
still had em reachin for the sky
allnight and when the lads
zipped off the stage without
havin played "Alison" or
"Watching the Detectives", I
knew he wasn't going to gyp us
out of an encore this time round.
And that's exactly the way it
was. How the fans love to hear
"Watching the Detectives,"
cause when he gets to the line
where he sez: It took a miracle
to get you to stay It only toook
uh man Lit-tu! FINgahtoHUL
LO-<)-()W )'EW A-ii aaay-uh
they say, "YASS. YASS! Shoot
me Elvis!" and then they pogo
with that little extra twist, and
jerk back their shoulders as if
they just caught a slug in their
coliective chest. AND THEN,
"A" Company exits stage right,
leavin the place in a steamin
ruin, bodies everywhere,
guitars raised overhead like
Thompson sub-machine guns.
Hey . . . this ain't rock'n'roll,
this is genocide.

Don't get the wrong idea. This

review in this rag some months

for all of you who DID NOT get
to see Elvis because the tickets
went on sale the Sunday after
finals were over, I'll tell you
what he looked like — he looked
like mv Uncle Tom-honest to
GOD! '
Uncle Tom is about fiftieish
with a comfortable pot and hair
baldin into a dignified grey
(conservative cut). He's a lead
er (i.e. plant manager) among
men and furniture factory work
ers. and likes to tell alota bad
nigger jokes too. but unlike
Elvis, he knows better than to
tell them in public places. But

right offa the back of the
barkeep in GUNSMOKE-vou

thread with intricate design,

what it was. my date confirmed

like his picture on Taking Liber

OK OK looks ain't everything.
My uncle, though sometimes a

the first thirty minutes passed. I
quit sweatin and sneakin anx

minutes for 2500 of us. No longer
an asshole, Elvis is now a good
provider, too (I thought Uncle
Tom might go one up on him).
I was upstairs in the bar when
Elvis came out on the stage —
Didn't get back downstairs in
time. But I'd heard from the
night before that he soloed sans
Attractions the first song,
standing in the dark as the lights
came up slowly on all his guilt
ridden and vengeful glory. Just
like the guys in The Dirty Dozen
when they sneak into the kraut
headquarters under cover of
dark but by the time they pull
outta that place at the end of the

began to fit the fans! Armed

about, and Accidents Will Hap
pen no doubt referred to that
tear jerkin scene where what

zizname gets in the back as the
Dozen pulls out guns, blasin, af

Most of the concert followed
along the same lines and that is
to say it was one crowd pleasin
number after another. IN

front row were strung up by
their thumbs as they dangled
there ALL NIGHT (just like
Mussolini, except they got him
upside down and bv the ankles).
A good percentage of the songs
came off the (let Happy album
and it was truly a wonder to see
that they hadn't lost any of the
Delerious hurry up of the re
cordings (none of them had for

real bitter medicine down with
the first few numbers: songs
like "B-Movie" released his
frustrations brought on by his
past experiences with vagina
dentata and those blood sucking
boor j wars.
I'm not a man who allows
himself to be swayed by the easy
outs advocated by popular psy
chology — or popular music for
that matter But what a fever he

Don't get the wrong idea. This
here review aims to be a favor
rebel one. I'm not goin to call
him God or anything like that-he
didn't even look like a KING
(OK. let's be frank, could any of
you really read that Springsteen
review in this rag some months
ago without makin a gaggin
dash for the potty?). IN FACT
for all of you who DID NOT get
to see Elvis because the tickets
went on sale the Sunday after
finals were over, I'll tell you
what he looked like — he looked
like mv Uncle Tom-honest to
GOD! '
Uncle Tom is about fiftieish
with a comfortable pot and hair
baldin into a dignified grey
(conservative cut). He's a lead
er (i.e. plant manager) among
men and furniture factory work
ers. and likes to tell alota bad
nigger jokes too. but unlike
Elvis, he knows better than to
tell them in public places. But
back to Elvis . . . this guy
walked out on the stage in a
ghastly looking green suit, vest
right offa the back of the
barkeep in GUNSMOKE-vou
know, lotsa gold and black
thread with intricate design,
and . . an ascot?! Yeah, that's
what it was. my date confirmed
it Not even a frickin skinny
TIE. Is this New Wave or
WHAT? he don't look a thing
like his picture on Taking Liber
ties.
OK OK looks ain't everything.
My uncle, though sometimes a
chump. WAS a good provider for
seven voracious kids. And after
the first thirty minutes passed. I
quit sweatin and sneakin anx
ious looks at my watch. Yeah. 90
minutes for 2500 of us. No longer
an asshole, Elvis is now a good
provider, too (I thought Uncle
Tom might go one up on him).
I was upstairs in the bar when
Elvis came out on the stage —
Didn't get back downstairs in
time. But I'd heard from the
night before that he soloed sans
Attractions the first song,
standing in the dark as the lights
came up slowly on all his guilt
ridden and vengeful glory. Just
like the guys in The Dirty Dozen
when they sneak into the kraut
headquarters under cover of
dark but by the time they pull
outta that place at the end of the
flick, everything's blown to hell
and burnin in the night and the
1/2 Dozen (that's what's left of
em) don't even need to use the
headlights on their trucks as
they tear off
Well, although I missed the
BIG entree. I didn't really miss
much. He sang a new song (so
I'm told) that I wouldn'uv rec
ognized anyway but then he
called up the boys from "A"
Company (a. Pete b. Steve c.
Bruce) and the hits FINALLY
began to fit the fans! Armed
Forces are what we're talkin
about, and Accidents Will Hap
pen no doubt referred to that
tear jerkin scene where what

zizname gets in the back as the
Dozen pulls out guns, blasin, af
ter the successful mission
Boohoo
Most of the concert followed
along the same lines and that is
to say it was one crowd pleasin
number after another. IN
FACT. I think those folk in the
front row were strung up by
their thumbs as they dangled
there ALL NIGHT (just like
Mussolini, except they got him
upside down and bv the ankles).
A good percentage of the songs
came off the (let Happy album
and it was truly a wonder to see
that they hadn't lost any of the
Delerious hurry up of the re
cordings (none of them had for
that matter). He got some of the
real bitter medicine down with
the first few numbers: songs
like "B-Movie" released his
frustrations brought on by his
past experiences with vagina
dentata and those blood sucking
boor j wars.
I'm not a man who allows
himself to be swayed by the easy
outs advocated by popular psy
chology — or popular music for
that matter But what a fever he
started in my hrain. As he
jerked through this one, I be
came aware of a dropping toler
ance level-nasty stuff-vicious
thoughts towards old girlfriends
that was squeezing my shrink
ing heart. And when he got to
that line . . . H-movie that's all
yeirr to me. . . (rant no woman
to art on me // can't stand it
irhen I throw punchlines you
ran t FEEL. I made for my
date's throat and tried to choke
her while actually seein the
faces of three or four other
groovy babes that had done me
the dirty on previous occasions.
So what's so bad about a little
group therapy? After Elvis
helped us flush away all these
festerin hostilities, he decided it
was time to provide a more re
laxing atmosphere. Followin a
few new numbers (to be re
leased soon on another new LP >
he got familiar again with the
slowdown version of
"downtime Is Over" while
changin his demeanor from sub
human rage to just plain
PATHETIC!
He's got this habit of lettin
loosa the guitar and makin these
awful twitchin gestures with the
arms They looked like they
were pinned to his side, so of
course all he can do is rotate at
the elbows.
I was thinkin that this guy
could've made Jerry Lewis a
great poster child.He didn't do
too much more of that though-I
guess even HE could tell how
ugly he was makin himself on
that one Look at the picture! I
think it was taken during
"downtime" Ugly, huh? But
you should uv heard his voice
( The ('hron said he sang like a
rifle range and that was a nice
insight in another wise dismal
review)! Tootin through "Sec
ondary Modern" he threw up his
forearms and huzzahed the way
Brother McDonald at the First
Weslevan Church did when he

used to GET BLESSED every
Sunday right after the hymn. I
thought the ol' Costello boy was
goin to be assumed into some
it here (i.e. heaven, limbo, ob
servational isolation)!
NOW IT'S ALMOST THE
END OF THE CONCERT AND
ONE THING IS PUTTIN A BIG
DISAPPOINTMENT IN MY
EVENING By that I mean
Elvis did not stand pigeoned
toed and knee knockered
ONCE'! And I know he knows
how to do it: he did it on Satur
day Night Live and he does it on
a t-shirt I have. Even Bro
McDonald at 75 fell out into the
