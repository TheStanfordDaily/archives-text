# Master saxman: Tabackin blows Dink away
## 
### Gregory Murphy 
The Lew Tabackin Trio
played two excellent shows at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium Friday
night, in spite of a small and
partly somnolent audience. Per
haps because the two-show
structure is such a poor value
compared to a club date (non
students paid $8 50 for one hour
and-a-half show), the first show
was about two-thirds full and
the second was a sickly one
quarter full. The absent jazz
fans missed a man who is both
one of the finest tenor sax
ophonists around and one of the
most distinctive flutists in jazz.
Tabackin's fame results from
his spot as featured soloist in the
Toshiko Akiyoshi-Lew Tabackin
Big Band (perennial poll win
ners who played on campus last
spring), but the concert Friday
showed that he could drive a
small group with equal success.
With John Baron on drums and
Mike Moore on bass, he gave an
exciting and varied show in

spite of the potential for
boredom that such small groups
often engender.
It was instructive to compare
Tabackin to Sonny Rollins, who
appeared on the same stage a
year ago. Rollins is clearly one
of Tabackin s strongest modern
influences — the growling tone,
speedy improvisation, use of
blues riffs, and even choice of
compositions reflect this. How
ever, the differences, rather
than the similarities, between
the two may tell us a great deal
about Tabackin's musical goals.
One interesting difference is
their use of the microphone (be
lieve it or not) Rollins kept the
mike strapped to his horn,
which gave him freedom of
movement and an impressive,
full sound Tabackin achieved
the same freedom of movement
bv avoiding the mike altogeth
er. While playing, he strode
back and forth across the stage,
stopping at the most intense
parts and jerking the sax and his
legs in a funny sort of dance. But
ultimately, his avoidance of the
mike was based on musical rea
sons, namely a desire to pre
serve the beautiful fillips and
flutters, the variations in tone
that create the art of the sax
ophone. The few times that he

used the microphone (mostly
with flute) there was an audible
decrease in sound quality, as
if the music's sharp edge had
been dulled.
Another difference between
Rollins and Tabackin is the lat
ter' s unabashed acknowl
edgment of the great tenor mas
ters of the swingers and earlier.
In each show the trio played one
song where Tabackin took on the
tone, style and mannerisms of
Ben Webster and Coleman
Hawkins. More than mechani
cal reworking old tricks, he was
able to improvise as pleasingly
as Webster and Hawkins would
have done thenmselves. captur
ing the conception and difficult
tone of these masters. The sec
ond show also featured a com
position dedicated to Don Byas
and Slam Stewart. Tabackin
captured Byas's breathy, fluid
style, and Moore gave a fine
arco solo a la Stewart.
Finally, Tabackin has com
pletely eshchewed R & Band
disco rhythms, while Rollins'
recent work has made heavy use
of them. In interviews, he has
made it clear that he wants to
steer a course between mechan
ical disco beats and "free jazz,"
which he finds unmusical. Ac
cordingly, the concert stayed

mostly within the confines of
straight-ahead, mainstream
jazz.
The exceptions to this center
course were the pieces featur
ing the flute. His "Falling
Petals" was a stately composi
tion with more than a hint of
.Japanese flute at times. It
ended with a furious "chaos."
or "slightly organized acciden
tal music" that could have been
by Bartok. In fact, his flute style
shows a strong classical in
fluence: his tone is very clear,
and he generally retained the
purity of the note — a restriction
he never felt compelled to fol
low on the sax
One of the high points of the
evening was the trio's rendition
of "Out of This World" which
was played with a Middle-
Eastern sound (much like
Dollar Brand's work with wood
flute). The drums and bass were
so beautifully hypnotic that
some people began to nod off.
After a relaxed, graceful flute
introduction, John Baron played
an amazing drum solo, ex
tensively using his bare hands to
muffle the drumheads as well as
to hit them for a surprising vari
ty of percussive tones. Even
tually he combined bare hand
and the wire brush for an

authentic African sound that led
gradually to Tabackin's return.
Baron's playing was tasteful
and inventive throughout the
concert (especially in his use of
brushes); he fueled the fire on
the fast numbers without ever
resorting to indiscriminate
pounding. Although he appears
to be young, his drumming
shows the musicianship of years
of experience. I look forward to
hearing more from him.
The bass player, Moore, was
more than acceptable in the en
semble He kept a swinging beat
in the sax selections (through he
was a bit undermixed here), and
behind the flute his fills were
pretty and perfectly timed. His
solos, however, were inconsis
tent. ranging from obscure and
disjointed to relaxed and
melodic. It must be admitted
that his technique was excellent
throughout, and that his short
comings may only be relative to
the excel lent company he keeps.
Those who missed the show
(and most did) have a second
chance, as this group plays at
the Keystone Korner in San
Francisco tonight until Sunday.
Since Tabackin usually tours
with the Big Band, this is a rare
chance to get a full dose of his
unique combination of talents.
