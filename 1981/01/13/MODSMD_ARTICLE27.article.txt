# Way too many Georges

### Stephen Nash 
Who was Edward Carpenter, and why would
anyone write a musical about his life? I'm
tempted to say, "Who cares?" But the musical
that resulted is sq delightful that questions of
motivation seem beside the point. It's not that Ed
ward Carpenter wasn't historically important or
that his writings weren't significant, but just that
when a play works, it seems petty to be obsessed
with "Why?"
For the curious among you (and also to show off
the homework I did to write this review), here are
a few relevant historical facts. Edward Carpenter
was born in 1844 into an upper-middle-class fami
ly. went to Cambridge and read mathematics,
was ordained, lost his faith, and took up market
gardening in rural Derbyshire (long before the
hippy movement became popular). He was also
one of the first English writers of his time to dis
cuss sexuality intelligently and straight
forwardly. Other writers (particularly in Germa
ny ) had begun this demystification project sever
al years earlier, and their work influenced
Carpenter as well as such writers as Havelock El
lis.
Dramatically, all these facts are just wallpaper
on the sets. What makes the play fly is that
Carpenter established a commune in rural Eng
land for himself, his three lovers (all named
George), and their wives. Carpenter was a signifi
cant political spokesman (until he became too in
volved in sexual politics) as well as a relatively
public activist and gay person of the time. Ori
ginally produced by London's Gay Sweatshop
Theatre. The Dear Love of Comrades is currently
being performed at Theatre Rhinoceros in San
Francisco. It is a loose collection of moments in
the lives of Edward and the three Georges, in
terpersed with music-hall-style songs.
As I said above, it is delightful. With one excep
tion (which I will discuss later), it scampers

along, stopping here and there to show us
snapshots of Carpenter & Co. The songs and in
cidental music are appropriately small-scale. The
inevitable confusions and jealousies that go along
with having three lovers concurrently give the
play its momentum and humor and the result
seems "just right." It would probably fall flat on
its face in a theater the size of the Orpheum. but
then Theatre Rhinoceros isn't the size of the Or
pheum.
Like so much else in this production, the actors
blend well with each other, and with the other
components of the play. The only stand-out scene
in the play occurs late in Act 11, when George
Adams (played by Martin Xero) displays his
jealousy for George Merrill (Daniel Osman). Al
though movingly acted, this scene is inconsistent
with the airy style of the rest of the play, and
knocks the second act. an act that is already too
long. This extended emotional scene near the end
of it just does more damage.
Unfortunately, the singing in the play is not as
uniformly good as the acting. Daniel Osman and,
to a lesser extent, Tom Fleming (as Edward
Carpenter) certainly have attractive voices. The
rest of the cast is not as often on-pitch Even so,
some members of the cast (and I am thinking es
pecially of Timo Butters) manage to exploit the
idiosvncracies of their voices to good musical ef
fect. The piano playing (by Liza Kitchell) is very
pretty, especially during interludes. When accom
panying singers, though, the musical texture
seems too cluttered. Leaving out a few arpeggios
might be a good idea.
Why go see The Dear Love of Comrades( You
won't be astounded by Cleo Laine, you won't be
transfixed by Ralph Richardson, and you certain
ly won't get knocked out of your seat by the Rock
ettes. But. if you don't try too hard, you might
have a good time.
