# Slade's Tribute acceptable
## 
### David Schmelzer 
Bernard Slade is rapidly be
coming the new. improved Neil
Simon He writes plays that be
come moderately successful
movies about brilliantly witty
people that live in New York He
actually refers to I'he <hid ('du
ple and The Sunshine Hoys in
Tribute and. heck, his movie
even throws in a meaningless
i not necessarily bad i slow song
by a pop singer as the closing
credits are run. a la David
Gates' "Goodby Girl." But
where Simon has been criticized
for writing verbal souffles.
Slade goes slightly deeper, per
haps into the casserole range
Both present smooth, polished
comedies about serious sub
jects. but Simon often pulls his
punches — copping out with a
funny line whenever he gets
near pain.
Slade is tempted by this im
pulse as well. (When Tribute's
central figure, a dying man. is
asked if he minds talking about
his condition, he replies.
"Mind? Hell. I stop people on
the street.") But. given time,
Slade does go beyond his glossy
exterior to discuss a funny man
who is jolted into the discovery
that his life may have been more
tragic than he'd ever admitted.
But by following Simon's es
tablished pattern. Slade inherits
the same problems that the
former has battled since Come
liloir Your Horn, that of being
wittier than his characters. It
strains credibility at time to ac
cept that each character can
continuously roll off one-liners.
Simon has dealt with this by giv
ing in to it. Increasingly in his
works characters comment on
the other's quick wit. (Most of
Chapter Tiro's first act is
awkward in this fashion.) But,
in Tribute, the audience is sim
ply asked to believe that Scottie
Templeton actually is that
charming and funny, and the
picture succeeds because one
usually can. But then I've
always liked Neil Simon too.
Scottie is shown as a lifelong

funnv man He doesn't converse
so much as he delivers repartee
Although he's never amounted
to much professionally, people
love him for the glow he brings
into their lives His son Judd. on
the other hand, is a dour, hu
morless type who. not surpris
ingly. is on his way to teaching
at Berkeley They've never been
close, but once Scottie finds he's
dying (presumably of leukemia
although the disease is never ac
tually named) he sets out to
change that.
Jack Lemmon. as Scottie (a
role that he originated on Broad
way). was almost assured of an
Academy Award nomination
before the movie was ever
shown, irrespective of his per
formance. because when an ac
tor of his acclaim takes on a role
as dominating as is this, the
ballots are almost precast. Of
course, he delivers an im
pressive interpretation, but
frankly he was better in The
China Syndrome, where he
didn't have the easy and some
times irritating crutch of near
continual banter on which to fall
back.

But when Lemrnon gets seri
ous here, one can see the basis
for those plaudits His reaction
when .ludd tells him he likes
pieces that Scottie had written
years*ago is powerful, touching,
moving, or whatever other com
mon reviewers' cliche comes to
mind His flickering expression
of astonished pleasure is so
heartfelt that his inevitable de
nial of any talent is almqst
missed by the viewer The first
is the image that remains
Robbie Benson has a more un
sympathetic role as Judd. but.
strangely, his lack of infatua
tion with Scottie is necessary at
times when his father's act is
wearing thin and the others on
screen are still laughing away.
He's a needed counterbalance
As an actor, he's rebounded
from l)ic Launhinn. which may
be faint praise in light of his gen
erally good work here. He
doesn't back away from Lem
rnon's formidable presense in
their common scenes, which
shows strength of character
almost as much as talent
Tribute is packaged well by

director Bob f'lark who was as
siMrd bv a talented cinemato
grapher nd ,i quality song
writer in his el fort to establish a
lush, but not overstated, look
and feel to the film Ken Wam
berg's score is often played by a
single, melancholy piano Clark
tries an interesting and effec
tive gimmick with a soundless
look through a glass hospital
door as Scottie is told of his dis
ease. The message comes
through clearly and poignantly
without words.
Critics, particularly Richard
Corliss of Time, have dismissed
the film as being overly dramat
ic and better suited to a play for
mat — arguments that may be
valid, but overlook the point
that Tribute is essentially a
good movie. .Just as poor pic
tures. such as First Family, tend
to be overly praised for their
few strong points to the deem
phasizing of their flaws, so too
do quality films get discussed on
the basis of their weaknesses.
Tribute is funny; it's dramatic;
it's well-acted, and it's well
made. What more does it need 9
