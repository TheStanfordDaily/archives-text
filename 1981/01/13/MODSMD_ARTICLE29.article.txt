# Wacky wacky Duck's breath

### Jay Martel 
After a record-breaking tour of the East Coast,
those stars of stage, screen and second-hand
clothing stores. Duck's Breath Mystery Theater,
have returned to their adopted womb, the Bay
Area. Being back in the saddle has made their
fowl fivesome cockier than ever, and you can bet
the boys are biting the umbilical chord with the
rip-snorting diligence that made them one of Pop
ular Dentistry's TOP 10 plaque-free comedy
groups of all time.
Last week. Duck's Breath persisted in doing
several old sketches — unforgettables such as
"Sonata My P'ault," the Bergman parody —while
ambushing their adoring audience with some new
treats, most of which had something to do with
either dogs or office buildings. A notable last
minute addition was Duck's Breather Jim
Turner's 45-minute soliloquy as a frighteningly
real acid casualty trying to lead a sing-along.
Dead Heads, take note.

The recent shows at the Julia Morgan Theater,
formerly a Presbyterian church, have generally
been superior to past performances, mostly be
cause the boys have wisely dropped their longer
pieces, such as "Gonad the Barbarian.' in favor
of shorter stuff These keep the absurdity clipping
along fast enough to keep the audience off guard
and rolling out of the pews.
Accompanying the troupe in their recent sky
rocket to fame is the release of their first L P.,
Out of Season. which is due to turn double
platinum at three o'clock next Thursday. The re
cord definitely does not meet the stage per
formance in comic consistency, but I'm told that
all of them are round. The album, which costs five
dollars, is sold only at performances, due partly to
the dumbfounding demand demonstrated by re
tail record stores. Duck's Breath, bless their drip
dry hearts, will never sell out (although rumor
has it that five are considering taking the place of
Robin Williams on Mork and Mindx).
