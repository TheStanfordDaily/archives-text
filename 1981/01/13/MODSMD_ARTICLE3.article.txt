# Custodial services to suffer due to lack of funds
## 
### Erin Craig 
Custodial costs at Stanford have
risen to more than $2.2 million this
year, but custodial services are fewer
than last year, resulting in a general
decline in cleanliness around campus
this year.
Of the total custodial costs, $1.75
million goes to basic contracts, ac
cording to Jim Horgan, director of op
erations and maintenance. This mon
ey is given to contractors who, in turn,
provide the custodians around cam
pus.
The additional $500,000 is paid by in
dividual departments who want extra
care for certain areas. Often, for ex
ample. a department may want a cer
tain rug vacuumed more often than
the University is willing to pay for.
"Each department has its own spe
cialities." said Horgan. He cited the
Hoover Institution and the Graduate
School of Business as two of the many
departments with individual custodial
contracts.
The basic contracts cover every
thing from dusting and vacuuming to
the upkeep of bathrooms. There are 26
different services in all.

The custodial services were cut
back last fall because of an 8 percent
budget deficit, according to Horgan.
"We estimated an 18 percent increase
in contractor costs over last year —
the actual increase was 21 percent,"
Horgan said. The University awarded
only a 13 percent increase in funds,
causing the deficit.
Operations and maintenance did not
receive the 21 percent increase be
cause "we (the University) are not
like the government — we can't run on
a deficit budget," Horgan said.
"Something has to give." And in this
case, custodial services suffered the
blow.
This rise in cost is not abnormal,
says Horgan. Last May, the custodial
union contracts were revised, raising
the salaries of all the workers, and
therefore raising the cost to the Uni
versity.
Horgan emphasized that the custo
dians are not overpaid. "They makess
or $6 per hour," he said, adding "they
don't get large cost raises."
'Do less, less often'
Because of the deficit, the Univer
sity is not paying the contractors as

much as they were last year, relative
to cost rises. Therefore, the custo
dians "do less, less often," Horgan
said. Nearly all services are affected.
Only bathrooms were not affected
by the cutbacks.' 'Our intent is to keep
bathrooms up," Horgan said. "On our
26-item list, bathrooms are number
one. We spend 47 percent of our budget
keeping the bathrooms clean."
The most visible effects of the cut
back are the overflowing trash bins
around campus, such as outside Green
Library and the Post Office. Horgan
said, "The Post Office is always a
mess because of the constant flow of
newspapers and hand outs."
Horgan estimated that $50,000-
$75,000 per year goes to cleaning up lit
ter that could have been placed in
trash cans, but was not. The blame for
such litter lies on all members of the
Stanford community, asserted
Horgan. For example. "People leave
an incredible mess after football
games." But he also remarked that
"No one's been advised not to litter.
We have no money for an anti-litter
campaign."

Stanford does, however, have a re
cycling campaign, which urges com
munity members to recycle paper,
-glass and aluminum goods. Patrick
McFadden of the ASSU Recycling
Center estimated that the center re
cycles 7 percent of all of Stanford's
trash, which is 14 percent of Stan
ford's recyclable trash.
The outlook for the future depends
on how much money is allotted for
custodial contracts in the coming
years. "We have to compete with all
the other departments for our funds,".
Horgan said, "and if I don't get more
funds, the problem will get worse. But
we are adjusting to our situation "
