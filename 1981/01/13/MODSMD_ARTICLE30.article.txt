# Report details rationale for hike in tuition, room, and board
## 
### 
Following is a background paper prepared for the
Board of Trustees on establishment of tuition and room
and&oard rates for 1981 82:
An increase in general tuition and room and board rates
for 1981-82 aggregating 13 3% is recommended The
general tuition recommendation is an increase of 13 6%
room and board is 12.5%
We do not know—and do not inquire into —what other
institutions are planning regarding charges for 1981-82
Comparison for 1980-81 of the combined rates yields the
following table
Tuition, Fees, Percent Increase
School Room & Board Over 1979-80
Harvard $ 9,170 12 7
Vale 9,110 119
MIT 9,000 12 7
Stanford 8,921 122
Dartmouth 8,875 13 1
Brown 8,865 13 1
Princeton 8,805 12.2
Amherst 8,545 18 0
Cornell 8,410 113
Williams 8,346 19 1
Northwestern 8,315 10.6
Since these institutions provide our principal independent
sector competition, are subject to similar economic forces,
and have comparable quality objectives, we do not expect
that the relatively close clustering of the aggregate costs will
be much changed when the charges have been set by all for
next year
A. Establishment of the Tuition Rates for 1981-82
That the Committee on Finance and Administration and
the Committee on Academic Affairs and Development
recommend the general tuition rate for the academic year
1981-82 be set at $7,140 ($2,380 per regular quarter)
Further, these Committees recommend approval to set
tuition rates for M.D students at $8,340 ($2,780 per regular
quarter), and for the School of Law at $7,290 ($3,645 per
regular semester) for the academic year 1981 82
Background
A comparison of the 1981-82 tuition recommendations is
below
Stanford's present general tuition compares to the group
of institutions noted above as follows
1980-81 Percent Increase
School Tuition& Fees Over 1979-80
Harvard $6,490 13.0
Amherst 6,345 21.1
Princeton 6,300 12 8
'Brown 6,290 12.7
Stanford 6,285 12.3
Yale 6,210 11.9
Dartmouth 6,210 13.1
MIT 6,200 17 0
Williams 6,016 20.1
Northwestern 5,985 10.5
Cornell 5,910 114
The average percentage increase of these 10 com
parison schools for 1980-81 was 14 4% or over 2 per
centage points greater than Stanford's. Leaving Amherst
and Williams out of the calculation, the average increase for
the remaining eight is 12 8, or 0.5% greater than Stanford s
The point of this comparison is simply to show that Stan
ford's tuition increases tend to be within the cluster of
comparable institutions both as to absolute dollars and rates
of change

Tuition Recommendations
From To Dollar Percent
Type 1980-81 1981-82 Increase Increase
General tuition $6,285 $7,140 $ 855 13 60
School of Medicine 7,338 8,340 1,002 13 65
(M D Students)
School of Law 6,434 7,290 856 13 30

In arriving at the proposed increase for 1981 82. several
factors have been taken into consideration, none more
seriousiy than the relation of tuition to quality The relation to
quality is twofold the quality of the institution and the
educational program, and access to Stanford by students of
the highest calibre These two concerns are uneasy pari
ners
The relationship to institutional quality is at oottom, the
fact that tuition income provides about hail oi the income on
which the Operating Budget depends Whatever we must do
to maintain and enhance quality—sucf ; ?s maintain com
petition salary levels, respond to new and promising ideas,
keep the physical plant in good repair and provide proper
support services—is costly Its costliness is in proportion to
external forces—labor market increases, construction
costs, regulatory initiatives —as well as internal decisions
new initiatives and policy decisions on support service
levels. Thus, with simple but inexorable logic, our prices
must respond to our costs.
As we shall discuss in the Long Range Forecast
presentation, the effort to keep costs under control occupies
us now with no less vigor than in the previous decade when
$10 million was cut from the Operating Budget base Even
with those efforts, a tuition increase of the size proposed is a
vital factor in maintaining Stanford's quality its ability to
respond to the best of new ideas, and its capacity to deal
effectively with the operational requirements of a large,
physically and organizationally complex, and dynamic in
stitution. >
Regarding student access to Stanford, we looked at two
aspects of that issue, affordability and the characteristics of
the freshman class
First, affordability The major factor assisting students
and their families in meeting college costs is linancial aid At
the undergraduate level, where over 50% of our students
qualify for and receive some form of financial aid. ap
proximately $13 million are,dispersed as grant aid, with self
help (subsidized loans and term-time jobs) comprising the
difference beyond what the family contribution provides
University General Funds, endowment, and expendable gifts
provide a substantial share of the grant aid California State
Scholarships total over $2 million Other grants, as well as
loan and work/study funds, are allocated through Federal
programs
The Education Amendments of 1980. signed by President
Carter on October 3, 1980. provide for greater federal grant
aid, college work/study funds, loans to students, and loans to
parents. The loan terms are extremely favorable (7% to
students who have already borrowed. 9% to new borrowers,
with in-school interest forgiven for both, and loans to parents
are at 9%) For parents needing loans beyond federal loan
limits ($3,000/ year), the University's Parent Loan Plan is
available
While we are complacent about neither the State nor
Federal programs, as government at both levels begins to
wrestle with profound economic problems, neither do we
foresee major reversals in the structure of these programs
What we do foresee are hard-fought annual battles within the
appropriations process in concert with our colleague in
stitutions
At the graduate level, financial aid is substantial Need is
a less comprehensively applied criterion at this level due to
the age of the students, the relationship of much aid to
particular educational responsibilities (as with teaching and
research assistants), and the keying of certain awards to
ability Loan funds (some on terms as noted above) are
available A substantial boost in graduate support was
provided this year in the form of College Work/Study funds
becoming newly available for graduate purposes This meant
that many heretofore un- or undersupported students

could—if Ihey met eligibility requirements—receive this
form of aid toi work connected with their programs
The availability of aid on both a demonstrated need basis
and a felt need basis (ie . through low-interest loans) as well
as program-related assistantships for graduate students
does, we believe, continue to keep Stanford affordable to
those who qualify for admission
On the question of student calibre we look with particular
intensity at each year s freshman class, especially in regard
to those who apply for financial aid This year s review
reveals very little change from last year on the relevant
dimensions Applications were up 7% over the prior year
The academic ratings of the applicant pool, of those ad
mitted. and of those who enrolled were marginally stronger
than last year's The yield ratio (percent of those admitted
who enroll) was 64 5% (Because the yield ratio has been so
high in recent years, the number of admissions was
diminished by 39 in order to come closer to the target size of
1,500 for the freshman class) Of the 35 5% enrolling
elsewhere. 17% chose public institutions and 83% private
This ratio has changed very little over the past nine years

Among those electing private alternatives, over one-third
chose Harvard-Radcliffe. Yale, or Princeton, this too is
similar to past findings
Enrollment of black and chicano students was slightly
below last year's figures, which were the highest ever for
both groups
The report issued after this year's review by the Offices
of Admissions and Financial Aids concludes with this
paragraph
The research this year again points to the continued
strength of the applicant pool and the enrolling freshman
class Most measures have remained fairly stable over time,
and where changes have occurred, they seem to have been
within familiar ranges, indicators of at least a mildly positive
trend, or a function of the diminished number of students
admitted These results are reassuring, particularly with
respect to the high cost/financial aids (concerns)
We conclude from this that the uneasy partnership noted
above continues to work high tuition is one price of high
quality, and financial aid keeps that quality accessible to
those able to benefit from it, whatever their economic cir
cumstances
Besides the issues of institutional quality and student
access, we reviewed general economic considerations The
consensus of those economists and other knowledgeable
sources whom we consulted was that inflation would decline
to the 10-11 % range from the 13-15% range it has occupied
over the past year or so Results of the Presidential election
were not anticipated to have more than a marginal effect on
inflation in the near future The Federal Reserve is unlikely to
prevail in slowing economic growth through money supply
constraints, political pressures for reduced unemployment
will likely dissuade the Federal government from a slow
growth policy and thus reinforce higher long-term inflation
rates As the nation recovers from the current recession,
real economic growth should be strong between 1982 and
1984 .
The effect of this complex of economic forces on the
family income and family financial capacity of current and
potential Stanford parents is difficult to discern Family
incomes nationwide appear to be keeping up with or slightly
bettering the rate of inflation Yet the income tax structure
' invades the rate of disposable income increase m middle
and upper income families severely
The tuition increase recommendation proposed will no
idoubt for many parents make the cosh of a Stanford
education relatively more expensive, however, the fact that
the 1980-81 increase lagged inflation provides an offset to
that relative increase

To conclude this background note we mane two com
ments on the recommendations tor medicine IMDI and law
Last year the M D tuition was increased 20" " to bring it into
line with the historical proportion that tuition was of
operating costs (22%) when the ratio was established in
1972-73 At that time it was planned that future increases
would be at the same rate as the general tuition which is the
basis lor the $8,340 figure Then-current students would be
"held harmless'' for the extraordinary portion of the 1980-81
increase The standard increase then and now is expected
to be borne by the students from their own funds or from
additional financial aid in cases of hardship
The tuition for the School of Law tracks the University's
general rate and maintains the $150 differential which was
established during the Budget Equilibrium Program effective
1976-77
Establishment of room and board rates for 1981-82.
The Committee on Finance and Administration and the
Committee on Academic Affairs and Development
recommend that the basic room and board rate for 'un
dergraduate students for the academic year 1981-82 be set
at $2,965. an increase of 12 5% that the room rate be set at
$1,291. an increase of 15 0%. and the full board rate be set
at $1 674. an increase of 10 6%. and that rates for specific
undergraduate residence units and for partial boatd plans be
set within the pattern of these rates
Further that the vice-president for business and finance
be and is hereby authorized to approve specific rates for
undergraduate and graduate student residences and food
services, and for Escondido Village apartments
Background:
In December. 1979. the Board approved a 1980 81 basic
room and board rate of $2,636 The basic room rate was set
at $1 123 (full service residence with University operated
kitchen) and the basic board rate at $1,513 (19 meals per
week) Room rates for the current year vary from $1,071 in
self-operated houses and fraternity clusters to $1 254 in full
service residences with self-operated kitchens
For 1981 82. a basic rate of $2,965 is proposed, an in
crease of 12 5% While the basic residence hall rate will be
set at $1,291 and the basic full board rate will be set at
$1,674 rates for specific residences and for partial board
plans will be set after further analysis by the staff
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $261 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $340 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment All apartments are furnished and
utilities are provided
Apartment rents for 1981 82 will be increased not less
than 15% Specific rents will be set after further analysis by
the staff, the analysis will consider the off-campus rental
market and the level of financial aid for graduate students
Off-campus rents for comparable units generally exceed
campus rents by 40-70%, and they have been increasing at
a far greater rate than have on-campus rents
The overall 12 5% increase in the basic room-and board
rate affects 5,050 undergraduates in various types of
housing In addition. 350 single graduate students in
Crothers residence halls. 500 single graduate students in
apartments, and 1,100 families in apartments will be af
fected by rates to be set following staff analysis
Operating expenses are expected to increase ap
proximately 11 % for 1981 82 The latest estimate of 1980-81
operations shows a loss of $315,000 on gross revenues of
$19,067,000 The proposed rate increases for 1981 82 will
generate net income of $212,000 (Present proiections in
dicate a net loss of $398 000 in 1982 83. $882,000 in 1983-
84 $263,000 in 1984-85. and $308,000 in 1985 86 mainly as
a result of new student housing construction- Ed )
The four most significant influences on room and board
rates across the next five years will be the debt service on
new housing for 800 students, a high level of major repair
and replacement activity, utility costs, and the absorption of
University overhead costs by Federal cost
allocation requirements (A-21)
Room and board rates must increase in the years before
housing is constructed, not only to match inflation, but to
build up reserves When the housing is occupied in 1982 and
1983. operating losses will be large initially due to the
payment of new debt service Reserves will be drawn down
for several years to smooth the pattern of rate increases
from 1983 to 1986
Operating and rnaior repair reserves are forecast to total
$2,050,000 at the end ol 1981 -82, 9 5% of operating costs

84 $263,000 in 1984-85. and $308,000 in 1985 86 mainly as
a result of new student housing construction- Ed )
The four most significant influences on room and board
rates across the next five years will be the debt service on
new housing for 800 students, a high level of major repair
and replacement activity, utility costs, and the absorption of
University overhead costs by Federal cost
allocation requirements (A-21)
Room and board rates must increase in the years before
housing is constructed, not only to match inflation, but to
build up reserves When the housing is occupied in 1982 and
1983. operating losses will be large initially due to the
payment of new debt service Reserves will be drawn down
for several years to smooth the pattern of rate increases
from 1983 to 1986
Operating and rnaior repair reserves are forecast to total
$2,050,000 at the end ol 1981 -82, 9 5% of operating costs

Following is a background paper prepared for the
Board of Trustees on establishment of tuition and room
and&oard rates for 1981 82:
An increase in general tuition and room and board rates
for 1981-82 aggregating 13 3% is recommended The
general tuition recommendation is an increase of 13 6%
room and board is 12.5%
We do not know—and do not inquire into —what other
institutions are planning regarding charges for 1981-82
Comparison for 1980-81 of the combined rates yields the
following table
Tuition, Fees, Percent Increase
School Room & Board Over 1979-80
Harvard $ 9,170 12 7
Vale 9,110 119
MIT 9,000 12 7

Amherst 8,545 18 0
Cornell 8,410 113
Williams 8,346 19 1
Northwestern 8,315 10.6
Since these institutions provide our principal independent
sector competition, are subject to similar economic forces,
and have comparable quality objectives, we do not expect
that the relatively close clustering of the aggregate costs will
be much changed when the charges have been set by all for
next year
A. Establishment of the Tuition Rates for 1981-82
That the Committee on Finance and Administration and
the Committee on Academic Affairs and Development
recommend the general tuition rate for the academic year
1981-82 be set at $7,140 ($2,380 per regular quarter)
Further, these Committees recommend approval to set
tuition rates for M.D students at $8,340 ($2,780 per regular
quarter), and for the School of Law at $7,290 ($3,645 per
regular semester) for the academic year 1981 82
Background
A comparison of the 1981-82 tuition recommendations is
below
Stanford's present general tuition compares to the group
of institutions noted above as follows
1980-81 Percent Increase
School Tuition& Fees Over 1979-80
Harvard $6,490 13.0
Amherst 6,345 21.1
Princeton 6,300 12 8

Stanford 6,285 12.3

MIT 6,200 17 0
Williams 6,016 20.1
Northwestern 5,985 10.5
Cornell 5,910 114
The average percentage increase of these 10 com
parison schools for 1980-81 was 14 4% or over 2 per
centage points greater than Stanford's. Leaving Amherst
and Williams out of the calculation, the average increase for
the remaining eight is 12 8, or 0.5% greater than Stanford s
The point of this comparison is simply to show that Stan
ford's tuition increases tend to be within the cluster of
comparable institutions both as to absolute dollars and rates
of change

In arriving at the proposed increase for 1981 82. several
factors have been taken into consideration, none more
seriousiy than the relation of tuition to quality The relation to
quality is twofold the quality of the institution and the
educational program, and access to Stanford by students of
the highest calibre These two concerns are uneasy pari
ners
The relationship to institutional quality is at oottom, the
fact that tuition income provides about hail oi the income on
which the Operating Budget depends Whatever we must do
to maintain and enhance quality—sucf ; ?s maintain com
petition salary levels, respond to new and promising ideas,
keep the physical plant in good repair and provide proper
support services—is costly Its costliness is in proportion to
external forces—labor market increases, construction
costs, regulatory initiatives —as well as internal decisions
new initiatives and policy decisions on support service
levels. Thus, with simple but inexorable logic, our prices
must respond to our costs.
As we shall discuss in the Long Range Forecast
presentation, the effort to keep costs under control occupies
us now with no less vigor than in the previous decade when
$10 million was cut from the Operating Budget base Even
with those efforts, a tuition increase of the size proposed is a
vital factor in maintaining Stanford's quality its ability to
respond to the best of new ideas, and its capacity to deal
effectively with the operational requirements of a large,
physically and organizationally complex, and dynamic in
stitution. >
Regarding student access to Stanford, we looked at two
aspects of that issue, affordability and the characteristics of
the freshman class
First, affordability The major factor assisting students
and their families in meeting college costs is linancial aid At
the undergraduate level, where over 50% of our students
qualify for and receive some form of financial aid. ap
proximately $13 million are,dispersed as grant aid, with self
help (subsidized loans and term-time jobs) comprising the
difference beyond what the family contribution provides
University General Funds, endowment, and expendable gifts
provide a substantial share of the grant aid California State
Scholarships total over $2 million Other grants, as well as
loan and work/study funds, are allocated through Federal
programs
The Education Amendments of 1980. signed by President
Carter on October 3, 1980. provide for greater federal grant
aid, college work/study funds, loans to students, and loans to
parents. The loan terms are extremely favorable (7% to
students who have already borrowed. 9% to new borrowers,
with in-school interest forgiven for both, and loans to parents
are at 9%) For parents needing loans beyond federal loan
limits ($3,000/ year), the University's Parent Loan Plan is
available
While we are complacent about neither the State nor
Federal programs, as government at both levels begins to
wrestle with profound economic problems, neither do we
foresee major reversals in the structure of these programs
What we do foresee are hard-fought annual battles within the
appropriations process in concert with our colleague in
stitutions
At the graduate level, financial aid is substantial Need is
a less comprehensively applied criterion at this level due to
the age of the students, the relationship of much aid to
particular educational responsibilities (as with teaching and
research assistants), and the keying of certain awards to
ability Loan funds (some on terms as noted above) are
available A substantial boost in graduate support was
provided this year in the form of College Work/Study funds
becoming newly available for graduate purposes This meant
that many heretofore un- or undersupported students

could—if Ihey met eligibility requirements—receive this
form of aid toi work connected with their programs
The availability of aid on both a demonstrated need basis
and a felt need basis (ie . through low-interest loans) as well
as program-related assistantships for graduate students
does, we believe, continue to keep Stanford affordable to
those who qualify for admission
On the question of student calibre we look with particular
intensity at each year s freshman class, especially in regard
to those who apply for financial aid This year s review
reveals very little change from last year on the relevant
dimensions Applications were up 7% over the prior year
The academic ratings of the applicant pool, of those ad
mitted. and of those who enrolled were marginally stronger
than last year's The yield ratio (percent of those admitted
who enroll) was 64 5% (Because the yield ratio has been so
high in recent years, the number of admissions was
diminished by 39 in order to come closer to the target size of
1,500 for the freshman class) Of the 35 5% enrolling
elsewhere. 17% chose public institutions and 83% private
This ratio has changed very little over the past nine years

Among those electing private alternatives, over one-third
chose Harvard-Radcliffe. Yale, or Princeton, this too is
similar to past findings
Enrollment of black and chicano students was slightly
below last year's figures, which were the highest ever for
both groups
The report issued after this year's review by the Offices
of Admissions and Financial Aids concludes with this
paragraph
The research this year again points to the continued
strength of the applicant pool and the enrolling freshman
class Most measures have remained fairly stable over time,
and where changes have occurred, they seem to have been
within familiar ranges, indicators of at least a mildly positive
trend, or a function of the diminished number of students
admitted These results are reassuring, particularly with
respect to the high cost/financial aids (concerns)
We conclude from this that the uneasy partnership noted
above continues to work high tuition is one price of high
quality, and financial aid keeps that quality accessible to
those able to benefit from it, whatever their economic cir
cumstances
Besides the issues of institutional quality and student
access, we reviewed general economic considerations The
consensus of those economists and other knowledgeable
sources whom we consulted was that inflation would decline
to the 10-11 % range from the 13-15% range it has occupied
over the past year or so Results of the Presidential election
were not anticipated to have more than a marginal effect on
inflation in the near future The Federal Reserve is unlikely to
prevail in slowing economic growth through money supply
constraints, political pressures for reduced unemployment
will likely dissuade the Federal government from a slow
growth policy and thus reinforce higher long-term inflation
rates As the nation recovers from the current recession,
real economic growth should be strong between 1982 and
1984 .
The effect of this complex of economic forces on the
family income and family financial capacity of current and
potential Stanford parents is difficult to discern Family
incomes nationwide appear to be keeping up with or slightly
bettering the rate of inflation Yet the income tax structure
' invades the rate of disposable income increase m middle
and upper income families severely
The tuition increase recommendation proposed will no
idoubt for many parents make the cosh of a Stanford
education relatively more expensive, however, the fact that
the 1980-81 increase lagged inflation provides an offset to
that relative increase

To conclude this background note we mane two com
ments on the recommendations tor medicine IMDI and law
Last year the M D tuition was increased 20" " to bring it into
line with the historical proportion that tuition was of
operating costs (22%) when the ratio was established in
1972-73 At that time it was planned that future increases
would be at the same rate as the general tuition which is the
basis lor the $8,340 figure Then-current students would be
"held harmless'' for the extraordinary portion of the 1980-81
increase The standard increase then and now is expected
to be borne by the students from their own funds or from
additional financial aid in cases of hardship
The tuition for the School of Law tracks the University's
general rate and maintains the $150 differential which was
established during the Budget Equilibrium Program effective
1976-77
Establishment of room and board rates for 1981-82.
The Committee on Finance and Administration and the
Committee on Academic Affairs and Development
recommend that the basic room and board rate for 'un
dergraduate students for the academic year 1981-82 be set
at $2,965. an increase of 12 5% that the room rate be set at
$1,291. an increase of 15 0%. and the full board rate be set
at $1 674. an increase of 10 6%. and that rates for specific
undergraduate residence units and for partial boatd plans be
set within the pattern of these rates
Further that the vice-president for business and finance
be and is hereby authorized to approve specific rates for
undergraduate and graduate student residences and food
services, and for Escondido Village apartments
Background:
In December. 1979. the Board approved a 1980 81 basic
room and board rate of $2,636 The basic room rate was set
at $1 123 (full service residence with University operated
kitchen) and the basic board rate at $1,513 (19 meals per
week) Room rates for the current year vary from $1,071 in
self-operated houses and fraternity clusters to $1 254 in full
service residences with self-operated kitchens
For 1981 82. a basic rate of $2,965 is proposed, an in
crease of 12 5% While the basic residence hall rate will be
set at $1,291 and the basic full board rate will be set at
$1,674 rates for specific residences and for partial board
plans will be set after further analysis by the staff
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $261 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $340 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment All apartments are furnished and
utilities are provided
Apartment rents for 1981 82 will be increased not less
than 15% Specific rents will be set after further analysis by
the staff, the analysis will consider the off-campus rental
market and the level of financial aid for graduate students
Off-campus rents for comparable units generally exceed
campus rents by 40-70%, and they have been increasing at
a far greater rate than have on-campus rents
The overall 12 5% increase in the basic room-and board
rate affects 5,050 undergraduates in various types of
housing In addition. 350 single graduate students in
Crothers residence halls. 500 single graduate students in
apartments, and 1,100 families in apartments will be af
fected by rates to be set following staff analysis
Operating expenses are expected to increase ap
proximately 11 % for 1981 82 The latest estimate of 1980-81
operations shows a loss of $315,000 on gross revenues of
$19,067,000 The proposed rate increases for 1981 82 will
generate net income of $212,000 (Present proiections in
dicate a net loss of $398 000 in 1982 83. $882,000 in 1983-
84 $263,000 in 1984-85. and $308,000 in 1985 86 mainly as

the staff, the analysis will consider the off-campus rental
market and the level of financial aid for graduate students
Off-campus rents for comparable units generally exceed
campus rents by 40-70%, and they have been increasing at
a far greater rate than have on-campus rents
The overall 12 5% increase in the basic room-and board
rate affects 5,050 undergraduates in various types of
housing In addition. 350 single graduate students in
Crothers residence halls. 500 single graduate students in
apartments, and 1,100 families in apartments will be af
fected by rates to be set following staff analysis
Operating expenses are expected to increase ap
proximately 11 % for 1981 82 The latest estimate of 1980-81
operations shows a loss of $315,000 on gross revenues of
$19,067,000 The proposed rate increases for 1981 82 will
generate net income of $212,000 (Present proiections in
dicate a net loss of $398 000 in 1982 83. $882,000 in 1983-
84 $263,000 in 1984-85. and $308,000 in 1985 86 mainly as
a result of new student housing construction- Ed )
The four most significant influences on room and board
rates across the next five years will be the debt service on
new housing for 800 students, a high level of major repair
and replacement activity, utility costs, and the absorption of
University overhead costs by Federal cost
allocation requirements (A-21)
Room and board rates must increase in the years before
housing is constructed, not only to match inflation, but to
build up reserves When the housing is occupied in 1982 and
1983. operating losses will be large initially due to the
payment of new debt service Reserves will be drawn down
for several years to smooth the pattern of rate increases
from 1983 to 1986
Operating and rnaior repair reserves are forecast to total
$2,050,000 at the end ol 1981 -82, 9 5% of operating costs

Following is a background paper prepared for the
Board of Trustees on establishment of tuition and room
and&oard rates for 1981 82:
An increase in general tuition and room and board rates
for 1981-82 aggregating 13 3% is recommended The
general tuition recommendation is an increase of 13 6%
room and board is 12.5%
We do not know—and do not inquire into —what other
institutions are planning regarding charges for 1981-82
Comparison for 1980-81 of the combined rates yields the
following table
Tuition, Fees, Percent Increase
School Room & Board Over 1979-80
Harvard $ 9,170 12 7
Vale 9,110 119
MIT 9,000 12 7

Amherst 8,545 18 0
Cornell 8,410 113
Williams 8,346 19 1
Northwestern 8,315 10.6
Since these institutions provide our principal independent
sector competition, are subject to similar economic forces,
and have comparable quality objectives, we do not expect
that the relatively close clustering of the aggregate costs will
be much changed when the charges have been set by all for
next year
A. Establishment of the Tuition Rates for 1981-82
That the Committee on Finance and Administration and
the Committee on Academic Affairs and Development
recommend the general tuition rate for the academic year
1981-82 be set at $7,140 ($2,380 per regular quarter)
Further, these Committees recommend approval to set
tuition rates for M.D students at $8,340 ($2,780 per regular
quarter), and for the School of Law at $7,290 ($3,645 per
regular semester) for the academic year 1981 82
Background
A comparison of the 1981-82 tuition recommendations is
below
Stanford's present general tuition compares to the group
of institutions noted above as follows
1980-81 Percent Increase
School Tuition& Fees Over 1979-80
Harvard $6,490 13.0
Amherst 6,345 21.1
Princeton 6,300 12 8

Stanford 6,285 12.3
Yale 6,210 11.9
Dartmouth 6,210 13.1
MIT 6,200 17 0
Williams 6,016 20.1
Northwestern 5,985 10.5
Cornell 5,910 114
The average percentage increase of these 10 com
parison schools for 1980-81 was 14 4% or over 2 per
centage points greater than Stanford's. Leaving Amherst
and Williams out of the calculation, the average increase for
the remaining eight is 12 8, or 0.5% greater than Stanford s
The point of this comparison is simply to show that Stan
ford's tuition increases tend to be within the cluster of
comparable institutions both as to absolute dollars and rates
of change

Tuition Recommendations

In arriving at the proposed increase for 1981 82. several
factors have been taken into consideration, none more
seriousiy than the relation of tuition to quality The relation to
quality is twofold the quality of the institution and the
educational program, and access to Stanford by students of
the highest calibre These two concerns are uneasy pari
ners
The relationship to institutional quality is at oottom, the
fact that tuition income provides about hail oi the income on
which the Operating Budget depends Whatever we must do
to maintain and enhance quality—sucf ; ?s maintain com
petition salary levels, respond to new and promising ideas,
keep the physical plant in good repair and provide proper
support services—is costly Its costliness is in proportion to
external forces—labor market increases, construction
costs, regulatory initiatives —as well as internal decisions
new initiatives and policy decisions on support service
levels. Thus, with simple but inexorable logic, our prices
must respond to our costs.
As we shall discuss in the Long Range Forecast
presentation, the effort to keep costs under control occupies
us now with no less vigor than in the previous decade when
$10 million was cut from the Operating Budget base Even
with those efforts, a tuition increase of the size proposed is a
vital factor in maintaining Stanford's quality its ability to
respond to the best of new ideas, and its capacity to deal
effectively with the operational requirements of a large,
physically and organizationally complex, and dynamic in
stitution. >
Regarding student access to Stanford, we looked at two
aspects of that issue, affordability and the characteristics of
the freshman class
First, affordability The major factor assisting students
and their families in meeting college costs is linancial aid At
the undergraduate level, where over 50% of our students
qualify for and receive some form of financial aid. ap
proximately $13 million are,dispersed as grant aid, with self
help (subsidized loans and term-time jobs) comprising the
difference beyond what the family contribution provides
University General Funds, endowment, and expendable gifts
provide a substantial share of the grant aid California State
Scholarships total over $2 million Other grants, as well as
loan and work/study funds, are allocated through Federal
programs
The Education Amendments of 1980. signed by President
Carter on October 3, 1980. provide for greater federal grant
aid, college work/study funds, loans to students, and loans to
parents. The loan terms are extremely favorable (7% to
students who have already borrowed. 9% to new borrowers,
with in-school interest forgiven for both, and loans to parents
are at 9%) For parents needing loans beyond federal loan
limits ($3,000/ year), the University's Parent Loan Plan is
available
While we are complacent about neither the State nor
Federal programs, as government at both levels begins to
wrestle with profound economic problems, neither do we
foresee major reversals in the structure of these programs
What we do foresee are hard-fought annual battles within the
appropriations process in concert with our colleague in
stitutions
At the graduate level, financial aid is substantial Need is
a less comprehensively applied criterion at this level due to
the age of the students, the relationship of much aid to
particular educational responsibilities (as with teaching and
research assistants), and the keying of certain awards to
ability Loan funds (some on terms as noted above) are
available A substantial boost in graduate support was
provided this year in the form of College Work/Study funds
becoming newly available for graduate purposes This meant
that many heretofore un- or undersupported students

could—if Ihey met eligibility requirements—receive this
form of aid toi work connected with their programs
The availability of aid on both a demonstrated need basis
and a felt need basis (ie . through low-interest loans) as well
as program-related assistantships for graduate students
does, we believe, continue to keep Stanford affordable to
those who qualify for admission
On the question of student calibre we look with particular
intensity at each year s freshman class, especially in regard
to those who apply for financial aid This year s review
reveals very little change from last year on the relevant
dimensions Applications were up 7% over the prior year
The academic ratings of the applicant pool, of those ad
mitted. and of those who enrolled were marginally stronger
than last year's The yield ratio (percent of those admitted
who enroll) was 64 5% (Because the yield ratio has been so
high in recent years, the number of admissions was
diminished by 39 in order to come closer to the target size of
1,500 for the freshman class) Of the 35 5% enrolling
elsewhere. 17% chose public institutions and 83% private
This ratio has changed very little over the past nine years

Among those electing private alternatives, over one-third
chose Harvard-Radcliffe. Yale, or Princeton, this too is
similar to past findings
Enrollment of black and chicano students was slightly
below last year's figures, which were the highest ever for
both groups
The report issued after this year's review by the Offices
of Admissions and Financial Aids concludes with this
paragraph
The research this year again points to the continued
strength of the applicant pool and the enrolling freshman
class Most measures have remained fairly stable over time,
and where changes have occurred, they seem to have been
within familiar ranges, indicators of at least a mildly positive
trend, or a function of the diminished number of students
admitted These results are reassuring, particularly with
respect to the high cost/financial aids (concerns)
We conclude from this that the uneasy partnership noted
above continues to work high tuition is one price of high
quality, and financial aid keeps that quality accessible to
those able to benefit from it, whatever their economic cir
cumstances
Besides the issues of institutional quality and student
access, we reviewed general economic considerations The
consensus of those economists and other knowledgeable
sources whom we consulted was that inflation would decline
to the 10-11 % range from the 13-15% range it has occupied
over the past year or so Results of the Presidential election
were not anticipated to have more than a marginal effect on
inflation in the near future The Federal Reserve is unlikely to
prevail in slowing economic growth through money supply
constraints, political pressures for reduced unemployment
will likely dissuade the Federal government from a slow
growth policy and thus reinforce higher long-term inflation
rates As the nation recovers from the current recession,
real economic growth should be strong between 1982 and
1984 .
The effect of this complex of economic forces on the
family income and family financial capacity of current and
potential Stanford parents is difficult to discern Family
incomes nationwide appear to be keeping up with or slightly
bettering the rate of inflation Yet the income tax structure
' invades the rate of disposable income increase m middle
and upper income families severely
The tuition increase recommendation proposed will no
idoubt for many parents make the cosh of a Stanford
education relatively more expensive, however, the fact that
the 1980-81 increase lagged inflation provides an offset to
that relative increase

To conclude this background note we mane two com
ments on the recommendations tor medicine IMDI and law
Last year the M D tuition was increased 20" " to bring it into
line with the historical proportion that tuition was of
operating costs (22%) when the ratio was established in
1972-73 At that time it was planned that future increases
would be at the same rate as the general tuition which is the
basis lor the $8,340 figure Then-current students would be
"held harmless'' for the extraordinary portion of the 1980-81
increase The standard increase then and now is expected
to be borne by the students from their own funds or from
additional financial aid in cases of hardship
The tuition for the School of Law tracks the University's
general rate and maintains the $150 differential which was
established during the Budget Equilibrium Program effective
1976-77
Establishment of room and board rates for 1981-82.
The Committee on Finance and Administration and the
Committee on Academic Affairs and Development
recommend that the basic room and board rate for 'un
dergraduate students for the academic year 1981-82 be set
at $2,965. an increase of 12 5% that the room rate be set at
$1,291. an increase of 15 0%. and the full board rate be set
at $1 674. an increase of 10 6%. and that rates for specific
undergraduate residence units and for partial boatd plans be
set within the pattern of these rates
Further that the vice-president for business and finance
be and is hereby authorized to approve specific rates for
undergraduate and graduate student residences and food
services, and for Escondido Village apartments
Background:
In December. 1979. the Board approved a 1980 81 basic
room and board rate of $2,636 The basic room rate was set
at $1 123 (full service residence with University operated
kitchen) and the basic board rate at $1,513 (19 meals per
week) Room rates for the current year vary from $1,071 in
self-operated houses and fraternity clusters to $1 254 in full
service residences with self-operated kitchens
For 1981 82. a basic rate of $2,965 is proposed, an in
crease of 12 5% While the basic residence hall rate will be
set at $1,291 and the basic full board rate will be set at
$1,674 rates for specific residences and for partial board
plans will be set after further analysis by the staff
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $261 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $340 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment All apartments are furnished and
utilities are provided
Apartment rents for 1981 82 will be increased not less
than 15% Specific rents will be set after further analysis by
the staff, the analysis will consider the off-campus rental
market and the level of financial aid for graduate students
Off-campus rents for comparable units generally exceed

room and board rate of $2,636 The basic room rate was set
at $1 123 (full service residence with University operated
kitchen) and the basic board rate at $1,513 (19 meals per
week) Room rates for the current year vary from $1,071 in
self-operated houses and fraternity clusters to $1 254 in full
service residences with self-operated kitchens
For 1981 82. a basic rate of $2,965 is proposed, an in
crease of 12 5% While the basic residence hall rate will be
set at $1,291 and the basic full board rate will be set at
$1,674 rates for specific residences and for partial board
plans will be set after further analysis by the staff
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $261 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $340 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment All apartments are furnished and
utilities are provided
Apartment rents for 1981 82 will be increased not less
than 15% Specific rents will be set after further analysis by
the staff, the analysis will consider the off-campus rental
market and the level of financial aid for graduate students
Off-campus rents for comparable units generally exceed
campus rents by 40-70%, and they have been increasing at
a far greater rate than have on-campus rents
The overall 12 5% increase in the basic room-and board
rate affects 5,050 undergraduates in various types of
housing In addition. 350 single graduate students in
Crothers residence halls. 500 single graduate students in
apartments, and 1,100 families in apartments will be af
fected by rates to be set following staff analysis
Operating expenses are expected to increase ap
proximately 11 % for 1981 82 The latest estimate of 1980-81
operations shows a loss of $315,000 on gross revenues of
$19,067,000 The proposed rate increases for 1981 82 will
generate net income of $212,000 (Present proiections in
dicate a net loss of $398 000 in 1982 83. $882,000 in 1983-
84 $263,000 in 1984-85. and $308,000 in 1985 86 mainly as
a result of new student housing construction- Ed )
The four most significant influences on room and board
rates across the next five years will be the debt service on
new housing for 800 students, a high level of major repair
and replacement activity, utility costs, and the absorption of
University overhead costs by Federal cost
allocation requirements (A-21)
Room and board rates must increase in the years before
housing is constructed, not only to match inflation, but to
build up reserves When the housing is occupied in 1982 and
1983. operating losses will be large initially due to the
payment of new debt service Reserves will be drawn down
for several years to smooth the pattern of rate increases
from 1983 to 1986
Operating and rnaior repair reserves are forecast to total
$2,050,000 at the end ol 1981 -82, 9 5% of operating costs

Following is a background paper prepared for the
Board of Trustees on establishment of tuition and room
and&oard rates for 1981 82:
An increase in general tuition and room and board rates
for 1981-82 aggregating 13 3% is recommended The
general tuition recommendation is an increase of 13 6%
room and board is 12.5%
We do not know—and do not inquire into —what other
institutions are planning regarding charges for 1981-82
Comparison for 1980-81 of the combined rates yields the
following table
Tuition, Fees, Percent Increase
School Room & Board Over 1979-80
Harvard $ 9,170 12 7
Vale 9,110 119
MIT 9,000 12 7
Stanford 8,921 122
Dartmouth 8,875 13 1
Brown 8,865 13 1
Princeton 8,805 12.2
Amherst 8,545 18 0
Cornell 8,410 113
Williams 8,346 19 1
Northwestern 8,315 10.6
Since these institutions provide our principal independent
sector competition, are subject to similar economic forces,
and have comparable quality objectives, we do not expect
that the relatively close clustering of the aggregate costs will
be much changed when the charges have been set by all for
next year
A. Establishment of the Tuition Rates for 1981-82
That the Committee on Finance and Administration and
the Committee on Academic Affairs and Development
recommend the general tuition rate for the academic year
1981-82 be set at $7,140 ($2,380 per regular quarter)
Further, these Committees recommend approval to set
tuition rates for M.D students at $8,340 ($2,780 per regular
quarter), and for the School of Law at $7,290 ($3,645 per
regular semester) for the academic year 1981 82
Background
A comparison of the 1981-82 tuition recommendations is
below
Stanford's present general tuition compares to the group
of institutions noted above as follows
1980-81 Percent Increase
School Tuition& Fees Over 1979-80
Harvard $6,490 13.0
Amherst 6,345 21.1
Princeton 6,300 12 8

Stanford 6,285 12.3
Yale 6,210 11.9
Dartmouth 6,210 13.1
MIT 6,200 17 0
Williams 6,016 20.1
Northwestern 5,985 10.5
Cornell 5,910 114
The average percentage increase of these 10 com
parison schools for 1980-81 was 14 4% or over 2 per
centage points greater than Stanford's. Leaving Amherst
and Williams out of the calculation, the average increase for
the remaining eight is 12 8, or 0.5% greater than Stanford s
The point of this comparison is simply to show that Stan
ford's tuition increases tend to be within the cluster of
comparable institutions both as to absolute dollars and rates
of change

Tuition Recommendations

Type 1980-81 1981-82 Increase Increase
General tuition $6,285 $7,140 $ 855 13 60

(M D Students)
School of Law 6,434 7,290 856 13 30

In arriving at the proposed increase for 1981 82. several
factors have been taken into consideration, none more
seriousiy than the relation of tuition to quality The relation to
quality is twofold the quality of the institution and the
educational program, and access to Stanford by students of
the highest calibre These two concerns are uneasy pari
ners
The relationship to institutional quality is at oottom, the
fact that tuition income provides about hail oi the income on
which the Operating Budget depends Whatever we must do
to maintain and enhance quality—sucf ; ?s maintain com
petition salary levels, respond to new and promising ideas,
keep the physical plant in good repair and provide proper
support services—is costly Its costliness is in proportion to
external forces—labor market increases, construction
costs, regulatory initiatives —as well as internal decisions
new initiatives and policy decisions on support service
levels. Thus, with simple but inexorable logic, our prices
must respond to our costs.
As we shall discuss in the Long Range Forecast
presentation, the effort to keep costs under control occupies
us now with no less vigor than in the previous decade when
$10 million was cut from the Operating Budget base Even
with those efforts, a tuition increase of the size proposed is a
vital factor in maintaining Stanford's quality its ability to
respond to the best of new ideas, and its capacity to deal
effectively with the operational requirements of a large,
physically and organizationally complex, and dynamic in
stitution. >
Regarding student access to Stanford, we looked at two
aspects of that issue, affordability and the characteristics of
the freshman class
First, affordability The major factor assisting students
and their families in meeting college costs is linancial aid At
the undergraduate level, where over 50% of our students
qualify for and receive some form of financial aid. ap
proximately $13 million are,dispersed as grant aid, with self
help (subsidized loans and term-time jobs) comprising the
difference beyond what the family contribution provides
University General Funds, endowment, and expendable gifts
provide a substantial share of the grant aid California State
Scholarships total over $2 million Other grants, as well as
loan and work/study funds, are allocated through Federal
programs
The Education Amendments of 1980. signed by President
Carter on October 3, 1980. provide for greater federal grant
aid, college work/study funds, loans to students, and loans to
parents. The loan terms are extremely favorable (7% to
students who have already borrowed. 9% to new borrowers,
with in-school interest forgiven for both, and loans to parents
are at 9%) For parents needing loans beyond federal loan
limits ($3,000/ year), the University's Parent Loan Plan is
available
While we are complacent about neither the State nor
Federal programs, as government at both levels begins to
wrestle with profound economic problems, neither do we
foresee major reversals in the structure of these programs
What we do foresee are hard-fought annual battles within the
appropriations process in concert with our colleague in
stitutions
At the graduate level, financial aid is substantial Need is
a less comprehensively applied criterion at this level due to
the age of the students, the relationship of much aid to
particular educational responsibilities (as with teaching and
research assistants), and the keying of certain awards to
ability Loan funds (some on terms as noted above) are
available A substantial boost in graduate support was
provided this year in the form of College Work/Study funds
becoming newly available for graduate purposes This meant
that many heretofore un- or undersupported students

could—if Ihey met eligibility requirements—receive this
form of aid toi work connected with their programs
The availability of aid on both a demonstrated need basis
and a felt need basis (ie . through low-interest loans) as well
as program-related assistantships for graduate students
does, we believe, continue to keep Stanford affordable to
those who qualify for admission
On the question of student calibre we look with particular
intensity at each year s freshman class, especially in regard
to those who apply for financial aid This year s review
reveals very little change from last year on the relevant
dimensions Applications were up 7% over the prior year
The academic ratings of the applicant pool, of those ad
mitted. and of those who enrolled were marginally stronger
than last year's The yield ratio (percent of those admitted
who enroll) was 64 5% (Because the yield ratio has been so
high in recent years, the number of admissions was
diminished by 39 in order to come closer to the target size of
1,500 for the freshman class) Of the 35 5% enrolling
elsewhere. 17% chose public institutions and 83% private
This ratio has changed very little over the past nine years

Among those electing private alternatives, over one-third
chose Harvard-Radcliffe. Yale, or Princeton, this too is
similar to past findings
Enrollment of black and chicano students was slightly
below last year's figures, which were the highest ever for
both groups
The report issued after this year's review by the Offices
of Admissions and Financial Aids concludes with this
paragraph
The research this year again points to the continued
strength of the applicant pool and the enrolling freshman
class Most measures have remained fairly stable over time,
and where changes have occurred, they seem to have been
within familiar ranges, indicators of at least a mildly positive
trend, or a function of the diminished number of students
admitted These results are reassuring, particularly with
respect to the high cost/financial aids (concerns)
We conclude from this that the uneasy partnership noted
above continues to work high tuition is one price of high
quality, and financial aid keeps that quality accessible to
those able to benefit from it, whatever their economic cir
cumstances
Besides the issues of institutional quality and student
access, we reviewed general economic considerations The
consensus of those economists and other knowledgeable
sources whom we consulted was that inflation would decline
to the 10-11 % range from the 13-15% range it has occupied
over the past year or so Results of the Presidential election
were not anticipated to have more than a marginal effect on
inflation in the near future The Federal Reserve is unlikely to
prevail in slowing economic growth through money supply
constraints, political pressures for reduced unemployment
will likely dissuade the Federal government from a slow
growth policy and thus reinforce higher long-term inflation
rates As the nation recovers from the current recession,
real economic growth should be strong between 1982 and
1984 .
The effect of this complex of economic forces on the
family income and family financial capacity of current and
potential Stanford parents is difficult to discern Family
incomes nationwide appear to be keeping up with or slightly
bettering the rate of inflation Yet the income tax structure
' invades the rate of disposable income increase m middle
and upper income families severely
The tuition increase recommendation proposed will no
idoubt for many parents make the cosh of a Stanford
education relatively more expensive, however, the fact that
the 1980-81 increase lagged inflation provides an offset to
that relative increase

To conclude this background note we mane two com
ments on the recommendations tor medicine IMDI and law
Last year the M D tuition was increased 20" " to bring it into
line with the historical proportion that tuition was of
operating costs (22%) when the ratio was established in
1972-73 At that time it was planned that future increases
would be at the same rate as the general tuition which is the
basis lor the $8,340 figure Then-current students would be
"held harmless'' for the extraordinary portion of the 1980-81
increase The standard increase then and now is expected
to be borne by the students from their own funds or from
additional financial aid in cases of hardship
The tuition for the School of Law tracks the University's
general rate and maintains the $150 differential which was
established during the Budget Equilibrium Program effective
1976-77
Establishment of room and board rates for 1981-82.
The Committee on Finance and Administration and the
Committee on Academic Affairs and Development
recommend that the basic room and board rate for 'un
dergraduate students for the academic year 1981-82 be set
at $2,965. an increase of 12 5% that the room rate be set at
$1,291. an increase of 15 0%. and the full board rate be set
at $1 674. an increase of 10 6%. and that rates for specific
undergraduate residence units and for partial boatd plans be
set within the pattern of these rates

be and is hereby authorized to approve specific rates for
undergraduate and graduate student residences and food
services, and for Escondido Village apartments

general rate and maintains the $150 differential which was
established during the Budget Equilibrium Program effective
1976-77
Establishment of room and board rates for 1981-82.
The Committee on Finance and Administration and the
Committee on Academic Affairs and Development
recommend that the basic room and board rate for 'un
dergraduate students for the academic year 1981-82 be set
at $2,965. an increase of 12 5% that the room rate be set at
$1,291. an increase of 15 0%. and the full board rate be set
at $1 674. an increase of 10 6%. and that rates for specific
undergraduate residence units and for partial boatd plans be
set within the pattern of these rates
Further that the vice-president for business and finance
be and is hereby authorized to approve specific rates for
undergraduate and graduate student residences and food
services, and for Escondido Village apartments
Background:
In December. 1979. the Board approved a 1980 81 basic
room and board rate of $2,636 The basic room rate was set
at $1 123 (full service residence with University operated
kitchen) and the basic board rate at $1,513 (19 meals per
week) Room rates for the current year vary from $1,071 in
self-operated houses and fraternity clusters to $1 254 in full
service residences with self-operated kitchens
For 1981 82. a basic rate of $2,965 is proposed, an in
crease of 12 5% While the basic residence hall rate will be
set at $1,291 and the basic full board rate will be set at
$1,674 rates for specific residences and for partial board
plans will be set after further analysis by the staff
Current rents in Escondido Village vary from $261 per
month for a one-bedroom apartment to $340 per month for a
four-bedroom apartment All apartments are furnished and
utilities are provided
Apartment rents for 1981 82 will be increased not less
than 15% Specific rents will be set after further analysis by
the staff, the analysis will consider the off-campus rental
market and the level of financial aid for graduate students
Off-campus rents for comparable units generally exceed
campus rents by 40-70%, and they have been increasing at
a far greater rate than have on-campus rents
The overall 12 5% increase in the basic room-and board
rate affects 5,050 undergraduates in various types of
housing In addition. 350 single graduate students in
Crothers residence halls. 500 single graduate students in
apartments, and 1,100 families in apartments will be af
fected by rates to be set following staff analysis
Operating expenses are expected to increase ap
proximately 11 % for 1981 82 The latest estimate of 1980-81
operations shows a loss of $315,000 on gross revenues of
$19,067,000 The proposed rate increases for 1981 82 will
generate net income of $212,000 (Present proiections in
dicate a net loss of $398 000 in 1982 83. $882,000 in 1983-
84 $263,000 in 1984-85. and $308,000 in 1985 86 mainly as
a result of new student housing construction- Ed )
The four most significant influences on room and board
rates across the next five years will be the debt service on
new housing for 800 students, a high level of major repair
and replacement activity, utility costs, and the absorption of
University overhead costs by Federal cost
allocation requirements (A-21)
Room and board rates must increase in the years before
housing is constructed, not only to match inflation, but to
build up reserves When the housing is occupied in 1982 and
1983. operating losses will be large initially due to the
payment of new debt service Reserves will be drawn down
for several years to smooth the pattern of rate increases
from 1983 to 1986
Operating and rnaior repair reserves are forecast to total
$2,050,000 at the end ol 1981 -82, 9 5% of operating costs

Following is a background paper prepared for the
Board of Trustees on establishment of tuition and room
and&oard rates for 1981 82:
An increase in general tuition and room and board rates
for 1981-82 aggregating 13 3% is recommended The
general tuition recommendation is an increase of 13 6%
room and board is 12.5%
We do not know—and do not inquire into —what other
institutions are planning regarding charges for 1981-82
Comparison for 1980-81 of the combined rates yields the
following table
Tuition, Fees, Percent Increase
School Room & Board Over 1979-80
Harvard $ 9,170 12 7
Vale 9,110 119
MIT 9,000 12 7
Stanford 8,921 122
Dartmouth 8,875 13 1
Brown 8,865 13 1
Princeton 8,805 12.2
Amherst 8,545 18 0
Cornell 8,410 113
Williams 8,346 19 1
Northwestern 8,315 10.6
Since these institutions provide our principal independent
sector competition, are subject to similar economic forces,
and have comparable quality objectives, we do not expect
that the relatively close clustering of the aggregate costs will
be much changed when the charges have been set by all for
next year
A. Establishment of the Tuition Rates for 1981-82
That the Committee on Finance and Administration and
the Committee on Academic Affairs and Development
recommend the general tuition rate for the academic year
1981-82 be set at $7,140 ($2,380 per regular quarter)
Further, these Committees recommend approval to set
tuition rates for M.D students at $8,340 ($2,780 per regular
quarter), and for the School of Law at $7,290 ($3,645 per
regular semester) for the academic year 1981 82
Background
A comparison of the 1981-82 tuition recommendations is
below
Stanford's present general tuition compares to the group
of institutions noted above as follows
1980-81 Percent Increase
School Tuition& Fees Over 1979-80
Harvard $6,490 13.0
Amherst 6,345 21.1
Princeton 6,300 12 8
'Brown 6,290 12.7
Stanford 6,285 12.3
Yale 6,210 11.9
Dartmouth 6,210 13.1
MIT 6,200 17 0
Williams 6,016 20.1
Northwestern 5,985 10.5
Cornell 5,910 114
The average percentage increase of these 10 com
parison schools for 1980-81 was 14 4% or over 2 per
centage points greater than Stanford's. Leaving Amherst
and Williams out of the calculation, the average increase for
the remaining eight is 12 8, or 0.5% greater than Stanford s
The point of this comparison is simply to show that Stan
ford's tuition increases tend to be within the cluster of
comparable institutions both as to absolute dollars and rates
of change

Tuition Recommendations

School of Law 6,434 7,290 856 13 30

In arriving at the proposed increase for 1981 82. several
factors have been taken into consideration, none more
seriousiy than the relation of tuition to quality The relation to
quality is twofold the quality of the institution and the
educational program, and access to Stanford by students of
the highest calibre These two concerns are uneasy pari
ners
The relationship to institutional quality is at oottom, the
fact that tuition income provides about hail oi the income on
which the Operating Budget depends Whatever we must do
to maintain and enhance quality—sucf ; ?s maintain com
petition salary levels, respond to new and promising ideas,
keep the physical plant in good repair and provide proper
support services—is costly Its costliness is in proportion to
external forces—labor market increases, construction
costs, regulatory initiatives —as well as internal decisions
new initiatives and policy decisions on support service
levels. Thus, with simple but inexorable logic, our prices
must respond to our costs.
As we shall discuss in the Long Range Forecast
presentation, the effort to keep costs under control occupies
us now with no less vigor than in the previous decade when
$10 million was cut from the Operating Budget base Even
with those efforts, a tuition increase of the size proposed is a
vital factor in maintaining Stanford's quality its ability to
respond to the best of new ideas, and its capacity to deal
effectively with the operational requirements of a large,
physically and organizationally complex, and dynamic in
stitution. >
Regarding student access to Stanford, we looked at two
aspects of that issue, affordability and the characteristics of
the freshman class
First, affordability The major factor assisting students
and their families in meeting college costs is linancial aid At
the undergraduate level, where over 50% of our students
qualify for and receive some form of financial aid. ap
proximately $13 million are,dispersed as grant aid, with self
help (subsidized loans and term-time jobs) comprising the
difference beyond what the family contribution provides
University General Funds, endowment, and expendable gifts
provide a substantial share of the grant aid California State
Scholarships total over $2 million Other grants, as well as
loan and work/study funds, are allocated through Federal
programs
The Education Amendments of 1980. signed by President
Carter on October 3, 1980. provide for greater federal grant
aid, college work/study funds, loans to students, and loans to
parents. The loan terms are extremely favorable (7% to
students who have already borrowed. 9% to new borrowers,
with in-school interest forgiven for both, and loans to parents
are at 9%) For parents needing loans beyond federal loan
limits ($3,000/ year), the University's Parent Loan Plan is
available
While we are complacent about neither the State nor
Federal programs, as government at both levels begins to
wrestle with profound economic problems, neither do we
foresee major reversals in the structure of these programs
What we do foresee are hard-fought annual battles within the
appropriations process in concert with our colleague in
stitutions
At the graduate level, financial aid is substantial Need is
a less comprehensively applied criterion at this level due to
the age of the students, the relationship of much aid to
particular educational responsibilities (as with teaching and
research assistants), and the keying of certain awards to
ability Loan funds (some on terms as noted above) are
available A substantial boost in graduate support was
provided this year in the form of College Work/Study funds
becoming newly available for graduate purposes This meant
that many heretofore un- or undersupported students

could—if Ihey met eligibility requirements—receive this
form of aid toi work connected with their programs
The availability of aid on both a demonstrated need basis
and a felt need basis (ie . through low-interest loans) as well
as program-related assistantships for graduate students
does, we believe, continue to keep Stanford affordable to
those who qualify for admission
On the question of student calibre we look with particular
intensity at each year s freshman class, especially in regard
to those who apply for financial aid This year s review
reveals very little change from last year on the relevant
dimensions Applications were up 7% over the prior year
The academic ratings of the applicant pool, of those ad
mitted. and of those who enrolled were marginally stronger
than last year's The yield ratio (percent of those admitted
who enroll) was 64 5% (Because the yield ratio has been so
high in recent years, the number of admissions was
diminished by 39 in order to come closer to the target size of
1,500 for the freshman class) Of the 35 5% enrolling
elsewhere. 17% chose public institutions and 83% private
This ratio has changed very little over the past nine years
Enrollment Choices of Admitted Freshmen
Enrolling Elsewhere
Percent Percent
Year Choosing Private Choosing Public
1972-73 75 25
1973-74 77 23
1974-75 82 18
1975-76 80 20
1976-77 76 24
1977-78 78 22
1978-79 77 * 23
1979-80 84 16
1980-81 83 17
Among those electing private alternatives, over one-third
chose Harvard-Radcliffe. Yale, or Princeton, this too is
similar to past findings
Enrollment of black and chicano students was slightly
below last year's figures, which were the highest ever for
both groups
The report issued after this year's review by the Offices
of Admissions and Financial Aids concludes with this
paragraph
The research this year again points to the continued
strength of the applicant pool and the enrolling freshman
class Most measures have remained fairly stable over time,
and where changes have occurred, they seem to have been
within familiar ranges, indicators of at least a mildly positive
trend, or a function of the diminished number of students
admitted These results are reassuring, particularly with
respect to the high cost/financial aids (concerns)
We conclude from this that the uneasy partnership noted
above continues to work high tuition is one price of high
quality, and financial aid keeps that quality accessible to
those able to benefit from it, whatever their economic cir
cumstances
Besides the issues of institutional quality and student
access, we reviewed general economic considerations The
consensus of those economists and other knowledgeable
sources whom we consulted was that inflation would decline
to the 10-11 % range from the 13-15% range it has occupied
over the past year or so Results of the Presidential election
were not anticipated to have more than a marginal effect on
inflation in the near future The Federal Reserve is unlikely to
prevail in slowing economic growth through money supply
constraints, political pressures for reduced unemployment
will likely dissuade the Federal government from a slow
growth policy and thus reinforce higher long-term inflation
rates As the nation recovers from the current recession,
real economic growth should be strong between 1982 and
1984 .
The effect of this complex of economic forces on the
family income and family financial capacity of current and
potential Stanford parents is difficult to discern Family
incomes nationwide appear to be keeping up with or slightly
bettering the rate of inflation Yet the income tax structure
' invades the rate of disposable income increase m middle
and upper income families severely
The tuition increase recommendation proposed will no
idoubt for many parents make the cosh of a Stanford
education relatively more expensive, however, the fact that
the 1980-81 increase lagged inflation provides an offset to
that relative increase

To conclude this background note we mane two com
ments on the recommendations tor medicine IMDI and law
Last year the M D tuition was increased 20" " to bring it into
line with the historical proportion that tuition was of
operating costs (22%) when the ratio was established in
1972-73 At that time it was planned that future increases
would be at the same rate as the general tuition which is the
basis lor the $8,340 figure Then-current students would be
"held harmless'' for the extraordinary portion of the 1980-81
increase The standard increase then and now is expected
to be borne by the students from their own funds or from
additional financial aid in cases of hardship
The tuition for the School of Law tracks the University's
general rate and maintains the $150 differential which was
established during the Budget Equilibrium Program effective
1976-77
