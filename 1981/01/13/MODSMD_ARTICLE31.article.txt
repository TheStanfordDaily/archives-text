Begin government near collapse
Jerusalem — An overwhelming majority of Is
raeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin s Cabinet
ministers yesterday swung behind plans to dissolve
the Parliament and hold a national election of a new
government, but the formality of surrendering the
coalition was postponed at least another day.
Prolonging the inevitible collapse of his coalition
in an apparent attempt to find a face-saving transi
tion in which the government will appear to have
made a free-choice. Begin said his ministers will
consult with their respective political factions in the
Parliament before a bill is introduced to hold new
elections.
Deputy Prime Minister Yigael Yadin said he be
lieved that a bill to disolve the Knesset and hold elec
tions in mid-June would be formally approved by the
Cabinet today.

sign. but will continue at the head of a constitutional
ly functioning minority government until elections
are held for a new parliament and a new government
is formed.
By not formally resigning, and thus allowing his
Cabinet to be appointed a caretaker government
pending elections. Begin is making himself vulner
able to a spate of opposition motions of no-con
fidence. However, coalition sources said the Likud
will probably join with the opposition Labor Party in
a bill to disolve the Knesset, thus extracting a tacit
agreement by the opposition not to harass the gov
ernment with further no-confidence motions.

33.000-member APA. "We're doing this overall for
the public safety."

done everything we can to improve the system,"
said Alex Garvis. the FAA's regional public affairs
officer, in response to questions about the allega

New smoking report issued
Washington — The surgeon general advised
American smokers yesterday that although low tar
and nicotine cigarettes may reduce the risk of lung
cancer, they contain unknown quantities of ad
ditives whose health effects can't be assessed
Surgeon General Julius Richmond said he has
tried without success to obtain from the tobacco in
dustry information on which of about 300 additives
are included in specific cigarettes.
He said Congress may be asked to grant the agen
cy authority to obtain such information, which the
industry regards as among its trade secrets — if the
data is not made available voluntarily. Richmond
said there is a possibility that some additives may
cause tumors or cancer or be toxic.
"There is no such thing as a safe cigarette." Rich
mond said in his 227-page annual report on smoking
and health. "In the case of lung cancer, some
cigarettes appear to be less hazardous than others,
although the reduction in risk is minimal and lim
ited No such conclusion can be reached for
cardiovascular disease, emphysema, bronchitis or

pregnancy effects.
About one third of all smokers use low tar and nic

San Francisco — The Sacramento Bee — focusing
on the sexual misconduct case against state Sen.
Alan Robbins — yesterday asked the state Supreme
Court to overturn an 1872 law allowing a defendant
to insist on a closed preliminary hearing.
The newspaper noted the high court has agreed to
hear arguments on a similar request bv the San -Jose
Mercury Xetrs in a case involving a former coun
cilman from that city.
But the Hec said the San Jose case is based only on
the U.S. constitutional issue and its own request is
under the state constitution's section guaranteeing
freedom of expression.
It pointed out seven trial judges have found the
law violates the right of the media to free ex
pression.
Robbins. a Democrat representing the San
Fernando Valley in the state Senate, was charged
last year with 10 felony counts of illegal sexual rela
tions involving three girls under age 18. Robbins

Protesting Poles evicted
Warsaw — Independent Polish workers de

Begin government near collapse
Jerusalem — An overwhelming majority of Is

ministers yesterday swung behind plans to dissolve
the Parliament and hold a national election of a new
government, but the formality of surrendering the
coalition was postponed at least another day.
Prolonging the inevitible collapse of his coalition
in an apparent attempt to find a face-saving transi
tion in which the government will appear to have
made a free-choice. Begin said his ministers will
consult with their respective political factions in the
Parliament before a bill is introduced to hold new
elections.
Deputy Prime Minister Yigael Yadin said he be
lieved that a bill to disolve the Knesset and hold elec
tions in mid-June would be formally approved by the
Cabinet today.
Begin made it clear that he does not intend to re
sign. but will continue at the head of a constitutional
ly functioning minority government until elections
are held for a new parliament and a new government
is formed.
By not formally resigning, and thus allowing his
Cabinet to be appointed a caretaker government
pending elections. Begin is making himself vulner
able to a spate of opposition motions of no-con
fidence. However, coalition sources said the Likud
will probably join with the opposition Labor Party in
a bill to disolve the Knesset, thus extracting a tacit
agreement by the opposition not to harass the gov
ernment with further no-confidence motions.

ber Sheik Mohammed Abu Rabia, the only Bedouin
member of Israel's Parliament and a forceful oppo

being investigated
Airline pilots to protest
San Francisco — The nation's airline pilots will
halt air traffic for one day to press demands for safe

Deeds said a nationwide shutdown would take
place either March 1 or March 2 He said only firm
written guarantees of safety improvements from
the incoming Reagan administration could block the
action, which was discussed at a meeting in Atlanta
over the weekend

sponse of the FAA to air safety issues." Deeds said.
"Our main function is safety and. of course, we've
done everything we can to improve the system,"
said Alex Garvis. the FAA's regional public affairs
officer, in response to questions about the allega

Airline pilots to protest
San Francisco — The nation's airline pilots will
halt air traffic for one day to press demands for safe
ty improvements, demands they say the Federal
Aviation Administration has ignored, an Airline Pi
lots Association official said yesterday.
"We're frustrated in our safety efforts." said
Capt Dick Deeds, area safety coordinator for the
33.000-member APA. "We're doing this overall for
the public safety."
Deeds said a nationwide shutdown would take
place either March 1 or March 2 He said only firm
written guarantees of safety improvements from
the incoming Reagan administration could block the
action, which was discussed at a meeting in Atlanta
over the weekend
The shutdown was approved because of the un
ion's "total frustration with the inadequacy of re
sponse of the FAA to air safety issues." Deeds said.
"Our main function is safety and. of course, we've
done everything we can to improve the system,"
said Alex Garvis. the FAA's regional public affairs
officer, in response to questions about the allega
tions.
New smoking report issued
Washington — The surgeon general advised
American smokers yesterday that although low tar
and nicotine cigarettes may reduce the risk of lung
cancer, they contain unknown quantities of ad
ditives whose health effects can't be assessed
Surgeon General Julius Richmond said he has
tried without success to obtain from the tobacco in
dustry information on which of about 300 additives
are included in specific cigarettes.
He said Congress may be asked to grant the agen
cy authority to obtain such information, which the
industry regards as among its trade secrets — if the
data is not made available voluntarily. Richmond
said there is a possibility that some additives may
cause tumors or cancer or be toxic.
"There is no such thing as a safe cigarette." Rich
mond said in his 227-page annual report on smoking
and health. "In the case of lung cancer, some
cigarettes appear to be less hazardous than others,
although the reduction in risk is minimal and lim
ited No such conclusion can be reached for
cardiovascular disease, emphysema, bronchitis or

pregnancy effects.
About one third of all smokers use low tar and nic
otine brands Cigarette smoking is linked with about
326.000 deaths a year, including 85.000 for lung
cancer alone, the government savs

San Francisco — The Sacramento Bee — focusing
on the sexual misconduct case against state Sen.
Alan Robbins — yesterday asked the state Supreme
Court to overturn an 1872 law allowing a defendant
to insist on a closed preliminary hearing.
The newspaper noted the high court has agreed to
hear arguments on a similar request bv the San -Jose
Mercury Xetrs in a case involving a former coun
cilman from that city.
But the Hec said the San Jose case is based only on
the U.S. constitutional issue and its own request is
under the state constitution's section guaranteeing
freedom of expression.
It pointed out seven trial judges have found the
law violates the right of the media to free ex
pression.
Robbins. a Democrat representing the San
Fernando Valley in the state Senate, was charged
last year with 10 felony counts of illegal sexual rela
tions involving three girls under age 18. Robbins
pleaded innocent to all charges when arraigned Nov.

ministers yesterday swung behind plans to dissolve
the Parliament and hold a national election of a new
government, but the formality of surrendering the
coalition was postponed at least another day.

made a free-choice. Begin said his ministers will
consult with their respective political factions in the
Parliament before a bill is introduced to hold new
elections.
Deputy Prime Minister Yigael Yadin said he be
lieved that a bill to disolve the Knesset and hold elec
