# Haig answers Senate queries

### 
Washington (AP) — Alexander
Haig testified yesterday that the Unit
ed States must be prepared to act —
alone if necessary — to protect the in
dustrialized world's access to Middle
East oil.
The former NATO commander told
the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee that an expanded U.S. military
presence in the Mideast is necessary
because the NATO alliance cannot be
counted on to expand its defense com
mitments to include the oil lines of the
Persian Gulf.
Haig, a retired four-star general
and former NATO commander, said in
response to questions that he believes
the threat to European allies no longer
consists solely of a potential frontal
attack in central Europe, but now in
cludes a possible disruption in Mideast
oil supplies.
He said the United States should
seek broader consultations with its al
lies on how best to meet this new
threat.
"But we would be deceiving
ourselves if we were to believe that
the alliance would, in the foreseeable

future, expand its borders by con
sensus" to include the oil-producing
regions of the Persian Gulf. Haig said.
If agreement cannot be reached
with the allies on how best to protect
the flow of oil. he said, "then we as a
nation must be prepared to move,
even unilaterally, to ensure access to
these vital interests."
Haig declined to say whether he
thought a permanent U.S. base or
some other "intermittent" presence
is needed in the area. That, he said, is
"a question that must be dealt with in
a very sensitive way" with the nations
involved.
But he said he does believe that "an
increased presence by U.S. military
forces is necessary in the period
ahead."
Haig spoke on his third day of testi
mony before the committee, which is
dividing its attention between learn
ing Haig's foreign policy views as a
prospective secretary of state and ef
forts to gain access to 100 hours of
taped White House conversations be
tween Haig and former President
Richard Nixon.
Dr Robert Warner, the archivist of
the United States, told the committee
he had asked Nixon to waive legal
time limits so the subpoenaed materi
al sought bv the panel can be released
at once. Warner said the law requires
that he not release any tapes or sup
porting documents without giving the
former president at least five days to
respond.
The committee chairman. Sen.
Charles Percy (R-Ill.). issued a sub
poena Sunday night for the logs and in
dexes to the tape recordings made in
the spring and summer of 1973. At the
time. Haig was White House chief of
staff and the Watergate scandal was
engulfing Nixon's presidency.
Sen Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.). told
Warner it was obvious that only one
person stands in the way of immediate
access to the subpoenaed logs, "and
that one person is Richard Nixon."

Replied Warner: "You do hit at the
heart of the matter."
Percy said the issuing of the sub
poena. a first step toward obtaining
"relevant" tapes, was not intended to
delay Haig's expected confirmation
by the full Senate beyond Ronald Rea
gan's inauguration as president on
Jan. 20.
Sen Richard Lugar (R-Ind ). said
efforts by committee Democrats to
obtain the tapes may result only in
damaging Haig's effectiveness.
Percy agreed and told Haig. "We
want no cloud to hang over your
head."
But Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), said
he resented the implication that Dem
ocrats were somehow doing some
thing wrong by insisting that the tapes
be subpoenaed
Glenn said he will question Haig
closely about his White House service
during the Watergate years.
"These were serious matters —
people were being assassinated and
governments toppled . .." Glenn
said "General Haig was right in the
middle of that. I don't know whether
he was following orders or making de
cisions himself."
Confirmation hearings began yes
terday for Labor Secretary-designate
Raymond Donovan and former South
Carolina Gov. James Edwards, nomi
nated for energy secretary.
The Senate Labor and Human Re
sources Committee released docu
ments indicating that a Teamsters
Union local in New York placed a
"ghost" worker on the payroll of
Donovan's New Jersey construction
company three years ago "as a price
for labor peace." A ghost employee is
paid but does not show up for work.
Edwards told the Senate Energy
Committee the nation must "sustain
and increase our use of nuclear
power." He also urged allowing the
marketplace, unfettered by obstruc
tive laws and regulations, to meet the
nation's energy needs.

Union local in New York placed a

company three years ago "as a price
for labor peace." A ghost employee is
paid but does not show up for work.

Washington (AP) — Alexander
Haig testified yesterday that the Unit
ed States must be prepared to act —
alone if necessary — to protect the in
dustrialized world's access to Middle
East oil.
The former NATO commander told
the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee that an expanded U.S. military
presence in the Mideast is necessary
because the NATO alliance cannot be
counted on to expand its defense com
mitments to include the oil lines of the
Persian Gulf.
Haig, a retired four-star general
and former NATO commander, said in
response to questions that he believes
the threat to European allies no longer
consists solely of a potential frontal
attack in central Europe, but now in
cludes a possible disruption in Mideast
oil supplies.
He said the United States should
seek broader consultations with its al
lies on how best to meet this new
threat.
"But we would be deceiving
ourselves if we were to believe that
the alliance would, in the foreseeable

future, expand its borders by con
sensus" to include the oil-producing
regions of the Persian Gulf. Haig said.
If agreement cannot be reached
with the allies on how best to protect
the flow of oil. he said, "then we as a
nation must be prepared to move,
even unilaterally, to ensure access to
these vital interests."
Haig declined to say whether he
thought a permanent U.S. base or
some other "intermittent" presence
is needed in the area. That, he said, is
"a question that must be dealt with in
a very sensitive way" with the nations
involved.
But he said he does believe that "an
increased presence by U.S. military
forces is necessary in the period
ahead."
Haig spoke on his third day of testi
mony before the committee, which is
dividing its attention between learn
ing Haig's foreign policy views as a
prospective secretary of state and ef
forts to gain access to 100 hours of
taped White House conversations be
tween Haig and former President
Richard Nixon.
Dr Robert Warner, the archivist of
the United States, told the committee
he had asked Nixon to waive legal
time limits so the subpoenaed materi
al sought bv the panel can be released
at once. Warner said the law requires
that he not release any tapes or sup
porting documents without giving the
former president at least five days to
respond.
The committee chairman. Sen.
Charles Percy (R-Ill.). issued a sub
poena Sunday night for the logs and in
dexes to the tape recordings made in
the spring and summer of 1973. At the
time. Haig was White House chief of
staff and the Watergate scandal was
engulfing Nixon's presidency.
Sen Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.). told
Warner it was obvious that only one
person stands in the way of immediate
access to the subpoenaed logs, "and
that one person is Richard Nixon."

Replied Warner: "You do hit at the
heart of the matter."
Percy said the issuing of the sub
poena. a first step toward obtaining
"relevant" tapes, was not intended to
delay Haig's expected confirmation
by the full Senate beyond Ronald Rea
gan's inauguration as president on
Jan. 20.
Sen Richard Lugar (R-Ind ). said
efforts by committee Democrats to
obtain the tapes may result only in
damaging Haig's effectiveness.
Percy agreed and told Haig. "We
want no cloud to hang over your
head."
But Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), said
he resented the implication that Dem
ocrats were somehow doing some
thing wrong by insisting that the tapes
be subpoenaed
Glenn said he will question Haig
closely about his White House service
during the Watergate years.
"These were serious matters —
people were being assassinated and
governments toppled . .." Glenn
said "General Haig was right in the
middle of that. I don't know whether
he was following orders or making de
cisions himself."
Confirmation hearings began yes
terday for Labor Secretary-designate
Raymond Donovan and former South
Carolina Gov. James Edwards, nomi
nated for energy secretary.

sources Committee released docu
ments indicating that a Teamsters
