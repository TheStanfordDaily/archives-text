# Auto industry predicts better year
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
The U.S. auto industry was going to
recover in 1980. At least that is what
executives kept telling themselves
and anyone else who would listen
before the sweet dreams of January
became the nightmares of December

\ews analysis

Instead of returning to health, the
auto makers had their worst year
since 1961. Chrysler Corp nearly went
out of business. American Motors
Corp. had to be rescued from insolven
cy by Renault, its French partner,
and. as a group, the companies that
make up the nation's largest industry
lost over $4 billion
Now the same executives aresaving
that the auto industry will make a
comeback in 1981, and they might be
right. Wall Street analysts who follow
the auto makers are forecasting a
gradual upturn in business throughout
the year, generally in line with predic
tions of economists that the nation will
continue pulling out of its recession.
The underlying reason for this
modest optimism is that even though
car sales have been down and the econ
omy has been sour, people have con
tinued to drive and wear out their
cars More than the usual number of
vehicles are expected to be scrapped
in the next few years, sending more
than the usual number of customers
out shopping for new cars.
"The nation's fleet keeps getting
older and older," one analyst said
"The drivers can clearly wait longer

than the industry would like them to
hut eventually someone is going to
have to cave in and buy a new car."
But analysts caution that this "pent
up demand" for new cars could, as it
has been more than a year, be kept in
check bv several factors.
High interest rates have pushed up
the cost to the consumer of financing a
new car.
Higher prices of the new small cars
from Detroit have turned off many
buyers. And comparatively stable
gasoline prices have taken away much
of the incentive to rush out and trade
an old gas guzzler for a new gas miser.
Little incentive
"There's been very little incentive
for a consumer to pay small-car prices
today when gas is at $1.30, interest
rates are over 15 percent and his used
car is virtually obsolete and
worthless." said Arthur Davis, an
analyst with Prescott. Ball and
Turben. "He's just holding on to his
old car longer."
Davis was among the most
pessimistic of a half-dozen analysts in
terviewed by the Los Angeles Times
for their assessment of the industry's
chances of recovery this year. They
varied somewhat in their forecasts,
but all generally agreed that the auto
makers would have a better year in
1981 than they did in 1980
Economists regard the auto in
dustry as a main engine of the U.S.
economy, for one out of every seven of
the nation's jobs are in some way re
lated to vehicle manufacturing Ups
and downs in car sales have tradi

tionallv led to ups and downs in eco
nomic conditions, and the struggles of
the auto industry over the past year
have been closely watched by policy
makers worried about the health of
the general economy.
Total domestic and import car sales
in 1980 were just under 9 million The
average of the sales forecasts of the
six analysts for 1981 is 9.9 million,
ranging from a low of 9.5 million to a
high of 10.75 million
High predictions
General Motors Corp. and Ford Mo
tor Co. have each officially predicted
10 million sales for 1981 The Depart
ment of Commerce is forecasting 9.7
million And Chase Econometrics, the
economic forecasting arm of Chase
Manhattan Bank, has estimated 1981
sales at 9 2 million
Sandra Shaber. a senior economist
at Chase, thinks that poor economic
conditions early in the year will under
mine a quick recovery by the industry
and mute any stimulus that could be
expected from the introduction of new
models in the spring
"I'd like to be more optimistic
about it. but all the factors point
against any pickup in sales." Shaber
said, adding that Chase sees continued
high interest rates, continued inflation
and higher unemployment in the first
few months of the year.
At the other end of the spectrum is
David Healy of the Wall Street firm of
Drexel Burnham Lambert, who fore
sees 1981 sales of 10.75 million.
' But we'll need a steep decline in in
terest rates plus no new recession to
reach that." Healy said. "I think car
sales are probably about 2 million to 3
million off trend now and we'll get
back to normal in 1981 But if the econ
omy is sluggish, then the9.s-million to
10-million guvs might be right."
Reduced losses
A pickup in sales would allow the
auto makers to spread their fixed ov
erhead costs across a broader sales
base, reducing the losses they had in
1980 GM is expected to announce a
loss for last year of about $850 million,
its first deficit in 61 years. With the
final figures due in a few weeks.
Ford's deficit will probably total $1.5
billion, analysts believe, and Chrysler
is expected to lose $1 7 billion
However, most analysts think GM
will return to profitability for all of
1981. with estimated total earnings of
over $1 billion. Ford is expected to
break even for the year, while
Chrysler's losses will continue.

analysts say.
"Chrysler's situation is quite
tenuous and fragile.'' said David Ei
senberg of Sanford C. Bernstein and
Co. "They've got to get those loan
guarantees to survive."
Eisenberg and others expect import
sales in 1981 to remain at about their
record levels of 1980 However, since
they expect domestic sales to in
crease. they forecast that the import
share of total sales will drop to 24
percent in 1981 from last year's 26.6
percent.
And the analysts agree that a re
newed rise in interest rates or further
decline in consumer confidence about
the economy could again short-circuit
an industry recovery.
"If the economy declines further, as
we think it will into the second quar
ter. you might need a gasoline tax or
tax credits to help sell cars." said
Davis of Prescott. Ball. "People will
be more inclined to wait again."

\ews analysis

Instead of returning to health, the
auto makers had their worst year
since 1961. Chrysler Corp nearly went
out of business. American Motors
Corp. had to be rescued from insolven
cy by Renault, its French partner,
and. as a group, the companies that
make up the nation's largest industry
lost over $4 billion
Now the same executives aresaving
that the auto industry will make a
comeback in 1981, and they might be
right. Wall Street analysts who follow
the auto makers are forecasting a
gradual upturn in business throughout
the year, generally in line with predic
tions of economists that the nation will
continue pulling out of its recession.
The underlying reason for this
modest optimism is that even though
car sales have been down and the econ
omy has been sour, people have con
tinued to drive and wear out their
cars More than the usual number of
vehicles are expected to be scrapped
in the next few years, sending more
than the usual number of customers
out shopping for new cars.
"The nation's fleet keeps getting
older and older," one analyst said
"The drivers can clearly wait longer

than the industry would like them to
hut eventually someone is going to
have to cave in and buy a new car."
But analysts caution that this "pent
up demand" for new cars could, as it
has been more than a year, be kept in
check bv several factors.
High interest rates have pushed up
the cost to the consumer of financing a
new car.
Higher prices of the new small cars
from Detroit have turned off many
buyers. And comparatively stable
gasoline prices have taken away much
of the incentive to rush out and trade
an old gas guzzler for a new gas miser.
Little incentive
"There's been very little incentive
for a consumer to pay small-car prices
today when gas is at $1.30, interest
rates are over 15 percent and his used
car is virtually obsolete and
worthless." said Arthur Davis, an
analyst with Prescott. Ball and
Turben. "He's just holding on to his
old car longer."
Davis was among the most
pessimistic of a half-dozen analysts in
terviewed by the Los Angeles Times
for their assessment of the industry's
chances of recovery this year. They
varied somewhat in their forecasts,
but all generally agreed that the auto
makers would have a better year in
1981 than they did in 1980
Economists regard the auto in
dustry as a main engine of the U.S.
economy, for one out of every seven of
the nation's jobs are in some way re
lated to vehicle manufacturing Ups
and downs in car sales have tradi

tionallv led to ups and downs in eco
nomic conditions, and the struggles of
the auto industry over the past year
have been closely watched by policy
makers worried about the health of
the general economy.
Total domestic and import car sales
in 1980 were just under 9 million The
average of the sales forecasts of the
six analysts for 1981 is 9.9 million,
ranging from a low of 9.5 million to a
high of 10.75 million
High predictions
General Motors Corp. and Ford Mo
tor Co. have each officially predicted
10 million sales for 1981 The Depart
ment of Commerce is forecasting 9.7
million And Chase Econometrics, the
economic forecasting arm of Chase
Manhattan Bank, has estimated 1981
sales at 9 2 million
Sandra Shaber. a senior economist
at Chase, thinks that poor economic
conditions early in the year will under
mine a quick recovery by the industry
and mute any stimulus that could be
expected from the introduction of new
models in the spring
"I'd like to be more optimistic
about it. but all the factors point
against any pickup in sales." Shaber
said, adding that Chase sees continued
high interest rates, continued inflation
and higher unemployment in the first
few months of the year.
At the other end of the spectrum is
David Healy of the Wall Street firm of
Drexel Burnham Lambert, who fore
sees 1981 sales of 10.75 million.
' But we'll need a steep decline in in
terest rates plus no new recession to
reach that." Healy said. "I think car
sales are probably about 2 million to 3
million off trend now and we'll get
back to normal in 1981 But if the econ
omy is sluggish, then the9.s-million to
10-million guvs might be right."
Reduced losses
A pickup in sales would allow the
auto makers to spread their fixed ov
erhead costs across a broader sales
base, reducing the losses they had in
1980 GM is expected to announce a
loss for last year of about $850 million,
its first deficit in 61 years. With the
final figures due in a few weeks.
Ford's deficit will probably total $1.5
billion, analysts believe, and Chrysler
is expected to lose $1 7 billion
However, most analysts think GM
will return to profitability for all of
1981. with estimated total earnings of
over $1 billion. Ford is expected to
break even for the year, while
Chrysler's losses will continue.

analysts say.
"Chrysler's situation is quite
tenuous and fragile.'' said David Ei
senberg of Sanford C. Bernstein and
Co. "They've got to get those loan
guarantees to survive."
Eisenberg and others expect import
sales in 1981 to remain at about their
record levels of 1980 However, since
they expect domestic sales to in
crease. they forecast that the import
share of total sales will drop to 24
percent in 1981 from last year's 26.6
percent.
And the analysts agree that a re
newed rise in interest rates or further
decline in consumer confidence about
the economy could again short-circuit
an industry recovery.
