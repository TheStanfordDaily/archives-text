treme leftist guerrillas did all
they could do to make this their
final offensive and they have
failed." junta President Jose

their "final offensive" in week
end broadcasts from several
commandeered radio stations
and urged the public to support
them by joining in a general
strike today.
One "Radio Liberation"
broadcast said the guerrillas
controlled at least 10 places
around the country.
New army promised
The Revolutionay Democrat
ic Front, an umbrella drganiza
tion representing most of the na
tion's largest leftist groups,
said a provisional government
and a "new army" would be es
tablished but did not say when
or where.

ly vowed to topple the junta
before the inauguration Jan. 20
of President-elect Ronald Rea
gan. who the leftists believe
may provide the government
with additional arms and aid to
fight them The leftists have
promised "final offensives" in
the past but there has been little

or no difference from the day
to-day political violence that
took an estimated 9500 lives last
year.
Pockets of resistance
While claiming to control vir
tually all of the country, the gov
ernment admitted its troops
were still battling "a few small
pockets" of guerrilla re
sistance.
It proclaimed martial law
and ordered a curfew from 7
pm. to 5 a m throughout the
country.
The dead reported Sunday in
cluded at least 40 in Santa Ana.
about 40 miles west of San
Salvador: more than 25 in the
capital, at least 20 in
Tonacatepeque, 20 miles north
of San Salvador; at least eight
others in the northern town of
Chalatenango and several along
the highway between San
Salvador and Santa Ana.
One of the sharpest ex
changes in the capital occurred
in the slum district of Me
jicanos. where some of the guer
rillas arrived in commandeered
public buses. Government
troops drove them out after sev
eral hours of shooting.
The normally bustling city of
Santa Ana was like a ghost town
Sunday, with the wide, sun
baked streets nearly empty.
Some residents peered nervous
ly through their windows at sol
diers with weapons at the ready,
prowling the streets.
Two Associated Press re
porters who entered the city, un
aware of a general curfew im
posed there minutes earlier,
were relieved of their film at
gunpoint bv army troops and
told they would be killed if they
were not out of town in 10
minutes. Thev left.
