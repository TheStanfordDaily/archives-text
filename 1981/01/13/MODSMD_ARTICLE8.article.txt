# Kirkpatrick to shun PLO in UN
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Dr Jeane Kirkpatrick. am
bassador-designate to the United Nations, pre
dicted Wednesday that President-elect Ronald
Reagan will keep his campaign commitment to
withhold recognition from the Palestine Liber
ation Organization. She also pledged to shun the
guerrilla group at the United Nations.
Kirkpatrick spoke to a meeting of the B'nai
B'rith. the international Jewish service organiza
tion. She was applauded when the organization's
president Jack Spitzer introduced her as someone
"determined that neither America nor America's
allies are going to be pushed around anymore."
She cautioned that she could not speak for the
new administration because it has not made "fun
damental decisions" about foreign policy. But she
assured a questioner that she believes that Rea
gan will stick to his campaign position and refuse
to recognize the PLO.
Asked if she would deal "formally or informal
ly" with the Palestinians at the United Nations,
Kirkpatrick said she would adhere to government
policy.
Andrew Young. President Jimmy Carter's am
bassador to the United Nations, resigned in 1979
after a secret meeting he had with a PLO repre
sentative was disclosed. Despite Young's de
parture, U.S. Jewish organizations largely
deserted the Carter administration in last No

vember's election, in part because of what they
believed was its willingness to negotiate with the
PLO.
The audience applauded strongly when, asked
how she would act differently from her predeces
sors. Kirkpatrick said she hoped to "represent the
policies of the Reagan administration as I antici
pate they will be, as well as Andrew Young and
Don McHenrv (the present envoy) have repre
sented the policies of the Carter administration."
The Kirkpatrick appointment aroused some
controversy in liberal circles because as a pro
fessor of political science at Georgetown Univer
sity here she wrote articles criticizing Carter's
policy in Latin America, declaring that the United
States must sometimes side with "moderately re
pressive" regimes against their radical leftist op
ponents. She denied having put the Nicaraguan
dictatorship of the late Anastasio Somoza in the
first category, but told a B'Nai B'rith questioner:
"I did call Somoza a traditional autocrat; the
Shah of Iran was another. Some of these are im
portant to us. I think we'd like to see the auto
cracies liberalized but if it's a choice between a
moderately repressive government friendly to
the United States and a Soviet-Cuban-backed
movement dedicated to imposing a much more re
pressive regime on a people, if there are only two
alternatives, we should choose the former."
