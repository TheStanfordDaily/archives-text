I Varian Defines
I High Technology
Over 30 years aso, a group of Stanford faculty members got together
to build a new enterprise dedicated to research in the physical scien
ces. Their purpose was to develop new technologies for the future of
science and industry. Today the results of their efforts are referred to as
"high technology," and their enterprise has become a thriving Fortune
500 electronics company called Varian Associates.
Scientists and engineers at Varian are continually striving to elevate high
technology as they develop new and innovative ideas in photovoltaic
solar cell research, electron tubes and their solid state equivalents,
medical therapy and diagnostic equipment, vacuum systems for semi
conductor production, analytical instruments, and more.
BS, MS and PhD graduates in Solid State or Microwave Physics, in Elec
trical, Mechanical or Industrial Engineering, and in Materials Science will
find challenging opportunities to raise the level of high technology at
Varian. If you are a Senior or graduate student in one of these fields
and are eager to pursue a career in association with one of the origina
tors of high technology, contact the Career Planning and Placement
Center for an interview with Varian.

I Monday, January 19
At Varian, you'll find a working environment not unlike the one you
have at Stanford, where professionals work together in project groups
that still emulate the Stanford ideal of scientific investigation. And you'll
find ample opportunity to continue your education through the Stan
ford Honors Co-op Program and with 100% educational
reimbursement.
If Monday, January 19 is inconvenient for you to meet with a Varian
representative, you can learn more about Varian by contacting the
