# Art and industry: laser uses
## 
### Jennifer Seymour 
Working in Stanford's Var
um Laboratories is one phys
icist who is famous for doing
something few ever will: he
created a solution before
having a problem
That man is Professor
Arthur Schawlow. and his
brainchild is the laser.
Ironically, the laser has
proven one of the most ver
satile "solutions" of this era.
Applications include every
thing from detached retinas
to designer jeans.
This is because lasers can
burn through almost any sub
stance with great precision.
When Ford wants to cut out
gears. F'lavtex wants to drill
holes in babv-bottle nipples,
or engineers need a perfectly
straight line for siting, they
all look to the laser.
Lasers have been the most
enlightening in medical pro
cedures. Detached retinas,
once leading to blindness,
are now easily attached by
shooting a pin-point laser
beam through the pupil. The
laser's heat creates a tiny
"tack" of scar tissue which
pins the retina to the back of
the eye.
Clothiers make use of
Schawlow's answer too:
Ruby lasers can cut through
'20-30 layers of fabric, actual
ly vaporizing the material, to
produce as many identical
cuts and sizes as fickle fash
ion-setters desire.
Even oysters feel the ef
fects of these power beams:
the eternal dilemma of
prying open oyster shells is
now easily resolved with a
carbon dioxide laser beam
zap. It triggers a muscle con
traction which makes the

oyster snap open
More scientific applica
tions involve controlling
chemical reactions and de
termining molecular struc
tures. This field, spec
troscopy. was pioneered bv
Schawlow. along with
Charles Townes. Co-inventor
of the laser. Spectroscopy is
now Schawlow's research
focus.
These sorts of operations
are performed with highly
refined ruby or carbon diox
ide lasers. But the harmless
helium-neon laser may soon
be a standard appliance, as a
classroom pointer for teach
ers. a straight-edge for
draftsmen, a pure ray of
monochromatic light for ar
tists. even a stereo needle
that won't scratch for
audiophiles.
All breeds of this light
creature are generated by
the same general process.
Writes Schawlow. "A typical
laser consists of a long col
umn terminated by small
mirrors at each end which
face each other. One of the
mirrors is only partially re
flecting to permit passage of
the laser beam ... If an atom
is stimulated to emit light of
a certain wavelength which
travels the length of the laser
column, the light wave will
stimulate other excited at
oms to radiate and will be
come amplified."
Schawlow. after col
laborating with fellow laser
father Townes, published the
first report on how. theo
retically. one such light
amplifier could be made in
Physical Review, in Decem
ber, 1958.
"We really had no special

applications in mind for this
laser at the time. The idea of
somehow building a
heat light beam was just an
age-old dream for scien
tists.' recalls Schawlow.
This realization led to
cries of horror as well as de
light: lasers were im
mediately dubbed "death
rays" by many.
And such fears were not
completely unfounded.
Schawlow's countenance
darkens considerably over
the issue of lasers-in-nuclear
power: "That's the one thing
I won't work on. So far, it
isn't easy or cheap. If they
figure out how to do it easily,
then nuclear bombs will be
just as easy, I'm afraid."
"It" refers to the process
of separating Uranium-235
from Uranium-238. U-235 is
the isotope used in fission re
actions which generate nu
clear power and bombs. Re
searchers are currently at
tempting to separate the two
using laser beams.
If U-235 could be extracted
easily and inexpensively, nu
clear power would be made
much more efficient â€” and
much more accessible.
This aside. Schawlow
glows with optimism con
sidering future laser applica
tions: "There's chemical re
actions, and tele
communication, and. in the
far future, fusion, for a few
examples.
"At first they said it was
an answer looking for prob
lems. Now. there's so many
applications," says
Schawlow. "But even this is
still onlv a hint."
