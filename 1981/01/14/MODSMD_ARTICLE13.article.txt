## Matt O'Connor Politics and the environment 
### 
Environmentalists are deeply
concerned about the Reagan ad
ministration's attitudes regard
ing energy and environmental
safeguards. Reagan advocates
accelerated production of
energy from domestic sources.
Towards this end. he plans to re
duce environmental regulations
that restrict access to oil. natu
ral gas and coal on federal
lands. Reagan also advocates
decontrol of oil and natural gas
prices in the belief that higher
prices will encourage the
energy industry to tap currently
noneconomic sources.
Such policies evoke night
marish images in the minds of
many environmentalists: the
energy industry operating un
inhibited on public lands. Of
particular concern are the
Rocky Mountain states, widely
undeveloped and among the
most spectacular in the nation,
which possess large fossil
energy resources.
Non-environmentalists argue
for the rapid development of
these resources. Imported oil is
increasingly expensive; our de
pendence on it is largely respon
sible for our economic woes.
The rapid development of
domestic fossil energy reserves
would certainly pump up the
economy, diverting dollars that
might otherwise go overseas
back into the U.S. Further, the
availability of oil from the
Middle East is increasingly
tenuous and reliance on this
source is a threat to national se
curity.
Opponents of Reagan's plans
to accelerate development of
domestic reserves argue that
conservation is the most inex

pensive energy resource avail
able and can provide for most of
our growing demand A crash
conservation program might
also serve to invigorate the
economy, as well as main
taining domestic energy re
serves. Conservation could be
an interim energy source, span
ning the gap between the era of
fossil fuels and the era of re
newable energy sources.
Surprisingly, there may be
some reconciliation between
these opposing viewpoints. Al
though Reagan conspicuously
ignores conservation as an
energy resource, his desire to
decontrol oil and gas prices is
substantially pro-conservation.
Significant increases in energy
prices will surely reduce con
sumption and enhance alternate
energy sources.
Nevertheless, environmen
talists have much to feel uneasy
about, especially in the wake of
the appointment of environmen
tal arch-villain James Watt as
secretary of the interior. Signif
icant degradation of the land via
the extraction of resources is
very likely in the coming dec
ades. Although the Reagan ad
ministration may accelerate
this process, one must be
cautious in assigning blame.
The preservation of land and
the conservation of resources
conflict fundamentally with a
constantly expanding economy
and an affluent consumer socie
ty. As long as the desirability of
economic growth is un
challenged. we must be pre
pared to endure ever-escalating
exploitation of land and natural

resources Reagan hopes to
stimulate growth, enlarge the
economic "pie." and thus
enable more people to achieve
the American dream of af
fluence In this view the effects
on the land are of minor con
cern.
But will Reagan's plans bene
fit the public" 7 One may argue
that his energy and environmen
tal policies will most strongly
benefit the energy industry,
with little thought for the
energy future of the U.S. Rea
gan also advocates a redressing
of state's rights, claiming that
the federal government wrong
fully controls vast amounts of
lands in western states (supp
portive of the "sagebrush re
bellion").
Environmentalists argue that
turning over federal lands to the
states makes them vulnerable
to exploitation on the grounds
that state governments haven't
the resources and or inclination
to adequately regulate land use.
That is, states may be unable to
effectively countervail the po
litical and economic power of
big business. The question
raised is whether Reagan truly
hopes to improve the economic
fortunes of the public at large.
Does he hope to return federal
ly-owned land to the states for
their benefit? Or are these
rhetorical disguises masking
actions that are designed to ben
efit high-level economic in
terests?

Environmentalists are deeply
concerned about the Reagan ad
ministration's attitudes regard
ing energy and environmental
safeguards. Reagan advocates
accelerated production of
energy from domestic sources.
Towards this end. he plans to re
duce environmental regulations
that restrict access to oil. natu
ral gas and coal on federal
lands. Reagan also advocates
decontrol of oil and natural gas
prices in the belief that higher
prices will encourage the
energy industry to tap currently
noneconomic sources.
Such policies evoke night
marish images in the minds of
many environmentalists: the
energy industry operating un
inhibited on public lands. Of
particular concern are the
Rocky Mountain states, widely
undeveloped and among the
most spectacular in the nation,
which possess large fossil
energy resources.
Non-environmentalists argue
for the rapid development of
these resources. Imported oil is
increasingly expensive; our de
pendence on it is largely respon
sible for our economic woes.
The rapid development of
domestic fossil energy reserves
would certainly pump up the
economy, diverting dollars that
might otherwise go overseas
back into the U.S. Further, the
availability of oil from the
Middle East is increasingly
tenuous and reliance on this
source is a threat to national se
curity.
Opponents of Reagan's plans
to accelerate development of
domestic reserves argue that
conservation is the most inex

pensive energy resource avail
able and can provide for most of
our growing demand A crash
conservation program might
also serve to invigorate the
economy, as well as main
taining domestic energy re
serves. Conservation could be
an interim energy source, span
ning the gap between the era of
fossil fuels and the era of re
newable energy sources.
Surprisingly, there may be
some reconciliation between
these opposing viewpoints. Al
though Reagan conspicuously
ignores conservation as an
energy resource, his desire to
decontrol oil and gas prices is
substantially pro-conservation.
Significant increases in energy
prices will surely reduce con
sumption and enhance alternate
energy sources.
Nevertheless, environmen
talists have much to feel uneasy
about, especially in the wake of
the appointment of environmen
tal arch-villain James Watt as
secretary of the interior. Signif
icant degradation of the land via
the extraction of resources is
very likely in the coming dec
ades. Although the Reagan ad
ministration may accelerate
this process, one must be
cautious in assigning blame.
The preservation of land and
the conservation of resources
conflict fundamentally with a
constantly expanding economy
and an affluent consumer socie
ty. As long as the desirability of
economic growth is un
challenged. we must be pre
pared to endure ever-escalating
exploitation of land and natural

resources Reagan hopes to
stimulate growth, enlarge the
economic "pie." and thus
enable more people to achieve
the American dream of af
fluence In this view the effects
on the land are of minor con
cern.
But will Reagan's plans bene
fit the public" 7 One may argue
that his energy and environmen
tal policies will most strongly
benefit the energy industry,
with little thought for the
energy future of the U.S. Rea
