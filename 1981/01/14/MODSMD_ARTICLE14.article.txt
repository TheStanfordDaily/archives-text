## Reagan economics a deft illusion 
### 
It is now only a matter of
days until Ronald Reagan's ap
pointed rendezvous with sub
stance. In the meantime, form
and fashion are scheduled to run
riot for the inaugural festivities.
Fireworks, lasers and the
Mormon Tabernacle Choir have
reportedly been engaged to cel
ebrate Reagan's grand entrance
into the White House. There are
even those of us who, judging
from Reagan's campaign prom
ises, have half-expected him to
come in on horseback, naked
and walking on water.
Such a scenario might seem
improbably, but no more so than
Reagan's professed goal to cut
taxes, balance the budget, and
raise defense spending simulta
neously. In either case, mirrors
would be required to sustain the
illusion.
In order to make his economic
policy seem more credible,
Reagan has relied on two argu
ments : that government reven
ues can be increased by de
creasing tax rates, a doctrine
espoused by the conservative
economist Arthur Laffer; and

that enough waste and fraud can
be eliminated from the non-mil
itary federal budget to bridge a
budget defecit that is already
anticipated to be over $60
billion.
Conservative economics
In embracing Lafferism, the
Reaganites have effectively re
pudiated a whole generation of
conservative economists, who
have devoutly insisted on the
importance of a balanced
budget to prevent inflation. In
fact. Rep. Jack Kemp,
eponymous co-author of the
Kemp-Roth tax cut bill, the key
stone of the Reagan program,
confesses to have drawn his in
spiration from the 1962 Kennedy
tax cut. Ironically, the Kennedy
tax cut was engineered by liber
al followers of John Maynard
Keynes, a traditional bete noire
of conservative economists. It
was Keynes' notion that deficit
spending would reduce un
employment by stimulating
consumer demand, a policy that
was attacked by conservatives
as inflationary back in days
when inflation seldom reached 3
percent.

Now. with double-digit infla
tion raging, Lafferite con
servatives carefully dis
associate themselves from Key
nesianism by insisting that their
rationale for tax cuts is to stim
ulate productivity, not demand.
The theory here is that the more
earnings are taxed, the less in
centive there is to work; hence
people are not so productive.
Reduction in taxes
Naturally, it is the upper in
come brackets that are the most
severely affected, since they
pay the most taxes. Therefore,
they are accorded propor
tionately more benefits under
Kemp-Roth, which as a three
year. 30 percent reduction in in
come tax rates,translates into a
70 percent raise for those in the
uppermost income bracket. No
doubt this will stimulate David
Rockefeller to apply himself
more productively and put in
more time at the bank, the pro
digious benefit of all mankind.
But what of those poor mis
fortunates who do not pay any
income tax. and so receive noth
ing at all from Kemp-Roth?
Fortunately, they are included
in the second item on Reagan's
budgetary agenda, namely the
elimination of waste and fraud.
According to reports from the
Reagan transition team, the
problem is especially severe in
such programs as food stamps,
social security, and unemploy
ment insurance. Presumably,
by reducing such incentives to
poverty, as well as increasing
those to wealth, productivity
can be even further enhanced.
Skeptics
Of course, skeptics might

wonder whether some more
direct approach might be more
effective in enhancing prod
uctivity. Indeed, many econo
mists have suggested that tax
cuts should be specifically
targeted to encourage personal
savings, capital investment,
and research and development.
Others have suggested that
the bulk of waste and fraud oc
curs not in payments to the
poor, but rather in such pro
grams as agricultural subsidies,
small business loans, urban de
velopment grants, and various
institutional bailouts — not to
mention defense. Finally, a few
liberals have gone so far as to
suggest that tax cuts be de
signed with greater attention to
the needs of those in the lowest
brackets.
But all of this quibbling over
loks one tremendous advantage
of Kemp-Roth. Just think of how
much more productive Reagan
will be if it passes. Given the in
centive of a higher effective
salary, maybe he will expand
his office hours from 9 to 5 to.
say, 8:30 to 5:30.
Come to think of it, though,
the President isn't paid by the
hour. But in any case, he and
Nancy will have a little extra
money to invest in the prod
uctivity of the White House.
Perhaps they can throw a" First
Inaugural Anniversary Party"
to help us celebrate the ban
ishment of waste and fraud
from government.

It is now only a matter of

that enough waste and fraud can
be eliminated from the non-mil
itary federal budget to bridge a
budget defecit that is already
anticipated to be over $60
billion.
Conservative economics
In embracing Lafferism, the
Reaganites have effectively re
pudiated a whole generation of
conservative economists, who
have devoutly insisted on the
importance of a balanced
budget to prevent inflation. In
fact. Rep. Jack Kemp,
eponymous co-author of the
Kemp-Roth tax cut bill, the key
stone of the Reagan program,
confesses to have drawn his in
spiration from the 1962 Kennedy
tax cut. Ironically, the Kennedy
tax cut was engineered by liber
al followers of John Maynard
Keynes, a traditional bete noire
of conservative economists. It
was Keynes' notion that deficit
spending would reduce un
employment by stimulating
consumer demand, a policy that
was attacked by conservatives
as inflationary back in days
when inflation seldom reached 3
percent.

Now. with double-digit infla
tion raging, Lafferite con
servatives carefully dis
associate themselves from Key
nesianism by insisting that their
rationale for tax cuts is to stim
ulate productivity, not demand.
The theory here is that the more
earnings are taxed, the less in
centive there is to work; hence
people are not so productive.
Reduction in taxes
Naturally, it is the upper in
come brackets that are the most
severely affected, since they
pay the most taxes. Therefore,
they are accorded propor
tionately more benefits under
Kemp-Roth, which as a three
year. 30 percent reduction in in
come tax rates,translates into a
70 percent raise for those in the
uppermost income bracket. No
doubt this will stimulate David
Rockefeller to apply himself
more productively and put in
more time at the bank, the pro
digious benefit of all mankind.
But what of those poor mis
fortunates who do not pay any
income tax. and so receive noth
ing at all from Kemp-Roth?
Fortunately, they are included
in the second item on Reagan's
budgetary agenda, namely the
elimination of waste and fraud.
According to reports from the
Reagan transition team, the
problem is especially severe in
such programs as food stamps,
social security, and unemploy
ment insurance. Presumably,
by reducing such incentives to
poverty, as well as increasing
those to wealth, productivity
can be even further enhanced.
Skeptics
Of course, skeptics might

wonder whether some more
direct approach might be more
effective in enhancing prod
uctivity. Indeed, many econo
mists have suggested that tax
cuts should be specifically
targeted to encourage personal
savings, capital investment,
and research and development.
Others have suggested that
the bulk of waste and fraud oc
curs not in payments to the
poor, but rather in such pro
grams as agricultural subsidies,
small business loans, urban de
velopment grants, and various
