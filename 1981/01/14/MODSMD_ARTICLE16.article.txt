## Mass media's negative influence 
### 
Within the United States to
day. there exists a powerful
force with great potential for
overcoming many of our major
national problems: the mass
media. The average American
citizen is daily exposed to hours
of radio, television, newspapers
and magazines which numerous
studies have shown to carry sig
nificant impact upon the behav
ior and thoughts of the individ
ual.
Unfortunately, instead of
working to our benefit as a uni
fying force which contributes to
mutual understanding in a soci
ety of diverse lifestyles, the me
dia has. in recent years, become
an increasingly negative in
fluence to our national integri
ty.

The daily news, whether con
veyed bv television, radio, or
newspaper, is a plethora of
stories describing human trag
edy. Time and space priority is
given to such events as the
slaying of John Lennon. the
Mount Tamalpais murders,
arson and bomb threats in Ne
vada casinos, and continuing ov
erseas conflicts. The keen lis
tener may perceive brief men
tion of an act of public service, a
new scientific discovery, or oth
er item of positive impact,
buried within all the sensation
alism of death and destruction.
Regardless of the often-heard
argument that the public actual
ly prefers tragic news, we as a
society need to recognize the
detrimental influence which the
current media format has upon
our psychology. Hardly a month
goes by without a lead story con
cerning vet another prediction
of the imminence of California's
tragic earthquake.
While in fact geologists do not
know when or even if such an
event will occur, gullible
citizens carry an eternal burden
of fear. A similar recent media
stunt was the broadcast of a one
hour special entitled "First
Strike." a television version of
the early hours of a global nucle
ar war. The viewer comes away
from such a program with feel
ings of inevitable expectation
and perhaps regards his own
future with less concern.
The media handling of our
current national economic woes
is also subject to harsh
criticism. The familiar depress
ing price, interest rate, and un
employment figures are re
peatedly emphasized, but the
viewer'is given little direction
regarding his individual role in
helping to alleviate the situ
ation. More importantly, this
approach is destructive to indi
vidual confidence in govern
ment, national spirit, and op
timism for the future. Prac
tically speaking, the American
public is being demotivated and
stripped of its work ethic at a
time when such entities are vi
tal.
As previously mentioned, the
media is fond of reporting crim
inal acts, ranging from robbery
and murder to rape and arson.
Crimes such as these are
motivated not so much by mon
ey or passion as the need for at
tention by a delinquent or de
ranged idividual. It is entirely
conceivable that a number of
these crimes would not occur
without the incentive of public
attention and recognition cur
rently afforded by the mass me
dia.
One particular tragic and in
nocent victim of the mass media
is the American child. While

educational and cultural tele
vision programs do exist, they
are scattered intermittently be
tween violent cartoons, junk
food and sugar-coated breakfast
cereal commercials, and fic
tional dramas emphasizing, but
not adequately criticizing, the
adolescent problems of sex,
drugs, and alcoholism. Clearly,
if utilized sensibly and effec
tively, the media could be a
powerful tool toward shaping
constructive and meaningful
lives for American youth.
With regard to "adult" tele
vision, it is shameful but true
that the most informative and
interesting station on the air in
most American cities is public
supported. Thos6 whose income
results primarily from the ad
vertising of business-hungry
manufacturers broadcast a
number of weekly programs
which are insults to the in
telligence of the viewing public.
Even the ever-popular "60
Minutes." the mission of which
is to seek out and expose hidden
corruption, suffers in that it de
stroys rather than creates pub
lic confidence in the institutions
of our country.

The solution to the current
misuse of the American mass
media lies in realizing and ap
plying its potential for resolv
ing. rather than magnifying, so
cial problems. Programs and
news Stories which emphasize
benevolent public service and
individual achievement should
replace those describing crime
and corruption. The alternative
lifestyles of minorities and re
cent immigrants should be ex
plored to create greater social
understanding. Children should
be taught appropriate social be
havior. good health habits, and
constructive skills through their
entertainment. Adult programs
which motivate, inspire, and
kindle good will and optimism
are essential in a nation with
dwindling confidence in itself.
It would be a refreshing and
invigorating change to receive,
instead of a frown and "that's
the way it is," a smile and
"that's the way it should be"
from the living symbol of the
American press.

citizens carry an eternal burden
of fear. A similar recent media
stunt was the broadcast of a one
hour special entitled "First
Strike." a television version of
the early hours of a global nucle
ar war. The viewer comes away
from such a program with feel
ings of inevitable expectation
and perhaps regards his own
future with less concern.
The media handling of our
current national economic woes
is also subject to harsh
criticism. The familiar depress
ing price, interest rate, and un
employment figures are re
peatedly emphasized, but the
viewer'is given little direction
regarding his individual role in
helping to alleviate the situ
ation. More importantly, this
approach is destructive to indi
vidual confidence in govern
ment, national spirit, and op
timism for the future. Prac
tically speaking, the American
public is being demotivated and
stripped of its work ethic at a
time when such entities are vi
tal.
As previously mentioned, the
media is fond of reporting crim
inal acts, ranging from robbery
and murder to rape and arson.
Crimes such as these are
motivated not so much by mon
ey or passion as the need for at
tention by a delinquent or de
ranged idividual. It is entirely
conceivable that a number of
these crimes would not occur
without the incentive of public
attention and recognition cur
rently afforded by the mass me
dia.
One particular tragic and in
nocent victim of the mass media
is the American child. While

educational and cultural tele
vision programs do exist, they
are scattered intermittently be
tween violent cartoons, junk
food and sugar-coated breakfast
cereal commercials, and fic
tional dramas emphasizing, but
not adequately criticizing, the
adolescent problems of sex,
drugs, and alcoholism. Clearly,
if utilized sensibly and effec
tively, the media could be a
powerful tool toward shaping
constructive and meaningful
lives for American youth.
With regard to "adult" tele
vision, it is shameful but true
that the most informative and
interesting station on the air in
most American cities is public
supported. Thos6 whose income
results primarily from the ad
vertising of business-hungry
manufacturers broadcast a
number of weekly programs
which are insults to the in
telligence of the viewing public.
Even the ever-popular "60
Minutes." the mission of which
is to seek out and expose hidden
corruption, suffers in that it de
stroys rather than creates pub
lic confidence in the institutions
of our country.

The solution to the current
misuse of the American mass
media lies in realizing and ap
plying its potential for resolv
ing. rather than magnifying, so
cial problems. Programs and
news Stories which emphasize
benevolent public service and
individual achievement should
replace those describing crime
and corruption. The alternative
lifestyles of minorities and re
cent immigrants should be ex
plored to create greater social
understanding. Children should
be taught appropriate social be
havior. good health habits, and
constructive skills through their
entertainment. Adult programs
which motivate, inspire, and
kindle good will and optimism
are essential in a nation with
dwindling confidence in itself.
It would be a refreshing and
invigorating change to receive,
instead of a frown and "that's
the way it is," a smile and
"that's the way it should be"
from the living symbol of the
American press.

Within the United States to
day. there exists a powerful
force with great potential for
overcoming many of our major
national problems: the mass
media. The average American
citizen is daily exposed to hours
of radio, television, newspapers
and magazines which numerous
studies have shown to carry sig
nificant impact upon the behav
ior and thoughts of the individ
ual.
Unfortunately, instead of
working to our benefit as a uni
fying force which contributes to
mutual understanding in a soci
ety of diverse lifestyles, the me
dia has. in recent years, become
an increasingly negative in
fluence to our national integri
ty.

The daily news, whether con
veyed bv television, radio, or
newspaper, is a plethora of
stories describing human trag
edy. Time and space priority is
given to such events as the
slaying of John Lennon. the
Mount Tamalpais murders,
arson and bomb threats in Ne
vada casinos, and continuing ov
erseas conflicts. The keen lis
tener may perceive brief men
tion of an act of public service, a
new scientific discovery, or oth
er item of positive impact,
buried within all the sensation
alism of death and destruction.
Regardless of the often-heard
argument that the public actual
ly prefers tragic news, we as a
society need to recognize the
detrimental influence which the
current media format has upon
our psychology. Hardly a month
goes by without a lead story con
cerning vet another prediction
of the imminence of California's
tragic earthquake.

know when or even if such an
event will occur, gullible
citizens carry an eternal burden
of fear. A similar recent media
