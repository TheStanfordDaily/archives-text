## Small farms need protection 
### 
Washington (AP) — It will be "only a few
years" before U.S. food production will be con
centrated among a handful of superfarms un
less steps are taken at once to change and fine
tune federal farm policy, says a report re
leased today.
The report. "A Time to Choose," was pre
pared by the Agriculture Department after ex
haustive research.
"It seems fairly certain that the future eco
nomic climate, combined with a continuation
of current policies and programs, will continue
and even accelerate the shift to large and su
per-large farms," the report states.
"Therefore, unless present policies and pro
grams are changed so that they counter, in
stead of reinforce and accelerate the trends
towards ever-larger farming operations, the
result will be a few large farms controlling
food production in only a few years.
"This does not mean that present policies
and the programs derived from them should be
summarily abandoned. It does mean that they
should be modified."
Susan Sechler. project coordinator, said the
study showed concentration of agricultural
production in the hands of a relatively few big
operators has been going on faster than had
been thought previously.

Asked what the report meant by "only a few
years" before production is concentrated
among the superfarms. Ms. Sechler said there
is no precise timetable. But she said 10 to 15
years is a fair estimate.
Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland said
Monday in an interview that the report "is are
search document" that has been intended as a
policy guide if President Jimmy Carter had
been re-elected.
The report — actually a 210-page summary
of a much larger work that will be released lat
er in stages — said federal programs "de
signed to protect today's farmers from the eco
nomic and natural disasters that remain as
threats are justified and must be maintained."
But those programs "that seek to guarantee
market prices or incomes in excess of those
needed by fully efficient producers will only
lead to a nation of large and super-large farms
and further the demise of farming com
munities."
Using 1978 figures, the report said large
farms — those with sales of more than $200,000
in products annually — totaled about 64.000 or
2.4 percent of the 2.67 million total farm units.
But those large farms accounted for $46.3
billion, or 39.4 percent of the $117.4 billion
gross sales.
