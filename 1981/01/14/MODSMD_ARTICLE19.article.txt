# Court finds sex harassment illegal
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” A federal appeals court
here ruled Monday that a woman can sue
her employer to stop sexual harassment on
the job without having to prove she resisted
the harassment and that as a result of the re
sistance she lost job benefits.
The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals
in Washington, reached in a case brought by
a woman employed by the D.C. Department
of Corrections, was viewed by legal ob
servers Monday as an important extention
of the protections against sex discrimina
tion that have been set out in the nation's
civil rights laws.
The ruling in effect holds that sexual
harassment, in and of itself, is a violation of
the law and does not require further proof
that the employee was penalized or lost spe
cific job benefits.
Chief Judge Skelly Wright, in an unani
mous opinion for the court, wrote that un
less the court reached out to prohibit em
ployers from maintaining a "dis
criminatory environment," the employers
could "sexually harass a female employee
with impunity by carefully stopping short of
firing the employee or taking any other tan
gible actions against her in response to her

resistance
In an unusual move, the court included a
proposed order for the trial judge who ori
ginally heard the discrimination case, spe
cifically telling Corrections Department di
rector Delbert Jackson in detail what steps
his department should take to ensure that
sexual harassment complaints get thorough
and effective treatment.
Standard procedure'
In April 1979. Senior U.S. District Court
.Judge George Hart, the trial judge in-the
case, found that "the making of improper
sexual advances to female employees (was)
standard operating procedure, a fact of life,
a normal condition of employment" in the
corrections department. Hart also found
that department director Jackson had failed
either to investigate or to take seriously
complaints about sexual harassment on the
job.
Barry Gottfried, an attorney represent
ing the employee, described the court de
cision as an "important victory" which
should "also be a message to employers
that this kind of (harassment) won't be to
lerated." The D.C. Corporation Counsel's
office, which represented the corrections
department, may ask the three-judge panel
to reconsider the case or ask the full 11-

member court to review it.
As the law stands now. Wright wrote Mon
day. a woman must prove that her re
sistance to sexual harassment "cost her her
job or some economic benefit, but this will
do her no good if her employer never takes
such tangible action against her.
Inferiors
"Indeed, so long as women remain in
feriors in the employment hierarchy, they
may have little recourse against harass
ment." beyond getting a court order to stop
such illegal activity, Wright said.
The judge noted that other "dis
criminatory environment" cases involving
racial and ethnic discrimination have been
found to violate civil rights law "in poison
ing the atmosphere of employment . .."
"How then can sexual harassment, which
injects the most demeaning sexual stere
otypes into the general work environment
and which always represents an intentional
assault on an individual's innermost
privacy, not be illegal?" Wright asked in his
written opinion. Wright was joined in his de
cision by Washington Ciivuuit Judge Spot
tswood Robinson and Judge Luther Swygert
of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, who sat
on the case by special designation.
