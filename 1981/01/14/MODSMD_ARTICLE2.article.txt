# Progress seen in installment plan for release of hostages
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — United States nego
tiators reported further progress yes
terday toward a deal with Iran to bring
about release of the 52 American
hostages, with money still the im
me<iiatf> obrtacle to agreement.
As another day ticked by toward
Friday, which the Carter adminis
tration has described as the last
chance for acceptance of an arrange
ment that could be implemented
before it leaves office, Deputy Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher is
sued a public note of caution against
optimism "because fundamental dif
ferences remain to be resolved."
Christopher, who was meeting in
Algiers with the authorized Algerian
intermediaries, also sent back word to
Washington, as reported by State De
partment spokesman John Trattner,
that "progress continues to be made
on several aspects of the highly com
plex issues."
Informed sources said the Carter
administration has provided Iran with
additional details of its final offer,
which calls for $7.3 billion in Iranian
assets to be released to Tehran at the
time the hostages are freed, and an
other $2.2 billion in Iranian assets to
be provided later under a claims set
tlement arrangement.
Timetable unclear
It is unclear whether Iran will agree
to this timetable for return of its mon
ey, which was frozen by White House
order following the seizure of the
Americans more than 14 months ago.
The U.S. argument is that Iran would
be better off to take what it can, as
quickly as it can, under this formula
than to hold on to the hostages in vague
and probably forlorn hopes of a more
acceptable accommodation in the
Reagan administration.
The United States is reported to be
working, through the Algerian in
termediaries, on details of a three
way American-Algerian-Iranian ex
ecutive agreement to be implemented
this week governing the release of the
hostages and the return of Iranian
funds. Iran's reluctance to sign a docu
ment with the "Great Satan," as the
United States is called in Tehran, may
be overcome by such ingenious legal
isms as the signing of three separate

pieces of paper in the three capitals.
Negotiating authority
In this perspective, the decision by
Iranian leaders to seek additional ne
gotiating authority from the Majlis, or
Parliament, was seen here as a sign of
seriousness of purpose. But the post
ponement of the Majlis deliberations
Tuesday, because some essential of
ficials were absent, touched off new
concern in Washington.
It was not known whether the
absences reflected an attempt by
some Iranian factions to torpedo an
agreement. With the Friday deadline
just ahead, however, some who were
already wary downgraded their esti
mates of the likelihood of immediate
success.
State Department officials also
noted that Iranian revolutionary lead
er Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has
yet to endorse acceptance of the
American proposals, though his en
dorsement probably will be necessary
for final approval by the Iranian body
politic. Khomeini was an insurmoun
table obstacle to release of the
hostages on U.S. terms in earlier se
quences.
Political will
Should Iran gather its political will
and accept American terms by the
signing of an executive agreement,
the United States would act to move
$7.3 billion in blocked Iranian funds to
the hands of a third country, which
may not be Algeria. This action is like
ly to take several days of legal maneu
vering. The transfer of about $1.8
billion of this sum, from American
banks abroad, would require arrange
ments by Iran to pay smaller debt-ser
vice charges to the banking institu
tions.
Once the sums are in the hands of
the authorized "escrow" holder, the
next step would be release of the 52
Americans, and the simultaneous re
lease to Iran of the money being held
for it.
The Carter administration is mak
ing its maximum effort to bring about
the simultaneous release of the
hostages and the money before relin
quishing the reins of government next
Tuesday. In practical terms, this
would require completion of the de
tailed agreement by Friday.

The Carter administration is mak
ing its maximum effort to bring about
the simultaneous release of the
hostages and the money before relin
quishing the reins of government next
Tuesday. In practical terms, this
would require completion of the de
tailed agreement by Friday.
Washington — United States nego
tiators reported further progress yes
terday toward a deal with Iran to bring
about release of the 52 American
hostages, with money still the im
me<iiatf> obrtacle to agreement.
As another day ticked by toward
Friday, which the Carter adminis
tration has described as the last
chance for acceptance of an arrange
ment that could be implemented
before it leaves office, Deputy Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher is
sued a public note of caution against
optimism "because fundamental dif
ferences remain to be resolved."
Christopher, who was meeting in
Algiers with the authorized Algerian
intermediaries, also sent back word to
Washington, as reported by State De
partment spokesman John Trattner,
that "progress continues to be made
on several aspects of the highly com
plex issues."
Informed sources said the Carter
administration has provided Iran with
additional details of its final offer,
which calls for $7.3 billion in Iranian
assets to be released to Tehran at the
time the hostages are freed, and an
other $2.2 billion in Iranian assets to
be provided later under a claims set
tlement arrangement.
Timetable unclear
It is unclear whether Iran will agree
to this timetable for return of its mon
ey, which was frozen by White House
order following the seizure of the
Americans more than 14 months ago.
The U.S. argument is that Iran would
be better off to take what it can, as
quickly as it can, under this formula
than to hold on to the hostages in vague
and probably forlorn hopes of a more
acceptable accommodation in the
Reagan administration.
The United States is reported to be
working, through the Algerian in
termediaries, on details of a three
way American-Algerian-Iranian ex
ecutive agreement to be implemented
this week governing the release of the
hostages and the return of Iranian
funds. Iran's reluctance to sign a docu
ment with the "Great Satan," as the
United States is called in Tehran, may
be overcome by such ingenious legal
isms as the signing of three separate

pieces of paper in the three capitals.
Negotiating authority
In this perspective, the decision by
Iranian leaders to seek additional ne
gotiating authority from the Majlis, or
Parliament, was seen here as a sign of
seriousness of purpose. But the post
ponement of the Majlis deliberations
Tuesday, because some essential of
ficials were absent, touched off new
concern in Washington.
It was not known whether the
absences reflected an attempt by
some Iranian factions to torpedo an
agreement. With the Friday deadline
just ahead, however, some who were
already wary downgraded their esti
mates of the likelihood of immediate
success.
State Department officials also
noted that Iranian revolutionary lead
er Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has
yet to endorse acceptance of the
American proposals, though his en
dorsement probably will be necessary
for final approval by the Iranian body
politic. Khomeini was an insurmoun
table obstacle to release of the
hostages on U.S. terms in earlier se
quences.
Political will
Should Iran gather its political will
and accept American terms by the
signing of an executive agreement,
the United States would act to move
$7.3 billion in blocked Iranian funds to
the hands of a third country, which
may not be Algeria. This action is like
ly to take several days of legal maneu
vering. The transfer of about $1.8
billion of this sum, from American
banks abroad, would require arrange
ments by Iran to pay smaller debt-ser
vice charges to the banking institu
tions.
Once the sums are in the hands of
the authorized "escrow" holder, the
next step would be release of the 52
Americans, and the simultaneous re
lease to Iran of the money being held
for it.
The Carter administration is mak
ing its maximum effort to bring about
the simultaneous release of the
hostages and the money before relin
quishing the reins of government next
Tuesday. In practical terms, this
would require completion of the de
tailed agreement by Friday.
