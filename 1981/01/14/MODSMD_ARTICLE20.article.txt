# Top Carter officials in big demand

Bv The Washington Cos!
Washington — Twenty-seven
months ago. when he was just
settling into his new job as gen
eral counsel of the Department
of Energy, Lynn Coleman
signed an angry letter to the
Washington DC Bar protesting
a new ethics rule that seemed to
limit the opportunities for fed
eral lawyers to enter private
law practice when they left pub
lic service.
The D C. Bar rules say that a
former government lawyer and
the firm that hires him both
have to refrain from dealing
with any case the lawyer
worked on while in the govern
ment. The letter Coleman and
other senior government law
yers signed said that the D C.
Bar had no right to set em
ployment restrictions for gov
ernment lawyers.
Despite the protest, the ethics
rule went into effect. But law
yers in and out of government
say the rules seem not to have
restricted opportunities for law

yers leaving the Carter adminis
tration. "We think it's obvious
some of these people can be val
uable without violating the
rule.'' said a partner in one local
firm
Next week Coleman will be
leaving public service with the
rest of the Carter adminis
tration. and he says he will re
enter private practice here. Ac
cording to other lawyers in the
energy field. Coleman is nego
tiating with two law firms on
terms that would give him about
a fourfold increase in his
$tiO.OOO-per-year government
salary and provide a guaranteed
job for an assistant he hopes to
bring with him into private
practice.
Coleman is not alone. Among
the hundreds of Carter appoin
tees now job-hunting at the law
firms and lobbyists' offices, a
few dozen federal lawyers have
found that the prestige, know
how and know-who they gained
in the government add up to sen
ior jobs and big money in Wash
ington's legal community.
Big money
Some of the lawyers in de
mand — people like Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale and White
House domestic policy adviser
Stuart Eizenstat — are quite fa

miliar to newspaper readers.
But others hardly known to the
general public have received a
flood of inquiries.
One of the hottest tickets in
Washington right now is
Bernard ( Bobby > Shapiro, a
hard-working and highly re
spected accountant and tax law
yer whose position as chief of
staff of the Joint Committee on
Taxation has made him Con
gress' leading expert on the tax
code Shapiro says he has had "a
lot of phone calls" but hasn't yet
decided which offer to accept.
A lawyer from one of the
firms courting Shapiro says an
offer to him would probably in
clude "a partnership, obviously,
and a guarantee of almost
three " This last is the lawyer's
way of describing a salary close
to $300.(KM) per year.
Other federal lawyers partic
ularly sought after, according to
local lawyers, include .John
Shenefield. who was antitrust
chief and then associate at
torney general in the Carter
.Justice Department, and Philip
Verveer. head of the Federal
Communications Commission
office that regulates telephone
and microwave communica
tions.

Although terms and offers
vary considerably, top govern
ment lawyers can generally
command from two to four
times their government salary
when they enter a law firm as a
partner
The firms consider big-name
government lawyers worth
more than the normal new part
ner for two reasons. Connec
tions and knowledge acquired in
a top federal job can help the
firm's current clients, and a
new partner with political
cachet can help lure new clients
at yearly retainers that can
reach several hundred thousand
dollars.
The lawyer who can bring in
new business is known in the le
gal community as a "rain
maker." and the best rain
makers can just about set their
own terms when they negotiate
with a law firm
One request the sought-after
government officials often
make is for a "package deal" in
which the law firm offers to hire
one or two chosen aides along
with the new partner. The big
name lawyer and the aide can
then both command premium
salaries. As a local lawyer put
it. "you get two for the price of
three."
