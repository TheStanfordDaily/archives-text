Washington (AP) - Transportation Secre
tary Neil Goldschmidt has urged the White
House or Congress to slow the flow of Japanese
autos into the United States to give domestic
carmakers time to regroup, sources said to
day.
A Transportation Department source said
the recommendation came after a new depart
ment report concluded that some form of "im
port restraint" is needed to help domestic
manufacturers.
American automobile manufacturers re
ported record losses, estimated at more than
$4 billion for General Motors, the Ford Motor
Co. and the Chrysler Corp., in 1980 because of
poor sales. Industry leaders have blamed auto
imports, especially from Japan, for much of
their problems.
The incoming Reagan administration has
not said whether it would move against the

Japanese imports, but Transportation Secre
tary-designate Drew Lewis last week said he
considered the plight of the domestic industry
his top transportation problem.
United Auto Workers union president
Douglas Fraser. here for talks with Chrysler,
said today he thought the secretary's recom
mendations "may influence the incoming ad
ministration . . . certainly it's helpful."
But the U.S. International Trade Com
mission last year rejected the industry's de
mands that the government impose trade re
strictions against automobile imports, which
grabbed 26.5 percent of the American market
last year.
The agency said the domestic manufac
turers' problems stemmed not only from the
imports but also from high inflation, the re
cession. high interest rates and mismanage
ment.
