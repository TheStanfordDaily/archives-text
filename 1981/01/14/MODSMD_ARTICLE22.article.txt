The Washington Post
; Miami Beach — The Associa
tion for Intercollegiate Athlet
ics for Women, in spite of a well-
Organized attempt to slow down
the NCAA from taking over
women's athletics, lost each of
its major fights yesterday at the

NCAA convention.
Beginning at 8:15 yesterday
morning and ending at 6:30 last
night, the AIAW lost one vote af
ter another in its attempt to
keep the NCAA from usurping
much of the power it has ac
crued during the last nine years

The other losers yesterday
were small colleges, who had
advocated an amendment that
would have based payment of
room and board expenses for
athletes on financial need The
major football and basketball
powers mustered enough sup
port to defeat that measure.
148-101
But it was the AIAW that suf
fered the worst defeats yester
day. The national governing
body for women's athletics tried
its best to keep the NCAA an all
male organization because the
AIAW felt that women's athlet
ics would take second-class sta
tus to men's sports in the NCAA.
Before the long day was over
the NCAA convention had voted
to include women on its council,
its executive committee and all
its smaller committees It had
also voted in favor uf holding
championships in all divisions
beginning this fall and in favor
of giving new member schools
four years to bring their own
school or conference rules into
compliance with the NCAA.
The key vote was the last one.
The AIAW appeared to have

salvaged a key point when the
convention voted 128-127 against
holding Division 1 cham
pionships this year But on a re
vote. the last of the day. that de
cision was reversed. 137-117.
"This marks the death knell
of the AIAW." one delegate said
moments later "The NCAA has
just taken over, probably for
good."
The women's issues took the
most time, but the most dra
matic fight of the day was over
the financial need question.
A number of other significant
amendments were passed They
included:
— A package of recruiting
proposals put together by the
College Football Association
(CPA) which will increase the
number of allowable contacts
between a college and a high
school athlete from three to six:
will restrict the time period in
which football coaches can con
tact high school players to Dec.
1 to March 1. A similar proposal
limiting contact by basketball
coaches also was passed.
