# Swimmers begin meat of schedule

### Steve Moe 
During winter quarter at
Stanford, students participate
in many different sports. Skiers
head for the slopes, basketball
players find a court, hockey
players go to the local rink, and
swimmers go to the pool.
Swimmers? Yes. as incon
gruous as it may seem, January
marks an active time for the
Stanford varsity swim season
Tomorrow at 4 p.m. in de-
Guerre Pool both the Cardinal
men's and women's teams face
Brigham Young University. For
the men. who have participated
only in low-keved. non-scoring
invitational meets, it will be
their first serious competition
of the season.
The women, meanwhile, have
already started their campaign
Saturday, in fact, they lost 79-70
in the final event to Texas, the
Cards' victim in the AIAW
finals last year.
However, Stanford head

coach Holger Dietze wasn't dis
mayed He explained that the
Cards don't "stack up" as well
to Texas in a dual meet as they
would in the final meet due to
limits on the amount of swim
mers allowed in dual meets.
"We can beat them (the Long
horns) in the finals." Dietze as
serted.
The nucleus of last year's
team returns, including star
junior Linda Jezek and
sophomore standouts Patty
Spees and Kim Carlisle. Add to
this group freshmen Sherri Han
na. Ann Tweedy, and Krissie
Bush, and the team appears
fully capable of defending their
title.
In fact, the Card women are
favored to again win the na
tionals. according to the latest
issue of Swimming World.
The men's team began the
new season with a mixture of op
timism and disappointment.

With what many observers call
one of the best group of
freshmen recruits in the nation.
Stanford looked forward to im
proving on last year's lOth-plaee
finish in the NCAA finals.

But a knee injury and subse
quent redshirting of Olympic
qualifier John Simons, Stan
ford's leading point scorer in
last year's NCAAs, put a slight
damper on the men's hopes.
