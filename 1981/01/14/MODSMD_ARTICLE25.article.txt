# Ruggers win two
## 
### David Zaro 
Stanford's rugby squads opened their seasons Saturday with vic
tories by the first and second teams over the UC-Santa Cruz Spurs.
The first team demonstrated considerable skill in its 53-3 romp
over the Spurs. Stanford's main asset was its fast-paced running
game, which relied on the quickness and agility of both the backs
and the forwards.
The team's lack of size had been a concern, particularly in the
scrum, but Saturday's game showed that what Stanford has in speed
should compensate for what it lacks in size. Much of this quickness
is embodied in scrum members Bill Shelander, Darrell Krasnoff
and Claude Olein.
Although the ruggers have lost many of their first-team players
from last year, backs Frank Hicks and Gary McKittrick return to
provide experience.
Despite not having played together much, the ruggers showed
teamwork which takes most squads at least a season to develop.
The home season begins Tuesday against UC-Davis.
