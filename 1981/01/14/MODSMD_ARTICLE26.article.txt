## Beavers get top ranking 
### 
Bv The Associated Press
Ralph Miller admits that
being No.l is something you
have to work toward. He should
know: it's taken him 30 years to
get there.
Miller's undefeated Oregon
State team edged Virginia for
the No.l position in The As
sociated Press college basket
ball poll yesterday as DePaul,
which held the top spot for the
past six weeks, tumbled to N0.4
after a shocking loss to un
heralded Old Dominion Satur
day.
"This is the first time any one
of my teams in 30 years has had
the No.l ranking." Miller said.
"You work for it. It's something
that anyone who works in
basketball works toward."
Oregon State, 12-0 and ranked
second last week, collected 39 of
61 first-place votes in the ballot
ing by a nationwide panel of
sports writers and broad
casters. Virginia. 11-0 and N0.3
last week, collected 20 first
place votes.
"All of our state is enjoying it
(being No.l)." said Miller, who
is in his 11th year as head coach
of the Beavers. "The state has a
population of two million, and
they've all been looking forward
to it."
Miller hopes his players
aren't blinded by No.l.
"I don't know what the dif
ference between No.l and N0.2
will be." Miller said, "but I
hope it won't be serious. We
have gained lots of experience,
and the ranking should be no
problem if we don't change our
attitude."
Preseason favorite Ken
tucky. 10-1. jumped from fourth
to third. DePaul collected the
final two first-place votes de
spite the 63-62 loss to Old Do
minion and was fourth, narrow
ly ahead of 12-0 Wake Forest.
LSU, 12-1, climbed from ninth
to sixth this week, while Notre
Dame, UCLA. Michigan and
Maryland rounded out the Top
10.
The Irish, a 54-52 loser to Mar

quette last week, slipped from
N0.5 to seventh, while UCLA,
which was stunned by USC 68-66.
dropped one notch to No.B.
Michigan, knocked from the un
defeated ranks by Purdue last
week, edged Maryland for the
N0.9 slot. The Terps were
beaten by North Carolina 75-66
Tennessee jumped three posi
tions in the poll and headed the
Second 10. Arizona State was

12th. followed by South Ala
bama. lowa. Brigham Young,
Utah. North Carolina. Illinois,
Clemson and Minnesota.
Last week, the Second 10 was
lowa. Illinois. Tennessee, Arizo
na State. South Alabama, North
Carolina. Brigham Young,
Utah. Minnesota and Clemson.
There were no newcomers in
this week's Top 20.
