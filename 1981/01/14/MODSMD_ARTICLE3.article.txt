## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Alexander Haig clashed with
Democratic senators yesterday about his role dur
ing the Watergate investigation, telling members of
the Foreign Relations Committee, "I found tremen
dous abuses on both sides."
He said he was referring to actions by high Nixon
administration officials and members of the U.S.
press.
Bristling under low-key but persistent question
ing about his conduct as chief of staff to former
President Richard Nixon, Haig, his voicerising, told
Sen Paul Sarbanes (D-Md ): "Mistakes were
made. I didn't make them. I wasn't there when they
were made. I had to inherit the consequences of mis
takes and try to keep the country on an even keel."
Haig's nomination as secretary of state is being
considered by the committee
Tap dance
Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.) questioned Haig
about his role in ordering wiretaps in 1969 on 13 sub

ordinates and four newsmen. Haig said he was as
sured by Nixon and by national security adviser
Henry Kissinger, his immediate superior, that they
were "legal and justifiable."
Haig told Tsongas. with a trace of sarcasm, that
he would "not indulge in mea culpas (self-blame)."
Haig rejected a request by Sen Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.) that he use his "persuasive" abilities with
Nixon to get the former president to voluntarily re
lease logs or tapes of 100 hours of still-confidential
1973 conversations between Haig and Nixon The
head of the National Archives told the committee
Monday that, according to federal law. he would
have to give Nixon time to file objections before he
could furnish the material to the Senate.
Haig reiterated that he had "absolutely no objec
tion to any tapes or documents which you feel are re
levant," but he added that "it is not in my authority
or state of influence to bring about the consequences
you suggest."
Referring to Nixon's firm stand against granting

outside access to his tapes in the National Archives,
Haig said his personal appeal "would not make an
iota of difference in a decision (by Nixon) made so
long ago and so hard fought."
Approval expected
The committee is expected to vote today on Haig's
nomination. Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.), the com
mittee chairman, has said there are sufficient votes
to approve Haig.
Haig posed some rhetorical questions for
Sarbanes when the senator repeatedly sought Haig's
views on Watergate.
"What is it you want me to say — something that
you haven't been able to get from somewhere else?"
Haig asked. "Do you think I'm going to endorse what
was done on either side?"
Haig said there were "abuses of power.' but
these occurred before he became Nixon's chief of
staff in May 1973.
"No one has a monopoly on virtue, senator, not
even you.' Haig told Sarbanes
