Military aid to El Salvador resumes
Washington — The Carter administration will announce
today a resumption of the U.S. military aid to El Salvador
that was suspended five weeks ago. informed sources said
last night.
On Dec 5, the administration halted military and eco
nomic aid to El Salvador after the slaying of four Ameri
can Catholic women, including three nuns Nine days ago.
two American agricultural experts were shot to death in a
San Salvador hotel.
The $20 million economic assistance program was re
sumed Dec. 17, but the military aid remained suspended
pending progress in the investigation of the murders of the
women and a reduction in politically motivated violence.
The sources, who asked not to be identified, said a con
tributing factor in the decision to restore the $5 million in
military aid was the beginning of an offensive by leftist
forces last weekend.
The decision to resume aid was personally approved by
President Jimmy Carter after a series of top level meet
ings in recent days involving Secretary of State Edmund
Muskie. national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and
Defense Secretary Harold Brown, the sources said.
Study assesses toxic shock risk
Minneapolis — Women who use high-absorbency tam
pons run a much greater risk of getting toxic-shock syn
drome than users of smaller, less absorbent tampons, ac
cording to results of a new study released yesterday.
The new study implicates all high-absorbency tampons
in promoting toxic-shock syndrome, and not just the Rely
brand, which Procter & Gamble withdrew from the mar
ket last September because it had been particularly im
plicated in studies. However, users of any type of tampon
have a greater chance of getting the rare but sometimes
fatal illness than nonusers, the findings show.
The study found that women who used the high-absorb
ency tampons had a 17 to 30 times higher risk of getting the
illness, according to Dr Michael Osterholm. the Minne
sota health department epidemiologist who announced the
findings. Those who used the lowest-absorbencv products
had only two to three times the risk of a woman who did not
use tampons at all. he said
Osterholm said the new study also confirms a finding by
other researchers that teen-agers have the highest risk of
developing toxic-shock syndrome. More than half of the 80
women studied were younger than 19 years old.
Miller gives Chrysler ultimatum
Washington — Treasury Secretary William Miller has
given Chrysler and the United Auto Workers an ultimatum
to agree on major cuts in contract benefits by 4 p.m. today
or forget about the $400 million in federally backed loans
the company says it needs to stay in business
"We have no more time." Miller said yesterday after a
meeting with Chrysler and UAW bargainers and officials
of the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board "By tomorrow,
we've got to have their best shot at this, or we'll just run
out of time." the secretary said.
Should negotiators fail to meet the loan board's dead
line. the whole question of the requested federal aid to
Chrysler probably will have to be deferred to the incoming

Reagan administration, said Miller, who added that that
"could cause problems for Chrysler."
An unusually testy UAW President Douglas Fraser was
more succinct "I doubt seriously that Chrysler could sur
vive" such a delay. Fraser said, adding that "it wouldn't
be fair to Reagan to expect him to make a decision" on
Chrysler "after being in office only a few days."
Namibia independence talks fail
Geneva, Switzerland — A U.N. conference called to im
plement independence for Namibia collapsed yesterday
when South Africa, which administers the territory, said it
was "premature" to fix a date for a cease-fire and elec
tions.
The South African statement came after the leader of
the internal government esablished by South Africa in
Namibia in defiance of the United Nations had said more
time was needed to assure impartiality of the United Na
tions. which is to supervise the elections, and to gain as
surances that a democratic form of government would be
established in the territory.
A spokesman for the South-West Africa People's Or
ganization. which has led the guerrilla war for independ
ence. immediately announced that it would demand U.N.
Security Council action to impose "comprehensive, man
datory sanctions, includng an oil embargo" against South
Africa.
South Africa said it acted because requirements for es
tablishing trust and confidence in the United Nations had
not been fulfilled.
The collapse of this conference means that independ
ence will be postponed at least until next year. Under the
U.N plan, the cease-fire in the guerrilla war was to take
effect in March with elections in October under U.N. su
pervision and in the presence of a 7500-man U.N. peace
keeping force.
Court widens lawyer-client privilege
Washington — The Supreme Court extended broader
protection yesterday to corporate lawyers against being
forced to disclose in court whatever they have learned
about questionable business practices such as bribery, pol
lution of the environment or tax evasion.
The court held unanimously that an attorney-client priv
ilege against disclosure generally covers communications
between a corporation's lawyers and its lower-level em
ployees. just as the privilege applies to discussions be
tween lawyers and top management.
The effect of the decision is to restrict the ability of gov
ernment investigators, such as prosecutors and tax
agents, to obtain information about the internal workings
of a company by subpoenaing its lawyer or his records.
The ruling also narrows the chance that rival companies
can obtain such information in a civil suit.
The decision was a substantial victory for the legal pro
fession and the business community.
Polish unions vow to strike
Warsaw, Poland — Independent labor leaders in
Rzeszow. beside the Soviet border, vowed yesterday to
hold a two-hour warning strike if the government doesn't
open negotiations on their demands within 24 hours.

A spokesman for Poland's biggest independent trade un
ion. Solidarity, said selected factories would be shut down
from noon to 2 p.m. today unless negotiators arrived to
talk to some 300 protesters.
He said protesters have been occupying a former gov
ernment trade union building for two weeks to support a
list of 69 demands including government recognition of an
independent farmers' union.
Sources at Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk said the
union's national leadership would meet to decide if it
should support the Rzeszow action.
Cold wave kills Eastern crops
The "strange" Siberian cold wave punishing the East
stunned Florida yesterday with a record killer freeze from
Tallahassee to Miami that hung icicles on orange trees and
glazed vegetables in their fields.
Records for the coldest day ever in January fell across
the Southeast — 7,degrees in Wilmington, N.C., 8 degrees
in Tallahassee. Fla., 14 in Savannah, Ga. — while many
cities of the Northeast logged new lows below zero.
The cold wave that has fishing boats frozen to their
docks in New England and fuel barges ice-bound in
Chesapeake Bay may have wiped out 20 percent of Flori
da's bountiful orange crop, the equivalent of 49 million
gallons of concentrated orange juice, officials said.

CIA nominee vows to beef up agency
Washington — William Casey pledged yesterday to
strive to reinvigorate the Central Intelligence Agency,
which he said is plagued by self-doubt and low morale after
years of demands that it be "tightly restrained, stringent
ly monitored or totally reorganized."
In confirmation hearings on his nomination to be CIA di
rector. the 67-vear-old New York lawyer and friend of
President-elect Ronald Reagan warned that "in an era of
increasing military vulnerability, effective intelligence is
of far greater importance than it may have been some
years ago when we had clear military superiority."
Stock exchange drops slightly
The stock market drifted lower in a relatively quiet ses
sion yesterday amid doubts about the interest-rate out
look.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.67 to
965.10, and losers outnumbered gainers by about a 5-3
margin in the daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange.

Military aid to El Salvador resumes
Washington — The Carter administration will announce
today a resumption of the U.S. military aid to El Salvador
that was suspended five weeks ago. informed sources said
last night.
On Dec 5, the administration halted military and eco
nomic aid to El Salvador after the slaying of four Ameri
can Catholic women, including three nuns Nine days ago.
two American agricultural experts were shot to death in a
San Salvador hotel.
The $20 million economic assistance program was re
sumed Dec. 17, but the military aid remained suspended
pending progress in the investigation of the murders of the
women and a reduction in politically motivated violence.
The sources, who asked not to be identified, said a con
tributing factor in the decision to restore the $5 million in
military aid was the beginning of an offensive by leftist
forces last weekend.
The decision to resume aid was personally approved by
President Jimmy Carter after a series of top level meet
ings in recent days involving Secretary of State Edmund
Muskie. national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and
Defense Secretary Harold Brown, the sources said.
Study assesses toxic shock risk
Minneapolis — Women who use high-absorbency tam
pons run a much greater risk of getting toxic-shock syn
drome than users of smaller, less absorbent tampons, ac
cording to results of a new study released yesterday.
The new study implicates all high-absorbency tampons
in promoting toxic-shock syndrome, and not just the Rely
brand, which Procter & Gamble withdrew from the mar
ket last September because it had been particularly im
plicated in studies. However, users of any type of tampon
have a greater chance of getting the rare but sometimes
fatal illness than nonusers, the findings show.
The study found that women who used the high-absorb
ency tampons had a 17 to 30 times higher risk of getting the
illness, according to Dr Michael Osterholm. the Minne
sota health department epidemiologist who announced the
findings. Those who used the lowest-absorbencv products
had only two to three times the risk of a woman who did not
use tampons at all. he said
Osterholm said the new study also confirms a finding by
other researchers that teen-agers have the highest risk of
developing toxic-shock syndrome. More than half of the 80
women studied were younger than 19 years old.
Miller gives Chrysler ultimatum
Washington — Treasury Secretary William Miller has
given Chrysler and the United Auto Workers an ultimatum
to agree on major cuts in contract benefits by 4 p.m. today
or forget about the $400 million in federally backed loans
the company says it needs to stay in business
"We have no more time." Miller said yesterday after a
meeting with Chrysler and UAW bargainers and officials
of the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board "By tomorrow,
we've got to have their best shot at this, or we'll just run
out of time." the secretary said.
Should negotiators fail to meet the loan board's dead
line. the whole question of the requested federal aid to
Chrysler probably will have to be deferred to the incoming

Reagan administration, said Miller, who added that that
"could cause problems for Chrysler."
An unusually testy UAW President Douglas Fraser was
more succinct "I doubt seriously that Chrysler could sur
vive" such a delay. Fraser said, adding that "it wouldn't
be fair to Reagan to expect him to make a decision" on
Chrysler "after being in office only a few days."
Namibia independence talks fail
Geneva, Switzerland — A U.N. conference called to im
plement independence for Namibia collapsed yesterday
when South Africa, which administers the territory, said it
was "premature" to fix a date for a cease-fire and elec
tions.
The South African statement came after the leader of
the internal government esablished by South Africa in
Namibia in defiance of the United Nations had said more
time was needed to assure impartiality of the United Na
tions. which is to supervise the elections, and to gain as
surances that a democratic form of government would be
established in the territory.
A spokesman for the South-West Africa People's Or
ganization. which has led the guerrilla war for independ
ence. immediately announced that it would demand U.N.
Security Council action to impose "comprehensive, man
datory sanctions, includng an oil embargo" against South
Africa.
South Africa said it acted because requirements for es
tablishing trust and confidence in the United Nations had
not been fulfilled.
The collapse of this conference means that independ
ence will be postponed at least until next year. Under the
U.N plan, the cease-fire in the guerrilla war was to take
effect in March with elections in October under U.N. su
pervision and in the presence of a 7500-man U.N. peace
keeping force.
Court widens lawyer-client privilege
Washington — The Supreme Court extended broader
protection yesterday to corporate lawyers against being
forced to disclose in court whatever they have learned
about questionable business practices such as bribery, pol
lution of the environment or tax evasion.
The court held unanimously that an attorney-client priv
ilege against disclosure generally covers communications
between a corporation's lawyers and its lower-level em
ployees. just as the privilege applies to discussions be
tween lawyers and top management.
The effect of the decision is to restrict the ability of gov
ernment investigators, such as prosecutors and tax
agents, to obtain information about the internal workings
of a company by subpoenaing its lawyer or his records.
The ruling also narrows the chance that rival companies
can obtain such information in a civil suit.
The decision was a substantial victory for the legal pro
fession and the business community.
Polish unions vow to strike
Warsaw, Poland — Independent labor leaders in
Rzeszow. beside the Soviet border, vowed yesterday to
hold a two-hour warning strike if the government doesn't

A spokesman for Poland's biggest independent trade un
ion. Solidarity, said selected factories would be shut down
from noon to 2 p.m. today unless negotiators arrived to
talk to some 300 protesters.
He said protesters have been occupying a former gov
ernment trade union building for two weeks to support a
list of 69 demands including government recognition of an
independent farmers' union.
Sources at Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk said the
union's national leadership would meet to decide if it
should support the Rzeszow action.
Cold wave kills Eastern crops
The "strange" Siberian cold wave punishing the East
stunned Florida yesterday with a record killer freeze from
Tallahassee to Miami that hung icicles on orange trees and
glazed vegetables in their fields.
Records for the coldest day ever in January fell across
the Southeast — 7,degrees in Wilmington, N.C., 8 degrees
in Tallahassee. Fla., 14 in Savannah, Ga. — while many
cities of the Northeast logged new lows below zero.
The cold wave that has fishing boats frozen to their
docks in New England and fuel barges ice-bound in
Chesapeake Bay may have wiped out 20 percent of Flori
da's bountiful orange crop, the equivalent of 49 million
gallons of concentrated orange juice, officials said.

CIA nominee vows to beef up agency
Washington — William Casey pledged yesterday to

In confirmation hearings on his nomination to be CIA di

President-elect Ronald Reagan warned that "in an era of
increasing military vulnerability, effective intelligence is
of far greater importance than it may have been some

Military aid to El Salvador resumes
Washington — The Carter administration will announce
today a resumption of the U.S. military aid to El Salvador
that was suspended five weeks ago. informed sources said
last night.
On Dec 5, the administration halted military and eco
nomic aid to El Salvador after the slaying of four Ameri
can Catholic women, including three nuns Nine days ago.
two American agricultural experts were shot to death in a
San Salvador hotel.
The $20 million economic assistance program was re
sumed Dec. 17, but the military aid remained suspended
pending progress in the investigation of the murders of the
women and a reduction in politically motivated violence.
The sources, who asked not to be identified, said a con
tributing factor in the decision to restore the $5 million in
military aid was the beginning of an offensive by leftist
forces last weekend.
The decision to resume aid was personally approved by
President Jimmy Carter after a series of top level meet
ings in recent days involving Secretary of State Edmund
Muskie. national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and
Defense Secretary Harold Brown, the sources said.
Study assesses toxic shock risk
Minneapolis — Women who use high-absorbency tam
pons run a much greater risk of getting toxic-shock syn
drome than users of smaller, less absorbent tampons, ac
cording to results of a new study released yesterday.
The new study implicates all high-absorbency tampons
in promoting toxic-shock syndrome, and not just the Rely
brand, which Procter & Gamble withdrew from the mar
ket last September because it had been particularly im
plicated in studies. However, users of any type of tampon
have a greater chance of getting the rare but sometimes
fatal illness than nonusers, the findings show.
The study found that women who used the high-absorb
ency tampons had a 17 to 30 times higher risk of getting the
illness, according to Dr Michael Osterholm. the Minne
sota health department epidemiologist who announced the
findings. Those who used the lowest-absorbencv products
had only two to three times the risk of a woman who did not
use tampons at all. he said
Osterholm said the new study also confirms a finding by
other researchers that teen-agers have the highest risk of
developing toxic-shock syndrome. More than half of the 80
women studied were younger than 19 years old.
Miller gives Chrysler ultimatum
Washington — Treasury Secretary William Miller has
given Chrysler and the United Auto Workers an ultimatum
to agree on major cuts in contract benefits by 4 p.m. today
or forget about the $400 million in federally backed loans
the company says it needs to stay in business
"We have no more time." Miller said yesterday after a
meeting with Chrysler and UAW bargainers and officials
of the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board "By tomorrow,
we've got to have their best shot at this, or we'll just run
out of time." the secretary said.
Should negotiators fail to meet the loan board's dead
line. the whole question of the requested federal aid to
Chrysler probably will have to be deferred to the incoming

Reagan administration, said Miller, who added that that
"could cause problems for Chrysler."
An unusually testy UAW President Douglas Fraser was
more succinct "I doubt seriously that Chrysler could sur
vive" such a delay. Fraser said, adding that "it wouldn't
be fair to Reagan to expect him to make a decision" on
Chrysler "after being in office only a few days."
Namibia independence talks fail
Geneva, Switzerland — A U.N. conference called to im
plement independence for Namibia collapsed yesterday
when South Africa, which administers the territory, said it
was "premature" to fix a date for a cease-fire and elec
tions.
The South African statement came after the leader of
the internal government esablished by South Africa in
Namibia in defiance of the United Nations had said more
time was needed to assure impartiality of the United Na
tions. which is to supervise the elections, and to gain as
surances that a democratic form of government would be
established in the territory.
A spokesman for the South-West Africa People's Or
ganization. which has led the guerrilla war for independ
ence. immediately announced that it would demand U.N.
Security Council action to impose "comprehensive, man
datory sanctions, includng an oil embargo" against South
Africa.
South Africa said it acted because requirements for es
tablishing trust and confidence in the United Nations had
not been fulfilled.
The collapse of this conference means that independ
ence will be postponed at least until next year. Under the
U.N plan, the cease-fire in the guerrilla war was to take
effect in March with elections in October under U.N. su
pervision and in the presence of a 7500-man U.N. peace
keeping force.
Court widens lawyer-client privilege
Washington — The Supreme Court extended broader
protection yesterday to corporate lawyers against being
forced to disclose in court whatever they have learned
about questionable business practices such as bribery, pol
lution of the environment or tax evasion.
The court held unanimously that an attorney-client priv
ilege against disclosure generally covers communications
between a corporation's lawyers and its lower-level em
ployees. just as the privilege applies to discussions be
tween lawyers and top management.
The effect of the decision is to restrict the ability of gov
ernment investigators, such as prosecutors and tax
agents, to obtain information about the internal workings
of a company by subpoenaing its lawyer or his records.
The ruling also narrows the chance that rival companies
can obtain such information in a civil suit.
The decision was a substantial victory for the legal pro
fession and the business community.
Polish unions vow to strike
Warsaw, Poland — Independent labor leaders in
Rzeszow. beside the Soviet border, vowed yesterday to
hold a two-hour warning strike if the government doesn't
open negotiations on their demands within 24 hours.

A spokesman for Poland's biggest independent trade un
ion. Solidarity, said selected factories would be shut down
from noon to 2 p.m. today unless negotiators arrived to
talk to some 300 protesters.
He said protesters have been occupying a former gov
ernment trade union building for two weeks to support a
list of 69 demands including government recognition of an
independent farmers' union.
Sources at Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk said the
union's national leadership would meet to decide if it
should support the Rzeszow action.
Cold wave kills Eastern crops
The "strange" Siberian cold wave punishing the East
stunned Florida yesterday with a record killer freeze from
Tallahassee to Miami that hung icicles on orange trees and
glazed vegetables in their fields.
Records for the coldest day ever in January fell across
the Southeast — 7,degrees in Wilmington, N.C., 8 degrees
in Tallahassee. Fla., 14 in Savannah, Ga. — while many
cities of the Northeast logged new lows below zero.
The cold wave that has fishing boats frozen to their
docks in New England and fuel barges ice-bound in
Chesapeake Bay may have wiped out 20 percent of Flori
da's bountiful orange crop, the equivalent of 49 million
gallons of concentrated orange juice, officials said.

CIA nominee vows to beef up agency
Washington — William Casey pledged yesterday to
strive to reinvigorate the Central Intelligence Agency,
which he said is plagued by self-doubt and low morale after
years of demands that it be "tightly restrained, stringent
ly monitored or totally reorganized."
In confirmation hearings on his nomination to be CIA di
rector. the 67-vear-old New York lawyer and friend of
President-elect Ronald Reagan warned that "in an era of
increasing military vulnerability, effective intelligence is
of far greater importance than it may have been some
years ago when we had clear military superiority."
