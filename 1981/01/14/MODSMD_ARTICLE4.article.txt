# DGs, Inter-Sorority Council recognized
## 
### Brad Crystal 
The University has officially recog
nized a sorority chapter for the first
time in 37 years.
After agreeing to abide by Univer
sity policy regarding local autonomy,
the Upsilon chapter of the Delta Gam
ma (DG) sorority last week became
the first sorority to acquire official
University recognition since 1944,
when the Board of Trustees banned
sororities from the campus.
The University lifted the ban in
1977.
In a related move, the University
also granted full recognition to the In
ter-Sorority Council, which coordi
nates rush activities and mediates in
ter-group disputes for six of seven ex
isting sororities.
Advantages
Recognition means several things.
First, the DGs can now call them
selves the Stanford chapter. Second,
they can use University facilities for
meetings and activities, including
rush. Third, as an officially recog
nized organization, the chapter is
eligible to petition for housing.
The announcement came in a Jan. 5
letter to Risa Forister, DG chapter
president, from Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of student affairs for res
idential education.
The decision to confer official rec
ognition was made only after Univer
sity administrators were satisfied
that the local chapter would be free to
set policy without interference from
the national organization.
"Because all areas of disagreement
have now been resolved and you have
been successful in gaining local auton
omy in all matters of membership
selection and group governance," rec
ognition was conferred, the letter
said.
A breakthrough
Robinson said he was "delighted,"
adding that the DG national officers
were "cooperative and helpfr'."
"I'd like to see other groups do it."
he said.
"It's a breakthrough," said Diana
Conklin. assistant doan of students
w ' **

and director of the row. She said the
recognition may lead other nationals
to resolve those issues of local auton
omy which have blocked recognition
up until now
"I'm hoping that other nationals
will realize that they don't have to give
up their identity in order to have a
chapter at Stanford. I hope it will
serve as an example to others."
Forister, who has struggled through
the recognition process for almost a
year, said she was "surprised and hap
py' when she heard the decision
Attendance problems have plagued
the DGs ever since the sorority was
reinstated three years ago, she said.
Until now all DG meetings had to be
held off-campus where factors such as
distance and safety kept many women
away, Forister said.
A key advantage of recognition, she
said, is that "people are more inclined
to join an organization that can use the
Stanford name and Stanford facilities.
But Forister stressed that the DGs
do not want to be apart from the ISC.
She said the DGs intend to hold rush
activities with the other member
sororities of the ISC. just as they have
done in the past.
"Recognition is not going to mean a
thing if the others aren't granted it,"
she added.
Taking the lead
In Conklin's words "The DGs have
led the way all the way. What will de
termine the outcome for the others is
the attitude of their nationals, wheth
er they are as willing to be as accom
modating to Stanford principles,
whether they are willing to acknowl
edge that their chapter at Stanford
will have to be a little different from
chapters elsewhere."
But Robinson said he doubted the
other sororities will be recognized
soon.
"Most if not all of the others have
not been as cooperative," he said.
Conklin praised the DGs for the
great effort they expended in ham
mering out an agreement that satis
fies both tVie University and the na
tional organization.

She called it "masterful negotiating
on the students' part. They had the
hardest part They did very, very
well."
Blanket permission
The most significant step came with
the national sorority's acceptance of
local rules. On Jan. 12 last year, DGs
national representatives sent the Uni
versity a letter granting "perpetual
blanket permission for Upsilon
chapter to pledge any Stanford Uni
versity woman student the members
choose to sponsor and vote to select."
Membership selection, however,
was not the only bone of contention,
according to Conklin
Other issues concerning local gov
ernance remained to be smoothed
over before recognition could be con
ferred. she said
"In the past year we have been
going through every fine point of the
constitution which seemed to be in
conflict with University policy on lo

cal autonomy to resolve them point by
point." she said
The last point of conflict concerned
a DG national sorority rule requiring
chapter officers to maintain a "C" Av
erage.
"Stanford's criteria don't involve
computing a GPA," said Conklin.
"Ultimately the national organiza
tion agreed that good standing accord
ing to Stanford's means of meas
urement would be the sole academic
criteria applied both to members and
officers." she added
Even though DGs are now techni
cally eligible to seek on-campus hous
ing. Terry Dobbels. a former DG pres
ident, said they would probably shun
the option.
It's better to not live together "be
cause when you start living together
you go through a cloning process like
at USC. Not living together makes it
better when we do get together. Social
activities are more fun."
