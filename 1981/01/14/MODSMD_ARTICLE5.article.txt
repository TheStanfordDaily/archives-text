The United Nations' goals and
peace-keeping abilities have seriously
eroded, according to a public
statement signed by seven Stanford
Nobel prize-winners.
The Nobel Laureates included econ
omist Milton Friedman, biochemist
Paul Berg and Felix Bloch and Robert
Hofstadter, the physicists.
Eleven University members in all
signed the statement which appeared
in the Nete York Times on December
14 under the heading "Call to Cons
cience."
"The United Nations is no longer
the guardian of social justice, human
rights and equality among nations."
the signers declared. "Indeed, per
verted by irrelevant political machin
ations. it is in danger of becoming a
force against peace itself."
U.N. endangers peace
In particular, the signers claimed,
the U.N. has worked against peace in

the Middle East. "Assaults or
chestrated by the Soviet and Arab
blocs in their campaign to discredit Is
rael." create this situation.
Soviet and Arab blocs moved the
U.N. to condemn the Egyptian-Israeli
peace treaty, exalt Palestinian Liber
ation Organization (PLO) terrorists
and to equate Zionism with racism,
the statement charged.
By alloting so much time to debate
on the Palestinian issue, the U.N. neg
lects the fates of other peoples — espe
cially those suffering from famine and
disease.
The U.N.'s special agencies — the
World Health Organization and the
U.N. Education, Scientific and Cul
tural Organization — are hampered by
the General Assembly's politics.
The signers called on member na
tions "to restore the promise that the
United Nations can achieve a better
world for all humanity."
Signatories reached here further

explained extreme disappointment
with U.N. affairs.
Bloc voting
Robert Rosenzweig. University
vice president of public affairs, said
the U.N.'s structure — one vote per
nation — fails to reflect world re
alities. Third World interests domi
nate U.N. discussion since these na
tions can push through their resolu
tions by voting in blocs, he said.
Seymour Martin Lipset. Hoover In
stitution senior fellow, said that since
Third World nations have a standing
majority, resolutions that condemn
Israel are easily passed. Chemistry
Professor Paul Florv warned that the
blatant attacks on Israel are an attack
on human rights everywhere.
The PLO should be excluded from
peace negotiations, signers said.

Florv said the PLO pretends to speak
for Palestinians and that until a truly
representative group is formed, no
solution can be found.
Lipset said territorial disputes are
at the heart of Israel's conflicts with
her neighbors. He proposed that the
West Bank could be returned to the Ar
abs — if Jordan would take it. Jordan,
however, can't do that in the current
situation, he said Lipset said the situ

ation might change if the Labor Party
takes command in Israel. The party
will run on a liberal platform in the ap
proaching elections.
Rosenzweig said strong American
leadership would be crucial to solving
the Palestinian problem. European al
lies are vacillating because American
policy has not been firmly stated, he
said.
Biochemistry Professor Arthur
Kornberg added that Arab oil wealth
has further distorted the U.N.'s goals

and practices.
Other signatories included Sydney
Hook and Edward Teller of the Hoover
Institution The full page advertise

tee for U.N. integrity. The con
servative group includes represent
atives from international art, science
and academic circles.
