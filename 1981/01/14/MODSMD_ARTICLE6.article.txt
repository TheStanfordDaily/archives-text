# Sororities' return ends a 37-year-long absence

When Stanford President Donald
Tresidder announced to a packed
group of women in Cubberly
auditorium that sororities were to be
abolished, he was greeted by a stand
ing ovation and a spontaneous rendi
tion of the Stanford hymn.
That was 1944.
At the time there was a great deal of
friction between the majority of
"hall" women who lived in Roble,
Lagunita Court and the Union (now
Old Union) and the 25 percent of all
women who lived in sororities.
The Board of Trustees approved the
ban after a lengthy study concluded
that sororities "tend to divide Stan
ford women into two competitive
groups . the women students are so
ten*o and Urcd ( dvirVnu thai

their college work suffers un
mistakably "
No one challenged the University
decision until 1977. when it came un
der fire in the wake of Title IX of the
Higher Education Amendments.
Title IX states that no one shall be
subjected to discrimination on the
basis of sex "under any education pro
gram or activity receiving Federal fi
nancial assistance"
Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson came to the con
clusion that a policy that permitted
fraternities and banned sororities was
inconsistent with the spirit of Title IX.
In November 1977, a support group
of 40 women organized to put pressure
on the administration to reinstate
sororities.

Trustees voted to rescind the sorority
ban on Dec. 13.
But with sororities no longer pro
hibited, new problems arose.
Since 1978, the University has re
fused to recognize sororities — i.e.. to
allow them to use Stanford facilities
or allow them to call themselves
"Stanford chapters."
The issue was local autonomy from
national organizations — under the
provisions of the University's policy
on residentially related student selec
tive groups. Stanford groups must
have complete freedom to set their
own regulations.
It was only when the Delta Gamma
chapter demonstrated that it was au
tonomous that the University would
recognize it.
Currently the seven sororities to
which more than 300 Stanford women
belong include Alpha Chi Omega.
Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma. Delta
Sigma Theta, Kappa Alpha Theta,
Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Pi Beta
Phi.
