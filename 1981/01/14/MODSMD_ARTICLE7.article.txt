# Greenhouse effect may alter climate
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Continued burn
ing of fossil fuels such as oil and
coal threatens to bring about a
global greenhouse effect and dra
matically alter the world's
climate as early as the mid-21st
Century, the President's Council
on Environmental Quality
warned yesterday.
The greenhouse effect, which
causes warmer temperatures, is
created by a buildup of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere, trap
ping more heat than normal in the
lower atmosphere.
While scientists have been stu
dying the carbon dioxide buildup
for some time, the problem now
should be attacked with some ur
gency by energy planners and oth
er government officials through
out the world, said Gus Speth. the
council chairman, in a preface to
the report.
The issue should receive a high
priority as part of U.S. energy
policy. Industrialized nations
should accelerate the develop
ment and use of renewable
sources of energy that do not rely
on burning of fossil fuels. Speth
said
Global heatup
A doubling of the amount of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
could raise the average world
temperature by 3 degrees Celsius
or about 5.4 degrees Farenheit,
the report said This could occur
by the year 2050. assuming an an

nual 2 percent increase in the use
of fossil fuel energy. That rate is
slightly higher than current in
creases but only half the annual
growth rate of fossil fuel use from
1940 to 1973.
Such an increase in tem
peratures could profoundly alter
patterns of rainfall and evapora
tion. turn rich farmlands into
deserts and cause higher sea
levels through melting of polar
ice. the report said.
"It is estimated that the sea
level might rise an average of five
meters (16.5 feet), or possibly up
to eight meters in some locations,
following the deglaciation of
West Antarctica, which could
have profound effects on the
shorelands of the world." the re
port said.
A five-meter increase in sea
level would flood a coastal area of
the United States now occupied
by 11 million people, the report
said.
There is no direct scientific
evidence of what would happen if
such an accumulation of carbon
dioxide occurred Most of the es
timates are based on theoretical
models that simulate the climate
under various atmospheric condi
tions.
Plans needed now
Speth said the problem is that
energy planning is needed now to
