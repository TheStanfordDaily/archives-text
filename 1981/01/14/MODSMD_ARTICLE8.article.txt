## Longevity harbors dangers, prof warns 
### 
From the Daily wire services
New York — The quest for eternal life is a
quest as eternal as life itself.
Today, in dozens of laboratories around
the world, geneticists, cell biologists and
gerontologists are working feverishly to un
lock the secrets of the aging process, to find
the key to the so-called biological clock, a
genetic code that is widely believed to exist
and to control the limits of man's life span
But according to Stanford Micobiologv
Prof. Leonard Havflick. one of the interna
tional leaders in research on aging, man's
lifespan — the number of years wecould ex
pect to live even if we eliminated the dis
eases and conditions that now kill us — has
remained constant. And. rather than want
ing to see the life span increased. Havflick
sees numerous reasons why we should fear
such an occurrence.
Interviewed in Toronto, where he was
speaking at the annual meeting of the Amer
ican Association for the Advancement of

Science. Havflick said, "There's absolutely
no evidence whatsoever that increases in
life span have occurred in at least the last
500.000 years or so And I don't think we
have given sufficient thought to the glib idea
that it would be desirable to increase human
longevity."
"That seems to be a tacit assumption on
everybody's part," said Havflick, "but I
have yet to see a scenario that makes any
sense, either intellectually or. even sub
ordinate to that, politically, economically,
psychologically or biologically."
"One of the first likely events in any ad
vances in this field might be the increase of
human longevity at the age of 80 or 90 for an
additional five or 10 years That's a likely
probable development. And if that's the
case, I don't know how many people would
like to see their lives extended at the age of
90 for five or 10 years with the probable
vicissitudes that accompany that age group
That 's not to say there are not individuals in

that age group who are perfectly functional,
but I think it would be an economic and a
psychological disaster for civilization if
that were to happen." warned Havfliek
"Regardless at what age it happens, if
you were to have a way of stalling your life
expectancy at a particular period — let's
say 50 or 60 — the probability is very great
that there would be a substantial number of
people who at that age are terribly dis
satisfied with their lives or consider them
selves wholly unproductive.' Havfliek said
"And if by some magic you could stall them
at that age. there are incredible problems."
Among other things, the researcher
pointed out. our present Social Security sys
tem is believed to be on the verge of col
lapse. our system of medical care and hous
ing for our present elderly population is
wholly inadequate and the vast majority of
our aging population is exiled from the
mainstream of society to a life of loneliness
and neglect.
