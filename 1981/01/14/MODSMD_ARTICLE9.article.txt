What's it like to be a science fiction
feminist when you're still unsure what it is?
Author Suzi McKee Charnas spoke about
this before a small group at the Women's
Center last Friday afternoon.
Charnas. author of Walk to the End of the
World and Xfotherlines. has three Emmy
nominations for excerpts from her latest
creation. Vampire Tapestry .
Charnas presents her first book .Walk to
the End of the World as a sort of exorcism:
"What happened to me is what happens to
all females of my genre, we start from
models of past literature — the roguish lad.
the seasoned old man — and work through
them in the novel."
This explains why a story portraying a

male-dominated, post-holocaust society is
considered feminist scripture: "I reversed
all social standards. This extreme environ
ment let sexism go to its logical extreme as
well: women are slaves "
The story, published in 1973. brought
Charnas a following who demanded a sec
ond episode. This led to a continuation of the
story in Motherlines.
"This was to be the storv of a woman who
escapes from the tyranny of males into a
free, female society of Amazons." said
Charnas.
"But as I began writing. I got paralyzed
with fear I realized there were not going to
be any men in this book."
This fear sprang, she explained, from the
realization that the only female stereotypes
literarv annals offered were limited to their

own era.
"Can you imagine one of Jane Austen's
characters living in mv Amazon, post-holo
caust society? You see what I was up
against." she said.
Charnas described the process of drawing
women from real-life traits. "It was three
years of hard work to build real characters,
but very exhilarating."
Charnas also spoke about Vampire
Tapestry, her tale of a contemporary vam
pire: "What would a biological vampire in
the modern world be like? And how would a
modern woman deal with one?" asks
Charnas. "These are the problems I wanted
to solve in the episodes," she said.
She concluded with readings from this
most recent work.
