# 'Undervalued and underpaid'
## Jobs unfilled, secretaries dissatisfied 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
In the movie .9 to 5, three secretar
ies, distraught over conditions in the
office, plot to kidnap their boss and
run the business themselves.
Although no Stanford professors
have been ransomed, many secretar
ies here are dissatisfied and the Uni
versity is having difficulty filling
clerical positions as it competes with
industry in the area.

News analysis

In September there was a 25 percent
increase in the number of openings
over last year. Although this gap has
closed considerably, the present 200
available jobs are still about 40 more
than at this time last year, according
to Employment Manager Linda
Haines.
Haines said that the numbers show
more people leaving, although they
also reflect internal transfers and an
increased number of jobs.
Particularly acute
William Massy, vice president for
business and finance, said all em
ployers are having problems filling
clerical positions and that Stanford's
difficulties are particularly acute.
He listed a combination of factors
which compound Stanford's problem
including higher wages in local in
dustry, lower housing costs south of
Palo Alto and expenses involved in
commuting which also make jobs to
the south more attractive. One library
staffer said she couldn't "afford to
live within a half-hour of Stanford."
Many clerical workers feel that
they get little recognition from the
University for their efforts, especially
in terms of salary. Haines said Stan
ford wages are about the median in the
area and that Stanford attempts to
"maintain a competitive position."
Undervalued
But Joyce Tipps-Coates, a secretary
at SLAC and the chairperson of the Of
fice Staff Organizing Committee, said
clerical help is "undervalued and un
derpaid."
Stanford salaries are lower than
many in the area. For example,
Lockheed, a Bay Area employer

known for generous benefits, pays en
try level office assistants between
$7.37 and $8.98 per hour. A similar job
at Stanford would start at between
$4.81 and $5.01 per hour.
Also, Lockheed makes quarterly ad
justments for cost-of-living increases,
whereas Stanford reviews salaries an
nually and (after six initial stages of
not more than a year each) rewards
increases on the basis of merit.
Paul Fearer, compensation man
ager. said the University each year
makes "an extensive analysis of the
salary market" and recently has
found that it "has slipped a little, but
not drastically." Fearer said cost-of
living increases are not widespread in
the area and although the merit sys
tem doesn't "guarantee a raise, most
receive increases of more than 10
percent."
An insult
Lorna Bryant, who left the Univer
sity to work elsewhere said the annual
raises were closer to 2 per cent calling
them, "an insult." Bryant, who re
ceived her B.A. from Stanford in his
tory, left the University after four
years of employment.
She said she felt that the merit sys
tem is the University's means of not
recognizing cost-of-living increases.
Aside from the additional health and
vacation benefits she received,
Bryant pointed out that upon leaving
Stanford she was immediately taken
out of the clerical level into the pro
fessional level as a computer program
librarian.
Bryant said she felt the University
takes an advantage of people with
"basic liberal-arts skills" by limiting
their titles and salaries to the clerical
level while demanding "very detailed
work."
Benefits
Some secretaries and office per
sonel said the benefits of working at
the University outweigh the possi
bilities for higher wages. Edie
Bridges, secretary in the church said
she enjoyed the "stimulation and en
richment" of working on a college
campus. Others pointed out that Stan
ford maintains a half-tuition plan for
their children. Added benefits men
tioned include, "the environment,"

"the association with intellectual peo
ple" and overall a more casual work
ing atmosphere.
Tipps-Coates said it is "nice being
surrounded by rose gardens and paltxv
trees" but they can't be "traded at the
store for food."
Haines said that it has become a
"challenge for the University to keep
up" with wages and other benefits in
the area, but that Stanford is not going
to make any special recruitment
drives for staff. Massy said, in survey-,
ing the differences between Stanford
and local industry, the University
must work to "close those gaps."

and local industry, the University

petition for a union. There is at present a shortage of
clerical personnel at the University.
In the movie .9 to 5, three secretar
ies, distraught over conditions in the
office, plot to kidnap their boss and
run the business themselves.
Although no Stanford professors
have been ransomed, many secretar
ies here are dissatisfied and the Uni
versity is having difficulty filling
clerical positions as it competes with
industry in the area.

News analysis

In September there was a 25 percent
increase in the number of openings
over last year. Although this gap has
closed considerably, the present 200
available jobs are still about 40 more
than at this time last year, according
to Employment Manager Linda
Haines.
Haines said that the numbers show
more people leaving, although they
also reflect internal transfers and an
increased number of jobs.
Particularly acute
William Massy, vice president for
business and finance, said all em
ployers are having problems filling
clerical positions and that Stanford's
difficulties are particularly acute.
He listed a combination of factors
which compound Stanford's problem
including higher wages in local in
dustry, lower housing costs south of
Palo Alto and expenses involved in
commuting which also make jobs to
the south more attractive. One library
staffer said she couldn't "afford to
live within a half-hour of Stanford."
Many clerical workers feel that
they get little recognition from the
University for their efforts, especially
in terms of salary. Haines said Stan
ford wages are about the median in the
area and that Stanford attempts to
"maintain a competitive position."
Undervalued
But Joyce Tipps-Coates, a secretary
at SLAC and the chairperson of the Of
fice Staff Organizing Committee, said
clerical help is "undervalued and un
derpaid."
Stanford salaries are lower than
many in the area. For example,
Lockheed, a Bay Area employer

known for generous benefits, pays en
try level office assistants between
$7.37 and $8.98 per hour. A similar job
at Stanford would start at between
$4.81 and $5.01 per hour.
Also, Lockheed makes quarterly ad
justments for cost-of-living increases,
whereas Stanford reviews salaries an
nually and (after six initial stages of
not more than a year each) rewards
increases on the basis of merit.
Paul Fearer, compensation man
ager. said the University each year
makes "an extensive analysis of the
salary market" and recently has
found that it "has slipped a little, but
not drastically." Fearer said cost-of
living increases are not widespread in
the area and although the merit sys
tem doesn't "guarantee a raise, most
receive increases of more than 10
percent."
An insult
Lorna Bryant, who left the Univer
sity to work elsewhere said the annual
raises were closer to 2 per cent calling
them, "an insult." Bryant, who re
ceived her B.A. from Stanford in his
tory, left the University after four
years of employment.
She said she felt that the merit sys
tem is the University's means of not
recognizing cost-of-living increases.
Aside from the additional health and
vacation benefits she received,
Bryant pointed out that upon leaving
Stanford she was immediately taken
out of the clerical level into the pro
fessional level as a computer program
librarian.
Bryant said she felt the University
takes an advantage of people with
"basic liberal-arts skills" by limiting
their titles and salaries to the clerical
level while demanding "very detailed
work."
Benefits
Some secretaries and office per
sonel said the benefits of working at
the University outweigh the possi
bilities for higher wages. Edie
Bridges, secretary in the church said
she enjoyed the "stimulation and en
richment" of working on a college
campus. Others pointed out that Stan
ford maintains a half-tuition plan for
their children. Added benefits men
tioned include, "the environment,"

"the association with intellectual peo
ple" and overall a more casual work
ing atmosphere.
