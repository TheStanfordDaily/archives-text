# Consumer Affairs Bureau checks local stores
## Where are the best shopping deals? 
### Fred Wainwright 
The question has remained
unanswered up to now. Do the
Store and the Bookstore actual
ly have better deals than off
campus businesses?
Comparing the Store with a
Seven-Eleven, the Town and
Country Pharmacy and a Co-Op,
the best buys at the Store are
soap, shaving cream, soft
drinks, pastries and crackers.
Its prices for milk products and
razorblades remained com
petitive and its laundry prod
ucts were generally considered
more expensive. In a separate
price comparison, the Book
store was found to have cheaper
basic school supplies than near
by stores.
These are results of some of
the projects completed by the
recently created ASSU Con

sumer Affairs Bureau. The Con
sumer Affairs Bureau was
created Spring Quarter last
year for the purpose of in
vestigating the products and
services used on campus as well
as in the area.
Current projects include
analyses of prices of such ser
vices as laundromats and dry
cleaners, bicycle and type
writer repair shops, liquor
stores and travel agencies.
Junior Gabrielle Gallegos
was chosen to direct the bu
reau's activities, projects done
by the students themselves. Ac
cording to a proposal given to
the Stanford Center for Innova
tion in Research and Education
(SCIRE), which has already
been accepted, the students will
be given credit for their
projects beginning this Spring.

According to Gallegos,
"there is a lot of flexibility at
the bureau; a student can be
come part of the board of direc
tors, take up a pre-assigned
project or even create his own
project." Each board member
sets the policy and the goals of
the bureau by choosing specific
projects.
As a director, Gallegos deals
with the particulars of each
project; organizing the data and
keeping it in a standardized
form. She is now involved in a
special project which calls for a
referral service in the ASSU
that will re-direct people to a
specific office on campus.
About a year and a half ago
there was some student dis
satisfaction with the way Tres
idder Union was being run, espe
cially relating to the quality and
prices of its food services. The
director of Tresidder, members
of ASSU and representatives of
a nationwide organization
called the Public Interest Re
search Group took part in a
meeting to decide what would
be done in order to increase the
quality of Tresidder services.

The Food Committee was
created, which helped change
the operation of the Tresidder
Food Service, then including the
Coffee House and the Station,
from Guckenheimer Company
to the Servomation. Though the
Coffee House is now student
run, the Food Committee did
maintain strict control of the
prices and quality of the food.
An ASSU task force, also
created as a result of the meet
ing. eventually developed into
the Consumer Affairs Bureau
under the leadership of then
senior Tom Verden.
Despite an initial $100 grant
and a $750 loan from the ASSU
Senate, the Consumer Affairs
Bureau will be needing a con
siderable amount of money for
its future projects. Besides a
new loan from the Senate, a plan
for a fee assessment is being
studied. The student projects
themselves are not expensive
but publications are being
planned.
The "Oops," a small pam
phlet with advertisements and
certain offers in stores near the
campus, was published in Octo

ber and did not represent a large
expense to the bureau. A 14-page
booklet to be published this
spring which Gallegos called "a
compilation and summarization
of all the bureau's work," will,
on the other hand, cost about
$1500.
The bureau's future plans in
clude an analysis of the entire
University's food service and of
where tuition money is being
spent. A further comparison of
the Bookstore to nearby stores
will be made and Gallegos said,
"the bureau will eventually in
vestigate thoroughly the ac
tivities of the Sequoia Travel
Agency. We have received
many complaints about them.
"Otherwise," she continued,
"it is up to the students to ex
press their opinions about ser
vices in order for the bureau to
create a project relating to my
specific subject.
"Hopefully," Gallegos said,
"we will be able to make some
suggestions to the University.
We are also interested in orien
ting and alerting the students to
all possible services available to
them on campus as well as in the
area."
