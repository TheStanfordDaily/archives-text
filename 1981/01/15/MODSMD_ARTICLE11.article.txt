# Four year search by mother finds missing daughter
## 
### 
San Jose (AP) â€” A 5-year-old
girl who mysteriously disap
peared while an infant was re
turned home Tuesday after she
was located in Mexico, ending a
four-year search that forced the
family to mortgage its
possessions.
"I feel wonderful, I feel ter
rific," said Georgia Hilgeman,
who located Monica Rios, 5,
Sunday night with the help of
Mexican authorities near the
village of Puebla, about 80 miles
east of Mexico City.
Monica was reported missing
while with her father, Juan
Rios, who had taken the girl to a
civic festival in Oakland Oct. 16,
1976, when she was 13-months
old.
The father, who was not avail
able for comment Tuesday, said
at the time that he had put the
girl down on the ground, looked
around, and when he turned
back she was gone, according to
police.
"She calls me mother, now,"
said Mrs. Hilgeman. "I never
gave up hope. I was de
termined.
"Our first problem will be to
teach her to speak English," she
said. The child speaks only
Spanish, but was getting along
well with many relatives and
friends gathered in the family's
modest home.
The child's parents were
divorced in April 1976, and the
mother married Robin
Hilgeman, by whom she had a
son, Ryan, now 2.
Mrs. Hilgeman flew to Mexi

co earlier this month on one of
many trips to the country and
said she was able to obtain help
from Mexican authorities in lo
cating the child.
Monica was living with a rela
tive of her former husband, she
said.
Hilgeman, 42, a loan agent for
a savings and loan association,
said they had made more than a
dozen fruitless trips to Mexico
pursuing speculation and faulty
tips, but at last located an of
ficial who was able to help
them.
"We have spent $50,000 to
$75,000, all our own money," he
said. "We mortgaged every
thing we had to retrieve her this
last trip. We had to mortage our
house."
Hilgeman said in the process
of regaining Monica, a Mexican
official was given the $10,000 re
ward put up by family sympa
thizers, along with $6000 in addi
tional money from the
Hilgemans.
Hilgeman and his wife said
they did not know how Monica
got to Mexico or came to live
with the relative.
"All I know is that she was
with her father at the time (she
disappeared)," Hilgeman said.
"And when she was found she
was with her father's first
cousin."
Hilgeman said there had been
bitter divorce relations between
his wife and her former hus
band, who teaches Mexican-
American studies at a Laney
College in Oakland.
