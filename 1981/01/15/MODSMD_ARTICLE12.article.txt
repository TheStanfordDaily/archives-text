The booklet is a basic guide
for students who are interested
in going overseas. There is in

sections with basic information
on study, employment and
travel overseas.
The section on studying
abroad covers different alter

direct enrollment, summer
study and U.S. College-Spon
sored Programs other than
ones offered by Stanford. It
also contains information on the
Rhodes, Marshall, Churchill
and other scholarships.
The Employment section cov
ers job options like working in a

kibbutz or at an archaeological
dig and how to find a job or get a
traineeship. It also contains in
formation on the red tape and
prerequisites you'll encounter
when trying to get a job.
"Getting there" and "Trav
eling once you are there" are
two helpful topics of the travel
section. Every aspect of travel
from travel by plane to travel by
thumb is covered in the section.
It also includes information on
youth hostels, inexpensive ho

At the end of each of these
sections, there is a listing of oth

the second floor of the Bechtel
International Center. It is open 8

The booklet, on sale at the Ov
erseas Resource Center for
$1.25, is a revised edition of a
1977 publication. The co-editors
of this edition. Makino and Cath
erine Gamon. both have person
al experience in overseas study
and travel. They also used in
formation from different publi
cations to add new information
to this edition. Makino added
that because price information

for things like rail passes keeps
changing, they will print inserts
with the new prices to keep the
booklet up to date.
"We recommend the booklet
to students interested in over
seas studies. We also in
corporate a section of it into the
orientation handbook we give to
students before they go over
seas," explained Peggy
Blumenthal, assistant director
of Overseas Studies.
Makino said the booklet gives
information on alternatives to
the overseas programs offered
by the Stanford Overseas Stud
ies Office. She added, "Over
seas is not only for studying,"
and that students should think
about traveling or working as
reasons to go overseas also.
