## OPINIONS Watt, environment don't mix 
### 
It is not often that we see the function of
an executive department being changed in
one fell swoop. Yet that is exactly what
will happen when James Watt takes office
as secretary of the interior.
As secretary (his confirmation by the
newly Republican Senate is near-in
evitable), Watt will bring his brand of
land-use advocacy to a branch of govern
ment that administers thousands of
square miles of Federal land. The ad
versary relationship between the Interior
Department and the departments of
Energy or Commerce in questions of con
servation versus development may be se
verely imbalanced when Watt takes of
fice. The environmentalist forces will be
left with a significantly reduced voice
within the government.
The claim has been made that Watt is
merely a supporter of "mixed use" plans
for Federal land. But this is just so much
self-deception; an ostrich with its head in
the sand would have a longer-range view.

"Mixed use" does not mean the reason
able. measured utilization of the nation's
natural resources in such a way as to least
disturb the environment. Combined with
the move Watt has endorsed to return ju
risdiction over public land to the states,
this approach would set in motion reven
ue-generating land-use plans, much more
of a temptation to the states than to the
Federal government.
Translated into specifics, this means
the opening of wild prairie land to grazing,
even though the land may be reduced to
desert by overgrazing within five years; it
means the sale of shale oil exploration
rights on public land in Colorado.
As the quality of life in the cities de
teriorates and as more and more of our
non-renewable resources end up as soot in
the air or scrap on the junk heap, the
patches of undeveloped land that have
been preserved become even more essen
tial. If we lose them now, we'll never get
them back.
