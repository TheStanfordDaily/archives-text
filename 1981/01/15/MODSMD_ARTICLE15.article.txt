# Celebrate King's birthday
## 
### 
Had he escaped an assassin's bullet,
Martin Luther King would be 52 years old
today.
Thousands nationwide and many on
campus today will rally and hold vigils in
the memory of this nations greatest civil
rights leader. From the steps of the
Capitol Building in Washington, thousands
will march in King's honor. In Tresidder
at noon students will gather to com
memorate his birthday.
The sustaining vigor with which this na
tion remembers the man who, 24 years
ago, led the boycott of the segregated bus
lines of Montgomery, Alabama, is a
strong reminder to us all of the significant
effect this one man had on the social fabric
of this country.
The Daily supports the efforts of singer
Stevie Wonder and others who want to

make Martin Luther King's birthday a na
tional holiday, and we feel that such a pro
posal is long overdue.
We urge the Congress to take af
firmative action on the bills introduced by
Sen. Charles Mathias (R-Md.) in the Sen
ate and Rep. John Conyers (D-
Mich.)which would make such a day of
commemoration a reality.
Far too seldom in the history of mankind
does a figure emerge who tries to lead his
people from the darkness of prejudice and
hate, as Martin Luther King did, through
his own example.
A national day of commemoration
would remind people that the spirit of
Martin Luther King lives on, and that not
even a bullet could silence his words and
memorv.
