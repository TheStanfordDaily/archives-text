## American freedom not protected by conscription 
### 
Scott Richter's arguments for
submitting to draft registration
and the draft (Daily, January
8), while thoughtfully pres
ented, rest on assumptions
which are seriously flawed.
First. Richter argues that
registration and/or the draft
are necessary to preserve
American freedom. He points to
past Japanese aggression and
comtemporary Soviet ag
gression as obvious threats to
American liberty justifying
conscription.
Let's consider Richter's two
examples in more detail.
Contrary to what Richter sug
gests. the foreign-policy goal of
the Japanese during the '30 s
and '40 s was neither the con
quest of the U.S. nor the extinc
tion of American freedom.
Rather, the Japanese aimed to
replace European and Ameri
can imperialism in Asia and the
Pacific with their own brand of
Asian imperialism. America
went to war with Japan because
of the U.S. government's de
termination to retain its own
imperial possessions (the Phil
ippines. Hawaii, etc.) and pro
tect the imperial position of its
European allies against the
Japanese challenge.
Indeed, Roosevelt, prior to
the attack on Pearl Harbor, had
promised the British that Amer
ica would go to war with Japan
if the Japanese moved against
British or Dutch colonial
possessions in Southwest Asia
or the East Indies whether or
not American territory was at

tacked.
Recall also that the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor only af
ter FDR had launched America
on a clear course of belligerency
against the Axis powers: Amer
ican air and naval patrols in the
Atlantic with orders to "shoot
on sight" German submarines
or surface raiders; the transfer
of 50 U.S. naval vessels to
Britain; lend-lease military aid
to the Allies; the U.S. embargo
on exports of critical materials
(including oil and scrap iron)
to Japan, and the freezing of
Japanese assets in the U.S. — all
of these belligerent acts by the
U.S. antedated Pearl Harbor.
Americans were drafted to
fight the Japanese not in order
to defend American freedom
but rather to prop up the im
perial pretensions of the Ameri
can and Western European gov
ernments.
Now let's consider contem
porary Soviet aggression. I fully
share Richter's horror at Com
munist domestic tyranny and
foreign expansionism. How
ever. Soviet imperialism is not a
serious threat to American free
dom; Richter produces no
evidence indicating that the
USSR has either the capability
or the intention of invading or
conquering the United States.
Perhaps Richter favors the
draft not to protect ourselves
but rather to enable the U.S. to
protect other nations from the
USSR However. American mil
itary preparedness and in
tervention to protect foreign

peoples from the Soviets has re
peatedly proven either unneces
sary or positively harmful.
The American military pres
ence in Europe and Japan is un
necessary: these nations have
more than adequate population,
wealth, and technology to de
fend themselves.
American attempts to thwart
the Soviets in the Third World
have in fact benefited the Sovi
ets. U.S. intervention in defense
of corrupt and despotic (but
anti-Soviet) dictatorships has
caused many people in the Third
World to turn to Soviet-style to
talitarian socialism as the only
obvious alternative to the cor
rupt despotisms favored by the
U.S. American policies intended
to reduce Communist influence
have had the opposite effect.
In short, there is no plausible
basis for claiming that Soviet
imperialism requires or justi
fies conscription in the United
States.
Richter's other major argu
ment is that, in gratitude "for
the protection given by all the
laws" enacted by the govern
ment and for "the prosperity
and freedom that this country
provides." we owe it to the gov
ernment to accept the draft or

at least to humbly and meekly
accept the government's pun
ishment if we resist the draft.
Richter has a curious concep
tion of government.
Far from being the source of
prosperity, security, and free
dom. governments have,
throughout history, been the pri
mary threat to these values.
Contemporary governments ex
tort far more in taxes than the
total take of all the world's
thieves; governments kill and
torture far more victims than do
all the world's murderers and
assailants.
The record of the American
government may be less black
than most, but the general pat
tern is nonetheless the same.
Over the years, the American
government has perpetuated
slavery and racism and has re
peatedly engaged in mass
murder. It has systematically
attempted to suppress dissident
lifestyles and deviant sub
cultures; it has repeatedly in
tervened in the economy to pro
tect established interests
against the throat of competi
tion and to aid the politically
articulate classes at the ex
pense of the poor and the pow
erless.

American freedom and pros
perity are not gifts of the gov
ernment. Human beings are au
tomatically free (and their nat
ural liberty invariably produces
economic prosperity) until their
freedom is infringed by an out
side power. The main such out
side power is government.
If we are relatively free and
prosperous in this country, it is
because Americans have tradi
tionally been relatively hostile
towards the government.
Our gratitude for American
freedom and prosperity should
be given not, as Richter sug
gests, to the government but
rather to the millions of Ameri
cans — Henry David Thoreau,
John Brown, Patrick Henry and
others — who heroically re
sisted the power of the state.
To support the draft or to un
protestingly submit to draft reg
istration is to betray the memo
ry of those past resisters. We
owe it to them, to ourselves, and
to the future of this nation to op
pose the draft and draft regis
tration and to continue in gener
al to resist government author
ity and power.

or surface raiders; the transfer
of 50 U.S. naval vessels to
Britain; lend-lease military aid
to the Allies; the U.S. embargo
on exports of critical materials
(including oil and scrap iron)
to Japan, and the freezing of
Japanese assets in the U.S. — all
of these belligerent acts by the
U.S. antedated Pearl Harbor.
Americans were drafted to
fight the Japanese not in order
to defend American freedom
but rather to prop up the im
perial pretensions of the Ameri
can and Western European gov
ernments.
Now let's consider contem
porary Soviet aggression. I fully
share Richter's horror at Com
munist domestic tyranny and
foreign expansionism. How
ever. Soviet imperialism is not a
serious threat to American free
dom; Richter produces no
evidence indicating that the
USSR has either the capability
or the intention of invading or
conquering the United States.
Perhaps Richter favors the
draft not to protect ourselves
but rather to enable the U.S. to
protect other nations from the
USSR However. American mil
itary preparedness and in
tervention to protect foreign

peoples from the Soviets has re
peatedly proven either unneces
sary or positively harmful.
The American military pres
ence in Europe and Japan is un
necessary: these nations have
more than adequate population,
wealth, and technology to de
fend themselves.
American attempts to thwart
the Soviets in the Third World
have in fact benefited the Sovi
ets. U.S. intervention in defense
of corrupt and despotic (but
anti-Soviet) dictatorships has
caused many people in the Third
World to turn to Soviet-style to
talitarian socialism as the only
obvious alternative to the cor
rupt despotisms favored by the
U.S. American policies intended
to reduce Communist influence
have had the opposite effect.
In short, there is no plausible
basis for claiming that Soviet
imperialism requires or justi
fies conscription in the United
States.
Richter's other major argu
ment is that, in gratitude "for
the protection given by all the
laws" enacted by the govern
ment and for "the prosperity
and freedom that this country
provides." we owe it to the gov
ernment to accept the draft or

at least to humbly and meekly
accept the government's pun
ishment if we resist the draft.
Richter has a curious concep
tion of government.
Far from being the source of
prosperity, security, and free
dom. governments have,
throughout history, been the pri
mary threat to these values.
Contemporary governments ex
tort far more in taxes than the
total take of all the world's
thieves; governments kill and
torture far more victims than do
all the world's murderers and
assailants.
The record of the American
government may be less black
than most, but the general pat
tern is nonetheless the same.
Over the years, the American
government has perpetuated
slavery and racism and has re
peatedly engaged in mass
murder. It has systematically
attempted to suppress dissident
lifestyles and deviant sub
cultures; it has repeatedly in
tervened in the economy to pro
tect established interests
against the throat of competi
tion and to aid the politically
articulate classes at the ex
pense of the poor and the pow
erless.

American freedom and pros
perity are not gifts of the gov
ernment. Human beings are au
tomatically free (and their nat
ural liberty invariably produces
economic prosperity) until their
freedom is infringed by an out
side power. The main such out
side power is government.
If we are relatively free and
prosperous in this country, it is
because Americans have tradi
tionally been relatively hostile
towards the government.
Our gratitude for American
freedom and prosperity should
be given not, as Richter sug
gests, to the government but
rather to the millions of Ameri
cans — Henry David Thoreau,
John Brown, Patrick Henry and
others — who heroically re
sisted the power of the state.
To support the draft or to un
protestingly submit to draft reg
istration is to betray the memo
ry of those past resisters. We
owe it to them, to ourselves, and
to the future of this nation to op
pose the draft and draft regis
tration and to continue in gener
al to resist government author
ity and power.

Scott Richter's arguments for
submitting to draft registration
and the draft (Daily, January
8), while thoughtfully pres
ented, rest on assumptions
which are seriously flawed.
First. Richter argues that
registration and/or the draft
are necessary to preserve
American freedom. He points to
past Japanese aggression and
comtemporary Soviet ag
gression as obvious threats to
American liberty justifying
conscription.
Let's consider Richter's two
examples in more detail.
Contrary to what Richter sug
gests. the foreign-policy goal of
the Japanese during the '30 s
and '40 s was neither the con
quest of the U.S. nor the extinc
tion of American freedom.
Rather, the Japanese aimed to
replace European and Ameri
can imperialism in Asia and the
Pacific with their own brand of
Asian imperialism. America
went to war with Japan because
of the U.S. government's de
termination to retain its own
imperial possessions (the Phil
ippines. Hawaii, etc.) and pro
tect the imperial position of its
European allies against the
Japanese challenge.
Indeed, Roosevelt, prior to
the attack on Pearl Harbor, had
promised the British that Amer
ica would go to war with Japan
if the Japanese moved against
British or Dutch colonial
possessions in Southwest Asia
or the East Indies whether or
not American territory was at

tacked.
Recall also that the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor only af
ter FDR had launched America
on a clear course of belligerency
against the Axis powers: Amer
ican air and naval patrols in the
Atlantic with orders to "shoot
on sight" German submarines
or surface raiders; the transfer
of 50 U.S. naval vessels to
Britain; lend-lease military aid
to the Allies; the U.S. embargo
on exports of critical materials
(including oil and scrap iron)
to Japan, and the freezing of
Japanese assets in the U.S. — all
of these belligerent acts by the
U.S. antedated Pearl Harbor.
