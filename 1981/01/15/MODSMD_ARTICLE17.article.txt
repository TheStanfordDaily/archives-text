On behalt of those who volun
teer their time and effort to
make Stanford's radio station
KZSU an informative, well-pro
grammed and entertaining sta
tion. 1 am writing to comment
on Dean of Student Affairs
Lyons' recent decision prevent
ing KZSU from returning to a 24-
hour-a-day broadcasting for
mat. Currently the station is re
quired to go off the air at mid
night and begin broadcasting at
8 a.m.
It this limited broadcasting
format continues through win
ter quarter, the majority of stu
dents who devoted three to four
hours per week this quarter in
acquiring the skills to become
talented and creative additions
to the KZSU air sound will be
cheated of the benefits of their
dedication That is. approx
imately 10 of the 15 of us
who have taken the disc jockey
class taught this quarter by
Mike Eldredge. KZSU's chief
announcer, will not get shows
winter quarter. Deciding which
new people will not get shows
will be difficult, as there are far
more than five deserving stu
dents in the class.
There are more serious con
sequences to the decision keep
ing KZSU off the air for eight
hours a day besides unfairness
and an unprofessional sound.

Should a national emergency oc
cur requiring the activation ot
the Fmergency Broadcast Sys
tem or Fmergency Action
Notification. KZSU will pick up
the notification from KNBR and
is then supposed to relay the
notification to KFJC and two
other local stations.
If KZSU is off the air when a
national emergency occurs, the
three stations who depend on
KZSU for notification will not
receive it. This is serious, since
KFJC at least, if not the other
two stations, has a Bay Area
wide audience which is just as
entitled to have knowledge of an
emergency as any other au
dience.
As I understand it, KZSU was
limited to 16 hours a day of
broadcasting due to security
problems. These security prob
lems have been solved to the
satisfaction of KZSU personnel
bv a strict visitor policy and a
front door which is always
closed and locked. I see no valid
reasons why a group of devoted
people should see their hours of
work wasted or why the public
should be denied the right to
know of an emergency. How
about it. Dean Lyons?

Day of tasting
On behalf of the Committee

on Hunger, we wish to thank
Members of the Stanford com
munity for then support of the
Day of Fasting. We are grateful
to the Food Service staff for
Iheir continued cooperation,
and to the 1380 students who
turned in their meal cards, rais
ing $3571. The participation of
the Fating Clubs, Cowell
Cluster, and other independent
houses was also quite excep
tional. contributing to the final
total of well over $5000.
We hope that the fast will not
be viewed merely as an isolated
act of chanty that is conclusive
in itself, but that the issues it
raises will encourage a greater
examination of personal at
titudes and lifestyles. The need
for individual and collective re
sponses to hunger, wherever it
occurs, grows more urgent eve
ry dav.
In response to Mark Adolph's
letter {Daily, Dec. 1), we would
like to note first that fasting was
meant to be a voluntary act and
we regret that any persons feel
they were forced to participate.
Second, we consider unjustified
the insinuation that many .stu
dents fasting were insincere in
their committment.

is then supposed to relay the
notification to KFJC and two
other local stations.
If KZSU is off the air when a
national emergency occurs, the
three stations who depend on
KZSU for notification will not
receive it. This is serious, since
KFJC at least, if not the other
two stations, has a Bay Area
wide audience which is just as
entitled to have knowledge of an
emergency as any other au
dience.
As I understand it, KZSU was
limited to 16 hours a day of
broadcasting due to security
problems. These security prob
lems have been solved to the
satisfaction of KZSU personnel
bv a strict visitor policy and a
front door which is always
closed and locked. I see no valid
reasons why a group of devoted
people should see their hours of
work wasted or why the public
should be denied the right to
know of an emergency. How
about it. Dean Lyons?

Day of tasting
On behalf of the Committee

on Hunger, we wish to thank
Members of the Stanford com
munity for then support of the
Day of Fasting. We are grateful
to the Food Service staff for
Iheir continued cooperation,
and to the 1380 students who
turned in their meal cards, rais
ing $3571. The participation of
the Fating Clubs, Cowell
Cluster, and other independent
houses was also quite excep
tional. contributing to the final
total of well over $5000.
We hope that the fast will not
be viewed merely as an isolated
act of chanty that is conclusive
in itself, but that the issues it
raises will encourage a greater
examination of personal at
titudes and lifestyles. The need
for individual and collective re
sponses to hunger, wherever it
occurs, grows more urgent eve
ry dav.
In response to Mark Adolph's
letter {Daily, Dec. 1), we would
like to note first that fasting was
meant to be a voluntary act and
we regret that any persons feel
they were forced to participate.
Second, we consider unjustified
the insinuation that many .stu
dents fasting were insincere in
their committment.
