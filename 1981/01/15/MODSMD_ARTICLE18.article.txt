## New female "ideal" no healthier 
### 
If you don't subscribe to
Sports Illustrated it might be
worthwhile to look for last
week's issue just to read about
Gayle Olinek. If you don't read
the article, at least look at the
pictures.
Olinek is a female marathon
runner and body-builder whose
physical magnificence is
equalled only by her determina
tion. Although the male author
of the piece fairly illustrates her
strength and self-determination
in prose, the article's clearer
message is in those pictures.
Of many friends who saw the
issue, several only remembered
or looked at Olinek's pictures,
especially the one in the first
pages of the article (which is
titled, "The Greatest Legs Ever
to Stride the Earth.") Olinek is
shown running on a beach in an
unforgettable bathing suit and
sheath of muscle The power of
her image is such that one is
tempted to pull up a pant-leg
and make a wistful comparison
with one's own solei.
All's fair in selling maga
zines. I suppose, if buying them
is a free choice. Of course.
Sports Illustrated is the same
publication which annually fea
tures women's "swimsuits"
made of threads and held on
with luck. Certainly the maga
zine calculated the sensation
Olinek's legs would cause
among its mostly-male sub
scribers, but the magazine also
flirts with sex by printing near
cheesecake pictures of serious
male athletes. The Olinek
photos take her story and strug
gle out of context, but even
more distressing is Olinek's
own eagerness to join in the
modern competition to create
and replenish media ideals of
women.
Her body type, Olinek sug
gests in the article, ought to be
come the new female aesthetic
for the 1980 s. Certainly she's
right in pointing out that the
Playboy look is a distortion of
real women, but Olinek seems
to take for granted that some
ideal body-type is inevitable or
necessary.
For a women whose childhood
was a constant battle to hide her

legs and avoid teasing for being
physically different from other
girls and whose pride in her
body was hard-won and long in
coming. Olinek is disappointing
ly quick to forget how it feels to
be helplessly out of body-fash
ion. This new standard, should it
become popular, is just as im
possible for other women to at
tain as the long, lean look is for
Olinek. She seems eager how
ever, to create a new standard.
Surely magazines like Sports Il
lustrated will jump at the

chance.
Perhaps it's part of human
nature to set up ideals, to look
for perfect specimens, and to
say to oneself. "I wish I looked
like that." But for women this
tendency is reinforced from the
outside until it imposes com
petitiveness and despair.
Certainly strong, healthy
women are to be emulated and
admired, but there are dozens of
ways to arrive at strength and
good health Women need not
please men, either visually or

physically, in order to do so.
Those who choose to dress,
pose, or exercise their bodies
for outside approval are per
fectly within their rights (and
their socialization), but when
the talk turns to physical types
men and women alike would do
best to exercise the vision of a
single female ideal, and to dis
courage the perpetration of
such a vision.
