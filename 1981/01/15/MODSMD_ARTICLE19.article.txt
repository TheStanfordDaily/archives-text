## Draft those with most to defend 
### 
Instead of resorting to the
usual banter of cliched pacifist
rhetoric in my argument
against registration of 18 and 19-
year-olds, I hope to offer a
viable alternative. Although ad
mittedly somewhat unconven
tional, I feel the measures I pro
pose are truly superior
strategically when all outcomes
are considered.
Acknowledging the necessity
for registration should not com
mit us to the old tradition of
singling out only young men for
induction into service. Since
modern warfare has evolved in
such a way that physical
strength is no longer essential
for many positions (as ex
emplified by Carter's original
plan to register women), the
basis for selection of our mili
tary need not be restricted to
any specific age group.
I propose instead that we pro
ceed to register another demo
graphic group which in general
share characteristics that may
prove even more practical for
defense of our nation's in
terests. I propose that instead of
the young, the "upper-class" be
drafted; specifically, a per
centage of all reasonably fit
"establishment"-types â€” pro
fessionals, bureaucrats, idle
wealthy, and of course, college
students.
Although your initial reaction
may be one of shock, or perhaps
satiric amusement, allow me to

point out the practical superior
ity of this proposition.
First, since the initial and, we
hope, only purpose of regis
tration is mobilization and an
external show of unity and pre
paredness, what better way to
appeal to the national spirit than
to register our leaders, role
models, and most influential
citizens. We'd be calling to arms
the very apostles 6f the Ameri
can way of life. What possible
gesture could do more to evoke
patriotism?
Furthermore, the very un
wontedness of the action would
frustrate the expectations of our
enemies, thus giving us a cer
tain strategic advantage.
There is also of course, some
poetic justice in the plan by
which those who had the most to
lose, (materially speaking),
would be those sacrificing the
most. This irony however, is apt
to be clouded by various ideol
ogical persuasions, so I will
plead its case purely on tactical
advantages.
The real test of this plan lies
in its functionability if worse
comes to war and the draft must
actually be effected. In this case
the advantages of calling upon
our most skilled and productive,
innovative, and cunning citizens
are self-evident. I certainly
don't mean to sound elitist, but
while money is no definite
evidence of a person's capabili
ty, there is a tendency for high
achievers to make a lot of it, so
establishing a minimum salary
criterion (say 18 or 19 thousand
dollars a year), might effective
ly draw a very highly qualified
field of potential soldiers.
Our present forces have long
despaired of the shortage of
highly trained and experienced
personel. As modern warfare
evolves into a more and more
technical endeavor, the demand
for skilled personel is bound to
climb even higher. By saturat
ing our forces with such tremen
dously qualified individuals
we'd not only completely fore
stall this problem but would
probably end up with the most
incredibly sophisticated and
competitive fighting force the
world has ever known.
Furthermore, assuming that
if the U.S. went to war in de
fense of its ideals or oil from So
viet aggression, its contest with

the world's most powerful mili
tary force would be an all in
volving endeavor, the entire
country would have to be
mobilized. Consider that during
this time of crisis, service-ori
ented and financial enterprises
(primarily white collar) would
have to be suspended while con
versely, the means of direct
production (chiefly blue collar)
would be going full throttle.
It is evident and completely
consistent with my plan, that
most of the truly expendable
manpower would be in the upper
echelons of business, finance,
etc. This temporarily displaced
class would make itself most
useful on the frontlines, while
their working class country
men kept them in supplies.
The millions of American col
lege students, for instance, are
a prime resource of dispensible
manpower and fit the bill of
youth and physical aptitude to
boot. We're the obvious choice
for front-linemen.
Thus far I have presented the
strategic benefits of drafting
the upper class in case of regis
tration and/or actual war. yet
the real beauty of this plan is
that even in the worst possible
case, it would allow for the least
traumatic defeat. Considering
the case where Russia actually
calls our bluff and we are
plunged into war, there exists
the distinct possibility that we
may suffer a humiliating and
decisive loss.
In this case, my plan is clear
ly superior in its methodical
elimination (by the morally de
fensible process of war) of the
upper class. This would allow
for a much smoother transition
of power as the largely "pro
letariat" population left in the
United States would supposedly
lend itself much better to total
itarian indoctrination than the
disposed "intellectual" class.
By putting our elite bourgeois
class on the front lines, there
would never be the need to sub
ject them so such atrocities and
genocide, dispossession,
purges, etc.
Induction of the "upper class'
may not be the perfect solution,
but I challenge anyone to come
up with a better one.
