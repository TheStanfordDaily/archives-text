Robert Swift, a Minister Counselor at the Austral
ian Embassy in Washington, D.C. criticized Ameri
can trade restricitions at the weekly World in Crisis
symposium held at CERAS yesterday.
"We (Australians) do not like the fact that you
have import restrictions on beef (which accounts for
40 percent of Australia's sales to the U. 5.)," Swift
said.
"We do not like your legal principle which asserts
that U.S. laws take precedence over the laws of oth
er countries, even in matters where these countries
have an equal or greater than equal interest."
Later in his speech, however, Swift asserted that
the "investment relationship" between the U.S. and
Australia outweighed these complaints and made
the overall relationship a good one. The U.S. has in
vested billions of dollars in Australia and is ex
pected to continue doing so. he said.
Swift also mentioned several issues of common
concern to the two countries — events in Iran, Af

ghanistan and Poland and the gap between the rich
and the poor in the Third World countries.
Harry Gelber, a professor at the University of
Tasmania in Australia, centered his speech on Aus
tralia's involvement in the world He began with a
short description of the country's economy and ge
ography. Gelber also spoke of relations with the
U.S., but described the equivalent importance of
Japan to the Australian economy. Ending his
speech, Gelber expressed his worry over the Rus
sian involvement in various countries.
Prof. Samuel McCulloch, of the University of Cal
ifornia at Irvine added a new aspect to the series of
speeches by dealing with education and immigra
tion in Australia. "Before World War II," he said,
"most people settling in Australia were English. Af
ter the war, the amount of non-English immigrants,
mostly made up of Irish, rose to 60 percent."
A member of the New Zealand Department of Sci
entific and Industrial Research, lan Donaldson

showed the strong economic and political ties be
tween Australia and New Zealand. He described the
latter country's geography and population as well.
An audience question-and-answer period followed
the four speeches.
Donaldson indicated that New Zealand's techno
logical goals for the next 10 years would center on
increasing the country's industrial potential, which
to him seemed very strong.
Speaking for Australia, Swift said that the re
covery of minerals and the study of new sources of
energy would be the most important technological
goals for the next decade. He added that "the tre
mendous exploration of minerals in the '60s and '70s
will be continued in the future and Australia is ready
to develop its energy sources".
The three Australian speakers engaged in a
lengthy discussion of their country's labor party in
response to a question. They did agree that it was
weak and showed it could not have control over the
government.
