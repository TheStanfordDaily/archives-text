# Mono, Hodgkin's possibly linked

From the Daily wire services
Boston — Children brought up
in a sheltered, upper-class en
vironment are more likely than
their scruffier friends to de
velop a form of cancer called
Hodgkin's disease when they
grow up, a study concludes.
Doctors theorize that this
kind of cancer is caused by some
common virus, and children in
fected early in life escape with a
simple infection. In an adult, the
germ is more apt to result in
Hodgkin's disease, the doctors
say.
Living with a big family in a
congested apartment where
germs spread quickly is, in this
case, more healthy, the study
shows.
Hodgkin's disease, which at
tacks the lymph nodes and other
organs, will strike 7100 people in
the United States this year, the
American Cancer Society esti
mates.
The latest study was done at
the Harvard School of Public

Health by Drs. Nancy
Gutensohn and Philip Cole. It
was published in today's issue of
the New England Journal of
Medicine.
"Persons at relatively high
risk for the disease during
young adulthood are those who
as children belonged to small
families, lived in single-family
homes, had relatively few
neighborhood playmates and
had relatively well-educated pa
rents," the researchers wrote.
These uneventful-sounding
life histories are important, say
these scientists, because they
are strikingly like those of per
sons who most often got serious
polio.
In both cases, a sanitary,
comparatively isolated child
hood evidently meant relatively
little exposure to infectious
agents and therefore little de
velopment of natural im
munities early in life. Then
when exposure does come in
late childhood or adolescence,

the results are often severe.
And, they found, "Persons at
relatively low risk are those
who belonged to large families,
were of late birth order, lived in
multiple-family dwellings
Victims are twice as likely to
be Jewish as Roman Catholic,
they said. Overall, the odds of
having Hodgkin's disease by age
39 are one in 800.
The doctors say they are not
sure what causes the form of
cancer. But they said the
evidence suggests it may be a
virus, possibly the Epstein-Barr
virus, which also causes
mononucleosis. In the study,
victims of Hodgkin's disease
were twice as likely as healthy
people to have had
mononucleosis.
Youngsters frequently are in
fected with the Epstein-Barr vi
rus. but the symptoms are so
mild that the illness may not be
noticed.
The doctors based their con
clusions on interviews with 225

people who were stricken with
Hodgkin's disease between 1973
and 1977. The 225 victims repre
sented 86 percent of all patients
with the disease between ages
15 and 39 in Boston and in
Worcester, Mass. The results
from the patients were com
pared with the experience of 447
randomly selected people.
