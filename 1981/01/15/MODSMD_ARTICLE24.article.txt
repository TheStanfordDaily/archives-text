# Touch your chin to your toes
## Students tackle Tai-chi chuan

Doug Brown can touch his chin to his shin, but
that's not far enough
Brown and about 20 other Stanford students are
working toward the day when they can touch their
chins to their toes Primarily undergraduates
with a few graduate students, the group is cur
rently studying Tai-chi Chuan under Kuo Lien
ying
Addressed as "simu" (female master) by her
students, Lien-ying is also the master instructor
at the Tai-chi Chuan Academy in San Francisco,
which her husband founded in 1965 Lien-ying said
she learned Tai-chi from her husband, who stud
ied under Wang Chou-yee, an important figure in
the lineage of Tai-chi masters.
Lien-ying said that the chin-to-toe exercise is
the real test of proficiency in Tai-chi. She travels
to Stanford twice a week to teach Tai-chi to the
group, which is seeking recognition as a club
sport.
Although the group was a club sport last quar
ter. complaints that the $40 fee for Tai-chi was too
high led to the cancellation of club status this
quarter. The fee has been reduced to $30 and
Brown, the group's tentative president, said he is
seeking to re-establish Tai-chi as a club sport for
spring quarter.
Tai-chi is less a fighting art than a non-ag
gressive, non-combative form of exercise which
conditions both mind and body. The set, per
formed by Lien-ying, incorporates slow, fluid
movements which seem to have more in common
with modern dance than such traditional martial
arts as Karate and Shao-lin Chuan.
Lien-ying said students of Tai-chi develop per
severance, are able to read longer without getting
tired, and improve their alertness level in class.
She said that the exercises must be done every day
for maximum benefit.
Tai-chi requires not only controlled motions,
but also deep and natural breathing, as well as
tranquility and great concentration. Students said
they are better rested and energetic after practic
ing the Tai-chi movements.
The "set" consists of 64 movements, which are
based on the Five Elements (metal, wood, water,
fire and earth) and the Eight Trigrams. The Five

Elements stem from yin (negative) and yang
i positivei. and the Eight Trigrams represent the
interplay of yin and yang in the order of the uni
verse Each of the Eight Trigrams forms eight
other trigrams resulting in the 64 movements of
the Tai-cjii Set.
The name Tai-chi Chuan comes from the com
bination of "tai-chi," an old Chinese philosophical
concept, and "chuan" which means fist.

Tai-chi is a form of the Chinese Martial Arts
which began thousands of years ago in China when
people observed and imitated the movements of
animals in combat. These movements were then
collected and refined into a school of martial arts
used by the Chinese and others for physical condi
tioning and self-defense.
Tai-chi belongs to the "inner" school of martial
arts, where emphasis is placed on mental concen
tration and the coordination of natural breathing
with movement, rather than the mastering of
quick movements, kicks and leaps which are
stressed in the "outer" school.
