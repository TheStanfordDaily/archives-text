## Pathetic earthlings fight back in imperially silly film 
### Steve Vineberg 
The delight of the people who
worked on the delirious comic
strip fantasy Flash Gordon is in
fectious. This movie is what
Harharella should have been;
extravagantly silly, im
aginatively kitschy — and sexy
in a ticklishjself-parodying way.
The director, Mike Hodges,
has made no attempt to stylize
his actors' movement, as Rob
ert Altman does in Popeye: the
idea here is not to approximate
the logic of a cartoon but to mine
laughs out of the contrast be
tween a clearly human set of
performers and the outer de
signs of the costumes they wear
and the sets they play against.
It's a cardboard cut-out effect.

The movie looks like a nursery
full of toys blown up to absurd
proportions; the sets are remi
niscent of the rubbery gim
micks you used to be able to
send away for with cereal box
tops; the skies above the planet
Mongo, as the talented photog
rapher Gil Taylor (Dracula) has
shot them, swirl like a kid's ex
perimental mix of oil paint and
water.
Hodges and Lorenzo Semple,
the screenwriter, create a
pastiche of elements drawn not
only from the junkyard of their
childhood, but also from other
movies. Sturdy old The Wizard
of ()z, which inspired so much of
Star Wars, shows up repeated
ly: there are metallic

Munchkins in Emperor Ming's
court, his armed guards are
winged, an hourglass marks the
time Flash — doomed to execu
tion by Ming — has left to live,
and the Wicked Witch of the
West is evoked both by the vil
lainous Kala (Mariangela
Melato) and by the demise of an
other of the characters.
Ming's daughter, Princess
Aura (Ornella Muti), has a play
thing she calls Fellini: a pouting
pet, it recalls the amorphous
ness of Giulietta Masina in some
of the roles she has played for
the real Fellini (notably in La
Strada). There is even a spoof
on The Deer Hunter. And by us
ing actors with such a variety of
accents — English, American,

Swedish, Italian, Israeli — the
movie seems to exult in a huge,
on-going in-joke: these accents
ricocheting off each other
comment on the off-kilter sound
that makes one giggle through
dubbed Japanese monster pic
tures and Italian gladiator
epics.
The roles of Flash and the
heroine, Dale Arden, have been
wittily cast. Sam J. Jones and
Melody Anderson might have
stepped out of a comic strip.
(They would have been much
funnier in Airplane! than Rob
ert Hays and Julie Hagerty.)
He is an inexpressive blond
beach bum-football star hero —
a wooden stud whose comic
erotic possibilities are explored
in one scene in which he ap
pears, dressed for his execution
in a pair of black leather shorts.
Lorenzo Semple, who created
the Batman TV series and
wrote one of the best comic strip
comedies we've ever had, the
1976 remake of King Kong (pro
duced, like Flash Gordon, by
Dino De Laurentiis), has put
some of his funniest mock
square lines in Flash's mouth.
tWhen he and Dale emerge
from a plane wreck and the
crazy scientist Zarkov, played
by Topol, asks them if they are
hurt, Flash replies, "The Lord
knows why, but it appears
not.")
Jones and Anderson are sur
rounded by skillful actors who
seem to be having the time of
their lives — Topol, Peter
Wyngarde in a gold mask as evil
Klytus, robust, roisterous Brian
Blessed as the hawkman Vul
tan. and best of all, Max Von
Sydow as Emperor Ming. He
sports the most hilarious facial
hair of the year: a long, double
pointed Vandyke, Gothic spire
eyebrows, a Fu Manchu

moustache that could be used to
bore twin holes in an enemy's
back In a movie full of phallic
imagery, his bald, elongated
dome is the supreme phallic
symbol.
Better than his appearance is
his delivery. Ming liberates a
part of Von Sydow's talent — a
rich parodistic wit — that we
don't get to see in his work for
Ingmar Bergman, which is
mostly dour, or in his fine per
formances in the Jan Troell
epics, The Emigrants and The
New Land (though there are
traces of it in the early stages of
what is perhaps his greatest
performance, in the 1966 Hawaii.
I wouldn't want to watch Von

Sydow in movies like Flash
Gordon very often, but it's
pleasant to learn that a serious
actor whose gifts you have
always admired truly does have
a sense of humor. Emperor
Ming, an Arabian Nights fiend
who glows with pride at his own
diabolical cleverness, prompts
much of our enjoyment of Flash
Cordon.
The cast, the energetic de
signs and the dialogue — as well
as a number of outrageous
flourishes, like the blue blood
that stains Ming's sword when
he kills a rebel prince — make
up for what doesn't work in the
movie. The plot construction is
sloppy, much of the staging is

clumsy, the climactic battle is
disappointing, and the music is
murderous: the title song by
Queen is so overpoweringly aw
ful (and jacked up to such an
earshattering volume) that it
almost zaps you before the film
begins.
There is one terrific image of
Flash and the hawkmen flying
through a red-orange sky, but
nothing that compares to the
best scenes in De Laurentiis's
King Kong — the scenes be
tween Kong and Jessica Lange,
in which pop art fantasy is taken
to such an extreme that it ac
quires a bizarre poignancy.
Flash Gordon is just silly — im
perially silly.


Dale (Melody Anderson) cheers while Flash (Sam J. Jones) eludes Ming's henchmen.
