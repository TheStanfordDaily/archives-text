# What the butler saw at dinner
## 
### Stephen Nash 
In an unusual example of dinner theatre,
the Collective Theatre in collaboration with
the Balkan Village restaurant in Mountain
View is putting on Joe Orton's last play,
What the Butler Saw. The entertainment at
the Balkan Village normally consists of a
belly-dancer as well as a Greek strongman,
so a shocking farce by a 1960s British play
wright could be considered a little out of
character. Every Sunday evening, the Col
lective Theatre takes the place over for
their productions (this is their second —
Lysistrata was produced there last sum
mer).
Since this is a collaborative effort, I feel I
ought to make a few comments about the ex
tra-theatrical features of the evening before
mentioning the play. The restaurant opens
for business at 5:30, and a Greek-style buf
fet is served. There are not a great many
dishes, but they are tasty, even if they are
not what I would call startling. I am rather
fond of Spanakopita (a form of spinach pie
using filo pastry), so I was quite satisfied
with the meal. (I should point out that my
qualifications for restaurant reviewing are
minimal.) At 7:00. four singers appeared to
entertain the audience until the play began.
Back to theatre. Before his untimely

death in 1969 (his lover bashed him over the
head with a hammer), Orton wrote a
number of plays which were designed, at
least in part, to be extremely shocking. In
spite of the way they affront the audience,
the plays gradually gained in popularity,
and What the Butler Saw was in fact first
produced in London's West End with Ralph
Richardson in the role of Dr. Ranee.
Unfortunately, like many plays designed
to shock specific audiences, this play has
dated rather badly, especially for audiences
in the Bay Area. Such topics as trans
vestism and incest, rather than being
risque, are now the stuff of our daily news
papers. In addition, Orton's extended
criticisms of the psychiatric profession
have been so often repeated that they have
lost much of their edge.
Luckily, Orton was a master of farce, and
the gradual and inevitable buildup of
absurdity easily saves the play from being
of mere historical interest. A description of
the plot would take up many columns, and I
won't even attempt one here. It really
doesn't matter, though. The story is crazy,
hilarious, and unpredictable — all that the
genre of farce demands.
In this production (directed by Peter
Buckley), all of the roles are acted in an ex

aggerated comic style, which I would con
sider a break with tradition. This is effec
tive at the end of the play, when the action is
so wild that nothing much else would be ap
propriate. But in the first two-thirds of the
play, 1 feel that a very naturalistic set of
performances is desired. During act one es
pecially, much of the humor comes from the
contrast of the respectability of the charac
ters with the outrageousness of the
dialogue. With stylized acting, the speeches
become just another aspect of the charac
ter's unusual personality and cease to have
an independent comic effect.
To be fair, the exaggerated acting is often
effective. Stephen Coyle (as Dr. Ranee)
gives a John Cleese-like performance which
I very much enjoyed. Also, for the smaller
roles of Sgt. Match (Daniel Maloney) and
Geraldine (Christina Zimmerman), the
idea works well since the play itself offers
little justification for their sometimes
bizarre actions.
1 had a pleasant time at the Balkan Vil
lage last Sunday. I went because I was
amazed that anyone would consider Joe Or
ton appropriate for dinner theatre. I hope
that the Collective Theatre continues to ex
pand that form with plays as controversial
and as challenging as this.
