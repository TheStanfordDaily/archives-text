# Senate accepts final report
## 
### Kimberly Brown 
During a lengthy first meeting of
the quarter last night, the ASSU Sen
ate rejected a Rules Committee pro
posal for filling vacant senate seats
and accepted the final report by the
Task Force on Contemporary Enter
tainment — including the recommen
dation that a committee be set up to
design a "formal entertainment
project."
The senate also approved two de
cisions made by the Finance Commit
tee Monday — first, that a recommen
dation to set up an ASSU review board
be stricken from the report and sec
ond, that the task force produce a spe
cific project feasibility study within
five weeks.
Gary Reiff, Chairman of the Fi
nance Committee, explained the
feasibility study as an "explanation of
exactly what systems and facilities
they would use in putting together a
project." The plan will cover struc
tural organization, financial re
sources, facilities on campus, and res
olutions of problems outlined in the re
port.
The Task Force on Contemporary
Entertainment was established this
fall in order to investigate the ASSU's
ability for providing contemporary
entertainment on campus. In particu
lar, the group delved into the opera
tion of the past Special Events
project, which was discontinued after
incurring a $92,000 deficit from
1978-79.
The extensive final report con
cluded it is "charting a difficult
course" but "firmly believes there
are creative and constructive ways"
to overcome the problems.
Plan rejected
Following extensive debate, the
senate also rejected a proposed plan to
fill vacant senate seats by appoint
ments made through the Nominations
Committee. The plan, as outlined by
the Rules Committee, recommended
that certain provisions ensuring the
"speedy and orderly" replacement of
senators be added to the ASSU By-
Laws.
Currently, methods for replacing
COP members, senate officers, the
Student Financial Manager and
project managers are defined. How
ever, the "service of a fully staffed
senate at all times" is not ensured,
and the defeated proposal was an at
tempt to add similar guidelines for re
placement of senate members.
Specific arguments against the
measure included mention that the al
ternate system should be the means

through which senate vacancies are
filled, and that the ASSU cannot ap
point members to an elective office
Favors proposal
Senator Ted Mitchell spoke in favor
of the proposal saying that, "a vacan
cy in the alternate body is, in fact, a
vacancy in the senate." Mitchell, a
graduate student, viewed the problem
from two different angles — "the gen
eral issue and the specific issue "
He maintained that the specific
aspect is of immediate importance,
since there are three vacant graduate
seats in the senate. The problem has
been carrying over for five meetings
now and is "detrimental to the senate
as a whole," Mitchell said.
Senator Sue Goldfarb also sup

ported the measure, commenting,
"What we're doing here is denying
ourselves." She said selections by the
Nominations Committee would serve
to guarantee that replacements are
truly interested in serving
Following the proposal's defeat,
Mitchell raised a motion for an im
mediate special election to fill the
three vacant graduate student seats in
the senate However, the motion was
voted down almost unanimously.
It was also suggested that graduate
senate seats should be apportioned to
graduate departments on the basis of
enrollment. Past proposals for re
districting will be examined and vari
ous departmental student groups ap
proached before the proposal is sub
mitted at the end of the month.
