# 'Buddha' inscrutable

### Stephen Nash 
p I I saw Martin Epstein's new
play The Man Who Killed the
Buddha at the Magic Theatre
last Thursday night 1 suppose I
Icould have gone to see Camelot
or something at the ACT in
stead, but my tastes lean to
small theatre. As it was, I de
| cided on Fort Mason, saw the
play, then went to Henry
Africa's for a drink (my compa
nion had never been to a fern
I bar, and I couldn't think of a bet
(!■ ter place for his initiation into

the intriguing world of San
Francisco singles' bars; over a
screwdriver, he fell in love with
Sandy, one of their beguilingly
pretty waitresses; unfortunate
ly, I couldn't introduce them).
During the play, Kenji spends
19 years polishing a statue of the
Buddha that he cannot see. He
uses a beautiful green scarf
made of the finest silk, deco
rated with delicate pictures of
Japanese shrines, which his
mother gave him and which his
teacher, Misou Roshi, tries to

take away from him. Oblivious
to the passing years, he polishes
with great flair, often making
fascinating arabesques with his
shadows on the paper walls of
the Doji Shrine. He is seeking
enlightenment and bliss, so he
doesn't mind polishing the dust
in the air — it is a much greater
challenge than polishing a vase
as Majiama does.
Majiama is Misou Roshi's
servant. At the end of the day,
when he is all done with his
work, Majiama likes to light up
a cigarette and look into the
smoke to see what the oracles
can tell him about the adventure
that lies in his future. Today
they tell him of Mount Fuji, of
following the sound of the wind
to a woman, a naked woman
bound wrist and ankle by chains,
who is begging him to save her
from the horrible monster. Un
fortunately, Majiama cannot
set off on his adventure until he
gets a pair of sneakers. So Kenji
gives him his sneakers, and Ma
jiama leaves the shrine to be
come a man of passion.
Ouushoo, Kenji's boyhood
friend, visits the shrine, too. He
comes to tell Kenji that he is
now a successful fisherman and
that he has has married Kenshi,
Kenji's fiancee. Ouushoo tries
out his practical jokes on Kenji
and then leaves to go make
some more money.
Misou Roshi also likes to
make money, but he does it by
turning Kenji into a sideshow
act. The American tourists are
amazed that anyone would be
stupid enough to spend 19 years
polishing a statue that no one
can see. So one of them (a used
car salesman) asks Kenji why
he does it.
This sets Kenji thinking. He
tries to explain to the tourists,
and to himself, the reason why
he has polished the dust in the
air for such a long time. But just
then Kenshi, recently widowed,
visits the shrine and involves
Kenji in an animalistic and sex
ual dance. After she leaves,
Kenji gets angry and shoots his
arrow at the invisible statue.
Miraculously the Buddha ap
pears, with the arrow in his
forehead. Kenji tries to strangle
him, but that doesn't kill him
either. The Buddha just laughs

as Kenji screams and runs
away.
The whole play is put together
out of metaphors. The location
is ostensibly the Doji Shrine in
Japan, but the costumes are not
authentic — Ouushoo looks like
a prohibition-era Chicago
gangster — and the action might
just as well take place in San
Francisco. Nineteen years go by
in the course of the play, but it
could easily be six weeks or 80
minutes or whatever; a gong is
sounded from time to time, but
that contributes more to the
mood than to our perception of
time. The American tourists are

puppets. I guess Epstein is
saying that we are all puppets of
some metaphorical Buddha,
trying to fashion our own indi
vidual enlightenments at our
own pace in our own clumsy
ways.
John Finch as Kenji gives sta
bility to the whole affair by leav
ing his character unchanged un
'til near the end of the play. This
allows Epstein (who directed as
well as wrote Buddha) to orna
ment the plot with long,
elaborately choreographed fan
tasies without losing contact
with the basic story. Michael
Grodenchik's evocative and

energetic performance of Ma
nama's story is just one of these
narrative detours.
My favorite performers were
the puppets (designed by Elaine
McKeen and manipulated by Ira
Flushmann and others). They
come closest to the oriental ide
al of suppressing personal idio
syncrasies in order to better
fulfill a role in life. They are
also very funny.
The uncluttered sets (by
Michael Lynch) and the gentle
lighting (by Kurt Landisman)
add to the oriental mood of the
play. They are both stable pres

ences upon which Epstein is
able to effectively develop his
decorative flourishes.
I expect many of you are wait
ing for me to say whether this is
a good play. Make up your own
mind. The story is uneventful
but elaborately decorated. The
characters change very little,
but this serves to give the play
stability. The play offers no
simple moral, and just ends
with the Buddha laughing (at
the audience as much as at Ken
ji). I am no oracle; I don't know
your tastes. Decide for yourself
if you want to go to the Magic
Theatre to see it.
