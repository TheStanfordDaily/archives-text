Common knowledge to the
contrary, labels, those often
denigrated word-forms, are im
portant. The key principle here
is that in order to name a thing,
one must also recognize its op
posite or absence. For instance:
what would Mrs. Spratt be
without her husband?; perhaps
the Dark Ages wouldn't have
been so mediocre had they not
been preceded by Antiquity;
and if one did not have labels
like "punky" or "funky" or
even ' 'jazzy" lurking around the
anonymous middle pages of
thesauruses, one would not be
able to describe James "Blood"
(his given nickname) Ulmer as
a musician who defies catego
rization.
So who is this "Blood" fel
low? A guitarist, Mr. "Blood"
paid his dues as a sideman for
Ornette Coleman among others
and is essentially coming out of
a jazz tradition. But as leader of
his own group, Mr. "Blood" ar
rived at the Keystone Palo Alto
last Friday night by way of
some New York night spots,
where he achieved cult popu
larity, which are better known
for rock and roll of the short
haired type.
Yet Mr. "Blood" is not mere
ly the next in a long string of
precious new things. What's
fascinating about his music, and
what has lead to his relative suc
cess (how many avant-gardeists
make it to the home of the Fat
Fry?) is that the compositions
are very demanding and
challenging while at the same

time being fairly accesible — a
physics class taught by the
communications department.
Mr. "Blood's" solos are as free
and counter-melodic as any
thing in current jazz, but at the
same time his backing musi
cians, Amin Ali on bass and
Ronald Shannon Jackson on
drums, provide a solid rock
rhythm and blues base which
gave those solos something to
bounce off of, something which
helped them to be located and
listened to.
Of course this is not to say
that Ali and Jackson were
clunking noxiously along like a
John Paul Jones and a John
Bonham. On the contrary —
these two mixed it up con
siderably, changing rhythms
and chords but always with a
mind to the whole; the music
always held together, the three
instruments blending together
instead of forming either the
more usual solo-backup hier
archies or the more unusual
chaos of free jazz. If this is
"fusion" music, it's a fusion of
the gutsiest riffs from rock with
the most exciting experiments
of modern jazz.
Most amazingly though, Mr.
"Blood's" sound was dan
ceable. Sort of. At least arm
swinging was possible, which is
more than the foot-tapping and
head-shaking that jazz usually
elicits. The crowd, in fact,
swung many a long arc, seem
ingly dazed at times, but cer
tainly not comatose. And a
dazed audience is not a bad
thing.
