Begin coalition delays vote
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin s gov
ernment, on the brink of collapse, prolonged its life yester
day by delaying a final decision on whether to call early
elections until next week.
Begin has openly supported early elections, but aides
said leaders of his Likud Party were seeking to broaden
their parliamentary base to allow the government to com
plete its term until November.
Begin's government was left without a a majority in Is
rael's 120-seat Knesset (parliament) when Finance Min
ister Yigael Hurvitz resigned Sunday and pulled his three
man Rafi party out of the ruling coalition.
Housing Minister David Levy, leading the drive to
salvage the government, claimed to have as many as four
more independents who would back the government if it
decided against early elections, giving it more than the
needed majority.
But Begin's aides said the prime minister would not ac
cept Levy's plan unless it guaranteed him a "stable and
representative majority" in the Knesset independent of
free-floating members who would demand constant politi
cal payoffs.
Hardliners in Begin's coalition fear an incoming Labor
government would bargain away parts of the territory in
return for peace with Jordan. Israel captured the West
Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War
New Polish labor protests
Warsaw, Poland — Demands for an independent
farmers' union and workfree Saturdays fueled Poland's la
bor unrest yesterday as workers struck near the Soviet
border and draped Warsaw buses with placards and Polish
flags.
In Rzeszow. about 40 miles from the Soviet frontier, em
ployees laid down their tools in a two-hour warning strike
to support private farmers' demands for a union independ
ent of Communist Party control.
A Solidarity spokesman said the job action went peace

fully with no interference by police Asked whether
further action was planned, he said, "I cannot discuss it
We shall inform you."
Solidarity, which claims some 10 million members,
threatened new strikes over the workweek issue.
"Employees cannot be deprived of part of their pay (for
Saturday absence)." the union said "In case of reprisals
we shall answer with a strike "
Solidarity contends the government agreed to a five
day. 40-hour work week in settling last summer's strikes,
which gave rise to the first independent labor organiza
tions in the Soviet Bloc.
The government acknowledges it agteed to the new
schedule, but says it should be implemented over a five
year period so as not to further damage the already-rav
aged economy.
Robinson to pilot Giants
San Francisco — Frank Robinson got his second chance
to manage in the big leagues yesterday and said he hopes
to guide the San Francisco Giants up to the top in the Na
tional League West.
"1 don't look for that to happen overnight, and I don't
think anyone in the organization expects it to happen over
night. but I think in time it will happen." Robinson said at a
news conference called to announce his hiring.
Robinson who was major league baseball's first black
manager during a 2-year stint at Cleveland, "clearly
emerged as the top choice for the job," said Bob Lurie,
Giant's owner Other leading candidates included ex-man
agers Dick Howser. Bob Lemon. Del Crandall and Gene
Mauch.
T think Frank will have the ability to earn the respect of
the players and fans in a very short time," said Lurie
"And I think he can bring back a winning tradition to the
Giants that is desparately needed."
Carter warns US in farewell
Washington — President Jimmy Carter bid farewell to

the nation yesterday night with a solemn warning that the
danger of nuclear annihilation is growing and the selfish
desires of special interests are assuming strong influence
over American political life.
In his last scheduled speech from the Oval Office,
Carter said "Democracy is an unfinished creation,'' and
offered his updated interpretation of the most oft-quoted
passage from the Declaration of Independence:
•For this generation," Carter said, "life is nuclear sur
vival ; liberty is human rights; the pursuit of happiness is a
planet whose resources are devoted to the physical and
spiritual nourishment of its inhabitants."
Without rekindling the debate that marked his cam
paign against Ronald Reagan, Carter said the American
people must never shrink from the struggle for human
rights, to protect the environment and to control nuclear
weapons — all areas where he differs from Reagan.
Carter did not mention the American hostages still held
in Iran or the economy, two burning issues that helped
bring down his presidency.
The outgoing president expressed gratitude to the
American people "because you gave me this ex
traordinary opportunity to serve." He never mentioned
their overwhelming rejection of his leadership at the polls
last Nov. 4.
'Wary' OK on Chrysler loan
Washington — The Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board
granted conditional approval yesterday night for the tot
tering automaker's application for $400 million more in
government loan guarantees.
The board's approval was conditioned on ratification by
members of the United Auto Workers of wage concessions
totalling $622 million and presentation by Chrysler of
agreements to convert about $500 million in outstanding
loans and to pay off another $500 million at 30 cents on the
dollar in installment — effectively cancelling about $350
million in debts.
Other conditions call for Chrysler to commit itself to
"all possible steps" to a merger or other means of raising
new capital; to present approval from its suppliers of $36
million in additional concessions and to promise to try to
get an equal amount in 1981; and for the UAW to agree to
take the company's shaky finances into consideration in
future contracts.
East still in grip of cold
New York — Canadian cold zapped Florida again yes
terday.and Massachusetts appealed for more fuel to keep
warm while weathermen warned that a cold wave in the
East is not going away anytime soon.
At least 44 deaths in 14 states — not counting traffic fa
talities — have been blamed on the frigid weather that
swept down from the arctic regions at Christmastime.
Record low temperatures in Florida this week are sure
to push up the supermarket price of orange juice and vege
tables, officials said as they toted up the damage from the
third frigid night in a row in the Sunshine State.
Massachusetts Gov. Edward King, who earlier urged
residents of the Boston area to turn down their
thermostats to at least 63 degrees or risk the closings of
schools and factories, said yesterday he would ask Presi-

dent Jimmy Carter to allocate more natural gas to the
state.
City to seed Sierra clouds
San Francisco — The San Francisco Public Utilities
Commission has decided to seed clouds over the Sierra Ne
vada in an effort to bring more rain to reservoirs which
serve the city.
The commission voted yesterday to spend $75,000 to
seed clouds near the Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite
National Park.
Rainfall has been only a third of normal this year in the
Tuolumne Hiver watershed, a water source for San Fran
cisco. Alameda and San Mateo counties.
Only 4.79 inches of rain have fallen around the Hetch
Hetchy this season, compared to a normal 13.38 inches, ac
cording to reservoir general manager Dean Coffee. But he
said the Hetch Hetchy and other reservoirs are still full
due to late snowpack runoff last year.
UAW makes 'final offer'
Washington — The United Auto Workers union made its
"final offer" to help save the struggling Chrysler Corp. as
yesterday's deadline neared for action on new government
loan guarantees for the company.
Don Stillman, the Union Secretary, refused to describe
the offer or say whether it met the company's $673 million
target for sacrifices from workers, saying, "Obviously
our goal is to do the minimal necessary to satisfy the sec
retary."
There was no immediate response from Chrysler of
ficials
Stillman s use of the word "minimal" echoed the term
used Tuesday by Treasury Secretary William Miller,
chairman of the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board, to char
acterize the assistance Chrysler was seeking from the un
ion.
Nobody in authority is saying what will happen if
Chrysler, which received $800 million in loan guarantees
last year, is turned down by the board. But most analysts
expect the company would seek protection from creditors
under the federal bankruptcy law.
Stocks in small advance
The stock market recorded a small advance yesterday
amid cross-currents of optimism and caution about the in
terest rate outlook.
Oil issues were particularly strong at the outset, but
their gains faded as the session passed.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 7
points at its best level of the day, finished at 966.47,
plus-1.37 from Tuesday's close Big Board volume totaled
41.39 million shares.
