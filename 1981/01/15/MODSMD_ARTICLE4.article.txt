# Iran moves closer to a decision on the hostages
## 
### Associated Press 
The Iranian Parliament passed an
emergency bill yesterday designed to
remove one obstacle to release of the
52 American hostages, and the chief
Iranian negotiator said "we are going
to release the hostages in the coming
two or three days or try them."
With the Carter administration's
deadline for agreement only two days
away, the Iranian Parliament ap
proved a measure to authorize third
country arbitration of conflicting
U.S.-Iranian financial claims. The ac
tion to set up neutral arbitration was
seen as an Iranian move to open the
way for an accord to exchange the
hostages for frozen Iranian assets.
But despite the government's urg
ing. Parliament delayed until Sunday
consideration of another measure to
formally "nationalize" the wealth of
the late shah and the royal family.
Behzad Nabavi, Iran's chief nego
tiator in the 14-month hostage crisis,
told Parliament members their fail
ure to act would delay return of the
shah's wealth to Iran. But he Rave no
indication that approval of that bill
was necessary before an agreement
with the United States could be
reached.
Two or three days
Nabavi forecast a decision in two or
three days on release of the hostages,
but said that without an agreement
there might be new demands in Iran
for trials of some hostages on spy
charges.

A spokesman for the Majlis (Par
liament i told The Associated Press in
Beirut in a telephone interview that
the government "will decide on the
future of the American hostages'' to
day or tomorrow.
President Jimmy Carter leaves of
fice on Jan 20, and if there is no agree
ment President-elect Ronald Reagan
will inherit the hostage crisis.
A U.S. negotiating team remained
in Algiers, working through Algerian
intermediaries in an attempt to get
Iranian agreement to American terms
for unfreezing about $9 5 billion in Ira
nian assets and placing them in an
escrow account.
Expectations
In Washington there were expecta
tions that an Iranian reply would be re
ceived soon, but State Department
spokesman John Trattner said some
"fundamental questions" remain un
resolved.
A senior Carter administration of
ficial, who asked not to be identified,
said the Iranian Parliament's action
"doesn't tell us what their final posi
tion would be. What we expect is that,
in a day or so. sooner rather than later,
they will come to us with a reply.''
The official said: "Let's hope it is
something close to what we can ac
cept. and we'll get a deal." He said the
bill on arbitration enacted by the Par
liament removed an obstacle the Ira
nians had placed in the path of an
