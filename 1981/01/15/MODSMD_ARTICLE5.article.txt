# Socialist speaks on Reagan, future of left
## 
### Brad Crystal 
Socialist leader and author Michael
Harrington last night called on Ameri
cans to band together to oppose Presi
dent-elect Ronald Reagan, whose poli
cies, he said, "range from the inade
quate to the desperate.
"We on the left are at a time of
enormous danger but also enormous
opportunity," Harrington told the
crowd of about 200 in Kresge
Auditorium.
Harrington was one of three speak
ers to take part in the program en
titled "Political and Economic Crises
in America: A Progressive Analysis
and Strategy for the '80s." It was the
first in a weekly series of presenta
tions called "What Now America?
Progressive Alternatives for the '80s
sponsored by the Stanford
Progressive Alliance and the Stanford
Committee on Political Education.
"1 believe a majority of the Ameri
can people support social services and
they can win" when Reagan moves to
phase them out, Harrington said.
Grass-roots approach
He suggested a grass-roots ap
proach to ensure protection of social
welfare programs such as food stamps
and to find ways to solve the simulta
neous problems of inflation and un
employment.
Americans must "get the people

who are affected by decisions (to)
make the decisions," he said.
It is the responsibility of concerned
radicals to communicate their goals
by reaching out to "average people,"
he added
One way of doing this, he noted,
would be to distribute bumper stickers
listing 5-10 demands such as "Don't let
them give away the country."
According to Harrington. "That's
what Reagan plans to do â€” give (the
country to the rich."
The second speaker was Sue
Bessmer, a professor of women's
studies at San Francisco State Univer
sity. who has been a calling herself a
Marxist for 12 years. She said that con
sciousness-raising must go hand-in
hand with commitment.
"The left is good at offering robust
analyses of the problems that beset us,
but we are not as good about listening
to the needs of ordinary people with
ordinary problems," a trend she
labeled a "real political mistake."
Change institutions
Harrington called the current eco
nomical, political and social situation
a crisis as profound as that of the
Great Depression, and he said it will
only be resolved if "we change institu
tions.
"We are not on the eve of a revolu
tion" he noted, but we are about to be

gin "a process that will change society
as profoundly as the '305," he said.
The November 1980 election, said
Harrington, was a "fundamental turn
ing point" in that it marked the "end
of Rooseveltian liberalism" which has
been accepted dogma to Republicans
and Democrats alike since 1932.
Despite the tremendous role the
government played in the implemen
tation of the New Deal, Harrington
contended that the substance of the
New Deal did not challenge the "cor
porate infrastructure" which domi
nates America.
The result of that approach has been
disastrous for the economy, he said.
Oil companies
He blamed the oil companies not
only for the "destruction" of mass
transit and the railroads but also for

the American dependence on foreign
supplies of energy.
"The economic system is in a
shambles," and that more than any
other factor resulted in the defeat of
President Jimmy Carter, he said.
He said Carter "deserved to lose"
because the "economy was mis
managed for four years.
"Once the people realized Ronald
Reagan was not a complete nut. they
voted for him because his name wasn't
Jimmy Carter," he said.
Besides noting the economic and po
litical crisis. Harrington spoke of a
"social, spiritual and religious crisis"
which has led to the erosion and trivi
alization of basic values, and
"scapegoating Moral Majority fanat

speaker of the evening .urged citizens
to shift control of employment and in

He said democracy must be ex

economic arena.
"Business has mucked it up," he
said.
As an alternative Carnoy said public
corporations should be created to
compete with private enterprise and
"demystify what business is doing."
