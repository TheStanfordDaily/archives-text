## More weapons arrive in El Salvador, hundreds die 
### Washington Post 
San Salvador, El Salvador — The Salvadoran
army is beginning to show signs of strain in the
face of the five-day-old leftist offensive here.
Of the military's 10 French-made Alouette and
Lama helicopters, only two are still flying At
least one was shot down by guerrillas near the
Guatemalan border last week, according to of
ficial sources, another was damaged over the
province of Morazan and the rest are suffering
from lack of spare parts and maintenance as they
have been in continuous use.
The guerrillas claim to have downed three.
At the same time the leftists are using ever
more sophisticated weapons in ever greater quan
tities.
U.S. 'Ups the ante'
The U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, Robert
White, who has consistently opposed "upping the
ante'' here by renewing and increasing U.S. mili
tary aid — especially since its suspension last
month amid allegations that Salvadoran soldiers
were involved in the murder of four American
women — said Tuesday that such aid may be
necesssary at this point.
"I am very concerned about the obvious in
crease in supplies to the guerrillas from the out
side which seems to threaten escalation on the
part of the extreme left," White said.
Despite the claims of the Salvadoran govern
ment that the guerrilla push has been controlled,
sporadic fighting continues nationwide. The
towns of San Francisco Gotera to the northeast
and Zacatecoluca to the south were the scenes of
major confrontations Tuesday morning, accord
ing to military spokesmen, and there was brief
fighting in the barrios of San Salvador again Tues
day.
There is still no substantial evidence, however,
that the people of El Salvador are willing to rise
up en masse behind the guerrillas. A general
strike called by the Revolutionary Democratic
Front Monday night thus far has garnered only
half-hearted support, at least in the capital, where
most shops and factories were open and most

buses running by early Tuesday afternoon.
Fears remain in the U.S. embassy that a re
newal of U S. military aid will appear as an en
dorsement of the brutality shown by the
Salvadoran armed forces, but as the fighting be
comes more open and extensive here that has be
come something less of a preoccupation.
More worrisome to some officials is the possi
bility that supplying sophisticated equipment
which requires the presence of U.S. personnel for
training and maintenance will lead to increasing
and increasingly direct U.S. involvement in the
conflict.
"It could shift the whole emphasis of the
thing." one diplomat said recently. "They (the
Salvadoran military) have been doing their own
jobs up to now. But this could make them more
and more dependent on U.S. technical advisers.
That's what happened in southeast Asia."
The situation here is still very uncertain, espe
cially in the countryside. The offensive is only 72
hours old and the guerrillas — under the command
of the National Liberation Front and using hit
and-run tactics — are reported to be holding many
of their forces in reserve. It is not clear why.
Thousands dying
But the cost to El Salvador already has been
high. Reliable figures are not available but unof
ficial estimates of casualties over the weekend,
including many civilians, run high into the hun
dreds. Those figures are in addition to an esti
mated 10.000 people who died at the hands of ex
tremist leftist and rightist terrorists and the
armed forces last year before the real civil war
actually began.
Monday three journalists were injured by what
was apparently a guerrilla-laid mine in a remote
rural area to the north of the capital. One of the
journalists. South African lan Mates, a camer
aman with the United Press International tele
vision network, died Tuesday from head wounds.
Two American photographers who were with him
but less seriously injured, John Hoagland, 33, and
Susan Meiselas. 32, were flown to Miami Tuesday
for further treatment and observation.

part of the extreme left," White said.
Despite the claims of the Salvadoran govern
ment that the guerrilla push has been controlled,
sporadic fighting continues nationwide. The
towns of San Francisco Gotera to the northeast
and Zacatecoluca to the south were the scenes of
major confrontations Tuesday morning, accord
ing to military spokesmen, and there was brief
fighting in the barrios of San Salvador again Tues
day.
There is still no substantial evidence, however,
that the people of El Salvador are willing to rise
up en masse behind the guerrillas. A general
strike called by the Revolutionary Democratic
Front Monday night thus far has garnered only
half-hearted support, at least in the capital, where
most shops and factories were open and most

buses running by early Tuesday afternoon.
Fears remain in the U.S. embassy that a re
newal of U S. military aid will appear as an en
dorsement of the brutality shown by the
Salvadoran armed forces, but as the fighting be
comes more open and extensive here that has be
come something less of a preoccupation.
More worrisome to some officials is the possi
bility that supplying sophisticated equipment
which requires the presence of U.S. personnel for
training and maintenance will lead to increasing
and increasingly direct U.S. involvement in the
conflict.
"It could shift the whole emphasis of the
thing." one diplomat said recently. "They (the
Salvadoran military) have been doing their own
jobs up to now. But this could make them more
and more dependent on U.S. technical advisers.
That's what happened in southeast Asia."
The situation here is still very uncertain, espe
cially in the countryside. The offensive is only 72
hours old and the guerrillas — under the command
of the National Liberation Front and using hit
and-run tactics — are reported to be holding many
of their forces in reserve. It is not clear why.
Thousands dying
But the cost to El Salvador already has been
high. Reliable figures are not available but unof
ficial estimates of casualties over the weekend,
including many civilians, run high into the hun
dreds. Those figures are in addition to an esti
mated 10.000 people who died at the hands of ex
tremist leftist and rightist terrorists and the
armed forces last year before the real civil war
actually began.
Monday three journalists were injured by what
was apparently a guerrilla-laid mine in a remote
rural area to the north of the capital. One of the
journalists. South African lan Mates, a camer
aman with the United Press International tele
vision network, died Tuesday from head wounds.
Two American photographers who were with him
but less seriously injured, John Hoagland, 33, and
Susan Meiselas. 32, were flown to Miami Tuesday
for further treatment and observation.
