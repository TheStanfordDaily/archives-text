### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw, Poland â€” Soviet Marshal Victor
Kulikov, commander of Warsaw Pact
forces, and a delegation of supporting of
ficers. made a surprise visit to Polish politi
cal leaders Tuesday.
Coming at a time when the Polish Com
munist Party and government had shown
signs of taking a tougher stand against the
growth of independent unions in both the in
dustrial and farming sectors of the econo
my, the visit was seen by Western experts
as a new vote of confidence by Moscow in
the Warsaw leadership.
The evening television news program
showed a brief scene of Kulikov meeting
with Communist Party Chief Stanislaw
Kania, Prime Minister Jozef Pinkowski and
Polish Chief of Staff Wojeich Jaruzelski.
Giving no details of the meeting, which
had not been announced in advance, the
Polish news agency PAP said the visit took
place in a "cordial and friendly" at
mosphere.
The timing of the visit not only coincided
with the tougher line taken by the govern
ment againsjt the new non-Communist trade
unions organized under the name of Solidar
ity but also with the visit of the union chief.
Lech Walesa, to Pope John Paul II in Rome.
On television, the Polish audience saw on
one hand the ruling party and government
supported by its allies from Moscow and the
six-months-old challenging labor force
backed by the Polish-born spiritual head of
the Roman Catholic Church, long the chief
opposition to the party in Poland.
Earlier, it was learned that local police

for the second time in two days had used
force against a group of demonstrators
seeking recognition for their Solidarity
farmer's union and evicted them from a
town hall.
The new action took place in Ultryki
Dolne. a small town in southeast Poland
close to the Soviet border.
According to a spokesman for Solidarity,
six plainclothes policemen supported by 20
men in riot gear and another 200 policemen
in reserve expelled 60 demonstrators who
had been staging a sit-in at the town hall
since Dec. 29 to protest what they termed
harassment and corruption by local of
ficials.
The demonstration was supported by oth
er protesters in nearby towns and industrial
workers in the Krakow region.
On Sunday, in the first direct force used
against the Solidarity group since the labor
movement began last summer, police re
moved demonstrators from the town hall of
Novy Sacz. southeast of Krakow.
A union spokesman said workers in about
100 agricultural product factories in the re
gion had an hour at midday Tues
day to protest the police actions.
In Krakow, a Solidarity spokesman ac
cused the police of "brutai repression" and
of taking "reprisals against families of
those who took part in the protest." The un
ion gave no more details on the police ac
tion. and said that no one had been arrested
or hurt The union has asked for an in
vestigation of the police actions.
In Gdansk, a Baltic port and national

headquarters for Solidarity, a spokesman
indicated that the union would issue a
statement on police actions, but later re
tracted his words. The union apparently was
reluctant to take a position with Walesa and
most of the top Solidarity leaders in
Rome.
In Warsaw, a professor at the Institute for
Agricultural Economy told journalists that
there was a split among farmers seeking to
form a union allied with Solidarity.
One union, which calls itself Rural Soli
darity, representing workers on state
farms, cooperatives and individual private
farm owners, has signed up about 1 million
members. It was this union that encouraged
the town hall sit-in demonstrations and
which is waiting a high court decision on its
application for a legal charter.
Another group, known as the Independent
Trade Union of Private Farmers Solidarity,
represents only individual landowners. It
has signed up 600,000 members and will app
ly for a charter to gain official recognition
from the government.
The two unions have the same basic set of
bylaws but differed on political aims and
tactics, Prof. Gabriel Janowski said.
The private farmers do not believe in the
use of strikes or demonstrations to press
their demands but might use other methods,
such as refusing to pay taxes, he said.
Both unions were recognized by the
Gdansk Solidarity headquarters, Janowski
added. "It is possible the two unions will
merge," he said.
