# Political battles may determine outcome of war
## Iran's offensive ends in stalemate 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beirut, Lebanon — One week
after Iran launched its long-her
alded counteroffensive in the
Persian Gulf war with Iraq, the
campaign appears to have
ground to a halt with only minor
gains, according to reports
reaching Arab diplomats here.
Iran claimed over the week
end that its army has crossed

into Iraqi territory west of Gilan
Gharb. about 95 miles east of
Baghdad. But there was no con
firmation of the report, and
diplomats cautioned that
almost every official claim in
this war — from either side —
has proven to be either inflated
or utterly unfounded.
"We have seen nothing to in
dicate that heavy fighting was
going on at the scale both sides
were claiming," a diplomat
from one of the Arab countries
along the Persian Gulf said.
"Everybody was claiming
breakthroughs and victories,
but there was no evidence. Now
even the communiques (the dai
ly military reports issued by
both Tehran and Baghdad) are
calming down, and we presume
the war is, too."
Several diplomats and other
analysts cautioned that they
have seen no independent first
hand reports from the battle
zone — only second-hand ac
counts gathered in the capitals
of Iran and Iraq, highly colorful
but equally dubious tales issued
by the two governments, and
fragmentary data from Soviet
and U.S. surveillance satellites.
Little reliability
"We really have very little re
liable information," an Arab
analyst said.
What intelligence is available
suggests that the Iranians
launched several attacks last
week from their troop positions
around Dezful in the foothills of
the Zagros Mountains about 135
miles north of the oil port of
Abadan.
One column apparently rolled
south toward the main
Khuzestan battlefront and the
town of Susangerd. which both
the Iraqis and the Iranians
claim to hold. A second force
took advantage of the terrain

along the western border of
Iran's Ilam province, where the
Zagros range overlooks Iraq's
Mesopotamian plain, and
moved down toward the fron
tier, the diplomats said.
The Iranians have successful
ly held, and perhaps even re
taken. parts of the foothills, one
analyst said. But once down into
the table-flat plain, whose dusty
soil has been ground into powder
by the two armies and turned
into viscous mud by the winter
rains, the Iranians appear to to
have bogged down.
Shoring up morale
President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq visited the Khuzestan front
for three days last week in an
apparent attempt to shore up
domestic morale against the
Iranians' extravagant claims of
sweeping victories. Hussein
was shown on Iraqi television
with his troops at an undisclosed
point "on the southern war
front," the broadcast said — the
first time the president has ven
tured out into the battle zone,
and a possible indication that
the Iranian assault had run out
of steam.
Iran's president, Abol Hassan
Bani-Sadr, announced on Satur
day that the counteroffensive
has already reached its goal,
which he defined as"weakening
the enemy." That also sug
gested that the Iranian cam
paign has run its course, one
diplomat said.
The result is that the war ap
pears to have reached a virtual
impasse, as before Tehran's
counteroffensive, on three
fronts.
The two sides are still dug in
around Susangerd, Dezful,
Ahwaz and Abadan, the main
contested cities on the flatlands
of Khuzestan. They are facing
each other, with fewer troops.

along the central border front
from Dezful north to Qasr
Shirin. In the north, Iraq suc
cessfully advanced troops sev
eral miles into Iranian
Kurdistan last month, but has
reported no recent gains.
The fourth front, and perhaps
the decisive one, is in Tehran —
where Bani-Sadr put his own po
litical future on the line with the
success of the army's coun
terthrust.
Response to criticism
The president ordered the
counteroffensive for domestic
political purposes, analysts say
— after a long political cam
paign by his chief rivals, the
Moslem clergymen of the Is
lamic Republican Party, to
criticize his performance as
commander in chief of the
armed forces. Both the
Ayatollah Mohammed
Beheshti, the party chairman,
and the Ayatollah Hussein Ali
Montazeri, regarded as the
probable successor to the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
as supreme national leader, ac
cused Bani-Sadr of promising a
counterattack and then failing
to deliver. In the war, Bani-Sadr
regained much of his waning
prestige and popularity by as
suming the role of wartime
president and spending most of
his time at the front where he
was photographed riding motor
cycles and eating army rations.
Once the offensive began, the
clergy and their allies, includ
ing Prime Minister Mohammed
Ali Rajai, were quick to jump on
the bandwagon and hail the
army's apparent triumphs.
But if it becomes clear in
Tehran that the military gains
have been minimal, Bani-Sadr,
tainted with defeat, could be
come a political orphan.
