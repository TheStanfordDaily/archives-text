# Noon rally in King's honor well attended
## 
### Theresa Simons 
About 400 students attended a noon
rally in White Plaza yesterday to com
memorate Martin Luther King's life
and to support making King's birthday
a national holiday.
Petitions, which are part of a na
tional movement headed by per
former Stevie Wonder to establish
January 15, King's birthday, as a na
tional holiday, were available for sig
natures on campus throughout the
day.
After the rally, over 200 people at
tended a commemorative ceremony
in Tresidder Union. In the evening, a
film chronicling King's life, From
Montgomery to Memphis, was pres
ented in Ujamaa lounge.
Student organizers of the rally also
urged University students, faculty and
staff to celebrate King's birthday by
making yesterday a "personal holi
day" and not working or attending
classes.
United celebration
All these activities were part of
what may be the most concerted effort
ever by the black community to unite
in celebration of the birth of King, one
of the most highly-regarded black
men in the nation's history, according
to Kennell Jackson, temporary chair
man of the Afro-American studies de

partment.
Meanwhile, thousands of King's ad
mirers celebrated the slain civil
rights leader's birthday throughout
the country by marching for broth
erhood in snowy Washington, going
forward as "apostles for peace" in At
lanta. and vastly outnumbering a few
neo-Nazis in Buffalo.
Like the rally here, many of the
gatherings criticized Congress's fail
ure to declare January 15 a national
holiday, which would be the first such
honor for a black man. A petition
brought to Washington from Mem
phis, Tennessee, listed 62,000 names in
favor of the holiday. A score of states
and major cities now mark the birth
day as a local holiday.
After the crowd heard a recoding of
King's most famous speech, "I have a
dream," Keith Archuleta, a student in
the Graduate School of Business, re
called some of King's other famous
statements.
'Revolution of values'
"We must declare eternal opposi
tion to racism and militarism,"
Archuleta intoned. "We need a revolu
tion of values."
Following this presentation, under
graduate Frederick Buhl spoke, re
calling the recent murders of black
children in Georgia and Ku Klux Klan

activities in North Carolina,
stressing that the most urgent prob
lem in America today is "apathy and
false complacency.
"Those who tolerate evil are more
dangerous than those who commit it,'
Buhl said.
Buhl called upon President Donald
Kennedy and the Board of Trustees to
take action within the University to
observe King's birthday as a holiday.
"With this action we will, with one
stroke, counter the hate that plagues
this nation," Buhl said.
Keynote speech
Psychology Prof. Jah Irvin Brown
was the keynote speaker at the rally.
"We have to give thanks to the
Almighty for the day on which this
man (King) was born," Brown said.
"He represented the culmination of a
long tradition of the African-Ameri
can experience and people — of a
heart that beats for humanity."
King lived during a period of great
enthusiasm for civil rights reform,
but a problem of his era was that white
and black people had a different con
ception of the meaning of equality and
liberty, according to Brown.
While black people interpreted the
terms literally, white people con
sidered equality "a loose expression
for improvement," Brown said. He

adtlKj that the situation still has not
changed.
Goal of freedom
Brown said although King is known
best tor his efforts to achieve racial
integration. King's primary goal was
freedom.
Segregation is evil because it cuts
oti freedom. The issue is to have the
choice to integrate," Brown said.
Brown listed non-violence, integra
tion a desire to overcome, and moral
leadership as the cornerstones of
King's philosophy. He advised that
non violence and integration must be
gin within individuals, spread to their
community and then progress out
ward to the world.
Finally, he commented that blacks
are the "voice of conscience for Amer
ica He said black people need not
imitate King's philosophy, but should
imitate his integrity.
The rally ended with the song, "Lift
Every Voice and Sing," considered
the black national anthem. Most of the
crowd joined in the song and held
hands.
A recording of Stevie Wonder's
"Happy Birthday," a song dedicated
to King, was then played and the
crowd responded with enthusiasm.

Buhl called upon President Donald
Kennedy and the Board of Trustees to
take action within the University to
observe King's birthday as a holiday.
"With this action we will, with one
stroke, counter the hate that plagues
this nation," Buhl said.
Keynote speech
Psychology Prof. Jah Irvin Brown
was the keynote speaker at the rally.
"We have to give thanks to the
Almighty for the day on which this
man (King) was born," Brown said.
"He represented the culmination of a
long tradition of the African-Ameri
can experience and people — of a
heart that beats for humanity."
King lived during a period of great
enthusiasm for civil rights reform,
but a problem of his era was that white
and black people had a different con
ception of the meaning of equality and
liberty, according to Brown.
While black people interpreted the
terms literally, white people con
sidered equality "a loose expression
for improvement," Brown said. He

adtlKj that the situation still has not
changed.
Goal of freedom
Brown said although King is known
best tor his efforts to achieve racial
integration. King's primary goal was
freedom.
Segregation is evil because it cuts
oti freedom. The issue is to have the
choice to integrate," Brown said.
Brown listed non-violence, integra
tion a desire to overcome, and moral
leadership as the cornerstones of
King's philosophy. He advised that
non violence and integration must be
gin within individuals, spread to their
community and then progress out
ward to the world.
Finally, he commented that blacks
are the "voice of conscience for Amer
ica He said black people need not
imitate King's philosophy, but should
imitate his integrity.
The rally ended with the song, "Lift
Every Voice and Sing," considered
the black national anthem. Most of the
crowd joined in the song and held
hands.
A recording of Stevie Wonder's
"Happy Birthday," a song dedicated
to King, was then played and the
crowd responded with enthusiasm.

'Those who tolerate evil are more dangerous than those who commit it,' said
undergraduate Frederick Buhl speaking in White Plaza yesterday.
About 400 students attended a noon
rally in White Plaza yesterday to com
memorate Martin Luther King's life
and to support making King's birthday
a national holiday.
Petitions, which are part of a na
tional movement headed by per
former Stevie Wonder to establish
January 15, King's birthday, as a na
tional holiday, were available for sig
natures on campus throughout the
day.
After the rally, over 200 people at
tended a commemorative ceremony
in Tresidder Union. In the evening, a
film chronicling King's life, From
Montgomery to Memphis, was pres
ented in Ujamaa lounge.
Student organizers of the rally also
urged University students, faculty and
staff to celebrate King's birthday by
making yesterday a "personal holi
day" and not working or attending
classes.
United celebration
All these activities were part of
what may be the most concerted effort
ever by the black community to unite
in celebration of the birth of King, one
of the most highly-regarded black
men in the nation's history, according
to Kennell Jackson, temporary chair
man of the Afro-American studies de

partment.
Meanwhile, thousands of King's ad
mirers celebrated the slain civil
rights leader's birthday throughout
the country by marching for broth
erhood in snowy Washington, going
forward as "apostles for peace" in At
lanta. and vastly outnumbering a few
neo-Nazis in Buffalo.
Like the rally here, many of the
gatherings criticized Congress's fail
ure to declare January 15 a national
holiday, which would be the first such
honor for a black man. A petition
brought to Washington from Mem
phis, Tennessee, listed 62,000 names in
favor of the holiday. A score of states
and major cities now mark the birth
day as a local holiday.
After the crowd heard a recoding of
King's most famous speech, "I have a
dream," Keith Archuleta, a student in
the Graduate School of Business, re
called some of King's other famous
statements.
'Revolution of values'
"We must declare eternal opposi
tion to racism and militarism,"
Archuleta intoned. "We need a revolu
tion of values."
Following this presentation, under
graduate Frederick Buhl spoke, re
calling the recent murders of black
children in Georgia and Ku Klux Klan

activities in North Carolina,
stressing that the most urgent prob
lem in America today is "apathy and
false complacency.
"Those who tolerate evil are more
dangerous than those who commit it,'
Buhl said.
