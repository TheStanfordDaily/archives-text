There .was trouble brewing as the Stanford
beer-tasting team was defeated by the rival Uni
versity of California at Berkeley team in the first
annual College Beer Bowl at the Cow Palace last
week
The brew-ha-ha ended with the Cal team scor
ing 15 to Stanford's 8 At the end of the event, the
Cardinals were as beat as the keg.
The rigorous academic contest of beerology
knowledge celebrated the opening of the new Beer
Hall in the San Francisco Sports and Boat Show
Jan 9 to 18
Questions ran the gamut from brand identi
fication to brewing to fermentation to advertising
to origins to the actual consumption of beer.
Nothing was "ale"-ing the Stanford team when
it arrived at the Cow Palace. Members Rick
Gervais, Ivan Maisel. Mike Meldman, Alan
Nichols, Randy Schlemmer, Todd Timberlake
and Captain John Walecka were mentally ready
for the beer Olympics.
The Cards got a pre-game head start on the
Bears. Demonstrating total team commitment
and dedication to the fine art of drinking, all team
members ( barring none) went to an 8 a.m. sherry
hour for barrels of fun before the match.
According to Maisel, "We had the team meet
ing at the Glo-Worm that morning to get in the
right frame of mind for the contest."
Maisel indicated that there is a lot of "un
tapped" beer-drinking talent at Stanford. "We
were no more qualified (to be on the team) than
any other group of 500," he said.
Academically, the Cal team had a big jump on
Stanford. According to Timberlake, "Cal had ac
tually done some screening."
Nichols mumbled something about "the de
mands of a Stanford student'' as taking away from
team preparation time.
He said that the Cal team "studied a lot of liter

ature. But he emphasized, "We totally outdrank
them afterwards. We kind of redeemed ourselves
there."
Questions included identifying 10 cities in which
Budweiser is brewed, six cities on the Budweiser
cans, the most up-and-coming beer and the Ger
man words for light and dark beer
The Cards were also asked the motto of Osh
Kosh beer. They replied, "Osh Kosh by gosh.'.'
Local TV personality Carter Smith, the emcee,
asked the Cards,"Who was King Gagiglias and
what did he have to do with beer?"
The Stanford team, which Timberlake admits
"cheated'' periodically, replied. "Most probably
the husband of Queen Gagiglias. "
"We'd all huddle and say we don't know,' "
said, Timberlake But the Cards "chugged" along,
doing their best.
According to Meldman. "Berkeley was beer
connoisseurs and we were beer drinkers.
Berkeley took it too seriously."
The Cards were preoccupied with other press
ing matters. Meldman said, for example, that
they tried to pick up their waitress. The Stanford
members also altered the planned proceedings by
putting beer buckets, designed for spitting out
samples, on their heads.
Selection for the team was somewhat unof
ficial The Cal captain contacted Walecka who set
up the impromptu Cards team.
But the event was high-class, with crackers and
French bread provided in between rounds to
"clear the palate," said Timberlake.
The match was set up similar to a Hi-Q panel.
Team members and an illustrious panel of judges
wore name tags.
Sponsors gave the team money to buy special
Stanford apparel for the event.
But the team seemed to be motivated by love of
beer and the desire to be "Bud"-ing stars.
