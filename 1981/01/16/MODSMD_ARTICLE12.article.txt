# Staffing Stanford's Sierra Camp — 'it's a great summer job'
## 
### Bill Beyda 
Thirty-five Stanford students
will spend their summer work
ing at the Stanford Sierra Camp,
on Fallen Leaf Lake, having
what past employee Andrea
Weatherhead described as "the
best experience of their lives."
Over 150 applications were ex
pected for these positions, ac
cording to Frank Boutin, the
camp's assistant director.
The camp is owned and oper
ated by the Stanford Alumni As
sociation. and its facilities are
available for the use of Stanford
alumni, faculty, staff and their
families and friends. This sum
mer, 12 one-week sessions, from
June 13 to September 5, will
each be attended by about 250
guests. >it
"The camp is very much like
a resort," said Boutin. Boutin
explained that the camp caters

to families. Not only are ac
tivities provided for adults, but
children are taken care of.
The camp's programs are
very varied, including instruct
tion in art, photography, crafts,
hiking, exercise, nature, sail
ing, tennis, volleyball and wa
terskiing. In addition to instruc
ting these programs, Stanford
students coordinate the boating
facility, the children's program
and work in the office. All stu
dents receive training in first
aid and Cardio Pulmonary Re
suscitation (CPR). Those work
ing on the waterfront must also
have an advanced lifesaving
certificate.
Weatherhead described her
experience at the camp by
saying, "It's the most ideal
summer job. It teaches you how
to deal with people, and to be pa
tient. It is hard work, and some

times tiring." The staff rotates
certain duties, such as kitchen
work, not one of the favorites
among the employees, but nec
essary to the camp's function
ing.
Every Saturday, after the old
guests leave and before the new
ones arrive, the entire staff
cleans the cabins, another not so
eagerly anticipated pastime.
However, the fun outweighs the
few dreaded tasks, according to
Weatherhead.
The staff also participates in
voluntary programs such as tal
ent and waterskiing shows. Pam
Conover. who worked at the

camp last year, recalled the last
waterskiing show of the season:
"It was just like any of the other
shows, except for one detail.
Andy Roberts, Mike Moore,
Greg Delgado, Mac Irvin, Cindy
Shornev and I put on the exhibi
tion; it really was an exhibition
— we exhibited everything."
Doing nude waterskiing shows
is not a requirement of the job,
and Conover stresssed "you
don't have to be an exhibi
tionist "
The job pays $95 a week, plus
tips (about $50), and includes
free room and board, according

to Boutin. Most of the students
take this job for the unique ex
perience it offers them, and not
for the money, said Boutin.
Any currently enrolled Stan
ford undergraduate is eligible
for the position. The application
process includes up to two in
terviews and a detailed applica
tion including references.
Boutin said he feels "It's a great
summer job opportunity for un
dergraduates," and encourages
interested students to pick up
applications, which are due Jan
uary 23, at Bowman Alumni
House.
