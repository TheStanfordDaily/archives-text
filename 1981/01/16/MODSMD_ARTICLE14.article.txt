# Hall registration

### 
President-elect Ronald Reagan has
longed favored an all-volunteer army; in
fact, Martin Anderson, one of his key ad
visers, was responsible for implementing
the current volunteer army during the
Nixon Administration. While always op
posed to an actual draft, Reagan was also
intially against Jimmy Carter's draft reg
istration proposal, although his current
position is unclear.
We urge that Reagan re-endorse his
earlier stand in a straightforward
manner; that is, Reagan, by executive or

der, should have the registration of those
born in 1962 halted and the lists of those
who have registered previously de
stroyed.
By taking such an action, Reagan will
remove a needless source of divisiveness,
and eliminate a cumbersome and wasteful
bureaucracy. At the very least, this should
appeal to Reagan's faith in austere gov
ernment; we'd also like to think that Rea
gan could see this as a unifying gesture
signalling a fresh start.
