## El Salvador: revolution to end oppression 
### 
It is ironic that a deceptive
article based on distorted his
tory and specious analysis
should appear under a title such
as "El Salvador another Com
munist deception?" (Daily, Jan
13). It is not surprising, how
ever. that it was submitted by a
senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution, L.H. Gann.
Gann claims that the popular
revolutionary movement in El
Salvador is just a front for a
monolithic Communist con
spiracy which emanates from
Moscow. Yet he does not cite a
single fact on the political
makeup of the Salvadorean op
position. or on the domestic and
international groups which sup
port it.
It is true, of course, that so
cialist countries like Cuba sup
port the Democratic Revolu
tionary Front (FDRi of El
Salvador, the coalition of all op
position forces there But so do
the moderate social-democratic
parties of western Europe (e.g.,
the British Labour Party) as
well as most of the progressive
governments in Latin America
(e.g., Mexico > which can hardly
be called "radical."
The FDR is composed of a
wide spectrum of political and
social groups representing
progressive church and busi
ness leaders, workers and
peasants, and social-democrat
ic reformers, as well as revolu
tionary socialists and Marxist
guerillas. All of these people are
Salvadorean men and women,
dedicated to ending the in
justices which have made life in
their country unbearable for
most of its citizens.
The last thing they want is for
their nation to become depen
dent on another foreign power,
after the bitter experience of
U.S. support for the ruling eco
nomic oligarchy and military
junta.
Ignoring these facts, Gann
argues that the Salvadorean
revolution will inevitably de
generate into a "Marxist-
Leninist" dictatorship allied to
the U.S.S.R As "proof," he
cites a number of supposedly
similar cases: Yugoslavia, Chi
na, Cuba. E. Germany, Czecho
slovakia. Angola, and Vietnam.
We do not have space to con
sider all of Gann's claims about
these countries. Still, a few key
points are worth mentioning.
First, two of these countries,

Yugoslavia and China, have
been independent of the
U.S.S R. for decades. Indeed.
China is now virtually a U.S.
ally. It is simply untrue that all
socialist countries are Soviet
puppets unfriendly to the U.S.
Cuba, Vietnam, and Angola
all have one thing in common
which Gann neglects to men
tion. In all three cases, in
digenous revolutionarv move
ments were driven to turn to the
Soviet Union or each other for
aid by self-defeating American
policies: our unwillingness to
accept socialist transformation
in Cuba; our defense of French
colonialism and our war on
behalf of the Diem and Thieu re
gimes in South Vietnam, and our
support for Portugese colonial
ism and later South African in
tervention in Angola.
Such U.S. failures have led
many people to question the pol
icy of blind opposition to revolu
tionary movements in the Third
World. Last November, a
number of state department,
national security and even CIA
officials issued an anonymous
"Dissent Paper on El Salvador
and Central America.''
They acknowledged the legit
imacy of the FDR and urged the
U.S. to accept its participation
in negotiations for a new gov
ernment in El Salvador. They
argued for supporting genuine
reform in Central America, in
stead of increasing military aid
to brutal and unpopular dic
tatorships.
There is one revolutionary
country which Gann left out, but
which really is analogous to El
Salvador: Nicaragua. TheSand
inista government in Nicaragua
has accepted the cooperation of
private enterprise, encouraged
freedom of expression, in
stituted judicial due process
for the first time and main
tained a nonaligned position rel
ative to the U.S. and the
USSR.
The revolution in Nicaragua
is bringing literacy, food, and
productive work to a population
that was previously un
educated, hungry, and un
employed. If the Salvadorean
revolution has any model, it is
this one, and it is too good a
model for Gann to deal with.
Gann would argue that the in
tentions of Salvadorean
progressives are irrelevant,
since their movement is

doomed to follow the Eastern
European pattern and end up
producing a repressive bureau
cratic state. He simply assumes
that because this happened in
some countries, it must happen
everywhere, regardless of the
historic specificity of each case.
The illogic of this reasoning
should be self-evident.
Gann forgets that our own re
public was founded by a popular
revolutionary movement in op
position to colonial control and
"taxation without representa
tion." Imagine how the Ameri
can patriots would have re
sponded to the conditions which
oppress the people of El
Salvador in their everyday
lives.
There have been 50 con
secutive years of military dic
tatorship. the longest in Latin
America, without elections, civ
il liberties, or freedom of the
press.
In 1980 alone, between 9000
and 10,000 Salvadorean people
were summarily abducted,
many raped, tortured, and
mutilated, and then executed.
According to Amnesty Interna
tional, the National Guard and
other government "security"
forces participated in these
murders in cooperation with the
right-wing para-militarv death
squads.
El Salvador has the lowest
caloric intake per capita in Cen
tral America, with one out of
every three children suffering
from visible malnutrition. Over
50 percent of its people are il
literate.
Fourteen families own and
control over 60 percent of all the
agriculturally productive land
in the country and form the

backbone of resistance to genu
ine land reform
The last time the people of El
Salvador rose in revolt against
their poverty and lack of human
rights was in the late 1920s and
early '30s. The oligarchy de
feated that movement by spon
soring a military massacre of
30.000 peasants, both rebels and
their families â€” a veritable act
of genocide.
Facts such as these have led
the Roman Catholic church of
El Salvador into opposition to
the government and de facto
support for the revolutionary
movement. Archbishop
Romero, an outspoken opponent
of the junta who urged the U.S.
to stop supporting it, was as
sassinated last fall in the middle
of a mass in the Cathedral of San
Salvador. The recent rape, tor
ture, and execution of four
American nuns which shocked
the American people was just a
typical example of what the
Salvadorean military and right
wing are doing every day to lay
and religious opponents alike.
As Americans learn more
about the real situation in El
Salvador, they will start to ques
tion our government's mis
guided policies there. And they
will not be deceived by old Cold
War rhetoric about "Com
munism."
If the Reagan administration
attempts an intervention by
U.S. armed forces, what Gann
calls the "far-off days of cam
pus revolt" will return very
quickly. (Robert Blecker is a

nomics department. Craig

argues that the Salvadorean
revolution will inevitably de
generate into a "Marxist-
Leninist" dictatorship allied to
the U.S.S.R As "proof," he
cites a number of supposedly
similar cases: Yugoslavia, Chi
na, Cuba. E. Germany, Czecho
slovakia. Angola, and Vietnam.
We do not have space to con
sider all of Gann's claims about
these countries. Still, a few key
points are worth mentioning.
First, two of these countries,

Yugoslavia and China, have
been independent of the
U.S.S R. for decades. Indeed.
China is now virtually a U.S.
ally. It is simply untrue that all
socialist countries are Soviet
puppets unfriendly to the U.S.
Cuba, Vietnam, and Angola
all have one thing in common
which Gann neglects to men
tion. In all three cases, in
digenous revolutionarv move
ments were driven to turn to the
Soviet Union or each other for
aid by self-defeating American
policies: our unwillingness to
accept socialist transformation
in Cuba; our defense of French
colonialism and our war on
behalf of the Diem and Thieu re
gimes in South Vietnam, and our
support for Portugese colonial
ism and later South African in
tervention in Angola.
Such U.S. failures have led
many people to question the pol
icy of blind opposition to revolu
tionary movements in the Third
World. Last November, a
number of state department,
national security and even CIA
officials issued an anonymous
"Dissent Paper on El Salvador
and Central America.''
They acknowledged the legit
imacy of the FDR and urged the
U.S. to accept its participation
in negotiations for a new gov
ernment in El Salvador. They
argued for supporting genuine
reform in Central America, in
stead of increasing military aid
to brutal and unpopular dic
tatorships.
There is one revolutionary
country which Gann left out, but
which really is analogous to El
Salvador: Nicaragua. TheSand
inista government in Nicaragua
has accepted the cooperation of
private enterprise, encouraged
freedom of expression, in
stituted judicial due process
for the first time and main
tained a nonaligned position rel
ative to the U.S. and the
USSR.
The revolution in Nicaragua
is bringing literacy, food, and
productive work to a population
that was previously un
educated, hungry, and un
employed. If the Salvadorean
revolution has any model, it is
this one, and it is too good a
model for Gann to deal with.
Gann would argue that the in
tentions of Salvadorean
progressives are irrelevant,
since their movement is

doomed to follow the Eastern
European pattern and end up
producing a repressive bureau
cratic state. He simply assumes
that because this happened in
some countries, it must happen
everywhere, regardless of the
historic specificity of each case.
The illogic of this reasoning
should be self-evident.
Gann forgets that our own re
public was founded by a popular
revolutionary movement in op
position to colonial control and
"taxation without representa
tion." Imagine how the Ameri
can patriots would have re
sponded to the conditions which
oppress the people of El
Salvador in their everyday
lives.
There have been 50 con
secutive years of military dic
tatorship. the longest in Latin
America, without elections, civ
il liberties, or freedom of the
press.
In 1980 alone, between 9000
and 10,000 Salvadorean people
were summarily abducted,
many raped, tortured, and
mutilated, and then executed.
According to Amnesty Interna
tional, the National Guard and
other government "security"
forces participated in these
murders in cooperation with the
right-wing para-militarv death
squads.
El Salvador has the lowest
caloric intake per capita in Cen
tral America, with one out of
every three children suffering
from visible malnutrition. Over
50 percent of its people are il
literate.
Fourteen families own and
control over 60 percent of all the
agriculturally productive land
in the country and form the

backbone of resistance to genu
ine land reform
The last time the people of El
Salvador rose in revolt against
their poverty and lack of human
rights was in the late 1920s and
early '30s. The oligarchy de
feated that movement by spon
soring a military massacre of
30.000 peasants, both rebels and
their families â€” a veritable act
of genocide.
Facts such as these have led
the Roman Catholic church of
El Salvador into opposition to
the government and de facto
support for the revolutionary
movement. Archbishop
Romero, an outspoken opponent
of the junta who urged the U.S.
to stop supporting it, was as
sassinated last fall in the middle
of a mass in the Cathedral of San
Salvador. The recent rape, tor
ture, and execution of four
American nuns which shocked
the American people was just a
typical example of what the
Salvadorean military and right
wing are doing every day to lay
and religious opponents alike.
As Americans learn more
about the real situation in El
Salvador, they will start to ques
tion our government's mis
guided policies there. And they
will not be deceived by old Cold
War rhetoric about "Com
munism."
If the Reagan administration
attempts an intervention by
U.S. armed forces, what Gann
calls the "far-off days of cam
pus revolt" will return very
quickly. (Robert Blecker is a
graduate student in the eco
nomics department. Craig
Richards is a graduate student
in the School of Education.)
It is ironic that a deceptive
article based on distorted his
tory and specious analysis
should appear under a title such
as "El Salvador another Com
munist deception?" (Daily, Jan
13). It is not surprising, how
ever. that it was submitted by a
senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution, L.H. Gann.
Gann claims that the popular
revolutionary movement in El
Salvador is just a front for a
monolithic Communist con
spiracy which emanates from
Moscow. Yet he does not cite a
single fact on the political
makeup of the Salvadorean op
position. or on the domestic and
international groups which sup
port it.

The FDR is composed of a
wide spectrum of political and
social groups representing
progressive church and busi

Salvadorean men and women,
dedicated to ending the in

their country unbearable for

reform in Central America, in
stead of increasing military aid
to brutal and unpopular dic
tatorships.
There is one revolutionary
country which Gann left out, but
which really is analogous to El
Salvador: Nicaragua. TheSand
inista government in Nicaragua
has accepted the cooperation of
private enterprise, encouraged
freedom of expression, in
stituted judicial due process
for the first time and main
tained a nonaligned position rel
ative to the U.S. and the
USSR.
The revolution in Nicaragua
is bringing literacy, food, and
productive work to a population
that was previously un
educated, hungry, and un
employed. If the Salvadorean
revolution has any model, it is
this one, and it is too good a
model for Gann to deal with.
Gann would argue that the in
tentions of Salvadorean
progressives are irrelevant,
since their movement is

doomed to follow the Eastern
European pattern and end up
producing a repressive bureau
cratic state. He simply assumes
that because this happened in
some countries, it must happen
everywhere, regardless of the
historic specificity of each case.
The illogic of this reasoning
should be self-evident.
Gann forgets that our own re
public was founded by a popular
revolutionary movement in op
position to colonial control and
"taxation without representa
tion." Imagine how the Ameri
can patriots would have re
sponded to the conditions which
oppress the people of El
Salvador in their everyday
lives.
There have been 50 con
secutive years of military dic
tatorship. the longest in Latin
America, without elections, civ
il liberties, or freedom of the
press.
In 1980 alone, between 9000
and 10,000 Salvadorean people
were summarily abducted,
many raped, tortured, and
mutilated, and then executed.
According to Amnesty Interna
tional, the National Guard and
other government "security"
forces participated in these
murders in cooperation with the
right-wing para-militarv death
squads.
El Salvador has the lowest
caloric intake per capita in Cen
tral America, with one out of
every three children suffering
from visible malnutrition. Over
50 percent of its people are il
literate.
Fourteen families own and
control over 60 percent of all the
agriculturally productive land
in the country and form the

backbone of resistance to genu
ine land reform
The last time the people of El
Salvador rose in revolt against
their poverty and lack of human
rights was in the late 1920s and
early '30s. The oligarchy de
feated that movement by spon
soring a military massacre of
30.000 peasants, both rebels and
their families â€” a veritable act
of genocide.
Facts such as these have led
the Roman Catholic church of
El Salvador into opposition to
the government and de facto
support for the revolutionary
movement. Archbishop
Romero, an outspoken opponent
of the junta who urged the U.S.
to stop supporting it, was as
sassinated last fall in the middle
of a mass in the Cathedral of San
Salvador. The recent rape, tor
ture, and execution of four
American nuns which shocked
the American people was just a
typical example of what the
Salvadorean military and right
wing are doing every day to lay
and religious opponents alike.
As Americans learn more
about the real situation in El
Salvador, they will start to ques
tion our government's mis
guided policies there. And they
will not be deceived by old Cold
War rhetoric about "Com
munism."
If the Reagan administration
attempts an intervention by
U.S. armed forces, what Gann
calls the "far-off days of cam
pus revolt" will return very
quickly. (Robert Blecker is a
