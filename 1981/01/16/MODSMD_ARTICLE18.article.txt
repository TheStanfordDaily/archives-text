# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Steve Hansch Vegetarianism from a moral perspective 
### 
Peter Singer, one of the most
famous and extensively read
contemporary philosophers, has
argued for many years that hu
man treatment (or mistreat

ment) of animals should be sub
ject to the same ethical reason
ing that we have historically
used in attacking slavery, ra
cism and sexism.
After first reviewing several
popular considerations in choos
ing a vegetarian diet I will sug
gest that respect for the rights
of animals should be the most
pressing.
Many vegetarians choose
their diets for purely personal
considerations. First among
these is the belief that meat
products are prone to higher
levels of toxicity and fats and
that they are a greater strain on
the body to digest. Second is the
desire to reduce food costs;
meat products are more ex
pensive across the board.
Vegetarianism further sug
gests some cultural affiliations.
One may choose this diet, for in
stance, to be perceived as being
less aggressive, blood-thirsty
and rednecked, and more or
ganic and non-violent.
Vegetarianism can also be
one's way of taking a stand.
Since feedlot cattle consume 20
times more energy than they
provide in their meat, many feel
that that represents a 95 percent
energy waste that is totally un
necessary. The decline of meat
consumption may be desirable
to encourage either a more
gentle approach to our
ecosystems or to free up U.S.
grain products for distribution
to a world rampant with starva
tion and endemic malnutrition.
While each of these above
points are sufficient motivation
to convince me to totally avoid
meat products, in fact none of
them have proved binding in my
life since the following argu
ment has seemed far more com
pelling.
I do not doubt that animals
have feelings. Not as complex
or as deep as humans', but of the
same nature, and, for them,
every bit as real. In the same
sense, then, I empathize with
and loathe animal suffering as I
do human.
There is no question that
many millions of food-factory

animals are caged across the
U.S. and mistreated to such an
enormous extent, in my opinion,
as to account for most of all the
pain and suffering felt by all
creatures, human included,
within this nation.
One needs only to read the
numbers of cattle, of chickens,
of pigs who are so tightly con
fined in "inhuman" quarters all
their lives to realize what the
American meat diet has
created. One needs only learn of
the life cycles of these animal
slaves to see the clear and know
ing causation of pain.
As an example, no prison
camp in Russia, Vietnam or any
jail in the U.S. packs its inhabi
tants day in and day out as tight
ly as egg-producing hens are on
the factory farm. Hens are sep
arated by wire mesh, lights are
kept dim and their beaks are vir
tually cut off all to keep them
from killing each other. There is
not enough room to take two hen
steps in any one direction.
Whereas the natural lifespan for
chickens is 15 to 20 years, these
hens last only a year and a half.
Over 250 million hens currently
exist this way.
Veal factories are the
harshest confinement systems.
Newly born calves are turned
into anemic, neurotic animals
to produce the luxury veal pre
ferred by gourmet cooks and
fancy restaurants.
Each year, hundreds of
thousands of calves are sepa
rated from their mothers when
one day old and force-fed for 15
weeks in pitch-dark stalls
scarcely larger and wider than
their bodies. They are tied by
the neck and, from birth to early
death, are not spoken to or per
mitted any physical interaction
with the outside world or with
fellow cattle.
Having been in jail myself I
believe that the stress, anxiety
and boredom of unnatural con
finement is the most uncom
fortable experience of my life. I
can only conclude that the
tighter confinement and sani
tarily far poorer conditions in
beef and pork feedlots are as

cruel and likely far crueler than
anything I have experienced.
I could go on, of course, speci
fying the mistreatments of not
only mother sows and cows but
of other species as well â€” of tur
keys, rabbits, ducks. But to a
large degree I don't believe it
matters. Torture is only the ex
treme of the injustice. The very
act of captivity, of forceful limi
tation of the animal's life
choices by human economic in
terests is, in my opinion, im
moral. The treatment of captive
animals is qualitatively dif
ferent between industry and
pet-owner. Unlike our day-to
day encounters with our usually
affluent pets, the American ex
perience for our food-producing
animals is more wretched than
we would think to imagine.
The key question now is
whether we care. Can we ignore
this problem in the same way
we ignore the hundreds of mil
lions of desperately needy fel
low humans? Can we possibly
rationalize that we are not,
through our dietary choices,
directly a cause of the problem?
I suspect that, indeed, most of
the readers of this will forget
about this dilemma altogether
as they are not confronted by it
in their day to day experience.
I suggest that elimination of
purchases of meats and eggs by
American consumers is both a
truly effective and a moral re
sponse. I recommend vege
tarianism, therefore, not as a
fad or a program for health, but
as the most ethical possible diet
in a situation where animals are
abused for profit-making en
terprizes.
Please consider Peter
Singer's question: "We often
seem to assume that animals
were put here for us to use as we
please. But no good reason can
be given for regarding animals
as things. Do we have the right
to make animals live miserable
lives, just to satisfy our taste for
a diet so rich in animal products
that it exceeds any sane nutri
tional requirement?"
