El Salvador
I would not accept from one of
my first-year undergraduates
the sort of tendentious logic pro
duced by L.H. Gann, Senior FeU
low at the Hoover Institution
(Daily, Jan. 13). Fortunately,
my students would be too so
phisticated to try to build a case
against a non-interventionist
foreign policy by citing a string
of alleged media commentaries
on critical junctures in recent
world history, faintly enlivened
by the dusty rhetoric of what
used to be called red-baiting:
"Communist camouflage tech
niques" indeed!
Sealed in the concrete tower,
Gann has not noticed that we are
no longer living in the early Ei
senhower administration,
simpler times when it was still
possible to denounce every
flicker of anti-Americanism as
one more reflex of the
"Monolithic Communist Con
spiracy" and every dissenter as
a pawn of Satan and foreign re
gimes. The world, alas, has
come to be regarded as rather
more complex a thing than can
be condensed into the tidy and
reassuring formulae of Man
ichean McCarthyism.
That this sort of super
annuated intellectual simplicity
is being tapped by the incoming
Reagan administration is just
terrifying. It is the paranoid
logic of knee-jerk intervention
in countries like El Salvador, of
the active support of the most
brutal and hated regimes, and
probably for a big, juicy war to
save the world from something
that doesn't exist.

Find courage
Draft registration needs to be
carefully and deeply considered
by everyone, not just those
whom the law calls upon to reg
ister. If draftees are killed in
war. then part of a nation dies
with them.
And we are talking about war,
with all of its horror and devas
tation. Draft lists are prepara
tion for war, a readiness to fight
when the leaders say go.
Why war? Why fight? Why
register? For some soldiering is
a job, for the depraved few de
struction is fun, but most wars
usually find a variety of beliefs
and causes to be fought for. The
U.S. fights for the "defense" of
freedom, the Soviets for its "ad

vancement." And those who try
to live free are crushed.
Perhaps Vietnam made me
skeptical. The war there had
nothing to do with my freedom
here, except threaten to take
away my oldest brother. It did
have everything to do with the
freedom of the Vietnamese peo
ples from wanton aggression:
the war denied them that free
dom.
I'm scared of war, of the
potential for war that draft reg
istration creates. I love life too
much to want to lose my own or
take away that of others. And it
seems so insane to die in a war
of machines where people are
only incidental, or to lay waste
to lands you don't even know.
Draft registration is an emo
tional issue; don't let the calls
for cool reason hide that. Your
own guts are on the line when
you register. It's a small step, a
few marks of ink. But it is a step
towards readiness for war and
all of war's insanity.
This, then, for those who are
called upon to register for the
draft: think about it. Talk about
it. Above all, feel it out with
your own conscience. Sign up if
you want to .Don't sign up if —
after carefully looking at it —
you don't want to.
Those who refuse to register
for the draft will be called un
grateful for their freedoms, un
willing to do their duty for their
country. But an American's
duty is to think, to feel, and then
to act, not to blindly obey. That
is what freedom means: being
able to act from conscience, not
conscription. I hope that those

who do not believe in regis
tration find the courage to say
"no."

Be wary
Concerning Marxism and the
El Salvadorean crisis, (Daily,
Jan 13), I would like to strongly
question what seems to be a typ
ical American reaction to
modern revolution. This is the
untenable belief that revolu
tionaries opposed to right-wing
governments such as El
Salvador's are "Marx
ist-Leninists" and ground their
activities not on the failures and
cruelties of a particular govern
ment, but perform, somehow,
as automaton extensions of big
brother Brezhnev and his Soviet
cronies.
Efforts to reduce world poli
tics to such extremes are im
mured in paranoia and sim
plicity; they inhibit intelligent
questions as to the foundations
of civil strife, and assume that
Marxist philosophy alone is
enough to incite insurrection.
Further, such efforts are based
on the assumption that a Marx
ist-Leninist revolution — indeed
any revolution replacing a U.S.-
backed government — is a horri
fic proposition, even if it serves
to replace a government rife

with exploitation, military
cruelty, and corruption. In
short, the transition is not ac
cepted even if it means better
conditions for the people.
I believe revolutionary
causes deserve a somewhat
more scholarly explanation
than "communist camouflage
tactics," and, if such tactics are
involved at a later stage of a
revolution. I want to know what
U.S. involvement brings to bear
on the situation. Until such
scholarship is presented to the
American public by the Hoover
Institution and others. I too feel
a "duty to be wary."

Duty bound
In his recent letter (Daily,
Jan. 13), John Liu raises some
interesting and important ques
tions regarding my position on
registration and the draft. I be
lieve that some elaboration on
my previous column (Daily,
Jan. 8) is in order.
I am not asking anyone to
abandon his or hef deeply held
moral convictions. Quite the
contrary, I feel that those who
'believe the registration law to
be unjust have a moral duty to
disobey it. I personally believe
the law to be both just and nec

essary. and in light of this belief
I urge thoughtful acceptance of
the duty to register — and, if
called, to serve.
I also assert, however, that
those who disobey the law ought
to accept the punishment, not
evade it. This is the price to be
paid for the protection of all our
laws, which have allowed us un
precedented freedom and pros
perity. Citizens cannot merely
choose which laws to obey and
which to ignore.
Finally, to Liu's point: does
this duty either to obey or to ac
cept the punishment exist at all
times, in all countries? I would
answer "No." Some govern
ments may well be illegitimate
as a whole, and not deserving of
such allegiance. The next ques
tions are: Which governments
and why? The answers to these
questions fill the volumes of po
litical philosophy.
In this debate over draft reg
istration. of course, each must
resolve these questions person
ally, and act upon that resolu
tion. I for one do not believe that
our own government, troubled
as it is, has fallen to this level of
illegitimacy. Nor do I believe
that most current objectors to
registration would argue that it
has — although likely some
would. They also should make
their objections known.
