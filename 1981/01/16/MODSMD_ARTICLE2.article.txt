# Iran's formal reply received
## U.S. response being pondered 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Iran, after more than
two weeks of intensive negotiations,
delivered its formal reply yesterday
to the latest American proposal for en
ding the hostage crisis. President Jim
my Carter immediately began meet
ings with ranking U.S. officials at the
White House to decide whether the
crisis can be ended before he leaves of
fice.
Administration officials were close
mouthed about the content of the Ira
nian message delivered through the
Algerian intermediaries. But an of
ficial statement, drafted by White
House counsel Lloyd Cutler, hinted
that the message did not contain a re
ply that, the United States could accept
with a simple yes or no.
The message, the State Department
statement said, "warrants close and
intensive study." That was begun im
mediately by officials here and by
Deputy Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and members of his team
in Algiers.
Cannot pedict
"Until we have an opportunity to
evaluate the Iranian response," the
American statement said, "we cannot
predict whether it will enable the
parties to resolve their remaining dif
ferences."
The State Department said that
Christopher, who has been standing by
in Algiers all week to maintain direct
contact with the Algerian in
termediaries in the negotiations, re
layed the Iranian message to Wash
ington. Officials said that he was in
frequent direct contact with the White
House thereafter.
Carter and other officials led by
Cutler took part in what White House
sources described as "lengthy dis
cussions" on the Iranian reply. Other
officials described the reply as one
that poses complicated legal and fi
nancial problems, rather than the one
direct response for which the adminis
tration had hoped.
Top level
Parallel with the top-level White
House meetings were other meetings
at staff level there and at the State and
Treasury departments. The hostage
issue appeared to be reaching a
climax with an Iranian response that
poses "exceptionally complicated
questions," one official said.
The outstanding differences be
tween Iran and the United States have

in the past been described as "impor
tant" and "substantial."
U.S. officials, mindful that the
Carter administration leaves office
Tuesday and that a practical deadline
for agreement had been set for today,
have said the Iranian reply would have
to be simple, direct and virtually ac
ceptable on its face if the hostages
were to be freed before Ronald Rea
gan's inauguration Jan. 20.
Unfreeze assets
The United States has offered to un
freeze Iranian assets blocked after the
hostages were seized as part of an
agreement to free the captives. That
offer was amended in another pro
posal transmitted to Iran Jan. 2 to in
clude immediate transfer of about $5.5
billion of the frozen assets, with
transfer of an additional $1.8 billion as
soon as loan payments to foreign
branches of U.S. banks are brought up
to date.
Behzad Nabavi, the chief Iranian
negotiator, was quoted in Tehran late
yesterday as warning that nego
tiations would be broken off if Wash
ington does not begin to transfer those
assets into an Algerian escrow ac
count by the close of business today.

"Conditions will change drastically,"
Nabavi warned in an interview over
Iranian state radio.
However, there had been hopeful
signals coming from Iran earlier in
the day — signals that preceded the
announcement that Iranian author
ities had finally completed and trans
mitted their reply through the Alger
ian intermediaries.
Khomeini blessing
Among those signs was the fact that
Prime Minister Mohamed Ali Rajai
and Nabavi met in the morning with
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
presumably to get his blessing for the
message sent to Algiers later in the
day.
Further, diplomatic sources in
Tehran were quoted in interviews as
being encouraged by developments
there since Wednesday's action by the
Majlis. It voted then to authorize the
Iranian government to accept arbi
tration by an international com
mission of claims against an esti
mated $2.2 billion of Iranian assets
frozen after the hostages were seized
Nov. 4, 1979. U.S. officials estimate
those assets total $9.5 billion
