state District Judge Richard
Lee, who tried to keep the girls
in an all-white school
"This court has never been in
conflict at any time with any
state court," Scott said. "This
court has not made any
statements or any remarks
about any state judge until it has
had to protect its
judgments. . . . There is noth
ing personal, nothing personal
whatsoever."
Lee, on hand mainly as a spec
tator, said nothing in court,

aside from some whispers to his
lawyer, seated beside him The
girls sat quietly, fidgeting dur
ing the hearing.

make permanent his two-week
old order against the state and
all state officials.

session, the first of two days of

Contempt citations

three white girls who tried to
keep their daughters in the all
white school, are named in con
tempt citations.
Fines
In a recommendation filed
Tuesday, the Department of
Justice upped the ante on the
fines it wants imposed. Instead
of $1000 a day, it said Lee should
be fined $4000 for his first day of
defiance, and $1000 a day after
that.
For Buckeye Principal
Charles Waites and the parents
the Justice Department wants a
fine of $2000 for the first day and
$500 for each day of defiance af
ter that.

In Wednesday's session, Scott
said he would not punish Waites
for enrolling the girls at Buck
eye when faced with contradic
tory orders — one from federal
court telling him not to and one
from state court saying do it or
be arrested.
Lynda McNeal, 13, Michelle
Laborde, 13, and Ramona
Carbo, 12. were among the 108
Buckeye students who, under
Scott's parish-wide desegrega
tion plan, were to be bused 15
miles to Jones Street Junior
High in Alexandria
Jones' enrollment is 54
percent black while Buckeye,
though included in the de
segregation plan, is in a white
rural area and remains all
white.
