Chicago (AP) — A judge who said that
Bernardine Dohrn's 11-year separation
from friends and family was punishment
enough has sentenced the former fugitive
radical to three years probation and a $1500
fine.
Dohrn, 38, was sentenced Tuesday on her
guilty pleas to two counts aggravated bat
tery and two counts of bail-jumping. The
charges were filed in connection with her
participation in a 1969 anti-war protest in
Chicago known as the Days of Rage. A
number of policeman were hurt in the pro
test.
Dohrn, a former leader of the militant
Weather Underground, went into hiding af
ter the protest. She surrendered to author
ities in December and had faced a max
imum of eight years in prison if convicted of
all the charges filed against her.
Meanwhile, in another case involving a
member of the Weather Underground,
Cathlyn Piatt Wilkerson asked a judge in
New York to reduce a three-year prison sen
tence imposed for her role in a fatal 1970 ex

plosion at a radical "bomb factory" in
Greenwich Village.
She said her attorneys would argue for the
reduction at a hearing today. She was to sur
render yesterday to begin her sentence.
In a negotiated agreement reached Tues
day, Dohrn withdrew her earlier plea of in
nocent to all charges — which had also in
cluded mob action and soliciting mob action
— and pleaded guilty to jumping bond and
aggravated battery in attacks on police of
ficers. The other charges were dropped.
Although the court agreement stipulated
that Dohrn struck a police officer with a
club during the disturbances, Michael Ken
nedy, her attorney, told the judge his
client's only weapon that day "was her
tongue, making speeches."
Non-violence
Circuit Court Judge Fred Suria denied a
prosecution request to sentence Dohrn to 30
days in jail in addition to the probation. He
told Dohrn that she had already "paid a pen
alty by giving up contact with your friends
and relations while being underground."

Suria lectured Dohrn on non-violent
methods of achieving changes in society.
"We do have freedom of speech, but it is
conditioned upon mutual respect and
mutual understanding," he said.
"If you wish to change the system, you
don't have to take to the streets," he said.
"Are you ready to join us, regardless of our
political persuasion, race, creed, color or
nationality?"
Dohrn smiled, then replied: "You and I
have different views of the world. I under
stand what you said and I understand what
happened that day."
Wilkerson, 35, who spent 10 years as a
fugitive, told state Supreme Court Justice
Harold Rothwax in court papers that the
sentence would have "grossly harmful psy
chological effect" on her 3-year-old daugh
ter.
Rothwax imposed the sentence in Octo
ber after Wilkerson pleaded guilty to
possession of dynamite. She would be
eligible for parole after one year.
She surrendered in July.
