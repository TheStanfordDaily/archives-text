# Abscam faces due process fight

Newsday
Brooklyn, N.Y. — A top official of the Depart
ment of Justice defended the FBl's Abscam in
vestigation Tuesday, saying that all undercover
agents had followed orders that there "be no am
biguities" when influence money was paid to pub
lic officials.
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Irvin
Nathan, who coordinated the Abscam inquiry,
testified that all government agents and prose
cutors in the investigation were advised to make
certain that "the public officials would under
stand precisely the nature of the transactions."
He added that, after reviewing videotapes of the
payoff meetings, his view was that "the instruc
tions were being carried out."
Nathan's testimony came at an unusual due
process hearing in U.S. District Court in which
seven defendants convicted in three Abscam
trials are attempting to have their convictions ov
erturned because of what they call "outrageous"
government conduct.
Defense attorneys concentrated their efforts on
allegations that con man Melvin Weinberg, a key
undercover operative for the FBI, had put "words
in people's mouths" in connection with the in
vestigation of Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.).
Williams awaits trial on bribery and conspiracy
charges.
As part of their claim that their clients' due

process rights were violated, the defense at
torneys charge that the defendents were
"targeted" for bribes based on their support of
Sen Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) in his bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
Nathan, who spent almost eight hours on the
witness stand, testified that in late 1979 he learned
that Weinberg had coached Williams during a se
cretly-recorded meeting June 28, 1979, just hours
before the senator met with an FBI agent mas
querading as a sheik looking for political favors.
But a department review of the incident, Nathan
said, found no other instances in which Weinberg
coached a subject of the investigation. Nathan
also said that Department of Justice officials and
prosecutors believed the Williams' coaching re
marks were ambiguous and that they decided to
recommend the senator's indictment.
The hearing, which is expected to last at least a
week, was requested by seven men convicted in
trials conducted in Brooklyn. They are: former
Reps. John Murphy (D-N.Y.) Frank Thompson
(D-N.J.) and Michael Myers (D-Pa.); Rep. Ray
mond Lederer (D-Pa.); Mayor Angelo Errichetti
of Camden, N.J.; Philadelphia City Councilman
Louis Johanson, and Howard Criden, Johanson's
former law partner. All were convicted of bribery
and conspiracy, except Murphy, who was con
victed of conspiracy, conflict of interest and re
ceiving an unlawful gratuity.
