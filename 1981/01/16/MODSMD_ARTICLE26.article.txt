# First atomic commission head David Lilienthal dies at 81
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
David Lilienthal, who as a
young man made a commitment
to the development of energy
that led to his becoming a found
ing father of the Tennessee Val
ley Authority and the first chair
man of the Atomic Energy Com
mission, has died in New York
City, it was learned yesterday.
He was 81. He died Wednes
day at Sheraton Centre of a
heart attack after going to the
city from his home in Princeton,
N.J., for a doctor's appoint
ment. Lilienthal was a graduate
of Depaul and Harvard Univer
sities, where he came away with
a Phi Beta Kappa key and a rep
utation as a light-heavyweight
boxer. He entered law practice
in Chicago and, as he said later,
"made a lot of money. But I also
found out how boring it could be.
In 1926 he entered public life,
and for the next 24 years was an
uncommon spokesman for the
utility consumer.
Lilienthal came to the atten
tion of Franklin D. Roosevelt in
1931, where, as special counsel
for the city of Chicago, he re
covered a $20-million over
charge for telephone company
subscribers.
That lengthy fight — which
went to the U.S. Supreme Court
— and Lilienthal's later re
organization of the Wisconsin

Public Service Commission led
President Roosevelt to name
him in 1933 as one of the three
first directors of the Tennessee
Valley Authority.
When TV A first came to the
Tennessee Valley, 14 million
acres of land were sending their
topsoil into the rivers, causing
floods and crippling power
dams.
To serve the area's power
needs, TVA built 21 dams, clear
ing 175.000 acres of land and re
locating 1 200 miles of highway
in one of the most depressed ru
ral areas of the country.
In 1941 Lilienthal became the
$10.000-a-year chairman of the
$750-million project.
During World War 11, TVA
electricity supplied the power
for Oak Ridge, Tenn., the heart
of the Manhattan Project,
which brought the world into the
nuclear age.
And at the war's end, Lilien
thal put together the Lilienthal
Report, a State Department
proposal that all operations in
volving atomic energy, includ
ing control of raw materials,
processing and stockpiling,
should be under international
control.
He seemed, to President
Harry Truman in 1946, the
logical choice to head the first
Atomic Energy Commission.
One of his first duties was to

tell Truman that the "nuclear
umbrella" that Sir Winston
Churchill was saying would pro
tect Europe from postwar Sovi
et aggression did not exist: the
United States did not have a sin
gle usable bomb.
Truman ordered a crash pro
gram to build bombs but also or
dered Lilienthal to make the
atom a force for peace.
His four-year term marked
the start of America's atomic
arsenal, and it, like his TVA
tenure, was not without con
troversy.
In 1949, Sen. Bourke
Hickenlooper. R-lowa, and oth
er Republican senators charged
that lax security in the Atomic
Energy Commission had per
mitted transmission of nuclear
secrets to the Soviet Union, and
Soviet development of the
bomb.
The furor subsided and Lilien
thal left government service in
1950 to establish a company that
offered managerial and techni
cal services to developing na
tions, among them Vietnam.
But nuclear energy remained
a prime concern, and as recent
ly as 1976 he called on a Senate
committee for "a ringing decla
ration by the Congress against
exporting a single additional
gram of plutonium or enriched
uranium...by anyone from this
country to any other country."

ment. Lilienthal was a graduate
of Depaul and Harvard Univer
sities, where he came away with
a Phi Beta Kappa key and a rep
utation as a light-heavyweight
boxer. He entered law practice
in Chicago and, as he said later,
"made a lot of money. But I also
found out how boring it could be.
In 1926 he entered public life,
and for the next 24 years was an
uncommon spokesman for the
utility consumer.
Lilienthal came to the atten
tion of Franklin D. Roosevelt in
1931, where, as special counsel
for the city of Chicago, he re
covered a $20-million over
charge for telephone company
subscribers.
That lengthy fight — which
went to the U.S. Supreme Court
— and Lilienthal's later re
organization of the Wisconsin

Public Service Commission led
President Roosevelt to name
him in 1933 as one of the three
first directors of the Tennessee
Valley Authority.
When TV A first came to the
Tennessee Valley, 14 million
acres of land were sending their
topsoil into the rivers, causing
floods and crippling power
dams.
To serve the area's power
needs, TVA built 21 dams, clear
ing 175.000 acres of land and re
locating 1 200 miles of highway
in one of the most depressed ru
ral areas of the country.
In 1941 Lilienthal became the
$10.000-a-year chairman of the
$750-million project.
During World War 11, TVA
electricity supplied the power
for Oak Ridge, Tenn., the heart
of the Manhattan Project,
which brought the world into the
nuclear age.
And at the war's end, Lilien
thal put together the Lilienthal
Report, a State Department
proposal that all operations in
volving atomic energy, includ
ing control of raw materials,
processing and stockpiling,
should be under international
control.
He seemed, to President
Harry Truman in 1946, the
logical choice to head the first
Atomic Energy Commission.
One of his first duties was to

tell Truman that the "nuclear
umbrella" that Sir Winston
Churchill was saying would pro
tect Europe from postwar Sovi
et aggression did not exist: the
United States did not have a sin
gle usable bomb.
Truman ordered a crash pro
gram to build bombs but also or
dered Lilienthal to make the
atom a force for peace.
His four-year term marked
the start of America's atomic
arsenal, and it, like his TVA
tenure, was not without con
troversy.
In 1949, Sen. Bourke
Hickenlooper. R-lowa, and oth
er Republican senators charged
that lax security in the Atomic
Energy Commission had per
mitted transmission of nuclear
secrets to the Soviet Union, and
Soviet development of the
bomb.
The furor subsided and Lilien
thal left government service in
1950 to establish a company that
offered managerial and techni
cal services to developing na
tions, among them Vietnam.
But nuclear energy remained
a prime concern, and as recent
ly as 1976 he called on a Senate
committee for "a ringing decla
ration by the Congress against
exporting a single additional
gram of plutonium or enriched
uranium...by anyone from this
country to any other country."
