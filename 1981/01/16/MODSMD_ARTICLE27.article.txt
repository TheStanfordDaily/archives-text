# Crowd surrounds lone neo-Nazi; 'overreaction' to Buffalo challenge
## 
### Washington Post 
Buffalo, N.Y. â€” The sight was almost far
cical. There, holding aloft a "White Power"
placard, beside one of the world's only stat
ues of Millard Fillmore, was a single neo-
Nazi, a man so disturbed that last winter he
tried to kill himself by drinking anti-freeze.
Surrounding the neo-Nazi was a ring of
more than 100 reporters, jammed together,
at least a dozen deep. Eleven television
camera crews, including one from Holland,
recorded his every utterance. Fifteen still
cameras clicked at his every move.
Surrounding the reporters was a ring of
blue uniformed Buffalo and Erie County po
lice. Some rode horses, others held vicious
looking German shepherd dogs.
Surrounding the police and spilling onto
Niagara Square across from the art deco
Buffalo City Hall were about 500 anti-Nazis,
assorted leftists and curiosity seekers. The
Revolutionary Socialist League, the
Progressive Labor Party, the International
Committee Against Racism, the Workers
World Party, the Marxist-Leninist Party
and the Young Socialist Alliance were all
there, peddling their newspapers and
philosophies.
The ostensible reason was that Karl Hand
Jr., who has drifted among various Ku Klux
Klan and Nazi groups for the last decade,
had called on "100 white men with guts" to
join him in a white-power rally on the birth
day of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
Tension runs high
This set off an orgy of overreaction. Local
television stations treated the event like the
coming of World War 111. "The Stage Is Set
in Buffalo, but for What... ?" blared a head
line across the front page of The Buffalo
Courier Express yesterday morning. The
police commissioner called out 350 law en
forcement officers.
"I've never seen anything like this," one
businessman said as a camera crew brushed
past him. "The press gave an awful lot of
credibility to a couple of nuts," Mayor

James Griffin complained.
It all could be dismissed lightly if it were
not for a series of tragedies that have raised
racial tensions in this tough blue-collar city
on Lake Erie. Since September, seven black
men in Buffalo and one in nearby Rochester
have been killed in brutal attacks police say
were racially motivated.
Brutal killings
Within 36 hours last September, four
blacks, including a 14-year-old boy sitting in
a supermarket parking lot. were shot point
blank in the head by a man dubbed "the .22-
caliber killer." In October, two black tax
icab drivers were bludgeoned to death and
their hearts were cut out.
More recently, five blacks have been
stabbed, two fatally, by a white man de
scribed as in his late 20s or early 30s with a
medium build and blond hair. The attacks
have been incredibly brazen.
One example, on New Year's Eve Albert
Menefee, 32, went into a drugstore near
downtown to buy a pack of cigarettes just
after 4 p.m. As he left, a white man in a
green three-quarter-length jacket, who mo
ments before had been chatting peacefully
with a black woman at a bus stop, walked up
to him and plunged a knife into his chest,
puncturing his lung and heart.
Fear and suspicion
Menefee survived, thanks to some skillful
open-heart surgery. But the attacks on him
and the other blacks heightened an air of
fear and suspicion in the city, so much so
that many black men now routinely carry
revolvers and knives. Not a single suspect
has been arrested.
"This is a very serious matter. It is noth
ing to joke about," Juan Cruz, a 24-year-old
college student, said Thursday. "To me, the
investigation is going very slowly. If there
had been white people killed, something
would have been done by now. How many
lives have to be lost before they arrest a sus
pect?"
It was into this environment that Hand

stepped last month, announcing his rally.
He says he is the western New York coordi-,
nator for the National Socialist Party of
America, the same group that was involved
in a melee in Greensboro, N.C., last year
that resulted in five deaths. The party says
it believes whites should form a separate ,
nation out of the states of North Carolina
and South Carolina and secede from the un
ion
Drawing attention
Hand admits he wanted to attract atten-"
tion He certainly did. The Black Forum, a
group of traditional black leaders, promptly
began plans for a noon rally to observe'
King's birthday. A more militant group, the
Martin Luther King Day Memorial Rally
Coalition, announced that it would hold a
demonstration opposite the Nazis.
Mayor Griffin, fearing a violent confron
tation between Nazis and anti-Nazis, threat
ened to arrest anyone who showed up for the
coalition rally. Meanwhile, civic, religious
and political leaders pledged support for the
Black Forum demonstration
The only recognizable Nazi to show up
yesterday was Hand Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, (D-N.Y.), three area con
gressmen, dozens of major religious and
civic leaders and several thousand demon
strators showed up for the Black Forum ral
ly. They cheered calls for racial broth
erhood and sang "We Shall Overcome."
There were no arrests during the day. The
only potentially dangerous incident oc
curred when a TV cameraman accidentally
broke a window above a sidewalk where
several early-morning demonstrators were
standing.
Buffalo had proven itself, said the Rev.
Will Brown Jr., chairman of the Black Fo
rum "It was a devastating rejection of Na
zism."
But Hand wasn't disappointed. "We ac
complished a good deal. We got our message
across," he said. "I feel this is a first step."
