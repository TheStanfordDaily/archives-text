# Court appoints Mann special master

### Kathy Bodovitz 
The Supreme Court of the United
States has appointed Professor J.
Keith Mann, associate dean for
academic affairs of the Stanford Law
School, to serve as special master in
the case of United States v. Alaska.
Mann explained that when the Con
stitution was drawn up, it gave the Su
preme Court original jurisdiction in
cases between the United States gov
ernment and individual states. How
ever. because it usually functions only
as a court of appeal, the Supreme
Court does not have the means to hear
original cases.
For practical purposes, Mann said,
the Court appoints special masters in
cases between states and the federal
government. The master hears the
case and then submits his findings and
recommendations in a report to the
Court.
The case United States v. Alaska
involves the boundary between areas
of state and federal interest along the
northern coast of Alaska, from Icy

Cape east to the Canadian border, a
distance of approximately 500 miles
Boundary determinations
The Court is being asked to rule on
several issues of first impression in
making seaward boundary determina
tions. The outcome will determine ti
tle to lands containing oil reserves
amounting to as much as $2 billion.
In July Mann held two days of hear
ings in the Stanford Law School's Moot
Court Room. Afterwards, Mann,
along with Louis Clairborne, counsel
for the United States, and G. Thomas
Koester, counsel for Alaska, flew to
Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, for an inspec
tion tour.
Clairborne is the deputy solicitor
general of the U.S., while Koester is
assistant attorney general of the State
of Alaska
The disputed areas are submerged
lands seaward of the mainland and, in
most instances, landward of offshore
barrier islands. The issues arise in
three separate contexts.
The first issue concerns the

northern boundary of National Petro
leum Reserve-Alaska, located in the
western region of the north coast of
Alaska. This reserve was established
by President Warren Harding in 1923
to assure that the extensive oil sup
plies known to exist there would be
preserved and available to the Navy in
a national emergency.
State acquired lands
The State of Alaska, through its
Statehood Act and another act, the
Submerged Land Act, acquired rights
to minerals seaward of the reserve.
The northern boundary of the reserve,
specifically where the boundary lies in
relation to Harrison, Smith and Peard
Bays, must be determined to establish
the dividing line between these state
and federal rights.
Next, to the east is an area of ex
tensive petroleum development, in
cluding Prudhoe Bay. There is no re
serve involved here and the state is ac
knowledged to have exclusive mineral
rights beneath inland waters and
within three miles of the coast.
There is disagreement, however, as
to whether waters between the main
land and a series of offshore islands
belong to Alaska. There is also dis
agreement as to whether one of these
"islands" even exists. (In this particu
lar region, it is anticipated that data
will be collected by monitoring tidal
gauges for a year before the facts are
presented.)
The disputed submerged lands have
already been leased in a joint feder
al/state lease sale. Oil companies paid

bonuses of some $400,000,000 for the
right to obtain leases in these disputed
areas. It is expected that royalties of
three or four times that much will ac
crue from oil and gas production.
Further disputes
The third region lies further east
Here, 4!he Court is being asked to de
termine the boundary of anther feder
al reserve, the Arctic National Wild
life Range, and to determine whether
the submerged lands within the re
serve, if any, were excluded from the
Submerged Lands Act's grant to the
state.
