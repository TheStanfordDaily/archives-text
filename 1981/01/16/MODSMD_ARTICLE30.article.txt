# Will Stanford keep up consistent play?
## Washington schools visit the Farm 
### Chris Haft 
Without a doubt. Stanford
maintains a hallowed athletic
tradition. Memories of the
countless gridiron epics that
have unfolded in Stanford Stadi
um stir the soul. The mere sight
of the Cardinal-and-white
adorning the uniforms of the
sons and daughters of Stanford

makes one misty-eyed.
And the knack all Stanford
squads have for following a
strong performance with a poor
one or losing to schools that
belong in intramural competi
tion bring Cardinal fans,
players and coaches alike closer
to alcohol, suicide or Berkeley.
Dick Dißiaso can do without

that last traditional aspect of
Stanford sports. The sixth-year
coach, whose men's basketball
team faces Washington tonight
at 7:30 and Washington State
tomorrow night in Maples
Pavilion, hopes to see the Cards
sustain their improved level of
play rather than sink back into
shabbiness.
"It always seems Stanford
will play well — not just in
basketball — and turn around
and not play well ... but I think
we're different,'' Dißiaso said.
Whether or not this Stanford
team is different will be dis
covered this weekend. The
Cards, 5-7 overall, have played
encouragingly in the Pacific-10
Conference despite their 1-2 re
cord, but they need to continue
their strengthened efforts to
prove that they don't belong at
the bottom of the conference
standings.
If the Pac-10 ran a jewelry
store, you wouldn't find Wash
ington (7-6 overall) or Washing
ton State (8-5) in the display
case. Indeed, both the Huskies
and the Cougars own 1-3 con
ference records. Like Oregon,
these are the teams that the
Cards have to beat — because
it's difficult to envision UCLA,
USC, Arizona State or Oregon
State losing to Stanford.
Neither team features a par
ticularly outstanding player,
nor will either squad's size pose
a problem for Stanford. How
ever, according to Dißiaso, the
Cards had better be ready to
run, run, run . . . and then run
some more.
"Washington is a running
team." Dißiaso said. "They
want to press, and they want it
to be an 'up-tempo' game.
Washington State is also very
quick — maybe quicker than
they've ever been."
Andra Griffin, Washington's
top scorer, averages 18.1 points
per game and plays smoothly
around the basket. The Huskies'
best guard is Bob Fronk. whose

surname sounds like a Dr. Seuss
character (imagine "The Fronk
Who Stole Christmas") but nev
ertheless scores 12 8 each out
ing.
Stanford will have to watch
out for 6-foot-8 forward Dan
Caldwell, who surprised every
body by collecting 41 points and
17 rebounds last weekend, in
cluding successive career scor
ing highs of 18 against Arizona
and 23 the next night against Ar
izona State.
Washington State will be
weakened by the absence of for
ward Angelo Hill, the team's
leader in both scoring (14.0) and
rebounding (7.3). The 6-foot-6
senior dislocated his shoulder
late in the second half against
Arizona State and did not make
the trip.
No team with George Ravel
ing as its coach, however, is tru
ly weak. A superb motivator,
Raveling has done a commen
dable job in maintaining a win
ning record this year despite
losing all five starters from last
year's 22-6 club.
To try to recoup his personnel
losses. Raveling recruited un
usually heavily from the junior
college ranks, picking up four
JUCO players — guards Tyrone
Brown and Ken McFadden and
forwards Ollie Johnson and
Ronnie Jovner — all of whom
will probably start against Stan
ford.
Notes — The Cards have won
their last three games in Maples
against Washington, including a
79-78 decision in overtime last
year. Washington State, mean
while, has spanked Stanford 10
times in a row . . . Stanford has
been outscored in the second
half in 11 of 12 games this year, a
distressing statistic . . . Three
Card starters are shooting bet
ter than 80 percent from the
free-throw line: Doug Marty
(88.2), Keith Jones (83.3) and
Brian Welch (81.0).

um stir the soul. The mere sight
of the Cardinal-and-white
adorning the uniforms of the
sons and daughters of Stanford

makes one misty-eyed.
And the knack all Stanford
squads have for following a
strong performance with a poor
one or losing to schools that
belong in intramural competi
tion bring Cardinal fans,
players and coaches alike closer
to alcohol, suicide or Berkeley.
Dick Dißiaso can do without

that last traditional aspect of
Stanford sports. The sixth-year
coach, whose men's basketball
team faces Washington tonight
at 7:30 and Washington State
tomorrow night in Maples
Pavilion, hopes to see the Cards
sustain their improved level of
play rather than sink back into
shabbiness.
"It always seems Stanford
will play well — not just in
basketball — and turn around
and not play well ... but I think
we're different,'' Dißiaso said.
Whether or not this Stanford
team is different will be dis
covered this weekend. The
Cards, 5-7 overall, have played
encouragingly in the Pacific-10
Conference despite their 1-2 re
cord, but they need to continue
their strengthened efforts to
prove that they don't belong at
the bottom of the conference
standings.
If the Pac-10 ran a jewelry
store, you wouldn't find Wash
ington (7-6 overall) or Washing
ton State (8-5) in the display
case. Indeed, both the Huskies
and the Cougars own 1-3 con
ference records. Like Oregon,
these are the teams that the
Cards have to beat — because
it's difficult to envision UCLA,
USC, Arizona State or Oregon
State losing to Stanford.
Neither team features a par
ticularly outstanding player,
nor will either squad's size pose
a problem for Stanford. How
ever, according to Dißiaso, the
Cards had better be ready to
run, run, run . . . and then run
some more.
"Washington is a running
team." Dißiaso said. "They
want to press, and they want it
to be an 'up-tempo' game.
Washington State is also very
quick — maybe quicker than
they've ever been."
Andra Griffin, Washington's
top scorer, averages 18.1 points
per game and plays smoothly
around the basket. The Huskies'
best guard is Bob Fronk. whose

surname sounds like a Dr. Seuss
character (imagine "The Fronk
Who Stole Christmas") but nev
ertheless scores 12 8 each out
ing.
Stanford will have to watch
out for 6-foot-8 forward Dan
Caldwell, who surprised every
body by collecting 41 points and
17 rebounds last weekend, in
cluding successive career scor
ing highs of 18 against Arizona
and 23 the next night against Ar
izona State.
Washington State will be
weakened by the absence of for
ward Angelo Hill, the team's
leader in both scoring (14.0) and
rebounding (7.3). The 6-foot-6
senior dislocated his shoulder
late in the second half against
Arizona State and did not make
the trip.
No team with George Ravel
ing as its coach, however, is tru
ly weak. A superb motivator,
Raveling has done a commen
dable job in maintaining a win
ning record this year despite
losing all five starters from last
year's 22-6 club.
To try to recoup his personnel
losses. Raveling recruited un
usually heavily from the junior
college ranks, picking up four
JUCO players — guards Tyrone
Brown and Ken McFadden and
forwards Ollie Johnson and
Ronnie Jovner — all of whom
will probably start against Stan
ford.
Notes — The Cards have won
their last three games in Maples
against Washington, including a
79-78 decision in overtime last
year. Washington State, mean
while, has spanked Stanford 10
times in a row . . . Stanford has
been outscored in the second
half in 11 of 12 games this year, a
distressing statistic . . . Three
Card starters are shooting bet
ter than 80 percent from the
free-throw line: Doug Marty
(88.2), Keith Jones (83.3) and
Brian Welch (81.0).
Without a doubt. Stanford
maintains a hallowed athletic
tradition. Memories of the
countless gridiron epics that
have unfolded in Stanford Stadi
um stir the soul. The mere sight
of the Cardinal-and-white
adorning the uniforms of the
sons and daughters of Stanford

makes one misty-eyed.
