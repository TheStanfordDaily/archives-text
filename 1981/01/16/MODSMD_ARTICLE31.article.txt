# Cards visit Fresno tomorrow evening

"Any team can win this
division and every game will
hard-fought. We have as much
talent as anyone." That's what
women's basketball coach Dot
ty McCrea said about Stanford's
chances this year.
After getting off on the wrong
foot Saturday in a 75-66 NorCal
Conference loss to San Jose
State, the Cards will try to even
their record tomorrow night
against the Fresno State Bull
dogs in Fresno. Any team may
be able to win the division, but if
Stanford drops to 0-2, their
chances will be sorely limited.
Yet McCrea saw some good
things come out of the league
opening loss to the Spartans. "In
the five years I've been here it's
been one of the hardest-fought
games I've seen. If we can play
with that intensity all year,
we'll be tough to beat."
McCrea explained the team
"came up short because of the
free throws — San Jose State
scored 25 from the line, while
we only scored seven. You just
can't beat a team that scores

that many more than you at the
free throw line."
Fresno State is a "balanced"
team, according to McCrea. The
coach feels the Cards should
beat Fresno State if they play as
well as they did against the
Spartans. "We have to win, if
we hope to beat the tougher
teams in our conference."
In order to beat the Bulldogs,
Stanford hopes to get the ball in
side, where Louise Smith does
the dirty work. They did it well
against San Jose State, and with
a week to prepare for Fresno
State, this should be the Cards'
first conference win.
With an overall record of 9-8,
Stanford could use another win.
Most of their remaining games
are league games, and if they
hope to qualify for postseason
play, they can't afford to lose
very many.
The Fresno State game is the
first of three in a row on the road
for Stanford. The Cards will
travel to USF and UOP before
returning home for three
straight games.
