# Hall of Fame honors go only to Gibson

### 
New York (AP) — Bob
Gibson, one of the premier
pitchers of his time, is the
newest member of the baseball
Hall of Fame, elected alone yes
terday by the Baseball Writers
Association of America.
Gibson was an overwhelming
choice in his first year of
eligibility, named on 337 of the
401 ballots cast by veteran
members of the BBWAA. No
other candidate came close to
the 301 votes — or 75 percent —
required for election.
Former Dodger pitcher Don
Drysdale finished second with
243 votes — 58 short of election.
The late Gil Hodges, another
former Dodger, was third with
241.
Slugger Harmon Killebrew,
fifth on ther all-time home run
list with 573 and another first
year candidate, finished fourth
with 239, one more than relief
ace Hoyt Wilhelm.
Juan Marichal, a pitching
contempory of Gibson's and an
other first-year candidate, had
233. None of the other 33 can
didates received more than 200
votes.
Gibson became the 11th man
elected to the Cooperstown
shrine in his first year of
eligibility, sharing that singular
distinction with A 1 Kaline, Ted

Williams. Stan Musial, Bob
Feller, Jackie Robinson, Sandy
Koufax, Ernie Banks, Willie
Mays, Warren Spahn and
Mickey Mantle.
"That didn't affect me until I
saw the guys who made it in
their first year." said Gibson.
"That's some pretty fast com
pany."
Gibson, of course, was a pret
ty fast pitcher. He won 251
games in 17 seasons with the St.
Louis Cardinals with a career
2.91 earned run average and
3 117 strikeouts. Only three oth
er men in baseball history —
Walter Johnson, Gaylord Perry
and Nolan Ryan — have struck
out more than 3 000 batters in
their careers.
Five times, Gibson won 20 or
more games in a season and his
best year from a won-lost stand
point was 1970 when he was 23-7.
But the season he remembers
best is 1968, the year he posted a
22-9 record and set a record with
a 1.12 earned run average.
"I can't remember having a
bad start that season," he said.
"I did everything right. Every
thing I threw was knee-high and
on the corner. It was a once-in-a
lifetime year. I cherish that sea
son."
Pitchers were dominating the
game at that time and baseball
