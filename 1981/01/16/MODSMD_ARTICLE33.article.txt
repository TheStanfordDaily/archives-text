## Raveling wins on court, not in 
### Steve Odell 
If it would have been up to
him, George Raveling would
have been working as an at
torney right now.
But through an odd twist of
fate. Raveling ended up turning
in his goal of a world of Brooks
Brothers suits and briefcases
for a pair of sweatpants and a
playbook. He no longer desired
to try and win in a court, but on
one.
Raveling is currently the
head basketball coach at Wash
ington State, but as he described
the transformation, "It was all
kind of by accident. I never real
ly had any desire to become a
coach. It just sort of happened."
And the people in Pullman,
Wash, are glad it did. The
Cougars, who face Stanford
tomorrow night at Maples
Pavilion, have rolled up the sec
ond-best record in the Pacific-10
Conference over the past five
years, including a third-place
finish in the conference last
year and a berth in the NCAA
tournament.
Raveling was working as a
marketing analyst with his eye
on law school when his former
coach at Villanova, Jack Kraft,
jokingly offered him an assis
tant coaching position.
The joke became reality as
Raveling, "bored" with what he
was doing, took the job. But he
insists that coaching "wasn't a
lifelong dream. It was just a ca
reer change."
Raveling expressed how for
tunate he feels that he made the
change. "I feel being a coach is
one of the most unique op
portunities that God can give a
person. It's very fulfilling to
know that I have the ability to
influence a young person's
growth pattern and influence it
in a positive manner. I can help

him grow as a person, a student,
and as an athlete," he said.
"1 have the opportunity to in
still in a young person's life
something which is lacking in
society as a whole, and that's
discipline," he added.
Another thing which Raveling
instills in his players is the im
portance of defense in the col
lege game. "You don't need a lot
of talent to play defense,"
Raveling noted "All it takes is
mental toughness, discipline,
and togetherness. Offensively,
anybody can have an off-night.
But you should never have an
off-night on defense, because
you can control it,"he said.

"The common denominator
for success in athletics is ul
timately how well you can ex
ecute what you know. Our de
fense at Washington State is the
best-kept secret around. Just
because we don't groan and fall
on the floor a lot. we're not rec
ognized. But we currently rank
17th in the nation in team de
fense."
Raveling's team this year is

going to need a lot of execution
in just the right places, for the
Cougars lost six players (and all
five 1980 starters) to gradu
ation.
"We're definitely in the proc
ess of rebuilding," Raveling ad
mitted. "But we're starting to
evolve into a good basketball
team. Against Arizona, we
started five kids who weren't
even enrolled at Washington
State last year."
Raveling shifted his praise
from his team to Stanford's.
"I'm a Dick Dißiaso fan. I think
he's done an outstanding job
down there," said Raveling. "I
don't think people realize how
difficult it is to win at Stanford,
and that bothers me. He's got a
difficult recruiting job.
"You can be the greatest
coach in the world, but if you
don't have the horses, you're not
going to win," Raveling went
on. "You have to realize that
Stanford is trying to compete
with a rifle, while the rest of the
conference is loaded with can
nons. I think it's a helluva feat to
compete in this league when you
have the poorest armaments."
But Raveling sees light at the
end of the Cards' basketball tun
nel. "I'd take any one of them,"
he said, referring to Stanford's
new freshman class. "If they
want to come and play for me,
they can. They're going to be
heard from."
So will George Raveling, you
can be sure, no matter what new
career lies ahead of him. Be
cause coaching, Raveling
knows, cannot last forever.
"The only reason you get
hired is so you can be fired," he
said. "If you're around long
enough, they're gonna sound the
trumpets for you sooner or lat
er." ,

don't think people realize how
difficult it is to win at Stanford,
and that bothers me. He's got a
difficult recruiting job.
"You can be the greatest
coach in the world, but if you
don't have the horses, you're not
going to win," Raveling went
on. "You have to realize that
Stanford is trying to compete
with a rifle, while the rest of the
conference is loaded with can
nons. I think it's a helluva feat to
compete in this league when you
have the poorest armaments."
But Raveling sees light at the
end of the Cards' basketball tun
nel. "I'd take any one of them,"
he said, referring to Stanford's
new freshman class. "If they
want to come and play for me,
they can. They're going to be
heard from."
So will George Raveling, you
can be sure, no matter what new
career lies ahead of him. Be
cause coaching, Raveling
knows, cannot last forever.
"The only reason you get
hired is so you can be fired," he
said. "If you're around long
enough, they're gonna sound the
trumpets for you sooner or lat
er." ,

If it would have been up to
him, George Raveling would
have been working as an at
torney right now.
But through an odd twist of
fate. Raveling ended up turning
in his goal of a world of Brooks
Brothers suits and briefcases
for a pair of sweatpants and a
playbook. He no longer desired
to try and win in a court, but on
one.
Raveling is currently the
head basketball coach at Wash
ington State, but as he described
the transformation, "It was all
kind of by accident. I never real
ly had any desire to become a
coach. It just sort of happened."
And the people in Pullman,
Wash, are glad it did. The
Cougars, who face Stanford
tomorrow night at Maples
Pavilion, have rolled up the sec
ond-best record in the Pacific-10
Conference over the past five
years, including a third-place
finish in the conference last
year and a berth in the NCAA
tournament.
Raveling was working as a
marketing analyst with his eye
on law school when his former
coach at Villanova, Jack Kraft,
jokingly offered him an assis
tant coaching position.
The joke became reality as
Raveling, "bored" with what he
was doing, took the job. But he
insists that coaching "wasn't a
lifelong dream. It was just a ca
reer change."
Raveling expressed how for
tunate he feels that he made the
change. "I feel being a coach is
one of the most unique op
portunities that God can give a
person. It's very fulfilling to
know that I have the ability to
influence a young person's
growth pattern and influence it
in a positive manner. I can help

him grow as a person, a student,
and as an athlete," he said.
"1 have the opportunity to in
still in a young person's life
something which is lacking in
society as a whole, and that's
discipline," he added.
Another thing which Raveling
instills in his players is the im
portance of defense in the col
lege game. "You don't need a lot
of talent to play defense,"
Raveling noted "All it takes is
mental toughness, discipline,
and togetherness. Offensively,
anybody can have an off-night.
But you should never have an
off-night on defense, because
you can control it,"he said.

"The common denominator
for success in athletics is ul
timately how well you can ex
ecute what you know. Our de
fense at Washington State is the
best-kept secret around. Just
because we don't groan and fall
on the floor a lot. we're not rec
ognized. But we currently rank
17th in the nation in team de
fense."
Raveling's team this year is

going to need a lot of execution
in just the right places, for the
Cougars lost six players (and all
five 1980 starters) to gradu
ation.
"We're definitely in the proc
ess of rebuilding," Raveling ad
mitted. "But we're starting to
evolve into a good basketball
team. Against Arizona, we
started five kids who weren't
even enrolled at Washington
State last year."
Raveling shifted his praise
from his team to Stanford's.
"I'm a Dick Dißiaso fan. I think
he's done an outstanding job
down there," said Raveling. "I
don't think people realize how
difficult it is to win at Stanford,
and that bothers me. He's got a
difficult recruiting job.
"You can be the greatest
