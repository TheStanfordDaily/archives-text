# The 						Cardinal freshmen — saving a team in distress

Knights in white sneakers.
That's what the quartet of
Keith Jones, Roger Lemons,
John Revelli, and Hans
Wichary could have been
billed as — four young eager
recruits, all with impressive
prep credentials, dribbling
onto the Farm to rescue a
basketball program in dis
tress.
Though they're only
freshmen, many observers
feel that the foursome can
provide Stanford's ticket out
of the depths of the Pacific-10
Conference standings.
The climb won't be an easy
one, however. Although as a
group they have contributed
greatly to Stanford's upsw
ing this season, it takes long
er than 12 games to make the
jump from high school to ma
jor college competition.
"They have had to adjust
to the quickness, size and
physicalness of the teams
they're playing against, and
they have had to incorporate
into a new system of play,"
said head coach Dick
Dißiaso, who pointed out
that like most freshmen,
they have also had to contend
with being away from home
and the academic rigors of
Stanford.
"I think they have
progressed very well, espe
cially considering that two to
four of them are usually in
the game together at one
time ... all four are playing
positions they didn't play in
high school, but they're ad
justing well," he said.
Some make the transition
faster than others, but, then
again, they're supposed to.
Revelli, a 6-foot-7Vz, 220-
pounder from Scarsdale,
N.Y.. was Stanford's top re
cruit and has started 11 of the
12 games at center. He led
Scarsdale High School to a
22-2 record his senior year
and achieved All-State status
from Basketball Weekly.
Prior to his senior campaign
he was honored as a pre-sea
son All-America.
The freshman is currently
the Cardinals' second lead
ing scorer and rebounder
with 11.8 points and 7.1 re
bounds per game. Against
UC-Irvine earlier this season
Revelli exploded for 22
points and 11 rebounds, and
he sank four free throws in
the final two minutes of the
Oregon game to help pre
serve the 82-76 victory.
When Revelli announced
his intent to play for the
Cards he was expected to see
most of his action at for

ward, but the lack of a domi
nant Card center has forced
the husky New Yorker to the
pivot. Contending with usual
ly taller centers has been his
biggest adjustment.
"I'm playing center
against guys 6-foot-10, 6-
foot-11. I was expecting to
play forward this year, but it
doesn't make that big of a
difference," he said.
As for being thrust into a
starting role, Revelli said, "I
thought I had a chance at
starting at least (before he
arrived) so I was kind of pre
pared. Now I'm gaining con
fidence. I was a little nervous
at first and didn't know what
to expect. "
One recruit who has ex
ceeded expectations is
Jones, a 6-foot-2 speedster
from Phoenix who was rec
ognized as the Arizona State
Player of the Year in his

division as a senior. The
flashy guard leads the team
in field goal percentage with
a .548 mark and is second in
assists with 25. Dißiaso
pointed out that Jones has
shown great improvement in
the last six games.
"Coach kept getting on me
about being aggressive of
fensively, which is sort of un
usual, most people don't
have that problem. I could
feel the confidence he had in
me and it's helped my
game," Jones said.
Ironically, Jones' biggest
adjustment here was gearing
down from high school
basketball. "One of the big
ger adjustments was learn
ing to play a controlled
game. In high school we
played run-and-gun. We had
the fastest team in the state.
Here I had to learn when not
to take shots," he said.

Lemons, a 6-foot-5 guard
from Anaheim, had the op
posite transition problem.
"In high school you can roam
around, take it slow, but in
the Pac-10 you have to exert
yourself all the time. You're
really tired by the end of the
game," he noted.
Heralded for his leaping
ability. Lemons impressed
the Stanford crowd in the
season opener against Air
Force when he took an outlet
pass and slam-dunked it in
the game's early going. Since
then he has started four
games, and contributed 15
points against UC-Irvine.
Rounding out the Four
Freshmen is Wichary, a San
Diego native who averaged
26.3 points and 12.8 rebounds
his senior year. The son of a
native German tennis pro
fessional, Wichary is lauded
for a pretty outside shot that
usually goes through clean.

The greatest change for
Wichary here? "Probably
going from the No. 1 player
on a team to someone who
has to fight for a position. I
use to play for a team where
not everyone was a good
player. Now I'm playing on a
team where everyone is
adept at what they're
doing," he said
Although he hasn't seen as
much action as the other
three newcomers Wichary
pointed out, "The quality of
basketball is what I ex
pected. I'm getting better all
the time."
If Stanford is to reverse
the direction of its basketball
program in the future much
is going to depend on how
these four settle into the
Pac-10. They form the cor
nerstone on which Dißiaso
will attempt to build a win
ning team.
