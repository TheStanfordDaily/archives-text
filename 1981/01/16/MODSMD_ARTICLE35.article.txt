# 'Walker's Wounded' go south
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Only two weeks into the 1981 gymnastics sea
son and the Stanford women's team is doing an
imitation of a soap opera.
Checking the roster for this weekend's
meets with powerhouses USC and UCLA is
more like reading off a casualty list. Un
fortunately, changing the channels on this pro
gram won't cure the injuries.
According to head coach Jackie Walker,
Trina Wiggins will probably be lost for the sea
son due to a re-injured knee suffered while
working out for the Aloha Gymfest in Hawaii
over the vacation. The junior from Oakland
holds the school records in vaulting with a 9.50
score and 8.99 average during last season.
Freshman Anne Friend has a swollen knee,
the result of a hard landing during the vaulting
competition of last Friday's dual meet. She has
spent this week "trying awfully hard" to be
ready for the upcoming competition.
Junior Karen Hall is testing out a sore ankle,
injured on a balance beam dismount during the
Gymfest. She may be able to compete on un
even parallel bars.
"Merilyn (Chapman) wants to compete in
all-around really badly, but. I don't know —
we'll have to see," said Walker. "I'll definitely
let her do bars and beam again, but I don't
know about the other two (events — vaulting
and floor exercise)."
Chapman hit a 9.00 bar routine to earn third
place and won the beam event last week with a
Stanford high mark of 9.40, breaking the pre
vious mark of 9.35 which she set Dec. 5 in the
Stanford Collegiate Pairs Invitational. She sat
out vaulting and floor to avoid straining her

sore knees.
Representing the "Walker Wounded" in all
around competition will be Jeanette Lacoste,
Julie Bledsoe, Caryn Lucido and Anne Smith.
"The injuries to our top two, Merilyn and
Karen, are injuries that are healing , so it's
just going to be another tough weekend,"
Walker said. "We have (to face) two of the top
teams in the country and we're not at top
strength. If we can get through this weekend
and let their injuries heal up a little bit, we
should be looking a lot stronger later on in the
season."
Ranked 16th in the country, Stanford is still
behind the other two teams. UCLA is No. 4 in
the country, while USC comes in at 14th.
Leading USC will be freshman Suzy
Kellems, who represented the Trojans in the
mixed pairs competition, was a member of the
national team and placed 19th in all-around at
the world championships last winter.
Sophomore Sharon Shapiro heads the Bruin
team Last season she was the collegiate all
around champion as well as being the winner of
all four event*, the first time that feat had been
accomplished.
Sizing up her team's southern California
hosts, Walker said, "UCLA should be, I think,
better than Fullerton (who Stanford lost to last
week). We might be able to beat USC — they're
a team that's very similar to us because they
have a couple of outstanding people and some
fairly good backup but with minor problems.
But we don't have the depth that UCLA has.
Saturday will be another learning ex
perience."

nastics meet at Maples Pavilion. Chapman will be one of the few Cardinals healthy enough to
travel to southern California this weekend for Stanford's encounters with USC and UCLA.
