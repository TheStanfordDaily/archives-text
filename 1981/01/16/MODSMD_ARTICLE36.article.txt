### Fred Wainwright 
The Stanford men's swim
team, half of which is made up
of freshmen, began its series of
competitions with a solid 86-27
victory over Brigham Young
University yesterday at de-
Guerre Pool.
The women's team also dis
played its AIAW championship
potential, breaking an early
26-26 tie and eventually winning,
67-46.
In the men's races, Stanford
shut out BYU, denying the
Cougars a single victory. BYU
head coach Tim Powers ac
knowledged that Stanford has a
strong team, and explained that
his swimmers are "very
young."
Stanford's young swimmers,

however, fared better. "The
freshmen came through and
shone," Card men's head coach
Skip Kenney said.
In the women's meet, BYU
opened with several close vic
tories, but Stanford managed to
take over during the short-dis
tance races. The Cards ex
tended the margin in the medi
um- and long-distance races.
Anne Tweedy won three races
for the Cards, and expressed
satisfaction with her per
formance. "I feel good about the
wins, but it was my thinking
about the team that spurred me
on," she said.
Women's coach Holger
Dietze said that BYU's relative
lack of depth ultimately made
the difference.
