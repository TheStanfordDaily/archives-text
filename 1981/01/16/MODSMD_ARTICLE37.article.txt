# Farm loses 'voice'; Klein goes to 49ers
## 
### Chris Haft 
Don Klein has exchanged
Pullman for Pittsburgh and
Tempe for Tampa Bay. No more
drives through Colfax, Wash, or
cramped, rickety press boxes
for him.
The voice of Stanford football
and basketball for 25 years will
relinquish his ties with the
Cardinals to broadcast the San
Francisco 49ers football games
on KCBS, it was announced yes
terday.
Despite being KCBS' sports
director, Klein had announced
the Stanford games on KSFO for
the past 12 years after KCBS
shifted to all-news program
ming.
When KCBS acquired the
rights to the 49ers' games from
KSFO recently, however, veter
an San Francisco announcer
Lon Simmons decided to main
tain his allegiances to KSFO,
for which he will be broad
casting Oakland A s baseball
games this season. This left the
49ers without an announcer, and
Klein, being KCBS' top an
nouncer, a recognized voice in
the Bay Area and popular with
the 49er brass, became Sim
mons' logical successor.
Leaving Stanford sports was
not easy for Klein, who felt in
credibly faithful to the
Cardinals. "I spent time
through the small hours of the
morning thinking about this
one," he said.
The Farm, Klein felt, was an
ideal place to work.
"I have such a tremendous re

spect for Stanford," he said. "I
have such a respect for the way
they run that (athletic) pro
gram, especially in view of the
way things have gone in the rest
of the (Pacific-10) conference. I
feel they set a model for the
country. It set a standard for me
to live up to, and I hope I have.
And it's kind of tough to end that
relationship."
"Pon's a great friend and sup
porter of Stanford athletics,"
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
acknowledged.
How will Klein spend his Sat
urdays during football season
from now on? "I'm gonna come
to Stanford football games," he
said, his voice brightening. As
the KCBS sports director, Klein
said he will continue to attend
practices and games and report
extensively on Stanford sports.
Klein, who signed a new
three-year contract, said he did
not actively seek the job when
KCBS picked up the 49ers'
rights.
"I can't say it ever entered
my mind," he said. "Even when
KCBS got the package, I did not
consider it because the 49ers
wanted Lon Simmons. I wel
comed the situation of Lon doing
those games."
Geiger, who has been in Mi
ami most of this week for the
NCAA convention, had no idea
who the next Stanford announc
er would be, nor did he know
when a decision would be made.
He said he will eventually make
the choice along with KSFO sta
tion manager Jim Meyers.
