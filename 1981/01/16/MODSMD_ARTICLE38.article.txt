New York (AP) — Philadel
phia forward Julius Erving, the
Most Valuable Player in the 1977
National Basketball Associa
tion All-Star Game, was the
leading vote-getter in fan ballot
ing to determine the starters for
this year's contest, th'e league
announced yesterday.
Erving, the player most re
sponsible for the 76ers being
atop the Atlantic Division with
the best record in the league this
season, received 304.600 votes in
earning his fifth consecutive
starting berth on the Eastern
Conference team.
With Erving in the East's
starting lineup are forward Dan
Roundfield and guard Eddie
Johnson, both of the Atlanta
Hawks, and center Artis
Gilmore and guard Reggie
Theus, both of the Chicago
Bulls.
Center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
of the Los Angeles Lakers was
the top vote-getter for the
Western Conference team with
265.200 votes.
Starting with Abdul-Jabbar
for the West will be forwards
Adrian Dantley of the Utah
Jazz, the league's leading

scorer, and Walter Davis of the
Phoenix Suns, and guards Paul
Westphal of the Seattle Super-
Sonics and George Gervin of the
San Antonio Spurs.
Gervin was the MVP in last
year's contest after scoring a
game-high 34 points and leading
the East to a 144-136 overtime
victory over the West at Land
over. Md. San Antonio was
switched from the Eastern Con
ference to the West this season.
This year's nationally tele
vised All-Star Game will be
played Feb. 1 at the Coliseum in
Richfield, Ohio.
Of the starters, Theus is the
only player with no previous All-
Star Game experience. Three
other players — Roundfield,
Gilmore and Davis — will be
starting for the first time.
John MacLeod, whose Phoe
nix team has the best record in
the West, already has clinched
the coaching job for that con
ference. The East's coach will
be either Billy Cunningham of
Philadelphia or Bill Fitch of
Boston — depending on which
team has the best record after
Sunday's games.
