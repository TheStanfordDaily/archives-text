# Rock and roll footnotes
## Anthology without conscience BOOKS 
### Ron Lillejord 
The Rolling Stone Illustrated
History of Rock and Boll .
Edited by Jim Miller
Random House/Rolling
Stone Press
474 pp. $10.95

Despite its title, this <'his-
tory" never really tries, in any
real sense, to be definitive.
Rather, the book is a mildly di
verting (sometimes more than
that) sampling of 83 essays
about rock and rock figures by
some of America's best-known
critics.
This revised and updated ver
sion (the book was first pub
lished four years ago) begins
with the black gospel and
rhythm and blues of the '30s, en

ding with several new chapters
which include coverage of punk
music, disco and so-called "new
wave."
Like many anthologies of this
sort, the book has no particular
critical style; some of the
articles are chronological nar
ratives ; others are merely list
ings of major trends in a partic
ular rock subgenre. The riskier
pieces attempt 3 compact
critical analysis of an artist's
work.
\ \
The more successful articles
come from the latter group.
Dave Marsh's inspired, highly
emotional coverage of Eric
Clapton's career makes a per
suasive and ultimately moving
case for Clapton's status as per
haps the greatest white
bluesman ever.
*
Greil Marcus contributed six
articles to the book; taken by
themselves they almost make
the book worth buying. Marcus
can get you to feel the musicand
think about it; at its best, his is
visceral, intelligent criticism of
the highest order. You may
often disagree with Marcus, but
his reviews stay in your head. In
particular, his pieces on The
Beatles. Van Morrison and the
punk movement in the U.K. hint
at the insight this book could
have provided throughout.
But much of the writing here

is the kind of empty-headed
soulless junk that pervades
Rolling Stone magazine of late;
for example, the twin pieces by
John Rockwell, "The Sound of
Hollywood"' and"The Sound of
Manhattan," rightly belong on
the pages of Billboard — they
celebrate a performer's chart
success and not much else.
There are other difficulties;
length constraints severely
hamper Marsh's broadside at
tack on Neil Young and Langdon
Winner's condescending treat
ment of Bruce Springsteen.
Both writers desperately need
to give some evidence to back
their often wild assertions. Win
ner's piece manages to-tell us
very little about Springsteen
even as it's accusing him of
' trying too hard" (What does
this mean? Would Winner be
happier U Springsteen were
lazy?). W
While the book makes a very
honest ( attempt to be com
prehensive, there is one startl
ing omission; theN fc no
chapter on the impact of the me
dia. and specifically, rock
criticism, on rock music and the
public's perception of it. One
significant reason why there
may nevet be an Elvis or Beatle
phenomenon again is the ob
sessive role the media plays in
tearing down people of talent,
creating an air of cynicism that
is almost a given when discuss
ing the state of rock today.

That there is no coverage of
the woeful state of rock
criticism today in a major book
about rock is symptomatic of a
larger malaise in the rock me
dia ; today, most rock critics are
complacent, and the result is
stultifying writing about an in
creasingly deadened subject.
Even though many of the
changes that have taken place in
rock music over the years are
welcome and necessary, one
still longs for a time when there
was real excitement in the air,
when it mattered that John Len
nonwas singing "Money (That's
What I Want),'' when people
danced for all they were worth
as Little Richard wailed 'Long
Tall Sally." when Elvis sneered
at people and they would say,
'•Just look at that face!"
This book often captures that
ecstasy, yet, sadly, many of its
contributors don't seem to be in
touch with theTock 'n' roll spir
it, and that's crippling.

can get you to feel the musicand
think about it; at its best, his is
visceral, intelligent criticism of
the highest order. You may
often disagree with Marcus, but
his reviews stay in your head. In

Beatles. Van Morrison and the
punk movement in the U.K. hint
at the insight this book could
have provided throughout.
But much of the writing here

is the kind of empty-headed
soulless junk that pervades
Rolling Stone magazine of late;
for example, the twin pieces by
John Rockwell, "The Sound of
Hollywood"' and"The Sound of
Manhattan," rightly belong on
the pages of Billboard — they
celebrate a performer's chart
success and not much else.

Winner's condescending treat

Both writers desperately need

very little about Springsteen
even as it's accusing him of
' trying too hard" (What does
this mean? Would Winner be

lazy?). W

That there is no coverage of

criticism today in a major book
about rock is symptomatic of a

Even though many of the
changes that have taken place in
rock music over the years are
welcome and necessary, one
still longs for a time when there

What I Want),'' when people
danced for all they were worth
as Little Richard wailed 'Long
Tall Sally." when Elvis sneered
at people and they would say,
'•Just look at that face!"
This book often captures that
ecstasy, yet, sadly, many of its
contributors don't seem to be in
touch with theTock 'n' roll spir
it, and that's crippling.

The Rolling Stone Illustrated
History of Rock and Boll .
Edited by Jim Miller
Random House/Rolling
Stone Press
474 pp. $10.95

Despite its title, this <'his-
tory" never really tries, in any
real sense, to be definitive.
Rather, the book is a mildly di
verting (sometimes more than
that) sampling of 83 essays
about rock and rock figures by
some of America's best-known
critics.
This revised and updated ver
sion (the book was first pub
lished four years ago) begins
with the black gospel and
rhythm and blues of the '30s, en

ding with several new chapters
which include coverage of punk
music, disco and so-called "new
wave."
Like many anthologies of this
sort, the book has no particular
critical style; some of the
articles are chronological nar
ratives ; others are merely list
ings of major trends in a partic
ular rock subgenre. The riskier
pieces attempt 3 compact
critical analysis of an artist's
work.
\ \
The more successful articles
come from the latter group.
Dave Marsh's inspired, highly
emotional coverage of Eric
Clapton's career makes a per
suasive and ultimately moving
case for Clapton's status as per
haps the greatest white
bluesman ever.

Greil Marcus contributed six
articles to the book; taken by
themselves they almost make
the book worth buying. Marcus
can get you to feel the musicand
think about it; at its best, his is
visceral, intelligent criticism of
the highest order. You may
often disagree with Marcus, but
his reviews stay in your head. In
particular, his pieces on The
Beatles. Van Morrison and the
punk movement in the U.K. hint
at the insight this book could
