# Progress made on guest profs
## 
### Adam Goodman 
John Anderson will teach at Stan
ford next spring if the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board can come up with
additional funds and a place for An
derson to live, several board members
have confirmed.
In addition, the board has offered
guest positions to David Brower,
chairman of the board of the environ
mental organization Friends of the
Earth, and Andre Burnett, student
liaison officer of the U.S. Department
of Education.
Anderson has accepted the Stanford
offer tentatively and is now preparing
a course outline with the aid of Profs.
' >avid Abernethy and David Danelski
ol the Political Science department,
said Steve Richardson, freshman
member of the board and Anderson's
contact.
Danelski will be Anderson's sponsor
if he takes the position. Brower's
sponsor is Joel Horn, 2nd-year student
in the Graduate School of Business,
and Burnett's sponsor is Art Pacheco,
Assoc. Dean of the School of Educa
tion.
Big problem: funding
At this point. Richardson said, "the
biggest problem is on our end, getting
money and housing for Anderson. We
need funding more than anything."
At the same time, the board has
next fall to plan. George McGovern,
forner Democratic senator from
South Dakota, has shown interest in
holding a guest professorship fall
quarter, the board said.
McGovern surprised the board by
calling the ASSU Jan. 14 to say that he
would be interested in a guest pro
fessorship position. He will be
teaching at Northwestern University
near Chicago this spring.
However, though the board is ex
cited about McGovern's offer, its first
concern is finalizing plans with An
derson.
Fee assessments
The board's current fund consists of
the remnants of fee assessments in
1978-79 and 1979-80 Last year the
board only used $2400, to hire Mala
quias Montoya, a Chicano artist. This
year no fee assessment for the board
was levied and no assessment will be
allowed next year unless the board
shows evidence of successful work,
according to Dick Butterfield, COP
member.
Currently the board has about $8000
to spend, according to Luke Cole, a

freshman member. However it was
hoped that money would cover the
costs of hiring three guest professors
— and Anderson alone will probable
require about $10,000 to take a position
at the University, said Cole.
Richardson said the board ten
tatively allotted funds for the three
spring-quarter guest professors at a
Jan. 14 meeting. He said the board
hoped Anderson would receive $4000 to
$5000 from ASSU and additional funds
from outside sources. Burnett and
Brower would each receive $3000 from
ASSU. with Brower also getting addi
tional matching funds from business
sources.
"I think all three are strong possi
bilities, bat based ou the amount ui
money we have now we will have to do
much fundraising to make it
feasible," Cole said.
Seeking assistance
The board has sought funds from
University departments, outside
sources, and speakers bureaus to help
out. So far only two departments have

responded favorably with offers of
money — the International Relations
and History departments. Many de
partments said they wished to donate
but had no extra money to give, while
others have not given a definite an
swer. Richardson said.
"The Political Science department
has not been as helpful as I would
like," Richardson said. He stated that
he was disappointed in the department
for not offering money since An
derson's course would probably be ac
credited by that department, but he
also praised the efforts of Abernethy
and Danelski
Abernethy. who currently chairs
the Political Science department's
Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies, has proposed four topics which
Anderson might consider teaching if
he comes to Stanford in the spring, ac
cording to Cole.
The course suggestions are: de
cision-making in Congress; Congress,
the presidency and the economy;
domestic policy and American foreign
policy; and the three-party system in
America.
One outside source that may come
through is the Dickinson Symposium
Fund, which has said it will give An
derson $2000 if he will participate in
four evening symposia
Students may help
If none of the outside fund sources
come through, the board may ask for
student donations, Riqhardson said."
In addition to funding problems, the
board also faces the problem of find
ing a place for Anderson to live. An
derson will not be a resident fellow in
Tovon or in any other University resi
dence, as had been earlier suggested,
Richardson said.
"We are looking for a faculty mem
ber who lives on or near the campus

and who will be gone on leave in the
spring." Richardson stated "We had
one offer but we think it is too far
away."
The board hopes to have all details
worked out and to have made its final
offers within three weeks, with a
deadline of Feb. 14.
"This is the first year that the board
has had a lot of people saying that they
would come." Richardson com
mented. "We have to please a wide
range of people. "
"The progress that we have made
with Anderson has made the com
munity more aware of his coming and
we have had a lot of feedback and sup
port," Cole said
The board's next meeting will be
Wednesday Jan. 21 at noon in the ASSU
offices. The Anderson sub-committee
meets today.

the presidency and the economy;
domestic policy and American foreign
policy; and the three-party system in
America.
One outside source that may come
through is the Dickinson Symposium
Fund, which has said it will give An
derson $2000 if he will participate in
four evening symposia
Students may help
If none of the outside fund sources
come through, the board may ask for
student donations, Riqhardson said."
In addition to funding problems, the
board also faces the problem of find
ing a place for Anderson to live. An
derson will not be a resident fellow in
Tovon or in any other University resi
dence, as had been earlier suggested,
Richardson said.
"We are looking for a faculty mem
ber who lives on or near the campus

and who will be gone on leave in the
spring." Richardson stated "We had
one offer but we think it is too far
away."
The board hopes to have all details
worked out and to have made its final
offers within three weeks, with a
deadline of Feb. 14.
"This is the first year that the board
has had a lot of people saying that they
would come." Richardson com
mented. "We have to please a wide
range of people. "
"The progress that we have made
with Anderson has made the com
munity more aware of his coming and
we have had a lot of feedback and sup
port," Cole said
The board's next meeting will be
Wednesday Jan. 21 at noon in the ASSU
offices. The Anderson sub-committee
meets today.
John Anderson will teach at Stan
ford next spring if the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board can come up with
additional funds and a place for An
derson to live, several board members
have confirmed.
In addition, the board has offered
guest positions to David Brower,
chairman of the board of the environ
mental organization Friends of the
Earth, and Andre Burnett, student
liaison officer of the U.S. Department
of Education.
Anderson has accepted the Stanford
offer tentatively and is now preparing
a course outline with the aid of Profs.
' >avid Abernethy and David Danelski
ol the Political Science department,
said Steve Richardson, freshman
member of the board and Anderson's
contact.
Danelski will be Anderson's sponsor
if he takes the position. Brower's
sponsor is Joel Horn, 2nd-year student
in the Graduate School of Business,
and Burnett's sponsor is Art Pacheco,
Assoc. Dean of the School of Educa
tion.
Big problem: funding
At this point. Richardson said, "the
biggest problem is on our end, getting
money and housing for Anderson. We
need funding more than anything."
At the same time, the board has
next fall to plan. George McGovern,
forner Democratic senator from
South Dakota, has shown interest in
holding a guest professorship fall
quarter, the board said.
McGovern surprised the board by
calling the ASSU Jan. 14 to say that he
would be interested in a guest pro
fessorship position. He will be
teaching at Northwestern University
near Chicago this spring.
However, though the board is ex
cited about McGovern's offer, its first
concern is finalizing plans with An
derson.
Fee assessments
The board's current fund consists of
the remnants of fee assessments in
1978-79 and 1979-80 Last year the
board only used $2400, to hire Mala
quias Montoya, a Chicano artist. This
year no fee assessment for the board
was levied and no assessment will be
allowed next year unless the board
shows evidence of successful work,
according to Dick Butterfield, COP
member.
Currently the board has about $8000
to spend, according to Luke Cole, a

freshman member. However it was
hoped that money would cover the
costs of hiring three guest professors
— and Anderson alone will probable
require about $10,000 to take a position
at the University, said Cole.
Richardson said the board ten
tatively allotted funds for the three
spring-quarter guest professors at a
Jan. 14 meeting. He said the board
hoped Anderson would receive $4000 to
$5000 from ASSU and additional funds
from outside sources. Burnett and
Brower would each receive $3000 from
ASSU. with Brower also getting addi
tional matching funds from business
sources.
"I think all three are strong possi
bilities, bat based ou the amount ui
money we have now we will have to do
much fundraising to make it
feasible," Cole said.
Seeking assistance
The board has sought funds from
University departments, outside
sources, and speakers bureaus to help
out. So far only two departments have

responded favorably with offers of
money — the International Relations
and History departments. Many de
partments said they wished to donate
but had no extra money to give, while
others have not given a definite an
swer. Richardson said.
"The Political Science department
has not been as helpful as I would
like," Richardson said. He stated that
he was disappointed in the department
for not offering money since An
derson's course would probably be ac
credited by that department, but he
also praised the efforts of Abernethy
and Danelski
Abernethy. who currently chairs
the Political Science department's
Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies, has proposed four topics which
Anderson might consider teaching if
he comes to Stanford in the spring, ac
cording to Cole.
The course suggestions are: de
cision-making in Congress; Congress,
the presidency and the economy;
domestic policy and American foreign
policy; and the three-party system in
America.
