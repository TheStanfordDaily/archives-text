# Supreme Court soapbox

### Ivan Maisel 
Autobiographies are the
strangest of literary animals.
When a famous personality pens
his or her life story, the book is
often devoured by the public, no
matter what the quality, simply
because the writer is who he or
she is. The American public has
an insatiable urge to find out
what the person really thinks.
However, autobiographies
are, by their very nature, self
serving. Rare is the author who
will tell the objective truth
about his life. After all, it is his
book. Let the scholarly bio
graphers do the real life story;
the man who writes his own bio
graphy can use it for any
purpose he wishes.
Knowing this full well I none
theless jumped at the chance to
read The Court Years: The Au
tobiography of William 0.
Douglas. The Supreme Court is
the last of the great American
institutions cloaked in secrecy;
yet with the publishing of The
Brethren two years ago, the
reading public got its first look
at the inside of the High Court.
My excitement increased be
cause an associate justice, one
of the nine people who really
know what happens behind
those closed doors, had written
the story of his court years. The
time had finally come when we
would get a true insight of the
workings of the last bastion of
government.
And when that author is
Douglas, who was for 36 years
the most consistently con
troversial of Supreme Court
Justices, well, at last we would
get the unbarred story of the
arguments and the relationships
among the men who hammered
the nation's highest law.
The Court Years stands as a

must-read for those who study
the Supreme Court for the very
reason that it is Douglas' own
story. However, Douglas, who
died last year at the age of 81,
reveals little of the Court's in
ner workings. He took the pages
of his life story to tell a text
book-sort of judicial history
before devoting the second half
of the book to what he thought of
practically everything and eve
rybody.
This is Douglas' 31st book, ob
viously, he knew the power of
the printed word, if only be
cause he wrote on such diverse
topics as the Himalayas, the
Southwest and world peace. He
used the books to spout sundry
ideas and feelings, and did so in
his last written work, too.
If you want to know what
Douglas thought about Felix
Frankfurter ("he had deep in
side him a feeling of inade
quacy") or Earl Warren ("one
of the three greatest Chief Jus
tices"), you will find out. If you
want to know what he thought of
Watergate ("obscene to me,
and very offensive") or the
press (he defended it staunchly,
but thought it "depraved"), you
will find that out, too.
But nowhere in The Court
Years does one find a real bio
graphy of William 0. Douglas.
He did not examine himself in
the same way he examined the
crucial cases which came to the
bench in his almost four decades
on the Court. Douglas used The
Court Years as a soapbox, not as
a window on the life of an as
sociate justice.
Not often enough did Douglas
tell the way the great decisions
are crafted. On most judicial
subjects he gave a brief run
down on the history of the prob
lem, why the Court did or did not

take a certain stand and left it at
that But any number of his
tories or commentaries on the
Court have done that, and done a
better job.
It is lamentable that Douglas
did not offer a clearer look at the
things to which no one outside
the brethren have access. How
are decisions made? What kind
of compromises are made at the
highest level of the law? How
big of an influence do the per
sonalities of the Justices have in
how our laws are made? For the
most part, Douglas left these
quirks of the Court behind him,
behind the velvet curtains of the
courtroom.
In the cases where he did
delve into the mechanics of the
decision, it is riveting. The best
chapter on judicial matters is
the one concerning civil rights.
We learn how the smoke-filled
room political skills of Warren
melds the nine justices into be
coming a unanimous voice in
striking down segregation in
Brown v. Board of Education;
and how Douglas blamed Eisen
hower's intransigence for the
turtle's pace of integration.
The chapter concerning the
six presidents with which
Douglas served is also interest
ing. as is the chapter about his
law clerks, because this is fresh,
never-before-covered material.
Where Douglas stuck with this
format, the book is successful.
However, too often, the Jus
tice played it safe and rattled off
a history of what happened. I
read this book with high expec
tations of a behind-the-scenes
look by one of the most out
spoken justices in the Court's
history. Unfortunately, Douglas
did not let us know how it really
is. What is here is good, but what
he could have done!
