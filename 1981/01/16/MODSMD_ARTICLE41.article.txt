Apocalypse Now ****
Fox, Redwood City
An amazing work of mad genius
that succeeds powerfully. Pro
ducer-director Francis Coppola
exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by the
superb cinematography of Vittorio
Storaro, Coppolo creats stunning
images of Vietnam that combine
frightening energy and intensity
with humor, sensuality, and a vi
sion of overwhelming evil. Cop
pola structures a journey into an
almost literal hell that will en
gross — horribly fascinate —
some, and turn away others.
Apocalypse Now is, I think, the
best American movie of the '70s. It
has almost untenable ambitions,
but the profound questions it con
fronts you with justify the seeming
craziness of this "impossible,"
almost nihilistic vision of man
kind.
Plays tonight and tomerow
night. (Apocalypse Now : %arts
i next Thursday at the New Varsi
; ty, Palo Alto.)

! Topper ★★★★
j Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
A supernaturally wonderful
; screwball comedy. Roland Young
: (who played Uncle Willy in The
■ Philadelphia Story) plays a re
: pressed businessman who is
taught how to live life fully by the
, ghosts of two madcap socialites.
: The ghosts are played by Cary
j Grant and Constance Bennett; for
; dead folks, they have a lively touch
: with a good joke. This stylish view
j of the afterlife, with its cocktail
; sipping spirits, almost convinces
; you that death is simply the top
: rung on the social ladder. Hal
1 Roach directed.
Plays with another tongue-in
; cheek spook story, Rene Clair's
The Ghost Goes West.
— Jim Mattson
Raffing Bull ★
( Fine Arts, Palo Alto
; Raging Bull is a great piece of
j; moviemaking, and it is a pow
j erhouse. But on every level, direc
tor Martin Scorsese throws ob
!; stacles in our path that keep us
>: from becoming involved with the
;! film's characters. Scorsese and
;j star Robert De Niro have done
\\ something very strange: they
•; have created a hero (based on the
■: life of famous middleweight Jake
;• La Motta ) who does not respond on
I; any level to our attempts to locate
him or) the human scale: he is im
;! penetrable. Raging Bull is all
:• about passion, yet in some ul
j; timate and important way the pas
j: sion never reaches us, even when
Jake's blood spatters the spec
j; tators at the last fight. As much as
j I admire this film's technique, I
;! have to confess I don't like it very
much.
•; — Steve Vineberg
•; 2001: A Space Odytiey ★★★★
Old Mill, Mountain View
I; An evolutionary primer, or:
:• How I Learned to Stop Worrying
;j; and Love Cosmic Mutation.
>: Stanley Kubrick's rewrite of the
y Book of Revelation finds mankind
ready to make a great leap for
;• ward. What we're leaping from is,
•: in Kubrick's vision, particularly
k bleak. His characters are engulfed

in technology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendours of space, they
;feem drained and vacant they've
Carried the work ethic out between
.: |he planets Here, space must turn
1 Seductress — humankind meets its
greater fate only through the kind
»'j|ess of strangers.

Vopeye **
raMenlo, Menlo Park
rag Popeye might be the year's
Snost frustrating movie. Director
|||Robert Altman (M*A *S*H, Nash-
Wgkille) and screenwriter Jules Feif
m£er have created a movie so car
gioonish that it becomes cold-
— in an effort to add a
llfcash of cartoonish surrealism to
film, the human characters
gfjare reduced to automatons; like
|||artoon characters, they don't
bruise when slapped in the face nor
gpjxhibit any particularly likeable
|||uman characteristics.
I Paradoxically, the per
formances are terrific: Robin Wil-
Ppams and, especially, Shelley
||B|>uvall make a matchless Popeye
sgind Olive Oyl. Visually, too, the
gflhovie is fetching: a wonderfully
ramshackle village has been
, hiounted precariously against a
ligliff, and the costumes and
f|j|iakeup couldn't be better. This
Carriage of the good and the not
■ So-good is a little unnerving: the
numbs us even when it is
Pjhost pleasing.

Change of Season» **
$ <)ld Mill 6, Mt. View
Anthony Hopkins and Shirley
liplacLaine star in a disappointing
about an aging professor and
his fling with a student (Bo Derek)
jajlalf his age. MacLaine's per
formance as the professor's wife
pfftas superb, but otherwise the film
only limited entertainment.
3Jphe social comments are impor
||pnt. but far too blatant in their
presentation. Hopkins stumbles
|p|irough the film as if he were to
jfeffeilly confused. And Derek's only
qualities are her good
Sboks. In her role, she is super
ficial, insincere, even boring at
times. Unfortunately, the film is
inuch the same.

to 5 ★★★
lllfld Mill, Mountain View
"jgt. The script is slight — an uncer
tain pastiche of Preston Sturges
eltects — but Jane Fonda, Lily
®|omlin and Dolly Parton make an
jjjyiexpectedlv fine comic ensemble
this tale of three secretaries
\iho declare war on their idiot
boss. Fonda's a bit unsure of
hlerself, but she plays against type
iiP 1 S result; Parton is so natural
a[id unabashedly earnest that you
tiile regardless of what she's
ing; and Tomlin shines through
t — her horsey face has soft
ened. giving her a multitude of dif
ferent expressions. Dabney Cole
man, as the tyrannical employer,
has the toughest part of all, but he
has a great time with it, playing
the unfailingly stupid jackass to
the hilt.
— R.L.

The Hlack Stallion ★★★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Carroll Ballard, up until now
known primarily as a promising
protege of Francis Coppola,
directed The Black Stallion as if
the only logic he had ever known
was a cinematic one Incidents in
the film, which, on the strictest
narrative level, are absurd, seem
perfectly reasonable when viewed
on the film's own terms. Ballard
has lived up to his promise with a
work of striking, and strikingly
beautiful, imagery.
A boy and a horse are both ship
wrecked on a desert island; when
the child is rescued, he refuses to
leave without the animal Re
turned to civilization, both must
learn to live in what has become an
alien landscape

The Mirror Crack'd **
Bijou. Palo Alto
A suitable means for simulating
Agatha Christie's suspense-build
ing techniques on-screen has yet to
be found, and The Mirror Crack'd,
the latest Christie-derived pic
ture, never really gets going.
While there are no real per
formances, it is nevertheless only
the actors who are worth watching
— Tony Curtis and Edward Fox
manage to provide moments that
keep one from leaving the theater.
Angela Lansbury, unfortunately,
is reduced to geriatric amorphous
ness as Miss Marple.

Kaffemusha ★★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
At 70, Akira Kurosawa directs
what may be his summit achieve
ment: a samurai epic that sug
gests a fusion of Shakespeare and
Pirandello. A thief is hired as the
shadow' of a samurai chieftain —
to stand in for him when he is in
jured in battle — and when the
leader dies, the thief must take
over. There's a post—battle se
quence that is reminsicent of the
'Guernica.' A masterpiece.

No Nuke*
Old Mill, Palo Alto
Haskell Wexler, who directed
the fascinating mock-documen
tary Medium Cool, photographed
this rock-documentary of the
MUSE (Musicians United for Safe
Energy) benefit which took place
in New York a year ago. He's
chosen to emphasize the per
formers' faces, often to
mesmerizing effect — we've never
been so close to these people
before. Its possible to question the
legitimacy of celebrities cam
paigning about such an issue
i would the movie have been made
any differently if it the benefit had
been in support of nuclear energy
instead of against it?) but it's hard
not to get caught up with their en
thusiasm and concern.
Your opinion of the movie will
inevitably be affected by your
opinion of its people. They include
Bruce Springsteen and the E
Street Band, Jackson Browne, the
Doobie Brothers, and Gil Scott-
Herron. Late show this weekend.

Worth by Northwest +++•*
Wednesday, Tresidder Large
Lounge
This superb Hitchcock thriller
finds the master s tongue even more;
firmly in cheek than usual — the
working title was not IWorth by
Northwest but The Man on Lin
coln s Nose
Cary Grant plays a businessman
forced into flight after he is mis
taken for a spy and a murderer. Eva
Marie Saint, among the best of
Hitchcock's ice-beauties, plays a
woman < whose loyalties are dubious
at best) who finds her life thrown
into the same "alphabet soup'' (the
CIA, the FBI . . )as Grant's.
Everything gels - the per
formances are smooth, scriptwriter
Ernest Lehmann's dialogue is
polished and witty, and Bernard
Herrmann's score is brilliantly
flamboyant.
Plays with an early Hitchcock
film. Murder.
- J.M.
Seems Like Old Time* *
Old Mill, Mountain View
A movie only a schnauzer could
love. Goldie Hawn, Chevie Chase,
and Charles Grodin share the
screen with six dogs in assorted
sizes; the only really funny scene
comes when the dogs turn up their
noses at Hawn's pepperoni
chicken. Neil Simon's script com
bines a ludicrous storyline with
one-dimensional characters:
Hawn has nothing to do but act
frazzled, while Grodin snivels and
Chase mugs. The "old times" that
Simon would like to evoke are the
screwball comedies of the '30s and
'40s, but Seems Like Old Times
only brings to mind the TV sitcoms
of the '70s.
— Mike Hale
Pretty Baby it
New Varsity, Palo Alto
I think that Louis Malle would
rather be a still photographer; you
can tell bv the laborious, languid
way he makes movies. In this film,
Malle seems almost opposed to
movement or even plot momen
tum. He's so caught up in the ritual
posing of prostitutes that he and
cinematographer Sven Nykvist
seem to working a Vogue or Play
boy photo session. The movie is
populated with non-actors: Brooke
Shields and Susan Sarandon head
the list. Keith Carradine (who can
act) plays an on-camera passive
observer; he doesn't add anything,
because that 's the role Malle plays
too.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
night.
- R.L.
The Ja%% Singer
Old Mill, Mountain View
Neil Diamond plays a man who
must face the choice of being a
cantor or being a bubblegumrock
star who gets to sing neat songs
like "Love On the Rocks." His
father, who is simultaneously a
cantor and Laurence Olivier, is up
set by all this, and also by
Diamond's choice of friends — a
woman who is simultaneously a
shiksa and Lucie Arnaz. At the
end. Diamond, Olivier, Arnaz, and
three-hundred throbbing violins
patch everything up and all's well
on earth. Now you don't have to
see the movie — aren't you glad?
