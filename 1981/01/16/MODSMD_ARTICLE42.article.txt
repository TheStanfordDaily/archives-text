Committee votes Haig approval
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee voted 15-2 yesterday to recommend Sen
ate confirmation of Alexander Haig to be secretary
of state, despite questions raised by some senators
about his role in the Watergate scandal.
Haig, one of the more controversial of President
elect Ronald Reagan's Cabinet choices, is virtually
certain to be confirmed by the full Senate next
Wednesday, the day after Reagan is inaugurated.
The two committee members who voted against
Haig's nomination were Sens. Paul Sarbanes (D-
Md.> and Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.).
Tsongas praised the former White House chief of
staff and NATO commander for being "capable, in
telligent. tough, pragmatic with a sense of history
and a knack of retaining his options," and predicted
he would "absolutely dominate this adminis
tration."
But Tsongas said he opposed Haig's confirmation
because of the risks involved, "the risks inherent in
having all those enormous skills not properly
focused by a dominant sense of moral purpose. The
risk of expediency, despoiling the otherwise solid
performance."
Carter submits 1982 budget
Washington — President Jimmy Carter yesterday
sent Congress a $739.3 billion budget for 1982 in
which — in contrast to the plans of President-elect
Ronald Reagan — domestic spending would not be
deeply cut and taxes would rise.
The president said he was not recommending
large tax cuts or economy boosting spending in
creases. except in defense and energy, "because
persistent inflationary pressures dictate a re
strained fiscal policy." Instead, Carter proposed
more tax increases than tax cuts for both 1981 and
1982, using the proceeds to help reduce the 1982 defi
cit to $27.5 billion to help combat inflation.
Reagan is expected almost to turn the Carter
budget on its head, slashing both taxes and domestic
outlays.
Under the budget, the federal government would
spend a total of $739.3 billion for the year beginning
Oct. 1. up 11.6 percent from this year's $662.7 billion.
East faces water emergency
New York — Governors of four Eastern states de
clared a water emergency yesterday for 21 million
people in parts of New York. New Jersey, Pennsyl
vania and Delaware as a prolonged drought caused
levels in reservoirs to fall dangerously.
Mayor Edward Koch of New York City said that a
similar proclamation would be issued for the city in
the next few days and he called for extensive volun
tary conservation until formal mandatory plans are
announced.
Meeting in Trenton. N.J.. the governors, who are
all members of the Delaware River Basin com
mission. said that they planned to limit water
withdrawn from the Delaware by New York City
and some municipalities in New Jersey. Rainfall in
the Delaware River basin has been down 30 percent
since May.
New York City and municipalities near it are fac
ing the most serious water shortage in more than a
decade. Little rain during the summer and a
smaller-than-anticipated snowfall has left New

York City's reservoirs at 32 percent of capacity —
the lowest level in 15 years
Transportation workers to strike
Warsaw, Poland — Bus and trolley drivers here
said yesterday they will stage a four-hour work stop
page today to protest government penalties against
their fellow Solidarity union members for refusing
to work last Saturday.
Headed by men more radical than national Soli
darity leader Lech Walesa, who was in Rome for a
meeting with Pope John Paul 11, the Warsaw branch
said that workers who stayed home last Saturday
should not lose a day's pay as ordered bv the govern
ment.
City officials met with Solidarity leaders, but said
they could not overturn a national government de
cision.
Solidarity leaders, including Walesa, have argued
that the historic agreements that ended a series of
strikes last summer and sanctioned independent un
ions also established a five-day, 40-hour workweek.
The government, however, insisted that the dis
tressed economy could afford only the equivalent of
a 424 hour workweek at this time with every other
Saturday off Currently the official workweek is 46
hours, with Sundays off.
Walesa granted papal audience
Rome — Pope John Paul II embraced Lech
Walesa, leader of Poland's new free trade unions,
yesterday in a historic encounter designed to
enlarge international recognition of the beleagured
labor movement.
The pope from Poland indirectly cautioned the So
viet Union against intervention and said that basic
human rights, not politics, were at stake.
He emphasized that the free trade unions were in

harmony with the Polish nation, but extolled the vir
tues of prudence and moderation.
It was the first meeting between the two most cel
ebrated present-day Poles Karol Wojtyla, the first
Polish pope and Walesa, founder of the first free
trade union to be established behind the Iron Cur
tain.
An obviously nervous and almost overwhelmed
Walesa fell to his knees on first meeting the pope,
kissed the papal ring, and only reluctantly finally
came to his feet.
Throughout the audience, every care was ex
ercised to avoid provoking the Soviet Union, which
has been harshly critical of the Solidarity movement
headed by Walesa.
The Vatican included diplomats from the Polish
Embassy in Rome in the open portion of the au
dience, but also invited the world press to witness
the event.
After Walesa and the pope first met. there was a
25-rmnute private audience for the two men. one of
those rare occasions when the pope could relax and
speak his native tongue.
Energy issues spur market climb
New York — The stock market chalked up its sec
ond gain in a row yesterday, helped by a late round of
buying concentrated in energy issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.50
to 969.97 on top of Wednesday's 1.37 advance.

Wednesday, the day after Reagan is inaugurated.
The two committee members who voted against
Haig's nomination were Sens. Paul Sarbanes (D-
Md.> and Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.).
Tsongas praised the former White House chief of
staff and NATO commander for being "capable, in
telligent. tough, pragmatic with a sense of history
and a knack of retaining his options," and predicted
he would "absolutely dominate this adminis
tration."
But Tsongas said he opposed Haig's confirmation
because of the risks involved, "the risks inherent in
having all those enormous skills not properly
focused by a dominant sense of moral purpose. The
risk of expediency, despoiling the otherwise solid
performance."
Carter submits 1982 budget
Washington — President Jimmy Carter yesterday
sent Congress a $739.3 billion budget for 1982 in
which — in contrast to the plans of President-elect
Ronald Reagan — domestic spending would not be
deeply cut and taxes would rise.
The president said he was not recommending
large tax cuts or economy boosting spending in
creases. except in defense and energy, "because
persistent inflationary pressures dictate a re
strained fiscal policy." Instead, Carter proposed
more tax increases than tax cuts for both 1981 and
1982, using the proceeds to help reduce the 1982 defi
cit to $27.5 billion to help combat inflation.
Reagan is expected almost to turn the Carter
budget on its head, slashing both taxes and domestic
outlays.
Under the budget, the federal government would
spend a total of $739.3 billion for the year beginning
Oct. 1. up 11.6 percent from this year's $662.7 billion.
East faces water emergency
New York — Governors of four Eastern states de
clared a water emergency yesterday for 21 million
people in parts of New York. New Jersey, Pennsyl
vania and Delaware as a prolonged drought caused
levels in reservoirs to fall dangerously.
Mayor Edward Koch of New York City said that a
similar proclamation would be issued for the city in
the next few days and he called for extensive volun
tary conservation until formal mandatory plans are
announced.
Meeting in Trenton. N.J.. the governors, who are
all members of the Delaware River Basin com
mission. said that they planned to limit water
withdrawn from the Delaware by New York City
and some municipalities in New Jersey. Rainfall in
the Delaware River basin has been down 30 percent
since May.
New York City and municipalities near it are fac
ing the most serious water shortage in more than a
decade. Little rain during the summer and a
smaller-than-anticipated snowfall has left New

York City's reservoirs at 32 percent of capacity —
the lowest level in 15 years
Transportation workers to strike
Warsaw, Poland — Bus and trolley drivers here
said yesterday they will stage a four-hour work stop
page today to protest government penalties against
their fellow Solidarity union members for refusing
to work last Saturday.
Headed by men more radical than national Soli
darity leader Lech Walesa, who was in Rome for a
meeting with Pope John Paul 11, the Warsaw branch
said that workers who stayed home last Saturday
should not lose a day's pay as ordered bv the govern
ment.
City officials met with Solidarity leaders, but said
they could not overturn a national government de
cision.
Solidarity leaders, including Walesa, have argued
that the historic agreements that ended a series of
strikes last summer and sanctioned independent un
ions also established a five-day, 40-hour workweek.
The government, however, insisted that the dis
tressed economy could afford only the equivalent of
a 424 hour workweek at this time with every other
Saturday off Currently the official workweek is 46
hours, with Sundays off.
Walesa granted papal audience
Rome — Pope John Paul II embraced Lech
Walesa, leader of Poland's new free trade unions,
yesterday in a historic encounter designed to
enlarge international recognition of the beleagured
labor movement.
The pope from Poland indirectly cautioned the So
viet Union against intervention and said that basic
human rights, not politics, were at stake.
He emphasized that the free trade unions were in

harmony with the Polish nation, but extolled the vir
tues of prudence and moderation.
It was the first meeting between the two most cel
ebrated present-day Poles Karol Wojtyla, the first
Polish pope and Walesa, founder of the first free
trade union to be established behind the Iron Cur
tain.
An obviously nervous and almost overwhelmed
Walesa fell to his knees on first meeting the pope,
kissed the papal ring, and only reluctantly finally
came to his feet.
Throughout the audience, every care was ex
ercised to avoid provoking the Soviet Union, which
has been harshly critical of the Solidarity movement
headed by Walesa.
The Vatican included diplomats from the Polish
Embassy in Rome in the open portion of the au
dience, but also invited the world press to witness
the event.
After Walesa and the pope first met. there was a
25-rmnute private audience for the two men. one of
those rare occasions when the pope could relax and
speak his native tongue.
