# Zuckerman to be next Daily editor; will purge OTHER rebels from staff
## 
### 
Seth Zuckerman took control of The
Stanford Daily in an almost silent
coup last evening.
Zuckerman. whose only opponent
was an anoynomous coalition of rebel
Daily staffers known as OTHER (Or
ganization To Halt Existentialist Re
porters), easly swept to victory with a
99 81 percent vote.
The nineteen-year-old junior, shown
here in the battle fatigues he wore
when training with the CIA in
telligence unit that was sent to Chile,
has been an agency informer in Col
umbae House for the last two years.
The valuable training he received in
the Chilean mission was in large part
the deciding factor in giving him such
an edge over his now exiled opponents.
Zuckerman, who has been passing

himself off as an Energy Studies Ma
jor (theme house to be announced next
year), said his membership in Stan
ford Students Against Conscription
was but another cover, and he denied
ever commenting that the draft would
bring us closer to Orwell's perception
of society in 1984.
As a member of the Daily staff for
the past three years, Seth has gained
much experience in the positions of
managing editor, news editor, copy
editor and opinions editor.
He is quoted as saying "I'd like to
turn the Daily into a politically cor
rect organization" and most ob
servers believe an upcoming purge of
the staff may create a refugee prob
lem for other comparable papers such

as the Los Angeles Times and the New
York Times.
Zuckerman has denied rumors that
the Daily offices would be
camouflaged with imported plants
from Colombia, or that its new offices
would be located in the basement of
Hoover Tower, a shrine for which he
has shown much affinity.
Seth will be aided in his quest to im
prove local journalism at Stanford by
Pat Carroll, a junior transfer student
from the College of San Mateo. She
will serve as his managing editor and
will help to cultivate the alfalfa
sprouts for staff lunches. Carroll has
been an opinions editor at the Daily
and served as editor of the San Mateo
College weekly paper.
