# New professors needed for Poli Sci department
## 
### Brian Sprague 
With the upcoming departure next
fall of political science Assoc. Prof.
Nannerl Keohane to Wellesley College
and the probability that her husband.
Political Science department Chair
man Robert Keohane, will exit as well
— in addition to Assoc. Prof. Jay
Casper's recent departure — the Polit
ical Science department is brimming
with searches for new senior and jun
ior faculty members.
These searches may provide the de
partment with five new faculty mem
bers by next fall.
According to Robert Keohane, an
accelerated search is currently being
conducted under the leadership of po
litical science Prof. Robert North to
look for potential senior faculty mem
bers with expertise in international
relations to compensate for Robert
Keohane's departure.
The committee is composed of two
tenured professors — International
Relations Program Chairman and his
tory Prof. Alexander Dallin, and polit
ical science Prof. Robert Packenham
— and one or two graduate students,
said Keohane.
"It is normal practice to have grad
uate students on the committee,"he
added. "It's useful to have their per
spective. since they are fresh in the
field.'
Political theory opening
The vacancy in political theory
created by Nan Keohane's departure
will most likely be filled by a visiting
professor next year, said chairman
Keohane. The position will be ap
pointed by a selection committee con
sisting of two tenured professors,
Charles Drekmeier and David
Danelski, both of the Political Science
department, and a graduate student,
said Keohane.
' 'Of course, if the committee finds a
very distinguished person who is in
terested in moving, the position could
be permanantly filled," he continued
It is hoped the committees will de
termine their selections by the end of
winter quarter, said Keohane.
'Overloaded with searches'
As for the position vacated by Prof.
Casper, "the department has decided
to hold off on that." according to polit
ical science Prof. Alexander George,
who said the department is "over

loaded with searches" at the time
being.
"Three other searches are now un
derway." said George, chairman of
these additional search committees.
These searches, which started last
July, are looking for junior persons
(non-tenured) in the fields of interna
tional relations, public administration
and public policy, and comparative
politics of Western Europe, said
George.
The preliminary searches have al
ready been completed and an offer of
the international relations position
has already been made to one person,
said George
The target date for filling all three
positions is the end of January, he con
tinued. "But you can't snap your fin
gers and get a good person." he em
phasized.
Department remains strong
Despite the drastic transformations
occuring throughout the department,
Associate Dean of Humanities and
Sciences James Rosse declared Stan
ford's reputation of excellence in the
field is not in jeopardy.
"It's no question that Bob and Nan
(the Keohanes) leaving will hurt the
department," he said. "But we arenot
in a state of crisis.
"You have to live with the fact that
the best will go," Rosse continued.
"They're mobile."
President Donald Kennedy has ex
pressed the same belief, saying. "We
would never want to attend a Univer
sity where no one was hired away."
Rosse explained that such de
partures are common to all quality in
stitutions and therefore will most like
ly not deter graduate students from
applying to Stanford programs.
Although it's possible that five new
professors will teach here next year,
none of them will be hired to specialize
in Middle Eastern or Southeast Asian
politics, areas which have been said to
be lacking here.
"That's one of the problems with
Stanford," said George. "It was de
cided many years ago that we would
achieve excellence in Latin American
studies and East Asian politics and not
the Middle East.
"The theory was that individuals
could attend UC-Berkeley for those
topics." he said.
With the upcoming departure next

in a state of crisis.
"You have to live with the fact that
the best will go," Rosse continued.
"They're mobile."
President Donald Kennedy has ex
pressed the same belief, saying. "We
would never want to attend a Univer
sity where no one was hired away."
Rosse explained that such de
partures are common to all quality in
stitutions and therefore will most like
ly not deter graduate students from
applying to Stanford programs.
Although it's possible that five new
professors will teach here next year,
none of them will be hired to specialize
in Middle Eastern or Southeast Asian
politics, areas which have been said to
be lacking here.
"That's one of the problems with
Stanford," said George. "It was de
cided many years ago that we would
achieve excellence in Latin American
studies and East Asian politics and not
the Middle East.
"The theory was that individuals
could attend UC-Berkeley for those
topics." he said.
With the upcoming departure next
fall of political science Assoc. Prof.
Nannerl Keohane to Wellesley College
and the probability that her husband.
Political Science department Chair
man Robert Keohane, will exit as well
— in addition to Assoc. Prof. Jay
Casper's recent departure — the Polit
ical Science department is brimming
with searches for new senior and jun
ior faculty members.
These searches may provide the de
partment with five new faculty mem
bers by next fall.
According to Robert Keohane, an
accelerated search is currently being
conducted under the leadership of po
litical science Prof. Robert North to
look for potential senior faculty mem
bers with expertise in international
relations to compensate for Robert
Keohane's departure.
The committee is composed of two
tenured professors — International
Relations Program Chairman and his
tory Prof. Alexander Dallin, and polit
ical science Prof. Robert Packenham
— and one or two graduate students,
said Keohane.
"It is normal practice to have grad
uate students on the committee,"he
added. "It's useful to have their per
spective. since they are fresh in the
field.'
Political theory opening
The vacancy in political theory
created by Nan Keohane's departure
will most likely be filled by a visiting
professor next year, said chairman
Keohane. The position will be ap
pointed by a selection committee con
sisting of two tenured professors,
Charles Drekmeier and David
Danelski, both of the Political Science
department, and a graduate student,
said Keohane.
' 'Of course, if the committee finds a
very distinguished person who is in
terested in moving, the position could
be permanantly filled," he continued
It is hoped the committees will de
termine their selections by the end of
winter quarter, said Keohane.
'Overloaded with searches'
As for the position vacated by Prof.
Casper, "the department has decided
to hold off on that." according to polit
ical science Prof. Alexander George,
who said the department is "over

loaded with searches" at the time
being.
"Three other searches are now un
derway." said George, chairman of
these additional search committees.
These searches, which started last
July, are looking for junior persons
(non-tenured) in the fields of interna
tional relations, public administration
and public policy, and comparative
politics of Western Europe, said
George.
The preliminary searches have al
ready been completed and an offer of
the international relations position
has already been made to one person,
said George
The target date for filling all three
positions is the end of January, he con
tinued. "But you can't snap your fin
gers and get a good person." he em
phasized.
Department remains strong
Despite the drastic transformations
occuring throughout the department,
Associate Dean of Humanities and
Sciences James Rosse declared Stan
ford's reputation of excellence in the
field is not in jeopardy.
"It's no question that Bob and Nan
(the Keohanes) leaving will hurt the
department," he said. "But we arenot
in a state of crisis.
"You have to live with the fact that
the best will go," Rosse continued.
"They're mobile."
President Donald Kennedy has ex
pressed the same belief, saying. "We
would never want to attend a Univer
