# U.N. position softening
## Russia to negotiate on Afghanistan 
### Los Angeles Times 
New Delhi, India — The Sovi
et Union appears to have soft
ened its stance on key issues of
the Afghan crisis in an effort to
stimulate movement toward a
political settlement.
Recent statements by leaders
of the Soviet-installed regime in
Kabul indicate that the Rus
sians have dropped their in
sistence that Pakistan and Iran
negotiate directly with Afghan
leaders to resolve the crisis and
have accepted in principle U.N.
involvement in talks.
The Russians had wanted
direct contact in hopes of gain
ing badly needed international
acceptability and formal
diplomatic recognition for the
regime of President Babrak
Karmal.
Neither Pakistan nor Iran
recognizes the Karmal govern
ment, arguing that it was in
stalled by a foreign power.
Although less clear, there
have also been hints that the So
viets may no longer be insisting
on diplomatic recognition of the
Karmal regime as a precondi
tion to negotiations.
The talks would explore ways
of closing off Afghan guerrilla
sanctuaries in Iran and Paki
stan in return for the
withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan.
Western intelligence sources
estimate that there are present
ly 85,000 to 90.000 Russian troops
in the landlocked central Asian
country.
Growing confidence
The apparent Soviet con
cessions come amid reports of a
growing confidence within the
Karmal regime.
Recent accounts from Af
ghanistan also note a lull in
fighting, especially in the areas
around Kabul, during recent
weeks. However, those familiar
with the guerrilla campaign
claim the lull could be due more
to the harsh Afghan winter than

success of Soviet and Afghan
army forces.
The apparent Soviet desire to
break the diplomatic impasse
coincides with statements by
Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Agha Shahi indicating that his
country also feels an increased
urgency in resolving the crisis.
An estimated 1.4 million Af
ghan refugees who have fled the
fighting now live in Pakistan,
adding further strain to the
country's already uneasy politi
cal climate.
The first clear indication of
change in the Soviet position
came earlier this month when
Ratabzad delivered a letter
from Karmal to Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi of India outlining
his willingness to accept a U.N.
presence in talks.
UN Presence acceptable
A few days later Ratabzad re
peated publicly the regime's
preparedness to accept a U.N.
presence in an interview with
the Communist Party of India
publication Patriot.
Meanwhile, a Jan. 6 wire
agency report from Islamabad
claimed that Soviet Am
bassador Vitaly Smirnov had in
formed Pakistan Foreign Secre
tary Shah Nawaz that formal
recognition of the Karmal re
gime need not necessarily pre
cede talks.
Well-placed Indian govern
ment sources stated Afghan of
ficials privately conveyed a
similar impression at the U.N.
General Assembly session last
summer. However, hopes for in
formal discussions fell through.
Subsequent Soviet and Af
ghan government statements
have tended to confuse rather
than clarify the position on rec
ognition. but political analysts
believe this may be deliberate.
"It's only when these things
remain fuzzy that there is a
chance for different interpreta
tions and progress," an Indian
government official said.

"Neither Kabul nor the Soviets
will openly admit they've
dropped the recognition de
mand."
Pakistan softening
Pakistan may also have soft
ened its position on the ground
rules for talks, political
analysts believe.
Both Pakistan and Iran have
consistently stated they would
meet with senior Afghan lead
ers. but only as representatives
of their party, not the govern
ment.
These tentative signs are in
terpreted as indicators that both
the Soviets and Pakistanis be
lieve that they stand to lose if
the crisis continues. The armed
intervention has seriously
eroded the Soviet image
throughout the Third World, es
pecially in Moslem countries.
Timing of the Russian con
cession on the eve of both the Is
lamic conference in Saudi Ara
bia later this month and the
meeting of foreign ministers
from the non-aligned nations in
Delhi Feb. 9 to 12, is also de
signed to blunt anti-Russian
sentiments at key international
forums, diplomats here believe.
Pakistan, disillusioned that
neither the West nor its Islamic
brethren have offered material
assistance to counter the in
creased Soviet threat, and frus
trated by the failure of its pre
vious diplomatic initiatives, is
also anxious for a settlement.
The apparent softening of the
Soviet diplomatic stance coin
cides with mounting Soviet ef
forts to broaden the Karmal re
gime's narrow political base to
win badly needed legitimacy in
side Afghanistan.
Assembly proposed
For the first time, Afghan
leaders spoke earier this month
of selecting delegates to a con
stituent assembly to endorse a
slightly broader version of the
present Karmal regime known
as the National Fatherland

Front.
Once given a vote of con
fidence by the assembly,
Karmal's regime can argue its
rule has been endorsed by an Af
ghan assembly.
Despite the signals which in
dicate an increased willingness
to resolve the crisis, few ob
servers expect either im
mediate talks or quick results.
The continued inability of
Karmal to win acceptance for
his regime inside Afghanistan
and the inability of Pakistan and
Iran to control movement of in
surgents through their porous
borders with Afghanistan even
if they desired, are both central
to any lasting settlement and
eventual departure of Soviet
troops.

Delhi Feb. 9 to 12, is also de
signed to blunt anti-Russian
sentiments at key international
forums, diplomats here believe.
Pakistan, disillusioned that
neither the West nor its Islamic
brethren have offered material
assistance to counter the in
creased Soviet threat, and frus
trated by the failure of its pre
vious diplomatic initiatives, is
also anxious for a settlement.
The apparent softening of the
Soviet diplomatic stance coin
cides with mounting Soviet ef
forts to broaden the Karmal re
gime's narrow political base to
win badly needed legitimacy in
side Afghanistan.
Assembly proposed
For the first time, Afghan
leaders spoke earier this month
of selecting delegates to a con
stituent assembly to endorse a
slightly broader version of the
present Karmal regime known
as the National Fatherland

Front.
Once given a vote of con
fidence by the assembly,
Karmal's regime can argue its
rule has been endorsed by an Af
ghan assembly.
Despite the signals which in
dicate an increased willingness
to resolve the crisis, few ob
servers expect either im
mediate talks or quick results.
The continued inability of
Karmal to win acceptance for
his regime inside Afghanistan
and the inability of Pakistan and
Iran to control movement of in
surgents through their porous
borders with Afghanistan even
if they desired, are both central
to any lasting settlement and
eventual departure of Soviet
troops.
New Delhi, India — The Sovi
et Union appears to have soft
ened its stance on key issues of
the Afghan crisis in an effort to
stimulate movement toward a
political settlement.
Recent statements by leaders
of the Soviet-installed regime in
Kabul indicate that the Rus
sians have dropped their in
sistence that Pakistan and Iran
negotiate directly with Afghan
leaders to resolve the crisis and
have accepted in principle U.N.
involvement in talks.
The Russians had wanted
direct contact in hopes of gain
ing badly needed international
acceptability and formal
diplomatic recognition for the
regime of President Babrak
Karmal.
Neither Pakistan nor Iran
recognizes the Karmal govern
ment, arguing that it was in
stalled by a foreign power.
Although less clear, there
have also been hints that the So
viets may no longer be insisting
on diplomatic recognition of the
Karmal regime as a precondi
tion to negotiations.
The talks would explore ways
of closing off Afghan guerrilla
sanctuaries in Iran and Paki
stan in return for the
withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan.
Western intelligence sources
estimate that there are present
ly 85,000 to 90.000 Russian troops
in the landlocked central Asian
country.
Growing confidence
The apparent Soviet con
cessions come amid reports of a
growing confidence within the
Karmal regime.
Recent accounts from Af
ghanistan also note a lull in
fighting, especially in the areas
around Kabul, during recent
weeks. However, those familiar
with the guerrilla campaign
claim the lull could be due more
to the harsh Afghan winter than

success of Soviet and Afghan
army forces.
The apparent Soviet desire to
break the diplomatic impasse
coincides with statements by
Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Agha Shahi indicating that his
country also feels an increased
urgency in resolving the crisis.
An estimated 1.4 million Af
ghan refugees who have fled the
fighting now live in Pakistan,
adding further strain to the
country's already uneasy politi
cal climate.
The first clear indication of
change in the Soviet position
came earlier this month when
Ratabzad delivered a letter
from Karmal to Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi of India outlining
his willingness to accept a U.N.
presence in talks.
UN Presence acceptable
A few days later Ratabzad re
peated publicly the regime's
preparedness to accept a U.N.
presence in an interview with
the Communist Party of India
publication Patriot.
Meanwhile, a Jan. 6 wire
agency report from Islamabad
claimed that Soviet Am
bassador Vitaly Smirnov had in
formed Pakistan Foreign Secre
tary Shah Nawaz that formal
recognition of the Karmal re
gime need not necessarily pre
cede talks.
Well-placed Indian govern
ment sources stated Afghan of
ficials privately conveyed a
similar impression at the U.N.
General Assembly session last
summer. However, hopes for in
formal discussions fell through.
Subsequent Soviet and Af
ghan government statements
have tended to confuse rather
than clarify the position on rec
ognition. but political analysts
believe this may be deliberate.
"It's only when these things
remain fuzzy that there is a
chance for different interpreta
tions and progress," an Indian
government official said.

"Neither Kabul nor the Soviets
will openly admit they've
dropped the recognition de
mand."
Pakistan softening
Pakistan may also have soft
ened its position on the ground
rules for talks, political
analysts believe.
Both Pakistan and Iran have
consistently stated they would
meet with senior Afghan lead
ers. but only as representatives
of their party, not the govern
ment.
These tentative signs are in
terpreted as indicators that both
the Soviets and Pakistanis be
lieve that they stand to lose if
the crisis continues. The armed
intervention has seriously
eroded the Soviet image
throughout the Third World, es
pecially in Moslem countries.
Timing of the Russian con
cession on the eve of both the Is
lamic conference in Saudi Ara
bia later this month and the
meeting of foreign ministers
from the non-aligned nations in
Delhi Feb. 9 to 12, is also de
signed to blunt anti-Russian
