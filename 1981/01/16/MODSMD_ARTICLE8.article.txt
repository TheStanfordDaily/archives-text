# Opposition leaders call on U.S. to mediate for peace
## 
### Washington Post 
Mexico City — Five days into a broad offensive,
the leader of El Salvador's political and guerrilla
opposition movements said Wednesday that they
are willing to start direct negotiations with the
United States to seek a political solution to avoid
further bloodshed in that Central American coun
try.
Saying he was speaking for both the left and
center-left political opposition as well as the five
Marxist guerrilla organizations who make up the
Salvadoran opposition, Guillermo Ungo said, "We
are seriously interested in talks with the U.S. to
find a political settlement. We are saying this to
the Carter and the Reagan administrations. If we
wait for a military victory, the extermination of
the people will be so much greater. Hundreds of
women, children and old people are being killed."
Ungo, a Social Democrat leader in El Salvador,
said that the talks should be held directly with the
United States, rather than the current Salvadoran
government, since "the United States has been
demonstrated to be the power behind the
Salvadoran throne. It has contributed to the radi
calization and the polarization of the process. It
therefore has a quota of responsibility.
Questions arising
(At the State Department, Deputy Assistant
Secretary James Cheek responded, "The
evidence that emerged from the offensive, cap
tured documents and weapons raises some seri
ous questions about the ownership of the front Mr.
Ungo represents.")
Ungo replaced Enrique Alvarez as head of the
opposition Democratic Revolutionary Front
(FDR) after Alvarez was killecf along with five
other opposition leaders in El Salvador last No
vember. He and other representatives of the op
position umbrella group said front represent
atives met with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
for Latin America William Bowdler and his depu
ty for Central America, Cheek, last August.
Since then, they said, there had been only in
formal contacts with U.S. diplomats in the region,
although "we showed our willingness to keep rela
tions and communications (open) with the U.S."

Last December, Ungo said, State Department
officials first indicated the United States was will
ing to talk about restructuring the government in
El Salvador But in late December, he said, they
told the front the opposition should negotiate
directly with the Salvadoran government.
Conflicts denied
(A State Department official acknowledged
talks, as distinct from negotiations, with opposi
tion leaders including Ungo as late as August but
he denied any conflicting signals. The State De
partment has always encouraged negotiations
within El Salvador, the official said.)
At a later press conference, spokesmen for both
the guerrillas and the politicians denounced the
renewal of U.S. military aid to El Salvador and
charged that troops from both Honduras and
Guatemala have entered the war on the side of the
Salvadoran military.
The U.S. claim that it is offering the Salvadoran
government "nonlethal" weapons, including heli
copters, is false, they said, because helicopters
were being used to kill the civilian population
While they charged that there already had been
several incursions by the Guatemalan Army in
western El Salvador, where the two countries
share a border, the spokesmen said Honduras has
agreed to send about 3000 troops to help seal its\
border starting yesterday.
Government denies involvement
The military government of Honduras pre
viously has denied any involvement in the
Salvadoran civil war. Spokesmen for Honduras
and Guatemala could not be reached Wednesday
for comment.
The Salvadoran opposition leaders are visiting
Mexico to announce the formation of a seven
member "political-diplomatic" commission,
which has "plenipotentiary power" over the
myriad civilian and guerrilla umbrella organiza
tions making up the leftist coalition.
The commission, its members said Wednesday,
will start preparing a new Salvadoran govern
ment and will launch an international diplomatic
effort to avoid outside military intervention.

The U.S. claim that it is offering the Salvadoran
government "nonlethal" weapons, including heli
copters, is false, they said, because helicopters
were being used to kill the civilian population
While they charged that there already had been
several incursions by the Guatemalan Army in
western El Salvador, where the two countries
share a border, the spokesmen said Honduras has
agreed to send about 3000 troops to help seal its\
border starting yesterday.
Government denies involvement
The military government of Honduras pre
viously has denied any involvement in the
Salvadoran civil war. Spokesmen for Honduras
and Guatemala could not be reached Wednesday
for comment.
The Salvadoran opposition leaders are visiting
Mexico to announce the formation of a seven
member "political-diplomatic" commission,
which has "plenipotentiary power" over the
myriad civilian and guerrilla umbrella organiza
tions making up the leftist coalition.
The commission, its members said Wednesday,
will start preparing a new Salvadoran govern
ment and will launch an international diplomatic
effort to avoid outside military intervention.
