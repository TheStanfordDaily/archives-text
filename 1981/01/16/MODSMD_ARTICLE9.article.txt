# Beijing wary of Reagan China policy
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — When Ronald Reagan was
campaigning for the presidency last
summer with appeals to the old, pro-
Taiwan "China lobby," Beijing was spit
ting mad. His promises to upgrade the
United States' ties with the Chinese Na
tionalists on Taiwan, to sell the more so
phisticated weapons and to put them on
virtually an equal plane with the regime
here, were a breach of everything Beij
ing and Washington had agreed to, China
declared in one harsh press commentary
after another.

News analysis

Were Reagan to win, it seemed, Wash
ington's improved relations with Beijing
would be among the first casualties of
what one writer characterized as "a
right-wing, arch-conservative adminis
tration . . . with neoimperial, neo
colonial delusions."
As Reagan takes office, questions re
main about his attitudes toward China
and Taiwan, but realism appears to have
replaced rhetoric on both sides. Just as
the confrontation threatened to become

a full-blown crisis — and an unwanted
election issue — each side backed away.
Reagan blurred what had been a hard
and-fast position and Beijing said it
would judge him by his actions.
Certainly, the Chinese focus has
moved from a simple, at times near
frantic effort to preserve the rela
tionship it developed with the United
States during the Carter years to the
more complicated task of furthering it
under Reagan. China is less worried that
Reagan will immediately dispatch a full
fledged "ambassador to the Republic of
China" and sell Taiwan the air-superior
ity fighters it wants than it is concerned
that everything the Carter adminis
tration has set in motion, from educa
tional and scientific exchanges to $2
billion in credits and the sale of military
related technology, will be frozen pend
ing a review and the formulation of new
U.S. policies.
"Beyond the basic recognition that
Sino-American relations have global
strategic implications, the Reagan ad
ministration does not appear to have a
China policy," a Chinese specialist in
American affairs commented. "We wel

corned the remarks by Gen. (Alexander)
Haig as the new secretary of state that
U.S. relations with China would not be a
function of Soviet-American relations,
as they had been tor most of the 19705.'*
China appears ready to take the in
itiative, once the Reagan administration
is installed, to maintain a steady de
velopment of relations with the United
States. One idea is for Premier Zhao
Ziyang to return the visits of Presidents
Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford to China,
thus speeding decisions that might be de
layed for months and solidifying China's
position in American strategic planning.
If Reagan would prefer, he can visit Chi
na — he has already been invited.
China, meanwhile, has not ceased its
criticism of the "old" Reagan-Re
publican positions on upgrading U.S. ties
with Taiwan — it has just transferred the
attack to Ray Cline, the former deputy
director of the Central Intelligence
Agency and sometime Reagan adviser,
whose lecturing of Beijing on its interna
tional conduct has made him a target for
blistering attacks that remind the in
coming administration of the risks it
runs with a "two-Chinas" policy.
