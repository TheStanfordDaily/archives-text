# 52 HOSTAGES FREE SOON; ACCORD ENDS ORDEAL
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The United States
and Iran signed an agreement early
today to end the 443-day hostage
crisis, and an anxious America
awaited imminent freedom for the 52
U.S. captives.
Much of the nation was sleeping
when, a few hours before dawn on the
last full day of Jimmy Carter's four
year term as president, the final steps
were taken to wipe away the sense of
impotence that had haunted the nation
for more than 14 months.
As champagne glasses were hoisted
in White House offices — and in the
homes of hostage families across the
land — Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, the chief U.S. ne
gotiator, went to the Algerian Foreign
Minister's office to sign in behalf of
the United States the complex accord
that had been initialed a short time
earlier by Iranian officials in Tehran.
Carter, whose crushing defeat by
Ronald Reagan last fall was widely at
tributed to the hostage crisis, went on
television at 1:30 a.m. to cautiously
announce that the ordeal that had that
taxed America's democratic toler
ance since a band of Iranian radicals
overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
on Nov. 4, 1979, was finally near its
end.
Carter, with fatigue lining his face,
said that the frozen Iranian assets —
billions of dollars in gold and cash —
would be transferred "following the
release of our hostages.
"We don't yet know how exactly
fast this procedure will go," he said.
"We are prepared to move as rapidly
as possible. All the preparations have
been completed pending the final
documents being signed.
"I will have more to say to you when
our American hostages are actually
free." the president said before turn
ing aside questions as he stepped from
the podium.
Even as Reagan, the incoming pres
ident, endorsed the agreement nego
tiated by the outgoing administration,

White House aides were preparing for
a possible early morning departure by
Carter to meet the returning hostages
in West Germany.
But when Carter made his brief
statement — saying, "We have now
reached agreement" — he made no
reference to traveling to Germany.
Aides said that Carter would not
make the trip unless he was certain
that he could be back in the capital by
noon tomorrow — the moment when
presidential power passes to Reagan.
Two Algerian jetliners flew to the
Iranian capital, presumably to pick up
the hostages, as Carter went before
television cameras in the White House
press room. The president had been
napping on a couch in a hideaway of
fice adjacent to his Oval Office when
he was awakened with word that
Christopher had been summoned to
sign the agreement.
All signs pointed toward actual
freedom for the captives sofnetime
during the day today. The final acts of
the long-running drama were played
out with the same high level of tension
and suspense that enveloped so many
previous developments in the long
search for a way to end the hostages'
long ordeal.
"I like it. My God it's over. It's
done," said Dorothea Morefield of San
Diego, the wife of Richard Morefield,
on of the 52 hostages.
With tears in her eyes, Mrs.
Morefield — upon hearing on radio
that the final agreement had been
signed — joked that her first word to
her husband would be, "Next time if
you're going to be late for dinner —
call."
Morefield said, "We've got 14
months behind us. It's done."
In Washington and across the na
tion, yesterday had become a day of
soaring hopes mingled with ap
prehension that something might once
again go wrong.
As the hours ticked by while
diplomats in Algiers worked at the te
dious process of translating complex
settlement documents into three lan
guages — English, French and Per

sian — many Americans went to bed
still wondering whether the long shad
ow had in fact been lifted from the
land.
But it was a hopeful Carter who tele
phoned Reagan to brief him on last
mintue developments in the crisis.
The basic terms of the reported
agreement were simple: the Iranians
would free the hostages as the United
States simultaneously released Ira
nian assets, bank deposits and gold
that were frozen by Carter 10 days af
ter the Americans were seized on Nov.
4, 1979.
But, like the protracted nego
tiations. the final phase was a com
plicated one.
It was understood that the end of the
long stalemate would come in two
stages: First, the acceptance of the
wording of the agreement by Iran and

the United States, and second, im
plementation of the agreement's
terms. This was understood to mean
that the hostages would be freed as
Iran's frozen assets were turned over
to a third party, reportedly the Bank of
Kngland. In his televised statement,
however. Carter said that the assets
would not be turned over until the
hostages had been freed.
It appeared likely that the hostages
would be flown first to Algiers, es
corted by Algerian doctors who went
to Tehran at Iran's request on Satur
day. and then would be taken to
Wiesbaden. West Germany, where
they would remain at a U.S. military
hospital for several days.
Carter returned by helicopter from
Camp David shortly after noon and
went immediately to the Oval Office

for a three-hour meeting with Vice
President Walter Mondale, Secretary
of the Treasury William Miller, At
torney General Benjamin Civiletti,
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
and other officials.
It was another trying weekend for
the families and friends of the
hostages — a group of diplomats.
Marine guards, communications spe
cialists and teachers — who were kid
napped nine months after the Islamic
revolution overthrew Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
In Loup City, Neb., Mrs. Doris
Moeller. mother of hostage Michael
Moeller, burst into tears when a re
porter relayed another report from
Tehran Mrs. Moeller said she was
trying not to get "too keyed up."

"I can't come down anymore," she
said.
Within the White House, the mood
was serious, almost melancholy, and
contrasted with the gaiety of the pre
inaugural parties attended by
thousands of Republicans and others
throughout the rest of the capital this
weekend But for many Carter aides,
the fact that an agreement was at
hand to end the crisis seemed to ease
the still-lingering sting of their defeat
in the November election
During breaks in meetings in the
Oval Office, the Democratic aides
hurried back to their own offices to
sling their own paintings and papers
into packing boxes in order to clear out
before the Republicans move in Tues
day afternoon.

Carter returned by helicopter from
Camp David shortly after noon and
went immediately to the Oval Office

for a three-hour meeting with Vice
President Walter Mondale, Secretary
of the Treasury William Miller, At
torney General Benjamin Civiletti,
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
and other officials.
It was another trying weekend for
the families and friends of the
hostages — a group of diplomats.
Marine guards, communications spe

napped nine months after the Islamic
revolution overthrew Shah

In Loup City, Neb., Mrs. Doris
Moeller. mother of hostage Michael
Moeller, burst into tears when a re
porter relayed another report from
Tehran Mrs. Moeller said she was
trying not to get "too keyed up."

"I can't come down anymore," she
said.
Within the White House, the mood
was serious, almost melancholy, and
contrasted with the gaiety of the pre
inaugural parties attended by
thousands of Republicans and others
throughout the rest of the capital this
weekend But for many Carter aides,
the fact that an agreement was at
hand to end the crisis seemed to ease
the still-lingering sting of their defeat
in the November election
During breaks in meetings in the
Oval Office, the Democratic aides

Washington — The United States
and Iran signed an agreement early
today to end the 443-day hostage
crisis, and an anxious America
awaited imminent freedom for the 52
U.S. captives.
Much of the nation was sleeping
when, a few hours before dawn on the
last full day of Jimmy Carter's four
year term as president, the final steps
were taken to wipe away the sense of
impotence that had haunted the nation
for more than 14 months.
As champagne glasses were hoisted
in White House offices — and in the
homes of hostage families across the
land — Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, the chief U.S. ne
gotiator, went to the Algerian Foreign
Minister's office to sign in behalf of
the United States the complex accord
that had been initialed a short time
earlier by Iranian officials in Tehran.
Carter, whose crushing defeat by
Ronald Reagan last fall was widely at
tributed to the hostage crisis, went on
television at 1:30 a.m. to cautiously
announce that the ordeal that had that
taxed America's democratic toler
ance since a band of Iranian radicals
overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
on Nov. 4, 1979, was finally near its
end.
Carter, with fatigue lining his face,
said that the frozen Iranian assets —
billions of dollars in gold and cash —
would be transferred "following the
release of our hostages.
"We don't yet know how exactly
fast this procedure will go," he said.
"We are prepared to move as rapidly
as possible. All the preparations have
been completed pending the final
documents being signed.
"I will have more to say to you when
our American hostages are actually
free." the president said before turn
ing aside questions as he stepped from
the podium.
Even as Reagan, the incoming pres
ident, endorsed the agreement nego
tiated by the outgoing administration,

White House aides were preparing for
a possible early morning departure by
Carter to meet the returning hostages
in West Germany.
But when Carter made his brief
statement — saying, "We have now
reached agreement" — he made no
reference to traveling to Germany.
Aides said that Carter would not
make the trip unless he was certain
that he could be back in the capital by
noon tomorrow — the moment when
presidential power passes to Reagan.
Two Algerian jetliners flew to the
Iranian capital, presumably to pick up
the hostages, as Carter went before
television cameras in the White House
press room. The president had been
napping on a couch in a hideaway of
fice adjacent to his Oval Office when
he was awakened with word that
Christopher had been summoned to
sign the agreement.
All signs pointed toward actual
freedom for the captives sofnetime
during the day today. The final acts of
the long-running drama were played
out with the same high level of tension
and suspense that enveloped so many
previous developments in the long
search for a way to end the hostages'
long ordeal.
"I like it. My God it's over. It's
done," said Dorothea Morefield of San
Diego, the wife of Richard Morefield,
on of the 52 hostages.
With tears in her eyes, Mrs.
Morefield — upon hearing on radio
that the final agreement had been
signed — joked that her first word to
her husband would be, "Next time if
you're going to be late for dinner —
call."
Morefield said, "We've got 14
months behind us. It's done."
In Washington and across the na
tion, yesterday had become a day of
soaring hopes mingled with ap
prehension that something might once
again go wrong.
As the hours ticked by while
diplomats in Algiers worked at the te
dious process of translating complex
settlement documents into three lan
guages — English, French and Per

sian — many Americans went to bed
still wondering whether the long shad
ow had in fact been lifted from the
land.
But it was a hopeful Carter who tele
phoned Reagan to brief him on last
mintue developments in the crisis.
The basic terms of the reported
agreement were simple: the Iranians
would free the hostages as the United
States simultaneously released Ira
nian assets, bank deposits and gold
that were frozen by Carter 10 days af
ter the Americans were seized on Nov.
4, 1979.
But, like the protracted nego
tiations. the final phase was a com
plicated one.
It was understood that the end of the
long stalemate would come in two
stages: First, the acceptance of the
wording of the agreement by Iran and

the United States, and second, im
plementation of the agreement's
terms. This was understood to mean
that the hostages would be freed as
Iran's frozen assets were turned over
to a third party, reportedly the Bank of
Kngland. In his televised statement,
however. Carter said that the assets
would not be turned over until the
hostages had been freed.
It appeared likely that the hostages
would be flown first to Algiers, es
corted by Algerian doctors who went
to Tehran at Iran's request on Satur
day. and then would be taken to
Wiesbaden. West Germany, where
they would remain at a U.S. military
hospital for several days.
