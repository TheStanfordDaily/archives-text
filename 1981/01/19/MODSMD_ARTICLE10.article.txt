### Washington Post 
Washington — The State Department an
nounced Saturday that it has authorized shipment
of $5 million worth of "lethal" military supplies
and four more Huey transport helicopters to El
Salvador's embattled government.
This response to Salvadoran requests is a
marked escalation of U.S. involvement in the
country's civil war, which a department
statement said was justified by the fact that lef
tist forces battling government troops have been
"covertly supplied with arms, ammunition, train
ing and political and military advice by Cuba and
other communist nations."
U.S. military aid previously was restricted to
so-called "non-lethal" transportation and com
-1 munication equipment, and uniforms. Saturday's
authorization includes grenade launchers and
M-16 rifles in unstated quantities, as well as am
munition to make up for depletions since guer

rillas launched a "final offensive" a week ago.
The State Department said El Salvador had
taken "positive steps" in investigating alleged of
ficial involvement in the murder last month of
four American churchwomen, implementing
U.S.-backed land and economic reforms and im
proving its "ability to deal with repression and
terrorism."
Following the murder of the four American
women, all U.S. aid was suspended pending action
in these areas. An original "non-lethal" military
aid package of $5.7 million in fiscal 1981 was re
sumed Tuesday. H
An additional program authorizing the lease of
"at least two U.S. helicopters and a half dozen mili
tary advisers also was reinstituted at that time.
It was not known if more advisers or U.S. mili
tary technicians would also be sent to El Salvador
along with the additional four helicopters an
nounced Saturday.
