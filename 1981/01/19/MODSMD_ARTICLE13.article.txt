## Language 'defenders' lack soul 
### 
The passing of Martin Luther
King, Jr.'s birthday inspired an
undoubtedly unique reaction in
me that I want to share. It
crystallized and augmented my
negative thinking about the self
appointed new "defenders" of
the English language.
I'm talking here about John
Simon, whose recent book Para
digms Lost has made such a
stir; about Edwin Newman,
with his oh-sharp tongue; about
(to a much lesser extent) Rich
ard Mitchell, "The Under
ground Grammarian," ex
coriating the jargon of
educators and bureaucrats.
These writers and many others
have been pissing and moaning
about the "severe deterioration
afflicting our language," treat
ing English as some kind of deli
cate flower we all have allowed
to' suffer abuse at indelicate
hands.
Well, even more than the next
person probably, I'm against
language abuse, and I especially
respect the force of Orwell's
"Politics and the English Lan
guage" analysis-that habitually
corrupt language-use makes a
corrupt politics all the easier to
spread.
But, unlike Simon and New
man especially, I also re
member Rosa Parks and the
words that in their time pro
voked more good, more better
ment, than any others: "My
feets is weary." I also recall
groups of brave, dignified peo
ple marching the streets of
Selma and Birmingham and
singing "Ain't Gonna Let No
body Turn Me Round." I hear,
more importantly I feel, no lan
guage corruption in these words
at all.
All these "protectors" and

"defenders" of English are
Platonists. They think of lan
guage as being up there, as an
abstract form or code In point
of fact, their preferred English
is no more than the exact way
they and their friends use the
language when they're trying to
impress.
For me, "English" is down
here with Rosa Parks and
Martin Luther King and you and
me and people named Theo
philus and Calvinetta, Elvis,
Jorge, Elena and Tuan, too.
Yes, even with people named
Winthrop and Chauncey and
Muffin, but their contribution to
our generalizations about lan
guage should be no greater than
anyone else's.
From Aristotle on, rhetori
cians have analyzed and eval
uated language-as-used along
three dimensions: the cogency
of the ideas expressed, the or
ganization of the idea, and the
character or persona of the lan
guage user. This last criterion is
surely the key here. For where
Simon and Newman infer vul
garians. peasants, airheads,
and no-accounts from certain
words and constructions, I tend
to infer heartful, soulful work
ing people, the salt of the Earth.
As a middle-class teenager in
the early '60s I perceived
roughly but accurately enough
that there were people above
me socially and below me so
cially and that I was being led to
emulate those above me and to
treat those below me more or
less like scum. People who used
words like "peremptory" and
"admonish" and who never
used a double negative or said
"shit" were to be my models.
But I learned differently. I
learned that, more than just

being unworthy of my emula
tion. Chauncey and Winthrop
and Muffin themselves often
were pretty scummy. Chauncey
would say. "Let's launch a per
emptory A-bomb strike" and
Muffin would tell Felicity over
tea. "Let's admonish those
Jews not to move in our neigh
borhood." All those well-bred
Southern senators used perfect
Simon-like English when they
filibustered against Civil Rights
laws.
To me, Simon and Newman
and Mitchell often sound just
like old Ollie McClung. Ollie,
you see. didn't serve blacks in
his restaurant in Birmingham.
In 1965 the U.S. Attorney Gener
al made Ollie do just that, how
ever. and Ollie can still be heard
crying in his beer to this day
that ' the place isn't what it used
to be."
Well, neither is the English
language, but again we just
can't assume with Ollie, with Si
mon. that the old way was bet
ter. As Dr. King wrote to his fel
low but white ministers from
Birmingham jail, some para
digms deserve to be lost.
I for one eagerly await a new,
American rhetoric which in
corporates more earthiness,
more soul, more of our mix,
and less of the prissy evasive
ness of the elite academy.
The bias in favor of Chancey,
Jr.'s brand of English and
against Cleoplilus, Jr.'s is pre
cisely why we have to do away
with exams like the SAT Verbal
in its present form. That, I be
lieve, would further the causes
for which Dr. King stood much
more than making his birthday
a national holiday.
