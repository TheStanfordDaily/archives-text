## Registration irrelevant to military needs 
### 
The Carter administration
has argued that draft regis
tration is necessary "to in
crease our preparedness" and
to demonstrate "our resolve as
a nation." The administration
has also stated that a failure to
reimplement registration at
this time would leave the United
States "seriously handicapped
in the event of a national emer
gency."
These claims are highly mis
leading. Peacetime regis
tration, under current require
ments. is essentially mean
ingless in terms of the two most
important manpower mobiliza
tion problems we would face
during the crucial early stages
of war; (1) the need to deploy
large numbers of troops
abroad; and (2) the need to
avoid shortages of skilled per
sonnel.
With regard to the need for a
rapid deployment of troops
abroad, draft registration will
not be even a cosmetic solution.
We might save a total of seven
or eight days by registering
young persons in a pre-mobiliza
tion period, but classification,
training and transportation re
quirements will prevent newly
called inductees from getting to
the front until some five to six
months after being conscripted.
And it is precisely during these
months that casualties will be at
their highest level and that the

outcome of any conflict is likely
to be decided. Registration is ir
relevant to our most pressing
mobilization needs.
Similarly, registration will do
nothing to halt the sharp decline
in reenlistments of middle
grade personnel. The loss of
skilled career personnel has se
verely degraded our overall
combat readiness. Retention
rates are now so low that our
military forces are becoming
incapable of performing many
of their designated missions.
All branches of the armed
services are experiencing short
falls in reenlistment. The Air
Force has a shortage of more
than 2000 pilots; the Army has a
shortage of more than 46.000
non-commissioned officers; the
Navy has a shortage of nearly
20.000 mid-grade skilled per
sonnel, including 2600 officers.
Last year, the Navy suffered re
enlistment shortfalls in 59 of its
85 major skill areas ; as a result,
our present fleet manning is at
only 85 percent of combat read
iness.
A resumption of registration
or the draft will have no bearing
on these retention problems: we
cannot draft sergeants and colo
nels, trained technicians and
squadron commanders. The
only way to counter the decline
in reenlistments is by providing
military personnel with a living
wage and decent compensation.

While this year's 11.7 percent
pay hike is a welcome step, it is
imperative that we continue to
increase pay and benefits to off
set the impact of inflation. A
May 1980 study by the Con
gressional Budget Office
warned that unless steady im
provements are made in pay
and compensation, the short
falls in reenlistment will grow
even worse.
Former Under Secretary of
the Navy James Woolsey has es
timated that selective pay and
benefit improvements could in
crease the career proportion of
our enlisted force from 42 to 50
percent. That step alone would
reduce our enlistment require
ments by 70,000 persons a year,
or more than twice the re
cruitment shortfalls that oc
curred in 1979.
There are other actions the
United States can take to up
grade its mobilization
capabilities.
For example, we are now
working to enhance our mobile
forces, particularly our airlift
and sealift capability. We
should also increase the
strength of our reserve forces,
which now face serious prob
lems. Manpower shortfalls re
main critical, particularly in
the Army reserves; equipment
is often inadequate; training is
generally lacking; and military
preparedness is inhibited by the
lack of a proper management
structure. Since one-half of our
combat power and two-thirds of
our support capability are main
tained in our reserves, it is es
sential that they be properly
manned, equipped and trained.
Under the special funding
transfer passed last June, the
Selective Service System is
being revitalized and upgraded
from its previous "deep stand
by" status to a functioning
level. Within this context, we
should seek to develop an effec
tive post-mobilization regis
tration plan that will meet our
military needs.
Until President Jimmy
Carter decided to support the
reinstatement of draft regis
tration, even the Selective Ser
vice had concluded that regis
tration conducted in a post
mobilization phase is the most
efficient and cost-effective pro
cedure of mobilizing our forces:
The posf-mobilization option
should substantially exceed de
fense requirements, employs
the fewest number of full-time
personnel, and costs the
least. . . . (T)he reduced de
livery time provided by the oth
er (pre-mobilization) options is
redundant and unnecessary.
It is clear that draft regis
tration will not enhance our mil
itary preparedness. The de
cision to resume registration
was a weak and even dangerous
response to the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan. The Soviets are
well aware of the difference be
tween a clear, effective move to
strengthen U.S. combat

capability and a symbolic
gesture, and they will respond
accordingly.
By its action, the Carter ad
ministration has also risked di
verting the attention of the
American people from the real
steps that must be taken to rem
edy the deficiencies in our
armed forces. Enactment of
draft registration has created a
false sense of security that our
military manpower problems
are being solved. They are not.
There are a number of other
considerations which under
mine any purported benefits of
registration
The registration lists will
quickly become outdated and
useless. Individuals directly af
fected by the legislation — those
in the 18- to 20-year-old age
bracket — are a highly mobile
group. According to the Census
Bureau. 30 percent of all males
move in the 12-month period be
tween their 20th and 21st
birthdays. The Selective Ser
vice System has estimated that
half of the addresses recorded
during the initial registration
will become obsolete within two
years. In the end, we will be left
with reams of computer print
outs in need of constant updat
ing.
The reinstatement of draft
registration for men and not for
women also raises serious prob
lems of sex discrimination. A
federal court in Philadelphia
ruled last July that the current
registration system violates the
"equal protection clause of the
Constitution." and it is likely
that the Supreme Court will up
hold the lower court's decision.
Interestingly enough, the Gen
eral Counsel to the Selective
Service himself last year ad
vised that "to meet current con
stitutional law requirements of
equal protection, any system of
registration for and induction
into the armed forces must in
clude both men and women."
Finally, draft registration
has had a divisive effect on the
American public. Many young
persons have opposed a system
they perceive to be unnecessary
and unfair. Registration is
being conducted under the seri
ously flawed Military Selective
Service Act, which does not
even provide basic due process
protections.
The reinstitution of draft reg
istration will not solve our mili
tary problems, but it will divert
attention from more pressing
military needs There is no pres
ent emergency that justifies
Carter's decision. In the event
of such an emergency»it would
be essential to reinstate the
draft itself, and not merely reg
istration. The proposal for draft
registration alone was ill-con
ceived, and it is time that we
moved on to the more difficult
task of truly rebuilding our na
tional strength.
