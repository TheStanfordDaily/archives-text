# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Hank Waxman LOTS of fantasy in programming 
### 
Friday afternoon I felt rest
less so I bounded over to Wilbur
to whip Kevin's ass in racket
ball. We played every day in
high school and had become in
timate adversaries.

The dorm greeted me with,
"Doesn't have a pointtJf view,"
and I could barely make out,
"Nowhere man. the world is at
your command," from Kevin's
end of the hall I knocked twice,
tried to turn the locked
doorknob, and decided to try a
friend in Cedro.
Kevin saw me in the
courtyard through his window
and yelled at me to come in. The
snapshot I saw when I opened
the door made me wonder if this
was the same guy who had given
me 250 floorburns senior year.
His head was barely visible
amidst the swamp of computer
printouts and beer bottles. He
rose, assembled some papers
and put them under the bong on
his desk.
"Have a seat," he welcomed
me. "I hear you're in school
nowadays. Have you run out of
fledgling republics to co
lonize?"
"In good time. Why are you
hiding at 4 on a Friday after
noon?"
"I'm just not in the mood for
the happy hour crowd." He
nestled into the paper jungle
and motioned me to his bed.
I sat back and admired his
Pink Floyd ceiling. "When did
you get the stereo? It's the
perfect touch for your opium

den here."
"It's my roommate's. Lately
I'm more into playing music
than listening. And you know
damn well the paraphenalia is
mostly for decoration."
He watched me tinkle the
strings of my racket with my
thumbnail and started peeling
the label of his Lowenbrau bot
tle. "You asshole," he barked.
"I haven't played in three
months and was 80 feet into this
program."
"Kev, I don't fathom you." I
waved at the debris on the
carpet. "You're a Stanford Syn
drome Poster Child. When did
you become a LOTS junkie any
way?"
"It was the only class I had
last quarter that gave me a
sense of purpose. I couldn't cope
with going to the lecture stadi
um for Calc and Western Cul
ture so I bagged them."
"Bullshit! You could ace
those classes if you were watch
ing eight hours of TV a day."
"That's what I felt like I was
doing at this place. Just watch
ing. Not just in lectures. In the
library Plato would mesmerize
me and in section I'd by blown
away by those twits who grew
up between the covers of En
cyclopedia Britannica."

I nodded and chirped, "So you
eloped with PASCAL and have
been living on this island para
dise ever since."
"More or less. I was to the
point where my quote unquote
social life was frazzling me just
like my classes. All these di
verse talents who kept on talk
ing circles around me. Every
where I go I feel like I'm on the
brink of perceptual overload. I
could never stop, assimilate
what was coming at me, and ex
press myself."
His speech slowed slightly.
"Sure my programming is like
living in a fantasyworld. But I
won't have very long to live
there and I feel that I have some
kind of control. Like I'm build
ing instead of drowning my
self."
"Well." I waved my racketon
the way to the door, "I'll be back
with this."
"And I'll be ready to pound
your ass into the floorboards."
On the way down the hall I fig
ured I'd find the guy in Cedro
but by the time I got to my bike I
had decided just to go home and
play the piano.

but by the time I got to my bike I
had decided just to go home and
play the piano.

Friday afternoon I felt rest
less so I bounded over to Wilbur
to whip Kevin's ass in racket
ball. We played every day in
high school and had become in
timate adversaries.

The dorm greeted me with,
"Doesn't have a pointtJf view,"
and I could barely make out,
"Nowhere man. the world is at
your command," from Kevin's
end of the hall I knocked twice,
tried to turn the locked
doorknob, and decided to try a
friend in Cedro.
Kevin saw me in the
courtyard through his window
and yelled at me to come in. The
snapshot I saw when I opened
the door made me wonder if this
was the same guy who had given
me 250 floorburns senior year.
His head was barely visible
amidst the swamp of computer
printouts and beer bottles. He
rose, assembled some papers
and put them under the bong on
his desk.
"Have a seat," he welcomed
me. "I hear you're in school
nowadays. Have you run out of
fledgling republics to co
lonize?"
"In good time. Why are you
hiding at 4 on a Friday after
noon?"
"I'm just not in the mood for
the happy hour crowd." He
nestled into the paper jungle
and motioned me to his bed.
I sat back and admired his
Pink Floyd ceiling. "When did
you get the stereo? It's the
perfect touch for your opium

den here."
"It's my roommate's. Lately
I'm more into playing music
than listening. And you know
damn well the paraphenalia is
mostly for decoration."
He watched me tinkle the
strings of my racket with my
thumbnail and started peeling
the label of his Lowenbrau bot
tle. "You asshole," he barked.
"I haven't played in three
months and was 80 feet into this
program."
"Kev, I don't fathom you." I
waved at the debris on the
carpet. "You're a Stanford Syn
drome Poster Child. When did
you become a LOTS junkie any
way?"
"It was the only class I had
last quarter that gave me a
sense of purpose. I couldn't cope
with going to the lecture stadi
um for Calc and Western Cul
ture so I bagged them."
"Bullshit! You could ace
those classes if you were watch
ing eight hours of TV a day."
"That's what I felt like I was
doing at this place. Just watch
ing. Not just in lectures. In the
library Plato would mesmerize
me and in section I'd by blown
away by those twits who grew
up between the covers of En
cyclopedia Britannica."

I nodded and chirped, "So you
eloped with PASCAL and have
been living on this island para
dise ever since."
"More or less. I was to the
point where my quote unquote
social life was frazzling me just
like my classes. All these di
verse talents who kept on talk
ing circles around me. Every
where I go I feel like I'm on the
brink of perceptual overload. I
could never stop, assimilate
what was coming at me, and ex
press myself."
His speech slowed slightly.
"Sure my programming is like
living in a fantasyworld. But I
won't have very long to live
there and I feel that I have some
kind of control. Like I'm build
ing instead of drowning my
self."
"Well." I waved my racketon
the way to the door, "I'll be back
with this."
"And I'll be ready to pound
your ass into the floorboards."
On the way down the hall I fig
ured I'd find the guy in Cedro
but by the time I got to my bike I
had decided just to go home and
play the piano.
