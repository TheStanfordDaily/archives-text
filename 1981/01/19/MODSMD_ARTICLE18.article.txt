## Salvadorean revolt not Marxist 
### 
-1932 was the bottom of the
Great Depression. Breadlines
and soup kitchens were set up by
charitable groups in many
American cities to feed the des
titute. Armies of ragged, hun
gry people marched on Wash
ington. D.C. to demand that
something be done to allay their
miseries. The government
eventually responded with
many emergency programs and
reforms.
That same year, in El
Salvador, the collapse of the cof
fee trade had thrown thousands
of landless peasants out of work
and soon they were faced with
starvation.
The 14 old-line families
who essentially own or control
most of the country shrugged
the situation off as unfortunate
but not their problem.
As conditions worsened, the
desperate peasants mounted a
huge protest demonstration and
some even demanded access to
fallow private land so they could
grow their own food.
The government in power
panicked, declared the protest a
"Communist insurrection" and
sent in the troops. The esti
mates of people slaughtered in
that repression varies from
10,000 to more than 20,000. Order
was restored but the concept of
"law" no longer had any mean
ing.
Now. 48 years later, the popu
lation of El Salvador has tripled
and the "misery index" con
tinues to reach new highs.
The same super-rich 14
families still control all the land
that's fit to plant but food has to
be imported at high prices to

feed the people because there is
more profit in growing cash
crops for export such as coffee,
sugar, bananas, fiber, cattle
and cotton than in truck farming
for the local market.
The sole function of the
peasants is still to provide cheap
labor but there is massive un
employment, partly because the
trend in angri business has long
been away from labor-intensive
crops to mechanization.
El Salvador has a population
growth rate of 3.6 percent per
year and is one of the world's
most densely populated coun
tries. It ranks just ahead of
Haiti and the Dominican Re
public in food intake per capita
at less than 2000 calories per
day. In the past, the government
has shown little interest in al
leviating the wretched situation
or in considering land reform.
Despite their abject poverty
and the fact that they appear as
"unwelcome guests" in their
own country, the Salvadorean
peasants are fiercely patriotic
and devoutly loyal to their
Christian faith. Therefore, it is
grossly unfair and stupid ever to
charge them with selling out to
some ignoble, atheistic, foreign
ideology. Such revolutionaries
have no need for outside inspira

tion in their fight for social jus
tice. •
American newspapers blithe
ly parrot the line that the objec
tive of the Salvadorean revolu
tionists is to install a Marxist
(Communist) government
while at the same time they list
a minimum of six leftist groups
in the struggle. Some Marxism!
An especially brutal civil war
is now in progress in El
Salvador. Mindless "estab
lishment" torture and murder is
rampant. So far this year, ac
cording to church sources, over
9000 people, many of them unin
volved, have been system
atically and arbitrarily as
sassinated.
If any relationship still exists
between what America's ideals
were during her struggle for
freedom and justice in 1776 and
what they are today, our govern
ment will not come down on the
side of tyranny in El Salvador;
at the very least, it will stay out
of that "family fight."
Where there is cleanliness,
there is no disease; where there
is social justice, there is no com
munism.

mates of people slaughtered in
that repression varies from
10,000 to more than 20,000. Order
was restored but the concept of
"law" no longer had any mean
ing.
Now. 48 years later, the popu
lation of El Salvador has tripled
and the "misery index" con
tinues to reach new highs.
The same super-rich 14
families still control all the land
that's fit to plant but food has to
be imported at high prices to

feed the people because there is
more profit in growing cash
crops for export such as coffee,
sugar, bananas, fiber, cattle
and cotton than in truck farming
for the local market.
The sole function of the
peasants is still to provide cheap
labor but there is massive un
employment, partly because the
trend in angri business has long
been away from labor-intensive
crops to mechanization.
El Salvador has a population
growth rate of 3.6 percent per
year and is one of the world's
most densely populated coun
tries. It ranks just ahead of
Haiti and the Dominican Re
public in food intake per capita
at less than 2000 calories per
day. In the past, the government
has shown little interest in al
leviating the wretched situation
or in considering land reform.
Despite their abject poverty
and the fact that they appear as
"unwelcome guests" in their
own country, the Salvadorean
peasants are fiercely patriotic
and devoutly loyal to their
Christian faith. Therefore, it is
grossly unfair and stupid ever to
charge them with selling out to
some ignoble, atheistic, foreign
ideology. Such revolutionaries
have no need for outside inspira

tion in their fight for social jus
tice. •
American newspapers blithe
ly parrot the line that the objec
tive of the Salvadorean revolu
tionists is to install a Marxist
(Communist) government
while at the same time they list
a minimum of six leftist groups
in the struggle. Some Marxism!
An especially brutal civil war
is now in progress in El
Salvador. Mindless "estab
lishment" torture and murder is
rampant. So far this year, ac
cording to church sources, over
9000 people, many of them unin
volved, have been system
atically and arbitrarily as
sassinated.
If any relationship still exists
between what America's ideals
were during her struggle for
freedom and justice in 1776 and
what they are today, our govern
ment will not come down on the
side of tyranny in El Salvador;
at the very least, it will stay out
of that "family fight."
Where there is cleanliness,
there is no disease; where there
is social justice, there is no com
munism.
