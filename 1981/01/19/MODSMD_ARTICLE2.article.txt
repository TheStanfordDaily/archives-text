# Female MBA’s face challenges

### Sally Newman 
In business school and executive
positions nothing succeeds like suc
cess.
Women entering this competitive
environment, however, face a tougher
situation, according to a study by two
psychologists here.

News analysis

Drs. Laraine Zappert and Harvey
Weinstein found that women must win
both general acceptance of their "in
trusion" into a previously all—male
occupations and carry out "tradi
tional" roles of homemaking and child
—rearing at the same time. .
And that creates problems.
Zappert and Weinstein's study, Sex
Differences in Adaptation to Work,
focuses on the physical and psy
chological stress facing busi
nesswomen. The psychologists at
Cowell observed selected men and
women for several years after they
had attained MBA degrees.
Although women reported a high
degree of job satisfaction, they also
reported "vague symptomatic dis
orders' ' such as tension headaches and
depression. Women more often felt ov
erwhelmed by their jobs, especially
those in high—pressure positions.
Women said they were under the
most stress during those years when
they were simultaneously establish
ing careers and raising children.
The study says, however, that there
is no evidence that any of this "af
fected their functioning on the job."
How to cope
Although women professionals
were "four times as likely as men to
turn to mental health professionals,"
men were more likely to cope with
stress by drinking alcohol.
"Women have added new roles and
there are not enough support systems
— for example, childcare — to fill the
vacuum," according to Zappert. This
puts them under greater stress.
Women in Management (WIM), an
informal group of business students
here, seeks to fill that vacuum while
women are still in the Business
School.
"While we're in school, all of us are
given to believe that we'd sort of be
handed the world on a platter once we
have our degrees," said Lisa Stelck,
president of WIM.
But the first few years are probably
the most disheartening in our lives,
she said. "Expectations simply do not
meet the harsh reality of the male—

dominated business world."
To complicate matters, women are
generally satisfied with lower pay
than their male counterparts, accord
ing to Zappert and Weinstein. They
found that men, several years after
graduating from business school, earn
$42,000 annually. Women, on average,
set $31,000 as their goal.
Yet few women measured their suc
cess solely in terms of money.
Zappert and Weinstein suggest that
women may compare themselves to
other working women, not men.
Another problem businesswomen
face is the myth of the "superwoman"
— they feel obligated to become up
wardly mobile career women, model
wives and devoted mothers all at the
same time.
Fear of failure is common in women
who cannot handle all three roles at
once.
"They are very hard on themselves
because they expect to be able to do
everything without letting something
go," Weinstein said.
Student views
Women should trade—off between
those roles, said Roann Costin, a sec
ond year student interested in finan
cial management.
"I want to excel," she said, "and
that means that if I have a family, I
would-want to be an excellent mother
as well."
Costin said she could not imagine
herself without a career and would not
have children if she could not devote
herself to them. In the trade—off, she
said, she might decide against having
children.
But Costin also pointed out these de
cisions depend on what sort of job a
woman obtains and on her husband's
willingness to share in homemaking.
Costin said she hopes businesses are
willing to "make structural and pro
cedural changes to accomodate wom
en so they will want to stay."
"I worked in Washington, D.C. for
four years and people still assume
you're a secretary if you're a woman
working (there)," she said.
Using differences
"Though there are certain fields in
which it is harder to compete as a
woman, it is important to realize that
women can use their differences to be
successful," said Stelck.
Most professional women at some
point ask themselves, 'Should I be
come a man to be effective in busi
ness, adopting all of their norms and
behavior?' or 'Is it possible to retain
my personality?' she said.

One male student commented that
although he has "a very favorable
opinion of his female classmates (he)
wouldn't really want to work under
one." On the other hand, he quipped, I
wouldn't want to work under any of
my classmates. He added that he
would not mind working under a wom
an supervisor in general.
Working relationship
Women must develop interpersonal
skills to handle unconventional situ
ations, said Margaret Gray, Business
School professor.
"People are still not used to a wom
an boss — traditionally, a woman is
the student rather than the professor,
the secretary rather than the boss,"
she said.
To counter that, a woman must "set
up a working relationship with men
and other women (and) exercise au
thority and act effectively in a way
which will get the job done without
generating unnecessary hostility,"
she said.
Zappert and Weinstein add that
women should ask pertinent questions
before they enter any particular job.
There are certain questions women
should ask before taking on a job.
"Some important considerations
are the possibility of taking a year off
without jeapordizing a position or sen
iority and the relative flexibility of the
company with regard to hours and
travel requirements."
