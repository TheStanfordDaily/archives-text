## Accounting Office finds military waste 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — The General Accounting Office has issued a st
inging rebuke to top officials of the military establishment,
charging them with failure to deal with corruption and waste In
the armed forces' exchange systems.
In a report to Congress obtained by The Los Angeles Times,
the agency said top brass in the Army, Navy and Air Force and
the office of the Secretary of Defense have been lax in managing
the multibillion-dollar merchandising empire.
Despite recurring problems with fraud, kickbacks, theft and
bribery, the 58-page report distributed last week said officials
have failed to develop a system to detect and prevent those
abuses.
The Army-Air Force exchange system has been rocked by dls
closures of scandal in a continuing investigation by the U.S. At
torney's offices in Dallas and San Antonio, Texas.
GAO investigators said fraud in the Army-Air Force exchange
system has existed for 20 years and that the exchanges account
for 58 percent of all fraud cases in the Department of Defense In
the first six months of 1980.
To compete on equal terms, a vendor who did business with the
Air Force said he had to pay kickbacks. He told GAO In
vestigators that his annual commission from Air Force sales In
creased from $9000 to more than $160,000 as a result.
The GAO's hard-hitting report was particularly critical of the
Navy's merchandising operation and of the Naval Supply Sys
tems Command that oversees it.
The report also called for an overhaul of the Navy exchange
system's internal audit teams, which many ranking officers
called the first line of defense against fraud, corruption and mis
management in the Navy's merchandising system.
The audit teams, GAO investigators said, are headed by and
staffed by persons who have been involved in the management
and operation of exchanges they are auditing.
'' This creates an inherent conflict of interest which could com
promise the independence needed to make internal audits effec
tive," the report said.
