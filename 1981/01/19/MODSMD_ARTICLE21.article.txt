Lansing, Mich. (AP) — To
their surprise, pride or disgust,
thousands of people in Michigan
are learning that for years a
state police "Red Squad" spied
on them and listed their names
as potential subversives.
Among them: David Stock
man, the conservative Re
publican congressman chosen to
head the Office of Management
and Budget in the Reagan ad
ministration. Tabs were kept on
Stockman during his student
days at Michigan State Univer
sity, when he was affiliated with
a church group trying to in
crease public awareness of the
Vietnam War.
The lists include the names of
public officials, labor or
ganizers, members of socialist
and communist groups,
feminists, students, journalists
and activists in the civil rights,
gay rights and anti-war move
ments.
Under a court order, state po
lice have been trying since No
vember to notify 32,000 people
that their names are pasted on
amassed by the force's
Special Investigation Unit, the
Red Squad.
Created in 1950 by a legisla
ture caught up in the nation's
Cold War fears, the Red Squad
operated until challenged by
lawsuits in 1974.
The squad was declared un
constitutional in 1976 by a judge
who ordered it to invite people
named in the files to view their
records. It then took four years

for troopers to prepare the files
for release by removing secon
dary names contained in indi
vidual files.
Last Thursday was the dead
line for submitting a request to
see a file, but officials say it
may be months before the mi
crofilm records can be put on
paper for distribution.
Huge budget
State police told a legislator
in 1974 that the Red Squad
budget was more than $770,000
for its last year of operation.
" It was an enormous waste of
public money," said Howard Si
mon, director of the Michigan
chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union The ACLU was
among organizations on which
files were kept, and it aided law
suits filed to abolish the unit.
Various lawsuits have re
vealed that in its heyday, the
Red Squad routinely supplied in
formation on job applicants to
state agencies — and on occa
sion to utilities and other
private employers.
"Once people begin to open
those files . . . and see that 10
or 15 years ago, they may have
been denied a job, or housing or
educational opportunities, then
there may be a number of
stories that can only be charac
terized as tragic," Simon said.
State Police Lt. Norman
Smith, who is supervising re
lease of the files, acknowledged
the state may face some law
suits after the files are released,
but he added that the Red Squad

was within the law at the time of
its activity.
Techniques
Records released through a
lawsuit filed by Zolton Ferency
— a lawyer and professor who
founded the state Human Rights
Party — revealed that the Red
Squad noted license numbers
from cars parked near meetings
of groups the squad considered
subversive and put the vehicle
owners on file, even though they
were not at the meetings.
Ferency, who said he knows
of people who were listed be
cause they attended meetings at
which he spoke, added that a

state trooper had told him years
ago that there was a file on him.
The lawyer said he has not
been notified officially of such a
file — although his wife, whom
he described as "relatively in
active in politics," has been.
"Clearly there's some kind of
subterfuge going on here," said
Larry Hochman of the Wayne
County Office of Human Rela
tions. "There's no question in
my mind the state police have
files ' on other people . . .
they're simply not revealing."
Hochman, who won the right
to see his file through the suit
filed by Ferency, said, "Too

many people are making light of
what the state police did . . . as
though the surveillance of bona
fide left-wing groups would be
OK but people who just attended
things should not have been.
He said the file noted such
things as his presence at a con
cert by folksinger Pete Seeger
and at a music festival honoring
Paul Robeson.
"It bothers me, the kind of re
marks that some people have
been making, that it's a mark of
honor to have been on there," he
said. "That may be correct, but
it takes away from the obnox
iousness of it all."
