# Brown prefers Senate in 1982
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Sacramento — Governor
Jerry Brown confirmed Satur
day that if he runs for national
office next year, the move prob
ably "forecloses" any attempt
to run for president in 1984. -
And a Brown-for-U.S.-Senate
race is a higher "priority" with
him than running for a third
term as governor.
The political developments
came as Democratic leaders
met here for the biannual elec
tion of official party officers.
Focus of attention was on
Brown. Until he decides what he
is going to do next year, all the
other players in the political
musical chairs game find it hard
to chart their own courses.

Also regarding the 1984 presi
dential race. Democratic Sena
tor Alan Cranston proposed the
rules be changed to make pri
mary elections fewer and less
binding on delegates.
No more than one-third of the
convention delegates should be
locked into primary results, he
said. He denied this would be an
invitation to "bossism" and
"backroom deals" at national
nominating conventions.
Brown
Brown told reporters he has
these choices: Run for a third
term, run for the U.S. Senate,
run for president in 1984, or not
run for anything.
A third term gubernatorial
bid was the lowest priority, he

said.
"I want to think about 1984,"
he said. "I want to think about
1982 I don't think those two go
together too well.
"If I run for senator, that
pretty well forecloses it (run
ning for president in 1984.)"
If he decides to run for sena
tor next year, it would be a re
flection of his decision. Brown
said, that "1984 is not in the
cards and I'm going to have to
think in a longer term," mean
ing he might have to forego his
presidential aspirations until
1988 or beyond.
The 43-year-old governor
tried unsuccessfully for the
presidential nomination in 1976
and again last year.
