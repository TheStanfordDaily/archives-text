# Jones stars in 62-60 triumph
## Cards rise to fifth amidst nausea and nerves 
### Chris Haft 
In a pair of games at Maples
Pavilion that ought to do won
ders for local sales of Pepto-
Bismol. Maalox and other stom
ach relaxants. Stanford's men's
basketball team lost to Wash
ington, 65-57, Friday night and
outlasted Washington State,
62-60, Saturday evening.
The nauseating defeat to the
Huskies revealed the Cardinals
at close to their worst. Facing a
team it should have beaten,
Stanford played unassertively,
lacking production from
starters, reserves, and coaches
alike.

The ulcerating triumph over
the Cougars, meanwhile, had
everything a fan could want: he
roes, goats, and an exciting fin
ish. "It was a great basketball
game. In fact, it was a fantastic
game," Washington State head
coach George Raveling said.
Hearing those comments
from the losing coach, one
would expect the winning coach
to be positively euphoric. Yet
Dick Dißiaso appeared to ac
cept the victory as Stanford's
due, allowing his joy to show
only when he remarked to an
athletic department official,
"We're in fifth place."

Actually, the Cards, 2-3 in the
Paeific-10 Conference and 6-8
overall, share the No. 5 spot
with Arizona and California.
Still, any fool can tell you that
fifth place is better than last
place, and Saturday's conquest
enabled Stanford to remain
ahead of both Washington (2-4),
Washington State (2-4) and Ore
gon (1-4).
Poor Pollard
Stanford had one hell of a
time trying to stay ahead of the
Cougars. In fact, with 2:48 left,
WSU took a 58-57 lead on Ken
McFadden's layin off a steal by
Ronnie Joyner.
The Cards' John Revelli re
taliated, taking a pass in the
middle of the key and scoring on
a short but difficult double
pump jumper while being fouled
by Aaron Haskins with 2:15 to
go. Revelli missed the bonus
free throw, holding Stanford's
lead at 59-58.
Tyrone Brown's 20-foot
jumper recaptured the lead for
the Cougars, who seemed a good
bet to win when Stanford's
Brian Welch missed a shot from
the right corner moments later.
But WSU's Bryan Pollard,
who should have stayed in
Rickey's Hyatt House, tried to
rebound Welch's miss and in
stead shoved Hans Wichary
with 1:17 remaining.
Because Wichary shoots with
a flat trajectory, his shots often
appear destined to carom off the
hoop rather than go through it.
This time, however, the 6-foot-9
freshman sank two soft liners

from the free throw line for a
61-60 Stanford advantage.
With just less than a minute
left, Pollard, his goat's horns
just beginning to grow, missed a
jumper, and Welch rebounded.
The Cards then unsuccessfully
tried to play keep-away, losing
the ball to WSU on a steal with
about 30 seconds to go.
After two consecutive time
outs for strategy at :28, the
Cougars worked the ball around
for one good shot. They found a
WSU player open near the left
baseline. Unfortunately, that
player was Pollard, who drib
bled the ball off his foot and out
of bounds with 14 seconds re
maining.
Forced to commit a foul,
Brown slapped Doug Marty, the
Pac-10's second-leading free
throw shooter going into the
weekend, with 11 seconds left.
Marty sank his first shot, but
missed the next. McFadden re
bounded and maniacally drove
the length of the court. His
layup missed, but he drew a two
shot foul from Revelli.
Perhaps influenced by his
teammate Joyner, whose four
misses in five free-throw at
tempts earlier failed to wipe out
a 57-55 Stanford lead, or possibly
affected by Pollard's antics,
McFadden missed both free
throws, giving the Cards their
victory.
'Marvelous little player'
What gave the Cards a chance
to win in the first place, how
ever, was guard Keith Jones,
who scored a game- and career

high 22 points.
The 6-foot-2 whippet from
Pheonix, Ariz, never ceased im
pressing the crowd of 3472 after
taking the opening tip for a
layup. Jones' shifty drives and
soft jumpers recalled Nate
Archibald at his best in 1972-73.
"This is the most 'together'
Stanford team I've seen in my
nine years in the league — and
Jones proved that tonight,"
praised Raveling. "He's a
marvelous little player."
By halftime, Jones had tallied
15 points, already surpassing his
collegiate scoring high of 14.
"I had been a little tentative,
so Coach (Dißiaso) told me last
week in practice to be more ag
gressive," Jones said.
Jones' aggression helped the
Cards increase their eight-point
halftime lead to 12 (46-34) early
in the second half before WSU
began rallying. In all, the Cards
shot 57.9 percent (22-for-38),
their best single-game effort of
the season.
"The first half of basketball
tonight was as fine as we have
played all year," Dißiaso said.
"We used all parts of the of
fense, which was encouraging to
us."
'Three-on-five'
The night before, Stanford's
usage of barely half the offense
was. predictably enough, dis
couraging. The Cards' scoring
showed a shocking imbalance:
49 of their 57 points against
Washington were notched by
Revelli, Jones and Welch.
"I don t think there's any
great explanation (for the loss),
except that we played with only
three players tonight," theCard
coach said acerbically. "And
anytime you play three-on-five,
it's tough to win."
Reflecting on this subject af
ter Saturday night's victory,
Dißiaso expanded his criticism
to include himself and his staff.
"We. as coaches, didn't do some
things we should have done," he
said.
The trio's efforts nearly pro
pelled Stanford to victory any
way Revelli, determined as a
plow horse and just as powerful,
collected 20 points and seven re
bounds.
Jones, who added 10 points,
ignited Stanford's comeback
from a 29-22 deficit to a 29-29 tie
with a hustling steal-and-save at
the Husky baseline to foil Bob
Fronk's breakaway layuptry.
Welch scored 19 points, mak
ing every kind of shot im
aginable: long jumpers, short
fadeaways and even a roaring

slam-dunk on a fast-break that
forged the game's final tie,
47-47. with 11:20 left.
However. Welch's per
formance also reflected Stan
ford's overall ineffectiveness.
With his teammates, save Rev
elli and Jones, failing to produce
offensively. Welch's scoring
burden grew heavier.
Forced to play the entire
game, he became fatigued and
shot four air-balls in the second
half — one on a medium-range
jumper with Stanford trailing
56-54 and one on a free throw
moments later
"Maybe I was just forcing
things a few times." Welch said.
"You have to be fresh to take
those shots when you're closely
guarded."
In addition, the fears Dißiaso
had expressed earlier in the
week — that Washington would
win by controlling the game's
tempo — came true.
The surprise was that the
Huskies used a deliberate of
fensive pattern, not the running
style Stanford had expected.
