# Complicated 14 months near conclusion
## 
### 
From The Daily wire services
Washington — At first they did not
know what type of problem they had.
Sixty to 65 Americans had been
taken hostage by militant "students"
in Iran. Who the captors were, what
they wanted, what relationship they
had to the government and whether
they were rational — all those ques
tions were unanswered.
In a matter of days the government
of Iran, which had guaranteed the
safety of the American embassy,
would fall, a special presidential mis
sion to Iran headed by Ramsey Clark
would be rebuffed, and entreaties
from the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization and the pope would be re
jected.
"Our first concern was just to a
handle on the situation, lo come to
grips with what it was we were dealing
with," said Harold Saunders, the as
sistant secretary of state for the Near
East and South Asia, who would func
tion as the point man in the crisis for

the next 14 months. "The first thing
we had to determine was what we
could do and what we could not do, and
to open different channels of com
munication."
Optimism and gloom
That was the first stage of the
hostage crisis. There would be many
more. They would be marked by short
periods of optimism and long
stretches of gloom, false signals and
real signals that would fall through,
and shifting domestic political dra
mas in Tehran and Washington that
would ultimately determine the pace
and outcome of the crisis.
The first stage was marked by
seeming chaos in Tehran and caution
in Washington. It was feared that any
wrong statement, any wrong move,

could endanger the lives of the
hostages.
During the first hours there was
hope in Washington that the siege
could be ended quickly and that Iran
would abide by international norms
and free the embassy personnel of an
other country. But when that did not
happen, it became clear that the gov
ernment of Iran, if not the instigator of
the takeover, supported what had hap
pened and was taking political advan
tage of the situation.
Second week
By the second week, Iran and the
United States were taking actions
against each other. The militants had
become secondary. On Nov. 12, in re
taliation for threats to hold spy trials
and in fear of an Iranian attempt to

withdraw all its funds from the United
States, President Jimmy Carter or
dered that all Iranian assets in the
country and in U.S. banks overseas be
frozen. He also said that the United
States would no longer purchase oil
from Iran. The Iranians countered by
announcing that they were cutting off
oil shipments to the United States.
By the second week, the first de
mand also had been made: Iran
wanted Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi, who was being treated for
cancer in a New York City hospital,
returned to stand trial for crimes
against the Iranian people. That, the
administration said, was not possible.
On Nov. 18. the militants, clearly
with the advice of the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, announced that a
group of women and black hostages
would be released. It was the signal
that State Department officials had
been looking for. There was a channel
of communication, an indirect one at
best, and it had worked. Somebody in
Tehran had made a decision.
It meant, to Washington officials,
that the hostage situation was suscep
tible to diplomacy.
For the next six weeks, the United
States pursued a two-track policy of
increasing economic pressure on Iran
and trying to open negotiations.
Assumptions were made by the end
of November that would guide the
American effort for the coming 14
months: that at least some Iranian
leaders understood that the United
States would not meet their demands,
that the Iranian government would
feel increasingly isolated by world
opinion and that the hostage situation
would so paralyze the revolutionary
movement that the Iranians would de
cide it was not worthwhile to continue
holding the hostages.
Khomeini in control
"The order to release the hostages
was important because it indicated

that Khomeini did have control over
the situation and that it was possible to
negotiate with the Iranians," Saun
ders said.
But State Department officials un
derestimated the political divisions
inside Iran that would prevent the
moderates from making any con
cession to the United States and the
political benefit that the hostages
would be to the Iranians.
In December the administration at
tempted to build allied support for an
Iranian boycott and to explore,
through third parties, elements of an
agreement. One key element the
Americans tried to communicate was
that under no circumstances would
the shah be turned over to Tehran. Nor
would the United States offer an
apology for its past actions in Iran.
January
At first there were signs that an end
to the crisis could be reached. But on
Jan. 10 Carter called in congressional
leaders and told them there was no
foreseeable break. The pattern had
developed: Iranian moderates sig
naled that they wanted to find a way
out; hardliners prevented the mod
erates from taking any concrete steps.
The strategy was now to wait for
Iran's presidential elections and hope

a consensus would develop to end the
crisis.
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
in December 1979 had a major effect
on American policy. By the middle of
January 1980 the administration not
only had concluded that the crisis
would be prolonged, but had also de
cided that it would be coun
terproductive to damage Iran eco
nomically, which might force it to
move closer to the Soviet Union. The
pressure for allied economic sanc
tions was dropped, and the American
negotiating position became more
conciliatory.
Bani-Sadr elected
But it did not work. Although, in the
next two months, there would be
hopeful signs from Iran, they would
never materialize. Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr was elected president; that was
positive. The Iranians allowed a U.N.
commission to visit Iran and hear Ira
nian grievances against the United
States; that was positive. It was an
nounced that the hostages would be
transferred to government control, an
essential step.
On Feb. 13, Carter said at a news
conference that there were positive
signs. And for the first time there was
a demand by the Iranians that the $6

billion to $8 billion in assets frozen in
November be released as part of a
deal. That was positive.
But each time, the positive signs
were followed by negative
statements. Bani-Sadr represented
only one faction; other Iranian of
ficials contradicted what he said. The
U.N. commission was not allowed to
visit the hostages. A complete
bargaining package was never for
mulated. On Feb. 23, Khomeini
shocked the Americans by saying the
crisis could not be dealt with until a
new parliament had convened — and
that was not due until the middle of
April. And the government did not
take control of the hostages.
Political season
All through this, the American polit
ical season progressed. Carter rose in
the polls and defeated Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) in the early pri
maries, when news from Iran was up
beat.
The preparations for a surprise raid
to rescue the hostages, under way
since Nov. 4, went into high gear
almost immediately after the collapse
of negotiations at the beginning of
April.
In the early morning of April 25,
Carter announced the failure of the

rescue mission. The news was stun
ning and bitter, but it had the effect of
lancing the hostage boil. For most of
the next four months the crisis abated
as a public issue. Diplomatic efforts
first went into limbo and then gradu
ally resumed through third parties.
September
The attitude of the Iranian govern
ment seemed to become more serious
in September, after a new Parliament
and government were organized. The
outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in late
September added a significant incen
tive for the Iranians to end the crisis.
During August, Secretary of State
Edmund Muskie had sent signals,
through third parties, that the United
States was ready to negotiate an end to
the crisis — the first direct action
taken by the United States since the
abortive raid. On Sept. 13, Khomeini
announced four conditions for release
of the hostages: a guarantee that the
United States would not interfere in
Iranian internal affairs, a return of
the frozen assets, a guarantee against
future legal claims and return of the
shah's wealth. Not mentioned was a
demand for an American apology — a
positive development, according to
U.S. diplomats. It was the first time

there seemed to be a formula over
which there could be negotiations.
State Department officials now con
cede that there was a secret meeting
in late September between Deputy
Secretary of State Warren Christ
opher and a high-level Iranian official
that indicated a deal could be made on
the basis of Khomeini's points.
But the Iranians, U.S. officials say,
just could not get their act together, as
evidenced by the on-again, off-again
character of the talks in the closing
days of the U.S. election campaign. "I
think the Iranians believed they could
get a better deal before the election —
but they just couldn't agree among
themselves on a proposal until it was
too late, ' one high-level State Depart
ment official said.
The process that began just before
the election gathered momentum af
terward. For the first time, there
were actual negotiations, with the Al
gerians acting as go-betweens.
The Iranians had missed the Elec
tion Day deadline, but the prospect of
starting all over again with a new
president made Ronald Reagan's in
auguration, Jan. 20, a new deadline.
This time they were able to get their
act together.
