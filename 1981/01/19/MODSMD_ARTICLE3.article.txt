# Complicated 14 months near conclusion

From The Daily wire services
Washington — At first they did not
know what type of problem they had.
Sixty to 65 Americans had been
taken hostage by militant "students"
in Iran. Who the captors were, what
they wanted, what relationship they
had to the government and whether
they were rational — all those ques
tions were unanswered.
In a matter of days the government
of Iran, which had guaranteed the
safety of the American embassy,
would fall, a special presidential mis
sion to Iran headed by Ramsey Clark
would be rebuffed, and entreaties
from the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization and the pope would be re
jected.
"Our first concern was just to a
handle on the situation, lo come to
grips with what it was we were dealing
with," said Harold Saunders, the as
sistant secretary of state for the Near
East and South Asia, who would func
tion as the point man in the crisis for

the next 14 months. "The first thing
we had to determine was what we
could do and what we could not do, and
to open different channels of com
munication."
Optimism and gloom
That was the first stage of the
hostage crisis. There would be many
more. They would be marked by short
periods of optimism and long
stretches of gloom, false signals and
real signals that would fall through,
and shifting domestic political dra
mas in Tehran and Washington that
would ultimately determine the pace
and outcome of the crisis.
The first stage was marked by
seeming chaos in Tehran and caution
in Washington. It was feared that any
wrong statement, any wrong move,

could endanger the lives of the
hostages.
During the first hours there was
hope in Washington that the siege
could be ended quickly and that Iran
would abide by international norms
and free the embassy personnel of an
other country. But when that did not
happen, it became clear that the gov
ernment of Iran, if not the instigator of
the takeover, supported what had hap
pened and was taking political advan
tage of the situation.
Second week
By the second week, Iran and the
United States were taking actions
against each other. The militants had
become secondary. On Nov. 12, in re
taliation for threats to hold spy trials
and in fear of an Iranian attempt to

withdraw all its funds from the United
States, President Jimmy Carter or
dered that all Iranian assets in the
country and in U.S. banks overseas be
frozen. He also said that the United
States would no longer purchase oil
from Iran. The Iranians countered by
announcing that they were cutting off
oil shipments to the United States.
By the second week, the first de
mand also had been made: Iran
wanted Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi, who was being treated for
cancer in a New York City hospital,
returned to stand trial for crimes
against the Iranian people. That, the
administration said, was not possible.
On Nov. 18. the militants, clearly
with the advice of the Ayatollah
