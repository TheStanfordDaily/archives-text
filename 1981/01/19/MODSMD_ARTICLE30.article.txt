Philadelphia (AP) — Finish
ing his rookie year in the Super
Bowl has a little extra signifi
cance for Philadelphia Eagles'
cornerback Roynell Young, who
will be playing in his home town
— New Orleans — in front of his
family and friends.
"1 feel real good about going
back home for the game,"
Young said. "I can't think of a
better way to end a rookie sea
son than to win a Super Bowl."
But Young, the Eagles' first
round draft pick last year, is
keeping an inner calm about the
situation.
"I can understand the jubila
tion that the older guys, the ones
who have been here through all

the bad years, feel. And I'm ex
cited. too. But I have a job to do
down there and I'm not going to
let anything get in the way of
that," he said.
The Eagles, champions of the
National Conference, meet the
Oakland Raiders, winners of the
American Conference, Jan. 25
at the Louisiana Superdome for
the National Football League
championship.
Young and the rest of the
Eagles held their final workout
in Philadelphia Saturday, brav
ing freezing weather at snow
rimmed Veterans Stadium.
Eagles Coach Dick Vermeil
said he scheduled a meeting and
a brief workout at the practice

site of the New Orleans Saints
for today.
Young, 23, fully expects to be
deluged with requests for time,
tickets and many other things
from friends he didn't even
know he had in his home town.
He says he's ready.
"I've already told my family
and my friends that I have a job
to do and after it's done, then
everything else follows," he
said. "My family is under
standing. They respect my
judgment on these things."
Young learned his lesson, he
said, when the Eagles went to
New Orleans during the regular

season to play the Saints. He
was besieged with ticket re
quests and wound up providing
40 or 50 for his friends — and
almost as many headaches for
himself.
This time, Young's biggest
headache should be Raiders
quarterback Jim Plunkett and
10-year veteran pass receiver
Bob Chandler.
When Oakland played Phila
delphia during the regular sea
son, Plunkett threw 13 of his 36
passes into Young's territory.
He completed only two — a 29-
yarder to Chandler and an 86-
yard touchdown bomb to Cliff
Branch.
