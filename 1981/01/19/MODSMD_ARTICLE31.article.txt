## Hobbled Cardinal gymnasts lose both Los Angeles meets 
### Dean Eyre 
After dropping a pair of
meets this weekend in Southern
California, the women's gym
nastics team finds itself count
ing even more injuries than it
had last week. Hurt feelings or
bruised spirits heal faster than
ankles or knees, and time to re
cuperate during a busy schedule
is one thing that the Cardinals
don't have much of.
Stanford came up short
against USC by a 130.70-126.00
margin Friday night, and Card
head coach Jackie Walker cited
overall talent as the difference.
Judging from the Stanford
ability sidelined during the
meet, the Cards put together a
valiant performance. Reinjured
ankles kept Karen Hall and
Anne Smith out of competition
and concerns over a possible
knee re-injury forced Jeanette
Lacoste to cut her floor execise
routine short.
USC's Donna Turbow won
beam (8.95), vaulting (8.70) and
floor (8.90) and teammate Suzy
Kellems took top honors on un
even parallel bars with 8.90.
Merilyn Chapman had enough
high scores to capture the all
around title with 34.55 points.
Against third-ranked UCLA
Saturday night, now 2-1 overall,
Stanford suffered a 141.50-127.50
loss. Bruin Sharon Shapiro, top
rated performer in women's
collegiate gymnastics this year,
lived up to the billing with firsts
in all events. Her marks in
cluded 9.25 in vaulting, 9.45 on
bars, 8.95 on beam, 9.50 in floor
and 37.15 in all-around.
Chapman had a 9.25 routine on

bars and finished third in all
around with 34.30 points.
Walker said that Shapiro
"looked super," even better
than last year and predicted
that UCLA will go on to win the
national championships. De
spite a wider margin of defeat,
Walker felt her team performed
better against UCLA than USC.
Stanford's record dropped to
1-3. The Cards host conference
rival San Jose State and Cal
Poly Pomona in Maples

Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. this Fri
day.
Prior to this weekend's action
Walker had said, "I'll be happy
when these meets are over be
cause we'll have a home meet
and I always enjoy home meets
more than being away. We cer
tainly have enjoyed some really
good crowd support at our first
two home meets. I know the at
tendance at a couple of our away
meets won't be anything like the
audience we've had at home. "
