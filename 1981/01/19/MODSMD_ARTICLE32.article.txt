"We have as much talent as anyone," said women's basketball
coach Dotty McCrea last week. The Cardinals proved her statement
Saturday night by crushing the Fresno State Battlin' Bulldogs at
Fresno, 69-48.
McCrea had designated this as a "must-win" game if the team is
to have a shot at the AIAW regionals.
"It was a well-balanced team effort," said assistant coach
Michael Kehoe. Certainly Stanford's scoring reflects that balance.
Anne Miller led the Cards with 14 points, followed by Kim Kupferer
(11), Louise Smith (10), and Meg Metzger and Denise McGuire
(nine apiece).
McGuire was seven-for-seven from the free throw line and Smith
collected nine rebounds.
The turning point in the game, according to Kehoe, came late in
the first half, when the Cards applied a press. "We went from even
to eight points up with a few crucial turnovers," said Kehoe. The
Cards finished the half ahead, 28-20.
Stanford dominated the second half, allowing everyone to play.
"The bench played very well, and everyone scored," Kehoe said.
The Cards' last game, a loss to San Jose State, was tough because
it was their NorCal Conference opener, and was, in McCrea's eyes,
"one of the hardest-fought games" she had ever seen at Stanford.
The win against Fresno evens up the Cardinals' record at 1-1 and
gives them a 10-8 record overall.
The Cards play two road games against USF and University of the
Pacific this week, and return to Maples Pavilion next week to face
Santa Clara and Fresno State.
