Stanford's point total would
have certainly been higher had
the women's team competed —
in fact, the Cardinals would
have challenged Cal for the vic
tory. However, head coach
Holger Dietze's squad was
fatigued from five meets in sev
en days and decided not to par
ticipate.
The highlight of the meet for
the Cards came in the final
event, when Stanford's 1600-
meter relay team of Bari
Weick, Dave Sims, Monte
Brown and Craig Spada won the
race in 14:34.39. edging the Bear
quartet, which included world
record holders Par Arvidsson
and Peter Szchmidt, by .39.
