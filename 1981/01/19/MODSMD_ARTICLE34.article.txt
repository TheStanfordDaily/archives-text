Begin to dissolve parliament
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin's gov
ernment, battered by economic and foreign policy prob
lems and the loss of its ruling majority, announced yester
day it will dissolve Israel's Parliament and call elections
for July 7, four months ahead of schedule.
The opposition Labor Party immediately proposed elec
tions for May 12 and accused the government of stalling.
Begin's term expires Nov. 17.
Begin said after a Cabinet meeting that his Likud Party
would introduce the necessary legislation today to dis
solve Israel's Parliament, the Knesset. He said he hoped
the bill could be passed by tomorrow.
After the adoption of a dissolution bill, the government
continues to function with full powers until a new govern
ment is formed, which could take several months after the
elections
Israel law stipulates a minimum 100-day period between
announcement of elections and voting day, but it can be
longer. Election day is set by the dissolution bill itself.
Cabinet secretary Aryeh Naor said the dissolution bill
would be presented Tuesday for the first of three readings.
The bill then goes to committee where the Likud and Labor
Party may negotiate a compromise election date.
Naor said the bill may not complete the legislative proc
ess until next week.
We examined all kinds of dates and we reached the
conclusion that July 7 was the most convenient (election
date)," Begin said.
The Labor Party, the largest opposition bloc, said it was
ready to negotiate a compromise date in late May or June.
"We believe such a long campaign is wasteful," said
party spokesman Israel Peleg. "What the Likud failed to
do until now it is not going to do in the next five months."

Moshe Shahal, Chairman of the Labor Party's parlia
mentary faction, accused the government of setting a date
during the summer holidays to take advantage of the fact
that many voters will be abroad.
Public opinion polls favor Labor in the elections, but Be
gin supporters discount the results because the polls also
reflect a large undecided vote.
The Likud faces an uphill battle with voter disaffection
over a world record 132.9 percent annual inflation rate and
unemployment topping 5 percent, about 2 percent above
normal.
Cal Democrats oppose Haig
Sacramento — Ignoring the recommendations of Cali
fornia's top Democrat in Congress, the California Demo
cratic Party urged Congress yesterday to reject the nomi
nation of Alexander Haig for Secretary of State.
A resolution opposing President-elect Ronald Reagan's
nomination of Haig, who was White House chief of staff to
former President Richard Nixon, was adopted with
almost no debate by 1500 delegates to the annual California
Democratic Party convention.
Earlier in the convention, U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston of
California, the No. 2 ranking Democrat in the Senate, said
he had "some reservations" about Haig. But Cranston
said he was confident that Haig "will be very forceful in
foreign policy'' without being "trigger happy."
The party also adopted resolutions opposing filling of
the New Melones reservoir, opposing startup of the Diablo
Canyon nuclear plant, supporting the right of women to
abortions, and urging a ban on the possession of handguns
in California,
The resolutions and election of new party officers for the
coming two years were the principal business of the three

day convention, which sparked little interest except for
the vote Friday to strip away Ku Klux Klan leader Tom
Metzger's credential as a delegate and official member of
the party's governing State Central Committee.
Metzger had initially won his convention seat by captur
ing the Democratic nomination in a heavily Republican
congressional district near San Diego.
In the race for party posts, San Francisco political ac
tivist Nancy Pelosi was elected to a two-year term as
statewide chairwoman, and San Francisco architect Tom
Hsieh was elected statewide vice-chairman.
Dallas voters reject tax cut
Dallas One of the nation's most sweeping tax cut
plans since California's Proposition 13 was defeated by
Dallas voters on Saturday as they rejected a proposal that
would have slashed property taxes by nearly 30 percent.
With 145 of the city's 230 precincts counted, there were
45,141 votes against the proposal with only 23,202 in favor.
Clarence Simmons, president of the group that forced the
property tax referendum, conceded defeat late Saturday.
Critics had said the proposed amendment to the City
Charter would cripple the city's ability to provide vital
services.
Racial killer faces death penalty
Oakland — The jury that convicted Darlin Cromer of
first-degree murder in the racial slaying of a 5-year-old
black boy will decide this week whether she is sane — a
decision that could lead to her death in the San Quentin gas
chamber.
It found sane, the 34-year-old white woman could be
come the first person in California history to face possible
execution for a murder with the sole motivation of race.
Cromer spirited Reginald Williams away from where he
was playing near his Alameda home last February,
strangled him and drove him to a bayside dump where she
buried him in a shallow, muddy grave. She led police to the
site.

The jury convicted Cromer of murder on Saturday, flat
ly rejecting a "diminished capacity" defense and psy
chiatric testimony that Cromer thought she was strangl
ing an animal in killing the boy.
Psychiatrists from Stanford University and the Men
nmger Clinic had testified that on the day of the killing,
Cromer was too deranged to premeditate murder.
They said her schizophrenia convinced her that blacks
were "animals" on earth to be "eaten like cows or
chickens."
Census indicates rural growth
Los Angeles — Preliminary findings of the 1980 census
show the state's rural areas are growing faster than its
cities for the first time in modern history.
The population gains in Sierra Nevada and other rural
areas are dramatic, even though the absolute numbers are
small compared to the large population gains in Southern
California.
A preliminary analysis of the census shows a marked
change in population patterns over the last decade, a
change that could mean substantial political, social and
economic changes in coming years.
"This is the first time we've seen a major reversal in a
century-long trend," said Ted Bradshaw, a research soci
ologist at the Institute of Governmental Studies at the Uni
versity of California, Berkeley.
"In California up to now rural areas did not get their
share of the growth. They lagged well behind the urban
areas," he said."That is completely reversed now. The ru
ral areas are growing three times as fast as the urban
areas."
Today's weather
Periods of rain or showers continuing most of the day
today. Cloudy with a chance of showers tonight and tomor
row Lows in the upper 40s to low 50s Highs in the upper
50s to low 60s. Small craft advisory including the Suisun
Bay and the West Delta. Chance of rain 70 percent today.

It found sane, the 34-year-old white woman could be

execution for a murder with the sole motivation of race.
Cromer spirited Reginald Williams away from where he
was playing near his Alameda home last February,
strangled him and drove him to a bayside dump where she
buried him in a shallow, muddy grave. She led police to the
site.

The jury convicted Cromer of murder on Saturday, flat
ly rejecting a "diminished capacity" defense and psy
chiatric testimony that Cromer thought she was strangl
ing an animal in killing the boy.
Psychiatrists from Stanford University and the Men
nmger Clinic had testified that on the day of the killing,
Cromer was too deranged to premeditate murder.
They said her schizophrenia convinced her that blacks
were "animals" on earth to be "eaten like cows or
chickens."
Census indicates rural growth
Los Angeles — Preliminary findings of the 1980 census
show the state's rural areas are growing faster than its
cities for the first time in modern history.
The population gains in Sierra Nevada and other rural
areas are dramatic, even though the absolute numbers are
small compared to the large population gains in Southern
California.
A preliminary analysis of the census shows a marked
change in population patterns over the last decade, a
change that could mean substantial political, social and
economic changes in coming years.
"This is the first time we've seen a major reversal in a
century-long trend," said Ted Bradshaw, a research soci
ologist at the Institute of Governmental Studies at the Uni
versity of California, Berkeley.
"In California up to now rural areas did not get their
share of the growth. They lagged well behind the urban
areas," he said."That is completely reversed now. The ru
ral areas are growing three times as fast as the urban
areas."
Today's weather
Periods of rain or showers continuing most of the day
today. Cloudy with a chance of showers tonight and tomor
row Lows in the upper 40s to low 50s Highs in the upper
50s to low 60s. Small craft advisory including the Suisun

Begin to dissolve parliament
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin's gov
ernment, battered by economic and foreign policy prob
lems and the loss of its ruling majority, announced yester
day it will dissolve Israel's Parliament and call elections
for July 7, four months ahead of schedule.
The opposition Labor Party immediately proposed elec
tions for May 12 and accused the government of stalling.
Begin's term expires Nov. 17.
Begin said after a Cabinet meeting that his Likud Party
would introduce the necessary legislation today to dis
solve Israel's Parliament, the Knesset. He said he hoped
the bill could be passed by tomorrow.
After the adoption of a dissolution bill, the government
continues to function with full powers until a new govern
ment is formed, which could take several months after the
elections
Israel law stipulates a minimum 100-day period between
announcement of elections and voting day, but it can be
longer. Election day is set by the dissolution bill itself.
Cabinet secretary Aryeh Naor said the dissolution bill
would be presented Tuesday for the first of three readings.
The bill then goes to committee where the Likud and Labor
Party may negotiate a compromise election date.
Naor said the bill may not complete the legislative proc
ess until next week.
We examined all kinds of dates and we reached the
conclusion that July 7 was the most convenient (election
date)," Begin said.
The Labor Party, the largest opposition bloc, said it was
ready to negotiate a compromise date in late May or June.
"We believe such a long campaign is wasteful," said
party spokesman Israel Peleg. "What the Likud failed to
do until now it is not going to do in the next five months."

Moshe Shahal, Chairman of the Labor Party's parlia
mentary faction, accused the government of setting a date
during the summer holidays to take advantage of the fact
that many voters will be abroad.
Public opinion polls favor Labor in the elections, but Be
gin supporters discount the results because the polls also
reflect a large undecided vote.
The Likud faces an uphill battle with voter disaffection
over a world record 132.9 percent annual inflation rate and
unemployment topping 5 percent, about 2 percent above
normal.
Cal Democrats oppose Haig
Sacramento — Ignoring the recommendations of Cali
fornia's top Democrat in Congress, the California Demo
cratic Party urged Congress yesterday to reject the nomi
nation of Alexander Haig for Secretary of State.
A resolution opposing President-elect Ronald Reagan's
nomination of Haig, who was White House chief of staff to
former President Richard Nixon, was adopted with
almost no debate by 1500 delegates to the annual California
Democratic Party convention.
Earlier in the convention, U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston of
California, the No. 2 ranking Democrat in the Senate, said
he had "some reservations" about Haig. But Cranston
said he was confident that Haig "will be very forceful in
foreign policy'' without being "trigger happy."
The party also adopted resolutions opposing filling of
the New Melones reservoir, opposing startup of the Diablo
Canyon nuclear plant, supporting the right of women to
abortions, and urging a ban on the possession of handguns
in California,
The resolutions and election of new party officers for the
coming two years were the principal business of the three

day convention, which sparked little interest except for
the vote Friday to strip away Ku Klux Klan leader Tom
Metzger's credential as a delegate and official member of
the party's governing State Central Committee.
Metzger had initially won his convention seat by captur
ing the Democratic nomination in a heavily Republican
congressional district near San Diego.
In the race for party posts, San Francisco political ac
tivist Nancy Pelosi was elected to a two-year term as
statewide chairwoman, and San Francisco architect Tom
Hsieh was elected statewide vice-chairman.
Dallas voters reject tax cut
Dallas One of the nation's most sweeping tax cut
plans since California's Proposition 13 was defeated by
Dallas voters on Saturday as they rejected a proposal that
would have slashed property taxes by nearly 30 percent.
With 145 of the city's 230 precincts counted, there were
45,141 votes against the proposal with only 23,202 in favor.
Clarence Simmons, president of the group that forced the
property tax referendum, conceded defeat late Saturday.
Critics had said the proposed amendment to the City
Charter would cripple the city's ability to provide vital
services.
Racial killer faces death penalty
Oakland — The jury that convicted Darlin Cromer of
first-degree murder in the racial slaying of a 5-year-old
black boy will decide this week whether she is sane — a
