# Christopher has tough intermediary role

From the Daily wire services with staff reports
Algiers, Algeria — The switchboard
for the final negotiations on freeing
the American hostages in Iran was
comprised of a slightly shabby Check
er limousine, two elegant offices and a
twisting hill road that connects them
Manning the switchboard — the vi
tal connection between Washington
and Tehran — was Warren Christ
opher. deputy secretary of State, a 55-
year-old attorney.
His daughter Kristen Christopher, a
freshman at Stanford, said "Through
out this whole thing, my father has
kept saying that I shouldn't believe
anything until the whole issue is re
solved. I've been disappointed
before . . .I'll have to wait until the
hostages are finally released before I
can be relieved."
And his son Thomas Christopher,
also a Stanford senior, said "I can't
imagine my father getting any more

than a little sleep every night."
Both expressed relief that their
father's mission will soon be com
pleted — successfully.
Around the clock
Almost around the clock, messages
moved between Washington and the
American embassy in Algiers, and be
tween the Algerian Ministry of For
eign Affairs and Tehran.
With each new development, Christ
opher climbed aboard the cream-col
ored Checker and twisted through the
streets of this precipitous hillside city
of the ministry office of Foreign Min
ister Mohammed Benyahia.
Sometimes he went with a single
aide from one of two special teams
here. Sometimes he went with Am
bassador Ulrich Haynes, the Ameri
can representative in Algeria, or
Haynes' deputy, Christopher Ross
Sometimes several meetings went on
at the same time. Christopher talking

with the foreign minister, while other
American experts met Algerian coun
terparts, charged with relaying the
American messages to the govern
ment of Iran.
On Saturday, Christopher made the
five-minute drive twice. Yesterday,
as activity became feverish, he made
his first trip to the Foreign Ministry
just a few minutes after midnight, re
turned to the Embassy at 2:15 a.m.,
and less than seven hours later was
back at the ministry for the first of
three more meetings that continued
almost to midnight. Throughout the
day. a second session bringing togeth
er the eight-member legal-financial
team with their Algerian counterparts
was under way.
Christopher s working space was
the office of Ambasssador Haynes, a
blue-carpeted room with a magnif
icent view of the Bay of Algiers. An ad
jacent room in the embassy and three

rooms on the ground floor below had
been turned over to the State Depart
ment hostage-negotiating team.
The Algerian foreign minister re
ceived Christopher in the nine-story
ministry building, which also over
looks the city below, its pale blue shut
ters characteristic of Algiers.
Both at the embassy and the min
istry. there was one rule: silence on
substance. Neither the American
team here, nor the Algerians, called
the "positive intermediary,'' would
comment on what had been going on.
Hostess at the American end of the
switchboard here was Yolande
Haynes, wife of the Ambassador. She
not only has had Christopher and his
senior staff as house guests in the em
bassy residence, but she has also seen
to it that the embassy snack bar has
stayed open for weary reporters and
television cameramen recording the
comings and goings.
