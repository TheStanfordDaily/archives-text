## Marcos lifts martial law 
### Los Angeles Times 
Manila, Philippine! — President Ferdinand
Marcos announced Friday that he would end eight
years of martial law Saturday. But he is expected
to keep his authoritarian powers as the Philip
pines moves toward promised national elections
in 1984
Marcos, who was elected in 1965 and imposed
martial law in September 1972, told more than 200
members of his ruling New Society Movement
that he will sign a proclamation lifting martial
law.
"We meet for the last time as an emergency
government... as the crisis caretaker of the de
mocracy of the Philippines," Marcos told those
gathered at Malacanang, the presidential palace.
Few if any Filipinos were excited about the
event. Reactions ranged from a cynical belief that
nothing will change, to optimism that the Philip
pines will return to a democratic system by 1984
as Marcos has promised. Some Filipinos were
simply indifferent, and foreign observers took a
wait-and-see attitude.
"Marcos has lifted everything else around
here." a cynical Filipino politician said. "So why
not lift martial law?"
Wealthiest leader
Marcos, whose cronies have grown rich at the
presidential trough, is widely believed to be the
wealthiest chief of state in Asia along with his
handsome wife who is his second in command. He
also is recognized, even by his critics, as the
shrewdest politician in the country's postwar his
tory.
Despite the clamor against martial law by the
Philippines' educated elite — some members of
the Catholic clergy, students and middle class ur
ban intellectuals — not everybody wants to see it
abolished.
"If you counted all the heads in the Philip
pines." a well-placed American source said,
"you'd probably find that many people don't give
a damn one way or another about martial law, and
even more who would prefer to keep it because
they remember the bad old days before martial
law."
"It was a misnomer to begin with," one analyst

said. "There never were any tanks in the streets
and only one person was executed and he was a
Chinese dope peddler. Of course, there were plen
ty of abuses by the army — people kidnapped, tor
tured and sometimes killed. But Marcos tried to
stop that."
Marcos has already terminated what his critics
called two of the most "repulsive" features of
martial law — military tribunals and military de
tention centers. And lie has restored the writ of
habeas corpus to all but those areas of the south
ern Philippines plagued by a seemingly endless
Moslem insurgency.
Prisoners released
The government claims to have released 2649
prisoners during the past year, but this figure in
cludes common criminals as well as political de
tainees, and a reliable breakdown is hard to come
by. The best guess is that about one-third of the to
tal were political prisoners.
However, Marcos has no intention of freeing
hardcore Communists and middle class urban ter
rorists charged with being responsible for a series
of recent bombings. Military sources said 741 of
these prisoners will be transferred from military
detention centers to the national penitentiary
over the weekend.
The president also has promised to lift re
straints on the press, restore freedom of speech
and assembly and liberalize his ban on strikes. At
the same time. Marcos has said flatly he has no
intention of surrendering his emergency powers,
which are embodied in the new constitution.
This has led his critics to denounce the lifting of
martial law as a hollow gesture. But despite the
cynicism about Marcos' sincerity, Western
diplomatic sources look upon the lifting of martial
law as more than a public relations ploy.
The essential point, as some analysts see it, is
not that Marcos is keeping his emergency powers
but whether and how he uses them.
Political observers say the press and the judi
ciary will serve as indicators of just how serious
Marcos is about easing controls. Whether judges
who owe their jobs to Marcos will dare to rule
against him remains to be seen.
