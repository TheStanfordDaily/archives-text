# Recruits for Islamic revolution
## Khadafy establishes ‘pan- African’ legion 
### Washington Post 
Washington — A special "Pan-African
Legion" formed by Libya for intervention
outside its borders and including other Ar
abs and black Africans as well as Libyans
played a significant role in Col. Moammer
Khadafy's recent victory in Chad, Western
officials say.
The Chadian fighting marks the first test
— a success — for Khadafy's version of the
Foreign Legion. Its deployment is seen as
part of a concerted drive to build up Libya's
regular Army and form such intervention
forces by recruiting foreign Arabs, Asians
and Africans through offers of high pay and,
in some cases, simple dragooning.
The effort reflects Khadafy's long
standing sense of pan-Arab and pan-Islamic
revolutionary mission, which has led him to
intervene in about 45 countries in the Middle
East, Africa. Europe, Asia and even Latin
America, according to an estimate pre
pared by U.S. officials.
It has resulted in private complaints from
several African governments that their
citizens working in Libya's oil economy
were press-ganged like 19th century sailors
— that they were picked up in the street to
awake the next day in the Libyan Army.
Senegal has protested openly that a group
of Senegalese, lured to Libya with offers of
jobs in a desert work camp, found when they
got there that it was actually a military
training camp for Senegalese Islamic re
bels.

Khadafy, whose oil has given Libya near
ly boundless wealth, has voiced determina
tion to increase the size of his armed forces
to half a million to go along with the large
arsenal of Soviet- and French-built weapons
he has accumulated since coming to power
in 1969. But his population is small — fewer
than 3 million — and generally too un
sophisticated to use and maintain modern
weaponry. As a result, Soviet and East Eu
ropean advisers number about 3000, and the
35.000-man regular Libyan Army ranks in
clude Pakistanis. Palestinians and other
Arab nationals.
Increased recruitment
To increase the foreign contingent and
build its intervention forces, the Libyan
government actively recruits among the
black Africans, Pakistanis, Sudanese,
Palestinians, Egyptians and Tunisians who
leave the poverty of their own villages to
work in Libya. Sometimes recruiting ex
tends to Libyan prisons, where Libyan and
foreign criminals win freedom from their
cells for joining what Khadafy's Army calls
"suicide squads" specially trained for com
mando-type action.
Recently Khadafy's aides have begun
placing recruiting advertisements in news
papers in Beirut and across the Persian Gulf
— and even in Britain — promising any Arab
who volunteers for service in the Libyan
Army good pay and a chance to participate
in the Islamic resurgence that Khadafy in
creasingly appears resolved to foster

among his African neighbors as well as in
the Middle East.
Although Khadafy's money is accepted by
a number of Arab governments and several
factions of the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization, his often impetuous zeal is
something of an embarrassment in the Arab
world, and a number of leaders there keep
him at arm's length. In Chad and its neigh
bors, however, Khadafy appears to have
found new and potentially fertile fields for
planting his Islam-based ideology of direct
rule by "the masses."
In the last several months, Libyan activi
ty has been particularly intense in these
nearby African countries. Sometimes con
tacts are friendly, such as the reported
training of troops from Guinea, Togo and
Benin. But sometimes they are hostile:
Charges of meddling in internal affairs have
led to breaks in diplomatic relations or ex
pulsion of Libyan envoys by Senegal, Gam
bia, Ghana, Niger, Mauritania, Equatorial
Guinea and Nigeria.
Western officials, basing their estimates
on satellite reconnaissance, say Khadafy in
the last few weeks has increased the size of
his force there to between 6000 and 7000
men, backed up by about 100 Soviet-made
T54 tanks and Soviet- and Brazilian-made
armored personnel carriers, across Chad's
500,000 square miles.
