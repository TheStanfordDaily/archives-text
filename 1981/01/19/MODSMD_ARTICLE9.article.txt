# U.S. will ship weapons to Somalia
## 
### Washington Post 
Nairobi, Kenya â€” The U.S.
State Department has cleared
the way for a controversial mili
tary aid package for Somalia,
first proposed by the Carter ad
ministration and urged as part
of a generally expanded Ameri
can role in the Horn of Africa by
advisers to President-elect

Ronald Reagan, by determining
that no Somali troops are fight
ing in Ethiopia's contested
Ogaden region, U.S. officials
here said.
The determination, of which
Congress already has been in
formed, clears the Con
gressional restriction on a $40
million package of military sup
plies to be exchanged for U.S.
military use of Somali facil
ities.
The military supplies seem
likely to trigger complaints by
Somalia's hostile neighbors,
Kenya and Ethiopia, and in
volve the United States in the in
tractable dispute in the Horn of
Africa. The State Department
assessment on which the sup
plies depend was reached in the
last days of the Carter adminis
tration and has yet to be made
public.
The State Department de
termination was disclosed this

week by Rep. Clarence Long (D-
Md ), during a tour of Africa.
Long, chairman of a House sub
committee dealing with foreign
aid. said the department
notified him shortly before he
left on the trip last week.
The sensitivity of the move
was emphasized Friday when
the Somali Foreign Ministry
charged that Ethiopia has sta
tioned 100,000 troops, supported
by Soviet and Cuban advisers,
along the border and plans to in
vade northern Somalia to cap
ture the strategic port of
Berbera on the Gulf of Aden.
American military use of the
Berbera airport and harbor is
the key reason for the con
troversial agreement to provide
Somalia with arms. The in
stallations, originally built by
the Soviets before they switched
their support to Ethiopia in 1977,
are to be used by the newly de
veloped Rapid Deployment

Force to beef up U.S. military
presence in the Indian Ocean
following the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan.
The U.S. government signed
the arms-for-facilities agree
ment with Somalia last August,
but no military hardware has
been provided because Con
gress stipulated that the State
Department first had to give
"verified assurance" that there
were no Somali troops in the
mainly barren Ogaden area,
which is about the size of New
Mexico.
As late as last month. Ameri
can diplomats clearly still felt
there were Somali troops in the
area despite the country's
claims that the fighting was
being carried out by the
Western Somali Liberation
Front, a guerrilla organization
supported by Somalia.
