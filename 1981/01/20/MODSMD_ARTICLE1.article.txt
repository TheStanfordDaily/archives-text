# 'Last chance' compromise may free 52 today
## Key cash transfer issue resolved 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — With less than nine
hours left in office, President Jimmy
Carter accepted a "last chance" com
promise early this morning that was
intended to sweep away final ob
stacles blocking freedom for 52 U.S.
hostages, and he ordered that frozen
Iranian assets be moved into the Fed
eral Reserve — a key step toward re
turning the captives to their home
land.
White House Press Secretary Jody
Powell, who announced the develop
ments, said he did not know when the
hostages — held for 444 days — would
begin their flight to freedom.
"I do not know of any other prob
lems." Powell said in response to
questions after announcing that the
compromise wording had been ac
cepted by Carter to settle a dispute
over the fine-print in the agreement's
"transfer authority" section.
Three minutes after agreeing to the
new language, Carter had Secretary of
the Treasury G. William Miller issue
orders for the frozen Iranian assets
to begin to move into the Federal Re
serve" — the initial step toward even
tually placing the funds into an escrow
account in Iran's name in the Bank of
England.
The United States and Iran already
had signed the escrow agreement, but
the signatures of representatives of
the Federal Reserve, the Central
Bank of Algeria and the Bank of Eng

land still were required. These repre
sentatives were all in Algiers, and
Powell said that Carter telephoned the
chief U.S. negotiator there, Deputy
Secretary of State Warren Christ
opher. and told him to "move ahead as
rapidly as possible."
Once those three representatives
sign the escrow agreement, Powell
said, "the money in the Federal Re
serve can move into the escrow ac
count in the Bank of England, which
will be in the name of the Central Bank
of Algeria." Then, when the govern
ment of Algeria certifies that the mon
ey is in the escrow account, the
hostages should be freed, he said.
The rapid-fire developments came
after intensive efforts to resolve dis
putes over mechanics of implement
ing the complex accord initiated by
negotiators almost precisely 24 hours
earlier.
Powell said the compromise lan
guage was drafted by Iran's British
counsel and amounted to a "last
chance" to resolve the dispute.
The llth-hour snarl over the fine
print in the agreement had darkened
Carter's last hours in the White House,
and had overshadowed the series of
star-studded gala events on the eve of
Ronald Reagan's inauguration as
America's 40th president.
Iran's official Pars news agency
quoted Behzad Nabavi yesterday as
saying U.S. banks submitted an 11-
page appendix on future Iranian finan
cial claims, creating another problem
that postponed the end of the hostages'
14V2-month ordeal.
Nabavi said the banks submitted the
appendix "to make it binding on Iran
to drop any further claims beyond the
approximately $8 billion which are to
be escrowed in the British Central
Bank . . . Even with the utmost op
timism, this could only be viewed as
an underhanded maneuver for delay
ing the final solution of the problem,
especially after the U.S. president had
issued an order for releasing Iran's as
sets in the U.S. banks."
The delays forced Carter to abandon
a plan to fly to West Germany to greet
the hostages in the final hours of his
presidency.
A Tehran radio commentary sug
gested that in a final political snub to
Carter, the Iranians were delaying the

release to deprive Carter of a chance
to greet them as president.
The long drama seemed near a
climax when Carter announced before
dawn yesterday in the last full day of
his presidency that an agreement had
been reached and that he believed it
would lead to "the freedom of our
American hostages."
But the hours dragged on and Iran's
top hostage negotiator said the com
plex financial arrangements had not
been completed.
Countries around the world greeted
news of an agreement with relief that
the long ordeal for the hostages was
ending and with hope that Iran's in
ternational isolation might be eased.
But Nabavi made clear that resolu
tion of the hostage crisis would not
lead to immediate improvement in
U.S.-Iranian resolutions soured by the
Nov. 4.1979, seizure of the Americans
by Iranian militants, 14 months of ne
gotiations, American ecnomic pres
sure and the failed American attempt
last April to send commando teams to
rescue the captives.
Nabavi said on Tehran radio that,
"we managed to rub in the dirt the
nose of the world's biggest oppressor
and superpower" and forced the Unit
ed States'' to submit to the demands of
our Majlis (Parliament)."
He said "we know that the U.S. gov
ernment is hostile to our revolution
and will commit continuous plots
against it."
Tehran radio commented that
Carter's plan to greet the hostages in
Wiesbaden was an attempt "to derive
the last propaganda benefit" from the
hostage crisis. The radio said Carter
could not "engage in such clowning
acts" because he had to be present at
the inauguration in Washington "to
hand over his shameful office to his
successor."
The final agreement calls for the
United States to immediately return
about $5.2 billion in seized Iranian gold
and cash of the $8 to $9 billion in Ira
nian assets Carter ordered frozen af
ter the hostages were taken.
The U.S. also pledged not to in
tervene in Iranian affairs and to
freeze assets of the late shah and his
close relatives pending resolution of
the Iranian government's suits to ob
tain the wealth.

America's 40th president.
Iran's official Pars news agency
quoted Behzad Nabavi yesterday as
saying U.S. banks submitted an 11-
page appendix on future Iranian finan
cial claims, creating another problem
that postponed the end of the hostages'
14V2-month ordeal.
Nabavi said the banks submitted the
appendix "to make it binding on Iran
to drop any further claims beyond the
approximately $8 billion which are to
be escrowed in the British Central
Bank . . . Even with the utmost op
timism, this could only be viewed as
an underhanded maneuver for delay
ing the final solution of the problem,
especially after the U.S. president had
issued an order for releasing Iran's as
sets in the U.S. banks."
The delays forced Carter to abandon
a plan to fly to West Germany to greet
the hostages in the final hours of his
presidency.
A Tehran radio commentary sug
gested that in a final political snub to
Carter, the Iranians were delaying the

release to deprive Carter of a chance
to greet them as president.
The long drama seemed near a
climax when Carter announced before
dawn yesterday in the last full day of
his presidency that an agreement had
been reached and that he believed it
would lead to "the freedom of our
American hostages."
But the hours dragged on and Iran's
top hostage negotiator said the com
plex financial arrangements had not
been completed.
Countries around the world greeted
news of an agreement with relief that
the long ordeal for the hostages was
ending and with hope that Iran's in
ternational isolation might be eased.
But Nabavi made clear that resolu
tion of the hostage crisis would not
lead to immediate improvement in
U.S.-Iranian resolutions soured by the
Nov. 4.1979, seizure of the Americans
by Iranian militants, 14 months of ne
gotiations, American ecnomic pres
sure and the failed American attempt
last April to send commando teams to
rescue the captives.
Nabavi said on Tehran radio that,
"we managed to rub in the dirt the
nose of the world's biggest oppressor
and superpower" and forced the Unit
ed States'' to submit to the demands of
our Majlis (Parliament)."
He said "we know that the U.S. gov
ernment is hostile to our revolution
and will commit continuous plots
against it."
Tehran radio commented that
Carter's plan to greet the hostages in
Wiesbaden was an attempt "to derive
the last propaganda benefit" from the
hostage crisis. The radio said Carter
could not "engage in such clowning
acts" because he had to be present at
the inauguration in Washington "to
hand over his shameful office to his
successor."
The final agreement calls for the
United States to immediately return
about $5.2 billion in seized Iranian gold
and cash of the $8 to $9 billion in Ira
nian assets Carter ordered frozen af
ter the hostages were taken.
The U.S. also pledged not to in
tervene in Iranian affairs and to
freeze assets of the late shah and his
close relatives pending resolution of
the Iranian government's suits to ob
tain the wealth.

From the Daily wire services
Washington — With less than nine
hours left in office, President Jimmy
Carter accepted a "last chance" com
promise early this morning that was
intended to sweep away final ob
stacles blocking freedom for 52 U.S.
hostages, and he ordered that frozen
Iranian assets be moved into the Fed
eral Reserve — a key step toward re
turning the captives to their home
land.
White House Press Secretary Jody
Powell, who announced the develop
ments, said he did not know when the
hostages — held for 444 days — would
begin their flight to freedom.
"I do not know of any other prob
lems." Powell said in response to
questions after announcing that the
compromise wording had been ac
cepted by Carter to settle a dispute
over the fine-print in the agreement's
"transfer authority" section.
Three minutes after agreeing to the
new language, Carter had Secretary of
the Treasury G. William Miller issue
orders for the frozen Iranian assets
to begin to move into the Federal Re
serve" — the initial step toward even
tually placing the funds into an escrow
account in Iran's name in the Bank of
England.
The United States and Iran already
had signed the escrow agreement, but
the signatures of representatives of
the Federal Reserve, the Central
Bank of Algeria and the Bank of Eng

land still were required. These repre
sentatives were all in Algiers, and
Powell said that Carter telephoned the
chief U.S. negotiator there, Deputy
Secretary of State Warren Christ
opher. and told him to "move ahead as
rapidly as possible."
Once those three representatives
sign the escrow agreement, Powell
said, "the money in the Federal Re
serve can move into the escrow ac
count in the Bank of England, which
will be in the name of the Central Bank
of Algeria." Then, when the govern
ment of Algeria certifies that the mon
ey is in the escrow account, the
hostages should be freed, he said.
The rapid-fire developments came
after intensive efforts to resolve dis
putes over mechanics of implement
ing the complex accord initiated by
negotiators almost precisely 24 hours
earlier.
Powell said the compromise lan
guage was drafted by Iran's British
counsel and amounted to a "last
chance" to resolve the dispute.
The llth-hour snarl over the fine
print in the agreement had darkened
Carter's last hours in the White House,
and had overshadowed the series of
star-studded gala events on the eve of
Ronald Reagan's inauguration as
America's 40th president.
