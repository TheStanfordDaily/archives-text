"Pray to God and He will help
you." that sexist ploy of the 70s
and "Pray to God and She will
help you." the noveau faith of
the '80s were finally excluded
from the now complete Ameri
can Nouveau Neuter Nation
(NNN ) this Friday, as feminists

around the world united to
stamp our sexist words, phrases
and connotations. Literature,
history, and everyday ex
pressions world wide have been
rewritten to accommodate the
changing times. . . .
Shakespeare
Frailty thy name is thing.
You sulphurous and thought ex
ecuting fires
Vaunt couriers of oak cleaving
thunderbolts
Crack nature's moulds, all
germens spill at once
That makes ingrateful things.
Thing Lear
The Bible
The Thing hath cometh
On the sixth day, THING
created things and
THING said it was good.
On the third day, the Thing rose
again.

Colloquial everyday speech
Hey, Joe, here comes the
mailthing.
The Chairthing of the Board will
meet with us today.
Wanted: Salesthing, good pay.
Watch out, there's a thinghole
without a cover ahead.
Is God male, female or
hemaphroditic? Does it really
matter?
A group of Southern Califor
nia feminists is now debating
how to rewrite the Bible to
eliminate the 'heinous' over-sig
nificance of the word 'man.'
Let's think objectively for a mo
ment.
Of course, women have
played important roles in his
tory, but on the whole, the sum
of classical history until this
century has characterized wom
en by their biological roles as
childbearers. Aristotle, Plato,
the Bible, the Greek tragedies,
Saint Augustine, and even Saint
Paul described women as in
ferior and subordinate child
bearers. So why should we deny
history? Simply because pres
ent day norms are changing
does not mean that the tradi
tions and history of the past
should be modified.
Seemingly, if the things of to
day's generation (that includes
you too, things) understand that
things have been subjugated in
the past, then they will be more

receptive to the wants and de
sire of things today (that's you
things, not the other things).
Equality of opportunity should
be granted to things every
where. Pure equality is not pos
sible because all things are not
endowed with the same genetic
potential for learning, develop
ing and creating. And things of
both sexes (am I allowed to use
sexes?) are superior to other
things of both sexes.
As I see it, I have a right to use
my language as I wish. 'Person'
to me is a travesty. The obvious
oppressive, lust-filled connota
tion of "son" following person is
indicative of premeditated rape
(since son is obviously a heinous
connotation of white males, who
realize that they are superior at
birth). Per is another travesty
that is the nickname of Per
cival, the only knight of King
Arthur to view the Holy Grail,
an obvious male ego delusion.
Pe is unacceptable, the 17th let
ter of the Hebrew alphabet that
is unquestionably phallic.
Language and history are per
sonal matters and no radical
thinginists are going to tell me,
an ail-American red-blooded
thing who is proud that my thing
and my. thing s thing, and my
thing's thing's thing were born
in a land where all things are
created equal by THING. I know
the rights of thingkind. A thing
is a thing is a thing and denying
the heritage of anything to any
thing is a violation of thing
kind's principles handed to
thing by THING when things
were created!
