Clerical salaries
In your article on the prob
lems facing secretaries at Stan
ford (Daily, Jan. 15), it was men
tioned that Stanford gives merit
increases to the clerical staff,
and that these increases are
often more than 10 percent. I
feel an important point was un
deremphasized. In parentheses,
you stated that these merit re
views occur "after six initial
stages of not more than a year
each." In fact, the total length
of time needed to progress
through these stages is five to
six years. This means that sec
retaries are employed here at
Stanford five or six years before
they can qualify for a merit in
crease.
These 10 percent raises are
nice, but the fact that per
formance reviews (with subse
quent salary adjustments) are
simply not available until after
one has worked here for at least
five years makes a mockery of
Stanford's claim of merit in
creases for clerical staff. One
must go through all six steps
first, at an average rate of nine
months to on year per step.
There is a raise given at each

step, but it is 2 percent, not 10.
As Bryant mentioned later in
the article, this is indeed an in
sult to employees. It is especial
ly frustrating that these in
creases are given across the
board, with no opportunity for
good individual performance to
be recognized.
Stanford University has sev
eral ideas about clerical work
ers that must change before
they can hope to lower their
turnover rate or decrease their
number of openings in the secre
tarial field. The policy of no
merit reviews for five years is a
major fault, but is only a small
part of a larger problem. The
next few months should prove to
be enlightening as the OSOC
publicizes more details of the
reasons for dissatisfaction
among secretaries at Stanford.

King holiday
At the recent lunchtime rally
marking the birthday of Dr.
Martin Luther King, one of the
speakers made an eloquent and
moving speech calling upon the
administration to designate
January 15 as a University holi

day. Such a decision would place
Stanford at the crest of a grow
ing movement to designate this
day as a national holiday com
memorating Dr. King's life and
work. This is an idea whose time
has clearly come. Second per
haps only to avoiding the pros
pect of thermonuclear annihila
tion. the healing of America's
racial wounds borne from its
slaveholding and oppressive
heritage is the primary moral
imperative facing this nation as
it enters its third century.
The declaration of a public
holiday — the suspension of
"business as usual and focusing
our time and attention on the
meaning and implications of Dr.
King's message — is a small but
significant step towards ac
knowledging our society's need
to address itself to rectifying its
racial injustices. I call on the
University to take this recom
mendation to heart, and to add
its voice and influence to recog
nizing the pressing need for indi
viduals and society to move
towards the realization of
King's dream.
