# Diverse menu, more casual atmosphere characterize eatery
## Encina Station reports increase of sales, students 
### Diane Johnson 
A cozy, clean atmosphere,
soft background music and qual
ity food, all at a low price —
these are the aims of Encina
Station, Servomation's "other"
campus eatery, said managers
Mike Moran and Joh
Tolchinsky.
In the past, the Station,
tucked away in Encina Com
mons, has suffered from student
"lack of awareness," but Moran
and Tolchinsky are working to
change that. Since June, 1980,
they been trying to "bring stu
dents back into the place," with
changes including upgraded
quality and selection of food, de
creased prices, expanded hours

and a more casual atmosphere,
complete with a pool table, dart
board, video game, and large
screen TV.
The managers said they are
pleased with the success
achieved so far. According to
Tolchinsky, sales have surged
150 percent since last June and
student representation at the
Station has doubled.
Because of a lack of funds,
most of the Station's new look
was donated, Tolchinsky said.
The Stanford Archives donated
murals displayed on the walls;
the Athletic Department
furnished a Stanford flag, and
Tolchinskv's brother made
redwood plant hangers, all to

create an "old-style hofbrau"
appearance.
Tolchinsky said he wants the
Station to be "receptive to eve
rybody's wants and needs in
stead of a single group of peo
ple." He contrasted the restau
rant with the Coffee House and
the Transition, other University
eateries, and said that while the
two of them both have distinct
moods, Encina Station hopes to
accomodate both rowdy and
quiet moods.
Dave Jordon. Food Service
director, said the goal of the re
vised Encina Station is "to turn
it from a cafeteria into a pub.
He said he hopes to add a bar
sometime in the near future.

Jordon said in ordf j r to be
more responsive to campus stu
dent desires, he has hired com
munations major Art Stein as a
"p r. person." Stoin helps Jor
don decide what functions and
attractions would be most ap
pealing to students
Special events U the Station
include senior and graduate pub
nights where beer, wine, and
food items are offered at a dis
count. and last quarter, live en
tertainment on Friday nights,
Jordan said. Tolchinsky said he

hopes the next step will be the
addition of a quality sound sys
tem and a rug to make the res
taurant better acoustically.
New food additions include
breakfast and a pizza menu
Part of Moran's and
Tolchinsky's strategy for in
creasing customer turnout in
volves offering lunch, dinner
and beverage specials. Last
quarter, chicken teriyaki and
vegetable quiche, received fa
vorable comments, said
Tolchinskv.
