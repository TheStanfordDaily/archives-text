# Rubik's Cube Club: to solve or solve not
## 
### Kersten Meier 
Eleven Stanford students
have been seized by "Cube
fever " No. it's not that nasty
fly or a new Travolta-like dance
craze; rather it's a condition of
people who like to solve puzzles!
The puzzle they work with,
called Rubik's Cube, has sold
more than four million copies
throughout world. The cube,
which consists of 26 subcubes,
has three layers in every
dimension which can be turned.
When the cube is purchased,
each of the six surfaces shows a
different color, then the cube is
mixed up and the puzzler tries to
rearrange it.
WARNING:," says an ad
vertisement for the cube, "don't
touch it. You can't get rid of it!"
Judging by the enthusiasm the
two founders of the "Stan
ford Rubik's Cube Club,"the
warning appears to have validi
ty.
The club's basic objective is
to help puzzlers restore the
cube. More advanced objectives
are to find faster and easier
solution systems and to design
and build similar puzzles.
In dealing with the cube, vari
ous sciences may be used. From
mathematics one can use group
theory, graph theory and com
binatorics. When programming
a solution system on the com
puter one has to consider
43252.00327.44898,56000 different
cube patterns. Even to store
only a fraction of them efficient
ly one must apply computer sci
ence techniques

If a new system to restore the
cube is found, making sure that
a human brain can memorize it
would be a major concern. For
this to occur, information theo
ry and psychology are neces
sary. In order to design and
build new puzzles engineering
skills are needed.

Play with the cube allows the
creation of aesthetically pleas
ing patterns. A simple one
shows a dot in the center of each
face. Imagination sets almost
no limits on finding new pat
terns.
Several articles and booklets
have been written about the
cube. Puzzlers all over the
world exchange solutions. In
Hungary fans compete in
"speed puzzling." In Germany a
Rubik's cube club plans a cham- '
pionship this summer.

Cube Club meets every Thurs
