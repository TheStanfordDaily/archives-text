## A 						whopping big exhibit of 18th Century Italian prints 
### Angle Davis 
The glories of 18th century Italian
printmaking are currently featured in
the exhibition which opened Decem
ber 16 at the Stanford Art Gallery and
continues through March 2. The ex
hibition includes prints from some 45
artists, including Canaleto, Piranesi,
and Tiepolo. Most of the pieces have
been lent from the private collection
of Mr. and Mrs. Marcus Sopher.
Stanford Museum of Art Director
and Art Department Chairman Lorenz
Eitner writes in the catalogue accom
panying the exhibition that it was the
ambition of the late Marcus Sopher
to offer a historical survey of Italian
prints from 1500 to 1800. "history vis
ualised in art â€” he wished to share

with others."
The first exhibition, dedicated to
the 16th century, was held in Berkeley
and later at Pomona College. The suc
cess of this first exhibition was fol
lowed by the 17th century exhibition
which was shown in 1978 at Stanford
and will travel to Oberlin, Princeton,
and Cornell.
Mr. Sopher's untimely death oc
curred at this time. With the consent
of Mrs. Sopher. however, his plan has
been realized. Professor Claudia
Lazzaro. a former Stanford faculty
member now at Cornell, directed the
current exhibition.
According to docent Eleanor
Cabral, the 18th century was a peri
od of tremendous change and unrest

for Italy. Foreign invasions which
were eventually subdued by Napolean
created a sort of "fractured culture."
The situation was not without implica
tions for art: artists wandered, pa
tronages changed, and German and
English tourists began flocking to Ita
ly, eager to purchase art objects for
themselves. An advantage of the print
was its capacity for reproduction.
The prints themselves, as Professor
Lazzaro points out in the catalogue,
reflect a trend in art of the time: "the
interest in the polarity of fantasy and
reality, of dreamy visions of imagined
places."
The detailed landscapes of
Canaletto. a Venetian, date from the
first half of the 18th century and dis-

play interests in both provincial sub
ject matter and the imaginative, if not
the purely fantastical. His Landscape
with Five Bridges is worth noting not
only for the control and precision re
vealed in his technique, but also for
the provocative quality of the scene
itself: where are the five bridges?
The Roman Piranesi, a contem
porary of Canaletto, was trained as an
architect and sought through his dra
matic and complex reproductions of
ancient ruins to challenge the medi
ocrity of the architecture of his time.
Also included in the exhibition are
prints from Piranesi's Carceri, a 14-
plate series of prison scenes which
was issued originally around 1745 un
der the title of Capricious Inventions

of Prisons. Piranesi later reworked
the plates, adding striking torture in
struments, chains and the like to the
previously almost bare chambers. In
1761 the prints were reissued and
Piranesi changed the title to Prisons of
Invention.
Fantasy plays an important role in
the Vari Capricci and the Scherzi di
Fantasia of the Venetian Battista
Tiepolo.
A 10-print series, the Capricci
presents characters confronting a per
sonified death who is far more intrigu
ing than fearful. The series was ori
ginally published in 1743 by Anton
Zanetti who is represented in the ex
hibition by his chiaroscuro woodcuts.
In the Scherzi of Tiepolo, themes

similar to those of the Capricci are de
picted, but the portrayals of mag
icians and occult rituals suggest a new
fascination with the exotic and give to
the scenes a mood different from that
of the thematically "traditional"
Capricci.
Giambattista's son, Giandomenico
Tiepolo is represented in the exhibi
tion by prints from his Flight into
Egypt series.
The Art Gallery is open Tuesday
