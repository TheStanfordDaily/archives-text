# The 						Formula: cynical, depressing and lousy
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Steve Shagan, who adapted his bestselling novel The
Formula to the screen, is a cynical-depressive writer,
and the tone of his work is just a veneer that puts a shine
on the con job. In Save the Tiger, which he wrote and
produced eight years ago, his hero, Harry Stoner, was a
Willy Loman-like garment manufacturer (played by
Jack Lemmon) who pimped for his customers and
plotted to burn down his business for the insurance
money; Stoner was morally bankrupt, but Shagan set
him up as a sympathetic hero whose actions were his
only recourse in a rotten society. The movie was a hit
because it pandered to the popular nostalgia for an
earlier, happier time: Stoner was puzzled by the cold
new America he was living in. But he — and the movie
— refused to see his role in the creation of that Ameri
ca.
In The Formula, it's not just America that is rotten
but the whole world, and there isn't a damn thing that
the Last Moral Man (Police Lieutenant Barney Kane,
played by George C. Scott) can do about it. In this mix
ture of The China Syndrome and Marathon Man, Kane
is trying to track down the murderer of his pal, a
former cop who retired to the more comfortable world
of cocaine dealing, and he finds that the killing is linked

to a plot to secure a Nazi-originated formula for the
manufacture of cheap synthetic fuel. The men at the
top. of course, want to withhold the formula from the
public so that they can make a huge profit on it when it
is most desperately needed. Shagan isn't a deep thinker
but he is good at striking faddish, skeptical poses.
Shagan conveniently dates the corruption of the
world as beginning at the end of World War II: in the
opening sequence, an American officer tells a German
general who has surrendered to him, "From now on the
world is going to be just one big, happy family. No more
secrets, no enemies, just customers." The Formula
itself, like Save the Tiger, is a piece of salesmanship,
and the product — the unredeemable lousiness of just
about everybody — makes a viewer queasy. You feel a
little less clean as you emerge from it.
The theme is all in this picture; Shagan is a poor con
structor of narrative and his method of telling all his
plot secrets before they begin to operate kills the sus
pense. We know, for example, that the young German
woman (Marthe Keller, who seems to be a staple of this
sort of thriller) is a plant even before Kane sleeps with
her, and the corporation chief (Marlon Brando) estab
lishes his complicity in his second scene.
Since there is no excitement, and since all the char

acters except for Xane are pretty much equally
tainted, we don't care which ones are eliminated — and
in fact, long before the end, most of the shady German
figures seem to merge into one omnipresent evil mass.
Actors can't do much with this kind of material, but
Brando, who wears a thin white wig and a hearing aid
and speaks in a midwestern accent — he looks and
sounds like something out of Sinclair Lewis — is funny,
and John Gielgud has five entertainingly hammy
minutes as a proud German scientist. Scott seems to
have patented that care-creased brow; his brooding
presence may become a liability in movies if he doesn't
do some real acting soon. Beatrice Straight and G.D.
Spradlin are also in the film, but they are killed off ear
ly — no great loss.
Shagan and the director, John Avildsen who is usual
ly a crowd pleaser (he made Joe and Rocky as well as
Save the Tiger), may have miscalculated with this
movie. The audience I saw it with did not respond well
to it; if I read their reactions correctly, they were both
bored and oppressed by it. Audiences applaud the
mawkish Resurrection, with its characters out of Stein
beck and its 1930 s Hollywood uplifting ending, because
it makes them feel good; you walk out of The Formula
with less then you had when you walked in.

plotted to burn down his business for the insurance
money; Stoner was morally bankrupt, but Shagan set
him up as a sympathetic hero whose actions were his
only recourse in a rotten society. The movie was a hit
because it pandered to the popular nostalgia for an
earlier, happier time: Stoner was puzzled by the cold
new America he was living in. But he — and the movie
— refused to see his role in the creation of that Ameri
ca.
In The Formula, it's not just America that is rotten
but the whole world, and there isn't a damn thing that
the Last Moral Man (Police Lieutenant Barney Kane,
played by George C. Scott) can do about it. In this mix
ture of The China Syndrome and Marathon Man, Kane
is trying to track down the murderer of his pal, a
former cop who retired to the more comfortable world
of cocaine dealing, and he finds that the killing is linked

to a plot to secure a Nazi-originated formula for the
manufacture of cheap synthetic fuel. The men at the
top. of course, want to withhold the formula from the
public so that they can make a huge profit on it when it
is most desperately needed. Shagan isn't a deep thinker
but he is good at striking faddish, skeptical poses.
Shagan conveniently dates the corruption of the
world as beginning at the end of World War II: in the
opening sequence, an American officer tells a German
general who has surrendered to him, "From now on the
world is going to be just one big, happy family. No more
secrets, no enemies, just customers." The Formula
itself, like Save the Tiger, is a piece of salesmanship,
and the product — the unredeemable lousiness of just
about everybody — makes a viewer queasy. You feel a
little less clean as you emerge from it.
The theme is all in this picture; Shagan is a poor con
structor of narrative and his method of telling all his
plot secrets before they begin to operate kills the sus
pense. We know, for example, that the young German
woman (Marthe Keller, who seems to be a staple of this
sort of thriller) is a plant even before Kane sleeps with
her, and the corporation chief (Marlon Brando) estab
lishes his complicity in his second scene.
Since there is no excitement, and since all the char

acters except for Xane are pretty much equally
tainted, we don't care which ones are eliminated — and
in fact, long before the end, most of the shady German
figures seem to merge into one omnipresent evil mass.
Actors can't do much with this kind of material, but
Brando, who wears a thin white wig and a hearing aid
and speaks in a midwestern accent — he looks and
sounds like something out of Sinclair Lewis — is funny,
and John Gielgud has five entertainingly hammy
minutes as a proud German scientist. Scott seems to
have patented that care-creased brow; his brooding
presence may become a liability in movies if he doesn't
do some real acting soon. Beatrice Straight and G.D.
Spradlin are also in the film, but they are killed off ear
ly — no great loss.
Shagan and the director, John Avildsen who is usual
ly a crowd pleaser (he made Joe and Rocky as well as
Save the Tiger), may have miscalculated with this
movie. The audience I saw it with did not respond well
to it; if I read their reactions correctly, they were both
bored and oppressed by it. Audiences applaud the
mawkish Resurrection, with its characters out of Stein
beck and its 1930 s Hollywood uplifting ending, because
it makes them feel good; you walk out of The Formula
with less then you had when you walked in.
