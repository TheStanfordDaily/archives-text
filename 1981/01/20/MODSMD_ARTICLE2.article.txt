# Profs, Iranian students comment on deal
## 
### Brad Crystal 
Although the 14-month vigil over the
hostages appears to have come to an
end, U.S. political analysts and Ira
nian citizens will be commenting on
the implications of the ordeal for a
long time to come.
At Stanford, two resident
diplomatic scholars expressed a mix
ture of praise and criticism for the
way the United States handled the
crisis, while several Iranian students
reacted to the apparent settlement
with relief.
History Prof. Gordon Craig and Po
litical Science Prof. Alexander
George both gave the State Depart
ment officials high marks for their
conduct of diplomacy during the final,
critical stages of negotiation.
But they also suggested that the
Carter administration mismanaged
the situation in the early stages fol
lowing the embassy takeover.
Craig and George are currently
teaching an International Relations
course entitled "The Diplomatic Rev
olution of our Time. "
'Reasonable proposition'
George called the settlement a
"quite reasonable proposition that
does not give either side an unfair ad
vantage.
"I don't see any evidence that we
have been unduly generous," he said,
noting that the frozen assets to be re
turned represent Iranian holdings
only.
The agreement should result in a re
turn to "the status quo ante," i.e., the
situation as it was before the hostages
were taken in November 1979, George
said.
Craig, while noting that the settle
ment benefits both parties, pointed
out that Iran is not "being forced to
pay for violating international law and

holding our hostages."
With respect to the round-the-clock
discussions in Algeria that led to the
agreement, George said they con
stituted a "triumph of classical pro
fessional diplomacy."
Good luck
He commended the Carter adminis
tration for seizing the opportunity to
take advantage of "two unexpected
elements of good luck."
The first of these, he said, was the
Iraqi attack on Iran which forced the
Iranians to "sober up" and regain per
spective.
The second element was the elec
tion of Ronald Reagan and the fear it
inspired among Iranian leaders.
Reagan's hard-line statements may
have helped catalyze the agreement,
according to George. Those remarks
were "just threatening enough to rein
force the message that it's not a good
idea to wait."
While commending the diplomatic
precision exercised by Deputy Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher,
Craig and George did not hesitate to
deride the hesitation of the Carter ad
ministration's inital response to the
crisis.
Real question
"The real question for historians"
in assessing the crisis will be "Was it
mismanaged at the very beginning?"
according to Craig.
Both Craig and George seemed to
concur that the Carter administration
overreacted; that by attaching so
much importance to the embassy
takeover, the administration set itself
up for a fall.
"There is some justice to the
criticism that this thing should have
been played down instead of being
elevated as a challenge to the national
honor." according to George.

"Carter and his people encouraged
a jingoistic response on the part of the
man in the street," he remarked.
By inflating the crisis beyond its
natural proportions, Craig added, the
United States "suffered in prestige
and in the general disruption of our
foreign policy."
Craig and George both expressed
caution in their assessment of future
Iran-U.S. relations.
In Craig's view, Iran's strategic
position in the Middle East under
scores the need to revive diplomatic
relations, but he doubts there is
"much chance of restoring close ties.
"This incident will long be remem
bered," he said.
First step
George called the hostage settle
ment a possible "first step toward an
eventual rapprochement with the Ira
nians," although he added he does not
foresee this "happening right away."
Two of four Iranian students here
contacted by the Daily yesterday said
a return to full diplomatic ties would
be in the best interests of both nations.
"I tend to think that the (freeing of
the hostages) is a sign by itself that we
are trying to normalize our rela
tions." said Majid Riaziat, a graduate
student in applied physics.
Another Iranian student, who asked
not to be named, said the fact that the
agreement includes a provision to lift
U.S. trade sanctions against Iran sig
nals a movement toward improved
ties.
All four students said they were
greatly relived that an agreement had
been struck.
Riaziat said Iran "did not gain any
thing" by taking the hostages.
He said the bad feelings between the
two countries would make it difficult

to "reestablish the status quo before
the hostages were taken.
"In general I think Iran should not
have taken the hostages," Riaziat
said.
' 'Once they did. they should have re
leased them as a soon as the main
cause (of Iranian bitterness) — the
shah — left the country. . . . Keeping
the hostages beyond that point was
just stupid."
But other Iranians were less critical
of their country's actions.
