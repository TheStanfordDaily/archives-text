# 999 dishes up the worst EP in sport
## 
### David Lyon 
999 s latest EP, The Biggest Tour in Sport, is entertaining
but unjustified. The full-sized disc's first side has but one four
minute song. Yes, the song, "Homicide," is superlative, but
the studio version on their first LP, High Energy Plan, is
more distinct. The second side has five songs; one from their
first, the other four from their second album, The Biggest
Prize in Sport.
These two albums are exemplary, especially the first. 999's
music has a simplicity worthy of Quaker furniture of Oriental
Religions, and lends some dignity to the tired old goat of
genre: rock and roll. The tunes are engaging, the lyrics wit
ty,and the decadence honest.
The EP, however, has no determinable purpose: aside
from some stray, and singularly uninteresting, crowd noises,
and one or two songs' greater vitality, the live recording sim
ply struggles with the difficulties of all live recordings.
Unless it's cheap, or the only 999 you'll buy, this EP is
worth no consideration.
