Capitol readies for inaguration
Washington— The nation's capital was dressed up and
primed yesterday to celebrate two history-making events:
the end of the hostage drama and the beginning of Ronald
Reagan's term as president of the United States.
For the 39th president, Jimmy Carter, the heralded re
turn of 52 countrymen brought suspense, excitement, and
some uplift to his last hours in office.
An unforeseen delay in that operation also brought
Carter his first job after he gives up the reins of govern
ment today: Reagan will send him to Wiesbaden, West
Germany, as the official representative of the United
States to greet the freed captives.
Carter had hoped to make that trip as president but the
delay made that untenable. There would not be time to
make the trip and still be at the Capitol at noon today to
watch his successor's swearing-in.
The Reagans will begin their day today at services in St.
John's Episcopal Church — nicknamed the Church of the
Presidents — across Lafayette Square from the White
House.
Chrysler loan gets early OK
Washington— The government, trying to prevent the
collapse of Chrysler Corp., gave preliminary approval
yesterday to an additional $400 million in federal loan
guarantees for the nation's third-largest auto maker.

The emergency aid, extended on the final working day of
President Carter's administration, got a quiet blessing
from Donald Regan, the incoming secretary of the Treas
ury.
The Chrysler Loan depends on another round of costly
concessions to the troubled company from its bankers,
suppliers and members of the United Auto Workers.
In Detroit, the UAW's 250-member Chrysler council rec
ommended that the latest $622 million worth of contract
concessions be approved by 65,000 Chrysler workers in the
United States and Canada as well as 45,000 others now on
layoff.
Under the survival plan, virtually dictated by the gov
ernment board, a total of 123 banks and other lenders
would take about half of the company's long-term debt of
$1,009,000,000 in the form of Chrysler preferred stock. The
other half of the debt would be written off at 30 cents on the
dollar.
Haig tape request rejected
Washington— The head of the National Archives said
yesterday that he had decided to reject a Senate subpoena
for confidential logs of tape-recorded conversations be
tween Alexander Haig and then-President Richard Nixon
in 1973.
In a letter to Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.), chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee, Archivist Robert
Warner acknowledged that his latest position differs from
one he adopted last Monday in testifying before the panel.

The committee has recommended Haig's confirmation as
secretary of State by a vote of 15 to 2.
Warner noted in his letter that the committee no longer
needs the Watergate-era materials in order to act on
Haig's confirmation. Thus, he said, the panel "is exercis
ing far more general areas of inquiry, the ultimate
purposes of which are uncertain, open-ended and
speculative."
Troubled Itel files for bankruptcy
San Francisco— Listing debts of approximately $1.61
billion to bOOO creditors, Itel Corp. today filed for financial
reorganization in federal bankruptcy court.
The company listed assets of $1.1 billion as of Sept. 30
The filing, under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy laws,
would allow the San Francisco leasing firm to be protected
by courts from creditors' lawsuits while it continues to op
erate and tries to work out a plan to pay its debts.
The filing followed an emergency meeting of the com
pany's board of directors Friday, during which the direc
tors determined that they could not reorganize the com
pany's debts without the court protection.
Dutch sub sale angers China
Beijing— Angered by the Netherlands' sale of two sub
marines to Taiwan, China told the Dutch yesterday that it
was reducing the level of their diplomatic relations from

that of ambassador to charge d'affaires.
The sale and the Dutch refusal to reconsider it, the Chi
nese Foreign Ministry said in a blunt note, have "under
mined the basis on which China and the Netherlands estab
lished diplomatic relations on the ambassadorial level":
Dutch acceptance of Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.
In an admonition directed as much toward the incoming
Reagan administration as to the Netherlands, the Foreign
Ministry declared, "Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chi
na's sacred territory, (and) the correct attitude of a coun
try on the question of Taiwan has always been an impor
tant prerequisite for the establishment of diplomatic rela
tions between China and that country."
Hostage doubt unsettles Market
New York— Stock prices moved narrowly yesterday as
last-minute snags developed in the agreement to free the
American hostages held in Iran.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up for
most of the afternoon, ended with a drop of 2.30 to 970.99 as
declines and advances were almost even among New York
Stock Exchange issues.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy with a chance of showers tonight. Lows in
the mid 40's to low 50's. High in the 60 s.

ury.
The Chrysler Loan depends on another round of costly
concessions to the troubled company from its bankers,
suppliers and members of the United Auto Workers.
In Detroit, the UAW's 250-member Chrysler council rec
ommended that the latest $622 million worth of contract
concessions be approved by 65,000 Chrysler workers in the
United States and Canada as well as 45,000 others now on
layoff.
Under the survival plan, virtually dictated by the gov
ernment board, a total of 123 banks and other lenders
would take about half of the company's long-term debt of
$1,009,000,000 in the form of Chrysler preferred stock. The
other half of the debt would be written off at 30 cents on the
dollar.
Haig tape request rejected
Washington— The head of the National Archives said
yesterday that he had decided to reject a Senate subpoena
for confidential logs of tape-recorded conversations be
tween Alexander Haig and then-President Richard Nixon
in 1973.
In a letter to Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.), chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee, Archivist Robert
Warner acknowledged that his latest position differs from
one he adopted last Monday in testifying before the panel.

The committee has recommended Haig's confirmation as
secretary of State by a vote of 15 to 2.
Warner noted in his letter that the committee no longer
needs the Watergate-era materials in order to act on
Haig's confirmation. Thus, he said, the panel "is exercis
ing far more general areas of inquiry, the ultimate
purposes of which are uncertain, open-ended and
speculative."
Troubled Itel files for bankruptcy
San Francisco— Listing debts of approximately $1.61
billion to bOOO creditors, Itel Corp. today filed for financial
reorganization in federal bankruptcy court.
The company listed assets of $1.1 billion as of Sept. 30
The filing, under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy laws,
would allow the San Francisco leasing firm to be protected
by courts from creditors' lawsuits while it continues to op
erate and tries to work out a plan to pay its debts.
The filing followed an emergency meeting of the com
pany's board of directors Friday, during which the direc
tors determined that they could not reorganize the com
pany's debts without the court protection.
Dutch sub sale angers China
Beijing— Angered by the Netherlands' sale of two sub
marines to Taiwan, China told the Dutch yesterday that it
was reducing the level of their diplomatic relations from

that of ambassador to charge d'affaires.
The sale and the Dutch refusal to reconsider it, the Chi
nese Foreign Ministry said in a blunt note, have "under
mined the basis on which China and the Netherlands estab
lished diplomatic relations on the ambassadorial level":
Dutch acceptance of Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan.
In an admonition directed as much toward the incoming
Reagan administration as to the Netherlands, the Foreign
Ministry declared, "Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chi
na's sacred territory, (and) the correct attitude of a coun
try on the question of Taiwan has always been an impor
tant prerequisite for the establishment of diplomatic rela
tions between China and that country."
Hostage doubt unsettles Market
New York— Stock prices moved narrowly yesterday as
last-minute snags developed in the agreement to free the
American hostages held in Iran.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up for
most of the afternoon, ended with a drop of 2.30 to 970.99 as
declines and advances were almost even among New York
Stock Exchange issues.
Today's Weather

Capitol readies for inaguration
Washington— The nation's capital was dressed up and
primed yesterday to celebrate two history-making events:
the end of the hostage drama and the beginning of Ronald
Reagan's term as president of the United States.
For the 39th president, Jimmy Carter, the heralded re
turn of 52 countrymen brought suspense, excitement, and
some uplift to his last hours in office.
An unforeseen delay in that operation also brought
Carter his first job after he gives up the reins of govern
ment today: Reagan will send him to Wiesbaden, West
Germany, as the official representative of the United
States to greet the freed captives.
Carter had hoped to make that trip as president but the
delay made that untenable. There would not be time to
make the trip and still be at the Capitol at noon today to
watch his successor's swearing-in.
The Reagans will begin their day today at services in St.
John's Episcopal Church — nicknamed the Church of the
Presidents — across Lafayette Square from the White
House.
Chrysler loan gets early OK
Washington— The government, trying to prevent the
collapse of Chrysler Corp., gave preliminary approval
yesterday to an additional $400 million in federal loan
guarantees for the nation's third-largest auto maker.

The emergency aid, extended on the final working day of
President Carter's administration, got a quiet blessing
from Donald Regan, the incoming secretary of the Treas
ury.
