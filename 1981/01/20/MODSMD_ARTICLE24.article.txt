# Hostages may suffer delayed-reaction damages
## 
### 
From the Los Angeles Times
During the first few days of freedom
for the 52 American hostages, neither
their families nor the public should
take what they say or do at face value,
experts warn.
. Their behavior and mood, whether
euphoric or withdrawn, during the
coming weeks is not likely to be typi
cal of their long-term adjustment.
The excitement of being free at last
and reunited with those they love may
mask or delay the stressful effects of

more than 14 months of captivity, a
psychiatrist who examined Army
prisoners of war after their release
from Vietnam cautioned.
"They could look good at first," the
psychiatrist. Dr. Saul Faerstein of Los
Angeles said, "and then blow their
brains out six weeks later."
Conversely, initial signs of being de
pressed or "zombie-like" could disap
pear over the next few months, ex
perts say.
The full impact of the stress they

have endured could take weeks,
months, even years to surface, say
those who have studied POWs, concen
tration camp survivors and previous
hostages. Therefore, first reports of
their mental and physcial condition —
good or bad — will not mean much.
For example, one black Marine re
leased by Iran in November 1979, after
only two weeks of captivity, at first
felt well, looked well, and was judged
to be well. Psychiatrists and physi
cians gave him — and the 12 other
women and blacks released then — a
clean bill of health.
But several months later he started
having nightmares. His ability to con
centrate began to fail, and he found
himself brooding about those still
being held. He began to withdraw
from contact with others.
Apparently, his case was not fol
lowed up and he was not treated by
government doctors. He finally sought
psychiatric help on his own last month
after learning through the news media
that his symptoms pointed to a de
layed psychological reaction much
like the stress reactions now common
among veterans of the Vietnam War.
The hostages' mood and mental
state could change drastically in the
coming weeks, according to Navy
Capt. Richard Rahe, director of
clinical services at the Naval Re
gional Medical Center in Long Beach,
Calif., and a key member of the
hostage recovery team.
For this reason, members of the
team of psychiatrists, psychologists

and social workers who will meet the
hostages in Wiesbaden, West Germa
ny to examine, test and try to smooth
their readjustment hope that — what
ever their initial findings — the 52 will
be examined again later and offered
treatment if necessary.
A three-month follow-up and reu
nion has already been planned, and the
mental health professionals say they
hope the group will be followed at one
year intervals for at least five years.
Such a plan would be up to the State
and Defense departments, which em
ploy all but two of the hostages.
The team doesn't expect to find any
gross signs of mental illness, the team
leader and State Department medical
director, Dr. Jerome Korcak, said.
His reasoning is that anyone who had
become visibly psychotic would have
been released earlier, as was hostage
Richard Queen when he developed
symptoms of what turned out to be
multiple sclerosis.
What they do expect to find, how
ever, is a wide range of responses in
the captives — a mixed group who in
clude 21 military men, 29 State De
partment employees and 2 civilians,
men and women ranging in age from
20 to 64 and who are drawn from wide
ly different backgrounds.
The reactions they expect, accord
ing to hostage and POW expert L. J.
West, a former military psychiatrist
who is now chairman of UCLA's de
partment of psychiatry and
biobehavioral sciences, include:
— Sleeplessness, nightmares, jit

ters, shakes and tremors; overreact
ing to sudden noises; poor appetite;
emotional instability; and inability to
concentrate. These are character
istics of what psychiatrists call classi
cal traumatic neurosis, what was
called shell shock in World War I and
combat fatigue in World War 11.
— A sort of numbness or inability to
feel things strongly, either because
the capacity to feel is worn out or the
defenses against it are increased as a
protection from suffering. This condi
tion, which is usually referred to as
the "survivor syndrome," leaves a
person seemingly remote and without
normal feelings after being released.
— Physical symptoms such as high
blood pressure, ulcers, headaches,
neuro-muscular tension syndromes or
even complete losses of certain body
functions (called "conversion" reac
tions ) because the mental distress is
"converted" to bodily problems.

combat fatigue in World War 11.
— A sort of numbness or inability to
feel things strongly, either because
the capacity to feel is worn out or the
defenses against it are increased as a
protection from suffering. This condi
tion, which is usually referred to as
the "survivor syndrome," leaves a
person seemingly remote and without
normal feelings after being released.
— Physical symptoms such as high
blood pressure, ulcers, headaches,
neuro-muscular tension syndromes or
even complete losses of certain body
functions (called "conversion" reac
tions ) because the mental distress is
"converted" to bodily problems.
From the Los Angeles Times
During the first few days of freedom
for the 52 American hostages, neither
their families nor the public should
take what they say or do at face value,
experts warn.
. Their behavior and mood, whether
euphoric or withdrawn, during the
coming weeks is not likely to be typi
cal of their long-term adjustment.
The excitement of being free at last
and reunited with those they love may
mask or delay the stressful effects of

more than 14 months of captivity, a
psychiatrist who examined Army
prisoners of war after their release
from Vietnam cautioned.
"They could look good at first," the
psychiatrist. Dr. Saul Faerstein of Los
Angeles said, "and then blow their
brains out six weeks later."
Conversely, initial signs of being de
pressed or "zombie-like" could disap
pear over the next few months, ex
perts say.
The full impact of the stress they

have endured could take weeks,
months, even years to surface, say
those who have studied POWs, concen
tration camp survivors and previous
hostages. Therefore, first reports of
their mental and physcial condition —
good or bad — will not mean much.
For example, one black Marine re
leased by Iran in November 1979, after
only two weeks of captivity, at first
felt well, looked well, and was judged
to be well. Psychiatrists and physi
cians gave him — and the 12 other
women and blacks released then — a
clean bill of health.
But several months later he started
having nightmares. His ability to con
centrate began to fail, and he found
himself brooding about those still
being held. He began to withdraw
from contact with others.
Apparently, his case was not fol
lowed up and he was not treated by
government doctors. He finally sought
psychiatric help on his own last month
after learning through the news media
that his symptoms pointed to a de
layed psychological reaction much
like the stress reactions now common
among veterans of the Vietnam War.
The hostages' mood and mental
state could change drastically in the
coming weeks, according to Navy
Capt. Richard Rahe, director of
clinical services at the Naval Re
gional Medical Center in Long Beach,
Calif., and a key member of the
hostage recovery team.
For this reason, members of the
team of psychiatrists, psychologists

and social workers who will meet the
hostages in Wiesbaden, West Germa
ny to examine, test and try to smooth
their readjustment hope that — what
ever their initial findings — the 52 will
be examined again later and offered
treatment if necessary.
A three-month follow-up and reu
nion has already been planned, and the
mental health professionals say they
hope the group will be followed at one
year intervals for at least five years.
Such a plan would be up to the State
and Defense departments, which em
ploy all but two of the hostages.
The team doesn't expect to find any
gross signs of mental illness, the team
leader and State Department medical
director, Dr. Jerome Korcak, said.
His reasoning is that anyone who had
become visibly psychotic would have
been released earlier, as was hostage
Richard Queen when he developed
symptoms of what turned out to be
multiple sclerosis.
What they do expect to find, how
ever, is a wide range of responses in
the captives — a mixed group who in
clude 21 military men, 29 State De
partment employees and 2 civilians,
men and women ranging in age from
20 to 64 and who are drawn from wide
ly different backgrounds.
The reactions they expect, accord
ing to hostage and POW expert L. J.
West, a former military psychiatrist
who is now chairman of UCLA's de
partment of psychiatry and
biobehavioral sciences, include:
— Sleeplessness, nightmares, jit

ters, shakes and tremors; overreact
ing to sudden noises; poor appetite;
emotional instability; and inability to
concentrate. These are character
istics of what psychiatrists call classi
cal traumatic neurosis, what was
called shell shock in World War I and
combat fatigue in World War 11.
