A 52-year-old male Palo Alto resi
dent was robbed at knife point at 8:45
p.m. last Friday near the Stanford
Shopping Center. The robbery took
place near the Old Hoover Pavilion on
an old unlit foot path leading to El
Camino Real near Palo Alto Drive.
The assailant grabbed the victim
using a choke hold and demanded his
wallet. The victim offered his cash to
the assailant, who then demanded the
entire wallet. To add authority to his
demand, the perpetrator revealed his
knife. The victim turned over his
wallet, but did not see the assailant be
cause he was being held from behind.
"We encourage people to use not

only lit paths but lit paths that parallel
major streets; we have had no prob
lems with major streets such as the lit
side of Falm Drive. Galvez, Campus
or Serra." said Director of Police Ser
vices Marv Herrington. Herrington
added that "even some of the lit paths
are deserted, and those through the
wooded area are almost impossible to
patrol effectively because the officers
can't see through the trees. There
have been requests to light some of the
paths that go through these areas and I
have advised against it. Even if they
were lit, we would be unable to patrol
them and they would not be safe
areas."
This case is presently under in
vestigation by the police.
