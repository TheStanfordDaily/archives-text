# Hospital opens new pre-surgery unit

For a patients awaiting surgery, the time spent just
before an operation can be scary.
To ease the trauma of surgery for outpatients, Stanford
University Hospital has opened a new Ambulatory
Surgery and Treatment Unit on its ground floor.
Prior to the unit's opening, outpatients were handled in
the emergency room along with the critically ill. Gwen
Williams, director of the hospital operating rooms and
ambulatory unit, described such an experience as
"traumatic."
"It is very traumatic for people having minor surgery to
be with those having major surgery," said Williams.
Planning for the new unit began almost a year ago when
hospital administrators realized the need to create a bet
ter environment for out-patients, Williams said.
Funding for the unit is part of the hospital's overall
budget for improvements. Lack of space forced adminis
trators to postpone the opening date.
"We had some trouble meeting facility deadlines and
had to move up the opening date but we really didn t start a
new program. It was more of a transference of an existing
program." Williams said.
The surgery unit is patterned after In- and Out-surgery
centers and contains four beds and a crib for patients re

quiring rest before surgery. The unit is divided into two
areas — one serves as a waiting room, in the other, pa
tients are prepared for surgery. Two full-time nurses, a
nursing assistant, and an office assistant staff the unit dur
ing the day.
The ambulatory unit waiting room is designed to accom
modate the patient's family. Family members are able to
stay with the patient before surgery.
"Having the family present," said Williams, "de
creases anxiety and relieves tension. "
"In terms of benefit to patients, it's extremely
positive," she said.
Following surgery the out-patient returns to the am
bulatory unit where nurses check the patient's stability.
The patient may then be released into the care of friends or
family. No patient is allowed to drive himself home.
Patients as well as staff members find the new location
an improvement.
A young man suffering from Hodgkins disease, a cancer
of the lymph nodes, commented on the treatment he re
ceived as an out-patient.
"I've been at several hospitals and here they make you
very comfortable. They're very good at reassuring you
and seem to care about how you're feeling," he explained.
