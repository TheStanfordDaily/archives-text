# Vice-Provost Bacchetti sees balanced budget for fiscal 1981
## 
### Doug Jehl 
The University's Office of Man
agement and Budget (OMB) — best
known to students for its role in de
termining tuition — is currently pre
paring recommendations for the fiscal
1981 budget.
Final recommendations are due at
the end of February and will be pres
ented to the Board of Trustees in early
March And, according to Raymond
Bacchetti, vice-provost for man
agement and budget, next year's
budget will be balanced, despite dif
ficulties presented by "another fiscal
ly tight year."
Problems in balancing the budget
will stem from the necessity of high
faculty salaries and from"the cons
tant pressure to solve problems and do
new things," Bacchetti said.
Representatives from the various
schools and facilities in the University
have already submitted prioritized
budgets for their deparments, Bac
chetti said During this month, a prov
ost's committee will attempt to com
bine the individual budgets The com
mittee is composed of Bacchetti,
Provost Albert Hastorf. and two of
Bacchetti's colleagues from the
OMB: Vice-Provost of Graduate Stud

ies W Bliss Carnochan and Vice-Prov
ost of Undergraduate Studies Gerald
Lieberman.
Cutting up the pie
In order to mesh the individual
budgets, the committee is making de
cisions about allocations for the vari
ous areas, then eliminating low-priori
ty items on the lists. In essence, Bac
chetti said, the committee will even
tually recommend how the proverbial
pie should be divided up.
The whole budgetary process
started in December when the OMB —
which Bachetti says serves as the
focus for the University's budget proc
ess — determined the amount of funds
expected to come into the University
in the next fiscal year. To do this, Bac
chetti said, predictions had to be made
regarding interest rates, inflation,
and the general state of the economy
in the coming year.
Those predictions came out of meet
ings between Bacchetti and professors
from the Economics department and
the Graduate School of Business, in
which they tried to make intelligent
guesses as to what shape the economy
will assume.
"The predictions were made dif
ficult because we don't really have a
free market economy," Bacchetti

said. "Changes occur because of polit
ical decisions as well as economic rea
sons."
Predicted inflation rate
The committee took into account
projections for the 1981 fiscal year
published in December which
projected an inflation rate of 10'2
percent on a scale called the Gross Na
tional Product Implicit Price Deflat
or. Bacchetti said his office uses this
measure of inflation rather than the
Consumer Price Index, which is now
considered inadequate by many econ
omists.
Also during December, as part of
the process of projecting the Univer
sity's income, the office submitted a
tuition increase proposal to the Board
of Trustees, asking that tuition be in
creased to $7140, a 13.6 per
centincrease.
Tuition accounts for approximately
50 per cent of the University's income.
Other major sources of income in
clude reimbursed indirect costs, en
dowments, and gifts and grants.
At the end of January, Bacchetti
said, proposals will still be in
piecemeal form, so results of the
budget process will not be released.
During February, the recommenda
tions will be finalized and published in

booklet form, then submitted to the
Board of Trustees for evaluation and
released to the media.
The board, which has the power of
final approval, will make its final de
cision — probably with no major
changes — in mid-March.
Possible cutbacks
If cuts are made in the budget, they
will probably come in areas of admin
istration. student services, and
academics, said Bacchetti, since
these areas were the hardest hit dur
ing a financially tight period that
stretched from 1968 to 1978.
Bacchetti said because professorial
salaries must compare favorably with
the dozen or so universities with which
Stanford contends in order to keep up
the quality of the faculty here,
salaries will probably produce the
most strain on next year's budget.
"We also must contend, in the pro
fessional schools, with competition
from the private sector, because pro
fessors can step into businesses or
private practice with no problem
whatsoever, get a great job, and earn
a lot of money," Bacchetti said.
Widening gap
He added that the difference
betweeen salaries in the private sec
tor and University salaries has

widened greatly in recent years, put
ting additional pressure on University
budgets.
Bacchetti said the budget will re
flect no unusual plans for the future in
either construction or fund raising.
Becuase dormitories and dining halls
have their own budgets with which the
OMB does not deal, plans for the new
dormitory, scheduled to open in 1983,
do not have to be incorporated into this
budget.
Recent economic fluctuations have
been both good and bad for the Univer
sity, according to Bacchetti. Although
high and unpredictable inflation rates
have been troublesome, correspond
ing interest rate increases have been
beneficial because the University has
a substantial amount of capital in
vested
Endowment income
Another factor that has to be eval
uated is how economic conditions will
affect Stanford's endowment income.
In fiscal 1981, the University expects
$20 million in endowments, which will
account for over 14 per cent of the Uni
versity's projected income.
But the OMB expects no change in
income from gifts and grants. "No de-

cline or drop in any way whatsoever is
predicted," Bacchetti said. "There
doesn't seem to be any correlation be
tween economy and philanthropy.".
He said as long as interest rates re
main high, private individuals who
have large amounts of money invested
are not hurt by fluctuations in the

economy.
Bacchetti also noted that a con
siderable amount of the gifts to the
University come from individuals who
are not Stanford alumni. "It seems
that Stanford is attractive to non
graduates as well as the large number
of alumni who donate money," he
said.
