# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Current report disappointing 
### 
It is often said that two heads are better
than one, but the recent presentation by
the ASSU Task Force On Contemporary
Entertainment of their "Final Report and
Recommendations" has shown that this
old adage does not necessarily hold for 16
heads as well.
One would have expected that after
more than 10 weeks of thrice-a-week 7
a.m. meetings, the Task Force would have
reached conclusions on why the now de
funct ASSU Special Events (which lost
$92,000 last year) fared so poorly, and how
the ASSU should approach the problems of
providing "contemporary entertain
ment" for the Stanford community.
While the committee did an exemplary
job of investigating and highlighting prob
lems student groups such as Special
Events face when they use University fa
cilities, it did not analyze the .various al
ternatives it came up with nor did it pres
ent a thinking view of how the ASSU
should handle the promotion of rock con
certs. It amassed 204 pages of facts, but
failed to examine the situation critically.
Two committee members, Dick But
terfield and Dayna Goldfine, who are also
members of the Council of Presidents,
told the Daily editorial board that the
Task Force did not realize that it had been
charged by the senate to present clear rec
ommendations.
However, the introduction to the report
that they helped to write clearly states
that the committee was charged to "re
port back ... by the end of fall quarter on
the potential of a future ASSU-operated
entertainment producing agent. If such a
project is desired, the Task Force shall es
tablish the guidelines for said project."
(Italics added)
We feel that the committee failed to
fulfill its primary purpose, and that it was
remiss in not checking back with the sen
ate to clarify what was expected of its
work.
The Task Force recommended to the
senate last week that a new committee be
set up to further examine the problem,
and that this new committee should make
the final recommendations on how con
temporary entertainment should be pres
ented here. It further recommended that a
committee to study the entire ASSU be es
tablished. The senate vetoed the second

committee, and gave the new entertain
ment committee five weeks to complete
its work.
We strongly urge the senate to re
consider its action, and recommend that a
sub-committee of the original task force
be assembled to write the final recom
mendations that should have been in the
original report. If such a group cannot be
established, the COP should itself quickly
discuss the options and present to the sen
ate a tentative proposal for a new struc
ture for concert promotion here.
While the newly established committee
will incorporate some members of the old
committee, as well as some Finance Com
mittee members, it seems the "continui
ty" the task force stressed would suffer
from the addition of new members at this
late stage of the process.
Further, any new set-up for contem
porary entertainment should maximize
student involvement, but not at the ex
pense of the efficiency of the project. We
don't believe the goal of teaching students
about concert promotion should preclude
the involvement of other bodies in concert
promotion at Stanford. These twin con
siderations. and others, must be weighed
when the task force makes its final recom
mendations.
Yet these difficulties with the report do
not devalue the important facts the com
mittee exposed with regard to Univer
sity's relationship with student organiza
tions. The committee found that students
here pay more for services from the Uni
versity than do students at other schools â€”
prices that are often higher than would be
paid on the open market.
These findings have ramifications for a
wide range of student activities, from the
Theater Guild to the Speakers Bureau. Al
ternative approaches to obtaining these
services, like collective bargaining with
the University or contracting with non-
University technicians, should be studied.
Other schools, for instance, are said to pay
only 10 cents per tickets for the use of the
University ticket office, while Tresidder
Ticket Office charges 25 cents.
For the present, however, COP mem
bers. the senate and members of the Task
Force should concentrate on resolving the
immediate problem; that of finding a re
placement for Special Events.
