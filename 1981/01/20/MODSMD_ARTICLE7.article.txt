## Extraterrestrial civilizations improbable 
### 
Ever since the beginnings of
exploration of the neighborhood
of our earth, scientists have
been listening with giant radio
telescopes to the noises of the
universe, scanning hopefully for
signs of intelligent life around
distant stars. The search has
gone on with increasing sophis
tication and ever more sensitive
instruments, but thus far not a
plausible whimper of our fellow
creatures has been heard.
One must wonder why not.
since we assume that an ad
vanced civilization com
municates over great distances,
probably using large amounts of
energy, some of which we might
detect. Perhaps the extrater
restrials are hiding from us, or
wish to observe us without let
ting us know they are watching,
like scientists studying wild

animals.
Perhaps, on the other hand,
there is nobody out there. The
assumption that there should be
is based on little but the exulta
tion in the power of technology.
The only logical reason to sup
pose that life is possible and can
evolve intelligence is that fact
that we exist. Likewise, theonly
basis for assuming that there
may be other civilizations on
about the same level as ours is
the existence of our civilization.
This is not very helpful, be
cause our electronic civilization
obviously cannot continue in
anything like its present condi
tion for more than a flash by the
time span of the universe. It is
only a few decades old and must
decline < if only from exhaustion
of natural resources) within a
few decades unless it can

achieve a much higher, better
integrated and more stable con
dition. Its span is not likely to be
more than one fifty-millionth of
the age of the earth.
Our condition of unstable civ
ilization being ephemeral, the
searchers for extraterrestrial
intelligence think in terms of
stable supercivilizations, socie
ties endowed with science-fic
tion capabilities, such as travel
between solar systems, utili
zation of much of the energy of a
star, the building of artificial
planets or asteroids as habitats,
and so forth.
However, while we can point
to earth life as evidence for the
possibility of life on other
worlds, we have nothing to point
to as evidence that super
civilization is a real possibility
in this universe — only a hope
that our present civilization
may rise to a far higher and
much more stable state. The
supposition that even one super
civilization may exist anywhere
rests solely (aside from un
critical faith) on a speculation
regarding the human future.
Most futurologists would
agree that it is not a good bet
that we will provide a demon
stration of supercivilization. In
telligence creates new prob
lems as rapidly as it solves old
ones, and it would seem that
technological development
means dependence and fragility
— what would happen to our
cities without electricity or to
our agriculture without liquid
fuel, for example.
There is no assurance that the
curve of progress may flatten.
It is possible that it has begun to
do so. the recent worldwide de
cline of rates of growth of prod
uctivity may be an omen. No in
novation in sight seems likely to
alter our way of life so markedly
as inventions already a gener
ation or more old, particularly
the automobile, the telephone,
the airplane and television. The
fundamentals of modern phys
ics, relativity and quantum me
chanics. were solidly estab
lished in the 19205; subsequent
advances have only built on
them.
Scientists tend to forget that
the barriers to building a super
civilization are much more po
litical than technical. Among
the problems that must be over
come if humanity is to attain its
technological eden are: the
need to reconcile ever-growing

destructive power with the an
archic freedom of nations; to
accommodate individual free
dom to reproduce and consume
with the limits of earth's re
sources; to reverse the preva
lent tendency of technological
progress to deepen inequalities
of wealth and power; in short, to
reconcile order and freedom
much better than humans have
yet been able to do.
There is a problem of
purpose; increasing numbers of
people in countries of the most
modernity, in the U.S. and
Western Europe, are profoundly
skeptical of the ultimate bene
fits of much more technology.
There is distrust of the further
manipulation of nature shown
by fears of gene-splicing ex
perimentation and passionate
defense of threatened environ
ments.
Successive technologies are
more capital-demanding and
utilizable by a smaller propor
tion of the population. For ex
ample, the production of energy
has gone from felling trees to
mining coal to the much more
complicated drilling for petrole
um and to nuclear power. If
fusion power becomes feasible,
generating plants will probably
have to be so big and costly that
only the very richest nations
could build them. The next
higher stage in this sequence
would probably be beyond the
resources of humanity, or
beyond the resources people
would be willing to invest.
We thus seem more likely to
spend coming decades adapting
ourselves to increased crowding
and shortages than to do much
climbing the steps of technolog
ical grandeur. Unless we can
build a bridge to a far loftier
future, we have no reason to be
lieve that we may not be very
much alone in this grand uni
verse.
Perhaps the best reason for
keeping up the search for other
civilizations (however im
probable) is that finding one
would suggest that humanity
can devise a way through the
current time of troubles to a
blissful future state of full and
harmonious application of an
enhanced intelligence.

Scientists tend to forget that

progress to deepen inequalities
of wealth and power; in short, to
reconcile order and freedom

There is a problem of

Western Europe, are profoundly

fusion power becomes feasible,
generating plants will probably
have to be so big and costly that
only the very richest nations

higher stage in this sequence

beyond the resources people

Ever since the beginnings of
exploration of the neighborhood
of our earth, scientists have
been listening with giant radio
telescopes to the noises of the
universe, scanning hopefully for
signs of intelligent life around
distant stars. The search has
gone on with increasing sophis
tication and ever more sensitive
instruments, but thus far not a
plausible whimper of our fellow
creatures has been heard.
One must wonder why not.
since we assume that an ad
vanced civilization com
municates over great distances,
probably using large amounts of
energy, some of which we might
detect. Perhaps the extrater
restrials are hiding from us, or
wish to observe us without let
ting us know they are watching,
like scientists studying wild

animals.
Perhaps, on the other hand,
there is nobody out there. The
assumption that there should be
is based on little but the exulta
tion in the power of technology.
The only logical reason to sup
pose that life is possible and can
evolve intelligence is that fact
that we exist. Likewise, theonly
basis for assuming that there
may be other civilizations on
about the same level as ours is
the existence of our civilization.
This is not very helpful, be
cause our electronic civilization
obviously cannot continue in
anything like its present condi
tion for more than a flash by the
time span of the universe. It is
only a few decades old and must
decline < if only from exhaustion
of natural resources) within a
few decades unless it can

achieve a much higher, better
integrated and more stable con
dition. Its span is not likely to be
more than one fifty-millionth of
the age of the earth.
Our condition of unstable civ
ilization being ephemeral, the
searchers for extraterrestrial
intelligence think in terms of
stable supercivilizations, socie
ties endowed with science-fic
tion capabilities, such as travel
between solar systems, utili
zation of much of the energy of a
star, the building of artificial
planets or asteroids as habitats,
and so forth.
However, while we can point
to earth life as evidence for the
possibility of life on other
worlds, we have nothing to point
to as evidence that super
civilization is a real possibility
in this universe — only a hope
that our present civilization
may rise to a far higher and
much more stable state. The
supposition that even one super
civilization may exist anywhere
rests solely (aside from un
critical faith) on a speculation
regarding the human future.
Most futurologists would
agree that it is not a good bet
that we will provide a demon
stration of supercivilization. In
telligence creates new prob
lems as rapidly as it solves old
ones, and it would seem that
technological development
means dependence and fragility
— what would happen to our
cities without electricity or to
our agriculture without liquid
fuel, for example.
There is no assurance that the
curve of progress may flatten.
It is possible that it has begun to
do so. the recent worldwide de
cline of rates of growth of prod
uctivity may be an omen. No in
novation in sight seems likely to
