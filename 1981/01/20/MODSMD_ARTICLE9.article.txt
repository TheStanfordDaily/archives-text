## Palestinian issue no reason to attack UN 
### 
It was disappointing to read in
the Daily (Jan. 14) that 11 Stan
ford faculty members recently
signed a statement in The Neic
York Times that bitterly at
tacked the United Nations.
Judging by the Daily story, the
statement's signers are willing
to discredit the one interna
tional forum we have because
its members frequently oppose
the policies of the Israeli gov
ernment.
Signers of the statement
claim that the United Nations
concentrates on the Palestinian
issue to the neglect of suffering
peoples around the world. Even
if this were true, the United
States is surely far more guilty
of the same offense and should
be the prime target of the
signers' criticism. This year
U.S. aid to Israel will total near
ly $3 billion, which amounts to
more than $500 for each Israeli.
More than half of all U.S. for
eign aid goes to Israel and
Egypt, with very little left for

the hungry people of Africa,
Asia or Latin America.
U.N. opposition to Israeli pol
icies is bv no means limited to
the Arab and Soviet blocs, as the
signers suggest. Two recent
U.N. resolutions condemned the
Begin government's annexation
of East Jerusalem — in vio
lation of the Camp David agree
ments — and called for the re
turn of two Palestinian mayors
who had been dragged from
their homes last spring and sent
into exile.
The resolution on Jerusalem
passed by a vote of 143 to one,
with four abstentions. The reso
lution on the mayors was passed
unanimously by the Security
Council, including the United
States. These votes are not the
product of "Third World in
terests" but reflect the fact that
Israeli policies are slowly alien
ating much of the world.
One of the statement's
signers. Prof. Paul Flory, is
quoted as saying that the PLO

does not represent the Palesti
nians and therefore should be
excluded from peace nego
tiations. But most Middle East
observers have found that the
PLO does indeed have broad
support among Palestinians.
According to The Washington
Post correspondents William
Claiborne and Edward Cody:
"Because no one else has raised
the flag of Palestinian na
tionalism with such determina
tion (the PLO) has captured the
loyalties of a mostly con
servative population whose
greatest concern is keeping its
land."
The most convincing
evidence is that when Israel per
mitted elections on the West
Bank in 1976, the candidates who
openly supported the PLO were
overwhelmingly elected. (Elec
tions were due to be held again
last April but the Begin govern
ment, which has banned all po
litical activities in the occupied
territories, refused to let them

take place.) Israel's rigid posi
tions on the occupied territories
serve to strengthen the mili
tants in the PLO, but there are
moderates in the organization
who can, and should be, en
couraged.
Prof. Flory, according to the
Daily, warned that attacks on
Israel are' an attack on human
rights everywhere." But it is
the Palestinians, forced to live
under Israeli military occupa
tion in a land where they have
historically been the majority,
who are denied their rights.
Entire towns are put under
curfew and houses demolished
because of the acts of a few of
fenders. In addition, Arabs must
endure the expropriation of
their land and the diversion of
much-needed water to Israeli
use. Last summer the Israeli
government brought all three
West Bank universities under
military control, an act that
should surely be protested by
those who believe in academic
freedom.
While the U.N. General As
sembly did, unfortunately, con
demn Zionism as racist, it has
never questioned Israel's right
to a secure existence. U.N.
members have mainly objected
to Israel's expansion into neigh
boring territories and to its
treatment of the Palestinians.
One need not support all U.N.
votes in order to deplore an at
tack on the United Nations
itself. The purpose of the or
ganization is, after all, to pro
vide a sounding board, a place
where the nations of the world
can express their views. As such
it is far too valuable to under
mine simply because we don't
like what is being said.
