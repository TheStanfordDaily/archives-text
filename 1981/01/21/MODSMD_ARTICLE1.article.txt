# Hostages freed as Reagan inaugurated
## First address reemphasizes U.S. potential 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Ronald Reagan as
sumed office as the nation's 40th presi
dent yesterday with a passionate call
for an "era of national renewal" and a
pledge not to compromise on his prom
ises to cut taxes and reduce the size of
the federal government.
In his first official act as president,
less than an hour after being sworn in,
the former California governor signed
an order imposing a federal hiring
freeze that he said "will eventually
lead to a sizable reduction in the feder
al work force."
"It is time for us to realize that we
are too great a nation to limit
ourselves to small dreams," Reagan
declared in his inaugural address. He
had charged during the 1980 campaign
that President Jimmy Carter had too
limited a view of the nation's poten
tial.
"We're not. as some would have us
believe, doomed to an inevitable de
cline," he said. "I do not believe in a
fate that will fall on us no matter what
we do I do believe in a fate that will
fall on us if we do nothing. So with all
the creative energy at our command,
let us begin an era of national re
newal."
Warning to terrorists
Inaugurated as the American
hostages were being freed in Iran,
Reagan also had a warning for in
ternational terrorists. He declared
that no weapon against them is as for
midable as one employed by Ameri
cans —'' the will and moral courage of
free men and women."
Reagan made no direct reference to
the hostages in his forcefully de
livered, 15-minute inaugural address.
But the high drama of their release
dominated the conversations of many
of the thousands who turned out to
watch the inaugural ceremonies and
parade under cloudy skies and in
almost spring-like weather.

The planes carrying the hostages to
freedom took off from Tehran just a
few minutes after the new president
completed his speech.
Carter, who blames the hostage
crisis for crippling his presidency and
burying his re-election effort, had held
out hope until just before the in
auguration ceremonies that he would
be able to announce the release before
he left office. As it was, he returned to
a homecoming celebration in Plains,
Ga. with the knowledge that the
feverish activities in the final days of
his presidency had paid off and it was
said that he hoped people would think
the outcome vindicated his policy of
patience.
At Reagan's request, Carter will fly
to Wiesbaden. West Germany, as a
special envoy to greet the 52 hostages.
Reagan began his inaugural address

with a tribute to Jimmy Carter, the
man he crushed in a landslide vote on
Nov. 4, for his efforts in carrying on
the tradition of assuring an orderly
transfer of authority.
"Mr. President," Reagan said, "I
want our fellow citizens to know how
much you did to carry on this tradi
tion. By your gracious cooperation in
the transition process you have shown
a watching world that we are a united
people pledged to maintaining a politi
cal system which guarantees individ
ual liberty a greater degree than any
other."
Oath of office
Reagan, a former movie actor who
will turn 70 on Feb. 6. took his oath of
office at four minutes before noon
from Chief Justice Warren Burger.
Standing at the new president's side,
dressed in red, was the new first lady,

Nancy Reagan.
Just moments before, former U.N.
Ambassador George Bush had taken
the oath as vice president from a
former Yale University classmate,
.Justice Potter Stewart. "God bless
you. George." Stewart said after ad
ministering the oath.
Reagan's inaugural address was
praised by Democrats as well as Re
publicans for setting an inspirational
tone in its discussion of the economic
and national security problems faced
by the country.
"All of us together — in and out of
government — must bear the burden,"
he said. The solutions we seek, must
V.e equitable with no one group singled
out to pay a higher price. We hear
much of special interest groups. Well,
our concern must be for a special in
terest group that has been too long
neglected.
"It knows no sectional boundaries
or ethnic and racial divisions, and it
crosses political party lines. It is
made up of men and women who raise
our food, patrol our streets, man our
mines and factories, teach our chil
dren, keep our homes, and heal us
when we are sick — professionals, in
dustrialists, shop keepers, clerks,
cabbies, and truck drivers. They are,
in short, 'We the people,' this breed
called Americans."
His objective, Reagan continued,
will be a vigorous, growing economy
that provides equal opportunities for
all Americans "with no barriers born
of bigotry or discrimination."
"All must share in the productive
work of this 'new beginning,' " he
said, "and all must share in the bounty
of a revived economy."
