# TMI results cloud nuke future

The accident at Three Mile
Island power plant on March
28. 1979 cast the nuclear
power industry into a sea of
uncertainty. First, what was
feared most by opponents of
nuclear power threatened to
become reality: the in
troduction of large quantities
of high-level radiation into
the environment. Now, re
sults of investigations which
ensued may end the con
struction and operation of
nuclear power generating
plants.
The response to TMl's ac
cident by the nuclear power
industry was immediate. In
April of 1979 the Electric
Power Research Institute
(EPRI), based in Palo Alto,
established the Nuclear
Safety Analysis Center
(NS AC) to study the accident
sequence and determine its
safety implications.
It was also charged with
the task of assisting the Gen
eral Public Utilities Corpo
ration (GPUi. owner of the
power plant at TMI, in the re
covery from the accident and
developing recommenda
tions for reactor safety im
provements.
On March 25, 1980. NSAC,
in conjunction with EPRI's
Institute of Nuclear Power
Operations, presented a re
port to then-President Jim
my Carter which detailed
their progress in improving
nuclear safety. At that time
their conclusions seemed to
clear the way for progress in
the construction and opera
tion of more nuclear power
generating plants.
The report embodied three
conclusions. First, it said
that although the accident
was serious, it presents no
current dangers. For one
thing, the much-feared
hydrogen bubble explosion
was determined to be im
possible: there would not
have been enough oxygen
present to support combus
tion.

And the leakage of radi
ation into the atmosphere
proved less than anticipated,
claimed the report. Com
puter simulation had pre
dicted that high levels of
iodine would be released.
However, iodine and cesium,
both present in the reactor
and both radioactive, dis
solved in the cooling water
rather than being released,
the report said.
The report added that radi
oactive xenon and krypton,
released into the at
mosphere, also posed no real
hazard because they are in
ert, and so are not retained in
the human body. Even then,
the highest dose received by
any person near TMI was
about 40 millirem, according
to the report, equivalent to
the exposure received in one
chest x-ray. Natural back
ground radiation amounts to
about 100 millirem per year.
Second, NSAC in
vestigators found the in
dustry responded quickly to
the accident: they made
changes in plant equipment;
they altered operating and
training procedures; they
even established organiza
tions to investigate the acci
dent.
Third, the report con
cluded that not having nucle
ar power is costly: By March
of 1980 GPU, owner of the
plant at TMI, had spent $130
million purchasing and pro
ducing electricity to replace
that lost by the shutdown.
Implementing recommen
dations set forth as a result
of TMI has also been ex
pensive. said the report.
Three months after the acci
dent, 23changes were recom
mended that could be made
immediately. One change re
quired the installation of in
struments to verify that wa
ter is not boiling in the reac
tor core. The lack of such in
struments at TMI con
tributed to much of the con

fusion of plant operators dur
ing the accident.
These changes, im
plemented in 1979, will cost
an estimated $1 billion by the
time they are made in all
plants.
About nine months after
the accident, 180 additional
changes were recom
mended. The total cost for
these is approximately $32.5
billion.With these costs in
mind, Don McCarthy, chair
man and president of
Northern States Power Co.
said that the accident has in
creased the uncertainty
about the future of nuclear
power.
Another barrier to future
development of nuclear
power is increased public ap
prehension about "nukes",
NSAC reported, adding that
the memory of families
fleeing their homes near TMI
remains vivid and will no
doubt contribute to public
concern about the safety and
desirability of nuclear plants
for a long time.
But Dr. Frank Rahn, tech
nical assistant to the director
of the nuclear power division
at EPRI, states that the in
dustry is more concerned
about reactor safety than the
general public, as the in
dustry sees financial risk as
well as environmental risk.
The incident at TMI, with ex
pected clean-up costs ex
ceeding $800 million, showed
that accidents, even with lit
tle risk to the public, can be
financially disastrous:
"The risk to the public is
small, but the risk to the util
ity is great," he said.
The doubt which threatens
nuclear power industries will
persist for a long time. Elec
tric utility companies may
understandably be unwilling
to invest in something so
risky. In light of this possi
bility, then, even the future
of existing nuclear power
plants lies in question.
