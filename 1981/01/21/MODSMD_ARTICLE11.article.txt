# America fetes hostages' release
## 
### Associated Press 
News of the coming emancipation of the
52 American hostages this week brought
barroom cheers and grateful prayers, spon
taneous celebrations and determined vows
of "Never again."
"Now we can smile," read a banner that
went up at a hotel near a U.S. Air Force hos
pital in Wiesbaden, West Germany, while
back home they snipped down the frayed
yellow ribbons that had served to remind of
the plight of the captives in Iran.
Church bells rang, high school bands
struck up patriotic music and in a cemetery
in Hermitage, Pa., they raised a final flag,
No. 443, one for each day since the storming
of the U.S. embassy in Tehran.
Dorothea Morefield of San Diego, wife of
hostage Richard Morefield, spoke of the re
lief after 14 months of hopes dangled and
then dashed.
"All of a sudden I don't have a headache,"
she said. "All of a sudden, I'm not afraid."

the announcement by then-President Jim

my Carter of an agreement was greeted by
"cheering, screaming and yelling," accord
ing to the manager, who said his name was
B J. "It's like reaching New Year's."
Yellow ribbons
In small-town America, it was a day of
tribute to God and country.
Flags were unfurled along the streets of
Milledgeville, Ga. Church bells pealed.
Mayor James Baugh and local ministers
held a ceremony at City Hall with music by
the Georgia Military College band.
Robert Holloway of Jonesville, N.Y.,
near Albany, set out with a pair of scissors
to cut down all the yellow ribbons he had
tied to trees and lampposts throughout the
area. Mayor Louis Herman of the village of
Monticello in the Catskill Mountains said he
would ask the town board for permission to
do the same thing.
"Welcome Home Hostages!" said a
dozen billboards featuring the Stars and
Stripes that appeared in Nashville, Tenn.
A night-time fireworks display was
scheduled in Tucson, Ariz., and Baltimore

Mayor William Schaefer asked churches,
motorists and fire stations to ring bells,
honk horns and blow sirens as soon as the
hostages were out of Iran.
In St. Petersburg, Fla., the Pinellas Coun
ty Tourist Development Council said it was
planning to offer all 52 hostages free vaca
tions in Florida.
Never again
But, all in all, it was a bittersweet cele

"They will soon be home," said former
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, "But
our celebration of their release is muted by
the suffering that has been endured so
bravely."
New Mexico's newest congressman, Re
publican Joe Skeen, was among those voic
ing the view that the United States should
hang tough next time.
"Among those of us in Congress, there's a
determination that this is never going to
happen to another American again," Skeen
said. "We're just not going to be held
hostage again."
