# U.S.-Iran relations remain tense
## 
### Newsday 
Washington — The hostage
crisis might be ended, but the
Iranian-American crisis is not.
That crisis started with the
fall of the shah of Iran and it
continues. The hostages were an
impediment — a serious impedi
ment — to better relations, but
they were never the cause of the
estrangement.
Not having to deal with the
hostage situation is obviously a
tremendous advantge for Presi
dent Ronald Reagan. But most
Mideast experts say it will be a
long time before the bitterness
of the hostage affair and the
more deep-seated distrust of the
United States dissipates.
Yet at the same time, those
experts all agree that it will be
in the long range interests of the
United States to improve its ties
with Iran and not do anything
that would provide an opening
for Soviet influence.
"I think that it is very impor
tant that we distinquish be
tween our emotions and a cool
appraisal of what is in our in
terests." said Joseph Nye, a
former undersecretary of state
and now a professor at Harvard
University. "There is going to
be a lot of anger at Iran, but it is
still an important country for
us. They were a major producer
of oil not long ago and they can
become a major producer
again. And the last thing you
want is to have that Iranian oil
in Soviet hands."
But the experts also agree
that the United States will not
be able to take action by itself to
improve relations. Most experts
interviewed said that it would
be a major mistake for the Unit
ed States to now tilt toward Iran

in its war with Iraq or to try to
even resume an arms rela
tionship with the revolutionary
Islamic government.
Indeed, most do not believe
that the U.S. will even be able to
sell oil equipment to Iran to re
pair the damage done to their oil
fields. Rather the feeling is that
the West Europeans and Japan
will have to take the initiative
with Iran.
Strategic importance
What all the experts agree on,
however, is that Iran is a
strategically vital country and
that any gain in Soviet influence
there would be a major setback
for the United States. It is im
portant because of its oil and be
cause of its location in the
middle of the Persian Gulf, the
repository of a good percentage
of all the oil consumed by the
Western industrialized de
mocracies.
Most agree that Iran has a
natural interest in not allowing
the Soviets to gain a foothold in
their country. But the problem
is whether the Iranians will
agree on what is in their own
long-term self interest.
"We will not be able to rush
into anything," said William
Quandt, a Mideast expert who
served on former President
Jimmy Carter's national secur
ity staff for two years. "We are
not talking about a matter of
months, but years before the re
lationship can hope to improve.
There is a deep-seated, long
standing mistrust of the United
States. They deeply believe that
we will do everything we can to
disrupt their government and
bring back the shah's son or the
exiled military leaders."

The extent of the bitterness
and distrust of the United States
cannot be underestimated, ex
perts indicated. To the leaders
of the Iranian revolution — and
it was a spontaneous, broadly
supported revolution — Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was
nothing but an American puppet
who gave away Iran's oil and
squandered Iran's money on an
alien, immoral modernization.
A Tehran radio broadcast
Sunday suggested that the anti-
American mentality would cer
tainly be maintained with the in
auguration of the Reagan ad
ministration. The broadcast
warned Reagan against adopt
ing a militaristic policy in the
Persian Gulf, a policy that it
said would lead to an explosion
in that area. The broadcast tied

Secretary of State-designate
Alexander Haig to U.S. military
imperialism (he is a retired
general) and Vice President
George Bush to the CIA (he is a
former CIA director and the
CIA is well known in Iran for
having helped return the shah to
power in 1953).
The key question will come
after the 80-year-old Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini passes from
the scene. He is the one who is
holding the country together.
There certainly will be a strug
gle for power between left and
right, cleric and secular, mod
erate and radical, East and
West. And the outcome of that
struggle, not the freeing of the
hostages, will probably de
termine the long-term Ameri
can relationship with Iran.

CIA is well known in Iran for
having helped return the shah to
power in 1953).
The key question will come
after the 80-year-old Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini passes from
the scene. He is the one who is
holding the country together.
There certainly will be a strug
gle for power between left and
right, cleric and secular, mod
erate and radical, East and
West. And the outcome of that
struggle, not the freeing of the
hostages, will probably de
termine the long-term Ameri
can relationship with Iran.
Washington — The hostage
crisis might be ended, but the
Iranian-American crisis is not.
That crisis started with the
fall of the shah of Iran and it
continues. The hostages were an
impediment — a serious impedi
ment — to better relations, but
they were never the cause of the
estrangement.
Not having to deal with the
hostage situation is obviously a
tremendous advantge for Presi
dent Ronald Reagan. But most
Mideast experts say it will be a
long time before the bitterness
of the hostage affair and the
more deep-seated distrust of the
United States dissipates.
Yet at the same time, those
experts all agree that it will be
in the long range interests of the
United States to improve its ties
with Iran and not do anything
that would provide an opening
for Soviet influence.
"I think that it is very impor
tant that we distinquish be
tween our emotions and a cool
appraisal of what is in our in
terests." said Joseph Nye, a
former undersecretary of state
and now a professor at Harvard
University. "There is going to
be a lot of anger at Iran, but it is
still an important country for
us. They were a major producer
of oil not long ago and they can
become a major producer
again. And the last thing you
want is to have that Iranian oil
in Soviet hands."
But the experts also agree
that the United States will not
be able to take action by itself to
improve relations. Most experts
interviewed said that it would
be a major mistake for the Unit
ed States to now tilt toward Iran

in its war with Iraq or to try to
even resume an arms rela
tionship with the revolutionary
Islamic government.
Indeed, most do not believe
that the U.S. will even be able to
sell oil equipment to Iran to re
pair the damage done to their oil
fields. Rather the feeling is that
the West Europeans and Japan
will have to take the initiative
with Iran.
Strategic importance
What all the experts agree on,
however, is that Iran is a
strategically vital country and
that any gain in Soviet influence
there would be a major setback
for the United States. It is im
portant because of its oil and be
cause of its location in the
middle of the Persian Gulf, the
repository of a good percentage
of all the oil consumed by the
Western industrialized de
mocracies.
Most agree that Iran has a
natural interest in not allowing
the Soviets to gain a foothold in
their country. But the problem
is whether the Iranians will
agree on what is in their own
long-term self interest.
"We will not be able to rush
into anything," said William
Quandt, a Mideast expert who
served on former President
Jimmy Carter's national secur
ity staff for two years. "We are
not talking about a matter of
months, but years before the re
lationship can hope to improve.
There is a deep-seated, long
standing mistrust of the United
States. They deeply believe that
we will do everything we can to
disrupt their government and
bring back the shah's son or the
exiled military leaders."

The extent of the bitterness
and distrust of the United States
cannot be underestimated, ex
perts indicated. To the leaders
of the Iranian revolution — and
it was a spontaneous, broadly
supported revolution — Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi was
nothing but an American puppet
who gave away Iran's oil and
squandered Iran's money on an
alien, immoral modernization.
A Tehran radio broadcast
Sunday suggested that the anti-
American mentality would cer
tainly be maintained with the in
auguration of the Reagan ad
ministration. The broadcast
warned Reagan against adopt
ing a militaristic policy in the
Persian Gulf, a policy that it
said would lead to an explosion
in that area. The broadcast tied
