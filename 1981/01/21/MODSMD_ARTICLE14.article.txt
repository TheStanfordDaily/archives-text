## Three Americans still imprisoned in Iran

Buffalo, N.Y. (AP) - Free-lance
writer Cynthia Dwyer, a 49-year-old
mother of three, has been sitting in an
Iranian jail cell since May.
She won't be coming home with the 52
hostages seized in the 1979 capture of the
U.S. Embassy, but her husband says an
agreement for their release gives him
new hope that she too will be home soon.
''It certainly doesn't make me
pessimistic," John Dwyer said Monday.
"It's just one of those situations where
you just have to take it step by step and
carefully, but I think possibly their re
lease has brought a resolution to this
crisis."
He has not seen his wife since she left
for Iran on April 10, planning to sell

stories to Buffalo newspapers and other
publications when she returned.
On May 5, Mrs. Dwyer was arrested at
her hotel and accused of spying for the
Central Intelligence Agency, an accusa
tion Dwyer denies.
Higher hopes
State Department officials say that se
curing the hostages' freedom would
hrvßhten the picture Cor other U.S.
citizens held in Iran, if only because ne
gotiators would be bargaining for a
smaller group.
"Fourteen months ago, and ever
since, we've been wondering how we
were going to get out the 52 hostages,"
State Department spokesman John Trat
tner said.

"We figured out a way to do that, and I
feel confident we'll figure out a way to do
it in her case as well." he said in refer
ence to Mrs. Dwyer. "We're continuing
to keep as close an eye on her as we can
through our (Swiss diplomatic) chan
nel."
Swiss diplomacy
Swiss diplomats have visited Mrs.
Dwyer several times in her cell — the
last known time around Christmas — at
Prison in Tehran. Dwyer has re
ceived two letters in which his wife said
she was doing well.
' I've talked to the State Department a
couple of times today," Dwyer said.
"They have nothing more to report. She
is basically in the same situation.
They're doing all they can."

Two others held by Iranians are Mohi
Sobhani, a naturalized American who
was born in Iran and reportedly was run
ning a business there when he was ar
rested last September for unknown rea
sons, and Afghanistarf-born Zia Nasri,
arrested 10 months ago.
Trattner said the State Department's
next step was to find out why Mrs. Dwyer
was being heYd. Dwyer said the lact that
his wile Y\ad riot been formally charged
increased his belief she would be re
leased.
"In effect, she's been detained for an
investigation that is, presumably, conti
nuing," he said. "She's not a spy."
The Dwyers' wedding anniversary is
June 19, and Dwyer said he hoped his
wife would be home by then.
