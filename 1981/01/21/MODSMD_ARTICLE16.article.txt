## Harrington's last ditch claim to radicalism 
### 
Poor Michael Harrington.
Mouthing the tired rhetoric of
the Old Left, urging us to prop
up the increasingly tyrannical
welfare state, blaming the oil
companies for everything that
goes wrong — can he really be
serious?
The main error of socialists
like Harrington is the incredible
mismatch of their means to the
ends. Socialism attempts to
achieve liberal ends — personal
freedom, prosperity, peace —
with profoundly conservative
and anti-liberal means — the ex
ercise of state power over the
masses by a ruling elite. By
their strategic embrace of the
Leviathan State, the socialists
place the lives of the many in the
hands of the few. a sure recipe
for despotism.
Of late, the socialists have
tried to remedy this problem by
emphasizing the "democratic"
nature of what they are propo
sing. Harrington says, "Let
those who are affected by the
decisions make the decisions."
Toin Havden wants "economic
democracy." Never mind that
democracy in practice is either
representative democracy — in
which case we get to choose
which tyrant will then exercise
power over us — or "pure" de
mocracy — in which caseerery
thing has to be voted on by eve
ryone and life becomes one
giant political meeting.
What the socialists cannot
jettison, lest they lose their way
entirely, is their opposition to
economic freedom. No matter
what kind of socialist you are,
you cannot support private own
ership of the means of prod
uction. which in practice means
just about any material object,
or you have abandoned social
ism.

This is the fatal flaw. For
without the private ownership
of things, none of the other free
doms can exist — not freedom of
speech, religion, travel: none of
them. If the Socialist Planning
Board refuses to allot you pa
per. ink and presses, your free
dom of speech becomes mean
ingless. If you are Jewish and
they refuse to make matzos. as
is the case in the Soviet Union,
your "freedom of religion" suf
fers. And so on.
As concerns the economic
problem itself, here the social
ist economy demonstrates its
true potential for disaster.
Without the private ownership
of property, there can be no
price system. And without a
price system, there can be no
rational allocation of resources.
An industrial economy simply
cannot be run without the in
formation that prices transmit.
Prices tell consumers and
producers what is scarce and
what is not, what is wanted and
what is not. what will work lor
the benefit of people and what
will not. The free market price
system is the means by which
information scattered among
millions of people is assembled
and transmitted to those who
need it to guide their actions.
Without prices, the vitally im
portant function of the en
trepreneur in putting together
new combinations of labor and
capital to better satisfy con
sumer desires is lost.
It is no accident that socialist
economies in practice are
always fraught with shortages
and queues, with disastrous
projects involving dams or re
fineries or other large-scale
projects, with low productivity,
and with underground free mar

kets. It is also no accident that
relatively successful socialist
economies are those that turn
over major areas, such as farm
ing. to the private sector.
I can hear the objections of
some of the local Stanford so
cialists now: "But we're decen
tralists. we don't want to place
all that power in the hands of the
State, we want to give it to local
groups. Hell, some of us are
even anarchists."
My reply is that they just for
feited the game. For if social
ism means local control, then
they cannot keep it from logical
ly being pushed to the most local
level, the level of the individual.
Every power and responsibility
that they want to give to the lo
cal collective, or tribe, or what
ever they call it. can logically
also be given to the "collective
of one." Then the vote will
always be unanimous.
All that's left to do is spell out
the principles of "socialist indi
vidualism." I would suggest
that only two are needed.
First is the principle of self
ownership: every man and
woman has the absolute right to
control his or her own body and
labor. No person or group of per
sons may invade that self-own
ership.
Second, it follows that if each
individual owns his or her own
labor, then he or she must own
the fruits of that labor, and has
the right to exchange the prod
ucts of his or her labor for the
products of other persons.
We're done. We have arrived
at property rights, the free mar
ket. and the free society via "de
centralist" socialism. The first
principle implies all the person
al freedoms that socialists ap
prove of. and the second princi

pie guarantees that they can be
carried out in practice, in addi
tion to providing the basis for all
real-world prosperity, the free
market.
The local socialists will be
aghast at what I've done, be
cause what I've derived is, of
course, libertarianism; plus
I've shown it to be more radical
than any kind of socialism in the
most basic sense of the word,
which means going to the root.
So my sympathies go out to
Michael Harrington and other
socialists. They are fighting a
last-ditch effort to maintain
their claim on being the most
radical critics of the status-quo,

when they are being outflanked
by the libertarians, who are
equally critical of the Left and
the Right.
The socialists, having no firm
principles to espouse, are re
duced to calling for such things
as a "grass-roots effort to de
fend food stamps." How utterly
devoid of any positive vision
they must be to hold up this
crumb the Corporate State
tosses to its victims as a
progressive institution worth
defending.

ership of the means of prod
uction. which in practice means
just about any material object,
or you have abandoned social
ism.

This is the fatal flaw. For
without the private ownership
of things, none of the other free
doms can exist — not freedom of
speech, religion, travel: none of
them. If the Socialist Planning
Board refuses to allot you pa
per. ink and presses, your free
dom of speech becomes mean
ingless. If you are Jewish and
they refuse to make matzos. as
is the case in the Soviet Union,
your "freedom of religion" suf
fers. And so on.
As concerns the economic
problem itself, here the social
ist economy demonstrates its
true potential for disaster.
Without the private ownership
of property, there can be no
price system. And without a
price system, there can be no
rational allocation of resources.
An industrial economy simply
cannot be run without the in
formation that prices transmit.
Prices tell consumers and
producers what is scarce and
what is not, what is wanted and
what is not. what will work lor
the benefit of people and what
will not. The free market price
system is the means by which
information scattered among
millions of people is assembled
and transmitted to those who
need it to guide their actions.
Without prices, the vitally im
portant function of the en
trepreneur in putting together
new combinations of labor and
capital to better satisfy con
sumer desires is lost.
It is no accident that socialist
economies in practice are
always fraught with shortages
and queues, with disastrous
projects involving dams or re
fineries or other large-scale
projects, with low productivity,
and with underground free mar

kets. It is also no accident that
relatively successful socialist
economies are those that turn
over major areas, such as farm
ing. to the private sector.
I can hear the objections of
some of the local Stanford so
cialists now: "But we're decen
tralists. we don't want to place
all that power in the hands of the
State, we want to give it to local
groups. Hell, some of us are
even anarchists."
My reply is that they just for
feited the game. For if social
ism means local control, then
they cannot keep it from logical
ly being pushed to the most local
level, the level of the individual.
Every power and responsibility
that they want to give to the lo
cal collective, or tribe, or what
ever they call it. can logically
also be given to the "collective
of one." Then the vote will
always be unanimous.
All that's left to do is spell out
the principles of "socialist indi
vidualism." I would suggest
that only two are needed.
First is the principle of self
ownership: every man and
woman has the absolute right to
control his or her own body and
labor. No person or group of per
sons may invade that self-own
ership.
Second, it follows that if each
individual owns his or her own
labor, then he or she must own
the fruits of that labor, and has
the right to exchange the prod
ucts of his or her labor for the
products of other persons.
We're done. We have arrived
at property rights, the free mar
ket. and the free society via "de
centralist" socialism. The first
principle implies all the person
al freedoms that socialists ap
prove of. and the second princi

pie guarantees that they can be
carried out in practice, in addi
tion to providing the basis for all
real-world prosperity, the free
market.
The local socialists will be
aghast at what I've done, be
cause what I've derived is, of
course, libertarianism; plus
I've shown it to be more radical
than any kind of socialism in the
most basic sense of the word,
which means going to the root.
So my sympathies go out to
Michael Harrington and other
socialists. They are fighting a
last-ditch effort to maintain
their claim on being the most
radical critics of the status-quo,

when they are being outflanked
by the libertarians, who are
equally critical of the Left and
the Right.
The socialists, having no firm
principles to espouse, are re
duced to calling for such things
as a "grass-roots effort to de
fend food stamps." How utterly
devoid of any positive vision
they must be to hold up this
crumb the Corporate State
tosses to its victims as a
progressive institution worth
defending.

student in engineering-econom
ic systems and coordinator of
Stanford Libertarians.)
Poor Michael Harrington.
Mouthing the tired rhetoric of
the Old Left, urging us to prop
up the increasingly tyrannical
welfare state, blaming the oil
companies for everything that
goes wrong — can he really be
serious?
The main error of socialists
like Harrington is the incredible
mismatch of their means to the
ends. Socialism attempts to
achieve liberal ends — personal
freedom, prosperity, peace —
with profoundly conservative
and anti-liberal means — the ex
ercise of state power over the
masses by a ruling elite. By
their strategic embrace of the
Leviathan State, the socialists
place the lives of the many in the
hands of the few. a sure recipe
for despotism.
Of late, the socialists have
tried to remedy this problem by
emphasizing the "democratic"
nature of what they are propo
sing. Harrington says, "Let
those who are affected by the
decisions make the decisions."
Toin Havden wants "economic
democracy." Never mind that
democracy in practice is either
representative democracy — in
which case we get to choose
which tyrant will then exercise
power over us — or "pure" de
mocracy — in which caseerery
thing has to be voted on by eve
ryone and life becomes one
giant political meeting.
What the socialists cannot
jettison, lest they lose their way
entirely, is their opposition to
economic freedom. No matter
what kind of socialist you are,
you cannot support private own
