## Santa Teresa repairs necessary 
### 
Mike Charlson's Opinions col
umn (Daily, Jan. 9) is inac
curate and an unfortunate mis
statement of the reasons behind
recently completed improve
ments to Santa Teresa Street
and those planned for the Press
Courtyard. If Charlson is intent
on a search to unearth adminis
trative waste he would be well
advised to first look a little
further and harder before mak
ing such hollow accusations.
First, to correct factual er
rors: Santa Teresa Street was
not widened but was in fact nar
rowed at two points. There is no
chilled water line under the
street nor any plans to dig up the
new street to install one in the
future. The removal of the
Press Courtyard wall was not a
mistake. The tenants of the
Press Building who may now en
joy a view of the street and a
quieter working environment
will argue this point. The re
moval of the unstacked pallets
and clean-up of the loading dock
is more than a "fat chance" but
part of the program to upgrade
the Courtyard.
The "pretty" curbs are for
the safe separation of pedestri
ans and motor vehicles, particu
larly at intersections and for
protection of the street trees,
not merely decoration. They
also serve to protect the road
from erosion and deterioration
caused bv water runoff. The
cost of landscaping for the
project was insignificant com
pared to that of providing the
new asphalt. Finally, Opera
tions and Maintenance (Utili
ties Emergencies) can be
reached by phone 24 hours a day
by dialing 7-2281
More importantly Charlson
failed to consider, and did not

ask during our discussion, the
rationale and alternatives
which were reviewed for the
two projects in question. It
would seem that these should
have prefaced any accusation of
wasteful spending. Both
projects have been thoroughly
reviewed and planned. Every
effort has been made to provide
the most cost effective and effi
cient solutions.
The reconstruction of Santa
Teresa Street, for example, was
weighed specifically against the
costs of doing nothing or pro
ceeding with minor or interim
improvements and risking a
complete failure of the road bed
sometime in the near future — a
much more expensive alter
native in light of rising asphalt
and labor costs as well as risk
ing a greatly expanded project
scope and price overall. The
construction technique used
was in fact innovative and
chosen so that the road bed
would be preserved thus allow
ing the University to defer the
expense of a major street re
placement project.
The project also provided an
opportunity to efficiently coor
dinate with other improvements
planned for the area, such as,
sidewalks and lights. Building

them now as part of the road
project saves having to tear up
the street later, thus can hardly
be regarded as wasteful. Of
course, this all presumes that
having a pleasant, safe, well
lighted place to walk, and a
street without potholes is to the
advantage of the University.
Likewise, the Press
Courtyard project is a long over
due renewal of a terribly de
teriorated University asset, and
the fulfillment of a long-stand
ing obligation by the University
to the tenants of the space (fac
ulty. students and staff) to pro
vide them with an adequate
working environment. Surely
anyone who has seen the
Courtyard recently will under
stand this. Here again the waste
would be in doing nothing, or
postponing it further, rather
than providing the bare bones
improvements which are being
planned.
No doubt there is adminis
trative waste somewhere and
we should all be vigilant in its
abatement at all times. Sorry,
Mike, but because of your waste
of valuable editorial space, this
time the Golden Fleece Award
goes to you!

protection of the street trees,
not merely decoration. They
also serve to protect the road
from erosion and deterioration
caused bv water runoff. The
cost of landscaping for the
project was insignificant com
pared to that of providing the
new asphalt. Finally, Opera

More importantly Charlson
failed to consider, and did not

ask during our discussion, the
rationale and alternatives
which were reviewed for the
two projects in question. It
would seem that these should
have prefaced any accusation of
wasteful spending. Both
projects have been thoroughly
reviewed and planned. Every
effort has been made to provide
the most cost effective and effi
cient solutions.
The reconstruction of Santa
Teresa Street, for example, was
weighed specifically against the
costs of doing nothing or pro
ceeding with minor or interim
improvements and risking a
complete failure of the road bed
sometime in the near future — a
much more expensive alter
native in light of rising asphalt
and labor costs as well as risk
ing a greatly expanded project
scope and price overall. The
construction technique used
was in fact innovative and
chosen so that the road bed
would be preserved thus allow
ing the University to defer the
expense of a major street re
placement project.
The project also provided an
opportunity to efficiently coor
dinate with other improvements
planned for the area, such as,
sidewalks and lights. Building

them now as part of the road
project saves having to tear up
the street later, thus can hardly
be regarded as wasteful. Of
course, this all presumes that
having a pleasant, safe, well
lighted place to walk, and a
street without potholes is to the
advantage of the University.
Likewise, the Press
Courtyard project is a long over
due renewal of a terribly de
teriorated University asset, and
the fulfillment of a long-stand
ing obligation by the University
to the tenants of the space (fac
ulty. students and staff) to pro
vide them with an adequate
working environment. Surely
anyone who has seen the
Courtyard recently will under
stand this. Here again the waste
would be in doing nothing, or
postponing it further, rather
than providing the bare bones
improvements which are being
planned.
No doubt there is adminis
trative waste somewhere and
we should all be vigilant in its
abatement at all times. Sorry,
Mike, but because of your waste
of valuable editorial space, this
time the Golden Fleece Award
goes to you!
