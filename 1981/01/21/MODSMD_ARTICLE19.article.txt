# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Henry Organ Protect staff from staff abuse 
### 
I read with enthusiasm Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's an
nouncement that a task force
was being established to ex
amine Stanford's organization,
and the expression of his con
cern about the gap that exists
between academic and service
cultures. I compliment him for
his decision and insight. I ex
pressed a similar concern about
such a gap to the University
community two years ago:
"... Stanford is often com
plimented for the quality of its
faculty, but the faculty is not
complemented by the quality of
its staff, particularly in matters
of employment management
and sensitivity to interpersonal
relations (Daily, Nov. 16, 1978).

I respectfully view different
ly some of the president's ra
tionale, however, if I under
stand him correctly. I believe
the principal problem is not
what the academe expects of
and how it relates to staff; rath
er, I believe the greater prob
lem to be intra-service.
The gap of concern is between
management and the rank and
file, or expressed differently,
staff-on-staff crime. The rise in
interest in unions and turnover
at Stanford is not due in large
measure to faculty abuse, but
mainly to staff abuse of staff.
Personnel actions are made
by staff against staff. They
often take the form of agism,
nepotism, racism, and sexism.
(On this score, I note that the
first four appointees to this task
force are white male, a com
position which I'm sure the
president will correct.*)
I believe that staff members
are willing and capable of work
ing harder and longer, under
any organizational structure, if
they are treated fairly,
equitably, with respect,
without harrassment, with
competitive salaries, and when
Napoleonic management is re
placed with team-work and
esprit de corps. I am also a bit at
a variance with the president in
regards to accountability within
staff ranks. Service culture
management is not, in practice,
accountable for its actions
toward staff; my suspicion is
that a more effective accoun
tability mechanism does exist
within the academic ranks, if it
is needed. Those internal agen

cies responsible for protecting
the rights and improving the
working conditions of all staff
have abandoned their responsi
bilities and, thus, their con
stitutencies.
Included among those in
ternal agencies are Employee
Relations, the Legal Staff, and
the Affirmative Action Office.
They have become impotent,
negligent or accomplices in im
proper actions by management
against staff. Unfair grievance
procedures and evaluations,
phony finalist pools, preselec
tions of posted positions, salary
discrimination, unwarranted
disciplinary actions and
threats, spoils systems, among
others, have become frequently
employed instruments of per
sonel abuse. If professional
competence among staff has in
creased at Stanford, it has not
been accompanied by an in
crease in professional ethics.
Again, I wish to congratulate
President Kennedy for taking
this initiative. If I were allowed
to make one specific recom
mendation to him on this issue I
think it would be to have a gen
eral house-cleaning in Per
sonnel Office management, and
have that office report directly
to the President. In so doing,
perhaps that office will be in a
better position, and more in
clined, to protect the rights of
all employees, which would ul
timately resolve many of the
problems the president has ex
pressed.
