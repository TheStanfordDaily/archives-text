Law School Dean Charles Meyers told the Daily yester
day that he was being considered by the Reagan adminis
tration for a government post, but he said he has
"withdrawn his name from consideration."
Meyers refuse to discuss the details of his consideration
on the grounds that such discussion might be "very em
barrassing' ' to the people considering him.
The law school dean said he told Reagan officials he
would not go to Washington to interview for the post, and
thus effectively withdrew his name from consideration.
Meyers, at the law school since 1975, began teaching at
the University in 1962.The author of several books on sub
jects ranging from legal education to petroleum litigation,
Meyers has taught classes in property law, natural re
source and environmental protection law.
Before coming to the University, Meyers taught at the

universities of Texas, Minnesota, Cornell and Columbia.
There have been recent reports that another University
law professor, John Kaplan, may also have received a job
offer from the Reagan administration. Kaplan, who
served on a Reagan task force on the administration of jus
tice, refused to comment about the rumor.
"I have no comment at all on that," he said.
Kaplan is an international authority on criminal law.
His area of expertise includes laws relating to drug use
and drug control.
Two other law school professors, John Friedenthal and
William Baxter, have been named by observers as possi
bilities for job offers from the Republican administration.
However, Friedenthal said, "I'm not looking for a job,
and. as far as I know, no one wants me for one."
Baxter also refused to comment on the matter.
