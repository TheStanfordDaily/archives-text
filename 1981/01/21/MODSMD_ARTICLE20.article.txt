## My five minutes in the Oval Office 
### 
Chances are this week you
were wishing you could expedite
the Carter exit from Washing
ton, D C., or wishing you could
prevent the Reagan arrival to
Pennsylvania Avenue. Why did
you harbor such sentiment?
Simple. Either you were disap
pointed with the sequels of yes
terday or you aren't enamored
by the prospects for tomorrow.
In fact, you may even think
that you could solve the nation's
woes if given the opportunity to
exercise the necessary author
ity. O.K. I'll admit I entertain
such aspirations on occasion.
I would like just five minutes
in the Oval Office. That's all.
My action may not seem affable
to constituents, but reelection is
not a consideration for someone
holding a five-minute term.
Besides. I posit that a year lat
er. the American consumer
would invite me back for anoth
er term. So, now, what would I
do?
I would restore competition
by calling for immediate decon
trol of domestic crude oil.
That's it. Keep reading, you

might like it.
Means to achieve freedom
from controls become feasible
in September, when the price
controls are due to expire. Right
now, current price controls
keep the domestic crude oil
prices $6 a barrel below world
levels. Our oil imports are about
half of our domestic consump
tion, yet consumers are misled
by the relationship of the
domestic market to the world
market. If prices are kept below
those in world markets, infla
tionary domestic shortages can
result.
Under gradual decontrol, the
price increase will come slowly,
up about 22 cents a gallon by Oc
tober, assuming OPEC doesn't
continue to elevate prices.
About 10 cents of this would re
flect OPEC increases, and 12
cents would be the effect of de
control. With immediate decon
trol, that 12-cent increase would
occur earlier than October.
But decontrol today may
mean cheaper prices in October
than under gradual decontrol.
Higher prices at the pump

would reduce U.S. consumption
(you may start to ride your bike
to Bud's) and encourage con
servation and investigation into
alternative energy sources. (It
is here that the windfall profits
tax is an impediment to advan
cement. )
We see that world supplies
are stretched thin by the mid
east crisis. Decontrol would re
lease some pressure on the
world oil market, thus reducing
the threat of further world oil
price hikes. Decontrol would be
the most efficient means of re
ducing the nation's dependence
on foreign oil and would help
narrow the trade gap.
The question is, do you want
to pay a bit more now, or two
bits more later?
Because of the threat of short
ages resulting from the Iraqi-
Iranian war, oil companies may
want to maintain large inven
tories to provide for winter.
We'd see that effect in higher
summer oil prices. Decontrol
today would avert what is bound
to be higher prices later. Hence,
prices are apt to be lower in Oc
tober, and the inflationary ef
fect less pronounced, under de
control.
Controls may seem political
ly effective, as they appear to

suppress inflation on the sur
face and they may protect the
success of the politician in of
fice. Mainly, though, they serve
merely as a lid, which bursts
once controls ar N e removed,
causing more rapid inflation
than would have occurred
without controls.
The past is proof that in the
long run. controls distort and
disrupt the economy, causing
higher prices than would have
developed under free market
competition. With controls, free
market price signals vanish and
shortages become frequent.
Regulation is not the device for
tackling our domestic and in
ternational problems. Decon
trol is.
My five minutes have
elapsed.
"Whew, get her out," shriek
those who consider only the
short run. Yet those who con
sider the long run simply smile.
They smile because they are
content that the Reagans have
moved into the White House.
And they smile because my five
minute scenario is but one item
on the Reagan plan for the na
tion.
