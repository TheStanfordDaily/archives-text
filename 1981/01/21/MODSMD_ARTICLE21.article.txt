Transitional
I found Charles Ridley's
modest proposal (Daily, Jan. 6)
regarding Transitional Pro
fessorships to be innovative and
thought-provoking, and am sur
prised that it has failed to excite
comment among the Stanford
community. The plan's most
brilliant feature is undoubtedly
the stripping of credentials
from every Ph D. at the end of
his or her transitional academic
appointment. At one stroke this
measure would not only prevent
the ex-scholar from devoting
years of his life to a doomed
quest for a tenure-track job, but
it would also eliminate the stig
ma of overqualification from
his dossier when he turned to the
"real" world.
I believe one modification to
the plan is in order, however.
First, while it is indeed com
mendable to offer all young
scholars an opportunity to fol
low their chosen profession, in
practice this may be more cruel
than kind. Teaching is like sex:
once experienced, it tends to be
come difficult to do without.

There is an argument to be
made that they are most for
tunate who know not what they
are missing.
Secondly, the retraining of
tenured faculty as required by
the Ridley plan would be likely
to prove time-consuming and
minimally cost-effective.
Therefore I propose an alter
native. Any professor who could
be certified as a genuine gen
tleman and scholar (defined as
one whose work is capable of
being impassioned and dis
passionate at once, and whose
criticism can be expressed
without sneering) would be de
clared a National Monument.
The rest would be classified as
Homo Academicus and would
continue to be retained by their
respective institutions.
Following my plan, every
new Ph.D. would be assigned a
Transitional Professorship in
these institutions and would
function as a regular faculty
member in every way except
that he would do no teaching. At
the end of two or three years,
the Transitional Professors
would be able to accept the pros
pect of jobs outside academia
without excessive anxiety;
many, indeed, might positively
welcome it.
With the exception of the stu
dents (who are, of course, a mi
nor consideration), I believe
that all segments of a university
community would be satisfac
torily accommodated by this
plan.
