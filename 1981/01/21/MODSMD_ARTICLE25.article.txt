## Wrestlers give too much in 30-21 loss to Fresno St. 
### Mark Kerber 
The Stanford wrestling
squad, after forfeiting three
weights, lost to Fresno State
30-21 last night at Encina Gym.
Despite the loss, coach Chris
Horpel thought the meet repre
sented an improved effort for
the Cardinals. "In the seven
weights that we wrestled, we
wbn four and outscored them
2M2." Horpel said. "I also saw
a-lot of improvement in our at
tiiude."
[The improvement in attitude
showed clearly. The entire team
was more aggressive than they
have been in recent weeks.
Leading the turnaround was
150-pounder Bruce Rubin, who
ground out a 6-0 lead before

burying his opponent in 2:44.
Freshman Tom Mullen, whose
opponent was twice called for
stalling, needed 4:38 to capture
and pin him. Predictable Doug
Perkins also earned a fall for
the Cards. Perkins built a 16-2
lead before finishing his foe in
3:50.
Although he won only 8-7, 126-
pounder Tim Daniels provided
most of the night's fireworks. In
a wild, seesaw match. Daniels
went from a 2-0 lead to a 6-2 defi
cit during the second period,
then used two last-period
takedowns to retake the match.
Daniels has now won six in a row
and holds a 16-2 edge in
takedowns in his last four
matches.

The three losing wrestlers
could not keep the consistency
needed through three rounds to
win At 134 pounds. Craig
Thrower gave up critical back
points early in a 14-4 loss, but
showed good mobility. Abie
DeAnda. weighing 142 pounds,
gave up seven takedowns en
route to a 19-6 loss, but moved
well from underneath, scoring
four escapes and a reversal.
In the 167-pound class, Karl
Bazin lost 10-4 after being tied
late in the second period. Bazin.
