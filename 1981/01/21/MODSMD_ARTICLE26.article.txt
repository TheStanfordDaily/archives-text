### 
'New Orleans (AP) — Don't
tell Philadelphia Eagles' of
fensive guard Woody Peoples
that football is supposed to be a
young man's game.
Peoples. 37 years old. is an in
tegral part of the offensive line
of the National Football Con
ference champions who will
.take on the Oakland Raiders in
Super Bowl XV here Sunday.
Peoples just shrugs his shoul
ders when he's asked what he's
doing in the trenches at his age.
"I know that a lot of people
have said I was washed up three
or four years ago." said Peo
ples. who plaved semi-pro foot
ball in 1965.
"People have a tendency to
feel that I can't get the job done.
But age is an individual thing."
Peoples noted yesterday after a
workout in the Superdome.
"1 can honestly say I've
played great footbail this year."
boasted the 260-pound player
who helps open those big holes

for running backs such as
Wilbert Montgomery.
"Contrary to public opinion
I'm not run down. I feel good
physically and mentally. I can't
explain it. God just blessed me
physically." he said.
Peoples says that despite his
advanced age for the tough
game of professional football,
he doesn't find it any tougher.
"I play because I enjoy it.
Sometimes I moan and groan
but I enjoy it." Peoples said "I
just do what I have to do. try and
improve as the season goes
along."
Peoples isn't expecting any
picnic against Oakland.
"I have a great amount of re
spect for the Raiders. If they
weren't a fine team they
wouldn't be there Sunday," Peo
ples declared.
"They're a very physical
team." he recalled from the
Eagles' 10-7 triumph over Oak
land in the regular season.

Oakland vs. Philadelphia

New Orleans (AP) — The
Oakland Raiders believe their
edge in Super Bowl experience
will pay off against the Philadel
phia Eagles.
"It should help us. but I'm not
going to say why. Philly could
use my answer," defensive line
man John Matuszak said yester
day before the Raiders held
their first workout of Super
Bowl week.
He is one of 11 current
Raiders who played on the Su
per Bowl championship team of
four years ago. A 12th player,
starting cornerback Dwayne
O'Steen. was with the Los An
geles Rams in last year's Super
Bowl.
Gene UpShaw, who will be
playing in his third title game
Sunday, offered one tip to Phila
delphia's first-time entry. It in
volves the National Football
League's Friday night party,
the elaborate annual affair
which this year is being held at a

riverfront New Orleans hotel.
Upshaw's advise: Forget it.
"That party's not for players.
It's for (NFL Commissioner)
Pete Rozelle and 3 000 (really
5 000) of his close personal
friends, and it costs the league
(close to) $100,000. You never
see a player at the party," Up
shaw said. "We'll have our own
party."
Upshaw went to his first Su
per Bowl as a rookie with Oak
land's 1967 American Football
League champions, who lost to
the NFL champion Green Bay
Packers in Miami.
A 1 Davis, managing general
partner of the Raiders, re
called: "We were an awfully
green team, hadn't even been in
the playoffs before that Super
Bowl.
"We treated it like a college
bowl game, and it wasn't."
"That's right," said Upshaw.
"I even watched the halftime
show."
