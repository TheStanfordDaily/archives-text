# Cards visit Hile and Dons tonight
## 
### Bill Beyda 
Presented with the prospect
of facing one of the best players
in the nation, Stanford's wom
en's basketball team travels to
San Francisco tonight to play
USF in a NorCal Conference
game.
The Cardinals will have to
control Mary Hile, USF's star
senior who recently scored her
20()0th career point
"She's the greatest player in
our league." said Stanford head
coach Dotty McCrea.
Part of the Cards' game plan
is to control the boards, accord
ing to McCrea. "If we execute
well, we definitely can beat
them In fact, we're due to beat
them." said McCrea. referring
to their four previous losses to
USF.
Stanford will start the game
with a 1-3-1 zone defense. If the
Cards are unable to control the
game's tempo, they might
switch to man-to-man coverage,
which proved effective in Satur
day's victory over Fresno State.
McCrea is very optimistic
about the team's chances of
making the AIAW Region 8 tour

nament, to be held at Pep
perdine in March. The team has
qualified for the regionals three
years in a row.
"In my five years of coaching
at Stanford, this is one of the
best groups I've seen," said
McCrea. "Win or lose, I find
myself looking forward to work
ing with these people. It took
five years for that to happen,
but it finally did."
In order to qualify for the re
gionals, the Cards will have to
finish in first or second place.
First place would guarantee
them a spot, and second place
would give them a chance at an
at-large berth (similar to a
wild-card berth in pro football).
"We'll just have to take each
game one at a time, and go for
it," said McCrea. If the Cards
can perform as well as they did
against Fresno State last week
end. it will be a very successful
season.
The Cards' conference record
is 1-1, and 10-8 overall. Stanford
visits UOP Saturday and re
turns to Maples Pavilion to play
Santa Clara and Fresno State
next week.
