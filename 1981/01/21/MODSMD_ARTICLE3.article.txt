# Lake Lagunita might stay dry this spring

University sailors, windsurfers and
lake-lovers may have to venture
elsewhere for recreation unless a sub
stantial amount of rain falls on this
area within the next month.
Presently unfilled Lake Lagunita
awaits at least five inches of rainfall
before the 100 million gallons of water
needed to fill the lake can begin to
flow, according to University Direc
tor of Utilities Gerald Ostrander.
University-owned reservoirs Lake
Felt and Lake Searsville, whose over
flow drains into Lake Lagunita, re
main only two-thirds full due to a
drought which has dropped less than
two inches of rain on the Peninsula
since July. This figure is four inches

below normal rainfall for mid-Janu
ary, and the lowest since 1976-77 when
Lake Lagunita last remained unfilled,
according to Joe Carrington, Univer
sity water systems manager.
The amount of rain required to fill
the reservoirs will need to come in a
relatively short period of time. Land
surrounding the reservoirs must first
become saturated before run-off will
find its way to the reservoirs. Small
amounts of rain at distant intervals
will be soaked up by the earth, Car
rington said.
Professional meterologists em
ployed by the University predict a
heavier than normal rainfall for the
end of January and February. How
ever, if February does not produce the
expected amount of rain, spring lake

activities may suffer, said Car
rington, since March and April are
predicted to be drier than usual this
year.
Because the drainage of Lake
Lagunita usually begins in June,
spring rainfall may be too late to begin
filling the lake. A recent investigation
into the possibilities of a year-round
lake revealed that fresh water from
the public supply would have to be
pumped in. Findings revealed that ap
proximately one million gallons of
lake water seeps into the earth daily.
Refilling the lake without sufficient
rainfall would thus be impractical,
said Ostrander.
While officials wait for rain, Uni
versity water utilities personnel are

attempting to meet state dam require
ments imposed on Lake Lagunita. A
concrete flume which will channel ex
cess water out of the lake in case of
significant overflow from the reser
voirs is being built at the northern end
of the lake to meet these require
ments, said Ostrander.
In addition, officials are concerned
with a section of tht dirt dam behind
the boathouse which may need rein
forcement against the pressures of
lake water. To decrease the possi
bility of cracks in this section, the
level of the lake will be kept one to two
feet lower than normal.
According to Ostrander, the state
requirements do not apply to this sea
son and thus will not delay filling of the
lake if sufficient rain falls.
