# Sun Devils crack top 10; OSU No. 1
## 
### Associated Press 
Many college basketball
coaches dread being ranked in
the top 10, but Arizona State's
Ned Wulk isn't one of them.
The Sun Devils jumped from
No. 12 to seventh in The As
sociated Press college basket
ball poll Monday as Oregon
State and Virginia maintained
to the top two positions, respec
tively, and Wake Forest and De-
Paul shared the No. 3 slot.
"It's ridiculous to say you're
not interested in the poll," Wulk
said Monday night. "It's a
motivator for your team. The
kids and fans really take it seri
ously."
So do the Sun Devils oppo
nents.
"Once you get up there, eve
rybody is shooting for you. So I
just keep telling my players
they're just as good as the night
before," Wulk said.
The Sun Devils were very
good last week, beating then-
No.B UCLA 78-74 in triple over
time on Friday and whipping
Southern Cal 69-55 the next

night.
"One of our goals this year is
to go to Philadelphia," said
Wulk, referring to the site of the
NCAA finals in late March.
And the way the Sun Devils
are playing, they may want to
book the reservations now.
Oregoh State, 13-0] collected
40 first-place votes in the voting
by a nationwide panel of sports
writers and broadcasters. Vir
ginia, 14-0, was tabbed on 19
