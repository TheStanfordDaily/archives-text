Reagan picks last economic adviser
Washington — President Ronald Reagan has completed
the selection of key economic advisers by choosing Mur
ray Weidenbaum. a professor at Washington University
and an expert on business deregulation, to head the presi
dent s Council of Economic Advisers, according to a Rea
gan White House official.
Weidenbaum. 53, one of Reagan's economic advisers in
the presidential campaign, headed a transition team on
regulatory issues and was regarded as a top contender for
a senior post in the new administration. The appointment
of the chairman and two other members of the CEA
dragged on throughout the transition period, however, for
reasons that still are unclear. Some saw the delay as re
flecting a possible downgrading of the CEA chairman's

post in the Reagan administration.
Weidenbaum, however, is said to be satisfied about his
CEA role following a meeting Monday with Reagan on the
structure of administation economic policymaking and
specific policy issues. As chairman of the CEA, Weiden
baum will be chief economic adviser to the president and
the cabinet, sources said. The new Treasury secretary,
Donald Regan, former chairman of Merrill Lynch Inc.,
has been designated chief economic spokesman for the ad
ministration. The remaining two positions on the CEA
have not yet been filled.
Clean Air Act allows energy projects
Washington — The Clean Air Act is broad enough to al
low construction of all the energy development projects
the country has in mind, despite industry complaints to the
contrary, according to a draft of the final report from the
National Commission on Air Quality.
The still unpublished draft agrees, however, with in
dustrial complaints that some highly controversial parts
of the Clean Air Act have been fairly useless and other
aspects could be streamlined or eliminated.
Environmental groups have been holding briefings,
business organizations have running seminars around the
country and trade associations are cranking out thick
analyses on the issues concealed behind each semicolon of
the complex law.
Senators protest Haig appointees
Washington — Even before Alexander Haig is con
firmed as secretary of state, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)
and 16 other conservative senators have complained about
his apparent choices to fill secondand third-level jobs at
the State Department.
The way it looks now, the senators said, virtually all of
those posts will be filled by holdover members of the
Carter administration or other Democrats, or by liberal
Republicans from the days of President Gerald Ford and
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, rather than persons
dedicated to carrying out President Ronald Reagan's poli
cies.
