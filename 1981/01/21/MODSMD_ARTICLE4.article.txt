# Scholars debate Russian attitude toward Poland

All of the participants in a panel dis
cussion held here Monday on the cur
rent crisis in Poland agreed that the
possibility of Soviet invasion is real
but disagreed on the odds of such Sovi
et action.
There are similarities in the present
situation to the one prior to the in
vasion of Czechoslovakia, in both the
build up of Soviet forces and the ideol
ogical justification of "fraternal as
sistance" in the Eastern-bloc press,
said Prof. Jiri Valenta of the Naval
Postgraduate School of Monterey.
' The chances are 50-50 that the Soviet
Union will invade," he said.
UCLA Prof. Andrzej Korbonski was
pessimistic about the chances of Sovi
et action in the Eastern European
country, pointing to the disunity of the
workers and the party as a possible

pretext for a Soviet invasion.
"This is the most intolerable situ
ation that the Soviets have had to
face,' said Prof Kenneth Jowitt of UC
Berkeley. Jowitt said that should the
US become involved militarily or re
nounce detente, it could make in
vasion worthwhile by lowering "the
threshold" of the costs the Soviets
would have to pay for a Polish in
vasion
Solidarity, the new independent un
ion, which represents 12 million Polish
workers and has taken on a role of an
opposition party, could be "the wedge
that could mean the end of communist
systems." according to Emeritus
Prof. Alex Dragnich of Vanderbilt
University.
Korbonski said that Poland's crisis
was "a crisis of modernization "that
all developing countries experience.

"In the early 70s it looked as if the
Gierek government would be able to
accomplish what it promised,"
Korbonski said.
"Between 1971 and 1975, Poland
achieved one of the largest growth
rates in the world of around 13
percent,"he continued
The problem was that the mod
ernization of Poland, undertaken with
large loans from the West, concen
trated on industry while agriculture,
communications and management
were ignored, according to Korbonski
Poland has had to rely increasingly
on food imports.The lack of attention
to modernizing the "infrastructure"
and management resulted in "a rapid
ly declining growth rate to 2 or 3
percent by the late 70 s," Korbonski
said.
Dragnich said that in the last year

the gross national product has
dropped 2 percent and inflation has
risen to an annual rate of 20 percent.
The Polish government's plan that
western loans would be repaid with
revenues from exports never materi
alized. according to Korbonski. By
last summer, the debt to western in
dustrialized countries totaled $20
billion.
The government, under pressure
from western countries, announced
another wave of price increases, said
Korbonski.
"In July it looked as if things were
going to be settled peacefully,"
Korbonski said The government man
aged to bargain with strikers
piecemeal by negotiating individual
contracts.
It was not until the government
