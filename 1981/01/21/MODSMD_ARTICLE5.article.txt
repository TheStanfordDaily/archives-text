# Hostages in Germany; Iranian funds returned
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Free at last, the 52
American hostages who endured so
much for so long at the hands of taunt
ing Iranian kidnappers traveled with
tears and laughter last night toward a
nation that never forgot them during
their 444 days of captivity.
The flight to freedom began 33
minutes after Ronald Reagan as
sumed the presidency from Jimmy
Carter, who had devoted his last hours
in office to turning national humil
iation into what he called "this day of
joy and thanksgiving."
First the journey was to Algeria,
the North African nation that acted as
middleman in negotiating the agree
ment exchanging frozen Iranian gold
and bank deposits for the hostages' re
lease. Then, with Thanksgiving din
ners of turkey and the trimmings en
route, it was on to a U.S. military hos
pital in Wiesbaden, West Germany,
for several days of rest before the 50
men and 2women head for home.
The first of two U.S. Air Force C-9A
transports carrying the hostages to
Germany landed at 6.44 a.m. (12:44
EST). Former Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance and Walter Stoessel Jr.,
the U.S. ambassador to West Germa
ny, greeted the hostages.
The second plane landed a few
minutes later. Former Deputy Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher, the
chief negotiator in securing their re
lease, was aboard that flight with half
of the hostages.

From the beginning of their
odvssey, Americans joined in sponta
neous celebration with silent prayers,
the pealing of church bells and a
cacophony of sirens and honking
horns.
American's first glimpse of the
freed hostages came via satellite tele
vision transmissions when they
stepped from an Algerian airliner in
Algiers eight hours after leaving
Tehran amidst shouts ofc "Down with
America"from their militant cap
tors.
There were 52 faces wreathed in
smiles, and animated talk and
laughter, as some flashed "V" for vic
tory signs. The first two off the plane
— political officer Elizabeth Anne
Swift and cultural attache Kathryn
Koob — wore in the hair the yellow rib
bons that at home had symbolized a
nation's hope for their safe return.
Christopher
Christopher repeatedly received
warm hugs as he stood on a rain-slick
airport runway. "We are very glad to
be here, believe me." said Robert
Ode. at 62 the oldest of the hostages.
Christopher, who four years ago left
his Los Angeles law practice to be
come the State Department's N0.2 of
ficial during the Carter adminis
tration, told the hostages: "You are
back home and safely in our hands.
This event answers our prayers."
Those words brought the hostages to
their feet with loud applause, and
Bruce Laingen, the ranking American
diplomat among them, said: 'Thank
you for the flight to freedom."
Carter, whose crushing loss of the
presidency stemmed in no small part
from voter frustration over his seem
ing inability to solve the hostage
crisis, was to fly to Germany early to
day to represent the nation — at Rea
gan's request — in a high-level wel
come for the freed hostages.
Standing before congressional lead
ers at an inaugural luncheon. Reagan
lifted his glass of California wine and
said: . to conclude. . with thanks
to Almighty God ... I have been given
a tagline.the get-off line that everyone
wants for the end of a toast or a speech
or anything else:
"Some 30 minutes ago. the planes
bearing our prisoners left Iranian air
space and they're now free of Iran.
"So we can all drink to this one — to
all of us together. Doing what we all
know we can do to make this country
what it should be, what it always has
been."
National elation
The applause that greeted Reagan's
remarks echoed a nation's elation, a
sense of relief and joy that swelled on
the Main Street of Plains. Ga., where
Carter returned on a rainy afternoon
as a private citizen.
There, his voice breaking with emo
tion, his face lined with fatigue.
Carter said that he had just gotten
word from Christopher that the
hostages were "alive, well and free "
Carter was on the inaugural stand,
watching his successor take the oath
of office, when the hostages were pre
paring to depart Tehran's airport,
where chants of "Down with Reagan''
and "Down with America" rang
through the evening.
Canadian reporters who watched
what Tehran television showed of the

departure said that most of the Ameri
cans looked pale and wore the empty,
resigned expressions of prisoners as
they were led one-bv-one from a bus
through a crowd of Islamic revolu
tionary guards at the airport.
"There was no joy on the faces."
one correspondent said in his dis
patch.
Laughing and crying
But in the final minutes of their cap
tivity. the Americans were laughing,
crying and hugging one another, ac
cording to Erik Lang, the Swiss am
bassador in Tehran who was in
terviewed by ABC News.
The agreement between Iran and
the United States involved a com
plicated swap of the hostages for just
under $8 billion in frozen Iranian as
sets — money originally held in Iran's
accounts with a dozen major U.S.
banks and the Federal Reserve, but
also money that, over the past 14
months, the banks had used to make
loans and other banking deals.
Thus, on its face the agreement that
was initialed in Algiers early Monday
morning amounted to a banking trans
action — intricate, and on an un
precedented scale, but nothing more
than a transfer of assets from one ac
count to another
Because of a technical dispute over
the wording of one of the documents
needed to implement the huge fund
transfer, the normally serene world of
international finance became for the
space of 48 hours a setting of high dra
ma.
The first sign of a hitch in the agree
ment came late Monday when of
ficials of the Iranian Central Bank, the
Bank Markazi. objected to the lan
guage of a technical document known
in banking circles as a payment order.
According to U.S. officials present
at the Treasury during the long Mon
day night of negotiation — the night

when the clock ticked away to the end
of Carter's presidency — the complex
11-page order was necessary for Iran,
under the agreement with the United
States, to order the U.S. banks to
transfer about $5.5 billion of frozen as
sets plus interest to a Bank of England
escrow account from the foreign
branches of the 12 American banks.
Bank's arcane world
The banks had suggested the ar
rangement that, in their arcane world,
was regarded as a routine payment or
der that would take care of this techni
cal need.
But the Bank Markazi, as its direc
tor, Ali Reza Nobari. later explained,
objected to language in the order that
in his view limited the total assets to
be transferred.
The Iranians had insisted that for
the hostage deal to go through, the to
tal amount of money to be placed in
escrow with the Bank of England had
to total at least $7,955 billion. But be
cause the payment order seemed to
the Iranians to limit the assets
transfer. Nobari refused to sign it.
Accordingly, the whole complicated
transfer mechanism shuddered to a
halt. Money that was supposed to be
flowing from the 12 banks and their
branches did not move into the Feder
al Reserve Bank of New York. The
escrow account in London sat dormant
with only about $2.4 billion, the sum
moved there earlier from the Federal
Reserve's own holdings in Iranian as
sets and gold.
The deadlock was broken about 2.30
a.m. EST yesterday when British law
yers for the Bank Markazi came up
with a formula to change the language
of the payment order. Nobari ac
cepted it.and soon afterward, the
American banks, through their repre
sentatives sitting at the Treasury dur
ing the second successive long night of
negotiation, agreed.

Reserve's own holdings in Iranian as
sets and gold.
The deadlock was broken about 2.30
a.m. EST yesterday when British law
yers for the Bank Markazi came up
with a formula to change the language
of the payment order. Nobari ac
cepted it.and soon afterward, the
American banks, through their repre
sentatives sitting at the Treasury dur
ing the second successive long night of
negotiation, agreed.
Washington — Free at last, the 52
American hostages who endured so
much for so long at the hands of taunt
ing Iranian kidnappers traveled with
tears and laughter last night toward a
nation that never forgot them during
their 444 days of captivity.
The flight to freedom began 33
minutes after Ronald Reagan as
sumed the presidency from Jimmy
Carter, who had devoted his last hours
in office to turning national humil
iation into what he called "this day of
joy and thanksgiving."
First the journey was to Algeria,
the North African nation that acted as
middleman in negotiating the agree
ment exchanging frozen Iranian gold
and bank deposits for the hostages' re
lease. Then, with Thanksgiving din
ners of turkey and the trimmings en
route, it was on to a U.S. military hos
pital in Wiesbaden, West Germany,
for several days of rest before the 50
men and 2women head for home.
The first of two U.S. Air Force C-9A
transports carrying the hostages to
Germany landed at 6.44 a.m. (12:44
EST). Former Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance and Walter Stoessel Jr.,
the U.S. ambassador to West Germa
ny, greeted the hostages.
The second plane landed a few
minutes later. Former Deputy Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher, the
chief negotiator in securing their re
lease, was aboard that flight with half
of the hostages.

From the beginning of their
odvssey, Americans joined in sponta
neous celebration with silent prayers,
the pealing of church bells and a
cacophony of sirens and honking
horns.
American's first glimpse of the
freed hostages came via satellite tele
vision transmissions when they
stepped from an Algerian airliner in
Algiers eight hours after leaving
Tehran amidst shouts ofc "Down with
America"from their militant cap
tors.
There were 52 faces wreathed in
smiles, and animated talk and
laughter, as some flashed "V" for vic
tory signs. The first two off the plane
— political officer Elizabeth Anne
Swift and cultural attache Kathryn
Koob — wore in the hair the yellow rib
bons that at home had symbolized a
nation's hope for their safe return.
Christopher
Christopher repeatedly received
warm hugs as he stood on a rain-slick
airport runway. "We are very glad to
be here, believe me." said Robert
Ode. at 62 the oldest of the hostages.
Christopher, who four years ago left
his Los Angeles law practice to be
come the State Department's N0.2 of
ficial during the Carter adminis
tration, told the hostages: "You are
back home and safely in our hands.
This event answers our prayers."
Those words brought the hostages to
their feet with loud applause, and
Bruce Laingen, the ranking American
diplomat among them, said: 'Thank
you for the flight to freedom."
Carter, whose crushing loss of the
presidency stemmed in no small part
from voter frustration over his seem
ing inability to solve the hostage
crisis, was to fly to Germany early to
day to represent the nation — at Rea
gan's request — in a high-level wel
come for the freed hostages.
Standing before congressional lead

lifted his glass of California wine and
said: . to conclude. . with thanks

"So we can all drink to this one — to
all of us together. Doing what we all
know we can do to make this country
what it should be, what it always has
been."
National elation
The applause that greeted Reagan's
remarks echoed a nation's elation, a
sense of relief and joy that swelled on
the Main Street of Plains. Ga., where
Carter returned on a rainy afternoon
as a private citizen.
There, his voice breaking with emo
tion, his face lined with fatigue.
Carter said that he had just gotten
word from Christopher that the
hostages were "alive, well and free "
Carter was on the inaugural stand,
watching his successor take the oath
of office, when the hostages were pre
paring to depart Tehran's airport,
where chants of "Down with Reagan''
and "Down with America" rang
through the evening.
Canadian reporters who watched
what Tehran television showed of the

departure said that most of the Ameri
cans looked pale and wore the empty,
resigned expressions of prisoners as
they were led one-bv-one from a bus
through a crowd of Islamic revolu
tionary guards at the airport.
"There was no joy on the faces."
one correspondent said in his dis
patch.
Laughing and crying
But in the final minutes of their cap
tivity. the Americans were laughing,
crying and hugging one another, ac
cording to Erik Lang, the Swiss am
bassador in Tehran who was in
terviewed by ABC News.
The agreement between Iran and
the United States involved a com
plicated swap of the hostages for just
under $8 billion in frozen Iranian as
sets — money originally held in Iran's
accounts with a dozen major U.S.
banks and the Federal Reserve, but
also money that, over the past 14
months, the banks had used to make
loans and other banking deals.
Thus, on its face the agreement that
was initialed in Algiers early Monday
morning amounted to a banking trans
action — intricate, and on an un
precedented scale, but nothing more
than a transfer of assets from one ac
count to another
Because of a technical dispute over
the wording of one of the documents
needed to implement the huge fund
transfer, the normally serene world of
international finance became for the
space of 48 hours a setting of high dra
ma.
The first sign of a hitch in the agree
ment came late Monday when of
ficials of the Iranian Central Bank, the
Bank Markazi. objected to the lan
guage of a technical document known
in banking circles as a payment order.
According to U.S. officials present
at the Treasury during the long Mon
day night of negotiation — the night

when the clock ticked away to the end
of Carter's presidency — the complex
11-page order was necessary for Iran,
under the agreement with the United
States, to order the U.S. banks to
transfer about $5.5 billion of frozen as
sets plus interest to a Bank of England
escrow account from the foreign
branches of the 12 American banks.
Bank's arcane world
The banks had suggested the ar
rangement that, in their arcane world,
was regarded as a routine payment or
der that would take care of this techni
cal need.
But the Bank Markazi, as its direc
tor, Ali Reza Nobari. later explained,
objected to language in the order that
in his view limited the total assets to
be transferred.
The Iranians had insisted that for
the hostage deal to go through, the to
tal amount of money to be placed in
escrow with the Bank of England had
to total at least $7,955 billion. But be
cause the payment order seemed to
the Iranians to limit the assets
transfer. Nobari refused to sign it.
Accordingly, the whole complicated
transfer mechanism shuddered to a
halt. Money that was supposed to be
flowing from the 12 banks and their
branches did not move into the Feder
al Reserve Bank of New York. The
escrow account in London sat dormant
with only about $2.4 billion, the sum
moved there earlier from the Federal
Reserve's own holdings in Iranian as
sets and gold.

cause the payment order seemed to
the Iranians to limit the assets
transfer. Nobari refused to sign it.
Accordingly, the whole complicated
transfer mechanism shuddered to a
halt. Money that was supposed to be
flowing from the 12 banks and their
branches did not move into the Feder

escrow account in London sat dormant
with only about $2.4 billion, the sum
moved there earlier from the Federal
Reserve's own holdings in Iranian as

The deadlock was broken about 2.30
a.m. EST yesterday when British law
yers for the Bank Markazi came up
with a formula to change the language
of the payment order. Nobari ac
cepted it.and soon afterward, the

ing the second successive long night of
negotiation, agreed.
Washington — Free at last, the 52
American hostages who endured so
much for so long at the hands of taunt
ing Iranian kidnappers traveled with
tears and laughter last night toward a
nation that never forgot them during
their 444 days of captivity.
The flight to freedom began 33
minutes after Ronald Reagan as
sumed the presidency from Jimmy
Carter, who had devoted his last hours
in office to turning national humil
iation into what he called "this day of
joy and thanksgiving."
First the journey was to Algeria,
the North African nation that acted as
middleman in negotiating the agree
ment exchanging frozen Iranian gold
and bank deposits for the hostages' re
lease. Then, with Thanksgiving din
ners of turkey and the trimmings en
route, it was on to a U.S. military hos
pital in Wiesbaden, West Germany,
for several days of rest before the 50
men and 2women head for home.
The first of two U.S. Air Force C-9A
transports carrying the hostages to
Germany landed at 6.44 a.m. (12:44
EST). Former Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance and Walter Stoessel Jr.,
the U.S. ambassador to West Germa
ny, greeted the hostages.
The second plane landed a few
minutes later. Former Deputy Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher, the
chief negotiator in securing their re
lease, was aboard that flight with half
of the hostages.

From the beginning of their
odvssey, Americans joined in sponta
neous celebration with silent prayers,
the pealing of church bells and a
cacophony of sirens and honking
horns.
American's first glimpse of the
freed hostages came via satellite tele
vision transmissions when they
stepped from an Algerian airliner in
Algiers eight hours after leaving
Tehran amidst shouts ofc "Down with
America"from their militant cap
tors.
There were 52 faces wreathed in
smiles, and animated talk and
laughter, as some flashed "V" for vic
tory signs. The first two off the plane
— political officer Elizabeth Anne
Swift and cultural attache Kathryn
Koob — wore in the hair the yellow rib
bons that at home had symbolized a
nation's hope for their safe return.
Christopher
Christopher repeatedly received
warm hugs as he stood on a rain-slick
airport runway. "We are very glad to
be here, believe me." said Robert
Ode. at 62 the oldest of the hostages.
Christopher, who four years ago left
his Los Angeles law practice to be
come the State Department's N0.2 of
ficial during the Carter adminis
tration, told the hostages: "You are
back home and safely in our hands.
This event answers our prayers."
Those words brought the hostages to
their feet with loud applause, and
Bruce Laingen, the ranking American
diplomat among them, said: 'Thank
you for the flight to freedom."
Carter, whose crushing loss of the
presidency stemmed in no small part
from voter frustration over his seem
ing inability to solve the hostage
crisis, was to fly to Germany early to
day to represent the nation — at Rea
gan's request — in a high-level wel
come for the freed hostages.
Standing before congressional lead
ers at an inaugural luncheon. Reagan
lifted his glass of California wine and
said: . to conclude. . with thanks
to Almighty God ... I have been given
a tagline.the get-off line that everyone
wants for the end of a toast or a speech
or anything else:
"Some 30 minutes ago. the planes
bearing our prisoners left Iranian air
space and they're now free of Iran.
"So we can all drink to this one — to
all of us together. Doing what we all
know we can do to make this country
what it should be, what it always has
been."
National elation
The applause that greeted Reagan's
remarks echoed a nation's elation, a
sense of relief and joy that swelled on
the Main Street of Plains. Ga., where
Carter returned on a rainy afternoon
as a private citizen.
There, his voice breaking with emo
tion, his face lined with fatigue.
Carter said that he had just gotten
word from Christopher that the
hostages were "alive, well and free "
Carter was on the inaugural stand,
watching his successor take the oath
of office, when the hostages were pre
paring to depart Tehran's airport,
where chants of "Down with Reagan''
and "Down with America" rang
through the evening.
Canadian reporters who watched
what Tehran television showed of the

departure said that most of the Ameri
cans looked pale and wore the empty,
resigned expressions of prisoners as
they were led one-bv-one from a bus
through a crowd of Islamic revolu
tionary guards at the airport.
"There was no joy on the faces."
one correspondent said in his dis
patch.
Laughing and crying
But in the final minutes of their cap
tivity. the Americans were laughing,
crying and hugging one another, ac
cording to Erik Lang, the Swiss am
bassador in Tehran who was in
terviewed by ABC News.
The agreement between Iran and
the United States involved a com
plicated swap of the hostages for just
under $8 billion in frozen Iranian as
sets — money originally held in Iran's
accounts with a dozen major U.S.
banks and the Federal Reserve, but
also money that, over the past 14
months, the banks had used to make
loans and other banking deals.
Thus, on its face the agreement that
was initialed in Algiers early Monday
morning amounted to a banking trans
action — intricate, and on an un
precedented scale, but nothing more
than a transfer of assets from one ac
count to another
Because of a technical dispute over
the wording of one of the documents
needed to implement the huge fund
transfer, the normally serene world of
international finance became for the
space of 48 hours a setting of high dra
ma.
The first sign of a hitch in the agree
ment came late Monday when of
ficials of the Iranian Central Bank, the
Bank Markazi. objected to the lan
guage of a technical document known
in banking circles as a payment order.
According to U.S. officials present
at the Treasury during the long Mon
day night of negotiation — the night

when the clock ticked away to the end
of Carter's presidency — the complex
11-page order was necessary for Iran,
under the agreement with the United
States, to order the U.S. banks to
transfer about $5.5 billion of frozen as
sets plus interest to a Bank of England
escrow account from the foreign
branches of the 12 American banks.
Bank's arcane world
The banks had suggested the ar
rangement that, in their arcane world,
was regarded as a routine payment or
der that would take care of this techni
cal need.
But the Bank Markazi, as its direc
tor, Ali Reza Nobari. later explained,
objected to language in the order that
in his view limited the total assets to
be transferred.
The Iranians had insisted that for
the hostage deal to go through, the to
tal amount of money to be placed in
escrow with the Bank of England had
to total at least $7,955 billion. But be
cause the payment order seemed to
the Iranians to limit the assets
transfer. Nobari refused to sign it.
Accordingly, the whole complicated
transfer mechanism shuddered to a
halt. Money that was supposed to be
flowing from the 12 banks and their
branches did not move into the Feder
al Reserve Bank of New York. The
escrow account in London sat dormant
with only about $2.4 billion, the sum
moved there earlier from the Federal
Reserve's own holdings in Iranian as
sets and gold.
The deadlock was broken about 2.30
a.m. EST yesterday when British law
yers for the Bank Markazi came up
with a formula to change the language
of the payment order. Nobari ac
cepted it.and soon afterward, the
American banks, through their repre
sentatives sitting at the Treasury dur
ing the second successive long night of
negotiation, agreed.
