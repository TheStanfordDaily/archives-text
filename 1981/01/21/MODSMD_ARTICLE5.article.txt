### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Free at last, the 52
American hostages who endured so
much for so long at the hands of taunt
ing Iranian kidnappers traveled with
tears and laughter last night toward a
nation that never forgot them during
their 444 days of captivity.
The flight to freedom began 33
minutes after Ronald Reagan as
sumed the presidency from Jimmy
Carter, who had devoted his last hours
in office to turning national humil
iation into what he called "this day of
joy and thanksgiving."
First the journey was to Algeria,
the North African nation that acted as
middleman in negotiating the agree
ment exchanging frozen Iranian gold
and bank deposits for the hostages' re
lease. Then, with Thanksgiving din
ners of turkey and the trimmings en
route, it was on to a U.S. military hos
pital in Wiesbaden, West Germany,
for several days of rest before the 50
men and 2women head for home.
The first of two U.S. Air Force C-9A
transports carrying the hostages to
Germany landed at 6.44 a.m. (12:44
EST). Former Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance and Walter Stoessel Jr.,
the U.S. ambassador to West Germa
ny, greeted the hostages.
The second plane landed a few
minutes later. Former Deputy Secre
tary of State Warren Christopher, the
chief negotiator in securing their re
lease, was aboard that flight with half
of the hostages.

From the beginning of their
odvssey, Americans joined in sponta
neous celebration with silent prayers,
the pealing of church bells and a
cacophony of sirens and honking
horns.
American's first glimpse of the
freed hostages came via satellite tele
vision transmissions when they
stepped from an Algerian airliner in
Algiers eight hours after leaving
Tehran amidst shouts ofc "Down with
America"from their militant cap
tors.
There were 52 faces wreathed in
smiles, and animated talk and
laughter, as some flashed "V" for vic
tory signs. The first two off the plane
— political officer Elizabeth Anne
Swift and cultural attache Kathryn
Koob — wore in the hair the yellow rib
bons that at home had symbolized a
nation's hope for their safe return.
Christopher
Christopher repeatedly received
warm hugs as he stood on a rain-slick
airport runway. "We are very glad to
be here, believe me." said Robert
Ode. at 62 the oldest of the hostages.
Christopher, who four years ago left
his Los Angeles law practice to be
come the State Department's N0.2 of
ficial during the Carter adminis
tration, told the hostages: "You are
back home and safely in our hands.
This event answers our prayers."
Those words brought the hostages to
their feet with loud applause, and
