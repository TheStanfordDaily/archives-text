# New hormone cure may save dwarves

University researchers are testing
a new growth hormone which Medical
Center scientists hope will revolu
tionize treatment of dwarf children —
youngsters with growth hormone defi
ciencies.
Growth hormone deficiencies affect
about 10,000 to 15,000 children in the
United States, causing them to be hy
perpituitary dwarves. The rare dis
ease strikes when the pituitary gland,
which controls growth, does not pro
duce enough of the hormone.
Prior to recent advances in growth
hormone production techniques, it
was difficult for scientists to syn
thesize the growth hormone. This was
due partially to the complex structure
of the hormone which contains 191
amino acid chains.
Another obstacle to hormone syn
thesis was the availability of the
growth hormone's source. "Originally
growth hormones were obtained from
a cadaver's pituitary gland," ex
plained Ann Bennett, a post-doctorate
fellow in pediatric endocrinology at
the Medical Center, who is re
searching the hormone.
"It takes 50 cadavers to supply one
child with the growth hormone for one
year," Bennett added.
Assistant Professor of Pediatrics,
Ron Rosenfeld, criticized the original
method as containing several prob
lems.
"Materials are very expensive and
scarce, and impurities are not totally
extracted," said Rosenfeld.
The new production process in
volves reconstructing a gene for
growth hormones and splicing it with
E. Coli, a common bacteria. The bac
teria is grown in large fermentation
vats similar to those found in
breweries. The bacteria is then killed
and the growth hormone extracted
and purified.
"In a way. we trick the bacteria into

creating the growth hormone," Ro
senfeld explained.
The new method for producing the
growth hormone is expected to greatly
increase its availability and success,
according to hormone producers.
"Before, growth hormones were
basically unavailable," said Gary
Hooper, marketing manager for Gen
entech, the firm in charge of prod
uction. "Now we will have an infinite
supply of the human growth
hormone." Hooper said.
Growth hormone research began in
1979. when Genentech, a South San
Francisco-based genetic engineering
firm, began working in conjunction
with a Swedish firm to determine the
benefits of a synthetically produced
hormone.
Rosenfeld attributed much of the
University's involvement to the Medi
cal Center's experience in the field.
"We have two dozen children in the
clinic undergoing treatment. Basical
ly our involvement is due to being in
the right place at the right time with
the right experience and close geo
graphical proximity," said Rosenfeld.
As part of Genentech's multi-in
stitutional research program, Ro
senfeld aided University researchers
in writing the proposal to be submitted
to the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA).
Research began with animal ex
periments which lasted through 1980.
Study then progressed to early clinical
trials after the P'DA approved the re
searchers' Investigative New Drug
application early this month. The ear
ly trial is now in its second of three
weeks at the Medical Center.
Twelve male volunteers from the
Genentech firm were screened and
randomly assigned to treatment
groups. Last week, six volunteers re
ceived the old growth hormone while
the remaining six received the new
synthetically produced hormone.
Neither group knew which treatment
it received Following a week's wait
the process will be reversed.
The purpose of the phase one treat
ment is to discover any side effects the
hormone may cause and monitor its
efficiency, said Hooper Phase two of
the experiment would entail testing
the growth hormone on a small group
of children afflicted with the disease.
Hooper, however, plans to skip phase
two and enter directly into phase three
— treatment — in early February
"Because of the nature of the dis
ease. because the disease is rare and
the population small, we plan to im
plement treatment as soon as the re
sults of phase one have FDA ap
proval," said Hooper
Rosenfeld said he believes the
potential for the growth hormone is
"unlimited."
"Currently it will only be used for
this cause; theoretically it could be
used when genetic malfunctions or
malnutrition affect growth," said Ro
senfeld
