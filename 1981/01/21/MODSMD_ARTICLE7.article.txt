## Toxic chemical measured in atmosphere 
### Mary Duenwald 
The industrial pollutant hex
achlorobenzene (HCB) has spread through
out the earth's atmosphere. Chemists from
Texas have measured the compound in the
air above Enewetak Atoll which is in a re
mote area of the North Pacific Ocean.
HCB is a by-product of at least 14 in
dustrial processes and a key ingredient of
fungicides. It is also known to cause cancer
in animals.
"HCB is a fairly toxic chemical," said
Dr. C.S. Giam, head of Texas A&M Univer
sity's chemistry department. "This is the
first time it has been found in such a remote
area."
Giam emphasized that the levels of HCB
in the atmosphere do not present an im
mediate health hazard.
HCB disposal at sea was banned in the

1970 s. But the carcinogen will enter the
ocean by rain anyway, because it has been
distributed throughout the marine at
mosphere by air currents.
Enewetak Atoll was the site of the first
hydrogen bomb test 28 years ago. "It's real
ly out in the middle of nowhere," said Giam.
"There are no nearby sources of HCB manu
facture.
"The HCB must have traveled through
the air far from the sources of pollution. So
the chances are. it's well distributed in the
atmosphere all over the world.
The constancy of the measurements sug
gest that HCB is very stable and could there
fore stay in the atmosphere a long time.
Giam and his associate. Dr. Elliot Atlas,
also detected other airborne chemicals, in
cluding esters used in making plastics and
insecticides t DDT. chlordane and dieldrin),

that have already been measured through
out the world.
"If you want to find the minimum
baseline of any chemical in the atmosphere
you go out to where there are no local
sources of pollution," Giam explained.
The Texas chemists are still working on
identification of other unknown compounds
in their Enewetak air samples. And they are
refining their estimates of the flow of pollut
ants in the air over the ocean
The studies at Enewetak Atoll are part of
the National Science Foundation's
SEAREX (Sea-Air Exchange) Program, a
multi-disciplinary project to evaluate the
sources and flow of substances in the
marine atmosphere.
The Enewetak measurements are re
ported in the January, 1981. issue of Science
magazine.
