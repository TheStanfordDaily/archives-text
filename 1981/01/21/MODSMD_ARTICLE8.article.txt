# China to aid U.S. quake research
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Pasadena — American and
Chinese scientists have agreed
to participate in a joint earth
quake research program — with
the United States providing the
People's Republic of China with
modern seismological instru
ments and the Chinese provid
ing both the earthquakes and the
recorded data from those in
struments.
There is, of course, no guar
antee that even one strong shock
will occur in China during the 10
years that the instruuments are
expected to operate there. But.
said Prof. Wilfred Iwan of the
California Institute of Technolo
gy. one of the American partici
pants. the Peking-Tianjing re
gion of North China selected for

the installation of the equip
ment has a long history of vigor
ous seismic activity.
The devastating Tangshan
earthquake occurred in this
400-500-mile-long stretch in
1976, killing several hundred
thousand people, and five other
strong shocks, registering be
tween 6.2 and 7.4 on the Richter
Scale, have hit different parts of
the region since 1966.
Over a roughly comparable
area of Southern California dur
ing the same time, there have
been only three magnitude-6
earthquakes or greater:
Parkfield. 1966; San Fernando.
1971; and Imperial Valley. 1979.
"We hope to obtain some ex
cellent data in less time than if

we were to install these instru
ments in California," Iwan said.
"There is a higher level of seis
micitv there < in that part of Chi
na) and there's some ability to
predict earthquakes."
The Chinese would be ex
pected to concentrate the Amer
ican instruments in an area sus
pected of imminent danger, he
said, to yield a wealth of data
about what actually happens
just before, during and after a
powerful tremor. That informa
tion then might be applied to
California earthquake faults
and help American scientists
anticipate their rupturing.
The instruments are called
"strong-ground-motion" de
vices, because thev are de

signed to measure the heavy
shaking of an earthquake. If
placed near the epicenters of
shocks — something that has
been rarely achieved in the past
— these instruments can yield a
great deal of useful information
about the ways energies are re
leased in an earthquake and how
those energies propagate
through the earth.
About 40 to 45 instruments, of
several different types, will be
purchased under a $350,000
grant from the U.S. National
Science Foundation and in
stalled, over the next two years,
in the Peking-Tianjing corridor.
The Chinese will handle the in
stallation. maintenance and
data collection, according to
Iwan.
Some of the instruments are
portable, the Caltech professor
of applied mechanics said, and
can be readily moved either in
anticipation of a large tremor or
to capture the big aftershocks of
an unexpected event.
Working with Iwan as co
equals on the American side are
David Boore of the U.S. Geologi
cal Survey and Prof. Ta-liang
Teng of the University of South
ern California. Their Chinese
counterparts are from the In
stitute of Engineering Mechan
ics in the State Seismological
Bureau.
