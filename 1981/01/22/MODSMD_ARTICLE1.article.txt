# Reagan may halt U.S. compliance of hostage pact after study finished

From the Daily wire services
Washington â€” The Reagan adminis
tration said yesterday that it needed a
few days to study the complicated deal
struck with Iran to free the U.S.
hostages before making a commit
ment to implement it further.
Spokesmen at both the White House
and the State Department, following
official guidance at high levels in the
day-old administration, said Presi
dent Ronald Reagan and his foreign
policy advisers needed "a chance to go
over the agreements and see what the
administration has to follow through
on."
A White House official noted that

Reagan had said before his inaugura
tion that "if the agreement met with
his approval, the United States would
uphold its terms."
White House spokesman James
Brady warned against jumping to the
conclusion that the Reagan adminis
tration intends to repudiate the deal
worked out in former President Jim
my Carter's last weeks in office.
"It's safe to say the country re
mains bound by international law and
customs," Brady said. He noted that,
under such laws and customs, "the
spirit of that is not to abrogate (the
agreement) based on what we know
now."

William Dyess, assistant secretary
of state for public affairs, said that the
Reagan administration "does not
want to commit itself without a
chance to go over the agreements.'
He added: "It is not my intention to
hold out a possibility of rejecting it."
Reagan administration officials
could try to renounce Carter's agree
ment for freeing the hostages in Iran
because it was negotiated under
duress, but they probably should not, a
number of international law experts
said yesterday.
Several attorneys and law pro
fessors said there are provisions of in
ternational law that could be cited to
void deals concluded under the threat,
or use of force, or made in conflict
with accepted international norms.
But they added that the desire to
strike back at Iran could do more
harm than good by compounding the
international law violations in the
crisis, dishonoring Algeria and other
countries who tried to help, and ignor
ing U.S. strategic interests in the Per
sian Gulf region.
The immediate practical effect of
stopping the deal would be to keep
about $4 billion in Iranians assets in
U.S. hands, while forfeiting a chance
at a $1 billion pool for settling claims

before an international tribunal.
Acting Attorney General Charles
Renfrew said last night that Justice
Department attorneys were filing
court papers in civil cases all over the
country defending the legitimacy of
the arrangement with Iran.
"This whole thing was blackmail.
There's no question about it,"he said.
"But we have to get over the emo
tional instinct to strike back. Iran is an
important spot and could disintegrate
very quickly. We have direct interests
in the area."
Warren Christopher, the deputy
secretary of state in the Carter admin
istration who negotiated the deal
through Algerian intermediaries, re
turned yesterday from Algiers and
briefed Secretary of State Alexander
Haig on the details of the agreement.
The agreement survived its first le
gal challenge in federal court here
yesterday.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell
turned aside a plea from a former Ira
nian national that he grant a 10-day de
lay in allowing the agreement to go
into effect.
