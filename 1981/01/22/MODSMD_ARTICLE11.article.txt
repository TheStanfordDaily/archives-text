# Med School's Farquhar suggests changing habits as cure for current cardiovascular disease epidemic
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
Bill, a salesman from Sacra
mento, was Dr. John Far
quhar s first coronary heart dis
ease patient.
When Bill died four years af
ter his first heart attack at age
38, Farquhar realized that
something was wrong in the
medical care system. Doctors
could repair people like Bill, but
no preventive medicine existed
that would stop the increasing
number of heart attacks each
year.
"Society only pays for cure."
said Farqlihar. "The insurance
company kicks in with the
$20,000 for an operation after the
heart attack, but doctors need to
reach into their patients' lives
outside the medical environ
ment to see why they enter the
emergency room in the first
place."
Farquhar. who teaches Fami
ly, Community and Preventive
Medicine at the Medical Center,
has studied this problem for
more than 20 years. After learn
ing some of the causes of
cardiovascular disease in the
late 19505, he didn't want to
"stick in the laboratory to find
more reasons for premature
deaths."
Instead, Farquhar decided to
find a way to teach the public to
change their habits and thus
stop the epidemic number of
heart attacks and strokes. To do
this, he went back to school to
study prevention and in 1971
founded the Stanford Heart Dis
ease Prevention Program. Two
years ago he published a book
entitled The American Way of

Life Need Not be Hazardous to
Your Health.
Farquhar feels that Ameri
cans are too jaded to notice the
huge number of heart disease
victims each year. To change
this he translates the statistics
of the under-65 age group into
another form of disaster:

"The mere act of 'going on a diet' implies
that one will eventually 'go off.' Applying
methods of self-directed change to weight
problems provides an effective way to
achieve permanent weight control."

"Let us say that beginning
Jan. 1, two jumbo jets crash
every day of the year, killing 501
people per day. At the end of the
year the total number of pre
mature deaths from these air
plane accidents is 183,000.
"In addition, another four
jumbo jets crash daily, ex
tensively injuring 1562 people
per crash; after six months of
extensive medical care these
(570,0001 crash victims are re
stored to only one-half of their
preaccident health and mobili
ty. The total cost in lost earn
ings and medical care is about
$40 billion."
The book presents a means
for Americans to gradually al
ter their living pattern to im-

prove their cardiovascular
health and lower heart attack
risk. It outlines a specific se
quence of changes in stress con
trol, exercise, eating, weight
control, and smoking. The book
is to show people that "they
have power over their own
lives," said Farquhar.

"Changes don't have to be
painful, a matter of suffering,
but Americans can best im
prove their health if they work
on change over time."
Dr. Nathan Maccoby, direc
tor of the communications com
ponent of the Heart Disease
Prevention Program, says,
"the book is excellent in how it
presents medical knowledge
without talking down to the
reader. It is not overly techni
cal."
The most difficult changes to
make are those involving diet,
according to Farquhar. He
stresses that although eating
habits are learned and can be
changed, "It is hard to convince
Americans that what their
mother did might have been
wrong."

Most Americans are raised
believing that meat, for exam
ple, is a necessary part of every
meal and telling them that it is
unhealthy is "violating the cul
tural integrity of their upbring
ing."
Farquhar, 53, gradually al
tered his own eating habits to re
duce his intake of sugar, salt,
saturated fat, and cholesterol,
all of which have been liked to
heart disease.
Born in Canada to parents of
Scottish origin, such habits as
salted porridge had to be
stopped. His own family is
evolving towards a more vege
tarian diet. Three or four of
their evening meals per week
are meat-free and they eat no
meat with breakfast or lunch.
This is about one-quarter the na
tional average.
Farquhar also follows the oth
er health habits of his book. He
learned to control stress, keeps
his 6-foot-3-inch frame at 178
pounds, and has quit smoking.
In terms of exercise he swims or
rides a stationary bicycle four
times a week, rides his bike the
two miles to work every morn
ing, and runs once a week.
Habits like this are what the
interdisciplinary Stanford
Heart Disease Prevention Pro
gram (SHDPP) is trying to in
troduce in several California
communities. Using behavioral
science and mass communica
tion methods, Farquhar created
the program to develop and test
public health education techni
ques that will reduce heart dis
ease.
According to Dr. Stephen
Fortmann, director of the cur
rent SHDPP study in five com

munities around Salinas and
Monterey, "Dr. Farquhar's
best idea was not to work
through the health care system
because physicians generally
don't think in preventive
terms."
As a scientist, Farquhar was
not sure how to go directly to the
public so he brought the In
stitute for Communications Re
search into the project when
Maccoby, its director, ex
plained to him that "changing
attitudes is not as simple as giv
ing a talk to the PTA."
Through television shows and
newspaper articles which ask
residents to score their own risk
and health habits, Farquhar
hopes to start changing people's
attitude towards their future.
"I want to get through to the
numbed TV watcher and couple
his fear of the risk of heart dis
ease with the means to solve it."
In the future, Farquhar hopes
that we will "be able to change
the social forces that promote
and maintain ill health in the
prevailing popular culture."

$20,000 for an operation after the
heart attack, but doctors need to
reach into their patients' lives
outside the medical environ
ment to see why they enter the
emergency room in the first
place."
Farquhar. who teaches Fami
ly, Community and Preventive
Medicine at the Medical Center,
has studied this problem for
more than 20 years. After learn
ing some of the causes of
cardiovascular disease in the
late 19505, he didn't want to
"stick in the laboratory to find
more reasons for premature
deaths."
Instead, Farquhar decided to
find a way to teach the public to
change their habits and thus
stop the epidemic number of
heart attacks and strokes. To do
this, he went back to school to
study prevention and in 1971
founded the Stanford Heart Dis
ease Prevention Program. Two
years ago he published a book
entitled The American Way of

Life Need Not be Hazardous to
Your Health.
Farquhar feels that Ameri
cans are too jaded to notice the
huge number of heart disease
victims each year. To change
this he translates the statistics
of the under-65 age group into
another form of disaster:

"The mere act of 'going on a diet' implies
that one will eventually 'go off.' Applying
methods of self-directed change to weight
problems provides an effective way to
achieve permanent weight control."

"Let us say that beginning
Jan. 1, two jumbo jets crash
every day of the year, killing 501
people per day. At the end of the
year the total number of pre
mature deaths from these air
plane accidents is 183,000.
"In addition, another four
jumbo jets crash daily, ex
tensively injuring 1562 people
per crash; after six months of
extensive medical care these
(570,0001 crash victims are re
stored to only one-half of their
preaccident health and mobili
ty. The total cost in lost earn
ings and medical care is about
$40 billion."
The book presents a means
for Americans to gradually al
ter their living pattern to im-

prove their cardiovascular
health and lower heart attack
risk. It outlines a specific se
quence of changes in stress con
trol, exercise, eating, weight
control, and smoking. The book
is to show people that "they
have power over their own
lives," said Farquhar.

"Changes don't have to be
painful, a matter of suffering,
but Americans can best im
prove their health if they work
on change over time."
Dr. Nathan Maccoby, direc
tor of the communications com
ponent of the Heart Disease
Prevention Program, says,
"the book is excellent in how it
presents medical knowledge
without talking down to the
reader. It is not overly techni
cal."
The most difficult changes to
make are those involving diet,
according to Farquhar. He
stresses that although eating
habits are learned and can be
changed, "It is hard to convince
Americans that what their
mother did might have been
wrong."

Most Americans are raised
believing that meat, for exam
ple, is a necessary part of every
meal and telling them that it is
unhealthy is "violating the cul
tural integrity of their upbring
ing."
Farquhar, 53, gradually al
tered his own eating habits to re
duce his intake of sugar, salt,
saturated fat, and cholesterol,
all of which have been liked to
heart disease.
Born in Canada to parents of
Scottish origin, such habits as
salted porridge had to be
stopped. His own family is
evolving towards a more vege
tarian diet. Three or four of
their evening meals per week
are meat-free and they eat no
meat with breakfast or lunch.
This is about one-quarter the na
tional average.
Farquhar also follows the oth
er health habits of his book. He
learned to control stress, keeps
his 6-foot-3-inch frame at 178
pounds, and has quit smoking.
In terms of exercise he swims or
rides a stationary bicycle four
times a week, rides his bike the
two miles to work every morn
ing, and runs once a week.
Habits like this are what the
interdisciplinary Stanford
Heart Disease Prevention Pro
gram (SHDPP) is trying to in
troduce in several California
communities. Using behavioral
science and mass communica
tion methods, Farquhar created
the program to develop and test
public health education techni
ques that will reduce heart dis
ease.
According to Dr. Stephen
Fortmann, director of the cur
rent SHDPP study in five com

munities around Salinas and
Monterey, "Dr. Farquhar's
best idea was not to work
through the health care system
because physicians generally
don't think in preventive
terms."
As a scientist, Farquhar was
not sure how to go directly to the
public so he brought the In
stitute for Communications Re
search into the project when
Maccoby, its director, ex
plained to him that "changing
attitudes is not as simple as giv
ing a talk to the PTA."
Through television shows and
newspaper articles which ask
residents to score their own risk
and health habits, Farquhar
hopes to start changing people's
attitude towards their future.
"I want to get through to the
numbed TV watcher and couple
his fear of the risk of heart dis
ease with the means to solve it."
In the future, Farquhar hopes
that we will "be able to change
the social forces that promote
and maintain ill health in the
prevailing popular culture."
