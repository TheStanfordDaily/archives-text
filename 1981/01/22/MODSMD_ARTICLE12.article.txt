# Reagan warns of an 'economic affliction'
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — An "economic affliction of
great proportions'' confronts the United
States, President Reagan declared in his in
augural address. He said this affliction en
compasses sustained high inflation that
"threatens to shatter the lives of millions of
our people. . unemployment that causes
"human misery and personal indignity"
and a crushing burden of government taxa
tion and intervention in Americans' lives.
It is now up to Reagan to find the correct
policies, the policies that eluded the Carter
administration, to relieve this affliction.
The relief will take some time, even on the
president's timetable.
"The economic ills we suffer have come
upon us over several decades," he asserted
Tuesday. "They will not go away in days,
weeks, or months, but they will go away.
They will go away because we as Americans
have the capacity now, as we have had in the
past, to do whatever needs to be done to pre
serve this last and greatest bastion of free
dom."
What is it that needs to be done? Reduce
taxes and the burden of government. "In
this present crisis, government is not the
solution to our problem ; government is the
problem," Reagan said.
Sooner or later, however, Reagan and his
new team of economic advisers are more
realistically going to have to discuss, pub
licly and in detail, just how they plan to get
from a world of 7.4 percent unemployment
and double-digit inflation rates to, in the
president's words, "a healthy, vigorous,
growing economy."
None of the Reagan appointees has volun
teered to describe, even in general terms,
exactly what is supposed to happen quarter
by quarter once the large personal and busi

nesss tax cuts and government spending
cuts planned are put in place, perhaps the
former well before the latter. The key ques
tion is why, if a 7.5 percent or 8 percent un
employment rate has done so little to slow
inflation, would faster economic growth do
it?
Faster growth would reduce workers' ap
prehensions about layoffs and their em
ployers' anxieties about their ability to pay
higher wages in a depressed economy. Un
less the rate of wage increase, which is now
fully consonant with a double-digit inflation
rate, comes down, inflation will not come
down. And why should anyone settle for less
when trying to keep up with such an infla
tion and when expecting job prospects to get
better?
This is the real-world prospect confront
ing Reagan. Of course, a large rise in prod
uctivity — which has the effect of reducing
labor costs to an employer — could do the
trick. But where is that to come from in 1981
or 1982? A higher rate of business invest
ment in more modern plants and machines
eventually should raise productivity, but
only by a small amount over an extended pe
riod of years.
Meanwhile, the Reagan advisers have
been urging the Federal Reserve to keep a
tight rein on growth of the money supply.
That is more or less the same thing as
saying the economy should not grow rapid
ly-
This inherent conflict between the Rea
gan plans for stimulating the economy with
tax cuts and the insistence that the nation's
central bank keep the lid on growth can be
resolved only if there is some sort of sponta
neous drop in inflation this year or in 1982. If
such a drop occurred, then the amount of
money and credit available would be suffi

cient to finance both real economic ex
pansion as well as the remaining rate of in
flation.
There was no hint in Reagan's inaugural
speech that the Fed's monetary discipline
might bring down inflation but only at the
cost of still more unemployment. The presi
dent made it all sound easy: tax cuts, faster
growth, less government and "equitable"
solutions "with no one group singled out to
pay a higher price."
Throughout Reagan's campaign, with its
emphasis on "supply-side" economics,
there was the suggestion that fundamental
economic relationships had changed, that
the nation had returned to those pregnant
days of the early 1960s when a tax cut indeed
could lead directly to a prosperous, non
inflationary growth. But even in those hal
cyon days, faster growth and lower un
employment did not produce lower infla
tion.
Now, however, that is the name of the
game, how to lower inflation. Today's reali
ty is a world of multiyear labor contracts,
indexed government transfer programs,
rapidly increasing food and energy prices
and a pervasive expectation that it all will
continue.
So far there is no credible explanation of
just how the new administration will deal
with these and other problems while simul
taneously reducing inflation and unemploy
ment. We still don't know how they plan to
get from here to there.
Reagan's first step was to declare a
freeze on hiring of civilian employees by all
federal executive agencies. But so did Pres
ident Carter and his predecessors. In fact,
federal employment dropped 45,000 during
Carter's term. It did not make much dif
ference in the inflation rate.
