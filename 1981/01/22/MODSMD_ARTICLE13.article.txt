# Ca. is no 'cancer patient haven'
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Laetrile became legal in California on Jan.
1, but there are no signs that the state will be
come a haven for cancer patients who put their
faith in the controversial cancer drug.
■ The new legislation, which appeared to
make it possible for enterprising doctors to es
tablish Laetrile clinics within the state's
borders like those in Tijuana, was considered a
triumph by advocates of the unconventional
treatment.
California became the 23rd state to legalize
Laetrile. And it may be the only state where
the drug can be manufactured without vio
lating the federal ban on the production and
distribution of the substance in interstate com
merce.
Serious flaws
But a few serious flaws have emerged in the
present law.
For example, the law permits Laetrile to be
prescribed for terminal cancer patients by
cancer specialists certified by the American
Board of Medical Oncology.
But there is no American Board of Medical
Oncology.
Cancer specialists are certified by the
American Board of Internal Medicine, which
has a medical oncology (cancer treatment)
subspecialty board.
The mistake in properly identifying the
group that supervises the training of cancer
specialists slipped into the bill during tough,
last-minute negotiations that eventually led to
the bill's passage last fall.
As a result, the only doctors in the state who
can legally prescribe Laetrile are physicians
with patients in the principal teaching hospi
tals of the state's nine medical schools. They
were specified in the law.
Officials from several of the medical
schools indicated after the bill's passage last
fall that if Laetrile were offered at all, it would
be administered as part of a carefully con
trolled experiment to test its effectiveness.
Such a test, on a limited number of patients, is
already under way at UCLA one of four institu
tions in the country participating in a Laetrile
study sponsored by the National Cancer In
stitute.
The law clearly makes it legal to manufac
ture the substance in California. A manufac
turer must show that the drug produced is safe
but need not show that it is effective in treating
cancer.
The market for Laetrile is potentially lucra
tive. Cancer patients now pay as much as
$1,000 for a six-month supply of the material.

And the chemical is relatively simple to pro
duce. Manufacturers use solvents like water or
ethanol to remove Laetrile from a variety of
natural sources, including apricot pits and bit
ter almonds, to obtain a white, purified
crystal.
The drug is taken either orally, in pill form,
or dissolved in water and injected. Proponents
claim it can both relieve pain and shrink
tumors.
But thus far only three potential manufac
turers have contacted the food and drug sec
tion of the state Department of Health Ser
vices. the agency that would have to approve a
new drug application before production could
begin. None of those inquiring has yet begun
the application process.
Restrictions
The reluctance to jump into the Laetrile
business is easily explained: The present law
contains so many restrictions that the legal
market for the drug in the state is likely to be
small.
Advocates of Laetrile, which many cancer
specialists dismiss as medically worthless, ac
knowledge the problems in the bill. But they
contend that the new law is a triumph for non
conventional treatment of cancer.
"The only thing we secured is a great psy
chological victory over the great California
Medical Association," said Mike Culbert, vice
president of American Biologies, which has
been legally importing Laetrile into the coun
try under a federal court order that permits
the drug to be brought in by terminal cancer
patients.
American Biologies has no plans to manu
facture Laetrile in California at this point, ac
cording to Culbert, who points out that the
FDA could crack down on Laetrile production
in California if any element used in its manu
facture came from out of state.
The FDA has taken a wait-and-see attitude
toward California's new law, according to an
FDA spokesman, who said it would be specula
tion to conclude that the agency would shut
down a manufacturer on the basis of a techni
cality.
But uncertainty over the FDA position has
caused at least one potential manufacturer to
hesitate.
"There's likely to be a hassle like no one has
ever been hassled — by both the state and fed
eral food and drug administrations," said an
employee of a Southern California vitamin
company, which would have considered pro
ducing Laetrile if it had been treated like a vi
tamin.
