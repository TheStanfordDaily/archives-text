# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Douglas Ackerman Semester system offers distinct advantages 
### 
"This is faaaaaantastic," I
said to Jeff, a fellow incoming
Stanford freshman as we
basked in the late September
sun on Malibu beach, "School
doesn't start until October Ist. I
pity those Ivy Leaguers who
started school three weeks ago
on the first of this month. What
a bummer."
At one time the three-quarter
school year (fall, winter and
spring) did seem more desirable
than the two-semester system
(fall and winter-spring). How
ever, after analyzing the rela
tive merits of each, I have con
cluded that the semester is su
perior. I propose that classes at
Stanford begin the first week of
September, recess for a one
month winter break after finals
from mid-December to late-
January, and then resume until
the end of May, allowing for a
two-week spring break in March
or April, depending on the par
ticular date of Easter.
Since there would be two long
er semesters instead of three
shorter quarters, students could
study each course in more
depth. For example, my gener
al psychology professor has
abridged the semester course
he normally teaches at the Uni
versity of Houston to "fit" the
10-week quarter here at Stan
ford.
There are hundreds of pages
of fundamental psychology
reading and many important
lectures that the class will miss.
Although many people take such
introductory courses to just
"taste" the subjects, they
should be given a full taste so
they can accurately evaluate
their interest in the subject.
Only after fully learning basic
psychology can one decide to
take a more specific course in
the department. Perhaps one of
the topics "deleted" from our
course would prompt me to en
roll in a higher level psychology
class.
On the other hand, the quarter
system allows students to take
more courses than does the
semester system. Stanford stu
dents can fill a year's schedule
with a greater variety of sub
jects than students who attend a
college that is on the semester
system. In addition, Stanford
students who are not satisfied
with a course need only to "stick
it out" for 10 weeks rather than
15 (courses may be dropped
in both systems, although drop
ping a one-quarter course is less
catastrophic than quitting a
semester-long class).
Another popular gripe college
students have about the
semester system is that pro
fessors tend to be disorganized,
believing there is ample time to
cover most material. According
to friends at Ivy League
schools, professors are easily
distracted by provocative ques
tions and interesting anecdotes,
and feel that they have enough
time to digress from the topics
being discussed
At Stanford, professors are
often painstakingly organized;
since there is little time for ad
ditional detail, the professors
seem to leave out humanizing
touches and deliver "dry" lec
tures. Perhaps both systems of
fer from poor course organiza
tion.
If Stanford adopted the
semester system the students'
schedule would coincide with
those of friends at other col
leges My friends at Eastern
colleges, for example, left for

school almost a month before
classes at Stanford began. Eve
ry other school where my
friends are studying has a win
ter break that is at least two
weeks longer than our vacation.
And all of these colleges (except
UC-Berkeley) finish the
academic year by the end of
May.
Although our unique schedule
seems to encourage Stanford
students to associate with other
Stanford people during school
recesses (since our other
friends are in school when we
are not, and vice-versa) it is
nevertheless healthy to social
ize with groups of different col
lege students. A change to the
semester system would remedy
this problem.
Students who are finished
with school in May snap up most
of the desirable summer jobs
before students on the quarter
system are out of school. Al
though Stanford students may
have difficulty searching for
good summer jobs, it is true that
under the quarter system Stan
fordians have the full month of
September free, whereas
semester-system students are
already in school.
Admittedly, this month could
be valuable free time; time to
travel to places that are
crowded in July and August,
make some extra money or just

relax at home. The majority of
the 20 students' polled,
however, expressed a desire to
start school earlier and get out
earlier. Most of these students
felt that they would have more
time to spend with friends from
home and could land a summer
job more easily if, as a switch to
the semester system would fa
cilitate, school ended in late
May and began in early Septem
ber.
There is an economic per
spective to the question. If
school were in session in Sep
tember, instead of two weeks in
January and two weeks in June,
Stanford would not have to heat
the dormitories, libraries and
classrooms for two extra winter
weeks, thereby saving money on
fuel costs. Furthermore, fruit
and vegetables are fresher and
cheaper at the end of summer
than in the heart of winter —
food would be less expensive,
and better, in September than in
January.
Perhaps the foremost prob
lem with the present system is
that the students are constantly
in the middle of examinations,
both mid-term and final. For ex
ample, my first "mid-term"
was two weeks into the first
quarter. For the remainder of
fall quarter (except dead week)
I've had at least one exam and
one paper to write each week.

Exams each semester would
cover more material but there
would be more time to prepare
for every test. Students who pre
fer to have many mid-term ex
ams plus a final account for
their grade may rest assured
that there will be as many test
per course but more time in be
tween exams under the
semester system.
The two-semester system
seems to be more desirable than

the three-quarter system on
most counts. It is true that Stan
ford students would lack their
trademark September tans, but
this appears to be one of the
most severe side-effects the
suggested schedule change
would produce. For the sake of
the students, let us implement
the semester system here at
Stanford.

sun on Malibu beach, "School
doesn't start until October Ist. I
pity those Ivy Leaguers who
started school three weeks ago
on the first of this month. What
a bummer."
At one time the three-quarter
school year (fall, winter and
spring) did seem more desirable
than the two-semester system
(fall and winter-spring). How
ever, after analyzing the rela
tive merits of each, I have con
cluded that the semester is su
perior. I propose that classes at
Stanford begin the first week of
September, recess for a one
month winter break after finals
from mid-December to late-
January, and then resume until
the end of May, allowing for a
two-week spring break in March
or April, depending on the par
ticular date of Easter.
Since there would be two long
er semesters instead of three
shorter quarters, students could
study each course in more
depth. For example, my gener
al psychology professor has
abridged the semester course
he normally teaches at the Uni
versity of Houston to "fit" the
10-week quarter here at Stan
ford.
There are hundreds of pages
of fundamental psychology
reading and many important
lectures that the class will miss.
Although many people take such
introductory courses to just
"taste" the subjects, they
should be given a full taste so
they can accurately evaluate
their interest in the subject.
Only after fully learning basic
psychology can one decide to
take a more specific course in
the department. Perhaps one of
the topics "deleted" from our
course would prompt me to en
roll in a higher level psychology
class.
On the other hand, the quarter
system allows students to take
more courses than does the
semester system. Stanford stu
dents can fill a year's schedule
with a greater variety of sub
jects than students who attend a
college that is on the semester
system. In addition, Stanford
students who are not satisfied
with a course need only to "stick
it out" for 10 weeks rather than
15 (courses may be dropped
in both systems, although drop
ping a one-quarter course is less
catastrophic than quitting a
semester-long class).
Another popular gripe college
students have about the
semester system is that pro
fessors tend to be disorganized,
believing there is ample time to
cover most material. According
to friends at Ivy League
schools, professors are easily
distracted by provocative ques
tions and interesting anecdotes,
and feel that they have enough
time to digress from the topics
being discussed
At Stanford, professors are
often painstakingly organized;
since there is little time for ad
ditional detail, the professors
seem to leave out humanizing
touches and deliver "dry" lec
tures. Perhaps both systems of
fer from poor course organiza
tion.
If Stanford adopted the
semester system the students'
schedule would coincide with
those of friends at other col
leges My friends at Eastern
colleges, for example, left for

school almost a month before
classes at Stanford began. Eve
ry other school where my
friends are studying has a win
ter break that is at least two
weeks longer than our vacation.
And all of these colleges (except
UC-Berkeley) finish the
academic year by the end of
May.
Although our unique schedule
seems to encourage Stanford
students to associate with other
Stanford people during school
recesses (since our other
friends are in school when we
are not, and vice-versa) it is
nevertheless healthy to social
ize with groups of different col
lege students. A change to the
semester system would remedy
this problem.
Students who are finished
with school in May snap up most
of the desirable summer jobs
before students on the quarter
system are out of school. Al
though Stanford students may
have difficulty searching for
good summer jobs, it is true that
under the quarter system Stan
fordians have the full month of
September free, whereas
semester-system students are
already in school.
Admittedly, this month could
be valuable free time; time to
travel to places that are
crowded in July and August,
make some extra money or just

relax at home. The majority of
the 20 students' polled,
however, expressed a desire to
start school earlier and get out
earlier. Most of these students
felt that they would have more
time to spend with friends from
home and could land a summer
job more easily if, as a switch to
the semester system would fa
cilitate, school ended in late
May and began in early Septem
ber.
There is an economic per
spective to the question. If
school were in session in Sep
tember, instead of two weeks in
January and two weeks in June,
Stanford would not have to heat
the dormitories, libraries and
classrooms for two extra winter
weeks, thereby saving money on
fuel costs. Furthermore, fruit
and vegetables are fresher and
cheaper at the end of summer
than in the heart of winter —
food would be less expensive,
and better, in September than in
January.
Perhaps the foremost prob
lem with the present system is
that the students are constantly
in the middle of examinations,
both mid-term and final. For ex
ample, my first "mid-term"
was two weeks into the first
quarter. For the remainder of
fall quarter (except dead week)
I've had at least one exam and
one paper to write each week.

Exams each semester would
cover more material but there
would be more time to prepare
for every test. Students who pre
fer to have many mid-term ex
ams plus a final account for
their grade may rest assured
that there will be as many test
per course but more time in be
tween exams under the
semester system.
The two-semester system
seems to be more desirable than

the three-quarter system on
most counts. It is true that Stan
ford students would lack their
trademark September tans, but
this appears to be one of the
most severe side-effects the
suggested schedule change
would produce. For the sake of
the students, let us implement
the semester system here at
Stanford.
