## 'Healthy' narcissists just rude 
### 
It's 6:30 a.m. in Manhattan
Beach. In the midst of the gas
crunch, bleary-eyed customers
begin to line up at the nearby
service station. At precisely
7:00 a.m. the owner is ready for
business, but the line doesn't
move. Why? Because the owner
of the first vehicle in line parked
her car the night before, locked
it, and left.
In Atlanta, an angry female
shopper hurls a pair of spiked
heeled shoes at a clerk and
stalks sullenly away.
In Los Angeles, a man waits
in line at the Department of Mo
tor Vehicles for an hour and 45
minutes only to have the clerk
slam the window in his face.
What do these people have in
common? They have all had the
misfortune of coming into con
tact with the "healthy"
narcissist, one who continually
puts his own needs and desires
in front of those of others. In oth
er words, someone who just
doesn't give a damn about any
one but himself.
Social critic Tom Wolfe chris
tened the 1970 s as the "me dec
ade," describing the young
adults of the time as the "me
generation." Along this
narcissistic quest for conscious
ness-expansion and self-aware
ness, a serious social problem
has arisen: the emergency and
acceptance of rudeness as the
behavioral norm.
After Time magazine's ad

monitions in last year's
"Epitaph for a Decade," one
would have thought that there
would be at least some slight
change in social attitudes. This,
however, is not the case. Now,
in the thick of a new decade, it is
our task as the accused "me
generation" to start anew and
strive to overcome this trend of
self-centeredness and the prob
lems that accompany it.
Of the many problems result
ing from this narcissism the
most serious is probably the ef
fect it has had on social courtes
ty. Twenty years ago, prior to
the "me, me, me" syndrome,
would a Virginia state trooper's
hand have been bitten by a cab
bie when the officer wrote him a
ticket? Would toll booth atten
da nts on Maryland's
Chesapeake Bay Bridge have
had to be wary of drivers that
spit on change or try to shoot
them with squirt guns filled
with ink or ammonia? Would a
female patron of the Wisconsin
male strip-tease joint, The Sug
ar Shack, have dropped a red
hot Susan B. Anthony dollar
down a performer's g-string for
something other than "kicks"?
Would Stanford students, for
that matter, have had to con
tend with inordinately ag
gressive cyclists or pushy stand
ees in registration lines?
Of course, discourtesy is not
limited to flagrant acts of
gaucherie. It can be manifested
in any of our daily acts as well:
ignoring someone we know as
we pass them by, failing to re
spond to a simple " hello," or
cutting someone off on the road
or phone. Lately, this mode of
behavior has become the rule
rather than the exception. But
why?
According to Time, civility
was dealt a crippling blow by
the "me generation." Many so
ciologists concur. William Hunt
of Loyola University maintains
that "people today are more
blunt, more forceful, more self
centered. Rather than ask
What can I give?' they're ask
ing instead 'What can I get?' "
The social crusades of the 60 s
— the antiwar campaign, the
counterculture, and the civil

rights movement — broke up a
lot of institutional furniture, but
left little to replace it with ex
cept the intensive, aggressive
self-regard of the late 1970 sand
early 1980 s.
People go to classes to learn
what Newsweek magazine calls
frequently turned out to be "bad
manners." Manners are not the
message of Robert Ringer's
bestseller Looking Out For
Number 1, or evident in such so
cial axioms as "honesty is the
best policy — but there are other
policies," or "don't get mad —
get even."
It is sure to be argued that the
cult of "1" has done some indi
viduals a world of good. But at
whose expense? What about us,
the people to whom these
"healthy egotists" are rude or
even abusive? What about the
people they manipulate and ex
ploit? People like the Virginia
state trooper and Maryland toll
booth attendants?
What will happen if some
thing is not done to ameliorate
theme-first situation? A very
good and very tragic example is
the 1979 Who concert in Cincin
nati where 11 people were
senselessly trampled to death
because no one gave a damn
about anyone else. The fabric of
society begins disintegrating in
minor, almost trivial ways, like
violating crowd regulations or
littering laws or double-park
ing. It then disintegrates in
more major ways.
Unfortunately there is no pat
solution for the problem. One
cannot simply wish it away or
ignore its existence. The time
has come for us to shake off the
malingering lethargy of the 70s
and ask ourselves what sort of
society we will be left with if we
continue in this fashion. The
time has come for us to stop
always putting our needs ahead
of those of others. Ask "What
can I give? How can I help?"
The decade of the 80s, while no
longer new, it is still young
enough for us to start again. The
time has come for us to give a
damn.

According to Time, civility
was dealt a crippling blow by

The social crusades of the 60 s
— the antiwar campaign, the

self-regard of the late 1970 sand
early 1980 s.
People go to classes to learn
what Newsweek magazine calls
frequently turned out to be "bad
manners." Manners are not the
message of Robert Ringer's
bestseller Looking Out For
Number 1, or evident in such so

best policy — but there are other
policies," or "don't get mad —

It is sure to be argued that the
cult of "1" has done some indi
viduals a world of good. But at
whose expense? What about us,
the people to whom these
"healthy egotists" are rude or
even abusive? What about the
people they manipulate and ex

state trooper and Maryland toll
booth attendants?
What will happen if some
thing is not done to ameliorate
theme-first situation? A very
good and very tragic example is
the 1979 Who concert in Cincin

senselessly trampled to death
because no one gave a damn
about anyone else. The fabric of
society begins disintegrating in
minor, almost trivial ways, like
violating crowd regulations or
littering laws or double-park
ing. It then disintegrates in
more major ways.
Unfortunately there is no pat
solution for the problem. One
cannot simply wish it away or
ignore its existence. The time
has come for us to shake off the
malingering lethargy of the 70s
and ask ourselves what sort of
society we will be left with if we
continue in this fashion. The
time has come for us to stop
always putting our needs ahead
of those of others. Ask "What
can I give? How can I help?"
The decade of the 80s, while no

time has come for us to give a
damn.

It's 6:30 a.m. in Manhattan
Beach. In the midst of the gas
crunch, bleary-eyed customers
begin to line up at the nearby
service station. At precisely
7:00 a.m. the owner is ready for
business, but the line doesn't
move. Why? Because the owner
of the first vehicle in line parked
her car the night before, locked
it, and left.
In Atlanta, an angry female
shopper hurls a pair of spiked
heeled shoes at a clerk and
stalks sullenly away.
In Los Angeles, a man waits
in line at the Department of Mo
tor Vehicles for an hour and 45
minutes only to have the clerk
slam the window in his face.
What do these people have in
common? They have all had the
misfortune of coming into con
tact with the "healthy"
narcissist, one who continually
puts his own needs and desires
in front of those of others. In oth
er words, someone who just
doesn't give a damn about any
one but himself.
Social critic Tom Wolfe chris
tened the 1970 s as the "me dec
ade," describing the young
adults of the time as the "me
generation." Along this
narcissistic quest for conscious
ness-expansion and self-aware
ness, a serious social problem
has arisen: the emergency and
acceptance of rudeness as the
behavioral norm.
After Time magazine's ad

monitions in last year's
"Epitaph for a Decade," one
would have thought that there
would be at least some slight
change in social attitudes. This,
however, is not the case. Now,
in the thick of a new decade, it is
our task as the accused "me
generation" to start anew and
strive to overcome this trend of
self-centeredness and the prob
lems that accompany it.
Of the many problems result
ing from this narcissism the
most serious is probably the ef
fect it has had on social courtes
ty. Twenty years ago, prior to
the "me, me, me" syndrome,
would a Virginia state trooper's
hand have been bitten by a cab
bie when the officer wrote him a
ticket? Would toll booth atten
da nts on Maryland's
Chesapeake Bay Bridge have
had to be wary of drivers that
spit on change or try to shoot
them with squirt guns filled
with ink or ammonia? Would a
female patron of the Wisconsin
male strip-tease joint, The Sug
ar Shack, have dropped a red
hot Susan B. Anthony dollar
down a performer's g-string for
something other than "kicks"?
Would Stanford students, for
that matter, have had to con
tend with inordinately ag
gressive cyclists or pushy stand
ees in registration lines?
Of course, discourtesy is not
limited to flagrant acts of
gaucherie. It can be manifested
in any of our daily acts as well:
ignoring someone we know as
we pass them by, failing to re
spond to a simple " hello," or
cutting someone off on the road
or phone. Lately, this mode of
behavior has become the rule
rather than the exception. But
why?
