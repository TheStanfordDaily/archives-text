Faculty retirement
Your paper reported on a re
cent meeting of the Stanford
Faculty Senate. (Daily, Jan.9),
during which President Donald
Kennedy announced that Stan
ford would consider the selec
tion of alternatives to TIAA and
CREF as additions to the facul
ty-staff retirement program.
The University Committee on
Faculty-Staff Benefits and the
Task Force on Retirement had
recommended that such alter
natives be considered as an ad
dition to the current choices of
TIAA and CREF. I know of no
opposition to this concept of
broader choice in the Stanford
retirement program.
Unfortunately, the published
report of the Senate Meeting
may have led to misunderstand
ing on at least two points. First,
no one intended personal or pro
fessional criticism of the
Trustees of TIAA or CREF. I
know five of the CREF trustees,
including my colleague Pro
fessor' William Sharpe of
Stanford, and I wish to stress
that the trustees whom I know
are all outstanding individuals
who give selflessly of their time
in service to TIAA and CREF.
The trustees have worked long
and hard to improve TIAA and
CREF, and their efforts merit
public recognition.
Secondly, some statistics on
investment performance over
the past decade (1970-79) were
reported which indicated a sub
stantial overall performance
difference between CREF and
part of the Stanford endowment
(Merged Pool A). It must be

emphasized that these figures
represented approximate past
returns and that future returns
on these two funds may vary sig
nificantly from past results.
As a member of the Commit
tee on Faculty-Staff Benefits, I
am personally concerned that
the trustees of TIAA and CREF
recognize that we hold them in
high esteem and that the
readers of this paper under
stand that future expectations
of investment performance
ought not to be based on simple
extrapolations of past invest
ment returns. I fully support the
statement of President Ken
nedy on consideration of addi
tional retirement plan alter
natives to TIAA and CREF,
such as those available to the
faculties of the Universities of
Chicago and Rochester.

Restrict pedestrians
I think I have what may be the
solution to the seemingly in
soluble problem of bicycles and
mopeds vs. pedestrians.
The only solution would seem
to be to restrict pedestrians to
the dirt and gravel paths and all
the two-wheeled vehicles to the
walkways. This would surely
protect the life and limbs of the
innocent and provide an un
restricted raceway for the
cyclists.

"Thank you" to the Stanford
Fire Department for its rapid

response to the fire last month
in Crothers Memorial Hall. We
wish to apologize for the stu
dents who set fire to their desks
in order to keep warm. Cowell
Student Health Center is nearby
to treat Cro-Mem's ever-grow
ing number of frostbite cases so
resorting to such extreme
measures was shamefully un
called for. While not condoning
our dorm mates' actions, we do
request: "Let's conserve health
as well as energy."

When I was young, TV and sci
ence fiction had me believing
that computers would take over
the world. Here in Silicon Gulch
we are constant witness to the
many marvels of the electronic
age, but few really believe the
notion that microprocessors
will soon be really in charge of
things (though some of the new
computers, perhaps, could out
perform that old-time model in
the White House).
It is my solemn duty to warn
of a more subtle danger: a radi
cal subversive plot on the part of
those amazing digital watches

(excuuuuse me, chronographs)
to enslave the human race. First
they were few and relatively si
lent. The noisier watches, in the
beginning, banded to the engi
neers. Hark! and behold, they
quickly divided and multiplied
and now anyone with any mod
ernity at all wears a digital elec
tronic watch. These devices aim
to conquer the earth and subdue
it.
Already the shouts of their or
ganizing can be heard in every
Stanford classroom as they
"beep-beep" in near-unison
every hour on the hour. A few
miserably embarassed should
may be .037 seconds off (God
forbid!) but they always beep
just as loudly. Sporadic "beep
beep-beeps" send the (n)ever
punctual, frantic watch owners
scurrying in all directions at
any hour of day or night.
Prohibit these rallies! Silence
your hourly "chimes!" Save
your souls! The alternative is
enslavement. Can you not see
all Stanford, arms raised to that
great Light-Emitting Diode in
the sky (LCD if you prefer), eve
ry wrist uttering its reverent
"beep-beep" every hour in ear
splitting but blissfully accurate
cacophony?

and hard to improve TIAA and
CREF, and their efforts merit
public recognition.
Secondly, some statistics on
investment performance over
the past decade (1970-79) were
reported which indicated a sub
stantial overall performance
difference between CREF and
part of the Stanford endowment
(Merged Pool A). It must be

emphasized that these figures
represented approximate past
returns and that future returns
on these two funds may vary sig
nificantly from past results.
As a member of the Commit
tee on Faculty-Staff Benefits, I
am personally concerned that
the trustees of TIAA and CREF
recognize that we hold them in
high esteem and that the
readers of this paper under
stand that future expectations
of investment performance
ought not to be based on simple
extrapolations of past invest
ment returns. I fully support the
statement of President Ken
nedy on consideration of addi
tional retirement plan alter
natives to TIAA and CREF,
such as those available to the
faculties of the Universities of
Chicago and Rochester.

Restrict pedestrians
I think I have what may be the
solution to the seemingly in
soluble problem of bicycles and
mopeds vs. pedestrians.
The only solution would seem
to be to restrict pedestrians to
the dirt and gravel paths and all
the two-wheeled vehicles to the
walkways. This would surely
protect the life and limbs of the
innocent and provide an un
restricted raceway for the
cyclists.

Fire and frost
"Thank you" to the Stanford
Fire Department for its rapid

response to the fire last month
in Crothers Memorial Hall. We
wish to apologize for the stu
dents who set fire to their desks
in order to keep warm. Cowell
Student Health Center is nearby
to treat Cro-Mem's ever-grow
ing number of frostbite cases so
resorting to such extreme
measures was shamefully un
called for. While not condoning
our dorm mates' actions, we do
request: "Let's conserve health
as well as energy."

Beep beep?
When I was young, TV and sci
ence fiction had me believing
that computers would take over
the world. Here in Silicon Gulch
we are constant witness to the
many marvels of the electronic
age, but few really believe the
notion that microprocessors
will soon be really in charge of
things (though some of the new
computers, perhaps, could out
perform that old-time model in
the White House).
It is my solemn duty to warn
of a more subtle danger: a radi
cal subversive plot on the part of
those amazing digital watches

(excuuuuse me, chronographs)
to enslave the human race. First
they were few and relatively si
lent. The noisier watches, in the
beginning, banded to the engi
neers. Hark! and behold, they
quickly divided and multiplied
and now anyone with any mod
ernity at all wears a digital elec
tronic watch. These devices aim
to conquer the earth and subdue
it.
Already the shouts of their or
ganizing can be heard in every
Stanford classroom as they
"beep-beep" in near-unison
every hour on the hour. A few
miserably embarassed should
may be .037 seconds off (God
forbid!) but they always beep
just as loudly. Sporadic "beep
beep-beeps" send the (n)ever
punctual, frantic watch owners
scurrying in all directions at
any hour of day or night.
Prohibit these rallies! Silence
your hourly "chimes!" Save
your souls! The alternative is
enslavement. Can you not see
all Stanford, arms raised to that
great Light-Emitting Diode in
the sky (LCD if you prefer), eve
ry wrist uttering its reverent
"beep-beep" every hour in ear
splitting but blissfully accurate
cacophony?

Faculty retirement
Your paper reported on a re
cent meeting of the Stanford
Faculty Senate. (Daily, Jan.9),
during which President Donald
Kennedy announced that Stan
ford would consider the selec
tion of alternatives to TIAA and
CREF as additions to the facul
ty-staff retirement program.
The University Committee on
Faculty-Staff Benefits and the
Task Force on Retirement had
recommended that such alter
natives be considered as an ad
dition to the current choices of
TIAA and CREF. I know of no
opposition to this concept of
broader choice in the Stanford
retirement program.
Unfortunately, the published
report of the Senate Meeting
may have led to misunderstand
ing on at least two points. First,
no one intended personal or pro
fessional criticism of the
Trustees of TIAA or CREF. I
know five of the CREF trustees,
including my colleague Pro
fessor' William Sharpe of
Stanford, and I wish to stress
that the trustees whom I know
are all outstanding individuals
who give selflessly of their time
in service to TIAA and CREF.
The trustees have worked long
and hard to improve TIAA and
CREF, and their efforts merit
