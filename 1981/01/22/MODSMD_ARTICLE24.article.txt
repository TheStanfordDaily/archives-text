# Law student wins $5000 for disarmament essay
## 
### Karen Springen 
Law student Michael
Schuman has just received a
$5000 prize for his plan calling
for world disarmament.
The Bulletin of Atomic Scien
tists named the second-year law
student winner of the 1980
Rabinowitch Essay Contest for
his 4000-word composition,
"The Mouse That Roared."
More than 800 entries addressed
the problem of how to eliminate
the threat of nuclear war.
This month's issue of the Bul
letin , which contains
Schuman's essay, also symbol
ically moves the hands of its
"atomic clock" forward three
minutes. The clock now reads
four minutes to midnight.
It registered two minutes to
midnight in 1953 after the
hydrogen bomb was developed
and three minutes to midnight
in 1949 after the Soviet Union ex
ploded its first atomic bomb.
"We've had so many close
calls now that the next one (nu
clear accident) could be tomor
row," said Schuman. "People
are realizing loads of simple
ways to build bombs that they
never thought of before."
He added, "nuclear power is
incompatible with disarma
ment."
Schuman, who received a
B.A. in international relations
from Stanford in 1979, said peo
ple tend to feel false security.
"They think 'we've made it this
far, no doubt we'll continue to
make it,' " he said.
But the clock indicates the ur
gency of acting now to stop the
arms race. "Both the U.S. and
Soviets have behaved atrocious

ly in world affairs," he said.
Schuman cited the increasing
number of weapons which in
creases the possibility of one
being fired accidently as his big
gest concern.
His essay advocates that the
140 non-nuclear nations band to
gether and threaten to go nucle
ar "I've sort of given up on the
U.S. and Soviets disarming on
their own," he said.
"My real hope is that they
(the Third World nations) sim
ply come together and discuss
disarmament," he said. "That's
whv I wrote this article."
Schuman said that one or two
countries joining efforts could
be the beginning of a snow
balling effect, "They've learned
there's great power in their
numbers. We no longer live in a
two-country world."
And although he points to an
ideal long-term goal of no nucle
ar weapons or power plants, he
hesitates to advocate the shut
down of all nuclear power
plants. "The most effective
argument is not to build more,"
he said.
Schuman also expressed
pessimism about the immediate
future of a SALT 111 agreement.
"SALT II took seven years;
there's no reason to think SALT
111 will be any faster," he said.
He particularly criticized the
recent U.S. announcement of a
"counterforce" doctrine. Re
aiming missiles at silos reflects
a false belief that nuclear wars
are winnable, he said.
"Things are pretty damn
close to exploding right now."
He said that four times in the
last 18 months U.S. nuclear

forces went on alert over false
alarms of Soviet threat.
He praised SALT I for giving
the U.S. and Soviets "no advan
tage to building more weapons
than they already had."
In regard to the "No Nukes"
movement, Schuman differs
with its priorities since it has
not concentrated on disarma
ment. He cited, however, their
mutual concern with safety. But
he said that compared to a nu
clear holocaust, "the worst that
could happen in those (power
plant) accidents is relatively
minor."
Schuman teaches a freshman
seminar, "Soft Energy Paths
and Non-Nuclear Futures." He
calls solar energy the "best and
easiest" alternative.
His interest in nuclear pro
liferation began after taking
Arms Control (Poli Sci 138 A) as
a freshman seven years ago. He
then worked with Wolfgang
Panofsky. director of SLAC, on
peaceful nuclear explosion tech
nology. "This spawned my be
lief that all peaceful nuclear ac
tivities have inherent military
potential," he said.
He said his cynicism about
peaceful uses is based, for ex
ample. on unsuccessful Soviet
attempts to build canals with
nuclear power.
Future plans for "building a
disarmed world order" include
"fleshing out" his paper pro
posal. sending copies to each
non-nuclear nation, giving
speeches and writing articles.
He would also like to en
courage the Board of Trustees
to "send a message to those in
power."
