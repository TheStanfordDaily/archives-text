# Ordinary folk steal $15 billion as employees
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — The bartender
who "forgets" to ring up every sixth
drink, the clerk who wraps four dresses
and charges a friend for one, the waiter
who neglects to list items on a diner's
check — besides being crooks, these peo
ple have something else in common.
They're mostly ordinary Americans,
plain-folks who have families and homes,
who watch television and go to work —
where they steal an estimated $15 billion
a year from their employers.
A man dedicated to reversing the sting
of these thieves is Steve Long, president
of Triad Consultants Ltd.
"I'll bet you that any 10 people you see
on the street — nine of them stole some

thing once," says the salty, Bronx-born
private eye.
Long calls himself a "crook-catcher"
and reckons he and his 21 operatives,
aided by lie-detectors, recovered nearly
$500,000 of $3 million in employee thefts
they investigated last year.
"I'm convinced that people never
steal out of necessity," he said. "I never
met a man who stole a loaf of bread be
cause he was hungry. A lot of theft is
spontaneous. People steal because it's
there."
Long estimates "80 percent of all
shrinkage in retail businesses is at
tributable to internal factors — not shop
lifters."

Movie theaters are regular targets of
employee theft, Long said, explaining
that the ticket-seller often works with
the ticket-taker, who hands you old
stubs, palms your tickets and delivers
them to the ticket booth for resale.
"We've found people in chains all over
the country making $900, $1000 a night
selling tickets over and over," Long said.
Jim Hill, security manager at Macy's
on Union Square, estimated that 40
percent of theft from the store last year
could be blamed on employees.
Long, president of the California
Academy of Polygraph Sciences, said
the lie detector is the heart of his opera
tion. Often the device is so intimidating

that the thief confesses before the test
can be given.
"I tell people taking tests. If you don't
want to tell me the truth, leave the room.
If you want to tell me the truth and
straighten this out, fine.' "
He advises employers "not to be
afraid of employees. If they start making
noises about constitutional rights, you
have to remember that as an employer
you have constitutional rights, too. No
employer has to give up money because
an employee wants to steal it."
Long says that firms which deal with
theft problems by routinely firing most
of the staff wind up replacing "the old
thief with a new one."
