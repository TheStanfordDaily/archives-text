# Peninsula Children's Center offers....
## Another perspective on learning 
### Todd Pickett 
The playground of the Pe
ninsula Children's Center in
Palo Alto is another kind of
classroom for some Stanford
students; they are receiving
an education not found in
textbooks or lectures.
Through a two-quarter
SWOPSI course, students are
gaining insights into the
world of emotionally dis
turbed children — a per
spective many of the stu
dents value more than the
program's four units.
Twice a week student vol
unteers spend three hours
with a small group of chil
dren whose behavioral prob
lems — antism, mental re
tardation, learning dis
abilities and emotional prob
lems — have made them un
fit even for many programs
designed for the handi
capped.

The 41 students who attend
the day school need individ
ual attention in their de
velopment. Because of the
Peninsula Children's Cen
ter's small staff, supported
by both public and private
funds, the amount of individ
ual attention depends largely
on additional help from stu
dent volunteers.
"The more people we have
working with the kids, the
more therapy can be done,"
said volunteer director
Marilyn Walker.
Under the supervision of a
child therapist and a special
education teacher, volun
teers act as an extended arm
of the staff and work with
groups of five to six children
who function at similar so
cial levels.
Therapy for the children,
who range from ages three to
18, may take place in the

classroom, the art room, or
the playground. For the non
verbal, lower functioning
group, therapy may merely
involve recognizing another
person or object, throwing a
ball, or any activity which
encourages normal social be
havior.
"We try to give the kids as
much experience as pos
sible," said child therapist
John Parker-Campbell.
"For instance, we let a
number of kids play quarter
back in a football game just
to get them to count 'one,
two, three, hike.' "
One child, Campbell
added, couldn't run 10 feet
before she would trip and
fall. After weeks of individ
ual attention from a student
volunteer, the child was run
ning laps around the play
ground.
One musically inclined

volunteer used to play her
guitar for the group, even
tually inspiring one child to
begin piano lessons.
Of the Stanford volunteers
who have finished the now
decade-old SWOPSI pro
gram, many return to PCC in
their spare time to continue
the relationships which
began in their first two quar
ters of work.
"I really enjoy the kids,"
said junior Catherine
Kelsey, a former SWOPSI
student. "They're people
with their own unique char
acteristics and traits."
For senior Beverly Hilton,
the desire to relate to these
children has prompted her to
return to PCC as a post-
SWOPSI volunteer. "People
need to be aware of im
perfection in life and learn
how to cope with children
like these," said Hilton.
"This should not be some
thing that frightens us and
makes us feel uncom
fortable."
Because of the potential of
the children to learn to solve
their own problems senior
Ken Obeso, now in his sixth
quarter at PCC, hopes some
day to begin his own school
for the emotionally handi
capped.
"People don't realize that
these kids have a future,"
said Obeso. "You've got to
look for that light in them."
For some children, a
workshop is conducted to
prepare them for jobs in
sheltered employment situ
ations. Activities such as en
velope stuffing and assembl
ing mechanical parts have
enabled a few PCC students
to find work in nearby re
habilitation centers. Addi
tional skills such as what to
do on lunch breaks, how to
ask for help, and how to meet
people aid the children in fit
ting into the working en
vironment.
"Some of the higher func
tioning PCC students will
eventually make the transi

tion into the public school
system," Walker said.
Many of the other students
continue in daily therapy
with volunteers and staff
who concentrate on teaching
basic skills in communica
tion, social behavior, and day
to day living. For many of the
children, the inability to
communicate to another per
son can be a major source of
frustration and aggression.
Volunteers and staff spend
hours working individually
with the children hoping to
improve their ability to in
teract socially with those
around them. One child en
tered PCC with severe ag
gressive tendencies, striking
other children up to 80 times
a day. Through staff mem
bers teaching the child how
to control his emotions, the
youngster has reduced his
hitting to two instances a
day. Volunteers interacting
with children through
games, books, music, and
just by talking has helped
pull some away from ag
gressive and anti-social be
havior.
Field trips to the roller
rink, movie theaters, and
sports events expose chil
dren to the world outside
PCC — excursions which
usually require the aid of vol
unteers.
For the staff, student vol
unteers have relieved some
of the pressure which can
come from having to meet
the individual needs of as
many as 10 children.
Volunteers agree that ex
posure to and working with
handicapped children is a
good experience. Susan
Moreno, a full-time aid at
PCC said "It's good to get ex
posure to these children;
there is always the chance
that you will have a handi
capped kid."
Some students, though,
also suggested that not eve
ryone may be suited to this
type of volunteer service.
"You must be able to meet
the children at where they
are at and be prepared for
anything," said Obeso. "In
addition you must have pa
tience or the potential for
it."
