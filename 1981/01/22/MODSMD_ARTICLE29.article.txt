Because of its central location in Southeast
Asia, Thailand has always been an area where
various influences from neighboring lands have
met. They have been adapted to meet Thai needs
and have resulted in the creation of artifacts with
a distinctively Thai character. Interest in Thai
ceramics has grown in recent years with the dis
covery of many examples from ancient gravesites
in the Philippines and Indonesia. A collection of
Thai ceramics is currently on display (through
Feb. 1) in the Miedel Room of the University
Museum of Art.
The earliest ceramics found in Thailand have
been discovered at a site known as the Spirit Cave,
where fragments of a corded pottery have been
dated to just before 6000 B.C. Pre-historic
earthenwares from Ban Chiang in northeast Thai
land were unknown except to local villagers until
1966. The cord-marked and incised pottery from
this site has been tentatively dated from 3600 to
2900 8.C., but the spectacular red-painted Ban
Chiang wares have indicated dates from 1000 B.C.
to 500 B.C. or later.
During the second half of the 13th century Thai
peoples migrating south from present-day China
formed small principalities in the valleys of
northern Thailand. The first of these was
Sukothai, founded around 1250 A.D. It flourished
during the last quarter of the 13th century and into
the 14th when it was peacefully absorbed into the
kingdom of Ayutthaya to the south. Sukothai's pol
icy of free trade was the basis for a large export
trade in ceramics which was continued by Ayut
thaya into the 15th and 16th centuries.
The history of Thai ceramics begins with a leg

end about the king of Sukothai bringing 500 potters
from China at the end of the 13th century. Al
though the truth of the legend is doubtful, the simi
larity between Sukothai wares with their painted
decorations, Cizhou (Tz'u-chou) stonewares from
China, and 14th-century Vietnamese (Annamese)
wares is striking.
Sukothai ceramics are technically less sophisti
cated than the better known Sawankhalok.
Archaeological investigation of the cargoes of
ship-wrecked junks in the Gulf of Siam indicates
that they were contemporaneous at least for a
short period of time. Most Sukothai wares are
bowls and dishes made from coarse and grainy
clay and decorated under the glaze with painted
fish, sunbursts and floral sprays in black or dark
brown over a whitish slip. Sawankhalok wares are
more varied in form, decoration and glazes.
Sawankhalok potters painted decorations in black
under the glaze, similar to the Sukothai, but they
also incised designs under a thick green or
celadon glaze, used monochrome brown or white
glazes, and combined the brown and white.
Sawankhalok wares were especially popular with
the 15th- and 16th-century masters of the
Japanese tea ceremony.
Since 1933, other ancient kiln sites have been
discovered in northern Thailand which produced
such wares as Kalong, Sankampaeng, Phayao,
Phan, Wang Nua, and Lampang.
The exhibition will include figures and
architectural ornaments in addition to vessels and
utilitarian pieces such as pottery rollers carved
with geometric patterns which are believed to
have been used to print textiles in ancient times.
