### Kimberly Brown 
The Bluegrass Festival, ASSU con
cert production in general, and the
future of the Academic Organizations
Board (AOB) were some of the key is
sues debated by the ASSU Senate Fi
nance Committee last night.
The committee will recommend to
the senate that a Bluegrass Festival
be put on this spring. However, they
outlined explicit guidelines for the
production and concluded "The festi
val is in no way meant to be indicative
of approval for student concert prod
uction."
Gary Reiff, chairman of the Fi
nance Committee, said the festival
will be proposed "with two, and only
two purposes — to keep the Bluegrass
at Stanford, and as an investment op
portunity."
He said the prime production re
sponsibility will be by outside pro
moters and financers. "Student in
volvement will be minimal and lim
ited to observation," Reiff said.
As far as ASSU's invplvement
stands, the committee decided the
project will be "coordinated — but not
run by ASSU.'' Members of the council
of presidents and the ASSU student fi
nancial manager will serve as the pri
mary link between the University and
the outside backers.
Concerning ASSU and the future of
contemporary entertainment in gen

eral, the project feasibility study ap
proved by the senate last week will
continue as planned. Reiff maintained
that "the ASSU isn't running concerts,
and the possibility of our ever running
them depends on the display of student
interest and involvement" over the
next few weeks.
The Finance Committee also re
viewed a report on the AOB and voted
unanimously to transfer the responsi
bility for funding of member groups
from the AOB itself to the Finance
Committee.
The AOB was formed in 1977 to coor
dinate and represent all the campus
academic and pre-professional or
ganizations. In addition, the board has
had to allocate funds and create new
groups where student interest exists.
Finance Committee member David
Phelps investigated the current state
of the board, concluding in his report
that the AOB, as is, "serves the
purpose of funding, but does not ac
complish its other functions."
The report states that there is little
continuity within the different as
sociations, thus the AOB is limited in
its ability to enhance the academic ex
periences of students.
Besides removing the AOB's fund
ing tasks, the committee agreed that
members of the AOB will meet with
the financial branch of ASSU this
spring to present group budgets for the
upcoming year.
