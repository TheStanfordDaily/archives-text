# Senate votes to confirm Haig, three other Cabinet members

### Washington Post 
Washington — The Senate voted 93
to 6 yesterday to confirm President
Ronald Reagan's nomination of Alex
ander Haig as secretary of state,
brushing aside a complaint from Mi
nority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.)
that Haig had left "unanswered ques
tions . . . regarding the abuse of
power."
Haig, chief aide to President Rich
ard Nixon in the aftermath of Water
gate and former commander of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
was the second Reagan Cabinet de
signee to win Senate confirmation.
Caspar Weinberger was confirmed as
secretary of defense within hours af
ter Reagan's inauguration on Tues
day.
The Republican-controlled Senate,
seeking to give Reagan as much of his
Cabinet as possible this week, yester
day also unanimously approved
Donald Regan as Treasury secretary,
Bill Brock as trade representative and
Richard Schweiker as secretary of
health and human services.

Despite five days of grueling hear
ings and a battle over subpoenas, Haig
won confirmation with relative ease,
drawing praise from many Democrats
as well as Republicans for his hard
line foreign policy views and mixed re
views for his role in the Nixon White
House.
The negative votes came from five
Democrats and one Republican:
Byrd; Carl Levin (D-Mich.); Donald
Riegle (D-Mich.); Paul Sarbanes (D-
Md ); Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.); and
Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.).
Even some of these praised Haig's
intelligence and skills, with Tsongas
calling him an "extraordinary
man . . . intelligent, tough,
pragmatic." Their criticisms cen
tered on what Sarbanes, a member of
the House Judiciary Committee when
it voted to impeach Nixon, called "the
use of power in our constitutional sys
tem and the judgment General Haig
will make in this regard."
Bryd tempered his criticism, noting
that some of the "unanswered ques
tions" were never asked but saying

that Haig's record on uses and abuses
of the power amounted to a "clouded"
case for confirmation. "While I be
lieve General Haig has respect for the
Constitution of the United States, I am
afraid that he lacks a fundamental un
derstanding of, and sensitivity to, the
designated and distinct roles and re
sponsibilties of the executive and leg
islative branches of our government,"
said Bryd.
Praise applauded
Haig's strongest defense on the Wa
tergate issue came from Sen. Barry
Gold water (R-Ariz.), whose praise of
Haig and affirmation of confidence in
Reagan administration foreign policy
prospects brought an outburst of ap
plause from the gallery.
Goldwater claimed that Haig was
principally responsible for keeping
Nixon from fighting impeachment to
the end. adding that those who try to
link Haig with Watergate-related
abuses are "talking through a rather
empty hat."
The bitterest criticism of Haig
came from Weicker, who accused him
of having "consistently chosen the
lower road" and showing a "monu
mental contempt for both Congress
and the individual rights and liberties
of all Americans as enunciated in the
Constitution of the United States."
Future trouble
But Haig also appeared to have
some possible trouble for the future —
from Republican conservatives.
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and 16
other conservative GOP senators
have complained to Haig about some
of his rumored choices for subsidiary
positions in the State Department, in
cluding Democrats and Republican
moderates who served under Presi
dent Gerald Ford and former Secre
tary of State Henry Kissinger.
"We're sending a message and it's
being heard." said Helms, who op
posed confirmation of Weinberger on
Tuesday and is trying to hold up con
firmation of Frank Carlucci as his
deputy in order to assure choice of
what Helms calls "knowledgeable de
fense experts" in other major Pen
tagon posts.
