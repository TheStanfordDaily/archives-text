Reagan, Cabinet discuss economy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan spent his first
full day in the Oval Office yesterday, held a Cabinet meet
ing devoted to the economy and took part in another swear
ing-in ceremony, this one for his senior White House aides.
David Stockman, Reagan's choice to head the Office of
Management and Budget, said that oil and gasoline prices
will be decontrolled soon, a move that could lead to an in
crease of 12 cents a gallon at the gas pump if all the in
crease is passed through.
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said the FBI has been unable
to substantiate allegations against Reagan's choice to
head the Labor Department, Raymond Donovan.
Reagan aides said he will not be able to abolish the infla
tion-monitoring Council on Wage and Price Stability in his
first few days in office, as he had planned and promised.
"We've got to get control of the budget ... It is out of
control," Reagan said as he began the meeting.
Reagan, appearing fresh and enthusiastic after his long
night of inaugural celebrations, began his first full day as
president with another ceremony.
He and Vice President George Bush attended the East
Room swearing-in of the senior White House staff mem
bers.
Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger adminis
tered the oath to the 38 staff members who included Baker
and Edwin Meese 111, the counselor to the president who is
the only staff member who also is a member of the Cabi
net.
Reagan plans to decontrol oil
Washington — The Reagan administration will soon re
move price controls on gasoline and crude oil, and will im
pose a broad freeze on new federal regulations wherever it
can. President Ronald Reagan's budget chief David Stock
man predicted yesterday.
"We're going to freeze everything we legally and techni
cally can," said Stockman, speaking of the new adminis
tration's campaign against federal regulation of the econ
omy.
Stockman, awaiting Senate confirmation as director of
the Office of Management and Budget, said no decision has
been made yet on decontrol of oil and gasoline, but he
noted that President Reagan and top members of the new
administration made clear commitments to decontrol
during the campaign. He told an audience at the National
Press Club that they should "assume those commitments
will be implemented shortly."
Immediate decontrol could add 12 cents a gallon to
gasoline pump prices, raising overall consumer prices by
about half a percentage point this year, according to some
estimates, but Reagan and his advisers believe the federal
energy controls have discouraged exploration and dis
rupted the distribution of gasoline during shortages and
are determined to do away with them as soon as possible.
At several points in his speech, Stockman sought to de
fend the Reagan administration's intention to ask for a
large, multiyear cut in personal and corporate taxes — a
move that threatens to worsen the federal budget deficit
and thus add to inflationary pressures.
The Reagan administration's goal will be to reduce total
federal spending over the next five years, Stockman said.
"There will be no increase even for the inflation that oc
curs each year . . ." he said.
Stockman didn't disclose the magnitude of the tax and
spending policies Reagan will propose, but he said the
package will be designed to "shock and shift the economy
on a different path."
The sharp cuts in federal spending that the Reagan ad
ministration wants, would, if approved by Congress, make
it easier for the Federal Reserve Board to control the

growth of the money supply more closely and, in Stock
man's view, that is the key to reducing inflation signifi
cantly over the next two or three years.
Price controls on U.S.-produced crude oil and gasoline
are due to expire Sept. 30 and a Reagan administration de
cision to decontrol in February would permit an increase
in gasoline pump prices of 10-12 cents a gallon if com
petitive conditions permit service stations operators to
pass along the full amount. Early action by Reagan would
roughly double the price impact of decontrol. If gasoline
and domestic oil aren't decontrolled until Sept. 30, the
price increase would be about 6 cents a gallon, assuming
no increase in world oil prices by then.
Kennedys announce divorce plans
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and his
wife Joan, side-by-side campaigners as he sought the
Democratic presidential nomination last year, announced
yesterday they plan to divorce after 22 years of marriage.
They had been living apart — he in suburban Washing
ton, she in Boston — although Mrs. Kennedy appeared fre
quently with her husband during his failed effort to wrest
his party's nomination from Jimmy Carter.
In a statement issued by Kennedy's Senate office in both
their names, the couple said "appropriate legal proceed
ings will be commenced in due course."
They have three children.
A spokesman for Kennedy declined comment on where
the divorce proceedings would be initiated.
Energy Dept. calls for UC lab review
Berkeley — The U.S. Department of Energy has called
for an urgent review of a University of California plan re
quiring greater public scrutiny of nuclear weapons labora
tories at Livermore and Los Alamos, N.M.
Duane Sewell, an assistant secretary of energy, has
asked DOE officials to call a meeting with the university
to "define appropriate and acceptable oversight mecha
nisms," according to Joe LaGrone, of the department's
San Francisco office.
The two labs develop all the nuclear weapons in the
United States.
LaGrone said DOE officials want to make sure the su
pervision will not have "an adverse impact" on work at
the labs.
The Energy Department is deciding whether to renew
the university's contract to operate the labs.
Both Sewell and the University of California Board of
Regents have expressed a desire to renew the contract,
which expires in September, 1982.
The new oversight plan calls for two new committees to
monitor scientific work and environmental health ajid
safety at the labs. The regents approved the plan in No
vember after the university was pressured to sever its as
sociation with the labs.
Grand jury indicts Synanon members
Sacramento — Eighteen present and former Synanon
members have been indicted by the Marin County Grand
Jury on charges stemming from the alleged kidnaping and
beating in 1978 of a former member, Attorney General
George Deukmejian said yesterday.
One of those listed in the indictment, Howard Garfield
of San Francisco, surrendered on yesterday. Garfield,
once head of Synanon s law offices, was released on his
own recognizance and his attorney said he was near an
agreement that would eliminate Garfield from the indict
ment.
The victim was identified as Kim Myers. Deukmejian
said he could give no details of the evidence because the

grand jury transcript has been sealed by the court.
Articles last week in the San Francisco Chronicle and
the Independent Journal in San Rafael said Synanon
members believed Myers was an employee of Time maga
zine, which Synanon had sued for libel. The libel case later
was dropped by Synanon.
Several telephone calls were made to Synanon head
quarters for comment, but the calls were not returned.
Deukmejian said the defendants would be surrendering
for arraignment in Marin County yesterday and today. Ar
raignment was scheduled for 9 a.m. today before Superior
Court Judge Joseph Wilson.
Deukmejian said the charges were the first filed as the
result of his office's continuing investigation of "various
allegations against Synanon members."
Those charged with kidnaping were identified as Leon
Levy, Arnett Jamison, Jon Kaufman, William Lundberg,
Doug Muhly, Bruce Levine, Doug Robson, Philip
Bourdette, David Benjamin and Andy Cretella.
Deukmejian said false imprisonment charges were
made against Levy, Robson, Lundberg, Kaufman, Levine,
Jamison, Sid Frank. Rodney Mullen and Theodore Drib
ble.
Levy, Robson, Kaufman and Frank were charged with
assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily in
jury, Deukmejian said.
He said Bourdette, Benjamin, David Gomez, Liz Mis
sakian. Chris Haberman, Ronald Cook and Garfield were
charged with being an accessory to a felony.
The court set initial bail of $10,000 for those charged
with kidnaping and $5000 for the others, Deukmejian said.
Reapportionment causes conflicts
Sacramento — The new Democratic leaders of the state
Senate and Assembly appeared headed yesterday for a
clash over reapportionment of California's congressional
districts.
Saying "the Senate is alive and well," Senate President
Pro Tem David Roberti announced that he would not allow
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and his congressional al
lies to dictate new districts.
"Reapportionment will not be accomplished in the first
person singular by any legislator," an obviously angry
Roberti said at a Capitol news conference.
The Los Angeles Democrat was responding to recent
Brown statements, including a comment that Rep. Phil
Burton, a close Brown ally, would draw new congressional
districts.
Brown, like Burton a San Francisco Democrat, was also
quoted Tuesday as saying:
—He wants to create a second "safe" Hispanic con
gressional seat in Los Angeles County. There is currently
one Mexican-American in the state's 43-member House
delegation.
—Two black congressmen, Reps. Augustus Hawkins CD-
Los Angeles) and Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) who sup
ported Brown's election as speaker, would have veto
power over the location of their districts, but two other
black lawmakers, Reps. Mervyn Dymally and Julian Dix
on. both Los Angeles Democrats, would not.
Roberti said the Assembly and Senate should each "take
the lead" in redrawing their respective districts, but
should share responsibility for congressional seats, sched
uled to increase from 43 to 45 or 46.
He said the chairmen of the Legislature's reapportion
ment committees, Sen. Dan Boatwright (D-Concord) and
Assemblyman Richard Alatorre (D-Los Angeles) had
agreed to those points.
Roberti said he didn't oppose the idea of another Mexi
can-American district, but objected to Brown's vow to
give some congressmen vetos.

Group forms to oppose benefit cuts
Washington — A massive coalition of more than 100 na
tional organizations is getting ready to battle President
Ronald Reagan if he proposes major Social Security cuts.
The group, representing millions of aged, retired and
disabled persons, is headed by Wilbur Cohen, former sec
retary of Health, Education and Welfare under President
Lyndon Johnson and one of the fathers of the Social Secur
ity program.
Called SOS for "Save Our Security," the group was
formed two years ago to fight the Carter administration
when it proposed a series of Social Security cutbacks. With
Cohen and others tramping the halls of Congress, it helped
stave off all the Carter proposals except reduction of dis
ability insurance benefits.
"We will reactivate the organization if they propose
cuts," said Cohen in a telephone interview from the Lyn
don Johnson School at the University of Texas, where he is
now a professor.
The giant Social Security system will pay more than
$159 billion in fiscal 1982 to nearly 40 million retired and
disabled persons and their dependents, plus $57 billion for
medicare. But the system is running into short-term fi
nancing problems for the next few years because the cost
of living and the rate of unemployment are rising faster
than expected in 1977, when new taxes were voted to put
the system on a sound basis.
Reagan pledges fail to boost stocks
New York — Stock prices drifted lower yesterday in the
third straight day of losses, despite a government report of
strong economic activity in the final three months of 1980
and a Reagan administration pledge to "jolt" the economy
to recovery.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped
4.43 points to 946.25 after giving up 20.31 points on Tuesday
following Reagan's inauguration and dipping 2.30 points
Monday.
Big Board volume reached 39.19 million shares, down
from 41.75 million on Tuesday.
Today's weather
Rain likely today. Decreasing chance of showers to
night. Partly cloudy tomorrow after a chance of morning
showers. Lows in the upper 40s and 50s. Highs in the mid
50s to mid 60s today and 50s tomorrow. Southerly winds 15
to 25 mph this morning. Chance of measureable rain 60
percent today and 30 percent tonight night.

Reapportionment causes conflicts
Sacramento — The new Democratic leaders of the state
Senate and Assembly appeared headed yesterday for a
clash over reapportionment of California's congressional
districts.
Saying "the Senate is alive and well," Senate President
Pro Tem David Roberti announced that he would not allow
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and his congressional al
lies to dictate new districts.
"Reapportionment will not be accomplished in the first
person singular by any legislator," an obviously angry
Roberti said at a Capitol news conference.
The Los Angeles Democrat was responding to recent
Brown statements, including a comment that Rep. Phil
Burton, a close Brown ally, would draw new congressional
districts.
Brown, like Burton a San Francisco Democrat, was also
quoted Tuesday as saying:
—He wants to create a second "safe" Hispanic con
gressional seat in Los Angeles County. There is currently
one Mexican-American in the state's 43-member House
delegation.
—Two black congressmen, Reps. Augustus Hawkins CD-
Los Angeles) and Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) who sup
ported Brown's election as speaker, would have veto
power over the location of their districts, but two other
black lawmakers, Reps. Mervyn Dymally and Julian Dix
on. both Los Angeles Democrats, would not.
Roberti said the Assembly and Senate should each "take
the lead" in redrawing their respective districts, but
should share responsibility for congressional seats, sched
uled to increase from 43 to 45 or 46.
He said the chairmen of the Legislature's reapportion
ment committees, Sen. Dan Boatwright (D-Concord) and
Assemblyman Richard Alatorre (D-Los Angeles) had
agreed to those points.
Roberti said he didn't oppose the idea of another Mexi
can-American district, but objected to Brown's vow to
give some congressmen vetos.

Group forms to oppose benefit cuts
Washington — A massive coalition of more than 100 na
tional organizations is getting ready to battle President
Ronald Reagan if he proposes major Social Security cuts.
The group, representing millions of aged, retired and
disabled persons, is headed by Wilbur Cohen, former sec
retary of Health, Education and Welfare under President
Lyndon Johnson and one of the fathers of the Social Secur
ity program.
Called SOS for "Save Our Security," the group was
formed two years ago to fight the Carter administration
when it proposed a series of Social Security cutbacks. With
Cohen and others tramping the halls of Congress, it helped
stave off all the Carter proposals except reduction of dis
ability insurance benefits.
"We will reactivate the organization if they propose
cuts," said Cohen in a telephone interview from the Lyn
don Johnson School at the University of Texas, where he is
now a professor.
The giant Social Security system will pay more than
$159 billion in fiscal 1982 to nearly 40 million retired and
disabled persons and their dependents, plus $57 billion for
medicare. But the system is running into short-term fi
nancing problems for the next few years because the cost
of living and the rate of unemployment are rising faster
than expected in 1977, when new taxes were voted to put
the system on a sound basis.
Reagan pledges fail to boost stocks
New York — Stock prices drifted lower yesterday in the
third straight day of losses, despite a government report of
strong economic activity in the final three months of 1980
and a Reagan administration pledge to "jolt" the economy

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped
4.43 points to 946.25 after giving up 20.31 points on Tuesday
following Reagan's inauguration and dipping 2.30 points
Monday.
Big Board volume reached 39.19 million shares, down
from 41.75 million on Tuesday.

Reagan, Cabinet discuss economy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan spent his first
full day in the Oval Office yesterday, held a Cabinet meet
ing devoted to the economy and took part in another swear
ing-in ceremony, this one for his senior White House aides.
David Stockman, Reagan's choice to head the Office of
Management and Budget, said that oil and gasoline prices
will be decontrolled soon, a move that could lead to an in
crease of 12 cents a gallon at the gas pump if all the in
crease is passed through.
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said the FBI has been unable
to substantiate allegations against Reagan's choice to
head the Labor Department, Raymond Donovan.
Reagan aides said he will not be able to abolish the infla
tion-monitoring Council on Wage and Price Stability in his
first few days in office, as he had planned and promised.
"We've got to get control of the budget ... It is out of
control," Reagan said as he began the meeting.
Reagan, appearing fresh and enthusiastic after his long
night of inaugural celebrations, began his first full day as
president with another ceremony.
He and Vice President George Bush attended the East
Room swearing-in of the senior White House staff mem
bers.
Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger adminis
tered the oath to the 38 staff members who included Baker
and Edwin Meese 111, the counselor to the president who is
the only staff member who also is a member of the Cabi
net.
Reagan plans to decontrol oil
Washington — The Reagan administration will soon re
move price controls on gasoline and crude oil, and will im
pose a broad freeze on new federal regulations wherever it
can. President Ronald Reagan's budget chief David Stock
man predicted yesterday.
"We're going to freeze everything we legally and techni
cally can," said Stockman, speaking of the new adminis
tration's campaign against federal regulation of the econ
omy.
Stockman, awaiting Senate confirmation as director of
the Office of Management and Budget, said no decision has
been made yet on decontrol of oil and gasoline, but he
noted that President Reagan and top members of the new
administration made clear commitments to decontrol
during the campaign. He told an audience at the National
Press Club that they should "assume those commitments
will be implemented shortly."
Immediate decontrol could add 12 cents a gallon to
gasoline pump prices, raising overall consumer prices by
about half a percentage point this year, according to some
estimates, but Reagan and his advisers believe the federal
energy controls have discouraged exploration and dis
rupted the distribution of gasoline during shortages and
are determined to do away with them as soon as possible.
At several points in his speech, Stockman sought to de
fend the Reagan administration's intention to ask for a
large, multiyear cut in personal and corporate taxes — a
move that threatens to worsen the federal budget deficit
and thus add to inflationary pressures.
The Reagan administration's goal will be to reduce total
federal spending over the next five years, Stockman said.
"There will be no increase even for the inflation that oc
curs each year . . ." he said.
Stockman didn't disclose the magnitude of the tax and
spending policies Reagan will propose, but he said the
package will be designed to "shock and shift the economy
on a different path."
The sharp cuts in federal spending that the Reagan ad
ministration wants, would, if approved by Congress, make
it easier for the Federal Reserve Board to control the

growth of the money supply more closely and, in Stock
man's view, that is the key to reducing inflation signifi
cantly over the next two or three years.
Price controls on U.S.-produced crude oil and gasoline
are due to expire Sept. 30 and a Reagan administration de
cision to decontrol in February would permit an increase
in gasoline pump prices of 10-12 cents a gallon if com
petitive conditions permit service stations operators to
pass along the full amount. Early action by Reagan would
roughly double the price impact of decontrol. If gasoline
and domestic oil aren't decontrolled until Sept. 30, the
price increase would be about 6 cents a gallon, assuming
no increase in world oil prices by then.
Kennedys announce divorce plans
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and his
wife Joan, side-by-side campaigners as he sought the
Democratic presidential nomination last year, announced
yesterday they plan to divorce after 22 years of marriage.
They had been living apart — he in suburban Washing
ton, she in Boston — although Mrs. Kennedy appeared fre
quently with her husband during his failed effort to wrest
his party's nomination from Jimmy Carter.
In a statement issued by Kennedy's Senate office in both
their names, the couple said "appropriate legal proceed
ings will be commenced in due course."
They have three children.
A spokesman for Kennedy declined comment on where
the divorce proceedings would be initiated.
Energy Dept. calls for UC lab review
Berkeley — The U.S. Department of Energy has called
for an urgent review of a University of California plan re
quiring greater public scrutiny of nuclear weapons labora
tories at Livermore and Los Alamos, N.M.
Duane Sewell, an assistant secretary of energy, has
asked DOE officials to call a meeting with the university
to "define appropriate and acceptable oversight mecha
nisms," according to Joe LaGrone, of the department's
San Francisco office.
The two labs develop all the nuclear weapons in the
United States.
LaGrone said DOE officials want to make sure the su
pervision will not have "an adverse impact" on work at
the labs.
The Energy Department is deciding whether to renew
the university's contract to operate the labs.
Both Sewell and the University of California Board of
Regents have expressed a desire to renew the contract,
which expires in September, 1982.
The new oversight plan calls for two new committees to
monitor scientific work and environmental health ajid
safety at the labs. The regents approved the plan in No
vember after the university was pressured to sever its as
sociation with the labs.
Grand jury indicts Synanon members
Sacramento — Eighteen present and former Synanon
members have been indicted by the Marin County Grand
Jury on charges stemming from the alleged kidnaping and
beating in 1978 of a former member, Attorney General
George Deukmejian said yesterday.
One of those listed in the indictment, Howard Garfield
of San Francisco, surrendered on yesterday. Garfield,
once head of Synanon s law offices, was released on his
own recognizance and his attorney said he was near an
agreement that would eliminate Garfield from the indict
ment.
The victim was identified as Kim Myers. Deukmejian
said he could give no details of the evidence because the

grand jury transcript has been sealed by the court.
Articles last week in the San Francisco Chronicle and
the Independent Journal in San Rafael said Synanon
members believed Myers was an employee of Time maga
zine, which Synanon had sued for libel. The libel case later
was dropped by Synanon.
Several telephone calls were made to Synanon head
quarters for comment, but the calls were not returned.
Deukmejian said the defendants would be surrendering
for arraignment in Marin County yesterday and today. Ar
raignment was scheduled for 9 a.m. today before Superior
Court Judge Joseph Wilson.
Deukmejian said the charges were the first filed as the
result of his office's continuing investigation of "various
allegations against Synanon members."
Those charged with kidnaping were identified as Leon
Levy, Arnett Jamison, Jon Kaufman, William Lundberg,
Doug Muhly, Bruce Levine, Doug Robson, Philip
Bourdette, David Benjamin and Andy Cretella.
Deukmejian said false imprisonment charges were
made against Levy, Robson, Lundberg, Kaufman, Levine,
Jamison, Sid Frank. Rodney Mullen and Theodore Drib
ble.
Levy, Robson, Kaufman and Frank were charged with
assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily in
jury, Deukmejian said.
He said Bourdette, Benjamin, David Gomez, Liz Mis
sakian. Chris Haberman, Ronald Cook and Garfield were
charged with being an accessory to a felony.
The court set initial bail of $10,000 for those charged
with kidnaping and $5000 for the others, Deukmejian said.

Stockman didn't disclose the magnitude of the tax and
spending policies Reagan will propose, but he said the
package will be designed to "shock and shift the economy
on a different path."
The sharp cuts in federal spending that the Reagan ad
ministration wants, would, if approved by Congress, make
it easier for the Federal Reserve Board to control the

growth of the money supply more closely and, in Stock
man's view, that is the key to reducing inflation signifi
cantly over the next two or three years.
Price controls on U.S.-produced crude oil and gasoline
are due to expire Sept. 30 and a Reagan administration de
cision to decontrol in February would permit an increase
in gasoline pump prices of 10-12 cents a gallon if com
petitive conditions permit service stations operators to
pass along the full amount. Early action by Reagan would
roughly double the price impact of decontrol. If gasoline
and domestic oil aren't decontrolled until Sept. 30, the
price increase would be about 6 cents a gallon, assuming
no increase in world oil prices by then.
Kennedys announce divorce plans
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and his
wife Joan, side-by-side campaigners as he sought the
Democratic presidential nomination last year, announced
yesterday they plan to divorce after 22 years of marriage.
They had been living apart — he in suburban Washing
ton, she in Boston — although Mrs. Kennedy appeared fre
quently with her husband during his failed effort to wrest
his party's nomination from Jimmy Carter.
In a statement issued by Kennedy's Senate office in both
their names, the couple said "appropriate legal proceed
ings will be commenced in due course."
They have three children.
A spokesman for Kennedy declined comment on where
the divorce proceedings would be initiated.
Energy Dept. calls for UC lab review
Berkeley — The U.S. Department of Energy has called
for an urgent review of a University of California plan re
quiring greater public scrutiny of nuclear weapons labora
tories at Livermore and Los Alamos, N.M.
Duane Sewell, an assistant secretary of energy, has
asked DOE officials to call a meeting with the university
to "define appropriate and acceptable oversight mecha
nisms," according to Joe LaGrone, of the department's
San Francisco office.
The two labs develop all the nuclear weapons in the
United States.
LaGrone said DOE officials want to make sure the su
pervision will not have "an adverse impact" on work at
the labs.
The Energy Department is deciding whether to renew
the university's contract to operate the labs.
Both Sewell and the University of California Board of
Regents have expressed a desire to renew the contract,
which expires in September, 1982.
The new oversight plan calls for two new committees to
monitor scientific work and environmental health ajid
safety at the labs. The regents approved the plan in No
vember after the university was pressured to sever its as
sociation with the labs.
Grand jury indicts Synanon members
Sacramento — Eighteen present and former Synanon
members have been indicted by the Marin County Grand
Jury on charges stemming from the alleged kidnaping and
beating in 1978 of a former member, Attorney General
George Deukmejian said yesterday.
One of those listed in the indictment, Howard Garfield
of San Francisco, surrendered on yesterday. Garfield,
once head of Synanon s law offices, was released on his
own recognizance and his attorney said he was near an
agreement that would eliminate Garfield from the indict
ment.
The victim was identified as Kim Myers. Deukmejian
said he could give no details of the evidence because the

grand jury transcript has been sealed by the court.
Articles last week in the San Francisco Chronicle and
the Independent Journal in San Rafael said Synanon
members believed Myers was an employee of Time maga
zine, which Synanon had sued for libel. The libel case later
was dropped by Synanon.
Several telephone calls were made to Synanon head
quarters for comment, but the calls were not returned.
Deukmejian said the defendants would be surrendering
for arraignment in Marin County yesterday and today. Ar
raignment was scheduled for 9 a.m. today before Superior
Court Judge Joseph Wilson.
Deukmejian said the charges were the first filed as the
result of his office's continuing investigation of "various
allegations against Synanon members."
Those charged with kidnaping were identified as Leon
Levy, Arnett Jamison, Jon Kaufman, William Lundberg,
Doug Muhly, Bruce Levine, Doug Robson, Philip
Bourdette, David Benjamin and Andy Cretella.
Deukmejian said false imprisonment charges were
made against Levy, Robson, Lundberg, Kaufman, Levine,
Jamison, Sid Frank. Rodney Mullen and Theodore Drib
ble.
Levy, Robson, Kaufman and Frank were charged with
assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily in
jury, Deukmejian said.
He said Bourdette, Benjamin, David Gomez, Liz Mis
sakian. Chris Haberman, Ronald Cook and Garfield were
charged with being an accessory to a felony.
The court set initial bail of $10,000 for those charged
with kidnaping and $5000 for the others, Deukmejian said.
Reapportionment causes conflicts
Sacramento — The new Democratic leaders of the state
Senate and Assembly appeared headed yesterday for a
clash over reapportionment of California's congressional
districts.
Saying "the Senate is alive and well," Senate President
Pro Tem David Roberti announced that he would not allow
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and his congressional al
lies to dictate new districts.
"Reapportionment will not be accomplished in the first
person singular by any legislator," an obviously angry
Roberti said at a Capitol news conference.
The Los Angeles Democrat was responding to recent
Brown statements, including a comment that Rep. Phil
Burton, a close Brown ally, would draw new congressional
districts.
Brown, like Burton a San Francisco Democrat, was also
quoted Tuesday as saying:
—He wants to create a second "safe" Hispanic con
gressional seat in Los Angeles County. There is currently
one Mexican-American in the state's 43-member House
delegation.
—Two black congressmen, Reps. Augustus Hawkins CD-
Los Angeles) and Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) who sup
ported Brown's election as speaker, would have veto
power over the location of their districts, but two other
black lawmakers, Reps. Mervyn Dymally and Julian Dix
on. both Los Angeles Democrats, would not.
Roberti said the Assembly and Senate should each "take
the lead" in redrawing their respective districts, but
should share responsibility for congressional seats, sched
uled to increase from 43 to 45 or 46.
He said the chairmen of the Legislature's reapportion
ment committees, Sen. Dan Boatwright (D-Concord) and
Assemblyman Richard Alatorre (D-Los Angeles) had
agreed to those points.
Roberti said he didn't oppose the idea of another Mexi
can-American district, but objected to Brown's vow to
give some congressmen vetos.

Group forms to oppose benefit cuts
Washington — A massive coalition of more than 100 na
tional organizations is getting ready to battle President
Ronald Reagan if he proposes major Social Security cuts.
The group, representing millions of aged, retired and
disabled persons, is headed by Wilbur Cohen, former sec
retary of Health, Education and Welfare under President
Lyndon Johnson and one of the fathers of the Social Secur
ity program.
Called SOS for "Save Our Security," the group was
formed two years ago to fight the Carter administration
when it proposed a series of Social Security cutbacks. With
Cohen and others tramping the halls of Congress, it helped
stave off all the Carter proposals except reduction of dis
ability insurance benefits.
"We will reactivate the organization if they propose
cuts," said Cohen in a telephone interview from the Lyn
don Johnson School at the University of Texas, where he is
now a professor.
The giant Social Security system will pay more than
$159 billion in fiscal 1982 to nearly 40 million retired and
disabled persons and their dependents, plus $57 billion for
medicare. But the system is running into short-term fi
nancing problems for the next few years because the cost
of living and the rate of unemployment are rising faster
than expected in 1977, when new taxes were voted to put
the system on a sound basis.
Reagan pledges fail to boost stocks
New York — Stock prices drifted lower yesterday in the
third straight day of losses, despite a government report of
strong economic activity in the final three months of 1980
and a Reagan administration pledge to "jolt" the economy
to recovery.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped
4.43 points to 946.25 after giving up 20.31 points on Tuesday
following Reagan's inauguration and dipping 2.30 points
Monday.
Big Board volume reached 39.19 million shares, down
from 41.75 million on Tuesday.
Today's weather
Rain likely today. Decreasing chance of showers to
night. Partly cloudy tomorrow after a chance of morning
showers. Lows in the upper 40s and 50s. Highs in the mid
50s to mid 60s today and 50s tomorrow. Southerly winds 15
to 25 mph this morning. Chance of measureable rain 60
percent today and 30 percent tonight night.

Reagan, Cabinet discuss economy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan spent his first
full day in the Oval Office yesterday, held a Cabinet meet
ing devoted to the economy and took part in another swear
ing-in ceremony, this one for his senior White House aides.
David Stockman, Reagan's choice to head the Office of
Management and Budget, said that oil and gasoline prices
will be decontrolled soon, a move that could lead to an in
crease of 12 cents a gallon at the gas pump if all the in
crease is passed through.
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said the FBI has been unable
to substantiate allegations against Reagan's choice to
head the Labor Department, Raymond Donovan.
Reagan aides said he will not be able to abolish the infla
tion-monitoring Council on Wage and Price Stability in his
first few days in office, as he had planned and promised.
"We've got to get control of the budget ... It is out of
control," Reagan said as he began the meeting.
Reagan, appearing fresh and enthusiastic after his long
night of inaugural celebrations, began his first full day as
president with another ceremony.
He and Vice President George Bush attended the East
Room swearing-in of the senior White House staff mem
bers.
Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger adminis
tered the oath to the 38 staff members who included Baker
and Edwin Meese 111, the counselor to the president who is
the only staff member who also is a member of the Cabi
net.
Reagan plans to decontrol oil
Washington — The Reagan administration will soon re
move price controls on gasoline and crude oil, and will im
pose a broad freeze on new federal regulations wherever it
can. President Ronald Reagan's budget chief David Stock
man predicted yesterday.
"We're going to freeze everything we legally and techni
cally can," said Stockman, speaking of the new adminis
tration's campaign against federal regulation of the econ
omy.
Stockman, awaiting Senate confirmation as director of
the Office of Management and Budget, said no decision has
been made yet on decontrol of oil and gasoline, but he
noted that President Reagan and top members of the new
administration made clear commitments to decontrol
during the campaign. He told an audience at the National
Press Club that they should "assume those commitments
will be implemented shortly."
Immediate decontrol could add 12 cents a gallon to
gasoline pump prices, raising overall consumer prices by
about half a percentage point this year, according to some
estimates, but Reagan and his advisers believe the federal
energy controls have discouraged exploration and dis
rupted the distribution of gasoline during shortages and
are determined to do away with them as soon as possible.
At several points in his speech, Stockman sought to de
fend the Reagan administration's intention to ask for a
large, multiyear cut in personal and corporate taxes — a
move that threatens to worsen the federal budget deficit
and thus add to inflationary pressures.
The Reagan administration's goal will be to reduce total
federal spending over the next five years, Stockman said.
"There will be no increase even for the inflation that oc
curs each year . . ." he said.
Stockman didn't disclose the magnitude of the tax and
spending policies Reagan will propose, but he said the
package will be designed to "shock and shift the economy
on a different path."
The sharp cuts in federal spending that the Reagan ad
ministration wants, would, if approved by Congress, make
it easier for the Federal Reserve Board to control the

growth of the money supply more closely and, in Stock
man's view, that is the key to reducing inflation signifi
cantly over the next two or three years.

now a professor.
The giant Social Security system will pay more than
$159 billion in fiscal 1982 to nearly 40 million retired and
disabled persons and their dependents, plus $57 billion for
medicare. But the system is running into short-term fi
nancing problems for the next few years because the cost
of living and the rate of unemployment are rising faster
than expected in 1977, when new taxes were voted to put
the system on a sound basis.

Reagan, Cabinet discuss economy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan spent his first
full day in the Oval Office yesterday, held a Cabinet meet
ing devoted to the economy and took part in another swear
ing-in ceremony, this one for his senior White House aides.
David Stockman, Reagan's choice to head the Office of
Management and Budget, said that oil and gasoline prices
will be decontrolled soon, a move that could lead to an in
crease of 12 cents a gallon at the gas pump if all the in
crease is passed through.
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said the FBI has been unable
to substantiate allegations against Reagan's choice to
head the Labor Department, Raymond Donovan.
Reagan aides said he will not be able to abolish the infla
tion-monitoring Council on Wage and Price Stability in his
first few days in office, as he had planned and promised.
"We've got to get control of the budget ... It is out of
control," Reagan said as he began the meeting.
Reagan, appearing fresh and enthusiastic after his long
night of inaugural celebrations, began his first full day as
president with another ceremony.
He and Vice President George Bush attended the East
Room swearing-in of the senior White House staff mem
bers.
Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger adminis
tered the oath to the 38 staff members who included Baker
and Edwin Meese 111, the counselor to the president who is
the only staff member who also is a member of the Cabi
net.
Reagan plans to decontrol oil
Washington — The Reagan administration will soon re
move price controls on gasoline and crude oil, and will im
pose a broad freeze on new federal regulations wherever it
can. President Ronald Reagan's budget chief David Stock
man predicted yesterday.
"We're going to freeze everything we legally and techni
cally can," said Stockman, speaking of the new adminis
tration's campaign against federal regulation of the econ
omy.
Stockman, awaiting Senate confirmation as director of
the Office of Management and Budget, said no decision has
been made yet on decontrol of oil and gasoline, but he
noted that President Reagan and top members of the new
administration made clear commitments to decontrol
during the campaign. He told an audience at the National
Press Club that they should "assume those commitments
will be implemented shortly."
Immediate decontrol could add 12 cents a gallon to
gasoline pump prices, raising overall consumer prices by
about half a percentage point this year, according to some
estimates, but Reagan and his advisers believe the federal
energy controls have discouraged exploration and dis
rupted the distribution of gasoline during shortages and
are determined to do away with them as soon as possible.
At several points in his speech, Stockman sought to de
fend the Reagan administration's intention to ask for a
large, multiyear cut in personal and corporate taxes — a
move that threatens to worsen the federal budget deficit
and thus add to inflationary pressures.
The Reagan administration's goal will be to reduce total
federal spending over the next five years, Stockman said.
"There will be no increase even for the inflation that oc
curs each year . . ." he said.
Stockman didn't disclose the magnitude of the tax and
spending policies Reagan will propose, but he said the
package will be designed to "shock and shift the economy
on a different path."
The sharp cuts in federal spending that the Reagan ad
ministration wants, would, if approved by Congress, make
it easier for the Federal Reserve Board to control the

growth of the money supply more closely and, in Stock
man's view, that is the key to reducing inflation signifi
cantly over the next two or three years.
Price controls on U.S.-produced crude oil and gasoline
are due to expire Sept. 30 and a Reagan administration de
cision to decontrol in February would permit an increase
in gasoline pump prices of 10-12 cents a gallon if com
petitive conditions permit service stations operators to
pass along the full amount. Early action by Reagan would
roughly double the price impact of decontrol. If gasoline
and domestic oil aren't decontrolled until Sept. 30, the
price increase would be about 6 cents a gallon, assuming
no increase in world oil prices by then.
Kennedys announce divorce plans
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and his
wife Joan, side-by-side campaigners as he sought the
Democratic presidential nomination last year, announced
yesterday they plan to divorce after 22 years of marriage.
They had been living apart — he in suburban Washing
ton, she in Boston — although Mrs. Kennedy appeared fre
quently with her husband during his failed effort to wrest
his party's nomination from Jimmy Carter.
In a statement issued by Kennedy's Senate office in both
their names, the couple said "appropriate legal proceed
ings will be commenced in due course."
They have three children.
A spokesman for Kennedy declined comment on where
the divorce proceedings would be initiated.
Energy Dept. calls for UC lab review
Berkeley — The U.S. Department of Energy has called
for an urgent review of a University of California plan re
quiring greater public scrutiny of nuclear weapons labora
tories at Livermore and Los Alamos, N.M.
Duane Sewell, an assistant secretary of energy, has
asked DOE officials to call a meeting with the university
to "define appropriate and acceptable oversight mecha
nisms," according to Joe LaGrone, of the department's
San Francisco office.
The two labs develop all the nuclear weapons in the
United States.
LaGrone said DOE officials want to make sure the su
pervision will not have "an adverse impact" on work at
the labs.
The Energy Department is deciding whether to renew
the university's contract to operate the labs.
Both Sewell and the University of California Board of
Regents have expressed a desire to renew the contract,
which expires in September, 1982.
The new oversight plan calls for two new committees to
monitor scientific work and environmental health ajid
safety at the labs. The regents approved the plan in No
vember after the university was pressured to sever its as
sociation with the labs.
Grand jury indicts Synanon members
Sacramento — Eighteen present and former Synanon
members have been indicted by the Marin County Grand
Jury on charges stemming from the alleged kidnaping and
beating in 1978 of a former member, Attorney General
George Deukmejian said yesterday.
One of those listed in the indictment, Howard Garfield
of San Francisco, surrendered on yesterday. Garfield,
once head of Synanon s law offices, was released on his
own recognizance and his attorney said he was near an
agreement that would eliminate Garfield from the indict
ment.
The victim was identified as Kim Myers. Deukmejian
said he could give no details of the evidence because the

grand jury transcript has been sealed by the court.
Articles last week in the San Francisco Chronicle and
the Independent Journal in San Rafael said Synanon
members believed Myers was an employee of Time maga
zine, which Synanon had sued for libel. The libel case later
was dropped by Synanon.
Several telephone calls were made to Synanon head
quarters for comment, but the calls were not returned.
Deukmejian said the defendants would be surrendering
for arraignment in Marin County yesterday and today. Ar
raignment was scheduled for 9 a.m. today before Superior
Court Judge Joseph Wilson.
Deukmejian said the charges were the first filed as the
result of his office's continuing investigation of "various
allegations against Synanon members."
Those charged with kidnaping were identified as Leon
Levy, Arnett Jamison, Jon Kaufman, William Lundberg,
Doug Muhly, Bruce Levine, Doug Robson, Philip
Bourdette, David Benjamin and Andy Cretella.
Deukmejian said false imprisonment charges were
made against Levy, Robson, Lundberg, Kaufman, Levine,
Jamison, Sid Frank. Rodney Mullen and Theodore Drib
ble.
Levy, Robson, Kaufman and Frank were charged with
assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily in
jury, Deukmejian said.
He said Bourdette, Benjamin, David Gomez, Liz Mis
sakian. Chris Haberman, Ronald Cook and Garfield were
charged with being an accessory to a felony.
The court set initial bail of $10,000 for those charged
with kidnaping and $5000 for the others, Deukmejian said.
Reapportionment causes conflicts
Sacramento — The new Democratic leaders of the state
Senate and Assembly appeared headed yesterday for a
clash over reapportionment of California's congressional
districts.
Saying "the Senate is alive and well," Senate President
Pro Tem David Roberti announced that he would not allow
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and his congressional al
lies to dictate new districts.
"Reapportionment will not be accomplished in the first
person singular by any legislator," an obviously angry
Roberti said at a Capitol news conference.
The Los Angeles Democrat was responding to recent
Brown statements, including a comment that Rep. Phil
Burton, a close Brown ally, would draw new congressional
districts.
Brown, like Burton a San Francisco Democrat, was also
quoted Tuesday as saying:
—He wants to create a second "safe" Hispanic con
gressional seat in Los Angeles County. There is currently
one Mexican-American in the state's 43-member House
delegation.
—Two black congressmen, Reps. Augustus Hawkins CD-
Los Angeles) and Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) who sup
ported Brown's election as speaker, would have veto
power over the location of their districts, but two other
black lawmakers, Reps. Mervyn Dymally and Julian Dix
on. both Los Angeles Democrats, would not.
Roberti said the Assembly and Senate should each "take
the lead" in redrawing their respective districts, but
should share responsibility for congressional seats, sched
uled to increase from 43 to 45 or 46.
He said the chairmen of the Legislature's reapportion
ment committees, Sen. Dan Boatwright (D-Concord) and
Assemblyman Richard Alatorre (D-Los Angeles) had
agreed to those points.
Roberti said he didn't oppose the idea of another Mexi
can-American district, but objected to Brown's vow to
give some congressmen vetos.

Group forms to oppose benefit cuts
Washington — A massive coalition of more than 100 na
tional organizations is getting ready to battle President
Ronald Reagan if he proposes major Social Security cuts.
The group, representing millions of aged, retired and
disabled persons, is headed by Wilbur Cohen, former sec
retary of Health, Education and Welfare under President
Lyndon Johnson and one of the fathers of the Social Secur
ity program.
Called SOS for "Save Our Security," the group was
formed two years ago to fight the Carter administration
when it proposed a series of Social Security cutbacks. With
Cohen and others tramping the halls of Congress, it helped
stave off all the Carter proposals except reduction of dis
ability insurance benefits.
"We will reactivate the organization if they propose
cuts," said Cohen in a telephone interview from the Lyn
don Johnson School at the University of Texas, where he is
now a professor.
The giant Social Security system will pay more than
$159 billion in fiscal 1982 to nearly 40 million retired and
disabled persons and their dependents, plus $57 billion for
medicare. But the system is running into short-term fi
nancing problems for the next few years because the cost
of living and the rate of unemployment are rising faster
than expected in 1977, when new taxes were voted to put
the system on a sound basis.
