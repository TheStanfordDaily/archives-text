# Carter condemns Iranians for 'savagery' after emotional meeting with hostages
## 
### Washington Post 
Wiesbaden, West Germany —
Former president Jimmy Carter, af
ter an emotional meeting with the re
leased hostages, denounced Iran last
night for a "despicable act of
savagery" and said the Americans'
captors subjected them to previously
concealed "acts of barbarism" that
"can never be condoned."
Carter's suddenly strong language
reflected 14 Vi months of irritation
built up as he sought to obtain release
of the 52 captive Americans through
threats, sanctions,* negotiations and,
at one point last April, a failed com
mando raid. Breaking a self-imposed
pattern of restraint on the issue,
Carter's outburst followed an 80-
minute private visit with the returned

hostages that an aide described as
"emotional to the point of awkward
ness."
Carter embraced the returned
Americans one by one in a third-floor
community room of the hospital here
and tears frequently welled in his
eyes, according to officials present.
He was photographed with each one of
them, they added.
After the meeting, Carter said he
told the hostages that "Iran suffered
severely" from its acts and that in the
resolution of the long crisis "ter
rorism has been proved not to pay."
"This proves we could not be forced
to pay ransom," he added. He paused,
beginning to smile for the only time
during the statement, and went on:
"Because — and they started to cheer
when I said this — out of the $12 billion
in Iranian assets that I froze after they
took the hostages, we are paying them
only about $3 billion of their own mon
ey."
Echoing the same theme as Carter
and basing its assessment on in
terviews with the hostages, the U.S.
State Department issued a statement
here accusing Iran of "serious mis
treatment in a number of cases" dur
ing the hostages' captivity.
Neither Carter nor the State De
partment cited any specific abuses to
back up their charges. The State De
partment promised further reports
"on the facts as they emerge" and
added:
"The medical team at the
Wiesbaden Air Force hospital has con
ducted preliminary conversations
throughout the day with the 52 Ameri
cans who have been freed from Iran.

We want to stress that this evaluation
of their experiences is preliminary in
nature and that no comprehensive
judgments can be made at this time."
Carter, speaking out for the first
time as a private citizen with all the
hostages back safe in American
hands, was less cautious. "Our Ameri
cans were mistreated much worse
than has been previously revealed,"
he said. "The acts of barbarism which
were perpetrated on our people by
Iran can never be condoned."
Aides to the former president said
some hostages were put in front of
what they called "mock firing
squads" as part of mental and physi
cal torture during their imprison
ment. Hamilton Jordan, Carter's
former chief of staff, said Carter was
"clearly outraged" by the hostages'
account of how they had been treated
by the Iranians who held them for 444
days.
The former hostages themselves,
celebrating their first full day of free
dom in the West, slept and talked to
gether in what for many was the first
opportunity to compare experiences
during their ordeal.
While the reports filtered out of
their sufferings, they stayed largely
out of public sight within the white
walls of the military hospital. Jack
Cannon, a State Department spokes
man, gave only one general account
early in the day of the ex-captives' in
itial hours of regained freedom.
Much of the free hostages' time dur
ing their 12-hour flight to freedom
from Iran via Greece and Algeria to
Frankfurt yesterday morning was
spent getting to know each other again

after being split up when taken
hostage Nov. 4,1979. "They were shar
ing experiences they had during the
last 14 months," Cannon told re
porters.
It is expected that an important part
of the readjustment process for the
former captives — in addition to talks
with families, friends and doctors —
will be sessions with each.pther in or
der to sort out, compare andUrtfctftT
their individual kidnapping ex
periences.
As soon as the Algerian 727 passen
ger jet that ferried them from Tehran
to Algiers was airborne Tuesday
night, Cannon said, "Everyone
loosened their seatbelts and im
mediately rapped with each other in a
great communal get-togetherness.
"It was, we are told, the first time
during the entire time they were in
carcerated that they had been togeth
er," he added.
As they returned into American
hands, Cannon said, they also "were
very intent on discussing what has
been going on in the world," during the
time they were cut off.
Indicating that as hostages they
were still held in separate groups to
the very end, Cannon said, "There was
some indication that some of the peo
ple had very little notice at all" before
being freed, "perhaps 15 or 20
minutes," while others "had several
days."
But Cannon was unable to elaborate
on this. Nor could he give anything but
imprecise answers to many other
questions posed by an army of
newsmen here regarding the behavior
and history of the former hostages.

captors subjected them to previously
concealed "acts of barbarism" that
"can never be condoned."
Carter's suddenly strong language
reflected 14 Vi months of irritation
built up as he sought to obtain release
of the 52 captive Americans through
threats, sanctions,* negotiations and,
at one point last April, a failed com
mando raid. Breaking a self-imposed
pattern of restraint on the issue,
Carter's outburst followed an 80-
minute private visit with the returned

hostages that an aide described as
"emotional to the point of awkward
ness."
Carter embraced the returned
Americans one by one in a third-floor
community room of the hospital here
and tears frequently welled in his
eyes, according to officials present.
He was photographed with each one of
them, they added.
After the meeting, Carter said he
told the hostages that "Iran suffered
severely" from its acts and that in the
resolution of the long crisis "ter
rorism has been proved not to pay."
"This proves we could not be forced
to pay ransom," he added. He paused,
beginning to smile for the only time
during the statement, and went on:
"Because — and they started to cheer
when I said this — out of the $12 billion
in Iranian assets that I froze after they
took the hostages, we are paying them
only about $3 billion of their own mon
ey."
Echoing the same theme as Carter
and basing its assessment on in
terviews with the hostages, the U.S.
State Department issued a statement
here accusing Iran of "serious mis
treatment in a number of cases" dur
ing the hostages' captivity.
Neither Carter nor the State De
partment cited any specific abuses to
back up their charges. The State De
partment promised further reports
"on the facts as they emerge" and
added:
"The medical team at the
Wiesbaden Air Force hospital has con
ducted preliminary conversations
throughout the day with the 52 Ameri
cans who have been freed from Iran.

We want to stress that this evaluation
of their experiences is preliminary in
nature and that no comprehensive
judgments can be made at this time."
Carter, speaking out for the first
time as a private citizen with all the
hostages back safe in American
hands, was less cautious. "Our Ameri
cans were mistreated much worse
than has been previously revealed,"
he said. "The acts of barbarism which
were perpetrated on our people by
Iran can never be condoned."
Aides to the former president said
some hostages were put in front of
what they called "mock firing
squads" as part of mental and physi
cal torture during their imprison
ment. Hamilton Jordan, Carter's
former chief of staff, said Carter was
"clearly outraged" by the hostages'
account of how they had been treated
by the Iranians who held them for 444
days.
The former hostages themselves,
celebrating their first full day of free
dom in the West, slept and talked to
gether in what for many was the first
opportunity to compare experiences
during their ordeal.
While the reports filtered out of
their sufferings, they stayed largely
out of public sight within the white
walls of the military hospital. Jack
Cannon, a State Department spokes
man, gave only one general account
early in the day of the ex-captives' in
itial hours of regained freedom.
Much of the free hostages' time dur
ing their 12-hour flight to freedom
from Iran via Greece and Algeria to
Frankfurt yesterday morning was
spent getting to know each other again

after being split up when taken
hostage Nov. 4,1979. "They were shar
ing experiences they had during the
last 14 months," Cannon told re
porters.
It is expected that an important part
of the readjustment process for the
former captives — in addition to talks
with families, friends and doctors —
will be sessions with each.pther in or
der to sort out, compare andUrtfctftT
their individual kidnapping ex
periences.
As soon as the Algerian 727 passen
ger jet that ferried them from Tehran
to Algiers was airborne Tuesday
night, Cannon said, "Everyone
loosened their seatbelts and im
mediately rapped with each other in a
great communal get-togetherness.
"It was, we are told, the first time
during the entire time they were in
carcerated that they had been togeth
er," he added.
As they returned into American
hands, Cannon said, they also "were
very intent on discussing what has
been going on in the world," during the
time they were cut off.
Indicating that as hostages they
were still held in separate groups to
the very end, Cannon said, "There was
some indication that some of the peo
ple had very little notice at all" before
being freed, "perhaps 15 or 20
minutes," while others "had several
days."
But Cannon was unable to elaborate
on this. Nor could he give anything but
imprecise answers to many other
questions posed by an army of
newsmen here regarding the behavior
and history of the former hostages.
