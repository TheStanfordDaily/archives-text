# Prof analyzes U. S. -Europe relations on dealing with Russia, arms control

Sharply differing interpretations of
key international issues could strain
relations between the United States
and Western Europe, according to
Stanley Hoffman, a government pro
fessor at Harvard University who
spoke here yesterday to a group of
nearly 150 students and faculty.
The speech, entitled "Current Is
sues in European-American Rela
tions" was sponsored by the newly
created Committee to Promote Eu
ropean Studies.
Hoffman, chairman of the Center
for European Studies at Harvard, is
regarded in political science circles as
one of the most perceptive interna
tional affairs analysts.
He said that while the basic sub
stance of relations has remained cons
tant in the 35 years since World War 11,
"It is important to see where dis
agreement lies."
With respect to the Soviet Union, for
example, Hoffman contended that the
major issue separating Europe and
the United States is not over the ques
tion "Is there a Soviet threat?"
Said Hoffman, "No one believes the
USSR, is a pussycat; everybody
looks at the U S S R as a tiger."
The real question, he argued, is
"What makes the Soviet Union a
tiger?"
The predominant U.S. view, he said,

likens the Soviet Union to an "uncon
trollable and unstoppable tank" bent
on world domination.
According to this theory, the in
ternal weaknesses of the Soviet Union
make the country more dangerous be
cause expansion becomes the only
way to "paper over internal crises."
The conclusion which follows from
this view, he added, is that "there is no
hope of affecting the monster except
by resistance."
Western Europe, on the other hand,
while keenly aware of Soviet ag
gression, does not consider the
U S S R, inherently expansionist.
Rather. Europe views the Soviet
Union as a "trapped tiger" bordered
by hostile NATO powers in the west
and China in the east.
According to this conception, the
Soviet Union is "like a man about to
jump out of a window," who needs to
be talked to and cooled down.
Strategic arms limitation is another
example of disagreement cited by
Hoffman.
In the United States arms control
has become a "dirty word," he said.
The mere mention of arms control
in this country, he said, "would be like
dancing the tango in the Beatles age."
To the contrary. Western Europe,
which has not developed a disarma
ment policy, favors U.S. arms con
cessions.

Differences also exist in the concep
. tion of the overall international affairs
problem, Hoffman said.
The view espoused by former Secre
tary of State Henry Kissinger that has
been adopted by the Reagan adminis
tration, looks at the world as essen
tially bipolar, he said.
According to this conception "eve
rything is reducible to and determined
by U.S. Soviet relations."
In this "good guys vs. bad guys"
view, all Third World countries are
either radical, meaning Soviet domi
nated, or moderate, meaning friendly
to the United States. Repression and
torture in "moderate" regimes are
less consequential than support for
American policies.
Hoffman condemned this outlook as
a "dangerous simplification
"Mainkind has suffered much more
from terrible simplifiers than terrible
complicators."
The European view, on the other
hand, does not see the world as
basically bipolar, but instead recog
nizes the intricate international
crosscurrents and the "many coun
tries trying to run their own affairs
their own way," he said.
Despite these and other diver
gences. Hoffman stated at the outset
that the foundations of U.S.-European
relations have been basically stable.

According to this conception "eve
rything is reducible to and determined
by U.S. Soviet relations."
In this "good guys vs. bad guys"
view, all Third World countries are
either radical, meaning Soviet domi
nated, or moderate, meaning friendly
to the United States. Repression and
torture in "moderate" regimes are
less consequential than support for
American policies.
Hoffman condemned this outlook as
a "dangerous simplification
"Mainkind has suffered much more
from terrible simplifiers than terrible
complicators."
The European view, on the other
hand, does not see the world as
basically bipolar, but instead recog
nizes the intricate international
crosscurrents and the "many coun
tries trying to run their own affairs
their own way," he said.
Despite these and other diver
gences. Hoffman stated at the outset
that the foundations of U.S.-European
relations have been basically stable.
