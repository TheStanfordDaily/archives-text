## New member country and executive face 1980s EEC responds to need for reform 
### Los Angeles Times 
Brussels. Belgium — With a
new member country and a new
executive, the European Eco
nomic Community faces a new
decade that many experts see as
crucial to the future of Western
Europe.
The addition of Greece gives
the community, also known as
the European Common Market,
its 10th member and a total pop
ulation of almost 270 million.
More important, however,
the addition of Greece and the
installation of a new com
mission under President Gaston
Thorn of Luxembourg has
ushered in a new era that may
determine whether the Europe
an integration movement will
find new impetus or struggle
along in the hesitant path fol
lowed for most of the last dec
ade.
One crucial issue facing the
new leaders is possible
bankruptcy in about a year if the
afoiln subsidy program is
not reformed. This consumes
nearly three-fourths of the
budget.
Another problem is the addi
tion of Greek as a seventh of
ficial language.
Interpreters needed
"We do not have any in
terpreters for translating from
Dutch or Danish to Greek, but
we are training people and ex
pect everyone to be flexible," a
commission spokesman said.
The Common Market is only
one, though the best known, of
the three European com
munities that combined their in
stitutions under terms of a 1965
treaty that went into effect in
1967. The other two are the Eu
ropean Coal and Steel Com
munity and the European Atom
ic Energy Community. Each of
the 10-member nations belongs

to all three communities.
For many experts, the decade
of the '80s is crucial for the Com
mon Market because it is set on
a course of expanding its mem
bership to 12 — adding Portugal
and Spain — before it has car
ried out the internal overhaul
that has been recommended
year after year.
European leaders still make
solemn pledges to move the
community toward closer politi
cal and economic harmony, but
the record of the past few years
has been otherwise. Instead of
bold new initiatives, the com
munity has been largely content
to concentrate on administering
the authority it has. mainly con
trolling the sale of food products
in a way that protects the
farmers at the expense of the
consumer.
Effects of new member
The admission of Greece is
unlikely to have dramatic ef
fects on the community, which
is smaller than the United
States in area and economic out
put even though it exceeds it in
population. But this enlarge
ment of the community's mem
bership may help focus the con
centration of the older members
on getting their houses in order
before Spain and Portugal join.
When they become members,
the community will be more
clearly divided between the
have-not countries and the bet
ter-off countries. There will be
Greece. Spain. Portugal. Ire
land and Italy on the one hand
and France, West Germany.
Britain. Denmark. Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg
on the other.
The lack of economic integra
tion between the two groups,
which is now an embarrass
ment. could then be so divisive
as to create what many ob

servers have called a "two
speed Europe."
The immediate effect of
Greece's joining will be to make
commission decision-making
more difficult. Originally in
tended to be the driving force
for European unity with its
members largely divorced from
national control, the com
mission has been reduced to a
board that proposes cautious
policies that might win accep
tance from the more powerful
Council of Ministers.
Council powers increase
The council, which was seen
originally as an advisory group
to the commission, consists of
representatives from the mem
ber governments' Cabinets. The
council, over the years, has
taken over the job of writing pol
icy and leaving it to the com
mission to carry it out.
The commission consists of 14
members — two from each of
the four larger countries and
one from each of the smaller
countries. They serve 4-year
terms.
Over the years, the quality of
commissioners has de
teriorated since European poli
ticians have recognized that an
assignment in Brussels is not
likely to enhance their domestic
careers. The chance of getting
sharp decision-making from the
commission has also seemed to
diminish as the circle of mem
bers has expanded.
The presidency of the com
mission. which is rotated among
the member countries, has been
seen as possibly a position of
substantial importance. Such
hopes were expressed when Roy
Jenkins took the job four years
ago, since he had been a British
Labor Party Cabinet member
and a strong pro-European in a
party that continues to oppose

Britain's Common Market
membership.
Looking back on Jenkin's re
cord, British journalists have
given him special credit for in
itiating the new European Mon
etary System, which links all
the community members' cur
rencies with the exception of the
British pound; for elevating the
presidency so that it takes part
in world and European econom
ic summit meetings, and for
helping solve a community
budget crisis over Britain's
paying an excessive share.
Thorn, a short, lively man
who has been president of the
United Nations General As
sembly and prime minister of
his country, started his new job
with the usual routine of divid
ing responsibilities among the
individual commissioners.

European leaders still make
solemn pledges to move the
community toward closer politi
cal and economic harmony, but
the record of the past few years
has been otherwise. Instead of
bold new initiatives, the com
munity has been largely content
to concentrate on administering
the authority it has. mainly con
trolling the sale of food products
in a way that protects the
farmers at the expense of the
consumer.
Effects of new member
The admission of Greece is
unlikely to have dramatic ef
fects on the community, which
is smaller than the United
States in area and economic out
put even though it exceeds it in
population. But this enlarge
ment of the community's mem
bership may help focus the con
centration of the older members
on getting their houses in order
before Spain and Portugal join.
When they become members,
the community will be more
clearly divided between the
have-not countries and the bet
ter-off countries. There will be
Greece. Spain. Portugal. Ire
land and Italy on the one hand
and France, West Germany.
Britain. Denmark. Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg
on the other.
The lack of economic integra
tion between the two groups,
which is now an embarrass
ment. could then be so divisive
as to create what many ob

servers have called a "two
speed Europe."
The immediate effect of
Greece's joining will be to make
commission decision-making
more difficult. Originally in
tended to be the driving force
for European unity with its
members largely divorced from
national control, the com
mission has been reduced to a
board that proposes cautious
policies that might win accep
tance from the more powerful
Council of Ministers.
Council powers increase
The council, which was seen
originally as an advisory group
to the commission, consists of
representatives from the mem
ber governments' Cabinets. The
council, over the years, has
taken over the job of writing pol
icy and leaving it to the com
mission to carry it out.
The commission consists of 14
members — two from each of
the four larger countries and
one from each of the smaller
countries. They serve 4-year
terms.
Over the years, the quality of
commissioners has de
teriorated since European poli
ticians have recognized that an
assignment in Brussels is not
likely to enhance their domestic
careers. The chance of getting
sharp decision-making from the
commission has also seemed to
diminish as the circle of mem
bers has expanded.
The presidency of the com
mission. which is rotated among
the member countries, has been
seen as possibly a position of
substantial importance. Such
hopes were expressed when Roy
Jenkins took the job four years
ago, since he had been a British
Labor Party Cabinet member
and a strong pro-European in a
party that continues to oppose

Britain's Common Market
membership.
Looking back on Jenkin's re
cord, British journalists have
given him special credit for in
itiating the new European Mon
etary System, which links all
the community members' cur
rencies with the exception of the
British pound; for elevating the
presidency so that it takes part
in world and European econom
ic summit meetings, and for
helping solve a community
budget crisis over Britain's
paying an excessive share.

Brussels. Belgium — With a
new member country and a new
executive, the European Eco
nomic Community faces a new
decade that many experts see as
crucial to the future of Western
Europe.
The addition of Greece gives
the community, also known as
the European Common Market,
its 10th member and a total pop
ulation of almost 270 million.
More important, however,
the addition of Greece and the
installation of a new com
mission under President Gaston
Thorn of Luxembourg has
ushered in a new era that may
determine whether the Europe
an integration movement will
find new impetus or struggle
along in the hesitant path fol
lowed for most of the last dec
ade.
One crucial issue facing the
new leaders is possible
bankruptcy in about a year if the
afoiln subsidy program is
not reformed. This consumes
nearly three-fourths of the
budget.
Another problem is the addi
tion of Greek as a seventh of
ficial language.
Interpreters needed
"We do not have any in
terpreters for translating from
Dutch or Danish to Greek, but
we are training people and ex
pect everyone to be flexible," a
commission spokesman said.
The Common Market is only
one, though the best known, of
the three European com
munities that combined their in
stitutions under terms of a 1965
treaty that went into effect in
1967. The other two are the Eu
ropean Coal and Steel Com
munity and the European Atom
ic Energy Community. Each of
the 10-member nations belongs

to all three communities.
For many experts, the decade
of the '80s is crucial for the Com
mon Market because it is set on
a course of expanding its mem
bership to 12 — adding Portugal
and Spain — before it has car
ried out the internal overhaul
that has been recommended
year after year.
