# U.S., Algeria may enter era of improved relations
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — American officials, praising the
way Algeria carried out its role as intermediary
in the U.S.-Iran hostage negotiation, believe the
episode will have an important impact on improv
ing relations between this country and the social
ist government in Algiers.
Though it is not clear to what extent, if any, the
Algerians share this view, if a better relationship
does flow from the ties formed in recent months it
could be a significant plus for the West generally,
officials believe, because Algeria's is an impor
tant voice among so-called Third World countries
and because it could add to a loosening of Algerian
ties to Moscow.
' "There is no question that this has been an im
portant episode and it is widely recognized that
we owe Algeria a greal deal, a major debt of grat
itude," another official said. The Algerians, he
said, put their top government officials and cen
tral bankers "entirely at our disposal. They were
superb intermediaries, meticulous nego
tiators . . . accurate, objective, impartial, pa
tient and painstaking in every knotty issue."
Important impact
"It can't help but have an important impact,"
he added, "on the Algerian image in this country
with the public, the Congress and the new admin
istration."
Prior to 1979, when President Chadhi Bendjedid
took over after the death of the more radical and
hard-line President Houari Boumediene, political
relations between Washington and Algiers had
been bad for many years. The militant socialist
leadership in the north African country had pro
vided safe haven for terrorists and airplane hi
jackers and encouraged various national liber
ation movements.
In recent years, however, the new Bendjedid
government, in the view of U.S. and European
diplomats, has become more pragmatic and re
laxed, broadening its contacts with the West gen
erally while retaining its revolutionary creden
tials and thus its voice in the world of developing
and non-aligned nations.
According to U.S. officials, the Algerians have
privately "shown an enormous amount of good
will" during the trying hostage negotiations.
American expressions of thanks have been re
peatedly extended by Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher on behalf of former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and Secretary of State Ed
mund Muskie. The Algerians, on the other hand,
are more reserved and subtle, not wanting to be
politically embarrassed by any public American
embrace, officials indicate.
Though Algeria has serious economic prob

lems, the country is rich in oil and natural gas and,
even during the years of bad political relations,
trade ties with the U.S. flourished. In the first six
months of this year, for example, the U.S. ex
ported $315 million worth of goods to Algeria,
mostly technology and industrial products, while
the U.S. imported $4.1 billion, mostly oil and gas.
But several other positive and little-noted de
velopments in other areas of relations unfolded in
the months before Algeria was brought in, at the
suggestion of Iran, in November to serve as the
third party intermediary. It is the prospect of the
positive experience of the hostage negotiations
building on these earlier developments that leads
officials to believe important improvements are
possible.
—Late in September, a U.S. Navy frigate
docked at the port of Algiers, the first American
warship to visit there in 17 years and an event that
was looked upon as an important sign by both
sides.
—In November, the United States quickly pro
vided about $4 million in aid and medical as
sistance in the wake of a devastating earthquake
in Algeria.
—Though the Algerians have been, and still are,
overwhelmingly dependent on Moscow for mili
tary aid, the United States was able to establish a
defense attache in Algiers in the past year and
Washington has approved an Algerian request to
have a similar military liaison officer here.
Unhappy with invasion
Officials also say they have the feeling that
Algiera wants to diversify away from its very
heavy reliance on Moscow for arms and there is
widespread agreement among western officials
that Algeria is also clearly unhappy with Mos
cow's invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979.
On the negative side, the longstanding dispute
with Algeria continues over American support of
Morocco in the lingering war being fought in the
western Sahara against Polisario guerrillas,
backed by Algiers.
The most crucial immediate bilateral problem,
however, lies in a multibillion-dollar liquefied
natural gas (LNG) deal between the two countries
in which negotiators have thus far failed to break
a nine-month impasse over the Algerian decision
to triple the price.
While State Department officials clearly would
like to see an equitable solution for foreign policy
reasons, the matter is mostly in the hands of the
Energy Department and the stakes are huge and
controversial. Officials here say the U.S. could
not give Algeria a higher price without doing the
same for Mexico and Canada, which together sup
ply almost five times as much LNG as Algiers.

officials to believe important improvements are
possible.
—Late in September, a U.S. Navy frigate
docked at the port of Algiers, the first American
warship to visit there in 17 years and an event that
was looked upon as an important sign by both
sides.
—In November, the United States quickly pro
vided about $4 million in aid and medical as
sistance in the wake of a devastating earthquake
in Algeria.
—Though the Algerians have been, and still are,
overwhelmingly dependent on Moscow for mili
tary aid, the United States was able to establish a
defense attache in Algiers in the past year and
Washington has approved an Algerian request to
have a similar military liaison officer here.
Unhappy with invasion
Officials also say they have the feeling that
Algiera wants to diversify away from its very
heavy reliance on Moscow for arms and there is
widespread agreement among western officials
that Algeria is also clearly unhappy with Mos
cow's invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979.
On the negative side, the longstanding dispute
with Algeria continues over American support of
Morocco in the lingering war being fought in the
western Sahara against Polisario guerrillas,
backed by Algiers.
The most crucial immediate bilateral problem,
however, lies in a multibillion-dollar liquefied
natural gas (LNG) deal between the two countries
in which negotiators have thus far failed to break
a nine-month impasse over the Algerian decision
to triple the price.
While State Department officials clearly would
like to see an equitable solution for foreign policy
reasons, the matter is mostly in the hands of the
Energy Department and the stakes are huge and
controversial. Officials here say the U.S. could
not give Algeria a higher price without doing the
same for Mexico and Canada, which together sup
ply almost five times as much LNG as Algiers.
Washington — American officials, praising the
way Algeria carried out its role as intermediary
in the U.S.-Iran hostage negotiation, believe the
episode will have an important impact on improv
ing relations between this country and the social
ist government in Algiers.
Though it is not clear to what extent, if any, the
Algerians share this view, if a better relationship
does flow from the ties formed in recent months it
could be a significant plus for the West generally,
officials believe, because Algeria's is an impor
tant voice among so-called Third World countries
and because it could add to a loosening of Algerian
ties to Moscow.
' "There is no question that this has been an im
portant episode and it is widely recognized that
we owe Algeria a greal deal, a major debt of grat
itude," another official said. The Algerians, he
said, put their top government officials and cen
tral bankers "entirely at our disposal. They were
superb intermediaries, meticulous nego
tiators . . . accurate, objective, impartial, pa
tient and painstaking in every knotty issue."
Important impact
"It can't help but have an important impact,"
he added, "on the Algerian image in this country
with the public, the Congress and the new admin
istration."
Prior to 1979, when President Chadhi Bendjedid
took over after the death of the more radical and
hard-line President Houari Boumediene, political
relations between Washington and Algiers had
been bad for many years. The militant socialist
leadership in the north African country had pro
vided safe haven for terrorists and airplane hi
jackers and encouraged various national liber
ation movements.
In recent years, however, the new Bendjedid
government, in the view of U.S. and European
diplomats, has become more pragmatic and re
laxed, broadening its contacts with the West gen
erally while retaining its revolutionary creden
tials and thus its voice in the world of developing
and non-aligned nations.
According to U.S. officials, the Algerians have
privately "shown an enormous amount of good
will" during the trying hostage negotiations.
American expressions of thanks have been re
peatedly extended by Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher on behalf of former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and Secretary of State Ed
mund Muskie. The Algerians, on the other hand,
are more reserved and subtle, not wanting to be
politically embarrassed by any public American
embrace, officials indicate.
Though Algeria has serious economic prob

lems, the country is rich in oil and natural gas and,
even during the years of bad political relations,
trade ties with the U.S. flourished. In the first six
months of this year, for example, the U.S. ex
ported $315 million worth of goods to Algeria,
mostly technology and industrial products, while
the U.S. imported $4.1 billion, mostly oil and gas.
But several other positive and little-noted de
velopments in other areas of relations unfolded in
the months before Algeria was brought in, at the
suggestion of Iran, in November to serve as the
third party intermediary. It is the prospect of the
positive experience of the hostage negotiations
building on these earlier developments that leads
officials to believe important improvements are
possible.
