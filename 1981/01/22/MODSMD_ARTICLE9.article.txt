# U.S. banks come out ahead
## Terms of release may lead to litigations 
### Washington Post 
The Iranian-American financial settle
ment, details of which were revealed Tues
day, is an agreement that gives something
to all the parties involved.
But some clearly gained more than oth
ers, a fact assuring that it will be the subject
of lawsuits for years to come.
—Iran got back $2.8 billion of its own mon
ey, which had been frozen and beyond its
reach for 14 months.
However, at least $4 billion worth of Ira
nian assets remains frozen pending the res
olution of legal claims by U.S. banks, com
panies and individuals.
—Iran also secured the removal of trade
restrictions that had prevented it from
buying goods not only in the United States
but in Western Europe.
—Major American banks wind up in a far
better position than they were before then-
President Jimmy Carter's freeze order of

Nov. 14, 1979.
Under the agreement, $3.7 billion of their
loans to the former government of the late
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi were paid
back Tuesday, 100 cents on the dollar, and a
procedure was established for repayment of
$1.4 billion in additional loans the banks had
made to other Iranian borrowers.
Yet 14 months ago, just before the freeze
was instituted, officials of the regime of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini were threat
ening not to repay any of these loans, and to
withdraw their deposits from the banks.
—Companies and individuals with finan
cial claims against the Iranian government
are assured of a legal procedure for seeking
damages or compensation for unpaid bills
and lost property or equipment. The forum
is the International Arbitral Tribunal.
However, unlike the banks, the com
panies have no assurance that they will be

reimbursed the full values of their claims.
The U.S. government will have the right to
appoint only one third of the tribunal's
members, and it could be years before the
claims are settled.
Under the agreement's terms, money to
pay off valid claims of the companies and in
dividuals will begin to move into a special
account, from still-frozen Iranian accounts
in the United States, in the next six months.
This special "security" account will be be
filled until it reaches $1 billion. Iran has also
agreed to keep at least $500 million in this
account until all disputes are settled.
More than 300 claims suits totaling more
than $3 billion already have been filed
against the Iranian government in U.S.
courts, and the Treasury Department has
identified 3000 companies or individuals
who have additional claims pending, though
not in court.
