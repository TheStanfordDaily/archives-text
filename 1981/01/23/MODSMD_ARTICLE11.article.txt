# Energy reduction depends on feedback, awareness
## Center aids campus conservation 
### Debbie Walker 
Tucked away in the basement
of Crothers Hall is a single
room office. Light filters in
through a ground level window
to reveal walls plastered with
charts and conservation
posters. A sink in the corner is
heaped with light bulbs of as
sorted shapes and sizes.
A large desk dominates the
room, and behind it sits a smil
ing young man - "Hello, I'm
John Eaton."
Eaton is the director of the
Housing Energy Conservation
Center (HECC) at Stanford, a
position originated by Housing
and Food Service in 1977 in re
sponse to rising energy costs.
A human biology major who
graduated from Stanford, Eaton
began working at the HECC full
time last spring when the
former director, Karl Johnson,
began working for the Energy
Program Office. Eaton is now
joined by five student aides.
"Our obvious goal is to reduce
energy use in student resi
dences," Eaton said. "More
specifically, this year we hope
to achieve a 10 percent reduc
tion from last year's electricity
use."
Consumption decreases
As compared to the base year
1976, before the program
started, total electricity con
sumption in student residences
has decreased 20 percent.
Eaton said an important tool
in achieving this decrease is stu
dent education and awareness
of energy matters. He added
that most students do not realize
that reductions in energy con
sumption will be reflected in

room and board payments.
"Savings are not being
pocketed by the University,"
Eaton said. One of the most suc
cessful results of public aware
ness attempts is the network of
student energy representatives.
A student in each University
residence reads his or her
electricity meter, maintains
consumption charts and keeps
in touch with the HECC
"We used to call them energy
czars," Eaton said, "But that
term has faded out."
At the beginning of the year,'
Eaton asked resident assistants
to find a student interested in
acting as a liason between the
students and the HECC. He said
some beneficial relationships
have been established.
Student feedback
"The more feedback we get,
the better off we are," Eaton
said. "It's also great to have
someone in the residence to say
Hey, we're way above our goal
line - let's do something.' For in
stance there's an energy rep at
Alpha Sig who is K really getting
involved. He asks for advice and
takes action and for the first
time we're beginning to register
energy use reductions there."
Students working with the
HECC have prepared a slide
show defining common "energy
guzzlers" in University resi
dences, such as refrigerators
and water beds. Eaton said they
try to coordinate presentation
with houses that are not doing so
well.
And how does the HECC de
termine which residences are
doing well? Each building has
an electricity meter which is

read monthly by University em
ployees. In the Row Houses, nat
ural gas consumption can be
charted, and Eaton mentioned
that new water meters have
been installed in Crothers Hall
and Wilbur.
Eaton stressed, however,
that reduction in energy use is
coming not only from student ef
forts, but also from technical
measures implemented by the
HECC.
The installation of con
troversial low-flow shower
heads in 1979 cost the University
$12,350. At the conclusion of the
1979-80 academic year, the
showerheads were responsible
for over $150,000 in energy sav
ings.
During the spring and sum
mer of 1978, over 130,000 square
feet of attic space was insulated
in dormitories and row houses.
In the summer of 1979, the row
houses were outfitted with pipe
insulation for hot water piping
and water tank inserts were in
stalled in toilets "to reduce the
water usage per flush."
The HECC also prepared the
proposal which entitles Stan
ford to a $1.2 million HUD loan
for several specified energy
saving projects. These include
the installation of fluorescent
lights in common areas, more
insulation in attics and walls
and them modification and up
grading of heating controls in
dorms and row houses.
"The estimated annual sav
ings resulting from these
projects should be between
$200,000 and $250,000," Eaton
said. "Hopefully they will be
fully implemented by August

1981."
A new feature of the HECC is
the Student Project Fund, a
source of financing for student
energy-related projects.
Fundraising cyclists
Last summer two students
decided to combine bicycling
with fundraising for the HECC.
They obtained sponsors for their
two-wheeled trek from Stanford
to their homes in Wilmette, Illi
nois and designated that their
earnings be placed in a specal
HECC fund for student use. The
cyclists are still in the process
of collecting the pledges, but es
timate the fund will total ap
proximately $11,000.
Eaton listed several possible
uses of the fund , construction of
a solar system, a publicity cam
paign, insulating window shades
and conservation research.
Eaton said the HECC is eager
to review student proposals.
And if you should want to sub
mit a proposal, or pick up a list
of energy saving tips or just
meet "the head energy czar,"
Eaton assures all that a visit to
the HECC will not be a waste of
time or energy.
