Without question, Alexander Haig has
an impressive military record and an in
timate knowledge of the workings of a bu
reaucracy. He is qualified to be Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or even to head
the Defense Department.
He is not qualified to be secretary of
state.
Reagan has pledged that his secretary
of state will be the person he relies on to
articulate and implement American for
eign policy. Yet a look at record makes
one question the wisdom of picking Haig to
take on such an overwhelming responsi
bility.
" A secretary of state needs to utilize all
the tools of diplomacy. But rather than see
military force has an unpalatable last re
sort, Haig has consistently demonstrated
that he believes in the indiscriminate
threat and use of such force. When coupled
with his obsessive Soviet-centered view of
the world, it is clear that the Third World
can expect very little sympathy from
Haig. His testimony at his confirmation
hearings and his complicity in the destruc
tion of Cambodia makes it clear the Haig

considers Third World nations to be pawns
in an American realpolitik chess game
with the Soviets. His attitude can only be
counterproductive to our long-term in
terests in the region.
And one cannot be certain of Haig's
moral judgments. When Haig served as
Henry Kissinger's deputy at the National
Security Council he was heavily involved
in the illegal wiretapping of other
divisions of the executive branch. The
available evidence indicates that Haig,
far from questioning this clearly un
constitutional activity, in fact actively
participated in it.
Thus one must ask, along with Sen. Paul
Tsongas (D-Mass.), one of the two sena
tors to vote against Haig's confirmation in
the Foreign Relations Subcommittee,
whether "the risks inherent in having all
those enormous skills not properly
focused by a dominant sense of moral
purpose" are worth it in Haig's case.
We don't think so, are we are saddened
that the Senate confirmed such a man as
secretary of state.
