## The 						University: education or corporation? 
### 
Is Stanford University an
educational institution or a cor
poration? It's both. Stanford is a
center of learning for students
and faculty. It is a multi-mil
lion-dollar education business,
with sizable financial holdings,
managed by financial provosts,
vice presidents, and a board of
trustees.
The recent front-page article
in the Daily ("Vice Provost
Bacchetti seeks balanced
budget for fiscal 1981", Jan. 20)
raises the ominous specter of a
University that is turning away
from its traditional educational
pursuits, towards a more typi
cally corporate outlook on its
priorities.
As a graduate student. I am
concerned what this change in
perspective — particularly as it
is reflected in the continual de
cline in financial support for
graduate study — is going to do
to the quality of educational life
at Stanford. As a graduate stu
dent in computer science, I am
most fortunate to be generously
supported by my department's
own research funds, and largely
free of the budget-making de
cisions of the University. But I
write on behalf of my colleagues
and friends in the humanities
and social sciences, for whom
things are far more difficult.
Over the past five years,
there has been a substantial and
frightening decline in support
for graduate study in the hu
manities and social sciences.
Stanford publishes estimates of
expected annual expenses for a
typical graduate student, and
offers a standard support pro
gram (the so-called "Fellows
Program"). Five years ago,
this support was 91 percent of
expected expenses. Today, it
has shrunk to 76 percent. These
figures are provided by the Uni
versity, which most likely un
derestimates the cost of living,
not by some axe-grinding stu
dent group. Unless something is
done to arrest this decline it will
continue.
Why should anyone pay
thousands of dollars a year to be
a humanities or social sciences
graduate student at Stanford,
especially when the academic
job prospects are so bleak? You
may argue that it's certainly
cheaper than being an under
graduate, which next fall will

cost more than $10,000 a
year. But there is an important
difference. Your average grad
uate student, say in philosophy,
is not just holed up in some li
brary pouring over her Kant and
Wittgenstein, and paying for
that privilege. She is grading
papers, teaching classes, and
running discussion sections. She
is an important and essential
part of the educational labor
force, without which the Uni
versity cannot function.
Here is no flowery rhetoric
about the importance of liberal
education and the furthering of
research in the humanities, but
rather a simple fact: that a sub
stantial portion of the educa
tional responsibility of the Uni
versity, particularly the
teaching of undergraduates, is
carried by the graduate stu
dents. They provide a highly
trained and inexpensive source
of labor. Furthermore. Stanford
cannot afford to admit them in
numbers commensurate with
their job prospects, because it
wants a graduate school — but
equally important, because it
depends on them to run a major
part of the educational function
of the University.
I don't propose to make
altruistic saints of graduate stu
dents. Yet in the last analysis,
they have chosen their careers
because of their commitment to
scholarship and teaching. How
ever, the economic realities of
their existence and the depress
ing thought that the adminis
tration does not care about them
is actually getting in the way of
this commitment. It is distract
ing them from their goal.
The disenchantment has a
continued and corrosive effect
on Stanford's reputation as an
educational institution, in terms
of the declining quality of the
graduate school, as well as the
related decline in under
graduate education.
So, where are Stanford's
priorities? The way the Univer
sity spends its money is going to
answer precisely that. The Dai
ly article mentioned above lists
academics and student services
as among the most likely areas
to be cut in the current budget
balancing effort. What is Stan
ford doing cutting academics
while it continues paving roads,
and building dormitories and

other buildings? This edifice
complex mentality ignores the
truth that the University is the
people and the learning process
that is going on between them,
not the buildings in which they
reside.
Naturally, there are many ad
ministrative and non-educa
tional details involved in
managing Stanford. But the
more decisions that are put in
the hands of the economists, the
business types, and the linear
programmers, the more the
focus of the University will
change, and. I am afraid, the
more the educational stature of
Stanford will suffer.
Grad students go; buildings
stay. And linear programming,
the darling of operations re
search and financial planning, is
all about maximizing output and
minimizing costs. There is little
room for any "human factor" in
all of this. We will all be losers if
this University — our Univer
sity — is taken over by bottom
liners.
This fall, Stanford had a
chance to enter the genetic engi
neering field on a profit basis.
Fortunately President Donald
Kennedy turned it down, be
cause he clearly saw that the
business of the University is not
business. It's learning. But will
we have the courage to say no
the second time such an op

portunity arises?
It's true that budget-making
is a lot more complicated than I
am suggesting. But to use the
example that has motivated me
to write, if Stanford decided
that the support of graduate stu
dents was the number one
priority (and I don't believe it
should be), don't you think they
would be well supported? Of
course.
Now relax that priority: does
the status quo really indicate
what the administration thinks
of graduate students? Either it
doesn't, and Stanford ought to
do something about it. Or it
does, and we should all stop pre
tending otherwise.
The University is a big place,
with a lot of different people
wanting different things. As fi
nancial circumstances become
more difficult, the competition
among various interest groups
for their share of Stanford's re
sources will become greater.
But if the traditional educa
tional concerns of the Univer
sity are put aside in times of
trouble — and I believe that sup
port of graduate students is
among the core of these con
cerns — then the educational re
wards we all want to share will
be limited to a privileged few
in our University.
