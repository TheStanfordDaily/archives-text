Immaterial bias
I cannot help but object to
John Halamka's column (Daily,
Jan. 20). Though the argument
he makes is legitimate,
Halamka's persistent use of the
word "thing"' shows a disturb
ing bias against immaterial ob
jects. To be truly inclusive, one
should instead use the term "en
tity" in consideration of every
entity which is not gifted with
material entityness.
To paraphrase our leader,
"Everyone who is a thing al
ready exists." And let us not
forget all those nonentities, who
cannot exist even in concept.
This sort of repression has no
place in our enlightened society.

Daily complaint
It is a given that no one takes
the Daily seriously. But when
your newspaper prints — in fact

solicits — the drivel which regu
larly appears in your daily col
umns (such as David Miller's
article on conscription, Daily,
Jan. 15), then I think that it re
flects a total absence of editori
al function. I would rather see a
blank space reflecting a
threshold of acceptance which
had not been reached than see
print in place because you abhor
a vacuum.
Perhaps the campus should
adopt the style of Chinese
"wall" newspapers whereby in
dividuals can, on their own in
itiative, raise proclamations re
flecting their own views. At
least by such an effort the image
of the Stanford community as
projected by the Daily would be
less tarnished and a few more
trees would survive to shade
your addlepated columnists and
editors from the heat of the sun.
