## UN
						fails to secure a world peace 
### 
After reading Rachelle
Marshall's argument on the
United Nation and Palestine,
(Daily Jan. 20), we quite hon
estly did not know where to be
gin. Her argument that the U.N.
is necessary becomes side
tracked and much of the article
deals with the harsh manner
in which Arabs in Israel are
treated. Because we were dis
satisfied by both her argument
on the United Nations and with
her attempt to justify anti-Is
raeli votes in the U.N., we felt
that both of them need to be re
futed.
Marshall's reasoning on the
larger issue of whether the U.N.
is a justified body has some ma
jor flaws. She devotes almost
her entire column trying to jus
tify the anti-Israeli votes in the
U.N. Yet even she admits that
the Palestinian vote equating
Zionism with racism is not justi
fied.
The fact that the U.N. has not
gone so far as to refuse to recog
nize Israel's right to exist still
does not negate the fact that
they have become preoccupied
with condemning Israel. Her
long list of all the anti-Israeli
resolutions only further proves
this point.
Nowhere in the article does
Marshall show that the U.N. has
done a significant amount to
stop world hunger and suffer

ing Therefore, the validity of
the statement signed by the 11
Stanford faculty that "The U.N.
concentrates on the Palestinian
issue to neglect the suffering
people of the world." still
stands.
After thoroughly neglecting
the crux of the argument
against the U.N., Marshall
comes back with two very weak
arguments. She says that the
U.S. is guilty of the same of
fence as the U.N. because we
give Israel $3 billion worth of
aid. Unfortunately, just because
the U.S. does something does
not justify the existence of the
U.N.
Moreover, the aid $o Israel is
militarily and morally justified.
Without the aid. the balance of
power in the Middle East would
swav.almostcertainly causing a
war. This war would cause
needless suffering and death,
and possibly even involve nucle
ar weapons. Furthermore, Is
rael has longbeen a loyal ally of
the United States and is the only
politically stable government in
the region.
Marhsall's second argument
finally tackles the real issue.
Why do we need the U.N.? Un
fortunately. her response is only
a reiteration of the original
purpose of the U.N. that it
should be a sounding board for
the nations of the world. How
ever. nowhere does Marshall
prove that this has actually hap
pened. No empirical examples
are given where the U.N. has ac
tually done some good.
Where was the U.N. when
Egypt attacked Israel in 1973?
In what corner did it hide when
Russia invaded Afghanistan? In
no instance has it accomplished
any more than individual nor
mal relation between countries.
At this juncture, we should
not fall into the trap and talk
about the Palestinian issue, but
we welcome the opportunity to
set the facts of the issue
straight. In order to do this, it is
necessary to briefly recap the
history of the Palestinian prob
lem.
The Palestinian people as a
distinct group do have real
grievances. However, these
grievances and problems can
not be rightly aimed solely at
the Israeli government.
Harkening back to the ambigui
ty of the Balfour Declaration of
1917. one can see the beginnings
of the present day Arab-Israeli
conflict. Both the Zionists and
Palestinians felt that this docu
ment would insure statehood.
In 1947, the U.N. sought to
partition the territory under the
British mandate into three
parts: a Palestinian State; a

Jewish State; and a neutral
zone. The Arab leaders, headed
by spokesman Jamial Husseini,
rejected the proposal
The declaration of Israeli
statehood on May 14. 1948 simul
taneously drew a combined ef
fort by the Arabs world to de
stroy Israel. This warfare was
contrary to the ideals of the
founder of Zionism, Theodore
Herzl. who envisioned the Jews
and Arabs of Palestine living to
gether in the development and
progress of the state of Israel.
He hoped to raise the standard
of living for both Arabs and
Jews in Palestine.
Herzl's ideals never were re
alized. With the declaration of
Israeli statehood, the Arab lead
ers asked the Palestinians to
leave Israel and live in refugee
camps on the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip. Former Israeli
Prime Minister Golda Meir re
veals in her autobiography that
she had been instructed by Is
raeli's. first Prime Minister,
David Ben Gurion to "persuade
the Arabs on the beach to go
back . . . they have nothing to
fear."
Acting upon her orders, Meir
went to speak with the Arabs
begging them to return to their
homes. Meir states: "They had
only one answer." "We know
there is nothing to fear, but we
have to go. We'll be back." Meir
said she was quite sure that they
would not, not because they
were frightened, but because
they were terrified of being con
sidered traitors to the Arab
cause." In this manner the
Palestinians fled to their
brethren countries. For 29 years
(until the 1967 war), Palesti
nians. remained sub-citizens
among their own Arab brethren.
To this day, the Arab coun
tries have made little or no at
tempt to absorb their brethren

and raise their standard of liv
ing The surrounding Arab coun
tries have used the Palestinian
refugees as an assailing arm
against Israel and diverts the
population's attention from eco
nomic. political, and social in
justices in their own countries.
Regarding the situation on
the West Bank referred to by
Marshall, the governmental
structure has remained the
same there as under Jordanian
rule, with two exceptions: wom
en and non-landowners who
were denied voting rights under
Jordan were granted the free
dom to vote in Municipal elec
tions. Moreover, the standard of
living on the West Bank and
Gaza strip for Arabs is much
higher than for those Arabs liv
ing outside of Israel.
Marshall fails to prove that
the U.N. is a necessary body of
vital for peace. The fact that it
has blatantly failed to recognize
the P.L.O. for its terrorism but
always condemns Israel for re
taliating against terrorist bases
does not say much for the validi
ty of a U.N. vote. The Soviet
Block and those countries with
oil have always been able to
blackmail other countries into
voting their way.
The U.N. is far from a fair
body. Marshall's assertion that
Israel violates human rights is
simplistic, and fails to recog
nize the fact that Israel is sur
rounded by hostile nations.
Think back and ask yourself
whether the United Nations is
really a fair and equitable body.
Looking at the facts; you'll find
the answer is no. Prof. Flory
and the other 10 signers of the
document are to be com
mended.
