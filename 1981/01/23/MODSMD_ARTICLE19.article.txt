## A 						season for Beijing reflections 
### 
They say autumn in Beijing is
the best season. It is warm, and
the Mongolian winds that blow
up from November until late
summer are but mere breezes.
The autumn sky is deep rich
blue, a stark contrast with the
grey, bustling city and small,
hardy people who live slowly in
their stone houses, wearing col
orless clothing while they work
to the buzz of neon and horse
drawn carts in cold cement
buildings. Above this sits the
impersonal sky, an observer
sent from another planet, noting
each new factory, each new
smile, yet not caring one way or
another.
Life here is very simple.
There is plenty of food in the
stores; apples, oranges, pork,
bai cai (a long, white-green veg
etable with an addicting sour
taste, much like very intense
Romaine lettuce). Bai Cai is
everywhere: on windowsills,
front porches, in fields, on
clerks' desks and apartment
floors, drying and waiting for
consumption in winter.
The winds come and the tem
perature drops. The sky turns
amazing hlue, the sun washes
over the city and it is, again,
warm. But winter will soon be
here. Many fear winter; it is
when the poor suffer the most
and poverty is most noticeable
because you can feel it day in
and day out, from gust to gust of
biting cold, desert wind.
It's damn strange to be stuck
in the middle of a World so dif
ferent from the one in which I
grew up. In my world there
were no steam engines puffing
slowly past, emanating such a
good heat, black and red, with
blue-hatted engineers recalling
a childhood reverie. In my
world there were no two-room
brick and wooden roofed shacks
inhabited by top scientists. But
the shocks I had expected to
have, the feelings of 'Oh boy,
now I've really done it,' the
weeks of nervous stomach pains
before leaving my country all
seem useless and a little ridicu
lous now This feeling is not
jadedness; rather it is an at
tempt to understand things

from within their context, that
the Chinese are just as amazed
at my face and my strange walk
as an African's first encounter
with snow after a lifetime of
seeing it only on a distant mon
taintop.
I think the real shock will be
in returning home. I'll only re
alize the changes upon guzzling
my first cool glass of orange
juice or when I sit down to a his
tory class or drive down a Cali
fornia highway, wind on my
face, radio playing. Then I'll
stop and think of this city, of
these good people, of my small

white room and the little tree
outside my window. I'll think of
the Great Wall covered in red
autumnal ivy, of the peasants
threshing sorghum in
Shanhaiguan, of Huhehof and
the incredible Mongolian cheek
boned face, and of my friend
Wang playing Bach on his violin
while I slowly study my Chinese
characters. Only then will the
process of habit be broken and
my memory freed to act like a
drug upon my mind.
