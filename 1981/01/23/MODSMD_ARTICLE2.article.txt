# New regulations forestall federal loans
## 
### J. Raymond Mills 
Lending institutions participating in the Califor
nia Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) Program have
temporarily halted the processing and approval of
loans to new borrowers until they receive final in
structions from the federal government on how to
institute a new lending bill.
The bill, called the Education Amendments of
1980. became effective on January 1, 1981, and sig
nificantly alters the GSL programs. But lenders are
still awaiting final federal regulations concerning
the implementation of the bill. Until the regulations
are received, guarantee agencies and banks will not
be able to revise their forms and procedures to com
ply with the new laws.
The new GSL s require an increased interest rate
of 9 percent, compared to 7 percent under the old
program. Furthermore the grace period — the time
allowed after completion of studies before students
must begin to repay their loans — has been short
ened from 9 months to 6 months for a period of in
struction beginning on or after January 1.
Nt-w loan limits
However the bill also raises the aggregate loan
limits for each category of student borrowers. The
new loan limits are as follows:
— Dependent undergraduates: annual loan limit,
$2500; aggregate loan limit, $12,500;
— Independent undergraduates: annual loan limit.

$3000; aggregate loan limit, $15,000;
— Graduate or professional students; annual loan
limit, $5000; aggregate loan limit. $25,000.
As the aggregate loan limits suggest, GSL loans
are now available to students who choose to extend
their studies beyond the traditional 4-year period.
Student demand for GSL's has been steadily ris
ing since a bill entitled the Middle Income Student
Assistance Act was passed in 1978. This bill removed
parental income from the criteria for applying,
making it possible for any enrolled student to re
ceive these loans.
Stanford Financial Aids Office records indicate
that the office has already received 3900 applica
tions for GSL's during this academic year, while
only 3300 applications were received for the entire
year in 1979-80. This huge increase in paper flow is
one problem that lending institutions are trying to
alleviate during the loan suspension period.
More loans requested
"Volume is a problem", said Tom Harrison,
Chase Manhattan Bank's vice president of student
10an.,. "At orui point we increased our staff from 40
to 100 employees in order to handle the tremendous
influx of loan applications."
Harrison said Chase Manhattan is now introduc
ing a new computerized system to expedite the loan
process.
Roberta Johnson, the University's assistant di

rector of loans, noted that the flood of applications
to banks has markedly increased the amount of time
required to process them. "In 1979-80 borrowers
were receiving funds within four to six weeks after
their applications were received by lending institu
tions," she said. "This year most banks have been
taking from three to four months to disburse loan
checks."
Old loans unaffected
Johnson emphasized that the temporary sus
pension of GSL loans and the new amendments app
ly to first-time borrowers only. Students who have
outstanding GSL indebtedness at the 7 percent in
terest rate under the nine-month grace period may
continue to apply for the loans under these terms.
Furthermore, if a borrower does not have GSL in
debtedness on the date the promissory note is
signed, but the loan is for a period of instruction
which began prior to January 1, 1981, the interest
rate will be 7 percent and the grace period nine
months.
Johnson said she expects banks to begin accepting
and processing new borrower loan applications
within four weeks at the latest. As of now Chase
Manhattan Bank, Citibank and Bank of America are
accepting new borrower applications for pre
liminary review, but will not begin disbursing funds
until new federal regulations have been completely
implemented into the loan process.

must begin to repay their loans — has been short
ened from 9 months to 6 months for a period of in
struction beginning on or after January 1.
Nt-w loan limits
However the bill also raises the aggregate loan
limits for each category of student borrowers. The
new loan limits are as follows:
— Dependent undergraduates: annual loan limit,
$2500; aggregate loan limit, $12,500;
— Independent undergraduates: annual loan limit.

$3000; aggregate loan limit, $15,000;
— Graduate or professional students; annual loan
limit, $5000; aggregate loan limit. $25,000.
As the aggregate loan limits suggest, GSL loans
are now available to students who choose to extend
their studies beyond the traditional 4-year period.
Student demand for GSL's has been steadily ris
ing since a bill entitled the Middle Income Student
Assistance Act was passed in 1978. This bill removed
parental income from the criteria for applying,
making it possible for any enrolled student to re
ceive these loans.
Stanford Financial Aids Office records indicate
that the office has already received 3900 applica
tions for GSL's during this academic year, while
only 3300 applications were received for the entire
year in 1979-80. This huge increase in paper flow is
one problem that lending institutions are trying to
alleviate during the loan suspension period.
More loans requested
"Volume is a problem", said Tom Harrison,
Chase Manhattan Bank's vice president of student
10an.,. "At orui point we increased our staff from 40
to 100 employees in order to handle the tremendous
influx of loan applications."
Harrison said Chase Manhattan is now introduc
ing a new computerized system to expedite the loan
process.
Roberta Johnson, the University's assistant di

rector of loans, noted that the flood of applications
to banks has markedly increased the amount of time
required to process them. "In 1979-80 borrowers
were receiving funds within four to six weeks after
their applications were received by lending institu
tions," she said. "This year most banks have been
taking from three to four months to disburse loan
checks."
Old loans unaffected
Johnson emphasized that the temporary sus
pension of GSL loans and the new amendments app
ly to first-time borrowers only. Students who have
outstanding GSL indebtedness at the 7 percent in
terest rate under the nine-month grace period may
continue to apply for the loans under these terms.
Furthermore, if a borrower does not have GSL in
debtedness on the date the promissory note is
signed, but the loan is for a period of instruction
which began prior to January 1, 1981, the interest
rate will be 7 percent and the grace period nine
months.
Johnson said she expects banks to begin accepting
and processing new borrower loan applications
within four weeks at the latest. As of now Chase
Manhattan Bank, Citibank and Bank of America are
accepting new borrower applications for pre
liminary review, but will not begin disbursing funds
until new federal regulations have been completely
implemented into the loan process.
