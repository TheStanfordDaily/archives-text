## Plans to build B-1 bomber revived 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Jimmy Carter
thought he had laid it to rest for
ever in the summer of 1977, but
the ghost of the B-l bomber is
again stalking the land. Full
page, full-color advertisements
in aviation journals trumpet the
controversial plane as part of
the "proud heritage" that gave
Jimmy Doolittle his 30 seconds
over Tokyo in World War 11.
"We build a great multi-role
bomber . . . always have," pro
claimed Rockwell Interna
tional, designer of both the B-l
and the B-25 that Doolittle's
raiders flew in the first U.S. at
tack on the Japanese home is
lands almost 40 years ago.
The advertisements are only
one more sign that the pressures
are building on Ronald Rea
gan's incoming administration
to revive the plane that critics
said had grown too costly and
out-of-date almost before it got
off the drawing boards.
The Air Force, which still
wants the plane, contends that
the latest proposed version of
the B-l would be a considerably
better aircraft than the version
the Carter administration killed
three years ago. And, thanks to
newly developed "Stealth"
technology, it would be much
more difficult to stop.
But an updated B-l (known
variously as the B-l V2, son of B-l
and B-l derivative) is not neces

sarily the best technical solu
tion to the manned bomber
needs of the Air Force 10 years
from now, nor the most econom
ic use of money or industrial ca
pacity, according to William
Perry, outgoing Pentagon chief
of research and engineering.
Virtually all defense special
ists believe that some sort of
manned aircraft will be needed
to replace the B-52 fleet, whose
pilots are now often younger
than their planes.
Beginning in 1982, and in
creasingly as the decade
progresses, the B-52s will be
vulnerable to the vastly im
proved Soviet air defense sys
tems. In their low-level pene
tration missions, the B-52s also
will become increasingly unsafe
because of the accumulated
strain on their aging structures.
Cruise missiles
When the Carter adminis
tration canceled the B-l, it
started" a program to equip
about half of the 350 B-52s with
cruise missiles, which are
ground-hugging, pilotless,
small aircraft — like World War
II "buzz bombs," but far better.
Each of the refitted planes
will carry 20 cruise missiles,
which could penetrate Soviet air
space while the B-52s remain
safely outside. The first such
B-52 squadron will be ready in
December 1982, and the last in
1990.

But there would remain the
so-called "bomber vulner
ability window," beginning in
1982 and lasting until an im
proved manned bomber suc
ceeds the B-52 in the penetration
mission, taff for research and
development.
Last year Congress split on
how to close the "bomber gap."
The Senate Armed Services
Committee wanted a
"stretched" FB-111, while its
House counterpart wanted the
updated B-l. As a compromise,
they ordered the Air Force
study, now almost completed.
But stretched FB-llls would
only marginally solve the pene
tration problem, and then not
until at least 1985. They would
be inadequate for long-range
non-nuclear missions. And they
would take planes from the tac
tical air force, where today the
FB-llls are the only all-weather
night interceptors in the U.S. in
ventory.
An updated B-l would cost $12
billion for 100 planes and have
the versatility to perform nucle
ar penetration missions as well
as non-nuclear roles, according
to Lt. Gen Kelly Burke, Air
Force deputy chief of staff for
research and development. In
addition, each plane could carry
30 cruise missiles.
Stealth technology
Streamlined fairings and

elimination of the heat-resis
tant titanium needed in super
sonic flight would be among
changes on the B-l that would
reduce radar reflections. New
plastics and other composite
materials in the plane's surface
would absorb radar waves,
Burke said.
The effect of those measures
would be dramatic. The updated
B-l with its Stealth features
could "hide" in the noise and
clutter of radar waves reflected
from the ground 10 times better
than the original B-l and per
haps 100 times better than the
B-52, sources said.
An aircraft designed from the
wheels up using Stealth technol
ogy would be still another 10
times less visible to detectors,
according to those sources. But
they said such bombers would
not be ready until about 1992 and
would be twice as expensive as
the updated B-l — about $300
million per plane, or $15 billion
for 50 planes.
The bomber decision confron
ting the Reagan administration,
according to most defense spe
cialists, thus comes down to
choosing between the all-new
Stealth bomber and the updated
B-l.
"It's the classic problem,"
Burke said, "of avoiding being
bedazzled by better, when the
good is here and you're not sure
when you'll get the better."

would absorb radar waves,
Burke said.
The effect of those measures
would be dramatic. The updated
B-l with its Stealth features
could "hide" in the noise and
clutter of radar waves reflected
from the ground 10 times better
than the original B-l and per
haps 100 times better than the
B-52, sources said.
An aircraft designed from the
wheels up using Stealth technol
ogy would be still another 10
times less visible to detectors,
according to those sources. But
they said such bombers would
not be ready until about 1992 and
would be twice as expensive as
the updated B-l — about $300
million per plane, or $15 billion
for 50 planes.
The bomber decision confron
ting the Reagan administration,
according to most defense spe
cialists, thus comes down to
choosing between the all-new
Stealth bomber and the updated
B-l.
"It's the classic problem,"
Burke said, "of avoiding being
bedazzled by better, when the
good is here and you're not sure
when you'll get the better."
Washington — Jimmy Carter
thought he had laid it to rest for
ever in the summer of 1977, but
the ghost of the B-l bomber is
again stalking the land. Full
page, full-color advertisements
in aviation journals trumpet the
controversial plane as part of
the "proud heritage" that gave
Jimmy Doolittle his 30 seconds
over Tokyo in World War 11.
"We build a great multi-role
bomber . . . always have," pro
claimed Rockwell Interna
tional, designer of both the B-l
and the B-25 that Doolittle's
raiders flew in the first U.S. at
tack on the Japanese home is
lands almost 40 years ago.
The advertisements are only
one more sign that the pressures
are building on Ronald Rea
gan's incoming administration
to revive the plane that critics
said had grown too costly and
out-of-date almost before it got
off the drawing boards.
The Air Force, which still
wants the plane, contends that
the latest proposed version of
the B-l would be a considerably
better aircraft than the version
the Carter administration killed
three years ago. And, thanks to
newly developed "Stealth"
technology, it would be much
more difficult to stop.
But an updated B-l (known
variously as the B-l V2, son of B-l
and B-l derivative) is not neces

sarily the best technical solu
tion to the manned bomber
needs of the Air Force 10 years
from now, nor the most econom
ic use of money or industrial ca
pacity, according to William
Perry, outgoing Pentagon chief
of research and engineering.
Virtually all defense special
ists believe that some sort of
manned aircraft will be needed
to replace the B-52 fleet, whose
pilots are now often younger
than their planes.
Beginning in 1982, and in
creasingly as the decade
progresses, the B-52s will be
vulnerable to the vastly im
proved Soviet air defense sys
tems. In their low-level pene
tration missions, the B-52s also
will become increasingly unsafe
because of the accumulated
strain on their aging structures.
Cruise missiles
When the Carter adminis
tration canceled the B-l, it
started" a program to equip
about half of the 350 B-52s with
cruise missiles, which are
ground-hugging, pilotless,
small aircraft — like World War
II "buzz bombs," but far better.
Each of the refitted planes
will carry 20 cruise missiles,
which could penetrate Soviet air
space while the B-52s remain
safely outside. The first such
B-52 squadron will be ready in
December 1982, and the last in
1990.

But there would remain the
so-called "bomber vulner
ability window," beginning in
1982 and lasting until an im
proved manned bomber suc
ceeds the B-52 in the penetration
mission, taff for research and
development.
Last year Congress split on
how to close the "bomber gap."
The Senate Armed Services
Committee wanted a
"stretched" FB-111, while its
House counterpart wanted the
updated B-l. As a compromise,
they ordered the Air Force
study, now almost completed.
But stretched FB-llls would
only marginally solve the pene
tration problem, and then not
until at least 1985. They would
be inadequate for long-range
non-nuclear missions. And they
would take planes from the tac
tical air force, where today the
FB-llls are the only all-weather
night interceptors in the U.S. in
ventory.
An updated B-l would cost $12
billion for 100 planes and have
the versatility to perform nucle
ar penetration missions as well
as non-nuclear roles, according
to Lt. Gen Kelly Burke, Air
Force deputy chief of staff for
research and development. In
addition, each plane could carry
30 cruise missiles.
Stealth technology
Streamlined fairings and

elimination of the heat-resis
tant titanium needed in super
sonic flight would be among
changes on the B-l that would
reduce radar reflections. New
plastics and other composite
materials in the plane's surface
would absorb radar waves,
Burke said.
The effect of those measures
would be dramatic. The updated
B-l with its Stealth features
