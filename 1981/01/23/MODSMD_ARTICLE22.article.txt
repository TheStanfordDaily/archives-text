# Must be tested extensively
## Court rules against generic drugs 
### 
Newark, N.J. (AP) — In a decision that a
drug company says would deprive the public
of low-cost drugs, a judge has upheld the
government's right to require that generic
drugs be tested extensively before being
sold.
U.S. District Judge Frederick Lacev
ruled Wednesday that there may be dif
ferences between generic drugs marketed
by Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories
Inc. of South Hackensack and more ex
pensive brand-name products.'ln the case of
one drug, the judge ruled, the difference
could be serious enough to cause a fatal
blood condition.
The judge barred Premo from selling un
tested generic drugs. Testing of drugs can
take from five to 10 years.
Premo maintained it had marketed
proven drugs after the brand-name manu
facturers' patents expired. An attorney for

Premo said the company would "almost
certainly" appeal the ruling.
The marketing of generic drugs has been
widely hailed by consumer groups because
they often are cheaper than brand-name
remedies.
New Jersey has a law requiring doctors
who prescribe drugs to tell their patients
whether generic versions of the drugs are
available.
Eugene Zoppo, an official with the New
Jersey Federation of Senior Citizens, called
the judge's decision a setback to the group's
efforts.
"When we passed a bill in the state Legis
lature for generic drugs, we felt the bill
would save $7 million,"he said. "This kind
of decision is upsetting."
Premo's president, Seymour Blackman,
says the FDA is depriving the public of low
cost drugs.

Lacey held that varying inactive ingre
dients and manufacturing processes caused
critical differences in the rate generic and
brand-name products are absorbed by
users.
This could cause overdoses, the judge
said in a 130-page opinion.
Executive Assistant U.S. Attorney
Charles Walsh had contended that doctors
often believed erroneously that imitations
were equivalent to the more expensive
drugs.
The judge said Premo had failed to test
the rate drugs became effective on patients,
and that one remedy, triamterene, could be
fatal if an overdose were taken.
The drug, used to treat hypertension,
could cause hyperkalemia, or a possibly fa
tal over-concentration of potassium in the
blood, according to the judge.
