# States challenge 55 mph limit

Cheyenne, Wyo. (AP) — Encouraged by out
spoken Republican support for repeal of the 55
mph speed limit and the right of states to set
their own limits, legislators around the coun
try are filing bills to abolish the 6-year-old
"double nickel'' barrier.
Most of the states moving against the feder
ally mandated speed limit are in the West,
where wide open spaces make the limit "about
as popular as having mumps," according to
one Wyoming legislator.
Anti-55 sentiment has also surfaced in other
regions. States with repeal bills on file include
Connecticut, Indiana, Nebraska, Colorado,
New Mexico and Wyoming. Arizona legislators
plan to introduce such a bill before the sum
mer.
The GOP platform has a plank calling for re
peal of the 55 mph mandate. And Drew Lewis,
Ronald Reagan's choice for transportation
secretary, said in his confirmation hearings
last week, "I believe the states should set their
own speed limits."
Wyoming state Sen. Cal Taggart, who has
said that he was stopped "a couple of years
ago" and fined $48 for driving 102 mph, added,
"I think under the Reagan administration the
law will be repealed, and the states will be able
to set their own speed limits."
A 1 Lauersdorf of the National Safety Coun
cil's Traffic Department says his organization
considers the Wyoming bill "quite serious, be
cause if one state takes the plunge, others will

follow." The council estimates that through
last year, 40.000 lives have been saved because
of the lower speed limit.
Taggart's bill would increase the speed limit
to 65 mph except in posted areas and cities and
towns.
But the 55 mph limit is unquestionably un
popular in sparsely populated Western states,
where distances between towns range up to 50
miles or more and where public transportation
is limited at best.
When Congress imposed the 55 mph limit in
1975 — with the onus on the states to enforce it
or lose their federal highway funds — the rea
soning was that it would save fuel and save
lives. But a growing number of people say they
think it saves neither.
Steve Collins, a Republican legislator who
for the third straight year has proposed raising
Indiana's limit to 65, said he plans to show that
the number of highway fatalities is the same
per mile no matter what the speed.
While the Wyoming Highway Patrol still
preaches that speed and alcohol kill, some
state safety experts speculate the 55 mph limit
may actually be a danger in Wyoming's vast
spaces.
Highway statistics indicate the largest sin
gle cause of death in Wyoming is the single-ve
hicle rollover, usually at night when drivers
can be lulled to sleep by what highway safety
experts call the "monotony and fatigue" fac
tor.
