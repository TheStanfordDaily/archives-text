### Bill Beyda 
Led by All-Everything forward Mary Hile's
24 points, the USF Dons women's basketball
team defeated the Stanford Cardinals 70-54 at
USF Wednesday night.
'â€¢'We need five people playing to their poten
tial, and we didn't have that tonight," said
Stanford coach Dotty McCrea after the game,
in which nothing seemed to go right for the
Cardinals.
Stanford started the game with a full court
press, which helped them take an early lead,
but USF was not fooled for long. USF pulled
ahead 19-18 midway through the first half, then
sealed it with a string of 13 unanswered points.
Stanford was held scoreless for six minutes,
and the 32-18 margin proved insurmountable.
"Our shooting was just great," said USF
coach Jan Ternyik, commenting on the team's
amazing 76 percent field goal shooting during
the first half, compared to Stanford's more
down-to-earth 50 percent rate.
Hile, the 6-foot senior forward from Sun
nyvale, is ranked fourth in the nation in steals
with five per game and fourth nationally in re
bounding with 15.4 per game. Though the Cards
succeeded in holding her to only five rebounds,

they had no answer for her shooting. Said for
ward Leigh Pederson: "Hile didn't intimidate
us, she just did everything right."
Hile's 24 points gives her a total of 2 077
points, only 40 points short of USF's all-time
leading scorfer, Bill Cartwright, now playing
pro ball for the NBA's New York Knicks.
Louise Smith and Kim Kupferer led the
Cards' scoring with 16 and 11 points respective
ly. Each added nine rebounds.
"The six minutes we didn't score any points
really hurt us," Stanford guard Ann Miller
said. Pederson added, "We just turned the ball
over too many times."
One of the referees commented after the
game, "I can't believe this is the same Stan
ford team that played such a good game
against UCLA."
Stanford's record is now 10-9 overall, but
more importantly, dropped their NorCal Con
ference record 1-2. Two losses this early in the
league season put a real damper on the team's
chances for a berth in the AIAW regionals, to
be held in Pepperdine in March.
The Cards' play at UOP tomorrow night
before returning home to host Santa Clara
Wednesday night at 7:30.
