# Stanford heads for Fairyland
## 
### Chris Haft 
Los Angeles — In college
basketball's Fairyland, UCLA
is the knight in shining armor,
while USC is the mean, evil
beast.
It would be an excessive re
quest to ask Stanford, the little
gnome in this kingdom, to over
come these powerful beings.
Yet that is just what the
Cardinals will try to do, tonight
at UCLA and tomorrow evening
at USC.
The Bruins' shining armor
has received a few dents this
season, including a con
siderably big one in the form of
their 68-66 loss to USC two
weeks ago and a 78-74 loss in tri
ple overtime to Arizona State.
With a 3-2 record in the Pacif
ic-10 Conference, UCLA finds
itself in a third-place tie with
USC.
However, the Bruins have not
yet completely fallen from
grace, as their 9-3 overall re
cord and No. 12 national ranking
shows. Despite losing forwards
James Wilkes and Kiki Van
deweghe from last year's NCAA
second-place squad, UCLA re
mains a threat to challenge for
the conference championship
and again advance to the na
tional tournament.
The seven players head coach
Larry Brown relies on would be
welcome on any basketball
team — or, for that matter, any
track team. More than any oth
er year, quickness distinguishes
the Bruins.
Forward Mike Sanders (14.1
points per game) and guard An
thony Holton are among the
most consistent players in the
conference. Whenever they
need a rest, Cliff Pruitt and
Ralph Jackson ably replace
them. At 6-foot-7, freshman cen
ter Kenny Fields is undersized
for his position, but his 12.8 scor
ing average proves that his
problems have been minimal.
Darren Daye, a slender,
smooth sophomore, leads the
Bruins in scoring (14.4), though
the team is still propelled by
Rod Foster (13.3), who many
call the quickest player in
basketball — college or pro
fessional.
Stanford head coach Dick
Dißiaso knows how to stop the
Bruins, though executing the
tasks he outlines — limiting the
Bruins to one shot per
possession, protecting the ball
and stopping their fast break —
will be about as easy for the

Cards as performing the 12 feats
of Hercules.
Dißiaso particularly stressed
the ball-control aspect of the
Cards' strategy. "I would not
like to see us hit our first seven
shots after making only one pass
after crossing halfcourt," he
said. "Then we'd be playing
their game, and there would be
about 37 minutes left to play."
Then there are the beastly
Trojans, who don't possess quite
UCLA's speed but never
hesitate to wield around their
physical strength.
The measurements of
starters such as Purvis Miller
(6-foot-8, 230 lbs., but doubtful
because of a ankle injury),
Maurice Williams (6-foot-6, 200
lbs.) and James McDonald (6-
foot-6, 210 lbs.) may not sound
imposing, but seeing them in the
flesh at a game makes one
grateful that the scene is a
basketball arena and not a dark
alley. These guys are big and
thick.
USC. 3-2 in the conference and
8-6 overall, makes a habit out of
defeating the Cards by close
margins. Four of the last five
Trojan victories over Stanford
have been by two points or less.
The Cards prevailed the last
time they faced USC, 93-91, but
needed an overtime period to do
it.
Notes: At least the Cards lead
the league in something. Their
76.1 free-throw shooting per
centage ranks first in the con
ference and among the NCAA's
top 10 . . . Doug Marty's 87.5
percent figure tops the Cards.
At that pace, Marty would sur
pass Gerry Thuesen's mark of
86.8, set in 1957-58 . . . Brian
Welch, with 915 career points,
stands 18th on the all-time
Cardinal list. Welch's next
targets are Russ Lawler (949)
and Mike Bratz (983).

er year, quickness distinguishes
the Bruins.
Forward Mike Sanders (14.1
points per game) and guard An
thony Holton are among the
most consistent players in the
conference. Whenever they
need a rest, Cliff Pruitt and
Ralph Jackson ably replace
them. At 6-foot-7, freshman cen
ter Kenny Fields is undersized
for his position, but his 12.8 scor
ing average proves that his
problems have been minimal.
Darren Daye, a slender,
smooth sophomore, leads the
Bruins in scoring (14.4), though
the team is still propelled by
Rod Foster (13.3), who many
call the quickest player in
basketball — college or pro
fessional.
Stanford head coach Dick
Dißiaso knows how to stop the
Bruins, though executing the
tasks he outlines — limiting the
Bruins to one shot per
possession, protecting the ball
and stopping their fast break —
will be about as easy for the

Cards as performing the 12 feats
of Hercules.
Dißiaso particularly stressed
the ball-control aspect of the
Cards' strategy. "I would not
like to see us hit our first seven
shots after making only one pass
after crossing halfcourt," he
said. "Then we'd be playing
their game, and there would be
about 37 minutes left to play."
Then there are the beastly
Trojans, who don't possess quite
UCLA's speed but never
hesitate to wield around their
physical strength.
The measurements of
starters such as Purvis Miller
(6-foot-8, 230 lbs., but doubtful
because of a ankle injury),
Maurice Williams (6-foot-6, 200
lbs.) and James McDonald (6-
foot-6, 210 lbs.) may not sound
imposing, but seeing them in the
flesh at a game makes one
grateful that the scene is a
basketball arena and not a dark
alley. These guys are big and
thick.
USC. 3-2 in the conference and
8-6 overall, makes a habit out of
defeating the Cards by close
margins. Four of the last five
Trojan victories over Stanford
have been by two points or less.
The Cards prevailed the last
time they faced USC, 93-91, but
needed an overtime period to do
it.
Notes: At least the Cards lead
the league in something. Their
76.1 free-throw shooting per
centage ranks first in the con
ference and among the NCAA's
top 10 . . . Doug Marty's 87.5
percent figure tops the Cards.
At that pace, Marty would sur
pass Gerry Thuesen's mark of
86.8, set in 1957-58 . . . Brian
Welch, with 915 career points,
stands 18th on the all-time
Cardinal list. Welch's next
targets are Russ Lawler (949)
and Mike Bratz (983).
Los Angeles — In college
basketball's Fairyland, UCLA
is the knight in shining armor,
while USC is the mean, evil
beast.
It would be an excessive re
quest to ask Stanford, the little
gnome in this kingdom, to over
come these powerful beings.
Yet that is just what the
Cardinals will try to do, tonight
at UCLA and tomorrow evening
at USC.
The Bruins' shining armor
has received a few dents this
season, including a con
siderably big one in the form of
their 68-66 loss to USC two
weeks ago and a 78-74 loss in tri
ple overtime to Arizona State.
With a 3-2 record in the Pacif
ic-10 Conference, UCLA finds
itself in a third-place tie with
USC.
However, the Bruins have not
yet completely fallen from
grace, as their 9-3 overall re
cord and No. 12 national ranking
shows. Despite losing forwards
James Wilkes and Kiki Van
deweghe from last year's NCAA
second-place squad, UCLA re
mains a threat to challenge for
the conference championship
and again advance to the na
tional tournament.
The seven players head coach
Larry Brown relies on would be
welcome on any basketball
team — or, for that matter, any
track team. More than any oth
er year, quickness distinguishes
the Bruins.
