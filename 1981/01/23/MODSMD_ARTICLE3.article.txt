# Hostages tell of physical abuse by captors
## 
### Washington Post 
Wiesbaden, West Germany — New
accounts of bread-and-water diets,
strippings, beatings and forced
arbund-the-clock standing or sitting in
shackles emerged yesterday as the
freed American hostages continued to
tell government interviewers, doctors
and relatives of their treatment dur
ing their captivity in Iran.
One of the former hostages re
portedly was kept in solitary confine
ment for 374 of the 444 days he was
held. Others reportedly told of guards

spitting in the meager rations of food
before serving them, burning un
opened Christmas gifts and showing
them letters from home and refusing
to distribute them.
Even the U.S. embassy's charge'
d'affaires, L. Bruce Laingen, who was
in the custody of the Iranian Foreign
Ministry rather than militant stu
dents, reportedly said he had been
kept in a darkened prison room much
of the time and allowed to go to the
toilet only three times a day.
State Department spokesman Jack

Cannon told reporters here yesterday,
"The evidence now is mounting from
the discussions we are having and it
shows much worse and more ex
tensive mistreatment than that of
which we previously had evidence."
'Almost a miracle'
In Washington, a senior White
House official who met with the freed
hostages in West Germany said that,
considering their treatment at the
hands of the Iranian captors, it was
"almost a miracle that all seemed to
be in good condition physically."
Although Cannon refused to specify
individual cases, the broad picture he
presented paralleled and expanded on
the stories of mistreatment the
hostages' relatives have been passing
along to the press.
The information being compiled
from the freed hostages by psy
chiatrists and interviewers from
"various government agencies," ac
cording to Cannon, depicts:
— Poor food and primitive living con
ditions. "At least several persons
were on bread and water diets for at
least two weeks," Cannon said. "Oth
ers were forced to eat stale com
missary food, including wormed
powder milk" while their guards ate

meat and vegetables.
— Restrictions on movement. "Some
persons were manacled to single fold
ing chairs for as much as 14 to 15 days
around the clock," Cannon said, and
others "were forced to stand in cold
weather for long periods of time, in
cluding night, in poor clothing."
— Imprisonment and solitary confine
ment. Some hostages were kept in ac
tual prison cells. Cannon said, and oth
ers were kept in solitary confinement
for months "in cell-like conditions in
various other places."
Michael Metrinko, who was a politi
cal officer at the American Embassy
in Tehran, has said he spent nine
months in solitary confinement. Col.
Leland Holland, a military attache,
said he spent a month in a "dungeon,"
and charge d'affaires Laingen has
said he was kept in a dark room.
There have also been reports of ac
tual physical beatings. "There were a
number of cases of beatings on a
number of occasions" during the
Americans' 14 months of captivity,
Cannon said, but he did not provide de
tails.
Intimidation tactics were also util
ized. "A number of persons were on
several occasions threatened with
loaded revolvers," Cannon said. Oth
ers were ordered by terrorists with
loaded rifles "to strip off their
clothes, and lie on the floor and were
threatened with death. Many thought
they were going to be executed on a
number of different occasions."
Marine Sgt. William Gallegos
and Richard Queen, the hostage who
was released last year because of ill
health, have said they were put before
such mock firing squads. Another
hostage released earlier, Lloyd
Rawlins, said two embassy secretar
ies were forced to play Russian
roulette.
Besides the cases of solitary con
finement. most of the hostages were
segregated in small groups from the
other hostages, blindfolded when
moved from place to place and cut off
from the outside world most of the
time.
Communications withheld
Mail was denied them for long peri
ods and most of the letters they wrote
were never sent out of the country.
Economist Robert Blucher has said he
was taunted with letters postmarked
in his home town and addressed in his
mother's handwriting.
Most of the hostages were ordered
not to speak to each other, although
some communicated by whispering or
sending messages from room to room
or cell to cell in code by tapping on the
walls.
Some of the hostages, including
Gallegos, have said they were pun
ished with worse deprivation after the
abortive American military rescue at
tempt last summer. But Cannon said
most of the mistreatment seemed
more haphazard, except for pun
ishment for several escape attempts
by some of the hostages.
"Their treatment differed from
time to time, place to place and person
to person," Cannon said. Some "were
guarded by persons who obviously
were more severe in their treatment
of the hostages. Some were treated a
little better than others."

Cannon did not answer questions
about possible implications about the
reports for future relations with Iran
or the carrying out of the U.S.-Iranian
agreement that led to their release, in
stead referring the questioners to
Washington officials. He also brushed
aside questions about the truth of Ira
nian accusations that many of the
former hostages had been spies in
Tehran and questions of whether
many of their interrogators here are
from the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency.
Barry Rosen, the former press at
tache at the American embassy in
Tehran and one of the few former
hostages to make direct contact with
the press here, told reporters in a brief
conversation at the entrance to the
U.S. Air Force hospital that he
thought the hostage release agree
ment with Iran "should be looked at,
but that would take time.
"I feel Iran is an outlaw country,"
Rosen said, "and it deserves tremen
dous criticism from the world for its
treatment of the hostages."

ing chairs for as much as 14 to 15 days
around the clock," Cannon said, and
others "were forced to stand in cold
weather for long periods of time, in
cluding night, in poor clothing."
— Imprisonment and solitary confine
ment. Some hostages were kept in ac
tual prison cells. Cannon said, and oth
ers were kept in solitary confinement
for months "in cell-like conditions in
various other places."
Michael Metrinko, who was a politi
cal officer at the American Embassy
in Tehran, has said he spent nine
months in solitary confinement. Col.
Leland Holland, a military attache,
said he spent a month in a "dungeon,"
and charge d'affaires Laingen has
said he was kept in a dark room.
There have also been reports of ac
tual physical beatings. "There were a
number of cases of beatings on a
number of occasions" during the
Americans' 14 months of captivity,
Cannon said, but he did not provide de
tails.
Intimidation tactics were also util
ized. "A number of persons were on
several occasions threatened with
loaded revolvers," Cannon said. Oth
ers were ordered by terrorists with
loaded rifles "to strip off their
clothes, and lie on the floor and were
threatened with death. Many thought
they were going to be executed on a
number of different occasions."
Marine Sgt. William Gallegos
and Richard Queen, the hostage who
was released last year because of ill
health, have said they were put before
such mock firing squads. Another
hostage released earlier, Lloyd
Rawlins, said two embassy secretar
ies were forced to play Russian
roulette.
Besides the cases of solitary con
finement. most of the hostages were
segregated in small groups from the
other hostages, blindfolded when
moved from place to place and cut off
from the outside world most of the
time.
Communications withheld
Mail was denied them for long peri
ods and most of the letters they wrote
were never sent out of the country.
Economist Robert Blucher has said he
was taunted with letters postmarked
in his home town and addressed in his
mother's handwriting.
Most of the hostages were ordered
not to speak to each other, although
some communicated by whispering or
sending messages from room to room
or cell to cell in code by tapping on the
walls.
Some of the hostages, including
Gallegos, have said they were pun
ished with worse deprivation after the
abortive American military rescue at
tempt last summer. But Cannon said
most of the mistreatment seemed
more haphazard, except for pun
ishment for several escape attempts
by some of the hostages.
"Their treatment differed from
time to time, place to place and person
to person," Cannon said. Some "were
guarded by persons who obviously
were more severe in their treatment
of the hostages. Some were treated a
little better than others."

Cannon did not answer questions
about possible implications about the
reports for future relations with Iran
or the carrying out of the U.S.-Iranian
agreement that led to their release, in
stead referring the questioners to
Washington officials. He also brushed
aside questions about the truth of Ira
nian accusations that many of the
former hostages had been spies in
Tehran and questions of whether
many of their interrogators here are
from the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency.
Barry Rosen, the former press at
tache at the American embassy in
Tehran and one of the few former
hostages to make direct contact with
the press here, told reporters in a brief
conversation at the entrance to the
U.S. Air Force hospital that he
thought the hostage release agree
ment with Iran "should be looked at,
but that would take time.
"I feel Iran is an outlaw country,"
Rosen said, "and it deserves tremen
dous criticism from the world for its
treatment of the hostages."
Wiesbaden, West Germany — New
accounts of bread-and-water diets,
strippings, beatings and forced
arbund-the-clock standing or sitting in
shackles emerged yesterday as the
freed American hostages continued to
tell government interviewers, doctors
and relatives of their treatment dur
ing their captivity in Iran.
One of the former hostages re
portedly was kept in solitary confine
ment for 374 of the 444 days he was
held. Others reportedly told of guards

spitting in the meager rations of food
before serving them, burning un
opened Christmas gifts and showing
them letters from home and refusing
to distribute them.
Even the U.S. embassy's charge'
d'affaires, L. Bruce Laingen, who was
in the custody of the Iranian Foreign
Ministry rather than militant stu
dents, reportedly said he had been
kept in a darkened prison room much
of the time and allowed to go to the
toilet only three times a day.
State Department spokesman Jack

Cannon told reporters here yesterday,
"The evidence now is mounting from
the discussions we are having and it
shows much worse and more ex
tensive mistreatment than that of
which we previously had evidence."
'Almost a miracle'
In Washington, a senior White
House official who met with the freed
hostages in West Germany said that,
considering their treatment at the
hands of the Iranian captors, it was
"almost a miracle that all seemed to
be in good condition physically."
Although Cannon refused to specify
individual cases, the broad picture he
presented paralleled and expanded on
the stories of mistreatment the
hostages' relatives have been passing
along to the press.
The information being compiled
from the freed hostages by psy
chiatrists and interviewers from
"various government agencies," ac
cording to Cannon, depicts:
— Poor food and primitive living con
ditions. "At least several persons
were on bread and water diets for at
least two weeks," Cannon said. "Oth
ers were forced to eat stale com
missary food, including wormed
powder milk" while their guards ate

meat and vegetables.
— Restrictions on movement. "Some
persons were manacled to single fold
ing chairs for as much as 14 to 15 days
around the clock," Cannon said, and
others "were forced to stand in cold
