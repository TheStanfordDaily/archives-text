# Hostages tell of physical abuse by captors
## 
### Washington Post 
Wiesbaden, West Germany — New
accounts of bread-and-water diets,
strippings, beatings and forced
arbund-the-clock standing or sitting in
shackles emerged yesterday as the
freed American hostages continued to
tell government interviewers, doctors
and relatives of their treatment dur
ing their captivity in Iran.
One of the former hostages re
portedly was kept in solitary confine
ment for 374 of the 444 days he was
held. Others reportedly told of guards

spitting in the meager rations of food
before serving them, burning un
opened Christmas gifts and showing
them letters from home and refusing
to distribute them.
Even the U.S. embassy's charge'
d'affaires, L. Bruce Laingen, who was
in the custody of the Iranian Foreign
Ministry rather than militant stu
dents, reportedly said he had been
kept in a darkened prison room much
of the time and allowed to go to the
toilet only three times a day.
State Department spokesman Jack

Cannon told reporters here yesterday,
"The evidence now is mounting from
the discussions we are having and it
shows much worse and more ex
tensive mistreatment than that of
which we previously had evidence."
'Almost a miracle'
In Washington, a senior White
House official who met with the freed
hostages in West Germany said that,
considering their treatment at the
hands of the Iranian captors, it was
"almost a miracle that all seemed to
be in good condition physically."
Although Cannon refused to specify
individual cases, the broad picture he
presented paralleled and expanded on
the stories of mistreatment the
hostages' relatives have been passing
along to the press.
The information being compiled
from the freed hostages by psy
chiatrists and interviewers from
"various government agencies," ac
cording to Cannon, depicts:
— Poor food and primitive living con
ditions. "At least several persons
were on bread and water diets for at
least two weeks," Cannon said. "Oth
ers were forced to eat stale com
missary food, including wormed
powder milk" while their guards ate

meat and vegetables.
— Restrictions on movement. "Some
persons were manacled to single fold
ing chairs for as much as 14 to 15 days
around the clock," Cannon said, and
others "were forced to stand in cold
weather for long periods of time, in
cluding night, in poor clothing."
— Imprisonment and solitary confine
ment. Some hostages were kept in ac
tual prison cells. Cannon said, and oth
ers were kept in solitary confinement
for months "in cell-like conditions in
various other places."
Michael Metrinko, who was a politi
cal officer at the American Embassy
in Tehran, has said he spent nine
months in solitary confinement. Col.
Leland Holland, a military attache,
said he spent a month in a "dungeon,"
and charge d'affaires Laingen has
said he was kept in a dark room.
There have also been reports of ac
tual physical beatings. "There were a
number of cases of beatings on a
number of occasions" during the
Americans' 14 months of captivity,
Cannon said, but he did not provide de
tails.
Intimidation tactics were also util
ized. "A number of persons were on
