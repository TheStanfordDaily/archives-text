# Gymnasts host Spartans, Pomona

### Dean Eyre 
The women's gymnastics
team hosts Cal Poly-Pomona
and NorCal Conference rival
San Jose State tonight at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavillion. The
Cardinal-Spartan match-up is
the first league competition of
the season and renews a cross
county rivalry between the
squads.
. "We've never beaten San
Jose State in Maples." noted
Stanford coach Jackie Walker.
"San Jose used to dominate the
conference. They were the best
team my first two years here
and then we won the conference
my third year (last season). It
would be nice if Stanford could
dominate this year."
. Lyn Cross' Spartans rolled up

a 19-0 record in 1979 and topped
the NorCal members, which
also include Cal and Fresno
State. Stanford was edged out in
the regular season meeting that
year by a 125.45 to 124.90
margin. In the confrence cham
pionships, San Jose widened the
gap, outscoring the Cards 130.55
to 127.25.
Last year the two schools
switched roles with Stanford
compiling a perfect 12-0 mark in
dual meets, including a 136.25 to
126.20 victory over San Jose.
Walker's gymnasts went on to
win their first conference crown
and placed sixth in the WAIAW
Region 8 championships.
Judging from early season re
sults. Stanford has maintained
most of the momentum de

veloped last year. Despite being
battle-worn after facing highly
ranked Cal State-Fullerton,
USC and UCLA, the Cards
should "chalk up" a couple of
victories to improve upon their
1-3 record. "We should have no
trouble winning the meet, knock
on wood," Walker predicted.
Her team is motivated, "espe
cially after two hard losses and
beating Washington."
Tentative lineups include
Julie Bledsoe. Merilyn Chap
man. Jewanette Lacoste and
Caryn Lucido in all-around com
petition. Karen Hall and Anne
Smith, both trying to bring
ankles back up to full strength,
will probably enter the uneven
parallel bars and balance beam
events. Anne Friend, still re

covering from a knee injury suf
fered while vaulting in the home
opener, will not compete
After tonight's meet. Walker
will give the team Monday off
and, without a meet next week
end, the gymnasts should be
able to recuperate from linger
ing injuries.
"Looking back on the first
third of the season. I'm glad to
get it over. 'said Walker. "It's
not been a good first third and
we do have to get four good
scores to qualify for regionals
and nationals — i don't expect to
get them from those first three
meets.
"We need to get over our in
juries and finish strong. It's
almost like the first third was
preseason," she added.
