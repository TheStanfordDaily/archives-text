He is the eighth head coach in
the team's 14 years in the Na
tional Football League. Con
tract terms were not disclosed.
Phillips' hiring by the Saints
was not unexpected. Team

owner John Mecom Jr. said the
57-vear-old Phillips became his
leading candidate when he was
fired by Houston after the
American Football Conference
wild-card game, which the
Oilers lost to the Oakland
Raiders.
"We've kept this as good a se
cret as we did our game plans
for the 1-15 season," Mecom
joked.
Phillips said his first job
would be assessing the talent he
inherits from Dick Nolan, who
was fired with four games left in
the 1980 season.
"I've got a month of solid

work ahead of me just to find out
where we are," Phillips said.
He said he believes the Saints
have better talent than the
Oilers had when he took over
that team six years ago.
"I think — I know — they're a
whole lot better football team
than their record shows," he
said.
