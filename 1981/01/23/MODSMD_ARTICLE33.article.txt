## One vote for the Raiders 
### 
On the fifth Sunday of this NFL season, the
Oakland Raiders gave up 31 points in the first
half to the Kansas City Chiefs. The resulting
31-17 Raider setback was worse than bad — it
was galling.
Oakland had managed to get itself blown out
— at home — by a Kansas City team which up
to that point in the season had had no offense,
no victories and in fact, no business being on
the same turf with the Raiders.
To add injury to insult, Oakland's starting
quarterback Dan Pastorini had been banged
up in the first quarter of the game and was
probably through for the year with a broken
leg. His replacement, Jim Plunkett, had done
little to inspire confidence — rifling five passes
to Chief defenders and throwing 32 incomple
tions.
Oakland's record had slumped to a flimsy
2-3. The Bay Area vipors were dormant no
longer. "These days," Terence Moore of the
San Francisco Examiner wrote the following
morning, "the Raiders could lose to a group of
blind paraplegics."
For the Raiders, there was clearly but one
place to go — down. And down is where they've
gone. Down south to New Orleans, that is. This
Sunday (Channel 4, 3 p.m.) Oakland takes on
the Philadelphia Eagles in the Superdome for
the championship of pro football. As ridiculous
as it would've seemed to anyone present at that
Kansas City fiasco in early October, the
Raiders have made it to Super Bowl XV.
And the Raiders will win Super Bowl XV.
Not by much, but they will prevail. The
Raiders will win this game because they be
lieve they will win.
★They will win because Plunkett — once
frazzled and unsure — has become the big-play
guy again.
★They will win because their offensive line
is spraying people around the way it did four
years ago, when Oakland routed Minnesota
32-14 in Super Bowl XI.
★They will win because they have capable
runners (Mark van Eeghen and Kenny King),
fleet receivers (Raymond Chester, Bob
Chandler and Cliff Branch) and super-punter
Ray Guy.
★They will win because their punishing sec

ondary — featuring all-galaxy defensive back
Lester Hayes — is air-tight.
★They will win because their defensive line
is stopping the run, while their linebackers
(Hello, Ted Hendricks) are blitzing opposing
quarterbacks into analysis.
★They will win, finally, because no one
should be spared the sight of NFL Com
misioner Pete Rozelle having to hand over the
Super Bowl trophy to the man he most detests,
Oakland managing general partner Al Davis.
The culmination of their celebrated feud
(Rozelle has repeatedly blocked Davis' at
tempts to move the Raiders to Los Angeles,
while Davis — perhaps to get even — has in
timated the Commissioner's knowledge of var
ious ticket-scalping ventures) could make for
a most intriguing post-game show. And back to
you, Bryant. . . .
Nevertheless, all this talk about intriguing
post-game activity is selling the Eagles awful
ly short. Dick Vermeil's team runs the ball
well and defends it with vengeance. Two
months ago, the Eagles shut down Oakland's
rushing attack and almost chased Plunkett
into the Atlantic Ocean (sacking him eight
times) en route to a 10-7 decision.
Philly sports a wonderful running back
(Wilbert Montgomery), two terrific line
backers (Bill Bergey and Jerry Robinson), and
cannon-armed quarterback Ron Jaworski. The
Eagles won 10 of their first 11 games and have
demonstrated tremendous team spirit in ad
vancing to New Orleans.
Two weeks ago, Philadelphia waxed over
confident Dallas 20-7 in the NFC championship
ggme. If Oakland is complacent Sunday, the
Vince Lombardi Trophy will return to Pennsyl
vania, where, after the Steelers' recent suc
cesses, it no doubt owns a condominium.
Both the Raiders and the Eagles love to run
the ball, but it's doubtful either will have much
success doing so Sunday. The opposing de
fenses are just too tough.
This game, however, figures to be anything
but a rout. Both clubs are very, very proud and
they play that way. The key to Super Bowl XV
might be turnovers: here's a vote for Lester
Hayes. Here's a vote for Jim Plunkett. Here's
a vote for the Raiders, 20-16.
