## Char 'ming' cuisine A
						Cantonese institution on the Peninsula 
### 
Ming's
1700 Embarcadero Road East
Palo Alto
856-7700
Ming's has been serving Pe
ninsula residents for over 24
years and lays claim to being a
virtual institution here. With its
attractive surroundings,
courteous service and diverse
Cantonese menu, Ming's offers
the couple or small group an ex
cellent opportunity to sample
Chinese cuisine in an intimate
atmosphere.
One need not be a connoisseur
of Chinese cuisine or be adven
turous to enjoy what Ming's has
to offer, and Ming's is in many
ways especially ideal for the un
initiated to sample the diverse
Cantonese cuisine.
The clientele is predominant
ly non-Asian, and the menu
takes this into account. There
are few burning-hot dishes or in
gredients that are bewildering
ly unfamiliar. One should be
warned that a dinner may not be
strictly authentic or necessarily
representative of truly "classi
cal" Chinese" cuisine, although
many of the dishes do use tradi
tional ingredients, made ac
cording to the specifications of
traditional recipes.
Much of the charm lies in the
innovation and uniqueness of
many of its distinctive dishes.
Because of the wide range of
dishes listed on the menu, one
may select the common fare
found in many Chinese-Ameri
can restaurants (sweet and sour
pork, egg fu yong or chow
mein). Dishes more represent
ative of Canton province include
glutinous rice chicken, whole
112 ish-in-season, gold coin
chicken, minced squab, melon
cup soup and prawns in black
bean sauce.
Many non-traditional, non-
Chinese ingredients have been
adapted with interesting re
sults. For example, zucchini is
used in the zucchini-beef and
cream cheese in the crab

rangoon.
The exterior of the restaurant
is designed along the lines of
Chinese architecture. Graceful
trees add to the beautiful set
ting. Inside the entrance, the
large waiting room is filled with
artwork and large inlaid
teakwood chairs and benches.
For those whose interests lie
more with fine spirits, the
cocktail lounge is an ideal place
to enjoy a pre-dinner aperitif
while waiting for a table. In con
trast to the waiting area, the
dining rooms are simply deco
rated. Soft candlelight helps to
mute the effect of closely placed
tables and noisy conversation.
Unlike many Chinese restau
rants in which huge crowds and
entire clans surround massive
tables, Ming's seating is con
ducive to dining couples and
small groups.
Prices are higher than aver
age with appetizers ranging
from $4 for egg rolls, won ton or
barbecued pork to $5.50 for but
terfly prawns to $8 for the as
sorted appetizer plate. Most of
the appetizers consist of tasty
deep-fried tidbits of meat or
seafood or of bite-sized
barbecued meats. It was slight
ly' disappointing to note the
absence of some of our favorite
appetizers, including the Chi
nese appetizer cold cut plate.
The one salad listed on the
menu is a house specialty — the
chicken salad ($4.25). The varie
ty of light, mild soups range
from $2.75 for won ton to $6.50
for bird's nest or abalone.
Meat dishes range from $4.50
to $7 for poultry, $5 to $8.75 for
seafood and $4.50 to $6.75 for
beef, pork or lamb. Rice, noodle
and egg dishes are less ex
pensive. Special dishes such as
Peking duck ($l7) and whole
fish ($l2) must be ordered a day
in advance. Ming's also offers a
number of pre-planned dinners
for two of five to six courses
which range from $8.50 to $11
per person.

We decided to order the
"Ming" dinner in order to try as
many dishes as our two stom
achs could handle. The dinner
for two was priced at $11 per
person and consisted of an ap
petizer plate of crab rangoon,
barbecued beef, shrimp toast
and a fried vegetable combina
tion. This was followed by the
house chicken salad and four en
• trees: sweet and sour loquat
pork; crab, prawns and scallops
tse jup (in black bean sauce);
spiced lamb with scallions; and
Yang Chow fried rice.
The appetizer plate consisted
of tiny morsels to whet the ap
petite. The crab rangoon was an
interesting blend of shredded
crab, spices and cream cheese
wrapped in wonton dough and
deep-fried. It was an innovative
combination of two schools of
cooking.
The barbecued beef was thin
ly sliced, tender and not too sal
ty. A tiny tidbit of shrimp toast,
consisting of minced shrimp
with ginger, green onion, corn
starch and egg white spread on
toast and deep-fried, was not at
all greasy but slightly in need of
additional seasoning.
The fried vegetable combina
tion consisted of batter-fried
sweet potatoes and cauliflower,
crisp and light. Although all the
appetizers were made per
fectly, our spice-loving palates
looked forward to more in
tricate blends of flavors.
The menu seemed designed
with us in mind. The tossed
. shredded chicken salad was a
remarkable blend of flavors and
textures. With each bite, we dis
covered a new and exciting
flavor which we tried to identi
ty-
The four entrees were served
simultaneously by our accom
modating waiter. The loquat
pork consisted of cubes of pork
rolled in batter, fried 'til
crunchy and smothered in a
sweet and sour sauce of loquats,
green pepper, onion and pickled

Chinese cucumber.
The crab dish was cooked un
til just tender and covered with
a mild black bean sauce. The
spiced lamb with scallions was
also delicious.
The yang chow fried rice was
chock-full of all kinds of tidbits
of barbecued pork, bean
sprouts, shrimp, lettuce, peas
and eggs, each initially cooked
individually to the proper tex
ture and then combined with the
others.
Waiters were always avail
able and willing to answer ques
tions. Care was taken at each
step of the meal.
Unlike many Cantonese res
taurants, the dishes here do not
taste identical, blanketed in
non-descript sauces.

Although it is more ex
pensive, we suggest that you or
der a la carte to ensure that your
food is cooked to order. And for
a real adventure in Cantonese
cuisine, call in advance to order
some of Ming's special dishes.
