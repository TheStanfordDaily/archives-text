# Gourmet dining in a woodsy atmosphere

The Stagecoach
3062 Woodside Rd.

The food is elegant, yet the
surroundings are rustic and
unostentatious. At the
Stagecoach, the general air
is comfortable and woodsy.
The restaurant reflects its
Woodside location. Hanging
plants, dim lights, wine
racks and soft music provide
a peaceful setting for a relax
ing meal. Old stagecoach de
cor and horse memorabilia
also lend to the charming
countryside atmosphere.
And low-burning candles on
each wooden table add the
finishing touch.
Dinners, mainly steak and
seafood, are satisfying and
filling. They include fresh
vegetables, New England
clam chowder or salad bar
and bread and butter for
about $8.
The salad bar, which we
had eyed longingly on our
way in, was complete, large
and arranged beautifully. We
filled our chilled plates with
iceberg lettuce, bean
sprouts, potato salad, car
rots, garbanzo beans, onions,
pitted olives and grated

cheddar cheese.
We returned to our
stagecoach-like booth to en
joy this vegetable delight
along with warm sourdough
bread.
Our entrees, coquilles St.
Jacques and California
shortribs, were also pre
pared exquisitely and
thoughtfully. Owners Adrian
and Rita, who have operated
the Stagecoach for almost
five years, seem to pay close
attention to detail.
The coquilles St. Jacques
was a succulent blend of
scallops, shrimp and
mushrooms in a cheese and
white wine sauce. The dish
was garnished with parsley
and lemon.
The shortribs, cut to order
by Adrian, were found to be
meaty and tender. Both en
trees were served with light
ly cooked fresh vegetables
and rice.
The desserts proved to be
as scrumptiously fresh and
homemade as the other
courses. We chose the
banana cream pie and the
chocolate nut cheesecake.
Although we intended to
merely sample the pastries,
we left not a crumb of either

sinfully rich delicacy.
The house wine is In
glenook but a complete wine
list is available. Other
beverages range from Per
rier to apple juice to milk
shakes to Dos Equis. It is vir
tually impossible to leave the
Stagecoach hungry or
thirsty. We found the
gourmet meal a bargain at
$22 for two. Service was ex
cellent.
The restaurant also serves
breakfast, lunch and a week
end champagne brunch.
Breakfast choices range
from omelettes to pancakes
to Eggs Benedict. Lunch
selections include hot fish
and steak sandwiches,
enchiladas and tostadas and
imaginative hamburger
combinations.
The Stagecoach will be
adding several seafood en
trees, a chicken tostada and
a Half Moon Bay enchilada to
its menu.
Reservations are not nec
essary. Dinner is served
Monday through Saturday 5
p.m. to 10 p.m. and Sunday
4.30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.
We won't need any
"coaching" to return here.
