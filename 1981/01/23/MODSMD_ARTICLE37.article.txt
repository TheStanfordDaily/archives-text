# A 						ntique setting provides cozy oasis

### 
The Antique
2700 El Camlno Real
Palo Alto
857-1611
Situated right on El Camino near Page Mill,
The Antique would hardly seem to merit the
adjective "secluded." Inside, however, a com
fortable, cozy lounge and a booth-filled dining
room provide a real oasis from the outside
traffic.
Inside, one discovers the reason behind the
naming of the restaurant. Antiques are every
where, from the scale near the door to the
washtable in the women's room. These pieces
are well incorporated into the woody decor.
Tulip-shaped hanging lamps and other such
fixtures complete a very nice setting. The air
is one of informal intimacy.
Our first encounter with The Antique had
been during the (extremely) happy hours,
Monday through Friday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Drinks at $1, beer and wine at 50 cents and free
hors d'ouvres, including a moderate supply of
free pizza, add up to one of the better deals
around.
Wine specials are noted on the small
chalkboards inside every booth. The featured
wine is available by the glass in addition to by
the bottle.
The menu consists of an exceptional range of
food. Both those out for a snack or inexpensive
light meal and those interested in a complete
dinner can find something here.
Family style dinners include a tureen of
soup, salad and french bread. They range from
spaghetti and meatballs to New York steak
($5.45 to $10.95). But The Antique also features
salads, burgers, specialty sandwiches, quiche,
a cheeseboard and Chicago-style pizza.
This pizza is a definite change from both the
heavy, thick-crusted and the crisp, thin
crusted varieties usually served locally. It is
baked and served in a deep-dish skillet with a
thick but flaky crust. The cheese and meat go
on first, with the mildly spiced tomatoes on

top This pizza heresy results in a dish definite
ly worth trying
Basic cheese pizzas come in three sizes
($4 50, $6 and $7). An additional charge, depen
ding on the size, gives you the choice of any or
all of eight extra items. And for an extra $2 per
person, The Antique throws in soup and salad.
The soup and salad, even when only one per
son orders dinner, are served family-style
which means you may take your own seconds
and thirds.
Our other starter, the onion soup au gratin
($3 15). was excellent. It could easily serve for
a light meal in itself. The baked-on laver of
mozzarella cheese was thick and hot, and the
stock was well-seasoned. The accompanying
garlic bread also contained baked cheese. It
was different and quite tasty.
For salad lovers, entree-sized Cobb,
spinach, chef and Neptune salads are offered
for just over $5. We sampled the Neptune vari
ety. billed as seafood on a bed of lettuce. The
chef had selected shrimp that evening, and a
shell-shaped bowl held a good-sized portion of
bay shrimp The salad, attractively garnished
with lemon and tomato wedges, consisted of
far more shrimp than lettuce.
The veal parmigiano ($8.25) was a flavorful
dish from the dinner list. Real (not chopped
and formed) breaded veal, smothered with
cheese, arrived atop a plateful of spaghetti. It
was covered with a mildly spiced sauce. And it
was more than enough to eat after the soup and
salad.
The Antique serves a wide selection of after
dinner spiked ice cream and coffee drinks.
Irish coffee, cappuccino, Jamaican coffee and
Mexican coffee are a few of the house special
ties.
But we were too full to consider such things.
We did manage to try the Irish Mist coffee ($2),
which was delicious and poured with a gener
ous hand.

top This pizza heresy results in a dish definite
ly worth trying
Basic cheese pizzas come in three sizes
($4 50, $6 and $7). An additional charge, depen
ding on the size, gives you the choice of any or
all of eight extra items. And for an extra $2 per
person, The Antique throws in soup and salad.
The soup and salad, even when only one per
son orders dinner, are served family-style
which means you may take your own seconds
and thirds.
Our other starter, the onion soup au gratin
($3 15). was excellent. It could easily serve for
a light meal in itself. The baked-on laver of
mozzarella cheese was thick and hot, and the
stock was well-seasoned. The accompanying
garlic bread also contained baked cheese. It
was different and quite tasty.
For salad lovers, entree-sized Cobb,
spinach, chef and Neptune salads are offered
for just over $5. We sampled the Neptune vari
ety. billed as seafood on a bed of lettuce. The
chef had selected shrimp that evening, and a
shell-shaped bowl held a good-sized portion of
bay shrimp The salad, attractively garnished
with lemon and tomato wedges, consisted of
far more shrimp than lettuce.
The veal parmigiano ($8.25) was a flavorful
dish from the dinner list. Real (not chopped
and formed) breaded veal, smothered with
cheese, arrived atop a plateful of spaghetti. It
was covered with a mildly spiced sauce. And it
was more than enough to eat after the soup and
salad.
The Antique serves a wide selection of after
dinner spiked ice cream and coffee drinks.
Irish coffee, cappuccino, Jamaican coffee and
Mexican coffee are a few of the house special
ties.
But we were too full to consider such things.
We did manage to try the Irish Mist coffee ($2),
which was delicious and poured with a gener
ous hand.
