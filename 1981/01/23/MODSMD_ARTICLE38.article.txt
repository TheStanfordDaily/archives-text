Pear Williams
ISO Mlddlefield Road
Menlo Park
Although "why the name?" is
said to be the question asked
most frequently by first-time
diners at Pear Williams, after a
fine French meal in this Menlo
Park restaurant, any question
but "why haven't we eaten here
before?" quickly fades away.
The atmosphere is relaxed
and unhurried, characteristic of
country French restaurants. As
my companion suggested, it's
best to think of a dinner there as
a highlight rather than simply
the start to a great evening.
That way there's time to relax
over your wine or champagne
and hors d'oeurves or stay an
extra 20 minutes anticipating
the extra special Feuilletage
des Poires, a cooked-to-order
pastry filled with cream and
poached pears — one of Chef
Thomas McCombie's special
ties.
Our meal began with Pear
William's special Tuesday and
Wednesday evening feature — a
complimentary glass of cham
pagne and homemade potato
chips. Potato chips are potato
chips, but the best was yet to
come.
We selected our dinners from
a good-sized menu ranging in
price from $6.50 for Ramequin
Forestiere — "not quite a
quiche, not quite a souffle" — to
Tournedo saute au Madeira, a
filet steak served with
mushrooms flamed in Madeira
at $14.50.
After a delicious clear wa
tercress soud and a garden

salad with walnuts and a some
what bland house dressing, a
filet of sole and a steak arrived
at our table, accompanied by
side plates of rice, carrots and
brocolli.
The steak was a trifle tough,
perhaps due to the medium-well
order, but the sole was light and
tender in a saffron sauce. The
steak, too, benefitted from a de
licious sauce.
One dilemma happily re
solved was over the proper wine
to accompany a meat and a fish
dish. Our waitress conferred
with the chef, who is also the
wine buyer, and served us the
perfect solution: a very dry
Spanish champagne.

In fact Chef McCombie takes
a real interest in each of the res
taurant's patrons, as he is one of
seven part-owners. McCombie
studied in France under the
tutelage of Madame Simone
Beck, who has co-authored a
book on French cooking with
legend Julia Child. McCombie
nightly suggests a wine to ac
company his special of the eve
ning and publishes a monthly
newsletter called "Chef TJ's
Table Talk" which informs reg

ular Pear Williams' customers
about upcoming special dinners.
And just as we learned the an
swer to that oft-asked question
at the end of the meal, so I've
saved it for last, too.
It seems that while McCom
bie was in France, he was
served a dessert which featured
a poached pear on sherbert cov
ered with William Pear brandy.
When he opened his own restau
rant, McCombie explained, he
devised his own variation and it
became the special house des
sert — the Pear William. Hence,
the restaurant was named for
the dessert rather than the des
sert named for the restaurant.
I must admit, though, that we
got a bit more adventurous
when it came time for dessert. I
had the Meringue a la mocha
which, even if it was a bit sweet
after the steak, was delicious. It
featured a frozen baked mer
ingue on mocha ice cream with
a coffee cream sauce.
My dinner partner, mean
while, opted for the special
Feuilletage des Poires. After a
taste of that pastry, all I can
suggest is that you supply your
own favorite dessert cliche to
describe it — I think I'll just use
"it would melt in your mouth."
Pear Williams also offers
luncheon every day from 11:30
a.m. to 2 p.m. plus what looks
like a delightful Sunday brunch
featuring champagne for $6.50.
So the next time you're
prompted to ask, "why the
name?" instead ask "why did it
get such a good review?" Then
go see for yourself.
