The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari ,
★ ★★★
Tuesday, Haus Mitteleuropa
This 1919 horror film, with its
striking impressionist backdrops,
was an immense influence on Ger
man cinema up through the time
Hitler came into power Its story is
narrated by a madman, and the
strange, distorted sets and mean
dering, disturbing story reflect a
madman's view of a malevolent
world.
Werner Krauss plays the evil doc
tor, who is employed as a sideshow
hypnotist. Conrad Veidt is Cesare, a
man who lives in deathly sleep under
Caligari's control. Robert Wiene
directed.
— Jim Mattson
Dr. Strangelove
Saturday, Cubberley
The greatest comedy ever made
about the end of the world by nu
clear holocaust (it's even funnier
than Panic in the Year Zero, and
that's funny).
This is a saga of a nuclear war
started by a madman (Rip Torn)
and finished by high government
officials, most of whom are played
by Peter Sellers. We watch man
kind's hopes for survival being
sealed off, one by one; director
Stanley Kubrick wipes out the hu
man race with manic glee. Dr.
Strangelove is a wonderfully sus
tained exercise in misanthropy —
the threat of nuclear war is so
frightening that the only way to
deal with it is with derisive
laughter.

A Change of Season* *
Old Mill 6, Mt. View
Anthony Hopkins and Shirley
MacLaine star in a disappointing
story about an aging professor and
his fling with a student (Bo Derek)
half his age. MacLaine's per
formance as the professor's wife
was superb, but otherwise the film
offers only limited entertainment.
The social comments are impor
tant, but far too blatant in their
presentation. Hopkins stumbles
through the film as if he were to
tally confused. And Derek's only
redeeming qualities are her good
looks. In her role, she is super
ficial, insincere, even boring at
times. Unfortunately, the film is
much the same.
— Mike Charlson
American Gigolo *
Sunday, Mem Aud
Richard Gere lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer-di
rector Paul Schrader's so
fascinated by Gere's style that he
squeezes the life out it, makes it
dull. Schrader's voyeurism verges
on obsessiveness; he's so caught
up in capturing the image of his
subject's sterile naughtiness that
he doesn't have time to provide
any insight. The sexual kinkiness
here doesn't even begin to shock —
it's probably all "authentic," but
Schrader makes his audience feel
more like peeping toms than vital
participants.
Schrader's fascination with
Gere is comparable to a fire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty,
titillating sermon on sin, and this
finally completely gets the better
of him. In the movie's ludicrous,
amateurish ending, Gere is con
victed of a murder he probably
didn't commit; then, in a sudden
rush of images, Schrader lets him
off the hook.
— Ron Lillejord

Children of Paradiie
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Romanticism has acquired a
bad name in movies; it's been too
much associated with treacly
weepers that are more irritating
than moving. But Children of Par
adise, set in the world of the thea
ter in nineteenth-century France,
manages to achieve that rare
blend of sentiment, lushness, and
intelligence — it seduces the
viewer, beautifully.
Incredibly, it was made in the
midst of the Nazi occupation of
France; some of its performers
were sought by the Gestapo and
had to be concealed as filming took
place. Marcel Carne directed from
a script by the poet Jacques Pre
vert. Jean Louis Barrault stars as
a mime in love with a beautiful so
ciety woman, played by Arletty.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday.

Kagemusha ★★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
At 70, Akira Kurosawa directs
what may be his summit achieve
ment: a samurai epic that sug
gests a fusion of Shakespeare and
Pirandello. A thief is hired as the
shadow' of a samurai chieftain —
to stand in for him when he is in
jured in battle — and when the
leader dies, the thief must take
over. There's a post—battle se
quence that is reminsicent of the
'Guernica.' A masterpiece.

Old Mill, Mountain View
The script is slight — an uncer
tain pastiche of Preston Sturges
effects — but Jane Fonda, Lily
Tomlin and Dolly Parton make an
unexpectedly fine comic ensemble
in this tale of three secretaries
who declare war on their idiot
male boss. Fonda's a bit unsure of
herself, but she plays against type
to good result; Partoiris so natural
and unabashedly earnest that you
smile regardless of what she's
doing: and Tomlin shines through
out — her horsey face has soft
ened, giving her a multitude of dif
ferent expressions. Dabney Cole
man, as the tyrannical employer,
has the toughest part of all, but he
has a great time with it, playing
the unfailingly stupid jackass to
the hilt.

Raging Bull
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Raging Hull is a great piece of
moviemaking, and it is a pow
erhouse But on every level director
Martin Scorsese throws obstacles in
our path that keep us from becoming
involved with the film's characters.
Scorsese and star Robert De Niro
have done something very strange:
they have created a hero (based on
the life of famous middleweight
Jake La Motta) who does not re
spond on any level to our attempts to
locate him on the human scale: he is
impenetrable. Raging Hull is all
about passion, yet in some ultimate
and important way the passion nev
er reaches us, even when Jake's
blood spatters the spectators at the
last fight. As much as I admire this
film's technique, 1 have to confess I
don't like it very much.

From Russia ff ith Love
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The second Bond movie with
Sean Connery; though it had a
higher budget than the first, Dr.
No, its share of wit and excite
ment is decidedly"smaller. In this
one. Bond gets mixed up with a
beautiful lady Russian agent (I
know that's sexist — but this is a
Bond film) and nearly gets snuffed
by mean bitch Russian Lotte
Lenya. We all know who will end
up where; the only question is how
soon and with what method of vio
lence.
Plays through Wednesdav with
Dr. No.

Seems Like Old Times *
Old Mill, Mountain View
A movie only a schnauzer could
love. Goldie Hawn, Chevy Chase,
and Charles Grodin share the
screen with six dogs in assorted
sizes; the only really funny scene
comes when the dogs turn up their
noses at Hawn's pepperoni
chicken. Neil Simon's script com
bines a ludicrous storyline with
one-cjimensional characters:
Hawn has nothing to do but act
frazzled, while Grodin snivels and
Chase mugs. The "old times" that
Simon would like to evoke are the
screwball comedies of the '30s and
'40s, but Seems Like Old Times
only brings to mind the TV sitcoms
of the '70s

2001: A Space Odyssey
Old Mill. Mountain View
An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love Cosmic Mutation.
Stanley Kubrick's rewrite of the
Book of Revelation finds mankind
ready to make a great leap for
ward What we're leaping from is,
in Kubrick's vision, particularly
bleak. His characters are engulfed
in technology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendours of space, they
seem drained and vacant: they've
carried the work ethic out between
the planets. Here, space must turn
seductress — humankind meets its
greater fate only through the kind
ness of strangers.
With Keir Dullea, Gary
Lockwood and a computer named
Hal. Late show this weekend.

Dr. No ★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The first of the James Bond
movies at about one-tenth of the
cost of the latest, Moonraker. But
Sean Connery more than makes up
for any deficiencies in this slyly
well-made thriller In contrast to
the latest Bond movies, I)r. No can
at least claim to be witty. Like all
of the good Bond pictures, this
one's a helluva lot of fun.

The Blue Lagoon
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins star as the world's most
dim witted teenagers — marooned
all alone in a tropical paradise,
they take years to figure the finer
points that six-year olds in the au
dience grasp immediately. Direc
tor Randall Kleiser (Grease) has
seen to it that there's something
here to offend everyone. When the
two kids aren't acting out "natu
ral'' sex roles (he spears fishes,
she braids baskets) they're being
threatened by natives who look
like they've escaped from a '30s
jungle epic. A movie for dullards
and child molesters.
Plays Saturday only with Elec
tric Horseman.
- J.M.
Apocalypse Note ★★★★
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An amazing work of mad,
glorious, genius. Producer-direc
tor Francis Coppola s reworking
of Heart of Darkness employs Con
rad's essential narrative but not
his point of view. Aided by Vittorio
Storaro's superb cinematography,
Coppola creats stunning images of
Vietnam that combine frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality, and a powerful vision
of overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into an
almost literal hell that will en
gross — horribly fascinate —
some, and turn away others.
Apocalypse Now is, I think, the
best American movie of the '70s. It
has almost untenable ambitions,
but the profound questions it con
fronts you with justify the seeming
craziness of this "impossible,"
almost nihilistic vision of man
kind.
Plays tonight only, with
Aguirre, the Wrath of God.
-R.L.

Neil Diamond plays a man who
must face the choice of being a
cantor or being a bubblegumrock
star who gets to sing neat songs
like "Love On the Rocks. His
father, who is simultaneously a
cantor and Laurence Olivier, is up
set by all this, and also by
Diamond s choice of friends — a
woman who is simultaneously a

Haskell Wexler, who directed
the fascinating mock-documen
tary Medium Cool, photographed
this rock-documentary of the
MUSE (Musicians United for Safe
Energy) benefit which took place
in New York a year ago. He's
chosen to emphasize the per
formers' faces, often to
mesmerizing effect — we've never
been so close to these people
before. It's possible to question the
legitimacy of celebrities cam
paigning about such an issue
(would the movie have been made
any differently if the benefit had
been in support of nuclear energy
instead of against it?) but it's hard
not to get caught up with their en
thusiasm and concern.
Your opinion of the movie will
inevitably be affected by your
opinion of its people. They include
Bruce Springsteen and the E
Street Band. Jackson Browne, the
Doobie Brothers, and Gil Scott-
Herron. Late show this weekend.

The Great Santini ■*"*
Aquarius, Palo Alto
An interesting, often wonderful
movie run aground by an ending
that renders pointless everything
that's come before. Robert Duvall
plays a Marine colonel who ac
cuses his wife of mollycoddling his
sons. He abuses his family in what
he thinks is their best interests,
and risks alienating them all in the
process. So much, so good . . but
then those lousy last five minutes
go and screw everything up. You
might want to consider going out
for another tub of popcorn when it
becomes apparent that the mov
ie's drawing to a close.

Old Mill 6, Mt. View
Don't be fooled by the pathetic
ad campaign. This film is not an in
fantile piece of garbage. Gene Wil
der and Richard Pryor team up
again in a hilarious adventure, and
this one is even more entertaining
than Silver Streak. These two city
slickers wind up in a Southern
state prison replete with guards so
red-necked they must have been
bred in Montgomery. Their esca
pades are not the sort of thing to
win the big critical acclaim There
is no heavy social commentary;
there is no the big sex scene. It's
just two hours of fun. For any Wil

One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated. high-spirited blend of hu
mor and suspense that Hitchcock
was so gifted at creating. Robert
Donat stars as a man who inad
vertently becomes involved with a
group of spies; he must flee over
what seems to be nearly all of
Great Britain before he manages
to prove his innocence. Madeleine
Carroll is a woman he picks up on a
tram: she thinks he's a murderer,
and Donat s too busy to convince
her otherwise. It's only after the
two are handcuffed together, and
left to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.

The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari ,
★ ★★★
Tuesday, Haus Mitteleuropa
This 1919 horror film, with its
striking impressionist backdrops,
was an immense influence on Ger
man cinema up through the time
Hitler came into power Its story is
narrated by a madman, and the
strange, distorted sets and mean
dering, disturbing story reflect a
madman's view of a malevolent
world.
Werner Krauss plays the evil doc
tor, who is employed as a sideshow
hypnotist. Conrad Veidt is Cesare, a
man who lives in deathly sleep under
Caligari's control. Robert Wiene
directed.
— Jim Mattson
Dr. Strangelove
Saturday, Cubberley
The greatest comedy ever made
about the end of the world by nu
clear holocaust (it's even funnier
than Panic in the Year Zero, and
that's funny).
This is a saga of a nuclear war
started by a madman (Rip Torn)
and finished by high government
officials, most of whom are played
by Peter Sellers. We watch man
kind's hopes for survival being
sealed off, one by one; director
Stanley Kubrick wipes out the hu
man race with manic glee. Dr.
Strangelove is a wonderfully sus
tained exercise in misanthropy —
the threat of nuclear war is so
frightening that the only way to
deal with it is with derisive
laughter.

Anthony Hopkins and Shirley
MacLaine star in a disappointing
story about an aging professor and
his fling with a student (Bo Derek)
half his age. MacLaine's per
formance as the professor's wife
was superb, but otherwise the film
offers only limited entertainment.
The social comments are impor
tant, but far too blatant in their
presentation. Hopkins stumbles
through the film as if he were to
tally confused. And Derek's only
redeeming qualities are her good
looks. In her role, she is super
ficial, insincere, even boring at
times. Unfortunately, the film is
much the same.

American Gigolo *
Sunday, Mem Aud
Richard Gere lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer-di
rector Paul Schrader's so
fascinated by Gere's style that he
squeezes the life out it, makes it
dull. Schrader's voyeurism verges
on obsessiveness; he's so caught
up in capturing the image of his
subject's sterile naughtiness that
he doesn't have time to provide
any insight. The sexual kinkiness
here doesn't even begin to shock —
it's probably all "authentic," but
Schrader makes his audience feel
more like peeping toms than vital
participants.
Schrader's fascination with
Gere is comparable to a fire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty,
titillating sermon on sin, and this
finally completely gets the better
of him. In the movie's ludicrous,
amateurish ending, Gere is con
victed of a murder he probably
didn't commit; then, in a sudden
rush of images, Schrader lets him
off the hook.

Children of Paradiie
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Romanticism has acquired a
bad name in movies; it's been too
much associated with treacly
weepers that are more irritating
than moving. But Children of Par
adise, set in the world of the thea
ter in nineteenth-century France,
manages to achieve that rare
blend of sentiment, lushness, and
intelligence — it seduces the
viewer, beautifully.
Incredibly, it was made in the
midst of the Nazi occupation of
France; some of its performers
were sought by the Gestapo and
had to be concealed as filming took
place. Marcel Carne directed from
a script by the poet Jacques Pre
vert. Jean Louis Barrault stars as
a mime in love with a beautiful so

Raging Hull is a great piece of

Martin Scorsese throws obstacles in
our path that keep us from becoming
involved with the film's characters.
Scorsese and star Robert De Niro
have done something very strange:
they have created a hero (based on
the life of famous middleweight
Jake La Motta) who does not re
spond on any level to our attempts to
locate him on the human scale: he is
impenetrable. Raging Hull is all
about passion, yet in some ultimate

An amazing work of mad,

of Heart of Darkness employs Con

Storaro's superb cinematography,
Coppola creats stunning images of
Vietnam that combine frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality, and a powerful vision
of overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into an
almost literal hell that will en
gross — horribly fascinate —
some, and turn away others.
Apocalypse Now is, I think, the
best American movie of the '70s. It
has almost untenable ambitions,
but the profound questions it con
fronts you with justify the seeming
craziness of this "impossible,"
almost nihilistic vision of man
kind.

★ ★★★
Tuesday, Haus Mitteleuropa
This 1919 horror film, with its
striking impressionist backdrops,
was an immense influence on Ger
man cinema up through the time
Hitler came into power Its story is
narrated by a madman, and the
strange, distorted sets and mean
dering, disturbing story reflect a
madman's view of a malevolent
world.
Werner Krauss plays the evil doc
tor, who is employed as a sideshow
hypnotist. Conrad Veidt is Cesare, a
man who lives in deathly sleep under
Caligari's control. Robert Wiene
directed.
— Jim Mattson
Dr. Strangelove
Saturday, Cubberley
The greatest comedy ever made
about the end of the world by nu
clear holocaust (it's even funnier
than Panic in the Year Zero, and
that's funny).
This is a saga of a nuclear war
started by a madman (Rip Torn)
and finished by high government
officials, most of whom are played
by Peter Sellers. We watch man
kind's hopes for survival being
sealed off, one by one; director
Stanley Kubrick wipes out the hu
man race with manic glee. Dr.
Strangelove is a wonderfully sus
tained exercise in misanthropy —
the threat of nuclear war is so
frightening that the only way to
deal with it is with derisive
laughter.

Old Mill 6, Mt. View
Anthony Hopkins and Shirley
MacLaine star in a disappointing
story about an aging professor and
his fling with a student (Bo Derek)
half his age. MacLaine's per
formance as the professor's wife
was superb, but otherwise the film
offers only limited entertainment.
The social comments are impor
tant, but far too blatant in their
presentation. Hopkins stumbles
through the film as if he were to
tally confused. And Derek's only
redeeming qualities are her good
looks. In her role, she is super
ficial, insincere, even boring at
times. Unfortunately, the film is
much the same.

American Gigolo *
Sunday, Mem Aud
Richard Gere lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer-di
rector Paul Schrader's so
fascinated by Gere's style that he
squeezes the life out it, makes it
dull. Schrader's voyeurism verges
on obsessiveness; he's so caught
up in capturing the image of his
subject's sterile naughtiness that
he doesn't have time to provide
any insight. The sexual kinkiness
here doesn't even begin to shock —
it's probably all "authentic," but
Schrader makes his audience feel
more like peeping toms than vital
participants.
Schrader's fascination with
Gere is comparable to a fire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty,
titillating sermon on sin, and this
finally completely gets the better
of him. In the movie's ludicrous,
amateurish ending, Gere is con
victed of a murder he probably
didn't commit; then, in a sudden
rush of images, Schrader lets him
off the hook.

Children of Paradiie
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Romanticism has acquired a
bad name in movies; it's been too
much associated with treacly
weepers that are more irritating
than moving. But Children of Par
adise, set in the world of the thea
ter in nineteenth-century France,
manages to achieve that rare
blend of sentiment, lushness, and
intelligence — it seduces the
viewer, beautifully.
Incredibly, it was made in the
midst of the Nazi occupation of
France; some of its performers
were sought by the Gestapo and
had to be concealed as filming took
place. Marcel Carne directed from
a script by the poet Jacques Pre
vert. Jean Louis Barrault stars as
a mime in love with a beautiful so
ciety woman, played by Arletty.

The script is slight — an uncer

Tomlin and Dolly Parton make an
unexpectedly fine comic ensemble
in this tale of three secretaries
who declare war on their idiot
male boss. Fonda's a bit unsure of
herself, but she plays against type
to good result; Partoiris so natural
and unabashedly earnest that you
smile regardless of what she's
doing: and Tomlin shines through
out — her horsey face has soft

Raging Hull is a great piece of
moviemaking, and it is a pow
erhouse But on every level director
Martin Scorsese throws obstacles in
our path that keep us from becoming
involved with the film's characters.
Scorsese and star Robert De Niro
have done something very strange:
they have created a hero (based on
the life of famous middleweight
Jake La Motta) who does not re
spond on any level to our attempts to
locate him on the human scale: he is
impenetrable. Raging Hull is all
about passion, yet in some ultimate
and important way the passion nev
er reaches us, even when Jake's
blood spatters the spectators at the
last fight. As much as I admire this
film's technique, 1 have to confess I
don't like it very much.

comes when the dogs turn up their

Hawn has nothing to do but act

Apocalypse Note ★★★★
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An amazing work of mad,
glorious, genius. Producer-direc
tor Francis Coppola s reworking
of Heart of Darkness employs Con
rad's essential narrative but not
his point of view. Aided by Vittorio
Storaro's superb cinematography,
Coppola creats stunning images of
Vietnam that combine frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality, and a powerful vision
of overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into an
almost literal hell that will en
gross — horribly fascinate —
some, and turn away others.
Apocalypse Now is, I think, the
best American movie of the '70s. It
has almost untenable ambitions,
but the profound questions it con
fronts you with justify the seeming
craziness of this "impossible,"
almost nihilistic vision of man
kind.
Plays tonight only, with

Carroll is a woman he picks up on a

This 1919 horror film, with its
striking impressionist backdrops,
was an immense influence on Ger
man cinema up through the time
Hitler came into power Its story is
narrated by a madman, and the
strange, distorted sets and mean
dering, disturbing story reflect a
madman's view of a malevolent
world.
Werner Krauss plays the evil doc
tor, who is employed as a sideshow
hypnotist. Conrad Veidt is Cesare, a
man who lives in deathly sleep under
Caligari's control. Robert Wiene
directed.
— Jim Mattson
Dr. Strangelove
Saturday, Cubberley
The greatest comedy ever made
about the end of the world by nu
clear holocaust (it's even funnier
than Panic in the Year Zero, and
that's funny).
This is a saga of a nuclear war
started by a madman (Rip Torn)
and finished by high government
officials, most of whom are played
by Peter Sellers. We watch man
kind's hopes for survival being
sealed off, one by one; director
Stanley Kubrick wipes out the hu
man race with manic glee. Dr.
Strangelove is a wonderfully sus
tained exercise in misanthropy —
the threat of nuclear war is so
frightening that the only way to
deal with it is with derisive
laughter.

Anthony Hopkins and Shirley
MacLaine star in a disappointing
story about an aging professor and
his fling with a student (Bo Derek)
half his age. MacLaine's per
formance as the professor's wife
was superb, but otherwise the film
offers only limited entertainment.
The social comments are impor
tant, but far too blatant in their
presentation. Hopkins stumbles
through the film as if he were to
tally confused. And Derek's only
redeeming qualities are her good
looks. In her role, she is super
ficial, insincere, even boring at
times. Unfortunately, the film is
much the same.

Sunday, Mem Aud
Richard Gere lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer-di
rector Paul Schrader's so
fascinated by Gere's style that he
squeezes the life out it, makes it
dull. Schrader's voyeurism verges
on obsessiveness; he's so caught
up in capturing the image of his
subject's sterile naughtiness that
he doesn't have time to provide
any insight. The sexual kinkiness
here doesn't even begin to shock —
it's probably all "authentic," but
Schrader makes his audience feel
more like peeping toms than vital
participants.
Schrader's fascination with
Gere is comparable to a fire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty,
titillating sermon on sin, and this
finally completely gets the better
of him. In the movie's ludicrous,
amateurish ending, Gere is con
victed of a murder he probably
didn't commit; then, in a sudden
rush of images, Schrader lets him
off the hook.

Children of Paradiie
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Romanticism has acquired a
bad name in movies; it's been too
much associated with treacly
weepers that are more irritating
than moving. But Children of Par
adise, set in the world of the thea
ter in nineteenth-century France,
manages to achieve that rare
blend of sentiment, lushness, and
intelligence — it seduces the
viewer, beautifully.
Incredibly, it was made in the
midst of the Nazi occupation of
France; some of its performers
were sought by the Gestapo and
had to be concealed as filming took
place. Marcel Carne directed from
a script by the poet Jacques Pre
vert. Jean Louis Barrault stars as
a mime in love with a beautiful so
ciety woman, played by Arletty.

The script is slight — an uncer

Tomlin and Dolly Parton make an
unexpectedly fine comic ensemble
in this tale of three secretaries
who declare war on their idiot
male boss. Fonda's a bit unsure of
herself, but she plays against type
to good result; Partoiris so natural
and unabashedly earnest that you
smile regardless of what she's
doing: and Tomlin shines through
out — her horsey face has soft

Raging Hull is a great piece of
moviemaking, and it is a pow
erhouse But on every level director
Martin Scorsese throws obstacles in
our path that keep us from becoming
involved with the film's characters.
Scorsese and star Robert De Niro
have done something very strange:
they have created a hero (based on
the life of famous middleweight
Jake La Motta) who does not re
spond on any level to our attempts to
locate him on the human scale: he is
impenetrable. Raging Hull is all
about passion, yet in some ultimate
and important way the passion nev
er reaches us, even when Jake's
blood spatters the spectators at the
last fight. As much as I admire this
film's technique, 1 have to confess I
don't like it very much.

comes when the dogs turn up their

bines a ludicrous storyline with

Hawn has nothing to do but act

Apocalypse Note ★★★★
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An amazing work of mad,
glorious, genius. Producer-direc

of Heart of Darkness employs Con
rad's essential narrative but not
his point of view. Aided by Vittorio
Storaro's superb cinematography,
Coppola creats stunning images of
Vietnam that combine frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality, and a powerful vision
of overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into an
almost literal hell that will en
gross — horribly fascinate —
some, and turn away others.
Apocalypse Now is, I think, the
best American movie of the '70s. It
has almost untenable ambitions,
but the profound questions it con
fronts you with justify the seeming
craziness of this "impossible,"
almost nihilistic vision of man
kind.
Plays tonight only, with

Carroll is a woman he picks up on a

Dr. Strangelove
Saturday, Cubberley
The greatest comedy ever made
about the end of the world by nu
clear holocaust (it's even funnier
than Panic in the Year Zero, and
that's funny).
This is a saga of a nuclear war
started by a madman (Rip Torn)
and finished by high government
officials, most of whom are played
by Peter Sellers. We watch man
kind's hopes for survival being
sealed off, one by one; director
Stanley Kubrick wipes out the hu
man race with manic glee. Dr.
Strangelove is a wonderfully sus
tained exercise in misanthropy —
the threat of nuclear war is so
frightening that the only way to
deal with it is with derisive
laughter.

A Change of Season* *
Old Mill 6, Mt. View
Anthony Hopkins and Shirley
MacLaine star in a disappointing
story about an aging professor and
his fling with a student (Bo Derek)
half his age. MacLaine's per
formance as the professor's wife
was superb, but otherwise the film
offers only limited entertainment.
The social comments are impor
tant, but far too blatant in their
presentation. Hopkins stumbles
through the film as if he were to
tally confused. And Derek's only
redeeming qualities are her good
looks. In her role, she is super
ficial, insincere, even boring at
times. Unfortunately, the film is
much the same.
— Mike Charlson
American Gigolo *
Sunday, Mem Aud
Richard Gere lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer-di
rector Paul Schrader's so
fascinated by Gere's style that he
squeezes the life out it, makes it
dull. Schrader's voyeurism verges
on obsessiveness; he's so caught
up in capturing the image of his
subject's sterile naughtiness that
he doesn't have time to provide
any insight. The sexual kinkiness
here doesn't even begin to shock —
it's probably all "authentic," but
Schrader makes his audience feel
more like peeping toms than vital
participants.
Schrader's fascination with
Gere is comparable to a fire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty,
titillating sermon on sin, and this
finally completely gets the better
of him. In the movie's ludicrous,
amateurish ending, Gere is con
victed of a murder he probably
didn't commit; then, in a sudden
rush of images, Schrader lets him
off the hook.

Children of Paradiie
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Romanticism has acquired a
bad name in movies; it's been too
much associated with treacly
weepers that are more irritating
than moving. But Children of Par
adise, set in the world of the thea
ter in nineteenth-century France,
manages to achieve that rare
blend of sentiment, lushness, and
intelligence — it seduces the
viewer, beautifully.
Incredibly, it was made in the
midst of the Nazi occupation of
France; some of its performers
were sought by the Gestapo and
had to be concealed as filming took
place. Marcel Carne directed from
a script by the poet Jacques Pre
vert. Jean Louis Barrault stars as
a mime in love with a beautiful so
ciety woman, played by Arletty.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday.

Kagemusha ★★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
At 70, Akira Kurosawa directs
what may be his summit achieve
ment: a samurai epic that sug
gests a fusion of Shakespeare and
Pirandello. A thief is hired as the
shadow' of a samurai chieftain —
to stand in for him when he is in
jured in battle — and when the
leader dies, the thief must take
over. There's a post—battle se
quence that is reminsicent of the
'Guernica.' A masterpiece.
— Steve Vineberg
9 to 5 *★*
Old Mill, Mountain View
The script is slight — an uncer
tain pastiche of Preston Sturges
effects — but Jane Fonda, Lily
Tomlin and Dolly Parton make an
unexpectedly fine comic ensemble
in this tale of three secretaries
who declare war on their idiot
male boss. Fonda's a bit unsure of
herself, but she plays against type
to good result; Partoiris so natural
and unabashedly earnest that you
smile regardless of what she's
doing: and Tomlin shines through
out — her horsey face has soft
ened, giving her a multitude of dif
ferent expressions. Dabney Cole
man, as the tyrannical employer,
has the toughest part of all, but he
has a great time with it, playing
the unfailingly stupid jackass to
the hilt.

Raging Bull
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Raging Hull is a great piece of
moviemaking, and it is a pow
erhouse But on every level director
Martin Scorsese throws obstacles in
our path that keep us from becoming
involved with the film's characters.
Scorsese and star Robert De Niro
have done something very strange:
they have created a hero (based on
the life of famous middleweight
Jake La Motta) who does not re
spond on any level to our attempts to
locate him on the human scale: he is
impenetrable. Raging Hull is all
about passion, yet in some ultimate
and important way the passion nev
er reaches us, even when Jake's
blood spatters the spectators at the
last fight. As much as I admire this
film's technique, 1 have to confess I
don't like it very much.

From Russia ff ith Love
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The second Bond movie with
Sean Connery; though it had a
higher budget than the first, Dr.
No, its share of wit and excite
ment is decidedly"smaller. In this
one. Bond gets mixed up with a
beautiful lady Russian agent (I
know that's sexist — but this is a
Bond film) and nearly gets snuffed
by mean bitch Russian Lotte
Lenya. We all know who will end
up where; the only question is how
soon and with what method of vio
lence.
Plays through Wednesdav with
Dr. No.

Seems Like Old Times *
Old Mill, Mountain View
A movie only a schnauzer could
love. Goldie Hawn, Chevy Chase,
and Charles Grodin share the
screen with six dogs in assorted
sizes; the only really funny scene
comes when the dogs turn up their
noses at Hawn's pepperoni
chicken. Neil Simon's script com
bines a ludicrous storyline with
one-cjimensional characters:
Hawn has nothing to do but act
frazzled, while Grodin snivels and
Chase mugs. The "old times" that
Simon would like to evoke are the
screwball comedies of the '30s and
'40s, but Seems Like Old Times
only brings to mind the TV sitcoms
of the '70s

2001: A Space Odyssey
Old Mill. Mountain View
An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love Cosmic Mutation.
Stanley Kubrick's rewrite of the
Book of Revelation finds mankind
ready to make a great leap for
ward What we're leaping from is,
in Kubrick's vision, particularly
bleak. His characters are engulfed
in technology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendours of space, they
seem drained and vacant: they've
carried the work ethic out between
the planets. Here, space must turn
seductress — humankind meets its
greater fate only through the kind
ness of strangers.
With Keir Dullea, Gary
Lockwood and a computer named
Hal. Late show this weekend.

Dr. No ★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The first of the James Bond
movies at about one-tenth of the
cost of the latest, Moonraker. But
Sean Connery more than makes up
for any deficiencies in this slyly
well-made thriller In contrast to
the latest Bond movies, I)r. No can
at least claim to be witty. Like all
of the good Bond pictures, this
one's a helluva lot of fun.

The Blue Lagoon
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins star as the world's most
dim witted teenagers — marooned
all alone in a tropical paradise,
they take years to figure the finer
points that six-year olds in the au
dience grasp immediately. Direc
tor Randall Kleiser (Grease) has
seen to it that there's something
here to offend everyone. When the
two kids aren't acting out "natu
ral'' sex roles (he spears fishes,
she braids baskets) they're being
threatened by natives who look
like they've escaped from a '30s
jungle epic. A movie for dullards
and child molesters.
Plays Saturday only with Elec
tric Horseman.
- J.M.
Apocalypse Note ★★★★
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An amazing work of mad,
glorious, genius. Producer-direc
tor Francis Coppola s reworking
of Heart of Darkness employs Con
rad's essential narrative but not
his point of view. Aided by Vittorio
Storaro's superb cinematography,
Coppola creats stunning images of
Vietnam that combine frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality, and a powerful vision
of overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into an
almost literal hell that will en
gross — horribly fascinate —
some, and turn away others.
Apocalypse Now is, I think, the
best American movie of the '70s. It
has almost untenable ambitions,
but the profound questions it con
fronts you with justify the seeming
craziness of this "impossible,"
almost nihilistic vision of man
kind.
Plays tonight only, with
Aguirre, the Wrath of God.
-R.L.

The JaiM Singer
Old Mill, Mountain View
Neil Diamond plays a man who
must face the choice of being a
cantor or being a bubblegumrock
star who gets to sing neat songs
like "Love On the Rocks. His
father, who is simultaneously a
cantor and Laurence Olivier, is up
set by all this, and also by
Diamond s choice of friends — a
woman who is simultaneously a
shiksa and Lucie Arnaz. At the
end. Diamond, Olivier. Arnaz, and
three-hundred throbbing violins
patch everything up and all's well
on earth Now you don't have to
see the movie — aren't you glad?

No Nukes ★ ♦★Mi
Old Mill. Palo Alto
Haskell Wexler, who directed
the fascinating mock-documen
tary Medium Cool, photographed
this rock-documentary of the
MUSE (Musicians United for Safe
Energy) benefit which took place
in New York a year ago. He's
chosen to emphasize the per
formers' faces, often to
mesmerizing effect — we've never
been so close to these people
before. It's possible to question the
legitimacy of celebrities cam
paigning about such an issue
(would the movie have been made
any differently if the benefit had
been in support of nuclear energy
instead of against it?) but it's hard
not to get caught up with their en
thusiasm and concern.
Your opinion of the movie will
inevitably be affected by your
opinion of its people. They include
Bruce Springsteen and the E
Street Band. Jackson Browne, the
Doobie Brothers, and Gil Scott-
Herron. Late show this weekend.

The Great Santini ■*"*
Aquarius, Palo Alto
An interesting, often wonderful
movie run aground by an ending
that renders pointless everything
that's come before. Robert Duvall
plays a Marine colonel who ac
cuses his wife of mollycoddling his
sons. He abuses his family in what
he thinks is their best interests,
and risks alienating them all in the
process. So much, so good . . but
then those lousy last five minutes
go and screw everything up. You
might want to consider going out
for another tub of popcorn when it
becomes apparent that the mov
ie's drawing to a close.
— Bob Dawson
Stir Crazy
Old Mill 6, Mt. View
Don't be fooled by the pathetic
ad campaign. This film is not an in
fantile piece of garbage. Gene Wil
der and Richard Pryor team up
again in a hilarious adventure, and
this one is even more entertaining
than Silver Streak. These two city
slickers wind up in a Southern
state prison replete with guards so
red-necked they must have been
bred in Montgomery. Their esca
pades are not the sort of thing to
win the big critical acclaim There
is no heavy social commentary;
there is no the big sex scene. It's
just two hours of fun. For any Wil
der fan, this film is a must. He is
truly at his best.

An enormous hit for Alfred
Hitchcock when it was released in
1934, The Man Who Knew Too
Much is still wonderfully enter
taining A child is kidnapped after
her parents accidentally find out
that a group of spies are planning
to assassinate a diplomat; if the
couple moves to save the
diplomat's life, their daughter will
be killed. The parents set out to re
trieve the girl and encounter some
strange characters along the way,
including Peter Lorre The film's
best scene, beautifully edited for
suspense, is in London's Albert
Hall, where the diplomat is attend
ing a concert unaware that the as
sassin will shoot when cymbals
are clashed. Leslie Banks and
Edna Best play the parents; Peter
Lorre. wearing a nasty-looking
scar, plays the heavy.

One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated. high-spirited blend of hu
mor and suspense that Hitchcock
was so gifted at creating. Robert
Donat stars as a man who inad
vertently becomes involved with a
group of spies; he must flee over
what seems to be nearly all of
Great Britain before he manages
to prove his innocence. Madeleine
Carroll is a woman he picks up on a
tram: she thinks he's a murderer,
and Donat s too busy to convince
her otherwise. It's only after the
two are handcuffed together, and
left to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.
