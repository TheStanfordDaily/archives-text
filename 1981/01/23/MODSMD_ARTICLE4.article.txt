# Investigative reporter encourages skepticism
## 
### Clay Moltz 
"I think objective journalism is re
ally a myth," award-winning news
paperman David Burnham said last
night before a group of 30 at Florence
Moore Hall.
Burnham told his audience to be
skeptical of news reporting. "What is
news is often what a statesman says,
not what's going on."
Burnham is a guest lecturer this
quarter in the Communications Dept.
Burnham's investigative reporting
into police and judicial corruption in
New York City and about the nuclear
energy industry won him acclaim in
his former post with the New York
Times. Burnham was an important
figure in exposing the famous
"Serpico" police case in New York.
In his talk at the Paloma lounge,
Burnham spoke about "Journalism
and the Truth." He explained that
there are problems implicit in trust
ing what is reported: "The news
papers aren't truth, and television is
even worse. You've got to keep think
ing, what's the angle?"
Hiding the truth
The reason for this, he said, is not
necessarily poor reporting, but in
stead that public figures tend to hide
the truth in what they say. "What you
write may be accurate, but it's not the
truth."
Burnham has worked for United
Press International, Newsweek and
CBS, spending 13 years with the New
York Times before leaving the paper
last May. "It's exhausting" he says of
news reporting, "especially if you're
pushing a view. "
Burnham's presentation was in
formal, with him primarily address

ing students' questions. On the issue of
the question of the place of ethics in
journalism, Burnham said he operates
on an "intuitive standard," and tries
to gain a "substantive knowledge" of
the facts in the story.
He said his purpose in reporting was
to find out "what stopped whatever in
stitution I was looking at from achiev
ing its stated goal." "There was a lot
of pressure on me not to do that," he
said, especially when people with "po
litical clout" were involved. He men
tioned that he often received death
threats while pursuing investigative
stories.
Figures misleading
Official figures are often manipu
lated in police and government press
releases, Burnham said. This is a
problem he said because "Papers are
mostly stenography." He explained
that at bottom, "The primary drive of
newspapers is to make money."
Burnham told of'a news report that
came out about a Bronx district at
torney who, according to figures, had
a high rate of convictions. But, in fact,
it was found out that he was throwing
out all the weaker cases.
Thus, Burnham said he believes
"the more news you have, the better
the government."
Since leaving the Times, Burnham
has begun research on a book concern
ing the National Security Agency, a
largely-secret defense agency within
the U.S. government.
'Not enough Investigating'
Burnham said most reporters do not
do enough investigating As an exam
ple, he cited reporting of "scientific
progress."
"Did you ever hear of a scientific
mess-up: that happens a lot, but have
you ever read about it?" he asked.
However, Burnham added that
there are many capable reporters:
"People who are willing to argue and
fight."
In sum, Burnham stressed the need
to be skeptical, but not cynical, about
news reporting.
The Paloma lecture was the first in
a series of lecture/discussions that
Burnham will be conducting in dif
ferent lounges in the Flo Mo cluster
where he is in residence this quarter.
Burpham is also teaching a course
offered by the Communications De
partment called "Ethics in Journal
ism."

out all the weaker cases.
Thus, Burnham said he believes
"the more news you have, the better
the government."
Since leaving the Times, Burnham
has begun research on a book concern
ing the National Security Agency, a
largely-secret defense agency within
the U.S. government.
'Not enough Investigating'
Burnham said most reporters do not
do enough investigating As an exam
ple, he cited reporting of "scientific
progress."
"Did you ever hear of a scientific
mess-up: that happens a lot, but have
you ever read about it?" he asked.
However, Burnham added that
there are many capable reporters:
"People who are willing to argue and
fight."
In sum, Burnham stressed the need
to be skeptical, but not cynical, about
news reporting.
The Paloma lecture was the first in
a series of lecture/discussions that
Burnham will be conducting in dif
ferent lounges in the Flo Mo cluster
where he is in residence this quarter.
Burpham is also teaching a course
offered by the Communications De
partment called "Ethics in Journal
ism."
