Polish police block farmers
Warsaw, Poland — Polish police blocked off a
demonstration by angry farmers in a rural area yes
terday and members of the independent trade union
Solidarity shut more than 800 factories in the Baltic
seaport of Gdansk and other cities.
The protests were followed by reports of more
strikes planned for today in Warsaw, the Walbrzych
area in southwest Poland, Grudziadz in the
northwest and elsewhere.
A Solidarity spokesman said the farmers, who
have been pressing for their own independent union
for the past three months, planned a protest rally in
downtown Bydgoszcz where many shops closed and
streetcars and buses were reported halted for two
hours.
In Inowroclaw, 35 miles to the south, another 200
farmers held a rally without incident, the spokes
man said:
A Solidarity spokesman said that in at least a
dozen cities, workers shut hundreds of factories to
press demands for a five-day, 40-hour workweek, un
ion access to the media and revised labor and
censorship laws. The official Polish news agency
PAP, however, reported strikes in only five cities.
Defense Secretary to rearm US
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger said in his first message to the troops yester
day that his mission is "to rearm America."
"As I take office as our 15th secretary of de
fense." Weinberger said in a message to the 3 mil
lion military and civilian people attached to the De
fense Department, "I am very much aware of the
need to add greatly to America's military
strength."
The first solid indication of how he intends to do
this will come in the way he handles the fiscal 1981
and 1982 defense budgets inherited from the Carter
administration.
Weinberger's options are to let the Carter budget
stand pretty much as is, change it only slightly or at
tempt a complete overhaul. Edwin Meese, Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's counselor, said last week that
the new administration might be able to live with the
fiscal 1981 defense budget it inherited.
Carter's fiscal 1982 defense budget calls for big in
creases to make military forces readier to fight, an
emphasis Weinberger endorsed at his confirmation
hearing and in his first message yesterday. He
pledged as well yesterday "to begin now to restore
our strategic balance."
Most of cabinet confirmed
Washington — The Senate moved rapidly yester
day toward confirming the rest of President Ronald
Reagan's Cabinet, including the controversial nomi
nation of James Watt to head the Interior Depart
ment,
In votes late yesterday afternoon, the Senate ap
proved the appointments of Reagan's attorney gen
eral and his secretaries of agriculture, commerce,
housing and urban development, and transportation.
There was little opposition to most of yesterday's
approval votes, clearing the way for debate on Watt,
who was opposed by environmentalists beoause of
his past opposition to Interior Department con
servation policies.
Reagan's labor secretary-designate, Raymond

Donovan, was the only nominee not on the Senate
calendar. Several Cabinet members were approved
earlier in the week.
The Senate Labor Committee has delayed a vote
on Donovan's appointment pending FBI investiga
tion of claims that Donovan's New Jersey construc
tion firm made illegal payoffs to ensure labor peace.
Medical journals quarrel
Boston — Two leading medical journals have ac
cused each other of suppressing the free flow of in
formation in the medical world.
At issue is the New England Journals long-stand
ing policy of refusing to publish studies that have
been reported elsewhere, including newspaper
articles based on interviews with the researchers.
The Journal of the American Medical Associa
tion, known as JAMA, says that policy is "un
realistic and elitist." It says that because of this
"attempted information monopoly," doctors refuse
to discuss their work before it is published, resulting
in incomplete and inaccurate reporting of the latest
medical developments.
JAMA blasted the New England Journal and its
editor. Dr. Arnold Relman, in two sharply worded
editorials published in the current issue. In an in
terview, Relman reponded that the criticism was
"misinformed and misguided."
The so-called "Ingelfinger Rule" is a recurring
source of controversy for the New England Journal,
generally regarded as America's leading medical
journal. The policy is named for its instigator,
former Editor Franz Ingelfinger, who died last
March.
Relman defends the policy as a way to keep re
searchers from releasing inaccurate, half-baked
findings to the world. Instead, he feels, such work
should be subjected to the scrutiny of journal editors
and medical reviewers.
The JAMA editorials, written by staff editors
Gail Mcßride and Dr. Lawrence Grouse, complain
that scientists are afraid to talk to reporters about
their work, even if chances are slim that it will ever
be published in the New England Journal.
'Pro-life' policy promised
Washington — Thousands of anti-abortion demon
strators marched in the capital yesterday and heard
Health and Human Services Secretary Richard
Schweiker promise "to implement a pro-life policy"
in his department. Leaders of the march met with
President Ronald Reagan.
Schweiker addressed a cheering crowd gathered
on the Ellipse on the eighth anniversary of the Su
preme Court decision permitting abortions.
The former Pennsylvania senator, a longtime foe
of abortion, recalled that he had addressed a similar
rally last year and said he was proud to return "in
my first day on the job. "
Schweiker's agency in the past has funded abor
tions under the Medicaid program for women, but
federal Medicaid funding was restricted last year to
instances of rape, incest or when the woman's life
was in danger.
Schweiker said, "I will work for you to implement
a pro-life policy in the Department of Health and Hu
man Services. You know very well that you have a
friend in the Health and Human Services Depart
ment of the Reagan administation.
Schweiker predicted in a brief interview as he left

the rally that the Senate would pass an amendment
restricting abortion. "It's going to be a pro-life Sen
ate instead of a pro-abortion Senate . . . It's fair to
say the tables have turned in our favor."
Vietnam POW: more still captive
Catnp Lejeune, N.C.— Marine PFC Robert Gar
wood. a POW in Vietnam for 14 years, reported
seeing "a couple hundred other Americans" still in
captivity in Vietnam and was upset that authorities
didn't question him about it, a Navy psychiatrist tes
tified yesterday.
But Col. Switzer, who is presiding over Garwood's
court-martial on charges of desertion and collabora
tion with the enemy, ruled that the statements by
Capt. Benjamin Ogburn were irrelevant and should
be stricken from the record. He told the jury of five
Marine officers to disregard the testimony.
Switzer has ruled previously during the 10-week
trial of the Indiana native that similar information
also was irrelevant.
"Garwood said he didn't know exactly who the
Americans were, but that he was upset and con
cerned that he was not debriefed like other people,"
the psychiatrist had said. "He knew that there were
other Americans still in Vietnam and he felt that
should be brought out."
Court officials said they expect the case to go to
the jury by the end of next week.
As of July 1980 one American was still classified
by the Defense Department as a prisoner of war in
Southeast Asia, and 19 were carried as missing in ac
tion.
Stocks continue to decline
New York — The stock market continued its
broad decline yesterday with oil and mining issues
posting sharp declines. Analysts noted investor con
cern over the prospect of rising interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks,
which lost 27.04 points the first three days of the
week, gave up another 5.81 points to finish at 940.44
in moderate trading.
Big Board volume reached 39.88 million shares,
up slightly from 39.19 on Wednesday.
Today's weather
Clearing tonight. Mostly fair with patchy morning
fog or low clouds tomorrow. Cooler. Lows in the mid
30s to mid 40s tonight. Highs in the mid 50s to low 60s.

Polish police block farmers
Warsaw, Poland — Polish police blocked off a
demonstration by angry farmers in a rural area yes
terday and members of the independent trade union
Solidarity shut more than 800 factories in the Baltic
seaport of Gdansk and other cities.
The protests were followed by reports of more
strikes planned for today in Warsaw, the Walbrzych
area in southwest Poland, Grudziadz in the
northwest and elsewhere.
A Solidarity spokesman said the farmers, who
have been pressing for their own independent union
for the past three months, planned a protest rally in
downtown Bydgoszcz where many shops closed and
streetcars and buses were reported halted for two
hours.
In Inowroclaw, 35 miles to the south, another 200
farmers held a rally without incident, the spokes
man said:
A Solidarity spokesman said that in at least a
dozen cities, workers shut hundreds of factories to
press demands for a five-day, 40-hour workweek, un
ion access to the media and revised labor and
censorship laws. The official Polish news agency
PAP, however, reported strikes in only five cities.
Defense Secretary to rearm US
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger said in his first message to the troops yester
day that his mission is "to rearm America."
"As I take office as our 15th secretary of de
fense." Weinberger said in a message to the 3 mil
lion military and civilian people attached to the De
fense Department, "I am very much aware of the
need to add greatly to America's military
strength."
The first solid indication of how he intends to do
this will come in the way he handles the fiscal 1981
and 1982 defense budgets inherited from the Carter
administration.
Weinberger's options are to let the Carter budget
stand pretty much as is, change it only slightly or at
tempt a complete overhaul. Edwin Meese, Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's counselor, said last week that
the new administration might be able to live with the
fiscal 1981 defense budget it inherited.
Carter's fiscal 1982 defense budget calls for big in
creases to make military forces readier to fight, an
emphasis Weinberger endorsed at his confirmation
hearing and in his first message yesterday. He
pledged as well yesterday "to begin now to restore
our strategic balance."
Most of cabinet confirmed
Washington — The Senate moved rapidly yester
day toward confirming the rest of President Ronald
Reagan's Cabinet, including the controversial nomi
nation of James Watt to head the Interior Depart
ment,
In votes late yesterday afternoon, the Senate ap
proved the appointments of Reagan's attorney gen
eral and his secretaries of agriculture, commerce,
housing and urban development, and transportation.
There was little opposition to most of yesterday's
approval votes, clearing the way for debate on Watt,
who was opposed by environmentalists beoause of
his past opposition to Interior Department con
servation policies.
Reagan's labor secretary-designate, Raymond

Donovan, was the only nominee not on the Senate
calendar. Several Cabinet members were approved
earlier in the week.
The Senate Labor Committee has delayed a vote
on Donovan's appointment pending FBI investiga

Medical journals quarrel
Boston — Two leading medical journals have ac
cused each other of suppressing the free flow of in
formation in the medical world.
At issue is the New England Journals long-stand
ing policy of refusing to publish studies that have
been reported elsewhere, including newspaper
articles based on interviews with the researchers.
The Journal of the American Medical Associa
tion, known as JAMA, says that policy is "un
realistic and elitist." It says that because of this
"attempted information monopoly," doctors refuse
to discuss their work before it is published, resulting
in incomplete and inaccurate reporting of the latest
medical developments.
JAMA blasted the New England Journal and its
editor. Dr. Arnold Relman, in two sharply worded
editorials published in the current issue. In an in
terview, Relman reponded that the criticism was
"misinformed and misguided."
The so-called "Ingelfinger Rule" is a recurring
source of controversy for the New England Journal,
generally regarded as America's leading medical
journal. The policy is named for its instigator,
former Editor Franz Ingelfinger, who died last
March.
Relman defends the policy as a way to keep re
searchers from releasing inaccurate, half-baked
findings to the world. Instead, he feels, such work
should be subjected to the scrutiny of journal editors
and medical reviewers.
The JAMA editorials, written by staff editors
Gail Mcßride and Dr. Lawrence Grouse, complain
that scientists are afraid to talk to reporters about
their work, even if chances are slim that it will ever
be published in the New England Journal.
'Pro-life' policy promised
Washington — Thousands of anti-abortion demon
strators marched in the capital yesterday and heard
Health and Human Services Secretary Richard
Schweiker promise "to implement a pro-life policy"
in his department. Leaders of the march met with
President Ronald Reagan.
Schweiker addressed a cheering crowd gathered
on the Ellipse on the eighth anniversary of the Su
preme Court decision permitting abortions.
The former Pennsylvania senator, a longtime foe
of abortion, recalled that he had addressed a similar
rally last year and said he was proud to return "in
my first day on the job. "
Schweiker's agency in the past has funded abor
tions under the Medicaid program for women, but
federal Medicaid funding was restricted last year to
instances of rape, incest or when the woman's life
was in danger.
Schweiker said, "I will work for you to implement
a pro-life policy in the Department of Health and Hu
man Services. You know very well that you have a
friend in the Health and Human Services Depart
ment of the Reagan administation.
Schweiker predicted in a brief interview as he left

the rally that the Senate would pass an amendment
restricting abortion. "It's going to be a pro-life Sen
ate instead of a pro-abortion Senate . . . It's fair to
say the tables have turned in our favor."
Vietnam POW: more still captive
Catnp Lejeune, N.C.— Marine PFC Robert Gar
wood. a POW in Vietnam for 14 years, reported
seeing "a couple hundred other Americans" still in
captivity in Vietnam and was upset that authorities
didn't question him about it, a Navy psychiatrist tes
tified yesterday.
But Col. Switzer, who is presiding over Garwood's
court-martial on charges of desertion and collabora
tion with the enemy, ruled that the statements by
Capt. Benjamin Ogburn were irrelevant and should
be stricken from the record. He told the jury of five
Marine officers to disregard the testimony.
Switzer has ruled previously during the 10-week
trial of the Indiana native that similar information
also was irrelevant.
"Garwood said he didn't know exactly who the
Americans were, but that he was upset and con
cerned that he was not debriefed like other people,"
the psychiatrist had said. "He knew that there were
other Americans still in Vietnam and he felt that
should be brought out."
Court officials said they expect the case to go to
the jury by the end of next week.
As of July 1980 one American was still classified
by the Defense Department as a prisoner of war in
Southeast Asia, and 19 were carried as missing in ac
tion.

Polish police block farmers
Warsaw, Poland — Polish police blocked off a
demonstration by angry farmers in a rural area yes
terday and members of the independent trade union
Solidarity shut more than 800 factories in the Baltic
seaport of Gdansk and other cities.
The protests were followed by reports of more
strikes planned for today in Warsaw, the Walbrzych
area in southwest Poland, Grudziadz in the
northwest and elsewhere.
A Solidarity spokesman said the farmers, who
have been pressing for their own independent union
for the past three months, planned a protest rally in
downtown Bydgoszcz where many shops closed and
streetcars and buses were reported halted for two
hours.
In Inowroclaw, 35 miles to the south, another 200
farmers held a rally without incident, the spokes
man said:
A Solidarity spokesman said that in at least a
dozen cities, workers shut hundreds of factories to
press demands for a five-day, 40-hour workweek, un
ion access to the media and revised labor and
censorship laws. The official Polish news agency
PAP, however, reported strikes in only five cities.
Defense Secretary to rearm US
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger said in his first message to the troops yester
day that his mission is "to rearm America."
"As I take office as our 15th secretary of de
fense." Weinberger said in a message to the 3 mil
lion military and civilian people attached to the De
fense Department, "I am very much aware of the
need to add greatly to America's military
strength."
The first solid indication of how he intends to do
this will come in the way he handles the fiscal 1981
and 1982 defense budgets inherited from the Carter
administration.
Weinberger's options are to let the Carter budget
stand pretty much as is, change it only slightly or at
tempt a complete overhaul. Edwin Meese, Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's counselor, said last week that
the new administration might be able to live with the
fiscal 1981 defense budget it inherited.
Carter's fiscal 1982 defense budget calls for big in
creases to make military forces readier to fight, an
emphasis Weinberger endorsed at his confirmation
hearing and in his first message yesterday. He
pledged as well yesterday "to begin now to restore
our strategic balance."
Most of cabinet confirmed
Washington — The Senate moved rapidly yester
day toward confirming the rest of President Ronald
Reagan's Cabinet, including the controversial nomi
nation of James Watt to head the Interior Depart
ment,
In votes late yesterday afternoon, the Senate ap
proved the appointments of Reagan's attorney gen
eral and his secretaries of agriculture, commerce,
housing and urban development, and transportation.
There was little opposition to most of yesterday's
approval votes, clearing the way for debate on Watt,
who was opposed by environmentalists beoause of
his past opposition to Interior Department con
servation policies.
Reagan's labor secretary-designate, Raymond

Donovan, was the only nominee not on the Senate
calendar. Several Cabinet members were approved
earlier in the week.
The Senate Labor Committee has delayed a vote
on Donovan's appointment pending FBI investiga
tion of claims that Donovan's New Jersey construc
tion firm made illegal payoffs to ensure labor peace.
Medical journals quarrel
Boston — Two leading medical journals have ac
cused each other of suppressing the free flow of in
formation in the medical world.
At issue is the New England Journals long-stand
ing policy of refusing to publish studies that have
been reported elsewhere, including newspaper
articles based on interviews with the researchers.
The Journal of the American Medical Associa
tion, known as JAMA, says that policy is "un
realistic and elitist." It says that because of this
"attempted information monopoly," doctors refuse
to discuss their work before it is published, resulting
in incomplete and inaccurate reporting of the latest
medical developments.
JAMA blasted the New England Journal and its
editor. Dr. Arnold Relman, in two sharply worded
editorials published in the current issue. In an in
terview, Relman reponded that the criticism was
"misinformed and misguided."
The so-called "Ingelfinger Rule" is a recurring
source of controversy for the New England Journal,
generally regarded as America's leading medical
journal. The policy is named for its instigator,
former Editor Franz Ingelfinger, who died last
March.
Relman defends the policy as a way to keep re
searchers from releasing inaccurate, half-baked
findings to the world. Instead, he feels, such work
should be subjected to the scrutiny of journal editors
and medical reviewers.
The JAMA editorials, written by staff editors
Gail Mcßride and Dr. Lawrence Grouse, complain
that scientists are afraid to talk to reporters about
their work, even if chances are slim that it will ever
be published in the New England Journal.
'Pro-life' policy promised
Washington — Thousands of anti-abortion demon
strators marched in the capital yesterday and heard
Health and Human Services Secretary Richard
Schweiker promise "to implement a pro-life policy"
in his department. Leaders of the march met with
President Ronald Reagan.
Schweiker addressed a cheering crowd gathered
on the Ellipse on the eighth anniversary of the Su
preme Court decision permitting abortions.
The former Pennsylvania senator, a longtime foe
of abortion, recalled that he had addressed a similar
rally last year and said he was proud to return "in
my first day on the job. "
Schweiker's agency in the past has funded abor
tions under the Medicaid program for women, but
federal Medicaid funding was restricted last year to
instances of rape, incest or when the woman's life
was in danger.
Schweiker said, "I will work for you to implement
a pro-life policy in the Department of Health and Hu
man Services. You know very well that you have a
friend in the Health and Human Services Depart
ment of the Reagan administation.
Schweiker predicted in a brief interview as he left

the rally that the Senate would pass an amendment
restricting abortion. "It's going to be a pro-life Sen
ate instead of a pro-abortion Senate . . . It's fair to
say the tables have turned in our favor."
Vietnam POW: more still captive
Catnp Lejeune, N.C.— Marine PFC Robert Gar
wood. a POW in Vietnam for 14 years, reported
seeing "a couple hundred other Americans" still in
captivity in Vietnam and was upset that authorities
didn't question him about it, a Navy psychiatrist tes
tified yesterday.
But Col. Switzer, who is presiding over Garwood's
court-martial on charges of desertion and collabora
tion with the enemy, ruled that the statements by
Capt. Benjamin Ogburn were irrelevant and should
be stricken from the record. He told the jury of five
Marine officers to disregard the testimony.
Switzer has ruled previously during the 10-week
trial of the Indiana native that similar information
also was irrelevant.
"Garwood said he didn't know exactly who the
Americans were, but that he was upset and con
cerned that he was not debriefed like other people,"
the psychiatrist had said. "He knew that there were
other Americans still in Vietnam and he felt that
should be brought out."
Court officials said they expect the case to go to
the jury by the end of next week.
As of July 1980 one American was still classified
by the Defense Department as a prisoner of war in
Southeast Asia, and 19 were carried as missing in ac
tion.
