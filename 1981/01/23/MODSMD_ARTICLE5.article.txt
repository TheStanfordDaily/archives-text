Washington — President Ronald
Reagan reacted with outrage yester
day to the tales of terror told by Amer
icans freed from captivity in Iran,
while former President Jimmy
Carter, who held an emotional meet
ing in West Germany with the freed
hostages, counseled his successor:
"Never do any favors for the hood
lums who persecuted innocent Ameri
can heroes."
As Carter's handwritten report on
his journey to Wiesbaden was de
livered to Reagan by former Vice
President Walter Mondale, indigna
tion over brutal treatment of the 52
Americans prompted calls in Con
gress for the new president to consider
disavowing parts of the agreement

with Iran. Senate Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) promised
comprehensive hearings on the
hostage issue.
Mondale said after meeting with
Reagan that the new president "was
outraged, as all Americans are and
will be when they hear the full de
tails." Vice President George Bush
said the accounts of physical and men
tal abuse of the hostages are "of
enormous concern to the president."
"It really concerns him, deeply con
cerns him, outrages him," said Bush,
who was present in the Oval Office
when Mondale delivered Carter's let
ter and added his own report of the
meeting with the freed hostages in
Wiesbaden Wednesday.
Carter 'visibly angered'
Carter, whose term as president
ended Tuesday barely a half hour
before the hostages were freed after
444 days of captivity, returned to his
Plains, Ga., home visibly angered by
what he heard at Wiesbaden.
He urged Reagan to carry out terms
of the agreement with Iran — "our na
tion's word of honor is at stake," he
said — but he had harsh words for the
revolutionary kidnappers. He spoke of
"savagery against absolutely inno
cent hostages" and declared: "These
are acts of animals almost."
When Carter met with the former
hostages. f he first question put to him
concerned the commando rescue at
tempt last April, which failed. Several
officials who were present said that
the questioner, who was not identified,
bluntly asked Carter, "Why didn't you
do it sooner?"
Carter's response detailed how he
attempted to achieve release of the
hostages through negotiations, order
ing the rescue attempt only after those
efforts were stalemated.
Meeting went well
After that apparent initial coolness,
the mood oi the meeting wanned con
siderably, tfiose present sald. "By trie
end of the meeting, the feeling was
quite warm," Lloyd Cutler, former
White House counsel, said. "Their
doctor said it was worth at least two
days of therapy."

Even before Carter arrived in Ger
many, the freed hostages had been
telling their families in trans-Atlantic
telephone calls of the beatings,
solitary confinement and other inci
dents of mistreatment.
And.yesterday, Iran replied for the
first time.
In Tehran, the state radio quoted
chief Iranian negotiator Bahzad
Nabavi as denying the accounts of
mistreatment. Nabavi said Iran had
videotaped interviews with the
hostages in which they said they had
been treated well and had no com
plaints, according to the broadcast.
'Judgement of people*
"If necessary, we will transmit all
of them (the interviews) through sat
ellite for the judgment of people of the
world," Nabavi said. "Then it will be
known which is the liar, Washington or
Tehran."
Reagan made no direct reference to
the former hostages' accounts of mis
treatment when he dispatched a
message to Wiesbaden yesterday af
ternoon.
"Welcome to freedom," he told the
52 Americans. "While we at home can
not begin to know the depth of your
feelings, we want you to know of our
profound respect for your pro
fessionalism and patriotism under the
most demanding circumstances.
"As difficult as this experience has
been for each of you, it contains les
sons for us all. Please know that we
are with each of you, and that this
episode in our history will be ever with
us as, together, we look to the future."
Possible disavowal
On Capitol Hill, resolutions were in
troduced in both the House and Senate
urging Reagan to feel free to disavow
the terms of the hostage agreement.
"The president would be justified in
renouncing all or part of the agree
ment if he finds it is in the interests of
the United States to do so," Rep. Paul
(H-111. > author of th« bioilaf*
measure, said.
Reagan "should feel entirely free to
evaluate that agreement. . . discard
ing those sections" that do not meet
