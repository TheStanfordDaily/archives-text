# Symposium on South Asia
## American interests in region discussed 
### Alexi Assmus 
South Asia is "a complex area little understood by
most Americans," said one speaker last Wednesday
during a symposium focusing on issues of U.S. mili
tary and economic security interests in the region.
The symposium was the most recent in a continuing
weekly series called "A World in Crisis — The U.S.
Faces the '80s."
Richard Heggie, chairman of the World Affairs
Council, introduced the speakers, Stanford Assoc.
Prof, of Food Research Carl Gotsch, UC-Berkeley
Prof. Leo Rose, and Anthony Arnold and Richard
Hendricson of the Asian Foundation.
Gotsch, an economist, set the stage for the sym
posium by providing a broad overview of the eco
nomic situation in India and other South Asian coun
tries, including Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Burma.
"The whole region is a lot better off than it was four
or five years ago," he said, noting the general nature
of such a statement.
Gotsch said U.S. bilateral aid is much less impor
tant for these countries now, and that scarcity of
food is no longer the overwhelming problem it once
was,
Major need: energy
Rather, he said, the region today is much like the
rest of the world, finding its most acute problem to

be a lack of energy. Gotsch cited the oil-food trade
between India and the Soviet Union as an example in
support of this point.
Rose, a political scientist and expert on Asian af
fairs, and editor of the Asian Survey, said U.S. poli
cy in South Asia has been a low priority for our gov
ernment. Any attention given to this region, he said,
tends to focus on the differences, rather than the
agreements, between the U.S. and the other nations.
Because of this, the U.S. lacks credibility in the re
gion, according to Rose.
Ongoing tensions between Pakistan and India are
another problem. Rose said. Rose said India may ov
erreact to the new Reagan administration, fearing
expanded arms aid to Pakistan beyond what the In
dian government feels it can tolerate.
Although he said he does not feel that the new ad
ministration has thought about policy in South Asia
yet. he said he worries that India's apprehensions
may drive her closer to the Soviet Union, thus forc
ing the United States into more formal commit
ments with Pakistan.

Arnold, a foreign service specialist on Soviet af
fairs. gave a brief talk on Soviet and U.S. policy op
tions in Afghanistan He said he believes that the
purpose of the Soviet invasion was both offensive

and defensive, and that it was by Soviet
perception of a weakening U.S.
World reactions after the move into Afghanistan
were "a horrid shock" to the Soviets, as was the re
sistance of the people of Afghanistan, Arnold said.
He added that although official U.S. policy has been
to punish the Soviets for their actions, "we really
have written off the country (Afghanistan)."
He also said there are "faint signs" that the Sovi
et s can be persuaded to withdraw from the country,
citing the fact that Afghanistan is not part of the
Warsaw Pact, and that the Soviet s say they will
stay in the country only as long as is necessary, as
open paths for possible Soviet withdrawal.
"The U.S. should keep this issue alive in every
possible form," Arnold said, adding that the pres
sure exerted on the Soviet people through the U.S.
grain embargo was especially effective.
Hendricson. the last major speaker, stressed the
importance of South Asia in the formation of Ameri
can foreign policy, though he said at present the re
gion is "a complex area little understood by most
Americans." •
Hendricson also countered Gotsch's statement
that Pakistan's economic situation is improving He
said the governments there have been corrupt, lead
ing to economic instability.

Arnold, a foreign service specialist on Soviet af
fairs. gave a brief talk on Soviet and U.S. policy op
tions in Afghanistan He said he believes that the
purpose of the Soviet invasion was both offensive

and defensive, and that it was by Soviet
perception of a weakening U.S.
World reactions after the move into Afghanistan
were "a horrid shock" to the Soviets, as was the re
sistance of the people of Afghanistan, Arnold said.
He added that although official U.S. policy has been
to punish the Soviets for their actions, "we really
have written off the country (Afghanistan)."
He also said there are "faint signs" that the Sovi
et s can be persuaded to withdraw from the country,
citing the fact that Afghanistan is not part of the
Warsaw Pact, and that the Soviet s say they will
stay in the country only as long as is necessary, as
open paths for possible Soviet withdrawal.
"The U.S. should keep this issue alive in every
possible form," Arnold said, adding that the pres
sure exerted on the Soviet people through the U.S.
grain embargo was especially effective.
Hendricson. the last major speaker, stressed the
importance of South Asia in the formation of Ameri
can foreign policy, though he said at present the re
gion is "a complex area little understood by most
Americans." •
Hendricson also countered Gotsch's statement
that Pakistan's economic situation is improving He
said the governments there have been corrupt, lead
ing to economic instability.
