## Soviets raise tax on U.S. firms 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — Soviet authorities
have suddenly levied new taxes
against American firms operat
ing here as part of a package of
extra hard currency payments
being demanded of all foreign
businesses with permanent rep
resentatives here.
Amid rumors of worse to
come, the extra payments in
clude doubled rents, mandatory
extra money for local Soviet
employees and unique yearly
"maintenance" charges for
rented offices.
In addition, the Soviets have
interpreted the 1973 Soviet-
American tax agreement as em
powering Moscow to levy a new
tax on all profits made by Amer
ican firms selling equipment or
other goods to the Soviets. The
authorities have refused to dis
close what tax rate will be used,
but the worst of the rumors
circulating here within the
enraged U.S. business com
munity sets the new rate at 40
percent of all Soviet-based prof
its.
The 28 permanent U.S. busi
ness and bank representatives
here have jqst come off the
worst yearly drop in Soviet-
American trade in the decade
since detente brought the busi
nessmen flocking here in search
of vast new markets.
In 1979, bilateral trade topped
$4.5 billion, and until the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan in late
December that year, seemed to
have achieved a breakthrough
that could only mean much,
much more to come. However,
the Carter administration's sub
sequent economic sanctions
shattered such notions. In 1980,
trade plunged to less than half
the figure of the previous year.
The new payments, which are
being appealed to senior Soviet
officials, seem designed to in
crease the hard-currency take
from the businesses.

No other major capitalist
country faces the kind of profits
tax the Soviets want to impose,
and the U.S. firms have asked
the State Department for advice
and help in fending off the sud
den charge. The Soviets have
demanded such information as
how much a firm paid for raw
materials it used in manufac
turing items later sold here.
"Absurd," said one source. "I
don't know whether they're just
stupid or just evil-minded."
Instead of paying their local
employees directly, the firms as
of April 1 will be required to de
posit money in an account with
the government organization
which caters to all foreigners
permanently resident in Mos
cow, the Diplomatic Service
Corps Bureau. The bureau will
then pay the employees, vir
tually guaranteeing endless
paylines and lost work-hours. In
addition, the bureau has de
manded an extra monthly 10
percent "social welfare"
payment, and depost of 2V 2
months' salary ahead of time in
a non-interest bearing account
"in case of salary disputes."
So far, these new regulations
apply only to foreign businesses,
but the foreign diplomatic and
news community has been
awash in rumors for months
that they, too, may eventually
face the same new demands.
These rumors also say that
foreigners in the months ahead
will be denied the access they
now have to special coupons, or
a form of money available only
to those with hard currency ac
counts.
Two representatives are said
to have been waiting since Octo
ber to see some Soviet officials,
and others say the Russians
may be coming to the view that
they don't need the Americans
much after all — Moscow can
get what it needs from the Eu
ropeans or Japanese.

den charge. The Soviets have
demanded such information as
how much a firm paid for raw
materials it used in manufac
turing items later sold here.
"Absurd," said one source. "I
don't know whether they're just
stupid or just evil-minded."
Instead of paying their local
employees directly, the firms as
of April 1 will be required to de
posit money in an account with
the government organization
which caters to all foreigners
permanently resident in Mos
cow, the Diplomatic Service
Corps Bureau. The bureau will
then pay the employees, vir
tually guaranteeing endless
paylines and lost work-hours. In
addition, the bureau has de
manded an extra monthly 10
percent "social welfare"
payment, and depost of 2V 2
months' salary ahead of time in
a non-interest bearing account
"in case of salary disputes."
So far, these new regulations
apply only to foreign businesses,
but the foreign diplomatic and
news community has been
awash in rumors for months
that they, too, may eventually
face the same new demands.
These rumors also say that
foreigners in the months ahead
will be denied the access they
now have to special coupons, or
a form of money available only
to those with hard currency ac
counts.
Two representatives are said
to have been waiting since Octo
ber to see some Soviet officials,
and others say the Russians
may be coming to the view that
they don't need the Americans
much after all — Moscow can
get what it needs from the Eu
ropeans or Japanese.
