# Two S. African papers banned

### Los Angeles Times 
Johannesburg, South Africa â€” The government
forced the closing of two black-edited newspapers
Tuesday, leaving the 1 million residents of
Soweto, the black suburb of this city, with only a
weekly to reflect their views.
In another crackdown on black dissent, security
police arrested 14 persons in the diamond mining
town of Kimberley and warned the Anglican
bishop there to stop protesting the arrests, includ
ing those of two black Anglican churchmen.
Together, the actions constitute the strongest
government move against racial protesters since
Oct. 19. 1977. when there were widespread ar
rests. Among those seized at that time was Percy
Qoboza, whose newspaper, in Soweto, was
banned.
Unusual timing
There was widespread criticism of the most re
cent crackdown, and political observers were
puzzled at the timing. Parliament convenes today
and Prime Minister Pieter Botha and his ruling
party plan to introduce legislation to moderate
many racist laws in a desire to reduce racial ten
sion.
The papers closed Tuesday were the Post
Transvaal and the Sunday Post, with circulations
of more than 100,000 each. They are part of the
white-owned Argus chain. Another Argus news
paper, the Johannesburg Star, is the leading Eng

lish-language paper in South Africa and strongly
anti-government.
The Post Transvaal and Sunday Post were
struck in October by the newly formed Union of
Black Journalists. When the strike was settled in
December, the government said that the papers
had lost their publishing license under a law re
quiring newspapers to publish at least one edition
every month.
Threats to ban
The Argus managing director, Hal Miller, tried
to obtain new licenses, but he said he was in
formed by government officials that if he suc
ceeded in getting them the government would ban
the papers as soon as they appeared on the street.
"We see no point in making a futile gesture by
insisting on registration (obtaining a new license)
and thai submitting to the injustice of actual ban
ning," Miller said.
The government offered no explanation for its
actions. Late in December it also banned three
prominent black newsmen from working on any
publication.
Qoboza, who was detained for four months after
his newspaper. The World, was banned, had upon
release become editor of the Post Transvaal
Last week, believing that the Post Transvaal
was also doomed, Qoboza resigned and left for the
United States where he has joined the staff of the
Washington Star.
