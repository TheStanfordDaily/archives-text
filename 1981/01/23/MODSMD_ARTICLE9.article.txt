# Yugoslavia faces economic woes one year after Tito
## 
### Washington Post 
Belgrade — Toward the end of his life,
Marshal Josip Broz Tito liked to boast:
"I can go at any time — and nothing will
change in Yugoslavia after I am gone."
' A year has passed since the World War
II guerrilla leader underwent two opera
tions and started a slow decline toward
death. It was not until May 4 that he final
ly died, a few days before his 88th birth
day, but power was effectively trans
ferred to a collective leadership when he
was admitted to the hospital last Janu
ary. /
In the past 12 months, modern Yugo
slavia has finally emerged from under
the protective shadow of its founding
father. Without Tito's guiding influence,
the new leaders have had to grapple with
economic crisis and national rivalries
and the preliminary results have been
encouraging.
Whatever their other differences,
Tito's successors seem determined to
preserve his three great achievements:
Yugoslavia's non-aligned status, unity
between the different Yugoslav na
tionalities. and the unique political sys

tem based on the idea of workers' self
management.
Changes in direction
But there have been changes in other
areas that are indicative of the direction
Yugoslavia is taking.
Over the last year, more power has
been delegated to the six republics and
two autonomous regions that make up
the Yugoslav federation. These regional
groupings rotate the federal and party
presidencies.
After years of enjoying the global
limelight, Yugoslavia is slowly coming
to terms with the harsh fact that it is a
small country — 22 million people — of
limited importance. Recognizing the in
evitable, Yugoslav officials have recent
ly attempted to scale down the protocol
to normal proportions.
According to the new regulations, "or
ganized foreign visitors"
— a euphemism for what foreign journal
ists usually describe as "a rent-a
crowd" — are also banned.
Fighting corruption
Coinciding with attacks on wasteful

foreign representation has been a cam
paign against corruption at home. Sever
al important local officials, including the
mayor of the town of Kragujevac, have
been relieved from their posts following
allegations that they used their positions
to amass private wealth.
The allegations were triggered by rev
elations of fraud and embezzlement at a
Belgrade engineering firm. The firm is
said to have built houses and weekend
cottages for officials in return for politi
cal favors.
At the height of the scandal, the popu
lar mayor of Belgrade was forced to go
on television to explain his own dealings
with the firm, reveal details of his in
come and formally deny that he had been
the recipient of "women, music, or bac
chanalia."
So far no senior Yugoslav leader has
been implicated. Even so, public dis
cussion of such scandals marks a re
freshing change for Yugoslavia where,
until recently, officials were almost im
mune from individual criticism.
As a Yugoslav diplomat said: "When

Tito was alive, it was always difficult to
attack officials for their lavish lifestyle
or their string of villas. Now, however,
high living has become legitimate
target."
Economic difficulties
Ordinary Yugoslavs are also getting a
taste of austerity. Last year, the real liv
ing standards of most families fell and
there were shortages of essential con
sumer items such as coffee, tea, butter,
soap powder, and medicines. Inflation is
officially estimated at 30 percent, unof
ficially at 40 percent.
The reasons for these economic dif
ficulties lie primarily in past mistakes
and have nothing to do with Tito's death.
Even so, because of the coincidence in
timing, many Yugoslavs draw the con
clusion that — without Tito — the good
life is threatened.
In fact, there is no evidence that Tito's
absence has made tackling economic
problems any more difficult. In some
areas, notably the devaluation of the
dinar by 30 percent last year, the new col
lective leadership has shown itself more
decisive than Tito.
