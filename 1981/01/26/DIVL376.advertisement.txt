Three men sat together at a club in Zurich,
discussing the meaning of happiness a Fren
chman, an Englishman and a Russian
"Ah, my friends,' the tastefully dressed
Frenchman began, adjusting his apneat silk
ascot, "so you wish to know the true meaning
of happiness, oui" The two other men toyed
with tneir drinks, nodding. The Frenchman
smiled and continued. "My picture of the
true meaning of happiness is indeed sim
ple," he said with Gallic entnusiasm. "You
meet with a beautiful, intelligent, spirited
woman, and have dinner at Phillipe's on the
Rue de Amour You then, as the sun sets,
drive to a cabin in the countryside, and there
— ah, oui, there — there you nake the love to
her until dawn." The Frenchman sipped deli
cately at his cognac, smiled and murmured, I
"That, my friends, is the meaning of true hap
piness." He sighed and sal back
The Englishman bristled slightly, and broke
into the Frenchman's reflections "I say, old
chap, what you say is all well and good — don't
take me'wrong, y'know — but there is more to
it." He lit one of his endless Dunhill Turkish
Blend cirgarettes with a flourish, and spoke
with authority "The true meaning of happiness
is a lovely sunrise breakfast, followed by a
morning of foxhunting on the moor The air
brisk and dean, the sun warm the excitement
of the hunt — who could wish for more?" The
Englishman blew a great cloud of smoke re
flectively, and sighecf "There's yer bloody ap
piness, gents
The Russian downed his four ounces of
vodka with a gulp "Nyef, nyet, fovari'chee,"
he chortled with Slavic heaviness He poured
himself more vodka, and lit a noxious cigar
T)n, the meaning of happiness is simple You
come home from work at tractor factory, walk
up two flights to small apartment You then sit
down in favorite chair — the one with squeaky
leg, da ? You then place son Alexei on knee, to
tell him funny story, when you hear heavy
KGB-type boots on stairs. This is followed by
heavy KGB-type knock at door Wife Ludmilla
opens door, and in walk three heavy KGB-type
men with bulges at chest where heavy KGB
type pistols are not-so-hidden They point to
you and say. "Are you Mikhail Boronkov?,' in
heavy KGB-type voices. You say, 'Nyet. Three
flights up.'"
The Russian clapped his friends on the
shoulders, spilling their dnnks, and exclaimed
reverentially, "Thattovurichee, is the meaning
of happiness "
A lifeboat was overcrowded and it was de
cided one person would have to swim for his
life They drew straws A lawyer lost and. as
agreed, jumped Into the water He had swum
no more than 50 yards when he was suddenly
approached by a Great White Shark Surpris
ingly, he appeared to strike up a conversation
with the shark The shark nodded his head,
then towed the waterlogged lawyer oft toward
shore Shortly thereafter, the lawyer returned
with a Coast Guard rescue ship. The fellow
passengers were of course amazed "How on
earth did you get the shark to tow you," they
asked. "Professional courtesy," he replied.
