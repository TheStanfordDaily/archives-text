## U.S. aids El Salvador despite abuses 
### Washington Post 
San Salvador — Six U.S.-
loaned Bell UHIH helicopters,
waiting to be transformed into
gunships and troop transports,
rest like slouching beasts near
the runway of Ilopango Airport
outside this capital. Salvadoran
troops are breaking out their
new American M-16 rifles,
grenade launchers, flak jackets
and steel helmets.

!\eivs analysis

Up to 20 U.S. advisers are
showing them how to make it all
work and keep working while
another five are teaching their
commanders strategy for hunt
ing down battered leftist guer
rillas retreating in the wake of
their failed "final offensive."
The leftist push that began
Jan. 10 took El Salvador's
bloody political strife over the
brink to civil war. With
Guatemalan and Honduran
troops on alert. Nicaragua ac
cused of helping Cuba and other
communist countries aid the
guerrillas, and the conspicuous
arrival of U.S. guns, the war is
heading toward even wider and

more dangerous confrontations.
State Department spokesmen
in Washington carefully em
phasize the "modest" nature of
the new $5 million military aid
program for El Salvador. But
for the first time since El
Salvador was caught in the net
of Carter administration refusal
to provide guns and bullets to al
leged human rights abusers in
Latin America in 1977, that aid
now includes "lethal" military
equipment.
Approved by former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter in the wan
ing hours of his presidency,
these shipments were justified
to the public partially as mili
tary necessity and partly on the
basis of Salvadoran government
claims that it is trying to in
vestigate the abuses. El
Salvador also says it is planning
to transfer government control
from the military to civilian
leadership.
Fear of leftists
But the resumption of mili
tary aid and its subsequent in
crease was based primarily on
U.S. fears that the U.S.-backed
government was about to be ov
errun by the leftists, according
to analysts. Official U.S. claims
of improvement here are, at
best, misleading. Both public
and private information in
dicates that Salvadoran in
vestigations are either nonexis
tent or ineffective, that wide
spread abuses continue and that
control remains largely in the
hands of the military.
For the last two years, U.S.
policy here has been to try to
end the terrorism and fighting
by undermining right-wing ex
tremists. drawing the line
against a violent takeover by
the radical left, and attempting
to foster a centrist government
capable of carrying out sweep
ing reforms of the country's so
cial. political and economic
structures.
To shore up these efforts, but
still discourage human rights
abuses, the State Department
has supplied El Salvador with
massive economic aid — at
least $82 million last year.
Temporary suspension
On Dec 5, all U.S. military
and economic support suddenly
was suspended amid charges
that Salvadoran government se
curity forces were involved in
the brutal murder of four Amer
ican churchwomen, including

three nuns.
Economic aid was renewed
after 12 days, on the ground that
the Salvaaoran economy was
about to collapse. But military
support — which church and hu
man rights groups claimed
would be an endorsement of
Salvadoran military abuses —
remained in limbo.
By early January, however,
there were reports of high-qual
ity arms in large quantities
reaching the guerrillas, and on
Jan. 10 the left began its con
certed drive to seize power.
On Jan. 17, the State Depart
ment announced its decision to
provide more deadly support to
the Salvadoran government.
According to the official U.S.
statement, the action was taken
because the Salvadoran govern
ment was taking "positivesteps
in the areas of mutual concern."
It mentioned the investigations
of the nuns' killing, the reforms
to redistribute land and wealth,
and efforts to curb repression
and terrorism.
According to U.S. Am
bassador Robert White, how
ever, there has been no progress
toward discovering which, if
any, Salvadoran military or oth

er official personnel were in
volved in the killings.
The absence of any substan
tive investigation into the
murder of the Americans is not
unique in this country where
more than 10,000 people were
killed last year. Despite strong
leads in the case of tne murder
last spring of San Salvador
archbishop Oscar Romero, the
killer has never been found.
The reforms mentioned by
the State Department are only
half, and rather haphazardly,
implemented.
There is little evidence to sug
gest that the Salvadoran gov
ernment has ' controlled the
brutality of some of its troops.
Prisoners are not taken and
guerrillas supposedly killed in
the heat of battle are found tor
tured, raped and burned. At a
press conference last week the
military commander, Jaime
Abdul Gutierrez estimated that
more than 1000 guerrillas had
been killed during the offensive.
If there are positive changes
in the government, they may be
seen in the restructuring last
month that made Christian
Democratic leader Jose
Napoleon Duarte president.
