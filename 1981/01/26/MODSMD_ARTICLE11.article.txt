Seoul, South Korea (AP) â€”
The longest period of martial
law in modern Korean history
came to an end yesterday. Pres
ident Chun Doo-hwan lifted the
military decree in the second
government action this week
that was expected to improve
relations with the United States.
"The foundation for social
stability has been restored."
Chun said in announcing the end
of 15 months of martial law im
posed after the October 1979 as
sassination of President Park
Chung-hee.
There were few outward
signs of change in this capital
city, however, and diplomatic
sources said they expected any
future changes to be gradual.
A midnight to 4 a.m. curfew
still was in effect and will con
tinue, and an appointed legisla
tive assembly already has
passed several measures that
will take the place of some

martial law decrees.
The measures, described as
"safeguards against possible
recurrence of social disorder,"
include a new assembly and
demonstration law. a basic
press law and amendments to
labor laws. Formal press
censorship ended with the ter
mination of martial law, but the
media will remain under close
government control. Chun also
will retain certain "oversight"
powers.
Chun also announced presi
dential elections among author
ized candidates for Feb. 25 and
parliamentary elections to be
held soon after.
Chun, who meets Feb. 2 in
Washington with President
Ronald Reagan, lifted martial
law a day after commuting the
Sept. 17 death sentence of his po
litical arch-rival, dissident
leader Kim Dae-jung.
