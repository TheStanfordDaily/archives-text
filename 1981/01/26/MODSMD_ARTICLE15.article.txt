GRADUATE
STUDIES
COMMITTEE
I am writing to intro
duce the student mem
bers of the Committee on
Graduate Studies. This
Committee (CCS) is re
sponsible for formulating
policy concerning
graduate education at
Stanford, on behalf of the
Academic Council (the
faculty).
Although most author
ity over specific graduate
programs rests with the
various academic de
partments, CCS has re
sponsibility for
University-wide policy
in such areas as graduate
admissions and financial
aid, the creation and
elimination of graduate
degree programs, and the
structure of graduate cur
ricula. It also oversees the
work of the Graduate
Studies office. The
Committee is composed
of eight faculty members
and three students —
Timothy Quey of Busi
ness & Education, Ken
neth Zabriskie of Electri
cal Engineering, and my
self (Economics).
Some of the issues in
which I am particularly
interested are the adequ
acy and availability of fi
nancial support for
graduate students at
Stanford, and the extent
of the involvement or
consultation of graduate
students in decisions
made within the indi
vidual programs (for
example, concerning fa
culty recruitment or
changes in program re
quirements). I am also
concerned with the only
mixed success Stanford
has had recently in re
cruiting women and
minority students, espe
cially outside the profes
sional schools.
Tim is especially in
terested in the develop
ment of interdisciplinary
programs at Stanford,.
The Graduate Specials
sub-committee of CGS, of
which he is a member,
reviews and approves
individual proposals for
interdisciplinary doc
toral programs.
I encourage graduate
students who are in
terested in these or other
issues concerning
graduate education here
at Stanford to contact
Tim (at 494-6259) or Ken
(856-2275) or myself
(329-9940). Any one of us
would be happy to bring
student concerns to the
attention of the Commit
tee. We need to hear from
you in order to work ef
fectively on behalf of
graduate students.

INTERNATIONAL
GRADUATE STUDENTS
As if being a graduate
student isn't tough
enough as it is, being a
graduate student in a
foreign country can only
make things tougher. The
first thing you find out
when you get here is that
spoken American-
English is not quite the
same as you were taught
back in school (even for
those of us from
English-speaking coun
tries!) Then there are
'nickels' and 'dimes' (th
ese don't even have how
much they are worth
written on them) to figure
out. Probably each one of
us could sit down and
think of half a dozen
problems we have had,
simply related to being a
stranger in a strange land
and in particular a
graduate stranger. Hope
fully this is where the
Graduate Student As
sociation steps in.
Since, at the moment,
G.S.A. is undergoing
something of a 'rebirth'
we have a great oppor
tunity to expand its
scope. One suggestion,
since the foreign student
population is such a large
proportion of graduate
students at Stanford, is to
have someone at GSA
specifically responsible
for that group's interests.
The organization already
has good contacts with
the Bechtel International
Center and channels of
communication right up
to the university deans
have been opened. Un
fortunately, in the past
there has been one thing
lacking and that is 'audi
ence participation.' Al
most everybody I know
has had some sort of
problem that an organi
zation like the G.S.A.
could have helped with,
things like:
1) the first few weeks in
this country (orienta
tion etc.)
2) the next few years in
this country!
3) language (G.S.A. could
tell you where to find
help)
4) departmental
5) accommodation
6) social
7) etc.
Many of you reading
this will have had one or
more of these problems
and hopefully have sol
ved them, in which case
you are in an excellent
position to help someone
else who is still struggl
ing with them. All it
needs is for you to offer
your expertise, be it sim
ply by talking to another
foreign student that you
meet in the coffee house

or by coming to a G.S.A.
meeting or event. The
various events you see on
the calendar on this page
are an open invitation to
you to solve several of the
problems I listed; you can
meet other people (out
side of your own depart
ment) or you can even
seek out someone from
the G.S.A. and let them
know what sort of things
you like to see them
doing (anything from re
questing that there be
more parties to finding
out why grad. students
aren't better represented
on departmental deci
sion making commit
tees).
For one final word I
would like to stress that
no matter how many
facilities are available or
how many activities are
arranged they are all
wasted if nobody uses
them. We hope to be
seeing you soon.
STANFORD
FELLOWS
ASSOCIATION
The Stanford Fellows
Association is an organi
zation of Ph.D. students
in Humanities depart
ments which belong to
the The Fellows Prog
ram. The association was
formed in Fall Quarter.
Its aim is to increase the
university stipends of its
member graduate stu
dents. An active cam
paign is now under way
to achieve this aim. A
quest ion-and-answer
session is being planned
for later this quarter with
the appropriate Deans,
Provosts, and other uni
versity officials. We plan
to make use of this ses
sion to find out more
about the budgetary pro
cedures by which
stipends are fixed and to
see if some immediate
improvement of our fi
nancial situation is pos
sible. Please keep an eye
out for notices about this
meeting. The larger the
turnout of graduate stu
dents the more it will be
come evident to the uni
versity administrators
that we are very con
cerned about the level of
our financial support. If
you have any questions
or suggestions you can
give them to the follow
ing departmental rep
resentatives:

WORKSHOPS AT THE
STANFORD
COUNSELING
INSTITUTE
The Stanford Counsel
ing Institute is offering 3
new workshops for
winter quarter. The
workshops are part of
on-going research in the
areas of depression, self
esteem and values
clarification.
The values clarifica
tion workshop, open to
men and women, will
focus on helping par
ticipants to clarify or re
solve values conflicts in
their vocational or per
sonal lives. The self
esteem workshop is for
women only and will
teach skills for increasing
career and general self
esteem. Participants in
the depression work
shop, also open to
women only, will be
taught cognitive and be
havioral coping skills for
dealing with depression.
Dates and times are to
be determined. For more
information about any of
the workshops, call the
Stanford Counseling In
stitute (497-2113). A
message can be left on the
answering machine 24
hours a day. Calls can
also be made to 497-0670
between 9 and 5 on week
days.
BECHTEL
INTERNATIONAL
CENTER
In case you thought
that the I-Center was just
a place where you went
to get registered I thought
I might mention some of
the other things it is use
ful for. Apart from all the
activities like the Film
Series, Cafe, Folk Danc
ing, Language Exchange,
Outings etc. the I-Center
also has a color televi
sion, table tennis and
even a photographic dark
room. Even if none of
the presently arranged
programs are to your
taste and you have some
thing else you would like
to organize (like a
Lithuanian Club or some
such) just give a call to
the I-Center (ask for
Donna Bolster at 497-
1831; she is the coor
dinator and is very
friendly and helpful),
they will even help you
with advertising your
event through their

this will have had one or
more of these problems
and hopefully have sol
ved them, in which case
you are in an excellent
position to help someone
else who is still struggl
ing with them. All it
needs is for you to offer
your expertise, be it sim
ply by talking to another
foreign student that you
meet in the coffee house

or by coming to a G.S.A.
meeting or event. The
various events you see on
the calendar on this page
are an open invitation to
you to solve several of the
problems I listed; you can
meet other people (out
side of your own depart
ment) or you can even
seek out someone from
the G.S.A. and let them
know what sort of things
you like to see them
doing (anything from re
questing that there be
more parties to finding
out why grad. students
aren't better represented
on departmental deci
sion making commit
tees).
For one final word I
would like to stress that
no matter how many
facilities are available or
how many activities are
arranged they are all
wasted if nobody uses
them. We hope to be
seeing you soon.

WORKSHOPS AT THE
STANFORD
COUNSELING
INSTITUTE
The Stanford Counsel
ing Institute is offering 3
new workshops for
winter quarter. The
workshops are part of
on-going research in the
areas of depression, self
esteem and values
clarification.
The values clarifica
tion workshop, open to
men and women, will
focus on helping par
ticipants to clarify or re
solve values conflicts in
their vocational or per
sonal lives. The self
esteem workshop is for
women only and will
teach skills for increasing
career and general self
esteem. Participants in
the depression work
shop, also open to
women only, will be
taught cognitive and be
havioral coping skills for
dealing with depression.
Dates and times are to
be determined. For more
information about any of
the workshops, call the
Stanford Counseling In
stitute (497-2113). A
message can be left on the
answering machine 24
hours a day. Calls can
also be made to 497-0670

GRADUATE
STUDIES
COMMITTEE
I am writing to intro
duce the student mem
bers of the Committee on
Graduate Studies. This
Committee (CCS) is re
sponsible for formulating
policy concerning
graduate education at
Stanford, on behalf of the
Academic Council (the
faculty).
Although most author
ity over specific graduate
programs rests with the
various academic de
partments, CCS has re
sponsibility for
University-wide policy
in such areas as graduate
admissions and financial
aid, the creation and
elimination of graduate
degree programs, and the
structure of graduate cur
ricula. It also oversees the
work of the Graduate
Studies office. The
Committee is composed
of eight faculty members
and three students —
Timothy Quey of Busi
ness & Education, Ken
neth Zabriskie of Electri
cal Engineering, and my
self (Economics).
Some of the issues in
which I am particularly
interested are the adequ
acy and availability of fi
nancial support for
graduate students at
Stanford, and the extent
of the involvement or
consultation of graduate
students in decisions
made within the indi
vidual programs (for
example, concerning fa
culty recruitment or
changes in program re
quirements). I am also
concerned with the only
mixed success Stanford
has had recently in re
cruiting women and
minority students, espe
cially outside the profes
sional schools.
Tim is especially in
terested in the develop
ment of interdisciplinary
programs at Stanford,.
The Graduate Specials
sub-committee of CGS, of
which he is a member,
reviews and approves
individual proposals for
interdisciplinary doc
toral programs.
I encourage graduate
students who are in
terested in these or other
issues concerning
graduate education here
at Stanford to contact
Tim (at 494-6259) or Ken
(856-2275) or myself
(329-9940). Any one of us
would be happy to bring
student concerns to the
attention of the Commit
tee. We need to hear from
you in order to work ef
fectively on behalf of
graduate students.

INTERNATIONAL
GRADUATE STUDENTS
As if being a graduate
student isn't tough
enough as it is, being a
graduate student in a
foreign country can only
make things tougher. The
first thing you find out
when you get here is that
spoken American-
English is not quite the
same as you were taught
back in school (even for
those of us from
English-speaking coun
tries!) Then there are
'nickels' and 'dimes' (th
ese don't even have how
much they are worth
written on them) to figure
out. Probably each one of
us could sit down and
think of half a dozen
problems we have had,
simply related to being a
stranger in a strange land
and in particular a
graduate stranger. Hope
fully this is where the
Graduate Student As
sociation steps in.
Since, at the moment,
G.S.A. is undergoing
something of a 'rebirth'
we have a great oppor
tunity to expand its
scope. One suggestion,
since the foreign student
population is such a large
proportion of graduate
students at Stanford, is to
have someone at GSA
specifically responsible
for that group's interests.
The organization already
has good contacts with
the Bechtel International
Center and channels of
communication right up
to the university deans
have been opened. Un
fortunately, in the past
there has been one thing
lacking and that is 'audi
ence participation.' Al
most everybody I know
has had some sort of
problem that an organi
zation like the G.S.A.
could have helped with,
things like:
1) the first few weeks in
this country (orienta
tion etc.)
2) the next few years in
this country!
3) language (G.S.A. could
tell you where to find
help)
4) departmental
5) accommodation
6) social
7) etc.
Many of you reading

GRADUATE
STUDIES
COMMITTEE
I am writing to intro
duce the student mem
bers of the Committee on
Graduate Studies. This
Committee (CCS) is re
sponsible for formulating
policy concerning
graduate education at
Stanford, on behalf of the
Academic Council (the
faculty).
Although most author
ity over specific graduate
programs rests with the
various academic de
partments, CCS has re
sponsibility for
University-wide policy
in such areas as graduate
admissions and financial
aid, the creation and
elimination of graduate
degree programs, and the
structure of graduate cur
ricula. It also oversees the
work of the Graduate
Studies office. The
Committee is composed
of eight faculty members
and three students —
Timothy Quey of Busi
ness & Education, Ken
neth Zabriskie of Electri
cal Engineering, and my
self (Economics).
Some of the issues in
which I am particularly
interested are the adequ
acy and availability of fi
nancial support for
graduate students at
Stanford, and the extent
of the involvement or
consultation of graduate
students in decisions
made within the indi
vidual programs (for
example, concerning fa
culty recruitment or
changes in program re
quirements). I am also
concerned with the only
mixed success Stanford
has had recently in re
cruiting women and
minority students, espe
cially outside the profes
sional schools.
Tim is especially in
terested in the develop
ment of interdisciplinary
programs at Stanford,.
The Graduate Specials
sub-committee of CGS, of
which he is a member,
reviews and approves
individual proposals for
interdisciplinary doc
toral programs.
I encourage graduate
students who are in
terested in these or other
issues concerning
graduate education here
at Stanford to contact
Tim (at 494-6259) or Ken
(856-2275) or myself
(329-9940). Any one of us
would be happy to bring
student concerns to the
attention of the Commit
tee. We need to hear from
you in order to work ef
fectively on behalf of
graduate students.

INTERNATIONAL
GRADUATE STUDENTS
As if being a graduate
student isn't tough
enough as it is, being a
graduate student in a
foreign country can only
make things tougher. The
first thing you find out
when you get here is that
spoken American-
English is not quite the
same as you were taught
back in school (even for
those of us from
English-speaking coun
tries!) Then there are
'nickels' and 'dimes' (th
ese don't even have how
much they are worth
written on them) to figure
out. Probably each one of
us could sit down and
think of half a dozen
problems we have had,
simply related to being a
stranger in a strange land
and in particular a
graduate stranger. Hope
fully this is where the
Graduate Student As
sociation steps in.
Since, at the moment,
G.S.A. is undergoing
something of a 'rebirth'
we have a great oppor
tunity to expand its
scope. One suggestion,
since the foreign student
population is such a large
proportion of graduate
students at Stanford, is to
have someone at GSA
specifically responsible
for that group's interests.
The organization already
has good contacts with
the Bechtel International
Center and channels of
communication right up
to the university deans
have been opened. Un
fortunately, in the past
there has been one thing
lacking and that is 'audi
ence participation.' Al
most everybody I know
has had some sort of
problem that an organi
zation like the G.S.A.
could have helped with,
things like:
1) the first few weeks in
this country (orienta
tion etc.)
2) the next few years in
this country!
3) language (G.S.A. could
tell you where to find
help)
4) departmental
5) accommodation
6) social
7) etc.
Many of you reading
this will have had one or
more of these problems
and hopefully have sol
ved them, in which case
you are in an excellent
position to help someone
else who is still struggl
ing with them. All it
needs is for you to offer
your expertise, be it sim
ply by talking to another
foreign student that you
meet in the coffee house

or by coming to a G.S.A.
meeting or event. The
various events you see on
the calendar on this page
are an open invitation to
you to solve several of the
problems I listed; you can
meet other people (out
side of your own depart
ment) or you can even
seek out someone from
the G.S.A. and let them
know what sort of things
you like to see them
doing (anything from re
questing that there be
more parties to finding
out why grad. students
aren't better represented
on departmental deci
sion making commit
tees).
For one final word I
would like to stress that
no matter how many
facilities are available or
how many activities are
arranged they are all
wasted if nobody uses
them. We hope to be
seeing you soon.
STANFORD
FELLOWS
ASSOCIATION
The Stanford Fellows
Association is an organi

in Humanities depart
ments which belong to
the The Fellows Prog

formed in Fall Quarter.
Its aim is to increase the
university stipends of its
member graduate stu
dents. An active cam
paign is now under way
to achieve this aim. A
quest ion-and-answer
session is being planned
for later this quarter with
the appropriate Deans,
Provosts, and other uni
versity officials. We plan
to make use of this ses
sion to find out more
about the budgetary pro
cedures by which
stipends are fixed and to
see if some immediate
improvement of our fi
nancial situation is pos
sible. Please keep an eye
out for notices about this
meeting. The larger the
turnout of graduate stu
dents the more it will be
come evident to the uni
versity administrators
that we are very con
cerned about the level of
our financial support. If
you have any questions
or suggestions you can
give them to the follow
ing departmental rep
resentatives:

on-going research in the
areas of depression, self
esteem and values
clarification.
The values clarifica
tion workshop, open to
men and women, will
focus on helping par
ticipants to clarify or re
solve values conflicts in
their vocational or per
sonal lives. The self
esteem workshop is for
women only and will

career and general self
esteem. Participants in
the depression work
shop, also open to
women only, will be
taught cognitive and be
havioral coping skills for
dealing with depression.
Dates and times are to
be determined. For more
information about any of
the workshops, call the
Stanford Counseling In
