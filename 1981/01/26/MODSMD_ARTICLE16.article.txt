## Andy Hartwell Prejudice: a separatist's view 
### 
I was surprised to read the
front page story on the rally in
honor of Martin Luther King
(Daily, Jan 16) and again in
Glen Pullen's letter to the editor
<Daily, Jan. 20) that people
think making a national holiday
of King's birthday would help
with 'the healing of America's
racial wounds."
I don't believe that holidays
focus attention on the person
they are supposed to honor. How
many people focus their atten
tion on the ideals and lives of
Lincoln and Washington during
February, or of Jesus of Naz
areth during December 0 Even
if Martin Luther King's birth
day became a national holiday. I
would imagine that most people
would suspend "business as usu
al"' onlv to focus on themselves.

What can I say of someone
simply because he or she is
black 0 I can say that you have
darker skin than I do, the
chances are somewhat better
that you like disco music and
dancing more than I do. and you
probably use some expressions
in your speech that I don't I can
probably also say that, just like
me. you have been lonely at
some time in your life, that you
know people you really enjoy
being with, that you have felt
uncertain because of some new
situation you have been in. and
that you have activities and in
terests you enjoy and like to talk
about.
Much is made of cultural dif
ferences today, and they do ex
ist. but they are not nearly as
strong as our similarities in

Racists, regardless of color, stand
together in their unwillingness to
go deeper than streotypes to really
get to know a person.

A national holiday offers a ri
diculous solution to a serious
problem Anyone who wants to
deal with racism seriously must
take an honest look at the real
world and at himself or herself
Three aspects of the real world
which are important in con
sidering racism are the dif
ferences which actually exist
between people because of race,
the fact that racism is not lim
ited to whites, and that racism
is not a problem of its own. but is
one outgrowth of a much larger
problem.

being part of mankind. Rela
tionships based on nothing but
skin color, music and speech
patterns can only be superficial,
but our humanity gives anyone
the freedom to have significant
relationships with anyone else if
racism or some other prejudice
does not stand in the way.
Racism among whites is so
well-known that it does not need
to be mentioned here, but ra
cism is not an exclusively white
phenomenon Last year I had
someone tell me that just be

cause I am white my interest in
racial equality is not sincere. He
said that I have to be a part of
the white mentality which de
sires to enslave blacks.
Such a generalization is just
as racist and senseless as if I
had told him that he was inferior
and could never have a job other
than that of a janitor Racists,
regardless of color, stand to
gether in their unwillingness to
go deeper than stereotypes to
really get to know a person for
himself It is more convenient to
maintain a world view based on
"us" and "them" than to con
sider anything which will show
that we are not actually flaw
less and that "they" are not the
only ones who keep our society
from perfection.
In this, racism can honestly
be seen as just one example of
the widespread injustice in our
world. Starvation throughout
the world amidst great wealth,
unfair treatment of individuals
by governments, and cruelty be
tween individuals which occurs
everywhere from kindergartens
to retirement homes are repre
sentative of the widespread in
justice characteristic of our
world.
I wonder why humankind
does not love justice. Most peo
ple are too centered on their
goals for personal achievement
to consider anything else.
Among these few individuals
who care response seldom goes
beyond complaining about a bad
situation. What each individual
must do is find a standard of jus
tice by which to live his or her
life.

I was surprised to read the
front page story on the rally in
honor of Martin Luther King
(Daily, Jan 16) and again in
Glen Pullen's letter to the editor
<Daily, Jan. 20) that people
think making a national holiday
of King's birthday would help
with 'the healing of America's
racial wounds."
I don't believe that holidays
focus attention on the person
they are supposed to honor. How
many people focus their atten
tion on the ideals and lives of
Lincoln and Washington during
February, or of Jesus of Naz
areth during December 0 Even
if Martin Luther King's birth
day became a national holiday. I
would imagine that most people
would suspend "business as usu
al"' onlv to focus on themselves.

What can I say of someone
simply because he or she is
black 0 I can say that you have
darker skin than I do, the
chances are somewhat better
that you like disco music and
dancing more than I do. and you
probably use some expressions
in your speech that I don't I can
probably also say that, just like
me. you have been lonely at
some time in your life, that you
know people you really enjoy
being with, that you have felt
uncertain because of some new
situation you have been in. and
that you have activities and in
terests you enjoy and like to talk
about.
Much is made of cultural dif
ferences today, and they do ex
ist. but they are not nearly as
strong as our similarities in

Racists, regardless of color, stand
together in their unwillingness to
go deeper than streotypes to really
get to know a person.

A national holiday offers a ri
diculous solution to a serious
problem Anyone who wants to
deal with racism seriously must
take an honest look at the real
world and at himself or herself
Three aspects of the real world
which are important in con
sidering racism are the dif
ferences which actually exist
between people because of race,
the fact that racism is not lim
ited to whites, and that racism
is not a problem of its own. but is
one outgrowth of a much larger
problem.

being part of mankind. Rela
tionships based on nothing but
skin color, music and speech
patterns can only be superficial,
but our humanity gives anyone
the freedom to have significant
relationships with anyone else if
racism or some other prejudice
does not stand in the way.
Racism among whites is so
well-known that it does not need
to be mentioned here, but ra
cism is not an exclusively white
phenomenon Last year I had
someone tell me that just be

cause I am white my interest in
racial equality is not sincere. He
said that I have to be a part of
the white mentality which de
sires to enslave blacks.
