## Poverty population's bleak future 
### 
The National Advisory Coun
cil on Economic Opportunitv re
cently issued a report. "Critical
Choices for the '80s," that ad
dressed the problems of un
employment. inflation, job
creation and welfare reform.
The report also discussed the
fate of human needs programs
aimed at alleviating these prob
lems.
Real gains in our efforts to re
duce poverty between 1965 and
1969 were reversed dramati
cally in 1970. In 1975 alone, there
was an increase of 2.5 million
poor, the largest single-year in
crease since 1959. There are now
25 million people living below
the poverty level.
The report also cites a fright
ening shift in the status of the
poverty population that "bod
es ill for the future." Among
these trends are:
— The increasing feminization
of poverty. Almost one out of
three female-headed house
holds is poor; about one in 18
headed by a man is poor. At the
present rate, the council states,
"the poverty population would
be composed solely of women
and their children by the year
2000."
— Growth in poverty among the
very young. The rate of poverty

among children under 18 has
risen 14 percent in 10 years.
More than one in four Hispanic
children and more than two in
five black children live in pover
ty situations today.
— Growing poverty among ra
cial minorities. In 1967. the rate
of poverty among black family
heads was about 3 l 2 times that
of whites: by 1977. it had
reached four times that of the
white population
— Geographical changes. The
rate of poverty has risen in the
North and West while falling in
the South The greatest in
creases in poverty rates were,
as expected, among central-city
minorities.
— The elderly are in trouble.
They account for much of the
decrease in official poverty
rates during the 70s — largely
due to greater social security
benefits — but most of the elder
ly who have "moved out" of
poverty merelv moved from a
few hundred dollars below the
poverty level to a few hundred
dollars above it.
The council's evaluation of
the unemployment situation re
vealed similar problems and
troublesome trends. The group
reviewed the social costs of re

cession. inflation and energy
costs that have characterized
much of the '70s. It found in
creasing numbers of the un
employed were not nearly as
well protected by unemploy
ment insurance and other in
come-support programs as had
been generally thought.
In releasing the council's re
port. Chair Arthur Blaustein
said: "New conservatives and
libertarians who have gained
national recognition bv attack
ing government efforts to help
the poor should have the honesty
to admit that any proposed cuts
in the human services budget
will undo the progress of the
past 15 years and tumble mil
lions of Americans back below
the poverty line."
♦ ♦ *
By concentrating on descrip
tions of trends without propo
sing solutions, the council falls
far short of its intended task.
Conservatives who maintain
that throwing money at Drob
lems is no solution vet believe
that the way to mend the econo
my is to give big business tax
cuts have been going on the
wrong track now for years.
Strangely enough. Ronald Rea
gan campaigned on a slogan.
"Let's get America working

again," but his economic pro
posals will raise unemployment
and government spending in or
der to alleviate its costs.
One place to begin anew
would be in the realization of a
concept increasingly supported
by strong evidence, one tnat will
appeal to everyone. It costs less
to maintain a full-emplovment
economy than it does to main
tain the costs of unemployment.

The National Advisory Coun
cil on Economic Opportunitv re
cently issued a report. "Critical
Choices for the '80s," that ad
dressed the problems of un
employment. inflation, job
creation and welfare reform.
The report also discussed the
fate of human needs programs
aimed at alleviating these prob
lems.
Real gains in our efforts to re
duce poverty between 1965 and
1969 were reversed dramati
cally in 1970. In 1975 alone, there
was an increase of 2.5 million
poor, the largest single-year in
crease since 1959. There are now
25 million people living below
the poverty level.
The report also cites a fright
ening shift in the status of the
poverty population that "bod
es ill for the future." Among
these trends are:
— The increasing feminization
of poverty. Almost one out of
three female-headed house
holds is poor; about one in 18
headed by a man is poor. At the
present rate, the council states,
"the poverty population would
be composed solely of women
and their children by the year
2000."
— Growth in poverty among the
very young. The rate of poverty

among children under 18 has
risen 14 percent in 10 years.
More than one in four Hispanic
children and more than two in
five black children live in pover
ty situations today.
— Growing poverty among ra
cial minorities. In 1967. the rate
of poverty among black family
heads was about 3 l 2 times that
of whites: by 1977. it had
reached four times that of the
white population
— Geographical changes. The
rate of poverty has risen in the
North and West while falling in
the South The greatest in
creases in poverty rates were,
as expected, among central-city
minorities.
— The elderly are in trouble.
They account for much of the
decrease in official poverty
rates during the 70s — largely
due to greater social security
benefits — but most of the elder
ly who have "moved out" of
poverty merelv moved from a
few hundred dollars below the
poverty level to a few hundred
dollars above it.
The council's evaluation of
the unemployment situation re
vealed similar problems and
troublesome trends. The group
reviewed the social costs of re

cession. inflation and energy
costs that have characterized
much of the '70s. It found in
creasing numbers of the un
employed were not nearly as
well protected by unemploy
ment insurance and other in
come-support programs as had
been generally thought.
In releasing the council's re
port. Chair Arthur Blaustein
said: "New conservatives and
libertarians who have gained
national recognition bv attack
ing government efforts to help
the poor should have the honesty
to admit that any proposed cuts
in the human services budget
will undo the progress of the
past 15 years and tumble mil
lions of Americans back below
the poverty line."
♦ ♦ *
By concentrating on descrip
tions of trends without propo
sing solutions, the council falls
far short of its intended task.
Conservatives who maintain
that throwing money at Drob
lems is no solution vet believe
that the way to mend the econo
my is to give big business tax
cuts have been going on the
wrong track now for years.
Strangely enough. Ronald Rea
gan campaigned on a slogan.
"Let's get America working

again," but his economic pro
posals will raise unemployment
and government spending in or
der to alleviate its costs.
One place to begin anew
would be in the realization of a
concept increasingly supported
by strong evidence, one tnat will
appeal to everyone. It costs less
to maintain a full-emplovment
economy than it does to main
tain the costs of unemployment.
