Red Hawks cheer
The new Stanford mascot
should be a local bird or animal,
and not yet appropriated by oth
er neighboring schools. There
are many red tailed hawks circl
ing over the campus, especially
in the hills to the West. These
are brave and fascinating birds.
They make a worthy mascot. So
how about three cheers for the
Stanford Red Hawks? Sounds
good to me.

I invite Philip Chalk to pres
ent the evidence leading him to
portray the ex-hostages as being
greedily anxious to profit from
their ordeal after less than three
days in Wiesbaden.
There may be such senti
ments among publishers or
hostage family members, but to
depict the ex-hostages them
selves running off a plane, man
uscripts in hand, is premature,
in poor taste and unfounded.
Chalk should be able to employ
his artistic talents without let
ting his cynical imagination
create fantasized controversy.

I would like to thank the De
partment of Athletics for keep
ing the DeGuerre pool facility
open for recreational swimming
during the winter break. I also
look forward to being able to
swim there on weekends during
the winter quarter. This is a fan
tastic privilege in my view and a
benefit I highly appreciate as a
Stanford employee. Swimming
has become my primary "condi
tioning" exercise and I know
from talking with other "regu
lar patrons" of DeGuerre that
we all owe a big debt of grat
itude to the Athletic Depart
ment for keeping the pool com
plex available for recreational
swimming and conditionii g.
