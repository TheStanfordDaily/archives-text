# Negotiations continue
## More KZSU changes planned 
### Samuel Howe 
A revised constitution and a board
of directors are what the University's
student-run radio station KZSU need
to deal with Its internal problems that
led to a two-week shutdown in Septem
ber.
On that point both University of
ficials in the Office of Student Ac
tivities and students who work at the
station agree; but disputes over the
composition and powers of such a
board have delayed negotiations be
tween the two groups this school year.
Since the shutdown the station has
had a less than continuous operating
schedule.
According to KZSU station man
ager Marty Malecki, he and former
manager Mike DiMartino had begun
revising the constitution as early as
last May to resolve "problems" in
herent in the fact that although KZSU
is operated by students, the Univer
sity holds its license and can de
termine station policy.
Assault
One night in late August, a student
working at the station was assaulted
by two non-students who were ap
parently friends off a non-student disc
jockey. The incident triggered the
shutdown. The shutdown gave KZSU
time to revise security procedures and
to perform some engineering work. In
consultation with Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons, a strict policy was
implemented which prohibits non-stu
dents from working at the station
without going through an approval
process; also, once the station re
sumed operation, it did so on a reduced
16 hour-per-day basis. Lyons has since
extended that time to 18 hours, from 7
a.m. to 1 a.m.
The non-student policy and the oper
ating hours are two issues which
KZSU would like to address as soon as
possible, according to Malecki.
The station operated on a 24 hour
per-dav system in the past and also re
lied partially on persons from outside
Stanford to serve as disc jockeys and
perform technical work.
Malecki says it is "good to have non
students around for the expertise they
have acquired over the years" and be
cause "some slots are really tough to
fill," particularly in the morning
hours. Non-students have tradi
tionally been more able to fill these
spots than students registered here, he
said.
Thus, while the restriction "com
promises our flexibility." in Malecki's
words. Lyons and Director of Student
Activities Thom Massey have con
tended that the presence of non-stu
dents led to the assault in August,
which required then-sports director
Steve Sherman to receive hospital
care for facial contusions
Lyons said yesterday he was "quite
willing" to appoint non-students if
they go through a formal process
whereby they are nominated by the
station, approved by the Council of
Presidents and then appointed for a
specified period of time. However.
Malecki responded that out of four
people nominated in this way so far.
only one has been approved by Lyons
Lyons also said that he would be

"open" to proposals from the KZSU
staff to resume a 24-hour schedule, but
that "they haven't asked me."
Malecki said yesterday that "we very
much approached film With that" at
the end of fall quarter because KZSU
has some 15 disc jockeys-in-training
who completed a class in the fall and
now need the traditional "burn-out"
slots, between midnight and 8 a.m., to
begin broadcasting. Malecki said that
Lyons responded by allowing the sta
tion the two additional hours of operat
ing time.
Malecki said the 24-hour schedule,
which program director Mike
Moroney described as giving KZSU "a
certain amount of pride." is also im
portant because KZSU is designated
as an emergency broadcasting prima
ry station to which federal officials
may direct listeners for information
in the event of an emergency. "It's
nice to think nothing goes wrong in the
middle of the night, but if it did, we
wouldn't be here." said Malecki.
Lyons said that the station officers
must prove they can handle the obliga
tions of a continuous schedule, but
said that he doubts that KZSU has "the
leadership and the capability" now to
do so. He cited the fact that the station
had decided to close over the Christ
mas break, in the process depriving
listeners other than Stanford students

in the Bay Area from regular KZSU
features and.he charged, breaking a
"contractual agreement" with the
Palo Alto citv council to cover their
weekly meetings.
Malecki said that the station closed
down over Christmas because "we did
not have the people to (operate) dur
ing the break. Rather than run on a
shoddy, hit-and-miss schedule, we de
cided it would be more responsible to
close down altogether."
What underlies all the issues in the
KZSU story is, apparently, the fear of
those who work at the station of how
much control the University might ul
timately exert over the station.
"There are potential problems â€”
KZSU is student-run. so we don't want
. . . the University telling us what to
broadcast."
What's involved here, Malecki said,
is the University's basic concern
about the "image" projected by the
station, since Stanford's Board of
Trustees do legally hold the license.
He said that although most listeners
tend to tune in for the music the sta
tion plays, the University would like to
see more news and public affairs to
fulfill its role as an "educational sta
tion." which is its classification under
federal regulations.
Lyons said that he had "no opin
ions" about how much music the sta
tion should play, but that "all I want is
their opinions to be tested agaisnt
some collective group."
The group to which he refers is a
board of directors for the station, but
the makeup of that board apparently
cannot be agreed on among KZSU of
ficers and Massey and Lyons. Student
Activities would like to see more fac
ulty and at-large student members
while KZSU would like to include
more station staff, according to
Malecki. Also at issue is whether all
members of the board, such as the sta
tion's manager, should be entitled to
vote.
It is not clear when the guidelines
for a board wil be finished, although
Massey said he is working with KZSU
and hopes to have all the details
agreed on by the end of the week.
Lyons said that KZSU officers had not
finished the guidelines, and this time,
Malecki agreed by saying, "If his idea
is to agree with everything they
(Lyons and Massey) propose, then
thev have not been finished."
Decisions about operation and long
range goals of the station have tradi
tionally been made by a vote of the en
tire radio staff, but such control will
ultimatley be shifted to this board of
directors, which is intended to repre
sent all segments of the University.
