## Sexist language has roots in narrow minds 
### 
What a good education can do
for you!
Freshman John David
Halamka. benefitting from his
indoctrination into Western Cul
ture. has found inspiration in his
encounter with the past for
critical conjecture in the pres
ent.
In his column (Daily, Jan. 20),
Halamka chides "feminists"
who wish to modify the tradi
tionally sexist language of the
past. Citing what reads like the
first and second quarter reading
list of the Western Culture pro
gram. Halamka illustrates that
women have been traditionally
described as "inferior and sub
ordinate childbearers." He
asks, "So why should we deny
history?" Do we modify the
"traditions and history of the
past" simply because "present
dav norms are changing?"
Leave the sexist language and

traditions of the past alone,
cries Halamka; if men see that
women have been traditionally
subjugated in the past then they
will be more receptive to the
wants and desires of women to
day.
Ah' What subtly intricate re
verse psychology! By pres
enting an omnipotent model of
one behavior Halamka intends
to provoke the extreme opposite
response. He must intend to
sound some subliminally pain
ful ultrasonic beam at all
readers of male dominated his
tory written in male dominated
language.

What Halamka has actually
hit upon is a key argument in
support of an equalizing of the
language. Women seek to, need
to. provide women-to-be with a
history, a heritage of their own,
akin to the one of male ex
cellence of which Halamka is so
proud and defensive.
Denying to a female child a
female focal point in the lan
guage of history and creativity
is not so trivial a barrier to the
development of her self esteem.

The Bible is written about a
male super-being, God, and
about the way for men to live, to
serve, to win favor. A female is
denied this focal point, prays to
the "God of our fathers." She
speaks of the adults around her
as the mailman, the fireman,
the policeman and is denied a
place of power in our language.
She grows up. goes to Stanford,
reads Shakespeare. Aristotle,
Plato and Aquinas and is denied
her place as a creator of liter
ature and history.
And the men to be, they too
are reading and speaking in the
talk of men. They are rewarded

Women grow up, go to Stanford,
read Shakespeare, Aristotle, Plato
and A quinas and are denied their
places as creators of literature and
history.

with a focal point, they may see
reinforcement for the denial of
female being.
"Women think back through
their mothers." This is a con
cept of Virginia Woolf's to
which was introduced in Diane
Middlebrook's class on wom
en's writing, a class I took
partially to counteract the inun
dation of men's excellence
which is the makeup of the
Western Culture program.
Women think back through their
mothers, and if their mothers

are nowhere to be seen in his
tory and literature, then women
essentially have neither history
nor literature. So it would seem
to the female child who reads
onlv of "he" or "him" or the ex
cellence of men. even though
woman now ekes out her place
in history and literature.
This is not to equate the
absence of neuter speech in our
language of the past with the
absence of a focus on female ex
cellence in the past. However,
language is a forceful tool which
will cull impressions through
the most subtle of intonations.
An absolute absence of "female
words" has a stronger impact
on a child's self-impression than
one might think.
"Language and history are
personal matters." Halamka in
sists. Presumably he is claim
ing his right to link words such
as "inferior and subordinate"
with childbearers as well as to
quote Aristotle. . . . "Only the
noblest of men reaches the
golden mean " Halamka claims
his right to read the great men
of the past on the great men of
the past. He claims the right to
continue to produce statements
about the noolest of itien rather
than the noblest of all men and
women.
In my view, he claims the
right to perpetuate inequality
through language and history.
This is a right: it is the right of
the narrow minded to continue
his narrow mindedness.
I'd not dare to violate that
right.

quote Aristotle. . . . "Only the
noblest of men reaches the
golden mean " Halamka claims
his right to read the great men
of the past on the great men of
the past. He claims the right to
continue to produce statements
about the noolest of itien rather
than the noblest of all men and
women.
In my view, he claims the
right to perpetuate inequality
through language and history.
This is a right: it is the right of
the narrow minded to continue
his narrow mindedness.
I'd not dare to violate that
right.

What a good education can do
for you!
Freshman John David
Halamka. benefitting from his
indoctrination into Western Cul
ture. has found inspiration in his
encounter with the past for
critical conjecture in the pres
ent.
In his column (Daily, Jan. 20),
Halamka chides "feminists"
who wish to modify the tradi
tionally sexist language of the
past. Citing what reads like the
first and second quarter reading
list of the Western Culture pro
gram. Halamka illustrates that
women have been traditionally
described as "inferior and sub
ordinate childbearers." He
asks, "So why should we deny
history?" Do we modify the
"traditions and history of the
past" simply because "present
dav norms are changing?"
Leave the sexist language and

traditions of the past alone,
cries Halamka; if men see that
women have been traditionally
subjugated in the past then they
will be more receptive to the
wants and desires of women to
day.
Ah' What subtly intricate re
verse psychology! By pres
enting an omnipotent model of
one behavior Halamka intends
to provoke the extreme opposite
response. He must intend to
sound some subliminally pain
ful ultrasonic beam at all
readers of male dominated his
tory written in male dominated
language.

What Halamka has actually
hit upon is a key argument in
support of an equalizing of the
language. Women seek to, need
to. provide women-to-be with a
history, a heritage of their own,
akin to the one of male ex
cellence of which Halamka is so
proud and defensive.
Denying to a female child a
female focal point in the lan
guage of history and creativity
is not so trivial a barrier to the
development of her self esteem.

The Bible is written about a
male super-being, God, and
about the way for men to live, to
serve, to win favor. A female is
denied this focal point, prays to
the "God of our fathers." She
speaks of the adults around her
as the mailman, the fireman,
the policeman and is denied a
place of power in our language.
She grows up. goes to Stanford,
reads Shakespeare. Aristotle,
Plato and Aquinas and is denied
her place as a creator of liter
ature and history.
And the men to be, they too
are reading and speaking in the
talk of men. They are rewarded

Women grow up, go to Stanford,
read Shakespeare, Aristotle, Plato
and A quinas and are denied their
places as creators of literature and
history.

with a focal point, they may see
reinforcement for the denial of
female being.
"Women think back through
their mothers." This is a con
cept of Virginia Woolf's to
which was introduced in Diane
Middlebrook's class on wom
en's writing, a class I took
partially to counteract the inun
dation of men's excellence
which is the makeup of the
Western Culture program.
Women think back through their
mothers, and if their mothers

are nowhere to be seen in his
tory and literature, then women
essentially have neither history
nor literature. So it would seem
to the female child who reads
onlv of "he" or "him" or the ex
cellence of men. even though
woman now ekes out her place
in history and literature.
This is not to equate the
absence of neuter speech in our
language of the past with the
absence of a focus on female ex
cellence in the past. However,
language is a forceful tool which
will cull impressions through
the most subtle of intonations.
An absolute absence of "female
words" has a stronger impact
on a child's self-impression than
one might think.
"Language and history are
personal matters." Halamka in
sists. Presumably he is claim
ing his right to link words such
as "inferior and subordinate"
with childbearers as well as to
quote Aristotle. . . . "Only the
noblest of men reaches the
