## El Salvador another tactical deception? 
### 
My critics arraign me on nu
merous counts. I stand accused
of "tendentious logic" (Daily,
Jan. 16). in pointing out that
communists use camouflage
tactics. I supposedly assume
that any flicker of anti-Ameri
canism derives from the
"Monolithic Communist Con
spiracy."
I mistakenly believe that El
Salvador will follow the Eastern
European pattern. I err in as

suming that Marxist-Leninist
revolutions are necessarily ob
jectionable when they supplant
corrupt right-wing govern
ments. I am steeped in para
noia. I use the "dusty rhetoric"
of what used to be called "Red
baiting"; I suffer from "super
annuated simplicity"; I con
dense history into the "tidy and
reassuring formulae of Man
ichean McCarthyism." And so
on!
As a matter of fact I am quite
well schooled in communist doc
trine. I can read Marx,
Gramsci, Castro and Marchais
in their respective original lan
guages. I am acquainted with
the fact that communists differ
among themselves. Robert
Blecker and Craig Richards
seem to have been somewhat in
attentive in reading my article.
Otherwise they would not have
assumed that I believe in the ex
istence of a "monolithic Com
munist conspiracy" — their
phrase, not mine. I am, how
ever. right in pointing out that
communists of all persuasions
use camouflage tactics. I trust
that Cerry Katz will draw his
students' attention to the Marx
ist-Leninist classics that deal
with the subject.
A vintage example of tactical
deception is the Paris Agree
ment that ostensibly estab
lished peace in Vietnam. The
signatories agreed, among oth
er things, to ensure freedom of
speech, freedom of the press,
freedom of assembly, freedom
of movement, freedom of or
ganization, freedom of political
activity, freedom of belief, free
dom of residence, freedom of
work, and — believe it or not —
the "right to property own
ership." and the "right to
private enterprise." Have these
freedoms been established? Ask
the boat people!
I do not consider that any anti-
American movement is neces
sarily communist-dominated.
But it is a fact of history that
communists have invariably
come to power through coali
tions (or fronts) with other
movements which are then dis

carded in the hour of victory.
Communists have followed this
strategy, outlined in detail by
Lenin, from the early days of
the Russian Revolution when
the Bolsheviks liquidated their
Menshevik and Social Revolu
tionary allies after these had
served their turn.
Anne Lisac's beliefs notwith
standing. right-wing author
itarian regimes arc preferable
to communist regimes — and
not just from the standpoint of
the rich. A communist party re
gime attempts to control every
aspect of life. Art. philosophy,
science, religion — nothing is
exempt from the party's in
terference. The "New Class" of
functionaries and ideologues
have far-reaching aims; they
seek not merely a monopoly of
control over the means of coer
cion and the means of prod
uction ; they wish to create noth
ing less than the "New Man."
This aim can only be achieved
through the total manipulation
of man. No right-wing military
regime makes such claims —
even though the colonels may
put their hands into the public
till.
More importantly, no right
wing military dictatorship has
ever practiced mass liquida
tions of the kind practiced in
communist countries as diverse
as Russia, China, Vietnam and
Cambodia. The cruelties of
Metaxas paled before those of
Stalin. As regards the living

standards of the poor, no East
German, no Pole, no Czech, no
Latvian nowadays believes that
communism in Eastern Europe
has been more successful in
combating poverty in Eastern
Europe than capitalism has
been in Western Europe. No
worker leaves the free en
terprise economies of Singapore
or Hong Kong to find greater
prosperity under communism in
Shanghai or Canton The trend
of migration is invariably from
communist to capitalist coun
tries.
No communist regime,
moreover, has ever changed to a
constitutional or moderate form
of government, either through
revolution or reform. But a
number of right-wing dic
tatorships have turned into con
stitutional governments —
Spain "and Portugal, for in
stance.
I should like to conclude on a
personal note. I should like to
draw your readers' attention to
my avoidance of ad hominem
arguments. I try to conduct pub
lic debates in a courteous
manner. My approach con
trasts with the self-righteous,
strident, and sometimes
abusive manner that my
censors often choose to adopt. I
trust that they will learn the
wisdom embodied in the Roman
tag suaviter in modo, fortiter in
re.

ganization, freedom of political
activity, freedom of belief, free
dom of residence, freedom of
work, and — believe it or not —
the "right to property own
ership." and the "right to
private enterprise." Have these
freedoms been established? Ask
the boat people!
I do not consider that any anti-
American movement is neces
sarily communist-dominated.
But it is a fact of history that
communists have invariably
come to power through coali
tions (or fronts) with other
movements which are then dis

carded in the hour of victory.
Communists have followed this
strategy, outlined in detail by
Lenin, from the early days of
the Russian Revolution when
the Bolsheviks liquidated their
Menshevik and Social Revolu
tionary allies after these had
served their turn.
Anne Lisac's beliefs notwith
standing. right-wing author
itarian regimes arc preferable
to communist regimes — and
not just from the standpoint of
the rich. A communist party re
gime attempts to control every
aspect of life. Art. philosophy,
science, religion — nothing is
exempt from the party's in
terference. The "New Class" of
functionaries and ideologues
have far-reaching aims; they
seek not merely a monopoly of
control over the means of coer
cion and the means of prod
uction ; they wish to create noth
ing less than the "New Man."
This aim can only be achieved
through the total manipulation
of man. No right-wing military
regime makes such claims —
even though the colonels may
put their hands into the public
till.
More importantly, no right
wing military dictatorship has
ever practiced mass liquida
tions of the kind practiced in
communist countries as diverse
as Russia, China, Vietnam and
Cambodia. The cruelties of
Metaxas paled before those of
Stalin. As regards the living

standards of the poor, no East
German, no Pole, no Czech, no
Latvian nowadays believes that
communism in Eastern Europe
has been more successful in
combating poverty in Eastern
Europe than capitalism has
been in Western Europe. No
worker leaves the free en
terprise economies of Singapore
or Hong Kong to find greater
prosperity under communism in
Shanghai or Canton The trend
of migration is invariably from
communist to capitalist coun
tries.
No communist regime,
moreover, has ever changed to a
constitutional or moderate form
of government, either through
revolution or reform. But a
number of right-wing dic
tatorships have turned into con
stitutional governments —
Spain "and Portugal, for in
stance.
I should like to conclude on a
personal note. I should like to
draw your readers' attention to
my avoidance of ad hominem
arguments. I try to conduct pub
lic debates in a courteous
manner. My approach con
trasts with the self-righteous,
strident, and sometimes
abusive manner that my
censors often choose to adopt. I
trust that they will learn the
wisdom embodied in the Roman
tag suaviter in modo, fortiter in
re.

My critics arraign me on nu
merous counts. I stand accused
of "tendentious logic" (Daily,
Jan. 16). in pointing out that
communists use camouflage
tactics. I supposedly assume
that any flicker of anti-Ameri
canism derives from the
"Monolithic Communist Con
spiracy."
I mistakenly believe that El
Salvador will follow the Eastern
European pattern. I err in as

suming that Marxist-Leninist
revolutions are necessarily ob
jectionable when they supplant
corrupt right-wing govern
ments. I am steeped in para
noia. I use the "dusty rhetoric"
of what used to be called "Red
baiting"; I suffer from "super
annuated simplicity"; I con
dense history into the "tidy and
reassuring formulae of Man
ichean McCarthyism." And so
on!
As a matter of fact I am quite
well schooled in communist doc
trine. I can read Marx,
Gramsci, Castro and Marchais
in their respective original lan
guages. I am acquainted with
the fact that communists differ
among themselves. Robert
Blecker and Craig Richards
seem to have been somewhat in
attentive in reading my article.
Otherwise they would not have
assumed that I believe in the ex
istence of a "monolithic Com
munist conspiracy" — their
phrase, not mine. I am, how
ever. right in pointing out that
communists of all persuasions
use camouflage tactics. I trust
that Cerry Katz will draw his
students' attention to the Marx
ist-Leninist classics that deal
with the subject.
A vintage example of tactical
deception is the Paris Agree
ment that ostensibly estab
lished peace in Vietnam. The
signatories agreed, among oth
er things, to ensure freedom of
speech, freedom of the press,
freedom of assembly, freedom
of movement, freedom of or
ganization, freedom of political
activity, freedom of belief, free
dom of residence, freedom of
work, and — believe it or not —
the "right to property own

private enterprise." Have these
