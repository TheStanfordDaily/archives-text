# To reunite party after defeat
## Manatt favored for Demo chair 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Democratic
state chairmen interviewed the
four candidates for the chair
manship of the Democratic Na
tional Committee Friday, amid
further indications that Los An
geles lawyer Charles Manatt is
the frontrunner for the job.
Manatt told reporters after
the session that he felt sure of
140 of the 179 votes needed for
election when the national com
mittee meets on Feb. 27 to pick
a successor to retiring chair
man John White. A key backer"
of one of Manatt's rivals said,
"Unless somebody really puts
something together within the
next week. I think Chuck will
have it."
Interviews with state
chairmen showed support for
Manatt not only in his own
western region but in such key
states as Michigan and Pennsyl
vania. New York National Coin
mitteeman Patrick Cun
ningham has backing in Ohio
and parts of the South, but is
hampered by the presence in the
race of a home-state rival,
Joseph Crangle. Cunningham
and Crangle are both former
state chairmen, but they come
from opposite ends of the state
— the Bronx and Buffalo, re
spectively — and often have
been at odds.
The fourth man in the race,
Kansas City businessman and
Missouri national commit

teeman Charles Curry, is less
well-known nationally than any
of his rivals.
Manatt. who has been the
chairman of the party's national
finance council, has built a
broad coalition of support,
largely on his record as a fund
raiser. But at Friday's session,
he chose to present himself also
as an eager critic of President
Ronald Reagan.

Manatt. who was California
Democratic chairman during
part of Reagan's tenure as gov
ernor. said "there can be no hon
eymoon era for Ronald Reagan
Republicanism." because the
new president's announced
plans for budget cuts threaten
workers, the elderly, children
and the poor.
Decrying the inaugural spec
tacle of "$lO,OOO dresses and
minks." Manatt said his goal
would be to "rebuild the Demo
cratic organization from the
grassroots up" in order to rep
resent "ordinary working peo
ple."
Curry, Cunningham and
Crangle all passed up the anti-
Reagan rhetoric and concen
trated on outlining their plans
for fund-raising and organiza
tion work. F.xcept for Crangle,
all of the candidates for the
chairmanship said they would
support changes in the party's

delegate-selection rules aimed
at increasing the role and in
fluence of elected officials and
party leaders. Asserting that
the rules changes were "not the
cause of any Democrat losing
the presidency." Crangle said.
"I would hate to see us go back
on these reforms."
Nomination contest
Crangle was the only one of
the four to support Sen. Edward
Kennedy's challenge to Presi
dent .Jimmy Carter's renomina
tion in 1980 and was the most out
spoken Friday in his criticism of
outgoing chairman White for ac
tively backing Carter in the in
tra-partv conflict.
But all of the aspirants prom
ised neutrality in the 1984 nomi
nation contest. Kennedy,
former Vice President Walter
Mondale. Speaker of the House
Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) and
AFL-CIO president Lane
Kirkland have been conferring
in hopes of finding a consensus
candidate for the party chair
manship and avoiding any "pre
presidential" politics in the
choice.
While none of the four has in
dicated publicly his support for
any contender, a Democratic of
ficial close to their discussions
said, "If they didn't want
Manatt, they probably would
have moved to block him by
now. because that's who they're
likely to get if they do nothing."

mitteeman Patrick Cun
ningham has backing in Ohio
and parts of the South, but is
hampered by the presence in the
race of a home-state rival,
Joseph Crangle. Cunningham
and Crangle are both former
state chairmen, but they come
from opposite ends of the state
— the Bronx and Buffalo, re
spectively — and often have
been at odds.
The fourth man in the race,
Kansas City businessman and
Missouri national commit

teeman Charles Curry, is less
well-known nationally than any
of his rivals.
Manatt. who has been the
chairman of the party's national
finance council, has built a
broad coalition of support,
largely on his record as a fund
raiser. But at Friday's session,
he chose to present himself also
as an eager critic of President
Ronald Reagan.
Rebuild party
Manatt. who was California
Democratic chairman during
part of Reagan's tenure as gov
ernor. said "there can be no hon
eymoon era for Ronald Reagan
Republicanism." because the
new president's announced
plans for budget cuts threaten
workers, the elderly, children
and the poor.
Decrying the inaugural spec
tacle of "$lO,OOO dresses and
minks." Manatt said his goal
would be to "rebuild the Demo
cratic organization from the
grassroots up" in order to rep
resent "ordinary working peo
ple."
Curry, Cunningham and
Crangle all passed up the anti-
Reagan rhetoric and concen
trated on outlining their plans
for fund-raising and organiza
tion work. F.xcept for Crangle,
all of the candidates for the
chairmanship said they would
support changes in the party's

delegate-selection rules aimed
at increasing the role and in
fluence of elected officials and
party leaders. Asserting that
the rules changes were "not the
cause of any Democrat losing
the presidency." Crangle said.
"I would hate to see us go back
on these reforms."
Nomination contest
Crangle was the only one of
the four to support Sen. Edward
Kennedy's challenge to Presi
dent .Jimmy Carter's renomina
tion in 1980 and was the most out
spoken Friday in his criticism of
outgoing chairman White for ac
tively backing Carter in the in
tra-partv conflict.
But all of the aspirants prom
ised neutrality in the 1984 nomi
nation contest. Kennedy,
former Vice President Walter
Mondale. Speaker of the House
Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) and
AFL-CIO president Lane
Kirkland have been conferring
in hopes of finding a consensus
candidate for the party chair
manship and avoiding any "pre
presidential" politics in the
choice.
While none of the four has in
dicated publicly his support for
any contender, a Democratic of
ficial close to their discussions
said, "If they didn't want
Manatt, they probably would
have moved to block him by
now. because that's who they're
likely to get if they do nothing."
