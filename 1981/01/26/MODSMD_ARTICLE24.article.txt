Washington (AP) — Presi
dent Ronald Reagan will head
into his first full week on the job
with only four of his Cabinet
level appointees lacking Senate
confirmation.
The Senate worked late into
the night Thursday to confirm
eight new Cabinet members, in
cluding James Watt as interior
secretary. Five appointees had
been confirmed earlier in the
week.
The action on Watt's nomi
nation was notable because it
consumed three hours of Senate
debate and wound up drawing 12
"nay" votes — twice the
number who opposed any other
Reagan nominee.
Sen. Edward Kennedy ID-
Mass.) said he was voting
against the Denver lawyer be
cause of his "long history of ad
vocacy for special interests
against the public interest" as a

member of a legal foundation
which frequently fought In
terior Department regulations.
Sen. Robert Kasten (R-Wis.)
said he was convinced Watt
"will moderate his views and
will strike an acceptable bal
ance between environmental
concerns and the use of the na
tion's public lands for the bene
fit of all citizens."
Also confirmed Thursday:
— William French Smith as at
torney general, by a vote of 96-1.
with Sen. William Proxmire (D-
Wis.) the only dissenter.
— .John Block as secretary of ag
riculture, 98-0.
— Malcolm Baldrige as com
merce secretary. 97-1. with
Proxmire voting against.
— Samuel Pierce as secretary
of housing and urban develop
ment. 98-0.
— Andrew Lewis as secretary of
transportation, 98-0.

— James Edwards as secretary
of energy. 93-3. Nay votes were
cast by Proxmire. Kennedy and
Christopher Dodd (D-Conn).
— Terrel Bell as secretary of
education. 90-2. Negative votes
were casts by Proxmire and
Sen Dennis DeConcini <D-
Ariz).
The Senate has" postponed un
til tomorrow consideration of
three other appointees with
Cabinet rank: David Stockman
as director of the Office of Man
agement and Budget. William
Casey as CIA director and Jeane
Kirkpatrick as United Nations
ambassador.
Labor Secretary-designate
Raymond Donovan is still
awaiting committee approval,
pending completion of an FBI
investigation into allegations
his New Jersey construction
firm made illicit payoffs to
ensure labor peace.
