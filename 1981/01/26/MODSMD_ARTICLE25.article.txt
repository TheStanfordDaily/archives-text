below those limits, the study
says. But nearly 75 million
Americans will live in areas not

quality improvements have
been made in the last decade,
but cautioned that unless auto
emission standards are main
tained and improved for light
and heavy-duty trucks, some
areas now in compliance will
once again fall below air quality
standards.
The report adds that in four
major urban areas — Boston.
Houston. Los Angeles and New

York — "the problem ap
pears to be intractable and no
reasonable effort" is likely to
bring them into compliance
with the standard
