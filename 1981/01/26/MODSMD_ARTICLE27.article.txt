# Pride, poise & Plunkett win Super Bowl for Raiders
## 
### Washington Post 
New Orleans — Jim Plunkett
came all the way back last
night, from the apparent end of
an unspectacular career to
selection as the most valuable
player of Super Bowl XV and the
hero of what owner A 1 Davis
called "the Oakland Raiders'
finest hour."
Plunkett, who sat out the 1978
season and didn't start until the
sixth week of this year's sched
ule, was magnificent. He picked
apart the Philadelphia Eagle
secondary for three touchdowns
and 261 yards, making it shock
ingly simple for the Raiders to
roll to a 27-10 victorv for the 1980
NFL title.
This was the same Oakland
team that was supposed to bare
ly finish at 500 this season And
this was the same Plunkett who
was supposed to back up starter
Dan Pastorini in a revamped
Raider offense
But with Plunkett replacing
an injured Pastorini, the
Raiders, who derived inspira
tion from their underdog role,
Svound up winning 13 of their last
15 games. They peaked per
fectly. combining a pass-domi
nated. big-play offense with a
defense that forced four turn

overs to win Oakland's second
Super Bowl.
The victory also set up a
scene the NFL front office had
dreaded: Commissioner Pete
Rozelle presenting the cham
pionship trophy to Davis, who
has defied the league by trying
to move his club to Los Angeles
and long has been an adversary
of the league boss. But the scene
in the Oakland locker room
came off without a hitch.
After pointing out that the
Raiders were the first wild card
team to win the Super Bowl
(since the AFL-NFL merger),
Rozelle told Davis: "This is a
tremendous accomplishment to
the organization and a great
credit to you for putting the
team together."
Responded Davis: "This was
our finest hour, the finest hour
in the history of the Oakland
Raiders. This one is the sweet
est."
"It's a funny bunch." Davis
said. "They just played.
They're just the most unique
group It didn't matter where
Philadelphia was on the field.
They attacked all day, both
sides."
It also was the sweetest hour
for Plunkett. the former Stan

ford all-America whom Davis
had salvaged from the waiver
list after he had been released
by San Francisco He had
played horribly at times this
season, although Oakland kept
winning, but Sunday night he
was almost perfect: 13 of 21, no
interceptions, just one sack,
hardly a forced pass.
Plunkett had plenty of help.
Linebacker Rod Martin, a sup
porting player all season,
leaped into the spotlight by pick
ing off a Super Bowl-record
three interceptions, including
one on the game's first
possession to help put Oakland
ahead for good.
And Plunkett's receivers.
Cliff Branch and Bob Chandler,
found constant openings in Phil
adelphia's zone, breaking open
for crucial catches all game.
Branch, an elusive sprinter, fin
ished with five catches for 67
yards and a record-tying two
scores. Chandler, a man of a
thousand moves, caught four for
77 yards.
There also was the Oakland
defensive front, which dodged
and twirled around Philadel
phia's talented offensive line to
keep constant pressure on Phil
adelphia quarterback Ron

Jaworski, who came into the
game with the stingiest in
terception ratio in the league.
Oakland bottled up the Eagles
so well that Philadelphia
couldn't get into the end zone un
til the fourth quarter. By then, it
was far too late for Coach Dick
Vermeil's club, which had en
tered the game a three-point fa
vorite after its decisive NFC
championship victory over Dal
las.
But Oakland shut off the
Eagle running game, holding
halfback Wilbert Montgomery,
the hero of the triumph over the
Cowboys, to just 44 yards on 16
carries.
Stripped of a ground threat.
Jaworski was forced to pass
much, much more than he
wanted, a Super Bowl-record 38
times. He completed 18 for 291
yards, but too many were in
tercepted and too many were
dropped by receivers to enable
his team to rally
From the start, it was obvious
this was going to be Plunkett's
night, just as it was obvious
Philadelphia was suffering
from Super Bowl debut jitters.
On Philadelphia's third play,
Martin stepped in front of a pass

Plunkett spotted Branch
isolated on linebacker Jerry

match into a 19-vard completion

Three plays later. Branch
drove to the back of the end
zone, turned ahead of cor
nerback Herman Edwards and
sprinted back toward Plunkett.
who momentarily thought about
running after dropping into the
pocket But Branch was too
wide open to miss, so Plunkett
drilled the ball into his stomach

for a touchdown.
Chris Bahr. who also had two
field goals, added the first of
three extra ponts for a 7-0 lead
with 8:56 left in the quarter
But the play that symbolized
Plunkett's season, while all but
putting Philadephia away,
came later in the same period
The Eagles had just had a

touchdown pass to Rodney
Parker nullified on an offside
penalty, forcing a punt to the
Oakland 14 On third down from
the 20. Plunkett was forced out
of the pocket and scrambled to
his left On the run.he spotted
halfback Kenny King open just
behind Edwards, who was start
ing to respond to the quarter
back on the loose.
When Edwards moved up a
step. Plunkett unloaded in
stride. King also took it in stride
at the Oakland 39 with nothing
but open field ahead of him He
won a footrace with the Eagle
secondary, finishing off the
stunning 80-vard play that gave
the Raiders a 14-0 advantage
with nine seconds to go in the
quarter.
Philadelphia still tried to ral
ly. The Eagles got a 30-vard
field goal from Tony Franklin
after a drive stalled on the 13.
But after another march
couldn't get beyond the Raider

Franklin attempt, from the 28.

Hendricks.

"We needed to play well right
away at the start of the second
half." Vermeil said Instead.
Oakland took the kickoff and
went 76 yards in five plays, in
cluding Plunkett completions of
13 yards to King and 32 to
Chandler that preceded
Branch's touchdown reception
of 29 yards.
That one should never have
happened Plunkett unloaded
one of his poorest passes of the
game It was headed more in the
direction of rookie cornerback
Rovnell Young than Branch
But Young waited at the goal
line for the ball instead of com
ing back for it.and Branch cut in
front of him. pulling in the throw
and spinning into the end zone
for a 21-3 margin with 12:24 re
maining in the period
After that it was academic.
Martin's second interception
led to a 46-vard Bahr field goal
that stretched Oakland's lead to
24-3 And after Jaworski passed
to tight end Keith Krepfle for a
eight-yard score with 13:59 to
play. Bahr added a 35-yard field
goal five minutes later .
