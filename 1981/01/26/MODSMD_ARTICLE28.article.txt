# Cards perform like novices in L.A.

### Chris Haft 
Los Angeles — The term
Splaying like a freshman" —
that is. committing an in
ordinate number of unforced er
rors — fit most members of
Stanford's men's basketball
t*?am this past weekend.
Such miscues are expected
from the four first-year stu
dents on the squad. But Cardinal
veterans and rookies alike con
tinually made reckless mis
takes that caused Friday night's
85-58 loss to UCLA and Saturday
evening's 89-64 failure at USC.
On both nights. Stanford head
coach Dick Dißiaso observed
that his team became mentally
unraveled
"We lost our poise, and we
lost it for most of the game." he
said after the UCLA debacle.
"Usually, our team does a pret
ty good job of thinking, but to
night we didn't concentrate on
throwing the ball properly." he
added following the USC embar
rassment.
Repeated mistakes
Other than a half-court trap
defense UCLA used, the Bruins
(11-3 overall. 5-2 in the Pacif
ic-10 Conference) and Trojans
(7-6. 4-2) didn't make any par
ticularly special strategic
changes for Stanford.
The Cards, however, ap
peared intent during both games
on perfecting the awry fling out
of bounds, the fumble to an op
posing player, the unnecessary
foul, and the crisp pass that set
tles neatly in an opponent's
grasp.
The pattern remained the
same each evening: Stanford
kept the score close for 15 or 20

minutes before finally cracking
under the weight of their mis
takes.
"I'm not going to be much for
comments tonight." said for
ward Brian Welch when asked
for an explanation after the USC
game. "It was the same as last
night."
'Very careless'
Against USC at the Sports
Arena the Cards gave the ball up
18 times — 15 in the first half,
giving a beatable USC squad an
easy opportunity for victory.
"I might have to attribute it
(Stanford's sloppiness) to
USC's defense, but I think we
were very careless." Dißiaso
said. "We never gave ourselves
a chance .. . you just can't
throw the ball away as much as
we did and expect to be a fac
tor."
The Cards were a factor for a
little while, trailing only 27-23
late in the first half despite
making 10 turnovers in the in
itial 10 minutes.
But in a nightmarish six
minute span starting shortly
before halftime and ending ear
ly in the second half. USC an
nihilated Stanford 21-2, scoring
12 of the last 14 first-half points
and tallying the first nine points
after intermission. It became
clear the Cards were on their
way to their fifth loss in seven
Pac-10outings (6-10 overall).
The final statistics were at
once demonstrative and mis
leading. The ease of USC's
triumph showed in the fact that
all 12 Trojans saw action, and 11
scored. The difficulty Stanford
had in handling the ball was re
flected in its meager total of
four assists.

A few Cards picked up some
nice numbers — John Revelli
(16 points and 12 rebounds),
Welch (16 points and 10 re
bounds) and Keith Jones (17
points). However. Revelli's
four turnovers and Welch's five
flawed their performances. And
15 of Jones' points came in the
meaningless second half
Nevertheless. Trojan head
coach Stan Morrison com
plimented Stanford. "I really
like that team." he said.
"They'll mature. They play
hard, they're physical, and they
shoot 19 million free throws."
No success in Pauley
The Cards could have used a
few million of those free throws
in Pauley Pavilion, where they
have never won in 15 tries.
After forward Jeff Ryan, who
sank six of seven shots, canned a
short baseline jumper with
18:05 to go. the Cards trailed
only 40-34.
Thus challenged, the 12th
ranked Bruins spent slightly
more than eight minutes out
scoring Stanford 24-9 to settle
the outcome. The Cards helped
UCLA by committing five of
their 20 turnovers in this
stretch.
Co-captain Tony Anderson, a
seldom-used forward, made
three steals accounting for six
points in UCLA's decisive

streak. The 6-foot-4 1/ 2 junior fin
ished with 14 points, a career
high.
"It gets my confidence
back." Anderson said of his out
burst "Ever since my
freshman year I lose my con
fidence. gain it back, lose it
again ..."
UCLA, meanwhile, lost noth
ing. even without leading scorer
Darren Dave in the starting
lineup. Bruin head coach Larry
Brown wouldn't tell why he
benched Daye for Cliff Pruitt.
"It's just a family affair." said
Brown, who later joked. "He
(Daye) didn't like my tie."
The Bruins tied up Stanford
with the aforementioned half
court trap and a full-court press,
but these ploys shouldn't have
overly affected the Cards, who
have already faced pestering
defenses.
"Their (the Bruins') press
was no tougher than Oregon
State's: we didn't concentrate
enough." Card forward Roger
Lemons said.
How did Brown feel wathing
Stanford struggle with its
ballhandling? Very unmoved.
"You oughta see our freshmen
play." he said. "It's a trip."
This past weekend was a trip,
too. for the Cards — a bad one.

said. "We never gave ourselves
a chance .. . you just can't
throw the ball away as much as
we did and expect to be a fac
tor."
The Cards were a factor for a
little while, trailing only 27-23
late in the first half despite
making 10 turnovers in the in
itial 10 minutes.
But in a nightmarish six
minute span starting shortly
before halftime and ending ear
ly in the second half. USC an
nihilated Stanford 21-2, scoring
12 of the last 14 first-half points
and tallying the first nine points
after intermission. It became
clear the Cards were on their
way to their fifth loss in seven
Pac-10outings (6-10 overall).
The final statistics were at
once demonstrative and mis
leading. The ease of USC's
triumph showed in the fact that
all 12 Trojans saw action, and 11
scored. The difficulty Stanford
had in handling the ball was re
flected in its meager total of
four assists.

A few Cards picked up some
nice numbers — John Revelli
(16 points and 12 rebounds),
Welch (16 points and 10 re
bounds) and Keith Jones (17
points). However. Revelli's
four turnovers and Welch's five
flawed their performances. And
15 of Jones' points came in the
meaningless second half
Nevertheless. Trojan head
coach Stan Morrison com
plimented Stanford. "I really
like that team." he said.
"They'll mature. They play
hard, they're physical, and they
shoot 19 million free throws."
No success in Pauley
The Cards could have used a
few million of those free throws
in Pauley Pavilion, where they
have never won in 15 tries.
After forward Jeff Ryan, who
sank six of seven shots, canned a
short baseline jumper with
18:05 to go. the Cards trailed
only 40-34.
Thus challenged, the 12th
ranked Bruins spent slightly
more than eight minutes out
scoring Stanford 24-9 to settle
the outcome. The Cards helped
UCLA by committing five of
their 20 turnovers in this
stretch.
Co-captain Tony Anderson, a
seldom-used forward, made
three steals accounting for six
points in UCLA's decisive

streak. The 6-foot-4 1/ 2 junior fin
ished with 14 points, a career
high.
"It gets my confidence
back." Anderson said of his out
burst "Ever since my
freshman year I lose my con
fidence. gain it back, lose it
again ..."
UCLA, meanwhile, lost noth
ing. even without leading scorer
Darren Dave in the starting
lineup. Bruin head coach Larry
Brown wouldn't tell why he
benched Daye for Cliff Pruitt.
"It's just a family affair." said
Brown, who later joked. "He
(Daye) didn't like my tie."
The Bruins tied up Stanford
with the aforementioned half
court trap and a full-court press,
but these ploys shouldn't have
overly affected the Cards, who
have already faced pestering
defenses.
"Their (the Bruins') press
was no tougher than Oregon
State's: we didn't concentrate
enough." Card forward Roger
Lemons said.
How did Brown feel wathing
Stanford struggle with its
ballhandling? Very unmoved.
"You oughta see our freshmen
play." he said. "It's a trip."
This past weekend was a trip,
too. for the Cards — a bad one.
Los Angeles — The term
Splaying like a freshman" —
that is. committing an in
ordinate number of unforced er
rors — fit most members of
Stanford's men's basketball
t*?am this past weekend.
Such miscues are expected
from the four first-year stu
dents on the squad. But Cardinal
veterans and rookies alike con
tinually made reckless mis
takes that caused Friday night's
85-58 loss to UCLA and Saturday
evening's 89-64 failure at USC.
On both nights. Stanford head
coach Dick Dißiaso observed
that his team became mentally
unraveled
"We lost our poise, and we
lost it for most of the game." he
said after the UCLA debacle.
"Usually, our team does a pret
ty good job of thinking, but to
night we didn't concentrate on
throwing the ball properly." he
added following the USC embar
rassment.
Repeated mistakes
Other than a half-court trap
defense UCLA used, the Bruins
(11-3 overall. 5-2 in the Pacif
ic-10 Conference) and Trojans
(7-6. 4-2) didn't make any par
ticularly special strategic
changes for Stanford.
The Cards, however, ap
peared intent during both games
on perfecting the awry fling out
of bounds, the fumble to an op
posing player, the unnecessary
foul, and the crisp pass that set
tles neatly in an opponent's
grasp.
The pattern remained the
same each evening: Stanford
kept the score close for 15 or 20

minutes before finally cracking
under the weight of their mis
takes.
"I'm not going to be much for
comments tonight." said for
ward Brian Welch when asked
for an explanation after the USC
game. "It was the same as last
night."
'Very careless'
Against USC at the Sports
Arena the Cards gave the ball up
18 times — 15 in the first half,
giving a beatable USC squad an
easy opportunity for victory.
"I might have to attribute it
(Stanford's sloppiness) to
USC's defense, but I think we
were very careless." Dißiaso
said. "We never gave ourselves
a chance .. . you just can't
