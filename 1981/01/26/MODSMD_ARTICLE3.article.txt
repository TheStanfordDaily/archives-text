# Flags, signs, ribbons welcome them home...

### Washington Post 
Highland Falls, N.Y. — They stood
for hours in the mud. the snow and the
brisk winter air yesterday with their
American flag? and yellow ribbons,
waiting for a glimpse of the returning
American hostages, waiting to give
them a hero's welcome.
Some, like John Uvegas of Trenton,
N.J . arrived at 3a.m. so he could get a
good spot to give a message to the re
turnees. "To our exalted 52 heroes:
Forget. Enjoy," his placard said
"I was a prisoner of war in World
War II I know what these people have
gone through." said the retired postal
worker. "I want to impress on them to
forget — to try to set all of this as
much out of their minds as possible.
And the one way to forget is to enjov
yourself."
Others, like Pauline Wvman.' de
scribed themselves as hostage
junkies. "I'm here because I've fol
lowed the hostages ever since they
were captured. I followed the POWs
the same way. My husband is in the
service and the same thing could hap
pen to him."
Emotions spilled forth in placards,
shouts and an occasional tears along
the long, picturesque road to West
Point, which some renamed "Free
dom Road." Yellow ribbons, banners
and streamers were everywhere —

sometimes on everv tree, signpost and
parka for miles, The crowas spoke
best through the signs they waved:
"Clod Bless You. Tne People Never
Forgot You" . . . "We Care. We Love
You" . . . "Nuke the Ayatollah" . . .
"4-4-4-No More" . . . "Live, Laugh.
Love" . . . "This is the First Day of
the Rest of Your Life."
It was an extraordinary outpouring
of emotion. It was as if all the pent-up
rage, frustration and that all-but-for
gotten American commodity, patri
otism had suddenly hurst forth over
the snow-covered lower Catskill
Mountains.
People had difficulty expressing
their precise emotions, or their rea
sons for driving miles to wait for the
hostages to pass. Some, like Marjorie
Yaschur of Holmsdale. N.Y.. simply
wanted to be part of history and what
she regarded as a rebirth of national
pride.
"I've been watching this all on tele
vision for months and months. I now
feel part of it." she said. "My two kids
can't believe all the cameras around."
"It simply feels good to be an Amer
ican again." said Bob Hickson of
Yorktown Heights. N.Y. "I think inte
grity has been restored to our nation."
"There's a tremendous feeling of
patriotism here." Hickson said as he
stood shivering in the throng outside
the gates to the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point. "I think it's a
symbol of something that has been
missing in this country since the Viet
nam war."
