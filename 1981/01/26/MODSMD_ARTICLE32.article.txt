## Gymnasts win, don't bite dust 
### Dean Eyre 
Since December, the unof
ficial theme song for the wom
en's gymnastics team has been
Queen's "Another One Bites the
Dust", in sarcastic reference to
an abundance of injuries.
After Friday night's runaway
victory over San Jose State and
Cal Poly-Pomona, one which
came with only a few falls and
no injuries to speak of, it's about
time to spin a new disc.
Stanford is already sporting a
new record, 3-3 (1-0 in NorCal
Conference competition) and
the Cards got back in the groove
with a team score of 134.75
points, up from the 126.00 and

127.50 totals against USC and
UCLA a week ago.
San Jose, minus the services
of three of its top gymnasts and
losing Kurt Benjamin halfway
through the meet with a leg in
jury. compiled 119.65 points for
second place. Cal Poly-Pomona
finished third with 118.70.
Cardinal Merilyn Chapman
won three of the four events to
capture first place in all-around
competition with 34.65 points.
She took top honors in vaulting
(8.85), uneven parallel bars
(9.30) and floor exercise (8.60).
Stanford's Anne Smith earned
second place in all-around with
33.40 points, won balance beam

(8.50), tied for third in vaulting
with Spartan Lorraine Mackie
(8.55) and placed third on bars
(8.60) and floor (7.75).
Julie Bledsoe completed the
Stanford sweep in all-around,
taking third with 33.05. Included
in that total was a second-place
vault (8.65) and a 8.90 effort on
the bars, which was good for a
third-place tie with teammate
Jeanette Lacoste.
Jennifer Roberts finished
third on beam (8.30) and Caryn
Lucido placed second on floor
(8.00) to round the Stanford
scoring.
Lacoste's 8.90 on bars was
personal best, breaking her 8.70
mark set last season "I hit it,
finally." she said after the
meet. "I was really happy about
my bars. Now if I can only get
the Comaneci and the handstand
(two difficult maneuvers on the
bars). I'm set But it'scoming."
Head Coach Jackie Walker
was pleased with Friday's per
formances. but looks to even
stronger showings in upcoming
meets.
"Freshman Caryn Lucido is
finally starting to pull things to
gether â€” that was her best meet
of the season," Walker said.
"She looked much more mature
and experienced out there. I
think things are going to keep
getting better for her for the
rest of the season.
"We missed Karen Hall (out
with injuries), of course,"
Walker added. "Merilyn (Chap
man ) had a good meet until bal
ance beam. I'd like to see
Merilyn hit some higher all
around scores in the next couple
of meets. Anne (Smith) came
back beautifully after the prob
lems she had with her sprained
ankle last week.
"It was a good meet for us.
but it's still frustrating to watch
them and see that we can still do
three or four points better than
that." Walker said of her team.
If Walker's performers from
Friday's meet continue to hit
their routines and a healthy Hall
and Anne Friend can return, the
jukebox will be playing another
song -- it's "All Right Now."
