## 
### Bill Beyda 
There's one minute left and
the Stanford Cardinals' wom
en's basketball team have tied
the University of the Pacific
Lady Tigers. UOP brings the
ball down the court, passes, and
buckets a 20-foot jumper.
It was the death blow for the
Cards. Stanford proceeded to
foul and turn the ball over three
times in the last minute to lose,
80-74 in Stockton Saturday night.
"Our shooting was great,"
Stanford assistant coach Mike
Kehoe said. "We were 32 for 54
from the field, or 60 percent. It
was our turnovers that killed us.
We had 28 turnovers to their 18.
The way we were shooting, if
we'd had the ten extra shots, we
would have won."
Kim Kupferer. led Stanford
with 24 points, including 11 for 11
from the field and 12 rebounds.
Anne Miller and Louise Smith
scored 12 points, and Kehoe
praised Kathv Murphy for her
outstanding defense.
The game was very close, and
the first half ended in a 42-42 tie.
UOP used a pressure defense in
the second half, causing the
Cards to turn the ball over. "Our

judgement was poor." Kehoe
said, "and we forced the tempo
of the game when we shouldn't
have."
"Teams seem to get pumped
when they play us." the coach
added. "I've seen UOP three
times, and they never played
this well. Two of their girls had
26 points between them. Girls
that I've never seen in double
figures scored eleven points."
Kehoe was not discouraged by
the loss, which dropped Stan
ford to a 1-3 NorCal Conference
mark and 10-10 overall. "Our
practices are getting better,"
he said. "In fact, they're the
best ones I've seen since I've
been here. Our team spirit is
great, and we've got the talent.
It's just a question of getting
everything to work together."
According to Kehoe. the con
ference title is not going to be
won by an undefeated team.
"We have to take every game as
we get to it.and try and win," he
said. "If we can put a string of
wins together, we'll be in good
shape."
The Cards return to Maples
Pavilion Wednesday night
against Santa Clara at 7:30.
