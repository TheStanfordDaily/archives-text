less than a devastating lineup of
volleyball teams. Sacramento
State team is on the club level,
while Cal Polv-SLOdropped out
of the Cards' league. Nonethe
less. Shaw said these relatively
easy games are doing a world of
good
"One thing we lack is game
experience." Shaw said of his
young team. "In certain situ
ations we lose something be
cause of it." The starting lineup
is composed of one senior, one
junior, two sophomores and two
freshmen. The whole team is so
young. Shaw said, that beyond

the top seven or eight men there
is a lot of raw talent and little
else.
"Hopefully we can come
along fast enough in these early
games so that when we get to
the San Diego States and UCLAs
we'll be a little more prepared."
Shaw said.

National Indoor Intercollegiate
Singles Championship this
