New Orleans (AP) —
They've called Oakland
owner Al Davis a trouble
maker, a malcontent and an
outlaw And yesterday, they
called him champion and a
genius.
Davis and National Foot
ball League Commissioner
Pete Rozelle — frequently at
odds over other matters —
were in total harmony after
Super Bowl XV as the com
missioner presented the win
ner's trophy to the owner
"Al. the Raiders became
the first wild-card team to
win the Super Bowl."
Rozelle said in.the jubilant
dressing room "I think it's a
tremendous compliment to
the organization.
"I think it's a great credit
to you for putting this team
together."
Davis, in an open-collared

white shirt, thanked Rozelle.
"You know when we look
back at all the years of glory.
This was our finest hour."
Davis said
Davis wants to move the
team from Oakland to Los
Angeles, and he has been
pressing a multi-million
dollar lawsuit aimed at pre
venting the league from
blocking such a move.
Neither Rozelle nor Davis
would talk about that dispute
after the game.
"1 don't want to get into
that right now." Davis said.
"I don't want to take away
from what is our finest
hour."
Rozelle also demurred "I
don't want to say anything
that would take away from
this." he said
