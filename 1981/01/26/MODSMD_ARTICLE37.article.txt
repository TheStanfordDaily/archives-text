Mao's widow sentenced to death
Peking— Jiang Qing. the widow of Chairman Mao
Tse-tung. was sentenced to death yesterday for her
activities during China's Cultural Revolution, au
thorities here announced The sentence was sus
pended for two years to allow her to repent.
A special court also convicted nine other promi
nent leftists of "counterrevolutionary activities."
giving one a suspended death sentence like Jiang's
and ordering the others imprisoned for terms of 16
years to life.
The prosecution had originally demanded Jiang's
execution, citing her "particularly heinous
crimes." She. defiant to the end of her five-week
trial, dared the court last month to put her to death
But China's top political leadership, including
Deng Xiaoping, the powerful Communist Partv vice
chairman, said Jiang should be spared as Mao's
widow and to avoid making her a martyr for the rad
icals' cause, according to well-placed sources here.
Under the court ruling, the death sentences given
Jiang. 67. and Zhang Chunqiao. 63. a former vice pre
mier and mayor of Shanghai, will be deferred for
two years to allow them, as permitted under Chinese
law. to "reform themselves through labor."
The Chinese Supreme Court would then review
their cases and either commute the sentences to life
imprisonment or order their immediate execution.
Most Chinese believe that the cases will now simply
be forgotten.
Reagan urged to lift oil controls
Washington— Two of President Ronald Reagan's
Cabinet officers are urging him to take a step that
could hike gasoline prices by 12 cents or more a
gallon but at the same time add up to $7 billion to the
national treasury.

The immediate decontrol of prices for crude oil
and gasoline — which Reagan could accomplish by
executive order — might by some estimates cost
consumers $10 billion between now and Oct. 1. the
date the controls are due to expire
This could happen because decontrol would allow
the price of domestic oil to rise to world market
levels, an increase of about twelve dollars a barrel.
The federal government stands to gain almost $7
billion through the "windfall profits" tax instituted
under then-President Jimmy Carter
Reagan budget director David Stockman and
Energy Secretary James Edwards have said they
feel Reagan should immediately take executive ac
tion to lift the controls. Reagan himself called for
decontrol during the fall presidential campaign
What has held up immediate action is the question
of how much it would add to inflation and at what
point.
Immediate removal of all controls likely would
hit gasoline first Decontrol could give a jolt to the
economy, raising prices on a range of products,
from food shipped by truck to synthetics and plastics
made with petroleum, and force up the cost of Social
Security, which is tied to the Consumer Price Index.
There is an argument, however, that gasoline
prices would not shoot up immediately. Retail
dealers are now charging more than 8 cents below
the amount gasoline price controls would allow be
cause of "price sensitivity" — that is. the market
won't bear a higher price
Reagan stops federal hiring
Washington— The Reagan administration Satur
day backdated its tough federal hiring freeze to Nov.
5 and the president announced his choices to head

the Internal Revenue Service and to be deputy direc
tor of the Central Intelligence Agency.
The decision to backdate the freeze to the day af
ter Reagan's landslide election victory will be a jolt
to the bureaucracy and to thousands of people who
have been promised federal jobs since tnen but are
not yet on the payroll The backdated freeze is cer
tain to face legal challenges from disappointed job
seekers.
Except for emergency situations, people offered a
job since Nov 5 now cannot be hired. When no freeze
is in effect, the executive branch agencies hire about
1500 new workers a day.
Reagan chose Roscoe Egger Jr., a partner with
the giant accounting firm Price. Waterhouse. and
Co.. to head the IRS. and Vice Adm. Bobby Inman,
an intelligence specialist whom President Carter
named to head the National Security Agency, to be
deputy to CIA Director William Casey.
Reagan promised a hiring freeze during his presi
dential campaign and issued the order imposing one
within hours of being inaugurated The decision to
backdate it is a surprise, however.
The executive branch has been under a partial hir
ing freeze, allowing only one of every two vacancies
to be filled, since last March. Full-time permanent
employment dropped by about 20,000 jobs during
this freeze, imposed bv former-President Jimmy
Carter. Recently the agencies — clearly antici
pating a Reagan freeze — went on what officials
have described as a "hiring binge."
Today's weather
Fair with high clouds and patchy morning fog. In
creasing clouds today leading to chance of rain to
night and tomorrow. Lows in the 40s to low 50s to
night. Highs in the mid-50s to low 60s today and in the
50s tomorrow. Light winds.
