# Group to aid Chicanos in business
## 
### Andrew Johanos 
A new addition to pre-professional groups here is
designed to spur Chicanos' interest in business and
help them find jobs.
Founded by Israel Rodriguez. Juan Salcedo and
Joe Campa. theChicano Business Society (CBS) has
grown to its present size of 15.
"Many people are put off by the corporate im
age." said Rodriguez, who chairs the society. He
stressed the opportunities open to Chicanos in a field
in which management, marketing and advertising
are but a few of the options.
Traditionally, not many Chicanos have pursued
careers in business. CBS sees the trend changing
and emphasizes the importance of role models.
Jessica Torres, activities director, noted the cul
ture shock some Chicanos feel when they arrive at
Stanford. When competing. "It helps to know that
others are working for it (jobs) or have already
made it."
CBS's immediate concern is to find summer in
ternships for members. The success rate is high —
last vear onlv one member's bid went unanswered.

A resume workshop was held in the fall with as
sistance from the Student Employment Office and
the Career Planning and Placement Center. Depen
ding on interest. CBS may hold more of these work
shops in the future. Currently, a resume book is
being compiled for distribution to local companies.
CBS already plans interview workshops, video
taped mock interviews and company presentations.
Pacific Telephone will hold a dinner and presenta
tion for CBS at the Faculty Club next month.
But CBS has had its share of problems regardless
of the group's merits, said Rodriguez. Despite a
large number of Chicanos here, the organization has
failed to attract the expected number of partici
pants.
Although CBS mailed 100 letters to prospective
members, the response rate was below 120 percent.
"We have more companies banging on our doors
than students who have handed in resumes."
Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez and Torres cited several reasons for
the lack of participation.
There is a negative connotation in the word

Chicano, said Torres. Some people associate the
word with "hoodlums and low-lifers." If so, some
students of Mexican decent may prefer not to be
called Chicanos. she said.
Also, people may look down on what they mis
perceive as belligerant ethnicity, said Rodriguez.
"We're not a band of angry Chicanos that want our
piece of the pie." he quipped. The CBS just wants to
inform Chicanos here of the available jobs, he said.
Torres said she feels that students may be scared
off, thinking they must be purely devoted to their
ethnic roots, come from families that speak only
Spanish at home or live in Casa Zapata here in order
to be accepted into the group. Torres rejected this,
saying. "We're not a certain clique. We try to reach
out."
The CBS hopes it will grow soon. Rodriguez said.
"We have contact sheets a mile long. Our only con
straint is ourselves," he encouraged interest d stu
dents to attend the next meeting in the Zapata
lounge. Tuesday. Feb. 3 at noon. Also, he said, re
sumes may be given to Hector Cuevas at the Student
Employment Office.
