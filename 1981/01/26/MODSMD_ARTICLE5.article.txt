# Group 'not a cartel'
## Prof explains OPEC production criteria 
### Philip Eure 
So long as OPEC producers meet
domestic budgets they will tend to
leave more oil in the ground, seeing it
as an investment for the future, ac
cording to David Teece. assistant pro
fessor at the Business School
The stall will continue as financial
incentives to expand output become
less attractive to oil-producing states,
he said.
Increasing demand for oil in the
U.S. and the West could drive up the
price of oil even higher and actually
reduce OPEC production, he said
Teece added that since OPEC is not
a classic example of an economic
cartel, "cartel-busting strategies (un
dertaken by the western consuming
nations) are likely to be completely in
effectual."
New view
Teece's behavioral analysis of
OPEC, contained in a paper released
last fall, challenges widely held views
of the OPEC role in creating world oil
prices.
According to Teece. the oil policies
of several key producing states seek to
maintain "target revenues" consis
tent with their own domestic budgets.
However, he added that it is neither
economically nor politically expe
dient for these OPEC countries to gen
erate much more revenue from their
oil sales because they can only absorb
limited amounts into their economies
In some cases. Teece noted, thev have

reached their "saturation point."
"Very often there is not the op
portunity to invest these additional re
sources productively in the domestic
economy because they're growing
almost as fast as they can at the pres
ent time. And so, to invest more (mon
ey) domestically, would involve ac
cepting very low economic returns.'
If. however, these oil-producing
states decide to invest more money in
foreign markets, that would only
create additional problems, said
Teece. "This is not perceived as being
very attractive to many OPEC states
since returns have been low and in
secure because of the political risks of
expropriation â€” witness the U.S.
freeze on Iranian assets," he observed
in the paper.
Political factors
Teece said political factors play the
crucial role in determining the OPEC
states' internal constraints on spend
ing According to him. the more mon
ey that an OPEC state invests at
home, the faster the growth of its
domestic economy and its whole so
cial structure. The attitudes of the
people change drastically too. Teece
noted.
"As the Iranian revolution has dem
onstrated. you can sometimes develop
too fast." warned Teece. "It's very
clear then that when a country en
gages in rapid economic development,
it rips and tears at its own social struc
ture."

Since there are fewer incentives for
the oil-producing states to generate
additional revenues to meet their
domestic needs. Teece inferred that
by keeping their oil in the ground,
there is "almost a natural mecha
nism" for the OPEC countries to pro
tect their monopoly profits.
This "target revenue" description
of OPEC producers, he said, is consis
tent with the oil policies of some key
states, including Kuwait.
No collusion
According to Teece. "An important
implication is that collusion is not nec
essary to successfully monopolize the
world oil market." Ra\her. he said.
OPEC nations more or less act inde
pendently to meet their own "target
revenues."
Teece believes OPEC is unstruc
tured and does not behave like a clas
sic cartel. He cited the absence of ra
tioning agreements and the chaotic
pricing among OPEC nations
A classic cartel raises prices by re
stricting output OPEC "attempts to
administer prices rather than out
put " During the 1970-74 trans
formation of the world oil market.
Teece found that few of the key
changes were achieved by OPEC
countries acting together
"Very often, one of a few govern
ments drove the bargains (against oil
companies) and OPEC merely rati

fied the results later on." he said.
Teece sees Saudi Arabia as a key
player in all of this. It is within the
best interests of the Saudis to help
maintain a stable world oil market, he
noted.
Instability happens when the price
of oil is driven way up by decreased
production and increased consump
tion.
The Saudis, said Teece. represent a
very important "moderating and sta
bilizing influence" in an otherwise un
stable oil market Teece cited Saudi
Arabia's willingness to "fill up the
gap" in production after the Iranian
revolution and the Iran-Iraq war.
"Saudi political objectives are
served bv policies which involve eco
nomic costs," said The Saudis
want to avoid world-wide recession
and strengthen ties with the U.S.
against a possible Soviet "grab for oil
in the Gulf." He said the Saudis want
revenues denied from "radical" pro
ducers. like Iran and Iraq, who might
use the money to fuel their military
machines
Kecent studies indicate Saudi Ara
bia could meet domestic financial re
quirements with an oil production rate
of only 5 billion barrels per day Dur
ing most of 1979 and 1980. it produced
9 5 billion barrels dailv
