# 200,000 greet hostages upon arrival in New York
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
West Point, N.Y. — The 52 Ameri
cans long held hostage as pawns in a
distant revolution came home to
America yesterday, home to the wel
coming arms of their loved ones, home
to a land awakening with joy from an
epic national nightmare.
With cries of "God Bless America."
snappy salutes and hugs of happiness,
the 50 men and two women stepped
from a presidential jet called "Free
dom One." returning at last from 14
months of captivity, deprivation and
mistreatment at the hands of Iranian
kidnappers.
Some knelt to kiss American soil as
others rushed directly to their fami
lies. who were free at last. too. from
the torment of uncertainty. It was a
reunion so excruciatingly emotional
that the manager of the hillside air
port near the United States Military

Academy said "I could not look I had
to turn my back and turn away ... I
felt like an intruder."
Because some of the freed hostages
were said to bear deep emotional
wounds from their ordeal, the wel
come at the airport was private with
no dignitaries, no bands, no stamped
ing horde of reporters or television
cameras.
But from a bluff 1000 yards away,
newsmen and cameras recorded the
scene, in sometimes blurry images.
First off the plane were the young
Marine guards who had tried to hold
off the screaming Moslem mob at the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4,
1979 In freshly creased dress uni
forms. the Marines gave brisk salutes
before bounding down the ramp. Be
hind them came the diplomats, admin
istrators. teachers and a California
businessman who found themselves

held hostage for 444 days.
Waiting on the cold but sun-splashed
apron of Stewart Airport were their
wives, mothers, fathers, children.
Women from Brooklyn. N.Y., and
Falls Cureh. Va., fell into their hus
bands' arms. Sobbing mothers from
Jubilee, lowa, and Pueblo, Colo.,
squeezed a son and a daughter with
hugs. Youngsters clutched their
fathers' legs, and were lifted into the
air. joyful cries mixing with tears.
One of the freed hostages. Army
Master Sgt. Regis Ragan. left im
mediately to fly home to Pennsylvania
where his mother is seriously ill. a
chronic heart ailment worsened by the
pressure of her son's captivity. The
others, still enveloped in arms of their
loved ones, went into the blue-and
white airport terminal where, beneath
huge signs proclaiming "Free at
Last" and "Home of the Brave." they
sang "God Bless America"and the
"Battle Hymn of the Republic" and
the national anthem.
"When not singing they sat and
talked quietly," said one official who
was present. "It was very low key."
What awaited the returned hostages
and their families outside the airport,
however, was anything but low-key. A
jubilant crowd estimated by New
York state police at 200.000 turned 15
miles of narrow country highway into
a canyon of yellow ribbons and flags, a
serenade of cheers, bells and sirens,
and a forest of signs like "We Got You
Back" and "We Gave Peace a Chance
and It Worked."
From the "aura of love," as airport
manager Frank Tarbell described the
private reunion, the ex-hostages and
their families moved in a motorcade
through a soft winter twilight to a ho
tel on the grounds of the United States
Military Academy. There they will re
main in seclusion until tomorrow,
when they flv to Washington for a star
spangled welcome at the White House.
President Ronald Reagan had
stayed away from the airport reunion,
telling the hostage families that "you
don't need outsiders." Tears had
glistened in the new president's eves
and his voice had wavered, however,
as he offered a brief prayer at a White
House meeting with hostage relatives
earlier yesterday before they flew
from Washington to West Point
"Since we all didn't got to church
this morning, because of this, can we
say dear God. thank you. thank you for
what you've done . . Reagan said
with bowed head
And. indeed, the return of the
hostages was the answer to a nation's
prayers — as well as a cause for the
celebration that echoed along the mo
torcade route through Catskill Moun
tain foothills rich with the legend of
Rip Van Winkle.
"It was simply great — this is truly
America." returned hostage
Moorhead Kennedy told Rep. Ben
jamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y), the dis
trict's member of Congress, as the' -

rode in the motorcade. "It made us all
feel great."
From the windows of six green-and
silver buses, the ex-hostages flashed
"V For Victory" signs as they passed
tens of thousands of cheering well
wishers A sign, referring to the Super
Bowl, announced: "Super Sunday —
America 52, Iran 0."
T*e period of national thanksgiving
will continue for days, in cities and
ceremonies large and small. A White
House greeting "with full honors" was
arranged for tomorrow afternoon by
Reagan, who was sworn into office as
America's 40th president moments
before the hostages were freed.
