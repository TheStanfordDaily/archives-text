A local group is trying to cultivate
national support for a scholarship fund
for the children of the eight men who
died in the aborted hostage rescue at
tempt last April.
"We were moved by the number of
gifts pouring in for the hostages."
Kenneth Fulmer. a graduate student
in education and spokesman for the
group, said. "However, we felt there
was no real way for the average guy to
honor the American sacrifice in
Iran." he said.

The students began their efforts
Wednesday and since then have been
working 12 to 15 hours per day to de
velop the program. Fulmer said
Greatest sacrifice
After a "brainstorming" session
that included calls to local banks,
state government. ASSU Legal Coun
seling Office and the U.S. State De
partment. the group "felt it might be
most appropriate to help those who
made the greatest sacrifice of all on
the hostages behalf," Fulmer said.
The group had laid the groundwork
for a non-profit corporation that would
co-ordinate a scholarship fund when
they were told by the Family Liaison
Group at the State Dept. — the body
that has been directing the re-entry of
the hostages — that a scholarship fund
had already been established and that
it was being coordinated through the
U.S. Air Force Base in Hurlburt. Fla.,
he said.
The students decided to "try and
promote the fund to let people know
that there is an alternative" means to
honor the Americans. Fulmer said
The fund, which was established in
April, has only attracted $40,000 since,
he said. "It's performance could be a
heck of a lot better." he said
Need money now
There are 17 children that the schol
arship must support, and approx
imately one half million dollars will be
necessary to provide for them all.
Fulmer said
Since the oldest child is now 15.
there will be a need for the fund money
soon , he said The bulk of the drain wiil
be in about eight or 10 years when
more of the children reach college
age. Fulmer said
The fund will probably be drained at
the rate of $40,000 to $50,000 per year
during that time, he said
The students have not set a target
amount because they hope that giving
to the fund will "catch on" and it may
also be possible to include the children
of the 52 hostages in the program.
Fulmer said
A Southern California firm has told
the group that it will give a percentage
of the profits from the sale of jerseys
that say "Welcome home 52" to the
fund. Fulmer said
"This offer is just an example of the
kinds of things people can do to sup
port the scholarship fund." Bruce
Taylor, a Stanford graduate now
teaching at UC-Davis. said.
The fund has been named in honor of
Col. Arthur Simmons, a marine who
died trying to free American prisoners
of war in Vietnam. Donations, which
are tax deductible, should be sent to
Lt. Gen. Leroy Manor. USAF (re
tired), 507 Magnolia Court, Destin,
Florida 32541.
Taylor and Fulmer's wives, Betty
and Judy, as well as Craig Wynn, a
graduate student in engineering, have
also worked to put together support
for the fund.
