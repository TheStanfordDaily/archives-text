# Summit leaders stress Arab unity
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
At Taif, Saudi Arabia — Amid
religious splendor un
precedented in Islam, the rulers
of the Moslem world gathered at
their holiest shrine yesterday to
hear a prayer calling on God to
help them "cleanse Jerusalem
of the Jews."
The glittering summit meet
ing of the Islamic Conference
Organization opened yesterday
afternoon beside the sacred
Kaaba in the Grand Mosque at
Mecca, the holiest of shrines
toward which all Moslems face
when they pray.
Occupied Jerusalem,
Palestine, the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan and their own in
ternal quarrels were the burn
ing issues spelled out by Saudi
Arabian King Khaled bin Abdul
Aziz to the kings, presidents and
other leaders of the 40 Islamic
nations represented in the

mosque.
But the solemn religious rit
uals. climaxed by the un
precedented opening to the dele
gates of the Golden Doors of the
sacred Kaaba — the cube
shaped shrine containing what
Moslems believe to be a heaven
sent stone from the original
temple of Abraham — all but ov
ershadowed King Khaled's
words.
Along with Crown Prince
Fahd bin Abdul Aziz. Khaled
called on his fellow Moslem
leaders to rescue "the home
land of the Islamic nation —
Palestine, the occupied Arab
territories and Afghanistan,
which are suffering under the
burden of oppression, tyranny
and aggression."
Nonalignment preached
Khaled. whose oil-rich king
dom has long favored the United
States and the West, also
warned his co-religionists
against forming alliances with

"or taking refuge under the um
brella of a superpower."
"Our loyalty must be neither
to an Eastern bloc nor to a
Western bloc, but to God," he
said. The warning followed a
condemnation of "the
bankruptcy of imported ideol
ogies and doctrines," leading
observers here to interpret his
call for non-alliance as a
stronger slap at the East than at
the West.
The king also cast a some
what softer light than previous
ly on the Saudi call for jihad
(holy war) to liberate Jerusa
lem. issued by Crown Prince
Fahd last August after Israel
voted to annex Arab East Jeru
salem as part of its eternal capi
tal.
Western interpretations
The Saudis have been embar
rassed by Western interpreta
tions of jihad as a militant call
to arms, and have been anxious

to get across their definition of
the term as a spiritual, econom
ic and political struggle that is
not primarily military, al
though it does not rule out the
use of force.
Khaled also emphasized unity
as a goal of the summit con
ference and called for his fellow
leaders, many of whom are at
loggerheads with one another,
to renounce and resolve their
rifts.
Whether the conflicting lead
ers made any headway by
praying together seemed
doubtful, however at least a few
were caught talking together or
through third parties by Saudi
television cameras, which pic
tured the entire ceremony na
tionwide.
The summit meeting, called
in an attempt to gain united
Moslem action to solve the prob
lems outline din Khaled's open
ing speech, will continue in At
Taif until tomorrow night.
