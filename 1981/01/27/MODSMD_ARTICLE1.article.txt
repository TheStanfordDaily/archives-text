# Admission to Stanford will be more competitive this year
##

High school students applying to
Stanford may find 1981 the most
competitive year ever.
As of yesterday, the admissions
office had processed an all-time high
13,800 undergraduate applications,
well ahead of last year's record
12,731. Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon said he expects the figure
to reach 14,000 when the counting
process is complete.
"It's really hard to know what to
attribute (the dramatic increase)
to," said Hargadon, noting that ap
plications have jumped by 1000 a
year for the past few years. He said
one explanation for the increase may
be that "more people are applying to
universities rather than to col
leges."
For the past six weeks, thousands
of documents have been flowing into
the University's admissions office,
necessitating that the 11-person ad
missions staff schedule weekend and
evening meetings, he said.
While evening and weekend meet
ings have been standard procedure
for several years, the admissions
staff began burning the midnight oil
two weeks earlier than usual this

year.
These after-hours review sessions
have been made tolerable in the past
by generous gifts of baked goods and
other food from kind-hearted
freshmen, according to Hargadon.
"That's what's gotten us through
the other years," said Hargadon,
adding that such contributions would
be more than welcome this year, too.
"The most difficult part of the
process is getting the papers and
mail together," he said. "Just when
you think you've caught up, two or
three more batches of mail arrive."
Hargadon said the rise in appli
cants will make it "slightly harder"
to gain admission to next fall's
freshman class than to past classes.
"Whatever increase in applicants
you have, a certain fraction are very
top students, a certain fraction are
not so good and a certain fraction are
just below the top," he said.
Although Hargadon has long made
it a habit to personally read every
application, this year may be dif
ferent.
"That remains to be seen ... I
may discover that there is a point
beyond which this is not possible."
On the East Coast, admissions of
fices at Ivy League schools such as
Harvard, Yale and Princeton have
been similarly besieged with record
or near-record numbers of appli
cants.
At Harvard, for example, the ad
missions office expects to receive
13,400 applications. That figure
would be second only to last year's

applicant pool of 13,846, according to
Harvard Dean of Admissions L. Fred
Jewett.
The fact that the total yearly costs
of attending these schools is ex
pected to exceed $10,000 next year
seems to have had no apparent effect
on their ability to attract large num
bers of applicants, nor does distance
seem to be a limiting factor.
Nearly 2000 students from the New
England and Middle Atlantic states
will apply here this year, Hargadon
estimated. Similarly, Harvard has
so far received more applications
from California high school students
(14001 than in any year in its history.
But after four years of steady in
creases, Harvard's applicant pool
seems to have reached a plateau,
Jewett said.
During the course of the decade,
Harvard projects a decline in appli
cants as the result of an expected
dropoff in college-age students from
the Northeast, he said. The North
east, and in particular New York
State, is currently Harvard's largest
source of applicants.
At Princeton the applicant pool
has already hit 10,823 and may soon
break the all time high of 11,106 set
two years ago, according to As
sociate Director of Admissions
Spencer Reynolds.
At Yale, where applications are
also expected to surpass the 11,000
mark, Director of Admissions
Linden Smith commented, "We're
so busy we haven't had time to
think."
