# Remember the money you save...
## In the market for a Stanford ring? Your best buy may be off- campus 
### Mike Martin 
David Gonzalez ('73) waited
until seven years after his grad
uation before deciding to order a
college ring. The intervening
years may have made him more
wary about his purchases than
he was as an undergraduate.
When he finally came into the
Stanford Bookstore last Decem
ber he didn't like the ring prices
he was quoted, he said, and left
without placing an order. At the
San Jose State bookstore, he
found that similar San Jose
rings were selling at substan
tially lower prices.
"They were selling exactly
the same rings," Gonzalez said,
"and some of them were going
for $100 under the price at Stan
ford."
When Gonzalez called the
Stanford Bookstore for an ex
planation he said he was told to
order a ring with the Stanford
insignia through the San Jose
State bookstore if he liked its
prices better. He followed the
advice, and now is waiting for
his ring to arrive in the mail.
College rings are not easy to
come by outside college cam
puses; most jewelers don't like
to carry them, according to the
San Jose State store's assistant
manager David Friedley, be
cause the rings can't command
as high a mark-up as other
merchandise. In the absence of
off-campus competition, col
lege bookstores mark up class
rings largely at their own dis

cretion.
Calls to more than a dozen
area jewelers produced only one
off-campus jeweler, Zales in the
Stanford Shopping Center, of
fering a line of Stanford rings.
"We do very well with Stan
ford rings," said Zales Manager
David Morais, "and selling
them helps bring people into the
store to buy other merchan-

Ring type Stanford S.J. State Zales

Intaglio 14 karat $250 $180 $225
Jasmine 10 karat $205 $153 $165
Jasmine 14 karat $283 $200 $225

dise."
Part of Zales' success may
stem from their underselling
the Stanford Bookstore by $20 to
$40. Ring prices are volatile be
cause the price of gold fluc
tuates, but on Jan. 12 the pricing
of Art Carved fashion rings fol
lowed a consistent pattern at
Zales, Stanford and San Jose
State. These rings are, apart
from the spellout of the school's
name, the same wherever they
are purchased, and in all cases
the rings sold at the Stanford
Bookstore carried substantially

higher prices.
The "Stanford Traditional"
ring, however, is sold only by
the Stanford Bookstore which
exercises monopoly rights. "We
designed the Traditional ring
ourselves," said Bookstore
Manager Eldon Speed. "So we
have an exclusive distribution
arrangement with Art Carved
who produce it for us."

Art Carved customer service
representative Linda Rose
brock confirmed that no other
store can order the "Stanford
Traditional" ring. "The orders
would just be turned away as
they came in," she said. But she
also said, contrary to the re
ports from representatives of
Zales, San Jose State and Stan
ford, that Art Carved rings af
fixed with the Stanford insignia
could only be ordered through
the Stanford Bookstore.
In any case, an enterprising

student might consider ordering
a Jostens version of the Tradi
tional ring from another store.
Jostens produced the Tradi
tional ring for the Bookstore
here before Art Carved got the
contract, and Jostens still sells
a whole line of traditional rings.
On January 12, when a
Jostens 14 karat men's medium
traditional ring sold at the Stan
ford Bookstore for $485. a ver
sion of the 14 karat men's medi
um traditional produced by
Jostens for San Jose State sold
for $322. The Art Carved Tradi
tional ring carried a price at
that time of $437 for the men's
medium traditional.
"You have to remember that
rings are different," said Book
store manager Speed when
asked about the price differen
tials. "They have their own
nuances. A student would have
to look at the Jostens rings in
other stores before he could
compare the prices."
The higher prices on Art
Carved fashion rings, which are
the same wherever they are or
dered, raises, of course, a dif
ferent issue. "San Jose State
may be getting a better whole
sale price," suggested Stanford
jewelry buyer Carol O'Leary.
"Our mark-up on the rings is
only 40 percent," store Manager
Speed added. "That's the same
mark-up we put on our sta
tionery."
An interesting set of puzzles.
But for someone in the market
for a class ring, the answers
might be worth a look around.

It may pav to shop around, even when shopping for a Stanford ring. Jewelers don't usually carry col
lege rings, and campus bookstores mark up the rings largely at their own discretion. Except for the Art
Carved Stanford Traditional ring, sold exclusively by tne bookstore here, prices may be lower
elsewhere.

Jostens 14 karat men's medium
traditional ring sold at the Stan
ford Bookstore for $485. a ver
sion of the 14 karat men's medi
um traditional produced by
Jostens for San Jose State sold
for $322. The Art Carved Tradi
tional ring carried a price at
that time of $437 for the men's
medium traditional.
"You have to remember that
rings are different," said Book
store manager Speed when
asked about the price differen
tials. "They have their own
nuances. A student would have
to look at the Jostens rings in
other stores before he could
compare the prices."
The higher prices on Art
Carved fashion rings, which are
the same wherever they are or
dered, raises, of course, a dif
ferent issue. "San Jose State
may be getting a better whole
sale price," suggested Stanford
jewelry buyer Carol O'Leary.
"Our mark-up on the rings is
only 40 percent," store Manager
Speed added. "That's the same
mark-up we put on our sta
tionery."
An interesting set of puzzles.
But for someone in the market
for a class ring, the answers
might be worth a look around.

It may pav to shop around, even when shopping for a Stanford ring. Jewelers don't usually carry col
lege rings, and campus bookstores mark up the rings largely at their own discretion. Except for the Art
Carved Stanford Traditional ring, sold exclusively by tne bookstore here, prices may be lower
elsewhere.
David Gonzalez ('73) waited
until seven years after his grad
uation before deciding to order a
college ring. The intervening
years may have made him more
wary about his purchases than
he was as an undergraduate.
When he finally came into the
Stanford Bookstore last Decem
ber he didn't like the ring prices
he was quoted, he said, and left
without placing an order. At the
San Jose State bookstore, he
found that similar San Jose
rings were selling at substan
tially lower prices.
"They were selling exactly
the same rings," Gonzalez said,
"and some of them were going
for $100 under the price at Stan
ford."
When Gonzalez called the
Stanford Bookstore for an ex
planation he said he was told to
order a ring with the Stanford
insignia through the San Jose
State bookstore if he liked its
prices better. He followed the
advice, and now is waiting for
his ring to arrive in the mail.
College rings are not easy to
come by outside college cam
puses; most jewelers don't like
to carry them, according to the
San Jose State store's assistant
manager David Friedley, be
cause the rings can't command
as high a mark-up as other
merchandise. In the absence of
off-campus competition, col
lege bookstores mark up class
rings largely at their own dis

cretion.
Calls to more than a dozen
area jewelers produced only one
off-campus jeweler, Zales in the
Stanford Shopping Center, of
fering a line of Stanford rings.
"We do very well with Stan
ford rings," said Zales Manager
David Morais, "and selling
them helps bring people into the
store to buy other merchan-

dise."
Part of Zales' success may
stem from their underselling
the Stanford Bookstore by $20 to
$40. Ring prices are volatile be
cause the price of gold fluc
tuates, but on Jan. 12 the pricing
of Art Carved fashion rings fol
lowed a consistent pattern at
Zales, Stanford and San Jose
State. These rings are, apart
from the spellout of the school's
name, the same wherever they
are purchased, and in all cases
the rings sold at the Stanford
Bookstore carried substantially

higher prices.
The "Stanford Traditional"
ring, however, is sold only by
the Stanford Bookstore which
exercises monopoly rights. "We
designed the Traditional ring
ourselves," said Bookstore
Manager Eldon Speed. "So we
have an exclusive distribution
arrangement with Art Carved
who produce it for us."

Art Carved customer service
representative Linda Rose
brock confirmed that no other
store can order the "Stanford
Traditional" ring. "The orders
would just be turned away as
they came in," she said. But she
also said, contrary to the re
ports from representatives of
Zales, San Jose State and Stan
ford, that Art Carved rings af
fixed with the Stanford insignia
could only be ordered through
the Stanford Bookstore.
In any case, an enterprising

student might consider ordering
a Jostens version of the Tradi
tional ring from another store.
Jostens produced the Tradi
tional ring for the Bookstore
here before Art Carved got the
contract, and Jostens still sells
a whole line of traditional rings.
