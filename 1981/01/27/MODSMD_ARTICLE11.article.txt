# Student-run human biology group to evaluate faculty and program
## 
### Lori Roback 
An innovative, student-run
committee designed for de
partmental policy evaluation
has recently been implemented
by the Human Biology Pro
gram.
The Huhian Biology Policy
Committee represents one of
the first attempts to instate
"the reformation of under
graduate education" called for
by President Donald Kennedy,

one of the founders of this in
terdisciplinary program.
Unlike most other de
partmental administration
committees at Stanford, this
group consists almost entirely
of students: two sophomores,
two juniors, two seniors, one hu
man biology adviser, one human
biology TA, one executive com
mittee member (student), one
upper division member (stu
dent), and a student chairman.

The only nonstudent member
represents the human biology
staff.
The faculty adviser, Dr. Rich
ard Thompson, is the new chair
man of the Human Biology Pro
gram. Having worked with the
psychobiology departments at
both University of California at
Irvine and Harvard University,
he said he encourages student
involvement in in -
terdisciplinary programs.
Thompson says he sees this
policy committee "as an ad
visory committee to both the ex
ecutive committee and myself.
It is a committee generated by
the students which I feel is very
important."
Meetings open to all under
graduates will be held on the
first Friday of every month.
Thompson said he feels that this
will allow a general sampling of
student opinion.
Another viewpoint was ex
pressed by Hank Tung, the stu
dent chairman of the commit
tee, who said he feels that the
committee's function "is to pro
vide a source of input for
criticisms and proposals for im
provements which this depart
ment naturally lacks due to its

structure, as it has no per
manent faculty."
He continued to explain that
the policy committee will serve
as an official channel for stu
dents to effectively implement
their ideas, a channel which will
be recognized by the two main
governing bodies of the Human
Biology Program.
For a proposal to reach either
committee, a student must first
present his suggestion to the
policy committee. The commit
tee will then form a "project
group" which will include com
mittee members and all in
terested students. After re
searching the alternative solu
tions to the problem, this group
will present its proposed policy
change to the governing bodies
for final approval.
The Human Biology Policy
Committee has already begun
addressing such problems as the
cohesiveness in the core and the
availability of faculty mem
bers.
It is.hoped that the student en
thusiasm which is generated in
this committee will spread,
causing the creation of similar
programs in other departments
of the University.
