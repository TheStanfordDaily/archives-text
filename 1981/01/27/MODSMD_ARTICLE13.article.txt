# Could propane fuel your car? It may not be worth converting
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
The gasoline lines are gone
now. The panic of the 1979 fuel
crisis has subsided.
But the frenzy of those odd
even days has not been for
gotten, and more and more mo
torists are looking into convert
ing their cars to the best-known
gasoline alternative — propane.
A record number of Ameri
cans made the switch to pro
pane engine fuel in 1980. Na
tionwide, there were more than
125,000 vehicle conversions,
compared with 72,000 in 1979.
But consumers are finding
out that, although propane is
relatively cheap and abundant,
it is not the fuel for everyone.
"It's out of the question for
everything on four wheels to run
on propane," declares John
Hartzell, director of com
munications for the National L-
P Gas Association in Oak Brook,
111.
In particular, industry of
ficials say,propane is not for the
individual consumer — the
housewife with errands to run or
the commuter who parks the
family car at the office all day.
"We have never encouraged
the average motorist to do
this," Hartzell said.
Yet private vehicle owners
are tantalized by the same at
tractions that propane holds for
fleet owners whose vehicles

rack up hundreds of thousands
of miles annually.
It currently costs at least 50
cents a gallon less than gasoline
and shortages are nowhere on
the horizon.
Now that gasoline prices are
rising again, additional private
vehicle owners are bound to ex
plore the propane option, de
spite the discouragement of the
industry itself.
What they will find is an alter
native to gasoline that can be ec
onomical in the long run but re
quires an ante for equipment
beyond the reach of many fami
ly budgets.
Depending on the kind and
fuel capacity of the equipment
installed, converting a vehicle
to run on propane or a combina
tion of propane and gasoline will
cost from $1000 to $2000.
The type of vehicle affects the
price, too, with trucks and rec
reational vehicles costing less
to convert than passenger cars,
which present more technical
difficultues.
Consequently, the best can
didates for conversion are gas
hogs like motor homes and large
cars that are driven tens of
thousands of miles in a year.
Peter Zeughauser, president
of Procal in Newport Beach,
Calif., has calculated that the
$1500 cost of converting a vehi
cle driven 20,000 miles a year at

five miles to the gallon of
gasoline will be recovered in 11
months.
Annual fuel savings after the
initial investment is recovered
will be $1650 if gasoline costs
$1.30 per gallon and propane
costs 75 cents, according to
Zeughauser's calculations.
On the other hand, it would
take 41 months to recover the
cost of converting a 20,000-mile
per-year vehicle that gets 25
miles to the gallon, Zeughauser
estimated, and its annual sav
ings after that would amount to
only $440.
In all cases, the length of the
recovery period goes down and
the fuel savings go up as more
miles are driven. Industry ex
perts say the quality of a pro
pane equipment installation af
fects both the safety of the vehi
cle and its performance. Yet
finding a qualified mechanic to
perform the installation can
prove difficult.
Propane manufacturers and
dealers are adamant that con
versions should never be done as
a do-it-yourself project.
"This is not something you
perform on your basement work
bench or in the back yard," said
Hartzell of the Gas Association.
"You could have an accident —
a fire or an explosion — and the
performance of your car can be
affected."

125,000 vehicle conversions,
compared with 72,000 in 1979.
But consumers are finding
out that, although propane is
relatively cheap and abundant,
it is not the fuel for everyone.
"It's out of the question for
everything on four wheels to run
on propane," declares John
Hartzell, director of com
munications for the National L-
P Gas Association in Oak Brook,
111.
In particular, industry of
ficials say,propane is not for the
individual consumer — the
housewife with errands to run or
the commuter who parks the
family car at the office all day.
"We have never encouraged
the average motorist to do
this," Hartzell said.
Yet private vehicle owners
are tantalized by the same at
tractions that propane holds for
fleet owners whose vehicles

rack up hundreds of thousands
of miles annually.
It currently costs at least 50
cents a gallon less than gasoline
and shortages are nowhere on
the horizon.
Now that gasoline prices are
rising again, additional private
vehicle owners are bound to ex
plore the propane option, de
spite the discouragement of the
industry itself.
What they will find is an alter
native to gasoline that can be ec
onomical in the long run but re
quires an ante for equipment
beyond the reach of many fami
ly budgets.
Depending on the kind and
fuel capacity of the equipment
installed, converting a vehicle
to run on propane or a combina
tion of propane and gasoline will
cost from $1000 to $2000.
The type of vehicle affects the
price, too, with trucks and rec
reational vehicles costing less
to convert than passenger cars,
which present more technical
difficultues.
Consequently, the best can
didates for conversion are gas
hogs like motor homes and large
cars that are driven tens of
thousands of miles in a year.
Peter Zeughauser, president
of Procal in Newport Beach,
Calif., has calculated that the
$1500 cost of converting a vehi
cle driven 20,000 miles a year at

five miles to the gallon of
gasoline will be recovered in 11
months.
Annual fuel savings after the
initial investment is recovered
will be $1650 if gasoline costs
$1.30 per gallon and propane
costs 75 cents, according to
Zeughauser's calculations.
On the other hand, it would
take 41 months to recover the
cost of converting a 20,000-mile
per-year vehicle that gets 25
miles to the gallon, Zeughauser
estimated, and its annual sav
ings after that would amount to
only $440.
In all cases, the length of the
recovery period goes down and
the fuel savings go up as more
miles are driven. Industry ex
perts say the quality of a pro
pane equipment installation af
fects both the safety of the vehi
cle and its performance. Yet
finding a qualified mechanic to
perform the installation can
prove difficult.
Propane manufacturers and
dealers are adamant that con
versions should never be done as
a do-it-yourself project.
"This is not something you
perform on your basement work
bench or in the back yard," said
Hartzell of the Gas Association.
"You could have an accident —
a fire or an explosion — and the
performance of your car can be
affected."
