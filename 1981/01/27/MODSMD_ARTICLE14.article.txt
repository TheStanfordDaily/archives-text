## Bob Pahre Rethinking voodoo economics 
### 
In his inauguration address.
President Ronald Reagan
placed primary, and almost ex
clusive, emphasis upon the U.S.
economy. Yet many Vice Pres
ident George Bush included,
have called Reagan's proposed
economic policies "voodoo eco
nomics." Are they?
The four basic goals of Rea
gan's economics are to balance
the federal budget, to cut taxes
by 30 percent over the next three
years, to reduce inflation and
to increase United States de
fense spending. These are in
deed noble goals, but are they
possible? Do any of them con
flict in any way?

For example, if 30 percent of
all federal taxes are given back
to taxpayers (the Kemp-Roth
bill), we may assume it will all
either be spent or invested
(which also leads to its being
spent eventually) by those re
ceiving it. The government, on
the other hand, would either
spend it or pay off its debts with
it. Any debts paid off would be
paid to banks who will invest the
money (also leading to the mon
ey being spent somehow). Thus,
no matter who has the money, it
ends up being put to the same
uses. Increased government
spending should be neither more
nor less inflationary than de
creased government spending
— a direct contrast to Reagan's
belief that by decreasing gov
ernment spending, we may de
crease inflation.
What if Reagan does signifi
cantly increase defense spend
ing? Defense spending is in
herently more inflationary than
other spending, because any
tank, missile, or other weapon,
manufactured and then stock
piled, takes a certain amount of
raw material out of circulation,
decreasing the supply of that
material somewhat, and raising
its price.
In addition, there are fewer
support industries related to or
new production created by mil
itary expenditures. A
hydroelectric/irrigation dam.
on the other hand, increases
both food and electrical prod
uction and the support in
dustries for distributing this in
creased production. Thus de
fense spending will increase
both inflation and unemploy
ment — the "misery index"

Reagan complained about in the
presidential debates.
Of course, Reagan also seems
to ignore the effects of other
countries upon the U.S. econo
my. While Jimmy Carter exag
gerated the effect oil plays on
the economy, this effect is still
an important one, as are effects
similar to it. These are outside
the president's control — I hope
he-realizes this.
Finally, what if Reagan does
indeed balance the budget, cut
taxes by 30 percent and increase
defense spending? With a cur
rent proposed budget deficit of
$60-100 billion, inflation
"shrinking" the budget con
stantly, and increased defense
spending, Reagan would have to
cut the non-defense federal
budget bv at least 50 percent.
How? By cutting waste." If
over half of the federal budget is
being wasted now, I will gladly
kiss the steps of the Hoover In
stitution. Realistic estimates
put government waste at be
tween three and 20 percent of
federal expenditures — Rea
gan's estimate is not even in the
right ball park. And, of course,
the wasteful bureaucrats must
be fired — can you imagine half
the federal bureaucracy un
employed? And you thought De
troit was in bad shape
No, these voodoo economics
just cannot work. I only hope
Reagan does indeed "sober up"
in office, as his apologists have
promised, to some of the re
alities of economics.
