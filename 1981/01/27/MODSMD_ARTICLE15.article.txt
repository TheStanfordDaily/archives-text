## Reagan promises no threat to welfare state 
### 
The election of Ronald Rea
gan last November 4 symbolized
the rejection by the voters of the
New Deal big-govern
ment/welfare-state policies
which have prevailed in this
country for the last half cen
tury. The majority of Ameri
cans have at last rejected the
failed economics of liberalism
and have come to suspect that
government is neither an effi
cient nor a humane means of
solving social and human prob
lems.
That Ronald Reagan should
serve as the symbol of the cur
rent anti-government sentiment
is understandable. For years, he
has been hopping around the
country selling himself as the
true messiah of limited govern
ment and free enterprise.
Unfortunately, the record
proves Reagan to be a false
prophet. His free-market
rhetoric is belied by the con
crete positions and actions he
has taken over the years.
Consider, for example, the
positions Reagan took during
his recent successful campaign
for the presidency.
His statements concerning
the Social Security system, the
largest and best-known bureau
cratic monument to New Deal
liberalism, are especially re
vealing.
Two decades ago. con
servatives generally favored
abolishing the system or at least
making participation voluntary.
Reagan, on the contrary, not
only refrained from any fun
damental criticism of this liber
al shibboleth during the cam
paign; he went out of his way to
constantly reiterate his firm
support for Social Security and
his determination to "guaran
tee the integrity" of the system.
Social Security is in fact a
massive chain-letter which is

collapsing into bankruptcy; it's
a multi-trillion dollar testi
monial to the irresponsibility
and human inadequacy of the
welfare state.
Anyone who defends Social
Security, as Reagan does, can
not honestly claim to be an oppo
nent of big business or of the
welfare state.
Reagan's claim that he is a
defender of free enterprise was
similarly contradicted during
the campaign by his support for
the federal bailout of Chrysler.
The free market operates on
the basis of profit and loss.
Companies which are unwilling
or unable to serve the demands
of consumers lose money and
are forced out of business, and
their assets are sold to those
who will better serve the needs
of the consumers.
Chrysler has been woefully
negligent in recent years in
serving the American con
sumer; in a free enterprise sys
tem, Chrysler would have paid
for that irresponsibility with
bankruptcy.
Reagan's support for govern
ment intervention to prop up
Chrysler shows that he either
does not understand or does not
support the operation of the free
market.
Reagan's position on tax cuts
also shows a willingness to per
petuate big government.
As he stated during the cam
paign, "What many people fail
to realize is that my tax-cut
plans merely reduce the tax in
crease of $86 billion next year
and more than $500 billion over
the next five years. My cuts are
only going to reduce that in
crease; there will still be more
money left for . . . spending."
In short, the Reagan "tax
cuts'" are a sham; what his pro
posals will amount to in reality
is a continuing increase in gov

ernment taxation and spending.
Reagan's support during the
campaign for the ongoing feder
al bailout of New York City, a
city whose problems are due to
a terminal case of welfare
statism and fiscal ir
responsibility. further confirms
the picture of a man unwilling to
abandon the welfare state or the
paternalistic bureaucracy,
massive taxation and govern
ment spending which invariably
accompany welfare statism.
Since the election. Reagan's
retreat from the free market
and limited government posi
tion has accelerated. Signifi
cant tax cuts and a balanced
budget recede further and
further into the future. The de
mise of the departments of
Education and Energy has been
indefinitely postponed. Reagan
has backpedaled on the grain
embargo and on the synthetic
fuels program, a massive boon
doggle which will force tax
payers to pay for research
which will benefit — and which
rightfully should be financed
by — the energy industry.
Recently in a speech here at
Stanford (Daily. Jan. 15), so
cialist Michael Harrington
called for a leftist crusade to de
fend big government and the
welfare state against a Reagan
onslaught. Such a crusade is un
necessary. Ronald Reagan has
neither the personal under
standing and commitment nor
the political courage required to
make a successful assault
against the welfare state and
against the established centers
of power.
At bottom, Reagan, like Har
rington, is a true conservative, a
man who accepts the essential
principles underlying the cur
rent status quo: paternalistic
government, a politically
directed economy, and a society

dominated by the state.
As governor of California.
Reagan presided over a sub
stantial growth in the size and
power of state government and
a substantial increase in state
taxation and spending. His com
mitment to making government
more efficient did not extend to
making government smaller.
As president, Reagan may
struggle to cut waste and ineffi
ciency in government, to stabi
lize government growth, to
transfer some functions from
the federal to the state or local
level, and to reindustrialize the
economy. But he is certain to
leave the basic structure of the
welfare state and of govern
ment intervention in the econo
my intact.
An anonymous Reagan staf

fer nicely summed up the goals
of the new administration: "We
don't want to dismantle the gov
ernment. We want a well-man
aged conservative welfare
state."
Those Americans who voted
for Reagan believing they were
voting for limited government
and free enterprise will be se
verely disappointed during the
next four years. The true radi
cals of America, those who
would break up the economy of
privilege, unleash individual
liberty, establish the free mar
ket, and smash the power of the
state, can take no comfort in the
inauguration of Ronald Reagan
as the 40th president of the Unit
ed States.

rhetoric is belied by the con
crete positions and actions he
has taken over the years.
Consider, for example, the
positions Reagan took during
his recent successful campaign
for the presidency.
His statements concerning
the Social Security system, the
largest and best-known bureau
cratic monument to New Deal
liberalism, are especially re
vealing.
Two decades ago. con
servatives generally favored
abolishing the system or at least
making participation voluntary.
Reagan, on the contrary, not
only refrained from any fun
damental criticism of this liber
al shibboleth during the cam
paign; he went out of his way to
constantly reiterate his firm
support for Social Security and
his determination to "guaran
tee the integrity" of the system.
Social Security is in fact a
massive chain-letter which is

collapsing into bankruptcy; it's
a multi-trillion dollar testi
monial to the irresponsibility
and human inadequacy of the
welfare state.
Anyone who defends Social
Security, as Reagan does, can
not honestly claim to be an oppo
nent of big business or of the
welfare state.
Reagan's claim that he is a
defender of free enterprise was
similarly contradicted during
the campaign by his support for
the federal bailout of Chrysler.
The free market operates on
the basis of profit and loss.
Companies which are unwilling
or unable to serve the demands
of consumers lose money and
are forced out of business, and
their assets are sold to those
who will better serve the needs
of the consumers.
Chrysler has been woefully
negligent in recent years in
serving the American con
sumer; in a free enterprise sys
tem, Chrysler would have paid
for that irresponsibility with
bankruptcy.
Reagan's support for govern
ment intervention to prop up
Chrysler shows that he either
does not understand or does not
support the operation of the free
market.
Reagan's position on tax cuts
also shows a willingness to per
petuate big government.
As he stated during the cam
paign, "What many people fail
to realize is that my tax-cut
plans merely reduce the tax in
crease of $86 billion next year
and more than $500 billion over
the next five years. My cuts are
only going to reduce that in
crease; there will still be more
money left for . . . spending."
In short, the Reagan "tax
cuts'" are a sham; what his pro
posals will amount to in reality
is a continuing increase in gov

ernment taxation and spending.
Reagan's support during the
campaign for the ongoing feder
al bailout of New York City, a
city whose problems are due to
a terminal case of welfare
statism and fiscal ir
responsibility. further confirms
the picture of a man unwilling to
abandon the welfare state or the
paternalistic bureaucracy,
massive taxation and govern
ment spending which invariably
accompany welfare statism.
Since the election. Reagan's
retreat from the free market
and limited government posi
tion has accelerated. Signifi
cant tax cuts and a balanced
budget recede further and
further into the future. The de
mise of the departments of
Education and Energy has been
indefinitely postponed. Reagan
has backpedaled on the grain
embargo and on the synthetic
fuels program, a massive boon
doggle which will force tax
payers to pay for research
which will benefit — and which
rightfully should be financed
by — the energy industry.
Recently in a speech here at
Stanford (Daily. Jan. 15), so
cialist Michael Harrington
called for a leftist crusade to de
fend big government and the
welfare state against a Reagan
onslaught. Such a crusade is un
necessary. Ronald Reagan has
neither the personal under
standing and commitment nor
the political courage required to
make a successful assault
against the welfare state and
against the established centers
of power.
At bottom, Reagan, like Har
rington, is a true conservative, a
man who accepts the essential
principles underlying the cur
rent status quo: paternalistic
government, a politically
directed economy, and a society

dominated by the state.
As governor of California.
Reagan presided over a sub
stantial growth in the size and
power of state government and
a substantial increase in state
taxation and spending. His com
mitment to making government
more efficient did not extend to
making government smaller.
As president, Reagan may
struggle to cut waste and ineffi
ciency in government, to stabi
lize government growth, to
transfer some functions from
the federal to the state or local
level, and to reindustrialize the
economy. But he is certain to
leave the basic structure of the
welfare state and of govern
ment intervention in the econo
my intact.
An anonymous Reagan staf

fer nicely summed up the goals
of the new administration: "We
don't want to dismantle the gov
ernment. We want a well-man
aged conservative welfare
state."
Those Americans who voted
for Reagan believing they were
voting for limited government
and free enterprise will be se
verely disappointed during the
next four years. The true radi
cals of America, those who
would break up the economy of
privilege, unleash individual
liberty, establish the free mar
ket, and smash the power of the
state, can take no comfort in the
inauguration of Ronald Reagan
as the 40th president of the Unit
ed States.

The election of Ronald Rea
gan last November 4 symbolized
the rejection by the voters of the
New Deal big-govern
ment/welfare-state policies
which have prevailed in this
country for the last half cen
tury. The majority of Ameri
cans have at last rejected the
failed economics of liberalism
and have come to suspect that
government is neither an effi
cient nor a humane means of
solving social and human prob
lems.
That Ronald Reagan should
serve as the symbol of the cur

is understandable. For years, he
has been hopping around the
