## Hostage 'agreement' extortion 
### 
As days pass since the release
of the hostages, more and more
is known of the conditions of
their captivity. News of beat
ings, Russian roulette, solitary
confinement and mock firing
squads give credence to Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's assertion
that the diplomats were not
hostages held in luxury hotels,
but prisoners of war.
In love and war, all is fair.
The president should issue an
executive order expropriating
all Iranian assets in the United
States. Of course, he should also
declare approximately a week
earlier, that the United States
will no longer guarantee the
safety c r nationals within Iran.
After all the legitimate liens on
these assets have been resolved
in American courts, the re
mainder should be divided be
tween the hostages as an indem
nity for the mental anguish and
physical torture at the hands of
the Iranian government.
Such an action would demon
strate in an non-violent manner
that the United States shall not
lightly suffer hostile actions
against its citizens any longer;
this is not to mention the partic
ularly egregious violation of in
ternational law that the seizure
of a diplomatic compound con

stitutes.
As for those who consider the
abrogation of a treaty uncons
cionable. I quote the editors of
the Wall Street ■Journal who
hold that "(T)his was not an
agreement, it was extortion."
There is sufficient precedent in
both international and criminal
law legitimizing the nullifica
tion of an agreement treaty
made under duress. It may be a
fundamental American notion
that we stick to our agreements,
but I posit that an equally fun
damental notion is that kidnap
pers are still brought to prose
cution after their victims are re
leased.
If the Reagan administration
were to seize Iranian assets, it
will clearly demonstrate that
the United States is determined
to protect its interests as well as
its allies. Further, such a course
would signal that the new ad
ministration has a much more
realistic foreign policy ap
proach than that of its predeces
sor; the days of being kicked
around by other nations as our
government unctuously sat in
the corner because it did not like

the rules by which the game is
played would be over. As a re
sult. the confidence of our allies
in our will to safeguard them
and protect their interests
would be restored, making them
more amenable to reciprocation
in our hours of need. Lastly, our
adversaries would be placed on
effective notice that we still
possess powerful sanctions and
have regained the will to imple
ment them if their actions so
warrant.
Possibly, the horror of the
captivity warrants the response
alluded to in this riddle; Q.
What's flat and paved and glows
in the dark? A. Iran, after Rea
gan's inaugurated. However,
turning Iran into an 84.000 lane
freeway would only make it that
much easier for Soviet tanks to
roll into Saudi Arabia. The
course I have offered would
show that we are not a helpless
giant and will go a long way to
restoring our national con
fidence and vigor, so necessary
for survival in the '80s.
