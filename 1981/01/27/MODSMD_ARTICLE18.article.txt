## Land ownership and ecological planning 
### 
.4 land ethic changes the role
of Homo sapiens from con
i/urrer of the land-community
to plain member and citizen of
it.
Aldo Leopold. A Sand County
Almanac. 1949
Environmental issues are
linked by a single underlying
principle: that soils, plants, wa
ters, rock — collectively, land
— may be owned. The rights and
privileges of property are ex
tended to owners, entitling them
to do, essentially, anything they
choose on that land. Not uncom
monly, the consequence of this
is that land is exploited or
abused in pursuit of short-term
economic benefits.
example is the for
est owned by a logging company
'which is clear-cut because it is
the most economical harvesting
technique. The biota is'devas
tated. the soil eroded, and the
streams clogged with sediment.
Although one may intuitively
find such abuses objectionablle,
we. as a society, tacitly condone
them. We are either insensitive
to or ignorant of the ethical is
sues involved.
Land, including the oceans, is
the source of all livelihood. It
supplies our food, our water, as
well as the raw materials from
which we derive shelter, tools
and machines. Although land is

surprisingly resilient, it can be
irreversibly degraded by the ac
tivities of humans.
Two regions of the Earth bear
stark testament to this fact: the
desert northwest of the Persian
Gulf (characterized by his
torians as the Fertile Crescent,
the cradle of civilization), and
the barren North African coast.
Both of these regions were once
highly productive, but were
worked too hard by the societies
which exploited them.
The Fertile Crescent became
infertile as a result of extensive
irrigation which made the soil
too alkaline for crops. In North
Africa, the forests were cut and
the grasslands grazed intensive
ly. The soils were so severely
damaged that the former biota
was unable to regenerate.
Not only did these societies
destroy the productive capacity
of the land, ensuring their own
destruction, they also destroyed
it for future generations. This is
the key ethical issue with which
we must deal.
There have been some en
couraging events since Aldo
Leopold wrote about the alarm
ing lack of respect for land that
prevailed in the U.S. a few dec
ades" ago. In 1960, the U.S. Con
gress enacted a law mandating
that publicly owned, federally

managed lands be utilized in
such a way as to provide the
maximum sustainable yield.
Thus, the vast acreages man
aged by the U.S. Forest Service
and the Bureau of Land Man
agement are, in theory, man
aged in a way that preserves
their productivity. The fact of
such management is disputable,
but the point is that the legal
framework exists.
Further encouragement is
provided by the Clean Air Act
and the Clean Water Act. In
discriminate pollution of these
resources is gradually being
eradicated. This is not to say
that the productivity of
estuaries, tidal marshes and
fisheries is not being reduced by
the effects of pollution, but that
a substantial degree of legal
protection exists for our water
(and air) resources.
Probably the most significant
environmental legislation in
history is the National Environ
mental Protection Act, which
requires a detailed evaluation
(the Environmental Impact
Statement) of broad scope on
the impacts of federally spon
sored or financed projects (e.g.,
dams, land-use plans). Many
states have followed this exam
ple and have their own laws

which require an evaluation of
the long-term environmental
and social impact of state-spon
sored projects and laws.
It is clear that our society has
recognized the value of our nat
ural resources, the need to util
ize them wisely for the sake of
ourselves and our descendants.
Nevertheless, there is an in
consistent duality in our laws
relating to land-use. We treat
our publicly owned lands with
due respect, we evaluate gov
ernment-sponsored projects
with eyes to the future, yet we
ignore all land-use issues in the
private domain.
The institution of private
property is in conflict with the
concept that the land belongs to
all of us. We have all inherited it
from our ancestors, and will
pass it on to our descendents. It
is the source of our collective
livelihood. We all have a legit
imate and vital interest in wise
use of all land. The question is,
at what point will we create a le
gal institution that ensures the
wise use of land, regardless of
ownership?
