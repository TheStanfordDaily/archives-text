Contract needed
Now that the clericals are ap
proaching a union representa
tion election, the Campus Re
port is replete with adminis
trative concern over staff prob
lems. Many months earlier than
usual, salary increases for the
next academic year were an
nounced Sexual harassment is
finally being dealt with. The
clerical shortage is publicly ac
knowledged — a not so well kept
secret for years now. We are
told that the largest group of
people seeking assistance v from
the Help Center consists of
clericals.
And. now (Campus Report.
Jan 17). the faculty are asked to
be patient with staff: to tolerate
chronic staff shortages, re
duced resources, and to lower
their expectations President
Donald Kennedy stated that
"staff people in some critical
areas are working a lot harder,
and enjoying it less." He then
went on to say that in March we
can expect to hear a "detailed
statement of reductions in ad
ministrative and other services
that have been necessary in or
der to preserve or strengthen
academic programs" (em
phasis mine) It doesn't seem
logical to me that reductions in
services ran ever be dealt with
in a way that would strengthen
academic programs!
This all savs to me that the

University has decided, as poli
cy. to accept the current under
staffing situation and that even
further reductions may be in
store. Kennedy also seems to be
implying in this same report
that if we (nonacademic staff)
were truly "loval" and devoted
"on behalf of our (faculty)
purposes." we would be only too
happy to sacrifice ourselves for
this institution.
The faculty are asked to be
patient, the staff to be loyal and
self-sacrificing I believe that
both would like to have a say
about this situation and a part in
the policymaking. The conse
quences of this policy of chronic
understaffing are immense to
the clerical staff, especially in
terms of our health and well
being. and of our job satisfac
tion As things stand now. we
are in a terrible position: to ac
cept hardship and sacrifice or
leave the University — not hav
ing choices or alternatives. A
union contract will give us the
clout needed to prevent unfair
working conditions for the
clerical staff, and make pos
sible the self-esteem of an adult
relationship with the Univer
sity Reading Kennedy's report
to the Academic Council just
makes me want that union con
tract all the more.
