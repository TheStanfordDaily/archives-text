# Committee reviews operation in special meeting
## Heart-lung transplant approved here 
### Jan Mireles 
A human heart-lung transplant, the
first at Stanford, has been approved by
the Medical School's Committee for
the Protection of Human Subjects in
Research.
The committee approved the
surgery following a special meeting
held Friday. Jan. 23 The meeting to
discuss the protocol of heart-lung
transplants, originally scheduled for
Feb. 3. was moved up in response to
patient need.
"Our first and primary goal is to
protect human subjects," said Dr.
Philip Berger. committee chairman.
"Our second.goal is to make sure new
experimental treatment is not
withheld if we are convinced treat
ment would be helpful to the patient."
Prior to approval of the transplant
for humans, Dr. Bruce Reitz, assis
tant professor of cardiovascular
surgery at the University School of
Medicine, and his associates were re
stricted to experiments with animals.
The new surgery technique had been
performed on a number of rhesus
mohkeys, which were used in the ex
periments because of the similarities
between monkey and human
circulatory systems.
Two of the monkeys receiving the
transplant are still living.
"It's been a year since the surgery

and two animals are reasonably
healthy." Reitz said.
Single heart-lung unit
In a heart-lung transplant, the heart
and lung are removed as a single unit.
"Transplanting the heart and lungs
together is preferable because it is
surgically easier to remove the heart
and lungs as a single package," Reitz
said.
Due to the sensitive nature of the op
eration, very few patients are con
sidered fit to receive a heart-lung
transplant. A patient's case must be
extreme and. once accepted, the pa
tient must be perfectly matched to a
donor.
Though heart-lung transplants may
help patients who have suffered lung
damage as a result of heart disease,
patients with lung cancer are not nec
essarily considered as candidates be
cause other forms of surgery would be
more effective.
"Medically speaking, we are mov
ing toward highly suitable patients
who have few or no alternatives and
are willing to take therisk." explained
Reitz.
Danger of infection
The main danger in heart-lung
transplants is the possibility of infec
tion. Stanford surgeons, however,
hope the effective use of the drug

Cvclosporin-A will minimize the dan
ger of infection.
Cyclosporin-A. according to Reitz.
is a fungal derivative which seems to
impede the immune cells responsible
for rejecting transplanted tissue
without affecting other immune cells
that fight bacterial infection. The drug
was originally developed in Switzer
land,
The problem of infection stems
from this basic need to stop the body's
immune system from rejecting the
transplanted tissues. Dr. Stuart
J amies on. a professor of
cardiovascular surgery and colleague
of Dr. Reitz. explained. "In order to
stop rejection, the patient receives
immune suppressive drugs. But the
drugs also lower the patient's re
sistance to infection." And. according
to Jamieson. delayed healing lessens
the patient's survival chances.
Approval likely
Though risks are a part of the
surgery and follow-up treatment.
Reitz expressed confidence that the
Human Subjects Committee will ap
prove further surgery. "The commit
tee is there to protect the patient. I
don't think there will be a problem
with it (the surgery proposal) pass
ing." Reitz said.

Berger stressed the care that goes
into reviewing the protocol for ap
proving experimental surgery in hu
mans,
"Committee members are given
the opportunity to ask in-depth ques
tions and are thoroughly briefed
before any decision is made," Berger
said. "We weigh the risks and bene
fits. and the benefits have to exceed
the risks."
The committee also has the power
to modify the protocol and make
changes in the inclusion or exclusion
of patients qualifying for treatment.
Locating a donor
Surgeons have not yet identified the
possible recipient of the approved
heart-lung transplant, but say much
depends on locating a donor. "The
donor is the limiting factor. Blood
types have to match and you can't
have even a suggestion of lung infec
tion." explained Jamieson.
Reitz hopes the approved surgery
will lead to further research and
further success. "Eventually there
may be some spin-off. We expect to
gain more general knowledge about
the care of patients and be led to more
research But for now the surgery will
be limited to a very narrow set of cir
cumstances." said Reitz.

ment would be helpful to the patient."
Prior to approval of the transplant
for humans, Dr. Bruce Reitz, assis
tant professor of cardiovascular
surgery at the University School of
Medicine, and his associates were re
stricted to experiments with animals.
The new surgery technique had been
performed on a number of rhesus
mohkeys, which were used in the ex
periments because of the similarities
between monkey and human
circulatory systems.
Two of the monkeys receiving the
transplant are still living.
"It's been a year since the surgery

and two animals are reasonably
healthy." Reitz said.
Single heart-lung unit
In a heart-lung transplant, the heart
and lung are removed as a single unit.
"Transplanting the heart and lungs
together is preferable because it is
surgically easier to remove the heart
and lungs as a single package," Reitz
said.
Due to the sensitive nature of the op
eration, very few patients are con
sidered fit to receive a heart-lung
transplant. A patient's case must be
extreme and. once accepted, the pa
tient must be perfectly matched to a
donor.
Though heart-lung transplants may
help patients who have suffered lung
damage as a result of heart disease,
patients with lung cancer are not nec
essarily considered as candidates be
cause other forms of surgery would be
more effective.
"Medically speaking, we are mov
ing toward highly suitable patients
who have few or no alternatives and
are willing to take therisk." explained
Reitz.
Danger of infection
The main danger in heart-lung
transplants is the possibility of infec
tion. Stanford surgeons, however,
hope the effective use of the drug

Cvclosporin-A will minimize the dan
ger of infection.
Cyclosporin-A. according to Reitz.
is a fungal derivative which seems to
impede the immune cells responsible
for rejecting transplanted tissue
without affecting other immune cells
that fight bacterial infection. The drug
was originally developed in Switzer
land,
The problem of infection stems
from this basic need to stop the body's
immune system from rejecting the
transplanted tissues. Dr. Stuart
J amies on. a professor of
cardiovascular surgery and colleague
of Dr. Reitz. explained. "In order to
stop rejection, the patient receives
immune suppressive drugs. But the
drugs also lower the patient's re
sistance to infection." And. according
to Jamieson. delayed healing lessens
the patient's survival chances.
Approval likely
Though risks are a part of the
surgery and follow-up treatment.
Reitz expressed confidence that the
Human Subjects Committee will ap
prove further surgery. "The commit
tee is there to protect the patient. I
don't think there will be a problem
with it (the surgery proposal) pass
ing." Reitz said.

Berger stressed the care that goes
into reviewing the protocol for ap
proving experimental surgery in hu
mans,
"Committee members are given
the opportunity to ask in-depth ques
tions and are thoroughly briefed
before any decision is made," Berger
said. "We weigh the risks and bene
fits. and the benefits have to exceed
the risks."
The committee also has the power
to modify the protocol and make
changes in the inclusion or exclusion
of patients qualifying for treatment.
Locating a donor
Surgeons have not yet identified the
possible recipient of the approved
heart-lung transplant, but say much
depends on locating a donor. "The
donor is the limiting factor. Blood
types have to match and you can't
have even a suggestion of lung infec
tion." explained Jamieson.
Reitz hopes the approved surgery
will lead to further research and
further success. "Eventually there
may be some spin-off. We expect to
gain more general knowledge about
the care of patients and be led to more
research But for now the surgery will
be limited to a very narrow set of cir
cumstances." said Reitz.
A human heart-lung transplant, the
first at Stanford, has been approved by
the Medical School's Committee for
the Protection of Human Subjects in
Research.
The committee approved the
surgery following a special meeting
held Friday. Jan. 23 The meeting to
discuss the protocol of heart-lung
transplants, originally scheduled for
Feb. 3. was moved up in response to
patient need.
"Our first and primary goal is to
protect human subjects," said Dr.
Philip Berger. committee chairman.
"Our second.goal is to make sure new
experimental treatment is not
withheld if we are convinced treat
ment would be helpful to the patient."
