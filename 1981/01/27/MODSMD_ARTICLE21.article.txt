# Israeli author stresses awareness, risk-taking to combat terrorism

"The public has to understand terrorism
as a sort of war waged against democracy,"
Dr. Sabi Shabtai said Thursday night. The
former member of the Israeli Foreign Ser
vice and an adviser to the U.S. Army told an
attentive audience in Kresge Auditorium
that terrorism is not a global problem, but
one of Western democracies.
Communist governments have a no-non
sense attitude toward terrorism, he said. A
communist government would never make
concessions for hostages and would not even
negotiate.
Shabtai said there are two opposing
schools of thought concerning the threat of
terrorism. The first seeks to minimize the
danger inherent in international terrorism,
while the other school maximizes the dan
ger.
According to the anti-terrorist expert, the
group that maximizes the danger blames
the process of modernization for making
terrorism a dangerous problem. Today a
person can board a 747 with one grenade and
kill many people, an act that long ago would
not have been possible.
Financial support
Another danger is that terrorists receive
tremendous financial support, especially
from oil-rich countries. For example, the
"Black September" group, which was re
sponsible for the attack at the 1972 Munich
Olympics, received a $5 billion bonus from
Libya's Muammur Khadafy, he claimed.
Some terrorists are said to make as much as
$20,000 a month and thus have an economic
stake in perpetuating conflict.

Meanwhile the other group, which min
imizes the danger, says statistics — like
those citing a 2000 percent increase in the
number of deaths per year related to ter
rorists since 1968 — must be looked at in
absolute terms. In the last 12 years the
number of deaths resulting from terrorism
was less than 3000; in opposition, for in
stance, to the almost 3000 homicides in one
year alone in Los Angeles and New York
City.
In addition, this "minimizing" group
points to a marked decline in certain forms
of terrorism. In 1970 there were 50 cases of
hijackings, but only six in 1979. Letter bom
bing has virtually stopped. The number of
PLO operations has also decreased and in
1980 the lowest number of Israelis killed by
terrorists in recent history — 19 — was re
corded.
While Shabtai said he does not disagree
with the minimizing school's statistics, he
said terrorism cannot be looked at in the
conventional way; instead it is psy
chological warfare.
Democracies lost
"In the last decade the West has lost four
democracies in Uruguay, Argentina, Leba
non and Turkey as a direct or indirect result
of acts of terrorism," Shabtai said. He said
that there are only 21 true democracies left
in the world today.
"I believe the most horrifying problem
we face today is the real danger that sooner
or later terrorists may get their hands on

nuclear weapons," Shabtai said.
Shabtai said "I don't fear nuclear ter-'
rorism as a threat to physical survival, but
if it were allowed to take place it may signal
the end of democratic institutions."
He claimed to have seen a plan dealing
with the possibility of a nuclear terrorist at
tack in the United States which said the De
partment of Justice was responsible for re
turning, within six months, civil liberties
and other constitutional rights after an at
tack. Shabtai said he thought it meant that
someone had a contingency plan to take
those rights away.
Shabtai listed four precautions which
would aid the public in dealing with the
question: the public should be educated on
the true dangers inherent in terrorism; the
United States must develop a reliable in
telligence service which would allow the na
tion to pre-empt acts of terrorism; a coun
ter-terrorist force should also be developed
which can act immediately and with sur
gical precision, finally, there should be
more cooperation among Western countries
to combat terrorism.
No guarantees
Speaking about the failed rescue attempt
mission in Iran, Shabtai admitted there is no
way for a rescue mission to guarantee sav
ing all the hostages' and all the rescuers'
lives. No one knew in advance that the En
tebe raid would be so successful, he said.
Shabtai said if action had been taken in
Iran sooner, the chances for success would
have been better.
He said the United States had to be willing
to take more risks.
