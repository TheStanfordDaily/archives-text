A combination of social and
educational events will be part
of the Stanford Jewish Appeal's
(SJA) fundraising campaign
this year, according to chair
person Gail Greenberg.
The SJA is a branch of the
United Jewish Appeal (UJA),
an organization that raises mon
ey for local Jewish communities
and for Israel.
Greenberg said that the pri
mary emphasis of this year's
campaign will not be fundrais
ing but education. "We want to
sensitize Stanford Jews to
what's going on in the Jewish
community around the world,"
she said.
Educational events will in
clude sherry hours and study
breaks, as well as social events
such as the wine and cheese par
ty this Thursday to kick off the
campaign.
SJA consists of a core group
of approximately 40 workers.
Their goal this year is to raise

$10,000, a $2000 increase over
last year necessitated by infla
tion.
Part of the money raised will
go to the San Francisco Jewish
Welfare Federation. This mon
ey stays locally to help sponsor
Jewish homes for the aged, Jew
ish community centers and le
gal counseling and family ser
vices.
The rest of the money will go
to the four agencies UJA sup
ports: the Hebrew Immigrant
Aid Society which transports
Jews from Eastern Europe to
places other than Israel; the
New York Association for New
Americans, which does the
same for people specifically
going to New York; the Joint
Distribution Committee, which
initiates care programs in 30
countries and responds to waves
of anti-semitism; and the Unit
ed Israel Appeal which runs so
cial programs like absorption,
housing and youth education in
Israel.
