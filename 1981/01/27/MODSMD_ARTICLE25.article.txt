# The 						limits of cynicism
## 
### Stephen Nash 
Cynical people are often perceived as being
emotionally embittered to the core, with no
trace of sensitivity left. I think it would be
more accurate to say that they are like
porcupines, using witty remarks like quills to
protect a very soft and tender underbelly:
cynicism offers the protection necessary to
keep emotional pain at a manageable level.
For people out of step with popular mores, it
may be the only protection available.
The International Stud bv Harvey Fierstein
( now at Theatre Rhinoceros) is about just such
a person Arnold, a second-rate drag per
former with the stage name Virginia Hamm, is
looking for a lover. He's young, but aging fast
— and ho knows it. He knows his physical and
emotional assets, he knows what he wants in a
relationship, and he knows his limits. In short,
he's self aware — but self-awareness is the
sine qua nan of a cynic.
Arnold is a terrific cynic. He shoots his witty
quills at anything that moves, and at a lot of
things that don't. After all. it's better to have
folks laughing with you than at you But every
so often, there are glimpses of his underbelly.
Arnold isn't quite comfortable with urban
"combat sex" (a lifestyle typified by the re
mark. "I came out post-Stonewall — I've never
had sex in bed"). He wants romance. So he
never quite gets beyond the front room in a
back-room bar.
It's there that Arnold meets Ed. and falls in
love. The play describes their shaky rela
tionship. mostly from Arnold's point of view
(much of the time the play is a comedy, and
Arnold is easily the better comedian). There
are five scenes, spread over several months,
each introduced by an old popular song. Except
for some dialogue in scenes three and five, the
play is made up completely of monologues.
Daniel Osman plays Arnold with great flair.
He has caught the cynical side of the character
perfectly, accurately timing his punch lines

and displaying good control over the audience
(which he uses as his analyst). Joel Jason (as
Ed) is less effective. Ed is unsure of himself
throughout the play, and that insecurity is defi
nitely brought out in Jason's performance, but
unfortunately, Jason does not yet seem com
fortable with his lines.
I enjoyed the play most during the
monologues. During the two short dialogues all
traces of humor disappear, and the writing be
comes rather melodramatic. It also becomes
less believable. I would have been happier if
something of Arnold the Cynic had remained
during his conversations with Ed.
One of the best ideas that Fierstein had when
he wrote The International Stud was to pre
cede each scene with a song. They stand aloof
from the play: they are sung in a bar setting,
they date from another era (they were written
by such composers as Coward and Gershwin),
and the performers (Nancy Leigh Smith ac
companied by Alan Fricke) appear only during
the songs and do not interact with Arnold and
Ed.
Smith sings the songs using a lot more vibra
to than we are accustomed to today. She has
also for the most part rejected the modern idea
that the singer should impose her personality
on a song. She has let the songs dictate the style
and it works very well. I would have been even
happier had she carried the idea further, giv
ing the songs a very cool surface. Yet Fricke,
accompanying her on the piano, has done just
this. The results are super — his sparse ar
rangements are the musical equivalent of a
dry martini.
The songs may have a cool surface, but
that's just their style. The lyrics describe a
more poignant world of sensitive people and
their disillusionment, and as such, they are
contexts for Arnold's behavior, gently estab
lishing theme and mood. The contrast between
style and substance is a beautiful summing up
of Arnold's character.
