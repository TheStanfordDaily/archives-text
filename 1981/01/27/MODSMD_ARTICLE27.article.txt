## Inside Moves: love among the ruined 
### Steve Vineberg 
As Inside Moves begins, John
Savage is strolling down a street
in San Francisco, his hands in
his pockets and a look of as
sumed nonchalance on his face.
He enters an office building,
ducking into one of the offices
when nobody is looking; then he
heads for the window and leaps
from it.
Director Richard Donner has
shot this sequence wittily: the
audience is jolted when Savage
tries to kill himself because he
seemed to be staking out the
room not planning an exit. (We
expect a far different develop
ment — say, a comic heist.) Be
hind the credits (the letters of
the title float individually into
place) we are shown a montage
of Savage being operated on and
nursed back to health, trying to
put together pieces of his past.
When he emerges from the hos-
Eital, he has a mop of scraggly
air, a beard, a moustache and
John Savage has never looked so
good — he's a demonic Kris
Kristofferson.
I have described the first five
minutes of Inside Moves in
some detail because they are
the only minutes of worth in the
movie; what follows — a
maudlin, crackpot story about
friendship and love among the
physically damaged — is a jolt
of the unpleasant sort. The plot
is outlandish: Rory (Savage),
who now has a bum leg and a
problem in balancing himself

(we are never given a satisfac
tory reason for his suicide at
tempt), wanders into a bar
called Max's, where the bar
tender, Jerry (David Morse),
also sports a game limb and the
regulars — including Bert
Remsen, Harold Russell (the
paraplegic from The Best Years
of ()ur Lives, in his first film ap
pearance in 34 years) and a de
lightful black actor named Bill
Henderson — are all disabled in
some way.
No explanation is given for
the drawing together of these
people. They all seem to live in
the area, so one might assume
that some charity organization
had bought up all the real estate
in the neighborhood and rented
it exclusively to the blind and
the crippled. Jerry lives with
Ann (Amy Wright), who whores
to support her junk habit (aha!
she's an emotional cripple!),
and when he kicks her out
(tearfully), she moves in with a
black pimp named Lucius who
has a laugh that we are clearly
intended to find chilling.
Jerry and Rory become close
buddies, apparently because
Rory was around to witness a
one-on-one shooting match be
tween Jerry and an arrogant pro
basketball player whom Jerry
had been razzing from the
stands. (We know that pro
fessional athletes don't nor
mally accept challenges from
spectators, but Jerry has been
so insistent.) Even though he
limps, Jerry damn near beats

the pro, and for some reason
this creates a bond so strong be
tween Jerry and Rory that Rory
offers his pal $10,000 (an in
heritance) for an operation to
fix his leg.
No reference is made to the
possibility that Rory's leg might
be fixed up, but instead, they
sink the money into the bar,
which is about to close down af
ter years; they want to keep it
open because, Rory explains,
"It's family." (He seems to
have become a member of this
"family" in record time: we are
less than half an hour into the
movie.)
Somehow these two make a
success of the bar (their meth
ods are not obvious) and Ann re
turns to Jerry — for a short
while, before she decides that
she needs more money than he
can provide and sends for
Lucius. The pimp's henchmen
beat Jerry up, and though he
looks half dead when Rory finds
him, he won't allow Rory to call
a doctor (aha! he doesn't want
to live!).
By the time the movie has
reached this pass, one is
stultified. Presumably the
writers, Valerie Curtin and
Barry Levinson, sold the script
on the basis of its upbeat treat
ment of downbeat subject mat
ter and the shavings from the
Rocky movies that are scat
tered liberally through it. But
didn't anyone read it over to see
if it made sense?
It was evident from Curtin

and Levinson's last movie, And
Justice for All, that they
weren't interested in plausibili
ty, either of plot or character,
but Inside Moves is just a long
string of non sequiturs. What
holds it together is bathos — and
the revelatory tirades the char
acters are continually staging.
"You don't need to come by
Max's anymore," Rory tells
Jerry when he has become a ce
lebrity and begun to neglect his
old friends. "We don't need your
kind of cripple there!" "I can't
do it alone!" Jerry cries to the
crowd in the bar, "I'm the most
crippled person in this room!"
Our first glimpses of John
Savage in this movie shouldn't
fool us into thinking that he has
learned how to act. He was
charming in his first few scenes
in Hair and The Onion Field —
he seems to be comfortable
playing rural bumpkins on their
guard in the big city — but when
he has to convey any other emo
tion. besides wariness, he
scrunches up his face and does a
double take for so long that he
seems retarded: he's such a
flamboyantly terrible actor that
giving him a physical handicap
to work with is an act of cruelty
to the audience. Savage may, in
some way, be paying homage to
Brando in this movie, but his
halting diction and confused
facial expressions are really in
the spirit of Charles Laughton's
Hunchback of Notre Dame and
Lon Chaney's Phantom of the
Opera.

black pimp named Lucius who
has a laugh that we are clearly
intended to find chilling.
Jerry and Rory become close
buddies, apparently because
Rory was around to witness a
one-on-one shooting match be
tween Jerry and an arrogant pro
basketball player whom Jerry
had been razzing from the
stands. (We know that pro
fessional athletes don't nor
mally accept challenges from
spectators, but Jerry has been
so insistent.) Even though he
limps, Jerry damn near beats

the pro, and for some reason
this creates a bond so strong be
tween Jerry and Rory that Rory
offers his pal $10,000 (an in
heritance) for an operation to
fix his leg.
No reference is made to the
possibility that Rory's leg might
be fixed up, but instead, they
sink the money into the bar,
which is about to close down af
ter years; they want to keep it
open because, Rory explains,
"It's family." (He seems to
have become a member of this
"family" in record time: we are
less than half an hour into the
movie.)
Somehow these two make a
success of the bar (their meth
ods are not obvious) and Ann re
turns to Jerry — for a short
while, before she decides that
she needs more money than he
can provide and sends for
Lucius. The pimp's henchmen
beat Jerry up, and though he
looks half dead when Rory finds
him, he won't allow Rory to call
a doctor (aha! he doesn't want
to live!).
By the time the movie has
reached this pass, one is
stultified. Presumably the
writers, Valerie Curtin and
Barry Levinson, sold the script
on the basis of its upbeat treat
ment of downbeat subject mat
ter and the shavings from the
Rocky movies that are scat
tered liberally through it. But
didn't anyone read it over to see
if it made sense?
It was evident from Curtin

and Levinson's last movie, And
Justice for All, that they
weren't interested in plausibili
ty, either of plot or character,
but Inside Moves is just a long
string of non sequiturs. What
holds it together is bathos — and
the revelatory tirades the char
acters are continually staging.
"You don't need to come by
Max's anymore," Rory tells
Jerry when he has become a ce
lebrity and begun to neglect his
old friends. "We don't need your
kind of cripple there!" "I can't
do it alone!" Jerry cries to the
crowd in the bar, "I'm the most
crippled person in this room!"
Our first glimpses of John
Savage in this movie shouldn't
fool us into thinking that he has
learned how to act. He was
charming in his first few scenes
in Hair and The Onion Field —
he seems to be comfortable
playing rural bumpkins on their
guard in the big city — but when
he has to convey any other emo
tion. besides wariness, he
scrunches up his face and does a
double take for so long that he
seems retarded: he's such a
flamboyantly terrible actor that
giving him a physical handicap
to work with is an act of cruelty
to the audience. Savage may, in
some way, be paying homage to
Brando in this movie, but his
halting diction and confused
facial expressions are really in
the spirit of Charles Laughton's
Hunchback of Notre Dame and
Lon Chaney's Phantom of the
Opera.
As Inside Moves begins, John
Savage is strolling down a street
in San Francisco, his hands in
his pockets and a look of as
sumed nonchalance on his face.
He enters an office building,
ducking into one of the offices
when nobody is looking; then he
heads for the window and leaps
from it.
Director Richard Donner has
shot this sequence wittily: the
audience is jolted when Savage
tries to kill himself because he
seemed to be staking out the
room not planning an exit. (We
expect a far different develop
ment — say, a comic heist.) Be
hind the credits (the letters of
the title float individually into
place) we are shown a montage
of Savage being operated on and
nursed back to health, trying to
put together pieces of his past.
When he emerges from the hos-
Eital, he has a mop of scraggly
air, a beard, a moustache and
John Savage has never looked so
good — he's a demonic Kris
Kristofferson.
I have described the first five
minutes of Inside Moves in
some detail because they are
the only minutes of worth in the
movie; what follows — a
maudlin, crackpot story about
friendship and love among the
physically damaged — is a jolt
of the unpleasant sort. The plot
is outlandish: Rory (Savage),
who now has a bum leg and a
problem in balancing himself

(we are never given a satisfac
tory reason for his suicide at
tempt), wanders into a bar
called Max's, where the bar
tender, Jerry (David Morse),
also sports a game limb and the
regulars — including Bert
Remsen, Harold Russell (the
paraplegic from The Best Years
of ()ur Lives, in his first film ap
pearance in 34 years) and a de
lightful black actor named Bill
Henderson — are all disabled in
some way.
No explanation is given for
the drawing together of these
people. They all seem to live in
the area, so one might assume
that some charity organization
had bought up all the real estate
in the neighborhood and rented
it exclusively to the blind and
the crippled. Jerry lives with
Ann (Amy Wright), who whores
to support her junk habit (aha!
she's an emotional cripple!),
and when he kicks her out
(tearfully), she moves in with a
black pimp named Lucius who
has a laugh that we are clearly
intended to find chilling.
