# Loulou: chemically imbalanced

### Steve Vineberg 
Gerard Depardieu is such an open, ap
pealing actor that we are drawn immediate
ly and powerfully to any character he plays.
He's like Brando in his Stanley Kowalski-
Terry Malloy days (before he showed that
he could play very bright men, too): his
characters are almost purely sensual —
there is something primitive, half-formed
about them. His most memorable ap
pearances so far have been in the two
Bertrand Blier pictures that teamed him
with Patrick Dewaere, Going Places (Les
Valseuses) and Get <>ut Your Hand
kerchiefs.
Depardieu and Dewaere are an inspired
vaudeville act: Depardieu's athletic body
and peasant face contrast with Dewaere's
Left Bank intellectual looks. In Hand
kerchiefs both actors played bumblers, con
tinually deluded in their search for the one
thing that would make the woman they both
loved (Carole Laure) happy. The two per
formances were richly comic, and poignant
besides, the miserable pair sweated to
please Laure, but they had so little insight
that when they did, inadvertently, provide
her with an antidote to her gloom, they
didn't even realize that she was using it to
shut them out of her life completely.
Not all of Depardieu's movies have been
shown in this country and many of them —
1900, Vincent, Francois, Paul and the Oth
ers and Harocco — don't give him much op

portunity to demonstrate his gifts, so that
LouUm, in which he plays the title role, a
shaggy ex-con in a chocolate-colored
leather jacket, may be worth seeing. He is
very sexy in it, and very funny: in one scene,
he dismisses a lovely, pouty girl who adores
him (Frederique Cerbonnet) and closes the
front door on her; reconsidering, he opens
up, grabs a basket of stuffed tomatoes from
her hands, and shuts the door again.
Loulou is cheerfully amoral, but not of
fensive so; he doesn't appear to have
evolved past his instincts. His pleasure in
food, liquor and sex is so enormous and un
disguised that we feel it would be cruel to
deprive him of it. We laugh when, in the
midst of making love to one woman, he is
confronted by a second who needs a place to
sleep, and we can see him sizing her up as
she undresses — anticipating a double treat
like a child presented with two hot fudge
sundaes.
For the purposes of the director, Maurice
Pialat, the casting of Depardieu was proba
bly a mistake. Lnulnu seems intended to be
about empty people who lead aborted lives,
but Depardieu is so life-embracing that the
signals get crossed — and we in the audience
are grateful for the error, of course. Pialat
is not untalented: the ambience of underlit
bars, bars that feel crowded even when only
three people are in them, bars in which high
pitched classical jazz is played by long
haired stoners, is not easily evoked with
such consistency. But the photography, in

tense with shadows and so underdeveloped
that the actors look anemic, is enervating
after a little while. We can see that Pialat
has been influenced by the French New
Wave directors and by Last Tango in Paris,
but l.oiilmi is glum and amorphous; except
for the title character, the most distinctive
quality about the people in the movie is what
brand of cigarettes they smoke.
Depardieu upsets the balance of the film
in another way as well. Cast opposite him is
the stoic Isabelle Huppert, and his vivacity
cancels her out. Huppert is sexy, too, and
their relationship gets off to an auspicious
start: they break the bed the first time they
make love. But what do so many critics see
in Huppert's acting that I can't locate?
In her first major performance, in Claude
Goretta's The [,acemaker. Huppert was a
beautiful cipher that the director tried to
use to embody his message: we don't know
what goes on under the surface of quiet, pas
sive people. The problem was that Huppert
was so inexpressive that I couldn't believe
that anything was happening inside, and
when Claude Chabrol played the same trick
with her in Violette, this time casting her as
a murderess who betrays no sign of her true
personality, the game, became tiresome.
Only one director has coaxed a performance
from her so far — Godard, in Every Man for
Himself, who gave her a hard edge and
made her ennui chilling. In Lnulou we're
back to the cipher.
