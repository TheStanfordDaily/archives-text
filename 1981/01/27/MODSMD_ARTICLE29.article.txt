Polish students want more freedom
Warsaw, Poland — Thousands of students were reported
yesterday to have occupied a building at the University of
Lodz to demand abolition of compulsory classes in Marx
ism, raising new tensions in Communist Poland.
The sit-in by over 2000 students, reported by student
sources, came as farmers in southern Poland warned of
new strikes if an "authorized" government team failed to
appear today to discuss demands for a rural version of Sol
idarity, the independent union.
Meanwhile, the state-run press launched what appeared
to be a campaign against Solidarity, the movement born
when strikes flared last summer over a steep rise in meat
prices and now claiming 10 million members.
The student protest in Poland's second largest city was
aimed at what a spokesman called "full independence" of
Polish universities. It added to the wave of labor and
farmer protests that have sparked fears of possible Soviet
intervention.
Student demands include autonomy of some student
groups from the government Education Ministry, keeping
police off campus unless permitted by university officials,
and access to printing facilities.
Moslem summit aims at Israeli exit
Taif, Saudi Arabia — Leaders of the Moslem world yes
terday took up a resolution aimed at forcing Israel to end
its occupation of Arab territory and to beef up the military
strength of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
A draft copy of the resolution by Islamic foreign min
isters presented on the second day of the summit was ob
tained by The Associated Press.
The resolution's strategy is to pressure Israel's friends
into forcing the Jewish state to give up Arab land occupied
during the 1967 Mideast War. It speaks of "freezing" Is
raeli membership in the United Nations, but does not
elaborate on what measures might be tried short of at
tempting to expel Israel from the world body — an action
that would face a U.S. veto.
"Islamic states would use all their military, political,
economic and natural resources — including oil — as an
effective means for upholding the natural, inalienable
rights of the Palestinian people," says the document.
If approved by the 28 heads of state and top-level repre
sentatives from nine other Arab, African and Asian na
tions, the Islamic states would pledge to give "military ex
pertise and equipment" to Yasser Arafat's PLO.
Libya and Iran are boycotting the summit.
Kelly convicted in Abscam case
Washington — Former Florida Congressman Richard
Kelly and two co-defendar.ts were convicted in U.S. Dis
trict Court here yesterday of conspiracy and bribery
charges stemming from the FBl's controversial Abscam
undercover "sting" operation. ,
The jury's verdict closed out the government's prose
cution of six House members — of which Kelly was the
only Republican — and an assortment of middlemen who
were captured on FBI video and audio tapes in an
elaborate hoax in which agents posed as front men for fic
titious Arab sheiks willing to pay for legislative favors. All
the congressmen were convicted, but only one. Rep. Ray
mond Lederer (D-Pa.), is still in the House.
The seventh and final Abscam criminal case is pending
against Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J ).
The jury's decision followed a seven-week trial before
Chief Judge William Bryant during which the government
played a videotape that showed Kelly stuffing $25,000 into
his pockets during a meeting with an FBI undercover
agent at a Washington townhouse in January 1980.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Adelman called Kelly's
defense "a sham" and told the jury that any "honest politi
cian" would have turned aside the bribe immediately.

Court rules trial coverage legal
Washington — States are free to allow radio, television
and still-photography coverage of criminal trials even
when defendants object, a unanimous Supreme Court
ruled yesterday.
The court said such broadcast and photographic cov
erage does not automatically interfere with a defendant's
right to a fair trial.
"An absolute constitutional ban on broadcast coverage
of trials cannot be justified simply because there is a dan
ger that, in some cases, prejudicial broadcast accounts of
pretrial and trial events may impair the ability of jurors to
decide the issue of guilt or innocence uninfluenced by ex
traneous matter," Chief Justice Warren Burger said.
The decision, while a momentous victory for the news
media, did not extend any new "right of access.'' Instead.
Burger's opinion emphasized that "states must be free to
experiment" with photo and broadcast coverage.
More than half the states have decided, on either a per
manent or an experimental basis, to allow some camera
and microphone coverage of court proceedings. Not all
these states, however, have allowed coverage of criminal
trials over a defendant's objection.
Now that the court has ruled that the presence of camer
as and microphones do not automatically taint a fair trial,
it appears inevitable that state policies not allowing the
same criminal trial access as Florida will come under con
stitutional attack.
AFL-CIO to consider early support
Washington — AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland plans
to ask his executive council next month to set up machin
ery for a pre-primary endorsement of a Democratic presi
dential candidate in 1984. authoritative sources said yes
terday.
Such a step — which could dramatically alter the
dynamics of the next Democratic presidential contest — is
expected to draw little opposition when the executive
council meets in Florida starting Feb. 16. Kirkland plans
to offer the alternatives of having the endorsement made
either by the 35-member executive council or by the gener
al board. which includes a representative of each AFL-CIO
union.
The AFL-CIO has traditionally withheld its endorse
ment of a presidential candidate until after the parties
have made their nominations. In 1980. member unions split
their endorsements between former-president Jimmy
Carter and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), often negat
ing each others' efforts.
Among Democratic Party politicians who are aware of
the impending Kirkland move, the speculation is that the
likeliest beneficiaries of a labor endorsement would be
either Kennedy or former vice president Walter Mondale.
What no one doubts is that the possibility of a pre-prima
ry endorsement by the labor federation would change the
character of the i984 nomination fight. It would be very
difficult for any relatively unknown and underfinanced
candidate to match these resources in early primaries and
caucuses.
Dow Jones slides one point

AFL-CIO to consider early support
Washington — AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland plans
to ask his executive council next month to set up machin
ery for a pre-primary endorsement of a Democratic presi
dential candidate in 1984. authoritative sources said yes
terday.
Such a step — which could dramatically alter the
dynamics of the next Democratic presidential contest — is
expected to draw little opposition when the executive
council meets in Florida starting Feb. 16. Kirkland plans
to offer the alternatives of having the endorsement made
either by the 35-member executive council or by the gener
al board. which includes a representative of each AFL-CIO
union.
The AFL-CIO has traditionally withheld its endorse
ment of a presidential candidate until after the parties
have made their nominations. In 1980. member unions split
their endorsements between former-president Jimmy
Carter and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), often negat
ing each others' efforts.
Among Democratic Party politicians who are aware of
the impending Kirkland move, the speculation is that the
likeliest beneficiaries of a labor endorsement would be
either Kennedy or former vice president Walter Mondale.
What no one doubts is that the possibility of a pre-prima
ry endorsement by the labor federation would change the
character of the i984 nomination fight. It would be very
difficult for any relatively unknown and underfinanced
candidate to match these resources in early primaries and
caucuses.

Polish students want more freedom
Warsaw, Poland — Thousands of students were reported
yesterday to have occupied a building at the University of
Lodz to demand abolition of compulsory classes in Marx
ism, raising new tensions in Communist Poland.
The sit-in by over 2000 students, reported by student
sources, came as farmers in southern Poland warned of
new strikes if an "authorized" government team failed to
appear today to discuss demands for a rural version of Sol
idarity, the independent union.
Meanwhile, the state-run press launched what appeared
to be a campaign against Solidarity, the movement born
when strikes flared last summer over a steep rise in meat
prices and now claiming 10 million members.
The student protest in Poland's second largest city was
aimed at what a spokesman called "full independence" of
Polish universities. It added to the wave of labor and
farmer protests that have sparked fears of possible Soviet
intervention.
Student demands include autonomy of some student
groups from the government Education Ministry, keeping
police off campus unless permitted by university officials,
and access to printing facilities.
Moslem summit aims at Israeli exit
Taif, Saudi Arabia — Leaders of the Moslem world yes
terday took up a resolution aimed at forcing Israel to end
its occupation of Arab territory and to beef up the military
strength of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
A draft copy of the resolution by Islamic foreign min
isters presented on the second day of the summit was ob
tained by The Associated Press.
The resolution's strategy is to pressure Israel's friends
into forcing the Jewish state to give up Arab land occupied
during the 1967 Mideast War. It speaks of "freezing" Is
raeli membership in the United Nations, but does not
elaborate on what measures might be tried short of at
tempting to expel Israel from the world body — an action
that would face a U.S. veto.
"Islamic states would use all their military, political,
economic and natural resources — including oil — as an
effective means for upholding the natural, inalienable
rights of the Palestinian people," says the document.
If approved by the 28 heads of state and top-level repre
sentatives from nine other Arab, African and Asian na
tions, the Islamic states would pledge to give "military ex
pertise and equipment" to Yasser Arafat's PLO.
Libya and Iran are boycotting the summit.
Kelly convicted in Abscam case
Washington — Former Florida Congressman Richard
Kelly and two co-defendar.ts were convicted in U.S. Dis
trict Court here yesterday of conspiracy and bribery
charges stemming from the FBl's controversial Abscam
undercover "sting" operation. ,
The jury's verdict closed out the government's prose
cution of six House members — of which Kelly was the
only Republican — and an assortment of middlemen who
were captured on FBI video and audio tapes in an
elaborate hoax in which agents posed as front men for fic
titious Arab sheiks willing to pay for legislative favors. All
the congressmen were convicted, but only one. Rep. Ray
mond Lederer (D-Pa.), is still in the House.
The seventh and final Abscam criminal case is pending
against Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J ).
The jury's decision followed a seven-week trial before
Chief Judge William Bryant during which the government
played a videotape that showed Kelly stuffing $25,000 into
his pockets during a meeting with an FBI undercover
agent at a Washington townhouse in January 1980.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Adelman called Kelly's
defense "a sham" and told the jury that any "honest politi
cian" would have turned aside the bribe immediately.

Court rules trial coverage legal
Washington — States are free to allow radio, television
and still-photography coverage of criminal trials even
when defendants object, a unanimous Supreme Court
ruled yesterday.
The court said such broadcast and photographic cov
erage does not automatically interfere with a defendant's
right to a fair trial.
"An absolute constitutional ban on broadcast coverage
of trials cannot be justified simply because there is a dan
ger that, in some cases, prejudicial broadcast accounts of
pretrial and trial events may impair the ability of jurors to
decide the issue of guilt or innocence uninfluenced by ex
traneous matter," Chief Justice Warren Burger said.
The decision, while a momentous victory for the news
media, did not extend any new "right of access.'' Instead.
Burger's opinion emphasized that "states must be free to
experiment" with photo and broadcast coverage.
More than half the states have decided, on either a per
manent or an experimental basis, to allow some camera
and microphone coverage of court proceedings. Not all
these states, however, have allowed coverage of criminal
trials over a defendant's objection.
Now that the court has ruled that the presence of camer
as and microphones do not automatically taint a fair trial,
it appears inevitable that state policies not allowing the
same criminal trial access as Florida will come under con
