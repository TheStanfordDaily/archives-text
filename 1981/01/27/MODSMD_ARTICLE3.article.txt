# Former U.S. hostages experience freedom

From the Daily wire services
West Point, N.Y. â€” Overwhelmed
by the emotional depth of their wel
come home. America's freed hostages
tentatively tested their fragile new
wings of freedom during their first full
day back on American soil yesterday.
Beneath a chilly gray sky. some of
them jogged about the grounds of the
U.S. Military Academy, where they
were housed in seclusion after being
reunited with their families Sunday.
Many attended a special religious
service arranged for them at the
academy chapel. A group of seven vis
ited an elementary school, and a few
ventured forth from their hotel sanc
tuary to chat with reporters.
One of the hostages. Kathryn Koob.
43. of Fairfax, Va,, said: "It's like
having a bath in love. We'll soak in it
for hours."
Koob had ventured 100 yards down
the drive from the Thayer Hotel to
chat with newsmen congregated at the
academy gate, kept there by military
police to protect the privacy of the ho
tel's special, and only, guests.
Asked if she was eager to get home,
she said: "We are home We are here.
We're with our families. We made it."
Koob and the other female hostage.
Elizabeth Ann Swift. 40. of Washing
ton, D C., talked cheerily and seemed
to be relaxed.
Condition
In Washington, however. Secretary
of State Alexander Haig. reported to
President Ronald Reagan on the
former hostages' condition, and said a
dozen of them have suffered "severe
damage." primarily psychological,
and that many had expressed concern
about their future careers with the

federal government.
Word on their careers, interrupted
by the Iranian seizure of the American
Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4. 1979, is
"something these people really want
to hear." said White House press sec
retary James Brady.
President Reagan will roll out the
red carpet for the freed American
hostages today and. in welcoming re
marks at a White House reception, try
to ease their concerns that their ca
reers have suffered because of their
captivity in Iran.
The president also will touch broad
ly on what his reaction might be if
American hostages are ever seized
again by terrorists. Brady said yester
day.
Thanksgiving
But the tone of the day will be more
one of national thanksgiving, Brady
said, than of an official enunciation of
a new Reagan doctrine on hostages
and terrorists. Such a doctrine still is
in the preparation stage.
Indeed, there were signs at West
Point of the wounds that some of the
former hostages may have incurred
during the 444 days of their harsh im
prisonment by Iranian terrorists. One
former hostage had told a reporter
that he would meet with him Monday,
but later sent word that he was de
pressed and apprehensive about fac
ing the gauntlet of newsmen, and had
decided to remain silent on his ordeal
for two more weeks.
Another, Richard Moorfield. 51. of
San Diego, who was the U.S. consul
general in Tehran, emerged from the
government-owned Thayer Hotel for a
stretch and some fresh air and was
hailed by reporters.
Moorfield strolled over and said.
it's great to be back " But then he
added. "Look. I'm obviously wound
up Let me go on back and spend the
rest of the time with the family. Give
me some time to sort of come into this
gradually."
Business as usual
Even before the freed U. S hostages
touched American soil two days ago,
many American companies received
requests from Iran to resume "busi
ness as usual." administration
sources said yesterday.
Iranian firms have sent Telex
messages asking for a range of goods
from animal feedstuffs to industrial
gas turbines to safety valves for heat
ing and plumbing, companies re
vealed yesterday.
Many U. S. firms havecontacted the
Commerce Department and Treasury
in the last week to find out whether
they may now start trading again with
Iran
The speed with which Iranian firms
have acted suggests that the trade em
bargo imposed last April has been bit
ing It also dramatizes the decision
that Reagan must make about wheth
er to uphold the agreement with Iran
signed bv Jimmy Carter the day
before he left office.
Technically this lifted the trade em
bargo. the Commerce Department
said yesterday. But it has been cau
tioning firms that since the agreement
is known to be under review by the new
administration, it might be wise to
wait for an official announcement
before resuming trade.
Reagan has to decide whether to
normalize business relations with Iran
despite the political distaste he may
feel over this, or whether to upset
those firms that want to start making
money on Iranian trade again. Eu
ropean countries and Japan lifted
their trade sanctions against Iran last
week An announcement on U. S. poli
cy is expected in the next week or two.
according to of the companies
involved.
Several firms contacted yesterdav

said that they will not reply to Iranian
requests and will not start shipping
any goods without an official go
ahead
Others said it was "premature" to
talk about resuming trade as long as
other arrangements, chiefly the set
tlement of outstanding claims against
Iran, were unresolved Some 388 firms
that had significant interests in Iran
before the hostages were taken are
now claiming about $3 billion, admin
istration officials said Monday.
Larger firms, such as E.I. duPont in
the chemical field, which did a lot of
business with Iran but have lost mon
ey there, seem more concerned about
reclaiming that than about starting to
do business again. An administration
official said that the claimant firms
are more vocal than the would-be
traders so far.
A spokesman for duPont said yes
terday the company had had no over
tures from Iran, and that it was "too
soon to tell what our position would
be" about trading again. Another per
son in the company said he could not
imagine a resumption of trade after
what had happened.
International Harvester, the largest
truck manufacturer in the United
States, said that the companv had re
cently been asked to supply Iran with
industrial gas turbines, but that it was
"not doing business with them at this
time." The spokesman would not say
whether this was for legal or other
reasons but added that it was "prima
rily an internal decision."
A spokesman for Raytheon Co. in
Boston said it had not received any tel
egrams and had "no plans to resume
trade with Iran in the foreseeable
future."
On the other hand. Watts Regulator
Corp.. a medium-sized company in
Lawrence. Mass.. would like to start
supplying Iran again with the safety
and control valves that it makes for
heating and plumbing. Several Iranian
firms have approached the company
since last week, according to Paul
Richie, export manager.
