# Former U.S. hostages experience freedom

From the Daily wire services
West Point, N.Y. â€” Overwhelmed
by the emotional depth of their wel
come home. America's freed hostages
tentatively tested their fragile new
wings of freedom during their first full
day back on American soil yesterday.
Beneath a chilly gray sky. some of
them jogged about the grounds of the
U.S. Military Academy, where they
were housed in seclusion after being
reunited with their families Sunday.
Many attended a special religious
service arranged for them at the
academy chapel. A group of seven vis
ited an elementary school, and a few
ventured forth from their hotel sanc
tuary to chat with reporters.
One of the hostages. Kathryn Koob.
43. of Fairfax, Va,, said: "It's like
having a bath in love. We'll soak in it
for hours."
Koob had ventured 100 yards down
the drive from the Thayer Hotel to
chat with newsmen congregated at the
academy gate, kept there by military
police to protect the privacy of the ho
tel's special, and only, guests.
Asked if she was eager to get home,
she said: "We are home We are here.
We're with our families. We made it."
Koob and the other female hostage.
Elizabeth Ann Swift. 40. of Washing
ton, D C., talked cheerily and seemed
to be relaxed.
Condition
In Washington, however. Secretary
of State Alexander Haig. reported to
President Ronald Reagan on the
former hostages' condition, and said a
dozen of them have suffered "severe
damage." primarily psychological,
and that many had expressed concern
about their future careers with the

federal government.
Word on their careers, interrupted
by the Iranian seizure of the American
Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4. 1979, is
"something these people really want
to hear." said White House press sec
retary James Brady.
President Reagan will roll out the
red carpet for the freed American
hostages today and. in welcoming re
marks at a White House reception, try
to ease their concerns that their ca
reers have suffered because of their
captivity in Iran.
The president also will touch broad
ly on what his reaction might be if
American hostages are ever seized
again by terrorists. Brady said yester
day.
Thanksgiving
But the tone of the day will be more
one of national thanksgiving, Brady
said, than of an official enunciation of
a new Reagan doctrine on hostages
and terrorists. Such a doctrine still is
in the preparation stage.
Indeed, there were signs at West
Point of the wounds that some of the
former hostages may have incurred
during the 444 days of their harsh im
prisonment by Iranian terrorists. One
former hostage had told a reporter
that he would meet with him Monday,
but later sent word that he was de
pressed and apprehensive about fac
ing the gauntlet of newsmen, and had
decided to remain silent on his ordeal
for two more weeks.
Another, Richard Moorfield. 51. of
San Diego, who was the U.S. consul
general in Tehran, emerged from the
government-owned Thayer Hotel for a
stretch and some fresh air and was
hailed by reporters.
Moorfield strolled over and said.
