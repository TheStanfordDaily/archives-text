A Sunday night fire in the basement
of the Varian physics building dam
aged some of the sources of the Van de
Graaf tandem accelerator, but "for
tunately didn't touch the ac
celerator." according to Adminis
trative Officer Dina Polyhronakis.
No injuries were reported from the
fire, which occurred late at night.
"The source was being shut down,
and it must have gotten very hot. Ap
parently some of the insulation caught
fire." said Polyhronakis.
Some of the adjacent equipment
was also damaged due to water from
the sprinklers. The main accelerator,

however, is in the next room, and was
not affected.
The extent of the damage has not
been assessed, according to Ed
Dillard. head technician of the ac
celerator.
"Some of the parts have to be dried
out before a full damage report can be
made," he said. He added that this
may take several days.
Polyhronakis said she assumed the
damage is covered by some general in
surance policy through the Univer
sity. She also said that a more thor
ough investigation will be conducted
to determine the exact cause of the
blaze.
