# University agrees to election for clericals
## 
### Eric Cornell 
Stanford's 2000 office workers will
vote May 7 on whether to unionize. Un
der the mediation of the National La
bor Relations Board (NLRB). nego
tiators from the University and the Of
fice Staff Organizing Committee
(OSOC) reached an agreement last
Friday on the spring representative
elections.
OSOC organizer Betsy Murray said
she is satisfied with the agreement.
She also expressed confidence that the
vote will go in favor of the union
"We're going to win." she declared
University Associate Counsel Ross
Campbell also said he is satisfied with
the outcome of the negotiations to this
point "Any time you are in an ad
versarial situation, it is nice to come
to an agreement, " Campbell said.
OSOC has contended that the wages
clerical workers receive are not satis
factory. "The University expects to
get high-quality professors and high
quality staff." Murray charged "But
they pay top money for their pro
fessors and want to find their staff at a
discount."
Other issues
OSOC members also stress that
wage levels are not the only reason for
unionizing. "The union means job se
curity and improved working condi
tions." said Kathv McKennan "Most
of all. it means having some control
over your work."
Another issue which clerical work
ers feel will be clarified with union
representation is the question of job
reclassification, said OSOC Chair
person Joyce Tipps-Coats. "People
who feel thev are doing high-level
work are unable to get their job re
classified at a higher level," she said
"In many cases as soon as they leave
their posts by being transferred or
promoted, the positions are im
mediately reclassified at the higher
level."
OSOC has been attempting to or
ganize workers at SLAC. the Medical
Center, and on the main campus for

over a year and a half. By last Novem
ber. OSOC had collected over 1100 au
thorization cards.
Recognition request
At that point. OSOC planned to go
directly to the University for recog
nition." "On rare occasions man
agement will do this. And since we had
such overwhelming support, we
thought it was worth a try," Murray
said.
The University, however, turned
OSOC down even before they had
made their request. Murray said. So
OSOC submitted the cards to the
NLRB which scheduled hearings to re
solve conflicts between the University
and OSOC
According to Campbell, the basic
conflict revolved around who should
be permitted to vote in any unioniza
tion poll Under NLRB regulations,
people holding supervisorial positions
are not permitted to participate in
bargaining units because of "obvious
conflict of interest problems."
Campbell said. "The month-long hear
ings dealt largely with clarifying who
was to be considered supervisorial."
Library workers
Tipps-Coats said another bone of
contention was whether library work
ers were to be included in the bargain
ing unit. "The University at first
claimed that library workers were in a
different community of interest."
said Tipps-Coats. "They later re
versed that position."
By Friday these issues and others
were resolved and an agreement was
reached If a majority of the office
workers who vote this May suppport
the union. the clerical workers will be
come a part of United Stanford Em
ployees (USE), a chapter of Local 715.
