# California utilities' role will change in future

### Kathy Bodovitz 
In the future, California's utilities
will most likely see a combination of
deregulation, full-service corpo
rations, and government ownership,
according to John Bryson, chairman
of the California Public Utilities Com
mission (PUC).
Speaking yesterday to an audience
of about 50 people at a energy seminar
sponsored by the Mechanical Engi
neering department, Bryson said the
role of utilities may well change in the
future, since public utilities are in a
different condition today than they
were during the 1950s and 19605.
Thirty years ago the utilities were
rapidly growing, he said, and were not
subject to much regulation. Fuel costs
were decreasing and electric and gas
rates were declining. Electricity de
mand growth was 7 percent per year
through the '50s and '60s, and the utili
ties were very prosperous.
But Bryson said in the last decade
demand has been almost completely
reversed as the cost of fuel has risen
dramatically. California electricity
rates went up 32 percent faster than
inflation in the period 1970 to 1979, he
said, while the rate of growth in elec
tricity slowed down by 70 percent.
Cost of debt rising
In addition, investors today look
less favorably on utilities because of

increased risk. Bryson said, and the
value of stockholders' shares is
diluted. Thus, he said, "The cost of
debt for utilities has roughly tripled
since 1970."
The cost of construction for utilities
has also increased, Bryson said, not
ing that over 40 percent of the utilities'
capital is now tied up in construction,
an unprecedented percentage.
"Energy conservation is by far the
cheapest way to meet energy require
ments in California today," Bryson
concluded, adding that the PUC calcu
lates that it costs twice as much to
produce electricity from a new coal
power plant as it does to save an
equivalent amount of energy by put
ting ceiling insulation into homes.
"The PUC has sought to encourage
increased energy conservation and the
accelerated development of small
scale power technologies in our utility
energy system" by radically reform
ing the rate structure and encouraging
utilities to provide conservation-re
lated services, Bryson said.
Encouraging 'small power'
The commission is also seeking to
encourage small-scale power technol
ogy. and to arrange provisions where
by independent small power pro
ducers will be able to compete directly
with utilities.
Bryson explained three possible
scenarios in the future of the utilities.

John Rrvson, chairman of the California Public Utilities Commission, spoke at
Skilling Auditorium yesterday on the role of utilities in meeting energy needs.
The first is deregulation. The theory
behind this is that if alternative firms
can produce energy more cheaply
than the utilities, they should be al
lowed to compete.
But, he said, complete deregulation
would put utilities in direct competi
tion with other suppliers, and the utili
ties would likely divest themselves of
energy generation and provide only
transmission and distribution, which
involve less risk.
Full-service corporations
A second possibility is that utilities
will act as full-service corporations,
Bryson said. He said proponents of
this plan advocate relying on the exist
ing infrastructures of the utilities for
new construction measures and cost
effective conservation. These may
provide new avenues of growth and al
leviate monetary problems.
Bryson said the third possibility is
public ownership of the utilities. One
advantage of this idea is that rate
payers would be relieved of the in
creasing burden of new programs and
risks.
So which is the best system? Bryson
predicted the future will see a com
bination of the three. "One scenario
that I think is very foreseeable is one
in which both electric and gas prod
uction become largely unregulated
market activities, transmission lines
and pipelines continue to be regulated,
and local distribution companies are
municipally owned service corpor
rations."

ties were very prosperous.
But Bryson said in the last decade
demand has been almost completely
reversed as the cost of fuel has risen
dramatically. California electricity
rates went up 32 percent faster than
inflation in the period 1970 to 1979, he
said, while the rate of growth in elec
tricity slowed down by 70 percent.
Cost of debt rising
In addition, investors today look
less favorably on utilities because of

increased risk. Bryson said, and the
value of stockholders' shares is
diluted. Thus, he said, "The cost of
debt for utilities has roughly tripled
since 1970."
The cost of construction for utilities
has also increased, Bryson said, not
ing that over 40 percent of the utilities'
capital is now tied up in construction,
an unprecedented percentage.
"Energy conservation is by far the
cheapest way to meet energy require
ments in California today," Bryson
concluded, adding that the PUC calcu
lates that it costs twice as much to
produce electricity from a new coal
power plant as it does to save an
equivalent amount of energy by put
ting ceiling insulation into homes.
"The PUC has sought to encourage
increased energy conservation and the
accelerated development of small
scale power technologies in our utility
energy system" by radically reform
ing the rate structure and encouraging
utilities to provide conservation-re
lated services, Bryson said.
Encouraging 'small power'
The commission is also seeking to
encourage small-scale power technol
ogy. and to arrange provisions where
by independent small power pro
ducers will be able to compete directly
with utilities.
Bryson explained three possible
scenarios in the future of the utilities.

John Rrvson, chairman of the California Public Utilities Commission, spoke at
Skilling Auditorium yesterday on the role of utilities in meeting energy needs.
The first is deregulation. The theory
behind this is that if alternative firms
can produce energy more cheaply
than the utilities, they should be al
lowed to compete.
But, he said, complete deregulation
would put utilities in direct competi
tion with other suppliers, and the utili
ties would likely divest themselves of
energy generation and provide only
transmission and distribution, which
involve less risk.
Full-service corporations
A second possibility is that utilities
will act as full-service corporations,
Bryson said. He said proponents of
this plan advocate relying on the exist
ing infrastructures of the utilities for
new construction measures and cost
effective conservation. These may
provide new avenues of growth and al
leviate monetary problems.
Bryson said the third possibility is
public ownership of the utilities. One
advantage of this idea is that rate
payers would be relieved of the in
creasing burden of new programs and
risks.
So which is the best system? Bryson
predicted the future will see a com
bination of the three. "One scenario
that I think is very foreseeable is one
in which both electric and gas prod
uction become largely unregulated
market activities, transmission lines
and pipelines continue to be regulated,
and local distribution companies are
municipally owned service corpor
rations."
