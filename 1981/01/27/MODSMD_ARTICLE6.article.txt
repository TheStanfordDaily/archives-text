## Mexico opposes U.S. aid policy 
### Washington Post 
Mexico City — Three weeks
after President Ronald Reagan
visited Mexico to demonstrate
his good neighborliness, rela
tions between the two countries
are already being tested by the
conservative swing of Washing
ton's policy toward Central
America.
Last week Mexican officials
sharply criticized the U.S. de
cision — made under the Carter
administration but believed to
be supported by Reagan — to re
sume "lethal" military aid to
help El Salvador's embattled
government fight off a threat
from the left. *
In an obvious reference to the
aid decision, Mexican Foreign
Minister Jorge Castaneda said
last week that the Salvadorans
must "solve their own prob
lems." If not, he said, "the
bloodshed will be even greater
and the conflict will inevitably
become an international one. "
Gustavo Carvajal, president
of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, said
pointedly that the party will
support a people "that fights for
its freedom." Last week, while
U.S. officials accused
Nicaragua of aiding Salvadoran
guerrillas with arms and men,
Carvajal flew to Managua and
told officials there that
"Nicaragua is not alone."
Hands off
Thursday one of the largest
anti-American demonstrations
here in recent memory was or
ganized by 60 trade union and
leftist groups to protest "U.S.
intervention" in El Salvador.
About 25,000 people marched,
carrying banners saying "Yan
kees, hands off Salvador." They
collected money for the guer
rilla offensive and burned U.S.
flags.
Privately Mexican officials
say they are deeply worried by
the swing in U.S. policy that
they say became apparent when
the Carter administration in its
final days decided to resume
military aid to El Salvador.
Since then, Washington has con
sidered suspending economic
aid to Nicaragua's revolu
tionary government, pending in
vestigation of the use of the
funds.
Mexico aids and sympathizes
with both the Nicaraguan gov
ernment and the leftists trying
to oust the U.S.-backed
Salvadoran government.
On no other issue are the Unit
ed States and Mexico so far
apart. In contrast to the support
Latin America's other oil
power, Venezuela, gives the
Salvadoran rulers, there is a be
lief in the government here that
a hardening of U.S. policy will
further radicalize the Central
American struggle.
Message of concern
Even before the United States
announced its intention to send

weapons to the Salvadoran mili
tary. Castaneda had suggested
that Washington consult with
Mexico whenever the United
States decided "on major issues
affecting the area." Well
placed sources here said Mexico
has sent "messages of concern"
to Washington.
Last week's public protest of
the U.S. decision is viewed as a
portent of bitterness that could
grow if the United States in
creases its role in El Salvador
and actively backs the military
junta in Guatemala, where
rightist repression has also
polarized the populace.
Even if the Mexican govern
ment hopes to have good rela
tions with the Reagan adminis
tration, it will have to heed na
tionalists and the left here, who
not only have loud voices in this
country, but whose position also
matches the image Mexico likes
to project abroad.
Much of Mexico's press is vig
orously pro-revolution and anti-
American.
But the government itself is
clearly willing to play a role
that goes beyond appeasing the
liberals and the left. Recently,
for example, when El Salvador
announced plans to take its case
to the Organization of American
States to denounce Nicaraguan
and Cuban intervention, in an ef
fort to justify help from other
OAS members under the Rio de
Janeiro treaty, key Foreign
Ministry officials here reacted
warily.
U.S. policy
Washington has maintained
that El Salvador's government
is moderate and caught between
extremist violence of the left
and the right, but one high Mexi
can official said that while the
Salvadoran military "have
killed thousands of leftists and
innocent people, they have rare
ly or never jailed or killed an ex
tremist of the right."
Mexico's official help to the
Salvadoran opposition nonethe
less has been discreet. Mexico is
clearly waiting to see if the ci
vilians and guerrilla groups im
prove their chance to take
power. So far neither the gov
ernment nor the guerrillas have
demonstrated that they can con
trol the situation.
But in the meantime, Mexico
has helped finance strictly polit
ical activities of the Democrat
ic Revolutionary Front, the um
brella organization that em
braces all Salvadoran opposi
tion civilian and guerrilla
groups.
Mexico City recently became
foreign headquarters for the
front, whose members often
hold news conferences. The
many factions of the front have
coordinating offices here, and
Mexican solidarity groups drum
up support, selling posters and
collecting money.

with both the Nicaraguan gov
ernment and the leftists trying
to oust the U.S.-backed
Salvadoran government.
On no other issue are the Unit
ed States and Mexico so far
apart. In contrast to the support
Latin America's other oil
power, Venezuela, gives the
Salvadoran rulers, there is a be
lief in the government here that
a hardening of U.S. policy will
further radicalize the Central
American struggle.
Message of concern
Even before the United States
announced its intention to send

weapons to the Salvadoran mili
tary. Castaneda had suggested
that Washington consult with
Mexico whenever the United
States decided "on major issues
affecting the area." Well
placed sources here said Mexico
has sent "messages of concern"
to Washington.
Last week's public protest of
the U.S. decision is viewed as a
portent of bitterness that could
grow if the United States in
creases its role in El Salvador
and actively backs the military
junta in Guatemala, where
rightist repression has also
polarized the populace.
Even if the Mexican govern
ment hopes to have good rela
tions with the Reagan adminis
tration, it will have to heed na
tionalists and the left here, who
not only have loud voices in this
country, but whose position also
matches the image Mexico likes
to project abroad.
Much of Mexico's press is vig
orously pro-revolution and anti-
American.
But the government itself is
clearly willing to play a role
that goes beyond appeasing the
liberals and the left. Recently,
for example, when El Salvador
announced plans to take its case
to the Organization of American
States to denounce Nicaraguan
and Cuban intervention, in an ef
fort to justify help from other
OAS members under the Rio de
Janeiro treaty, key Foreign
Ministry officials here reacted
warily.
U.S. policy
Washington has maintained
that El Salvador's government
is moderate and caught between
extremist violence of the left
and the right, but one high Mexi
can official said that while the
Salvadoran military "have
killed thousands of leftists and
innocent people, they have rare
ly or never jailed or killed an ex
tremist of the right."
Mexico's official help to the
Salvadoran opposition nonethe
less has been discreet. Mexico is
clearly waiting to see if the ci
vilians and guerrilla groups im
prove their chance to take
power. So far neither the gov
ernment nor the guerrillas have
demonstrated that they can con
trol the situation.
But in the meantime, Mexico
has helped finance strictly polit
ical activities of the Democrat
ic Revolutionary Front, the um
brella organization that em
braces all Salvadoran opposi
tion civilian and guerrilla
groups.
Mexico City recently became
foreign headquarters for the
front, whose members often
hold news conferences. The
many factions of the front have
coordinating offices here, and
Mexican solidarity groups drum
up support, selling posters and
collecting money.
Mexico City — Three weeks
after President Ronald Reagan
visited Mexico to demonstrate
his good neighborliness, rela
tions between the two countries
are already being tested by the
conservative swing of Washing
ton's policy toward Central
America.
Last week Mexican officials
sharply criticized the U.S. de
cision — made under the Carter
administration but believed to
be supported by Reagan — to re
sume "lethal" military aid to
help El Salvador's embattled
government fight off a threat
from the left. *
In an obvious reference to the
aid decision, Mexican Foreign
Minister Jorge Castaneda said
last week that the Salvadorans
must "solve their own prob
lems." If not, he said, "the
bloodshed will be even greater
and the conflict will inevitably
become an international one. "
Gustavo Carvajal, president
of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, said
pointedly that the party will
support a people "that fights for
its freedom." Last week, while
U.S. officials accused
Nicaragua of aiding Salvadoran
guerrillas with arms and men,
Carvajal flew to Managua and
told officials there that
"Nicaragua is not alone."
Hands off
Thursday one of the largest
anti-American demonstrations
here in recent memory was or
ganized by 60 trade union and
leftist groups to protest "U.S.
intervention" in El Salvador.
About 25,000 people marched,
carrying banners saying "Yan
kees, hands off Salvador." They
collected money for the guer
rilla offensive and burned U.S.
flags.
Privately Mexican officials
say they are deeply worried by
the swing in U.S. policy that
they say became apparent when
the Carter administration in its
final days decided to resume
military aid to El Salvador.
Since then, Washington has con
sidered suspending economic
aid to Nicaragua's revolu
tionary government, pending in
vestigation of the use of the
funds.
