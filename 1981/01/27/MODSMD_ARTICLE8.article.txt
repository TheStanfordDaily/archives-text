# New Israeli settlements endanger negotiations
## 
### Washington Post 
Jerusalem — The government of Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin is rushing to build 10
more settlements in the occupied West Bank in
the five months it has left before it faces an elec
tion and possible ouster by the opposition Labor
Party.
The purpose, according to critics of Begin s set
tlement policies, is to lock the Labor Party into ir
revocable projects in the West Bank and make a
negotiated territorial compromise impossible to
achieve.
Prodded by Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon,
the cabinet's most outspoken advocate of Jewish
civilian settlements in the territories captured in
the 1967 war, the government is also seeking to
build 3000 new housing units in three existing set
tlements in an accelerated construction schedule,
and to expand other outposts. An agreement re
portedly has been reached with a consortium of
nine private contractors for the construction of
1800 houses at Karnai Shomrom settlement near
Nablus.
Moreover, there are plans to construct five or
six paramilitary (Nahal) settlements inside Is
rael proper, near Hebron, and six smaller ob
servation posts along the Israeli side of the
pre-1967 armistice line with Jordan, stretching
north from a point about 11 miles east of Tel Aviv,
government sources confirmed.
The new West Bank settlements would bring to
49 the number of Jewish civilian communities
started in the occupied area since the Camp David
peace accords were signed nearly two years ago.
The total operating, under construction or ap
proved by the government, would climb to 80
Settlement re-enforced
In the time left before the election. Sharon has
said, "a lot may be accomplished in Judea and
Samaria, and we will do all we can to re-enforce
Jewish settlement in the territories, and to ex
pand it." Judea and Samaria are the biblical
names for the West Bank.
However, the sudden burst of settlement activi
ty since the cabinet a week ago agreed to disolve
the parliament and seek new elections has trig
gered a controversy over both its purpose and
method of financing.

Every reliable public opinion poll indicates that
the Labor Party has an edge over Begin s Likud
government. Since the Labor Party is opposed to
settlements in densely inhabited Arab areas and
has proposed a territorial compromise in which
most of the West Bank would be returned to Jor
dan, Sharon's efforts are widely viewed as a des
perate attempt by the government to make a ne
gotiated solution to the Palestinian problem im
possible for any future government.
Some Labor-alignrnent members of the
Knesset (parliament) have prepared motions to
debate the settlement plans on the basis that they
would undermine the peace process. Also, Deputy
Prime Minister Yigael Yadin has appealed the
cabinet decision on three of the new settlements.
Kickbacks
The most furor has focused on a plan by Sharon,
who is chairman of the ministerial settlements
committee, to pay contractors building outposts
in the West Bank by deeding to them valuable
state-owned property in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv,
Beersheva and other Israeli cities.
Sharon has also reportedly been leading a fund
raising effort in South Africa and among sup
porters of the ultranationalist Gush Emunim set
tlement movement in other countries to raise
money with which to build in the West Bank.
In an editorial the independent Hebrew daily
Hnarrtz accused Sharon of "running amok" on
settlements, because he "fears a reversal in the
next elections, and he wants to make it difficult
for the next government ... to negotiate an ac
ceptable solution to the Palestinian problem."
Meanwhile, the settlements controversy was
further fueled Sunday as several hundred settlers
from the Givon outpost squatted on land just north
of Jerusalem and demanded that it be used for the
construction of a permanent outpost. The settlers
said they had been living in temporary housing at
the nearby Givon community for more than three
years while waiting for government approval of
permanent housing.
The settlers pitched tents and began erecting
concrete block huts, but the West Bank military
governor. Brig. Gen. Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said
the army did not intend to try to remove them.

Jerusalem — The government of Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin is rushing to build 10
more settlements in the occupied West Bank in
the five months it has left before it faces an elec
tion and possible ouster by the opposition Labor
Party.
The purpose, according to critics of Begin s set
tlement policies, is to lock the Labor Party into ir
revocable projects in the West Bank and make a
negotiated territorial compromise impossible to
achieve.
Prodded by Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon,
the cabinet's most outspoken advocate of Jewish
civilian settlements in the territories captured in
the 1967 war, the government is also seeking to
build 3000 new housing units in three existing set
tlements in an accelerated construction schedule,
and to expand other outposts. An agreement re
portedly has been reached with a consortium of
nine private contractors for the construction of
1800 houses at Karnai Shomrom settlement near
Nablus.
Moreover, there are plans to construct five or
six paramilitary (Nahal) settlements inside Is
rael proper, near Hebron, and six smaller ob
servation posts along the Israeli side of the
pre-1967 armistice line with Jordan, stretching
north from a point about 11 miles east of Tel Aviv,
government sources confirmed.
The new West Bank settlements would bring to
49 the number of Jewish civilian communities
started in the occupied area since the Camp David
peace accords were signed nearly two years ago.
The total operating, under construction or ap
proved by the government, would climb to 80
Settlement re-enforced
In the time left before the election. Sharon has
said, "a lot may be accomplished in Judea and
Samaria, and we will do all we can to re-enforce
Jewish settlement in the territories, and to ex
pand it." Judea and Samaria are the biblical
names for the West Bank.
However, the sudden burst of settlement activi
ty since the cabinet a week ago agreed to disolve
the parliament and seek new elections has trig
gered a controversy over both its purpose and
method of financing.

Every reliable public opinion poll indicates that
the Labor Party has an edge over Begin s Likud
government. Since the Labor Party is opposed to
settlements in densely inhabited Arab areas and
has proposed a territorial compromise in which
most of the West Bank would be returned to Jor
dan, Sharon's efforts are widely viewed as a des
perate attempt by the government to make a ne
gotiated solution to the Palestinian problem im
possible for any future government.
Some Labor-alignrnent members of the
Knesset (parliament) have prepared motions to
debate the settlement plans on the basis that they
would undermine the peace process. Also, Deputy
Prime Minister Yigael Yadin has appealed the
cabinet decision on three of the new settlements.
Kickbacks
The most furor has focused on a plan by Sharon,
who is chairman of the ministerial settlements
committee, to pay contractors building outposts
in the West Bank by deeding to them valuable
state-owned property in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv,
Beersheva and other Israeli cities.
Sharon has also reportedly been leading a fund
raising effort in South Africa and among sup
porters of the ultranationalist Gush Emunim set
tlement movement in other countries to raise
money with which to build in the West Bank.
In an editorial the independent Hebrew daily
Hnarrtz accused Sharon of "running amok" on
settlements, because he "fears a reversal in the
next elections, and he wants to make it difficult
for the next government ... to negotiate an ac
ceptable solution to the Palestinian problem."
Meanwhile, the settlements controversy was
further fueled Sunday as several hundred settlers
from the Givon outpost squatted on land just north
of Jerusalem and demanded that it be used for the
construction of a permanent outpost. The settlers
said they had been living in temporary housing at
the nearby Givon community for more than three
years while waiting for government approval of
permanent housing.
The settlers pitched tents and began erecting
concrete block huts, but the West Bank military
governor. Brig. Gen. Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said
the army did not intend to try to remove them.
