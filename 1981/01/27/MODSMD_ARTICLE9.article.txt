4 People's heads are not
like leeks. When you cut
them off, they will not
grow back. If you wrongly
cut off a head, you cannot
rectify the mistake even if
you want to.'
—Mao Zedong, 1956

Beijing — In one of history's ironic
twists, the new rulers trying to rid China
of Mao Zedong's influence ended up fol
lowing the late chairman's prudent coun
sel in sparing the lives of his widow,
Jiang Qing, and her radical col
laborators.
The much-debated decision, an
nounced early Sunday, to sentence Jiang
Qing to death but defer execution for two
years will win little support among a Chi
nese public badly bruised by the political
witch hunts and social turmoil of the Cul
tural Revolution she helped direct.
But the sentence was not designed for
public acceptance. Instead, it seemed
aimed at keeping the peace in a ruling
Communist Party that includes a sizable
bloc still loyal to Mao and the leftist poli
cies he championed until his death in
1976.

The decision is believed to have been
promoted in stormy party Central Com
mittee sessions by Mao's political suc
cessors, a team of pragmatic veterans
led by Deng Xiaoping who have devoted
their energies in the past four years to re
versing the "Great Helmsman's" eco
nomic and political programs.
By avoiding the spectacle of sending
the widow of the nation's founding father
to the firing squad, Deng's faction ap
parently hoped to foreclose the possi
bility of making her a martyr and poten
tial rallying point for a leftist backlash to
Deng's moderate policies.
Nearly half of the Communist Party's
38 million members were recruited dur
ing the Cultural Revolution when Maoist
purity was the chief qualification for
membership. Deng is well aware of the
risks of rousing opposition to his policies
by leftist remnants.
The restrained sentences also set lim
its for the dozens of upcoming trials in
volving hundreds of imprisoned leftists
outside Peking. Executing Jiang Qing or
her nine codefendants could have set off
an uncontrollable wave of executions in
the provinces and stirred up latent leftist
support.
In recent weeks, there have been in
dications that Deng is having greater dif
ficulties than anticipated in reforming
the party along traditional Marxist lines,

implementing his pragmatic economic
policies and removing Maoist holdovers
from influential party ranks.
According to reports circulating last
week, Deng was facing resistance in the
government. Army and party to his ef
forts to replace Mao's handpicked suc
cessor, Communist Party Chairman Hua
Guofeng, with one of Deng's proteges,
party General Secretary Hu Yaobang.
Hoping to maintain stability amid po
litical flux, the Deng adherents are said
to have argued for the least inflam
matory end for Jiang Qing, her Gang of
Four confederates and five one-time top
military leaders who were convicted of
persecuting hundreds of thousands of
people, hounding thousands to death, and
plotting to seize power and assassinate
Mao.
The deferred death sentence for Jiang
Qing, the central trial figure, is seen as a
compromise struck with party leaders
who fought to execute China's former
first lady. During the trial she regularly
defied and cursed tfie judges, laughed off
charges against her and ended her testi
mony last month with cries of "It is right
to rebel" and"I am prepared to die."
Throughout the 39-day trial, Jiang
Qing insisted on her innocence, claiming
she merely followed the orders of her
husband, who inspired the Cultural Rev
olution in 1966 as a way to inject life into

the party and engineered the campaign
for much of its 10-year span.
Her defense forced the party to con
duct its first public evaluation of Mao's
role in the chaotic decade — an
assessment party leaders have gingerly
sidestepped for fear of reawakening the
strong Maoist following of people who
identify him with the communist state
The touchy problem was handled at
the trial by ascribing limited blame to
Mao. In the official press and in closing
arguments by the prosecutor, Mao was
accused of making "mistakes" during
the Cultural Revolution. It was stressed,
however, that his mistakes were not as
serious as the 'counterrevolutionary
crimes" committed by his widow.
The limited-blame approach is be
lieved to have encountered opposition
during the 26 days of debate by the Cen
tral Committee that delayed sentencing
until Sunday. According to reliable
sources, trial judges originally sought to
criticize Mao for more than "mistakes."
In the end, however, pro-Mao party
leaders apparently prevailed in remov
ing him from all culpability. Excerpts of
the 14,000-word verdict published by the
official New China News Agency make
no reference to Mao and conclude in
stead that his widow was responsible for
all crimes of the Cultural Revolution.

Four confederates and five one-time top
military leaders who were convicted of
persecuting hundreds of thousands of
people, hounding thousands to death, and
plotting to seize power and assassinate
Mao.
The deferred death sentence for Jiang
Qing, the central trial figure, is seen as a
compromise struck with party leaders
who fought to execute China's former
first lady. During the trial she regularly

charges against her and ended her testi
mony last month with cries of "It is right
to rebel" and"I am prepared to die."
Throughout the 39-day trial, Jiang
Qing insisted on her innocence, claiming
she merely followed the orders of her
husband, who inspired the Cultural Rev
olution in 1966 as a way to inject life into

the party and engineered the campaign
for much of its 10-year span.
Her defense forced the party to con

role in the chaotic decade — an
assessment party leaders have gingerly
sidestepped for fear of reawakening the
strong Maoist following of people who
identify him with the communist state
The touchy problem was handled at
the trial by ascribing limited blame to
Mao. In the official press and in closing
arguments by the prosecutor, Mao was
accused of making "mistakes" during
the Cultural Revolution. It was stressed,
however, that his mistakes were not as
serious as the 'counterrevolutionary
crimes" committed by his widow.
The limited-blame approach is be
lieved to have encountered opposition
during the 26 days of debate by the Cen

until Sunday. According to reliable
sources, trial judges originally sought to
criticize Mao for more than "mistakes."
In the end, however, pro-Mao party
leaders apparently prevailed in remov

the 14,000-word verdict published by the
official New China News Agency make
no reference to Mao and conclude in
stead that his widow was responsible for
all crimes of the Cultural Revolution.

Beijing — In one of history's ironic
twists, the new rulers trying to rid China
of Mao Zedong's influence ended up fol
lowing the late chairman's prudent coun
sel in sparing the lives of his widow,
Jiang Qing, and her radical col
laborators.
The much-debated decision, an
nounced early Sunday, to sentence Jiang
Qing to death but defer execution for two
years will win little support among a Chi
nese public badly bruised by the political
witch hunts and social turmoil of the Cul
tural Revolution she helped direct.
But the sentence was not designed for
public acceptance. Instead, it seemed
aimed at keeping the peace in a ruling
Communist Party that includes a sizable
bloc still loyal to Mao and the leftist poli
cies he championed until his death in
1976.

The decision is believed to have been
promoted in stormy party Central Com
mittee sessions by Mao's political suc
cessors, a team of pragmatic veterans
led by Deng Xiaoping who have devoted
their energies in the past four years to re
versing the "Great Helmsman's" eco
nomic and political programs.
By avoiding the spectacle of sending
the widow of the nation's founding father
to the firing squad, Deng's faction ap
parently hoped to foreclose the possi
bility of making her a martyr and poten
tial rallying point for a leftist backlash to
Deng's moderate policies.
Nearly half of the Communist Party's
38 million members were recruited dur
ing the Cultural Revolution when Maoist
purity was the chief qualification for
membership. Deng is well aware of the
risks of rousing opposition to his policies
by leftist remnants.
The restrained sentences also set lim
its for the dozens of upcoming trials in
volving hundreds of imprisoned leftists
outside Peking. Executing Jiang Qing or
her nine codefendants could have set off
an uncontrollable wave of executions in
the provinces and stirred up latent leftist
support.
In recent weeks, there have been in
dications that Deng is having greater dif
ficulties than anticipated in reforming
the party along traditional Marxist lines,

implementing his pragmatic economic
policies and removing Maoist holdovers
from influential party ranks.
According to reports circulating last
week, Deng was facing resistance in the
government. Army and party to his ef
