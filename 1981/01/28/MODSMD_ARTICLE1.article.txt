# Delay in fruit fly ID may affect state agriculture
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Santa Clara — The opening
shot in the nation's biggest battle yet
against the leading scourge of agricul
ture, the Mediterranean fruit fly,
nearly passed undetected.
Last June 3, a fly of uncertain spec
ies turned up in a trap hung from an or
ange tree in the yard of a modest stuc
co home at Delmas and Atlanta ave
nues in San Jose. Though a Mediter
ranean fruit fly had been found just a
few days before in the San Fernando
Valley of Los Angeles, Santa Clara
County agricultural officials reacted
less quickly than their Los Angeles
counterparts, who in 1976 had stamped
out California's first "Medfly" in
festation.
The San Jose specimen was dutiful
ly sent to the state lab, but at slow
moving librarian postal rates. So Sac
ramento did not respond until June 18.
The report was a shocker: The spec
imen was indeed the dread Medfly —
the first one to be found north of the
Tehachapi Mountains.
The delayed confirmation set the
northerners back "about a gener
ation" in starting the massive
eradication effort now underway, said
Jerry Scribner, deputy director of the
State Department of Food and Agri
culture and director of the county
state-federal Medfly Task Force.
The fly only lives about a month,
Scribner explained. But in that time
each female can produce 1000 eggs,
implanting them under the skin of 200
kinds of fruit and vegetable, many of
which grow prolifically in California
and pose a serious threat to the state's
$12 billion agricultural econonomy.
The maggots ruin the produce while
growing into mature flies.
Within days of the Sacramento con
firmation new finds turned up. These
shifted the epicenter several miles
northwest, ringing the University of
Santa Clara campus.
"You're losing it!" county and state
officials were warned by experts from
infested Hawaii, the most likely
source of California's Medflies (im
ported, it is thought, by unwitting
tourists illegally carrying forbidden
fruit in their hand-luggage).
State and federal officials re
sponded by declaring a quarantine
aimed at closing off export out of the
area of fruit and vegetables suscep
tible of harboring Medfly larvae.
As more flies and larvae turned up,
the zone expanded until it covered 500
square miles of Santa Clara and south
ern Alameda counties in the area
south of San Francisco.
Large signs posted along 14 major
roads into the area warn motorists:
"Entering Medfly Quarantine Area.

No Fruits-Vegetables To Go Outside
of Area."
Local officials balked at a state pro
posal for widespread aerial spraying
of pesticides, so the task force turned
to a unique fruit-stripping campaign.
Within the quarantine zone, nearly
1000 Civilian Conservation Corps
youths are stripping fruit trees in
more than half a million residential
yards.
The CCC teams are followed by 130
spraying crews from the State Depart
ment of Transportation. The goal,
Scribner said, is to deny female fruit
flies a place to lay their eggs, thus re
ducing the next medfly generation.
The laborious stripping-and
spraying campaign is crucial to cut
the Medfly population enough to give
the technique that has worked twice in
Los Angeles a chance to work in the
north: saturating the infested area
with so many sterile fruit flies that the
survivors literally breed themselves
out of existence.
To work, said Dick Fehlman, a state
entymololgist who is lord of the sterile
flies, there must be at least 100 sterile
flies to every wild fly. Such a ratio, he
explained, would ensure that every
mating would include a sterile fly,
thus producing no offspring. Medflies
mate only once.
"The main tool — sterile flies —
works quite well when we have a low
population of wild flies," a Depart
ment of Food and Agriculture report
noted last month. But the supply of
sterile flies is both limited and threat
ened since Mexico, a major supplier,
could decide to keep its output for use
in its own eradication campaign.
"So it is imperative that we get the
infestation to the point where we can
manage it easily with what steriles we
will have in the spring," the report
concluded.
If the Medfly should survive this
winter at its probable population level
before stripping and spraying began,
it was ominously predicted, "this area
faces an explosion of flies in the
spring."

But. despite the introduction so far
of 1.5 billion sterile fruit flies bred in
infested areas of Hawaii. Mexico and
Peru, finds of wild flies and maggots
continued to turn up in January. (Los
Angeles needed "only" 266 million
steriles to win its second battle of the
Medflv.»
In mid-January, a month after
Southern California's Medfly infesta
tion was declared eradicated at a cost
of $2 million, the northern outbreak
had already consumed a $4 million
state-federal appropriation and,

Scribner said, is devouring another $8
million, and the end is not yet in sight.
Fearing the worst, agricultural of
ficials have set traps throughout the
agriculturally lush San Joaquin Val
ley, 600 of them in Fresno County
alone.
Insalaco said an infestation in the
valley would be "absolutely devas
tating."

ley, 600 of them in Fresno County
alone.
Insalaco said an infestation in the
valley would be "absolutely devas
tating."
Santa Clara — The opening
shot in the nation's biggest battle yet
against the leading scourge of agricul
ture, the Mediterranean fruit fly,
nearly passed undetected.
Last June 3, a fly of uncertain spec
ies turned up in a trap hung from an or
ange tree in the yard of a modest stuc
co home at Delmas and Atlanta ave
nues in San Jose. Though a Mediter
ranean fruit fly had been found just a
few days before in the San Fernando
Valley of Los Angeles, Santa Clara
County agricultural officials reacted
less quickly than their Los Angeles
counterparts, who in 1976 had stamped
out California's first "Medfly" in
festation.
The San Jose specimen was dutiful
ly sent to the state lab, but at slow
moving librarian postal rates. So Sac
ramento did not respond until June 18.
The report was a shocker: The spec
imen was indeed the dread Medfly —
the first one to be found north of the
Tehachapi Mountains.
The delayed confirmation set the
northerners back "about a gener
ation" in starting the massive
eradication effort now underway, said
Jerry Scribner, deputy director of the
State Department of Food and Agri
culture and director of the county
state-federal Medfly Task Force.
The fly only lives about a month,
Scribner explained. But in that time
each female can produce 1000 eggs,
implanting them under the skin of 200
kinds of fruit and vegetable, many of
which grow prolifically in California
and pose a serious threat to the state's
$12 billion agricultural econonomy.
The maggots ruin the produce while
growing into mature flies.
Within days of the Sacramento con
firmation new finds turned up. These
shifted the epicenter several miles
northwest, ringing the University of
Santa Clara campus.
"You're losing it!" county and state
officials were warned by experts from
infested Hawaii, the most likely
source of California's Medflies (im
ported, it is thought, by unwitting
tourists illegally carrying forbidden
fruit in their hand-luggage).
State and federal officials re
sponded by declaring a quarantine
aimed at closing off export out of the
area of fruit and vegetables suscep
tible of harboring Medfly larvae.
As more flies and larvae turned up,
the zone expanded until it covered 500
square miles of Santa Clara and south
ern Alameda counties in the area
south of San Francisco.
Large signs posted along 14 major
roads into the area warn motorists:
"Entering Medfly Quarantine Area.

No Fruits-Vegetables To Go Outside
of Area."
Local officials balked at a state pro
posal for widespread aerial spraying
of pesticides, so the task force turned
to a unique fruit-stripping campaign.
Within the quarantine zone, nearly
1000 Civilian Conservation Corps
youths are stripping fruit trees in
more than half a million residential
yards.
The CCC teams are followed by 130
spraying crews from the State Depart
ment of Transportation. The goal,
Scribner said, is to deny female fruit
flies a place to lay their eggs, thus re
ducing the next medfly generation.
The laborious stripping-and
spraying campaign is crucial to cut
the Medfly population enough to give
the technique that has worked twice in
Los Angeles a chance to work in the
north: saturating the infested area
with so many sterile fruit flies that the
survivors literally breed themselves
out of existence.
To work, said Dick Fehlman, a state
entymololgist who is lord of the sterile
flies, there must be at least 100 sterile
flies to every wild fly. Such a ratio, he
explained, would ensure that every
mating would include a sterile fly,
thus producing no offspring. Medflies
mate only once.
"The main tool — sterile flies —
works quite well when we have a low
population of wild flies," a Depart
ment of Food and Agriculture report
noted last month. But the supply of
sterile flies is both limited and threat
ened since Mexico, a major supplier,
could decide to keep its output for use
in its own eradication campaign.
"So it is imperative that we get the
infestation to the point where we can
manage it easily with what steriles we
will have in the spring," the report
concluded.
If the Medfly should survive this
winter at its probable population level
before stripping and spraying began,
it was ominously predicted, "this area
faces an explosion of flies in the
spring."

But. despite the introduction so far
of 1.5 billion sterile fruit flies bred in
infested areas of Hawaii. Mexico and
Peru, finds of wild flies and maggots
continued to turn up in January. (Los
Angeles needed "only" 266 million
steriles to win its second battle of the
Medflv.»
In mid-January, a month after
Southern California's Medfly infesta
tion was declared eradicated at a cost
of $2 million, the northern outbreak
had already consumed a $4 million
state-federal appropriation and,

Scribner said, is devouring another $8
million, and the end is not yet in sight.
