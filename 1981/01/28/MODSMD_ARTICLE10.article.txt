# Americans, Japanese explore each other's cultures
## Keio sponsors student exchange program 
### Mike Resnick 
What are Japanese college students real
ly like? We've all heard the stories of the in
tense academic competition even the
youngest students must undergo. What are
they like by the time they get to college?
What do they do for fun? What are their
goals and aspirations?
In late February, six students from To
kyo's Keio University, along with two from
the Kwanseigakuin University in Osaka,
will be welcomed into the Stanford com
munity, courtesy of Stanford's student-run
Keio program.
The first month of their stay here will be
with private families. During these few
weeks, the students will visit both Los An
geles and Lake Tahoe.
Once spring quarter begins, the eight stu
dents will move into various vacant spaces
in dorms and other residences on campus,
regularly attend classes, participate in
campus and dorm life and go out on pre
viously planned excursions with members
of Stanford's Keio organization. Trips to Yo
semite, Santa Cruz, and assorted wineries
are already being planned. The students will
leave at the beginning of May, in time to re
turn home for their new academic year.
Alan Matsumoto, current head of the

Keio organization at Stanford, said he be
lieves that the program fills a gap left by
other overseas opportunities. When stu
dents come to the community, their prima
ry goal isn't academic, he said. They don't
really come to study; they come to ex
perience American life, culture and to in
teract with people. Living with a family and
in a dorm with an American roommate is all
part of the experience, and greatly
enhances the exchange students' time in the
United States, according to Matsumoto.
This cultural experience isn't one-sided,
however. Host families gain an insight and
knowledge of the Japanese culture that
couldn't be duplicated without going
abroad. This also holds true for the Stanford
students who come to know the exchange
students during their stay on campus. Ac
cording to Matsumoto, housing was in short
supply last year after the fire that left
Storey House uninhabitable. Keio students
were placed wherever space could be found,
even if that meant placement in one of Stan
ford's less active residences. Despite this
obstacle, they proved a unifying force, ac
cording to Matsumoto, who said that ap
proximately 50Crothers Memorial Hall res
idents came to see the Japanese students off
on their last day here.
Keio also sends eight Stanford students to

Japan every summer, for a period of two
months. Again, the emphasis is not on
academics, so there is no real language re
quirement. Students live with a Japanese
family for the entire two months and aren't
necessarily required to attend the univer
sity. The program is very flexible and al
lows the student much independence.
The American participants in the pro
gram are drawn primarily from the active
participants in Stanford's Keio organiza
tion. Matsumoto stressed that students are
selected on the basis of their commitment to
the organization and the program.
Participation is vital to the life of the or
ganization, said Matsumoto. The program
was initiated in the early '50s and has since
been maintained completely by students at
Stanford and at Keio in Tokyo. When a Stan
ford student arrives in Tokyo, and when a
Japanese student arrives in the United
States, he has only his return ticket and a
promise to be helped and housed throughout
his two-month visit.
Help is always welcome, as are potential
host families for the Japanese students'
first month. Announcements of Keio com
mittee meetings are in Once Around the
Quad and the committee can be contacted at
the number listed in the student directory.

Storey House uninhabitable. Keio students
were placed wherever space could be found,
even if that meant placement in one of Stan
ford's less active residences. Despite this
obstacle, they proved a unifying force, ac
cording to Matsumoto, who said that ap
proximately 50Crothers Memorial Hall res
idents came to see the Japanese students off
on their last day here.
Keio also sends eight Stanford students to

Japan every summer, for a period of two
months. Again, the emphasis is not on
academics, so there is no real language re
quirement. Students live with a Japanese
family for the entire two months and aren't
necessarily required to attend the univer
sity. The program is very flexible and al
lows the student much independence.
The American participants in the pro
gram are drawn primarily from the active
participants in Stanford's Keio organiza
tion. Matsumoto stressed that students are
selected on the basis of their commitment to
the organization and the program.
Participation is vital to the life of the or
ganization, said Matsumoto. The program
was initiated in the early '50s and has since
been maintained completely by students at
Stanford and at Keio in Tokyo. When a Stan
ford student arrives in Tokyo, and when a
Japanese student arrives in the United
States, he has only his return ticket and a
promise to be helped and housed throughout
his two-month visit.
Help is always welcome, as are potential
host families for the Japanese students'
first month. Announcements of Keio com
mittee meetings are in Once Around the
Quad and the committee can be contacted at
the number listed in the student directory.
