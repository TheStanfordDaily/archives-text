# Seniors plan and enjoy a variety of class activities
## 
### Karen Springen 
There are four senior class
presidents each year, right?
Well, technically, but this
year's officers have also in
itiated a senior core of about 25
to 50 volunteers who meet week
ly to help brainstorm, plan and
implement activities.
"It's like having 25 senior
class presidents," said Presi
dent Bill Kemmeries.
The core volunteer group is
just one of several new prac
tices which Presidents Kem
meries, Jamie Halper, Mary El
len Reilly and Ina Coleman have
added this year. When they took
office, said Halper, "we decided
our major emphasis was going
to be enlarging the number of
people involved in and partici
pating in class activities."
Pub night, held every Thurs
day at Encina Station from 9
p.m. to 1 a.m., began fall quar
ter and has been attracting 200
to 300 seniors. Pub night often
features live entertainment in
addition to cheap beer. Accord
ing to Halper, seniors drank a
keg of beer every 10 minutes
one Thursday. Tomorrow sen
iors will come as they will be in
10 years for alumni theme
night.
Biweekly facultyâ€”senior
mixers are another addition to
traditional senior class fare.
The first informal sherry hour,
held at American Studies yes
terday, featured Chip Blacker
and John Chubb of the Political
Science Dept., Economics Prof.
John Cogan, History Prof.
Carolyn Lougee and Robert
McGinn, head of VTS, allowing

seniors to drink in knowledge,
anecdotes and sherry.
According to Halper, the
presidents cater to seniors'
academic, social and career
needs. "We consider our
purpose as a social and service
organization to seniors," he
said. "Seniors especially love
the social side," he added.
The class holds 30 to 40 ac
tivities per quarter. Publicity
for these functions is the key to
high turnouts. But the number
of seniors living off-campus
hampers communication.
A hotline gives a recording of
all events. Seniors who dial
497-4863 hear not only upcoming
activities but a new joke each
week.
Funding, however, is a key
problem for the class. Fundrais
ing efforts include the jogathon,
senior raffle and alumni solic
itations. Also, freshman orien
tation fees in the past have in
cluded $2 but this adds up to a
class total of only about $3000.
(Next year's frosh will pay $5.)
Because the class operates
under a funding handicap, it
tries to co-sponsor as many
events as possible with or
ganizations that are better
funded, said Halper.
The senior alumni brunches,
for example, are funded by
Bowman alumni house. The pro
gram features 35 brunches with
professors, administrators and
seniors.
Publicity is a major expense
"second only to beer," said
Halper.
Upcoming activities include

stepped-up Zot's runs,a wine
tasting trip, a cappaccino night
and a field day.
The class will charter buses
for the spring wine-tasting. "We
don't want seniors driving af
ter tasting too much!" said
Halper.
According to Rielly, the class
tries not to compete with other
activities on campus. For exam
ple, parties are designed for the
weeknights. Planning around
other senior activities, such as
LSATs and GMATs, is a major
reason for the big crowds at
most events, said Halper.
Rielly and Halper described
the class structure as "not polit
ical."
"We try to really divide up
and specialize our responsi
bilities," said Halper. Rielly
handles publicity. Halper coor
dinates social activities and the
senior core. Kemmeries or
ganizes career-oriented and
academic activities and Cole
man is in charge of financial,
administrative and graduation
matters.
The presidents are en
thusiastic about the class. "I
think Dean Hargadon had an es
pecially good year (in selecting
the class of 1981)," said Halper.
But the officers warn poten
tial class of 1982 candidates to
expect "imminent scholastic
demise." Halper described the
campaign as "an absolute war
of attrition."
He added, "they should defi
nitely look at as many under
graduate specials as possible."
