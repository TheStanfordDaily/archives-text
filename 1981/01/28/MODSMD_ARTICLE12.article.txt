# Hostage news conference elicits emotional response from reporters
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Tradition holds that the
American press must adopt a
dispassionate, almost ir
reverent, attitude toward the
subject it covers, but the hun
dreds of journalists jammed
into Elsenhower Hall yesterday
couldn't quite pull it off.
Instead, those assembled in
the auditorium on the campus of
the U.S. Military Academy be
came as caught up In yellow-rib
bon fever — the groundswell of
affection for the freed hostages
that has swept America — as
the rest of the nation.
Reporters, photographers
and television crews broke into
spontaneous applause when 41
of the former hostages
apepared before them, and they
applauded again when the 47-

minute news conference ended
in a demonstration of emotion
rare to the working press.
In between, many prefaced
their questions with a "wel
come home." Others observed
that they had been in almost
constant touch with members of
a particular hostage family
throughout the 14 V 2 months of
captivity.
There was one notable excep
tion to the expressions of em
pathy and concern. At the close
of the news conference there
was a haranguing question from
a woman who said she was a
supporter of the Revolutionary
Communist Party and an un
published free-lance writer.
The woman, who identified
herself as Virginia Wohl, 29, of
Harrison, N.J., accused Bruce

Laingen, moderator of the news
conference and deputy chief of
the U.S. mission in Tehran, of
being a CIA agent. She also ac
cused the United States of hy
pocrisy.
There was general laughter
from the other reporters and
calls for the woman to sit down.
But she persisted, her voice ris
ing, while Laingen tried to inter
rupt, apparently to tell her he
could not hear or understand her
question.
Finally Laingen interrupted
again, saying firmly: "We'll
take one more question."
The news conference was at
tended by journalists and tele
vision technicians who had been
given special press credentials
to cover the hostages' return to

the West Point campus.
Before the conference
started, State Department
spokesman Jack Cannon told
the journalists to remain in
their seats and cautioned pho
tographers not to use flash
equipment anywhere in the
auditorium.
Some of the returning
hostages, especially the
younger ones, obviously enjoyed
themselves, seeing their en
counter with the press almost as
a release from the tensions of
their ordeal.
That was especially true of
one young former hostage. He
winked several times at a young
female reporter sitting close to
the stage, and at the end of the
conference waved goodbye to
her.
