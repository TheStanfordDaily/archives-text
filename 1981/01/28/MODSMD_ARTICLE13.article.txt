## Progressive patriots' challenge 
### 
During the past few weeks Americans have cel
ebrated a renewal of national pride. Released
hostages and a new president have encouraged ex
pressions of patriotism and provided symbols of
national unity.
Politically, it appears that the right has taken
hold of the American consciousness and used that
consciousness to claim a conservative victory.
Progressives, however, seem to be left with a dis
abled ideology, dwindling popular support and no
symbols. Patriotism is again a banner for reac
tionaries.
Yet this situation does not represent an in
herent, inseparable link between patriotism and
conservatism. The left should assert its claim to
flag, faith and family, particularly since liberal
reforms have given more people a broader stake
in the fortunes of America.
Resurgent pride in American ideals of de
mocracy and freedom does not exist merely to
prop up conservative causes. In fact, we suggest
that the symbols of this country be used to return
the United States to its fundamental precept:
equality in all its forms for all of its people.
A new campaign for a "patriotism of the left"
must recognize that progressives can make an
historical claim to national symbols. During the
American Revolution, for example, oppressed
women organized behind the flag in order to pro
mote their own independence. Freedom leagues
Comprised of the wives of minutemen sabotaged
English property and provided support for Revo
lutionary army units. Some radical pamphleteers
like Tom Paine aided the women in their struggle;
drawing on the equal rights rhetoric of the revolu
tion, they wrote in support of equal rights for
women.
A century and a half later, in the midst of the
greatest national crisis since the civil war, Frank
lin Roosevelt formulated a conception of na
tionalism which identified the national interest
with security and well-being for all Americans. In
order to preserve the stability of political institu
tions and insure democratic process, a program
of social assistance was instituted. Roosevelt suc
cessfully promoted the idea of a unified nation
that could encourage artistic development and
meet basic human needs. His WPA was an in
tensely patriotic program designed to benefit the
entire nation through its employment of workers.
Along with an appreciation of this historical
tradition of "progressive patriotism" should
come a challenge to right wing control over na
tional symbols. Though President Ronald Reagan
has identified himself with nationalism, family
and religion, he advocates an ideology contrary to
American ideals. Considered critically, the na
tionalism of the right represents not only the
power of America, but also a disregard for the in
tegrity of other nations. Pride in America justi
fied U.S. aggression in Vietnam and today pro
vides the basis for American neo-colonialism in
Latin America.
As used by reactionaries, nationalism serves as
a guise for American oppression at home and
abroad. The left in America could strengthen its
links to Third World struggles by promoting a
sense of nation that would encourage rather than
hinder international democracy and national self
determination.
The flag need not represent the power of the
military, but could be transformed into a banner

for world peace. The power of the flag as a symbol
for democracy is as great as the progressives'
ability to reclaim it in our struggles for political,
economic and social justice.
A central arena for these struggles is the fami
ly. Here the right presents itself as the defender of
motherhood, successfully appealing to the deeply
felt need among many Americans for meaningful
family ties.
With this defense, however, conservatives re
strict the definition of motherhood, and hinder the
self-development and expression of all family
members. Any relationship within this arrange
ment preferred by the right will be by definition
patriarchal and sexist.
We on the left must not only unmask this in
herent sexism, but must formulate a positive pro
gram. The meaning of motherhood needs trans
formation. Rather than represent a stifling patri
archal structure, motherhood could mean a shar
ing of parenting among a couple or collective.
We must discuss alternatives to the nuclear
family, and advocate social programs such as
free public daycare which advance the liberation
of women within that traditional structure. A
heightened concern with the nature of mother
hood and the family could stimulate vigorous
change in the private realm comparable to the re
forms realized in the public sphere.
Another sphere of contention between the right
and left involves religion. The contemporary
prominence of the Moral Majority has led many
Americans to associate religion with con
servative politics; however, throughout our his
tory, religion has played a progressive role. The
abolitionist movement of the past century was
rooted in religious conviction, as was the civil
rights struggle of the 1950s and '60s.
The teachings of Martin Luther King exemplify
this tradition. As Kenneth Smith rightly suggests,
"King shared the American Dream and he as
sociated the secular elements of the dream drawn
from democratic political theory and the religious
elements derived from the Judeo-Christian
faith." For Dr. King, the civil rights movement
was an effort to recall the United States to its ori
ginal purpose and thereby resolve the gap be
tween American ideals and American practices.
In his own words,
America is a dream. It is a dream of a land
where men of all races, of all nationalities
and of all creeds can live together as
brothers. The substance of the dream is ex
pressed in these sublime words, words
lifted to cosmic proportions: 'We hold these
truths to be self-evident â€” that all men are
created equal; that they are endowed by
their creator with certain inalienable
rights, that among these are life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.' This is a
dream.
This vision informs the historical tradition of
American progressive movements. As inheritors
of this tradition, our task, as Norman Thomas sug
gested. is to cleanse the flag, not to burn it. The
most positive thing we can do for our country is to
make it our own. to embrace the ideal of de
mocracy in its broadest sense. To do this, we must
reclaim the central national symbols of flag, faith
and family.
