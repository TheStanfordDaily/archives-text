## Fallacy of democratic socialism 
### 
Friends and acquaintances on
the "progressive" left will par
don me if I indulge in a few gen
eralizations in stating my objec
tions to their politics (which
are, after all, based precisely on
collectivist generalizations).
Indeed, having heard Michael
Harrington expound his infec
tiously fuzzy vision of demo

cratic socialism before the
Stanford Progressive Alliance,
I must confess that it is by no
means clear to me that there is
anything at all specific in the so
cialist program other than col
lective good intentions.
Nevertheless, what does
seem apparent is that Har
rington and friends truly believe

that the socialist left is some
how uniquely on the good side of
history. Hence, the use of the
word "progressive" to describe
leftist politics, even though, as
Harrington cautioned on a de
cidedly non-Marxist note,
"progress is not inevitable."
What he neglected to add was
that neither is "progress" nec
essarily good. Indeed, it is hard
to name a "progressive" re
gime in the world today that is
not run on the principles of a
prison camp. There is not a ma
jor tyrant of the twentieth cen
tury who has not at one time or
another been praised by some
"progressive" thinker. Hitler
and Mussolini can be included
here along with Lenin, Stalin
and Mao; all of them shared the
common progressive values of
socialism, collectivism, anti
capitalism, and obsession with
political power. In American
history, the progressivist war
time administrations of Wood
row Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt
and Lyndon Johnson offer addi
tional evidence for a connection
between social and military col
lectivism.
Most socialists try to reverse
this connection and blame vio
lence instead on capitalism, es
sentially confusing economics
with political power. However,
most capitalists are fully aware
that war is inimical to the crea
tion of wealth. The greatest
crimes of the twentieth century
were not the work of busi
nessmen, bankers, or chairmen
of multinational corporations
pursuing economic ends, but
rather of politicians, revolu
tionaries and armies pursuing
political power.
Many of the worst nightmares
have begun as idealistic visions
of the intelligentsia, many of
whom, in the tradition of Plato,
fancy themselves as the
philosopher-kings who will gov
ern socialist paradise Perhaps

this is how Pol Pot learned to
see himself in his student days,
which were reportedly spent on
the Left Bank imbibing French
Marxism.
Fortunately, since the de
parture of Bruce Franklin, we
have not had to contend with
this heady brand of socialism at
Stanford, though perhaps his
fondness for guns lives on
among those "progressives"
who have recently suggested in
viting Angela Davis and Dennis
Banks as guest professors.
More congenial are those fa
miliar high-spirited radicals
who, while professing to an
egalitarianism that is quasi-
Marxist, seem to be acting out
of motives that are quasi-
Nietzschean. One gathers that
they are revolutionaries be
cause they enjoy being in the
vanguard. As with many
academic political theorists,
their politics are an ego
projection upon reality, a notion
of how they would like every
thing else to be.
The temptation is strong at an
elite academic institution like
Stanford to indulge such politi
cal visions. After all, there are
plenty of opportunities for well
educated philosopher-tech
nocrats under socialism. But it
is false to assume that there is
anything democratic in relying
on the apparatus of the state to
order people about.
This is the essential fallacy of
democratic socialism. It is one
thing to pose visions of a better
world and work creatively to
achieve it through social leader
ship and enterprise; it is quite
another to invoke the coercive
authority of the state to impose
a single social vision on every
one. It is "progressives," not
capitalists, who demand such a
monopoly.

This is the essential fallacy of
democratic socialism. It is one
thing to pose visions of a better
world and work creatively to
achieve it through social leader
ship and enterprise; it is quite
another to invoke the coercive
authority of the state to impose
a single social vision on every
one. It is "progressives," not
capitalists, who demand such a
monopoly.

Friends and acquaintances on
the "progressive" left will par
don me if I indulge in a few gen
eralizations in stating my objec
tions to their politics (which
are, after all, based precisely on
collectivist generalizations).
Indeed, having heard Michael
Harrington expound his infec
tiously fuzzy vision of demo

cratic socialism before the
Stanford Progressive Alliance,
I must confess that it is by no
means clear to me that there is
anything at all specific in the so
cialist program other than col
lective good intentions.
Nevertheless, what does
seem apparent is that Har
rington and friends truly believe

that the socialist left is some
how uniquely on the good side of
history. Hence, the use of the
word "progressive" to describe
leftist politics, even though, as
Harrington cautioned on a de
cidedly non-Marxist note,
"progress is not inevitable."
What he neglected to add was
that neither is "progress" nec
essarily good. Indeed, it is hard
to name a "progressive" re
gime in the world today that is
not run on the principles of a
prison camp. There is not a ma
jor tyrant of the twentieth cen
tury who has not at one time or
another been praised by some
"progressive" thinker. Hitler
and Mussolini can be included
here along with Lenin, Stalin
and Mao; all of them shared the
common progressive values of
socialism, collectivism, anti
capitalism, and obsession with
political power. In American
history, the progressivist war
time administrations of Wood
row Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt
and Lyndon Johnson offer addi
tional evidence for a connection
between social and military col
lectivism.
Most socialists try to reverse
this connection and blame vio
lence instead on capitalism, es
sentially confusing economics
with political power. However,
most capitalists are fully aware
that war is inimical to the crea
tion of wealth. The greatest
crimes of the twentieth century
were not the work of busi
nessmen, bankers, or chairmen
of multinational corporations
pursuing economic ends, but
rather of politicians, revolu
tionaries and armies pursuing
political power.
Many of the worst nightmares
have begun as idealistic visions
of the intelligentsia, many of
whom, in the tradition of Plato,
fancy themselves as the
philosopher-kings who will gov
ern socialist paradise Perhaps

this is how Pol Pot learned to
see himself in his student days,
which were reportedly spent on
the Left Bank imbibing French
Marxism.
Fortunately, since the de
parture of Bruce Franklin, we
have not had to contend with
this heady brand of socialism at
Stanford, though perhaps his
fondness for guns lives on
among those "progressives"
who have recently suggested in
viting Angela Davis and Dennis
Banks as guest professors.
More congenial are those fa
miliar high-spirited radicals
who, while professing to an
egalitarianism that is quasi-
Marxist, seem to be acting out
of motives that are quasi-
Nietzschean. One gathers that
they are revolutionaries be
cause they enjoy being in the
vanguard. As with many
academic political theorists,
their politics are an ego
projection upon reality, a notion
of how they would like every
thing else to be.
The temptation is strong at an
elite academic institution like
Stanford to indulge such politi
cal visions. After all, there are
plenty of opportunities for well
educated philosopher-tech
nocrats under socialism. But it
is false to assume that there is
anything democratic in relying
on the apparatus of the state to
order people about.
This is the essential fallacy of
democratic socialism. It is one
thing to pose visions of a better
world and work creatively to
achieve it through social leader
ship and enterprise; it is quite
another to invoke the coercive
authority of the state to impose
a single social vision on every
one. It is "progressives," not
capitalists, who demand such a
monopoly.
