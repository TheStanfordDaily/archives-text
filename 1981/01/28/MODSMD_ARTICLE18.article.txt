## Keith Archuleta Black Africa struggles to crush apartheid 
### 
In South Africa human equal
ity is denied by constitution, by
law and in practice. The doc
trine of apartheid, or racial sep
aration, is the official
philosophy of the state, and is
forced upon everyone.
Under apartheid, living con
ditions are inhuman and
deplorable:
Income — Blacks average
about $175 per year; four-fifths
of the Africans earn less than
the $129/ month calculated as
"subsistence." Wages paid by
U.S. corporations are mostly
below this level. Whites, how
ever, earn an average 12 or
more times what blacks earn
and have the highest standard of
living in the world.
Food — For Africans,
malnutrition is everywhere. Ap
proximately 40,000 babies died
of starvation on the Transkie
"homeland" in 1967. Half of all
black children die by the age of
six, and the situation is growing
worse as unemployment con
tinues to rise and inflation in the
apartheid stores reaches up to
100 percent per year.
Medical care — The death
rate for children is so high part

ly because medical care for
blacks is terrible. Soweto, with
a population of IV2 million, has
one hospital.
Housing — There is not
enough and what is available is
poor. In both urban townships
and the rural "homelands,"
most housing has no running wa
ter, no electricity, no heat.
White housing is among the best
in the world.
Pass laws — Blacks are per
mitted to come to the cities only
if they have ID's proving they
are employed. Failure to have a
pass leads to imprisonment,
forced labor on white farms, or
forced return to the "home
land."
Black people in South Africa
are not allowed to vote or own
land.
In recent years the South
African government has gone
even further and is trying to pre
tend that the people of African
descent are not even African at
all. The apartheid system is de
signed with the intent of a future
South Africa divided by race.
According to this plan, no black
will be a citizen of South Africa.
Instead, "tribal homelands"
(also called "bantustands" or
"reserves") are being estab
lished by the white minority
government.
Black people comprise 83
percent of the population, but
the "homelands" are only 13
percent of the total land mass.
The other 87 percent of the land
is reserved for 16 percent of the
population, which is white. The
"homelands" are located in the
most infertile, barren, non
productive land in the country.
Throughout' the last three
years, and as recently as last
week, the South African govern
ment has cracked down on even
moderate organizations and in
dividuals opposed to apartheid.
The organizations, newspapers

and individuals that have been
banned all have stood for recon
ciliation. Quite ironically the ra
cist regime in Pretoria is now
accusing them of what the Na
tional Party regime has been
doing in South Africa for over 30
years — destroying the coun
try's peace and security.
Apartheid is enforced by a
brutal and powerful police force
and army (thanks to the U.S.,
Britain, France and Israel).
During 1975 to '77, the military
budget increased 80 percent in
response to the urban protests
and increased guerrilla warfare
in South Africa and neighboring
countries.
It seems that the whites of
South Africa would rather shoot
blacks than talk to them about
the establishment of a just soci
ety.
Not surprisingly, the political
and economic structures of
apartheid are rejected by the
majority of the people in that
country. There is in South
Africa a long history of political
protest, of petitions, demon
strations, and appeals for jus
tice. The African National Con
gress of South Africa was
formed in 1912 to fight
apartheid. But all African
peaceful agitation has been
ruthlessly smashed, while the
oppression has grown even
harsher.
Black women in South Africa
suffer a double oppression. As
blacks they are landless people,
foreigners in their native land.
As women they are denied even
the few rights allowed black
men. Though black women are
repressed by apartheid more
than black men, they, too, are
struggling in every possible
way. Women's resistance to the
pass laws goes all the way back
to 1913, when mass demonstra
tions led to the government's
withdrawing the pass law for

women.
In 1955, however, in an effort
to drive all women not em
ployed as domestics back to the
"homelands," pass laws were
again instituted for women.
Demonstrations by African
women began at once. In August
1956 nearly 20,000 women dem
onstrated in Pretoria. This time
the government would not back
down, but as a song from the
anti-pass demonstration in Pre
toria said, "Now that you have
touched the women you have
struck a rock, you have disloged
a boulder, you will be crushed."
Finally, even the extreme pa
tience of Africans has been ex
hausted, for when other means
fail, men and women are willing
to die for freedom. A war has
been won in Zimbabwe; it has
begun in Nambia (Southwest
Africa). In Azania (South
Africa), the people have begun
to rise in spontaneous revolt.
The conflict in Southern
Africa is not a capitalist versus
communist struggle at all; it is
a nationalist struggle for politi
cal freedom and human equal
ity. The final result is therefore
certain. What is yet to be de
termined is the means by which
nationalism will triumph, the
human suffering which will be
involved in the struggle and the
extent to which the rest of the
world will be militarily in
volved.
For now, the South Africa Sol
idarity Committee urges the
Stanford community to learn
more about South Africa by at
tending a free screening of the
film, Last Grave at Dimbaza,
and joining in a discussion about
South Africa tonight at 7 p.m. in
Ujamaa Lounge, Lagunita
Court.

For now, the South Africa Sol
idarity Committee urges the
Stanford community to learn

Ujamaa Lounge, Lagunita

ity Committee.)
In South Africa human equal
ity is denied by constitution, by
law and in practice. The doc
trine of apartheid, or racial sep
aration, is the official
philosophy of the state, and is
forced upon everyone.
Under apartheid, living con
ditions are inhuman and
deplorable:
Income — Blacks average
about $175 per year; four-fifths
of the Africans earn less than
the $129/ month calculated as
"subsistence." Wages paid by
U.S. corporations are mostly
below this level. Whites, how
ever, earn an average 12 or
more times what blacks earn
and have the highest standard of
living in the world.
Food — For Africans,
malnutrition is everywhere. Ap
proximately 40,000 babies died
of starvation on the Transkie
"homeland" in 1967. Half of all
black children die by the age of
six, and the situation is growing
worse as unemployment con
tinues to rise and inflation in the
apartheid stores reaches up to
100 percent per year.
Medical care — The death
rate for children is so high part

ly because medical care for
blacks is terrible. Soweto, with
a population of IV2 million, has
one hospital.
Housing — There is not
enough and what is available is
poor. In both urban townships
and the rural "homelands,"
most housing has no running wa
ter, no electricity, no heat.
White housing is among the best
in the world.
Pass laws — Blacks are per
mitted to come to the cities only
if they have ID's proving they
are employed. Failure to have a
pass leads to imprisonment,
forced labor on white farms, or
forced return to the "home
land."
Black people in South Africa
are not allowed to vote or own
land.
In recent years the South
African government has gone
even further and is trying to pre
tend that the people of African
descent are not even African at
all. The apartheid system is de
signed with the intent of a future
South Africa divided by race.
According to this plan, no black
will be a citizen of South Africa.
Instead, "tribal homelands"
(also called "bantustands" or
"reserves") are being estab
lished by the white minority
government.
Black people comprise 83
percent of the population, but
the "homelands" are only 13
percent of the total land mass.
The other 87 percent of the land
is reserved for 16 percent of the
population, which is white. The
"homelands" are located in the
most infertile, barren, non
productive land in the country.
Throughout' the last three
years, and as recently as last
week, the South African govern
ment has cracked down on even
moderate organizations and in
dividuals opposed to apartheid.
The organizations, newspapers

and individuals that have been
banned all have stood for recon
ciliation. Quite ironically the ra
cist regime in Pretoria is now
accusing them of what the Na
tional Party regime has been
doing in South Africa for over 30
years — destroying the coun
try's peace and security.
Apartheid is enforced by a
brutal and powerful police force
and army (thanks to the U.S.,
Britain, France and Israel).
During 1975 to '77, the military
budget increased 80 percent in
response to the urban protests
and increased guerrilla warfare
in South Africa and neighboring
countries.
It seems that the whites of
South Africa would rather shoot
blacks than talk to them about
the establishment of a just soci
ety.
Not surprisingly, the political
and economic structures of
apartheid are rejected by the
majority of the people in that
country. There is in South
Africa a long history of political
protest, of petitions, demon
strations, and appeals for jus
tice. The African National Con
gress of South Africa was
formed in 1912 to fight
apartheid. But all African
peaceful agitation has been
ruthlessly smashed, while the
oppression has grown even
harsher.
Black women in South Africa
suffer a double oppression. As
blacks they are landless people,
foreigners in their native land.
As women they are denied even
the few rights allowed black
men. Though black women are
repressed by apartheid more
than black men, they, too, are
struggling in every possible
way. Women's resistance to the
pass laws goes all the way back
to 1913, when mass demonstra
tions led to the government's
withdrawing the pass law for

women.
In 1955, however, in an effort
to drive all women not em
ployed as domestics back to the
"homelands," pass laws were
again instituted for women.
Demonstrations by African
women began at once. In August
1956 nearly 20,000 women dem
onstrated in Pretoria. This time
the government would not back
down, but as a song from the
anti-pass demonstration in Pre
toria said, "Now that you have
touched the women you have
struck a rock, you have disloged
a boulder, you will be crushed."
Finally, even the extreme pa
tience of Africans has been ex
hausted, for when other means
fail, men and women are willing
to die for freedom. A war has
been won in Zimbabwe; it has
begun in Nambia (Southwest
Africa). In Azania (South
Africa), the people have begun
to rise in spontaneous revolt.
The conflict in Southern
Africa is not a capitalist versus
communist struggle at all; it is
a nationalist struggle for politi
cal freedom and human equal
ity. The final result is therefore
certain. What is yet to be de
termined is the means by which
nationalism will triumph, the
human suffering which will be
involved in the struggle and the
extent to which the rest of the
world will be militarily in
volved.
