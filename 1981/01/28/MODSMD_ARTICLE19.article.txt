## Somnambulic Senate hearing 
### 
At 7:30 a.m. Joe hears the now familiar voice of
Senator Charles Percy drift across the room and
rouse him from his drowsy state.
"I must still be dreaming," he thinks. Then he
realizes that he would never dream the voice of
Senator Percy.
Joe, having gone to sleep the night before to the
strains of classical music on National Public Ra
dio, wakes up to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee questioning of Secretary-of-State-des
ignate Alexander Haig. "May as well listen in,"
thinks Joe, and leans over to turn up the volume on
the clock radio.
A newscaster says, "This is Senator Hay
akawa."
"General Haig, I recently went on a trip to
Japan. Well, let me tell you. The food was great."
Joe hears a long pause, then a slight snoring
sound, then some rustling.
"Huh? Oh, oh. Yes, yes. Well, as I was saying.
The people in the Philippines are quite willing to
have American support. I mean, for every one
spot in the American Armed Forces, we have 10
applicants.
"And what about China, General?
"Well anyway, since I PERSONALLY got so
chummy with so many people over there, and they
ALL seemed to like ME so much, and they have so
much respect for age, I said to myself, Hey, why
not run for another term?' And besides, the Re
publicans have a majority now, right General?
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzz ..."
"Senator, you and your colleagues know that it
would be extremely detrimental for me to state
any position without a signed note from Ronny.
Dicky used to do the same thing. Just before the
big boo boo. But thank the Lord that I had nothing
to do with that big mess of which I, of course, have
no recollection and only found out. about five
minutes ago."

"After all, General. . .
The newscaster cuts in, "Senator Pell, Demo
crat from Rhode Island."
"... it's all water under the gate- er - bridge,
right? What's the point of mentioning the Cambo
dian bombings, or misdeeds in Korea, or the ques
tionable dealings of Kissinger, or the way you
dealt with NATO, or the Vietnam war — you, you
. . . Republican!
"Well. . . ahem . . . how can we succeed in the
orient, General?"
"Only with a strong position towards Red, I
mean communist, I mean the People's Republic
of China. As opposed to the Republic of Taiwan.
See, I know. Heh, heh. Don't try to tell me I need to
brush up on the Far East.
"Besides, Europe is really the only thing which
matters, guys. I mean, really."
"Perhaps . . .
"Chairman Percy," whispers the newscaster.
"... We should clarify the General's last
statement for our TV and radio audience, which I
was, by the way, horrified — I mean pleasantly
surprised — to learn is quite sizable. The general
refers to the way in which the new administration
is going to build up support around the world for
American democracy and all those good things.
And we know that even communists can be okay
sometimes, sort of.
"We'll adjourn for three hours while I go and
draft one of my super-extra fantastic bills which I
always do for my constituents at home, even when
I don't know whether or not they're watching on
TV."
"Yes," thinks Joe, "the voice and the words
have become quite familiar over the past week."
He clicks off the radio, rolls over, and goes back to
sleep
