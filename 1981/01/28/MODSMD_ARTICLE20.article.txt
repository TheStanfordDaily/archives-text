## Autos could get 50 mpg in 15 years; new report's release still blocked 
### Washington Post 
Washington — American car makers
could produce a fleet of vehicles averaging
45 or 50 miles per gallon by 1995 if the federal
government required them to do so, says a
study completed in the final days of the
Carter administration but never made pub
lic.
Setting new federal mileage standards
for the decade after 1985, when present fed
eral fuel economy mandates expire, could
cut the nation's oil imports by at least 20
percent from current levels, according to
the report by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration.
Former Secretary of Transportation Neil
Goldschmidt refused to release the report,
and Drew Lewis, Ronald Reagan's trans
port chief, is expected to reject the recom
mendation. A copy of the NHTSA study was
obtained by The Washington Post.
Goldschmidt, the Reagan transition team
and auto company executives insist there is
no need for additional federal regulation of
automobile fuel economy. Market forces —
including rising fuel prices and increased
public awareness of energy issues — will
lead the industry to improve its gas
mileage, they argue.
The NHTSA study disputes both conten
tions. It warns that complacency by con
sumers and reluctance by car makers could
frustrate efforts to maximize fuel economy
and force the nation to import millions of
barrels of additional oil.
The debate could set up an early confron
tation between lingering liberals who be
lieve in regulation and up-and-coming con
servatives opposed in principle to any gov
ernment interference in the marketplace.
Regardless of whether more efficient
cars are built by government fiat or in
dustry initiative, there are more than a
dozen ways to improve gas mileage using
existing technology, says the NHTSA report
and another study released last month by
the Congressional Budget Office.
Rising fuel use
Since 1975 the average fuel utilization of
domestic cars has increased from 14.8 miles

per gallon to 21 mpg. American car makers,
who were complaining less than two years
ago that they could not meet a government
mandate of 27.5 mpg by 1985, now say their
fleets will average 31 mpg by then.
Present law does not increase the min
imum mileage standard after 1985; NHTSA
on Monday filed a formal request for com
ment on post-1985 fuel economy standards.
Without endorsing any future regulation,
the CBO last month concluded that "exist
ing technologies coupled with market shifts
to smaller cars, could bring the average
new fleet fuel economy to about 37 to 42 mpg
by 1995."
The NHTSA report says even more miser
ly cars are possible: "The domestic manu
facturers probably can have the technolog
ical capability to increase average fuel
economy of passenger autos by 1995 to the
neighborhood of 45 to 50 mpg."
Cost-benefit analysis
Ironically the NHTSA study utilizes one
of the conservatives' favorite techniques,
cost-benefit analysis, to justify new fuel
economy regulations.
The NHTSA analysis says the present fed
eral gas mileage rules save the average
buyer of a 1980 car $1700 in gasoline (at $1.25
a gallon) and will produce an additional sav
ing of $1600 for buyers of 1985 cars, even if
gasoline prices do not increase.
The CBO report estimates it will cost $600
to $650 to further improve passenger car
fuel economy. But over 100,000 miles, the
more efficent cars will save $1100 worth of
gas. The benefit exceeds the cost by about
$500, the CBO concluded.
But the bills for increased fuel economy
first will have to be paid by the automakers,
and the CBO estimates they will have to in
vest between $8 billion and $12 billion a year
to produce 40-mpg cars by the 19905.
The industry spends about $7 billion a
year for "business-as-usual" capital re
quirements and will have to come up with an
extra $1 billion to $5 billion annually. Such
massive expenditures are "likely to con

tinue to strain the industry's financial ca
pacity," the agency warns.
Operating efficiency
But if Detroit fails to spend the money
necessary to make the most efficient cars
possible, foreign car makers will continue
to take away a massive share of the business
by offering consumers cars that get better
gas mileage. And foreign oil producers will
continue to drain billions of dollars a year
out of the U.S. economy.
The way to reduce the amount of gasoline
and diesel fuel burned by passenger cars is
not to force everyone to trade in big cars for
little ones, but to improve the operating effi
ciency of present-size cars, the NHTSA sug
gests.
Only a 1.2-mpg gain in average gas
mileage will result from a massive shift to
smaller cars in the next five years, NHTSA
researchers said.
Getting to a 45-mpg or 50-mpg fleet aver
age by the 1990s will require paring the
weight of the average car by another 350
pounds, installing diesel engines in 35
percent to 40 percent of all autos and pursu
ing several other avenues to efficiency, the
study says. None of the changes requires
any technological breakthrough, but many
of them demand widespread utilization of
little-used innovations.
Mostly, however, the prescription is to
continue existing auto industry trends:
more downsizing, more front-wheel drive,
more diesels, more electronic engine con
trols, etc.
The main difference btween CBO
projections that these changes could pro
duce a fleet of 40-mpg cars by 1995 and
NHTSA's projected 45-to 50-mpg average is
the separate estimates on how fast the in
novations can be adopted.
That depends on how much the auto in
dustry can afford to invest in new plans,
plants and equipment. Both government
agencies contend that the auto industry has
exaggerated the cost of current fuel econo
my mandates.
