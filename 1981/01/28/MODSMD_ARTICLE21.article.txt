# Will cameras make for better justice?
## Lawyer hails news media in courts 
### 
Washington (AP) — Hailing a
Supreme Court decision uphold
ing the right of states to allow
televised trials, a media lawyer
suggests cameras in the
courtroom make for better jus
tice.
J. Laurent Scharff, attorney
for 15 news organizations, said
one trial judge in a Florida case
found that the presence of tele
vision sharpened his attention
rather than distracting him.
"As for the witnesses, the
more public it is, the more likely
they are to tell the truth,"
Scharff said.
Scharff's comments came
Monday in response to a unani
mous Supreme Court ruling that
states have the right to allow
television, radio and photo
graphic coverage of criminal
trials even if the defendant ob

jects.
Although the decision did not
guarantee news media a night to
insist on such coverage, it made
it clear that any state is free to
allow cameras and micro
phones into courtrooms as long
as,the defendant's right to a fair
trial is protected.
Broadcasting networks
The high court's ruling, stem
ming from a burglary trial in
Florida, had been sought by a
wide range of news organiza
tions and journalistic societies
including the major broad
casting networks, the American
Society of Newspaper Editors,
the Radio Television News Di
rectors Association and The As
sociated Press.
It was opposed by the Ameri
can College of Trial Lawyers,
which offered no immediate

comment, and by the California
State Public Defenders Associa
tion and other California legal
organizations.
Herbert Barish, who repre
sented the California groups,
said in an interview that the
presence of TV will affect the
way people behave during a
trial.
Florida burglary
The high court's decision
arose from the arrest and con
viction of two Miami Beach po
licemen who were caught bur
glarizing a restaurant in 1977.
The two were using walkie
talkies to communicate and
were inadvertently overheard
by an amateur radio operator
who notified the police depart
ment.
The unusual case drew public
attention which included tele

vision coverage, permitted by
Florida in recent years.
In a 1965 decision, the Su
preme Court had overturned the
swindling conviction of Texas
financier Billie Sol Estes be
cause of television coverage of
that celebrated case.
But the high court's new de
cision said the Estes ruling did
not mean that TV or photogra
phers must be banned forever
under all circumstances.
In the Florida trial, the court
said, "The defendants have of
fered no evidence that any par
ticipant in this case was af
fected by the presence of cam
eras."
And without such evidence, it
added, "there is no reason for
this Court either to endorse or to
invalidate Florida's experi
ment."
