# Kelly and codefendants found guilty
## 'Bizarre' Abscam trial 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — A federal jury, in a surpris
ingly swift verdict for so long and complicated
a trial, found former Rep. Richard Kelly (R-
Fla), and two codefendants guilty of bribery
and conspiracy charges here Monday, ending
what was perhaps the most bizarre of the seven
Abscam trials to date.
The trial had lasted 26 days, spread over
eight weeks, had involved 36 witnesses, had
produced about 6000 pages of transcripts and
had cost one of the defendants, Stanley Weisz
of Smithtown, N.Y., about $12,000 in hotel bills
alone. But the jury spent less than five hours in
deliberations before sending a note to Judge
William Bryant of U.S. District Court shortly
after 4 p.m., informing him a decision had been
reached.
The verdict — guilty on all three counts for
all three defendants — was read by foreman
David Peacock, a loan officer at the Export-
Import Bank, who stood ramrod stiff as he
read the verdicts.
"Guilty," he said, on the first count against
the 56-year-old Kelly, charging him with ac
cepting a bribe. "Guilty, guilty," on counts two
and three, which accused Kelly of conspiracy
and traveling across state lines while commit
ting a crime. "Guilty . . . guilty . . . guilty" in
the case of Weisz, an accountant who received
$50,000 for helping arrange a meeting between
Kelly and the FBI undercover team. "Guilty"
on all charges in the case of Gino Ciuzio, who
also helped arrange the meeting between Kelly
and the FBI operatives, who were passing
themselves off as representatives of
anonymous Arabs.
Almost none of the jurors would talk with re
porters after the verdict, but their quick action
suggests that they gave short shrift to Kelly's
contention that he had taken the money not as a
bribe but as part of a private investigation of
"shady characters" whom he feared were
trying to infiltrate his office.
One reason for the jurors' doubt may have
been that Kelly quickly went out and spent
some of the $25,000 in cash he had received. An
other cause for the jury's finding may have

been Kelly's inability to cite a single thing he
had done to document his "investigation," or
to assemble evidence so that anyone with a
background as a prosecutor and judge — which
he has been — might be expected to do.
Later, outside the court, Kelly said that his
private investigation would continue and"it
now includes the government" as well as the
"shady characters" he had told the jurors
about during four days on the witness stand.
The case was unusual not only because of
Kelly's defense but because Kelly and his two
codefendants were so at odds with each other.
He called them "shady characters" and they,
in turn, called him a crook.
All three said that they would appeal, and
Michael Dennis, Weisz' attorney, quickly filed
a motion asking Judge Bryant to set aside the
verdict. "I think my client is innocent, and I
think he will ultimately be acquitted," Dennis
said.
The strategy crafted by Dennis called for
both Weisz and Ciuzio, a client of Weisz' who
acted as his own attorney, to concede that they
might have been trying to con the Arabs out of
some money, but that this was neither a con
spiracy nor a crime — and certainly not the
crime charged in the indictment.
The first sign that this would fail came in
mid-afternoon when the jurors sent a note to
Judge Bryant saying that they wanted a replay
of a videotape in which Weisz is filmed on Sept.
12, 1979, talking with the FBI operatives about
how to hide money in escrow accounts. This
had been made much of by Stephen Spivack
one of the prosecutors, who said it showed that
Weisz was really the mastermind of the al
leged conspiracy, the man trying to ensure that
any bribe money from the Arabs could be hid
den from authorities.
The Department of Justice has obtained con
victions in all its Abscam cases to date, al
though convictions against two local coun
cilmen in Philadelphia were dismissed be
cause the judge found misconduct on the part
of the government and seven others — includ
ing one present and four former congressmen
— are appealing the verdicts.
