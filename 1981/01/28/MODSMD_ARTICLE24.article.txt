# Homecoming brings patriotic celebration — 'the war is over'
## 
### Washington Post 
Highland Falls, N.Y. — You got a lump In
your throat when the motorcade of the freed
hostages crept along Main Street in this small,
Hudson River village just outside the West
Point gate. You couldn't help it. The cheers of
the crowd were thunderous, the tears genuine.
Even the drunks rushed out of a bar singing
"God Bless America."
Everyone sensed that something momen
tous had happened, something different and
badly needed: it was a fine moment for Amer
ica.
I was in Saigon six years ago just before it
fell, and choppering out of that frantic, smok
ing city gave you a lump in the throat, too, but
it was a bitter lump that stayed bitter over the
years.
They have been years during which Ameri
ca never fully recovered from the wrecking of
its honor and moral purpose in the rice fields
of Asia. So many died and were maimed there,
and for what? When we left in panic, it was a
shabby disgrace because we left behind tens
of thousands who had staked their lives on our
cause.
After that there was the Mayaguez and our
soldiers died. There was an oil crisis in the
Middle East that cut into everybody's
paycheck and that we couldn't control. Soviet

tanks rumbled into Afghanistan and we
couldn't stop them. Finally, for 444 terrible
days, we couldn't do anything but watch as our
countrymen were held captive during a long
period of national disgrace.
Now, it has ended well and with honor, and
today in the streets and shops of this village,
you can feel the love of country as a palpable
thing. It is not hostile or warlike, but simply
joyous.

News analysis

The homecoming of the freed hostages has
become the occasion for an unprecedented pa
triotic celebration in this tiny village, as
across America.
"I just got so excited I had goose bumps,"
said Winnie Gee as she was serving breakfast
Monday morning at Bev & Lynn's eatery. She
was talking to Normal Drew, the town clerk.
"It was better than the Fourth of July parade,
Norm, even though you're in charge and it's a
dandy parade."
"The young people were out there, too, and
that's what got me," put in Lee Dapra, who
was having a cup of coffee with Drew.
Ernie Conlie, 41, has lived here all his life.
He owns a men's clothing store, Shorter's, on
Main Street, and he says Highland Falls has
never seen anything like this before. "The last

excitement I can remember like this was
when I was a child and Eisenhower returned
to West Point after World War II," he said,
adding, "but there wasn't nearly the turnout
then."
When you talk to people here, you feel like
you're walking through the streets of
Thornton Wilder's play Our Town, which
captures the simple and good side of Ameri
can life. Here today you sense a yearning for
that kind of goodness, a revulsion at the vio
lence and insanity of world events.
Here is Richard Limato, the young princi
pal of the elementary school at Sacred Heart
of Jesus Church on Main Street: "It means a
return of national pride, something we've
been missing for a long time, and people are
really beginning to feel good about their coun
try .. . yesterday while I was watching the
hostages return to West Point, we were sur
rounded by strangers, yet everyone was so
comfortable with everyone and there was a
strong feeling and strong spirit among the
people. I said to myself, 'It feels great to say
you are an American!' "
Stylish Mary Lou Bullotta runs ML Hair De
signers on Main Street and she was serving
free champagne out front as the freed
hostages came through town Sunday. Monday
she was asked for the meaning of the event.
"The war is over," she said, without hesita
tion. "It's like a strength that came out of peo

pie, a companionship. It is incredible, a good
feeling with everyone sharing something."
There were appparently some who feel bit
ter rather than joyous, and that was evident in
at least one sign along the parade route Sun
day: "May God Damn That Man In Iran." An
other somewhat bellicose sign said: "No
More Mr. Nice Guy."
But those were exceptions. Far more nu
merous were the signs welcoming the
hostages home and celebrating the freedom
enjoyed by Americans. "Freedom — How
Sweet It Is," proclaimed a big red banner still
flying over one town shop yesterday. The
white clapboard house at 116 Main St. had a
yellow sign on the front door reading quaintly
but clearly, "Free To Be You and Me! Praise
Be!"
The return of the freed hostages has pene
trated deep into family life. "I was there with
my daughter and husband. I want my daugh
ter to remember this day forever," said Linda
Freson, a secretary in the village mayor's of
fice. "That night she said, 'Mommie, I wonder
what the hostages are dreaming about?' I
said, They're dreaming they're still in pris
on.' "
Freson is a naturalized citizen, a former
Cuban who has lived in the United States eight
years. "I had a taste of what it's like to live in
a revolutionary country, so I value America,"

she said. "For me, it (the hostages' release)
means something very special — the freedom
you have here that you don't have anywhere
else."
She thought for a moment and then added:
"The only sad thing is the Vietnam veterans
and POWs didn't really get a reception like
this — they suffered for no cause at all be
cause it was a waste."
Tony Servedio was tending bar inside the
Hotel Thayer on Sunday night and recalled
that the former hostages who chatted with
him "couldn't believe it, they couldn't believe
there were wall-to-wall people all the way
from Stewart field. One told me he got about
half-way here and he started crying. He was
just overwhelmed with emotion."
The mayor of this village has a beard and
bears a slight resemblance to Abe Lincoln.
His name is Ben Eazzetta, and when he's not
being mayor, he's foreman of a bricklaying
crew over at West Point. He was asked if he
could see any meaning beyond the emotion
and hoopla and he said:
"I think it's gonna last. I think other coun
tries are going to realize that our little com
munities all over the U.S. are tightly knit. If
the whole U.S. can think this much of 52 peo
ple, then other countries should be aware of
the fact that this is a hell of a great country
that's going to stick together."
