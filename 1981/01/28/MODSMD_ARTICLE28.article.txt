# Eleven hostages decline conference appearance
## 
### Associated Press 
Eleven men weren't there.
Eleven men, military and ci
vilian, married and single,
young and middle-aged, from
both coasts and from the places
between. Eleven men who
stayed away from the West
Point, N.Y., press conference
held Tuesday by the other 41
who had been held hostage in
Iran.
Who are they? Why did they
shun the spotlight and, in shun
ning it, draw its glare?
Attendance at the conference
was voluntary. State Depart
ment officials in Washington,
who asked not to be named, said
most of the 11 absentees did not
feel emotionally up to taking
part and others had their own
reasons for not attending. There
was no further explanation.
A look at the backgrounds of
the 11 and at their words since
their release a week ago shows
little to bind them together or
set them apart from the others.
The 11 included four military
men: Marine Sgt. Gregory Per
singer, 23, of Seaford, Del.;
Army Sgt. Donald Hohman, 39,
of West Sacramento, Calif.;
Army Staff Sgt. Joseph Subic
Jr., 23, of Eedford Township,
Mich., and Navy Petty Officer
2nd Class Duane Gillette, 24,
from Columbia, Pa.
Six were civilian government
workers: Clair Barnes, 35, of
Falls Church, Va., who served
in the communications section
of the embassy in Tehran;
Donald Cooke, 25, of Memphis,
Tenn., the embassy vice consul;
Frederick Lee Kupke, 34, of
Francesville, Ind., an elec
tronics specialist; Michael
Metrinko, 34, of Olyphant, Pa.,
embassy political officer ; Jerry
Miele, 42, of Mount Pleasant,
Pa., another communications
officer; and Phillip Ward, 40, of
Culpeper, Va., embassy admin
istrative officer.
The 11th former hostage who
did not appear was Jerry
Plotkin, 47, of Sherman Oaks,
Calif., a businessman who was
visiting the embassy when it
was stormed on Nov. 4, 1979.
Plotkin was reportedly shaken
Monday night by reporters'
questions about stories in the
Daily News of Van Nuys, Calif.,

alleging he was being in
vestigated for possible drug
dealing. Plotkin's wife, De
borah, has called the stories "ri
diculous."
In their few public statements
and in comments to their fami
lies, the 11 men have told of
fright and faith, meager diets
and defiance. They have told of
their joy at being home. One,
Persinger, jogged away from
reporters who tried to approach
him while he was getting some
exercise at West Point. In gen
eral, however, the words and be
havior of the 11 have been simi
lar to those of the 41 former cap
tives who did appear at the
press conference.

'Once the guards were so mad at me they
took away all of my family pictures . . . I
guess I never had any hope from the
beginning. Sometimes I thought Vd never
see the sun rise again.'

President Ronald Reagan has
been told that perhaps a quarter
of the 52 are suffering psy
chologically, but there was no
indication Tuesday that the 11
who did not appear were those
reported to be troubled.
Hohman was one of the most
vocal of the returnees last week.
He told interviewers in
Wiesbaden, West Germany, of
his animosity toward his cap
tors: "I'm not a hateful person,
but I've learned from pro
fessionals how to do it."
Hohman said that during cap
tivity he fasted "when I was
mad about something." When
ever he fasted, he said, he was
put in solitary confinement.
"Once the guards were so
mad at me they took away all of
my family pictures ... I guess I
never had any hope from the be
ginning. Sometimes I thought
I'd never see the sun rise
again." He also was quoted as
saying, "It got worse toward the
end."
Once at West Point, however,
he sounded a little more
cheerful. "I'm depressed some

times," he admitted, but added:
"I did expect to get out of cap
tivity sometime or other. . . but
I didn't know how long it would
be. I feel great emotion to be
home. It is just great."
Metrinko told a television re
porter from his hometown that
he had been kept in solitary for
BV2 months and did not even rec
ognize some of his fellow cap
tives when he met them at the
Tehran airport.
In a copyright interview pub
lished Tuesday by the Scranton
(Pa.) Times, Metrinko said he
had warned the United States
before the shah's overthrow
that the regime was in trouble.

He said, however, that "Ameri
can business, American govern
ment if you will. . . had a great
stake in Iran at that time — a
stake that Iran remain as it
was."
Gillette spoke by phone with
relatives. "His treatment was
disgusting," said a family
spokesman. "We know that his
letters were covering up what
the real situation was. There
was no physical torture, but
there was psychological pres
sure."
Kupke's sister, Elizabeth
Hopkins of Terre Haute, Ind..
said her brother had told her the
militants often displayed mail
addressed to the hostages —
then burned it. They stole "eve
rything he had," she said. "He
had to borrow clothes so he
could leave."
Miele said in an interview in
the Greensburg (Pa.) Tribune-
Review that he had been "very
depressed," and added: "Some
of the psychological harassment
they had, I considered it to be
pretty hard. In fact, eliminate
'pretty hard.' You can put
'harsh.'"
