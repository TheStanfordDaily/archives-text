# Nation celebrates return of hostages
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — Washington, a cere
monial city accustomed to taking in
stride everything from the return of
victorious armies to astronauts from
outer space, welcomed home 52 Amer
icans from the isolation of captivity in
Iran yesterday with an unabashed, un
ashamed outpouring of emotion. Their
arrival touched off a display of feeling
seldom equalled in the history of the
nation's capital.
It was supposed to have been a day
of subdued greeting because of the suf
fering these Americans endured dur
ing their 14V» months of imprison
ment. Instead, it became a day of
spontaneous national celebration un
matched in many years.
The formal part of the drama ended
with the new president of the United
States, Ronald Reagan, speaking ex
actly one week to the day after taking
office, telling the returned Americans
to "turn the page and look ahead" —
but also warning the world of lessons
the nation draws from this episode.
"Let terrorists be aware that when
the rules of international behavior are
violated," Reagan said, "our policy
will be one of swift and effective
retribution. We hear it said that we
live in an era of limits to power. Well,
let it also be understood there are lim
its to our patience."
Responding to the president for the
freed Americans, Bruce Laingen, the
senior diplomat among them, referred
to "the emotionally draining but beau
tiful experience that all of us have just
had on the streets of this magnificent
city." They would all always have a
"love affair" with the American peo
ple, he added.
That emotion was reciprocated.
With cheers and songs, tears and fire
works, and everywhere a blizzard of
flags waving along a processional
route that began in the Maryland coun
tryside and ended with the singing of
"God Bless America" on the south
lawn of the White House, residents of
the capital tried to tell their fellow
Americans how they felt.
They lined the parkways, stood 20
deep along the traditional parade
route of the presidents and surged out
into the streets behind the buses car
rying the Americans on the way to the
White House reception Police said

some half a million people turned out,
although those crowd counts always
rank among the least accurate of the
Washington sciences. But there was
no mistaking the genuineness of their
demonstration of affection.
Their message was both simple and
complex: that the ordeal of the people
Americans had learned to call, sim
ply, "the hostages" had become in
separable from that of the country
they served; that their experience had
unified the nation as no other event in
decades; and that their liberation had
ignited a surge of joyous national
pride.
Meanwhile, the Reagan adminis
tration strongly warned Americans
yesterday against traveling to Iran,
because the United States is unable to
protect them from being arrested or
taken hostage.
The warning, issued by the State
Department, had the practical effect
of replacing the ban on such travel im
posed by President Jimmy Carter last
April 23 during the impasse over the
American hostages.
That ban was lifted as part of the
agreement freeing the Americans,
and department officials said the new
warning, while not prohibiting U.S.
citizens from going to Iran, is intended
to make them aware of the danger of
such travel.
Department spokesman William
Dyess said, "All U.S. citizens should
avoid such travel because of the conti
nuing anti-American feeling, the war
between Iran and Iraq and the vir
ulently anti-American stance of the
Iranian government."
He said the warning applies to tour
ists, journalists and businessmen,
adding that it had been prompted, in
part, by reports that the ending of U.S.
sanctions against Iran has caused
some U.S. firms to consider resuming
trade and other business with that
country. The State Department, he
said, is advising businessmen with
such ideas to "go slow."
In the meantime, the Justice De
partment announced that it is asking
U.S. federal courts to delay for 30 days
acting on claims against Iranian as
sets in this country. Justice officials
said the requested delay is to allow the
new administration to finish studying

the terms of the agreement under
which the hostages were released.
As part of the agreement, concluded
in the last hours of the Carter adminis
tration, the U.S. government is sup
posed to cancel claims by individuals
and firms against Iranian assets
frozen in this country and refer the
claims to an international commission
for settlement. Iran has said it will
abide by the commission s decisions.
However, some of the more than 300
claimants have objected to this pro
cedure, and have moved in the courts
to nullify the part of the agreement
that would take their claims out of
American legal jurisdiction.

Dyess said, "All U.S. citizens should
avoid such travel because of the conti
nuing anti-American feeling, the war
between Iran and Iraq and the vir
ulently anti-American stance of the
Iranian government."
He said the warning applies to tour
ists, journalists and businessmen,
adding that it had been prompted, in
part, by reports that the ending of U.S.
sanctions against Iran has caused
some U.S. firms to consider resuming
trade and other business with that
country. The State Department, he
said, is advising businessmen with
such ideas to "go slow."
In the meantime, the Justice De
partment announced that it is asking
U.S. federal courts to delay for 30 days
acting on claims against Iranian as
sets in this country. Justice officials
said the requested delay is to allow the
new administration to finish studying

the terms of the agreement under
which the hostages were released.
As part of the agreement, concluded
in the last hours of the Carter adminis
tration, the U.S. government is sup
posed to cancel claims by individuals
and firms against Iranian assets
frozen in this country and refer the
claims to an international commission
for settlement. Iran has said it will
abide by the commission s decisions.
However, some of the more than 300
claimants have objected to this pro
cedure, and have moved in the courts
to nullify the part of the agreement
that would take their claims out of
American legal jurisdiction.
From the Daily wire services
Washington — Washington, a cere
monial city accustomed to taking in
stride everything from the return of
victorious armies to astronauts from
outer space, welcomed home 52 Amer
icans from the isolation of captivity in
Iran yesterday with an unabashed, un
ashamed outpouring of emotion. Their
arrival touched off a display of feeling
seldom equalled in the history of the
nation's capital.
It was supposed to have been a day
of subdued greeting because of the suf
fering these Americans endured dur
ing their 14V» months of imprison
ment. Instead, it became a day of
spontaneous national celebration un
matched in many years.
The formal part of the drama ended
with the new president of the United
States, Ronald Reagan, speaking ex
actly one week to the day after taking
office, telling the returned Americans
to "turn the page and look ahead" —
but also warning the world of lessons
the nation draws from this episode.
"Let terrorists be aware that when
the rules of international behavior are
violated," Reagan said, "our policy
will be one of swift and effective
retribution. We hear it said that we
live in an era of limits to power. Well,
let it also be understood there are lim
its to our patience."
Responding to the president for the
freed Americans, Bruce Laingen, the
senior diplomat among them, referred
to "the emotionally draining but beau
tiful experience that all of us have just
had on the streets of this magnificent
city." They would all always have a
"love affair" with the American peo
ple, he added.
That emotion was reciprocated.
With cheers and songs, tears and fire
works, and everywhere a blizzard of
flags waving along a processional
route that began in the Maryland coun
tryside and ended with the singing of
"God Bless America" on the south
lawn of the White House, residents of
the capital tried to tell their fellow
Americans how they felt.
They lined the parkways, stood 20
deep along the traditional parade
route of the presidents and surged out
into the streets behind the buses car
rying the Americans on the way to the
White House reception Police said

some half a million people turned out,
although those crowd counts always
rank among the least accurate of the
Washington sciences. But there was
no mistaking the genuineness of their
demonstration of affection.
Their message was both simple and
complex: that the ordeal of the people
Americans had learned to call, sim
ply, "the hostages" had become in
separable from that of the country
they served; that their experience had
unified the nation as no other event in
decades; and that their liberation had
ignited a surge of joyous national
pride.
Meanwhile, the Reagan adminis
tration strongly warned Americans
yesterday against traveling to Iran,
because the United States is unable to
protect them from being arrested or
taken hostage.
The warning, issued by the State
Department, had the practical effect
of replacing the ban on such travel im
posed by President Jimmy Carter last
April 23 during the impasse over the
American hostages.
That ban was lifted as part of the
agreement freeing the Americans,
and department officials said the new
warning, while not prohibiting U.S.
citizens from going to Iran, is intended
to make them aware of the danger of
such travel.
