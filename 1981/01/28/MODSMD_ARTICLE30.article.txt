# Gas alternative loses popularity
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Gasohol, a blend of alcohol and gasoline
trumpeted during the 1978-79 fuel shortage
as an answer to long lines and uncertain
prices at the nation's service stations, has
run into hard times..
With gasoline again in plentiful supply,
gasohol sales tumbled late last year, and
now one major marketer says it plans to
curtail an ambitious gasohol marketing pro
gram.
"The shine is off the program," said Rus
ty Brett, manager of retail marketing for
Texaco Inc., one of the country's largest
marketers of gasohol, which contains 10
percent alcohol.
Gasohol is used as a substitute for regular
unleaded gasoline and even though it was
priced at 3 to 5 cents more per gallon, sales
of the new blend increased dramatically be
tween 1978 and 1980. The number of stations
selling gasohol jumped from little more
than 100 to 9000 in the two year period.
However, when the gasoline lines faded
and the novelty of gasohol as the "patriotic''
fuel wore off, motorists began to balk at the
higher prices.
The drop in demand now has some oil
companies worried.
"We will probably continue to increase
the number of stations we sell gasohol at,
but we will expand at a much slower rate,"
said Ray Steiner, a vice president of Phillips
Petroleum Co.
Texaco said that it would continue to sell
gasohol at 1700 of its stations, but that it has

no plans to expand its gasohol sales to more
outlets.
"We are taking a very conservative ap
proach to the product," Brett said. "During
the short gasohol supply it was a very big
seller and when we get into a supply squeeze
again we will already have our pumps in
place. But we are not in an expansion
phase."
Some industry observers believe that the
slowdown in gasohol sales is temporary.
When gasoline prices are fully decontrolled
on Oct. 1, the 3-cent to 5-cent price gap be
tween unleaded regular grade gasoline and
gasohol will diminish, they predict.
However, others said the market for
gasohol will probably grow in fits and starts
at best.
"You will not see the tremendous growth
of the last few years sustained and I doubt
that you will see any steady growth because
of price differential in most states," one
New York analyst said.
The price of gasohol is tied to the price of
corn, the primary feedstock of alcohol
plants. Some analysts believe that the pace
at which corn prices rise could very well
match the climb of gasoline prices.
Despite the 7 percent to 11 percent decline
in gasohol sales during the last half of 1980
compared with the same period in 1979, no
companies with plans to build alcohol plants
have cancelled or delayed projects.
(Gasohol sales for all of 1980 were actually
up by 50 percent to 1.1 billion gallons, thanks
to the strong sales in the first half of last

year.
The National Alcohol Fuels Commission
in Washington estimates that in the next
three to four years, the supply of alcohol for
gasohol will grow six-fold to 650 million
gallons, enough to replace close to 1 percent
of the gasoline sold in the United States.
Much of that capacity increase, however,
is still on the drawing board and could be de
layed.
"Obviously the abundant supply of
gasoline has tended to slow things down, but
we are still going ahead with plans to bring
on two new plants," said Douglas Snyder,
director of gasohol development for Archer-
Daniels-Midland, a company that last year
produced almost half of the 110 million
gallons of alcohol used to make gasohol.
Advocates of gasohol said that if the coun
try continues to have adequate supplies of
gasoline, the future of gasohol will depend
on the ability of marketers to sell the public
on gasohol as a better fuel than regular un
leaded gasoline.
Gasohol has a higher octane rating than
regular unleaded gasoline and marketers
contend that it reduces the ping in Detroit's
new cars. Most new cars produced since
1975 require unleaded fuel to comply with
federal anti-pollution standards.
"The motorist is really getting a better
product with gasohol," Phillips' Steiner
said. "Most of the people still buying
gasohol and paying the extra couple of cents
have realized this."

Texaco said that it would continue to sell
gasohol at 1700 of its stations, but that it has

no plans to expand its gasohol sales to more
outlets.
"We are taking a very conservative ap
proach to the product," Brett said. "During
the short gasohol supply it was a very big
seller and when we get into a supply squeeze
again we will already have our pumps in
place. But we are not in an expansion
phase."
Some industry observers believe that the
slowdown in gasohol sales is temporary.
When gasoline prices are fully decontrolled
on Oct. 1, the 3-cent to 5-cent price gap be
tween unleaded regular grade gasoline and
gasohol will diminish, they predict.
However, others said the market for
gasohol will probably grow in fits and starts
at best.
"You will not see the tremendous growth
of the last few years sustained and I doubt
that you will see any steady growth because
of price differential in most states," one
New York analyst said.
The price of gasohol is tied to the price of
corn, the primary feedstock of alcohol
plants. Some analysts believe that the pace
at which corn prices rise could very well
match the climb of gasoline prices.
Despite the 7 percent to 11 percent decline
in gasohol sales during the last half of 1980
compared with the same period in 1979, no
companies with plans to build alcohol plants
have cancelled or delayed projects.
(Gasohol sales for all of 1980 were actually
up by 50 percent to 1.1 billion gallons, thanks
to the strong sales in the first half of last

year.
The National Alcohol Fuels Commission
in Washington estimates that in the next
three to four years, the supply of alcohol for
gasohol will grow six-fold to 650 million
gallons, enough to replace close to 1 percent
of the gasoline sold in the United States.
Much of that capacity increase, however,
is still on the drawing board and could be de
layed.
"Obviously the abundant supply of
gasoline has tended to slow things down, but
we are still going ahead with plans to bring
on two new plants," said Douglas Snyder,
director of gasohol development for Archer-
Daniels-Midland, a company that last year
produced almost half of the 110 million
gallons of alcohol used to make gasohol.
Advocates of gasohol said that if the coun
try continues to have adequate supplies of
gasoline, the future of gasohol will depend
on the ability of marketers to sell the public
on gasohol as a better fuel than regular un
leaded gasoline.
Gasohol has a higher octane rating than
regular unleaded gasoline and marketers
contend that it reduces the ping in Detroit's
new cars. Most new cars produced since
1975 require unleaded fuel to comply with
federal anti-pollution standards.
"The motorist is really getting a better
product with gasohol," Phillips' Steiner
said. "Most of the people still buying
gasohol and paying the extra couple of cents
have realized this."
Gasohol, a blend of alcohol and gasoline
trumpeted during the 1978-79 fuel shortage
as an answer to long lines and uncertain
prices at the nation's service stations, has
run into hard times..
With gasoline again in plentiful supply,
gasohol sales tumbled late last year, and
now one major marketer says it plans to
curtail an ambitious gasohol marketing pro
gram.
"The shine is off the program," said Rus
ty Brett, manager of retail marketing for
Texaco Inc., one of the country's largest
marketers of gasohol, which contains 10
percent alcohol.
Gasohol is used as a substitute for regular
unleaded gasoline and even though it was
priced at 3 to 5 cents more per gallon, sales
of the new blend increased dramatically be
tween 1978 and 1980. The number of stations
selling gasohol jumped from little more
than 100 to 9000 in the two year period.
However, when the gasoline lines faded
and the novelty of gasohol as the "patriotic''
fuel wore off, motorists began to balk at the
higher prices.
The drop in demand now has some oil
companies worried.
"We will probably continue to increase
the number of stations we sell gasohol at,
but we will expand at a much slower rate,"
said Ray Steiner, a vice president of Phillips
Petroleum Co.
