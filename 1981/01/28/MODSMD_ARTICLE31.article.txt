# McCrea's Cards depend on Ann Miller

### Bill Beyda 
■ She's not dominant. Nor is she
a game-breaker in the form of
€pc-Stanford star Kimberly
Belton.
v But when the Stanford wom
en's basketball team wins, you
can bet that Ann Miller proba
bly had a lot to do with it. A solid

starting guard averaging in
double figures, she poses an of
fensive as well as a defensive
threat to the opposition.
Last year. Miller was a for
ward, but McCrea advised her
to switch to the guard position.
"Ann takes pressure off of the
point guard when she handles

the ball," McCrea said, before
praising her skills without the
ball. "She's an intelligent de
fensive player."
Miller is known for her con
sistent jump shot, which is her
main scoring threat. "Dotty
changed my style a bit when I
got here, and my range has im

proved," Miller said.
One of her few weaknesses is
her ball handling close to the
hoop and McCrea will work this
summer on making Miller a
threat on drives. Miller recog
nizes her weakness in this area.
"I tried driving more often one
game, and it worked pretty
well. But I'm still not confident
in my driving ability." If her
moves to the hoop do improve,
McCrea feels she will be "hard
to beat."
Playing basketball takes a lot
of the Portland, Ore. junior's
time. "It's hard to do all of your
work sometimes, especially at
the beginning and end of the
quarter, but if you plan it right,
it can be done," Miller said.
But no amount of planning
can make a loss any easier to
take. "Sometimes it can be de
pressing, especially if we have a
string of losses. Depending on
how we lost, and if it was my
fault, I'll be upset for anywhere
from a day to a week," Miller
said.
Miller feels the team's spirit
is usually beneficial to their per
formance. "It's when we don't
concentrate that we get into
trouble. When we concentrate,

we work very well together,"
she said.
The Cards' record (10-10 over
all, 1-3 in the NorCal Con
ference) doesn't reflect their
talent, according to Miller.
"The other teams have
played very well against us,"
Miller said. "We need a team ef
fort to produce a win, and we
don't always have all five girls
playing well at the same time.
Usually, I don't let the score ef
fect the way I play. I just try as
hard as I can all the time."
Lately, the Cards' losses have
been have been caused by a
scoring slump lasting for up to
six minutes as against USF. The
Cards have been unable to play
catch-up ball effectively of late,
but Miller feels the potential is
there. "We were down by a lot
against Montclair State, and we
caught them," she said.
"Basketball is not in my plans
after graduation," Miller said,
"I am thinking of either medical
school or graduate work in en
vironmental studies."
Miller and the rest of the
Cards will face the University of
Santa Clara in a NorCal Con
ference game tonight at Maples
Pavilion at 7:30.
