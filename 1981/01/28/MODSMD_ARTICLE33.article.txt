Oakland (AP) — The Oakland
Raiders were cheered yester
day in a parade through the
streets of the city that's fighting
to keep the newly crowned Su
per Bowl champions from mov
ing to Los Angeles.
"It's great of you all to partic
ipate in celebrating the great
victory we had Sunday. It's
fabulous," quarterback Jim
Plunkett told the crowd of sev
eral thousand fans who packed
the plaza at City Hall on the
rainy day.
After being driven in a motor
cade along city streets, players

and coaches spoke at a rally at
City Hall. Mayor Lionel Wilson
praised the Raiders for bringing
their second Super Bowl title
back to Oakland, but he also re
minded the crowd that the city
will continue the fight to keep
the team.
"The Oakland fans are the
No. 1 fans anywhere in the coun
try," offensive team captain
Gene Upshaw said at the rally.
"They can't take anything
away from us now because
we're No.l in the world," yelled
Rod Martin, the linebacker who
intercepted three passes in the

27-10 National Football League
title victory over the Philadel
phia Eagles Sunday.
A majority of the Raiders
took part in yesterday's parade,
although the team did not make
participation mandatory.
Several players did not return
to Oakland from New Orleans
Monday. Some headed for Ha
waii, where the Pro Bowl game
will be played Sunday, and oth
ers went to their homes
elsewhere in the country.
A 1 Davis, the NFL's most con
troversial team owner, "is still
in New Orleans and won't be

back for two or three days,"
said A 1 LoCasale, the team's ex
ecutive assistant.
Davis served notice to the
NFL last March that he in
tended to move the Raiders to
the vacant Los Angeles Col
iseum for the 1980 season. He
was blocked by court decisions
and also by other NFL owners,

who voted against the proposed
franchise move.
The decision to move to Los
Angeles was made after the
Raiders' stadium lease expired
and no agreement could be
reached on a new one. After
being forced to remain for 1980,
the Raiders signed a one-year
lease.
