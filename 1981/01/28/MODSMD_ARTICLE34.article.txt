The Stanford wrestlers pro
vided plenty of action last night,
but were unable to win close
matches in a 31-13 loss to San
Francisco State at Encina Gym.
Tim Daniels' match at 126
pounds exemplified the entire
meet. Daniels, who appeared to
be the better wrestler, missed
several near takedowns before
being suddenly trapped and
pinned in 7:20.
Derreck Strahorn, back from
a shoulder injury at 134 pounds,
used an early offensive ex
plosion to gain a 7-1 first period
lead and held on for a 14-9 de
cision. Although the effects of
his three-week absence showed
clearly late in the match,
Strahorn's varied attack domi
nated the early going complete
ly-
Momentum shifted at 142
pounds, and Stanford's Abie
DeAnda couldn't stop Richard
Martinez in a 20-6 loss by superi
or decision.
At 150 pounds, a late mistake
cost Bruce Rubin a six-point
lead and a victory. Up 7-1 in the
last period, Rubin gave up six
quick points to allow a 7-7 draw.
The fatal flurry began with a
freakish counter to Rubin's own
attack.
San Francisco State main
tained control at 158 pounds.
Stanford's Denny Childs, who
joined the team just last week,
was unable to muster any of
fense in a 6-1 defeat.

The Cards came roaring back
at 167 pounds, as Mark Martell
physically abused his opponent
in a 10-3 decision. Obviously
hobbled by the ankle injury that
sidelined him for two meets.
Martel nonetheless dealt his foe
the worst physical beating of the
evening.

At 177 pounds, Tom Mullen
dropped a very close 13-9 de
cision, but Doug Perkins
avenged the loss with a 22-2
demolition of the Gators' Kevin
Robinson. Stanford forfeits at
118 pounds and heavyweight
provided San Francisco State's
final 12 points.

The Cards' Denny Childs (front) found himself on the defensive too
much in a 6-1 loss last night.
