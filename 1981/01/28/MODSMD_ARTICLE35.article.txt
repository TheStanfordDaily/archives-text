The women's ASU victory
was a particularly thrilling one.
Not until the final event did
Stanford clinch the meet, and
they did it by edging the Sun
Devils in the 400-yard freestyle
relay by two-tenths of a second,
3:26.8 to 3:27.0.
In the lopsided victory over
Arizona, _ breaststroker Patty
Spees contributed two victories.
The men's narrow loss to Ari
zona was also decided in the last
event, the 400 free relay. This
was also a hotly contested race,
with the Wildcat foursome win
ning by just 3:06.1 to 3:07.0.
Unfair hockey win
No matter how you look at it,
the Stanford ice hockey club's

10-0 win over the Fresno Suns
Sunday at Belmont Iceland
wasn't a fair fight.
Brian Murphy led the winners
with a hat trick, while Les Land
sberger and Eric Lee added two
goals apiece. As the Stanford
squad built up its lead, the frus
tration of the Suns became evi
dent.
Fast on the heels of the frus
tration was dirty play, and the
game ended with Stanford's
David Speer suffering a broken
cheekbone courtesy of a Fresno
punch.
The Cards head to Berkeley
this weekend to play Cal, and
must be looking ahead to their
next home game. On February
15, they host these same Fresno
Suns.
Chisox to be sold
Chicago (AP) — Chicago
White Sox stockholders are ex
pected to approve today the sale
of the American League
baseball club to Jerry Reinsdorf
and Eddie Einhorn for $20 mil
lion.
The stockholder vote, follow
ing approval by the Board of Di
rectors earlier this month, is
such a formality that American

League owners have scheduled
a meeting tomorrow at which
they are expected to approve
sale of the club.
Edward Deßartolo Sr. was
approved by the White Sox di
rectors and stockholders twice
last autumn but league owners
denied approval of the sale both
times. Deßartolo was able to
get only three approving votes
the second time.
The reasons given for denying
sale to the Ohio businessman
were absentee ownership plus
the fact that Deßartolo has ex
tensive race track holdings in
Louisiana, Ohio and Illinois.
The fact that Reinsdorf, a
suburban Highland Park real
estate investor, also had put in a
matching bid for the club
strengthened the position of De-
Bartolo's opponents.
Spikers win in rain
The men 's volleyball team de
feated Santa Clara last night,
15-4, 15-7, 12-15 and 15-8. The
match was distinguished by a
leak in the Toso Pavilion roof
that allowed rain to fall inside
the arena. Look for more details
in Friday's Daily.
