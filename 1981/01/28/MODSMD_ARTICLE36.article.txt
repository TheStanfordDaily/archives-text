Hundreds missing in shipwreck
Jakarta. Indonesia — A burning Indonesian passenger
ship sank yesterday in the storm-tossed Java Sea and of
ficials said 570 people were missing and feared drowned in
what was believed to be the country's worst sea disaster.
Government spokesmen said 566 of the 1136 people
aboard the Tampomas 2 were rescued, but the fate of the
others was unknown.
A flotilla of 11 Indonesian navy vessels searched for sur
vivors. but rough seas kept all but one from coming close
to the burning ship
More than 60 rubber dinghies were air-dropped into the
stormy waters, a shipping official said.
The 2420-ton Tampomas 2 caught fire Sunday night
while crossing the Java Sea from Jakarta to Ujung Pan
dang, 1000 miles to the east. It was about 220 miles from its
destination when the fire broke out, possibly in one of the
166 cars aboard
Indonesian officials said the fire caused "almost uncon
trolled panic" among the 1054 passengers and 82 crew
members aboard.
A government official said 149 panicked passengers who
jumped into the sea Sunday night to get away from the fire
were rescued by another Indonesian passenger boat, the
K M. Sangihi.
Three search and rescue aircraft were sent out Monday,
but only one could find the ship. That plane reported three
fourths of the Tampomas 2 on fire, with people crowding
the front of the vessel.
The shipping sources said the crew brought the fire un
der control Monday afternoon
However, the rescue operation spokesman said, none of
the half-dozen ships, including several warships, sent to
aid the Tampomas 2 were able to approach it because of
the storm-whipped seas, and it went down at 1:40 p.m
(1:40 a.m. ESTi.
Islamic countries call for jihad
Taif, Saudi Arabia — The 37-nation Islamic summit dis
played unity on the emotional issue of Jerusalem yester
day and rallied behind new calls for a "jihad" or "holy
war" to wrest the Holy City from Israeli control.
Both Morocco's moderate King Hassan and PLO guer
rilla chief Yasser Arafat urged united action to regain
Arab sovereignty over Jerusalem.
After the speeches. Arafat — dressed in a battle jacket
and checked headdress — walked arm and arm with the
North African monarch from the glittering $300 million
conference hall
But as the summit neared its end today differences re
mained on how to handle such divisive issues as the Iran-
Iraq war and a resolution to condemn Soviet intervention
in Afghanistan.
Iran and Libya have boycotted the summit and Egypt
and Afghanistan have been suspended from the 42-nation
Islamic Conference.
In his speech, Hassan was careful to define "jihad" as a
"moral and material struggle" rather than a military

campaign against the Jewish state.
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Fahd sounded the call,
which has broad emotional appeal to the world's 800 mil
lion Moslems, last July after Israel's Parliament declared
the predominately Arab sector of Jerusalem part of its
unified and "eternal capital."
The threat of an Arab oil cutoff and U.N. condemnation
of the Israeli action caused 13 South American and Eu
ropean countries to move their embassies from Jerusalem
to Tel Aviv.
The eastern sector of Jerusalem, captured by Israel
from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War, is the site of Islam's
third holiest shrine — the A 1 Aksa Mosque.
The Moroccan monarch headed a committee that
drafted the Islamic summit's anti-Israel strategy and a
"Jerusalem document" was expected to be unveiled on to
day at a final session of the four-day summit.
In his speech. Hassan said Islamic leaders should have
resorted to "jihad" the"day Israel annexed Jerusalem.
But after research and consultation, we deemed the best
definition of jihad today and tomorrow is, in its broadest
sense, a moral and material struggle to attain the objec
tives prescribed by Allah."
Bani-Sadr accuses opponents
Beirut — A power struggle between Iran's clergy-domi
nated hardliners and President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr's
secular moderates escalated on yesterday, with the presi
dent charging opponents twice plotted to assassinate him
in the past two months.
The hardliners rallying behind Prime Minister Moham
mad Ali Rajai claimed Bani-Sadr's supporters attacked
and ransacked their Islamic Republican Party's head
quarters in the northeastern city of Mashhad, chanting
"close the nest of spies ."
Islamic revolutionaries used "spy nest" to signify the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran during the 444-day hostage ordeal
that also became a focal point in Bani-Sadr's struggle with
the clergy.
Bani-Sadr recently stepped up his criticism of the han
dling of the hostage crisis, claiming the agreement with
the United States negotiated by Rajai and his hardline as
sociates will return to Iran only $3 billion of the $11 billion
in funds frozen after the hostages were seized on Nov. 4,
1979.
The Iranian president also claims that Iran could have
reached a more favorable agreement with the United
States, that the agreement does not conform with condi
tions set down earlier for the hostages' release and that
the hostage-taking is responsible for Iran's current dif
ficulties, including its war with Iraq.
Rajai has defended the hostage agreement, saying the
country's problems result from the upheaval of revolu
tion. not from the holding of hostages.
Iran's internal bickering sharpened against the
backdrop of its slow war of attrition, now in its 19th week,
with Iraq in Iran's southwestern oil province of Khuzistan
and the western highlands.
Bani-Sadr disclosed the alleged assassination plots in a

daily war diary he writes in his Tehran newspaper,
Enghelab Islami Editors at the newspaper 's desk read the
gist of the charges on the telephone to The Associated
Press bureau in Beirut.
Assassins were to shoot the president during a speech at
a mass rally in the Khuzistan capital of Ahwaz to mark the
Shiite Moslem holy anniversary of Ashura on Nov. 19,
Bani-Sadr wrote. He said the plot was discovered in ad
vance by paramilitary units in Ahwaz.
The president wrote that the army's secret service re
ported the second plot to him on Jan. 14, saying his motor
cade was to be attacked by rocket-propelled grenade dur
ing one of his trips along the war front.
Although Bani-Sadr did not identify the alleged plotters
by name, he left no doubt that he was referring to his
domestic political rivals when he wrote that in both in
stances the plotters planned to declare national mourning
after the a ssassination.
In the event of an Iranian president's death, only the
prime minister or parliament has the power to proclaim
national mourning.
Reagan to decontrol oil today
Washington — President Ronald Reagan is likely to lift
the remaining controls on oil prices today, a White House
official said yesterday.
The action could raise gasoline prices as much as 12
cents a gallon while also adding $7 billion to the federal
treasury through increased tax revenues collected from
the oil companies.
The White House had planned to announce the action
yesterday, according to a White House source who asked
not to be identified, but held off at the last minute because
most of the day was devoted to the arrival of the hostages
freed from Iran.
About 25 percent of all domestic crude oil and all
gasoline and propane are under the price controls, im
posed nine years ago. Their removal began in June 1979 af
ter then-President Jimmy Carter announced a new pro
gram in April 1979 that would have lifted all controls by
Sept. 30, 1981.
The controls had been imposed by President Richard
Nixon as part of his wage-price control program and were
continued through several periods of oil shortages.
Congress gave the president power to lift the controls in
1975, but that authority was not exercised until Carter
acted to gradually eliminate the unwieldy controls while
tryinng to avoid spurring inflation.
Reagan campaigned on a pledge to speed up the removal
of the controls to help spur domestic production.
One industry analyst said he doubted consumers would
soon feel the impact of the Reagan action on gasoline
prices because competition and relatively low demand are
likely to delay some of the increases at least until spring.
However, other analysts said heating oil users may feel
the full impact of crude oil decontrol this winter.
Removal of price controls would mean that domestic
crude oil prices would be allowed to reach world market
levels. The Energy Department estimates that a barrel of
foreign oil sells for an average of $35, $12 greater than the
equivalent amount of domestic crude oil.
Senate confirms budget, CIA heads
Washington — The Senate yesterday confirmed David
Stockman to be the federal budget director and William
Casey, who managed President Ronald Reagan's 1980
campaign, to be CIA director.
Casey, 67, a New York native who held several posts
during the Nixon administration, was approved on a 95-0
vote. Stockman, a former Michigan congressman who is
urging heavy budget cuts, was cleared by a 93-0 vote.
Casey, a long-time friend of Reagan, takes over the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency at a time when its intelligence
gathering capability is being questioned, along with some
of its past practices.
Casey worked for the Office of Strategic Services, the
ClA's forerunner, during World War II and helped plan the
planting of agents in Germany and France During the
Nixon administration, he served as chairman of the Secur
ities and Exchange Commission, briefly as an under
secretary of state and then as president of the Export-Im
port Bank.
There was little debate in the Senate on either nomi
nation, although some Democrats criticized Stockman's
views as rigid and simplistic.
Stockman, 34, a persistent critic of government spend
ing and a two-term Republican congressman from Michi
gan, takes over as director of the Office of Management
and Budget — a job that many consider to be the second
most powerful in government.

Tremblor strikes near Hollister
San Francisco — An earthquake measuring slightly
above 4.0 on the Richter scale struck near Hollister at 2:11
p.m. PST yesterday and was widely felt in the San Jose
area, according to the United States Geological Survey.
No damage or injuries were immediately reported.
Geologists were unable immediately to pinpoint the
quake's epicenter except to say that it was near Hollister,
about 100 miles south of San Francisco
The Richter scale is a measure ground motion as re
corded on a seismograph. Quakes measuring 5.0 on the
Richter scale generally do slight damage, and major
earthquakes causing widespread destruction usually
measure at least 7.0.
Sierra resorts to operate fully
It took half the winter to arrive, but the first major win
ter storm finally blanketed the Sierra yesterday, with
warnings of treacherous driving conditions and high
avalanche dangers replacing the grumbling of gloomy
skiers and nervous ski resort owners.
With more than two feet of new snow in places, Sierra
ski resorts were planning to be in full operation this week
end for the first time this year. Resort workers were re
ceiving the calls yesterday they had been awaiting since
Thanksgiving — to come to work.
"It's a great storm," Brady Hodge, director of market
ing at Heavenly Valley said. "It's wet and heavy and when
it freezes, it'll provide a base that will last the season.''
Heavenly received more than one foot of snow with
more still falling yesterday. Boreal Ridge reported two
feet of new snow yesterday with 18 inches at Squaw Valley,
North Star and Sierra Ski Ranch. Squaw Valley, Alpine
Meadows, Ski Incline, Mount Rose, Sugar Bowl and Mam
moth Mountain all reported more than one foot.
Haig acts before Reagan installed
New York — Secretary of State Alexander Haig began
trying to ensure his department's primacy in foreign poli
cy even before Ronald Reagan had taken off his inaugural
suit, Reagan aides have told The New Yi>rk Times.
The newspaper reported yesterday that the president
still was in formal attire last Tuesday when Haig ap
proached him with a 20-page memorandum urging that in
tra-agency working committees be placed under the State
Department's leadership.
The Times said in a report from Washington that the
memo was tabled after some Reagan advisers reportedly
balked at making such decisions before they could be thor
oughly debated within the administration.
"I think the secretary was hoping it would all be signed
quickly and everything would be put in place." the Times
quoted a Reagan aide as saying of Haig's action.
"He didn't even give the president a chance to change
his clothes. But the president wanted to look it over."
Although the memo reportedly proposed important
roles for agencies besides the State Department, the hier
archy it suggested would have strengthened Haig's hand in
foreign policy and reduced some of the authority White
House advisers have acquired in recent administrations.
A Reagan aide told the Times that presidential counsel
or Edwin Meese 111, national security adviser Richard Al
len and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger told Haig
they saw no reason to rush a decision on the memo.
Oil decontrol lifts stocks
New York — Stock prices surged ahead yesterday, end
ing a six-day skid, as oil stocks rebounded on news that
President Ronald Reagan would issue his long-awaited or
der lifting oil price and allocation controls today.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.58 to
949.49 after losing more than 33 points in the previous six
sessions. Trading was active.
The market halted its recent slide as investors reacted
to statements by Reagan administration officials on the
president's economic plans, including word that Reagan
would make a televised economic address to the nation
next week.
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan said the adminis
tration could balance the federal budget within two years.
