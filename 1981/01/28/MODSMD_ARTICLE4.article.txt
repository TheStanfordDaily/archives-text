# Dean Royden resigns after eight years of quality
## 
### Brad Crystal 
Prof. Halsey Rovden, 52, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences for
the past eight years, will leave that
post to return to teaching and research
in mathematics.
English Prof. J. Martin Evans, as
sociate dean of the School, will also re
turn to teaching, Royden said, while
associate deans James Rosse, of the
economics dept. and Norman Wessels,
of the biology dept., are expected to
stay.
President Donald Kennedy noted
that Royden has one of the longest
terms of service of any dean since
World War 11. "In an absolutely
critical part of the University, he has
been responsible for some of the most
important innovations that have

enhanced our ability to attract
academic quality to Stanford," Ken
nedy said.
During Royden's administration,
Stanford continued its move into the
top echelon of several disciplines
within the school, inaugurated a new
Western Culture requirement for un
dergraduates, and strengthened the
evaluation and rewards for good
teaching.
Acting Provost A 1 Hastorf said
Royden "has done a superb job. He
stood for quality both in our faculty
and our academic programs. He
always was fair in his dealings. One
sign of his sense of quality is the first
class staff and associate deans that he
assembled."
Vice Provost Gerald Lieberman

said, "If one were asked for a one
word description of Halsey Royden's
tenure as dean it would be 'quality.'
He came into office during a
tumultuous time of budget austerity
and handled it so skilfully that the
school came out of this period
f.u angineneJ." While others have ex
pressed concern about higher educa
tion's ability to attract top young tal
ent to the professorial ranks, Royden
remains optimistic.
"In the sciences, at least, people
with a predilection for science do it, no
matter what," he said. "There's far
less attrition among top people who
will really be future stars than at the
level of those who are simply compe
tent or good. . . .
"Motivation and interest are the

keys for top people. And that's proba
bly true in the humanities as well as
the sciences."
Royden's optimism runs even
stronger for Stanford, which has many
"very promising" young faculty and a
tradition of growing its own "greats."
Kenneth Arrow, Nobel Laureate in
economics, and Gordon Wright,
former president of the American His
torical Association, are two examples
of former assistant professors at the
University who made it to the top of
their profession.
Royden received his bachelor's and
master's degress from Stanford in
1948 and 1949, earning his Ph D at
Harvard two years later. He returned
to Stanford as assistant professor in
1951 and was promoted to full pro
fessor seven years later.
He served as associate dean of the
School during 1962-65 and as acting
dean in 1968-69. The author of 44 pro
fessional journal articles, he served
on the Executive Committee of the
National Research Council's
Mathematical Science Division dur
ing 1971-75 and on the National Science
Foundation's Advisory Council on Re
search since 1975.
Royden is the University's highest
ranking academic administrator
whose experience started in the era
when Wallace Sterling was president
and Fred Terman provost.
As dean of Stanford's largest
school, responsible for about three
quarters of the total undergraduate
teaching load, Royden is thankful for
the support he received from his
academic deans, department heads
and faculty thoughout the School.
