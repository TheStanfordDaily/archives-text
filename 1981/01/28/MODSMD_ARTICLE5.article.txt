# Survey sees student cheating on decline

University students are less likely
to cheat now than they were were four
years ago, according to a recent honor
code survey. "In general, students see
little cheating and few are personally
aware of others cheating," said Sally
Cole, director of research for the dean
of student affairs and survey man
ager.
The survey asked students their ma
jor, sex and class, as well as a list of
specific questions as to whether they
cheat, have seen other people cheat,
or how they would respond if they saw
other people cheat. In almost every
category, the general level of student
honesty seems to have risen slightly
from that indicated in identical sur
veys conducted in 1976 and 1961.
Approximately three percent of stu
dents polled said they had given help
to others during an exam as compared
to eight and seven percent in 1976 and
1961. Only nine percent reported being
asked to give help as opposed to 22
percent in 1976.
The percentage of students who
would report a fellow student cheating
also increased. Nine percent of stu
dents polled said they would report an
observed honor code violation as com
pared to five percent in 1976. Almost 75
percent of students surveyed said they
would take some kind of active action
in response to observed violations.
Such action did not necessarily in
clude reporting the violation to a Uni
versity authority.
Many students, however, believe

there is "a lot of cheating," something
that Cole said is not supported by the
data. She cited varied reasons for this
misconception. Extensive news cov
erage of cheating on college campuses
across the country and a few instances
of flagrant University cheating con
tribute to this belief.
Students' belief in the equation, in
tense competition plus intense ambi
tion equals temptations to cheat
equals cheating, and student aware
ness that teaching methods do little to
discourage dishonesty may be causes
of this misconception, according to
Cole.
In addition to answering the survey,
hundreds of students volunteered
comments of their own. Approximate
ly 25 percent of the comments said
"I'm sure you're right to do this sur
vey, but I'm damned if I know what
you're worried about," added Cole.
This seemed to be especially true
among freshmen, who are less likely
to cheat themselves or have witnessed
less cheating, according to the report.
In their comments, many students
expressed concern as to what con
stitutes cheating. Many said they be
lieve professors should articulate the
conditions under which students can
help each other on homework or con
sult on mid-term exams. A typical
comment from the survey was "They
(the professors) should make it clear
(before something is assigned) wheth
er collaboration and aid are accep
table for the assignment."
One student complained of being ac
cused of cheating when he had no idea
that he was doing so. In addition,
many students complained of teaching
practices that tend to encourage
cheating, especially the use of a huge
overcrowded room for an exam. A
senior in industrial engineering com
mented, "I feel that an exam given in
overcrowded classrooms ... is an ov
erly tempting situation to place stu
dents in."
Students also complained of proc
uring professors although such
monitoring is not permitted by the
honor code.
Two identical surveys were mailed
out, one to a completely random group
of students and another to students en
rolled in honor code "trouble spots,"
classes in which code violations fre
quently occur. Although more stu
dents reported incidents of cheating in
these trouble areas, the percentage of
students reporting that they them
selves actually cheated was almost
identical to the percentage in the ran
dom sample. Students in these prob
lem areas were also more likely to en
dorse value judgements such as
"cheating is never justified," than
students in the random sample.
Many students emphasized that
people at the University really want to
be honest but that intense academic
pressure causes them to cheat. One
said " The academic pressure here at
Stanford is obviously intense ... I
don't know if it is possible to expunge
cheating from Stanford."
University freshmen were much
less likely to cheat than up
perclassmen, according to the survey.
This fact is probably partially due to
the fact that freshman have not been
exposed to as many testing situations,
noted the survey. Although per
centages of student cheating were
higher among sophomores, juniors
and seniors, than among freshmen
there is no steady rate of increase af
ter the first year. Students have de
cided whether or not they are going to
participate in some form of dishonesty
by their sophomore year, according to

the report.
The honor code survey was sent out
to 1000 randomly chosen students in
November, and 565 students replied.
The preliminary report is being re
leased today and discussion of the sur
vey. findings and related data is
scheduled for consideration at a Fac
ulty Senate meeting on Febuarv 5.
