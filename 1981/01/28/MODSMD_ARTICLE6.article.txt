From the Associated Press
Warsaw, Poland (AP) — Polituro member
Mieczyslaw Moczar called yesterday for a wide
spread purge of functionaries who wielded power
and influence under Edward Gierek. the party chief
ousted after last summer's crippling strikes. Mean
while, students and farmers warned their protests
would escalate.
"Obviously we could have avoided such great so
cial tremors. They had long been forecast by politi
cal seismographs. Those signals were ignored and
the accumulated conflicts led to a mighty quake,"
Moczar wrote in the party paper Try buna Ludu.
"I believe that in this great historic renewal of so
cial life there is and there can be no place for the en
emies of socialism, who prey on great social move
ments, seeing them to be the field for their destruc
tive activity.
"I also believe that the renewal of personnel must
continue. Not only those who out of thoughtlessness
or depraved by power showed destruction and dam
age around them must leave. Also those who do not
understand the new times and the new tasks must
change jobs."
Moczar. a former interior minister who sup
pressed worker riots in 1970 under then-party chief
Wladyslaw Gomulka, is a long-time political sur
vivor who was elevated to Politburo rank Dec. 2,
roughly three months after Stanislaw Kania re
placed Gierek, Gomulka's successor.
More than 2000 students held a sit-in Monday at
Lodz University, and a leader of the demonstration
said the polytechnic and film schools in Lodz would
join the protest today. The students sent a delega
tion to Warsaw to discuss their complaints with stu
dent leaders and government officials.
The sit-ins began last week in Lodz, a city of

840,000 people 75 miles southwest of Warsaw. The
students are demanding that compulsory classes in
Marxism be made optional, autonomy for some stu
dent groups from the Education Ministry, the bar
ring of police from campuses unless permitted by
university officials and access to printing facilities.
A student leader said delegations were sent to
Warsaw and Krakow, Poland's major student cen
ters, to seek support from their peers.
Private farmers continued to agitate for govern
ment approval of an agricultural counterpart to Sol
idarity, the big independent labor federation formed
after the nationwide strike wave last summer.
Some 300 farmers and peasants who have been oc
cupying a union building in Rzeszow, 160 miles south
of Warsaw, since Jan. 3 warned strikes would be
called unless a government delegation arrived today
to negotiate with them.
Their sit-in is in protest against the supreme
court's delay in approving the application by private
farmers, who account for much of Poland's agricul
tural production, to form an independent union.
Lech Walesa, the head of Solidarity, made an
emergency trip to Rzeszow from his headquarters in
the Baltic port of Gdansk to negotiate with angry
farmers there He asked the farmers in Rzeszow to
tone down their demands "because of the very tense
situation" there and elsewhere, a union spokesman
said.
If the stoppages are called, they probably will be
gin today, which has been designated a day of soli
darity with the farmers. In addition to demanding
recognition of their own union, the farmers are
pressing for better supplies of machinery, fertilizer
and other supplies

In a related protest, 15 farmers staged a hunger
strike in a Roman Catholic church at Swidnica. the
union said. The strikes prompted the first comment
in weeks from East Germany, one of the most vocif
erous critics of Solidarity. The East German news
agency ADN cited letters to the Polish Communist
Party daily Trybuna Ludu in its attack and said
they showed "the growing concern over the future of
Poland."
Millions of Poles stayed off the job Saturday to
press the campaign for a five-day week The com
munist regime, already saddled with a $24 billion
debt to the West, said Monday that the work boycott
cost nearly $150 million in lost production.
Polish state radio, while listing scattered strikes,
emphasized the normal operation of railways in a
report that appeared aimed at assuring the Soviet
Union that lines of supply and transport for its
Polish garrisons were secure.
Ongoing strikes, stemming from the summer la
bor rebellion over a steep increases in meat prices,
have raised fears of possible Soviet intervention.
Fresh reports of strikes appeared as yesterday
wore on.
The issues include demands for a 40-hour, five-day
workweek, revised laws on censorship and unions
and access to state-run media. Last week saw nu
merous protests over the government's refusal to
abandon the current 40-hour, six-day workweek.
The five-day week was one of the provisions of the
Gdansk agreement Aug 31 that ended last sum
mer's crippling wave of strikes. However, the gov
ernment said it could not meet the demand im
mediately, and introduced a second "free'' Satur
day monthly and offered to reduce the 40-hour work
week to 42.5 hours.

Some 300 farmers and peasants who have been oc
cupying a union building in Rzeszow, 160 miles south
of Warsaw, since Jan. 3 warned strikes would be
called unless a government delegation arrived today
to negotiate with them.
Their sit-in is in protest against the supreme
court's delay in approving the application by private
farmers, who account for much of Poland's agricul
tural production, to form an independent union.
Lech Walesa, the head of Solidarity, made an
emergency trip to Rzeszow from his headquarters in
the Baltic port of Gdansk to negotiate with angry
farmers there He asked the farmers in Rzeszow to
tone down their demands "because of the very tense
situation" there and elsewhere, a union spokesman
said.
If the stoppages are called, they probably will be
gin today, which has been designated a day of soli
darity with the farmers. In addition to demanding
recognition of their own union, the farmers are
pressing for better supplies of machinery, fertilizer
and other supplies

In a related protest, 15 farmers staged a hunger
strike in a Roman Catholic church at Swidnica. the
union said. The strikes prompted the first comment
in weeks from East Germany, one of the most vocif
erous critics of Solidarity. The East German news
agency ADN cited letters to the Polish Communist
Party daily Trybuna Ludu in its attack and said
they showed "the growing concern over the future of
Poland."
Millions of Poles stayed off the job Saturday to
press the campaign for a five-day week The com
munist regime, already saddled with a $24 billion
debt to the West, said Monday that the work boycott
cost nearly $150 million in lost production.
Polish state radio, while listing scattered strikes,
emphasized the normal operation of railways in a
report that appeared aimed at assuring the Soviet
Union that lines of supply and transport for its
Polish garrisons were secure.
Ongoing strikes, stemming from the summer la
bor rebellion over a steep increases in meat prices,
have raised fears of possible Soviet intervention.
Fresh reports of strikes appeared as yesterday
wore on.
The issues include demands for a 40-hour, five-day
workweek, revised laws on censorship and unions
and access to state-run media. Last week saw nu
merous protests over the government's refusal to
abandon the current 40-hour, six-day workweek.
The five-day week was one of the provisions of the
Gdansk agreement Aug 31 that ended last sum
mer's crippling wave of strikes. However, the gov
ernment said it could not meet the demand im
mediately, and introduced a second "free'' Satur
day monthly and offered to reduce the 40-hour work
week to 42.5 hours.

Warsaw, Poland (AP) — Polituro member
Mieczyslaw Moczar called yesterday for a wide
spread purge of functionaries who wielded power
and influence under Edward Gierek. the party chief
ousted after last summer's crippling strikes. Mean
while, students and farmers warned their protests
would escalate.
"Obviously we could have avoided such great so
cial tremors. They had long been forecast by politi
cal seismographs. Those signals were ignored and
the accumulated conflicts led to a mighty quake,"
Moczar wrote in the party paper Try buna Ludu.
"I believe that in this great historic renewal of so
cial life there is and there can be no place for the en
emies of socialism, who prey on great social move
ments, seeing them to be the field for their destruc
tive activity.
"I also believe that the renewal of personnel must
continue. Not only those who out of thoughtlessness
or depraved by power showed destruction and dam
age around them must leave. Also those who do not
understand the new times and the new tasks must
change jobs."
Moczar. a former interior minister who sup
pressed worker riots in 1970 under then-party chief
Wladyslaw Gomulka, is a long-time political sur
vivor who was elevated to Politburo rank Dec. 2,
roughly three months after Stanislaw Kania re
placed Gierek, Gomulka's successor.
More than 2000 students held a sit-in Monday at
Lodz University, and a leader of the demonstration
said the polytechnic and film schools in Lodz would
join the protest today. The students sent a delega
tion to Warsaw to discuss their complaints with stu
dent leaders and government officials.
The sit-ins began last week in Lodz, a city of

840,000 people 75 miles southwest of Warsaw. The
students are demanding that compulsory classes in
Marxism be made optional, autonomy for some stu
dent groups from the Education Ministry, the bar
ring of police from campuses unless permitted by
university officials and access to printing facilities.
A student leader said delegations were sent to
Warsaw and Krakow, Poland's major student cen
ters, to seek support from their peers.
Private farmers continued to agitate for govern
ment approval of an agricultural counterpart to Sol
idarity, the big independent labor federation formed
after the nationwide strike wave last summer.
