## Environmentalists win big victory Trinity River to be rehabilitated 
### Jennifer Seymour 
Environmentalists won a ma
jor victory last week when then-
Secretary of the Interior Cecil
Andrus announced a permanent
increase in the Trinity River
water flow to the area below the
Lewiston Dam.
Andrus' declaration called
for an immediate increase in an
nual flow from 120,000 acre-feet
per year to 287.000 acre-feet per
year, to be gradually increased
to 340,000 acre-feet per year.
Experts who encouraged this
decision saw it, in conjunction
with an intensive stream and
watershed rehabilitation pro
gram, as the only way to pre
vent chinook salmon and steel
head trout from becoming ex
tinct in the Trinity River sys
tem.
• The Trinity had traditionally
been a major freeway for
Salmon and steelhead runs. Ac
cording to latest environmental
studies, this system was the
homeing-road for one-third to
one-half of the total number of
salmon that are born in the
Klamath River Basin.
Tradition also held that the
Hupa and Yurok Indians took
fish they rely on for subsistence.

rituals, and commercial en
deavors from the abundant
salmon and steelhead resources
of the Trinity River.
But in 1964, a Federal water
project instigated by Interior's
Water and Power Resources
Service, cut back the area
where fish could make their
runs. Over 100 miles of fishery
habitat was blocked.
The water was directed to
agrarian and industrial needs by
a series of dams, storage re
servoirs, and hydro-electric
power facilities, explained John
Sayre. Fish and Wildlife service
official. These channeled more
than one million acre-feet per
year to California's Central Val
ley for irrigation and power
plant operation.
Since this cutback, Chinook
runs have declined bv 80
percent, steelhead, by 60
percent. Remaining fishery
habitats have also suffered
losses of 80 to 90 percent. Fish
and Wildlife service surveys re
vealed.
"The reduced flow meant wa
ter temperatures went up In
the summer when it gets hot
down there, it's just too much
for the fish. They were dying of
the heat," said Savre.

Fishery losses were also
caused by inefficient water flow
and resulting stream sediment
build-up: Logging, road con
struction and heavy fish
harvesting continued at an in
creasing rate, even after the
cutback, which caused Trinity
water-ways to clog up.
This reduced flow kept fish
from migrating and spawning,
so that the highly sedimented
waters meant fewer new-born
as well as a harmful environ
ment for existing trout and
salmon.
Fewer fish meant less fishing
as well, ultimately necessi
tating the regulation of fishing
on the Hupa Valley Indian Res
ervation in 1977. By 1980 the De
partment of the Interior had
placed a complete moratorium
on commercial fishing to main
tain escaping of enough chinook
spawners in the fall.
Environmentalists did not
idly watch this gradual extinc
tion, however. According to
Sayre, a reclamation bureau
was established immediately
and an environmental impact
study was begun.
On December 5, 1980 the In
terior's Fish and Wildlife ser

vice presented their final en
vironmental impact statement.
Andrus' decision to increase wa
ter flows was based on this re
port.
Andrus stated that the flow
will be increased gradually
towards a permanent level of
287,000 acre-feet per year now,
stipulating that during dry
years the flow could be reduced
to 220.000 acre-feet and during
critically dry years, down to
140,000 acre-feet.
Andrus also supported the
continuing work of a 13-member
task force which is working
towards fish and wildlife re
habilitation.
This involves restoring and
opening up blocked waterways
and natural spawning grounds
for this fish, as well as working
to rebuild depleted populations,
according to Sayre.
"It will take a lot of time, but
I think we'll be able to do it,"
commented Sayre.
"And it will mean more fish
ing for the Indians as well as a
decent salmon and steelhead
population."

rituals, and commercial en
deavors from the abundant
salmon and steelhead resources
of the Trinity River.
But in 1964, a Federal water
project instigated by Interior's
Water and Power Resources
Service, cut back the area
where fish could make their
runs. Over 100 miles of fishery
habitat was blocked.
The water was directed to
agrarian and industrial needs by
a series of dams, storage re
servoirs, and hydro-electric
power facilities, explained John
Sayre. Fish and Wildlife service
official. These channeled more
than one million acre-feet per
year to California's Central Val
ley for irrigation and power
plant operation.
Since this cutback, Chinook
runs have declined bv 80
percent, steelhead, by 60
percent. Remaining fishery
habitats have also suffered
losses of 80 to 90 percent. Fish
and Wildlife service surveys re
vealed.
"The reduced flow meant wa
ter temperatures went up In
the summer when it gets hot
down there, it's just too much
for the fish. They were dying of
the heat," said Savre.

Fishery losses were also
caused by inefficient water flow
and resulting stream sediment
build-up: Logging, road con
struction and heavy fish
harvesting continued at an in
creasing rate, even after the
cutback, which caused Trinity
water-ways to clog up.
This reduced flow kept fish
from migrating and spawning,
so that the highly sedimented
waters meant fewer new-born
as well as a harmful environ
ment for existing trout and
salmon.
Fewer fish meant less fishing
as well, ultimately necessi
tating the regulation of fishing
on the Hupa Valley Indian Res
ervation in 1977. By 1980 the De
partment of the Interior had
placed a complete moratorium
on commercial fishing to main
tain escaping of enough chinook
spawners in the fall.
Environmentalists did not
idly watch this gradual extinc
tion, however. According to
Sayre, a reclamation bureau
was established immediately
and an environmental impact
study was begun.
On December 5, 1980 the In
terior's Fish and Wildlife ser

vice presented their final en
vironmental impact statement.
Andrus' decision to increase wa
ter flows was based on this re
port.
Andrus stated that the flow
will be increased gradually
towards a permanent level of
287,000 acre-feet per year now,
stipulating that during dry
years the flow could be reduced
to 220.000 acre-feet and during
critically dry years, down to
140,000 acre-feet.
Andrus also supported the
continuing work of a 13-member
task force which is working
towards fish and wildlife re
habilitation.
This involves restoring and
opening up blocked waterways
and natural spawning grounds
for this fish, as well as working
to rebuild depleted populations,
according to Sayre.
"It will take a lot of time, but
I think we'll be able to do it,"
commented Sayre.
"And it will mean more fish
ing for the Indians as well as a
decent salmon and steelhead
population."
Environmentalists won a ma
jor victory last week when then-
Secretary of the Interior Cecil
Andrus announced a permanent
increase in the Trinity River
water flow to the area below the
Lewiston Dam.
Andrus' declaration called
for an immediate increase in an
nual flow from 120,000 acre-feet
per year to 287.000 acre-feet per
year, to be gradually increased
to 340,000 acre-feet per year.
Experts who encouraged this
decision saw it, in conjunction
with an intensive stream and
watershed rehabilitation pro
gram, as the only way to pre
vent chinook salmon and steel
head trout from becoming ex
tinct in the Trinity River sys
tem.
• The Trinity had traditionally
been a major freeway for
Salmon and steelhead runs. Ac
cording to latest environmental
studies, this system was the
