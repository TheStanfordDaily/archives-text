# Jet lag a possible health hazard
## 
### Bill Beyda 
To most of us jet lag is simply
a nuisance. When a pilot ex
periences jet lag, however, it
could be a health hazard, cur
rent studies suggest.
"Multiple legs" flying, where
a pilot flies several times in a
few days, including stopovers in
strange cities, sleeping in
strange hotels, eating strange
foods, and at hours different
from a pilot's own bodily clock,
prompted the research.
How pilots perform under
stress in multiple legs flying is
one of the main questions a
study now underway at NASA's
Ames Research Center is trying
to answer. The research is being
carried out under the direction
of Dr. Joseph Sharp, deputy di
rector of Life Sciences, Dr. Alan
Chambers, chief of the Man-Ve
hicle Sysytems Research
Division, and Dr. Charles
Winget of the Biomedical Re
search Division.
Prior studies have shown the
interruption of biological cycles
causes reduced performance,
fatigue, loss of attentiveness,
short-term memory lapses and
decreased alertness.
The research grew out of the
persistence of one commercial
airline pilot. Bill Price, who was
directed to NASA by Dr. Wil
liam Dement, Dr. Laughton
Miles, and Gary Richardson of
Stanford's sleep clinic, without
whom, according to Price, none
of the recent advances would
have been possible. "For years,
pilots have been complaining

about their schedules. Scientists
have proven the negative ef
fects of time zone changes and
fatigue. The FAA only recently
acknowledged the problem, but
its updated regulations don't
solve it, and several noted scien
tists have shown them to be in
adequate," said Price.

7 don't want to jeopardize my life and the
lives of those I'm flying because my airline is
putting me into unhealthy situations. The
airline industry wants to cover up the whole
thing, because they're just concerned with
their profits. Whenever it's most profitable
for them to fly* you'll fly.'

"I don't want to jeopardize
my life and the lives of those I'm
flying because my airline is put
ting me into unhealthy situ
ations. The airline industry
wants to cover up the whole
thing, because they're just con
cerned with their profits. When
ever it's most profitable for
them to fly, you'll fly," Price
continued.
"A recent study has shown
the condition of the cardio
vascular system of pilots to be
on the average, 8 years older
than normal.
"Our health is obviously
being affected Hopefully this
study will prove what pilots
have been saying for years, and

will find remedies to the situ
ation."
The first part of the study is to
translate existing scientific lit
erature on circadian rythms, or
the body's cycles, into layman's
terms and distribute it to mem
bers of the airline community.
The second part will be a field

study to determine the rest,
sleep, dietary, and drug use pat
terns of commercial airline
crews.
"Very little has been done in
this area in the way of field stud
ies," said Winget. "We hope to
be able to set a biological clock
as easily as you set your
watch."
The third part of the study
will use current simulation fa
cilities to study the results of al
tered life patterns, and the
fourth part of the study includes
the construction of a new sim
ulation facility specifically for
this research.

NASA is presently operating
the Aviation Safety Reporting
System which is, according to
Sharp, a computer network on
which "the entire aviation com
munity can report incidents to
us. We have a lot of data, but not
very many incidents were re
ported as being caused by
fatigue or jet lag." Simulation,
it seems, is the only way the re
searchers will get enough data
to work with.
"Studying pilot errors is like
studying volcanoes," said
Sharp. "They don't happen very
often. By bringing the flight
crews into the simulator, alter
ing their sleeping and eating
patterns, we can see how they
deal with problems when
they're rested as opposed to
when they're tired, and when
their body clocks are out of
synch as opposed to when
they're in synch."
The new simulator will not be
completed until 1983, but results
from the other parts of the re
search will be available sooner.
The Federal Aviation Admin
istration admitted there is a pi
lot fatigue problem but they
could not agree on its magni
tude. The researchers hope to
determine to what degree
schedules effect the per
formance of the flight crews,
and ways to counteract these ef
fects and to discover tolerance
limits, beyond which per
formance become hazardous.
