# Lockheed creates solar shuttle

Current innovations seem
to have focused a long-con
sidered idea into the tan
gible: Lockheed Missiles and
Space Company in Menlo
Park announced last week it
is now making solar panels
for space shuttles.
Collapsible wings,
blanketed with solar cells,
are being designed to provide
self-generated electric
power for launching shuttles
and other space operations.
Space power source de
signs currently use fuel cells
that contain hydrogen. These
fuel tanks are heavy, though,
and must be constantly re
filled. In fact, fuel require
ments currently limit shuttle
orbit time to seven days.
But according to Lockheed
officials, this experimental
solar wing will provide light
er, cheaper and longer-last
ing power. The potential fuel
economy of ion propulsion is
10 times better than conven
tional hydrogen-fuel pro
pulsion systems designs.
Moreover, the electric
power from the solar array
wing can probably be used
for additional power at the
shuttle's mission destina
tion. Since future space shut
tles will need electricity for
ion engines to power earth
orbital and planetary mis
sions, this innovation could
prove invaluable.
The solar array wing, 105
feet long and 13-and-one-half
feet wide, is being con
structed at Lockheed for ex

periments with plastic kap
ton solar collector cells. The
lightweight, flexible, wrap
around cells are welded
directly to the panel to avoid
the extra weight of
adhesives.
When collapsed like an ac
cordian, the wing can be in
serted into a thin, metal tube
for stowage during the trip to
orbit. The first space testing
will include a series of ex
pansions and retractions, to
make sure the wings will
open and close dependably.
Lockheed's new wings are
also more powerful than
hydrogen fuel cells: They
can generate 66 watts per kil
ogram. compared with 20
watts per kilogram in pres
ent systems. And with higher
efficiency cells, up to 75
watts per kilogram are
feasible.
For experimental
purposes, these arrays will
hold only two active elec
trical modules. But when
wings are fully populated
with solar cells, the 84 mod
ules will be able to convert
solar energy into 12-and-one
half kilowatts of power.
The Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala
bama, commissioned
Lockheed to develop the so
lar array wings as well ..s
other concepts for the Solar
Electric Propulsion Stage
(SEPS) vehicle.
Lockheed is also develop
ing solar arrays for space
shuttle stations. These sys
tems will deliver twice the
power, 25 kilowatts, to pro

vide electricity, thermal
cooling and attitude stabili
zation for docking space
shuttles.
According to present flight
plans, solar shuttles will re
turn to earth when their mis
sions are complete while the
power station will remain in
orbit as an independent, free
flying craft awaiting the next
shuttle mission.
Lockheed is working on so
lar array concepts that will
combine panels to produce
300 kilowatts to one mega
watt of power.
According to Larry
Chidester, manager of Elec
trical Power Systems at
Lockheed, the main con
siderations in solar array de
velopment are reducing
weight and increasing per
formance.
"However, when we start
developing 25-100 kilowatt
arrays and above, cost be
comes a very important fac
tor too," he said.
Silicon cells cost $100-200
per watt. But if reflectors
are used to concentrate sun
light on solar cells, the
dollar-per-watt figure can be
reduced to $10-20. Chidester
said he expects designers
will achieve this efficiency
by 1990.
Another semi-conductor
material, gallium arsenide,
makes excellent
photovoltaic devices for use
with concentrators.
Lockheed is funding inde
pendent studies to in
vestigate its use on future ar
rays.
