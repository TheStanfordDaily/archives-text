Voicing concerns over anti
environmental policy and in
creasingly adverse affects of
current energy use. environ
mentalists speaking at Kresge
Auditorium last night urged the
audience to "rise up" in defense
of environmental protection.
The future political situation
for conservationists is
"absolutely dismal." Sierra
Club Executive President Mike
McCloskey told the audience of
150 people He urged the public
to demand environmental plan
ning from the new Reagan ad
ministration
"Reagan's election (was not
a mandate for a) rollback in en
vironmental planning," Mc-
Closkey said The polls show
two-thirds of the public ad
vocates environmental meas
ures, he said.
Newly appointed Secretary of
the Interior James Watt drew
the most criticism from Mc-
Closkey. who outlined a history
of anti-environmental actions
taken by the official. According
to McCloskey. these actions in
cluded efforts to block meas
ures which would control over
grazing of public lands, would
call for smog reduction through
vehicle inspection, and would
provide for wilderness protec
tion and river clean up.
Although the secretary of the
interior possesses the most au
thority concerning the lease of
public land for energy re
sources, "One looks in vain for a
sense of stewardship (in Watt)
to protect the environment for
the future." he said In addition,
McCloskey said that Watt's
former legal clients include oil
companies whose wishes may
be difficult for him to turn
down
Stanford Senior Research As
sociate Anne Ehrlich continued
the attack on the new adminis
tration. saying "the days of
abundant energy are over Rea

gan and Watt want them back
but the price is too high."
Ehrlich, the author of two
books on environmental con
cerns. stressed that the world's
dependence on energy can and
will decline in the future
Ehrlich cited statistics which
revealed that U.S. use of world
energy resources has dropped
four percent from a peak of 30
percent in 1978.
One of the by-products of ex
cessive energy use, Ehrlich
said, is acid rain caused by
fumes in the atmosphere. Acid
rain is killing plant and animal
life and could damage
thousands of lakes in Canada
and the Northeastern United
States. Ehrlich said.
The continued build up of
carbon dioxide in the at
mosphere, a "potentially in
tractable global problem" and
if left unchecked it may cause
adverse climate changes includ
ing droughts in areas of the
world where people already suf-

fer from famine, according to
Ehrlich.
Nuclear power presents the
most disturbing potential for en
vironmental destruction be
cause there is a potential for ra
diation leakage,plant sabotage,
or nuclear proliferation.
"There is no lack of options,"
Erlich said. "The 1980s, like it
or not, will be a decade of ex
plorations and experimentation
with different (energy) technol
ogies."
Warning that humans can no
longer take survival for
granted. Stanford law student
Mike Shuman called upon the
world's 140 non-nuclear nations
to force the nuclear disarma
ment of the U.S. and the Soviet
Union through adherence to a
rigid plan of weapon destruc
tion. If the two superpowers de
clined the mandate, then the na
tions could threaten to take up
nuclear arms, a move now pro
hibited by the non-proliferation
treaty, Shuman said.
