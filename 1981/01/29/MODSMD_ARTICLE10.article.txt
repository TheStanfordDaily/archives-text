# Academia and athletics — Geiger's formula
## 
### Doug Jehl 
The advocate of athletics at
Stanford, as Athletic Director
Andy Geiger describes himself,
is in a unique position. He must
relate to University adminis
trators, who are primarily con
cerned with academic con
cerns, and he must deal with
alumni and persuade them to
contribute money to the depart
ment. At the same time, he
must unify coaches and others
in the Athletic Dept. and make
them feel that athletics are im
mensely important here.
Geiger succeeds in doing this,
say his associates, because he is
deeply committed to the idea of
merging athletics and
academics in the University. As
Associate Director for Public
Affairs Gary Cavalli said,
"Andy's not just lending lip ser
vice to that philosophy — he re
ally believes that the merging of
academics and athletics can
lead to success."
Women's track and field
coach Laurel Treon said Geiger
feels that academics are a boost
to athletic success, not a deter
rent, and that he is really
pleased that this is an
academically elite institution.
She said that this feeling is per
vasive among all the coaches:
"Andy Geiger sets the tempo,
mood, and philosophy for the en
tire department."
In doing this, according to his

associates, Geiger's personality
remains warm and charming.
Cavalli called him a complex in
dividual, saying that although
he appears to be a low-keyed
person, he is also intense and
strong. He added that Geiger
has raised the level of expecta
tion within the department be
cause he's a demanding boss
who is even more demanding of
himself.
Geiger is an informal man.
When he speaks with visitors to
his comfortable Athletic Dept.
office, he sits not in a leather
armchair behind an imposing
desk, as one might expect the
athletic director of one of the
nation's top 20 athletic powers
to do, but in the same kind of
casual chair his visitor sits in, a
few feet away across an open
conversation area. When the
phone buzzes, he interrupts
himself to answer it. But even
after an intense five-minute
call, he returns to the conversa
tion exactly where he left it.
Geiger seems remarkably
aware without being high
strung.
Varsity coaches speak favor
ably of this awareness. One
men's varsity coach said that
while many athletic directors
seem somewhat lost, Geiger
doesn't need to be told what's
going on because he always
knows. He said that Geiger has
an ability to grasp on his own ex
actly what needs to be done.

"When Andy first came here
(Geiger's appointment became
effective in January 1979), there
were very, very few full schol
arships for some sports. Andy
saw right away that to compete
at the Pac-10 level, that had to
be changed, so he went right
ahead and did it."
Geiger's arrival at Stanford
from the University of Pennsyl
vania, where he was also the
athletic director, brought about
some changes in the depart
ment. Unlike other A.D.'s, one
coach said, Geiger does many
things that keep the department
together. He has confidence in
his coach's judgement, so that
when they say that they need
something, Geiger gets it for
them, without hassling them
about it. "I've worked for some
athletic directors who'll argue
with you about buying a new
jockstrap," the coach said.
Geiger also created the De
partment of Public Affairs, "an
important and necessary step
toward increased promotion,"
the coach said.
He also shows interest in the
so-called minor sports, Treon
commented. "There is a one-on
one concern that makes every
one feel important," she added.
"Instead of negative feelings
toward the minor sports, there
is a positive feeling throughout
the department."
Another coach said that
"Geiger treats you like a pro

fessional instead of a little kid."
Geiger also does little things,
the coach said, that seem unim
portant but really bring the de
partment together. "He'll take
a recruit out to lunch, invite the
coaches to a get-together at his
house, and show up at games
and get involved with the
teams."
But since Geiger came to
Stanford, he has also spent a lot
of money, which has brought
him the greatest share of his
criticism. The Athletic Dept.
suffered a $1 million deficit in
fiscal 1979, Geiger's first budg
etary year. Some of the ex
penses were considered neces
sary by some coaches, especial
ly the increased number of ath
letic scholarships and coaching
salary increases.
Before Geiger came to Stan
ford, coaches were "notoriously
low paid. We've gone from the
lowest in the Pac-10 to the
highest since Andy's been
here," said a varsity coach. He
added that Geiger needed to do
this if he expected to attract
quality coaches.
But the same coach said that
he felt that other expenditures,
such as cosmetic improvements
to and around the Athletic Dept.
building, were not needed right
away. He said Geiger may have
felt that the improvements
needed to be made and acted ac
cordingly, but that he felt the
department shouldn't have gone

into "the hole" so much, and
that Geiger was simply so coop
erative that he spent too much
money. He added that money
has tightened down a bit this
year, and that coaches are en
couraged to save money by
doing things like taking plane
trips at inconvenient but
cheaper times.
To bring in more money, the
Athletic Dept. under Geiger has
recently launched "The
Challenge," a five-year fund
raising program with a goal of
$21 million. The project is
aimed toward alumni, a group
Geiger must deal with often in
his position. He said that he
speaks with alumni groups like
the Cardinal and the Buck Clubs
often, and that he meets three
times a year with the Stanford
Athletic Board, a group from
across the nation representing
alumni concerns about Stanford
athletics.
Geiger said that like all de
partment heads, he is from
"time to time" trying to raise
money. Geiger serves on Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's staff
which meets once a week. He
said that he. like other members
of the committee, meets with
Kennedy about twice monthly.
"I always feel warmly re
ceived and welcome around the
administration," he said. He
added that there is no resent
ment or bad feeling from those
whose concern is academics
rather than athletics, and that
he feels he has a good rela
tionship with the adminis
tration.
Geiger reaffirmed his as
sociates' comments about his
academic versus athletic
priorities at Stanford. He said
that coaches tell recruits that
academics comes first, and that
everyone in the department is
told the same thing during their
interview process.
"When I was first being in
terviewed, the idea that
academics should come first
was made very clear to me.
Everyone comes in knowing
that this comes with the turf.
Even when we had to turn down
the Holiday Bowl bid because of
the academic considerations
(the game was played on the
Friday of finals week), there
was only minor frustration. The

priorities are never ques
tioned."
Before the Big Game, Geiger
spoke to the football team, but
he says it was merely to inform
them of the options they had
should they win and be offered
the Peach Bowl bid. "I'm not a
big speechmaker," he said. "I
know a lot of the athletes per
sonally and I see them on cam
pus a lot, but when I talk to them
it's to encourage them, not to in
spire them. Too much is made of
rah-rah people."
Some athletes said that they
have very little contact with
Geiger. "When I was being re
cruited," one freshman football
player said, "we walked into the
room and it was like, 'Hey,
here's Andy Geiger, our athletic
director.' He spoke to us before
the season and told us how im
portant football was to the ath
letic program here, and then
again before Big Game, but that

was about it. We usually worked
with Doug Single."
Single left Stanford recently
to become Athletic Director at
Northwestern. Geiger said that
Single's job was really two jobs
in one, and will now be split. A
new Associate Director of De
velopment will be hired to deal
with financial matters, and
Geiger himself will take over
Single's day-to-day duties of re
lating to the various sports.
Geiger said that he looks for
ward to this because he likes to
be involved with the coaches
and athletes.
As to the relative importance
of football, Geiger said that
there is a great deal to be said
for the idea that football and
basketball should come first,
because their gate receipts ben
efit the entire program.
Coaches of other sports are,
Geiger said, "remarkably able
to understand this. They're all
aggressive people, but they're
cognizant of realities."
Geiger said that he sees Stan
ford as a national power be
cause of the reputation of the
University. "Stanford is a re
spected name," he said, "both
for academics and athletics.
Other private schools, like
Northwestern and Duke, sec us
as a model.
"Northwestern's hiring of 29-
year-old Doug Single, besides
being a compliment to his great
talent, also shows how much
Northwestern respects our sys
tem here at Stanford."
According to a ranking pub
lished by a Knoxville, Tennes
see newspaper, Stanford men's
athletics were No. 14 in the na
tion last year. However, the sys
tem used did not consider water
polo, perhaps Stanford's best
men's team. Women were
ranked No. 9 by the newspaper.
Consistently, said Gary Cavalli,
Stanford athletics have ranked
in the top 20, and at one time was
as high as No. 2.
Geiger, a varsity coach said,
will always look toward improv
ing the program and making
Stanford even more of a, na
tional athletic power. "Andy
has the foresight to do now what
needs to be done for the future.
He's always looking ahead, and
he's never content with main
taining the status quo."
