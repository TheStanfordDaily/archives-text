# University defines sexual harassment
## 
### Karen Springen 
What is the borderline be
tween natural flirting and sex
ual harassment? The University
has adopted an official policy on
sexual harassment which ex
plicitly addresses the issue.
The policy refines and spells
out informal procedures
adopted in May 1978. According
to Associate Provost and Regis
trar Sally Mahoney, "the virtue
of the announced policy is that it
clarifies for all parties the na
ture of sexual harassment."
Required as part of the feder
al equal opportunity em
ployment policy for universities
announced last year, the policy
describes sexual harassment as
"repeated and unwanted sexual
behavior, such as physical con
tact and verbal comments or
suggestions, which adversely
affects the working or learning
environment.
"Coercive behavior, includ
ing suggestions that academic
or employment reprisals or re
wards will follow the refusal or
granting of sexual favors, con
stitutes gross misconduct and
will not be tolerated. In such
cases, a single incident would
establish grounds for action."

homosexual cases of sexual
harassment. "You have the va
riety of the woman student and
the woman supervisor. You
even have the professor who
complains of a female student
coming on very strongly," she
said.
The precise definition of sex
ual harassment, which the new
policy addresses, often becomes
quite important. Kaplan cited
the case of a female graduate
student ten years ago who ac
cused her professor of sexual
harassment.
"He (the accused professor)
raised the question that this per
son was not a minor," she said.
He disputed the charge. "She's
over 21. What's the problem?"
he asked.
Another instance involved a
female student who complained
to Kaplan about a faculty mem
ber bothering several freshmen
women. The student was afraid
to identify the male, however,
because she feared he would be
vindictive. Although the male
was known, no action was taken.
Kaplan called this case an ex
ample of "how powerful the ex
ploitation of power is."
According to Kaplan, no one

'It's not the purpose of the policy
to keep people from falling in
love.'

According to Iris Brest of the
University legal office, the in
formal process provides an im
portant alternative to the for
mal procedures. "When both
are available, it's the option of
the person with the complaint,"
said Brest, who was on the
working committee that for
mulated the policy.
Brest does not expect that the
publication of the new policy
will result in an upsurge in com
plaints, however. "I don't have
any sense that at Stanford
there's been inhibition (in re
porting sexual harassment) up
to this point," she said. "(But)
we wanted it to be on the re
cord."
Brest also stressed that the
policy is a "first try."
According to Mahoney, who
was also on the committee, the
policy should reduce the in
cidence of sexual harassment
by clarifying the nature of unac
ceptable behavior.
Another committee member,
University ombudsman John
Goheen, called the policy, which
has been informally discussed
for two years, "an explicit
statement." He said the com
mittee wanted it "much sooner
than it was issued. "
The working committee in
cluded Leah Kaplan, who played
a key role in developing the 1978
guidelines as assistant dean of
students, Sarah Stevenson and
Goheen of the ombudsman's of
fice, Brest of the legal office,
Santiago Rodriguez, university
affirmative action officer. Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons,
Mahoney and Marlene Wine,
special assistant to President
Donald Kennedy.
According to Kaplan, the of
ficial policy is particularly im
portant in providing "the ele
ment of choice." It reinforces
the legal aspects of sexual
harassment charges, address
ing such issues as employee-em
ployer rights.
"It's to your protection to
know what your rights are," she
said.
She emphasized the wide
range of both heterosexual and

knew where to channel the vari
ous cases. "But just writing
something down puts some on
guard," she said. An official
statement clarifies penalties,
she added.
Stanford appears to be one of
the few universities to have al
ready issued such a statement.
According to Wine, "we aren't
aware of another university that
has such a policy."
The office of the ombudsman
gets several inquiries a week
from other universities. Ac
cording to Goheen, "there are
places that are just catching on
to the fact that they need one."
Stumbling blocks included
finding a satisfactory for
mulation for the informal pro
cedures while trying to remain
"low-key", said Goheen.
In addition, the consensual,
collegial style of the University
slowed down proceedings. Ac
cording to Rodriguez, "you've
got to touch base with all these
people." A "blanket policy"
was impossible because the pol
icy deals with all the different
constituencies on campus, he
said.
Formal grievance pro
cedures include Nonacademic
Staff Grievance Procedures,
Collective Bargaining Agree
ment for unit members,
Academic Staff Grievance Pro
cedures, Faculty Grievance
Procedures, Student Academic
Grievance Procedures, Student
Employee Grievances and Stu
dent Nonacademic Grievance
Procedures. Informal pro
cedures do not extend the nor
mal time limit for making for
mal complaint.
Concern with privacy was a
key issue. "We didn't want peo
ple unfairly accused," said
Rodriguez. In order to respect
the accused's rights, since the
policy conceivably could be
used vindictively, the complai
nant must consent to be identi
fied to the one accused in con
nection with the investigation.
Mahoney also cited the im
portance of obtaining identity
information. "Fundamentally
one needs to be sensitive to all
parties," she said.
Under the informal pro
cedure, allegations of sexual
harassment may be brought to
the office of the ombudsman.
The policy states, "On the re
quest of the person making the
complaint, the Ombudsman will
consult with the designate of the
provost (in the case of a mem
ber of the faculty or academic
staff charged with sexual

harassment) or the Officeot the
Dean of Student Affairs (when
the person accused is a stu
dent). Students may also con
sult with advisors, resident as
sistants or a counselor at Cow
ell.
Supervisors have the author
ity to initiate disciplinary pro
cedures when appropriate.
"We want to keep the process
as informal as possible," said
Rodriguez. "People are reluc
tant to discuss it (sexual harass

ment)."
Rodriguez stressed the need
for public awareness of the is
sue. "Many people see sexual
discrimination generally as a
joke still. They think that it
doesn't exist," he said.
But, he added, "you don't
want to inhibit natural behav
ior."
Goheen also emphasized,
"It's not the purpose of the poli
cy to keep people from falling in
love."
