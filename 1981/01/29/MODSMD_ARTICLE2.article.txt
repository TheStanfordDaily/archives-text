# Kennedy discusses higher tuition fees with ASSU Senate
## 
### Kimberly Brown 
Speaking to the ASSU Senate
last night. President Donald
Kennedy said that Stanford's
future during the next decade
will evolve from the economic
realities facing it today. Ken
nedy discussed the economic
problems surrounding tuition
and student support but con
cluded on a positive note saying
the 1980s will hold opportunities
for solving them.
The University recently de
cided to raise tuition rates 13.6
percent and with double-digit in
flation, Kennedy said he expects
another high tuition increase
next year.
"We've wrung every ounce of
water out of this year's budget,
and we still don't have it in bal
ance, " hesaid With thecurrent
state of the economy, the Uni
versity must raise tuition to
break even, Kennedy added.
Kennedy predicted that Stan
ford's tuition increases will be
minimal in comparison with
those of other major private uni
versities. He said he'll be "sur
prised"- if any schools announce
lower rates — since some have
already set increases of 15
percent and it's possible others
may go as high as 20 percent.
"There's a certain in
evitability about it. and the
forces are fundamental," Ken
nedy said.
Kennedy discussed student fi
nancial support as a second
problem that has economic ori
gins. The recent trend has been
the government's retreat from
supporting higher education in
general, he said. As a result, the
levels of undergraduate and
graduate aid is affected, he
added.
ASSU Senator Jeff Bradach
expressed concern over those
students who don't even bother
to apply because the cost of at
tending is so high. He asked
Kennedy whether the Univer
sity is reaching out to potential
applicants and letting them
know about the aid possibilities.
Kennedy replied, " I'm not
: convinced that we're doing the
| best job we can. We're not get-

ting the message out on finan
cial aid, and I think we need to
address this. "
Despite the considerable eco
nomic restraints. Kennedy con
cluded that the coming years
will also be "a time of great op
portunity." He said the Univer
sity is in a sound position to han
dle its economic problems and
in "good shape relative to other
institutions of our general ambi
tion and quality."
The major object of scrutiny
for undergraduate education
should be the relationship
bewtween academic life in the
formal sense and the extracur
ricular. Kennedy said.
When questioned about the
University's recent interest in
KZSU, Kennedy replied, "
KZSU is a valuable cultural re
source that's failing to live up to
its potential. " "I just want it to
do something — I don't want to
control its (programming) con
tent," he said.
Senator Sherilyn Gilbert
asked Kennedy to state his
philosophy on student afffairs.
Kennedy told the Senate he
doesn't think he's developed one
yet.
"I think the proper role of the
institution should be to provide
catalysts and help but leave the
rest up to student initiative," he
said.
In regard to the contem
porary entertainment issue and
students putting on concerts,
Kennedy said its his "assump
tion that ASSU is interested in
concerts because the students
are interested in concerts."
"You're filling a cultural
niche you consider to be un
filled, and you know how to do it
better than I would," he said.
"My attitude is that this is your
business — so help yourself."
Following Kennedy's ap
pearance, the Senate voted to
continue with the Bluegrass
Festival proposed for this
spring. The festival will be pro
moted and financed by groups
outside the University, but stu
dents interested in concert
production will have the op
portunity to observe for their
educational benefit.

The University recently de
cided to raise tuition rates 13.6
percent and with double-digit in
flation, Kennedy said he expects
another high tuition increase
next year.
"We've wrung every ounce of
water out of this year's budget,
and we still don't have it in bal
ance, " hesaid With thecurrent
state of the economy, the Uni
versity must raise tuition to
break even, Kennedy added.
Kennedy predicted that Stan
ford's tuition increases will be
minimal in comparison with
those of other major private uni
versities. He said he'll be "sur
prised"- if any schools announce
lower rates — since some have
already set increases of 15
percent and it's possible others
may go as high as 20 percent.
"There's a certain in
evitability about it. and the
forces are fundamental," Ken
nedy said.
Kennedy discussed student fi
nancial support as a second
problem that has economic ori
gins. The recent trend has been
the government's retreat from
supporting higher education in
general, he said. As a result, the
levels of undergraduate and
graduate aid is affected, he
added.
ASSU Senator Jeff Bradach
expressed concern over those
students who don't even bother
to apply because the cost of at
tending is so high. He asked
Kennedy whether the Univer
sity is reaching out to potential
applicants and letting them
know about the aid possibilities.
Kennedy replied, " I'm not
: convinced that we're doing the
| best job we can. We're not get-

ting the message out on finan
cial aid, and I think we need to
address this. "
Despite the considerable eco
nomic restraints. Kennedy con
cluded that the coming years
will also be "a time of great op
portunity." He said the Univer
sity is in a sound position to han
dle its economic problems and
in "good shape relative to other
institutions of our general ambi
tion and quality."
The major object of scrutiny
for undergraduate education
should be the relationship
bewtween academic life in the
formal sense and the extracur
ricular. Kennedy said.
When questioned about the
University's recent interest in
KZSU, Kennedy replied, "
KZSU is a valuable cultural re
source that's failing to live up to
its potential. " "I just want it to
do something — I don't want to
control its (programming) con
tent," he said.
Senator Sherilyn Gilbert
asked Kennedy to state his
philosophy on student afffairs.
Kennedy told the Senate he
doesn't think he's developed one
yet.
"I think the proper role of the
institution should be to provide
catalysts and help but leave the
rest up to student initiative," he
said.
In regard to the contem
porary entertainment issue and
students putting on concerts,
Kennedy said its his "assump
tion that ASSU is interested in
concerts because the students
are interested in concerts."
"You're filling a cultural
niche you consider to be un
filled, and you know how to do it
better than I would," he said.
"My attitude is that this is your
business — so help yourself."
Following Kennedy's ap
pearance, the Senate voted to
continue with the Bluegrass
Festival proposed for this
spring. The festival will be pro
moted and financed by groups
outside the University, but stu
dents interested in concert
production will have the op
portunity to observe for their
educational benefit.
