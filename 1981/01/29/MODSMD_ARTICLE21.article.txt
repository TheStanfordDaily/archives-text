# Holding walls, but no sprinklers or smoke alarms installed
## Village residents worried about fire danger 
### Carl Johnston 
The fire broke out so quickly
in her two-story Escondido Vil
lage apartment that she didn't
know what to do.
She had no warning of the
blaze because the apartment
had no smoke detectors — none
of the buildings in the village do.
She had no way of putting the
fire out herself — she shares,
with six other apartment
holders, a 40-pound fire ext
inguisher which hangs outdoors
on a fence. Being late in preg
nancy, she could not move it.
On an earlier occasion, she
said, a neighbor had a fire, but
was unable to use the fire ext
inguisher because it had
jammed.
Other residents of the village,
particularly those in the seven
high-rise buildings, have be
come concerned about fire safe
ty in the village since the dis
astrous MGM Grand Hotel blaze
in Las Vegas which killed 84 peo
ple last fall. Some of the same
conditions prevail in Escondido.
these people say, that in
tensified problems at the casino
last year.
Each of the seven to 16-year
old high-rises have water
sprinklers only on the lobby
floor. The remaining floors have
neither automatic sprinklers
nor automatic smoke detectors.
And although the concrete
and-steel buildings are virtually
unburnable, they are un
protected against smoke. This is
important because smoke dam
age and smoke inhalation can be
,as dangerous and damaging as

the flame itself.
The two-story buildings
which house about half of the
village population, and all 900
village children, are even more
vulnerable because they do not
have the fire-proof construction
of the high-rises.
Another factor is that the
highest ladder at the Stanford
Fire Dept. can reach only the
eighth, or perhaps the ninth
story of two 12-story buildings.
This could leave three stories
stranded if a major fire broke
out and blocked all other means
of exit.
"I wouldn't describe myself
as a particularly paranoid indi
vidual," says Keith Newman, a
married mechanical engineer
ing major living on the eighth
floor of 12-story Quillen House,
"yet I do worry about the inade
quate fire safety system."
But though Newman's and
others' concerns might seem at
least partly justified, all of the
buildings in Escondido met or
exceeded building code stan
dards when they were built.
New building standards
passed in 1975, however, would
have required the buildings to
have automatic water
sprinklers and smoke detectors.
Both University and county
officials are quick to point out
the many sophisticated fire
safety provisions already in the
high-rise buildings.
— a compartmentalized
structure which isolates a blaze
within the room or apartment in
which it originates;
— the concrete-and-steel

frame of the building itself and
fire-proof partitions between
apartments;
— wet and dry stand-pipes
running the height of the build
ing which allow firemen to fight
blazes from inside the building;
— manual "pull-station" fire
alarms on each floor, two fire
extinguishers (compressed wa
ter ), and a fire hose station;
— automatic fire alarms and
sprinklers in the basement; and
— two enclosed interior stair
ways so the fire dept. can gain
access to the upper floors — and
tenants can evacuate.
In addition, the University is
spending millions of dollars to
meet a retroactive state law
passed five years ago which re
quires smoke detectors to be
placed in all elevator lobbys.
Also, elevator control boxes will
be placed on the ground floor of
each building to permit
rescuers to use elevators as well
as stairwells.
The controls would also pre
vent tenants from being caught
between floors in an emer
gency.
But even though this statute
was passed five years ago, and

two years of planning and much
money has been spent, there
still is not a single smoke detec
tor in an Escondido lobbyway.
Escondido Village suffers
from a paradox: although it rep
resents one third of the total
campus housing space and al
though it has its fire problems,
because it is a new, "fireproof"
building, it gets low-priority on
the University agenda to im
prove fire safety on campus.
Highest on the priority list
are the Row houses, the 70- and
80-year-old wood structures
which were built with little con
sideration for fire safety.
The dramatic blaze that
gutted Storey House last winter
justifies this concern. It is here,
with the rebuilding of the house,
that the University is currently
sinking many thousands of
dollars into automatic fire
doors, fire alarms and other fire
safety equipment.
"When the University does
spend money to improve fire
safety," says Peter Irish, depu
ty fire marshall for the Stanford
area of Santa Clara County, "it
does so where it will do the most
good on a statistical fire-loss

basis.
"Lower hazard areas (such
as the relatively new Escon
didio Village) are being ac
cepted more or less as-is in the
hopes that the occupants will ex
ercise good sense. This is some
thing we have to depend on in
fire protection generally."
Measures such as knowing
how to get out of one's building
in an emergency, familiarizing
oneself with the fire equipment
in the building and even perhaps
buying a personal smoke detec
tor and small chemical fire ext
inguisher are ways residents
can protect themselves.
Until the University ap
propriates the funds to make
improvements in the village,
the high rises will fall short of
the model uniform building code
of the International Conference
of Building Officials passed in
1979 — one of the standards mu
nicipal building codes are often
measured against.
The code's section relevant to
buildings over 75 feet high calls
for:
— an elevator control panel of
the type mentioned earlier.
