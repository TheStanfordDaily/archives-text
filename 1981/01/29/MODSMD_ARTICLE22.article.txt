# Solar equipment considered, costs to be studied
## New dormitory complex: Home suite home 
### Stephanie Peirolo 
Architects are putting the fin
ishing touches on plans for the
long-awaited 800 unit student
housing complex to be built west
of Lake Lagunita. Construction
is scheduled to begin this sum
mer.
Completion of the first sec
tion of the innovative three-type
housing complex is projected
early next year, according to
Associate Dean of Student Af
fairs for Residential Education
Norm Robinson, with the entire
$36 million "neighborhood," as
Robinson calls it, scheduled to
be finished in June 1983. â€¢
These first units will consist
of three independent houses
similar to existing Row Houses.
For economic reasons, how
ever, these will be slightly larg
er than residences on the Row,
accommodating 60 to 70 stu

dents.
Independent houses are the
most popular form of housing on
campus, and some have won
dered why only three were
planned for the new complex.
Robinson explained that
opening the new dorm could
lead to availability of more in
dependent houses now occupied
by fraternities. "For many peo
ple at Stanford, fraternities are
housing options rather than a so
cial option," he said. Many of
these students could opt for a re
turn to University housing once
the new dorm opens.
For this reason some of the
fraternities which have had
trouble in the past meeting Res
Ed's pledge quota may have to
give up their houses, according
to Robinson.
The second type of structure
is a form popular at many col

leges across the country, but
new to Stanford. The complex
will contain four buildings made
up entirely of four and six room
suites, each with its own bath
room and common room. These
will not contain their own dining
facilities, but rather residents
will eat in four new eating clubs
in the complex.
The third type will be a con
ventional interconnected
dormitory similar to Lagunita
Court.
Another new concept planned
for the complex is a central pro
gram center, which will make
up most of the common space
for the dorms. This program
center will contain everything
from darkrooms to music prac
tice rooms. There will also be a
large, well-stocked kitchen and
two dining rooms which will be
available to any organization on
campus.
This center will provide a

place for students from the dif
ferent houses to meet, as well as
attracting students from other
parts of campus, according to
Robinson.
Any of the dorms could poten
tially hold theme houses, ac
cording to Robinson, with the
possibility of "short, transient
themes" in some of the con
nected dorms. These would con
sist of a small group, yet still be
part of the rest of the dorm.
One other innovation under
consideration is solar power.
The buildings will be capable of
accommodating solar panels
and water tanks, according to
Project Manager Robert Ner
rie, but cost effectiveness of this
plan is still in question. The Uni
versity has retained the Pacific
Sun solar design firm to conduct
the study. Their figures will be
available next month.
Santa Clara County requires
all new residences to use solar

heating where economically
feasible, but this ordinance does
not apply to dormitories. How
ever, the University is operat
ing as if it had to abide by the
measure, according to Nerrie.
Though designed for under
graduates, the new housing
complex will also relieve the
graduate housing shortage, ac
cording to Robinson. When the
new complex opens, Manzanita
trailer park will be converted
into single graduate student
housing, three to a trailer.
There is also a plan to shift 370
spaces in Escondido Village
from married to single student
housing.
Projections of on-campus
space available between 1985
and 1990 see 42 percent of grads
and 84 percent of undergrads ac
commodated, as compared to
respective figures of 30 and 78
today.
