## Less thought is more in 'Altered States' 
### Jim Mattson 
Altered States is the world's
first 70-millimeter, six-track
stereo Looney Tune. It's bright
ly colored, wonderfully noisy,
and utterly vacuous.
It's not as funny as a Looney
Tune, nor as intelligently writ
ten. This tale of psychic re
search, much of which takes
place in an isolation tank filled
with lukewarm saline solution,
gets a lot of mileage out of pon
dering the "great questions":
What is man? Why is he here?
and When do we eat?
Paddy Chayefsky (who did
the script for Network) wrote
all these questions out so that
the movie's actors could say
them. Chayefsky, a helpful soul,
is always worried that we might
miss one of his points, so the ac
tors say the same things over
and over — only the word-order
gets changed, and that not by
much.
Yet, now that I think about it,
something more than sentence
structure must have been al
tered in Chayefskv's script. Af
ter seeing the completed movie,
he exercised his contractual
right to have his name removed
from the screenplay credit (it
was replaced by the pseudonym
Sidney Aaron). I'm fairly confi
dent that the inanities mouthed
by the characters found their or
igins in Chayefsky's typewriter
— all the standard, strident
hallmarks are present — but
I'm not so certain that he had all
that much to do with the things
they do when they're not pon
tificating.
The director is Ken Russell,
who has made a profitable, and
sometimes critically suc
cessful. career out of mucking
around with the great questions.
Up until now, he's been content
to make thrilling versions of the
classics (Women in Love) or the
lives of great composers (some
one described his version of
Tchaikovsky's life, The Music
Lovers, as being about a "poof
who writes tunes").
Now, Russell has entered the
science fiction sweepstakes. Al
tered States is a story about a
man who, after taking a drug
used in the rituals of a remote
tribe of Mexican Indians, begins
to evolve backwards (dis
evolve?). No, I don't know why
the Indians don't evolve
backward when they take the
drug; please don't write.
Aldous Huxley once wrote a

novel about an incredibly
wealthy man (modeled, it's
said, on William Randolph
Hearst) who spent his fortune
trying to prolong his life. The ef
fort is successful, but the older
the man gets, the more he re
verts to mankind's primal state
— at the end. he becomes a very
old ape. ,4 Itered States takes the
idea Huxley used for satire and
tries to present it as profound in
sight. Which, if you think about
it, is a pretty funny idea (sort of
a compendium of bullshit
through the ages), but I don't
think Russell/Chayefskv
laughed when they thought it up.
So, this scientist (well played,
all things considered, by Wil
liam Hurt) regresses into an
ape. but only for limited periods
of time. After one such episode,
they find him naked in the zoo
beside the remains of a goat
he'd eaten. He comes home and
tells his wife (not so well
played a.t.c. by Blair Brown);
she's pissed off at first, of
course (you'd be too if your hus
band had just eaten an entire
raw goat), but later she, too, be
comes convinced that he's
stumbled onto the key to the uni
verse.
And — this is something I for
got to tell you about — not only
does the man regress, he gains
strange powers suitable for
melting walls and starting
strange, unearthly whirlpools
which (we're told) extend right
down into the primal heart of
the universe.
If this sounds confusing, and
not a little silly, you're begin
ning to get a pretty good idea of
what the movie's all about. I
suspect that Russell knew what
was happening — and wasn't
happening — and simply didn't
care. Ideas aren't the type of
thing he tends to worry about.
But, as one might expect from
a movie this schizoid, Altered
States isn't entirely wretched.
Some parts of it are, in fact,
quite wonderful.
The photography is gorgeous,
and Russell works hard to fill
every deep-focus frame with in
teresting bits of business. Ex
cept for an occasional in
terminable dialogue sequence
(those "great questions"
again), he's frenziedly suc
cessful. This movie is, in some
respects, closer to a musical
than a horror film — the effects
sequences, many (but by no
means all) of them marvellous

set pieces, have about as little to
do with Altered States' nar
rative as the production num
bers in a '30s Warners musical
have to do with its plot. The
movie practically begs you to
stop thinking long enough to en
joy them.
The movie's sound track is
also impressive. It's advertised
as being in "Megasound,"
which sounds an awful lot like
standard Dolby stereo. But even
if it's "only'' six-track stereo,
it's still creepy enough, and loud

enough, and lively enough to be
a terrific asset. (When Altered
States moves to smaller thea
ters down the Peninsula, it'll
probably be presented in
monaural sound; if you plan to
see it. it's probably worth the
drive up to San Francisco just
for the sound system.)
The ape — excuse me, the
"primal man" — Hurt re
gresses into is probably the best
part of the movie. As played by
dancer Miguel Godreau it has a
grace and style the rest of the

movie lacks. Maybe because it
doesn't have to say anything, or
maybe because Godreau man
ages to instill a sense of apish
joy, we believe in it, and under
stand it, much more than we do
any of the movie's approxima
tions of human characters.
Whoever designed Godreau's
makeup chose to give him glow
ing. neon-blue eyes, and when
the creature looks up to the sky,
we almost believe that it sees
worlds not visible to mere mor
tals.

for the sound system.)
The ape — excuse me, the
"primal man" — Hurt re
gresses into is probably the best
part of the movie. As played by
dancer Miguel Godreau it has a
grace and style the rest of the

movie lacks. Maybe because it
doesn't have to say anything, or
maybe because Godreau man
ages to instill a sense of apish
joy, we believe in it, and under
stand it, much more than we do
any of the movie's approxima
tions of human characters.
Whoever designed Godreau's
makeup chose to give him glow

the creature looks up to the sky,
we almost believe that it sees
worlds not visible to mere mor

William Hurt in 'Altered States.'
Altered States is the world's
first 70-millimeter, six-track
stereo Looney Tune. It's bright
ly colored, wonderfully noisy,
and utterly vacuous.
It's not as funny as a Looney
Tune, nor as intelligently writ
ten. This tale of psychic re
search, much of which takes
place in an isolation tank filled
with lukewarm saline solution,
gets a lot of mileage out of pon
dering the "great questions":
What is man? Why is he here?
and When do we eat?
Paddy Chayefsky (who did
the script for Network) wrote
all these questions out so that
the movie's actors could say
them. Chayefsky, a helpful soul,
is always worried that we might
miss one of his points, so the ac
tors say the same things over
and over — only the word-order
gets changed, and that not by
much.
Yet, now that I think about it,
something more than sentence
structure must have been al
tered in Chayefskv's script. Af
ter seeing the completed movie,
he exercised his contractual
right to have his name removed
from the screenplay credit (it
was replaced by the pseudonym
Sidney Aaron). I'm fairly confi
dent that the inanities mouthed
by the characters found their or
igins in Chayefsky's typewriter
— all the standard, strident
hallmarks are present — but
I'm not so certain that he had all
that much to do with the things
they do when they're not pon
tificating.
The director is Ken Russell,
who has made a profitable, and
sometimes critically suc
cessful. career out of mucking
around with the great questions.
Up until now, he's been content
to make thrilling versions of the
classics (Women in Love) or the
lives of great composers (some
one described his version of
Tchaikovsky's life, The Music
Lovers, as being about a "poof
who writes tunes").
Now, Russell has entered the
science fiction sweepstakes. Al
tered States is a story about a
man who, after taking a drug
used in the rituals of a remote
tribe of Mexican Indians, begins
to evolve backwards (dis
evolve?). No, I don't know why
the Indians don't evolve
backward when they take the
drug; please don't write.
Aldous Huxley once wrote a

novel about an incredibly
wealthy man (modeled, it's
said, on William Randolph
Hearst) who spent his fortune
trying to prolong his life. The ef
fort is successful, but the older
the man gets, the more he re
verts to mankind's primal state
— at the end. he becomes a very
old ape. ,4 Itered States takes the
idea Huxley used for satire and
tries to present it as profound in
sight. Which, if you think about
it, is a pretty funny idea (sort of
a compendium of bullshit
through the ages), but I don't
think Russell/Chayefskv
laughed when they thought it up.
So, this scientist (well played,
all things considered, by Wil
liam Hurt) regresses into an
ape. but only for limited periods
of time. After one such episode,
they find him naked in the zoo
beside the remains of a goat
he'd eaten. He comes home and
tells his wife (not so well
played a.t.c. by Blair Brown);
she's pissed off at first, of
course (you'd be too if your hus
band had just eaten an entire
raw goat), but later she, too, be
comes convinced that he's
stumbled onto the key to the uni
verse.
And — this is something I for
got to tell you about — not only
does the man regress, he gains
strange powers suitable for
melting walls and starting
strange, unearthly whirlpools
which (we're told) extend right
down into the primal heart of
the universe.
If this sounds confusing, and
not a little silly, you're begin
ning to get a pretty good idea of
what the movie's all about. I
suspect that Russell knew what
was happening — and wasn't
happening — and simply didn't
care. Ideas aren't the type of
thing he tends to worry about.
But, as one might expect from
a movie this schizoid, Altered
States isn't entirely wretched.
Some parts of it are, in fact,
quite wonderful.
The photography is gorgeous,
and Russell works hard to fill
every deep-focus frame with in
teresting bits of business. Ex
cept for an occasional in
terminable dialogue sequence
(those "great questions"
again), he's frenziedly suc
cessful. This movie is, in some
respects, closer to a musical
than a horror film — the effects
sequences, many (but by no
means all) of them marvellous

set pieces, have about as little to
do with Altered States' nar
rative as the production num
bers in a '30s Warners musical
have to do with its plot. The
movie practically begs you to
stop thinking long enough to en
joy them.
The movie's sound track is
also impressive. It's advertised
as being in "Megasound,"
which sounds an awful lot like
standard Dolby stereo. But even
if it's "only'' six-track stereo,
it's still creepy enough, and loud

enough, and lively enough to be
a terrific asset. (When Altered
States moves to smaller thea
ters down the Peninsula, it'll
probably be presented in
monaural sound; if you plan to
see it. it's probably worth the
drive up to San Francisco just
for the sound system.)
The ape — excuse me, the
"primal man" — Hurt re
