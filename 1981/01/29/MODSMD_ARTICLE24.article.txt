# Stoppard straddles comedy/tragedy line
## 
### David Schmelzer 
The opening scene of Tom
Stoppard's Night and Day is one
of the most bizarre, yet arrest
ing and thought-provoking in
contemporary theater, observa
tions that could as well be made
of the play as a whole. His ex
amination of the role of the
press, both in general and in the
case of a Third World nation
soon to be at war, is not for those
looking for a quick laugh or
mindless entertainment. While
certainly witty in the driest
British sense, the play as a
whole is jarring and ultimately
disturbing, a reaction for which
the playwright was clearly
striving.
The plot is structured around
the efforts of two reporters to
cover a foreseen Soviet-backed
revolution against the newly
formed government of Kam

bawe, a fictional African nation.
But this framework serves pri
marily to give Stoppard a forum
for an extended discussion of the
merits and flaws of a free press.
Can a national newspaper
owned by a foreign millionaire
truly be called 'free'? Is the
phrase merely a smokescreen to
shield the reporter's true aim —
ego-glorification? Does the
presence of a free press change
the news it was sent to cover?
These are provocative questions
to be raised by a man who
claims to write with no social
objective, but he remains true
to this assertion by refusing to
allow any stand to win. Night
and I)ay could be a text on dev
il's advocacy. Every character
has a distinct position which he
states forcefully and eloquent
ly, only to be contradicted by an
equally eloquent counterpart.

Even at the close, where Stop
pard seems to finally take a
position by allowing a character
the final word, the other side
quickly gets its share of poetic
justice.
This is not to suggest that the
show is no more than an intellec
tual debate, however. The lo
cale in itself presents possi
bilities for action, many of
which are explored. But the ac
tion that sets this play apart
from others comes from the use
of unusual plot devices. Where
the"day" in the title refers to
conscious discussion, the
"night" shows us the emotional
side of the arguments, and it is
here that Stoppard feels most
free to play games with the au
dience. Ruth, his person
ification of this, is wont to break
from a discussion for a quick
aside to the audience, or even

for a short ironic song, complete
with piano accompaniment. The
audience is surprised with a
fierce slaying and an equally
fierce affair on stage, all the
while not knowing whether to
believe the action taking place.
The American Conservatory
Theatre's treatment of the show
is above all professional. Eliz
abeth Huddle, here becoming
only the second woman director
in the ACT's 15-year history,
should be directing many prod
uctions for them in the future,
judging from her work here.
Her treatment of an extremely
difficult work is skillful in main
taining the shocking essence of
the play without seeming
awkward.
Byron Jennings is the most
impressive member of a tal
ented cast. In appearance a
cockney Martin Mull, he is none

theless a consummate dramatic
actor. As a photographer and
war veteran, he provides the
bridge between the realistic and
emotional divisions, so he more
than the rest must display some
range, and does, showing in
dignation, compassion, and the
terror of death effectively and
movingly. Yet, even consider
ing this, the most difficult role
in the show belonged to DeAnn
Mears, as Ruth, and that prob
lem showed in her performance.
Although Mears has a comman
ding stage presence and is an ex
perienced actress, these assets
perversely proved to be handi
caps as Ruth has these same
qualities within her, and if over
played even slightly the charac
ter moves from a flighty, theat
rical woman to an actress in a
show apart from the one that in
volves the rest of the cast.

perienced actress, these assets
perversely proved to be handi
caps as Ruth has these same
qualities within her, and if over

ter moves from a flighty, theat
rical woman to an actress in a
show apart from the one that in
volves the rest of the cast.
The opening scene of Tom
Stoppard's Night and Day is one
of the most bizarre, yet arrest
ing and thought-provoking in
contemporary theater, observa
tions that could as well be made
of the play as a whole. His ex
amination of the role of the
press, both in general and in the
case of a Third World nation
soon to be at war, is not for those
looking for a quick laugh or
mindless entertainment. While
certainly witty in the driest
British sense, the play as a
whole is jarring and ultimately
disturbing, a reaction for which
the playwright was clearly
striving.
The plot is structured around
the efforts of two reporters to
cover a foreseen Soviet-backed
revolution against the newly
formed government of Kam

bawe, a fictional African nation.
But this framework serves pri
marily to give Stoppard a forum
for an extended discussion of the
merits and flaws of a free press.
Can a national newspaper
owned by a foreign millionaire
truly be called 'free'? Is the
phrase merely a smokescreen to
shield the reporter's true aim —
ego-glorification? Does the
presence of a free press change
the news it was sent to cover?
These are provocative questions
to be raised by a man who
claims to write with no social
objective, but he remains true
to this assertion by refusing to
allow any stand to win. Night
and I)ay could be a text on dev
il's advocacy. Every character
has a distinct position which he
states forcefully and eloquent
ly, only to be contradicted by an
equally eloquent counterpart.

Even at the close, where Stop
pard seems to finally take a
position by allowing a character
the final word, the other side
quickly gets its share of poetic
justice.
This is not to suggest that the
show is no more than an intellec
tual debate, however. The lo
cale in itself presents possi
bilities for action, many of
which are explored. But the ac
tion that sets this play apart
from others comes from the use
of unusual plot devices. Where
the"day" in the title refers to
conscious discussion, the
"night" shows us the emotional
side of the arguments, and it is
here that Stoppard feels most
free to play games with the au
dience. Ruth, his person
ification of this, is wont to break
from a discussion for a quick
aside to the audience, or even

for a short ironic song, complete
with piano accompaniment. The
audience is surprised with a
fierce slaying and an equally
fierce affair on stage, all the
while not knowing whether to
believe the action taking place.
The American Conservatory
Theatre's treatment of the show
is above all professional. Eliz
abeth Huddle, here becoming
only the second woman director
in the ACT's 15-year history,
should be directing many prod
uctions for them in the future,
judging from her work here.
Her treatment of an extremely
difficult work is skillful in main
taining the shocking essence of
the play without seeming
awkward.
Byron Jennings is the most
impressive member of a tal
ented cast. In appearance a
cockney Martin Mull, he is none

theless a consummate dramatic
actor. As a photographer and
war veteran, he provides the
bridge between the realistic and
emotional divisions, so he more
than the rest must display some
range, and does, showing in
dignation, compassion, and the
terror of death effectively and
movingly. Yet, even consider
ing this, the most difficult role
in the show belonged to DeAnn
Mears, as Ruth, and that prob
lem showed in her performance.
Although Mears has a comman
ding stage presence and is an ex
perienced actress, these assets
perversely proved to be handi
caps as Ruth has these same
qualities within her, and if over
played even slightly the charac
ter moves from a flighty, theat
rical woman to an actress in a
show apart from the one that in
volves the rest of the cast.
