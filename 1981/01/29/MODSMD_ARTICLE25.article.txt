# Lubovitch shines
## 
### Mary Walp 
Often, an entire program of a
single choreographer's work
gets a little tedious. Last Thurs
day evening in Memorial
Auditorium, however, the au
dience was treated to an entire
evening of Lar Lubovitch's
works performed by his own
company (the New York-based
Lar Lubovitch Dance Com
pany), and while each of the
four works on the program car
ried the choreographer's signa
ture, each remained refresh
ingly original.
Perhaps the one exception to
this was the opening sequence to
"Calvacade," which seemed to
resemble the first ballet,
"North Star," a little too close
ly. Lubovitch's use of eight to 10
dancers on stage at once in a
confused yet somehow unified
group was interesting, but not
enough to justify this sort of rep
etition.
Lubovitch choreographs pow
erful ballets, borrowing from
both the classical and modern
schools and using the members
of his company well. Although
there are no real stars that dom
inate the troupe, the choreo
graphy does provide a few solos.
Notable were Christine Wright
in "Exultate Jubilate" and Rob
Besserer in "North Star." All of
Lubovitch's 10 versatile dancers
move from the more classical to
the modern numbers smoothly
and easily.

Laura Gates's solo in "Ex
ultate Jubilate" was an unusual
dance, consisting for the most
part of jerks and contortions of
her body with which Lubovitch
somehow manages to capture a
great deal of emotion. Similar
ly, the entrance of the four dan
cers in the Adagio of the same
ballet is a surprising element
that precedes Wrights's more
classical interlude.
Lubovitch's ballets are filled
with unexpected, yet pleasant,
twists. One of these was the two
quartets in "North Star," the
first consisting of three males
and one female, the second of
three females and one male.
There were several very excit
ing lifts, and the almost sym
metrical pas de deuxs provided
an interesting contrast between
the traditional male/female
pair and a couple of the same
sex. Also, the two men who
danced disjointedly in and out of
the other six on stage in
"Calvacade" gave a humorous
twist to that ballet. Lubovitch
even seemed to be playing with
the audience at times, as in the
opening pas de deux of "Ex
ultate Jubilate." Once one be
came comfortable with the clas
sical, formal, almost courtly
style, the dancers broke into
playful, carefree movements.
The lighting and costuming
complemented the ballets very
well, without getting in the way
of the choreography.
