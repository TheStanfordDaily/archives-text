# Eureka refreshes
## 
### Stephen Nash 
It's been a hectic weekend.
Three plays, two films, lots of
restaurants — except for sleep
ing and eating breakfast, I've
hardly been home. Maybe I
should have slept elsewhere,
too; a little cuddling might have
done me some good. As it is, I
think I'm coming down with a
cold. And I'm going to pan one of
the plays I saw, something I
don't enjoy doing. Everyone
knows that heroin addiction has
its hazards. Cultural addiction
isn't so safe, either. But I better
get down to work, before I have
to go to bed with my two
aspirins and my plenty of fluids.
I was at the Eureka Theatre
on Saturday night. For the next
few weeks, at irregular times
(mainly weekend midnights),
they are presenting five short
monologues by Bay Area
writers under the heading "Five
Times in an Hour." How re
freshing to see a few authors
turning their backs on the 'big
ger-is-better' syndrome.
Like a popular song, a short
monologue often relies for ef
fect on triggering memories in
the audience. There is no time to
establish a historical back
ground for a character, so the
playwright must make assump
tions about the experiences the
audience has had, and have the
audience fill in much of the
background for itself.
I'm going to describe the five
monologues in the order in
which they were performed. I
will say ahead of time that I had
a marvelous time at the theater
watching the five of them. I
liked the fourth one best. I had
trouble relating to the charac
ters in the third and fifth
monologues, because my past
and the past of the characters
were too disjoint. I am reluctant
to say much more in way of
judgment. The effect of these
monologues is so dependent on
nostalgia that it is almost im
possible to make any remark
that isn't hopelessly ephemeral
due to its subjectivity.
"The Carmaker" by Rik Mys
lewski (who also designed the
very unique program) describes

a worker at a car assembly
plant who has been laid off be
cause the plant has closed. He
has gone to a hotel room with a
bottle of Wild Turkey, some pa
per cups, a box of Secanol, and a
Japanese tape recorder in order
to commit suicide. It's much
funnier than it sounds, because
Myslewski (who also performs
the monologue) treats the paper
cups like a ventriloquist's dum
my, having them talk to him
before he drinks them dry. He
also links American car models
with events in his life, and
America's love affair with the
automobile offers lots of good
comedy material.
"Palm Sunday" by Susan
Rivers is about a woman at a
restaurant waiting (in vain) for
her computer date to show up.
While sitting there, she men
tions all sorts of details from
her past — her Presbyterian up
bringing, her sexually-active
friend Bernice. Out of her
ramblings emerges the story of
boyfriend No. 9, who at one point
had proposed to her, but whom
she let slip away from her.
"Oh Well" by Bennett Cohen
(performed by Stephen Le-
Grand) has a rock
guitarist/composer wander mu
sically through the history of
rock and roll, from the days of
Buddy Holly up to the present
and the Fab Mab. His mind fixes
on performers who have died:
Holly, Hendrix, Joplin, and Len
non.
"Cold Storage" by Elizabeth
Wray (performed by Saun Ellis,
directed by David Parr) is the
story of 10 years in a rela
tionship. Whenever she moves,
the narrator smashes a piece of
furniture and puts it in cold
storage. During the monologue,
she wanders from one relic to
another, pulling memories from
chair legs, doors, and bedposts.
"Dreamofornia" by Scott
Wren (performed by David
Parr, directed by Saun Ellis) is
a humorous Southern California
piece about a giant margarita
(created in a cement mixer).
During the mixing, the narrator
kills his fern with Clorox bleach
as a way of getting back at a lov
er who has left him.

has gone to a hotel room with a
bottle of Wild Turkey, some pa
per cups, a box of Secanol, and a
Japanese tape recorder in order
to commit suicide. It's much
funnier than it sounds, because
Myslewski (who also performs
the monologue) treats the paper
cups like a ventriloquist's dum
my, having them talk to him
before he drinks them dry. He
also links American car models
with events in his life, and
America's love affair with the
automobile offers lots of good
comedy material.
"Palm Sunday" by Susan
Rivers is about a woman at a
restaurant waiting (in vain) for
her computer date to show up.
While sitting there, she men
tions all sorts of details from
her past — her Presbyterian up
bringing, her sexually-active
friend Bernice. Out of her
ramblings emerges the story of
boyfriend No. 9, who at one point
had proposed to her, but whom
she let slip away from her.
"Oh Well" by Bennett Cohen
(performed by Stephen Le-
Grand) has a rock
guitarist/composer wander mu
sically through the history of
rock and roll, from the days of
Buddy Holly up to the present
and the Fab Mab. His mind fixes
on performers who have died:
Holly, Hendrix, Joplin, and Len
non.
"Cold Storage" by Elizabeth
Wray (performed by Saun Ellis,
directed by David Parr) is the
story of 10 years in a rela
tionship. Whenever she moves,
the narrator smashes a piece of
furniture and puts it in cold
storage. During the monologue,
she wanders from one relic to
another, pulling memories from
chair legs, doors, and bedposts.
"Dreamofornia" by Scott
Wren (performed by David
Parr, directed by Saun Ellis) is
a humorous Southern California
piece about a giant margarita
(created in a cement mixer).
During the mixing, the narrator
kills his fern with Clorox bleach
as a way of getting back at a lov
er who has left him.
It's been a hectic weekend.
Three plays, two films, lots of
restaurants — except for sleep
ing and eating breakfast, I've
hardly been home. Maybe I
should have slept elsewhere,
too; a little cuddling might have
done me some good. As it is, I
think I'm coming down with a
cold. And I'm going to pan one of
the plays I saw, something I
don't enjoy doing. Everyone
knows that heroin addiction has
its hazards. Cultural addiction
isn't so safe, either. But I better
get down to work, before I have
to go to bed with my two
aspirins and my plenty of fluids.
I was at the Eureka Theatre
on Saturday night. For the next
few weeks, at irregular times
(mainly weekend midnights),
they are presenting five short
monologues by Bay Area
writers under the heading "Five
Times in an Hour." How re
freshing to see a few authors
turning their backs on the 'big
ger-is-better' syndrome.
Like a popular song, a short
monologue often relies for ef
fect on triggering memories in
the audience. There is no time to
establish a historical back
ground for a character, so the
playwright must make assump
tions about the experiences the
audience has had, and have the
audience fill in much of the
background for itself.
I'm going to describe the five
monologues in the order in
which they were performed. I
will say ahead of time that I had
a marvelous time at the theater
watching the five of them. I
liked the fourth one best. I had
trouble relating to the charac
ters in the third and fifth
monologues, because my past
and the past of the characters
were too disjoint. I am reluctant
to say much more in way of
judgment. The effect of these
monologues is so dependent on
nostalgia that it is almost im
possible to make any remark
that isn't hopelessly ephemeral
due to its subjectivity.
"The Carmaker" by Rik Mys
lewski (who also designed the
very unique program) describes

a worker at a car assembly
plant who has been laid off be
cause the plant has closed. He
has gone to a hotel room with a
bottle of Wild Turkey, some pa
per cups, a box of Secanol, and a
Japanese tape recorder in order
to commit suicide. It's much
funnier than it sounds, because
Myslewski (who also performs
the monologue) treats the paper
cups like a ventriloquist's dum
my, having them talk to him
before he drinks them dry. He
also links American car models
with events in his life, and
America's love affair with the
automobile offers lots of good
comedy material.
