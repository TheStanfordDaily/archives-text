# A
						late vote for the year's best movies
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
It's more difficult than ever
to make a good movie in Holly
wood, and the situation abroad
isn't much better, so the prepon
derance of worthwhile pictures
last year (particularly during
the fall) is probably flukey rath
er than prophetic. This is the
first time in six years that I've
felt that all the good films re
leased in 12 months could not be
contained in a list of 10; being
self-indulgent by nature, I ex
panded my list to 12. In all other
categories there are five en
tries.
BEST PICTURE
1. Kagemusha the Shadow
Warrior (Japan)
In form this is a samurai epic,
but the question it confronts —
what is the relationship of a man
to his alter ego? — is one that is
central to the work of Piran
dello, Conrad, Dostoevski, Poe
and many other great writers.
In a samurai chief
tain appoints a double who
stands in for hinrwwhen he dies,
the double must become the
fallen leader.
2. The Chant of Jimmie Black
smith (Australia)
Thomas Keneally's adroit,
eloquent novel has been given a
potent translation to the screen.
Jimmie Blacksmith is a young
half-white, half-aborigine
whose failure to succeed in the
white world, due to the disdain
ful treatment he receives from
his white employers and their
wives, triggers off an explosion
in him. This violent, im
passioned film is perhaps the
most plangent study we have of
the painful search for racial
identity.
3. Christ Stopped at Eholi (Ita
ly)
Almost nobody has seen this
beautiful movie by Francisco
Rosi, based on the memoirs of
Carlo Levi, an anti-Fascist ex
iled by Mussolini to a remote
Italian village. The title is a ref
erence to the primitivism of the
people, who have been locked
out of civilization: the story
goes that Christ got as far as
Eboli in his travels but no
farther, and so this region was
deprived even of that sort of
grace. When Eholi played in Ita
ly, it was much longer, and cer
tainly the film feels truncated in
its present American release
form; even so, it is a near-mas

terpiece.
4. The Elephant Man (Great
Britain)
A triumph of romanticism.
The spirit of Charles Dickens
hovers over this portrait of John
Merrick, the hideously de
formed "Elephant Man": the
real horror is the Industrial
Revolution, and in Merrick's re
alization of his human potential
we can see the ascension to
manhood of all the mistreated
heroes of Dickens's novels.
5. Dressed tn Kill (United
States)
Those who claim that this
movie is misogynistic are, I be
lieve, confusing the motives of
the director, Brian De Palma,
with those of the murderer in
the movie. Those who see it as a
steal from Psycho really miss
the point, which is that De
Palma plays with Hitchcock's
themes and takes them farther
than anyone else has ever dared
to. Dressed to Kill is the wit
tiest, most elegant, inventive
and erotic murder mystery I've
ever seen.
6. The Empire Strikes Rack
(United States)
When has an adventure movie
moved so rapidly? There used to
be a popular cliche that watch
ing this or that picture was like
riding a roller coaster; The
Empire Strikes Back may be
the first movie to justify that
platitude. An extraordinary
piece of craftmanship with sur
prising emotional power: the
scenes between Luke Skywalker
and his diminutive Jed Ai in
structor Yoda recall the best
passages in Tolkien and C.S.
Lewis.
7. Melvin and Howard (United
States)
I don't want to say too much
about Jonathan Demme's mov
ie because it will be opening
here within the next couple of
weeks. It is based on the story of
Melvin Dummar, the Nevada
ne'er-do-well listed as major re
cipient in Howard Hughes's
much-disputed "Mormon" will,
and it is, I think, a classic Amer
ican comedy.
8. The Stunt Man (United
States)
When you see this exhilarat
ing, multi-tiered burlesque on
the theme of reality and il
lusion, you are torn between
outrage that the director, Rich
ard Rush, almost couldn't get
the picture released and grat
itude that he finally managed to.

This is surely the most uncon
ventional movie ever made
about making movies.
9. Raging Bull (United States)
Martin Scorsese's treatment
of the life of the boxer Jake La
Motta is highly impressive if
cold and not really likable. No
one else has ever stylized vio
lence in quite this way ; in fact,
as an exercise in style, the mov
ie is flawless. Raging Bull leads
one to believe that Scorsese can
do just about anything — even if
one wishes that he had chosen to
do something else.
10. Used Cars (United States)
Robert Zemeckis and Bob
Gale wrote this hilarious, hard
hearted satire on business, and
Zemeckis directed it. It is the
best example of a home-grown
blend of visual and verbal com
edy since the idiosyncratic
farces of Preston Sturges: gags
and offhand repartee are piled
so thick that you're not always
sure what you're laughing at.
And after a dozen years of big
budget car chases in movies,
Used Cars has invented a vari
ation that will be difficult to sur
pass — an automotive take-off
on the chariot race in Ben-Hur.
11. Makes Perfect
(France)
A muted, poignant comedy by
Phillippe De Broca about the
struggle of a celebrated pianist
to hold onto everything he has
ever had of value — in other
words, his fight against growing
old. The cast is impeccable.
12. Return of the Secaucus'Sev
en (United States)
A group of '60s folks approach
30 and try to stay spiritually
alive on the periphery of socie
ty. Though John Sayles's film
looks like a home movie, it
achieves a closeness to its char
acters — in part because of its
unfinished visual quality — that
is rare. This movie is a tribute to
what may now come to be called
the John Lennon generation.
BEST DIRECTOR
Akira Kurosawa
Kagemusha the Shadow War
rior
Kurosawa turned 70 last
year; I can't think of another
filmmaker of his age who has
ever done work of this caliber.
My choice of Kurosawa as the
best director of the year is in no
way intended to be patronizing,
however; I can't think of anoth
er living filmmaker of any age
— with the possible exception of
Francis Ford Coppola, who is

co-executive producer of
Kagemusha — who would be
capable of creating a picture of
this scope.
2. Brian De Palma - Dressed to
Kill
De Palma seems to have in
herited Sam Peckinpah's repu
tation as Hollywood's bad boy,
though the only really lousy
commercial movie he's ever
made is his most "acceptable"
one, Obsession. He's certainly
audacious, though I don't see
that as synonymous with "of
fensive." Dressed to Kill is full
of sequences that are bound to
achieve classic status; my own
favorite is the silent cat and
mouse game in the Metropolitan
Museum, in which the camera
never rests.
3. David Lynch - The Elephant
Man
At the other end of the scale
from Kurosawa is the young
English director, David Lynch,
whose first film was
Eraser head and whose second,
The Elephant Man, manifests
the sort of assurance that one
hardly expects from someone
who is not the veteran of at least
half a dozen projects. Lynch's
style here weaves together nat
uralistic and expressionistic
elements.
4. Fred Schepisi - The Chant of
■Jimmie Blacksmith
Schepisi's visual shorthand
captures the terseness of
Keneally's prose perfectly. The
relentlessly violent climax is an
astonishing piece of filmmaking
(though it is difficult to watch).
5. Irvin Kershner - The Empire
Strikes Back
Kershner has been doing
first-rate work for more than 15
years, though until The Empire
his best pictures — Loving, Re
turn of a Man Called Horse,
The Luck of (linger Coffey,
Eyes of Laura Mars — have en
joyed a high standing only
among small groups of film
buffs. The Empire is clearly a
movie made by a wizard who
can quote effortlessly from such
disparate sources as Fritz Lang,
Gustave Dore, Salvador Dali,
and Shakespeare.
BEST ACTOR
Robert De Niro - Raging Bull
De Niro is generally conceded
to be the best working actor in
American movies; as the critic
Peter Rainer once wrote, he
belongs to the recent school of
actors who seem to be possessed

by the characters they play. The
only element in De Niro's
portrayal of Jake La Motta that
prevents it from being a great
American performance is the
distance he retains from us: in
his best roles (in Mean Streets,
Taxi Driver, New York, New
York) he draws us in.
2. Peter O'Toole - The Stunt
Man
In Eli Cross, the brilliant,
absurd, flamboyant, manipu
lative film director, O'Toole has
his best screen role in over a
decade. He usually gives crum
my pictures so much of a lift
that they're worth seeing de
spite everyone and everything
else in them; seeing him in a
movie this good is a special
treat. He gives a dazzling per
formance.
3. Jean Rochefort - l*ractice
Makes Perfect
Rochefort is a superb actor
whose face is better known than
his name. Edouard Choiseul, the
concert pianist, is one of the two
roles that has ever done justice
to his gifts. (The other one is the
woman-hating gynecologist in
Bertrand Blier's Femmes Fa
tales. )
4. Gary Busey - Carny. Gary
Busey (who played Buddy Hol
ly) is Frankie, who dons white
face and clown's garb every
day, steps into a cage, and
taunts suckers at a carnival so
that they will pay to take pot
shots at him. The process seems
to operate as an exorcism: when
he emerges from his cage, he's
the nicest guy in the world.
Busey's chilling performance is
the high point of this uneven,
fascinating movie.
5. Brad Dourif - Wise Blood
Brad Dourif may not be able
to play a sane human being, but
he's collecting quite a gallery of
crazies — Billy Bibbitt in One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,
the creepy chauffeur in Eyes of
Laura Mars, and now Hazel
Motes, preacher of the gospel of
the Church Without Christ. Per
haps no one else could embody
Flannery O'Connor's weird, ob
sessed character. (The movie
was directed by John Huston.)
BEST ACTRESS
Shelley Dtivall - Popeve
This is such an unusual per
formance that it's difficult to
describe. Duvall uses her rub
ber stick legs like Ray Bolger in
The Wizard of ()z, and her line
