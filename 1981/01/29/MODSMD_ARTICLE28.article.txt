# The 						Clash ambivalent
## 
### Charles Buckley 
"In these days, I don't know
what to sing
the more I know, the less my
tune can swing."
It's difficult to say what Mick
Jones, Joe Strummer, Paul Si
monon, and Topper Headon
were driving at in making the
Clash's fourth American-re
leased LP, Sandinista. As
evidenced by the above line
from "Kingston Advice," one of
Sandinista's 36 songs, perhaps
the four weren't sure them
selves.
What we have here is a rock
and-roll identity crisis, some
thing one would expect from a
once self-declared "garage
band" that has emerged into the
umpteenth media-declared
"greatest rock-and-roll band in
the world". From the moment
the Class released (live Em
Enough Rope in 1978, they had
set themselves up for an in
evitable self-analysis; thp LP
was, after all, the ultimate
rock-and-roll album, and it
probably would have been best
if the Clash had just ascended
into heaven after making it. The
band had conquered a frontier,
despite the fact that they had
yet to attain wide-scale popu
larity.
Ascension not being possible,
the question thus became death
or glory. It was this question
that the Clash addressed on last
year's London Calling, a ma
jestic retrospective of the fron
tier which the group had con
quered. The Clash's answer was
that there would be neither
death nor glory, but rather
something new and different,
which would keep the band from
a bleak Sex Pistols kind of end
ing but at the same time avoid
the great rock-and-roll-swindle,
that is, neither die out nor sell
out. Due to the overall brilliance
of London Calling, it was easy
to believe Strummer at the end
of the album when he sang:
"Tell your ma, tell your pa eve
rything's gonna be alright.
Can't you feel it, don't ignore it,
gonna be arl-right."
The problem thus posed in
making Sandinista was one of
showing that things really were
going to be "arl-right." Un
fortunately, with its overall
lack of direction, Sandinista
leaves little evidence of truth to
Strummer s declaration. At the
same time, however, the album
does not make Strummer out to
be a liar either; Sandinista is an
album characterized by am
bivalence.
The overall result is that qual
ity has been sacrificed for varie
ty. Though there are strong
signs of sellout on the album's
opening song, "The Magnificent
Seven," there are equally
strong signs of dieout on the
album's closing song,
"Shepard's Delight"; this typi

fies the pattern, the songs that
lie in between being a series of
oscillations between the com
mercial sound and the under
ground sound which lead one to
believe that the Clash are not
quite prepared to comfortably
settle at either extreme.
The only thing which appears
consistently throughout the
album is politics, whether it be
on a pop song like side one's
"Ivan Meets G.I. Joe," or on
side four's arty, foreign-sound
ing "The Equalizer." Some
times the political messages are
clear, like on "The Call Up," in
which it is stated that "he who
will die is he who has killed"; at
other times, the lyrics are a bit
more esoteric, such as on
"Charlie Don't Surf," a song
whose title refers to a line in
Coppola's film Apocalypse Now.
Regardless of their dif
ferences, what is noticeable
about all of the political songs
on Sandinista is their musical
emptiness. It was Mick Jones
who once said that people would
also rather dance than hear
about wars.
The Clash have always been a
political band, but on past
songs, they have blended their
politics into their music rather
than to blend their music into
their politics; the fact that they
follow the latter course on
Sandinista indicates that they
have lost track of their
priorities. I remember listening
to "Drug Squad" (from Give
Em Enough Rope) four or five
times before it occurred to me
that there were actually some
very perceptive lyrics behind
the high energy music that I had
been bobbing up and down to,
and indeed had the group not in
cluded a print of the lyrics to the
songs on London Calling, cuts
like "Working for the
Clampdown" and "Death or
Glory" might have been forever
danced to without being recog
nized for their messages. In the
case of the songs on Sandinista,
one finds oneself reaching for
the lyric sheets very quickly, be
cause there is nothing better to
do.
A song like "Washington Bul
lets" (the source of the album's
title, as it contains a refrain of
"sandinista") offers one an out
sider's view of the U.S. as well
as a Latin American sound to
complement such lyrics; the
Clash might well consider the
song as something new and ex
perimental, but what they have
done is just found something
new to imitate, and not some
thing new in itself. Three songs
earlier on the same side, they do
a remake of the 1967 Eddy Grant
song,' The Police on My Back."
By the fact that the song is not
an original, it would be easy to
say that they are being im
itative here too. Because the
sound that they are working

with is, however, one far more
familiar to them, they manage
to revitalize the song and to give
it an energy level greater than
that of even the original version.
Indeed, what seems to have
been forgotten on Sandinista is
rock-and-roll itself. "Police on
My Back" is one of the few
songs in which Jones bothers to
play lead guitar, two of the oth
ers being "Up in Heaven" and
"Somebody Got Murdered".
"Up in Heaven" appears to be a
sequel to the early Clash clas
sic, "London's Burning," and
stands out as the album's finest
cut. After one of the only
stretches on the album in which
one can hear all four members
playing at the same time, Jones
softly begins his vocal work
"the towers of London, those
crumbling blocks, reality es
tates that the heros got, and eve
ry hour's marked by the chime
of a clock" - and suddenly one's
thinking how nirvanic it would
be if the Clash would always be
so English and if all 36 songs
worked like this one does.
Instead, however, one gets a
series of reggae songs which
when put together wouldn't
make for an even trade with last
year's "Armagideon Time."
One gets a gospel number called
"The Sound of Sinners" in which
Strummer slurs "after all this
time, to believe in Jesus, after
all those drugs, I thought I was
him.'' On the sixth side, one gets
two songs, "Silicone on Sap
phire" and "Version Pardner,"
which are only slightly different
versions of earlier songs on the
album ("Washington Bullets"
and "Junco Partner," respec
tively).
Finally, on the next-to-last
cut of the album, the two young
sons of contributing keyboardist
Mickey Gallagher sing the early
Clash song, "Career Op
portunities." One could easily
take the song to be a mere time
filler, but it seems to carry with
it a much larger meaning than
just that. As one listens to the in
nocent, not-yet-deepened voices
of the two youngsters singing
the line "career opportunities",
the ones that never knock," it
becomes clear that such op
portunities have finally knocked
for the Clash, and thus they have
outgrown a song like this one.
Everyone from the "high
priests of the expense account"
to the critics at Melody Maker
have decided that the Clash are
no longer a "garage band," and
that it is time for them to do
more than just to rock-and-roll.
The unfortunate result is an
album like Sandinista, which
ultimately leaves one with the
question of why, since the Clash
have conquered the kingdom of
rock-and-roll, should they not
just live in it? Forget "revolu
tion rock, let's have garageland
forever!
