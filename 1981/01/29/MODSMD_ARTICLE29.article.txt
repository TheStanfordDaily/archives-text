Hometowns greet former hostages
The freed U.S. hostages started returning to their
hometowns yesterday, to the friendliness and familiar
ity of small-town America and to the people they grew
up with. There were miles of yellow ribbons, hundreds
of "Welcome" signs and even some apple pie from
neighbors.
"This is the real homecoming day, coming back to
your home neighborhood," Bruce Laingen told friends
who crowded his front lawn in Bethesda, Md. "This
sharing is a celebration of the feeling that this is the
real end of the episode."
Laingen, who was charge d'affaires at the U.S. em
bassy in Tehran, then stepped up to an oak tree and tore
off the yellow ribbon that had been tied there by his wife
in November 1979. Mrs. Laingen's action was copied
across the country and yellow ribbons became the sym
bols of hope for the hostages' release.
The picture of life for the 52 Americans during 14 Vz
months in Iran became clearer, meanwhile, as some of
them gave details of their treatment — treatment that
apparently varied widely and included beatings for
some. The former hostages tried to sort out their feel
ings.
"I want to explore in my own mind what I think must
have gone wrong . . . Lessons must be learned from this
experience," said Moorhead Kennedy Jr. as he walked
through his house in Washington, D.C., pausing to touch
familiar items.
Former hostage Michael Metrinko of Olyphant, Pa.,
told a cheering crowd in front of the Lackawanna Coun
ty Court House: "If it helped anyone at all to realize
what freedom means, I think it was worth it."
Massive foreign aid cuts proposed
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's budget di
rector has proposed massive cutbacks in foreign aid, in
cluding immediate U.S. withdrawal from UNESCO, a
25 percent reduction in the Peace Corps, and cancella
tion of a $1.6 billion pledge of help for the world's
poorest countries, it was learned yesterday.
The pullout from the United Nations Education, Sci
entific and Cultural Organization — at a savings of $87
million in U.S. dues — was included as a budget-cutting
option even though the United States is legally ob
ligated to pay the money.
Withdrawal from UNESCO could be justified be
cause of its "pro-PLO (Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion) policies and its support for measures limiting the
free flow of informtion," said the plan circulated by
David Stockman, director of the Office of Management
and Budget.
"Savings would not occur until 1983 if legal
withdrawal procedures were followed," the plan said.
"Withdrawal . . . and not paying the 1981 and 1982
assessments might result in legal action in the World
Court."
The plan, a copy of which was obtained by the Los An

geles Times, also contemplates eventual elimination of
U.S. contributions to development banks for Africa,
Asia and Latin America as well as a phase-out of a half
billion-dollar annual overseas food aid program.
The proposed cuts would trim federal spending $726
million below the budget for fiscal years 1981-82 that
was submitted by President Jimmy Carter before he
left office. By 1985, however, the reductions would
amount to $2.9 billion and more billions would be saved
in the future if the plan should be accepted by Reagan
and Congress.
Reagan may cut food stamps
Washington — Federal food stamp assistance for
about 22 million low-income Americans would be cut
about a fourth under a plan prepared for President Rea
gan s budget director.
Reductions of about $3.8 billion over the next two
years are recommended in the proposal, an example of
the ways the administration is now moving to make
promised cuts in federal spending.
According to a White House source, the food stamp
reduction proposal was drafted by Robert Carlson,
former welfare official in Reagan's California cabinet,
working under the domestic policy council staff headed
by Martin Anderson. The source said this plan has not
been adopted by the president and that other ap
proaches are being considered.
The incoming Office of Management and Budget di
rector, David Stockman, and other administration of
ficials have indicated the food stamp program would be
one of the first places where budget savings will be
sought.
Food stamp supporters in Congress already are gear
ing up for battle over the probable blitz on the program,
which is to be reauthorized this year as part of a general
farm bill.
Heavy snows blanket Sierras
Los Angeles — A powerful Pacific storm pumped
high winds across California yesterday, ladling mounds
of overdue snow on High Sierra winter resorts, dump
ing rain on thirsty lowlands and apparently causing a
fatal plane crash.
The National Weather Service predicted another
storm could reach the state by this afternoon.
In Newhall, 30 miles north of Los Angeles, a twin-en
gine courier plane carrying bank checks crashed short
ly after taking off in the teeth of gale-force winds short
ly after midnight, killing its pilot and a passenger, au
thorities said.
Winds from the storm, the second to hit the state in a
week, reached 70 mph as it lashed the San Francisco
Bay area and tore trees out of the ground in the Valen
cia-Newhall area, as well as power lines in West Los
Angeles, where 44,000 customers of the city Depart
ment of Water and Power lost electrical service brief
ly.

The snowfall also increased vital water supplies in
the Sierra, but Bill Clark, deputy chief of flood opera
tions for the state Department of Water Resources,
said more was needed to quench the drought.
Poles threaten nationwide strike
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's independent trade union
Solidarity yesterday threatened to call a nationwide
general strike unless agreement is reached with the
government on a wide range of disputed issues.
The threat of a general strike, which will be preceded
by a one-hour "warning strike" next TuesHp.y, w?<?
partly intended to restore cohesion and unity to Solidar
ity's own ranks. Over the last few days, local union
branches have increasingly resorted to wildcat strikes
in order to express grievances against the communist
authorities.
Solidarity's national commission, during a meeting
in Gdansk, called for an end to the uncoordinated local
strikes, which continued yesterday in several parts of
the country. Workers in hundreds of factories are pro
testing the government's alleged failure to implement
agreements signed with strikers last summer along the
Baltic Coast and in the mining region of Silesia.
In a statement released at the end of yesterday's ses
sion, the commission appealed to the government to
make use of the strike moratorium to start detailed ne
gotiations.
Market edges lower
The stock market edged lower yesterday, deflating a
one-session rally, as investors turned cautious amid
mixed economic signals.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which
gained 10.58 points on Tuesday, dropped 6.91 to 942.58.
Energy issues, which helped fuel Tuesday's short
lived rally, turned lower as the Reagan administration
issued its long-awaited order lifting controls on
domestic oil prices.
Today's weather
Scattered showers likely at times through today.
Partly cloudy today and tomorrow. Lows in the 30s to
low 40s tonight. Highs in the 50s. Northwest winds 10 to
20 mph.
