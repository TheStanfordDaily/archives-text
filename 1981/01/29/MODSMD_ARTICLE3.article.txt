# Reagan deregulates gas industry
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — President
Ronald Reagan yesterday re
moved the remaining price con
trols on gasoline, propane and
U.S.-produced crude oil. in what
aides called a first step in a his
promised campaign to "de
regulate America."
Reagan's decision, giving the
oil industry control over
gasoline prices and distribution
for the first time in a decade,
could add between six and 12
cents a gallon to the price of
gasoline, moving ahead an in
crease that would otherwise
have occurred by this fall when
price controls were to lapse au
tomatically.
The lifting of the network of
petroleum regulations permits

refiners and gasoline retailers
to charge whatever they choose
for their products, and some
service station operators may
test the market with sharp in
creases. But most energy ex
perts in and out of government
predicted that the ample cur
rent stocks of gasoline and other
petroleum products will prevent
a runaway escalation of fuel
prices
Energy Secretary James Ed
wards, who announced Rea
gan's action at a crowded press
conference yesterday, pre
dicted that gasoline prices
would rise by three to five cents
a gallon, or less than half the
potential increase permitted by
the decontrol action. Competi
tion among retailers would pre-

vent them from imposing the
full increase, Edwards in
dicated.
'(iood for America'
Decontrol will be "good for
America," Edwards said. Rea
gan "promised to deregulate
America. This is a step in that
direction," the energy secre
tary said.
Some congressional Demo
crats warned that removal of
price controls on domestically
produced crude oil would leave
the United States even more
vulnerable to further price in
creases by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Coun
tries. since their price will now
be the standard for all U.S.
production
"I intend to take whatever

steps are available in the Senate
to see that this tragedy does not
befall the American people,"
said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum
(D-Ohio) a leader of the Sen
ate's depleted corps of liberals
who favor energy regulation.
OPEC prices now average $38
a barrel, and the price controls,
which covered about 15 percent
of U.S.-produced crude oil prior
to Reagan's order, kept the av
erage domestic price about $3 to
$4 a barrel less than the world
figure.
Among other possibilities, de
control critics fear that oil
shipments from the Mideast
could fall and oil prices rise if
the war between Iran and Iraq
causes further damage to their
petroleum facilities.
