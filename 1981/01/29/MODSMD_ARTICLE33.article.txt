# Haig: halt int'l terrorism
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” Secretary of
State Alexander Haig Jr., de
claring that countering interna
tional terrorism would replace
human rights as an overriding
national security preoccupation
for the United States, yesterday
categorically ruled out the supp
ly of any U.S. military equip
ment to Iran.
In spelling out foreign policy
priorities for the incoming Rea
gan administration, Haig put
both Iran and the Soviet Union
in the category of states that
foster and encourage terrorism.
He made any arms control nego
tations with the Soviets cont
ingent upon their behavior
elsewhere.
Addressing his first news con
ference as secretary and speak
ing only a day after the nation's
captial celebrated the return of
the freed Iranian hostages, Haig
left no doubt that the countering
of future similar acts of ter
rorism had assumed a top
priority for the administration.
Haig, Vice President George
Bush and other members of the
Special Coordinating Commit
tee of the National Security
Council met for more than an
hour Monday with President
Ronald Reagan to discuss the
ability of the United States to re
spond to terrorism here and ov
erseas, administration officials
said.

Meanwhile, Secretary of De
fense Caspar Weinberger told
the Senate Armed Services
Committee yesterday that the
United States was developing
"some forces that could re
spond immediately" to a future
act of terrorism here or abroad.
"We're well on the way to re
alizing our goal," Weinberger
said.
Reagan welcomed the freed
hostages to the White House
Tuesday with a general warning
that the United States would re
spond with "swift and effective
retribution" for future acts of
terrorism against American
citizens.
Reagan's warning was "con
sciously ambiguous," Haig said
yesterday, and he refused to
spell out what specific steps the
president had in mind. But he
added: "Any terrorist govern
ment or terrorist movement
that contemplates such actions I
think knows clearly what we are
speaking of."
Replying to a later question,
Haig was more specific about
the Soviet actions on which the
new administration would
focus. Referring to "Soviet ac
tivity in terms of training, fund
ing, equipping . . . international
terrorism," he declared that
"international terrorism will
take the place of human rights
in our concern, because it is the
ultimate abuse of human

rights."
Human rights was an early
and highly publicized preoc
cupation of Jimmy Carter's
presidency. Haig said that he in
tended to integrate that concern
into day-to-day policymaking
and no longer let a separate hu
man rights bureau at the State
Department "distort" U.S. for
eign policy.
"The greatest problem to me
in the human rights area today
is the area of rampant interna
tional terrorism on both sides of
the Iron Curtain," Haig said. He
added that the Soviets "are in
volved in conscious policies
(and) programs . . . which
foster, support and expand this
activity, which is hemorrhaging
in many respects throughout the
world today."
The Los Angeles Times re
ported yesterday that the ad
ministration was seriously con
sidering blocking military sup
plies to Iran on the ground that it
supported international ter
rorism. Haig has now made
such a prohitition the declared
policy of the United States.
"Let me state categorically
today," Haig announced at the
outset of his 45-minute session
with reporters, "there will be no
military equipment provided to
the government of Iran either
under earlier obligations in con
tractual arrangements or as
yet-unstated requests."
