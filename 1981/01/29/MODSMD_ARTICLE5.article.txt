At 5:15 a.m. on a weekday morning at Stanford, just as
the last few lights are flicked off in the dorms by late
studiers. the writers of great papers and crammers for
midterms, a few other lights are being flicked on. Not long
after 5:30 a.m.. members of the Stanford women'screw
team will beon the waters for a few hours' practice, and at
least a few others will be at the tennis courts, in the
swimming pool or. like University President Donald
Kennedy, on their way up to the Dish for a run.
This scene, which as much as anything reflects the mix
of athletics and academics at this place, is of course not
unique to Stanford, but it is fair to say that the University
combines overall excellence in the two fields better than
just about any other school in the country. Stanford sends
both Rhodes scholars to Oxford and gold medalists to the
Olympics, and by all accounts means to keep doing so.
Today's issue of the Stanford Daily Magazine takes a
look at the reasons for this excellence and gives some
indepth coverage of a few other important issues on
campus.
This edition of the magazine is the next to last issue of
Editor Ron Lillejord's volume. On behalf of the Daily
staff, as we head into a new volume, we would like to take
this opportunity to thank Ron for his leadership and his
patience, and for guiding the Daily staff through a
challenging volume.
Whether you areoff to class or out for a run, wehopeyou
enjoy this issue of the Daily.
