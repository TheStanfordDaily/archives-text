ing — they attract attention
without demanding it.
The Athletic Department
building on Galvez Street is one
of the edifices adorned by a red
roof. This, too, is fitting, tor
most of Stanford's 24 varsity
sports share the excellence that
the school's academic reputa
tion enjoys.
In fact, it would not be hyper
bolic to state that Stanford Uni
versity features the finest com
bination of academic and athlet
ic prowess of any major college
in the nation.
Consider schools known for
their outstanding academic pro
grams: the Ivy League institu
tions, Amherst, and North
western, among others. None of
them fields as many winning
athletic teams as Stanford does.
Consider schools with strong
athletic heritages: USC, UCLA,
and any number of schools from
powerful conferences like the
Big-10. Big Eight, Southeastern,
or Atlantic Coast. None of them
approaches Stanford's scholas
tic level for athletes, as proven
by the recent scandals in the Pa
cific-10 Conference and at other
universities.
Some colleges exist that boast
a sound academic curriculum
and one or two successful athlet
ic teams. Duke and
Georgetown, for example, have
excellent basketball squads.
The rest of their athletic teams,
however, are hardly as notable.
Meanwhile, the list of athletic
successes at Stanford extends
as long as its list of dist
inguished alumni — and is just
as diverse. Indian and Cardinal
teams have won 23 NCAA cham
pionships, sixth best in the na
tion, and 98 Stanford athletes
have captured individual NCAA
crowns in swimming, tennis,
track and field, and golf.
And the victories have not oc
curred only on the playing
fields. Recent studies revealed

that 90 percent of all male ath
letes and 91 percent of football
players graduate from Stanford
within five years. The per
centages are virtually the same
for female athletes. In addition,
85 percent of all athlptps pvpn.
luaiiy enter graduate school.
Both Michigan (27) and Yale
(25) have amassed more NCAA
team titles than Stanford. Yet
Michigan has a significantly
higher enrollment than Stan
ford. and its academic stan
dards. though impressive, can
not quite match Stanford's. As
for Yale, many of its non-cham
pionship teams are of Division
II — that is, lesser — quality.
Also, the Bulldogs compete in
an athletic conference (the Ivy
League) that ranks far below
the quality of other conferences.
This is not to say that Stan
ford's athletic-academic mix
ture is an immaculate one.
Negative aspects are evident:
the deficit of more than $1 mil
lion that the Athletic Depart
ment incurred last fiscal year,
the men's basketball team's in
ability to finish with a winning
season, and the isolated but
well-known instances of ath
letes failing in the classroom or
creating havoc on the campus.
"We're not perfect," Athletic
Director Andy Geiger admitted.
These flaws, however, de
tract little from the Univer
sity's unmatched blend of the in
tellectual and the physical.
What goes most toward creating
this blend is Stanford's str
ingent admissions policies.
"It almost sounds like a
platitude, but it's still the truth:
we just don't admit people that
can't do college-level work,"
said John Harbaugh, a geology
professor who serves as the fac
ulty representative to the Ath
letic Department, and is a vot
ing delegate at Pac-10 and
NCAA meetings.
By contrast, many NCAA
schools will automatically ad
mit students who compiled a 2.0
grade-point average in high
school. Harbaugii amusedly ob
served that at the NCAA con
vention earlier this month, a
motion to lift the minimum

GPA to 2.2 failed.
University cuaches and ol
ficials constantly emphasize
that the school's challenging
academics attracts rather than
discourages potential student
" — J — - 1
come complement.
"Th"e key to our success is our
using the University's
academics as an asset rather
than a hurdle," Geiger said.
"Intelligence and athletic prow
ess are good partners." And
Dick Dißiaso, head coach of the
men's basketball team, could
say even after forward Orlando
Ward was recently declared in
eligible due to academic prob
lems, "That (the University's
higher scholastic standards) is
what makes us great."
These high standards, accord
ing to Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, aren't bent for high
school athletes applying to Stan
ford. Hargadon asserted that
the admission process is largely
the same for a highly recruited
athlete as for a "normal" high
school senior. "They must com
plete the same application re
quirements, pay the same ap
plication fee. and so forth, as
any other applicant. We make
no exceptions in this regard,"
he said.
The only exceptions made are
necessary ones. Because some
sports exist for both men and
women where a national "letter
of intent" to attend a college
must be signed in early Febru
ary or March, the applications
of some student-athletes are de
cided upon early enough to meet
those deadlines.
In addition, if an applicant is a
particularly sought-after ath
lete. his or her would-be coach
informs Hargadon of that fact in
writing. "That is a factor we
take into consideration," he
said. "It does not mean, as I am
sure the coaches will tell you,
that simply because a student is
a highly desired athlete that
that student will be offered ad
mission." This same process oc
curs, Hargadon added, with tal
ented art and music students.
One might expect that the


John Harbaugh


Andy Geiger

coaches put considerable pres
sure on the Admissions Office to
accept an outstanding athlete,
but Hargadon insisted that none
of this occurs.
"They (the coaches) express
strong interest. They express
keen disappointment In that re
gard they are not unlike hun
dreds of others we hear from in
a given year. They have a tough
job. and were I in their position,
I'd be inclined to express both
strong interest and keen disap
pointment. too." the dean said.
Once the student-athletes are
accepted to Stanford, they re
ceive the same treatment as any
other student. "We generally
try not to treat students individ
ually by class, and we're less
likely to do that with athletes,
for the simple reason that other
schools do." said James Lyons,
dean of student affairs.
True, many teams eat at a
special "training table." but
only during their seasons. Also,
unlike many universities, Stan
ford has no dormitories re
served for athletes only.
To students who pay attention

to such matters, it may appear
that a preponderance of athletes
surface in classes affectionate
ly designated by the student
body as "micks." It's a fact that
many athletes don't shy away
from the easier courses, but it
would be ridiculous to say that
these courses are attended by
athletes only.
Geiger adamantly objects to
any academic allowances made
for athletes, such as class lists
informing them of easy courses
to be taken during the season, or
special tutors — all furnished
for them by the Athletic Depart
ment. "I'm opposed to this de
partment establishing an
academic counseling arm," he
said emphatically.
"I think we ask a great deal of
the student-athletes at Stanford
— I don't think we pull the wool
over anybody's eyes with that, "
Geiger added. "If you're going
to do both, we're asking for an
extraordinary commitment."
A sensitive coach can help the
student-athlete accept this com
mitment. "Good coaches are
more than coaches — they're

mentors, so they'll pay atten
tion to the whole person," Lyons
said.
One man who understands the
relationship a Stanford coach
ought to have with his players is
Paul Wiggin, head of the foot
ball team. As the head coach of
the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs,
Wiggin was tremendously ad
mired and respected by his
players, despite the fact that
they persisted in losing games.
This past fall, Wiggin's popu
larity spread to the Cardinal
football players, whom he tried
to regard as what they really
were — young men at college.
With professional players,
Wiggin said late last August,
"you deal on the business level.
You don't spend a lot of time
dealing in staff meetings with,
Why is that kid hanging his
head?' " Yet in coaching college
athletes, especially freshmen,
Wiggin feels that "you're in
more of a parent role ... the
conversations I have had with
college kids are in more of a pa
rent-child role — helping a
young man make the transition

in the first phase of his life away
from home."
Though Geiger correctly
says, "When we're at the 50-
yard line, we're not trading
transcripts," the influence of
academic and student life fol
lows the players to a degree
even when they take the field.
Unlike conditions at other
schools, there is more to life at
Stanford than winning athletic
teams. "When we have a team
that loses a lot. do people get up
set? No, I don't think so," Lyons
said.
Stanford's academic em
phasis probably plays the
greatest role in shaping this re
laxed attitude. It certainly af
fects the thinking of the people
who inhabit the Athletic Depart
ment.
''This (Stanford's
academics) makes our com
petitive posture somewhat
problematical. Perhaps our ex
pectations aren't always as high
as other schools'," Geiger said.
"Winning beyond a certain point
becomes an outstanding
achievement."

Also, the University's scho
lastics definitely make recruit
ing more difficult.
"They (Stanford coaches)
have to explain to students they
are recruiting why it is that
Stanford, sometimes alone
among the schools recruiting
that student, requires they take
tests and complete application
forms, and to have to do all of
that without knowing whether
they will ultimately gain ad
mission," Hargadon said.
"They have to recruit against
coaches who can 'admit' a pros
pect on the spot," he continued.
"They have to recruit against
coaches who will not hesitate to
use our standards against us, at
tempting to convince even the
most able student-athlete that
he or she could not possibly suc
ceed both academically and ath
letically at Stanford.
"In sum, they have to recruit
far more selectively than most
of the coaches against whom
they will compete, and the
margin of error (when it comes
to evaluating talent and decid
ing whom to spend time recruit
ing) is therefore much
smaller."
This is not to say that Stan
ford's athletic administration
conside r s academics a hin
drance. To do so would be a cop
out. for before trying to succeed
in a highly competitive con
ference. they must accept the
conditions they have to work
with at the University. "It's un
fortunate to use academics as
an excuse for failure." Geiger
said
Fortunately for Geiger and

his minions, they don't often
have to explain failures. How
ever. as the athletic director
said himself, the department is
not "perfect." and problems do
exist.
First, there is the $1,075,000
deficit the department suffered
during the 1979-80 fiscal year.
Despite all that red ink, caused
by decreased attendance at 1979
football games and only one na
tional television appearance
that vear. the department made

no major cuts in this year's
budget — thus revealing the con
siderable importance placed on
athletics at Stanford.
Obviously, maintaining a top
flight athletic program at a top
ranked university isn't easy.
"It's a very hard time for us,
though I'm sure other schools
would tell you that," Geiger
said.
The existence of sports that
bring in few game-related rev
enues. such as field hockey, vol-

leyball, or wrestling, depends
on the success of the "larger,"
money-making sports like foot
ball and basketball.
"We do not make judgments
on the basis of revenue prod
uction. On the other hand, the
only way to keep certain pro
grams is through revenue gen
eration," Geiger said.
The "Big Game Jog-a-thon"
was just one of the first of the
ploys used by the Athletic De
partment to help combat the

budget problem.
Another dilemma, at least in
the eyes of basketball followers,
is Stanford's lack of success in
that sport. The Cardinals have
not enjoyed a winning season
since 1972-73. when they finished
14-11 under then-head coach
Howie Dallmar. And since he
has been the head man. Dißiaso
has endured five consecutive
losing years — and in this, his
sixth season, the Cards have lost

10 of 16 contests.
Both Geiger and Dißiaso de
fended the basketball team by
saying that today's better teams
are generally the same teams
that have been at or near the top
for years. "Change a few names
in there, and things look like
they do now," Dißiaso said.
"Changing the pecking order is
a very difficult thing to do, and
we have had a long tradition of
ordinary basketball," Geiger
echoed.
Dißiaso pointed out that suc
cess can be defined in either of
two ways — by a winning record
overall or a winning record in
conference games — and that it
is not so easy to settle upon one
or the other.
The expansion of the con
ference from eight to 10 teams
increased the number of league
games from 14 to 18. Dißiaso
said, "Maybe if we didn't have
four more league games, we
could schedule four more games
against Division II teams, so
we'd be 15-11 instead of 11-15.
Are we more successful?"
Many coaches have the lux
ury of recruiting close to their
own university — UCLA and
USC teams, for example, are
almost totally composed of
players from the Los Angeles

area. But because relatively
few players exist who are good
enough for Pac-10 basketball
and smart enough for Stanford,
Dißiaso has to recruit national
ly and struggle to get many
players away from home.
The team has improved sig
nificantly with the arrival of
this year's four freshmen, but
Geiger said, "We need to con
tinue to have recruiting vic
tories."
This same problem is shared
to an extent by the other sports.
Many of Stanford's greater ath
letic triumphs are achieved in
"country club" sports such as
tennis. Meanwhile, grimier
sports like football remain com
petent but experience lesser
glories. With its famous tradi
tion for having a powerful of
fense, the football team has lit
tle trouble luring talented backs
and receivers to the Farm, but
acquiring equally adept de
fensive players remains trou
blesome. "Maybe it's just as
hard to build a tradition on
(football) defense as in basket
ball," theorized Dißiaso.
Finally, some students would
complain that though athletes
here perform handsomely in
their sport, they behave incor
rigibly when away from it — not

the way a Stanford student, or
student-athlete, should act,
Tales of athletes maintaining
their muscle tone by wreaking
havoc in dormitories and during
parties are popular subjects for
gossip.
"I suspect there's some truth
to that," Lyons said of damage
and destruction caused by ath
letes. However, he added that
just because a few big people
cause a nuisance, one should not
fall victim to the stereotype
which dictates that all big peo
ple are, in his words, "football
player types." And if they are
football players, Lyons said
their behavior shouldn't be gen
eralized to include all football
players.
Otherwise, there isn't much
to find fault with in Stanford's
athletic program. The Univer
sity doesn't brag about its syn
thesis of athletic and academic
competence, but instead quietly
glows in it. Last Sunday's Super
Bowl, for example, gave Stan
ford students and alumni every
where a chance to brighten. "I
have nothing to do with Jim
Plunkett, but it makes me feel
good that he's a Stanford gradu
ate." said Lyons. Overall, the
Athletic Department can be in
dicted only for its successes.

said, "Maybe if we didn't have
four more league games, we
could schedule four more games
against Division II teams, so
we'd be 15-11 instead of 11-15.
Are we more successful?"
Many coaches have the lux
ury of recruiting close to their
own university — UCLA and
USC teams, for example, are
almost totally composed of
players from the Los Angeles

area. But because relatively
few players exist who are good
enough for Pac-10 basketball
and smart enough for Stanford,
Dißiaso has to recruit national
ly and struggle to get many
players away from home.
The team has improved sig
nificantly with the arrival of
this year's four freshmen, but
Geiger said, "We need to con
tinue to have recruiting vic
tories."
This same problem is shared
to an extent by the other sports.
Many of Stanford's greater ath
letic triumphs are achieved in
"country club" sports such as
tennis. Meanwhile, grimier
sports like football remain com
petent but experience lesser
glories. With its famous tradi
tion for having a powerful of
fense, the football team has lit
tle trouble luring talented backs
and receivers to the Farm, but
acquiring equally adept de
fensive players remains trou
blesome. "Maybe it's just as
hard to build a tradition on
(football) defense as in basket
ball," theorized Dißiaso.
Finally, some students would
complain that though athletes
here perform handsomely in
their sport, they behave incor
rigibly when away from it — not

the way a Stanford student, or
student-athlete, should act,
Tales of athletes maintaining
their muscle tone by wreaking
havoc in dormitories and during
parties are popular subjects for
gossip.
"I suspect there's some truth
to that," Lyons said of damage
and destruction caused by ath
letes. However, he added that
just because a few big people
cause a nuisance, one should not
fall victim to the stereotype
which dictates that all big peo
ple are, in his words, "football
player types." And if they are
football players, Lyons said
their behavior shouldn't be gen
eralized to include all football
players.
Otherwise, there isn't much
to find fault with in Stanford's
athletic program. The Univer
sity doesn't brag about its syn
thesis of athletic and academic
competence, but instead quietly
glows in it. Last Sunday's Super
Bowl, for example, gave Stan
ford students and alumni every
where a chance to brighten. "I
have nothing to do with Jim
Plunkett, but it makes me feel
good that he's a Stanford gradu
ate." said Lyons. Overall, the
Athletic Department can be in
dicted only for its successes.

ing — they attract attention
without demanding it.
The Athletic Department
building on Galvez Street is one
of the edifices adorned by a red
roof. This, too, is fitting, tor
most of Stanford's 24 varsity
sports share the excellence that
the school's academic reputa
tion enjoys.
In fact, it would not be hyper
bolic to state that Stanford Uni
versity features the finest com
bination of academic and athlet
ic prowess of any major college
in the nation.
Consider schools known for
their outstanding academic pro
grams: the Ivy League institu
tions, Amherst, and North
western, among others. None of
them fields as many winning
athletic teams as Stanford does.
Consider schools with strong
athletic heritages: USC, UCLA,
and any number of schools from
powerful conferences like the
Big-10. Big Eight, Southeastern,
or Atlantic Coast. None of them
approaches Stanford's scholas
tic level for athletes, as proven
by the recent scandals in the Pa
cific-10 Conference and at other
universities.
Some colleges exist that boast
a sound academic curriculum
and one or two successful athlet
ic teams. Duke and
Georgetown, for example, have
excellent basketball squads.
The rest of their athletic teams,
however, are hardly as notable.
Meanwhile, the list of athletic
successes at Stanford extends
as long as its list of dist
inguished alumni — and is just
as diverse. Indian and Cardinal
teams have won 23 NCAA cham
pionships, sixth best in the na
tion, and 98 Stanford athletes
have captured individual NCAA
crowns in swimming, tennis,
track and field, and golf.
And the victories have not oc
curred only on the playing
fields. Recent studies revealed

that 90 percent of all male ath
letes and 91 percent of football
players graduate from Stanford
within five years. The per
centages are virtually the same
for female athletes. In addition,
85 percent of all athlptps pvpn.
luaiiy enter graduate school.
Both Michigan (27) and Yale
(25) have amassed more NCAA
team titles than Stanford. Yet
Michigan has a significantly
higher enrollment than Stan
ford. and its academic stan
dards. though impressive, can
not quite match Stanford's. As
for Yale, many of its non-cham
pionship teams are of Division
II — that is, lesser — quality.
Also, the Bulldogs compete in
an athletic conference (the Ivy
League) that ranks far below
the quality of other conferences.
This is not to say that Stan
ford's athletic-academic mix
ture is an immaculate one.
Negative aspects are evident:
the deficit of more than $1 mil
lion that the Athletic Depart
ment incurred last fiscal year,
the men's basketball team's in
ability to finish with a winning
season, and the isolated but
well-known instances of ath
letes failing in the classroom or
creating havoc on the campus.
"We're not perfect," Athletic
Director Andy Geiger admitted.
These flaws, however, de
tract little from the Univer
sity's unmatched blend of the in
tellectual and the physical.
What goes most toward creating
this blend is Stanford's str
ingent admissions policies.
"It almost sounds like a
platitude, but it's still the truth:
we just don't admit people that
can't do college-level work,"
said John Harbaugh, a geology
professor who serves as the fac
ulty representative to the Ath
letic Department, and is a vot
ing delegate at Pac-10 and
NCAA meetings.
By contrast, many NCAA
schools will automatically ad
mit students who compiled a 2.0
grade-point average in high
school. Harbaugii amusedly ob
served that at the NCAA con
vention earlier this month, a
motion to lift the minimum

GPA to 2.2 failed.
University cuaches and ol
ficials constantly emphasize
that the school's challenging
academics attracts rather than
discourages potential student
" — J — - 1
come complement.
"Th"e key to our success is our
using the University's
academics as an asset rather
than a hurdle," Geiger said.
"Intelligence and athletic prow
ess are good partners." And
Dick Dißiaso, head coach of the
men's basketball team, could
say even after forward Orlando
Ward was recently declared in
eligible due to academic prob
lems, "That (the University's
higher scholastic standards) is
what makes us great."
These high standards, accord
ing to Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, aren't bent for high
school athletes applying to Stan
ford. Hargadon asserted that
the admission process is largely
the same for a highly recruited
athlete as for a "normal" high
school senior. "They must com
plete the same application re
quirements, pay the same ap
plication fee. and so forth, as
any other applicant. We make
no exceptions in this regard,"
he said.
The only exceptions made are
necessary ones. Because some
sports exist for both men and
women where a national "letter
of intent" to attend a college
must be signed in early Febru
ary or March, the applications
of some student-athletes are de
cided upon early enough to meet
those deadlines.
In addition, if an applicant is a
particularly sought-after ath
lete. his or her would-be coach
informs Hargadon of that fact in
writing. "That is a factor we
take into consideration," he
said. "It does not mean, as I am
sure the coaches will tell you,
that simply because a student is
a highly desired athlete that
that student will be offered ad
mission." This same process oc
curs, Hargadon added, with tal
ented art and music students.
One might expect that the


John Harbaugh


Andy Geiger

coaches put considerable pres
sure on the Admissions Office to
accept an outstanding athlete,
but Hargadon insisted that none
of this occurs.
"They (the coaches) express
strong interest. They express
keen disappointment In that re
gard they are not unlike hun
dreds of others we hear from in
a given year. They have a tough
job. and were I in their position,
I'd be inclined to express both
strong interest and keen disap
pointment. too." the dean said.
Once the student-athletes are
accepted to Stanford, they re
ceive the same treatment as any
other student. "We generally
try not to treat students individ
ually by class, and we're less
likely to do that with athletes,
for the simple reason that other
schools do." said James Lyons,
dean of student affairs.
True, many teams eat at a
special "training table." but
only during their seasons. Also,
unlike many universities, Stan
ford has no dormitories re
served for athletes only.
To students who pay attention

to such matters, it may appear
that a preponderance of athletes
surface in classes affectionate
ly designated by the student
body as "micks." It's a fact that
many athletes don't shy away
from the easier courses, but it
would be ridiculous to say that
these courses are attended by
athletes only.
Geiger adamantly objects to
any academic allowances made
for athletes, such as class lists
informing them of easy courses
to be taken during the season, or
special tutors — all furnished
for them by the Athletic Depart
ment. "I'm opposed to this de
partment establishing an
academic counseling arm," he
said emphatically.
"I think we ask a great deal of
the student-athletes at Stanford
— I don't think we pull the wool
over anybody's eyes with that, "
Geiger added. "If you're going
to do both, we're asking for an
extraordinary commitment."
A sensitive coach can help the
student-athlete accept this com
mitment. "Good coaches are
more than coaches — they're

mentors, so they'll pay atten
tion to the whole person," Lyons
said.
One man who understands the
relationship a Stanford coach
ought to have with his players is
Paul Wiggin, head of the foot
ball team. As the head coach of
the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs,
Wiggin was tremendously ad
mired and respected by his
players, despite the fact that
they persisted in losing games.
This past fall, Wiggin's popu
larity spread to the Cardinal
football players, whom he tried
to regard as what they really
were — young men at college.
With professional players,
Wiggin said late last August,
"you deal on the business level.
You don't spend a lot of time
dealing in staff meetings with,
Why is that kid hanging his
head?' " Yet in coaching college
athletes, especially freshmen,
Wiggin feels that "you're in
more of a parent role ... the
conversations I have had with
college kids are in more of a pa
rent-child role — helping a
young man make the transition

in the first phase of his life away
from home."
Though Geiger correctly
says, "When we're at the 50-
yard line, we're not trading
transcripts," the influence of
academic and student life fol
lows the players to a degree
even when they take the field.
Unlike conditions at other
schools, there is more to life at
Stanford than winning athletic
teams. "When we have a team
that loses a lot. do people get up
set? No, I don't think so," Lyons
said.
Stanford's academic em
phasis probably plays the
greatest role in shaping this re
laxed attitude. It certainly af
fects the thinking of the people
who inhabit the Athletic Depart
ment.
''This (Stanford's
academics) makes our com
petitive posture somewhat
problematical. Perhaps our ex
pectations aren't always as high
as other schools'," Geiger said.
"Winning beyond a certain point
becomes an outstanding
achievement."

Also, the University's scho
lastics definitely make recruit
ing more difficult.
"They (Stanford coaches)
have to explain to students they
are recruiting why it is that
Stanford, sometimes alone
among the schools recruiting
that student, requires they take
tests and complete application
forms, and to have to do all of
that without knowing whether
they will ultimately gain ad
mission," Hargadon said.
"They have to recruit against
coaches who can 'admit' a pros
pect on the spot," he continued.
"They have to recruit against
coaches who will not hesitate to
use our standards against us, at
tempting to convince even the
most able student-athlete that
he or she could not possibly suc
ceed both academically and ath
letically at Stanford.
"In sum, they have to recruit
far more selectively than most
of the coaches against whom
they will compete, and the
margin of error (when it comes
to evaluating talent and decid
ing whom to spend time recruit
ing) is therefore much
smaller."
This is not to say that Stan
ford's athletic administration
conside r s academics a hin
drance. To do so would be a cop
out. for before trying to succeed
in a highly competitive con
ference. they must accept the
conditions they have to work
with at the University. "It's un
fortunate to use academics as
an excuse for failure." Geiger
said
Fortunately for Geiger and

his minions, they don't often
have to explain failures. How
ever. as the athletic director
said himself, the department is
not "perfect." and problems do
exist.
First, there is the $1,075,000
deficit the department suffered
during the 1979-80 fiscal year.
Despite all that red ink, caused
by decreased attendance at 1979
football games and only one na
tional television appearance
that vear. the department made

no major cuts in this year's
budget — thus revealing the con
siderable importance placed on
athletics at Stanford.
Obviously, maintaining a top
flight athletic program at a top
ranked university isn't easy.
"It's a very hard time for us,
though I'm sure other schools
would tell you that," Geiger
said.
The existence of sports that
bring in few game-related rev
enues. such as field hockey, vol-

leyball, or wrestling, depends
on the success of the "larger,"
money-making sports like foot
ball and basketball.
"We do not make judgments
on the basis of revenue prod
uction. On the other hand, the
only way to keep certain pro
grams is through revenue gen
eration," Geiger said.
The "Big Game Jog-a-thon"
was just one of the first of the
ploys used by the Athletic De
partment to help combat the

budget problem.
Another dilemma, at least in
the eyes of basketball followers,
is Stanford's lack of success in
that sport. The Cardinals have
not enjoyed a winning season
since 1972-73. when they finished
14-11 under then-head coach
Howie Dallmar. And since he
has been the head man. Dißiaso
has endured five consecutive
losing years — and in this, his
sixth season, the Cards have lost

10 of 16 contests.
Both Geiger and Dißiaso de
fended the basketball team by
saying that today's better teams
are generally the same teams
that have been at or near the top
for years. "Change a few names
in there, and things look like
they do now," Dißiaso said.
"Changing the pecking order is
a very difficult thing to do, and
we have had a long tradition of
ordinary basketball," Geiger
echoed.
Dißiaso pointed out that suc
cess can be defined in either of
two ways — by a winning record
overall or a winning record in
conference games — and that it
is not so easy to settle upon one
or the other.
The expansion of the con
ference from eight to 10 teams
increased the number of league
games from 14 to 18. Dißiaso
said, "Maybe if we didn't have
four more league games, we
could schedule four more games
against Division II teams, so
we'd be 15-11 instead of 11-15.
Are we more successful?"

Fortunately for Geiger and

his minions, they don't often
have to explain failures. How
ever. as the athletic director
said himself, the department is
not "perfect." and problems do
exist.
First, there is the $1,075,000
deficit the department suffered
during the 1979-80 fiscal year.
Despite all that red ink, caused
by decreased attendance at 1979
football games and only one na
tional television appearance
that vear. the department made

no major cuts in this year's
budget — thus revealing the con
siderable importance placed on
athletics at Stanford.
Obviously, maintaining a top
flight athletic program at a top
ranked university isn't easy.
"It's a very hard time for us,
though I'm sure other schools
would tell you that," Geiger
said.
The existence of sports that
bring in few game-related rev
enues. such as field hockey, vol-

leyball, or wrestling, depends
on the success of the "larger,"
money-making sports like foot
ball and basketball.
"We do not make judgments
on the basis of revenue prod
uction. On the other hand, the
only way to keep certain pro
grams is through revenue gen
eration," Geiger said.
The "Big Game Jog-a-thon"
was just one of the first of the
ploys used by the Athletic De
partment to help combat the

budget problem.
Another dilemma, at least in
the eyes of basketball followers,
is Stanford's lack of success in
that sport. The Cardinals have
not enjoyed a winning season
since 1972-73. when they finished
14-11 under then-head coach
Howie Dallmar. And since he
has been the head man. Dißiaso
has endured five consecutive
losing years — and in this, his
sixth season, the Cards have lost

10 of 16 contests.
Both Geiger and Dißiaso de
fended the basketball team by
saying that today's better teams
are generally the same teams
that have been at or near the top
for years. "Change a few names
in there, and things look like
they do now," Dißiaso said.
"Changing the pecking order is
a very difficult thing to do, and
we have had a long tradition of
ordinary basketball," Geiger
echoed.
Dißiaso pointed out that suc
cess can be defined in either of
two ways — by a winning record
overall or a winning record in
conference games — and that it
is not so easy to settle upon one
or the other.
The expansion of the con
ference from eight to 10 teams
increased the number of league
games from 14 to 18. Dißiaso
said, "Maybe if we didn't have
four more league games, we
could schedule four more games
against Division II teams, so
we'd be 15-11 instead of 11-15.
Are we more successful?"
Many coaches have the lux
ury of recruiting close to their
own university — UCLA and
USC teams, for example, are
almost totally composed of
players from the Los Angeles

area. But because relatively
few players exist who are good
enough for Pac-10 basketball
and smart enough for Stanford,
Dißiaso has to recruit national
ly and struggle to get many
players away from home.
The team has improved sig
nificantly with the arrival of
this year's four freshmen, but
Geiger said, "We need to con
tinue to have recruiting vic
tories."
This same problem is shared
to an extent by the other sports.
Many of Stanford's greater ath
letic triumphs are achieved in
"country club" sports such as
tennis. Meanwhile, grimier
sports like football remain com
petent but experience lesser
glories. With its famous tradi
tion for having a powerful of
fense, the football team has lit
tle trouble luring talented backs
and receivers to the Farm, but
acquiring equally adept de
fensive players remains trou
blesome. "Maybe it's just as
hard to build a tradition on
(football) defense as in basket
ball," theorized Dißiaso.
Finally, some students would
complain that though athletes
here perform handsomely in
their sport, they behave incor
rigibly when away from it — not

the way a Stanford student, or
student-athlete, should act,
Tales of athletes maintaining
their muscle tone by wreaking
havoc in dormitories and during
parties are popular subjects for
gossip.
"I suspect there's some truth
to that," Lyons said of damage
and destruction caused by ath
letes. However, he added that
just because a few big people
cause a nuisance, one should not
fall victim to the stereotype
which dictates that all big peo
ple are, in his words, "football
player types." And if they are
football players, Lyons said
their behavior shouldn't be gen
eralized to include all football
players.
Otherwise, there isn't much
to find fault with in Stanford's
athletic program. The Univer
sity doesn't brag about its syn
thesis of athletic and academic
competence, but instead quietly
glows in it. Last Sunday's Super
Bowl, for example, gave Stan
ford students and alumni every
where a chance to brighten. "I
have nothing to do with Jim
Plunkett, but it makes me feel
good that he's a Stanford gradu
ate." said Lyons. Overall, the
Athletic Department can be in
dicted only for its successes.

ing — they attract attention
without demanding it.
The Athletic Department
building on Galvez Street is one
of the edifices adorned by a red
roof. This, too, is fitting, tor
most of Stanford's 24 varsity
sports share the excellence that
the school's academic reputa
tion enjoys.
In fact, it would not be hyper
bolic to state that Stanford Uni
versity features the finest com
bination of academic and athlet
ic prowess of any major college
in the nation.
Consider schools known for
their outstanding academic pro
grams: the Ivy League institu
tions, Amherst, and North
western, among others. None of
them fields as many winning
athletic teams as Stanford does.
Consider schools with strong
athletic heritages: USC, UCLA,
and any number of schools from
powerful conferences like the
Big-10. Big Eight, Southeastern,
or Atlantic Coast. None of them
approaches Stanford's scholas
tic level for athletes, as proven
by the recent scandals in the Pa
cific-10 Conference and at other
universities.
Some colleges exist that boast
a sound academic curriculum
and one or two successful athlet
ic teams. Duke and
Georgetown, for example, have
excellent basketball squads.
The rest of their athletic teams,
however, are hardly as notable.
Meanwhile, the list of athletic
successes at Stanford extends
as long as its list of dist
inguished alumni — and is just
as diverse. Indian and Cardinal
teams have won 23 NCAA cham
pionships, sixth best in the na
tion, and 98 Stanford athletes
have captured individual NCAA
crowns in swimming, tennis,
track and field, and golf.
And the victories have not oc
curred only on the playing
fields. Recent studies revealed

that 90 percent of all male ath
letes and 91 percent of football
players graduate from Stanford
within five years. The per
centages are virtually the same
for female athletes. In addition,
85 percent of all athlptps pvpn.
luaiiy enter graduate school.
Both Michigan (27) and Yale
(25) have amassed more NCAA
team titles than Stanford. Yet
Michigan has a significantly
higher enrollment than Stan
ford. and its academic stan
dards. though impressive, can
not quite match Stanford's. As
for Yale, many of its non-cham
pionship teams are of Division
II — that is, lesser — quality.
Also, the Bulldogs compete in
an athletic conference (the Ivy
League) that ranks far below
the quality of other conferences.
This is not to say that Stan
ford's athletic-academic mix
ture is an immaculate one.
Negative aspects are evident:
the deficit of more than $1 mil
lion that the Athletic Depart
ment incurred last fiscal year,
the men's basketball team's in
ability to finish with a winning
season, and the isolated but
well-known instances of ath
letes failing in the classroom or
creating havoc on the campus.
"We're not perfect," Athletic
Director Andy Geiger admitted.
These flaws, however, de
tract little from the Univer
sity's unmatched blend of the in
tellectual and the physical.
What goes most toward creating
this blend is Stanford's str
ingent admissions policies.
"It almost sounds like a
platitude, but it's still the truth:
we just don't admit people that
can't do college-level work,"
said John Harbaugh, a geology
professor who serves as the fac
ulty representative to the Ath
letic Department, and is a vot
ing delegate at Pac-10 and
NCAA meetings.
By contrast, many NCAA
schools will automatically ad
mit students who compiled a 2.0
grade-point average in high
school. Harbaugii amusedly ob
served that at the NCAA con
vention earlier this month, a
motion to lift the minimum

GPA to 2.2 failed.
University cuaches and ol
ficials constantly emphasize
that the school's challenging
academics attracts rather than
discourages potential student
" — J — - 1
come complement.
"Th"e key to our success is our
using the University's
academics as an asset rather
than a hurdle," Geiger said.
"Intelligence and athletic prow
ess are good partners." And
Dick Dißiaso, head coach of the
men's basketball team, could
say even after forward Orlando
Ward was recently declared in
eligible due to academic prob
lems, "That (the University's
higher scholastic standards) is
what makes us great."
These high standards, accord
ing to Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, aren't bent for high
school athletes applying to Stan
ford. Hargadon asserted that
the admission process is largely
the same for a highly recruited
athlete as for a "normal" high
school senior. "They must com
plete the same application re
quirements, pay the same ap
plication fee. and so forth, as
any other applicant. We make
no exceptions in this regard,"
he said.
The only exceptions made are
necessary ones. Because some
sports exist for both men and
women where a national "letter
of intent" to attend a college
must be signed in early Febru
ary or March, the applications
of some student-athletes are de
cided upon early enough to meet
those deadlines.
In addition, if an applicant is a
particularly sought-after ath
lete. his or her would-be coach
informs Hargadon of that fact in
writing. "That is a factor we
take into consideration," he
said. "It does not mean, as I am
sure the coaches will tell you,
that simply because a student is
a highly desired athlete that
that student will be offered ad
mission." This same process oc
curs, Hargadon added, with tal
ented art and music students.
One might expect that the

coaches put considerable pres
sure on the Admissions Office to
accept an outstanding athlete,
but Hargadon insisted that none
of this occurs.
"They (the coaches) express
strong interest. They express
keen disappointment In that re
gard they are not unlike hun
dreds of others we hear from in
a given year. They have a tough
job. and were I in their position,
I'd be inclined to express both
strong interest and keen disap
pointment. too." the dean said.
Once the student-athletes are
accepted to Stanford, they re
ceive the same treatment as any
other student. "We generally
try not to treat students individ
ually by class, and we're less
likely to do that with athletes,
for the simple reason that other
schools do." said James Lyons,
dean of student affairs.
True, many teams eat at a
special "training table." but
only during their seasons. Also,
unlike many universities, Stan
ford has no dormitories re
served for athletes only.
To students who pay attention

to such matters, it may appear
that a preponderance of athletes
surface in classes affectionate
ly designated by the student
body as "micks." It's a fact that
many athletes don't shy away
from the easier courses, but it
would be ridiculous to say that
these courses are attended by
athletes only.
Geiger adamantly objects to
any academic allowances made
for athletes, such as class lists
informing them of easy courses
to be taken during the season, or
special tutors — all furnished
for them by the Athletic Depart
ment. "I'm opposed to this de
partment establishing an
academic counseling arm," he
said emphatically.
"I think we ask a great deal of
the student-athletes at Stanford
— I don't think we pull the wool
over anybody's eyes with that, "
Geiger added. "If you're going
to do both, we're asking for an
extraordinary commitment."
A sensitive coach can help the
student-athlete accept this com
mitment. "Good coaches are
more than coaches — they're

mentors, so they'll pay atten
tion to the whole person," Lyons
said.
One man who understands the
relationship a Stanford coach
ought to have with his players is
Paul Wiggin, head of the foot
ball team. As the head coach of
the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs,
Wiggin was tremendously ad
mired and respected by his
players, despite the fact that
they persisted in losing games.
This past fall, Wiggin's popu
larity spread to the Cardinal
football players, whom he tried
to regard as what they really
were — young men at college.
With professional players,
Wiggin said late last August,
"you deal on the business level.
You don't spend a lot of time
dealing in staff meetings with,
Why is that kid hanging his
head?' " Yet in coaching college
athletes, especially freshmen,
Wiggin feels that "you're in
more of a parent role ... the
conversations I have had with
college kids are in more of a pa
rent-child role — helping a
young man make the transition

in the first phase of his life away
from home."
Though Geiger correctly
says, "When we're at the 50-
yard line, we're not trading
transcripts," the influence of
academic and student life fol
lows the players to a degree
even when they take the field.
Unlike conditions at other
schools, there is more to life at
Stanford than winning athletic
teams. "When we have a team
that loses a lot. do people get up
set? No, I don't think so," Lyons
said.
Stanford's academic em
phasis probably plays the
greatest role in shaping this re
laxed attitude. It certainly af
fects the thinking of the people
who inhabit the Athletic Depart
ment.
''This (Stanford's
academics) makes our com
petitive posture somewhat
problematical. Perhaps our ex
pectations aren't always as high
as other schools'," Geiger said.
"Winning beyond a certain point
becomes an outstanding
achievement."

Also, the University's scho
lastics definitely make recruit
ing more difficult.
"They (Stanford coaches)
have to explain to students they
are recruiting why it is that
Stanford, sometimes alone
among the schools recruiting
that student, requires they take
tests and complete application
forms, and to have to do all of
that without knowing whether
they will ultimately gain ad
mission," Hargadon said.
"They have to recruit against
coaches who can 'admit' a pros
pect on the spot," he continued.
"They have to recruit against
coaches who will not hesitate to
use our standards against us, at
tempting to convince even the
most able student-athlete that
he or she could not possibly suc
ceed both academically and ath
letically at Stanford.
"In sum, they have to recruit
far more selectively than most
of the coaches against whom
they will compete, and the
margin of error (when it comes
to evaluating talent and decid
ing whom to spend time recruit
ing) is therefore much
smaller."
This is not to say that Stan
ford's athletic administration
conside r s academics a hin
drance. To do so would be a cop
out. for before trying to succeed
in a highly competitive con
ference. they must accept the
conditions they have to work
with at the University. "It's un
fortunate to use academics as
an excuse for failure." Geiger
said
Fortunately for Geiger and

his minions, they don't often
have to explain failures. How
ever. as the athletic director
said himself, the department is
not "perfect." and problems do
exist.
First, there is the $1,075,000

You don't spend a lot of time
dealing in staff meetings with,
Why is that kid hanging his
head?' " Yet in coaching college
athletes, especially freshmen,
Wiggin feels that "you're in
more of a parent role ... the
conversations I have had with
college kids are in more of a pa
rent-child role — helping a
young man make the transition

in the first phase of his life away
from home."
Though Geiger correctly
says, "When we're at the 50-
yard line, we're not trading
transcripts," the influence of
academic and student life fol
lows the players to a degree
even when they take the field.
Unlike conditions at other
schools, there is more to life at
Stanford than winning athletic
teams. "When we have a team
that loses a lot. do people get up
set? No, I don't think so," Lyons
said.
Stanford's academic em
phasis probably plays the
greatest role in shaping this re
laxed attitude. It certainly af
fects the thinking of the people
who inhabit the Athletic Depart
ment.
''This (Stanford's
academics) makes our com
petitive posture somewhat
problematical. Perhaps our ex
pectations aren't always as high
as other schools'," Geiger said.
"Winning beyond a certain point
becomes an outstanding
achievement."

Also, the University's scho
lastics definitely make recruit
ing more difficult.
"They (Stanford coaches)
have to explain to students they
are recruiting why it is that
Stanford, sometimes alone
among the schools recruiting
that student, requires they take
tests and complete application
forms, and to have to do all of
that without knowing whether
they will ultimately gain ad
mission," Hargadon said.
"They have to recruit against
coaches who can 'admit' a pros
pect on the spot," he continued.
"They have to recruit against
coaches who will not hesitate to
use our standards against us, at
tempting to convince even the
most able student-athlete that
he or she could not possibly suc
ceed both academically and ath
letically at Stanford.
"In sum, they have to recruit
far more selectively than most
of the coaches against whom
they will compete, and the
margin of error (when it comes
to evaluating talent and decid
ing whom to spend time recruit
ing) is therefore much
smaller."
This is not to say that Stan
ford's athletic administration
conside r s academics a hin
drance. To do so would be a cop
out. for before trying to succeed
in a highly competitive con
ference. they must accept the
conditions they have to work
with at the University. "It's un
fortunate to use academics as
an excuse for failure." Geiger
said
Fortunately for Geiger and

his minions, they don't often
have to explain failures. How
ever. as the athletic director
said himself, the department is
not "perfect." and problems do
exist.
First, there is the $1,075,000
deficit the department suffered
during the 1979-80 fiscal year.
Despite all that red ink, caused
by decreased attendance at 1979
football games and only one na
tional television appearance
that vear. the department made

no major cuts in this year's
budget — thus revealing the con
siderable importance placed on
athletics at Stanford.
Obviously, maintaining a top
flight athletic program at a top
ranked university isn't easy.
"It's a very hard time for us,
though I'm sure other schools
would tell you that," Geiger
said.
The existence of sports that
bring in few game-related rev
enues. such as field hockey, vol-

leyball, or wrestling, depends
on the success of the "larger,"
money-making sports like foot
ball and basketball.
"We do not make judgments
on the basis of revenue prod
uction. On the other hand, the
only way to keep certain pro
grams is through revenue gen
eration," Geiger said.
The "Big Game Jog-a-thon"
was just one of the first of the
ploys used by the Athletic De
partment to help combat the

budget problem.
Another dilemma, at least in
the eyes of basketball followers,
is Stanford's lack of success in
that sport. The Cardinals have
not enjoyed a winning season
since 1972-73. when they finished
14-11 under then-head coach
Howie Dallmar. And since he
has been the head man. Dißiaso
has endured five consecutive
losing years — and in this, his
sixth season, the Cards have lost

10 of 16 contests.
Both Geiger and Dißiaso de
fended the basketball team by
saying that today's better teams
are generally the same teams
that have been at or near the top
for years. "Change a few names
in there, and things look like
they do now," Dißiaso said.
"Changing the pecking order is
a very difficult thing to do, and
we have had a long tradition of
ordinary basketball," Geiger
echoed.
Dißiaso pointed out that suc
cess can be defined in either of
two ways — by a winning record
overall or a winning record in
conference games — and that it
is not so easy to settle upon one
or the other.
The expansion of the con
ference from eight to 10 teams
increased the number of league
games from 14 to 18. Dißiaso
said, "Maybe if we didn't have
four more league games, we
could schedule four more games
against Division II teams, so
we'd be 15-11 instead of 11-15.
Are we more successful?"
Many coaches have the lux
ury of recruiting close to their
own university — UCLA and
USC teams, for example, are
almost totally composed of
players from the Los Angeles

area. But because relatively
few players exist who are good
enough for Pac-10 basketball
and smart enough for Stanford,
Dißiaso has to recruit national
ly and struggle to get many
players away from home.
The team has improved sig
nificantly with the arrival of
this year's four freshmen, but
Geiger said, "We need to con
tinue to have recruiting vic
tories."
This same problem is shared
to an extent by the other sports.
Many of Stanford's greater ath
letic triumphs are achieved in
"country club" sports such as
tennis. Meanwhile, grimier
sports like football remain com
petent but experience lesser
glories. With its famous tradi
tion for having a powerful of
fense, the football team has lit
tle trouble luring talented backs
and receivers to the Farm, but
acquiring equally adept de
fensive players remains trou
blesome. "Maybe it's just as
hard to build a tradition on
(football) defense as in basket
ball," theorized Dißiaso.
Finally, some students would
complain that though athletes
here perform handsomely in
their sport, they behave incor
rigibly when away from it — not

the way a Stanford student, or
student-athlete, should act,
Tales of athletes maintaining
their muscle tone by wreaking
havoc in dormitories and during
parties are popular subjects for
gossip.
"I suspect there's some truth
to that," Lyons said of damage
and destruction caused by ath
letes. However, he added that
just because a few big people
cause a nuisance, one should not
fall victim to the stereotype
which dictates that all big peo
ple are, in his words, "football
player types." And if they are
football players, Lyons said
their behavior shouldn't be gen
eralized to include all football
players.
Otherwise, there isn't much
to find fault with in Stanford's
athletic program. The Univer
sity doesn't brag about its syn
thesis of athletic and academic
competence, but instead quietly
glows in it. Last Sunday's Super
Bowl, for example, gave Stan
ford students and alumni every
where a chance to brighten. "I
have nothing to do with Jim
Plunkett, but it makes me feel
good that he's a Stanford gradu
ate." said Lyons. Overall, the
Athletic Department can be in
dicted only for its successes.

ing — they attract attention

The Athletic Department
building on Galvez Street is one
of the edifices adorned by a red
roof. This, too, is fitting, tor
most of Stanford's 24 varsity
sports share the excellence that
the school's academic reputa
tion enjoys.
In fact, it would not be hyper
bolic to state that Stanford Uni
versity features the finest com
bination of academic and athlet
ic prowess of any major college
in the nation.
Consider schools known for
their outstanding academic pro
grams: the Ivy League institu
tions, Amherst, and North
western, among others. None of
them fields as many winning
athletic teams as Stanford does.
Consider schools with strong
athletic heritages: USC, UCLA,
and any number of schools from
powerful conferences like the
Big-10. Big Eight, Southeastern,
or Atlantic Coast. None of them
approaches Stanford's scholas
tic level for athletes, as proven
by the recent scandals in the Pa
cific-10 Conference and at other
universities.
Some colleges exist that boast
a sound academic curriculum
and one or two successful athlet
ic teams. Duke and
Georgetown, for example, have
excellent basketball squads.
The rest of their athletic teams,
however, are hardly as notable.
Meanwhile, the list of athletic
successes at Stanford extends
as long as its list of dist
inguished alumni — and is just
as diverse. Indian and Cardinal
teams have won 23 NCAA cham
pionships, sixth best in the na
tion, and 98 Stanford athletes
have captured individual NCAA
crowns in swimming, tennis,
track and field, and golf.
And the victories have not oc
curred only on the playing
fields. Recent studies revealed

that 90 percent of all male ath
letes and 91 percent of football
players graduate from Stanford
within five years. The per
centages are virtually the same
for female athletes. In addition,
85 percent of all athlptps pvpn.
luaiiy enter graduate school.
Both Michigan (27) and Yale
(25) have amassed more NCAA
team titles than Stanford. Yet
Michigan has a significantly
higher enrollment than Stan
ford. and its academic stan
dards. though impressive, can
not quite match Stanford's. As
for Yale, many of its non-cham
pionship teams are of Division
II — that is, lesser — quality.
Also, the Bulldogs compete in
an athletic conference (the Ivy
League) that ranks far below
the quality of other conferences.
This is not to say that Stan
ford's athletic-academic mix
ture is an immaculate one.
Negative aspects are evident:
the deficit of more than $1 mil
lion that the Athletic Depart
ment incurred last fiscal year,
the men's basketball team's in
ability to finish with a winning
season, and the isolated but
well-known instances of ath
letes failing in the classroom or
creating havoc on the campus.
"We're not perfect," Athletic
Director Andy Geiger admitted.
These flaws, however, de
tract little from the Univer
sity's unmatched blend of the in
tellectual and the physical.
What goes most toward creating
this blend is Stanford's str
ingent admissions policies.
"It almost sounds like a
platitude, but it's still the truth:
we just don't admit people that
can't do college-level work,"
said John Harbaugh, a geology
professor who serves as the fac
ulty representative to the Ath
letic Department, and is a vot
ing delegate at Pac-10 and
NCAA meetings.
By contrast, many NCAA
schools will automatically ad
mit students who compiled a 2.0
grade-point average in high
school. Harbaugii amusedly ob
served that at the NCAA con
vention earlier this month, a
motion to lift the minimum

GPA to 2.2 failed.
University cuaches and ol
ficials constantly emphasize
that the school's challenging
academics attracts rather than
discourages potential student
" — J — - 1
come complement.
"Th"e key to our success is our
using the University's
academics as an asset rather
than a hurdle," Geiger said.
"Intelligence and athletic prow
ess are good partners." And
Dick Dißiaso, head coach of the
men's basketball team, could
say even after forward Orlando
Ward was recently declared in
eligible due to academic prob
lems, "That (the University's
higher scholastic standards) is
what makes us great."
These high standards, accord
ing to Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, aren't bent for high
school athletes applying to Stan
ford. Hargadon asserted that
the admission process is largely
the same for a highly recruited
athlete as for a "normal" high
school senior. "They must com
plete the same application re
quirements, pay the same ap
plication fee. and so forth, as
any other applicant. We make
no exceptions in this regard,"
he said.
The only exceptions made are
necessary ones. Because some
sports exist for both men and
women where a national "letter
of intent" to attend a college
must be signed in early Febru
ary or March, the applications
of some student-athletes are de
cided upon early enough to meet
those deadlines.
In addition, if an applicant is a
particularly sought-after ath
lete. his or her would-be coach
informs Hargadon of that fact in
writing. "That is a factor we
take into consideration," he
said. "It does not mean, as I am
sure the coaches will tell you,
that simply because a student is
a highly desired athlete that
that student will be offered ad
mission." This same process oc
curs, Hargadon added, with tal
ented art and music students.
One might expect that the


John Harbaugh


Andy Geiger

coaches put considerable pres
sure on the Admissions Office to
accept an outstanding athlete,
but Hargadon insisted that none
of this occurs.
"They (the coaches) express
strong interest. They express
keen disappointment In that re
gard they are not unlike hun
dreds of others we hear from in
a given year. They have a tough
job. and were I in their position,
I'd be inclined to express both
strong interest and keen disap
pointment. too." the dean said.
Once the student-athletes are
accepted to Stanford, they re
ceive the same treatment as any
other student. "We generally
try not to treat students individ
ually by class, and we're less
likely to do that with athletes,
for the simple reason that other
schools do." said James Lyons,
dean of student affairs.
True, many teams eat at a
special "training table." but
only during their seasons. Also,
unlike many universities, Stan
ford has no dormitories re
served for athletes only.
To students who pay attention

to such matters, it may appear
that a preponderance of athletes
surface in classes affectionate
ly designated by the student
body as "micks." It's a fact that
many athletes don't shy away
from the easier courses, but it
would be ridiculous to say that
these courses are attended by
athletes only.
Geiger adamantly objects to
any academic allowances made
for athletes, such as class lists
informing them of easy courses
to be taken during the season, or
special tutors — all furnished
for them by the Athletic Depart
ment. "I'm opposed to this de
partment establishing an
academic counseling arm," he
said emphatically.
"I think we ask a great deal of
the student-athletes at Stanford
— I don't think we pull the wool
over anybody's eyes with that, "
Geiger added. "If you're going
to do both, we're asking for an
extraordinary commitment."
A sensitive coach can help the
student-athlete accept this com
mitment. "Good coaches are
more than coaches — they're

mentors, so they'll pay atten
tion to the whole person," Lyons
said.
One man who understands the
relationship a Stanford coach
ought to have with his players is
Paul Wiggin, head of the foot
ball team. As the head coach of
the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs,
Wiggin was tremendously ad
mired and respected by his
players, despite the fact that
they persisted in losing games.
This past fall, Wiggin's popu
larity spread to the Cardinal
football players, whom he tried
to regard as what they really
were — young men at college.
With professional players,
Wiggin said late last August,
"you deal on the business level.
You don't spend a lot of time
dealing in staff meetings with,
Why is that kid hanging his
head?' " Yet in coaching college
athletes, especially freshmen,
Wiggin feels that "you're in
more of a parent role ... the
conversations I have had with
college kids are in more of a pa
rent-child role — helping a
young man make the transition

in the first phase of his life away
from home."
Though Geiger correctly
says, "When we're at the 50-
yard line, we're not trading
transcripts," the influence of
academic and student life fol
lows the players to a degree
even when they take the field.
Unlike conditions at other

Stanford than winning athletic

coaches put considerable pres
sure on the Admissions Office to
accept an outstanding athlete,
but Hargadon insisted that none
of this occurs.
"They (the coaches) express
strong interest. They express
keen disappointment In that re
gard they are not unlike hun
dreds of others we hear from in
a given year. They have a tough
job. and were I in their position,
I'd be inclined to express both
strong interest and keen disap
pointment. too." the dean said.
Once the student-athletes are
accepted to Stanford, they re
ceive the same treatment as any
other student. "We generally
try not to treat students individ
ually by class, and we're less
likely to do that with athletes,
for the simple reason that other
schools do." said James Lyons,
dean of student affairs.
True, many teams eat at a
special "training table." but
only during their seasons. Also,
unlike many universities, Stan
ford has no dormitories re
served for athletes only.
To students who pay attention

to such matters, it may appear
that a preponderance of athletes
surface in classes affectionate
ly designated by the student
body as "micks." It's a fact that
many athletes don't shy away
from the easier courses, but it
would be ridiculous to say that
these courses are attended by
athletes only.
Geiger adamantly objects to
any academic allowances made
for athletes, such as class lists
informing them of easy courses
to be taken during the season, or
special tutors — all furnished
for them by the Athletic Depart
ment. "I'm opposed to this de
partment establishing an
academic counseling arm," he
said emphatically.
"I think we ask a great deal of
the student-athletes at Stanford
— I don't think we pull the wool
over anybody's eyes with that, "
Geiger added. "If you're going
to do both, we're asking for an
extraordinary commitment."
A sensitive coach can help the
student-athlete accept this com
mitment. "Good coaches are
more than coaches — they're

mentors, so they'll pay atten
tion to the whole person," Lyons
said.
One man who understands the
relationship a Stanford coach
ought to have with his players is
Paul Wiggin, head of the foot
ball team. As the head coach of
the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs,
Wiggin was tremendously ad
mired and respected by his
players, despite the fact that
they persisted in losing games.
This past fall, Wiggin's popu
larity spread to the Cardinal
football players, whom he tried
to regard as what they really
were — young men at college.
With professional players,
Wiggin said late last August,
"you deal on the business level.
You don't spend a lot of time
dealing in staff meetings with,
Why is that kid hanging his
head?' " Yet in coaching college
athletes, especially freshmen,
Wiggin feels that "you're in
more of a parent role ... the
conversations I have had with
college kids are in more of a pa
rent-child role — helping a
young man make the transition

in the first phase of his life away
from home."
Though Geiger correctly
says, "When we're at the 50-
yard line, we're not trading
transcripts," the influence of
academic and student life fol
lows the players to a degree
even when they take the field.
Unlike conditions at other
schools, there is more to life at
Stanford than winning athletic
teams. "When we have a team
that loses a lot. do people get up
set? No, I don't think so," Lyons
said.
Stanford's academic em
phasis probably plays the
greatest role in shaping this re
laxed attitude. It certainly af
fects the thinking of the people
who inhabit the Athletic Depart
ment.
''This (Stanford's
academics) makes our com
petitive posture somewhat
problematical. Perhaps our ex
pectations aren't always as high
as other schools'," Geiger said.
"Winning beyond a certain point
becomes an outstanding
achievement."

Also, the University's scho
lastics definitely make recruit
ing more difficult.
"They (Stanford coaches)
have to explain to students they
are recruiting why it is that
Stanford, sometimes alone
among the schools recruiting
that student, requires they take
tests and complete application
forms, and to have to do all of
that without knowing whether
they will ultimately gain ad
mission," Hargadon said.
"They have to recruit against
coaches who can 'admit' a pros
pect on the spot," he continued.
"They have to recruit against
coaches who will not hesitate to
use our standards against us, at
tempting to convince even the
most able student-athlete that
he or she could not possibly suc
ceed both academically and ath
letically at Stanford.
"In sum, they have to recruit
far more selectively than most
of the coaches against whom
they will compete, and the
margin of error (when it comes
to evaluating talent and decid
ing whom to spend time recruit
ing) is therefore much
smaller."
This is not to say that Stan
ford's athletic administration
conside r s academics a hin
drance. To do so would be a cop
out. for before trying to succeed
in a highly competitive con
ference. they must accept the
conditions they have to work
with at the University. "It's un
fortunate to use academics as
an excuse for failure." Geiger
said
Fortunately for Geiger and

his minions, they don't often
have to explain failures. How
ever. as the athletic director
said himself, the department is
not "perfect." and problems do
exist.
First, there is the $1,075,000
deficit the department suffered
during the 1979-80 fiscal year.
Despite all that red ink, caused
by decreased attendance at 1979
football games and only one na
tional television appearance
that vear. the department made

no major cuts in this year's
budget — thus revealing the con
siderable importance placed on
athletics at Stanford.
Obviously, maintaining a top
flight athletic program at a top
ranked university isn't easy.
"It's a very hard time for us,
though I'm sure other schools
would tell you that," Geiger
said.
The existence of sports that
bring in few game-related rev
enues. such as field hockey, vol-

leyball, or wrestling, depends
on the success of the "larger,"
money-making sports like foot
ball and basketball.
"We do not make judgments
on the basis of revenue prod
uction. On the other hand, the
only way to keep certain pro
grams is through revenue gen
eration," Geiger said.
The "Big Game Jog-a-thon"
was just one of the first of the
ploys used by the Athletic De
partment to help combat the

budget problem.
Another dilemma, at least in
the eyes of basketball followers,
is Stanford's lack of success in
that sport. The Cardinals have
not enjoyed a winning season
since 1972-73. when they finished
14-11 under then-head coach
Howie Dallmar. And since he
has been the head man. Dißiaso
has endured five consecutive
losing years — and in this, his
sixth season, the Cards have lost

Dick Dißiaso
10 of 16 contests.
Both Geiger and Dißiaso de
fended the basketball team by
saying that today's better teams
are generally the same teams
that have been at or near the top
for years. "Change a few names
in there, and things look like
they do now," Dißiaso said.
"Changing the pecking order is
a very difficult thing to do, and
we have had a long tradition of
ordinary basketball," Geiger
echoed.
Dißiaso pointed out that suc
cess can be defined in either of
two ways — by a winning record
overall or a winning record in
conference games — and that it
is not so easy to settle upon one
or the other.
The expansion of the con
ference from eight to 10 teams
increased the number of league
games from 14 to 18. Dißiaso
said, "Maybe if we didn't have
four more league games, we
could schedule four more games
against Division II teams, so
we'd be 15-11 instead of 11-15.
Are we more successful?"
Many coaches have the lux
ury of recruiting close to their
own university — UCLA and
USC teams, for example, are
almost totally composed of
players from the Los Angeles

area. But because relatively
few players exist who are good
enough for Pac-10 basketball
and smart enough for Stanford,
Dißiaso has to recruit national
ly and struggle to get many
players away from home.
The team has improved sig
nificantly with the arrival of
this year's four freshmen, but
Geiger said, "We need to con
tinue to have recruiting vic
tories."
This same problem is shared
to an extent by the other sports.
Many of Stanford's greater ath
letic triumphs are achieved in
"country club" sports such as
tennis. Meanwhile, grimier
sports like football remain com
petent but experience lesser
glories. With its famous tradi
tion for having a powerful of
fense, the football team has lit
tle trouble luring talented backs
and receivers to the Farm, but
acquiring equally adept de
fensive players remains trou
blesome. "Maybe it's just as
hard to build a tradition on
(football) defense as in basket
ball," theorized Dißiaso.
Finally, some students would
complain that though athletes
here perform handsomely in
their sport, they behave incor
rigibly when away from it — not

the way a Stanford student, or
student-athlete, should act,
Tales of athletes maintaining
their muscle tone by wreaking
havoc in dormitories and during
parties are popular subjects for
gossip.
"I suspect there's some truth
to that," Lyons said of damage
and destruction caused by ath
letes. However, he added that
just because a few big people
cause a nuisance, one should not
fall victim to the stereotype
which dictates that all big peo
ple are, in his words, "football
player types." And if they are
football players, Lyons said
their behavior shouldn't be gen
eralized to include all football
players.
Otherwise, there isn't much
to find fault with in Stanford's
athletic program. The Univer
sity doesn't brag about its syn
thesis of athletic and academic
competence, but instead quietly
glows in it. Last Sunday's Super
Bowl, for example, gave Stan
ford students and alumni every
where a chance to brighten. "I
have nothing to do with Jim
Plunkett, but it makes me feel
good that he's a Stanford gradu
ate." said Lyons. Overall, the
Athletic Department can be in
dicted only for its successes.
The red tile roofs decorating
the tops of many Stanford build
ings befit the University well.
Like the academic excellence it
helps to house, the red roofs are
at once prominent and linassum.
ing — they attract attention
without demanding it.
The Athletic Department
building on Galvez Street is one
of the edifices adorned by a red
roof. This, too, is fitting, tor
most of Stanford's 24 varsity
sports share the excellence that
the school's academic reputa
tion enjoys.
In fact, it would not be hyper
bolic to state that Stanford Uni
versity features the finest com
bination of academic and athlet
ic prowess of any major college
in the nation.
Consider schools known for
their outstanding academic pro
grams: the Ivy League institu
tions, Amherst, and North
western, among others. None of
them fields as many winning
athletic teams as Stanford does.
Consider schools with strong
athletic heritages: USC, UCLA,
and any number of schools from
powerful conferences like the
Big-10. Big Eight, Southeastern,
or Atlantic Coast. None of them
approaches Stanford's scholas
tic level for athletes, as proven
by the recent scandals in the Pa
cific-10 Conference and at other
universities.
Some colleges exist that boast
a sound academic curriculum
and one or two successful athlet
ic teams. Duke and
Georgetown, for example, have
excellent basketball squads.
The rest of their athletic teams,
however, are hardly as notable.
Meanwhile, the list of athletic
successes at Stanford extends
as long as its list of dist
inguished alumni — and is just
as diverse. Indian and Cardinal
teams have won 23 NCAA cham
pionships, sixth best in the na
tion, and 98 Stanford athletes
have captured individual NCAA
crowns in swimming, tennis,
track and field, and golf.
And the victories have not oc
curred only on the playing
fields. Recent studies revealed

that 90 percent of all male ath
letes and 91 percent of football
players graduate from Stanford
within five years. The per
centages are virtually the same
for female athletes. In addition,
85 percent of all athlptps pvpn.
luaiiy enter graduate school.
Both Michigan (27) and Yale
(25) have amassed more NCAA
team titles than Stanford. Yet
Michigan has a significantly
higher enrollment than Stan
ford. and its academic stan
dards. though impressive, can
not quite match Stanford's. As
for Yale, many of its non-cham
pionship teams are of Division
II — that is, lesser — quality.
Also, the Bulldogs compete in
an athletic conference (the Ivy
League) that ranks far below
the quality of other conferences.
This is not to say that Stan
ford's athletic-academic mix
ture is an immaculate one.
Negative aspects are evident:
the deficit of more than $1 mil
lion that the Athletic Depart
ment incurred last fiscal year,
the men's basketball team's in
ability to finish with a winning
season, and the isolated but
well-known instances of ath
letes failing in the classroom or
creating havoc on the campus.
"We're not perfect," Athletic
Director Andy Geiger admitted.
These flaws, however, de
tract little from the Univer
sity's unmatched blend of the in
tellectual and the physical.
What goes most toward creating
this blend is Stanford's str
ingent admissions policies.
"It almost sounds like a
platitude, but it's still the truth:
we just don't admit people that
can't do college-level work,"
said John Harbaugh, a geology
professor who serves as the fac
ulty representative to the Ath
letic Department, and is a vot
ing delegate at Pac-10 and
NCAA meetings.
By contrast, many NCAA
schools will automatically ad
mit students who compiled a 2.0
grade-point average in high
school. Harbaugii amusedly ob
served that at the NCAA con
vention earlier this month, a
motion to lift the minimum

GPA to 2.2 failed.
University cuaches and ol
ficials constantly emphasize
that the school's challenging
academics attracts rather than
discourages potential student
" — J — - 1
come complement.
"Th"e key to our success is our
using the University's
academics as an asset rather
than a hurdle," Geiger said.
"Intelligence and athletic prow
ess are good partners." And
Dick Dißiaso, head coach of the
men's basketball team, could
say even after forward Orlando
Ward was recently declared in
eligible due to academic prob
lems, "That (the University's
higher scholastic standards) is
what makes us great."
These high standards, accord
ing to Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, aren't bent for high
school athletes applying to Stan
ford. Hargadon asserted that
the admission process is largely
the same for a highly recruited
athlete as for a "normal" high
school senior. "They must com
plete the same application re
quirements, pay the same ap
plication fee. and so forth, as
any other applicant. We make
no exceptions in this regard,"
he said.
The only exceptions made are
necessary ones. Because some
sports exist for both men and
women where a national "letter
of intent" to attend a college
must be signed in early Febru
ary or March, the applications
of some student-athletes are de
cided upon early enough to meet
those deadlines.
In addition, if an applicant is a
particularly sought-after ath
lete. his or her would-be coach
informs Hargadon of that fact in
writing. "That is a factor we
take into consideration," he
said. "It does not mean, as I am
sure the coaches will tell you,
that simply because a student is
a highly desired athlete that
that student will be offered ad
mission." This same process oc
curs, Hargadon added, with tal
ented art and music students.
One might expect that the

coaches put considerable pres
sure on the Admissions Office to
accept an outstanding athlete,
but Hargadon insisted that none
of this occurs.
"They (the coaches) express
strong interest. They express
keen disappointment In that re
gard they are not unlike hun
dreds of others we hear from in
a given year. They have a tough
job. and were I in their position,
I'd be inclined to express both

would be ridiculous to say that
these courses are attended by
athletes only.
