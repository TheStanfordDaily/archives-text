# Stanford excels in both sports and studies

The red tile roofs decorating
the tops of many Stanford build
ings befit the University well.
Like the academic excellence it
helps to house, the red roofs are
at once prominent and linassum.
ing — they attract attention
without demanding it.
The Athletic Department
building on Galvez Street is one
of the edifices adorned by a red
roof. This, too, is fitting, tor
most of Stanford's 24 varsity
sports share the excellence that
the school's academic reputa
tion enjoys.
In fact, it would not be hyper
bolic to state that Stanford Uni
versity features the finest com
bination of academic and athlet
ic prowess of any major college
in the nation.
Consider schools known for
their outstanding academic pro
grams: the Ivy League institu
tions, Amherst, and North
western, among others. None of
them fields as many winning
athletic teams as Stanford does.
Consider schools with strong
athletic heritages: USC, UCLA,
and any number of schools from
powerful conferences like the
Big-10. Big Eight, Southeastern,
or Atlantic Coast. None of them
approaches Stanford's scholas
tic level for athletes, as proven
by the recent scandals in the Pa
cific-10 Conference and at other
universities.
Some colleges exist that boast
a sound academic curriculum
and one or two successful athlet
ic teams. Duke and
Georgetown, for example, have
excellent basketball squads.
The rest of their athletic teams,
however, are hardly as notable.
Meanwhile, the list of athletic
successes at Stanford extends
as long as its list of dist
inguished alumni — and is just
as diverse. Indian and Cardinal
teams have won 23 NCAA cham
pionships, sixth best in the na
tion, and 98 Stanford athletes
have captured individual NCAA
crowns in swimming, tennis,
track and field, and golf.
And the victories have not oc
curred only on the playing
fields. Recent studies revealed

that 90 percent of all male ath
letes and 91 percent of football
players graduate from Stanford
within five years. The per
centages are virtually the same
for female athletes. In addition,
85 percent of all athlptps pvpn.
luaiiy enter graduate school.
Both Michigan (27) and Yale
(25) have amassed more NCAA
team titles than Stanford. Yet
Michigan has a significantly
higher enrollment than Stan
ford. and its academic stan
dards. though impressive, can
not quite match Stanford's. As
for Yale, many of its non-cham
pionship teams are of Division
II — that is, lesser — quality.
Also, the Bulldogs compete in
an athletic conference (the Ivy
League) that ranks far below
the quality of other conferences.
This is not to say that Stan
ford's athletic-academic mix
ture is an immaculate one.
Negative aspects are evident:
the deficit of more than $1 mil
lion that the Athletic Depart
ment incurred last fiscal year,
the men's basketball team's in
ability to finish with a winning
season, and the isolated but
well-known instances of ath
letes failing in the classroom or
creating havoc on the campus.
"We're not perfect," Athletic
Director Andy Geiger admitted.
These flaws, however, de
tract little from the Univer
sity's unmatched blend of the in
tellectual and the physical.
What goes most toward creating
this blend is Stanford's str
ingent admissions policies.
"It almost sounds like a
platitude, but it's still the truth:
we just don't admit people that
can't do college-level work,"
said John Harbaugh, a geology
professor who serves as the fac
ulty representative to the Ath
letic Department, and is a vot
ing delegate at Pac-10 and
NCAA meetings.
By contrast, many NCAA
schools will automatically ad
mit students who compiled a 2.0
grade-point average in high
school. Harbaugii amusedly ob
served that at the NCAA con
vention earlier this month, a
motion to lift the minimum

GPA to 2.2 failed.
University cuaches and ol
ficials constantly emphasize
that the school's challenging
academics attracts rather than
discourages potential student
" — J — - 1
come complement.
"Th"e key to our success is our
using the University's
academics as an asset rather
than a hurdle," Geiger said.
"Intelligence and athletic prow
ess are good partners." And
Dick Dißiaso, head coach of the
men's basketball team, could
say even after forward Orlando
Ward was recently declared in
eligible due to academic prob
lems, "That (the University's
higher scholastic standards) is
what makes us great."
These high standards, accord
ing to Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, aren't bent for high
school athletes applying to Stan
ford. Hargadon asserted that
the admission process is largely
the same for a highly recruited
athlete as for a "normal" high
school senior. "They must com
plete the same application re
quirements, pay the same ap
plication fee. and so forth, as
any other applicant. We make
no exceptions in this regard,"
he said.
The only exceptions made are
necessary ones. Because some
sports exist for both men and
women where a national "letter
of intent" to attend a college
must be signed in early Febru
ary or March, the applications
of some student-athletes are de
cided upon early enough to meet
those deadlines.
In addition, if an applicant is a
particularly sought-after ath
lete. his or her would-be coach
informs Hargadon of that fact in
writing. "That is a factor we
take into consideration," he
said. "It does not mean, as I am
sure the coaches will tell you,
that simply because a student is
a highly desired athlete that
that student will be offered ad
mission." This same process oc
curs, Hargadon added, with tal
ented art and music students.
One might expect that the
