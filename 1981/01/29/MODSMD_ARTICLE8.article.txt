# Closeups: a look into

One is 5-foot-'2. Two measure
six-and-a-half feet high or
more. Two are captains of their
respective teams. Two have re
ceived All-America recog
nition, while the other one rare
ly plays.
But the three athletes share
one common trait. All of them
chose to ply their athletic skills
at Stanford, a school where
their academic skills would also
he sorely tested. They came to
the Farm because it offered the
best of both worlds, for better or
worse.
And all three have taken ad
vantage of the University cur
riculum, choosing Stanford be
cause of its academics, not in
spite of them. One majors in ec
onomics, one in political sci
ence, one in English.
All three are seniors, and as
such, have an overview of the
"Stanford Experience" not af
forded to very many students.
Above all, they said the
challenge afforded athletes by
Stanford requires a unique per
son, one who is different from
the average athlete of another
school. Their reflections on
their years here follow.

Brian Holloway

Brian Holloway is a busy
man. Though in one sense, his
career as a football player
ended in the heartbreak of a Big
Game loss in November, in an
other sense it is just beginning.
The offensive tackle is spending
his weekends this quarter flying

across the country to be eval
uated by a bevy of football
scouts. At 6-foot-7, 270 pounds,
Holloway's future as a pro
fessional is considered un
limited.
Yet when Holloway decided
to come to Stanford, football
was not the foremost thing on
his mind.
"Initially my dad made the
contact about coming here, then
I followed, just because of the
academics. I wasn't certain
about playing football. I had
done well in track in high school,
and I wanted to go to a place
where I could compete in both.
"But mainly, I hoped for the
opportunity to get a solid educa
tion. I'd have to say that was
most important. I planned to get
into college athletics, but it
didn't go beyond that,"
Holloway said. "I came here
with the idea of getting into the
working world or graduate
school upon graduation."
Once he was here, however,
the Maryland native realized
there was plenty to handle both
on and off the field. "At first, it
was a dramatic change. It really
required shifting gears. You're
in a position where you sink or
swim — you do get help, but I
found myself naturally respond
ing to the challenge of
academics and athletics."
He, and his teammates both,
Holloway added. "Most of the
athletes who come here realize
and accept that challenge. I
think they complement each
other. You develop a workman
like attitude in the classroom
because you're competing

against the best. That mental
toughness and tenacity carries
to the football field."
Once on the field, however,
the academic toughness doesn't
block the 260-pound behemoth
intent on destroying your quar
terback. "The elite attitude that
the academics have is on a
higher echelon. They don't
mean a damn thing on the field.
You've got to be ready to get
down and dirty, in a sense get
into the aggression and the
hard-hitting and physicalness of
football," Holloway said.
There are those who question
the ability of Stanford players to
get ready for every game.
Called "the Stanford syn
drome," it means Stanford can
beat Oklahoma but falls flat
against Cal. Holloway said he
doesn't believe in the idea of the
syndrome, in explaining why, he
pointed out why Stanford is in
deed different.
"Football takes a tremendous
amount of emotional and men
tal intensity that is difficult to
maintain. Those times of lack
adaisicalness are covered by su
perior talent and you win. A
squad like USC or UCLA always
comes up with more talent —
they've got a few more horses in
the barn and they can pull it
out," Holloway said.
"You've heard (USC football
coach) John Robinson say, 'We
did not play our best but we
stuck with it and we were for
tunate to pull it out.' They have
the talent to pull through the
doldrums. We have superior tal
ent, but we don't have a whole

lot of depth."
So it comes down to the people
you have. Holloway believes the
lack of depth can be beaten be
cause of the quality already
here. "That's what really con
cerned me when I came here:
the type of person the athletes
are." He liked them well enough
to come here, and he liked them
well enough to excel here.

Steve Crandell

Every athlete who comes
here knows he will start, knows
he will play a lot, and knows he
will leave his mark in Stanford
athletic history. But it doesn't
always happen that way. For
every Kim Belton, who gradu
ated last year as one of Stan
ford's greatest basketball
players ever, there are several
Steve Crandells.
Through last weekend, Cran
dell, a 6-foot-6 forward and co
captain of the basketball
Cardinals, had played in three
games, and scored four points.
Yet it makes no difference.
Even after four years on the
bench, he gets ready for every
game as if he were going to play
all 40 minutes.
"I haven't changed my at
titude at all. I've always been
very much in a double focus —
as co-captain often it's a respon
sibility I feel naturally," Cran
dell said. "It's frustrating not to
play as much as I thought I
would when I got here. Even if
you aren't playing, you can't
give up."
Not giving up is something
Crandell has done for four
years. He majors in English,
one of the most demanding ma
jors here, yet he has maintained
the balance between the books
and the basketball.
"Rather than an undue strain,
I'd say it's a challenge. It's a
challenge for any student to do
well — when you are involved in
sports, and it takes two or three
hours a day, six days a week and
four or five weekends during
winter quarter, it's that much
more of a challenge. If you want
it badly enough, you'll do it."
But juggling the two is often
trying. "You try. but obviously
you can't balance all the time.
When we're playing UCLA at
Pauley Pavilion, I'm not think
ing about my English paper;
I'm thinking about beating the
Bruins," Crandell said. "And
when you're studying for a
midterm the next day, you
aren't thinking about how to
beat USC's zone press. It takes
the ability to concentrate fully
on one, then switch gears to the
other."
Crandell is well aware that
thinking about beating UCLA
and doing it are two very dif
ferent matters. Stanford's rela
tive lack of success in basket
ball — the one measured in wins
— is a by-product of the
academic standards, he said. On
the one hand, he said, Stanford
has proven it isn't insurmoun
table. However, it hasn't been
surmounted yet, either.
"We'd be fooling ourselves if
we said it's as easy as schools
without high admissions stan
dards. That doesn't necessarily
limit you, as we've shown. We
haven't had winning records in
my four years here, but we have
had good players here. That
proves there are players who
can do well at Stanford and com
pete well.
"I don't know how to solve
it," Crandell said of the prob
lem. "Unlike football, where
you have a much bigger amount
of players from which to choose,
the amount of players in basket
ball is much less." After a
pause, Crandell added, "And

the amount of smart ones is
even smaller."
Nonetheless, Crandell, the
man who hasn't played, and who
hasn't played on a losing team,
wouldn't have gone anywhere
else.
"I think Stanford is very un
usual in giving someone who is
intelligent and talented in sport,
any sport, the chance to com
pete and get a good education. In
a world that's more and more
specialized, where a school is
either in academics or sports.
Stanford is a nice place to be. It
can do both and do both well."

Donna Rubin

In the world of collegiate
sports, where you are a member
of a tram that represents your
school, tennis sticks out like a
priest on Polk Street. Tennis is a
me, me, me, sport. You have no
one blocking for you. You have
no one passing to you. And often,
you must draw the same com
petitive drive normally re
served for an opponent to beat
your teammates. Otherwise,
you won't be on the team.
But team tennis has been
Stanford's baby. Five men's
championships and one wom
en's title verify that Stanford
has turned an individual sport
into a team one with few side ef
fects. And according to Donna
Rubin, they've done so in an en
joyable way.
Rubin should know. At 5-
foot-2, 110 pounds, Rubin is the
smallest player on the team in
stature only. Entering her sec
ond year as captain of Frank
Brennan's Cards, the only sen
ior on the women's squad has
played on one championship and
one second-place team in three
years here. Last year. Stanford
fkniatieU iitllUl, DUt KUtlin Won
All-America honors.
"We've been consistently
good because we know when to
peak at the right time," Rubin
said. "We don't pride ourselves
on winning every match, but
only the last one, the nationals.''
That technique, if you will, is

what separates Stanford from
the rest. And Stanford's
uniqueness is something in
which Rubin takes pride.
"For me, (Stanford) was a
combination of the best
academics, the best athletics,
the best weather and the best
scholarship, although the latter
two I didn't realize until I'd been
here for four years," Rubin
said.
"The members on the team
were another major point. The
girls here are involved in tennis
but they are multi-dimensional;
they go far beyond tennis. They
weren't as "cutthroat" as the
girls at the other schools."
Rubin said the difference is
that at the other schools, tennis
is usually all the players have.
"These girls (here) thought
about tennis, then thought
beyond tennis. The members of
our team are attracted to
school; very few are that single
minded (about tennis). USC and
Trinity, for instance, are less
demanding on academics.
There it's tennis all the way,
from what players there have
told me."
As odd as it may sound, Rubin
thus meant that the increased
load of academics actually
helps the Stanford tennis team.
"We know academics take their
toll, so we slowly increase until
the nationals. It's also very
healthy to worry about other
things in the short run to take
the edge off the competition
within the team."
The schoolwork is not always
a blessing in a rather thin dis
guise, however. Spring quarter
is a mishmash for both the
men's and the women's squads,
highlighted by at least a week
away from school when the na
tional rhampionships nrc rot,
tested. But rtubln said it is a
problem of choice.
"It's a strain we all choose to
put ourselves under. Let's put it
this way: you try to find a bal
ance between the physical,
mental and social aspects. It's
very difficult, especially as an
athlete," the political science

major said. "You strive for per
fection, but unless you're a gen
ius, or you have a photographic
memory, it's hard to feel good
about all three. You have to
compromise."
But, as the Stanford record
points out, the compromise does
not extend onto the court. Rubin
does not allow it.

"You can't worry here about
losing a set to a teammate in
practice. You can't afford to
take tennis off the court or
academics on the court. There
are too many other things.
There is no cutthroat competi
tion, which is the reason I came
here, yet we are consistently
good."
