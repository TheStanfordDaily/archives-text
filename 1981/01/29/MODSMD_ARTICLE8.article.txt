# Closeups: a look into

One is 5-foot-'2. Two measure
six-and-a-half feet high or
more. Two are captains of their
respective teams. Two have re
ceived All-America recog
nition, while the other one rare
ly plays.
But the three athletes share
one common trait. All of them
chose to ply their athletic skills
at Stanford, a school where
their academic skills would also
he sorely tested. They came to
the Farm because it offered the
best of both worlds, for better or
worse.
And all three have taken ad
vantage of the University cur
riculum, choosing Stanford be
cause of its academics, not in
spite of them. One majors in ec
onomics, one in political sci
ence, one in English.
All three are seniors, and as
such, have an overview of the
"Stanford Experience" not af
forded to very many students.
Above all, they said the
challenge afforded athletes by
Stanford requires a unique per
son, one who is different from
the average athlete of another
school. Their reflections on
their years here follow.

Brian Holloway

Brian Holloway is a busy
man. Though in one sense, his
career as a football player
ended in the heartbreak of a Big
Game loss in November, in an
other sense it is just beginning.
The offensive tackle is spending
his weekends this quarter flying

across the country to be eval
uated by a bevy of football
scouts. At 6-foot-7, 270 pounds,
Holloway's future as a pro
fessional is considered un
limited.
Yet when Holloway decided
to come to Stanford, football
was not the foremost thing on
his mind.
"Initially my dad made the
contact about coming here, then
I followed, just because of the
academics. I wasn't certain
about playing football. I had
done well in track in high school,
and I wanted to go to a place
where I could compete in both.
"But mainly, I hoped for the
opportunity to get a solid educa
tion. I'd have to say that was
most important. I planned to get
into college athletics, but it
didn't go beyond that,"
Holloway said. "I came here
with the idea of getting into the
working world or graduate
school upon graduation."
Once he was here, however,
the Maryland native realized
there was plenty to handle both
on and off the field. "At first, it
was a dramatic change. It really
required shifting gears. You're
in a position where you sink or
swim — you do get help, but I
found myself naturally respond
ing to the challenge of
academics and athletics."
He, and his teammates both,
Holloway added. "Most of the
athletes who come here realize
and accept that challenge. I
think they complement each
other. You develop a workman
like attitude in the classroom
because you're competing

against the best. That mental
toughness and tenacity carries
to the football field."
Once on the field, however,
the academic toughness doesn't
block the 260-pound behemoth
intent on destroying your quar
terback. "The elite attitude that
the academics have is on a
higher echelon. They don't
mean a damn thing on the field.
You've got to be ready to get
down and dirty, in a sense get
into the aggression and the
hard-hitting and physicalness of
football," Holloway said.
There are those who question
the ability of Stanford players to
get ready for every game.
Called "the Stanford syn
drome," it means Stanford can
beat Oklahoma but falls flat
against Cal. Holloway said he
doesn't believe in the idea of the
syndrome, in explaining why, he
pointed out why Stanford is in
deed different.
"Football takes a tremendous
amount of emotional and men
tal intensity that is difficult to
maintain. Those times of lack
adaisicalness are covered by su
perior talent and you win. A
squad like USC or UCLA always
comes up with more talent —
they've got a few more horses in
the barn and they can pull it
out," Holloway said.
"You've heard (USC football
coach) John Robinson say, 'We
did not play our best but we
stuck with it and we were for
tunate to pull it out.' They have
the talent to pull through the
doldrums. We have superior tal
ent, but we don't have a whole
