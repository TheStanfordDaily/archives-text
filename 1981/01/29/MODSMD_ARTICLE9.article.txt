# A
						story of Title IX legislation and NCAA changes
## Women's athletics gains funds, confidence 
### Sally Jenkins 
If five members of Dotty
McCrea's women's basketball
squad took to the court against
five from the men's team
coached by Dick Di√üiaso,
nobody could legislate the re
sults.

But a matter on which law
makers can and have called the
shots is that of funding for the
two programs, and due to a law
passed in 1977, that funding
must be equal. In addition, a re
cent decision at the annual
meeting of the NCAA to create
national championships and
Division I status for women
promises enhanced recognition
for the women's program here
because Stanford is interested
in competing for such cham
pionships.
"Title IX" legislation re
quires a university to provide
women with equal facilities as
men in each sport and propor
tional financial aid, or to forfeit
its right to federal funding.
According to McCrea, Title
IX provided women's athletics
with an extremely important
"foundation." The ruling "got
us off on the right foot, it gave us

a start that hopefully will allow
us to become a vital part of the
athletic department," she said.
In some cases, the women's
teams enjoy even better equip
ment than the men's due to Title
IX. The gymnastic team is such
an example: because it is such a
young squad (four years old)

they enjoy the newest, most in
novative and safest equipment
on the market because it is at
the most three years old.
The tennis and basketball
teams share the same facilities
and equipment as the men's
squads which, according to
coach Frank Brennan, is a rari
ty.
"We are on a par with the
men's team now; we share the
same facilities and have the ex
act same budget, which is par
ticularly nice," he said. "You
go to other schools and the facil
ities are separate, and almost
never up to par."
The scholarship oriented
Buck Club now has a female
equivalent in the Cardinal Club,
an organization specifically
created to raise funding for
women's sports. McCrea said
she is particularly appreciative

of the help which the club has
provided.
"They are growing so rapidly
it's incredible, (and) are re
markably enthusiastic and
energetic. It's nice to see wom
en interested in women, and the
athletes identify with them. I
think they will grow tremen
dously in the next five years."
McCrea said she does have
some complaints about sharing
equal facilities with the men's
team. Because the two teams
share Maples Pavilion with in
tramural games, there is pres
sure on practice time slots. Con
sequently, the women's squad
must practice from 6 to 8:30
p.m., what McCrea calls "the
graveyard shift." (Intramural
games are also played at night,
although some have been played
in the earlv hours of the morn
ing.)
"It's hard because a lot of my
scouting work has to be done in
the evenings, but I can't do it be
cause I have to run practice. If
there is a high school basketball
game I should attend, I can't. I
have to send an assistant
coach," she said.
McCrea asserted that steps
are being taken to ease the pres
sure on Maples, however. A new
intramural building is being
planned by the Athletic Depart
ment, to be built most likely be
hind the department offices
near the Old Pavilion.
Other disparities remain, al
though they have not resulted
from any lack of effort on the
part of the Athletic Depart
ment. These may be eased if
Stanford switches to NCAA
competition, but under present
rules of the Association of In
tercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW), the league in
which Stanford's women com
pete, teams are allowed 12 ath
letic scholarships, but are not

allowed to recruit off-campus or
fly a candidate to the school.
The men's teams competing in
the NCAA are allowed 15 schol
arships, and operate under
more liberal recruiting rules
which do allow them to fly a can
didate to the campus and to re
cruit off-campus.
Thus it is no surprise that the
University is contemplating se
riously a switch to the new
NCAA women's division. Bren
nan, strongly in favor of the
switch, foresees a nationwide
switch after some conflict be
tween the two leagues. "There
will probably be a power strug
gle to see who can sign the most
teams, and I think the NCAA
will win," he said. "Naturally, I
want to go where the competi
tion is."
Brennan's view seems to be
shared by the other women's
coaches, primarily because of
the difference in recruiting
rules. The AIAW rules are
potentially unfair to those high
school students who cannot af
ford to travel to universities
away from home.
Women's gymnastic coach
Jackie Walker has been in favor
of the NCAA for years; "the
NCAA rules are great. Under
the AIAW those students back
east will never get a chance to
see Stanford. In a way it's dis
criminatory against the lower
classes who can't afford to vis
it," she said.
Brennan echoed Walker's
sentiments. "If there is a New
Jersey girl I am interested in, I
can't fly her out here. If I can't
talk to her I'm not going to give
her a four-year scholarship."
Of course, many Stanford stu
dents have decided to come to
the school although they have
not been able to afford to see it,
and it is not a policy of the Uni
versity to pay for applicants

with particularly attractive
academic talents to come see
the campus.
Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said that Stanford is in
fact leaning heavily toward the
NCAA. Some financial dif
ficulties could arise if such a de
cision is made, however. Some
schools were forced to drop a
program to conform to Title IX
requirements; Alabama
dropped a championship wrestl
ing team, and California
dropped golf.
Although Stanford's athletic
department lost $1 million last
year, Geiger maintained that he
is happy with all of the pro
grams. The NCAA switch could
prove costly under such circum
stances due to a rise in the re
cruiting budget, which could put
even more of a strain on the fi
nancial situation.
But Geiger also said that last
year's loss was caused by unex
pected costs rather than Title
IX requirements, which is why
he does not predict any program
cutbacks. "I don't expect any
such thing at this time, although
that could change. I like the pro
gram we have now, and we are
working hard to maintain it."
The loss was due to several
factors, according to Geiger.
"We didn't have a bonanza year
ticket-wise, and hiring a new
football coaching staff is very
expensive. Also, the increase in
airline fares hurt us terribly."
Between the ongoing effects
of Title IX, and an all-but-defi- j
nite changeover to NCAA com
petition, the women's athletic
program has the chance to head
for unprecedented success. One
large obstacle that remains lies
in generating spectator interest
to cover rising costs, which the
teams themselves will have to
accomplish on their own.
