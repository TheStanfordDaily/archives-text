A recently published book, Cover to Cover,
evaluates about 460 bookstores in the San
Francisco Bay Area. Of these the author writes:
"The best known and the ones that spring to
mind are the stores such as Kepler's in Menlo
Park and Cody's in Berkeley. They are
chacterized hy being single location stores, staffed
by knowledgable book people who can discuss the
topical areas covered by the store. They are
friendly places and always crammed full of
browsers
If you have not yet visited the Bay Area's
top bookstore do so today and every week
thereafter.
"Kepler's is the home of nil the paperbacks'*
