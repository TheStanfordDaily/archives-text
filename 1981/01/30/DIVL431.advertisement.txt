This is what some big companies mean by a career.
Not General Electric.
When you go to work for GE, you won't become just
another little box on some huge organization chart.
People are important to us at GE.
Our many high-technology businesses require
people who thrive on the challenge of working at the
forefront of their fields. People who want the freedom to get
a job done.
Take our Advanced Microelectronics Operations.
We're committed to joining the leaders in the industry, and it
takes bright young engineers to do that.
Right now, we're looking for key people to fill
positions at our ultra-sophisticated new $ 100 million GE
Microelectronics Center in Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina, as well as at our other established facilities.
Specific openings exist in Integrated Circuit Design,
VLSI Device Structure Design, VLSI Process Development,
Integrated Circuit Application Engineering, Integrated
System Architecture, and Integrated Circuit Software Design.
Technical Recruiters will be on campus Monday and
Tuesday, February 9-10 to conduct interviews. Contact
your campus Placement Office for the exact place/time and
to make an appointment. Or, if you want to talk to us right
away, call l-(800) 334-8529, or send a resume to GE

This is what some big companies mean by a career.
Not General Electric.
When you go to work for GE, you won't become just
another little box on some huge organization chart.
People are important to us at GE.
Our many high-technology businesses require
people who thrive on the challenge of working at the
forefront of their fields. People who want the freedom to get
a job done.
Take our Advanced Microelectronics Operations.
We're committed to joining the leaders in the industry, and it
takes bright young engineers to do that.

positions at our ultra-sophisticated new $ 100 million GE
