# Library staff complains about renovation hazards
## 
### Carl Johnston 
Office workers at Green Library be
lieve that working conditions have de
teriorated there since renovations
began on the old West Wing last Au
gust . and they are now organizing a li
brary health and safety committee to
do something about it.
The $2 million construction job
which includes the plastering, paint
ing demolition and reconstruction of
the building's pavilion and balcony
;irea has caused considerable discom
fort for the 30 workers in the building
Coughing, headaches, and even nau
sea brought on by loose plaster, dust,
and noise of the construction are the
most common complaints.
"You work all day with dust in your
nose and face." said one worker on the
fifth floor "But nobody (in man
agement i seems to be worried about
it Stanford's a bureaucracy. You've
got to go through channels to get any

thing done It wouldn't be so bad if you
didn't feel there was nothing you could
do about it."
However. Mike Ordonia. library
project coordinator for the renova
tion. does not think that things are so
bad.
Ordonia, who has his office in the
same part of the building as the other
workers, says that the things that the
others complain of are things one
should expect during a major con
struction project.
"I don't consider it fair to call it a
severe problem." says Ordonia. "It is
a construction project and you have to
expect these things
"We're continuing to try to keep
down the amount of contact between
people and the contractors." says Or
dania. "they sometimes do drilling
work, or re-route electrical wiring
Some kinds of the work we're doing
are not amenable to that process (of
keeping contractors and workers
apart. >"
On the other hand. Ordonia con
ceeded. "library workers are going
into their third year with construction
work at the library going on. It's get
ting on their nerves. I understand
that."
Last Monday Barbara Cohrssen of
the I'niversitv's Office of Health and
Safety made an inspection trip to the
library.
Corsin recommended that the ef
forts of the contractors handling the
project, Amaroso Construction Co. of
San Carlos, be stepped up She also
recommended that construction areas
within the building be better posted.
After a meeting to air grievances
last Tuesday night, she also recom
mended that the workers form a
health and safety committee to com
pile workers' grievances and present
them to management.
At the Tuesday night meeting.
Cohrssen noted "a high degree of frus
tration" among the staff, as well as a
poor flow of information between em
ployees and the management of the
project. Growing tensions between
workers and management, she said,
were coming ci~se to obscuring the is

sues of safety in the building
"I'm just worried that because of
the tension between workers and man
agement that priorities might be put
out of order." Cohrssen said
Natalie Wells, one of the workers
who is preparing to organize the com
mittee feels that she has reason to feel
concern for her and her co-worker's
safety.
Contractors handling heavy ma
chinery sometimes worked on scaf
folding and ladders directly above
passageways, according to Wells.
These areas were not cordoned off.
and the warning signs were insuffi
cient to warn pedestrians of danger.
Worse, however, was the dust. Ac
cording to Wells, three-quarters of the
people working in that part of the li
brary have some sensitivity to the
dust, and the last few months have
been a constant battle against hacking
coughs, sneezing, itching eyes, head
aches and nausea.
Wells conceeds that conditions have
improved since Cohrssen's visit.
Much of the dust and debris was
cleared from the main hall on Wednes
day morning But she still intends to
organize her fellow workers so that
they can be on top with some leverage
in future similar situations.
"We're going to organize this com
mittee." said Wells, "so that this situ
ation can never happen again
Part of the problem at Green
Cohrssen suggests, are the expecta
tions the library workers have for
their working environment.
"People who work in an office en
vironment don't anticipate the same
kind of things that workers in a foun
dry or factory do People expect a li
brary to be clean and quiet It's a tem
porary situation, and they (the office
workers) aren't accustomed to it
"Workers affected by construction
should be notified of what s going to
happen so that people can accom
modate to the conditions "
Cohrssen also noted that thp (ireen
employees had had problems dealing
with the management in the past, and
that this had contributed to their frus
tration

Last Monday Barbara Cohrssen of
the I'niversitv's Office of Health and
Safety made an inspection trip to the
library.
Corsin recommended that the ef
forts of the contractors handling the
project, Amaroso Construction Co. of
San Carlos, be stepped up She also
recommended that construction areas
within the building be better posted.
After a meeting to air grievances
last Tuesday night, she also recom

At the Tuesday night meeting.
Cohrssen noted "a high degree of frus
tration" among the staff, as well as a
poor flow of information between em
ployees and the management of the
project. Growing tensions between
workers and management, she said,
were coming ci~se to obscuring the is

sues of safety in the building
"I'm just worried that because of
the tension between workers and man
agement that priorities might be put
out of order." Cohrssen said
Natalie Wells, one of the workers
who is preparing to organize the com
mittee feels that she has reason to feel
concern for her and her co-worker's
safety.
Contractors handling heavy ma
chinery sometimes worked on scaf
folding and ladders directly above
passageways, according to Wells.
These areas were not cordoned off.
and the warning signs were insuffi
cient to warn pedestrians of danger.
Worse, however, was the dust. Ac
cording to Wells, three-quarters of the
people working in that part of the li
brary have some sensitivity to the
dust, and the last few months have
been a constant battle against hacking
coughs, sneezing, itching eyes, head
aches and nausea.
Wells conceeds that conditions have
improved since Cohrssen's visit.
Much of the dust and debris was
cleared from the main hall on Wednes
day morning But she still intends to
organize her fellow workers so that
they can be on top with some leverage
in future similar situations.
"We're going to organize this com
mittee." said Wells, "so that this situ
ation can never happen again
Part of the problem at Green
Cohrssen suggests, are the expecta
tions the library workers have for
their working environment.
"People who work in an office en
vironment don't anticipate the same
kind of things that workers in a foun
dry or factory do People expect a li
brary to be clean and quiet It's a tem
porary situation, and they (the office
workers) aren't accustomed to it
"Workers affected by construction
should be notified of what s going to
happen so that people can accom
modate to the conditions "
Cohrssen also noted that thp (ireen
employees had had problems dealing
with the management in the past, and
that this had contributed to their frus

Library employees have complained about the health
problems caused b\ the renovation of the old West Wing of

Daily photo bv James Higa
Green Library. The employees are forming a committee
to present their grievances to the University.
Office workers at Green Library be
lieve that working conditions have de
teriorated there since renovations
began on the old West Wing last Au
gust . and they are now organizing a li
brary health and safety committee to
do something about it.
The $2 million construction job
which includes the plastering, paint
ing demolition and reconstruction of
the building's pavilion and balcony
;irea has caused considerable discom
fort for the 30 workers in the building
Coughing, headaches, and even nau
sea brought on by loose plaster, dust,
and noise of the construction are the
most common complaints.
"You work all day with dust in your
nose and face." said one worker on the
fifth floor "But nobody (in man
agement i seems to be worried about
it Stanford's a bureaucracy. You've
got to go through channels to get any

thing done It wouldn't be so bad if you
didn't feel there was nothing you could
do about it."
However. Mike Ordonia. library
project coordinator for the renova
tion. does not think that things are so
bad.
Ordonia, who has his office in the
same part of the building as the other
workers, says that the things that the
others complain of are things one
should expect during a major con
struction project.
"I don't consider it fair to call it a
severe problem." says Ordonia. "It is
a construction project and you have to
expect these things
"We're continuing to try to keep
down the amount of contact between
people and the contractors." says Or
dania. "they sometimes do drilling
work, or re-route electrical wiring
Some kinds of the work we're doing
are not amenable to that process (of
keeping contractors and workers
apart. >"

ceeded. "library workers are going
