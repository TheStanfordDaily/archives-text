# Academics vs. federal gov't; secret codes cause controversy
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
A dispute between the federal
government and a group of
academic mathematicians over
top secret codes and national se
curity is slowly coming to a
head, with each side forecasting
— with some exaggeration —
catastrophic consequences
should the other side prevail.
At issue is an effort by the De
partment of Defense's normally
reticent National Security
Agency to limit publication of
certain research in crypto
graphy — the science of codes.
It is being pressed by the gov
ernment now because of ad
vances in computer technology
and because of increased
academic interest in crypto
graphy in recent years, spurred
in part by the need to improve
the security of commercial
computer systems.
Many researchers argue that
limiting the publication of cryp
tographic research would ad
versely affect the development
of computer security much
more than it would help protect
American secrets.
The government says na
tional security is at stake be
cause research in this area has
progressed to the point where it
could help other countries crack
American codes.
However, the basis of this
argument is itself classified. It
must be "taken as a given that
there is a potential danger,"

Daniel Schwartz, general coun
sel of the National Security
Agency, said recently.
In wartime, the nation's top
secret codes are used to com
municate military plans and in
structions. In peacetime, com
munications between Washing
ton and American embassies
abroad are encoded, as are
messages at the highest levels
of government within the Unit
ed States and overseas.
The source of heated debate is
a proposal for a voluntary sys
tem in which authors and edi
tors would submit papers on
cryptography to a government
review board, which could ask
for changes, though not force
them. The proposal calls for
trying the voluntary plan as an
experiment for two to four
years.
The key question is whether
the relatively small number of
researchers in the field would
comply, and there is no clear in
dication.
The Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers, the
American Mathematical Socie
ty and the Society for Industrial
and Applied Mathematics, all of
which publish scholarly jour
nals, each said that they had not
yet formally considered pre
publication review by the gov
ernment.
If the proposal is adopted and
authors or editors refuse to
comply, the security agencv

says it could seek legislation
similar to the laws on atomic
energy research, which would
impose a system that the re
searchers would find more
onerous than a voluntary one.
"It's premature to identify
what the specific options are,"
Schwartz said. "The legislative
option is obviously one."
Cryptographic researchers
and some other academics see
in the government's efforts a se
vere threat to their personal
freedom as well as to their pro
fessional work.
"We're entering a stage of
computerization where the use
of computers is threatening
whatever privacy we have
left," said George Davida of the
University of Wisconsin and the
Georgia Institute of Technolo
gy, who is one of the leading op
ponents of prior review, volun
tary or otherwise.
"Telephone networks are
computer networks in fact,"
Davida said. "There are op
portunities for abuse in tele
phone companies, in electronic
mail and electronic funds
transfer. All these introduce
new techniques for invading
privacy that we didn't have
before.
"We have to consider all of
these applications, along with
NSA's mission, to determine
whether it's worth giving up a
large chunk of freedom.
