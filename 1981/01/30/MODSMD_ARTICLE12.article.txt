# Ramey focuses on women and the Court

Calling this decade an "aus
picious time to look at women
and the law," Professor
Drucilla Ramey of Golden Gate
Law School, gave her Terman
Auditorium audience a brief ov
erview of women's rights for the
past 150 years before addressing
some of the more recent issues
before American courts.
Ramey was the lirst speaker
in the Center for Research on
Women (CROW) noon lecture
series, "Women and Equality:
Law and Justice," which began
last Wednesday.
Ramey said that in a ruling of
1873 the Supreme Court made a
blatant distinction between
men's and women's roles in so
ciety, saying that it was man's
civil and natural place to be the
provider and women's place to
remain at home. Since that time
attempts to gain the vote were
unsuccessful until the passage

of the 19th Amendment in 1920.
Many "protective" laws and
statutes, which placed special
restrictions on the number of
hours women could work, their
minimum wage, and their con
ditions of work, were upheld
throughout most of the 1900s,
Ramey explained, adding
"these statutes tended to chan
nel women into jobs of least pay,
least responsibility and least op
portunity of advancement."
It was not until the 19705,
which Ramey called a "revolu
tionary" decade, that these
laws were considered to be a
form of sex discrimination.
Ramey traced the develop
ment of a new method of ex
amining these statutes which
recently came into use — the in
termediate scrutiny test —
which specifies that a state or
other government body must
prove that any special classi
fications are important to the

state's ability to perform its
functions. Under this test, many
gains in women's rights have
been made possible, she said.
Examples of these changes
are in the regulations regarding
women's service in the mili
tary, social security benefits to
widowers and in the abolition of
automatic alimony.
Currently, the Supreme Court
is considering a case in which a
man mortgaged the family's
house without his wife's signa
ture. Ramey said she expects
the Court to declare this action
unconstitutional.
She also said the Court deals
with matters of obvious sex dis
crimination relatively equally
but that it has been "wishy
washy" when it is afraid that an
old statute may really help
women. It has also been hesitant
to tackle the most pressing and
controversial issues — such as
the draft, abortion and other
matters pertaining to child-re

aring and the nucleus of the
family, Ramey said.
The present Court position
with regard to women in mili
tary service goes back to an
earlier decision which cites
women's "frailty" and "home
duties" as something which
keeps them out of combat, said
Ramey. She said this position
does not take into account the
women who wish to serve in the
armed forces on an equal basis.
Ramey considers it "danger
ous" to desire both full equality
and protective legislation in
special cases, such as the draft.
"As long as we are not called
upon to uphold and defend our
country, we will not be con
sidered a full part of the sov
ereignty," she said.
Paraphrasing Susan B. An
thony. Ramey ended her lecture
saying, "Women — their rights
and nothing less; women —
their rights and nothing more."
