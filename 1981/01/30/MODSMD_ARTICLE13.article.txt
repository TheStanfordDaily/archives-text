# Musical ribbons for hostages?
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Hollywood â€” Yellow ribbons,
the symbol of the U.S. hostages'
homecoming celebrations, may
soon be decorating the pop mu
sic charts again.
The idea for the symbolism
came from"Tie a Yellow Rib
bon Round the Ole Oak Tree,"
the song written by Irwin Levine
and L. Russell Brown in 1973 af
ter they read about a home
ward-bound prisoner who wrote
his wife, asking that she tie a
ribbon around a tree if she still
loved him.
The cheery, sentimental song
caught the public's imagination,
selling more than 30 million
copies worldwide. The key ver
sion by Tony Orlando and Dawn
was on the national best-seller
list for nearly six months. A cov
er record by Johnny Carver
went Top 10 in the country field.
Since the hostages were freed
last week, yellow ribbons have

greeted the 52 Americans at
every turn. Even some of the
news people covering the
hostages' return have worn yel
low ribbons on their clothing.
Now, Levine and Brown have
written a sequel to the song,
keying in on the hostage situ
ation. Sample lyric:
"Now Old Glory keeps on
waving
And I can't believe I see
200 million yellow ribbons
Round the ole oak tree."
Available soon
Recorded last Friday by
Johnny Carver on MCA Re
cords, the new version is al
ready being played on radio sta
tions around the country and
should be in the stores by this
weekend.
"We were going to just put it
out as a public service record to
disc jockeys," said Ron
Chancey, an MCA vice presi
dent in Nashville. "We did the

same thing recently with a ver
sion of the 'Star Spangled Ban
ner' by the Oak Ridge Boys.
"As soon as the radio stations
here started playing Johnny's
record, however, people started
phoning stores wanting copies
of it. So, we decided to go ahead
and make it available," said
Chancey.
Response from the initial air
play was so strong, Chancey
said, that original plans to press
just 50,000 copies were revised.
The first pressing will now be
200,000 copies.
Excited but hesitant
Contacted by phone at his
home in Livingston, N.J., song
writer Levine said he was
thrilled about his song's role in
the hostage celebrations. He
added that at first he resisted
reworking the song because he
did not want to appear ex
ploitative.
"When I was growing up, one

of my idols was George M.
Cohan," Levine said. "I loved
the movie about him starring
James Cagney. I was fascinated
the way Cohan's songs, like
'Yankee Doodle Dandy' and
'Over There,' could inspire the
whole country. I have a
videotape of the movie and I still
play it all the time.
"So. it's just unbelievable to
me that one cf my songs has be
come a symbol, too "
Tony Orlando, the singer
most identified with "Yellow
Ribbon," said he would not re
cord the new song, but he sees
nothing exploitative
"It's a beautiful story. The
ribbons started off as a symbol
of hope when the hostages were
taken, then it became a symbol
of love and now it's a symbol of
unity. There's no question about
it: These 52 men and women
have tied a yellow ribbon around
this whole nation."
