## Editor's farewell 
### 
Though we at the Daily prize our
independence a great deal, we have
always valued the community support we
receive, monetary and otherwise, and
thus we try to keep our affairs as open to
the public as possible. This last issueof
Volume 178 serves as an appropriate
forum to report to you. our readership, on
the key changes of the past five months.
The addition of a computerized
typesetting system has presented a very
great challenge to the Daily; without
question, this new technology has been
both a blessing and a burden. We are now
more in control of our editorial
production, but we've had to sacrifice
some educational goals in order to train
people to use the system. Also, in order to
pay for the system. we've taken out a loan
of $130,000 from the University. This loan
will be paid in less than three years, but
until then there will be a greater strain on
our budget. For example, because of this
financial pressure, we've had to constrict
the amount of editorial copy we print.
The system has added even more duties
to an overworked group of hard working
editors. This year, the Daily is shifting

responsibility from a generally older
group to a relatively inexperienced band
of sophomores and juniors. Thus there has
been a great deal more pressure on this
year's staff than those of the past.
I encourage everyone to consider the
Daily a forum they can be part of. whether
it is as an editorial staffer or as a
participant on the opinions page. The
people working here are eager for your
help.
Even with our best efforts this volume,
the Daily has a way to go to be the product
we'd all like it to be: comprehensive,
detailed, timely. I've enjoyed facing this
task with this volume's staff, which I
consider to be the finest I've ever worked
with. An editor is only as good as his or her
staff, and I've been blessed with a group
that is better than anyone could hope for.
To them, more than anyone else. I want to
give my heartfelt thanks. And finally. I
want to say that I will greatly miss the
interaction with the Stanford community
that this job provides.
