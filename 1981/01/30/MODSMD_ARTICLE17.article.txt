Art for the Masses
It was heartening to note the
humanistic basis on which L.H.
Gann (Daily, Jan. 26) defended
the U.S. supply of lethal weap
ons to the El Salvadorean junta.
It is widely recognized that this
will add to the rising death toll
amongst the peoples committed
to the (alleged communist) un
prising, yet strangely is has in
frequently been claimed that
U.S. intervention to support the
military is guided by concern
for the previously burgeoning
"art, philosophy, science and
religion" amongst the El
Salvadorean peoples.
This vivid portrait of
arguably the most im
poverished, undernourished and
desperate population in the
North American continent
being helped by the U.S. to cling
to their formerly widely used
rights of artistic expression in
the face of the Communist
Threat is perhaps the most en
couraging news to recently
come from amongst the daily
misery of Central America.
Seriously, Gann's preference
for a military regime widely ac
knowledged to have murdered
many thousands of peasants,
church functionaries and politi
cal opponents on the grounds
that any alternative must be
communist, and hence will vio
late individual rights, seems to
be based on a paranoid attitude
towards progressive political
change. It is easy to defend such
a narrow viewpoint in Hoover's
ivory tower but in the everyday
struggle in Latin America such
perspectives become irrelevant
and even offensive to human
dignity.
Many of us would be willing to
reject Gann's fantastic, sim
plistic, and misguided com
ments for what they are worth,
were it not that presumably this
attitude is widely held within an
institution from which many re

cent government advisers have
been chosen, and which conse
quently is molding our future in
ternal and external affairs, for
better, or more likely, for
worse.

KZSU radio would like to cor
rect and clarify several allega
tions made in a recent Daily
article (Monday. Jan In
that article. Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons "charged
KZSU with breaking a 'con
tractual agreement' with the
Palo Alto City Council" to
broadcast their weekly meet
ings. KZSU staff member Paul
Stoltz graciously volunteered to
operate the station (i.e.. sit*in
the studio to make sure nothing
goes wrong) during the Decem
ber 22. 1980 City Council meet
ing — which was broadcast in its
entirety. The City Council did
not meet in the following two
weeks (December 29. 1980 and
January 5. 1981.) The next City
Councii meeting was held on
January 12. 1981 and was broad
cast as scheduled -Unfortunate-
ly. this was not made clear to
the Daily.
Secondly, Dean Lyons cited
KZSU for "depriving listeners
of regular KZSU features"
by closing over the Christmas
break However, in October,
KZSU Chief Announcer Michael
Aldredge talked to Dean Lyons
about the impending problems
in staffing KZSU Chief An
nouncer Michael Eldredge
talked to Dean Lyons about the
impending problems in staffing
KZSU during Christmas break.
Dean Lyons was non-committal
and when this problem was
mentioned several time in No
vember to Associate Dean
Thomas Massev. he (Massev)

said that any decisions about
Christmas break must wait un
til the KZSU Board of Directors
has been established When
time ran out last quarter and
Dean Lyons had still denied
KZSU the flexibility to tem
porarily use non-students over
the break. KZSU was left with
little choice but to shut down.
Finally, we feel that the quali
ty and cohesiveness of the KZSU
management has steadily been
increasing and. currently, is
much better than it has been in
the past. Assuming that, at
worst, the quality of the KZSU
management is the same as in
the past and if Dean Lyons feels
that KZSU does not have "the
leadership and the capability"
to responsibly operate the radio
station, we wonder why the Uni
versity has not shown a concern
with the management of KZSU
over the past five or ten years.
We wonder just whose leader
ship and capability should be
questioned.

Chicano chicanery
As concerned members of the
Chicano community, we feel im
pelled to take issue with certain
statements made by Israel
Rodriguez and Jessica Torres (
Daily, Jan. 26) concerning
Chicanos in business.
The assumptions and implica
tions behind Rodriguez's and
Torres' statements perpetuate
and reinforce the existing stere
otypes about Chicanos. It is our
belief that the Chicano Business
Society (CBS) fosters the sys
tematic assimilation of
Chicanos into the sordid free
martini-lunch lifestyle and is
therefore a cadre of corporate
America.
In the article Torres states
that "There is a negative con

notation in the word Chicano."
Torres does more damage to the
Chicano cause with that particu
lar statement than the Frito
Bandido commercials of the
early seventies; she per
petuates the myth of Chicanos
as "lowlifers" and "hoodlums"
and aggregates pejorative
terms.
Furthermore, she incorrectly
assumes that the only manner to
dispel the "lowlifer" myth is by
entering the realm of big busi
ness. Rodriguez implies that
there exist bands "of bellig
erent and hostile" Chicanos in
tent on destroying the social or
der, and although Rodriguez re
futes the "piece of the pie" ide
ology, Torres speaks of "mak
ing it." We ask, why the con
tradiction?
V/e feel that corporate Ameri
ca should not receive support
from Chicanos because it is pre
cisely the lower classes (of
which Chicanos constitute a
large part) that suffer the most
from its abusive members (ITT,
Coors, Syntex, IBM, to name a
few). While we recognize the
imminent need for economic re
distribution, it is not through the
existing corporate structure
that this will be achieved.
Chicano economics, because of
its historical context, is, and
should be distinct from the pit
tance (tokens) that corporate
America hands us.
Perhaps Rodriguez and
Torres should investigate the
legacy left us by our ancestors
— the Calpuli — the main mode
of production of the Aztec nation
which we might add, em
phasizes important values such
as comunidad, values we will
never let corporate America de
stroy.
