## Robert Wesson Lesson learned from hostage crisis 
### 
Aside from wars, no event in
history has so stirred the feel
ings of Americans as the pro
tracted imprisonment of the 52
in Iran. In so much drama, there
should be important lessons.
Some are obvious. Americans
are phenomenally sensitive to
the sufferings of their fellows,
even to possibly endangering
major strategic interests; prob
ably no other nation would have
made the plight of one citizen in
four million a prime national
concern for so long. Americans
are forgiving; there is reason
ably little demand that the Ira
nians be punished for what was
by all canons of international
law and humanity a gross
crime.
It is less cheerful to note that
the American government
showed itself remarkably in
competent in a series of short
comings: inconsistency in sup
port of the shah, failure to
assess the opposition to his gov
ernment, failure to heed warn
ings against admitting him (for
no substantial medical reasons)
to the United States, and failure
to prepare the embassy for an
assault, even to destroy embar
rassing documents.
After the seizure of the em
bassy and the hostages, the ad
ministration by loud and loose
talk made it a matter of pride
and face for the Iranians to hold
onto the hostages as proof of will

and independence and con
vinced the captors that they had
a valuable prize that could be
used in bargaining with the U.S.
The attempted rescue in April
was a textbook example of poor
planning. No such operation
should be attempted unless the
nation is prepared to support it
strongly enough virtually to
guarantee its success and unless
prospective results outweigh
the risks of broader complica
tions.
Many of the mistakes of the
hostage episode are closely par
alleled by mistakes of Vietnam:
failure of political assessment,
failure to weigh consequences
of actions, and failure to meas
ure military power adequately
to requirements. Another great
lesson of Iran ought to have been
learned in Vietnam: the folly of
identifying the U.S. with partic
ular regimes and personalities
in the Third World.
In Iran as in Vietnam, the U.S.
received the blame for all the
mistakes or vices of the regimes
that appeared to be its puppets.
It is often urged that the U.S.
should not be too closely aligned
with dictatorships, but the bet
ter principle is that this country
should not identify itself with
any government or leader, re
gardless of its or his qualities.
Popular rulers become un
popular — the shah was once
quite popular — and capable
governments become in

capable, and they fall not so
much because they are evil as
because they are weak. The
Somoza regime, for example,
like that of the shah, fell not be
cause it was cruel but because it
became excessively corrupt and
incompetent.
The only sound approach for
the U.S. is to maintain reason
able distance and impartiality.
This is obvious in regard to a bad
government, but it is also true of
a good one. The good govern
ment does not need to have Un
cle Sam standing visibly behind
it, and to rely on the big foreign
power would only weaken it in
the long term.
A still broader principle be
came woefully apparent in the
prolonged hostage crisis: we do
not come near understanding
the mentality of some, perhaps
most, Third World leaders.
From the point of view of our ra
tionality, they may be sadly ir
rational. In modern Western
terms, many of them are pro
foundly ignorant; thus, the for
mal education of the Iranian
"militants" consisted chiefly of
reading the Koran and commen
taries.
Third World leaders are prob
ably quite as intelligent as in
habitants of Washington, but we
cannot count on their reacting
sensibly as we view the world —
and this applies to Soviet lead
ers as well. We do not com
prehend their rejection of our

values, their defensiveness, and
their emotionalism. We must
also assume if they talk sensibly
(in our terms) it may be more or
less because they have learned
what pleases us or moves us to
accept their wishes.
That we do not share their
values is further reason to avoid
meddling in the politics of Third
World countries. We do not
know what institutions they
need, and even our advocacy of
democracy and human rights
may be suspect. They have
basically to solve their own
problems. This does not mean,
of course, that we cannot help;
but the Iranian drama merely
shows that help should not be in
terference.
Finally, we ought to have
learned that we do not really
know how to deal with the Third
World. We do not know the long
term effect of actions or the re
sults, for example, of foreign
aid: witness the fact that a very
few years ago the shah's Iran,
with an annual GNP growth rate
of 20 percent and all manner of
admirable programs, was con
sidered a model for develop
ment and modernization. To try
to lead very different peoples
with values very different from
our own along paths that we find
proper is to invite trouble.

Some are obvious. Americans
are phenomenally sensitive to
the sufferings of their fellows,
even to possibly endangering
major strategic interests; prob
ably no other nation would have
made the plight of one citizen in
four million a prime national
concern for so long. Americans
are forgiving; there is reason
ably little demand that the Ira
nians be punished for what was
by all canons of international
law and humanity a gross
crime.
It is less cheerful to note that
the American government
showed itself remarkably in
competent in a series of short
comings: inconsistency in sup
port of the shah, failure to
assess the opposition to his gov
ernment, failure to heed warn
ings against admitting him (for
no substantial medical reasons)
to the United States, and failure
to prepare the embassy for an
assault, even to destroy embar
rassing documents.
After the seizure of the em
bassy and the hostages, the ad
ministration by loud and loose
talk made it a matter of pride
and face for the Iranians to hold
onto the hostages as proof of will

and independence and con
vinced the captors that they had
a valuable prize that could be
used in bargaining with the U.S.
The attempted rescue in April
was a textbook example of poor
planning. No such operation
should be attempted unless the
nation is prepared to support it
strongly enough virtually to
guarantee its success and unless
prospective results outweigh
the risks of broader complica
tions.
Many of the mistakes of the
hostage episode are closely par
alleled by mistakes of Vietnam:
failure of political assessment,
failure to weigh consequences
of actions, and failure to meas
ure military power adequately
to requirements. Another great
lesson of Iran ought to have been
learned in Vietnam: the folly of
identifying the U.S. with partic
ular regimes and personalities
in the Third World.
In Iran as in Vietnam, the U.S.
received the blame for all the
mistakes or vices of the regimes
that appeared to be its puppets.
It is often urged that the U.S.
should not be too closely aligned
with dictatorships, but the bet
ter principle is that this country
should not identify itself with
any government or leader, re
gardless of its or his qualities.
Popular rulers become un
popular — the shah was once
quite popular — and capable
governments become in

capable, and they fall not so
much because they are evil as
because they are weak. The
Somoza regime, for example,
like that of the shah, fell not be
cause it was cruel but because it
became excessively corrupt and
incompetent.
The only sound approach for
the U.S. is to maintain reason
able distance and impartiality.
This is obvious in regard to a bad
government, but it is also true of
a good one. The good govern
ment does not need to have Un
cle Sam standing visibly behind
it, and to rely on the big foreign
power would only weaken it in
the long term.
A still broader principle be
came woefully apparent in the
prolonged hostage crisis: we do
not come near understanding
the mentality of some, perhaps
most, Third World leaders.
From the point of view of our ra
tionality, they may be sadly ir
rational. In modern Western
terms, many of them are pro
foundly ignorant; thus, the for
mal education of the Iranian
"militants" consisted chiefly of
reading the Koran and commen
taries.
Third World leaders are prob
ably quite as intelligent as in
habitants of Washington, but we
cannot count on their reacting
sensibly as we view the world —
and this applies to Soviet lead
ers as well. We do not com
prehend their rejection of our

values, their defensiveness, and
their emotionalism. We must
also assume if they talk sensibly
(in our terms) it may be more or
less because they have learned
what pleases us or moves us to
accept their wishes.
That we do not share their
values is further reason to avoid
meddling in the politics of Third
World countries. We do not
know what institutions they
need, and even our advocacy of
democracy and human rights
may be suspect. They have
basically to solve their own
problems. This does not mean,
of course, that we cannot help;
but the Iranian drama merely
shows that help should not be in
terference.
Finally, we ought to have
learned that we do not really
know how to deal with the Third
World. We do not know the long
term effect of actions or the re
sults, for example, of foreign
aid: witness the fact that a very
few years ago the shah's Iran,
with an annual GNP growth rate
of 20 percent and all manner of
admirable programs, was con
sidered a model for develop
ment and modernization. To try
to lead very different peoples
with values very different from
our own along paths that we find
proper is to invite trouble.
