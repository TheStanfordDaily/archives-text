# Management policies, low morale mean trouble for Plant, uh, Facilities Dept.

Incompetence, poor communica
tion and waste are causing low morale
in the University's Department of Fa
cilities and Services, according to em
ployees and officials there. These inci
dents illustrate some of the problems
employees have encountered:

News analysis

— In 1976. Facilities and Services
hired a firm of "efficiency experts" to
redesign the grounds crews' sched
ule. On the one day that the experts ob
served the grounds crews, one of the
Cushman vehicles was taken to Opera
tions and Maintenance's service sta
tion to have its brake fluid cheeked
a task i- : - pc formed onct a month
at most When at last the efficiency
experts presented their revised sched
ule. 15 minutes of each day had been
carefully set aside for checking each
Cushman's brake fluid
— Paul Mezzopelle worked for the
department for 20 years as a sheet
metal estimate coordinator. During
this time he says he was promoted and
demoted three times, each time to
make room for a supervisor from
"outside." Finally Mezzopelle and
friends in similar positions got fed up
and decided to form an informal club
"We all just kept going up and down,
up and down." he said, "so I decided to
organize." The club was dubbed the
"Yo-Yo Club."
— The walls inside the Operations
and Maintenance division building of
the department have been under peri
odic construction for almost five
years. They have been torn down, re
built. torn down again and rehuilt in
new places again By now it has be
come a standard joke among employ
ees there: how. they reason, can Fa
cilities and Services be responsible for
Stanford's physical environment if it
can't even arrange its own walls?
Stories like this are common at Fa
cilities and Services They are so com
mon in fact, that they are told not
with outrage, but will dull amusement
and nonchalance. They are, according
to employees, typical of the incom

pctencc. bureaucracy and waste that
characterize Facilities and Services.
"I mean, just look at the name."
said Mezzopelle. "They've changed it
more than you change diapers on a
babv " (Former names for Facilities
and Services include the "Corp
Yard." "Plant Services" and most re
cently. "Service Operations." "Call it
what you like." Mezzopelle said
"This place was set up to examine the
Peter Principle "
As caretaker of Stanford's physical
environment. Facilities and Services
is the right arm of the University. Its
seven divisions, which include every
thing from Food Services to Utilities,
perform those tasks that aie seen but
rarely noticed. They water lawns, re
pair walls, monitor utilities, purchase
supplies, locate new dormitories and
i 'in the old ones.
It's a big job This year Facilities
and Services will care for approx
imately nine million square feet of
campus buildings, employ some 600
people, and spend almost $14 million
over half of which comes from stu
dent tuition fees.
"It's a terrifically difficult job that
they do." said University Ombudsman
John Goheen. "And they do a good job.
considering."
Nevertheless. Goheen reports that
he has been receiving an unusually
large number of complaints from Fa
cilities and Services employees "We
received a flurry of complaints at one
point during this academic year." he
said "There seems to be a continuing
concern among employees there."
Complaints generally involve one of
three problems: incompetent super
visors. underemployment, and poor
communication, either between man
agement and non-management or be
tween different divisions. All of these
complaints involve an inefficient use
of labor, which, at an average cost of
$25 per-man-hour including tools, is
Facilities and Services' biggest ex
pense.
According to Goheen. the largest
number of complaints he has received
concern "supervisory problems." One
of the roots of supervisory problems,
employees agree, is Facilities and
Services' growing practice of hiring

supervisors from outside, rather than
promoting those already in the
division.
It used to be that nearly all super
visors were promoted to that position
from lower positions. Now only about.
50 percent are promoted from within
According to Mezzopelle. this results
in incompetent supervisors and frus
trated employees.
"Morale is so damn low." he said
"People who've been here a long time
don't care, because Ihey don't thin!
they're going to get promoted."
Gary Cavazos. acting director of
Engineering, blames the trend on
technology. According to Cavazos. "It
used to be that the senior man in the
shop automatically became the super
visor Now." he said, "a supervisor
not only lias to be technically enmpi
tent but has to know something about

data processing and accounting as
well."
The department would "like to
bring them (the senior workmen) in
and train (hem on a computer termi
nal. but it doesn't always work." he
said.
Cavazos acknowledged that hiring
from outside has its drawbacks. "It's
unfortunate but not unexpected that
supervisors now know less than the
senior person in the shop." he said
Gareth Hansen, a graphics techni
cian in the Utilities' division, said he
has come across that situation many
times, and finds it outrageous. "They
hire these people and turn them out to
do a job. but they don't know the work,
so they have to have someone who's
been there a while to go with them,"
he said. "Then you're paying for two
men to do the job of one."
Showing the boss what to do might not be such a problem
if the boss stayed around for a long time. But management
employees seem to stay for shorter lengths of time in one
position than do non-management employees.
Jason Mavis, director of facilities and Services, ac
counts for this by discussing ambition "It's really hard to
keep people during their strongest promotional years —
from 35 to 45 — if positions don't open up to give them pro
motional opportunities," he said. "We've probably trained
some of the best compensational analysts in the private
corporations in this area." he explained. "As they get con
fident, they move on."
Skilled and unskilled laborers, on the other hand, are
less eager to leave because of the wage increases and ben
efits that accrue after a few years, according to John
Listinsky, an official with United Stanford Employees
"Mobility at the lower end of the wage scale is always a lot
less than at the top." he said The result i« tension between
management and labor.
"Goheen (the ombudsman) blames our problems on
non-adjustment to new management." said John New
comb, once employed by the Utilities Division. "Well hell.
I've been working here 20 years, and they're always chang
ing management.' Hansen concluded, "We've been run
ning this place for so long that we don't need bosses." ne

pense.
According to Goheen. the largest
number of complaints he has received
concern "supervisory problems." One
of the roots of supervisory problems,
employees agree, is Facilities and
Services' growing practice of hiring

supervisors from outside, rather than
promoting those already in the
division.
It used to be that nearly all super
visors were promoted to that position
from lower positions. Now only about.
50 percent are promoted from within
According to Mezzopelle. this results
in incompetent supervisors and frus
trated employees.
"Morale is so damn low." he said
"People who've been here a long time
don't care, because Ihey don't thin!
they're going to get promoted."
Gary Cavazos. acting director of
Engineering, blames the trend on
technology. According to Cavazos. "It
used to be that the senior man in the
shop automatically became the super
visor Now." he said, "a supervisor
not only lias to be technically enmpi
tent but has to know something about

data processing and accounting as
well."
The department would "like to
bring them (the senior workmen) in
and train (hem on a computer termi
nal. but it doesn't always work." he
said.
Cavazos acknowledged that hiring
from outside has its drawbacks. "It's
unfortunate but not unexpected that
supervisors now know less than the
senior person in the shop." he said
Gareth Hansen, a graphics techni
cian in the Utilities' division, said he
has come across that situation many
times, and finds it outrageous. "They
hire these people and turn them out to
do a job. but they don't know the work,
so they have to have someone who's
been there a while to go with them,"
he said. "Then you're paying for two
men to do the job of one."
Showing the boss what to do might not be such a problem
if the boss stayed around for a long time. But management
employees seem to stay for shorter lengths of time in one
position than do non-management employees.
Jason Mavis, director of facilities and Services, ac
counts for this by discussing ambition "It's really hard to
keep people during their strongest promotional years —
from 35 to 45 — if positions don't open up to give them pro
motional opportunities," he said. "We've probably trained
some of the best compensational analysts in the private
corporations in this area." he explained. "As they get con
fident, they move on."
Skilled and unskilled laborers, on the other hand, are
less eager to leave because of the wage increases and ben
efits that accrue after a few years, according to John
Listinsky, an official with United Stanford Employees
"Mobility at the lower end of the wage scale is always a lot
less than at the top." he said The result i« tension between
management and labor.
"Goheen (the ombudsman) blames our problems on
non-adjustment to new management." said John New
comb, once employed by the Utilities Division. "Well hell.
I've been working here 20 years, and they're always chang
ing management.' Hansen concluded, "We've been run
ning this place for so long that we don't need bosses." ne
said.
Incompetence, poor communica

in the University's Department of Fa

ployees and officials there. These inci

employees have encountered:
