## Haig brings realistic outlook 
### 
The role of Secretary of State
requires experience, leader
ship, and a proper view of the
balance between military force
and diplomacy in articulating
and executing U.S. foreign poli
cy. We believe that Alexander
Haig more than fulfills these re
quirements; therefore we take
issue with the recent editorial
(Daily, January 23) entitled,
"Wrong Man for the Job."
The Daily questions the "wis
dom '' of choosing Haig as Secre
tary of State. They feel that he
will be unable to "utilize all the
tools of diplomacy," that he
may resort to military force
other than as a last resort, and
that he may lack the proper
moral judgment in conducting
foreign policy. We believe that
Alexander Haig's long record of
accomplishment testifies to the
opposite.
As evidenced in the recent
Senate confirmation hearings,
many liberals, notably Senators
Sarbanes, Tsongas, and
Weicker, have questioned
Haig's role in Watergate in or
der to challenge the character
of his moral judgment. The
fact is, that as President Nix
on's Chief of Staff in the darkest
days of Watergate, Haig vir
tually ran the government at a
time when our nation was in
danger of collapsing. It may
have been predicted by some at
the time that Haig in this posi
tion of power, would have, being
a military man, abused his au
thority. He did not.
As Nixon's Chief of Staff,
Haig was much less author
itarian than his pedecessors,
Haldeman and Erlichman. In
fact, he created an atmosphere
for a smooth transition of power
between Richard Nixon and
Gerald Ford.
As far as morality is con
cerned, Leon Jaworski, former
special prosecutor in the Water
gate case, in his book, The Right
and the Power, has completely
exonerated him from any wrong
doing. Jaworski described Haig
as a "tough, but ethical ad
versary", and he now believes
that he would have behaved no
differently than Haig did at the
time.
The job of Secretary of State
involves an ability to exercise
persuasive diplomatic and mili
tary proficiency required for
the post. These same European
leaders were at first skeptical of
his appointment to the top
NATO post. Now, they anxious
ly await his conduct of U.S. for
eign policy. As a result of his
NATO experience, Haig has
come to know the leaders of
Western Europe well, and his
accomplishments there are
proof that he is a skillful
diplomat, adept for the role of
America's top foreign policy
spokesman
Those who are unsure of the
soundness of having a military
man as Secretary of State need
only remember George
Marshall, one of the most suc
cessful men to hold the office.
His brilliance was evidenced in

the compassionate and prudent
Marshall Plan, and in his re
alistic view of the Soviet Union
in the form of the Truman Doc
trine.
The Daily refers to Haig as
"having consistently demon
strated that he believes in the
indiscriminate threat and use of
(military) force." We believe
that a phrase such as the "in
discriminate" use of force
should not be applied to Haig; in
fact, looking realistically at to
day's world, it can only be ap
plied to the Soviet Union. With
regard to Haig considering the
Third World to be merely
"pawns in an American re
alpolitik chess game with the
Soviets," the Daily fails to see
the reality of today's
geopolitical world. The Soviets,
as evidenced by their ag
gressive actions in Angola,
Mozambique, Ethiopia, South
Yemen, Vietnam, Cambodia
and Afghanistan, are clearly
taking the role of a belligerent
"Queen" in their own real
politik chess game. The
U.S.S R. is sending their Cuban
proxy "rooks" into the Third
World with the intention of car
rying out aggression and creat
ing instability. In the true con
text. the Third World nations
are not pawns in an American
chess game â€” they are Soviet
pawns in a Soviet chess game.
Like it or not, this chess game
of realistic world politics will
continue to be played. Over the
past four years, however, only

the Soviets have been playing.
With Alexander Haig as Secre
tary of State, Moscow will soon
realize that they will not be
playing this chess game along.
The Carter-Vance years have
shown that downgrading the im
portance of military force as an
instrument of diplomacy in the
realm of superpower relations
has resulted in Soviet troops in
Cuba and Afghanistan, the
fiasco in Iran, Cuban proxies in
the Third World, and the dan
gerous loss of respect for Amer
ica by both allies and ad
versaries. While recognizing
that military force should be
used only as a last resort, the
U.S.S.R. must be made aware
that this last resort can be, and
will be if necessary, a credible
U.S. response. History has
shown that weakness invites
war, and strength in both
diplomacy and military
capability promotes deter
rence.
While it is both fashionable
and chic to take the Doonesbury
liberal, anti-Reagan, anti-Haig
position at Stanford, people
must take into account the true
facts. Alexander Haig's ap
pointment to the office of Secre
tary of State has given to the
State Department a man who
possesses a realistic outlook of
today's complex world situ
ation.
