## Pentagon plans global tit-for-tat 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The United
States should serve notice that a
Soviet thrust in a distant part of
the world may be parried, not
only on the spot, but also in other
regions where American forces
have the advantage, Gen. David
Jones, chairman of the Pen
tagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said Wednesday.
Jones advocated this global
retaliatory policy in acknowl
edging to the Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee that the Unit
ed States is not strong enough
today to repel a Soviet invasion
of Iran.
"We should respond there,"
he said of Iran, but we should
also "keep them uncertain
where else we might re
spond. . . . They shouldn't feel
there's no other risk around the
world."
Jones would not say where the
United States might retaliate
for an attack in the Persian
Gulf, but he indicated it might
try to sink the Soviet navy.
Another U.S. military leader
recently said that the United
States might have to sacrifice
its 82nd Airborne Division to
make a stand against superior

Soviet forces in the Persian Gulf
but could retaliate by smashing
the Russian brigade in Cuba.
Escalate
If President Ronald Reagan
formalizes Jones' military ad
vice into national policy, any
U.S.-Soviet military confronta
tion in one place could generate
another thousands of miles
away. Jones believes such a
global tit-for-tat policy would
help deter the Soviets from
moving against American in
terests in the first place.
Army Gen. Volney Warner,
commander of the U.S. Read
iness Command headquartered
at Mac Dill Air Force Base at
Tampa, Fla., told The Wash
ington Post in October that the
82nd Airborne Division and a
Marine brigade would not be
"too big a force to lose" to make
a stand against the Soviets in the
Persian Gulf.
"I'm not sure," Warner re
plied when asked if such a loss of
American troops would not lead
to World War 111. The American
people, he said, "might say:
'Let's go drown the Soviet
brigade in Cuba.' . . . The aver
age American is just as damn
bloodthirsty, if not more so,

than anybody else in the world."
Jones' tough talk about re
taliating against the Soviets
comes as some conservatives
are pressing Reagan to fire him
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs
rather than let him serve out the
remaining 18 months of his
term.
Raise military budget
Jones and Secretary of De
fense Caspar Weinberger sat
side by side at the committee
witness table Wednesday in this
first joint appearance. Wein
berger said he was still review
ing the fiscal 1981 and 1982 de
fense budgets left him by the
Carter administration and had
not decided how much they
should be raised.
"They are underfunded,"
Weinberger said, partly be
cause they assume un
realistically low rates of infla
tion. He said he will recommend
"substantial" additions to Rea
gan, predicting the adminis
tration's revised defense budget
totals would go to Congress by
Feb. 26..
The additions, Weinberger
said, would finance higher prod
uction rates of weaponry, espe
cially aircraft, and would make

up for the gap created by under
estimating inflation.
Surveying the government's
entire budget landscape, Wein
berger said some non-defense
programs "that have been con
sidered sacrosanct'' will have to
be cut and others eliminated to
prevent "a ruinous amount of
inflation. . . . Are anti-poverty
programs reducing poverty or
are they enriching consul
tants?" Weinberger said that is
one of many questions that must
be addressed as the Reagan ad
ministration reviews "the
whole priorities of the nation."
Weinberger said at his con
firmation hearing and again
Wednesday that he opposes fix
ed percentage increases in de
fense spending, a position that
drew private protests from Pen
tagon professionals.
Asked Wednesday if he is will
ing to settle for the yearly in
creases of less than 3 percent af
ter inflation pledged by North
Atlantic Treaty Organization
countries, Weinberger said that
is not his intent. "I hope we and
our allies make substantial in
creases," he said, still steering
clear of any fixed percentage.

vice into national policy, any
U.S.-Soviet military confronta
tion in one place could generate
another thousands of miles
away. Jones believes such a
global tit-for-tat policy would
help deter the Soviets from
moving against American in
terests in the first place.
Army Gen. Volney Warner,
commander of the U.S. Read
iness Command headquartered
at Mac Dill Air Force Base at
Tampa, Fla., told The Wash
ington Post in October that the
82nd Airborne Division and a
Marine brigade would not be
"too big a force to lose" to make
a stand against the Soviets in the
Persian Gulf.
"I'm not sure," Warner re
plied when asked if such a loss of
American troops would not lead
to World War 111. The American
people, he said, "might say:
'Let's go drown the Soviet
brigade in Cuba.' . . . The aver
age American is just as damn
bloodthirsty, if not more so,

than anybody else in the world."
Jones' tough talk about re
taliating against the Soviets
comes as some conservatives
are pressing Reagan to fire him
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs
rather than let him serve out the
remaining 18 months of his
term.
Raise military budget
Jones and Secretary of De
fense Caspar Weinberger sat
side by side at the committee
witness table Wednesday in this
first joint appearance. Wein
berger said he was still review
ing the fiscal 1981 and 1982 de
fense budgets left him by the
Carter administration and had
not decided how much they
should be raised.
"They are underfunded,"
Weinberger said, partly be
cause they assume un
realistically low rates of infla
tion. He said he will recommend
"substantial" additions to Rea
gan, predicting the adminis
tration's revised defense budget
totals would go to Congress by
Feb. 26..
The additions, Weinberger
said, would finance higher prod
uction rates of weaponry, espe
cially aircraft, and would make

up for the gap created by under
estimating inflation.
Surveying the government's
entire budget landscape, Wein
berger said some non-defense
programs "that have been con
sidered sacrosanct'' will have to
be cut and others eliminated to
prevent "a ruinous amount of
inflation. . . . Are anti-poverty
programs reducing poverty or
are they enriching consul
tants?" Weinberger said that is
one of many questions that must
be addressed as the Reagan ad
ministration reviews "the
whole priorities of the nation."
Weinberger said at his con
firmation hearing and again
Wednesday that he opposes fix
ed percentage increases in de
fense spending, a position that
drew private protests from Pen
tagon professionals.
Asked Wednesday if he is will
ing to settle for the yearly in
creases of less than 3 percent af
ter inflation pledged by North
Atlantic Treaty Organization
countries, Weinberger said that
is not his intent. "I hope we and
our allies make substantial in
creases," he said, still steering
clear of any fixed percentage.
Washington — The United
States should serve notice that a
Soviet thrust in a distant part of
the world may be parried, not
only on the spot, but also in other
regions where American forces
have the advantage, Gen. David
Jones, chairman of the Pen
tagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said Wednesday.
Jones advocated this global
retaliatory policy in acknowl
edging to the Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee that the Unit
ed States is not strong enough
today to repel a Soviet invasion
of Iran.
"We should respond there,"
he said of Iran, but we should
also "keep them uncertain
where else we might re
spond. . . . They shouldn't feel
there's no other risk around the
world."
Jones would not say where the
United States might retaliate
for an attack in the Persian
Gulf, but he indicated it might
try to sink the Soviet navy.
Another U.S. military leader
recently said that the United
States might have to sacrifice
its 82nd Airborne Division to
make a stand against superior

Soviet forces in the Persian Gulf
but could retaliate by smashing
the Russian brigade in Cuba.
Escalate
If President Ronald Reagan
formalizes Jones' military ad
vice into national policy, any
U.S.-Soviet military confronta
tion in one place could generate
another thousands of miles
away. Jones believes such a
global tit-for-tat policy would
help deter the Soviets from
moving against American in
terests in the first place.
