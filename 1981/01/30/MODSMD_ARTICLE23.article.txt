# Sex bias in workplace decried
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)
and Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) longtime op
ponents on social legislation, agreed Wednes
day that women suffer massive job dis
crimination but disagreed on the importance
of the controversial Equal Rights Amendment
in reversing the situation.
Kennedy, a supporter of ERA, called sex dis
crimination in jobs "a pervasive social and ec
onomic evil which appears to be spreading
rather than receding."
Hatch, who opposes ERA, said it was abhor
rent that "some women are subjected to vari
ous forms of sexual harassment in order to ob
tain, keep or advance in their jobs."
The two senators were joined in their
assessments at a Senate Labor and Human Re
sources Committee hearing by represent
atives of a dozen groups who testified that the
nation's 45 million working women — 34
percent of the fulltime work force — often are
paid less than men for doing the same work.
Eleanor Smeal, president of the National Or
ganization for Women, cited Department of
Labor statistics showing that women are paid
59 cents for every dollar paid men. She said job
bias was "so rampant and severe" that it
should be called "sex segregation" instead of
"sex discrimination."
A staunch advocate of the ERA proposal,

which would make it unlawful to discriminate
because of sex, Smeal reaffirmed her or
ganization's support for the pending bill and
said "piecemeal legislation is not the answer."
However, Hatch, the committee chairman,
said that some 30 statutes already in force
could protect the rights of women. He said he
would work to enforce those laws, which in
clude the Equal Pay Act, the Fair Labor Stan
dards Act and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act, "whether or not the ERA passes by June
of 1982," the date by which three more states
must ratify the amendment to make it law.
Kennedy took a different tack, asking wit
nesses whether their constituents valued ERA
as a tool to eliminate discrimination. At one
point Kennedy said that "powerful forces in
this city" are pushing to slow down equal em
ployment efforts, an apparent reference to
moves by Republican senators who have
voiced plans to eliminate "affirmative action"
employment programs.
Most witnesses representing the women's
groups agreed that ERA would be useful in
helping their cause, but said that enforcement
of existing laws also was essential.
The witnesses called for special training
programs for women, tax incentives for busi
nesses that provide jobs for women, and day
care facilities at job sites.
