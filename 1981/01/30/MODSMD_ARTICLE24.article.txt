# Gas deregulation, OPEC hikes boost food prices
## 
### 
Kansas City, Mo. (AP) — American
farmers, beset by 20 percent interest rates
and roller-coaster grain prices sparked by the
Soviet grain embargo, are about to take anoth
er blow — in the gas tank.
A U.S. Department of Agriculture econo
mist predicted yesterday that regular
gasoline would be selling for $1.50 to $1.70 a
gallon by the end of 1981 — a hike of 25 to 40
percent over current prices.
"The effect on net farm income is any
body's guess," said Tom Lutton of the USDA
energy research group at its National Eco
nomics Division in Washington.
"All I know is that some guys are going to be
put in a terrible squeeze. There could be a lot
of farmers going out of business this year be
cause they don't have the money up front."
And the harried consumer?
"In terms of actual cost of production,
energy is a very small portion," Lutton said.
"When you consider the cost of production
through the entire food chain (from planting
the crop to selling it at the supermarket),
energy accounts for only 2 percent of the cost.
Even if the price of gas and diesel fuel goes up
50 percent, that would mean only a 3 percent

increase."
Then no big deal, right?
Wrong, Lutton said.
"The supermarket people and others
through the food chain see this (fuel) increase
and they automatically say, 'We've got to
raise prices.' We see an awful lot of price
gouging going on (in situations like this)."
But the cost of energy is a different story
down on the farm.
Lutton said energy makes up 10 percent of
the cost of operating a farm. He said many
farmers won't feel the pinch immediately be
cause they've stockpiled fuel for spring plant
ing. But summer and fall harvests are a dif
ferent story.
Unlike some previous years, there will be
plenty of fuel available — "if you can afford
it," Lutton said.
The Kansas Energy Office said 72,000
farmers in the nation's largest wheat produc
ing state used 280 million gallons of fuel in
1980, costing about $3900 per farm. Decontrol
and price increases by the Organization of Pe
troleum Exporting Countries will likely add
another $1000 to that tab this year, according
to Lutton's projections.

The immediate decontrol measure which
President Ronald Reagan endorsed Wednes
day will increase prices five to eight cents a
gallon this year, Lutton said, with OPEC hikes
responsible for the rest.
The decontrol increase was coming any
way, under phased decontrol signed by former
President Jimmy Carter. But fuel users are
picking up the costs in one lump, rather than in
pieces from now through September, when de
control was orginally scheduled to be com
pleted.
Lutton said the USDA's "best guess
scenario" is that gasoline prices would have
been $1.45 to $1.62 by the end of 1981 without
decontrol, $1.50 to $1.70 with it.
"It will compound our escalating inflation
costs," said one farmer from St. John. Kan.
"We're selling below the cost of production
now and there's no escalator clause in our
commodity prices."
Norman Grubbs, a Hugoton, Kan., wheat
farmer, agreed the hike will hurt. "It's better
to do that (decontrol prices) than have a con
flict in the Middle East and not have any
(oil)."
Marvin Duncan, an economist with the Fed

eral Reserve Bank in Kansas City, said yes
terday he was sticking with previous predic
tions that food prices would rise 12 to 15
percent in 1981, compared to 9 percent in 1980.
He said agricultural interests have known
"decontrol was coming down the pike any
way" and Wednesday's action will prompt
new economy measures on the farm. He fore
cast that farmers would cut back on use of ma
chinery such as "not tilling the ground as in
tensively before he plants a new crop."
Lutton agreed that the farmer who looks for
shortcuts will be the one to survive higher fuel
prices:
"If farmers can't think about less fuel-in
tensive operations like minimum tillage or
planting crops that don't need as much cul
tivation, they're going to be in trouble unless
the (commodity) prices offset the higher cost
of fuel."
Duncan said he expected many farmers to
cut back on irrigation because the pumps re
quire fuel, and such a move might mean
changing to crops that need less water.
"The farmer in Nebraska may shift from
alfalfa," Duncan said.
