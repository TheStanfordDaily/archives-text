# DiBiaso hints at lineup changes
## Troubled Arizona, troubling ASU visit 
### Chris Haft 
The names and faces change,
but the story doesn't. Come the
Pacific-10 Conference season,
Stanford's men's basketball
squad invariably plays teams
that possess more physical tal
ent week after week. Tonight's
game against Arizona at Maples
Pavilion and tomorrow eve
ning's home encounter with No.
5 Arizona State are only con
tinuations of this season-long
saga.
"It looks as though all the
teams have more quickness and
full-court speed than we do," a
realistic Cardinal head coach
Dick Dißiaso said.
Dißiaso said he might al
ter his starting lineup slightly in
an attempt to counteract these
differences. Educated guessers
would assume that Hans
Wichary would start at center,
moving John Revelli to forward
and Jeff Ryan to the bench. The
possibility also exists that Doug
Marty, who has endured
ballhandling woes lately, might
be replaced at guard.
"I don't know yet," Dißiaso
replied when asked before yes
terday's practice what the
changes will be. "This is kind of
like the CIA, isn't it?"
It doesn't require any detec
tive work, however, to see that
Stanford equals Arizona in one
important category: con
ference victories. Both the
Cards (6-10 overall) and the
Wildcats (7-9) own 2-5 Pac-10 re
cords, tying them along with
California and Oregon for sixth

place.
Yet Arizona's recent exploits
would probably interest most
"private eyes". Two months
ago, the San Francisco Chroni
cle mentioned that head coach
Fred Snowden was being in
vestigated by the state and the
University's security system
for allegedly pocketing meal
money. These charges stem
from accusations made by
Michael Zeno, a former Wildcat
player.
The investigations regarding
Snowden, nicknamed "The
Fox," are still pending. How
ever, a reliable source told the
Daily yesterday that Snowden s
fate is sealed. "He's done," the
source said.
The same Chronicle article
also extensively described a
fight during practice between
forward Greg Cook and center
David Mosebar that caused
their ejection from the team.
Despite the disruptive at
mosphere, the Wildcats still re
tain a presentable starting line
up: 6-foot-7 forward and leading
scorer Ron Davis (16.9 points
per game), skinny 6-foot-10 cen
ter Frank Smith (14.3), forward
Robbie Dosty (10.7), colorfully
named guard John Smith (10.3)
and passing expert Russell
Brown (5.3 assists per game).
Everything is milk and honey
and high rankings for Arizona
State, though. One of three con
ference teams in The As
sociated l*ress' Top 10 (Oregon
State is No. 1 and UCLA is No.
10), the Sun Devils are 6-1 in

Pac-10 action, 14-2 overall and
impressive at every position.
One starting guard, Lafayette
Lever, leads the conference in
steals and assists. The other
backcourt starter, Byron Scott,
was regarded as one of the con
ference's best freshmen a year

ago and now averages 14.8
points a game. Seniors Sam Wil
liams and Johnny Nash give
head coach Ned Wulk ex
perience and strength at for
ward.
Alton Lister, the Sun Devils'
7-foot center, suffered sprained
ligaments in his right knee dur

ing ASU's 78-74 triple-overtime
victory over UCLA and has
missed the last two games. Ob
viously, the Sun Devils could use
Lister's height and his 15.0
points and 9.1 rebounds a game,
but if he cannot play against
Stanford, Sam Williams will
move to center and Paul Wil
liams will start at forward.
Whoever plays the pivot
makes no difference to Dißiaso.
"(Sam) Williams hasn't exactly
been non-existent," the sixth
year coach said. "They're still
big. They rebound extremely
well." In fact, the Sun Devils
lead the conference in rebound
ing with 43.5 per game.
The Cards' only hope is to
take advantage of their con
ference-leading free-throw
shooting by getting ASU in foul
trouble.
Trouble is what last week
end's games in Los Angeles
were full of. Considering Stan
ford's two big losses — 85-58 to
UCLA and 89-64 to USC — one
would believe the Cards suf
fered a regression.
"It was a depression,"
Dißiaso said. "Against UCLA I
sort of blocked that out, but
against USC I was disappointed
in our play. We had so many
turnovers in the first half (15)
we didn't give ourselves a
chance to win. I don't think we
played as hard as we normally
play, we certainly didn't play as
well, and we looked tired."
If the Cards are at all tired
again, this weekend's story will
be the same as last week's.
