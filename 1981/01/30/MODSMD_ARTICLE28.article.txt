# All-too-typical loss for Stanford, 60-54
## 
### Bill Beyda 
In what has become all too
typical for the women's basket
ball team, the Santa Clara Bron
cos beat Stanford 63-54 Wednes
day night at Maples Pavilion.
The loss, the Cards' third disap
pointment in a row, puts their
NorCal Conference record at
1-4, which all but eliminates
them as an WAIAW Regional
hopeful for the first time in the
last four seasons.
It was the same old script for
Stanford. The Cards played
evenly with the Broncos the en
tire game, except for a four
minute stretch where the Cards
went scoreless and committed
many turnovers. The Cards

dropped from a 12-12 tie to a
24-12 deficit in the first half, and
then played evenly for the re
mainder of the half. Santa Clara
was up 30-18 at the intermission.
"We have to play 40
minutes," said Stanford coach
Dotty McCrea after the game.
"We're a better team then they
are. Our shots didn't fall for us,
and we were careless."
Santa Clara coach Ken
Thompson said, "We won with
our consistent shooting." The
Broncos are a short team, with
only three six-footers, com
pared to Stanford's six. The
Broncos' shooting is far from
classical in style, but the shots
went in for them Wednesday
night.
Both teams excited the
Maples Pavilion crowd with
some fancy maneuvers. Early
in the first half, Stanford's Meg
Metzger drove down the
baseline, passed the basket, and
shot an over-the-shoulder layup,
the shot made popular by
Bill Bradley when he played at
Priceton and later with the New
York Knicks. .
The loss gives the Cards a
10-11 record overall. Their next
game is the front half of a
doubleheader with the men's
team tonight at Maples, when
the women will play Fresno
State at 5:15, followed by the
men's game against Arizona.
