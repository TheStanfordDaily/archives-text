# At first press conference
## Reagan heats up rhetoric against Soviets 
### 
From The Los Angeles Times
Washington — In the harshest cold
war attack to come from the White
House in two decades. President
Ronald Reagan accused the Soviet 1 n
ion yesterday of reserving the right
"to commit any crime, to lie. to
cheat" in a persistent campaign to
promote global revolution and a one
world Communist state.
Such Soviet goals and activities
should be taken into account by the
United States when negotiating with
Moscow on arms limitations or other
matters, he said.
In his first news conference since
taking office nine days ago. the presi
dent. asked if he thought detente was
possible or if he believes the Soviets
are bent on world domination, de
clared:
"Well, so far detente's been a one
way street that the Soviet Union has
used to pursue its own aims I don't
have to think of an answer as to what I
think their intentions are They have
repeated it.
"I know of no leader of the Soviet

Union since the revolution and includ
ing the present leadership that has not
more than once repeated . their de
termination that their goal must be
the promotion of world revolution and
a one-world socialist or communist
state."
Not since President .John Kennedy
assailed the Soviet Union in 1961.
charging that the Berlin "crisis" was
Soviet-manufactured, has an Ameri
can president taken such a hard anti-
Soviet line.
Other stern action
In another step designed to signal a
new. sterner attitude, the State De
partment revoked the privilege Soviet
Ambassador Anatolv Dobrynin has en
joyed — alone among envoys here — of
being able to drive directly into the de
partment's underground garage and
thus escape public notice, instead of
having to use the public entrance.
Haig approved cancellation of the
privilege, which had been granted by
Henry Kissinger in the early 1970s
when he was secretary of state, be
cause the present administration has

derided that Dobrynin should be
treated like other diplomats, an ad
ministration official said
The Soviet Embassy had been told
of the decision, but yesterday evening
Dobrynin's car tried to enter the un
derground garage as usual It was
turned back by a security guard
'Quiet and orderly'
For a presidential press con
ference. yesterday's session was un
usually quiet and orderly. White
House officials had said they planned
to experiment with several new pro
cedures to make press conferences
more meaningful for the press and the
president.
They decreed before the conference
started that the traditional pattern of
reporters jumping up and shouting for
recognition would not be permitted
Instead, reporters remained seated
and gained the president's attention
by raising their hands, the system
Keagan used for press conferences
when he was governor of California
After opening the conference with
the announcement that he is moving to

abolish the Council on Wage and Price
Stability and that he has ordered a
freeze of 60 days on recently issued
regulations of some key federal agon
cies. Reagan said. "Now. I'll be happy
to answer your questions."
On the subject of future U.S.-Iran
relations. Reagan said his adminis
tration will honor the agreement with
Iran which led to the freeing of the
American hostages, but is still study
ing the agreement because it is "a
pretty complex matter with re
gard to whether it is in keeping with in
ternational and U.S. laws."
Revenge issues
He also said he is not thinking of re
venge against Iran, but does not
"know whether reconciliation would
be possible with the present govern
ment or absence of government in
Iran
"What good would just revenge do
and what form would that take" 1 " he
asked when pressed on why the United
States does not retaliate against Iran
"I ion't think revenge is worthy of us
