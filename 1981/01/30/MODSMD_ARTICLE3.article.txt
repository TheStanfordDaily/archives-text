# At first press conference
## Reagan heats up rhetoric against Soviets 
### 
From The Los Angeles Times
Washington — In the harshest cold
war attack to come from the White
House in two decades. President
Ronald Reagan accused the Soviet 1 n
ion yesterday of reserving the right
"to commit any crime, to lie. to
cheat" in a persistent campaign to
promote global revolution and a one
world Communist state.
Such Soviet goals and activities
should be taken into account by the
United States when negotiating with
Moscow on arms limitations or other
matters, he said.
In his first news conference since
taking office nine days ago. the presi
dent. asked if he thought detente was
possible or if he believes the Soviets
are bent on world domination, de
clared:
"Well, so far detente's been a one
way street that the Soviet Union has
used to pursue its own aims I don't
have to think of an answer as to what I
think their intentions are They have
repeated it.
"I know of no leader of the Soviet

Union since the revolution and includ
ing the present leadership that has not
more than once repeated . their de
termination that their goal must be
the promotion of world revolution and
a one-world socialist or communist
state."
Not since President .John Kennedy
assailed the Soviet Union in 1961.
charging that the Berlin "crisis" was
Soviet-manufactured, has an Ameri
can president taken such a hard anti-
Soviet line.
Other stern action
In another step designed to signal a
new. sterner attitude, the State De
partment revoked the privilege Soviet
Ambassador Anatolv Dobrynin has en
joyed — alone among envoys here — of
being able to drive directly into the de
partment's underground garage and
thus escape public notice, instead of
having to use the public entrance.
Haig approved cancellation of the
privilege, which had been granted by
Henry Kissinger in the early 1970s
when he was secretary of state, be
cause the present administration has

derided that Dobrynin should be
treated like other diplomats, an ad
ministration official said
The Soviet Embassy had been told
of the decision, but yesterday evening
Dobrynin's car tried to enter the un
derground garage as usual It was
turned back by a security guard
'Quiet and orderly'
For a presidential press con
ference. yesterday's session was un
usually quiet and orderly. White
House officials had said they planned
to experiment with several new pro
cedures to make press conferences
more meaningful for the press and the
president.
They decreed before the conference
started that the traditional pattern of
reporters jumping up and shouting for
recognition would not be permitted
Instead, reporters remained seated
and gained the president's attention
by raising their hands, the system
Keagan used for press conferences
when he was governor of California
After opening the conference with
the announcement that he is moving to

abolish the Council on Wage and Price
Stability and that he has ordered a
freeze of 60 days on recently issued
regulations of some key federal agon
cies. Reagan said. "Now. I'll be happy
to answer your questions."
On the subject of future U.S.-Iran
relations. Reagan said his adminis
tration will honor the agreement with
Iran which led to the freeing of the
American hostages, but is still study
ing the agreement because it is "a
pretty complex matter with re
gard to whether it is in keeping with in
ternational and U.S. laws."
Revenge issues
He also said he is not thinking of re
venge against Iran, but does not
"know whether reconciliation would
be possible with the present govern
ment or absence of government in
Iran
"What good would just revenge do
and what form would that take" 1 " he
asked when pressed on why the United
States does not retaliate against Iran
"I ion't think revenge is worthy of us
On the other hand. I don't think we act
as if this never happened "
The president declined to be specif
ic about his warning of swift and effec
tive retribution in future terrorist sit
uations. but did mention his concern
that in the past, terrorists have been
confident that "they can go to sleep,
wake up in the morning and the United
States will not have taken any action
"What I meant by that phrase was
that anyone who does these things, vi
olates our rights in the future, is not
going to be able to go to bed with that
confidence."
Personnel problems
Reagan sidestepped several ques
tions. and gave a half-joking reply to a

conservative commentator's pointed
query as to why he had named to top
positions a number of persons who had
not supported his candidacy, including
Frank Carlucci. deputy secretary of
defense, while failing to give major
positions to some of his staunch con
servative supporters.
The president said that the only
problem he found more difficult than
deriding which reporter to rail on at
the crowded news conference was the
difficulty he had in selecting per
sonnel. Some of the people who
worked for his election, he said,
"worked very hard and wanted noth
ing for it."
But. he added. "You also have to
recognize there aren't that many posi

tions. After all. look how many votes I
had You can't reward them all
Reagan, who strongly opposed the
SALT II treaty during the campaign,
said he was willing to have adminis
tration officials begin preliminary ne
gotiations with the Soviets aimed at
renewing strategic arms limitation
talks
But. he said. "I happen to believe
also that you ran t sit down at a table
and just negotiate unless you take
into account and consideration at that
tableall the other things that are going
on ." Reagan said the U.S. should be
wary because the Soviets "have open
ly and publicly declared that the only
morality they recognize is what will
further their cause "

freeze of 60 days on recently issued
regulations of some key federal agon
cies. Reagan said. "Now. I'll be happy
to answer your questions."
On the subject of future U.S.-Iran
relations. Reagan said his adminis
tration will honor the agreement with
Iran which led to the freeing of the
American hostages, but is still study
ing the agreement because it is "a
pretty complex matter with re
gard to whether it is in keeping with in
ternational and U.S. laws."
Revenge issues
He also said he is not thinking of re
venge against Iran, but does not
"know whether reconciliation would
be possible with the present govern
ment or absence of government in
Iran
"What good would just revenge do
and what form would that take" 1 " he
asked when pressed on why the United
States does not retaliate against Iran
"I ion't think revenge is worthy of us
On the other hand. I don't think we act
as if this never happened "
The president declined to be specif
ic about his warning of swift and effec
tive retribution in future terrorist sit
uations. but did mention his concern
that in the past, terrorists have been
confident that "they can go to sleep,
wake up in the morning and the United
States will not have taken any action
"What I meant by that phrase was
that anyone who does these things, vi
olates our rights in the future, is not
going to be able to go to bed with that
confidence."
Personnel problems
Reagan sidestepped several ques
tions. and gave a half-joking reply to a

conservative commentator's pointed
query as to why he had named to top
positions a number of persons who had
not supported his candidacy, including
Frank Carlucci. deputy secretary of
defense, while failing to give major
positions to some of his staunch con
servative supporters.
The president said that the only
problem he found more difficult than
deriding which reporter to rail on at
the crowded news conference was the
difficulty he had in selecting per
sonnel. Some of the people who
worked for his election, he said,
"worked very hard and wanted noth
ing for it."
But. he added. "You also have to
recognize there aren't that many posi

tions. After all. look how many votes I
had You can't reward them all
Reagan, who strongly opposed the
SALT II treaty during the campaign,
said he was willing to have adminis
tration officials begin preliminary ne
gotiations with the Soviets aimed at
renewing strategic arms limitation
talks
But. he said. "I happen to believe
also that you ran t sit down at a table
and just negotiate unless you take
into account and consideration at that
tableall the other things that are going
on ." Reagan said the U.S. should be
wary because the Soviets "have open
ly and publicly declared that the only
morality they recognize is what will
further their cause "
From The Los Angeles Times
Washington — In the harshest cold
war attack to come from the White
House in two decades. President
Ronald Reagan accused the Soviet 1 n
ion yesterday of reserving the right
"to commit any crime, to lie. to
cheat" in a persistent campaign to
promote global revolution and a one
world Communist state.
Such Soviet goals and activities
should be taken into account by the
United States when negotiating with
Moscow on arms limitations or other
matters, he said.
In his first news conference since
taking office nine days ago. the presi
dent. asked if he thought detente was
possible or if he believes the Soviets
are bent on world domination, de
clared:
"Well, so far detente's been a one
way street that the Soviet Union has
used to pursue its own aims I don't
have to think of an answer as to what I
think their intentions are They have
repeated it.
"I know of no leader of the Soviet

Union since the revolution and includ
ing the present leadership that has not
more than once repeated . their de
termination that their goal must be
the promotion of world revolution and
a one-world socialist or communist
state."
Not since President .John Kennedy
assailed the Soviet Union in 1961.
charging that the Berlin "crisis" was
Soviet-manufactured, has an Ameri
can president taken such a hard anti-
Soviet line.
Other stern action
In another step designed to signal a
new. sterner attitude, the State De
partment revoked the privilege Soviet
Ambassador Anatolv Dobrynin has en
joyed — alone among envoys here — of
being able to drive directly into the de
partment's underground garage and
thus escape public notice, instead of
having to use the public entrance.
Haig approved cancellation of the
privilege, which had been granted by
Henry Kissinger in the early 1970s
when he was secretary of state, be
cause the present administration has

derided that Dobrynin should be
treated like other diplomats, an ad
ministration official said
The Soviet Embassy had been told
of the decision, but yesterday evening
Dobrynin's car tried to enter the un
derground garage as usual It was
turned back by a security guard
'Quiet and orderly'
For a presidential press con
ference. yesterday's session was un
usually quiet and orderly. White
House officials had said they planned
to experiment with several new pro
cedures to make press conferences
more meaningful for the press and the
president.
They decreed before the conference
started that the traditional pattern of
reporters jumping up and shouting for
recognition would not be permitted
Instead, reporters remained seated
and gained the president's attention
by raising their hands, the system
Keagan used for press conferences
when he was governor of California
After opening the conference with
the announcement that he is moving to

abolish the Council on Wage and Price
Stability and that he has ordered a
freeze of 60 days on recently issued
regulations of some key federal agon
cies. Reagan said. "Now. I'll be happy
