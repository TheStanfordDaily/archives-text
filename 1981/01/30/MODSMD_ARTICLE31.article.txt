## NCAA appoints women to posts 
### 
Kansas City, Mo. (AP) —
Shattering 75 years of male
domination and setting in mo
tion a new era in collegiate ath
letics, the two highest-ranking
officers of the NCAA yesterday
appointed about 200 women to
powerful committee assign
ments.
Guaranteed female represen
tation on the various "standing
committees," such as the in
fractions, international rela
tions and post-season football
committees that govern the
venerable association were a
key part of a controversial gov
ernance package adopted by
NCAA members at their con
vention two weeks ago in Miami
Beach.
Jim Frank, president of Lin
coln University in Jefferson
City, Mo., and the president of
the NCAA, and John Toner, ath
letic director at Connecticut and
NCAA secretary-treasurer,
were set to make the appoint
ments in a mid-morning con
ference call.
Toner and Frank will also as
sign women to a number of
sports committees to admin
ister the women's cham
pionships in Division I schools
were adopted at the Miami con

vention.
"I don't know if we'll be able
to do a complete job on both,"
Toner told the Associated Press
Wednesday. "But the standing
committees ought to be done."
There will be no immediate
announcement of the appoint
ments. The women will be
notified by mail and asked to
confirm that they will serve.
For many of the women, com
mittee appointment will mean
tremendous career op
portunities as well as instant
prestige for their schools and
conferences.
"I know one thing," Toner
said, "we have to get these
things done as soon as possible,
and get them announced be
cause the whole intercollegiate
world is waiting. They need a
signal real quick. We're going to
work as quickly as possible to
get those things out."
The NCAA's entry into wom
en's athletics is bitterly opposed
by many factions, chiefly the
Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women. And Toner
indicated committee appoint
ments may be extended to
AIAW supporters who opposed
the women's programs at the
Miami convention.
