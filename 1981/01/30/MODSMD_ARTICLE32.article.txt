# Card nine opens here tomorrow

There is guarded optimism at
Sunken Diamond this year.
Mark Marquess has apparently
assembled a sound Cardinal
baseball team, but memories of
the inconsistency-filled 1980
season remain.
The Cards are somewhat of a
mystery team, but according to
Marquess, matters will be dif
ferent this season, beginning
tomorrow, when Stanford plays
host to UC-Davis in a noon
doubleheader.
"The team looks good this
year," Marquess said. "A ma
jor reason is that we started
four or five freshmen last sea
son and they are now a year
older and a year more ex
perienced."
Last year, the Cards jumped
to a 12-0 start and a national No.

1 ranking, but then things went
sour. The club finished 13-17 in
the Pacific-10 Conference's
Southern Division and 29-24 ov
erall.
Marquess said the sudden
change of fortune was almost
expected. "People may have
been deceived by it (the 12-0
start), but we certainly were
not," he said. "We knew we had
weaknesses, and league play is
completely different from pre
season play."
The Cards' league record in
cluded a 13-2 mark at home and
15 straight losses on the road.
Why the big difference? "I wish
1 knew," Marquess said. "It was
kind of a flukey thing. We're
usually even on the road and a
little above .500 at home."
One question that remains un
answered is the pitching, which

could improve somewhat. Mar
quess has three solid starters in
Brian Mignano, Paul Grame
and Lee Cline. As for the stopper
out of the bullpen, several can
didates exist, including senior
left-hander Bob Boatman and
junior side-armer Mike Sul
livan.
The Cards' mound staff
lacked depth a year ago, but an
influx of freshman hurlers —
Steve Cotirell, Doug Gwaltney
and Gregg Lomnicky — should
help alleviate that problem.
Offensively, this year's Cards
should display increased power.
"The great thing about our line
up is that everyone can hit the
ball out," Marquess said. "Eve
ryone should have at least four
or five homers by the end of the
season."
