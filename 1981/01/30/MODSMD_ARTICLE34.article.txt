# Cards head for gymnastic roundup
## 
### Dean Eyre 
In a gymnastics version of
"Urban Cowboy," Sadao
Hamada's men leave the Farm
for UC-Davis for a 7:30 p.m.
roundup with the Aggies tomor
row. The main difference in this
collegiate event is that the 20th
ranked Cardinals trade Gilley's
bar for parallel bars and there
are no mechanical bulls, only a
pommel horse.
According to Hamada, drama
in this production will be pro
vided more by improvement on
the part of the Stanford gym
nasts than by the competition
from Davis.
"They (Davis) had a meet, I
believe their first of the season
as a whole team, last Saturday
and they scored about 242, so we
are about 10 points ahead of
them right now," Hamada said.
"I'm not too worried about
whether it will be a win or a loss
— unless we do really badly,
we're not going to lose.
"But I am looking for a much
better (team) score than last
time. I'm hoping we can go pret
ty close to 260, " Hamada added,
which would be about an 8.7 av
erage for each of the top five
gymnasts whose score is
counted towards the team total.
In the official season-opener
against San Jose State Jan. 9,
Stanford tallied 253 points.
Hamada's goal for tomorrow

night's meet is to add at least
one point to each of the six
events of the meet.
"Some guys have picked up
the moves they need to make
their scores higher," Hamada
explained. "That should raise
the base score a little higher.
Plus we've improved our con
sistency a bit more."
Besides the overall improve
ment, the team goals include
raising scores in Stanford's two
weakest events, pommel horse
and parallel bars.
"Last meet we had close to a
nine-point average in four
events but pommel horse and
parallel bars were way down,"
said Hamada. "For example, on
pommel horse we had 37 points
(the team total of five individ
ual marks) which is not even an
8.0 average. So I hope we can
bring up those scores. Parallel
bars was a 39-point total, which
is also below an 8.0 average.''
Just because Stanford isn't
particularly worried about a
team threat from the Aggies
doesn't mean that the meet will
be a one-sided affair. Davis fans
will have plenty to cheer about
in the form of Chuck Gaylord,
their top all-around performer.
In last week's meet he scored 51
points, according to Hamada,
and "they have a couple of good
specialists in each event. I think
we're going to be better because

of our depth. "
Stanford's line-up includes
Mike Lee. JimCampanelli, Kirk
Druey and Brian Nelson in all
around competition. As in the
team portion of the meet,
Hamada gives the edge to his
athletes in the all-around de
partment.
"I think this time Mike and
Jim will go a lot higher — easily
50-plus points — and so should
Kirk and Brian." Hamada said.
Against San Jose State. Cam
panelli scored a 51.55 while
Druey hit 48 points and Nelson
scored 47.
Unlike their female coun
terparts, the men's squad has
been relatively free of injuries
so far this season. With the ex
ception of Rich Rosen, who is
out indefinitely with a bone chip
in one arm. most of the Card ail
ments are minor.
"No one is seriously hurt,"
said Hamada. "Mike has a sore
knee and back, but they're get
ting better. Craig (Goldman*
has a sore shoulder and back,
but its not critical where he
can't perform. Bela's (Matyas)
jammed finger is the biggest
concern right now.
"So far the training has been
going really well. The guys are
stronger and getting consistent,
especially the all-around guys,
who are improving at a tremen
dous rate. I think it will be a

very interesting meet just to
watch where some of my top
guys end up. I d like to see them
hit they're potential to get a
maximum score," added
Hamada.
A strong team performance
might help in improving upon
Stanford's fifth-place ranking in
the Pacific-10 Conference and
that 20th ranking in the most re
cent national rankings. The
Cards are also rated fifth in the
western region of the country.
Currently dominating the
Pac-10 ratings are UCLA, Ore
gon State, California and Arizo
na State.
"I'm pretty sure some of the
other schools may improve, but
we can be very competitive
against Arizona State and Cal,
even if they are 10 points ahead
of us," Hamada said. "I'm pret
ty sure that by the end of the sea
son we'll be very close to them. I
hope we can beat them."

Currently dominating the
Pac-10 ratings are UCLA, Ore

"I'm pretty sure some of the
other schools may improve, but
we can be very competitive
against Arizona State and Cal,
even if they are 10 points ahead
of us," Hamada said. "I'm pret
ty sure that by the end of the sea
son we'll be very close to them. I
hope we can beat them."

Jim Campanelli, competing here in last month's Mixed Pairs Invitational, is one of the Cardinals that
Sadao Hamada looks toward for improvement in tomorrow's meet at UC-Davis.
In a gymnastics version of
"Urban Cowboy," Sadao
Hamada's men leave the Farm
for UC-Davis for a 7:30 p.m.
roundup with the Aggies tomor
row. The main difference in this
collegiate event is that the 20th
ranked Cardinals trade Gilley's
bar for parallel bars and there
are no mechanical bulls, only a
pommel horse.
According to Hamada, drama
in this production will be pro
vided more by improvement on
the part of the Stanford gym
nasts than by the competition
from Davis.
"They (Davis) had a meet, I
believe their first of the season
as a whole team, last Saturday
and they scored about 242, so we
are about 10 points ahead of
them right now," Hamada said.
"I'm not too worried about
whether it will be a win or a loss
— unless we do really badly,
we're not going to lose.
"But I am looking for a much
better (team) score than last
time. I'm hoping we can go pret
ty close to 260, " Hamada added,
which would be about an 8.7 av
erage for each of the top five
gymnasts whose score is
counted towards the team total.
In the official season-opener
against San Jose State Jan. 9,
Stanford tallied 253 points.
Hamada's goal for tomorrow

night's meet is to add at least
one point to each of the six
events of the meet.
"Some guys have picked up
the moves they need to make
their scores higher," Hamada
explained. "That should raise
the base score a little higher.
Plus we've improved our con
sistency a bit more."
Besides the overall improve
ment, the team goals include
raising scores in Stanford's two
weakest events, pommel horse
and parallel bars.
"Last meet we had close to a
nine-point average in four
events but pommel horse and
parallel bars were way down,"
said Hamada. "For example, on
pommel horse we had 37 points
(the team total of five individ
ual marks) which is not even an
8.0 average. So I hope we can
bring up those scores. Parallel
bars was a 39-point total, which
is also below an 8.0 average.''
Just because Stanford isn't
particularly worried about a
team threat from the Aggies
doesn't mean that the meet will
be a one-sided affair. Davis fans
will have plenty to cheer about
in the form of Chuck Gaylord,
their top all-around performer.
In last week's meet he scored 51
points, according to Hamada,
and "they have a couple of good
specialists in each event. I think
we're going to be better because

of our depth. "
Stanford's line-up includes
Mike Lee. JimCampanelli, Kirk
Druey and Brian Nelson in all
around competition. As in the
team portion of the meet,
Hamada gives the edge to his
athletes in the all-around de
partment.
"I think this time Mike and
Jim will go a lot higher — easily
50-plus points — and so should
Kirk and Brian." Hamada said.
Against San Jose State. Cam
panelli scored a 51.55 while
Druey hit 48 points and Nelson
scored 47.
Unlike their female coun
terparts, the men's squad has
been relatively free of injuries
so far this season. With the ex
ception of Rich Rosen, who is
out indefinitely with a bone chip
in one arm. most of the Card ail
ments are minor.
"No one is seriously hurt,"
said Hamada. "Mike has a sore
knee and back, but they're get
ting better. Craig (Goldman*
has a sore shoulder and back,
but its not critical where he
can't perform. Bela's (Matyas)
jammed finger is the biggest
concern right now.
"So far the training has been
going really well. The guys are
stronger and getting consistent,
especially the all-around guys,
who are improving at a tremen
dous rate. I think it will be a

very interesting meet just to
watch where some of my top
guys end up. I d like to see them
hit they're potential to get a
maximum score," added
Hamada.
A strong team performance
might help in improving upon
Stanford's fifth-place ranking in
the Pacific-10 Conference and
that 20th ranking in the most re
cent national rankings. The
Cards are also rated fifth in the
western region of the country.
Currently dominating the
Pac-10 ratings are UCLA, Ore
gon State, California and Arizo
na State.
