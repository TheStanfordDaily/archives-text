# 'Crosby weather' cancels 1st round

Pebble Beach (AP) —
They call it "Crosby weath
er."
It's been absent for a cou
ple of years and the famed
Bing Crosby National Pro-
Am, with a horde of celebrity
amateurs and the cream of
the crop of golf's touring
pros, has been played in
warm sunshine against the
picturesque backdrop of the
beautiful Monterey Penin
sula.
But this year Crosby
weather has returned.
It's cold, wet and windy.
And yesterday, another in
a series of Pacific storms
washed out first-round play.
The tournament schedule
was pushed back one day and
— weather permitting — now
is scheduled to run today
through Monday.
Tom Watson took one look
at the squishy fairways, the
rain-drenched tees and
greens and observed, "it's
going to be Mud City out
there."
Hale Irwin, crouching un
der an umbrella, agreed.
"It's not all that much fun
playing in this slop," said the
two-time U.S. Open cham
pion, "but we who have been
here before aren't surprised.
We more or less expect it. We

aren't surprised by it. And
we keep coming back. So the
tournament must be doing
something right."
The tournament was
scheduled to get underway
yesterday on three courses
on the storm-lashed penin
sula, inundated by more than
two inches of rain early in the
week and braced for another
front due to sweep in from
the Pacific.
"We just can't take any
more rain," said Jack Stirl
ing, a PGA tour official who
spent most of Wednesday su
pervising ground crews bail
ing out bunkers and attempt
ing to dry out tees and greens
on Pebble Beach. Cypress
Point and Spyglass Hill.
Even if the weather holds
off, so-called "winter rules"
will be in effect, with players
allowed to lift, clean and
place balls in the fairways.
The format calls for the
168 pros, each with an
amateur partner, to play one
round on each of the three
courses before the field is cut
for the final round at Pebble
Beach Sunday.
The courses were closed to
practice all day Tuesday and
half of Wednesday.
