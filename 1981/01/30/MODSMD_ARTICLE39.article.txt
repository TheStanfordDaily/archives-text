# A 						penetrating issue
## Inside Stanford's sex 
### Brad Crystal 
Perhaps the most talked
about extra-curricular sub
jects at Stanford are sex and
sexual relationships. So what
could be a more appropriate
topic to feature in the second
issue of Inside Stanford, a
magazine devoted to "print
ing in-depth articles that will
appeal to the Stanford stu
dent as well as the surround
ing community."
That statement reflects
the view of editors Darren
Barnett and Newland
Shepard, the magazine's
founding fathers, who have
put together a neatly or
ganized, slickly styled, high
ly readable, but also some
what flawed publication The
21-page sex feature covers a
lot of territory: from a
fascinating historical review
of relationships at Stanford,
to a presentation of the
much-heralded Stanford sex
ual behavior survey, to a
poignant first person account
entitled "What Would You
Do If Your Roommmate Was
Homosexual?"
On the positive side, the
survey questions, it seemed
to me. were carefully chosen
and well-phrased. The issue
of whether dorms promote
sexual activity, for example,
is frequently argued, so it
was an apt question. The
questions concerning virgin
ity, and frequency of sexual
activity were, likewise, very
pertinent.
Unfortunately, the
statistics are not very mean
ingful because the survey
was not conducted with re
gard for scientific accuracy.
The editors could have
used a random sampling of a
large number of students, or
a representative sampling of
a small number (two stan
dard methods of survey tak
ing). Instead, they chose to
set up a table next to the Post
Office where only those stu
dents who stopped and and
decided to take the time to
fill out the questionnaire
were tabulated.

It is quite possible that the
374 students surveyed repre
sent the views and lifestyles
of Stanford's 6000 under
graudates. But it is even
more possible they do not.
I can't understand why the
surveyors didn't consult pro
fessors in the statistics or
communications depart
ments. for example, to come
up with a more credible
method of assessment.
The survey editors go as
far as constructing a

hypothesis called the "Sen
ior-Sophomore Syndrome"
to explain their finding that
70 percent of sophomore
women and 70 percent of sen
ior men engage in sex at least
once a week. Although these
percentages seem re
markably out of line with
personal observation, I'm
sure I'd find them less
dubious if the survey had
been conducted scien
tifically.
For the most part, how
ever, the sex articles de
serve commendation for
their scrupulous research.
The editors tackle a very
provocative subject in a sen
sitve, non-exploitative
manner. The special feature
section is punctuated
throughout with a series of
classic Dupie cartoons by Gil
Morales.
The other articles, while
less tantalizing than the sex
section, are generally well
written. Particularly in

teresting is Jo Anderews' in
siders' account of the incom
parable LSJUMB, high
lighting some of the band's
more outrageous stunts over
the years.
The third section of the
magazine entitled "Columns
Etc." begins with an eye
catching photo essay display
ing the work of Stanford jun
ior Ivan Powell. I think we'll
be hearing a lot more about
Powell's pictures in the
years to come.
Also worthy of note is John
Halamka's "Journey
through Stanford Bath
rooms" capturing the
creative genius of the Uni
versity's more earthy
writers.
I also liked Andy Brandt's
investigative report on the
complex dilemma facing
Stanford women's basketball
star Angie Paccione. Ap
parently Paccione's absence
from this year's team is not
all it seemed. The clash of
personalities off the field can
sometimes be more hostile
than the clash of athletes on
the field.
If all this isn't enough,
you're sure to enjoy what
must be the ten thousandth
interview of Admissions
Dean Fred Hargadon.
There's a lot more than the
usual admissions stuff.
You'll find out how Hargadon
deals with a perennial prob
lem: hate mail.
The only column I really
disliked was Steve
Vineberg's "Movies and the
Raised Consciousness" in
which we learn that Or
dinary People is an "un
imaginative piece of film
making." We also and find
out that it is "stirring" to
watch a movie called "The
Chant of -Jimmy Blacksmith
in which "a sympathetic
character hacks a room full
of women and children to bits
with an axe."
On the whole. Inside Stan
ford has proved itself a
viable publication. I hope it's
here to stay.

The survey editors go as
far as constructing a

hypothesis called the "Sen
ior-Sophomore Syndrome"
to explain their finding that
70 percent of sophomore
women and 70 percent of sen
ior men engage in sex at least
once a week. Although these
percentages seem re
markably out of line with
personal observation, I'm
sure I'd find them less
dubious if the survey had
been conducted scien
tifically.
For the most part, how
ever, the sex articles de
serve commendation for
their scrupulous research.
The editors tackle a very
provocative subject in a sen
sitve, non-exploitative
manner. The special feature
section is punctuated
throughout with a series of
classic Dupie cartoons by Gil
Morales.
The other articles, while
less tantalizing than the sex
section, are generally well
written. Particularly in

teresting is Jo Anderews' in
siders' account of the incom
parable LSJUMB, high
lighting some of the band's
more outrageous stunts over
the years.
The third section of the
magazine entitled "Columns
Etc." begins with an eye
catching photo essay display
ing the work of Stanford jun
ior Ivan Powell. I think we'll
be hearing a lot more about
Powell's pictures in the
years to come.
Also worthy of note is John
Halamka's "Journey
through Stanford Bath
rooms" capturing the
creative genius of the Uni
versity's more earthy
writers.
I also liked Andy Brandt's
investigative report on the
complex dilemma facing
Stanford women's basketball
star Angie Paccione. Ap
parently Paccione's absence
from this year's team is not
all it seemed. The clash of
personalities off the field can
sometimes be more hostile
than the clash of athletes on
the field.
If all this isn't enough,
you're sure to enjoy what
must be the ten thousandth
interview of Admissions
Dean Fred Hargadon.
There's a lot more than the
usual admissions stuff.
You'll find out how Hargadon
deals with a perennial prob
lem: hate mail.
The only column I really
disliked was Steve
Vineberg's "Movies and the
Raised Consciousness" in
which we learn that Or
dinary People is an "un
imaginative piece of film
making." We also and find
out that it is "stirring" to
watch a movie called "The
Chant of -Jimmy Blacksmith
in which "a sympathetic
character hacks a room full
of women and children to bits
with an axe."
On the whole. Inside Stan
ford has proved itself a
viable publication. I hope it's
here to stay.

Perhaps the most talked
about extra-curricular sub
jects at Stanford are sex and
sexual relationships. So what
could be a more appropriate
topic to feature in the second
issue of Inside Stanford, a
magazine devoted to "print
ing in-depth articles that will
appeal to the Stanford stu
dent as well as the surround
ing community."
That statement reflects
the view of editors Darren
Barnett and Newland
Shepard, the magazine's
founding fathers, who have
put together a neatly or
ganized, slickly styled, high
ly readable, but also some
what flawed publication The
21-page sex feature covers a
lot of territory: from a
fascinating historical review
of relationships at Stanford,
to a presentation of the
much-heralded Stanford sex
ual behavior survey, to a
poignant first person account
entitled "What Would You
Do If Your Roommmate Was
Homosexual?"
On the positive side, the
survey questions, it seemed
to me. were carefully chosen
and well-phrased. The issue
of whether dorms promote
sexual activity, for example,
is frequently argued, so it
was an apt question. The
questions concerning virgin
ity, and frequency of sexual
activity were, likewise, very
pertinent.
Unfortunately, the
statistics are not very mean
ingful because the survey
was not conducted with re
gard for scientific accuracy.
The editors could have
used a random sampling of a
large number of students, or
a representative sampling of
a small number (two stan
dard methods of survey tak
ing). Instead, they chose to
set up a table next to the Post
Office where only those stu
dents who stopped and and
decided to take the time to
fill out the questionnaire
were tabulated.

It is quite possible that the
374 students surveyed repre
sent the views and lifestyles
of Stanford's 6000 under
graudates. But it is even
more possible they do not.
I can't understand why the
surveyors didn't consult pro
fessors in the statistics or
communications depart
ments. for example, to come
up with a more credible
method of assessment.
