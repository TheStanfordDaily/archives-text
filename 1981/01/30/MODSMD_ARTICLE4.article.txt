# Anti-Medfly program continues with spraying decision put off

### Gale Warner 
As the war againSt the Mediterranean fruit fly in San
ta Clara County continues, aerial spraying of the
pesticide malathion remains a distinct possibility in the
near future despite local opposition, according to scien
tists here
At the end of February, a group of agricultural of
ficials and entomologists appointed by county officials
and called the Medflv Technical Review Committee
will judge the effectiveness of the current program of
fruit-stripping, ground-spraying, quarantine and the
release of sterile flies The committee has set four
criteria for success, which include:
Within the 50-square-mile core infestation area. 80
percent of all host fruit must have been removed, with
100 percent of host material removed within a three
block area of any larval finds
Fruit stripping must be completed before March
1. and no area as large as five square miles or more can
remain infested with larvae
— Trap data must show a 100 1 ratio of sterile to wild
flies.
Fewer than two new infestations (adults or
larvae) must be found outside of the original quaran
tine area
If any one of these objectives is not met. the commit
tee will recommend full-scale aerial spraying of
malathion-bait over the county But the committee
may have a hard time deciding if the criteria have been
met, according to Human Biology Asst. Prof
Margaret Race, who said recently that project officials
"haven't collected the necessary scientific data" on

(he medflv population here.
While commenting on the "impressive coordi
nation of the Medflv Project. Race said local officials,
in their zeal to eradicate the flv. have neglected to keep
adequate records of sterile fly releases or develop ac
curate ways to census the flies from sampling data
"They're kidding themselves if thev think they can get
along without this kind of research " she declared
Insufficient data will make a straightforward eval
uation of the project's success difficult, thus putting a
measure of subjectivity into the aerial spraying de
cision. she said
"Unfortunately, a lot of this problem has been
tackled without regard for a theoretical basis." said
Biology Prof. John Thomas, who has served in many
consultant roles for the county on the issue of
pesticides Agricultural officials tend to regard the cur
rent infestation as an all-out battle which will either be
won or lost for all time, he said
But. according to Thomas, with heavilv-infested
areas such as Hawaii and Central America nearby in
terms of modern transportation, it is naive to think that
another infestation will not occur in the future "If the
medflv got here once, it will get here again. " he said
Thomas thus spoke of developing a long-term
strategy for dealing with medflies. including basic re
search on the fly. increased public awareness, and de
velopment of biological controls such as natural pre
dators Resorting to aerial spraying every time things
get out of hand is not a long-term solution, he em
phasized
For one thing, it is "perfectly possible." according to

Thomas, for a strain of malathion-resistant medflies to
eventually develop in response to repeated large-scale
sprayings "It's known as evolution in action." he said
So far as the current situation is concerned, he said,
aerial spraying will kill the sterile medflies that have
been released so far. thus negating that phase of the
project Also, the sprays will onlv kill adult flies and
will not harm larvae and pupae
Meanwhile, aerial sprayings pose a number of risks
Approximately 2 4 ounces of malathion mixed with 9 6
ounces of bait would be applied per acre, for a total of
3.8 tons of malathion deposited over the quarantine
area per spraying, said Race Medflies must ingest
malathion in order for it to work, she said
Malathion belongs to a class of pesticides known as
organophosphates. which work by interfering with the
normal transmission of nerve impulses in the body Un
like their cousins the chlorinated hydrocarbons (such
as DDT), organophosphates break down into harmless
byproducts in a few days and so do not accumulate in
bodv tissues or food chains Therefore they are con
sidered to be "some of the safest pesticides in use to
day." according to agricultural officials
But they are still biological poisons. Thomas said,
and have the potential to seriously disrupt ecological
webs. Malathion is a broad-spectrum pesticide, mean
ing that it will kill not just medflies but all arthropods,
including bees, spiders, ladvbug beetles and other bene
ficial species The ecological effects of widespread
spraying can only be guessed at. he said, but what
worries us most is that we don't know what exactly will
happen "

Malathion is also toxic to birds and fish In mam
mals. malathion is degraded hv enzymes in the liver
and tissues fairly rapidly and thus is far less toxic
But malathion exposure may be hazardous to people
who for one reason or other can't metabolize malathion
effectively. Dr Helen Blau said, assistant professor of
pharmacology at Stanford Medical Center Infants, the
aged, and persons with liver damage are particularly
sensitive to malathion poisoning, she said
Various studies also link malathion to human
chromosome aberrations, learning disabilities in chil
dren. and increased susceptibility to viral diseases in
the aged Currently studies of the chronic effects of
malathion show it to be carcinogenic in some mice and
rats and teratogenic < causing birth defects i in rats and
chickens
This cannot be conclusively extrapolated to humans,
but most researchers consider animal studies to be
good indicators of a chemical's potential effects on peo
ple. especially since carcinogens often have a latent pe
riod of 30 to 40 years in humans
Other feared effects on aerial spraying range from
the wiping out of insect populations currently under sci
entific investigation < including many at Stanford" to
the damage of some types of lacquer paint finishes on
cars
For these and other reasons Thomas predicted that
"there will be a great hue and cry if they try to aerial
spray " But with enormous pressure to spray coming
from a worried $12 billion-a-vear agricultural industry,
aerial spraying may soon be a reality, said Race

strategy for dealing with medflies. including basic re
search on the fly. increased public awareness, and de
velopment of biological controls such as natural pre
dators Resorting to aerial spraying every time things
get out of hand is not a long-term solution, he em
phasized
For one thing, it is "perfectly possible." according to

Thomas, for a strain of malathion-resistant medflies to
eventually develop in response to repeated large-scale
sprayings "It's known as evolution in action." he said
So far as the current situation is concerned, he said,
aerial spraying will kill the sterile medflies that have
been released so far. thus negating that phase of the
project Also, the sprays will onlv kill adult flies and
will not harm larvae and pupae
Meanwhile, aerial sprayings pose a number of risks
Approximately 2 4 ounces of malathion mixed with 9 6
ounces of bait would be applied per acre, for a total of
3.8 tons of malathion deposited over the quarantine
area per spraying, said Race Medflies must ingest
malathion in order for it to work, she said
Malathion belongs to a class of pesticides known as
organophosphates. which work by interfering with the
normal transmission of nerve impulses in the body Un
like their cousins the chlorinated hydrocarbons (such
as DDT), organophosphates break down into harmless
byproducts in a few days and so do not accumulate in
bodv tissues or food chains Therefore they are con
sidered to be "some of the safest pesticides in use to
day." according to agricultural officials
But they are still biological poisons. Thomas said,
and have the potential to seriously disrupt ecological
webs. Malathion is a broad-spectrum pesticide, mean
ing that it will kill not just medflies but all arthropods,
including bees, spiders, ladvbug beetles and other bene
ficial species The ecological effects of widespread
spraying can only be guessed at. he said, but what
worries us most is that we don't know what exactly will
happen "

Malathion is also toxic to birds and fish In mam
mals. malathion is degraded hv enzymes in the liver
and tissues fairly rapidly and thus is far less toxic
But malathion exposure may be hazardous to people
who for one reason or other can't metabolize malathion
effectively. Dr Helen Blau said, assistant professor of
pharmacology at Stanford Medical Center Infants, the
aged, and persons with liver damage are particularly
sensitive to malathion poisoning, she said
Various studies also link malathion to human
chromosome aberrations, learning disabilities in chil
dren. and increased susceptibility to viral diseases in
the aged Currently studies of the chronic effects of
malathion show it to be carcinogenic in some mice and
rats and teratogenic < causing birth defects i in rats and
chickens
This cannot be conclusively extrapolated to humans,
but most researchers consider animal studies to be
good indicators of a chemical's potential effects on peo
ple. especially since carcinogens often have a latent pe
riod of 30 to 40 years in humans
Other feared effects on aerial spraying range from
the wiping out of insect populations currently under sci
entific investigation < including many at Stanford" to
the damage of some types of lacquer paint finishes on
cars
For these and other reasons Thomas predicted that
"there will be a great hue and cry if they try to aerial
spray " But with enormous pressure to spray coming
from a worried $12 billion-a-vear agricultural industry,
aerial spraying may soon be a reality, said Race
As the war againSt the Mediterranean fruit fly in San
ta Clara County continues, aerial spraying of the
pesticide malathion remains a distinct possibility in the
near future despite local opposition, according to scien
tists here
At the end of February, a group of agricultural of
ficials and entomologists appointed by county officials
and called the Medflv Technical Review Committee
will judge the effectiveness of the current program of
fruit-stripping, ground-spraying, quarantine and the
release of sterile flies The committee has set four
criteria for success, which include:
Within the 50-square-mile core infestation area. 80
percent of all host fruit must have been removed, with
100 percent of host material removed within a three
block area of any larval finds
Fruit stripping must be completed before March
1. and no area as large as five square miles or more can
remain infested with larvae
— Trap data must show a 100 1 ratio of sterile to wild
flies.
Fewer than two new infestations (adults or
larvae) must be found outside of the original quaran
tine area
If any one of these objectives is not met. the commit
tee will recommend full-scale aerial spraying of
malathion-bait over the county But the committee
may have a hard time deciding if the criteria have been
met, according to Human Biology Asst. Prof
Margaret Race, who said recently that project officials
"haven't collected the necessary scientific data" on

(he medflv population here.
While commenting on the "impressive coordi
nation of the Medflv Project. Race said local officials,
in their zeal to eradicate the flv. have neglected to keep
adequate records of sterile fly releases or develop ac
curate ways to census the flies from sampling data
"They're kidding themselves if thev think they can get
along without this kind of research " she declared
Insufficient data will make a straightforward eval
uation of the project's success difficult, thus putting a
measure of subjectivity into the aerial spraying de
cision. she said
"Unfortunately, a lot of this problem has been
tackled without regard for a theoretical basis." said
Biology Prof. John Thomas, who has served in many
consultant roles for the county on the issue of
pesticides Agricultural officials tend to regard the cur
rent infestation as an all-out battle which will either be
won or lost for all time, he said
But. according to Thomas, with heavilv-infested
areas such as Hawaii and Central America nearby in
terms of modern transportation, it is naive to think that
another infestation will not occur in the future "If the
