Ropes of Sand: America's Failure in the Middle
Hast

By Gail Edmondson-Sehares
Anyone interested in U. S. foreign policy and in
ternational relations will be intrigued with Wilbur
Eveland's Ropes of Sand.
Eveland's timely book examines 30 years of
State Department and CIA operations in the
Middle East. The author's insights are based on
his experience as CIA adviser, U. S. State Depart
ment intelligence officer, and petroleum engi
neering consultant.
Ropes of Sand was published last summer fol
lowing several attempts by the CIA to censor the
manuscript. Eveland, a Los Altos resident, cred
its Congressman Pete McCloskey with helping
him resolve his differences with the CIA.
Eveland's book details the stream of American
blunders and duplicity which have eroded U. S.
credibility and influence in the Mideast. The nar
rative itself is no spy thriller. Instead, it focuses
on the endless encounters, meetings and planning
sessions involved in comprehensive policy-mak
ing.
The book flows well for the immense amount of
detail Eveland presents. Ropes of Sand takes the
reader on a journey through time to the Mideast.
The reader shares in his initial naivete and in all
the surprises along the way.
The last chapter of the book stands apart from
the previous 340 pages of narrative. Arranged by
subject heading, this chapter encapsulates key
background details and projects future policy im
peratives regarding the oil industry. OPEC, the
Arabs, the Palestinian question. Israel and the
CIA.
Surprisingly, Eveland does not devote much at
tention to Iran, or to the CIA operation AJAX'
which deposed Premier Mossadegh and re
instated the shah of Iran in 1953. Although he was
never based in Iran, and his role with the CIA was
primarily advisory (gathering intelligence as op
posed to engineering coups), Eveland gives us so
much insight into other areas of Mideast policy
that one wonders why Iran was played down,
Eveland traveled extensively throughout the
Mideast but his specific assignments (over time)
were in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. The politics of
these three countries are presented in greater de
tail than those of other Mideast countries.
The CIA-supported Syrian coup in 1956
epitomized the type of fiasco which resulted from
our poorly coordinated policy planning. Late one
night, Eveland was awakened by a frantic pound
ing on his door. The Syrian politician he had paid
to arrange the coup confronted him, flushed with
anger: "How could you have asked us to over
throw our government at the exact moment when
Israel started a war with an Arab state!"
Eveland's role with the CIA, however, was
mainly advisory. He disdained covert activity:
'What foolishness . . . Even when I wanted to do
something openiy, our embassy made it cloak and
dagger.*
The curious question for Eveland, and for all of

us, remains: With all the time, money, personnel
and expertise we invested in the Middle East, why
did we fail? Who didn't listen to whom?
Clearly during Eveland's stay in the Mideast, it
was Secretary of State John Foster Dulles who
was not 'listening' to anyone. Cables and tele
grams sent to the inflexible Dulles fell on deaf
ears. According to Eveland, Dulles was absorbed
in his own game of brinkmanship with the Soviets.
But the problem is larger than one secretary of
state. According to Eveland, seven American
presidents have ignored the recommendations
and evidence which policy advisers continually
present, in the interest of helping to shape a sound
American foreign policy.
Eveland's strongest message centers on what
he considers to be the real obstacle to our success
in the Middle East: the Arab-Israeli conflict, and
specifically, the Palestinian issue To those of us
who lived in the Middle East, it was apparent that
the question of the future status of the Palesti
nians was one that, unless it were resolved
promptly, would pose a far greater threat to U. S.
and Western influence in the area than any overt
moves by the communist bloc.'
According to the author, 30 years of instability
in the Mideast (resulting from the Arab-Israeli
conflict) have provided Russia with more op
portunities than it could have created on its own.
Thus, the theme of Eveland's book: 'We have met
the enemy and he is us.'
Eveland's personal theory as to why the U. S.
has not been able to resolve the conflict by sup
porting and enforcing United Nations Security
Council resolutions is the climax of his story. His
theory is based on the insight and understanding
only an insider could have, and with it, Eveland
answers many of the nagging questions which are
crucial to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict.
This book is essential reading for all those who
desire to understand why our failure the Middle
East now affects the daily life of every American.
