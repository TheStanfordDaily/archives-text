### Marty McGovern 
Under the Sign of Saturn
Susan Sontag
Farrar, Strauss, (iiroux
204 pps., $10.95

For anyone within a hundred
miles of academia. the title essay of
Susan Sontag's first collection.
Against Interpretation (1966),
ought to be required reading.
The best example of what she
means by interpretation comes in
her discussion of Elia Kazan's prod
uction of ,4 Streetcar Named De
sire. As his notes to the production
show, in order to direct it Kazan had
"to discover" that Stanley
Kowalski represented "the sensual
and vengeful barbarism" engulfing
our culture, while Blanche was a
delicate and vulnerable Western
civilization.
Sontag expresses her objection to
this nicely: "Apparently, were it to
go on being a play about a handsome
brute named Stanley Kowalski and
a faded mangy belle named Blanche
Du Bois, it would not have been

manageable."
What Sontag seeks, then, is an
ability to let a work of art or a sys
tem of ideas speak for itself. She
wants to root out our "refusal to
leave the work of art alone," our
need to make it "manageable." In
the long run. Sontag is getting at a
problem of epistemology, a matter
of knowledge and objectivity, which
is not so very neat and simple.
How does one let a work of art
speak for itself? Not an easy ques
tion, to be sure, but it is one Sontag
comes back to in I fader the Sign of
Saturn (her third collection), in es
says on Walter Benjamin. Roland
Barthes. Paul Goodman. Artaud.
Leni Riefenstahl. Canetti. and
Hans-Jurgen Svberberg
Sontag integrates her skirmish
against interpretation with these
essays in two ways. Indirectly, she
quietly attempts to let the work of
her subjects speak for itself. She
tries simply to show what they
wrote, not to build an interpretation
arund it. More directly, she tries to

indicate how each of the individuals
did nor did not come close to creat
ing through interpretation or
without it (Of course, her selection
of subjects may. in its own way, be
an interpretation of sorts.)
The essay on German film direc
tor and photographer Leni
Riefenstahl ("Fascinating
Fascism") clearly illustrates
something of what Sontag is up to.
She begins by discussing a book of
photography by Riefenstahl. a pic
torial essay on the Nuba tribe of the
Sudan. The blurb on the book flap.
Sontag explains, dissociates her
from any ties to the Nazi regime and
depicts her "purified" aesthetic
aims and accomplishments. Sum
marily, Sontag goes through the
blurb, phrase by phrase, showing it
to be a pack of lies, excepting the
statement that Riefenstahl was a
household word in Germanv during
WW II
Sontag illustrates how
Riefenstahl's later work is an at
tempt by the director to re-interpret

her early work as well as her very
self outside of Nazi contexts, an at
tempt to build an interpretation of a
quest for beauty alone rather than in
collusion with totalitarianism. The
book on the Nuba is itself, Sontag
points out. written in the manner of
an Aryan regime, for Riefenstahl
takes pains to prove that the Nuba
tribe is superior to other (Black)
tribes because of the innate physi
cal power and beauty of its people.
For Sontag, Riefenstahl's photog
raphy is an attempt to legitimate as
aesthetic what turns out to be only
ideological.
The collection of essays might
sound more programmatic than it
is. One does, in fact, learn quite a bit
about a handful of artists and critics
whose work is not really in any daily
spotlight. It is not difficult, how
ever, to tell where Sontag's ap
probation lies, for in addition to

trying to set out clearly the work of
her subjects, she also gives them a
vote of aye or nay on how they deal
with interpretation.
To put it simply, Benjamin,
Barthes. Goodman, and Canetti —
as Son tag reads them — are with her
against interpretation. Riefenstahl,
Svberberg and Artaud, on the other
hand, are not.
Concerning style, one might feel
inclined to contrast and compare
Sontag to another contemporary es
sayist, Joan Didion. Sontag, for ex
ample, indulges at times in the
pseudo-enlightening jargon of ex
istentialism ("The artist is a con
sciousness trying to be,"), an in
dulgence Didion refuses to allow
herself. In the majority of her es
says, however, Sontag maintains a
spirited analytical style, whereas
Didion, when she turns infrequently

to semi-technical matters, remains
a little flat.
Occasionally Sontag rises to the
typical, impassioned rhythms so
hypnotic in Didion: "Now there is a
master scenario available for eve
ryone ... the material is leather, the
seduction is beauty, the justifi
cation is honesty, the aim is ecsta
sy, the fantasy is death"
("Fascinating Fascism").
Despite her variations in style,
Sontag's aim remains the same: to
let the opus of her subjects
"breathe" (Canetti's term); to act
as window to the work rather than
interpreter. Again, one might ques
tion the possibility of ever totally
achieving this goal. Nevertheless,
Sontag's determination is both
dogged and exciting, and it is in this
respect that Under the of
Saturn bears reading.

Svberberg and Artaud, on the other
hand, are not.
Concerning style, one might feel
inclined to contrast and compare
Sontag to another contemporary es
sayist, Joan Didion. Sontag, for ex
ample, indulges at times in the
pseudo-enlightening jargon of ex
istentialism ("The artist is a con
sciousness trying to be,"), an in
dulgence Didion refuses to allow
herself. In the majority of her es
says, however, Sontag maintains a
spirited analytical style, whereas
Didion, when she turns infrequently

to semi-technical matters, remains
a little flat.
Occasionally Sontag rises to the
typical, impassioned rhythms so
hypnotic in Didion: "Now there is a
master scenario available for eve
ryone ... the material is leather, the
seduction is beauty, the justifi
cation is honesty, the aim is ecsta
sy, the fantasy is death"
("Fascinating Fascism").
Despite her variations in style,
Sontag's aim remains the same: to
let the opus of her subjects
"breathe" (Canetti's term); to act
as window to the work rather than
interpreter. Again, one might ques
tion the possibility of ever totally
achieving this goal. Nevertheless,
Sontag's determination is both
dogged and exciting, and it is in this
respect that Under the of
Saturn bears reading.
Under the Sign of Saturn
Susan Sontag
Farrar, Strauss, (iiroux
204 pps., $10.95

For anyone within a hundred
miles of academia. the title essay of
Susan Sontag's first collection.
Against Interpretation (1966),
ought to be required reading.
The best example of what she
means by interpretation comes in
her discussion of Elia Kazan's prod
uction of ,4 Streetcar Named De
sire. As his notes to the production
show, in order to direct it Kazan had
"to discover" that Stanley
Kowalski represented "the sensual
and vengeful barbarism" engulfing
our culture, while Blanche was a
delicate and vulnerable Western
civilization.
Sontag expresses her objection to
this nicely: "Apparently, were it to
go on being a play about a handsome
brute named Stanley Kowalski and
a faded mangy belle named Blanche
Du Bois, it would not have been

manageable."
What Sontag seeks, then, is an
ability to let a work of art or a sys
tem of ideas speak for itself. She
wants to root out our "refusal to
leave the work of art alone," our
need to make it "manageable." In
the long run. Sontag is getting at a
problem of epistemology, a matter
of knowledge and objectivity, which
is not so very neat and simple.
How does one let a work of art
speak for itself? Not an easy ques
tion, to be sure, but it is one Sontag
comes back to in I fader the Sign of
Saturn (her third collection), in es
says on Walter Benjamin. Roland
Barthes. Paul Goodman. Artaud.
Leni Riefenstahl. Canetti. and
Hans-Jurgen Svberberg
Sontag integrates her skirmish
against interpretation with these
essays in two ways. Indirectly, she
quietly attempts to let the work of
her subjects speak for itself. She
tries simply to show what they
wrote, not to build an interpretation
arund it. More directly, she tries to

indicate how each of the individuals
did nor did not come close to creat
ing through interpretation or
without it (Of course, her selection
of subjects may. in its own way, be
an interpretation of sorts.)
The essay on German film direc
tor and photographer Leni
Riefenstahl ("Fascinating
Fascism") clearly illustrates
something of what Sontag is up to.
She begins by discussing a book of
photography by Riefenstahl. a pic
torial essay on the Nuba tribe of the
Sudan. The blurb on the book flap.
Sontag explains, dissociates her
from any ties to the Nazi regime and
depicts her "purified" aesthetic
aims and accomplishments. Sum
marily, Sontag goes through the
blurb, phrase by phrase, showing it
to be a pack of lies, excepting the
statement that Riefenstahl was a
household word in Germanv during
WW II
Sontag illustrates how
Riefenstahl's later work is an at
tempt by the director to re-interpret

her early work as well as her very
self outside of Nazi contexts, an at
tempt to build an interpretation of a
quest for beauty alone rather than in
collusion with totalitarianism. The
book on the Nuba is itself, Sontag
points out. written in the manner of
an Aryan regime, for Riefenstahl
takes pains to prove that the Nuba
tribe is superior to other (Black)
tribes because of the innate physi
cal power and beauty of its people.
For Sontag, Riefenstahl's photog
raphy is an attempt to legitimate as
aesthetic what turns out to be only
ideological.
The collection of essays might
sound more programmatic than it
is. One does, in fact, learn quite a bit
about a handful of artists and critics
whose work is not really in any daily
spotlight. It is not difficult, how
ever, to tell where Sontag's ap
probation lies, for in addition to

trying to set out clearly the work of
her subjects, she also gives them a
vote of aye or nay on how they deal
with interpretation.
To put it simply, Benjamin,
Barthes. Goodman, and Canetti —
as Son tag reads them — are with her
against interpretation. Riefenstahl,
Svberberg and Artaud, on the other
hand, are not.
