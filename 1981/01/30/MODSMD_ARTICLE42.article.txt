A movie only a schnauzer could
love Goldie Hawn. Chevie Chase,
and Charles Grodin share the
screen with six dogs in assorted
sizes; the only really funny scene
comes when the dogs turn up their
noses at Hawn's pepperoni

bines a ludicrous storyline with
one-dimensional characters:
Hawn has nothing to do but act
frazzled, while Grodin snivels and

Monday, Kresge
Rebecca, based on the novel by
Daphne du Maurier, was Alfred
Hitchcock's first American mov
ie. Lawrence Olivier marries
sweet young Joan Fontaine and
brings her home to manage his es
tate; complications arise when
she can't reach the standards set
by Olivier's late, first wife. Fon
taine's character is so timid that
we never learn her name t the title
refers to the dead wife), and she
creeps about the mansion like a
tourist in a museum after closing
time. Hitchcock's rendering of the
mansion's oppressiveness is very
fine—he makes gloom seem tan
gible.

The script is slight — an uncer
tain pastiche of Preston Sturges
effects — but Jane Fonda, Lily
Tomlin and Dolly Parton make an
unexpectedly fine comic ensemble
in this tale of three secretaries
who declare war on their idiot
male boss. Fonda's a bit unsure of
herself, but she plays against type
to good result; Parton is so natural
and unabashedly earnest that you
smile regardless of what she's
doing , and Tomlin shines through
out — her horsey face has soft
ened, giving her a multitude of dif
ferent expressions. Dabney Cole
man, as the tyrannical employer,
has the toughest part of all, but he
has a great time with it, playing
the unfailingly stupid jackass to
the hilt.

Anthony Hopkins and Shirley
MacLaine star in a disappointing
story about an aging-professor and
his fling with a student (Bo Derek)
half his age. MacLaine's per
formance as the professor's wife
was superb, but otherwise the film
offers only limited entertainment.
The social comments are impor
tant, but far too blatant in their
presentation. Hopkins stumbles
through the film as if he were to
tally confused And Derek's only
redeeming qualities are her good
looks. In her role, she is super
ficial, insincere, even boring at
times. Unfortunately, the film is
much the same.

The Hlues Brothers Movie *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Admittedly, there's something
innately satisfying about seeing a
shopping center destroyed, store
by store. But when director John
Landis (Animal Hou.se) attempts
to extend this aesthetic of destruc
tion over two hours, the whole ex
ercise becomes innately boring.
John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are
the ostensible stars, but they're
hidden behind dark glasses and im
penetrable gags, and we never get
arty feeling for who they're sup
posed to be. What we know about
their characters is what we find
out second-hand from the calamity
that's taking place all around
them. Human beings are negative
spaces in this movie — they're
something to explode buildings
around, and crash cars on top of.
It's hard not to be a little sickened
at the thought of the film's $32 mil
lion budget; it's a figure high
enough to make even slapstick
seem tragic.

yet; as always, Lumet lets his ac

chosen to emphasize the per

paigning about such an issue
(would the movie have been made
any differently if the benefit had

Hawn has nothing to do but act

Admittedly, there's something
innately satisfying about seeing a
shopping center destroyed, store
by store. But when director John
Landis (Animal Hou.se) attempts
to extend this aesthetic of destruc
tion over two hours, the whole ex
ercise becomes innately boring.
John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are
the ostensible stars, but they're
hidden behind dark glasses and im
penetrable gags, and we never get
arty feeling for who they're sup
posed to be. What we know about
their characters is what we find
out second-hand from the calamity
that's taking place all around
them. Human beings are negative
spaces in this movie — they're
something to explode buildings
around, and crash cars on top of.
It's hard not to be a little sickened
at the thought of the film's $32 mil
lion budget; it's a figure high
enough to make even slapstick
seem tragic.

The Hlues Brothers Movie *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Admittedly, there's something
innately satisfying about seeing a
shopping center destroyed, store
by store. But when director John
Landis (Animal Hou.se) attempts
to extend this aesthetic of destruc
tion over two hours, the whole ex
ercise becomes innately boring.
John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd are
the ostensible stars, but they're
hidden behind dark glasses and im
penetrable gags, and we never get
arty feeling for who they're sup
posed to be. What we know about
their characters is what we find
out second-hand from the calamity
that's taking place all around
them. Human beings are negative
spaces in this movie — they're
something to explode buildings
around, and crash cars on top of.
It's hard not to be a little sickened
at the thought of the film's $32 mil
lion budget; it's a figure high
enough to make even slapstick
seem tragic.

, about an Italian immigrant who is

set by all this, and also by
Diamond's choice of friends — a
woman who is simultaneously a

Director Sidney Lumet's back
to-the-wall, pressured style is
perfect for this story of a bungled
bank heist. A 1 Pacino's over
heated, possessed performance as
a confused bankrobber is his best
yet; as always, Lumet lets his ac
tors go — Pacino's response is
primal, vibrant. The movie un
ravels even as Pacino does, but
that's when it's at its best; the
movie's consumed by its crazy
energy, and you're swept along
into the mad fires. „

Haskell Wexler, who directed
the fascinating mock-documen
tary Medium Cool, photographed
this rock-documentary of the
MUSE (Musicians United for Safe
Energy) benefit which took place
in New York a year ago. He's
chosen to emphasize the per
formers' faces, often to
mesmerizing effect — we've never
been so close to these people
before. It's possible to question the
legitimacy of celebrities cam
paigning about such an issue
(would the movie have been made
any differently if the benefit had
been in support of nuclear energy
instead of against it?) but it's hard
not to get caught up with their en
thusiasm and concern.
Your opinion of the movie will
inevitably be affected by your
opinion of its people. They include
Bruce Springsteen and the E
Street Band. Jackson Browne, the
Doobie Brothers, and Gil Scott-
Herron. Late show this weekend.

Alfred Hitchcock capped his
string of British masterpieces
with this stylish thriller about dis
appearings and espionage dis
covered on a train. Michael Red
grave and Margaret Lock wood
meet nice old Dame May Whitty
while vacationing; before they get
a chance to know her better, the
poor woman has vanished without
a trace. As they search for her,
they stumble onto far greater mys
teries than they had expected.
Hitchcock's touch is at its lightest
here: this is a thriller leavened
with his inimitable brand of com
edy.

Seems l.ike Old Times *
Old Mill, Mountain View
A movie only a schnauzer could
love Goldie Hawn. Chevie Chase,
and Charles Grodin share the
screen with six dogs in assorted
sizes; the only really funny scene
comes when the dogs turn up their
noses at Hawn's pepperoni
chicken. Neil Simon's script com
bines a ludicrous storyline with
one-dimensional characters:
Hawn has nothing to do but act
frazzled, while Grodin snivels and
Chase mugs. The "old times" that
Simon would like to evoke are the
screwball comedies of the '30s and
'40s, but Seems l.ike Old Times
only brings to mind the TV sitcoms
of the '70s

Monday, Kresge
Rebecca, based on the novel by
Daphne du Maurier, was Alfred
Hitchcock's first American mov
ie. Lawrence Olivier marries
sweet young Joan Fontaine and
brings her home to manage his es
tate; complications arise when
she can't reach the standards set
by Olivier's late, first wife. Fon
taine's character is so timid that
we never learn her name t the title
refers to the dead wife), and she
creeps about the mansion like a
tourist in a museum after closing
time. Hitchcock's rendering of the
mansion's oppressiveness is very
fine—he makes gloom seem tan
gible.

The script is slight — an uncer
tain pastiche of Preston Sturges
effects — but Jane Fonda, Lily
Tomlin and Dolly Parton make an
unexpectedly fine comic ensemble
in this tale of three secretaries
who declare war on their idiot
male boss. Fonda's a bit unsure of
herself, but she plays against type
to good result; Parton is so natural
and unabashedly earnest that you
smile regardless of what she's
doing , and Tomlin shines through
out — her horsey face has soft
ened, giving her a multitude of dif
ferent expressions. Dabney Cole
man, as the tyrannical employer,
has the toughest part of all, but he
has a great time with it, playing
the unfailingly stupid jackass to
the hilt.

Anthony Hopkins and Shirley
MacLaine star in a disappointing
story about an aging-professor and
his fling with a student (Bo Derek)
half his age. MacLaine's per
formance as the professor's wife
was superb, but otherwise the film
offers only limited entertainment.
The social comments are impor
tant, but far too blatant in their
presentation. Hopkins stumbles
through the film as if he were to
tally confused And Derek's only
redeeming qualities are her good
looks. In her role, she is super
ficial, insincere, even boring at
times. Unfortunately, the film is
much the same.
