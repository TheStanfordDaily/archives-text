ing the world's problems on a "British-Maltese-Zionist"

members of Congress and could harm Fager's reputation
with future employers. Fager. a former journalist and
Harvard Divinity School student who works for McCloskey
on the House Merchant Marine Committee staff, said he
believed that Laßouche's charge was in response to a
critical article Fager wrote about Laßouche in 1974
Demented though he may be. Laßouche clearly has
the financial means, organization, ability and determina
tion to attempt to cause major changes in the U.S. law and
policies. His words and actions should be followed with
care." McCloskey said in his speech
