## Soviets shift emphasis to weakened Afghan forces 
### Los Angeles Times 
New Delhi, India — The Soviets appear to be in
creasing their effort to turn over to Afghan troops
more of the responsibility for fighting the rebels
in Afghanistan, according to diplomatic reports
reaching here.
Western military sources are doubtful, how
ever, that the weak Afghan army will be able to
take on the additional burden.
The effort is perceived as the latest in a series
of Soviet attempts to implement a policy they had
hoped to carry out in the months just after they in
vaded Afghanistan in December 1979.
But the Afghan army, weakened by purges,
desertions and casualties to about one-third of the
90,000 men it had. has proved to be incapable of
combatting the stubborn guerrilla resistance that
grips so much of Afghanistan.
Most estimates put Soviet strength in Afghan
istan at 85.000 men.
Now, with cold weather slowing guerrilla ac
tivities, the Soviets have reportedly ordered Af
ghan army units to take over more of the fighting
Afghan plan
Western diplomats say that the Soviet-sup
ported Afghan regime of Babrak Karmal ap
proved on Jan. 18 a plan to use only Afghan sol
diers against the guerrilla forces.
Western military experts believe that Afghan
istan's army is far too weak to subdue or even con
trol the insurgency without Soviet help. An exam
ple of that weakness is contained in a Western
diplomatic report that described a recent five-day
government sweep in Wardak province,
southwest of Kabul, to locate draft evaders.
The report said that government troops carry
ing lists of names, apparently compiled by Marx

ists who used to live in the area, concentrated
their search in and around four settlements.
After the search, the report said, the unit com
mander gathered local elders together and in
formed them that the army would not leave until
the missing young men were produced Many of
the wanted men are believed to have fled into the
surrounding hills or across the mountain passes to
Pakistan.
Draft extension
Not long ago there were rumors of a govern
ment decree extending by six months the normal
two-year tour for military and security police
draftees, and the rumors were blamed for a riot in
Kabul last month.
A tough new military service law was ratified
by the regime earlier this month, according to an
other diplomatic report. It said that the law pro
vided that volunteers would be paid $50 to $75 a
month, nearly 10 times the pay of a conscript. The
draft age was said to have been lowered from 22 to
20.
Despite those reported efforts, however.
Western observers believe that there is little
chance that the regime can build a fighting force
strong enough to keep it in power without Soviet
help.
Those sources point out that the quality of sol
diers pressed into service is low, as is their
motivation Recent reports from the Panjshir
V r alley, northeast of Kabul, indicate that a joint
Soviet-Afghan force took substantial casualties
while trying to gain control of the strategically
important valley.
It is estimated that Soviet fatalities were be
tween 1200 and 1500 in their first year in Afghan
istan.
