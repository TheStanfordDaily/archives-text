Wounded journalists return
John Hoagland and Susan Meiselas wait near an ambulance as
they are interviewed by members of the Miami press corps, after
they were wounded in EI Salvador Monday. Hoagland, Meiselas
and a South African TV cameraman were injured when a land
mine exploded and wrecked their car.
