# 'Convertibility' key to future stability
## Separate economic path reaps rewards for Hungary 
### Washington Post 
Budapest — Slyly but surely, Hungary
is preparing for the next major hurdle in
its steady evolution away from a Soviet
styie state-run economy toward a mixed
socialist-capitalist market economy.
"Convertibility" is the hurdle, a dry
sounding word meaning the unrestricted
exchange of one currency for another:
American dollars or Japanese yen for
Hungarian forints. No other Soviet Bloc

News Analysis

country has attained convertibility be
cause their centrally run economies bear
little relationship to the global financial
system outside the bloc.
For Hungarians, convertibility has ac
quired remarkable importance as a
measure of this small, landlocked and re
source-poor country's will to rationalize
;its economy along Western lines despite
Moscow's ideological conservatism and
■traditional heavyhandedness.
> The crisis in Poland, carrying an ever
present threat of Soviet military in
tervention. has immeasurably raised the
stakes for the Hungarians in pursuing
their own economic goals. And Poland's
desperate economic troubles, as well as
stagnating economies throughout East
Europe, as well as the giant Soviet Union
itself have given additional significance
to the Hungarian moves.
• For these reasons. Communist Party
and government officials in their offices
on quiet back streets of this lovely
Danube River city are reluctant to speak
of it. "We don't like too much talk of this

until it's actually done," said one man
with a deprecatory smile.
'Strengthen economy'
In the Communist Bloc, as inside the
Kremlin Politburo, it can be dangerous
to go first. "This is not because we think
we are the most advanced," asserted
East-West trade expert Tibor An
talpeter, "but because we need it to
strengthen our economy. It is a question
of the best methods for our own objec
tives."
The Hungarians have been successful
ly pursuing those objectives remarkably
in the Communist East, ever since 1968
when the Janos Kadar leadership em
barked on the dangerous journey to mar
ket economics, using the so-called New
Economic Mechanism.
While diligently adhering to orthodox
Soviet foreign policies, Kadar has
brought his countrymen economic re
wards unrivalled in the bloc outside of
East Germany. Hungary earns half its
export income with the West and has en
tered into joint-stock companies in
places as far away as the United States
(a light-bulb factory) and Cyprus ( hybrid
root stocks for carnations and other
flogers).
Although buffeted by a counterattack
from conservatives in the early 1970s
that probably was inspired by Kremlin
hard-liners, and now hit hard by the
energy price stagflation like all other in
dustrializing countries, the Kadar lead
ership is pressing ahead with further re
forms.
Domestic prices are being steadily
brought into line with world prices, and
the reins cast off small-scale private en
terprise, with government actively en

couraging private concessionaires and
shops.
Doubled capital
Although the state foresees an annual
growth in the gross national product of
barely more than 1 percent through the
next five years because of inflation and
recession abroad, it has doubled to 70
billion forints the special investment
capital fund available to Hungarian
firms able to find better export markets
if they modernize.
In the context of these efforts, even the
limited convertibility being talked about
here would have enormous positive psy
chological impact on a nation whose 10.6
million citizens are Western-orienJted de
spite their position as a Soviet satellite.
Akos Balassa, head of the State Plan
ning Office's economics department,
said in a recent interview that con
vertibility might be achieved by 1985.
"Some political considerations play a
role," he said in a classic bit of Budapest
understatement. "There must be an ap
propriate world climate. We hope we can
do it, but it's not like we have to do it by
1985. At present, we are working hard to
establish the preconditions."
There are two official exchange rates
now for the forint, reflecting substantial
government subsidies that cushion con
sumers from inflation in the domestic
sector and support inefficient factories
and outmoded enterprises in the com
mercial industrial sector. In mid-Janu
ary, the tourist exchange rate was about
24 forints to the dollar, and the com
mercial, or trade, rate was about 32 to
the dollar.
Five years ago. these rates stood at 20
and 40. The gap has been narrowed as

domestic prices have been forced up
ward, and Hungarian industry forced in
creasingly to survive without massive
state intervention.
In the next five years, senior officials
say, the forint could be made convertible
on world money markets for approved
commercial transactions, but not for or
dinary citizens. "Limited convertibility,
similar to what various Third World
countries already have," said one knowl
edgeable source, making a comparison
the cosmopolitan and nationalistic Hun
garians might find distasteful.
The result would be to allow the forint
to circulate far more freely in the world,
easing business transactions, loan ar
rangements and deposits and payments
in ways that should further enhance Hun
gary's search for world markets.
The country's steady progress toward
this monetary milestone is being
watched with interest by the rest of the
bloc, especially Romania, which pursues
orthodox internal policies and an adven
turesome foreign policy that annoys the
Kremlin.
Despite their caution in talking about
their careful experiment, officials hers
also betray pride at what they have
achieved so far.
"It seems we will do this because
there is a strong will to do it," one party
economist said. "There is a very general
consensus among the politicians and the
economists that this must be done. It's
already been 12 years in the minds of the
bureaucrats in the National Planning Of
fice, achieving our mixed economy by
long-range and short-range plans. We
can't live any other way."
