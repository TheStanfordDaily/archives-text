# Arab summit calls for Israel boycott
## 
### Washington Post 
At Taif, Saudi Arabia —
Moslem leaders from 37 nations
and the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization Wednesday night for
mally approved a resolution ex
panding the Arab economic
boycott against Israel to all
members of their Islamic Con
ference and vowed to sever
diplomatic relations with any
country recognizing Jerusalem
as the Israeli capital.
Winding up a four-day sum
mit, the conference also issued
what it called the Mecca Decla
ration declaring that the
"prime Islamic cause of this
generation" shall be preparing
for a jihad, or holy war, "with
all the means at our disposal" to
liberate East Jerusalem and all
Israeli-occupied Arab lands.
The leaders also set in motion
a new high-level mediation ef
fort to end the four-month-old
war between Iran and Iraq and
passed a resolution on Afghan
istan that avoided a tough con
demnation of the Soviet Union in
order to facilitate negotiations
for the withdrawal of Soviet
troops there.
Expanded boycott
There were conflicting re
ports whether the conference
rejected a joint Syrian-Palesti
nian proposal calling on the
United Nations to "freeze" Is
rael's membership in the United
Nations. It did, however, set up
a new office within the Islamic
Conference organization to en
force an expanded trade and ec
onomic boycott using the same
list of companies trading with
Israel as used by the Arab
League, conference sources
said.
Altogether, it appeared that
the conference avoided taking
too extreme a position toward
Israel even while seeking to step
up economic and diplomatic
pressure on it and its sup
porters. Observers noted that
the notion of jihad as a military
holy war had been seriously
diluted and redefined to mean a
general mobilization of Islamic
nations' overall resources for a
long-term struggle.
While the various resolutions
still had not been published by
early yesterday morning, most
were reported simply to have
repeated well-known Arab posi
tions on Jerusalem and the
Palestinian issue.
Just how much additional
Arab pressure will be forth
coming now will depend on the
attitude of the 18 African and
Asian countries now pledged in
theory to enforce the Arab
boycott. The conference's reso
lutions are not technically bind
ing on its members, and even
some Arab countries have not
respected their own boycotts.
Iraqi demands
Earlier Wednesday at a spe
cial session the conference
heard Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein present in great detail

his country's case against Iran.
He ended with an offer to "re
store the Iranian lands occupied
(by Iraq) in the war," except for
his nation's "legitimate na
tional rights" over the entire
Shatt-al-Arab waterway and
several small pieces of
borderland.
This appeared to put an end to
speculation — spurred by com
ments of several Iraqi ministers
— that Iraq was claiming rights
to parts of Iran's oil-rich
Khuzistan Province in addition
to the strategic waterway sepa
rating the two countries.
Since Iran has refused to at
tend the summit, the Moslem
leaders gathered here have been
unable to make any progress
toward settling the war. They
did, however, decide to set up a
seven-member delegation of
heads of state to pursue the Is
lamic Conference's ongoing ef
forts to arrange a negotiated
solution to the war.
Afghanistan stance taken
On Afghanistan, the con
ference seemed to have sought a
middle road between the pro-So
viet Arab members such as Syr
ia and South Yemen, which seek
recognition of the Babrak
Karmal government, and the
more conservative ones that ad
vocate greater support for the
Afghan rebels fighting to over
throw it.
The resolution reportedly ex
presses only "serious concern"
over the continuation of "Soviet
armed intervention" and re
newed the conference's demand
for the "immediate and total
withdrawal of all foreign
troops" from Afghanistan
without specifically naming the
Soviet Union.
As Pakistani Foreign Min
ister Agha Shahi told reporters
here, "If you want to sit down
for a dialogue, you don't start by
condemning them (the Sovi
ets)."
Cooperation
The resolution also calls on all
parties to cooperate with U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim and his speaial repre
sentative in their efforts to get
talks underway between the
Babrak government and neigh
boring countries.
Spokesmen for the Afghan re
bels here said they were happy
with the expression of "full soli
darity" for their cause stated in
the Mecca Declaration and the
warm reception given them by
the conference, including their
first occasion to address the
Moslem leaders.
Altogether, the third summit
of Islamic leaders, the largest
ever, was devoid of the inter-
Arab acrimony that afflicted
the summit of Arab states held
in Amman, Jordan last Novem
ber. But conference efforts
failed to mend the ongoing feuds
between Syria and Iraq on the
one hand and Jordan and Syria
on the other.

nations' overall resources for a
long-term struggle.
While the various resolutions
still had not been published by
early yesterday morning, most
were reported simply to have
repeated well-known Arab posi
tions on Jerusalem and the
Palestinian issue.
Just how much additional
Arab pressure will be forth
coming now will depend on the
attitude of the 18 African and
Asian countries now pledged in
theory to enforce the Arab
boycott. The conference's reso
lutions are not technically bind
ing on its members, and even
some Arab countries have not
respected their own boycotts.
Iraqi demands
Earlier Wednesday at a spe
cial session the conference
heard Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein present in great detail

his country's case against Iran.
He ended with an offer to "re
store the Iranian lands occupied
(by Iraq) in the war," except for
his nation's "legitimate na
tional rights" over the entire
Shatt-al-Arab waterway and
several small pieces of
borderland.
This appeared to put an end to
speculation — spurred by com
ments of several Iraqi ministers
— that Iraq was claiming rights
to parts of Iran's oil-rich
Khuzistan Province in addition
to the strategic waterway sepa
rating the two countries.
Since Iran has refused to at
tend the summit, the Moslem
leaders gathered here have been
unable to make any progress
toward settling the war. They
did, however, decide to set up a
seven-member delegation of
heads of state to pursue the Is
lamic Conference's ongoing ef
forts to arrange a negotiated
solution to the war.
Afghanistan stance taken
On Afghanistan, the con
ference seemed to have sought a
middle road between the pro-So
viet Arab members such as Syr
ia and South Yemen, which seek
recognition of the Babrak
Karmal government, and the
more conservative ones that ad
vocate greater support for the
Afghan rebels fighting to over
throw it.
The resolution reportedly ex
presses only "serious concern"
over the continuation of "Soviet
armed intervention" and re
newed the conference's demand
for the "immediate and total
withdrawal of all foreign
troops" from Afghanistan
without specifically naming the
Soviet Union.
As Pakistani Foreign Min
ister Agha Shahi told reporters
here, "If you want to sit down
for a dialogue, you don't start by
condemning them (the Sovi
ets)."
Cooperation
The resolution also calls on all
parties to cooperate with U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim and his speaial repre
sentative in their efforts to get
talks underway between the
Babrak government and neigh
boring countries.
Spokesmen for the Afghan re
bels here said they were happy
with the expression of "full soli
darity" for their cause stated in
the Mecca Declaration and the
warm reception given them by
the conference, including their
first occasion to address the
Moslem leaders.
Altogether, the third summit
of Islamic leaders, the largest
ever, was devoid of the inter-
Arab acrimony that afflicted
the summit of Arab states held
in Amman, Jordan last Novem
ber. But conference efforts
failed to mend the ongoing feuds
between Syria and Iraq on the
one hand and Jordan and Syria
on the other.
At Taif, Saudi Arabia —
Moslem leaders from 37 nations
and the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization Wednesday night for
mally approved a resolution ex
panding the Arab economic
boycott against Israel to all
members of their Islamic Con
ference and vowed to sever
diplomatic relations with any
country recognizing Jerusalem
as the Israeli capital.
Winding up a four-day sum
mit, the conference also issued
what it called the Mecca Decla
ration declaring that the
"prime Islamic cause of this
generation" shall be preparing
for a jihad, or holy war, "with
all the means at our disposal" to
liberate East Jerusalem and all
Israeli-occupied Arab lands.
The leaders also set in motion
a new high-level mediation ef
fort to end the four-month-old
war between Iran and Iraq and
passed a resolution on Afghan
istan that avoided a tough con
demnation of the Soviet Union in
order to facilitate negotiations
for the withdrawal of Soviet
troops there.
Expanded boycott
There were conflicting re
ports whether the conference
rejected a joint Syrian-Palesti
nian proposal calling on the
United Nations to "freeze" Is
rael's membership in the United
Nations. It did, however, set up
a new office within the Islamic
Conference organization to en
force an expanded trade and ec
onomic boycott using the same
list of companies trading with
Israel as used by the Arab
League, conference sources
said.
Altogether, it appeared that
the conference avoided taking
too extreme a position toward
Israel even while seeking to step
up economic and diplomatic
pressure on it and its sup
porters. Observers noted that
the notion of jihad as a military
holy war had been seriously
diluted and redefined to mean a
general mobilization of Islamic
nations' overall resources for a
long-term struggle.
