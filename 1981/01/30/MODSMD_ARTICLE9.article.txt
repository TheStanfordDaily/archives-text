# Hometowns greet hostages
## 
### Associated Press 
The freed U.S. hostages started returning to
their hometowns yesterday, to the friendliness
and familiarity of small-town America and to
the people they grew up with. There were
miles of yellow ribbons, hundreds of "Wel
come" signs and even some apple pie from
neighbors.
"This is the real homecoming day, coming
back to your home neighborhood," Bruce La
ingen, 57, told friends who crowded his front
lawn in Bethesda, Md. "This sharing is a cele
bration of the feeling that this is the real end of
the episode."
Laingen, who was charge d'affaires at the
U.S. embassy in Tehran, then stepped up to an
oak tree and tore off the yellow ribbon that had
been tied there by his wife in November 1979
Mrs. Laingen's action was copied across the
country and yellow ribbons became the sym
bols of hope for the hostages' release.
The picture of life for the 52 Americans dur
ing 14Vz months in Iran became clearer, mean
while, as some of them gave details of their
treatment — treatment that apparently varied
widely and included beatings for some. The
former hostages tried to sort out their feelings.
"I want to explore in my own mind what I
think must have gone wrong.. . . Lessons must
be learned from this experience," said
Moorhead Kennedy, 50, as he walked through
his house in Washington, D C., pausing to touch
familiar items.
No regrets
Former hostage Michael Metrinko, 34, of
Olyphant, Pa., told a cheering crowd in front of
the Lackawanna County Court House: "If it
helped anyone at all to realize what freedom
means, I think it was worth it."
Metrinko was greeted at the Scranton air
port by Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. William Scran
ton 111 who said: "A native son has returned
home to us, to the people who love him most."
Frederick Lee Kupke, 34, of Francesville,
Ind., got a key to the city when he landed in In
dianapolis. Deputy Mayor Tom Henry said
Kupke has long had "the key to our hearts."
Kupke also was made a Sagamore of the
Wabash — Indiana's equivalent to a Kentucky
colonel.
Neighbors bring nourishment
When Bruce German, 43, and his wife ar
rived at their home in Rockville, Md., Wednes

day morning they found banners, yellow
flowers and a platter of apple pie and pumpkin
cake from neighbor Bobbie Rosenberg.
They'll need some nourishment," she said.
Elizabeth Ann Swift's neighbors in the
Georgetown area of Washington also brought
platters of food — tied up with yellow ribbons.
Even Swift's black terrier wore a yellow rib
bon. "Thank you all," said Swift, 39, one of two
women who were held hostage.
"It's fantastic. It's too much," said Alan
Golacinski, 29, of the welcome that he found at
his Silver Spring, Md., home. There were
bands playing, cheerleaders cheering and
dozens of the inevitable yellow ribbons.
Baseball catches attention
The youngest freed hostage, 21-year-old
Marine Sgt. Kevin Hermening, of Cudahy,
Wis., told a crowd that included Gov. Lee
Dreyfus in Milwaukee he was pleased his fa
vorite baseball team, the Brewers, had ac
quired catcher Ted Simmons from the St.
Louis Cardinals.
Hermening was presented with a lifetime
pass to Brewers games, met several of the
team's players and said he would be on hand to
throw out the first ball at the home opener on
April 16.
The Tehran Embassy's consul general,
Richard Morefield, 51, was saluted by 100,000
people along a 15-mile parade route topped off
by a huge sign put up by neighbors a block from
his San Diego home: "Almost Home, Dick."
Ribbons sold out
Yard goods stores throughout San Diego re
ported themselves sold out of yellow ribbon
before Morefield s h >mecoming.
Although Marine Sgt. Steven Kirtley's ar
rival time in Little Rock, Ark., was not an
nounced, several hundred people were at the
airport to greet him.
Kirtley, 22, told reporters, "I realize now
why animals pace around a cage," before
being whisked away to visit his father, who
was hospitalized during most of his captivity.
Marine Sgt. Rodney "Rocky" Sickmann, 23,
of Krakow, Mo., landed in St. Louis, thanked
the crowd for his welcome and said he knew
just what he wanted to do first: "Eat a home
cooked meal fixed by my mother." After that,
Sickmann said, "I want to go dancing."

why animals pace around a cage," before
being whisked away to visit his father, who
was hospitalized during most of his captivity.
Marine Sgt. Rodney "Rocky" Sickmann, 23,
of Krakow, Mo., landed in St. Louis, thanked
the crowd for his welcome and said he knew
just what he wanted to do first: "Eat a home
cooked meal fixed by my mother." After that,
Sickmann said, "I want to go dancing."
The freed U.S. hostages started returning to
their hometowns yesterday, to the friendliness
and familiarity of small-town America and to
the people they grew up with. There were
miles of yellow ribbons, hundreds of "Wel
come" signs and even some apple pie from
neighbors.
"This is the real homecoming day, coming
back to your home neighborhood," Bruce La
ingen, 57, told friends who crowded his front
lawn in Bethesda, Md. "This sharing is a cele
bration of the feeling that this is the real end of
the episode."
Laingen, who was charge d'affaires at the
U.S. embassy in Tehran, then stepped up to an
oak tree and tore off the yellow ribbon that had
been tied there by his wife in November 1979
Mrs. Laingen's action was copied across the
country and yellow ribbons became the sym
bols of hope for the hostages' release.
The picture of life for the 52 Americans dur
ing 14Vz months in Iran became clearer, mean
while, as some of them gave details of their
treatment — treatment that apparently varied
widely and included beatings for some. The
former hostages tried to sort out their feelings.
"I want to explore in my own mind what I
think must have gone wrong.. . . Lessons must
be learned from this experience," said
Moorhead Kennedy, 50, as he walked through
his house in Washington, D C., pausing to touch
familiar items.
No regrets
Former hostage Michael Metrinko, 34, of
Olyphant, Pa., told a cheering crowd in front of
the Lackawanna County Court House: "If it
helped anyone at all to realize what freedom
means, I think it was worth it."
Metrinko was greeted at the Scranton air
port by Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. William Scran
ton 111 who said: "A native son has returned
home to us, to the people who love him most."
Frederick Lee Kupke, 34, of Francesville,
Ind., got a key to the city when he landed in In
dianapolis. Deputy Mayor Tom Henry said
Kupke has long had "the key to our hearts."
Kupke also was made a Sagamore of the
Wabash — Indiana's equivalent to a Kentucky
colonel.
Neighbors bring nourishment
When Bruce German, 43, and his wife ar
rived at their home in Rockville, Md., Wednes

day morning they found banners, yellow
flowers and a platter of apple pie and pumpkin
cake from neighbor Bobbie Rosenberg.
They'll need some nourishment," she said.
Elizabeth Ann Swift's neighbors in the
Georgetown area of Washington also brought
platters of food — tied up with yellow ribbons.
Even Swift's black terrier wore a yellow rib
bon. "Thank you all," said Swift, 39, one of two
women who were held hostage.
"It's fantastic. It's too much," said Alan
Golacinski, 29, of the welcome that he found at
his Silver Spring, Md., home. There were
bands playing, cheerleaders cheering and
dozens of the inevitable yellow ribbons.
Baseball catches attention
The youngest freed hostage, 21-year-old
Marine Sgt. Kevin Hermening, of Cudahy,
Wis., told a crowd that included Gov. Lee
Dreyfus in Milwaukee he was pleased his fa
vorite baseball team, the Brewers, had ac
quired catcher Ted Simmons from the St.
Louis Cardinals.
Hermening was presented with a lifetime
pass to Brewers games, met several of the
team's players and said he would be on hand to
throw out the first ball at the home opener on
April 16.
The Tehran Embassy's consul general,
Richard Morefield, 51, was saluted by 100,000
people along a 15-mile parade route topped off
by a huge sign put up by neighbors a block from
his San Diego home: "Almost Home, Dick."
Ribbons sold out
Yard goods stores throughout San Diego re
ported themselves sold out of yellow ribbon
before Morefield s h >mecoming.
Although Marine Sgt. Steven Kirtley's ar
rival time in Little Rock, Ark., was not an
nounced, several hundred people were at the
airport to greet him.
Kirtley, 22, told reporters, "I realize now
why animals pace around a cage," before
being whisked away to visit his father, who
was hospitalized during most of his captivity.
