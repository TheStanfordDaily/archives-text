5 PM-12 PM Sat. Eves
Is now acceping jokes—short, long, dull, ugly,
cheery, peppy or whatever Each week all en
tries will be judged by your friendly neighbor
hood Classified Ads staff and the two "best
jokes" will be printed in the JOKES section.
The winners will be generously awarded a
coupon which they will be able to pick up at the
Daily Otfice (or the pizza of their choice at La
Ptaeria. What a deal?
A Kentucky airlines flight was approaching the
Louisville airport when the co-pilot notes:
"That's a short runway!
Undaunted the pilot orders: "Full ttßps."
Tension rising in his voice the co-pilot says.
"That's a really short runway "
The pilot commands "Minimum airspeed."
Panic grips the co-pilot as he warns. That s
an unbelievably short runway."
The pilot, still calm, prepares the crew.
"Maximum reverse thrust and full brakes as
soon as we touch down."
The plane touches down — engines roar,
brakes squeal as the plane barely stops
To the stunned co-pilot the pilot admits,
That was the shortest runway I've ever seen "
Looking side to side he adds. "The widest,
too."
As a young doctor was walking down the hall
he noticed that two nurses were staring at him
As he got closer one of the nurses asked.
"Doctor why do you have a thermometer be
hind your ear? Surprised, the doctor remarks
Gosh darn it! Some asshole has got my pen!"
