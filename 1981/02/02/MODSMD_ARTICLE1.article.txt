# Champs score trivia triumph
## Team wins local College Bowl 
### Mike Resnick 
Take the date of the defeat of the
Spanish Armada, add the number of
tones in a Schonberg scale, divide by
the number of legs a curlew has and
subtract the number of hills Rome is
built, on. Did you come up with 793° It
you didn't, don't feel too bad, you're in
good company. This mind-boggling
question is one of the few that com
petitors in yesterday's fourth annual
College Bowl were unable to answer.
After an entire day of competition
divided into 30 matches, the team
named Maid Marian and her Merry
Men won the right to represent Stan
ford in the Feb. 7 regional College
Bowl tournament, hosted by the defen
ding national champion, Cal-State
Fresno. Tom Bella via. Charley Brown
and Tom Gazzola, three of the four
team members, competed for the last
three years with the help of Nina
Miller. They were the Stanford cham
pions las* year, and the runners-up thp
year before. This year, Marian Men
ninger was added to the roster, and for
a change of pace, the team dropped its
former name.the Sociopaths.
This year's second place team, the
Team Flakes, is also experienced:
they held the No. 2 position last year
after losing to the Sociopaths by five
points in the last few seconds of the
final round. This year, the score was
335 to 360, with Maid Marian and her
band gaining the lead in the second
half of the last round
The scoring procedure illustrates
the large number of correct answers

needed to win the match. Toss-up
questions, which either team in a giv
en match could answer, were worth 10
points, while the bonus questions
posed to the first team to respond cor
rectly were valued between 20 and 30
points each. The finals consisted of
only two, twelve minute halves, re
sulting in a flow of information that
would rival any lecture.
The tournament proceded smoothly
due to the efforts of Peter Friedland, a
member of Stanford's 1978 National
Championship team, his wife, Rose
Grymes, a graduate student in cancer
biology, and John Shaw, a former Col
lege Bowl entrant and coach at Penn
State, who now works in the Palo Alto
area.
From the moment competition
began at 9 a.m yesterday until the end
of the finals round at 9:30 p.m., the
Friedlands and Shaw continuously ro
tated among the three roles of
moderator 'aski \g the qucition
stating the rules), time and
scorekeeper, and judge. Throughout
the day. there were only two breaks in
the tournament, one for lunch and a
second for dinner.
Despite the competitive mood and
length of the matches, the tone of the
day was light-hearted. Team names
such as Alondramat. Marge Eats Blue
Food and Donner Drunkenness evoked
an occasional snicker from the au
dience. and team members tried to
make as big an impression as possible.
Take, for example, Montezuma's
Revenge, a team attired in sport

coats. Clothing from the waist down,
as weil as assorted accessories, was of
a somewhat different mode, ranging
from shorts and sweat pants to a golf
club, a bottle of Montezuma's tequila
and a glass. One team member even
had a very powerful cigar : every time
he raised it to his mouth, he gave a cor
rect answer.
Much of the humor was spontane
ous. When asked what the dental spe
cialty of a prostodontist is, one com
petitor replied that it was "diseases of
the prostate." For lack of a better re
sponse, another person suggested that
"squaring a circle is the modern day
equivalent of a Chinese tire drill." A
player who perhaps had next week's
regional championship in mind,
thought that when an Englishman re
fers to anaubergine. he's really talk
ing about Fresno. Who needs another
word for eggplant anyway?

only two, twelve minute halves, re
sulting in a flow of information that
would rival any lecture.
The tournament proceded smoothly
due to the efforts of Peter Friedland, a
member of Stanford's 1978 National
Championship team, his wife, Rose
Grymes, a graduate student in cancer
biology, and John Shaw, a former Col
lege Bowl entrant and coach at Penn
State, who now works in the Palo Alto
area.
From the moment competition
began at 9 a.m yesterday until the end
of the finals round at 9:30 p.m., the
Friedlands and Shaw continuously ro
tated among the three roles of
moderator 'aski \g the qucition
stating the rules), time and
scorekeeper, and judge. Throughout
the day. there were only two breaks in
the tournament, one for lunch and a
second for dinner.
Despite the competitive mood and
length of the matches, the tone of the
day was light-hearted. Team names
such as Alondramat. Marge Eats Blue
Food and Donner Drunkenness evoked
an occasional snicker from the au
dience. and team members tried to
make as big an impression as possible.
Take, for example, Montezuma's
Revenge, a team attired in sport

coats. Clothing from the waist down,
as weil as assorted accessories, was of
a somewhat different mode, ranging
from shorts and sweat pants to a golf
club, a bottle of Montezuma's tequila
and a glass. One team member even
had a very powerful cigar : every time
he raised it to his mouth, he gave a cor
rect answer.
Much of the humor was spontane
ous. When asked what the dental spe
cialty of a prostodontist is, one com
petitor replied that it was "diseases of
the prostate." For lack of a better re
sponse, another person suggested that
"squaring a circle is the modern day
equivalent of a Chinese tire drill." A
player who perhaps had next week's
regional championship in mind,
thought that when an Englishman re
fers to anaubergine. he's really talk
ing about Fresno. Who needs another
word for eggplant anyway?

Take the date of the defeat of the
Spanish Armada, add the number of
tones in a Schonberg scale, divide by
the number of legs a curlew has and
subtract the number of hills Rome is
built, on. Did you come up with 793° It
you didn't, don't feel too bad, you're in
good company. This mind-boggling
question is one of the few that com
petitors in yesterday's fourth annual
College Bowl were unable to answer.
After an entire day of competition
divided into 30 matches, the team
named Maid Marian and her Merry
Men won the right to represent Stan
ford in the Feb. 7 regional College
Bowl tournament, hosted by the defen
ding national champion, Cal-State
Fresno. Tom Bella via. Charley Brown
and Tom Gazzola, three of the four
team members, competed for the last
three years with the help of Nina
Miller. They were the Stanford cham
pions las* year, and the runners-up thp
year before. This year, Marian Men
ninger was added to the roster, and for
a change of pace, the team dropped its
former name.the Sociopaths.
This year's second place team, the
Team Flakes, is also experienced:
they held the No. 2 position last year
after losing to the Sociopaths by five
points in the last few seconds of the
final round. This year, the score was
335 to 360, with Maid Marian and her
band gaining the lead in the second
half of the last round
The scoring procedure illustrates
the large number of correct answers

needed to win the match. Toss-up
questions, which either team in a giv
en match could answer, were worth 10
points, while the bonus questions
posed to the first team to respond cor
rectly were valued between 20 and 30
points each. The finals consisted of
only two, twelve minute halves, re
sulting in a flow of information that
would rival any lecture.
