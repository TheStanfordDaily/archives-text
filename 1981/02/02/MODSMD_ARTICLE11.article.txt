# Housing, waste disposal, budget cuts
## City of Palo Alto confronts the major issues 
### Gail Edmondson Schares 
Housing issues were first
priority when Palo Alto Mayor
Alan Henderson and City Man
ager William Zaner spoke to
Stanford students Thursday af
ternoon in Redwood Hall.
"The cost of housing in Palo
Alto is just about out of sight,"
Henderson admitted. "The
community is losing its young
families."
According to Zaner, ex
pensive housing is making it in
creasingly difficult to recruit
city workers. "The employee
pool is shrinking," he said.
The housing problem in Palo
Alto may also affect the nature
and type of industry in this area.
"We are seeing it happen al
ready," Zaner said.
He cited Hewlett-Packard as
an example: "Manufacturing
has already begun to move out;
research and high technology
have begun to move in and con
solidate."
The City Council established
the Palo Alto Housing Corpo
ration to help promote low-cost
housing in the community.
"Several developments are un
der way, and each is being
funded in a different way," Hen
derson said.
According to Zaner, one out of
every 10 housing units con
structed must be for low- to
middle-income families. "Fed
eral programs don't support
people here because the income
level is so high," Zaner said.

The City may also purchase
property and write off the
$400,000 to $500,000 per acre cost
of the land so a developer can
come in and provide low-income
housing to the community,
Zaner said.
Waste disposal was another
problem brought up at the meet
ing between students and the
two city officials. "The city
dump is about to be filled and
there is no other available site in
the community," Zaner said.
According to Zaner, the Joint
Powers Authority of North
County Cities is developing
ways to use garbage as an
energy producing resource.
"But it will take five to eight
years to build a facility which
will convert solid waste to
steam power. That means we
have to start today," Zaner
said.
Although Palo Alto is a highly
conservation conscious com
munity, no one wants to talk
about solid waste. "It's about
the least sexy subject around,"
Zaner said.
According to Henderson, ten
sion between Stanford and Palo
Alto has diminished over the
past I" years. He said, however,
"There is still a group in Palo
Alto that feels suspicious of eve
rything Stanford tries to do."
Stanford is not incorporated
in Palo Alto. "Thus the city
council has no jurisdiction over
Stanford except over industrial
and shopping areas," Hen

derson said.
Tension between the univer
sity and Palo Alto grew out of
the feeling in 1971 that Stanford
was developing too rapidly for
the city's taste. For example,
Stanford has continually
pressed for the extension of
Willow Road to El Camino Real.
"They need to extend the road
before they can begin a develop
ment of housing on the 24 acres
near the shopping center," Hen
derson explained.
However, Palo Alto is not in
the least interested in annexing
Stanford. "Stanford would be
one big financial problem for
Palo Alto. The city would have
to pay out for all the services it

provides (police, street main
tenance, utilities, etc.) and
would not receive enough reven
ue from Stanford to break
even," the city manager said.
Zaner also addressed the is
sue of Proposition 13 budget
cuts and the diminishing state
budget surplus. "Confusion on
this topic is understandable,"
he said. "No one in local govern
ment believes the state govern
ment, either."
"You have to understand this
issue in relation to the politics of
Sacramento," Zaner said.
"Brown doesn't want to be the
governor responsible for a tax
increase; he wants to stretch
out whatever is left as long as

possible. No one really knows
how much is left in the kitty."
Energy is one issue the city
officials can boast about. Ac
cording to Henderson, Univer
sity alumnus Herbert Hover
suggested in 1912 that Palo Alto
buy its own utilities.
"It was one of the best de
cisions the city ever made,"
Henderson said. Even in these
times of soaring energy costs,
the city can provide the same or
better service to Palo Alto resi
dents for a lower cost, he added
According to Henderson, the
profit supports added services
for the community.

"The cost of housing in Palo
Alto is just about out of sight,"
Henderson admitted. "The
community is losing its young
families."
According to Zaner, ex
pensive housing is making it in
creasingly difficult to recruit
city workers. "The employee
pool is shrinking," he said.
The housing problem in Palo
Alto may also affect the nature
and type of industry in this area.
"We are seeing it happen al
ready," Zaner said.
He cited Hewlett-Packard as
an example: "Manufacturing
has already begun to move out;
research and high technology
have begun to move in and con
solidate."
The City Council established
the Palo Alto Housing Corpo
ration to help promote low-cost
housing in the community.
"Several developments are un
der way, and each is being
funded in a different way," Hen
derson said.
According to Zaner, one out of
every 10 housing units con
structed must be for low- to
middle-income families. "Fed
eral programs don't support
people here because the income
level is so high," Zaner said.

The City may also purchase
property and write off the
$400,000 to $500,000 per acre cost
of the land so a developer can
come in and provide low-income
housing to the community,
Zaner said.
Waste disposal was another
problem brought up at the meet
ing between students and the
two city officials. "The city
dump is about to be filled and
there is no other available site in
the community," Zaner said.
According to Zaner, the Joint
Powers Authority of North
County Cities is developing
ways to use garbage as an
energy producing resource.
"But it will take five to eight
years to build a facility which
will convert solid waste to
steam power. That means we
have to start today," Zaner
said.
Although Palo Alto is a highly
conservation conscious com
munity, no one wants to talk
about solid waste. "It's about
the least sexy subject around,"
Zaner said.
According to Henderson, ten
sion between Stanford and Palo
Alto has diminished over the
past I" years. He said, however,
"There is still a group in Palo
Alto that feels suspicious of eve
rything Stanford tries to do."
Stanford is not incorporated
in Palo Alto. "Thus the city
council has no jurisdiction over
Stanford except over industrial
and shopping areas," Hen

derson said.
Tension between the univer
sity and Palo Alto grew out of
the feeling in 1971 that Stanford
was developing too rapidly for
the city's taste. For example,
Stanford has continually
pressed for the extension of
Willow Road to El Camino Real.
"They need to extend the road
before they can begin a develop
ment of housing on the 24 acres
near the shopping center," Hen
derson explained.
However, Palo Alto is not in
the least interested in annexing
Stanford. "Stanford would be
one big financial problem for
Palo Alto. The city would have
to pay out for all the services it

provides (police, street main
tenance, utilities, etc.) and
would not receive enough reven
ue from Stanford to break
even," the city manager said.
Zaner also addressed the is
sue of Proposition 13 budget
cuts and the diminishing state
budget surplus. "Confusion on
this topic is understandable,"
he said. "No one in local govern
ment believes the state govern
ment, either."
"You have to understand this
issue in relation to the politics of
Sacramento," Zaner said.
"Brown doesn't want to be the
governor responsible for a tax
increase; he wants to stretch
out whatever is left as long as

possible. No one really knows
how much is left in the kitty."
Energy is one issue the city
officials can boast about. Ac
cording to Henderson, Univer
sity alumnus Herbert Hover
suggested in 1912 that Palo Alto
buy its own utilities.
"It was one of the best de
cisions the city ever made,"
Henderson said. Even in these
times of soaring energy costs,
the city can provide the same or
better service to Palo Alto resi
dents for a lower cost, he added
According to Henderson, the
profit supports added services
for the community.
Housing issues were first
priority when Palo Alto Mayor
Alan Henderson and City Man
ager William Zaner spoke to
