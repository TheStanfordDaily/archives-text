New York (AP) — Militants
who seized the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran found "a treasure
trove" of classified materials
including a document indicating
two of their hostages were CIA
officers and a third was possibly
connected with the agency,
Time magazine reported Sun
day.
The magazine, in a report on
protection of intelligence mate
rials at U.S. embassies, said
militants found a document in
dicating that William Daugher
ty and Malcolm Kalp were CIA
officers. The document had a
marginal note — "Show to Tom
A." — which suggested to the
militants that embassy official
Thomas Ahern was connected to
the CIA, Time reported.
The three suffered harsher
treatment than other captives,

Time said. Kalp reportedly was
beaten twice and kept in
solitary confinement for 374
days.
After the embassy seizure,
the State Department issued no
information on the embassy
duties of Daugherty, 33, of Os
sining, N.Y., or Kalp, 42, of
Fairfax, Va. Ahern, 48, of Falls
Church, Va., was described by
the department as its embassy
narcotics control officer.
Time said American officials
at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
destroyed almost all sensitive
communications equipment and
many documents as the com
pound was stormed Nov. 4,1979.
But, Time reported, contents of
the safes of charge d'affairs
Bruce Laingen and political of
ficer Michael Metrinko were
captured intact and provided "a

treasure trove of information."
Included were the document
supposedly linking the three
men to the Central Intelligence
Agency and "several com
promising documents that, ac
cording to State Department of
ficials, should have been
shredded soon after Laingen re
ceived them," Time said.
The magazine said the files
did not name "local CIA
agents" in Iran because such of
ficials are only listed in a gov
ernment computer in Virginia.
But militants recovered em
bassy documents that contained
names of Iranians who visited
the embassy, and U.S. officials
believe that many of those per
sons were arrested and some
were executed, the magazine
said.
