# Evidence of earliest human technology
## Ancient stone tools discovered 
### 
New York (AP) — Stone tools
half a million years older than
any previously known have been
dug from the banks of a desolate
East African gully and appear
to provide the earliest evidence
of human technology, scientists
say.
The tools, believed to be at
least 2.5 million years old, were
found with fragments of animal
bone at what may be an ancient
campsite.
The discovery has not been
formally made public in scien

tific literature, but those in
volved agreed to discuss their
work with The Associated Press
after it was mentioned at scien
tific conferences.
Scientists who have studied
them say the tools are similar to
— but much older than —
primitive tools found at other
African sites that have pre
viously been regarded as signal
ing the dawn of human culture.
The discovery of tools and
bones together provides the
earliest evidence of the shift in
diet that occurred when our an
cestors included meat in an oth
erwise vegetarian fare, scien
tists said.
More importantly, they may
be the first evidence of human
cooperation, group behavior
and the concept of a "home."
The tools, found at Hadar in
the desolate Afar region of
northeastern Ethiopia, consist
of 48 stone cutting flakes, some
of them razor-sharp, and three
fist-sized "choppers."
They were found by the In
ternational Afar Expedition, a
French-American team led by
Maurice Taieb of the French
National Center for Scientific
Research (CNRS) in Marseille,
Yves Coppens of the Musee de
I'Homme in Paris and Don
Johanson of the Cleveland
Museum of Natural History.
"The basis for the date is that
the rock strata in which the
artifacts were found was situ
ated immediately above a vol
canic ash horizon dated to

around 2.8 million years,"
Johanson said.
The tools were unearthed in
1977, but it was not until a geo
logical survey of the area last
year that their antiquity was
proved.
"There doesn't seem to be
any question now that these are
dated at 2.5 million years or pos
sibly older. This would make
them the oldest evidence of cul
tural practices of the early
hominids by more than half a
million years," said Jack
Harris, an archeologist at the
University of Pittsburgh.
Previously, the oldest known
tools were from the Omo River
in southern Ethiopia and were
made just over 2 million years
ago. Tools of nearly that age
have been found in Tanzania and
Kenya.
In a sense, the discovery of
the tools deepens the mystery of
human origins because they are
considerably younger than the
fossil hominids, or human an
cestors, found so far at Hadar.
'It raises the question of who
was making these artifacts,"
said Harris, "since we've got no
hominids in that time horizon. "
And the tools are a half mil
lion years older than Homo
habilis, the first member of the
genus Homo (which includes
man) and our first ancestor to
show an enlarged brain sug
gestive of higher intelligence.
