## Of duty, the draft and freedom bought with blood 
### 
This is not an easy column tc
write. The reams of print which
have already appeared in the
Daily on the "topic of draft regis
tration (most of it in opposition)
would seem to have exhausted
the subject. I have attempted to
argue my point of view on the
topic in page after page of facts
and figures and forecasts which
ultimately ended up in the trash
can by my desk. But I think that
the core of the debate does not
lie in statistical justificaitons -
no one volunteers to risk his
life in a war merely to redress a
numerical imbalance between
his own forces and those of an
enemy.
I am an officer in the United
States Army.
I think that fact gives me a far
greater personal interest in
peace than anyone who is pres
ently a civilian.
I am an officer in the United
States Army because I feel that
the historically unprecendented
degree of personal freedom
which we so much enjoy and so
much take for granted in this
country has been bought with
blood, and maintained at a cost
of human lives, and is in
jeopardy.
That is an ugly thought —
"bought with blood". It is not a
nice thing to believe, and cer
tainly not to say. It almost
causes one to cringe.
I think we need to cringe a lit
tle in this generation. I think
that we are profoundly un
grateful, not to mention intense
ly naive.
There are no such things as
"human rights".
There should be human
rights; there should be univer
sal peace, or at least a desire for
it; there should be universal dis
armament.
But those who think that we
can safely lay down our arms
and inspire others to follow our
example are living in a Rodgers
and Hammerstein world of il

lusion.
We can not take the lead in ad
vancing the cause of world
peace until we have made
known our determination and
our ability to resist inroads upon
the rights of free people on all
parts of this planet.
No. we should not attempt to
be the "world's policeman."
But when we left Viet Nam,
and the "popular uprising" suc
ceeded, the North Vietnamese
Army (with considerable help
from the USSR) "united" the
country and conducted a sys
tematic slaughter of the politi
cal, cultural, and intellectual
leaders of the South. They
caused the death of (quite liter
ally millions) of humans
through execution and starva
tion. They have pursued an ag
gressively imperialist policy
with the obvious intention of ag
grandizement of power in South
east Asia.
If we do not stand up against
that, who will?
If the Soviets invade Poland,
who will stand up for the rights
which will be brutally stripped
away from the Polish people?
They do not yet enjoy even a
fraction of the almost obscenely
underappreciated civil liberties
in which we wallow.
I hope to God (and I mean that
sincerely) that there will never
be another war. I believe that
peace is an attainable, over
whelmingly desirable state —
that it is the most important
way of life but one: freedom.
Freedom is better than peace, if
one is forced to choose between
the two.
That is why this paper is being
printed — why you stand free on
soil bought with your ancestors'
blood — why your have a right to
resist the draft.
But if you resist the draft (a
perfectly justifiable position)
and go to jail or to Canada —
stay in jail, or stay in Canada.

You forfeit your right to enjoy
the freedoms of the United
States by refusing to defend
them.
A reactionary attitude? A
gross oversimplification of a
complicated moral issue?
You're damn right.
But I don'-t want to risk my
life to protect the rights of
. someone who does not want to
pay a price for those rights. I
don't want to risk my life at all
— I want to sit under the stars
with a guitar and the girl I love
and be at peace with the world
and myself, always.
As long as there are people in
this world who can not stand on
free soil under their own stars,
though, I can not do the same
with a clear conscience. As a
free man. I owe others the right
to be free.
The United States has erred in
some instances by supporting
oppressive regimes — but a
right-wing autocracy is no
worse than a left-wing auto
cracy, and we have done far
more good than harm in our at
tempts to improve the lot of oth--
er peoples in this world. It is
pointless to reduce our effec
tiveness with ruthless self
castigation. I find it hard to be
lieve that many demand a
higher standard of morality in
our international relations than
they are willing to apply in their
own personal lives.
There is no suai thing as
absolute morality in this world
— to use a worn phrase, it is all
relative. Even I know that by
now, and I am still a victim of a
high degree of ideological
gullibility.
To end this ser
mon/diatribe catharsis, let me
modify a statement by Theodore
Roosevelt:
1
"Speak of peace with elo
quence, with vigor, with convic
tion; pray tna't it will result —
but keep a big sticn within ready

reach, because you may need it
regardless of your oratorical fa
cility or obvious sincerity, and
big sticks seem to be helpful in
getting the other guy to listen to
what you have to say."
I recognize that a column like
this will provide many op
portunities to formulate vocif
erous replies. Feel free. I just
grew tired of endless columns
which ranted of the sins of the
U.S., of the lack of freedom in
this country, of the sinister
motives of the military estab
lishment, etc.
I am one of those sinister

types, and I lurk here in your
midst. I am not noticeably
bloodthirsty, nor am I particu
larly courageous. I am fright
ened of war, because I may be
* killed in one. I, like all soldiers
of all epochs, cherish peace with
every new day. But I cherish
freedom with every breath —
and so I choose to serve. So must
we all serve, in one way or an
other, for democracy demands
a duty and freedom is not free.
Decide now how you will pay for
your share.
