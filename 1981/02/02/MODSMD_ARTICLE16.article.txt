More on Chalk
Scarcely three days after 52
Americans were released from
a prolonged period of captivity,
the Daily and Philip Chalk have
the incredible bad taste to run
the cartoon featured in Friday's
Daily. While it may turn out that
some of the former prisoners
will write about their ex
periences, I venture that none cf
them think that their celebrity
status was worth 14 months'
captivity. The cartoon was ill
timed, insulting, and calls for an
apology.

Gasohol now
A panel of experts of the
American Association for the
Advancement of Science meet
ing in Toronto (AP news, Jan.
9) reported warning against the
use of gasohol, 90 percent
gasoline and 10 percent grain al
cohol. This is evidently a wise
directive. However, there is an
other auto fuel which can be
used after a slight conversion of
the engine. This fuel is 95
percent grain alcohol and 5
percent gasoline. The by-prod
uct, if corn is used, is even more
nutritious than the corn itself,
according to American Home
grown Fuel Co. in San Francis
co. This alcohol fuel would cost
43 cents a gallon. The added ad
vantages would be no smog in
the air and less wear and tear on
the car engine.
Tlie Palo Alto Cooperative So

ciety has a group of members
who are taking steps to form an
alcohol as fuel co-op. There
would be one still for the group,
and for long trips, extra fuel
could be stored in the car, as it is
not explosive.
In recent news we were told
of the burning of rice chaff in the
Sacramento area as causing
smog and health problems. Rice
chaff and other vegetable waste
could be used to make the auto
fuel of the future.
Why go to war in the Persion
Gulf to protect the sources of
oil? We have the means to make
our own auto and other fuel. Can
it be that the established oil cor
porations are blocking the way?
Decentralization may be the an
swer. "Small is beautiful," said
E.F. Schumacher. Let us try it
out.

Bad economics
Boy, I'm sure glad we have
Bob Pahre around to tell us how
misinformed are Laffer, Stock
man, and Kemp. I'd hate to
think that Stanford admits any
but the best economists into its
undergraduate program.
In his tirade against Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's economic
plans, Pahre makes one wonder
if he is serious or not. If he is se
rious, his attempt to fill us in on
the "realities of economics''
does nothing of the kind.
In his explanation of the futili
ty of tax cuts, he shows either a

profound (but unique) misun
derstanding or complete dis
regard for money multiplier
theory. His unyielding link be
tween defense spending and in
flation is absurd, as is his refer
ence to defense spending as a
cause of unemployment.
I must admit that I was
shocked by his acknowl
edgement of the existence of an
international economy. This in
tricate insight seemed to be his
tours de force.
Pahre managed to explain the
complexities of domestic eco
nomics to us while showing only
a meager knowledge of the sub
ject. Although economics is not
an exact science, it does present
some accurate theory, all of
which is more enlightening than
Pahre's commentary. I am sure
I speak for our president in
saying, "Thanks, Bob, but no
thanks."

Dubious tribute
I think it's important that the
Stanford community be in
formed that in honor of Ronald
("Ronnie") Reagan's inaugura
tion into the office of President
of the United States, Terra
House served a special and truly
American meal on January 21,
1981: TV dinners.
