# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## David Forsythe Reagan deserves a chance 
### 
Maybe it's just my imagina
tion, but I sense that there is a
feeling which pervades the vari
ety of public opinion in our na
tion: fear. Some of us fear what
the new presidential adminis
tration may bring, others fear
that world events may lead to
war, and still others join the
masses in dreading the conse
quences of the current state of
our economy.
Given this fear and uncertain
ty, the time has come for the na
tion to seek security and
cohesion. Particularly now,
with a transition in our gov
ernmental leadership, Ameri
cans are searching for security
in a critical time of change.
In times such as these, the
worst thing for President
Ronald Reagan and for the na
tion is internal conflict, which

aggravates the anxiety the
country feels. Recognizing this
danger brings us to a distressing
observation. There is a group of
people, here on campus and
elsewhere, who invite conflict
and refuse to give the new ad
ministration a fair chance to
succeed or fail on its merits.
We have all heard them —
they are the people who thrive
on derisive name-calling and
anti-Reagan jokes, and general
ly predict disaster in the next
four years. Among them are the
same individuals who used simi
lar tactics in the election cam
paign: avoiding discussion of is
sues by opting for unfounded
blanket ridicule of Reagan in
stead. I suppose some of this is
to be expected of over-zealous
campaigners, but now that the
election has been decided, it is
time to stop.
Ronald Reagan is now our
president; he represents those
who voted for him as well as
those who did not. Having
gained the office by our legit
imate democratic process, he
now deserves the support of the
nation at large. Without it, both
he and we shall suffer.
By support, I do not mean
blind submission to every de
cision of the executive. En
lightened criticism is the cor
nerstone of our pluralistic de
cision-making process. Those
who rationally disagree with the
president's policies should
make their opinions known and
offer alternatives. I do not sug
gest that we "rally 'round the
president" like so many sub
jects around a king.
Rather, we must avoid

simple-minded attacks on the
man without reference to his
ideas or programs. The In
auguration Day display on Hoo
ver Tower is a prime example of
such unreasoned opposition, ap
pealing to the simplest of human
instincts in order to incite dis
sent. Such practices unfairly
condemn the administration
from the outset.
The unfounded criticism to
which I refer is more than just
useless and non-productive; it is
dangerous. Without public sup
port, the administration is
weakened in initiation legisla
tion. More important, the presi
dent is perceived as a weak
leader by nations abroad and
our national stature is similarly
weakened. If Reagan's
domestic adversaries chan
neled their energy into positive
action on the nation's behalf,
each faction would be better
served.
It is the responsibility of us all
to give the president a fair
chance to succeed; to deny him
that chance is to ensure the very
doom his basest critics predict.
It is the right and duty of those
who disagree with President
Reagan's ideas to express their
opposition and to work for their
own proposals. But I question
the wisdom and prudence of
those who engage in arbitrary
and non-productive name-call
ing which inflicts damage upon
the ability of the thinking people
of our nation to rationally ad
dress the serious problems we
face.

nerstone of our pluralistic de
cision-making process. Those
who rationally disagree with the
president's policies should
make their opinions known and
offer alternatives. I do not sug
gest that we "rally 'round the
president" like so many sub
jects around a king.
Rather, we must avoid

simple-minded attacks on the
man without reference to his
ideas or programs. The In
auguration Day display on Hoo
ver Tower is a prime example of
such unreasoned opposition, ap
pealing to the simplest of human
instincts in order to incite dis
sent. Such practices unfairly
condemn the administration
from the outset.
The unfounded criticism to
which I refer is more than just
useless and non-productive; it is
dangerous. Without public sup
port, the administration is
weakened in initiation legisla
tion. More important, the presi
dent is perceived as a weak
leader by nations abroad and
our national stature is similarly
weakened. If Reagan's
domestic adversaries chan
neled their energy into positive
action on the nation's behalf,
each faction would be better
served.
It is the responsibility of us all
to give the president a fair
chance to succeed; to deny him
that chance is to ensure the very
doom his basest critics predict.
It is the right and duty of those
who disagree with President
Reagan's ideas to express their
opposition and to work for their
own proposals. But I question
the wisdom and prudence of
those who engage in arbitrary
and non-productive name-call
ing which inflicts damage upon
the ability of the thinking people
of our nation to rationally ad
dress the serious problems we
face.
