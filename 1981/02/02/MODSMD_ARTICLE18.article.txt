## China, the RYB, and old ideas unbroken 
### 
The Stanford campus must be
a Madison Avenue dream. Im
agine thousands of im
pressionable, mostly wealthy
young students, all captive and
ripe for advertising. And Lord,
is there advertising. Advertis
ing on the kiosks, in the Quad, on
classroom walls, on every table
in the dining halls, in the
hallways, lounges, and rooms of
residential academia. Go into
the bathroom on my floor and
find a notice for the Stanford
Opera. Looks like nothing is sa
cred, after all.
One ad in particular has been
catching my eye recently — the
students in charge of this baby
woMd .make P. T. Barnum
proud, ifcs for a film called
Breaking wmb Old Ideas. Hmm.
What's the moV'ie about? Let's
read the first — it
sounds significant, yjffreaking
with Old,/ideas is a tJPjlfeared
and. nated — by those now
rule China. It is a devastating
weapon against their attempt to
enslave the Chinese people and
their desire to dismantle Mao's
revolutionary line. They wish
they could burn every reel of
this film.'' Wow. Heavy stuff
But wait a minute. There's no
mention of the sponsor here.
Who's presenting this film? Are
they so revolutionary or so in
danger of reprisal that they
daren't show their name?
Hardly.
An educated guess (assuming
one has at least sixth grade
education) tells me that the
good folks showing "Breaking
with Old Ideas" are the Revolu
tionary Youth Brigade. That's
what the Marxist down the hall
tells me, too. What's their
cause? Apparently, it's to prove
that Jiang Qing, widow of
Mao Tse-Tung and member of
the Gang of Four on trial in Chi
na, is guilty of being truer to the
revolutionary cause there than
the present government trying
her for crimes against the peo
ple (crimes like torture,
murder, and repression).
" Guilty!' cry the Coca-Cola
judges .... 'Guilty!' wimpers
(sic) Deng Xiaoping from be
neath his white cowboy hat....
'Guilty!' screams the

bourgeoisie . ..." so goes the
ad. That last quoted word's the
key. We're supposed to see this
film out of rage against the
bourgeoisie, the system. Dona
tion $2.
I don't even mind that very
much. I'm no rock-ribbed con
servative either. I have very
deep-seated fears and ap
prehensions about Fuhrer
elect Reagan. You won't catch
me at a Young Republicans
meeting (or at any''political or
ganization" meeting, for that
matter.) I'm not a big man of
the system.
But look at how the Revolu
tionary Youth Brigade (or who
ever they are) use the system
that they hate so. They try to
look persecuted and play the un
derdog, like an underground
group of the 60's. And yes, the
flier for the film does have that
certain after-hours-run-at-the-
Xerox look. But I'm going to
have a hard time believing that
they're really in any danger. A
little strapped for cash, but no
danger.
It doesn't seem likely that the
Chinese government is too con
cerned about a bunch of radical
theoreticians in California, of
all places. I get the feeling from
the ad that the reason the name
is withheld is so people won't be
turned off by the connotations of
working with "the Brigade".
How noble. How insecure. This
isn't exactly marching forth to
meet the enemy bourgeoisie.
It's more like deceit.
There's more insecurity in
the language of the flier. Of
course, it's intended to raise
one's hackles a bit about the
world we live in (and perpetuate
simply by going to Stanford).
But the extremes and buzz
words used in the ad (see quota
tions above) are the same de
vices used by Karl Marx in the
Communist Manifesto, where
the bourgeoisie was always
"petty" and invariably referred
to as "it." The proletariat, on
the other hand, was almost
bursting with human fellowship
and goodwill. In both cases, the
result is very biased, very emo
tional, and very slick in its per
suasive powers. Open-minded

revolutionaries deserve better.
Somehow, all the radical
jargon seems appropriate, for
the apparent point of the flier is
that the pragmatic Chinese gov
ernment of today isn't truly rev
olutionary. The Brigade, conse
quently, must be.
Not only did I not know that
the two groups are necessarily
exclusive, but neither did I ex
pect this arguing about "who is
the more radical?" The Chinese
government is just as emotional
about their socialism as the
Brigade is about theirs. For a
movement supposedly based on
proletarian solidarity, there's a
lot of dissension here.
Perhaps revolutionary ethics
isn't the point, though. It could
well be publicity. You think all
this advertising is cheap?
Besides, then the sponsors of
"Breaking with Old Ideas''
would follow the example of the
60s "underground", who (judg
ing by their press releases)
weren't all that underground af
ter all.
Abbie Hoffman, for instance,
just resurfaced recently. What
happened to him when he did?
Well, he got arrested. He also
got interviewed by Barbara
Walters on national television

He'll probably get off on his
criminal charge, and end up
much wealthier for his time.
These guys may be radical, but
they're not dumb. Apparently,
neither are the sponsors of this
film.
Of course, you can easily sit
back while reading this and say,
"This petty bourgeois capitalist
is wrong." And I might just be
missing the boat on the whole
idea. I haven't seen "Breaking
with Old Ideas." I don't know
the students sponsoring its
showing. And hey, the Brigade
has to eat, right? The Marxist
down the hall is really happy
with his $7 an hour job, even if it
does sound like capitalist ex
ploitation.
At least he's consistent — he
has reconciled his job with his
ideas, and I see his points in
both. It doesn't look like that's
the case with Breaking with Old
Ideas. Marx wrote in the Man--
ifest that the bourgeoisie de
velops out of the proletarians —
as some of the workers rise,
they change their ideas and
wind up as the enemy of what
they once believed. Revolu
tionary Youth Brigade, please
read and take note.
