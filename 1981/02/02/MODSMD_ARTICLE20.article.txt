## Stockman suggests funding cuts 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — A reduction of
$1 billion in federal job funds
and a $2 billion cut in Social Se
curity benefits for college stu
dents next year were proposed
to key congressional Re
publican leaders Friday by
President Ronald Reagan's
budget director.
An inch-thick black notebook
containing dozens of deep cuts
in social programs was de
livered to Capitol Hill by David
Stockman, Director of the Of
fice of Management and Budget
(OMB), to get congressional re
action.
Stockman suggested a five
year phasedown of the con
troversial Comprehensive Em
ployment and Training Act
(CETA) that would reduce its
outlays by $5.1 billion a year by
1985, it was learned.
He also backed elimination of
the monthly benefits paid for
college students up to the age of
22 under the Social Security pro

gram for survivors of wage
earners covered by the system.
He said truly needy students
could get college aid from other
places, according to one source.
Sharp reductions in funds for
food stamps, Aid for Dependent
Children, sewer construction,
import-related jobless benefits,
Medicaid, rural electric pro
grams and health planning also
were among Stockman's pro
posals that he discussed at a
lunch with House Republican
leaders. Each was asked to give
a pledge of secrecy about the
proposed cuts. It was the third
in a series of 17 meetings the
OMB chief has scheduled with
top Democratic and Republican
members of Congress to test the
political winds.
Stockman emphasized the
need to focus on a five-year
spending reduction plan.
"These are options we think
are worth looking at," Stock
man told a reporter during a
break in his meetings. "We

want their advice and alter
native suggestions. We got very
good feedback today (Friday)."
Meantime, the government
issued some downbeat econom
ic reports. The Department of
Commerce's index of leading in
dicators dropped by 0.8 percent
in December, providing another
sign of an economic slowdown in
1981. It was the first decline af
ter increases for six months in a
row.
Seven of the 10 indicators fell
last month, with a drop in the
nation's money supply the most
important factor in the overall
change. Other declining Decem
ber indicators were new orders
for consumer goods, contracts
for plants and equipment, prices
for key raw materials, building
permits, stock prices and liquid
assets.
The Department of Labor
also reported that business
productivity, a key measure of
economic performance, fell by
0.3 percent in 1980, the third con

secutive year of decline.
Productivity edged down last
year because output of goods
and services rose by 6.3 percent,
lagging behind the increase of
8.4 percent in paid working
hours.
The 0.3 percent decline in 1980
came on the heels of a 0 4
percent dip in 1979 and a 0.2
percent decrease in 1978 — the
worst three-year record since
the end of World War 11.
In a statement, President
Reagan said his economic pro
posals would deal with the slug
gish economy and inflation si
multaneously.
"While no one set of economic
reports is conclusive, this bat
tery of bad economic news from
last year's 'inheritance' under
scores the need to turn this
economy around," Reagan said
in reacting to the drop in leading
indicators.
In another development,
Citibank lowered its prime lend
ing rate for most favored cus
tomers to 19.5 percent, the sec
ond major bank this week to
lower the rate from 20 percent.
On Capitol Hill, Rep. Clair
Burgener (R-Calif.) said the
budget cuts put forward by
Stockman were designed to be
considered as a package. "If
you bring it up piecemeal, you'll
get shot down piecemeal," he
told a reporter.
