# Penthouse to fight injunction

### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — Penthouse
publisher Bob Guccione said
Saturday that an attempt by the
Rev. Jerry Falwell, founder of
the Moral Majority, to block dis
tribution of the March issue of
the magazine will boost sales by
a half million copies.
"Normally, we couldn't af
ford a promotional genius like
Falwell," Guccione said.
"We're happy to have him."
Guccione, in Los Angeles on
business, said in an interview
that he will fight an order by
U.S. District Judge James Turk
in Roanoke, Va., banning dis
tribution of Penthouse to maga
zine racks across the country.
The ban was requested by
Falwell, subject of a Penthouse
interview in the March issue. In
the interview, Falwell blasts
fellow Baptist Jimmy Carter
for granting his famous "lust"
interview to Playboy.
Playboy, Falwell said, is
"salacious, vulgar."

Struck by the irony of his own
appearance in Penthouse,
Falwell attacked it, too, calling
it a magazine filled with "smut
and porn." He claimed he was
tricked by two free-lance jour
nalists who sold his interview to
Guccione.
But the Penthouse publisher
said the pair, Andrew Duncan
and Sashti Brata, had told
Falwell they planned to sell the
interview wherever they could
— and Falwell had no objection.
Guccione also defended Play
boy, saying "I see Fallwell's
mind as being salacious and vul
gar, because vulgarity is in the
mind of the beholder."
Nor does he think Penthouse
contains smut or porn.
"I think Falwell is a very nar
row-minded, very bigoted man,
heavily opinionated, op
pressively opinionated," Guc
cione said. He contended that
the court order violates the
First Amendment, which he

said Falwell told his in
terviewers he would die to de
fend.
"The man is a hypocrite,"
Guccione said.
He said his staff telephoned
distributors after the court or
der in an effort to stop circula
tion under the court order — but
in some instances it was too
late. Six million copies, he said,
already were on their way to
newsstands.
Issues on the stands — plus
those freed for distribution if he
wins the court battle — will be
sold out, Guccione predicted.
"This points out the fate of
every would-be censor," he
said. "This demonstrates again
that the censor invariably
creates the very situation he
hopes to kill. He calls attention
to the thing that he doesn't want
the public to see.
"I think this will probably in
crease our sales by about 10
percent, meaning about 500,000
copies."
