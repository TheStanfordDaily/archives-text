# Internal security panel revived
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — An old. familiar institution is
about to make a comeback in Washington,
arousing memories of the time not too long ago
when it played the leading role in an unsettling
drama that transfixed the nation
It is the congressional internal security
panel — a new group of lawmakers authorized
to investigate policies, groups and individuals
perceived to pose a threat to the nation or its
way of life.
In December, shortly after taking over as
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Sen. Strom Thurmond. (R-S.C.>, created a new
subcommittee on security and terrorism with
responsibility for overseeing activities of the
FBI and other law enforcement agencies
The new panel will inherit tne traditions and
the controversies of its two predecessors, the
Senate internal security subcommittee and the
House Un-American Activities Committee,
both of which were abolished in the mid-19705.
"It's going to be a very responsibly run oper
ation." a Thurmond aide said "We're going to
get high-caliber people, not witch hunters. It's
a question of not going overboard The subcom
mittee will use its jurisdiction in a judicious
fashion."
The three Republicans who will serve on the
subcommittee arfc among the most con
servative members of the new Senate: Sen.
Jeremiah Denton of Alabama, who will be the
chairman, and Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, and
John East of North Carolina. The Democratic
members will be Sens. Joseph Biden of Dela
ware, and Patrick Leahy of Vermont.
The group includes several retired military
officials, political figures such as former Sen.
George Murphy, (R-Calif.), and individuals
who had worked for the old Senate internal se
curity subcommittee.
Suspect activities
But the mere formation of a new internal se
curity panel makes some people nervous. Sur
prisingly, the loudest complaints so far have
come from the middle of the political spec

trum.
For years, these earlier internal security in
vestigators were accused by their critics of en
gaging in witch hunts against political groups,
educators, artists, scholars and others whose
activities were deemed suspect.
It was the House committee, for example,
that in 1947 carried out the historic investiga
tion of alleged Communist influence in Holly
wood, subpoenaing writers, directors and ac
tors to testify about their political affiliations,
thoughts and activities.
An aide to one moderate Republican senator
called the new subcommittee "a fossil that has
been brought back to life. There's no need for
this at a time when the country is at peace.
This is just the wrong kind of thing for the Re
publicans to be pushing. "
One fear of the new panel's critics is that it
might be the first manifestation of a return to
the atmosphere of the early 1950s — the period
when the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy, (R-Wis.),
then chairman of the Senate's permanent sub
committee on investigations, stumped the
country making often-unproven charges about
Communist influence in the United States.
During the early 19705, the FBl's domestic
security division usually had several hundred
persons or groups under investigation at any
given time. Now, according to an FBI spokes
man. the bureau has only 44 domestic security
investigations under way, eight involving or
ganizations and 36 involving individuals.
(These 44 cases are being conducted al
though there is no allegation that any law is
being broken, the FBI spokesman said. Some
other politically active groups and individuals
also are being investigated by the FBI for pos
sible criminal activity.)
American Civil Liberties Union officials
said they do not want to pass judgment on the
new subcommittee too quickly. But, ACLU
lawyer Jerry Berman said, "we would become
quite concerned if the committee became in
volved in investigations of political dissent."

An aide to one moderate Republican senator
called the new subcommittee "a fossil that has
been brought back to life. There's no need for
this at a time when the country is at peace.
This is just the wrong kind of thing for the Re
publicans to be pushing. "
One fear of the new panel's critics is that it
might be the first manifestation of a return to
the atmosphere of the early 1950s — the period
when the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy, (R-Wis.),
then chairman of the Senate's permanent sub
committee on investigations, stumped the
country making often-unproven charges about
Communist influence in the United States.
During the early 19705, the FBl's domestic
security division usually had several hundred
persons or groups under investigation at any
given time. Now, according to an FBI spokes
man. the bureau has only 44 domestic security
investigations under way, eight involving or
ganizations and 36 involving individuals.
(These 44 cases are being conducted al
though there is no allegation that any law is
being broken, the FBI spokesman said. Some
other politically active groups and individuals
also are being investigated by the FBI for pos
sible criminal activity.)
American Civil Liberties Union officials
said they do not want to pass judgment on the
new subcommittee too quickly. But, ACLU
lawyer Jerry Berman said, "we would become
quite concerned if the committee became in
volved in investigations of political dissent."
