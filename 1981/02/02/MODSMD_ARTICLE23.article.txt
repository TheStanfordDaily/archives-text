# Haitians criticize deportation hearings

Miami (AP) — A Haitian community
leader says the resumption of exclusion
hearings for Haitian refugees will be "the
beginning of our troubles all over again."
The Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, director of
the Haitian Refugee Center Inc., and other
leaders reacted angrily to the news Friday
that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service had begun scheduling exclusion
hearings for some 4000 Haitians caught
trying to enter the country since Oct. 10.
"No other ethnic groups are going to be
taken to court," Jean-Juste said. "This is
the beginning of our troubles all over again.
We do hope the hearings, if they have to take
place, will be fair and will allow the Hai
tians to obtain asylum in this country."
The hearings are the first step in deporta

tion proceedings. An illegal alien who is
caught when entering the country is subject
to exclusionary proceedings; an alien who
surfaces in the community later can be de
ported.
INS officials denied that their directive
resulted from pressure or politics, although
Florida lawmakers have been applying
mounting pressure to stem the flow of al
iens.
"If in fact the government intends only to
prosecute Haitian refugees, it is blatantly
discriminatory and a continuation of the dis
criminatory policies against blacks that
have existed for the past 10 years," said Ira
Kurzban, attorney for the National Emer
gency Civil Liberties Committee and the
Haitian Refugee Center.
There are some 27,000 Haitians in the Mi

ami area. Those who arrived here before
Oct. 10 are exempt from the hearings be
cause the State Department created a new
immigration class for them and new Cuban
refugees during the Cuban boatlift last year.
Their final status has not yet been de
termined.
Officials say 12,174 Haitians have arrived
in South Florida since last April.
The 4000 are the first Haitians to face ex
clusionary proceedings since 1974, when
U.S. District Judge James King banned
such hearings pending the outcome of a civ
il-rights lawsuit filed by a refugee group.
After the federal government won an ap
peal, King issued a final ruling in the case
two weeks ago, lifting the order and allow
ing INS to resume the hearings.
