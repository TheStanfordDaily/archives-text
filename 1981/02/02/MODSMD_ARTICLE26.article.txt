# Come one, come all

The Inside News Department and
News Department are looking for a few
good writers to take the story assign
ments we have. They (the story ideas,
not the reporters) are coming out of our
ears.

Please â€” stop by the Daily office some
time this week and meet Kim, Karen,
Carl, Vic, Julie or Joan, and pick up an
assignment you might like. Newcomers
as well as oldcomers returning to the
Dailv are welcome.
