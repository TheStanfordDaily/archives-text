## Rain can't dampen Crosby 
### Sally Jenkins 
The Bing Crosby Pro-Am is virtually nonex
istent this year. It should be renamed The
Phantom Tournament.
After two days of constant rain the three
courses where the tournament is played were
washed out. Only a handful of golfers and mov
ie stars could be seen milling around the put
ting green at the Pebble Beach Lodge, usually
a showcase for such things. The tournament
play had dwindled to only three rounds of golf
instead of four.
Not that there was a lack of interesting
things to watch. The scenery surrounding the
Pebble Beach, Cyprus Point, and Spyglass golf
courses is breathtaking. There is a big natural
sculpture immediately off the Pebble Beach
coastline called Bird and Seal Rock that is a se
rious crowd gatherer.
Carmel is an interesting little town right up
the street from the courses, that looks like it is
made out of gingerbread and icing. Many of
those who came to town for the tournament,
only to have it rained out, toured Carmel in
stead, shopping in the deceptively cute looking
stores with not so cute pricetags. Much more
interesting than the coastline or Carmel, how
ever, were the stars who had nothing better to
do than stand around posing.
One didn't have to look far to spot an enter
tainer, athlete or movie star.The rain drove
them inside, but not to their hotels for room
service by the fire. The Tap Room or the Club
XIX at the Pebble Beach Lodge seemed to be
favorite hangouts. Standing at the bar in either
of those establishments one was apt to see Jack
Lemmon trying to have a quiet cocktail with
his wife, while besieged by fans. Or CBS sports
announcers Jack Whitaker and Ben Wright
looking for something to do after a telecast was
cancelled by rain.
Among the more prominent competitors this
year are President Gerald Ford, tennis player
Arthur Ashe, Glen Campbell, Charley Pride,
and Clint Eastwood. Gerald Ford naturally
selected Jack Nicklaus as his partner.

Adoring fans swarmed all over every place,
and everyone. One fan in particular went to ex
treme to show her affection for her favorite
star. She hired a plane to fly over the Cyprus
Point course where she knew Eastwood was
playing Friday morning. The plane trailed a
huge sign that read, CLINT â€” ANY WHICH
WAY YOU WANT IT - CATHY.
There were adoring fans, and then there
mere gawkers. One awe stricken couple wan
dered over to the first tee at Pebble Beach to
catch a glimpse of Eastwood as he started his
second round of the tournament.
"That is the grayest looking man I've ever
seen," said the woman.
"What do you mean?" her companion asked.
"Just look at him!" she answered. "Gray
hair, gray clothes, gray face. . . ."
Country singer Tanya Tucker was a pleasant
surprise addition to the tournament. She flew
down to casually drop in on the stag clambake
given every year on Wensday night, at which
Glen Cambell was performing, and to follow
him around on his golf rounds. When the two
weren't dancing cheek to cheek, they were
singing duets from each other's albums in the
Club XIX, without any music.
A non-celebrity hangout turned out to be
Eastwood's own restaurant in Carmel, called
the Hogs Breath Inn. The adoring fans seemed
to collect there after the days golf, looking for
Clint and a seat by the fire in the outdoor
courtyard, neither of which were to be found.
What could have been a comfortable hideout
for the celebrities became a pit full of scream
ing drunks within two days. Tanya Tucker out
witted them all by slipping in for lunch early
Saturday afternoon.
After two false starts and a lot of fun, the
tournament began in earnest Saturday morn
ing. Stanford alum Tom Watson, and Brad
Bryant are tied for the lead after 36 holes with
scores of 136. The third and final round will be
played this afternoon on all three courses, but
unfortunately will not be televised because
there is no way to know which particular
course the winner will be playing on.
