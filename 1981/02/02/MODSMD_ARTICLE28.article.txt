The Stanford Cardinals wom
en's basketball team solidly de
feated the Fresno State Battlin'
Bulldogs 79-65 at Maples
Pavilion Friday night. The win
broke the Cards three game los
ing streak, and proved they
could play together as a team.
"After the loss against Santa
Clara last Wednesday, I got to
gether with the five starters and
asked them what they thought
was going wrong," coach Dotty
McCrea said before the game.
"We decided we were not com
municating on the court, and
that's why we were throwing the
ball away so much." The Cards
communicated very well Friday
night, and it paid off.
"We've finally turned it
around," McCrea said, "and
we're going to try and keep it up.
We're playing as a team again."
Fresno's high scorer was
Chris Tom with 30 points. Stan
ford's Louise Smith had 21
points, Kim Kupferer had 15
points, and Anne Miller added
11. Smith also led Stanford in re
bounds.
McCrea, in an interview last
week, stressed the importance
of strengthening Miller's per
formance close to the basket.
She was called on to help out

near the basket because Meg
Metzger was in foul trouble Fri
day, and she did very well, espe
cially on fast breaks.
The game was stopped all too
often by the whistle of the refer
ees, who "took the flow out of
the game from the start" ac
cording to McCrea. Every time
two players touched the ball,
one of the referees would call it
a jump ball. The least bit of con
tact provoked a foul call. "We
hit our free throws, and that
made a big difference," McCrea
said.

The win raised the morale of
the team, which had been hav
ing troubles ever since the con
ference schedule started.
"We're playing as a team
again," McCrea said, "and
we're finally playing as well in
the game as we have been in
practice."
The win brings the Cards back
to the .500 mark overall (11-11),
and increases their NorCal Con
ference record to 2-4. The Cards
face the University of the Pacif
ic Wednesday night at Maples
Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.
