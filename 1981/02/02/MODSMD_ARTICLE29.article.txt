# Card nine sweeps three in opening weekend

It is estimated by many baseball experts that
pitching comprises about 80 percent of the game.
Even the best hitting teams (save the Yankees of
the Ruthian era) need a few dependable hurlers to
be successful. Such was all too true last year for
the Stanford baseball team; a group overloaded
with offensive talent, but marred with in
consistencies where it really counted — on the
mound.
Judging however, from the Cards' season open
ing 20-4, 4-1 doubleheader sweep of the Cal Davis
Aggies on Saturday, coupled with their 5-0 shutout
win at Santa Clara Sunday, it is tempting to ven
ture that the Stanford wrecking crew which
scored 5.9 runs per game last year will be sup
ported by a solid mound corps in 1981.
"Our team is a lot better than it was last year,"
commented pitching coach Tom Dunton after
Saturday's twinbill, "and the pitching staff is
more experienced.'' His optimism was qualified,
however. "Of course you have got to be pleased
when you hold a team to one run in sixteen innings,
but then, Davis is not a team of Pac-10 caliber."
Head coach Mark Marquess echoed Dunton. "We
played good defense today and the pitchers were
throwing strikes, but it is too early to tell exactly
how good we will be."
It is nevertheless hard to overlook Saturday's
performances of pitchers Paul Grame, Lee Cline,
Brian Myers, and Gregg Lomnicky. Grame, a sen
ior who was hampered last season with an arm in
jury, appeared to be in mid-season form, holding
Davis to no runs on three hits in five innings in the
first game.
"I began wondering if my arm would ever come
back to full strength," said Grame, who de
veloped acute tendonitis last year spawned by a
microscopic muscle tear. "It just got worse and
worse as the year went on, so last summer I didn't
do any throwing—l just sat around and drank
beer. The rest really helped me and I definitely
feel stronger now."
Myers, a promising freshman from Lakewood
was also impressive in relief of Grame, retiring
sue of the seven men he faced.
While Grame and Myers were shutting out the

Aggies in the first game, baseballs were shooting
off the bats of the Card hitters. Led by Mike Dot
terer (3 hits, 3 RBl's, 4 runs), John Elway (nome
run, 3 RBl's 3 walks) and VinceSakowski (2 hits, 3
RBl's), Stanford amassed twenty runs on sixteen
hits before it was decided to stop the game after
seven innings.
The Stanford batters had a considerably more
difficult time reaching Davis pitcher Paul
Petrovich in the nightcap Saturday. Petrovich. a
small, cunning curveballer had the Cards hitting
the ball into the ground for most of the game, ren
dering only two runs on three hits before giving
way to Scott Herr in the eighth. The problem for
Davis was that Stanford pitchers Cline and Lom
nicky were more than equal to the task. Cline, a
stocky senior, used a mixture of low fastballs,
sliders and tight curves to hold Davis to one run on
only two hits in six innings. Lomnicky, another
fine freshman recruit, had an impressive col
legiate debut, allowing no hits or runs in three in
nings of relief.
Offensively, the Cards were led by shortstop
Dave Meier who had three of Stanford's five hits
including a two-run double in the eighth. Second
baseman Bob DeCosta, who this year will try to
fill the shoes of All-District Paul Zuvella, who was
lost to graduation after last year,sparkled de
fensively with seven assists and one put-out.
Stanford proved it could play with the big boys
on the block on Sunday, coming home with a vic
tory over a fine Santa Clara team. Brian Mignano
was on the hill for the first six innings, and Steve
Cottrell came on in relief, pitching the final three
frames to complete the shutout.
Elway and Dotterer again had big games at the
plate for the Cards, as did Mike Aldrete and Mike
Toothman, who launched a solo home run.
Marquess was obviously happy with the week
end results. "We played very well, and we hit the
ball extremely well. I was very pleased with our
performances. Santa Clara is a very good team, so
it was a pretty impressive win for us."
"We only gave up one run in 25 innings and we
scored 29 runs in three games." the head coach
mused. 'And that's not too bad."
The Cards' next game will be at Hayward State
on Wednesday at 2:30 p.m.
