# Soviets issue sharp attack, say U.S. 'center of terrorism
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Moscow — The Soviet Union, clearly stung by charges
that it aids and encourages international terrorist groups,
lashed back at the United States yesterday, charging that
Washington is "the main center for the organization of ter
ror," and accusing the United States of complicity in the
1978 kidnapping and murder of former Italian Prime Min
ister Aldo Moro
Those and numerous other allegations were contained in
a statement released yesterday by the official news agen
cy Tass. The statement was unusual both for its length —
more than 1,000 words — and for the fact that it neither
quoted Soviet officials nor carried the name of a particular
commentator.
Although clearly aimed as a response to Secretary of
State Alexander Haig's remark last week that the Soviet
Union "by conscious policies" promotes international ter
rorism, the Tass statement made no reference to Haig
Nor did it mention the Reagan administration by name at
tacking instead "Western especially American propagan
da that is directed by the U.S administration.' Thus reap
peared intended as a sharp, official but measured re
sponse, one meant not to foreclose the possibility of less
thorny relations with President Ronald Reagan
"Terrorism as a means of attaining political aims is
deeply alien to the Soviet Union " the Tass statement said.
It suggested that allegations that Moscow aids and abets
terrorist groups were meant to inflame Western fears
about a "mythical Soviet threat."
On the contrary, Tass said, the Central Intelligence
Agency is the "main center for the organization of terror,
subversion and provocations, plots, the assassination of
prominent political and public figures, and the sending of
terrorist bands into various states."
Citing a November 1975 Senate investigation, and a book
by former CIA agent Philip Agee, Tass said the CIA had
conspired to kill Cuban Premier Fidel Castro and Congo
leader Patrice Lumumba in 1961, installed the late Shah of
Iran in power in 1953, helped overthrow Ghana's President
Kwame Nkrumah in 1966, and Chile's Marxist President
Salvador Allende in 1973.
Tass also said the United States is cooperating with
South Africa to train and finance guerilla forces striving to
overthrow the "lawful government in Angola." and that
the United States and China are training and equipping
"criminal bands" of Afghan insurgents. Not surprisingly,
Tass made no mention of Soviet and Cuban help in install
ing the present Angolan regime or of the death of
Hafizullah Amin, the Afghan leader who perished under

mysterious circumstances shortly after Soviet troops ar
rived in December 1979.
"Is not the training of such bands a most direct and un
disguised encouragement of counter-revolutionary terror
with the aim of frustrating at all costs the building o; new
life in Afghanistan 0 " Tass asked rhetorically.
Within the United States, terrorism as a means of at
taining political goals has a daily practice," Tass
went on. "The ruling circles of the United States are maK
mg wide use of it not only for the physical elimination of
undesirable politicians but also for the suppression of di.
sidents."
As examples. Tass cited the assassinations of John and
Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther Kir.g.
In Italy, Tass said, the CIA "directed the hand of the
murderers" of Aldo Moro so as to eliminate that political
leader who became undesirable to Washington " Why
Moro was ostensibly undesirable to Washington was left
unexplained
Meanwhile in Washington yesterday. White House chief
o! staff James Baker 111 said the message for the Soviet
Union from the week of Reagan administration rhetorical
attacks on Moscow is that "it i= not going to be business as
usual,"
Baker said the Reagan administraton intends to judge
the Soviet Union by its deeds. Measures like depriving So
viet ambassador Anatoliy Dobrvnin of his special privi
lege to enter the State Department through a private ga
rage entrance indicate that Moscow "won't have pre
ferred status" unless its actions justify it.
Reagan is a president who "is going to be realistic about
the Soviet Union and not naive." Baker said in an apparent
criticism of earlier administrations.
Reagan "might have trouble trusting" the Soviets in
view of their past deeds, including the invasion of Afghan
istan. Baker said
He was interviewed on ' Face the Nation" (CBS) after
Reagan and Haig both were critical of the Soviets at news
conferences last week.
Reagan said the Soviets proclaimed their intenton to lie
and cheat to achieve their goal of world revolution, and
Haig accused them of supporting international terrorism
Baker was asked whether Reagan would adopt the Is
raeli model and refuse to negotiate with terrorists who
seize Americans in the future
"I think the president has said that you don't negotiate
with terrorists." Baker answered. He also repeated Rea
gan's pledge that U.S. retribution would be swift and sure,
should Americans be taken prisoner in the future

Reagan and Haig both were critical of the Soviets at news
conferences last week.
Reagan said the Soviets proclaimed their intenton to lie
and cheat to achieve their goal of world revolution, and
Haig accused them of supporting international terrorism
Baker was asked whether Reagan would adopt the Is
raeli model and refuse to negotiate with terrorists who
seize Americans in the future
"I think the president has said that you don't negotiate
with terrorists." Baker answered. He also repeated Rea
gan's pledge that U.S. retribution would be swift and sure,
should Americans be taken prisoner in the future
Moscow — The Soviet Union, clearly stung by charges
that it aids and encourages international terrorist groups,
lashed back at the United States yesterday, charging that
Washington is "the main center for the organization of ter
ror," and accusing the United States of complicity in the
1978 kidnapping and murder of former Italian Prime Min
ister Aldo Moro
Those and numerous other allegations were contained in
a statement released yesterday by the official news agen
cy Tass. The statement was unusual both for its length —
more than 1,000 words — and for the fact that it neither
quoted Soviet officials nor carried the name of a particular
commentator.
Although clearly aimed as a response to Secretary of
State Alexander Haig's remark last week that the Soviet
Union "by conscious policies" promotes international ter
rorism, the Tass statement made no reference to Haig
Nor did it mention the Reagan administration by name at
tacking instead "Western especially American propagan
da that is directed by the U.S administration.' Thus reap
peared intended as a sharp, official but measured re
sponse, one meant not to foreclose the possibility of less
thorny relations with President Ronald Reagan
"Terrorism as a means of attaining political aims is
deeply alien to the Soviet Union " the Tass statement said.
It suggested that allegations that Moscow aids and abets
terrorist groups were meant to inflame Western fears
about a "mythical Soviet threat."
On the contrary, Tass said, the Central Intelligence
Agency is the "main center for the organization of terror,
subversion and provocations, plots, the assassination of
prominent political and public figures, and the sending of
terrorist bands into various states."
Citing a November 1975 Senate investigation, and a book
by former CIA agent Philip Agee, Tass said the CIA had
conspired to kill Cuban Premier Fidel Castro and Congo
leader Patrice Lumumba in 1961, installed the late Shah of
Iran in power in 1953, helped overthrow Ghana's President
Kwame Nkrumah in 1966, and Chile's Marxist President
Salvador Allende in 1973.
Tass also said the United States is cooperating with
South Africa to train and finance guerilla forces striving to
overthrow the "lawful government in Angola." and that
the United States and China are training and equipping
"criminal bands" of Afghan insurgents. Not surprisingly,
Tass made no mention of Soviet and Cuban help in install
ing the present Angolan regime or of the death of
Hafizullah Amin, the Afghan leader who perished under

mysterious circumstances shortly after Soviet troops ar
rived in December 1979.
"Is not the training of such bands a most direct and un
disguised encouragement of counter-revolutionary terror
with the aim of frustrating at all costs the building o; new
life in Afghanistan 0 " Tass asked rhetorically.
Within the United States, terrorism as a means of at
taining political goals has a daily practice," Tass
went on. "The ruling circles of the United States are maK
mg wide use of it not only for the physical elimination of
undesirable politicians but also for the suppression of di.
sidents."
As examples. Tass cited the assassinations of John and
Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther Kir.g.
In Italy, Tass said, the CIA "directed the hand of the
murderers" of Aldo Moro so as to eliminate that political
leader who became undesirable to Washington " Why
Moro was ostensibly undesirable to Washington was left
unexplained
Meanwhile in Washington yesterday. White House chief
o! staff James Baker 111 said the message for the Soviet
Union from the week of Reagan administration rhetorical
attacks on Moscow is that "it i= not going to be business as
usual,"
Baker said the Reagan administraton intends to judge
the Soviet Union by its deeds. Measures like depriving So
viet ambassador Anatoliy Dobrvnin of his special privi
lege to enter the State Department through a private ga
rage entrance indicate that Moscow "won't have pre
ferred status" unless its actions justify it.
Reagan is a president who "is going to be realistic about
the Soviet Union and not naive." Baker said in an apparent
criticism of earlier administrations.
Reagan "might have trouble trusting" the Soviets in
view of their past deeds, including the invasion of Afghan
