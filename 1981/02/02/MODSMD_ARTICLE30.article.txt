## 
### 
Honolulu (AP) — Sam
Rutigliano is afraid he might
not be invited back to the Pro
Bowl.
"We just weren't very artis
tic,"the Cleveland coach said
following his American Foot
ball Conference team's 21-7 loss
to the National Football Con
ference Sunday.
"I just hope I'm not the first
Pro Bowl coach to be fired," he
added with a big grin.
The AFC's offense featured
Cleveland's Brian Sipe and San
Diego's Dan Fouts at quarter

back, Houston's Earl Campbell
among the running backs, and
John Jefferson and Stanley
Morgan among the receivers.
But despite the high-powered
personnel, the AFC was able to
come up with just one score.
"We had some poor throws
and some dropped passes that
hurt us," said Rutigliano. "We
had all the opportunities we
needed."
The game's most spectac
tular play was a 55-yard scoring
bomb from Atlanta quarterback
Steve Bartkowski to Falcon re

ceiver Alfred Jenkins. The
fourth-quarter touchdown
pulled the NFC away from a 9-7
lead.

"The touchdown play was
calld as an option screen, but I
gave Steve 'our' signal when I
saw the cornerback come up,"
said Jenkins "This is a great
way to end a year."
Tampa Bay linebacker Lee
Roy Selmon, who spearheaded

an outstanding performance by
the NFC defense, said: "Our
secondary did a great job and
gave the defensive line time to
get to the quarterback."
