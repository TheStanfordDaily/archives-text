# Welch benched against ASU
## Cards shot down by Arizonas 
### Steve Odell 
The Stanford men's basket
ball team went up against a cou
ple of forwards who put on a
shooting clinic Friday night and
Brian Welch, the team's leading
rebounder and scorer, found out
that the best surprise is no sur
prise the next evening when the
Cards dropped a pair of Pac-10
games to Arizona and Arizona
State at Maples Pavilion this
weekend.
Welch, who came into Satur
day night's game averaging 16.6
points a game and 7.2 rebounds,
sat out the final three minutes
plus in the Cards' 91-81 loss to
the Wildcats Friday night, and
then garnished the bench for the
entire forty minutes the next
night, in Stanford's 84-66 defeat
at the hands of the number five
ranked Sun Devils. "We have a
team discipline problem,"
stated Stanford head coach Dick

Dißiaso after Saturday night's
loss. "We don't want to air all
our dirty laundry to the press, so
we'll just call it discipline and
leave it at that. I don't want to
elaborate.'
Welch, who was coming off of
a team-high 24 point per
formance on Friday night, knew
nothing prior to the ASU game.
"I don't know why I didn't play.
I don't even know what I did."
Dißiaso confirmed that he
had not told his star forward of
his decision and indicated that
he had thought about his actions
long and hard before coming to
any conclusions. "I slept on it
last night and (thought about it)
today," the Stanford mentor
said. "He'll find out in time. I
want to sit and think on it for
awhile."
When asked if the disciplinary
action would carry over into
next week's games, he said.

"Well, that all depends. We've
got a whole week of practice be
tween now and then. "
A source close to the team
said that Welch was benched for
not playing defense and for not
going to the boards on the pre
vious evening.
In getting down to the actual
basketball played instead of not
played this weekend, Friday
night's game could be summed
up in two words: Dosty and
Davis. The two starting senior
forwards proved to be the
hottest duo since Rodgers and
Astaire hung up the slippers as
they combined for 64 points on
torrid 26-38 shooting from the
field. In fact, nobody else on the
Wildcats needed to even bother
show up for the game as Dosty
and Davis were the only Arizona
players to score in the second
half until Frank Smith took a
pass from teammate John
Smith and layed it in with 3:34
remaining.
"It all boiled down to that
great shooting performance,"
lamented Stanford head coach
Dick Dißiaso after Friday
night's contest. "They were fan
tastic. We took everybody we
had and threw them at them, but
they still went up and they still
went in. I don't know if two guys
from Golden State could have
stopped them tonight."
But while Dosty and Davis
stole the show, the Cardinals
were not without their own
bright spots. Sporting an altered
starting line-up with freshman
Hans Wichary starting for Jeff
Ryan and Peter Lallas taking
the court at tip-off in re
placement of Doug Marty, the
Cards raced out to a 20-18 lead
with 11:23 remaining in the first
half behind a running offense
and the shooting of Welch, who
had half of the Cards' markers
up to that point and ended up
with 18 for the half. "I wanted us
to run," admitted Dißiaso, "to
get us going a bit. We hadn't run
in the last two or three games."
It was over five minutes, how
ever, before Stanford could put
their next point on the board, as
they became sloppy on the fast
break and saw their two-point
advantage turn into a 28-20 Wild
cat lead. The Cards played pret
ty much even with the Cats for
the rest of the half and went into
the locker room down by nine,
41-32.
Arizona increased its .lead to
17 points (72-55) with 6:52" left,
but Stanford dug in and made a
run at Arizona, which broke a
four-game losing streak with

the win over Stanford Down by
14 with just over three minutes
to play, the Cards put together
nine straight points to shave the
lead to five, but that was as
close as they could come as the
Wildcats put down 11 of their
final 13 foul shots to repel the
comeback bid.
Saturday night's game fol
lowed much the same pattern as
the previous evening s contest,
with Stanford playing well at
the outset, and leading by a
score of 12-8 with just over elev
en minutes to go in the half But
then Arizona State showed the
Maples Pavillion crowd of 3435
why they are the number five
team in the nation, as they rat
tled off five field goals in a row
(three lay-ins and two slam
dunks) and went up by six. ASU
was aided by 14 first half turn
overs by the Cards, and led at
the intermission by eight, 34-26
The second period saw the Sun
Devils use their superior overall
team speed and height to beat
Stanford on the defensive
boards and burn the Cards on
the fast break, scorching out to
a 23-point advantage at the 9:25
mark, culminated by a five-on
one break which ended with a
Byron Scott lay-in, and which
was indicative of the game as a
whole.
The Cards again made a
furious rally and got as close as
14 but ASU won going away,
84-66. "Their number five rank
ing is well-earned," Dißiaso re
flected after the game. " They
really play the game above the
iron. We executed our first half
game plan fairly well, but we
just made too many mistakes."
The Sun Devils were led by
their fleet backcourt of Byron
Scott and Lafayette "Fat"
Lever, who pumped in 19 and 17
points respectively for Ned
Wulk's club. Paul Williams also
had 14 tallies for ASU and John
ny Nash put in 10 to give the
Devils' balanced attack four
men in double figures. Alton
Lister, the All-America center,
who was hampered by a
sprained right knee and had
missed two games last week
end. was less than his usual
dominant self, picking up only
four points in 25 minutes of ac
tion. Lister, however, did pro
vide an intimidating force in the
middle for ASU. and kept the
Cards out of the middle for most
of the evening, forcing them into
longer range shots.
Stanford has now lost four
straight games and stands at 2-7
in the Pac-10 and 6-12 overall.
