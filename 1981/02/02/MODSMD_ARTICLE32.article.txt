# Gymnasts defeat Davis but miss 260-point goal
## 
### Dean Eyre 
To sports fans who believe
that "winning isn't everything,
it's the only thing," a coach who
looks past a victory at his
team's rate of improvement is
incomprehensible. Sadao
Hamada will not be a Vince
Lombardi, which may disap
point some casual observers.
Yet in the sport of gymnastics
where the athlete is competing
more against his or her abilities
and gym equipment than other
individuals or teams, the sub
jective approach applies most
successfully.
Stanford ran away from UC-
Davis in Saturday night's dual
meet by a 251.80 to 217.45
margin. While the victory raises
the squad's record to 2-0. what
concerns Hamada the most is
that the team score is below the
253.10 mark recorded in the sea
son opener against San Jose
State three weeks ago and well
short of the meet's goal of 260
points.
Part of the problem stemmed
from the fact that "the meet
dragged on and the guys were
not given warm-ups (for the in
dividual events, once competi
tion began)," said Hamada.
Among the individual events
and performances, however,
there were some bright notes.
The team score of 40.05 on pom
mel horse improved upon the

37.65 total tallied against the
Spartans. Hamada said that he
"saw a lot of improvement" on
the rings, registering a 43.25
team sum, up from the 42.70
points of the January 9 meet He
also cited two performances on
pommel horse. Brian Nelson's
7.45 and Bela Matyas, who
"struggled, but stayed with it"
to earn a 7.75 score.
Mike Lee won the all-around
competition with a 53.10 total,
followed by Nelson with 49.80,
Jim Campanelli at 49.55 and
Kirk Druey with 47.15. Other top
Card showings included Bob
Daniel's ring routine, judged an
8.95 effort for second place and
his 9.50 vault, best in that event.
Lee won the high bar competi
tion with a 9.20 score.
Stanford opens its conference
competition against Oregon this
Friday, and the major goal in
that meet will be to raise scores
by eliminating mistakes "I
counted 38 major mistakes out
of 36 routines in the Davis
meet," said Hamada A major
mistake is a 3-plus deduction.
We've got to spend more time to
get more consistency. A good
gymnast knows how to hit a rou
tine anywhere, no matter what
time he performs, if the meet
goes long. That's what we'll
shoot for, to reduce the number
of mistakes.
