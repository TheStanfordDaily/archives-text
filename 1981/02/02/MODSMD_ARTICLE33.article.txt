Trade union strike called off
Warsaw — Leaders of Poland's independent trade union
Solidarity met yesterday and called off a one-hour, na
tionwide general strike planned for next Tuesday follow
ing agreement with the government on greater access to
the news media and a shorter working week.
But a Solidarity spokesman made clear that the union
might still go ahead with a general strike later in the
month unless the communist authorities recognize the
right of Poland's 3 million private farmers to form their
own independent unions.
Meanwhile a regional strike continued into its fifth day
in the southern industrial province of Bielsko Biala.
The Solidarity decision, taken at a meeting in Warsaw of
the union's national coordinating committee, appeared to
remove the threat of widespread industrial unrest next
week. But unless the peasants' grievances are solved
quickly, the respite could be brief.
A government delegation met peasants' representatives
yesterday in the southeastern town of Rzeszow to discuss
their demands. The supreme court is due to rule on the is
sue of a "rural Solidarity" within the next 10 days. Solidar
ity leaders have declared a day of "propaganda support
for the peasants" tomorrow in place of the planned strike.
Last night the government fulfilled one of its promises
by allowing the broadcast on radio and television of a com
munique issued by Solidarity's national committee. The
statement, announcing the decision to suspend next Tues
day's strike, was read in full on news bulletins.
Until recently Solidarity meetings were largely ignored
by the state-controlled news media — and this was one of
the major issues raised during negotiations lasting over 12
hours on Friday. Solidarity has also been promised its own
radio and TV programs and a weekly national newspaper,
in addition to regional papers.
A Solidarity spokesman, Janusz Onyskiewicz, described
the mood of yesterday's meeting, attended by delegates
hastily assembled from all over Poland, as one of "relief"
following the settlement of the protracted dispute with the
government over working hours. Under the agreement
workers will have three Saturdays off in every four until
the introduction of a five-day work week next year.
Asked why it took so long to reach a compromise on the
issue that sparked a new crisis in relations between Soli
darity and the authorities, he replied, "The government's
position over free Saturdays was very rigid. It was only by
applying considerable pressure that we were able to ex
tract these concessions from them."
French planes to Iraqis
Paris — France said yesterday that it has delivered the
first four of 60 Mirage jet interceptors for Iraq.
The four planes were spotted Saturday afternoon land
ing at Larnaca Air Base in Cyprus with camouflage paint
and no national insignia, and the French Foreign Ministry
yesterday confirmed that they were the first contingent
bound for Iraq.
Despite officially proclaimed neutrality, the delivery
confirms France's deliberate choice of the Iraqi side in the
Gulf war with Iran. Given the new U.S. administration's
refusal to deliver weapons to Iran that had been in the
pipeline before the hostage-taking, and Secretary of State
Alexander Haig's positive-sounding statements about

Iraq, the French action is not expected to bother the U.S.
government.
An order by Tehran for 12 high-speed patrol boats was
held up by Paris because of the embargo applied against
Iran over the hostages. French sources said that there are
financial difficulties that could delay further the delivery
of the ships that would be particularly useful to Iran in the
Gulf war. France lost a total of $11 billion worth of civilian
and military contracts in Iran after the overthrow of the
shah.
Yet French exports to Iran, mostly foodstuffs not cov
ered by the embargo, increased by 80 percent last year, of
ficial French statistics show. French sources say that de
spite the Paris government's clear tilt toward Iraq.
France may now feel forced to release the patrol boats
rapidly to show its neutrality in the conflict. Five of the 12
are reported ready to go, and Iranian crews are under
stood to be in Cherbourg familiarizing themselves with
them.
The French foreign ministry said that France would
neither delay nor accelerate delivery of the Mirages to
Iraq under two contracts dating from mid-1977 and late
1979. But some French aviation industry sources said that
the planes were being produced at an unusually fast pace
and that completion of the order could be expected rapid
ly-
French official sources had said that the contracts
called for delivery to Iraq at the rate of two a month start
ing as early as November. Plane-maker Dassault has the
capacity to produce seven or eight a month of the most ad
vanced French fighter now in production. But a portion
must normally be reserved for the French air force.
French official observers have expressed puzzlement
that Iraq has not really yet used its modern aviation and
other advanced weapons in the Gulf war. Iran has used its
U.S.-supplied Phantom Fl5 jets with such murderous ef
fect in the war that many military observers consider
those planes to have been the major factor that saved Iran
from defeat in the early days of the war.
The Iraqis have large numbers of Soviet-supplied Mig
fighter-bombers. The Iraqi decision to buy significant
numbers of French jets, military helicopters, tanks and
other armored vehicles apparently reflected a desire to di
versify Baghdad's source of arms.
Social Security may be cut
Washington — The Reagan administration is all but cer
tain to propose wiping out Social Security's minimum
monthly benefits and student benefits as part of its slashes
in spending, according to congressional sources.
The cuts, which must be approved by Congress, may not
be the only Social Security trims. Others are also being
considered, but without a final decision so far.
The request for cuts in minimum and student benefits,
which could affect 2.7 million persons and save as much as
$3.8 billion a year if put into effect all at once, is certain to
set off a tremendous fight.
The Social Security minimum benefit is $122 a month,
except for persons who retired early and therefore took a
reduction in benefits. About 2 million persons receive the
minimum.
The minimum has long been criticized as providing a
loophole for some people who retire under federal, state or
Civil Service programs with a good pension, then also col

lect Social Security on the basis of only a short work record
in jobs paying into Social Security
Under the regular benefit formula, such persons might
receive only $50, $60 or $70 a month, but they enjoy what
amounts to a windfall by being able to collect the $122 min
imum. Critics say the minimum, designed to protect low
income workers and reduce paperwork, has allowed well
paid civil servants with high Civil Service retirement pen
sions to " double dip" against Social Security, helping to
contribute to its financial-deficit problems.
The General Accounting Office, in a Dec. 10,1979, study
said 15 percent of those receiving the Social Security min
imum were also receiving other federal pensions averag
ing about $900 a month.
Hostages' mistreatment verified
Washington — More than half the 66 Americans who
were taken hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran 15
months ago were mistreated either physically or psy
chologically after their capture, according to interviews
with hostages, their families and government officials fa
miliar with their ordeal.
Yet while there is evidence that the young militants who
captured the Americans systematically tried to degrade,
disorient and terrify their captives, most instances of
abuse apparently were random incidents, springing from
the whims of an individual guard or brought on by an act of
defiance or insolence on the part of a hostage.
These findings, coupled with interviews with experts
and senior government officials who have reviewed the
hostages' treatment, show that intimidation through phys
ical brutality, as torture is frequently understood to mean.

was apparently never employed.
Nonetheless, there is some feeling in the State Depart
ment that former president Jimmy Carter's emotional ex
pression of outrage over the hostages' treatment after his
meeting with the 52 just-released hostages in West Germa
ny. coupled with initial news reports, created an exag
gerated picture of the mistreatment the Americans re
ceived.
Olympic prospects will train early
Colorado Springs, Colo. — In an unprecedented move in
this country, the U.S. Olympic Committee will seek to
identify leading prospects for the 1984 American Olympic
team and begin training them this year, three years in ad
vance, newly-elected USOC president William Simon said
Saturday.
The 53-year-old former secretary of the Treasury pro
posed a record $71 million four-year budget for the USOC
and said that with inflation the final figure could ul
timatley reach $90 million, almost all of which will have to
be raised privately.
