# What's in a name? The latest game in Facilities and Services Department

Stanford, world famous for its engi
neering and management schools,
can't seem to coordinate an efficient
means of running its own physical
plant. Morale problems plague the
University's Department of Faci ties
and Services due to rapid charts j n
management and overall poor :om
munication.

One aspect of charging man
agement is changing titflv's and posi
tions. Like the changing c'f Faci'it es
and Services' name itse) 1 M'lis prac
tice is so common as to } 'Jve become
almost a joke among employees.
According to Gareth Hansen, a
graphics technician, he was once
drafted to design an "Organizational
chart" (a hierarchical chart of em
ployees) for Facilities and Services.
"I printed up 5000 copies," he said,
"and one week later it was no good
Hansen's division now owns a magnet
ic staff board.

Later, Hansen discovered what a
change in management meant first
hand While stsr the Utilities
division he was informed one day that
he hai been transferred to the Plan
ting division. He continued to work at
the same drafting table doing the
same work — he had merely become
an official employee of Planning.
After one year — during which he
saw his new boss twice — Hansen was
"moved" back to Utilities No ex
planation-was ever given him, and to
this day he is not sure what the point of
the whole transfer was.
Jason Mavis, director of Facilities
and Services, claims that such prac
tices are not unusual. "It is a fairly
normal occurance in any large or
ganization. The titles change to refit < t
organizational changes and thecharv
ing levels of responsibility," he said
John Newcomb, a 20-year employee
with Facilities Services, whose title
was changed from "graphics techni
cian" to "utilities design draftsman
coordinator" after he wrote a letter to
the Daily in which he threatened to
quit, disagreed: "It's all political he
said. "They change the names to pro

tect the guilty."
Underemployment is another com
mon complaint among Facilities and
Services employees In the Operations
and Maintenance division there are
six employees known as Facilities En
gineering Coordinators. Their job is to
contract out work — such as re-roofing
— that cannot be done by University
workmen.
Although four of the six employees
have engineering degrees and are
being paid engineering salaries, their
boss says that they spend only half of
their time in the field. The rest of the
time, he says, they're being used "for
just coordinating the paperwork and
making sure it gets done."
Hansen, who works near the coordi
nators, complained that they spent
almost no time in the field ' All thtv
are is phone-jockeys," he said "It
floors me every time I see them "
Hansen knows what he's talking about
where underemployment is con
cerned. Although a graphics techni
cian and cartologist, he had spent the
da> before he was interviewed read
ing electrical meters.
The third group of complaints stems

from poor communication between
the various divisions of Facilities and
Services.
Again, there are an abundance of in
efficiency-related anecdotes Recent
ly, for instance, the new student hous
ing planned for construction next to
Lake Lagunita was contracted out to
an architectural firm by one division
without consulting another. The re
sult: the overflow from the lake was to
be channeled beside the dorm
"if there'd been a flood,' said one
workman, "you could've just for
gotten that dorm.'' Since the
dormitory's design was in its pre
liminary stages, there was httle
chance of any permanent damage.
In a similar episode, a n w music
'luildine was designed ov> r an under
ground ut'lities line, cutting off access
to it This problem .vas also caught
long before construction began, but
not before some preliminary designs
had been draw r. up "It was a waste of
time," said Hansen, who maps utili
ties. "The problem is, we have no
standard method of disseminating in
formation."
