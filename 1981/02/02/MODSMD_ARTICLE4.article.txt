# What's in a name? The latest game in Facilities and Services Department

Stanford, world famous for its engi
neering and management schools,
can't seem to coordinate an efficient
means of running its own physical
plant. Morale problems plague the
University's Department of Faci ties
and Services due to rapid charts j n
management and overall poor :om
munication.

One aspect of charging man
agement is changing titflv's and posi

almost a joke among employees.
According to Gareth Hansen, a
graphics technician, he was once
drafted to design an "Organizational
chart" (a hierarchical chart of em
ployees) for Facilities and Services.
"I printed up 5000 copies," he said,
"and one week later it was no good
Hansen's division now owns a magnet
ic staff board.

Later, Hansen discovered what a
change in management meant first
hand While stsr the Utilities
division he was informed one day that
he hai been transferred to the Plan
ting division. He continued to work at
the same drafting table doing the
same work — he had merely become
an official employee of Planning.
After one year — during which he
saw his new boss twice — Hansen was
"moved" back to Utilities No ex
planation-was ever given him, and to
this day he is not sure what the point of
the whole transfer was.
Jason Mavis, director of Facilities
and Services, claims that such prac
tices are not unusual. "It is a fairly
normal occurance in any large or
ganization. The titles change to refit < t
organizational changes and thecharv
ing levels of responsibility," he said
John Newcomb, a 20-year employee
with Facilities Services, whose title
was changed from "graphics techni
cian" to "utilities design draftsman
coordinator" after he wrote a letter to
the Daily in which he threatened to
quit, disagreed: "It's all political he
said. "They change the names to pro

tect the guilty."
Underemployment is another com
mon complaint among Facilities and
Services employees In the Operations
and Maintenance division there are
six employees known as Facilities En
gineering Coordinators. Their job is to
contract out work — such as re-roofing
— that cannot be done by University
workmen.
Although four of the six employees
have engineering degrees and are
being paid engineering salaries, their
boss says that they spend only half of
their time in the field. The rest of the
time, he says, they're being used "for
just coordinating the paperwork and
making sure it gets done."
Hansen, who works near the coordi
nators, complained that they spent
almost no time in the field ' All thtv
are is phone-jockeys," he said "It
floors me every time I see them "
Hansen knows what he's talking about
where underemployment is con
cerned. Although a graphics techni
cian and cartologist, he had spent the
da> before he was interviewed read
ing electrical meters.
The third group of complaints stems

from poor communication between
the various divisions of Facilities and
Services.
Again, there are an abundance of in
efficiency-related anecdotes Recent
ly, for instance, the new student hous
ing planned for construction next to
Lake Lagunita was contracted out to
an architectural firm by one division
without consulting another. The re
sult: the overflow from the lake was to
be channeled beside the dorm
"if there'd been a flood,' said one
workman, "you could've just for
gotten that dorm.'' Since the
dormitory's design was in its pre
liminary stages, there was httle
chance of any permanent damage.
In a similar episode, a n w music
'luildine was designed ov> r an under
ground ut'lities line, cutting off access
to it This problem .vas also caught
long before construction began, but
not before some preliminary designs
had been draw r. up "It was a waste of
time," said Hansen, who maps utili
ties. "The problem is, we have no
standard method of disseminating in
formation."
Gary Cavazos, acting director of
Engineering, disagrees. According to
Cavazos, there is a standard method of
communication between divisions
that is "interactive." "It takes four to
five months for the preliminary stages
of a building," he said. "During that
time it's a constant process of interac
tion."
Cavazos does concede that mistakes
like those described above are com
mon. "You just need better coordi
nation between divisions," he said.
Several employees also claim that
there is a problem of communication
between themselves and the upper
levels of management. "The people
making the decisions are too remote
from the people doing the work," said
Newcomb. Hansen agreed: "They
won't take any input from us," he said.
Hansen says he has friends who
work in Silicon Valley who are asked
for ideas and occasionally are even
paid for them. "Here they don't have

to make a profit, so they don't bother
to ask for input," he said. "They can
support the inefficiency, so I don't see
how it's going to change," he added.
Newcomb, who has worked longer
at Facilities and Services than
Hansen, blames the gulf between
management and non-management on
the unionization of non-management
in 1973. "It's no longer the enclosed
family that it used to be," he said. "It
seems like they said 'we'll fix these
guys if they want to go with a union.'
Now it's us versus them."
Cavazos conceded that Facilities
and Services has become increasingly
impersonal, but said that he was un
aware of a real lack of communication
between different levels of employ
ees. Both he and Mavis said that they
were unaware of a morale problem.
"The normal things that go with low
morale — absenteeism and petitions
— are not present," Cavazos said,
He also said that he had not been in

formed of the high number of com
plaints received at the Ombudsman's
office. Mavis did know of the com
plaints, but said that he "had not
heard of anything along those (low
morale) lines."
The 1981-82 budget for Facilities and
Services allots close to $16 million of
Stanford's general funds, according to
sources in the Comptroller's office.
The total expenditures will be much
higher because of direct student
payments to divisions such as Food
and Housing.
Is Facilities and Services as effi
cient as it could be? According to
Mavis, "We will never be as efficient
as we'd like to be. Technology changes
too fast and people change too fast.
But," Mavis added, "we're going to
keep on trying."
As tuition jumps above $7000, just
how hard Facilities and Services is
going to try will undoubtedly become a
more critical issue here.

to it This problem .vas also caught
long before construction began, but
not before some preliminary designs
had been draw r. up "It was a waste of
time," said Hansen, who maps utili
ties. "The problem is, we have no
standard method of disseminating in
formation."
Gary Cavazos, acting director of
Engineering, disagrees. According to
Cavazos, there is a standard method of
communication between divisions
that is "interactive." "It takes four to
five months for the preliminary stages
of a building," he said. "During that
time it's a constant process of interac
tion."
Cavazos does concede that mistakes
like those described above are com
mon. "You just need better coordi
nation between divisions," he said.
Several employees also claim that
there is a problem of communication
between themselves and the upper
levels of management. "The people
making the decisions are too remote
from the people doing the work," said
Newcomb. Hansen agreed: "They
won't take any input from us," he said.
Hansen says he has friends who
work in Silicon Valley who are asked
for ideas and occasionally are even
paid for them. "Here they don't have

to make a profit, so they don't bother
to ask for input," he said. "They can
support the inefficiency, so I don't see
how it's going to change," he added.
Newcomb, who has worked longer
at Facilities and Services than
Hansen, blames the gulf between
management and non-management on
the unionization of non-management
in 1973. "It's no longer the enclosed
family that it used to be," he said. "It
seems like they said 'we'll fix these
guys if they want to go with a union.'
Now it's us versus them."
Cavazos conceded that Facilities
and Services has become increasingly
impersonal, but said that he was un
aware of a real lack of communication
between different levels of employ
ees. Both he and Mavis said that they
were unaware of a morale problem.
"The normal things that go with low
morale — absenteeism and petitions
— are not present," Cavazos said,
He also said that he had not been in

formed of the high number of com
plaints received at the Ombudsman's
office. Mavis did know of the com
plaints, but said that he "had not
heard of anything along those (low
morale) lines."
The 1981-82 budget for Facilities and
Services allots close to $16 million of
Stanford's general funds, according to
sources in the Comptroller's office.
The total expenditures will be much
higher because of direct student
payments to divisions such as Food
and Housing.
Is Facilities and Services as effi
cient as it could be? According to
Mavis, "We will never be as efficient
as we'd like to be. Technology changes
too fast and people change too fast.
But," Mavis added, "we're going to
keep on trying."
As tuition jumps above $7000, just
how hard Facilities and Services is
going to try will undoubtedly become a
more critical issue here.

Underemployment is another com
mon complaint among Facilities and
Services employees In the Operations

six employees known as Facilities En

contract out work — such as re-roofing
— that cannot be done by University
workmen.
Although four of the six employees
have engineering degrees and are
being paid engineering salaries, their
boss says that they spend only half of
their time in the field. The rest of the
time, he says, they're being used "for
