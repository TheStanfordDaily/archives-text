You've just come into tho kitchen after a cold,
rainy walk home from White Plaza You reach
for a warm English muffin but discover the ants
have beaten you to it The ant problem is year
round but complaints hero tend to increase dur
ing the damp winter season
According to entomologist Dennis Murphy, a
graduate student in population bi '■ gy, there are
several reasons for the current r<<sh of com
plaints Although the pests .ire ' id -blooded and
thus generally less active in tho winter, the
warmth of the dormitorie might provide a wel
come alternative to the cold, wet outdoors.
Murphy emphasized that temperature is not
tho only explanation for increased complaints
He said. "A flooded colony may mean they d
move indoors
Also as students spend more time inside during
the winter they could bo more aware of insects
and rodents. Student- iren't in tho dorms in the
summer." said Murph\

Kskimo pie has been th'Tt for more lme. said
Murphy.
"Any available food source is going to be at
tractive." he added
Robert Mibaeh faciliti- ■ manager for the resi
dential halls, said rodent calls also increase at
this time ot vear. Complaints are primarily cen

tered around Roble and Lagurut,
According to Robert White, iperation man
ager for AANTEX Pest Control in Palo Alto, "ro
dents only come in when looking for food, shelter
and water."
Exterminators are presently setting traps un
der Roble This is common because Roble is close
to Lake Lagunita and rodents are attracted to
water. "It's done all the time, said Mibaeh
According to Jerry Park - facilities manager
of Escondido, the roach and roof rat problem is
common in the area He described roof rats as
"about as harmful as a squirrel but much less at
tractive."
To combat the insect problem, the Office of
Residential Education has a contract with Rose
exterminators The Rose man calls in on a daily
basis The exterminator is available for emer
gencies and carries a pager, added Mil bach
The perpetual plague of rodents and insects is
not unique to the University. According to
Murphy, the pest problem is particularly preva
lent in dorms because of their high concentration
of activity. People have a wide variety of
hygiene habits he said Any control is a con
trol of the source "
Exterminating is only a short term solution It
does not eliminate the cause of infestation
Many insects, such as roaches, live best in
doors Roaches are also easily transported Ac
cording to a Rose representative," Roaches adapt

to anything and everything They never stop and
rest They just keep roaming.
He claimed that Rose receives fewer calls re
lated to ants in the winter Referring to their
cold-blooded system, he said. "Their whole sys
tem slows down in the winter He compared this
phenomenon to the hibernation of bears
According to White, most ant calls are re
ceived immediately after the rain stops. When
the sun comes out ants leave their colonies to
look tor new food
"Ants are soil insects. Their homes are being
submerged in water." he said The flooding
forces the ants to look for new shelter And all
types of ants are attracted to food
According to Chris Wooldridge. Phi Delt kitch
en manager, the rains last weekend resulted in an
increase in ants They really like the F'hi Delt
house, he said The ants got in the box of a pre
mixed pancake batter Wooldridge added. "I
guess some people even ate some."
Hygiene is also the solution to the fly problem
According to Murphy, "If you don't want flies,
you don't want open dumpsters of food " Univer
sity garbage pick-up is frequent, however
Murphy said garbage attracts flies for at least
two reasons The food provides quick sucrose
which females need for the production of sex
cells In addition, female flies lay eggs on the
stale garbage.
Klies particularly live out their life cycle on
rotting food." he said
