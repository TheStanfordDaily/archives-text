## S. Africa steps up raids on neighboring countries 
### Los Angeles Times 
Cape Town, South Africa — Normal com
mercial and low-level diplomatic relations con
tinued Saturday between South Africa and
Mozambique despite a pre-dawn raid Friday by
South African commandos against black na
tionalists inside Mozambique.
Such cross-border strikes by South African air
borne troops against suspected "terrorists"
based in neighboring black-ruled countries has be
come almost a standard operation by the govern
ment here. The actions usually bring protests but
little action since the invaded states are so eco
nomically dependent on South Africa.
Mozambique, for example, generates most of
its foreign exchange through the "export" of its
laborers to work in South African mines and by al
lowing South African cargoes to move through the
port of Maputo.
It was in the Maputo suburb of Matola that the
South African raiders struck Friday morning,
shooting up three houses said to be the head
quarters of the African National Congress, the
leading black insurgency group committed to the
overthrow of white minority rule in South Africa.
The only initial reaction by the Mozambique
government was to take accredited diplomats
from both Western and Communist countries to
the scene and show them the destruction and the
bodies of seven persons said to have been killed by
the raiders.
Weapons seized
The South African announcement of the raid
said large quantities of weapons, sabotage equip
ment and documents had been seized. But it gave
no details about how the raid was carried out.
Observers speculated that the raiders moved
by helicopter from a South African takeoff point
about 50 miles away. Then once on the ground,
they sealed off the target area with roadblocks
and struck, since Mozambique has neither a radar
capacity nor a quick-reaction force to detect or
deal with such a force.
It was the first deep penetration into Mozam
bique disclosed by the South Africans. But the
government of President Samora Machel in
Maputo has complained in the past of ground raids
across the border by South African troops looking
for infiltrators and caches of terrorist supplies.

The South African government has openly pro
claimed that it will cross any border in pre-emp
tive strikes or in hot pursuit of suspected black
"terrorists."
Such a warning is obviously intended to make
neighboring black rulers wary about harboring
South African insurgents. Prime Minister Robert
Mugabe of Zimbabwe professes only moral sup
port to the ANC, whose headquarters remain in
Lusaka, Zambia, where Zambian President Ken
neth Kaunda frequently complains about South
African troop incursions, while continuing to
trade with this country.
N'amibian border
The most active area for South African cross
border commando operations is along the frontier
between Namibia (South-West Africa) and
Angola, where South African troops are defending
Namibia against insurgent forces of the South-
West African People's Organization. South
African commanders contend that their para
troop and helicopter-borne attacks into Angola
are aimed only at SWAPO camps. They deny re
ports that the operations have been expanded into
a scorched-earth campaign involving the Angolan
population. However, informed sources say that
raids are being made against villages more than
100 miles inside Angola, where the populace —
voluntarily or through intimidation — supports
the anti-South African fighters.
Another element in the confused fighting in
southern Angola is the presence of an Angolan
armed force known as UNITA. headed by Jonas
Savimbi, an anti-Communist opposed to the
Angolan government. The latter has support from
the Soviets and Cuban armed forces to defend it.
Although a black nationalist. Savimbi's anti-
Communist stance has made it possible for South
Africa to support him. Some of this support ap
parently comes from a unit known as the South
African Defense Force "Buffalo Regiment," pri
marily Portuguese-speaking black Angolans re
cruited from another Angola dissident movement
known as FNLA and which is friendly with
UNITA. The unit's sergeants and officers have
been recruited mainly from the ranks of white
professional military men who left Zimbabwe
(then called Rhodesia) when black rule came into
being there.
