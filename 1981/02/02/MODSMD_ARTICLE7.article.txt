# Post-summit call for 'political solution Moslem nations ponder Afghan question
## 
### Washington Post 
Taif, Saudi Arabia â€” The decision here
last week of 38 Moslem leaders to seek a po
litical settlement of the Afghanistan crisis
is a turning point in their attitude toward the
Soviet-installed Marxist government there.
The decision is couched in terms of a call
for cooperation with the U.N. secretary
general, who is to initiate contacts with the
Kabul regime. It represents a sharp break
with the Islamic Conference's past adamant
stance against the government of Babrak
Karmal.
Although the Islamic Conference summit
declared its "full solidarity" with the jihad,
or holy war, of the Afghan rebels and warm
ly applauded one of its leaders here, there is
a growing sense among Moslem leaders that
the faction-ridden opposition inside Afghan
istan has failed to develop into an effective
force likely to bring down the Babrak gov
ernment.
Ironically, one reason for the Afghan re
bels' failure may have been the absence of
significant aid from the Islamic organiza
tion. Bitterness over this was reflected by a
guerrilla representative, Sheik Mojididi,
who said. "We want something in practical

action, not just resolutions ... we have only
gotten three or four percent of our needs un
til now fin terms of) finances and weap
ons."
Assistance
Only two Moslem countries had really
provided any assistance, he said, naming
Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The latter, he
added, "is the only country very openly and
honestly giving us help."
Probably the most important ally of the
Afghan rebels, neighboring Pakistan, has
signaled its desire to seek a political solu
tion while the Islamic Conference keeps up
"moral political pressure" on the Soviet
Union and the Kabul government as part of
its strategy.
These include, according to the resolution
adopted here, the immediate and total
withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghan
istan, respect for the rights of the Afghan
people to choose their own government and
guarantees for the independence and non
alignment of Afghanistan.
Observers here were struck by the ability
of Saudi Arabia to weld the 37 states and
Palestine Liberation Organization into a
bloc seemingly with a sense of common

purpose.
To be sure, Iran and Libya boycotted the
summit, thus eliminating two potentially
divisive forces.
Peacekeepers
But Saudi Arabia also managed to keep
Syria and Iraq, whose leaders are bitter en
emies, from acrimony at the summit. Jor
dan and Syria likewise kept their dispute
outside the hall. None of those attending de
nounced Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
for his peace treaty with Israel, a re
markable omission at any gathering that in
cludes Arabs,
Saudi Foreign , Minister Prince Saud
made clear that one aim of the new activist
Saudi policy is to employ the force of Islam
ic solidarity to overcome the multiple
divisions of the Arab world.
"The Islamic framework," he com
mented at one of his many press con
ferences during the summit, "will be the
proper framework to impro* e relations
among Arab nations." *
Whether or not Saudi Arabia achieves
this, the 12-year-old Islamic Conference 'im
plicitly is vying with the larger, left-leaning
organization of nonaligned nation^.
