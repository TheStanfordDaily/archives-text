# British MPs look toward new party
## 
### Washington Post 
London — Britain's ideol
ogically torn opposition Labor
Party moved last week to the
brink of a formal split that could
bring about the first significant
realignment of British political
parties in 60 years.
Thirteen present and former
Labor members of Parliament
led by four former Cabinet min
isters took the first step toward
forming a breakaway Social
Democratic Party by this
spring or summer if the Labor
Party's leaders do not reverse
its recent sharp turn to the left.
The splinter group — headed
by Roy Jenkins, former deputy

Labor leader and European Ec
onomic Community president,
former foreign secretary David
Owen, former education secre
tary Shirley Williams and
former transportation secre
tary and opposition defense
spokesman William Rodgers —
last week formed a Council for
Social Democracy as the nucle
us for a new party.
Nine other Labor members of
Parliament immediately joined
the group and another former
Labor deputy leader, Lord
George Brown, said he would
back it with a grass-roots dissi
dent group he heads.
They will now seek public sup
port as a left-of-center alter
native to what they see as a
polarization of British politics
between Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Con
servatives on the right and a
now militantly socialist and
isolationist Labor Party on the
left under the struggling leader
ship of parliamentary orator
Michael Foot.
Oppose policies
The Labor dissidents oppose
both Thatcher's survival-of-the
fittest economic policies, which
have greatly increased un
employment and the gap be
tween rich and poor, and the
greater government control of
the economy, including much
more nationalization of in
dustry, sought by left-wing in
surgents who have seized at
least temporary control of the
Labor Party. Labor's left wing,
led by former energy minister
Tony Benn, also wants to pull
out of the Common Market and
unilaterally ban nuclear weap
ons from Britain.
In a left-wing victory seen as
the final straw by the dissidents,
a special party conference de
cided last Saturday that future
party leaders should be chosen
by an electoral college with 40
percent of the voting power held

by labor unions who finance the
party, 30 percent by mostly left
wing local party activists and 30
percent by the generally more
moderate Labor members of
Parliament, who traditionally
had elected the party leader by
themselves.
In launching the breakaway
Council for Social Democracy
last week, Jenkins, Owen, Wil
liams and Rodgers condemned
what they called "the drift
toward extremism in the Labor
Party" and said, "We believe
that the need for a realignment
of British politics must now be
faced."
They want to pursue policies
more like those of social demo
cratic parties elsewhere in Eu
rope. These include staying in
the Common Market and NATO,
working for multilateral arms
control and maintaining a mix
ed economy with private own
ership of most businesses but
possibly government price and
income controls.
They differ from the Liberal
Party, already struggling to
stay alive in Britain's political
center (with 11 seats in the 635-
seat House of Commons), pri
marily in their espousal of
greater social equality through
more aggressive redistribution
of income and the breaking
down of class barriers in schools
and other institutions.
Election strategy
But the leaders of the new So
cial Democratic movement
here and Liberal leader David
Steel are near agreement on a
cooperative election strategy to
divide the country's parlia
mentary districts, with each
party fielding its strongest can
didates without competition
from the other.
Steel, trying to sell this plan
to both traditional Labor Party
supporters and skeptical Liber
al voters and members of Par
liament who see it as a threat to

their own party, said last week
that it could create "an unstop
pable combination at the next
general election."
"This is the chance to do what
many of us have dreamed of for
years,'' Steel said in a na
tionwide political broadcast,
"to break the mold of a failed
political system and to produce
a realignment of the
progressive and hopeful forces
in Britain."
Recent public opinion polls
have shown growing interest
among at least a third of Brit
ain's voters in a liberal-social
democratic alternative to the
Conservative and Labor parties.
But cautious political analysts
note the strong tradition of par
ty loyalty here and the absence
of a single dominating leader for
the prospective centrist alter
native. A breakaway Social
Democratic Party could, how
ever, siphon sufficient support
from Labor to ensure
Thatcher's Conservatives at
least a decade in government
despite the current unpopulari
ty of her harsh economic poli
cies.
While testing the political wa
ters, the dissidents are still par
ticipating in the Labor Party,
which provoked angry re
sponses from both Foot and
Benn at a meeting of the party
executive Wednesday attended
by Williams and another dissi
dent member of Parliament,
Tom Bradley.
" If they are plotting to form a
new party," Benn was reported
by others there to have shouted,
"they cannot sit here in the
highest councils of the Labor
Party with all the access to par
ty documents available to
them."
"Foot is reliably reported to
have sternly told Williams, "If
you want to join another party,
it is quite intolerable that you
should sit here."
