A Kentucky airlines flight was approaching the
Louisville airport when the co-pilot notes:
That's a short runway!
Undaunted the pilot orders: "Full flßps.
Tension rising in his voice the co-pilot says,
' That's a really short runway."
The pilot commands Minimum airspeed
Panic grips the co-pilot as he warns, "That's
an unbelievably short runway."
The pilot, still calm, prepares the crew,
"Maximum reverse thrust and full brakes as
soon as we touch down,"
The plane touches down — engines roar,
brakes squeal as the plane barely stops
To the stunned co-pilot the pilot admits,
"That was the shortest runway I Ve ever seen
Lookinq side to side he adds, "The widest,
too
As a young doctor was walking down the hall
he noticed that two nurses were staring at him
As he got closer one of the nurses asked,
"Doctor why do you have a thermometer be

"Gosh darn it! Some asshole has got my pen!"
