# DOE drops bilingual education

From the Daily wire services with staff reports
Washington — The Reagan adminis
tration yesterday scrapped a con
troversial set of regulations the new
president has cited as a symbol of fed
eral meddling: rules requiring schools
to teach non-English-speaking stu
dents in their native languages.
Education Secretary Terrel Bell
said he would replace the bilingual re
quirement with new regulations per
mitting local school systems to decide
themselves how best to educate stu
dents who cannot speak or read Eng
lish. He said the federal government
would still insist, though, that any
school receiving federal funds — a cat
egory covering all public and many
private schools — "provide equal
educational opportunity for . . . chil
dren who face language barriers."
Congress already had put a freeze
on the rules, proposed by Bell's prede
cessor, Shirley Hufstedler, last Aug. 5,
and they never went into effect.
Return to state, local control
Here, Professor Michael Kirst of
the School of Education said that al
though the move is "enormously sig
nificant of return to state and local
control of education" it will have little
effect in California because state laws
here"exceed Federal regulations."
Assistant Provost Cecilia Burciaga
called the move "a terrible blow to
civil rights and education."
Burciaga. who serves on the board
of the Chicano Reasearch Center, said
that the decision is a potentially dan
gerous step for the Reagan adminis
tration because minority groups and
parents will revolt. "I would not be
suprised if parents took control of the
schools or boycotted them," she said.
Commitments may be revised
Bell's decision will have substan
tive effect because it will permit some
500 large school systems — which have
about 90 percent of the students af
fected by the rules — to revise com
mitments they have already made to
set up bilingual teaching programs.
The most common alternative to
bilingual teaching of basic courses
will presumably be special training in
English for students who cannot un
derstand English-language teaching
and textbooks. Educators who support
this method say it is cheaper for
school systems and better for students
in the long run because it forces them
to learn the language most Americans
use.
The Education Dept. estimated that
enforcing the rules to teach children
reading, writing and other primary
subjects in two languages could cost
school districts from $180 million to
$591 million a year.
Bell, who was U.S. commissioner of
education when the guidelines were is
sued, said school districts should not
interpret his action to mean that the
Reagan administration will allow
sloppy or loose enforcement of civil
rights Jaw.
"There is no quicker way to kill a
civil rights law than to enforce it with
heavy-handed misdirection and I am
sworn to uphold the law, not to kill it,"
he said.
Not 'invitation to discriminate'
"No school administrator should
misread this action as an invitation to
discriminate against children who
face language barriers," he said.
Hispanic leaders who have ad
vocated compulsory bilingual educa
tion responded angrily to Bell's
message. "My God!" said Rep. Rob
ert Garcia (D-N.Y.) "If this is the
first major educational decision of the
Reagan administration, then this
country is in for absolute disaster."

Ruben Bonilla, president of the
League of United Latin American
Citizens, called the decision "a very
steep price to pay for having given the
Republicans the strongest Hispanic
vote in history." Bonilla was referring
to Hispanic support for Reagan in the
1980 election.
3.5 million children affected
The Education Department said
late last year that there are about 3.5
million children in U.S. elementary
and secondary schools who know too
little English — the bureaucratic term
is " limited-English-proficient chil
dren" — to learn arithmetic, geogra
phy and other basics. About 70 percent
of them are Hispanic. The second
largest group of children speaks Asian
languages — Chinese, Japanese, Ko
rean, Vietnamese and Cambodian.
Most of the school children in this
situation were born in the United
States. To date, refugees and immi
grants have been significant factors in
only a few dozen of the nation's 16,000
public school districts.

The bilingual education con
troversy, which has generated
thousands of pages of legal and regu
latory argument over the past 15 years
or so, stems from two words in the
1964 Civil Rights Act — a provision
banning discrimination on the basis of
"national origin."
In a 1974 case brought in the name of
Kinney Lau, a Chinese American stu
dent in the San Francisco public
schools, the Supreme Court said the
term "national origin" included lan
guage, and thus schools were required
to provide equal educational op
portunity to students who cannot 1 earn
in English. The court specifically de
clined to say which method schools
should use to meet that requirement.
A year later, the federal Office of
Education issued an "informal" docu
ment called "The Lau Remedies"
which pushed school districts toward
the bilingual teaching approach.
Hufstedler's proposed regulation last
year carried on the thrust of that docu
ment.


Emeritus Professor of Anthropology Sinclair Drake was
part of a conference condemning U.S. policy in El
Salvador. Professor Richard Fagan warned of "an unhappy

history of U.S. involvement not only in El Salvador, but
also in Central America, Latin America and the Third
World."
