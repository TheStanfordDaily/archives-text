# Stanford-in-Government goes to Washington
## Students hoping for internships are in luck 
### Amy Worth 
Three Stanford-in-Govern
ment board members will fly
back to Washington D.C., later
this month and lobby for stu
dents applying to summer in
ternships in Congress, federal
agencies and private interest
groups. The purpose of the lob
bying trip is to give students an
added advantage in the com
petition for government in
ternships.
"Since Stanford students
can't go back to Washington for
interviews like students of
eastern schools, our speaking on
behalf of students provides of
fices with a little more credibili
ty and makes Stanford students
stand out," said Aleen Zim
beroff, executive director of
Stanf ord-in-Government.
In order to be represented on
the lobbying trip, students must
file a resume, copies of cover
letters sent to offices, and any
other information, such as writ
ing samples and transcripts, in
the Stanf ord-in-Government of
fice in the Old Firehouse. Appli
cants must also fill out a prefer
ence form listing their top in
ternship choices.
Students applying for in
ternships should turn in their
applications to the Stanford-in-
Government office by Friday,
Feb. 6, said Tom Girlich, chair
person of Stanford-in-Govern
ment's board of directors.
The board members going to
Washington will carefully re
view each student's files, and all
applicants are expected to come
to an informal interview session
scheduled for next week.
When the lobbyists meet with
the intern coordinators in Wash
ington, they will try to represent
the Stanford candidates in the
best light possible by emphasiz
ing their special qualities, going
into greater detail on the indi
vidual's application, and provid
ing additional information
about the students.
"In the past, we've been very

successful in getting internships
for Stanford students. The of
fices are impressed that we take
time out from our schedules to
fly back East and lobby for
them," said Girlich.
Girlich emphasized that it's
not too late to apply. "The dead
line for applications is Feb. 6,
but if a great number of applica
tions are submitted after this
date, we will consider them," he
said.
He added that students don't
have to be majoring in political
science to apply for an in

ternship because the offices
look for diverse candidates.
"They accept just as many com
puter science and electrical en
gineering majors," he said.
The preference sheets are
particularly important because
the lobbyists may not be able to
lobby at every office to which
the student has applied. "Since
the majority of students want
internships on Capitol Hill, we
lobby in the offices on the Hill
first, and then if we have time,
we lobby at agencies and
private interest groups," Girl

ich said.
In addition to the lobbying
trip, Stanford-in-Government
offers housing and financial in
formation that students can util
ize in applying. "Stanford-in-

Government offers students an
opportunity to participate in
government directly by provid
ing a complete package on how
to apply to Washington, D.C.,"
said Zimberoff.

Students who wish to have Stanford-in-
Government lobbyists speak for them in
Washington should turn their applications
in by Friday, February 6.
