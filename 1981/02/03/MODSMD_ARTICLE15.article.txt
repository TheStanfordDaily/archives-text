## Rod Beckstrom et. al. Volunteer armed forces would be more democratic 
### 
The United States Armed
Forces have drawn increasing
criticism for their decreasing
capacity to defend the country
in time of crisis. There is a need
for a viable defense system for
our coiuitry, yet this need is not
being satisfactorily met.
The quality of our forces is so
poor that the army has had to re
duce its training manuals to the
fifth grade reading level so that
today's recruit can understand
them. The reserves are esti
mated to be some 400,000 men
short. We are presently in a situ
ation where it is conceivable
that we would not have the op
tion to choose whether to engage
in military action for our allies'
defense simply because we do
not have sufficient backup
forces to replenish casualties.
The current registration pro
gram has helped alleviate this
problem to a limited extent as it
decreases by one-fifth the time
from which an individual would
be called upon for service to the
time he is ready for the front
line. If we had an adequate sur
plus of trained soldiers on re
serve at least we would have the
option to determine whether or
not our legitimate interests

were threatened and decide as
individuals whether to take part
in the military action or not.
Minorities are greatly over
represented among service per
sonnel in active duty. In West
Germany, where we have the
heaviest concentration of
troops, one-half of the men who
would be called upon for front
line duty are of hispanic or black
origin, in Vietnam 40 percent of
the casualties were suffered by
minorities, who compose 20
percent of our country's popu
lation. Many of the wealthy
could afford to attend college
and thereby avoid the draft. If
drafted once out of school, they
were often stationed behind the
front lines.
The creation of the all-volun
teer army is tantamount to the
creation of a mercenary class
consisting for the most part of
those who are driven to military
service for economic reasons
and those who enter the military
because the only talent they
have is for the brutality of war.
In many countries every
youth must serve time in the
military forces. In Israel, for
example, a well-developed na
tional reserve system has

helped defend the country from
hostile neighbors over the past
30 years. Shimon Peres, the
former defense minister of Is
rael, wrote that the "spirit of
public duty and a concern for
others" was instilled in those
who served.
Eli Roth, an Israeli graduate
student at Stanford, discussed
his thoughts on national service.
Roth cited a quote from John
Kennedy, "Ask not what your
country can do for you. . .
Roth said, "Ask a sample Amer
ican what he did for his country
and he will probably say 'noth
ing.' "
The Israeli army has many
features that make it attractive
to a democracy such as ours.
Frequent turnover keeps the
army from conservatism and in
ertia. Because of the youth
fulness of the army, there is no
old officer class to influence na
tional politics. Male and female
alike, all Israelis must serve in
the military and only a few ul
tra-orthodox Israelis are ex
empt from national service.
Switzerland is another coun
try with a universal military
service program. In conjunction
with a skillfully executed policy

of neutrality, it has provided the
Swiss with peace for over 160
years. In Switzerland each male
undergoes four months of basic
training at the age of 20 and then
remains in the active reserve
until the age of 50. The whole
country, as a consequence, is
armed and ready for immediate
duty. The military is an in
separable part of society, not an
autonomous machine, and for
many Swiss, is a source of cam
era derie.
We recognize the fact that the
U.S. is and has been involved in
world politics to a far greater
degree than simple security
would merit. The U.S. involve
ment with the Somoza regime
and the confused courtship with
imperial Iran are clear ex
amples of the U.S. overstepping
its authority. As Americans, it
is our responsibility to provide
for the defense of our country as
it is our responsibility to avoid a
repeat of the Vietnam War. Our
defense needs are not now being
met.
We Americans are avoiding
our equal responsibilities to de
fend this country with the pres
ent system by paying the poor
and the uneducated to do it for

us. This is a cop-out on the part
of our nation's leaders, and not
registration, as Nicodemus and
other registration resisters
have written.
This country needs a national
youth service program. Several
bills to this effect have already
been introduced in Congress. If
equal numbers of people from
all levels of society spend time
in national civil service or in the
defense of their country, there
would probably be far better
communication between our
servicemen and our nation's
leaders.
Reintegrating the military
into society will not militarize

the citizenry, but rather civilize
the military. After all, how well
can anyone transmit an account
of the war if he can only read
and write at the fifth grade
level?
