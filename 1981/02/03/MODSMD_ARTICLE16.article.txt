## Rightist dictatorships no better than left 
### 
Whatever misconceptions
L.H. Gann suffers with respect
to the current civil war in El
Salvador (Daily, Jan. 26) he is
plain-spoken about his prefer
ence for right-wing dic
tatorships . . . "right-wing au
thoritarian regimes are (his em
phasis) preferable to com
munist regimes and not just
from the standpoint of the
rich."
Gann denies a political view
which sees communism as a
monolithic world conspiracy yet
he insists that all communists
"attempt to control every
aspect of life, art, philosophy,
science, religion . . all com
munists of all persuasions use
camouflage tactics and most
absurdly, only communists
practice "mass liquidations."
Gann is not merely painting
with a wide brush â€” he is
splashing red paint everywhere.
His strident anti-communism
is only at issue here because he
mistakenly and insistently uses
it as "camouflage" from which
to launch a smear campaign
against the popular liberation
struggle in El Salvador.
Further, he attempts to lend
credence to one of the most vi
cious right-wing military dic
tatorships in modern Latin
American history.
By Gann's right-wing logic,
millions of Jews and other
ethnic peoples of Europe
massacred by the right-wing
German Third Reich were in
deed "better dead than red."
The same must hold for the hun
dreds of thousands slaughtered
in East Timor by Suharto of In
donesia, or the tens of thousands
tortured and murdered in Ar
gentina and Chile by right-wing
military regimes.
This tragic right-wing
brutality is no more justifiable
than abuses of human rights in
socialist bloc countries. As for
Gann's conviction that the
right-wingers are better able to
protect art, philosophy, science
and religion, El Salvador is liv

ing testimony to the contrary.
We witness the Catholic Church
and its people undergoing a per
secution whose brutality, to
quote the recently assassinated
Archbishop Romero "almost
defies human imagination."
Even U.S. nuns are not exempt
from the rape and assassina
tions of the right in El Salvador.
What we have in El Salvador to
day is a perversion of culture
where torture is an art form,
fascism a philosophy and death
a science.
Gann's argument is simply
that the worst right-winger is
still the lesser of two evils. He
presumes that the El
Salvadorean people are being
misled by "deceptive com
munists" and are not capable of
leading their own revolution or
their own post-revolutionary re

construction. With such a mech
anistic and deterministic
analysis, one wonders if Gann
hasn't studied so much Marx
ism that it is creeping in through
the back door.
While I make no pretensions
to being a textbook scholar of
Marx, Gramsci or Castro as
does Gann, I have seen first
hand the human carnage left be
hind by former Nicaraguan dic
tator Anastacio Somoza. Before
he fled Nicaragua, Somoza had
his air force bomb every school,
hospital and factory possible.
Another right-wing culture lov
er to Gann's satisfaction, I
would imagine.
Since Gann has a penchant for
historical example, why does he
continuously sidestep the ob
vious example of post-revolu
tionary Nicaragua with more

freedom of press than any coun
try in Latin America controlled
by the right? There has been no
blood bath as Gann would pre
dict, but there has been a liter
acy campaign that won two in
ternational awards, a coopera
tive farming program, new
health clinics and schools, and
in general, the most impressive
reconstruction effort in
Nicaraguan history.
It is the vision of these possi
bilities which give the El
Salvadorean people their
strength and hope. Sister Sand
ra Price gave a first-hand ac
count of the effects of the El
Salvadorean junta, supported
with U.S. weapons and dollars,
last Friday.
