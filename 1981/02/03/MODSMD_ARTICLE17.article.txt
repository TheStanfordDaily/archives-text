What waste?
If President Ronald Reagan
reads the Daily, one hopes he's
learned something from the re
cent exchange between Mike
Charlson and Max Mazenko.
Charlson wrote on Jan. 9 that
administrative waste runs ram
pant at Stanford; the two ex
amples he cited were of im
provements to Santa Teresa
Street and the Press Courtyard.
On Jan. 21 Mazenko defended
the work, attacking Charlson's
argument on about a dozen
fronts.
The lesson for our new Presi
dent in all this is that one per
son's waste is another's vital
program. Reagan, when asked
how he'll cut taxes, raise mili
tary spending, and balance the
budget, respondes courageous
ly, "Cut waste!" However, eve
ry dollar of "waste" in the fed
eral budget has been fought for,
and if some group was able to
fight hard enough to get it into
the budget, that group will sure
ly fight even harder to keep it

there.
I'd like to be more optimistic
about Reagan's ability to cut the
federal budget. But when one
city expects federal aid because
it's growing, another expects
aid because it's shrinking, a
farmer expects aid because it's
cold, and a ski resort expects aid
because it's warm — which one
do you charge with "waste"?
Our only chance at sensible
budget-cutting lies in a Presi
dent who is willing to pass up the
path of least resistance and in
stead somehow inspire people to
accept less from government —
less not for other people, but for
themselves. President Jimmy
Carter tried hard to save money
(remember the water
projects?) but was incapable of
persuading many other people
to go along. Perhaps Reagan
can be more convincing. But
first he'll have to drop his
rhetoric about "waste" and ad
dress the real Issues.

Hostage insult
I was amazed when I saw the
political cartoon by Philip Chalk
(Daily, Jan. 23). To imply that
the first thoughts of the 52 re
leased hostages were those of
money is an insult to each of
these men and women and to the
readers of the Daily. Money
matters had no place in the
minds of these individuals as
they tried to maintain their san
ity and dignity while in captivi
ty. I am sure that the hostages'
thoughts were on much more
mundane things like seeing
their families again.
While it is probably true that
some of these men and women
will write of their experiences
in Iran, the money that they re
ceive will not even begin to com
pensate for the daily physical
and psychological torture they
had to endure.
