## Grads need stipends, not center 
### 
I agree with Harry Mairson's
column (Daily, Jan. 23) on grad
uate student financial support in
the humanities and social sci
ence. He's right: if this school
wants to be serious about the hu
manities, it's time to put some
money into them. I don't mean
putting money into the new hu
manities center: the humanities
center is only icing on the cake.
Unless stipends for graduate
study in humanities here soon
rise dramatically, there will be
no cake to be iced.
Since 1976-77 the stipend of
fered by the Departmental Fel
lows Plan has risen about 35
percent. In the same period,
costs as estimated by the Uni
versity have risen almost 60
percent — almost twice as fast
as financial support. Each year
the stipend is raised to match
the predicted rate of inflation
(though tuition and rents rise
faster than that). Each year the
dean turns out — oops! — to
have underestimated inflation.
Have they ever compensated
for these errors by raising the
stipend more then next year?
No. The situation in social sci
ences is similar; in education
it's worse.
The result of this procedure?
No one can live on the stipend.
Graduate students are forced
into relying on spouse support,
into working while studying full
time or into heavy debt.

Is this true at other univer
sities? I doubt it. When I entered
graduate school, I was offered
scholarships by five schools;
Stanford's offer was by several
hundred dollars the lowest of
all. If our money keeps disap
pearing in this way, the gradu
ate students will eventually fol
low it. Stanford will find it ever
harder to attract graduate stu
dents, especially poor and mi
nority students and bright stu
dents, who will have better of
fers elsewhere. What will we do
then with an expensive center
for the humanities? What will
we do then with our extensive
and expensive graduate facul
ty?

Since November, represent
atives of the departments on the
Fellows Plan have been meet
ing as the Stanford Fellows As
sociation to seek remedies for
the shabby treatment we have
been receiving from the admin
istration. So far we have gotten

no satisfaction. The president of
the University has declined to
meet with graduate students to
answer questions about the Uni
versity's commitment to gradu
ate support.
I fear that his refusal itself
speaks eloquently to the ques
tion. The vice provost and dean
of graduate studies and re
search has informed us that
"the stipends . . . are merit
awards," by which 1 gather that
he means they are not supposed
to meet living expenses.
If this is so, why did he an
nounce to the department heads
of the University last Sept. 15
that stipend recipients "are ex
pected to be in full-time study"

and mustn't work more than
eight hours a week without his
prior approval? I scent a con
tradiction here.
As Mairson observes, the
crux of the matter is the Univer
sity's priorities. As long as
graduate stipends are expen
dable, our situation is unlikely
to improve. But if the dean ever
comes to believe that stipends
are as important as he says they
are ("It is a problem to which
we are turning our every atten
tion"), I daresay he will find a
way to help us better than he has
so far.
Let us work to persuade the
administration that they should
really devote their serious at
tention to this problem. Our
message to graduate students:
write the dean, write the prov
ost, write the president. To
graduate faculty: help us.
Without stipends to make our
studies feasible, you won't have
graduate students much longer.
We don't ask to be wealthy. But
it is a scandal to make us
paupers.
