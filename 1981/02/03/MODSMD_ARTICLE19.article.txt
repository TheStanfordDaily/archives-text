## 'Reform' in South Africa 
### 
Having read Keith
Archuleta's article on South
Africa (I)aily, Jan. 28) with in
terest, and having seen Last
Grave at Dimbaza twice over
the last four years, I felt a re
sponse was appropriate. The
conditions of blacks in South
Africa certainly sound terrible
from the perspective of students
at Stanford, but Africa is a poor
continent with many oppressive
governments, both white-ruled
and black-ruled. Compared to
the citizens of many of the
black-controlled nations of
Africa, South African blacks are
doing fairly well.
Hunger in South Africa is
hardly as prevalent as it is in
other African nations. In fact,
South Africa is an exporter of
food to many other African na
tions. And $175 per year does not
sound as bad when compared to
average incomes on the rest of
the continent. South Africa is
certainly not the only African
nation experiencing a housing
shortage. And I am not con
vinced that civil rights are more
severely restricted for blacks in
South Africa than they are in the
many black-run police states on
the continent. The black ruling
classes in these nations certain
ly enjoy all of the privileges
ascribed to whites in South
Africa. In much of Africa blacks
are oppressed by blacks. In
South Africa blacks are op
pressed by whites. Regardless
of the skin color of the rulers,
the hunger, poverty and in
justice are the same.
But suppose that somehow we
are effective in our attempts to
"reform" South Africa. How
are we to avoid the kind of
backlash that took place in
Iran? The shah was not over
thrown because he ran a vicious
police state. He fell because, in
response to pressure from the
U.S., he moved too fast in his at
tempt to westernize Iran. Is
lamic culture may seem cruel,
barbaric and sexist to us. Per
haps it is, but clumsy attempts
at cultural reform only make
things worse. I see no reason to
believe that a crusade to bring
racial equality to South Africa
will not result in even more
bloodshed and injustice than our
experiment in Iran.
A blunder such as that in
South Africa could have devas
tating consequences for Ameri
ca. I do not subscribe to the
"poor insecure Soviets" theory
on the continuing Russian arms
buildup. Hitler told the world of
his intentions in Mein Kampf a
decade before he came to
power, and 15 years before

World War 11. Evidently nobody
thought he really meant it. Simi
larly, the Soviets have been
making their objectives clear
for over 30 years. Clearly, many
of the problems and instabilities
(e.g., Poland) currently threat
ening the Soviet Empire would
be alleviated if the West could
be checkmated and controlled.
The Soviet Union and South
Africa currently hold 98 percent
of the world's known reserves of
manganese ore and 96 percent of
the world's chrome ore. These
resources are vital to our de
fense and other industries. If
South Africa were to plunge into

a racial civil war, America
would be dependent upon the So
viet Union for the raw materials
needed to build strategic weap
ons. Checkmate.
I am not belittling the very
real problems that exist in South
Africa. It would be wonderful if
we had the power and the wis
dom to bring racial harmony
and equality to South Africa.
But our mission today is sur
vival. We must find our allies
wherever we can if we are to
meet the Soviet challenge and
protect our way of life.

World War 11. Evidently nobody
thought he really meant it. Simi
larly, the Soviets have been
making their objectives clear
for over 30 years. Clearly, many
of the problems and instabilities
(e.g., Poland) currently threat
ening the Soviet Empire would
be alleviated if the West could
be checkmated and controlled.
The Soviet Union and South
Africa currently hold 98 percent
of the world's known reserves of
manganese ore and 96 percent of
the world's chrome ore. These
resources are vital to our de
fense and other industries. If
South Africa were to plunge into

a racial civil war, America
would be dependent upon the So
viet Union for the raw materials
needed to build strategic weap
ons. Checkmate.
I am not belittling the very
real problems that exist in South
Africa. It would be wonderful if
we had the power and the wis
dom to bring racial harmony
and equality to South Africa.
But our mission today is sur
vival. We must find our allies
wherever we can if we are to
meet the Soviet challenge and
protect our way of life.
