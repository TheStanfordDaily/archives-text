# El Salvador policy condemned
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
A coalition of six professors from
Stanford and UC-Berkeley yesterday
issued a statement condemning U.S.
aid to the "brutal military regime" in
El Salvador, calling for the immediate
withdrawal of U.S. military personnel
from that country.
The professors, all members of the
Faculty Committee for Human Rights
in El Salvador, held a news conference
yesterday morning at the San Francis
co Press Club.
They included four Stanford facul
ty: Prof. Richard Fagen, a specialist
in Latin American affairs, Emeritus
Prof. St. Clair Drake of the an
thropology and sociology depart
ments, Prof. Clark Reynolds of the
Stanford Food Research Institute and
Sociology Prof. William Goode, who is
a senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion.
For the past month the committee
has circulated an open letter to Presi
dent Ronald Reagan demanding that
the United States halt all military aid
to the junta ruling El Salvador.
'National response'
More than 300 faculty members
from the two campuses, and more
than 1300 professors nationwide, have
signed, according to committee mem
ber Bluma Goldstein, associate pro
fessor of German at Berkeley.
Goldstein read the letter and por
tions of a press statement.
"Widespread misery has prevailed
in El Salvador for many decades and
efforts for change have been held in
check only through brutal repression,
massacre and torture," the statement
reads.
"Now, after 50 years of military
rule in the interests of a tiny minority,
it is clear that drastic change must
take place. . . Yet Americans find
their government committed to a re
gime that is opposing all meaningful
reform, a regime that has no popular
support whatever."
'Victim of exploitation'
Reynolds characterized El
Salvador as "the worst example of a
country where the majority of people
have been kept away from a decent
chance to make a living, and it is not
because the country is poor in re
sources.
"It is one of the richest in Latin
America, but those riches are fun
neled into the hands of a few people."
Fagen said he believes that U.S. pol
icy in the region has been misguided.
"There has been an unhappy history
of U.S. involvement not only in El
Salvador, but also elsewhere in Cen
tral America, Latin America and the
Third World.
"Our first concern is that it should

not be repeated," he said.
Fagen said he views last week's re
call of Robert White, who served un
der the Carter administration as U.S.
ambassador to El Salvador as a step
toward "the militarization of El
Salvador."
One of the reasons why White was
fired is "that he at least occasionally
put human rights concerns above a
false and repressive set of security
concerns, Fagen added.
"White saw, even if only dimly, both
sides of the equation."
He provided a barrier to further
military involvement, he said.
"We are here to express our con
cern at the outrage of further Ameri
caninvolvement," which Fagen said
will eventually lead to the "Vietnam
ization of Central America."
'A Central American Domino?'
Many policy makers invoke the
"domino theory" to justify U.S. sup
port of the present government. They
charge that Cuba and ultimately the
Soviet Union are behind the popular
movement in El Salvador.
"Our underlying fear is that the So
viets or the Cubans will use El
Salvador as some kind of base,"
Goode said.
"Our anti-Soviet theory is so per
vasive that we do not want any country
to go communist."
While Fagen acknowledged that the
popular guerilla movement in El
Salvador has borrowed from the revo
lution in Nicaragua he pointed out,
"There is no truth to any allegations

that the Cubans are somehow behind
what is going on. What is going on is a
struggle against a brutal military dic
tatorship."
Fagen said that he had recently de
bated Reagan adviser Constantine
Menges on public radio. Menges
argued that a change of government in
El Salvador "imperiled not only
Guatemala but also Mexico."
Menges reminded Fagen of the "ul
timate domino"- the United States.
Fagen responded by saying it is er
roneous to believe that the fate of El
Salvador will affect what happens in
Texas.
'Invasion a dangerous option'
The professors stressed tha. an in
vasion of El Salvador would be "a
travesty," as Reynolds put it, in light
of U.S. criticism of the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan. They also said an in
vasion would be impractical and cost
ly-
The panel agreed that the Reagan
administration should reject any in
tervention, even on pragmatic
grounds. Said Goode, "they (the ad
ministration) claim that they do not
want to make bad investments. This is
a bad investment."
Reynolds said that while only a few
thousand troops would be needed to
achieve a stalemate. 60 to 70 thousand
would be needed to "pacify" the coun
try.
The panelists said they do not ex
pect the petition to bring about dra
matic results, but that it is never
theless important to demonstrate pop
ular opposition.

to the junta ruling El Salvador.
'National response'
More than 300 faculty members
from the two campuses, and more
than 1300 professors nationwide, have
signed, according to committee mem
ber Bluma Goldstein, associate pro
fessor of German at Berkeley.
Goldstein read the letter and por
tions of a press statement.
"Widespread misery has prevailed
in El Salvador for many decades and
efforts for change have been held in
check only through brutal repression,
massacre and torture," the statement
reads.
"Now, after 50 years of military
rule in the interests of a tiny minority,
it is clear that drastic change must
take place. . . Yet Americans find
their government committed to a re
gime that is opposing all meaningful
reform, a regime that has no popular
support whatever."
'Victim of exploitation'
Reynolds characterized El
Salvador as "the worst example of a
country where the majority of people
have been kept away from a decent
chance to make a living, and it is not
because the country is poor in re
sources.
"It is one of the richest in Latin
America, but those riches are fun
neled into the hands of a few people."
Fagen said he believes that U.S. pol
icy in the region has been misguided.
"There has been an unhappy history
of U.S. involvement not only in El
Salvador, but also elsewhere in Cen
tral America, Latin America and the
Third World.
"Our first concern is that it should

not be repeated," he said.
Fagen said he views last week's re
call of Robert White, who served un
der the Carter administration as U.S.
ambassador to El Salvador as a step
toward "the militarization of El
Salvador."
One of the reasons why White was
fired is "that he at least occasionally
put human rights concerns above a
false and repressive set of security
concerns, Fagen added.
"White saw, even if only dimly, both
sides of the equation."
He provided a barrier to further
military involvement, he said.
"We are here to express our con
cern at the outrage of further Ameri
caninvolvement," which Fagen said
will eventually lead to the "Vietnam
ization of Central America."
'A Central American Domino?'
Many policy makers invoke the
"domino theory" to justify U.S. sup
port of the present government. They
charge that Cuba and ultimately the
Soviet Union are behind the popular
movement in El Salvador.
"Our underlying fear is that the So
viets or the Cubans will use El
Salvador as some kind of base,"
Goode said.
"Our anti-Soviet theory is so per
vasive that we do not want any country
to go communist."
While Fagen acknowledged that the
popular guerilla movement in El
Salvador has borrowed from the revo
lution in Nicaragua he pointed out,
"There is no truth to any allegations

that the Cubans are somehow behind
what is going on. What is going on is a
struggle against a brutal military dic
tatorship."
Fagen said that he had recently de
bated Reagan adviser Constantine
Menges on public radio. Menges
argued that a change of government in
El Salvador "imperiled not only
Guatemala but also Mexico."
Menges reminded Fagen of the "ul
timate domino"- the United States.
Fagen responded by saying it is er
roneous to believe that the fate of El
Salvador will affect what happens in
Texas.
'Invasion a dangerous option'
The professors stressed tha. an in
vasion of El Salvador would be "a
travesty," as Reynolds put it, in light
of U.S. criticism of the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan. They also said an in
vasion would be impractical and cost
ly-
The panel agreed that the Reagan
administration should reject any in
tervention, even on pragmatic
grounds. Said Goode, "they (the ad
ministration) claim that they do not
want to make bad investments. This is
a bad investment."
Reynolds said that while only a few
thousand troops would be needed to
achieve a stalemate. 60 to 70 thousand
would be needed to "pacify" the coun
try.
The panelists said they do not ex
pect the petition to bring about dra
matic results, but that it is never
theless important to demonstrate pop
ular opposition.
A coalition of six professors from
Stanford and UC-Berkeley yesterday
issued a statement condemning U.S.
aid to the "brutal military regime" in
El Salvador, calling for the immediate
withdrawal of U.S. military personnel
from that country.
The professors, all members of the
Faculty Committee for Human Rights
in El Salvador, held a news conference
yesterday morning at the San Francis
co Press Club.
They included four Stanford facul
ty: Prof. Richard Fagen, a specialist
in Latin American affairs, Emeritus
Prof. St. Clair Drake of the an
thropology and sociology depart
ments, Prof. Clark Reynolds of the
Stanford Food Research Institute and
Sociology Prof. William Goode, who is
a senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion.
For the past month the committee
has circulated an open letter to Presi
dent Ronald Reagan demanding that
the United States halt all military aid
to the junta ruling El Salvador.
