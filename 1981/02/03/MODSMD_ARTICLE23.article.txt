# A 						miner who didn't like the U.S.
## 
### Associated Press 
Mojave Desert, Calif. —
Hidden in a rugged range of
desert mountains 150 miles
northeast of Los Angeles is a
mysterous anti-American,
pro-Russian shrine
It is a corrugated-iron
miner's shack, covered in
side and out with well-pre
served, penciled messages
about the "noble Russian
people," "our great leader
Stalin," "Democratic
dogs," "worthless American
women" and astrology.
"I am certain no more
than a dozen people have
ever been back in here and
seen this cabin," said Tom
Chapman, 68, who acted as a
guide on the 10-mile hike
over steep cliffs and rocky
gullies in the scorching
desert sun to the remote site.
Chapman, who has lived in

the desert 30 miles from the
cabin since being released
from a Japanese prison
camp in the Philippines in
1945, found the shrine while
hiking through the area in
1950. He has returned to the
shack many times during the
past 30 years.
The writings on the walls
are one man's diary of the
war years and his reactions
to the events of the times.
Accurate dates and descrip
tions of many World War II
battles are penciled on the
walls.
"I have radio. I listen all
the time," notes one entry.
Scattered among the
chronicles of the historic
events are accounts of the
man's successes and failures
as a miner.
An entry dated September,
1943, reads: "This was a

good summer picking gold
out of kreeks and rivers."
Three months later, he
wrote: "i work claims for
weeks for noting, i dont find
more gold."
The following spring he
wrote, "In the five winter
monts i spent $70. In the citi i
would spendt $350 in five
monts."
Examples of his anti-
American, pro-Russian feel
ings include the followrng:
— "Russia is goliath of
world. Stalin don't take or
ders from U.S. United States
needs threshin from Japs.
Heil Stalin";
— "I dont care if i die on
road, in ditch or kreek, i will
always be with you Stalin";
—'' Russians are good peo
ple. Stalin is good ruler. My
mother and grandmother
always say world needs big

ger Russia. Amerika will be
Russian colony " ; and
— "Soon world have one
language. Russian language
of Communists."
He also wrote, "U.S. peo
ple all crucks. United States
born rats comme here
pesterin and stealin. I had
money in banks U.S. con
fiscated it."
Ralph Hevener, 68, a re
tired miner, has lived since
1934 in a canyon eight miles
from the Russian's shack.
"I remember him well,"
Hevener said. "He was an
enormous man. He had a
long, full black beard. He
was a loner.
"I never knew his name.
There were only three of us
miners living in this area
when the Russian was here.
To my knowledge. I was the
only one he ever talked to.
