# Toyota talks of tie-up with Ford
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Tokyo — Japanese production
has now outstripped the United
States' for the first time by a
margin of more than three mil
lion vehicles in 1980, and talk of
mergers among the 11 Japanese
automotive producers has
faded. Now, auto executives are
looking forward to a new
strategy to cope with interna
tional competition, which all of
them predict will become more
fierce than ever.
Takashi Ishihara, president
of Nissan, expressed the
strategy most directly when he
told foreign correspondents that
a combination of production of
Japanese models overseas and
tie-ups with foreign automotive
companies promises to provide
the basis of future growth for
Japan's auto industry.
Even Toyota, which is still
talking about eventually build
ing 3.5 million motor vehicles in
Japan after surpassing the 3-
million mark for the first time
in 1980, got into the act. It sur
prised the auto industry by an
nouncing last July that it had
started talks on a tie-up with
Ford Motor Co.

Eiji Toyoda, president of the
company, said he hoped to gain
what he called "an outlook" on
prospects for the Ford tie-up by
June.
Key to the internationaliza
tion movement, as Ishihara
viewed it, is an impending "all
out small-car war" forced upon
auto makers everywhere by ris
ing gasoline prices and the need
to conserve energy.
"Automotive companies of
every country, including Japan,
are racking their brains to work
out survival strategies to deal
with the U.S. giant — General
Motors," Ishihara said in an in
terview with the daily news
paper Japan Times. "There are
only two options — to tie up with
GM or join forces with other
makers in rivalry with GM.
"There may be a major
shakeout of the world auto in
dustry through either mergers
or realignment. Yet, I believe it
is still possible for the existing
auto makers to survive and
coexist through multiple link
ups," he added.
For the short run, auto ex
ecutives appeared to have
adopted one other strategy —

export restraints — that they
discussed only in oblique terms.
Last October, the Ministry of
International Trade and In
dustry "predicted" that
Japanese auto exports to the
United States would fall below
levels of the previous year in the
last three months of 1980. The
U.S. anti-monopoly law, which
forbids restraint of trade, was
widely held responsible for the
ministry's indirect terminology
in announcing what amounted to
a program of voluntary re
straint.
Exports to the United States
did, in fact, fall off — as "pre
dicted."
Now, the ministry is reported
to be urging Japanese makers to
hold passenger car exports to
the United States in each 3-
month period of 1981 to a level of

"around 450,000" — or 1.8 mil
lion units.
Including trucks and buses,
total vehicle exports to the Unit
ed States last year climbed 15.5
percent to 2.4 million.
Neither of the Big Two
(Toyota and Nissan) offered
any promises, but both pre
dicted that their exports will
drop slightly in 1981.
Overall, executives were pre
dicting a slight increase in prod
uction above 1980 s record-set
ting 11,042.884 vehicles — with
the increase expected to come
from a recovery of domestic
sales, which slumped last year
by 2.6 percent.
Exports, which took nearly 55
percent of the industry's prod
uction last year, however, were
still expected to acount for more
than half of 1981 sales.

ing gasoline prices and the need
to conserve energy.
"Automotive companies of
every country, including Japan,
are racking their brains to work
out survival strategies to deal
with the U.S. giant — General
Motors," Ishihara said in an in
terview with the daily news
paper Japan Times. "There are
only two options — to tie up with
GM or join forces with other
makers in rivalry with GM.
"There may be a major
shakeout of the world auto in
dustry through either mergers
or realignment. Yet, I believe it
is still possible for the existing
auto makers to survive and
coexist through multiple link
ups," he added.
For the short run, auto ex
ecutives appeared to have
adopted one other strategy —

export restraints — that they
discussed only in oblique terms.
Last October, the Ministry of
International Trade and In
dustry "predicted" that
Japanese auto exports to the
United States would fall below
levels of the previous year in the
last three months of 1980. The
U.S. anti-monopoly law, which
forbids restraint of trade, was
widely held responsible for the
ministry's indirect terminology
in announcing what amounted to
a program of voluntary re
straint.
Exports to the United States
did, in fact, fall off — as "pre
dicted."
Now, the ministry is reported
to be urging Japanese makers to
hold passenger car exports to
the United States in each 3-
month period of 1981 to a level of

"around 450,000" — or 1.8 mil
lion units.
Including trucks and buses,
total vehicle exports to the Unit
ed States last year climbed 15.5
percent to 2.4 million.
Neither of the Big Two
(Toyota and Nissan) offered
any promises, but both pre
dicted that their exports will
drop slightly in 1981.
Overall, executives were pre
dicting a slight increase in prod
uction above 1980 s record-set
ting 11,042.884 vehicles — with
the increase expected to come
from a recovery of domestic
sales, which slumped last year
by 2.6 percent.
Exports, which took nearly 55
percent of the industry's prod
uction last year, however, were
still expected to acount for more
than half of 1981 sales.
