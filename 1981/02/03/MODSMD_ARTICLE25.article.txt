## An illusory paradise: Magic Theatre runs one-acts 
### Stephen Nash 
The Magic Theatre never
fails to startle. Of course, other
theaters in San Francisco do ori
ginal and moving work (Theatre
Julian comes quickly to mind),
but the Magic Theatre
challenges like no other.
Often plays are powerful
enough to produce a change in
mood. It's only a question of
mood, however, and the next
day you feel much the same ex
cept for the memory. Less fre
quently, though, theater
changes not your moods but
your perceptions. In those
cases, you leave the theater
with scars that never quite heal
— good scars, however, and
scars without which theater
would have little cultural signif
icance.
Last Wednesday the Magic
Theatre was up to its scarring
potential with two one-act
plays. Both were brand new,
both are by women authors,
both were directed by David Os
twald and both were re
markable.
In "The Story" by Carol
Lashof (a Stanford graduate
student in Modern Thought and
Literature), the myth of Adam
and Eve is re-examined from
the point of view of Eve. We are
all very comfortable with the
story of Eve being created from
Adam's rib, of her tempting him
with an apple, and of their ban
ishment from the Garden of
Eden. In Lashof's version, Eve
was created first and there nev
er was a Paradise. Sure, she
was immortal. But she was an
outsider to nature, and had nev
er experienced joy or pain. So
she asked God to make her life
like all the other animals, even
though that meant accepting
death as well.
At that point she became
pregnant with Adam. The play
begins when he is 13 years old.
Unfortunately, Adam remem
bers what it was like to be in the
womb, and begins to think that
the womb was Paradise before
the fall. Dissatisfied with the

world he lives in, he tries to
change it by making clothing out
of furs and making a house and
furniture out of trees. Adam
wants to run away from ex
perience, to find a way back to
an Eden that never existed.
Eve, on the other hand, never
regrets her decision. She re
members the antiseptic side of
immortality, and revels in all
the experiences that nature of
fers. She discovers that even
pain and cold can be marvelous,
if they lead to a new awareness
of feeling. Eve has no desire to
change the world around her:
why kill a stag for its fur, she
reasons, when you can snuggle
with the sheep for warmth?
This doesn't put Adam and
Eve on the best of terms. And
things only get worse when they
discover sex. Eve is content
with the impermanence of or
gasm. but Adam sees it as a re
minder of Paradise, and is frus
trated when the feelings go
away. He also sees sex as a trap,
as a sin which is keeping him
from returning to a perfect
world which never existed in the
first place.
Unfortunately, human
biology is on Adam's side. When
Eve becomes pregnant, she is
unable to gather food for
herself. Also, she is older than
Adam, and growing weaker.
Before long she is dependent on
him for food and shelter, and it
becomes obvious that Adam's
version of history is the one that
is going to be passed from gen
eration to generation.
Although there is much to be
admired in this production,
there are two things in particu
lar which pleased me more than
anything else. The first was
Lashof's awareness of the dif
ference between prettiness and
beauty. The second was Roxann
Caballero's childlike (not child
ish) portrayal of Eve.
Our society makes much of
the pretty. The whole idea is
possibly best symbolized by
snapshots of babies and sunsets.
Pleasant, certainly, but then so

is Jello. Beauty is much more
aggressive. Like deep massage,
it hurts before it makes you feel
better. In Lashof's play. Eve
has given up immortality in or
der to be able to experience
beauty. Eve may admire the
flowers of summer, but she is
just as excited by the cold of
winter. She is after experience,
not just pleasant experience.
Caballero's acting displays
clearly Eve's excitement at
being a part of nature. Her per
formance is always fresh and
sensitive. She never loses her
sense of wonder. In our Calvin
Klein world of cool sophisti
cation. it is an attitude not often
seen.
Many people go to the theater
to be entertained, to escape. But
to search continually for the
perfect entertainment is to be
like Adam, continually
searching for a Paradise that
does not exist. It's better to be
like Eve, to want to be jarred.
And poked. And startled.

When a father is dying, it's a
time for the family to come to
gether, a time for remember
ing. a time for sharing final con
versations. Details — like the
way he combs his hair, the old
song that he likes to listen to.
how he holds his coffee cup —
are noticed for the first time, as
well as the last. A special in
timacy develops amid the
crying and the goodbyes.
If only it were like that. Per
haps it sometimes really does
happen that way — when the
father dies peacefully and
gracefully. But cancer is not a
pretty disease.
So you remember the man
who taught you to throw a
baseball, but that was before
the radiation therapy made his
hair fall out and blinded him in
one eye. You reminisce with
him about your first camping
trip, but he's so stoned on
morphine he doesn't recognize
you. You eat breakfast with him

one last time, but in the middle
of a piece of toast he wets the
bed
What's the best way to be
have? Do you try and ignore
what is happening to him and try
and see him the way he was
before he got sick? Do you take
care of his practical needs as if
he were any other invalid? Do
you try and come to terms with
his dying and reach a new level
of understanding? What is the
best way to perceive your
father?
Martine Getty (in her play
"Mr. Smith is Dying" at the
Magic Theatre) refuses to de
cide. Her refusal is a sign, not of
cowardice, but of maturity. It is
often easy to pose questions. It
can also be easy to suggest pos
sible solutions. But it often
takes great intelligence and
maturity to realize when there
are no simple answers — that all
that's available is a set of
choices. The correct answer
then depends as much on the
person asking the question as on
the question itself.
As you have probably already
guessed, "Mr. Smith is Dying"
is about a family in which the
father is dying of cancer. Paula,
one of two daughters, has re
turned home for the bedside vig
il. She is a perceptive woman
who wants to face her father':
death sensitively and honestly.
Her mother and sister, though,
don't want to deal with it. They
won't even tell the man that he
has cancer.
It is easy to identify with
Paula. Her maturity and in
telligence stand out from the be
ginning. That is, until we realize
that she is ignoring so much
about her father's disease.
Paula is incapable of under
standing the pain of cancer. She
doesn't want to know about bed
pans and injections. She won't
consider the possibility that her
father might not want to know
that he has cancer.
It soon becomes clear that
each member of the family has
come to terms with part of the
situation, but that none of them
can cope with all of the prob
lems. The mother loves her hus
band deeply, even as his body
falls apart. She takes care of his
medical needs as long as she
can, but as the disease
progresses she doesn't know
whether to trust the doctors or
her intuition. Joanna, the other
daughter, tries to avoid many of
the difficult emotional prob
lems in her family, but is not at
fault: this is simply her way of

easing the strains that cancer
has placed on the people she
loves most.
Although it was easy to sym
pathize with Paula at the begin
ning of the play, she is soon seen
to be no more admirable than
anyone else in the family. This
leaves the audience floating be
tween several points of view.
One solution is to pick one char
acter, decide that she is right
and everyone else is wrong, and
view the play having made that
choice. Getty intends to make us
come to terms with a polytonal
world, however — to acknowl
edge that it is impossible to
make any judgments on the
characters and to allow all
points of view to co-exist. Such a
world lacks resolutions, but sit
uations like these are similarly

lacking in resolutions.
The acting in the play is effec
tive in manipulating the au
dience's attitudes. Stephanie
Smith (as the mother) and Pa
tricia Falvey (as Joanna) allow
their characters to appear
foolish and childish at the begin
ning of the play. Only gradually
do they bring emotion and sensi
tivity to their performances.
Sandra Rider is especially strik
ing in the pivotal role of Paula.
Although much about her char
acter is known from the very be
ginning of the play, she gradu
ally changes the emphasis in her
acting to indicate the develop
ing insecurity in Paula.
There is much that could be
said about this play's debt to
cinema. The shortness of the

scenes, the use of medium and
long shots, the emotional dis
tance between stage and au
dience — all these are part of
the rhetoric of film. In addition,
much could be said about the
mythical nature of the father
character in the play. These are
tools used by Getty; however,
they should not be confused with
her goals.
A death in the family will nev
er be easy to handle. Many of the
problems come from members
being unsure about whether
they are "doing the right
thing." Maturity in such situ
ations does not come from
knowing the right way to be
have. It comes from knowing
that there are many right ways
to behave.

day you feel much the same ex
cept for the memory. Less fre
quently, though, theater
changes not your moods but
your perceptions. In those
cases, you leave the theater
with scars that never quite heal
— good scars, however, and
scars without which theater
would have little cultural signif
icance.
Last Wednesday the Magic
Theatre was up to its scarring
potential with two one-act
plays. Both were brand new,
both are by women authors,
both were directed by David Os
twald and both were re
markable.
In "The Story" by Carol
Lashof (a Stanford graduate
student in Modern Thought and
Literature), the myth of Adam
and Eve is re-examined from
the point of view of Eve. We are
all very comfortable with the
story of Eve being created from
Adam's rib, of her tempting him
with an apple, and of their ban
ishment from the Garden of
Eden. In Lashof's version, Eve
was created first and there nev
er was a Paradise. Sure, she
was immortal. But she was an
outsider to nature, and had nev
er experienced joy or pain. So
she asked God to make her life
like all the other animals, even
though that meant accepting
death as well.
At that point she became
pregnant with Adam. The play
begins when he is 13 years old.
Unfortunately, Adam remem
bers what it was like to be in the
womb, and begins to think that
the womb was Paradise before
the fall. Dissatisfied with the

world he lives in, he tries to
change it by making clothing out
of furs and making a house and
furniture out of trees. Adam
wants to run away from ex
perience, to find a way back to
an Eden that never existed.
Eve, on the other hand, never
regrets her decision. She re
members the antiseptic side of
immortality, and revels in all
the experiences that nature of
fers. She discovers that even
pain and cold can be marvelous,
if they lead to a new awareness
of feeling. Eve has no desire to
change the world around her:
why kill a stag for its fur, she
reasons, when you can snuggle
with the sheep for warmth?
This doesn't put Adam and
Eve on the best of terms. And
things only get worse when they
discover sex. Eve is content
with the impermanence of or
gasm. but Adam sees it as a re
minder of Paradise, and is frus
trated when the feelings go
away. He also sees sex as a trap,
as a sin which is keeping him
from returning to a perfect
world which never existed in the
first place.
Unfortunately, human
biology is on Adam's side. When
Eve becomes pregnant, she is
unable to gather food for
herself. Also, she is older than
Adam, and growing weaker.
Before long she is dependent on
him for food and shelter, and it
becomes obvious that Adam's
version of history is the one that
is going to be passed from gen
eration to generation.
Although there is much to be
admired in this production,
there are two things in particu
lar which pleased me more than
anything else. The first was
Lashof's awareness of the dif
ference between prettiness and
beauty. The second was Roxann
Caballero's childlike (not child
ish) portrayal of Eve.
Our society makes much of
the pretty. The whole idea is
possibly best symbolized by
snapshots of babies and sunsets.
Pleasant, certainly, but then so

is Jello. Beauty is much more
aggressive. Like deep massage,
it hurts before it makes you feel
better. In Lashof's play. Eve
has given up immortality in or
der to be able to experience
beauty. Eve may admire the
flowers of summer, but she is
just as excited by the cold of
winter. She is after experience,
not just pleasant experience.
Caballero's acting displays
clearly Eve's excitement at
being a part of nature. Her per
formance is always fresh and
sensitive. She never loses her
sense of wonder. In our Calvin
Klein world of cool sophisti
cation. it is an attitude not often
seen.
Many people go to the theater
to be entertained, to escape. But
to search continually for the
perfect entertainment is to be
like Adam, continually
searching for a Paradise that
does not exist. It's better to be
like Eve, to want to be jarred.
And poked. And startled.

When a father is dying, it's a
time for the family to come to
gether, a time for remember
ing. a time for sharing final con
versations. Details — like the
way he combs his hair, the old
song that he likes to listen to.
how he holds his coffee cup —
are noticed for the first time, as
well as the last. A special in
timacy develops amid the
crying and the goodbyes.
If only it were like that. Per
haps it sometimes really does
happen that way — when the
father dies peacefully and
gracefully. But cancer is not a
pretty disease.
So you remember the man
who taught you to throw a
baseball, but that was before
the radiation therapy made his
hair fall out and blinded him in
one eye. You reminisce with
him about your first camping
trip, but he's so stoned on
morphine he doesn't recognize
you. You eat breakfast with him

one last time, but in the middle
of a piece of toast he wets the
bed
What's the best way to be
have? Do you try and ignore
what is happening to him and try
and see him the way he was
before he got sick? Do you take
care of his practical needs as if
he were any other invalid? Do
you try and come to terms with
his dying and reach a new level
of understanding? What is the
best way to perceive your
father?
Martine Getty (in her play
"Mr. Smith is Dying" at the
Magic Theatre) refuses to de
cide. Her refusal is a sign, not of
cowardice, but of maturity. It is
often easy to pose questions. It
can also be easy to suggest pos
sible solutions. But it often
takes great intelligence and
maturity to realize when there
are no simple answers — that all
that's available is a set of
choices. The correct answer
then depends as much on the
person asking the question as on
the question itself.
As you have probably already
guessed, "Mr. Smith is Dying"
is about a family in which the
father is dying of cancer. Paula,
one of two daughters, has re
turned home for the bedside vig
il. She is a perceptive woman
who wants to face her father':
death sensitively and honestly.
Her mother and sister, though,
don't want to deal with it. They
won't even tell the man that he
has cancer.
It is easy to identify with
Paula. Her maturity and in
telligence stand out from the be
ginning. That is, until we realize
that she is ignoring so much
about her father's disease.
Paula is incapable of under
standing the pain of cancer. She
doesn't want to know about bed
pans and injections. She won't
consider the possibility that her
father might not want to know
that he has cancer.
It soon becomes clear that
each member of the family has
come to terms with part of the
situation, but that none of them
can cope with all of the prob
lems. The mother loves her hus
band deeply, even as his body
falls apart. She takes care of his
medical needs as long as she
can, but as the disease
progresses she doesn't know
whether to trust the doctors or
her intuition. Joanna, the other
daughter, tries to avoid many of
the difficult emotional prob
lems in her family, but is not at
fault: this is simply her way of

easing the strains that cancer
has placed on the people she
loves most.
Although it was easy to sym
pathize with Paula at the begin
ning of the play, she is soon seen
to be no more admirable than
anyone else in the family. This
leaves the audience floating be
tween several points of view.
One solution is to pick one char
acter, decide that she is right
and everyone else is wrong, and
view the play having made that
choice. Getty intends to make us
come to terms with a polytonal
world, however — to acknowl
edge that it is impossible to
make any judgments on the
characters and to allow all
points of view to co-exist. Such a
world lacks resolutions, but sit
uations like these are similarly

lacking in resolutions.
The acting in the play is effec
tive in manipulating the au
dience's attitudes. Stephanie
Smith (as the mother) and Pa
tricia Falvey (as Joanna) allow
their characters to appear
foolish and childish at the begin
ning of the play. Only gradually
do they bring emotion and sensi
tivity to their performances.
Sandra Rider is especially strik
ing in the pivotal role of Paula.
Although much about her char
acter is known from the very be
ginning of the play, she gradu
ally changes the emphasis in her
acting to indicate the develop
ing insecurity in Paula.
There is much that could be
said about this play's debt to
cinema. The shortness of the

scenes, the use of medium and
long shots, the emotional dis
tance between stage and au
dience — all these are part of
the rhetoric of film. In addition,
much could be said about the
mythical nature of the father
character in the play. These are
tools used by Getty; however,
they should not be confused with
her goals.
A death in the family will nev
er be easy to handle. Many of the
problems come from members
being unsure about whether
they are "doing the right
thing." Maturity in such situ
ations does not come from
knowing the right way to be
have. It comes from knowing
that there are many right ways
to behave.
The Magic Theatre never
fails to startle. Of course, other
theaters in San Francisco do ori
ginal and moving work (Theatre
Julian comes quickly to mind),
but the Magic Theatre
challenges like no other.
Often plays are powerful
enough to produce a change in
mood. It's only a question of
mood, however, and the next
day you feel much the same ex
cept for the memory. Less fre
quently, though, theater
changes not your moods but

Theatre was up to its scarring
potential with two one-act
plays. Both were brand new,
both are by women authors,
both were directed by David Os
twald and both were re
markable.
In "The Story" by Carol
Lashof (a Stanford graduate
student in Modern Thought and
Literature), the myth of Adam
and Eve is re-examined from
the point of view of Eve. We are
all very comfortable with the
story of Eve being created from
Adam's rib, of her tempting him
with an apple, and of their ban
ishment from the Garden of
Eden. In Lashof's version, Eve
was created first and there nev
er was a Paradise. Sure, she
was immortal. But she was an
outsider to nature, and had nev
er experienced joy or pain. So
she asked God to make her life
like all the other animals, even
though that meant accepting
death as well.
At that point she became
pregnant with Adam. The play
begins when he is 13 years old.
Unfortunately, Adam remem
bers what it was like to be in the
womb, and begins to think that
the womb was Paradise before
the fall. Dissatisfied with the

world he lives in, he tries to
change it by making clothing out
of furs and making a house and
furniture out of trees. Adam
wants to run away from ex
perience, to find a way back to
an Eden that never existed.
Eve, on the other hand, never
regrets her decision. She re
members the antiseptic side of
immortality, and revels in all
the experiences that nature of
fers. She discovers that even
pain and cold can be marvelous,
if they lead to a new awareness
of feeling. Eve has no desire to
change the world around her:
why kill a stag for its fur, she
reasons, when you can snuggle
with the sheep for warmth?
This doesn't put Adam and
Eve on the best of terms. And
things only get worse when they
discover sex. Eve is content
with the impermanence of or
gasm. but Adam sees it as a re
minder of Paradise, and is frus
trated when the feelings go
away. He also sees sex as a trap,
as a sin which is keeping him
from returning to a perfect
world which never existed in the
first place.
Unfortunately, human
biology is on Adam's side. When
Eve becomes pregnant, she is
unable to gather food for
herself. Also, she is older than
Adam, and growing weaker.
Before long she is dependent on
him for food and shelter, and it
becomes obvious that Adam's
version of history is the one that
is going to be passed from gen
eration to generation.
Although there is much to be
admired in this production,
there are two things in particu
lar which pleased me more than
anything else. The first was
Lashof's awareness of the dif
ference between prettiness and
beauty. The second was Roxann
Caballero's childlike (not child
ish) portrayal of Eve.
Our society makes much of
the pretty. The whole idea is
possibly best symbolized by
snapshots of babies and sunsets.
Pleasant, certainly, but then so

is Jello. Beauty is much more
aggressive. Like deep massage,
it hurts before it makes you feel
better. In Lashof's play. Eve
has given up immortality in or
der to be able to experience
beauty. Eve may admire the
flowers of summer, but she is
just as excited by the cold of
winter. She is after experience,
not just pleasant experience.
Caballero's acting displays
clearly Eve's excitement at
being a part of nature. Her per
formance is always fresh and
sensitive. She never loses her
sense of wonder. In our Calvin
Klein world of cool sophisti
cation. it is an attitude not often
seen.
Many people go to the theater
to be entertained, to escape. But
to search continually for the
perfect entertainment is to be
like Adam, continually
searching for a Paradise that
does not exist. It's better to be
like Eve, to want to be jarred.
And poked. And startled.

When a father is dying, it's a
time for the family to come to
gether, a time for remember
ing. a time for sharing final con
versations. Details — like the
way he combs his hair, the old
song that he likes to listen to.
how he holds his coffee cup —
are noticed for the first time, as
well as the last. A special in
timacy develops amid the
crying and the goodbyes.
If only it were like that. Per
haps it sometimes really does
happen that way — when the
father dies peacefully and
gracefully. But cancer is not a
pretty disease.
So you remember the man
who taught you to throw a
baseball, but that was before
the radiation therapy made his
hair fall out and blinded him in
one eye. You reminisce with
him about your first camping
trip, but he's so stoned on
morphine he doesn't recognize
you. You eat breakfast with him

one last time, but in the middle
of a piece of toast he wets the
bed
What's the best way to be
have? Do you try and ignore
what is happening to him and try
and see him the way he was
before he got sick? Do you take
care of his practical needs as if
he were any other invalid? Do
you try and come to terms with
his dying and reach a new level
of understanding? What is the
best way to perceive your
father?
Martine Getty (in her play
"Mr. Smith is Dying" at the
Magic Theatre) refuses to de
cide. Her refusal is a sign, not of
cowardice, but of maturity. It is
often easy to pose questions. It
can also be easy to suggest pos
sible solutions. But it often
takes great intelligence and
maturity to realize when there
are no simple answers — that all
that's available is a set of
choices. The correct answer
then depends as much on the
person asking the question as on
the question itself.
As you have probably already
guessed, "Mr. Smith is Dying"
is about a family in which the
father is dying of cancer. Paula,
one of two daughters, has re
turned home for the bedside vig
il. She is a perceptive woman
who wants to face her father':
death sensitively and honestly.
Her mother and sister, though,
don't want to deal with it. They
won't even tell the man that he
has cancer.
It is easy to identify with
Paula. Her maturity and in
telligence stand out from the be
ginning. That is, until we realize
that she is ignoring so much
about her father's disease.
Paula is incapable of under
standing the pain of cancer. She
doesn't want to know about bed
pans and injections. She won't
consider the possibility that her
father might not want to know
that he has cancer.
It soon becomes clear that
each member of the family has
come to terms with part of the
situation, but that none of them
can cope with all of the prob
lems. The mother loves her hus
band deeply, even as his body
falls apart. She takes care of his
medical needs as long as she
can, but as the disease
progresses she doesn't know
whether to trust the doctors or
her intuition. Joanna, the other
daughter, tries to avoid many of
the difficult emotional prob
lems in her family, but is not at
fault: this is simply her way of

easing the strains that cancer
has placed on the people she
loves most.
Although it was easy to sym
pathize with Paula at the begin
ning of the play, she is soon seen
to be no more admirable than
anyone else in the family. This
leaves the audience floating be
tween several points of view.
One solution is to pick one char
acter, decide that she is right
and everyone else is wrong, and
view the play having made that
choice. Getty intends to make us
come to terms with a polytonal
world, however — to acknowl
edge that it is impossible to
make any judgments on the
characters and to allow all
points of view to co-exist. Such a
world lacks resolutions, but sit
uations like these are similarly

lacking in resolutions.
The acting in the play is effec
tive in manipulating the au
dience's attitudes. Stephanie
Smith (as the mother) and Pa
tricia Falvey (as Joanna) allow
their characters to appear
foolish and childish at the begin
ning of the play. Only gradually
do they bring emotion and sensi
tivity to their performances.
Sandra Rider is especially strik
ing in the pivotal role of Paula.
Although much about her char
acter is known from the very be
ginning of the play, she gradu
ally changes the emphasis in her
acting to indicate the develop
ing insecurity in Paula.
There is much that could be
said about this play's debt to
cinema. The shortness of the

scenes, the use of medium and
long shots, the emotional dis
tance between stage and au
dience — all these are part of
the rhetoric of film. In addition,
much could be said about the
mythical nature of the father
character in the play. These are
tools used by Getty; however,
they should not be confused with
her goals.
A death in the family will nev
er be easy to handle. Many of the
problems come from members
being unsure about whether
they are "doing the right
thing." Maturity in such situ
ations does not come from
knowing the right way to be
have. It comes from knowing
that there are many right ways
to behave.
The Magic Theatre never
fails to startle. Of course, other
theaters in San Francisco do ori
ginal and moving work (Theatre
Julian comes quickly to mind),
but the Magic Theatre
challenges like no other.
Often plays are powerful
enough to produce a change in
mood. It's only a question of
mood, however, and the next
day you feel much the same ex
cept for the memory. Less fre
quently, though, theater
changes not your moods but
your perceptions. In those
cases, you leave the theater
with scars that never quite heal
— good scars, however, and
scars without which theater
would have little cultural signif
icance.
