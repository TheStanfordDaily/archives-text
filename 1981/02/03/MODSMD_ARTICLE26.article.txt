# Entertain the masses
## 
### 
Arts and Entertainment is looking for good
writers. If you've got the talent, we've got the
tickets â€” for rock and jazz concerts, the sym
phony and the ballet. We need people to review
films, plays, art exhibits and other events in the
Bay Area. We also need book reviewers for both

fiction and non-fiction. Experience in writing re
views isn't necessary: imagination, taste and the
ability to write well are.
Come to Arts and Entertainment's meeting this
Thursday at noon, at the Dailv office.
