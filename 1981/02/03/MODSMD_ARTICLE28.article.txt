# Battle of the sexists: Fonda and Co. flounder in 9 to 5
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Despite a windfall of good American mov
ies, 1980 was certainly not a banner year for
actresses. Most of the central contemporary
female characters have been throwbacks to
the Hollywood past because the pictures
themselves are throwbacks. In Coal Miner's
Daughter, Sissy Spacek played the showbiz
heartbreak kid from The Helen Morgan
Story, I'll Cry Tomorrow, Funny Girl and
Lady Sings the Blues. Mary Tyler Moore, in
Ordinary People, was a more sympathetic
variation on the WASP witches Joan Crawford
used to specialize in. The patient, loving
Marine wife in The Great Santini (Blythe
Danner) was really a staple of 1950s television
— Jane Wyatt, Harriet Nelson, Loretta
Young. And in spite of the moviemakers' at
tempt to give her a healthy sexuality, Ellen
Burstyn, as the faith healer in Resurrection,
was a premature earth mother, smiling so
hard that she seemed to cure people with her
teeth; she might have been biding her youth
until she could turn into Ma Joad (represented
in this movie by her grandmother, played by
Eva La Gallienne).
Few actresses have the power to choose
their roles; Jane Fonda is one of the few.
When she made the decision four years ago to
commit herself to a full-time screen career,
many were delighted, anticipating more work
like her performance in Klute, which may be

the best given by any actress in the past dec
ade. But her film work has been so consistent
ly disappointing that there are no excuses
for her. The incompleteness of her portrayal
of Lillian Hellman in Julia could be blamed on
the truncated nature of the movie — especial
ly since she was so fine in so much of it — and
Coming Home could be blamed on the
screenwriter's conception of her part. Comes
a Horseman was a poor choice, but everyone
makes poor choices sometimes, and though
she faded into the background in the second
half of The China Syndrome, at least she
started to create an interesting character in
the first scenes. But what on earth prompted
her to make The Electric Horseman?
When Fonda first appears in her newest
movie, .9 to 5, she is wearing a blue and pink
print dress, a grey hat, huge round glasses
with glittering frames,and a pink carnation,
and right away the viewer feels uneasy. Jane
Fonda can't play a woman of average in
telligence (as she proved in Coming Home).
In .9 to 5, she plays the divorcee-turned-secre
tary, Judy Burnley, and though she tries to be
light and funny, the results are appalling. She
telegraphs Judy's nervousness at her first job,
and what results are classic scenes of female
incompetence — shaking hands at the type
writer keys, a penchant for knocking over ob
jects — which surely cannot be what she in
tended. It's a disgraceful performance for an

actress of Fonda's stature.
Why would Jane Fonda choose to star in .9 to
5? (When one has to ask this kind of question
about a performer twice in a row, something
is wrong.) She couldn't have seen the other
movies Colin Higgins wrote and directed. Sil
ver Streak and Foul f'lay, or she could have
guessed what a loud, dumb mess it would be.
(Higgins has a co-writer on this picture — Pa
tricia Resnick — whose work with Robert
Altman, on A Wedding and (Juintet, did not
show promise.)

One's frail hopes that 9 to 5 will turn out to
be a witty comedy about the revenge three
abused secretaries — Fonda, Lily Tomlin and
Dolly Parton — take on their chauvinistic boss
(Dabney Coleman), are quickly smashed
when the plot unfolds. Yes, there are dream
sequences in which each woman envisions her
own sort of vengeance — an idea stolen from

Preston Sturges' Unfaithfully Yours — but
Higgins and Resnick were not inspired by
Sturges' most important quality: his
savagery. .9 to 5 is a gooey situation comedy in
which the near-death of the boss is a mistake,
and the three heroines spend a great deal of
time hiding stiffs and forging signatures. The
feminism declaimed repeatedly in this movie
is an offensive fake; how can a movie in which
one character (Judy) is a dodo, a second (Vi
olet) a brilliant organizer who maintains a
fabulous relationship with her kids and can

even install an electric eye in her garage, and
a third (Dora Lee), a sweet country gal in
capable of nastiness, be taken as a comic fan
tasy protest about the position of working
women? (The fourth female in the plot is a
snivelling, toadying monster, played by Eliz
abeth Wilson.)
Lily Tomlin is so funny in a lot of 9 to 5 that

she redeems some scenes, including her fan
tasy, in which, as a sweetly malevolent re
verse Snow White, she poisons the evil king
Her looped wink as she glides in with the lethal
cup of coffee is so charming that one almost
forgets how illogical it is that a tough cookie
like Violet would imagine herself as a fairy
tale princess. Dolly Parton is good to watch,
too; she has a warm, amiable presence, and
her line readings are much fresher than the
screenwriters deserve. Even Dabney Cole
man, stuck as the narcissistic bastard of an
employer, is often amusing. Wisely, he sees
his role as no more than a revue sketch, and he
gives it the energy of a Saturday Night Live
blackout.
But even this trio of worthwhile performers
can't disguise the phoniness of 9 to 5, or the in
competence of the people who put it together
— especially when Jane Fonda is an embodi
ment of all that is wrong with the movie. They
can't hide its soft center, either. At the end of
the movie, one sees that while the three pro
tagonists have kept their employer out of
commission, they have been effecting
changes in the office so humane that it has be
come a virtual Utopia. A drunken secretary
has given up liquor, the handicapped have
been hired, and the place is dazzling with
smiles and flowers. The response to a dearth
of good women's roles in American movies
turns out to be pure Frank Capracorn.

One's frail hopes that "9 to 5" will turnout to be a witty
comedy about the revenge three abused secretaries . . . take on
their chauvinistic boss . . . are quickly smashed when the plot
unfolds.
