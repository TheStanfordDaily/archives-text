Moscow denies terrorist charge
Moscow — The Soviet leadership said yesterday
that it is prepared to begin a "constructive
dialogue" with the Reagan administration, but it
said that Washington will first have to stop what it
called a "campaign hostile to the Soviet Union."
For the second day in a row, Moscow complained
bitterly about Secretary of State Alexander Haig's
charge that the Soviet Union supports international
terrorism. At the same time, the Soviet leadership
reaffirmed its determination to aid what it regards
as national liberation movements in Africa. Asia,
the Middle East, and Latin America.
The Kremlin communicated its position in a for
mal statement attributed to "Soviet leading
circles" published yesterday by the official news
agency Tass. Diplomats said that it could be as
sumed that the statement came from the ruling
Politburo.
Yesterday's statement drew a sharp distinction
between terrorism and what Moscow calls "the le
gitimate struggle of peoples for their national, eco
nomic and social emancipation" by means of "na
tional liberation movements.
. "It is only through ignorance or by evil design that
one can draw a parallel between these two absolute
ly different things," the statement declared, adding
that by the Reagan administration's logic George
Washington and the rest of America's founding
fathers qualified as terrorists. Speaking only in ab
stract terms, Tass said nothing about the State De
partment's specific allegations. Instead, Tass ac
cused the United States of interfering in El Salvador
"in line with the new political concept which de
clares to be terrorist any struggle of the peoples for
their political and economic independence and de
mocracy."
In reaffirming its support for revolutionary move
ments, one Western European diplomat noted. Mos
cow is saying in effect that detente applies only to
relations between the Soviet Union and the in
dustrialized world, the rest being open to contest.
Nominee Clark admits ignorance
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's con
troversial nominee for deputy secretary of state,
William Clark, got a rough going over yesterday
from Senate Democrats who seized on his admission
that he knows very little about foreign policy to hit
him with a barrage of questions he was unable to an
swer.
Although the Republican majority in the Senate is
expected to ensure Clark's confirmation, his hear
ing yesterday before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee saw the California Supreme Court jus
tice forced to respond repeatedly with "I don't
know" or "I'm not in a position to say" to questions
covering a broad range of foreign policy issues.
Focusing on the argument that Clark is supposed
to be the "alter ego" of Secretary of State Alexander
Haig, the Democrats drew from him the admission
that he cannot identify the prime ministers of South
Africa or Zimbabwe, knows nothing about the in
ternal affairs of the British Labor Party, and is un
aware of attitudes in Western Europe about deploy
ment of new U.S. missiles there.
Clark freely conceded that his experience in pub
lic life — first as chief of staff to Reagan when he
was governor of California and then as a jurist —
had given him no grounding in foreign policies.
But, Clark added, he believes he can learn what is
required; and, in a point he stressed repeatedly, he
said Reagan had chosen him on the basis of his abili
ties as an administrator. It was his understanding.

Clark said, that his main function would be to apply
these administrative talents to seeing that the de
partment functions efficiently.
But as Sen John Glenn, D-Ohio, said on behalf of
committee Democrats, "We look at you as a pseudo
secretary of state We don't look at you as just an ad
ministrator making sure the trains run on time
around the State Department."
Reagan affirms ties to Korea
Washington — The United States will maintain
the strength of its forces in South Korea and give its
Pacific commitments the same weight it accords its
European alliances. President Ronald Reagan told
South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan yesterday.
Reagan's cordial reception of Chun for 80 minutes
of talks and a White House lunch marked a dramatic
public thaw in the near-frigid relationship that has
existed between Washington and Seoul in the four
years since former President Jimmy Carter dis
closed plans for withdrawing of U.S. ground forces.
The Carter White House had linked its proposal
with concern over South Korea's human rights poli
cies.
A State Department official who attended yester
day's Reagan-Chun meeting said that the question of
human rights in Korea came up, but "not in a retro
spective way." He would not discuss Kim Dae Jung,
the opposition leader whose death sentence Chun re
cently commuted. Both the Carter and Reagan ad
ministrations had urged such action.
Reagan told Chun at a farewell ceremony "that
the United States will remain a reliable Pacific
partner and we shall maintain the strength of our
forces in the Pacific area. I hope our Asian allies,
Korea. Japan. Australia, New Zealand . . . know
that we'll have just as much alliance with them —
and they will have our continued support — as our
European allies have."
'Columbia' launch delayed again
Cape Canaveral — The launch of the first space
shuttle, already running two years behind original
plans, will be delayed at least a month beyond its
scheduled March 17 date.
Joseph DiSciullo. spokesman for NASA, said the
latest delay was due to a problem with the insulation
of the external fuel tank, which will feed the orbiter
Columbia's three main engines during flight and or
bit.
A cork-type material is used for insulation of the
external tank s aluminum skin. When the first fuel
ing of the tank was conducted last week, officials
found an area of about 50 square feet in the forward
section, where the tank attaches to the Columbia,
where the insulation came loose, or "de-bonded."
During flight, the panels must be firmly attached
to the tank to protect it and the fuels inside and thus
insure the engines will run properly.
Officials were trying to determine how much
further damage might be discovered or caused dur
ing a flight itself.
The winged, three-rocket Columbia is the first of
four shuttle spacecraft designed to replace the one
shot rockets currently used in the U.S. space pro
gram. Once in operation, the shuttles, which will
glide back to Earth foj- re-use, will carry satellites
into orbit and will be used for manned orbital mis
sions and various scientific experiments.
Falwell article to be in Penthouse
Lynchburg, Va. — A federal judge in Virginia yes
terday refused the request of television evangelist

Jerry Falwell that he permanently block distribu
tion of an interview with Falwell appearing in the
March issue of Penthouse, a magazine known for its
full-color photographic displays of nude women.
U.S. District Judge James Turk, turning aside
claims by Falwell, head of the conservative Moral
Majority, that the interview was obtained through
deception and would cause him irreparable harm in
the eyes of his followers, ruled that the interests of
the magazine's 10 million readers far outweigh
those of Falwell.
"The scales tip decidedly in favor of the public,"
Turk said.
Turk, who blocked distribution of the magazine
temporarily last Friday, noted yesterday morning
that expiration of that order left time for Falwell to
appeal the ruling if he desired. Falwell declined.
A spokesman for Penthouse, Rich Jachetti, said
company officials were delighted with the ruling.
"We never had any doubts," he said. "We knew we
could depend on the basic constitutional law of the
land to rule in our favor."
Publicity resulting from the suit, Jachetti said,
"could only help increase sales. I don't think we ever
expected this interview to make the media splash
that it has. I think we can thank Rev. Falwell for
that."
