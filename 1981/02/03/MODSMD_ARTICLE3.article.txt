# Help available for children of alcoholics

Alcoholism has long been considered a crippling
disease, but "not until recently have the children of
alcoholics been identified as needing help also,"
said the associate director of the Stanford Alcohol
Clinic (SAC), Dr. Stephanie Brown.
Two and a half years ago the clinic started a ther
apy program for adult children of alcoholics who
often suffer lasting trauma from growing up in a
family scarred by this disease.
Brown emphasizes that when dealing with alco
holism, "you can encounter very complicated and
serious problems, and it is very easy to over-sim
plify them." But she cited two common roads taken
by children of alcoholics.
First, there is the child who becomes a juvenile
delinquent or suffers from mental illness, spending
his childhood in and out of institutions, but who is
often not identified as the child of an alcoholic.
Second, there is the model child who does well in
school and is never singled out as having a problem.
But this child runs an equal risk of turning to alcohol
in his later life. It is to this child that Brown's clinics
are mainly geared.
According to Brown, this child may grow up to
have a successful career, but he is an overachiever
who pushes himself too hard. "His life is hollow, he
can suffer deep depressions and often have bad rela

tionships," she added.
The college student who comes from an alcoholic
background has different problems and should be
treated in separate groups, Brown said. He is fresh
out of his home environment and often has trouble
adjusting to school. He may worry constantly either
about leaving his parent home, alone and un-cared
for, or about leaving younger siblings alone and un
protected.
In any case, said Brown, "this student can go into
deep depressions, have trouble sleeping at night and
he may go home frequently." Also, many times the
student who over-burdens himself with pressure to
get good grades comes from the family of an alco
holic, she added.
There are currently three therapy groups held at
Stanford, as well as individual counseling. The par
ticipants range in age from the mid-20s to late 50s.
But according to Brown, there is a waiting list for 18
to 25 year-olds, and she would be happy to initiate a
new group in this age bracket. "Such a program
would have to be coordinated through Cowell," she
said.
The goal of this program is not to prevent alcohol
ism, said Brown, because no one knows enough
about the disease to make such a claim. Rather the
goal is "to create a forum where people can discuss
their own problems and come to terms with them

selves," she added.
The clinics provide "very intense treatment,"
continued Brown, and on the average people stay
with the program for at least one to two years.
"The same groups meet week after week," she
explained, and after a while they stop trying to be on
"their good behavior" and start acting the same as
they do in their outside l.ves.
"Then the group becomes a small laboratory
where people can examine themselves and their
problems."
Concerning the success of the therapy, Brown
said, very few people leave the clinic early, and ac
cording to the participants themselves, the groups
are a great help.
Said Brown, "There is a noticeable change for the
better in the people, their esteem is much higher and
they achieve a realistic perception of their fami
lies."
Participants share past experiences and discuss
what it was like to grow up in an alcoholic family,
but mainly they discuss themselves and their pres
ent lives, she said.
The clinic is a "learning environment," and in
volves "intense probing" into their lives.
Currently there is no other similar type of therapy
going on, according to Brown, nor is there anything
comparable at Cowell or the Bridge.

goal is "to create a forum where people can discuss
their own problems and come to terms with them

selves," she added.
The clinics provide "very intense treatment,"
continued Brown, and on the average people stay
with the program for at least one to two years.
"The same groups meet week after week," she
explained, and after a while they stop trying to be on
"their good behavior" and start acting the same as
they do in their outside l.ves.
"Then the group becomes a small laboratory
where people can examine themselves and their
problems."
Concerning the success of the therapy, Brown
said, very few people leave the clinic early, and ac
cording to the participants themselves, the groups
are a great help.
Said Brown, "There is a noticeable change for the
better in the people, their esteem is much higher and
they achieve a realistic perception of their fami
lies."
Participants share past experiences and discuss
what it was like to grow up in an alcoholic family,
but mainly they discuss themselves and their pres
ent lives, she said.
The clinic is a "learning environment," and in
volves "intense probing" into their lives.
Currently there is no other similar type of therapy
going on, according to Brown, nor is there anything
comparable at Cowell or the Bridge.
