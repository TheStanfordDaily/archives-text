# Robbery in parking lot

### Bill Beyda 
An 83-year-old old Palo Alto man
was robbed at knife point Friday night
at about 10:30 in the Tresidder pay
parking lot.
The victim, who was not identified,
said he was leaving a performance of
the Stanford Opera Theatre at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, had entered
his car and was backing out, when two
black males opened his car door, made
him get out, put a knife to his back and
demanded his wallet.
The victim said he lost $60 in cash,
but nis credit cards were found in Palo
Alto by the Palo Alto Police the next
day.
It was not until then that the victim
reported the incident.
Detective Donald Lillie of the Stan
ford Police said, "There are usually
patrolmen on foot in the White Plaza

area and they are aware of when
events end. Since the crime wasn't re
ported right away, this eliminated all
chances of blocking the thieves exit
routes, such as major campus roads."
The normal procedure, according to
Lillie, would be to alert the Palo Alto
Police to cover some of the campus
exits, while the Stanford Police would
cover most of the campus areas.
"We've always suggested you lock
your doors as soon as you're in your
car, and if someone wants something,
just open the window a crack to talk to
them," Lillie said, "Your car offers
you a lot of protection."
The robbery was unusual because it
occurred in a well lit, crowded area.
Most robberies take place in more re
mote areas, Lillie said.
The case is still under investigation
by the Stanford Police.
