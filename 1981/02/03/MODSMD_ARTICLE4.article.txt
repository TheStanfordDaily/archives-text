# U.S. ambassador White dismissed by Gen. Haig

From the Daily wire services
Washington — Robert White, the
U.S. ambassador to El Salvador who
was public "point man" for the Carter
administration's controversial Cen
tral American policy, has been re
moved from his post because of in
discreet public statements, the State
Dept. said yesterday.
White, whose confirmation for the
post was held up for weeks last year by
Senate Republicans, was recalled to
Washington for consultations last
week with Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig and was told he would be
reassigned.
White is the only career Foreign
Service ambassador to have his pro
forma Inauguration Day resignation
accepted, officials said.

All ambassadors, whether career
officials or political appointees, sub
mit resignations as a matter of cus
tom. Almost all political appointees in
ambassadorial posts have been dis
missed by the Reagan administration.
Outspokenness cause of dismissal
Officials said that White's out
■tpokenness on policy matters was the
prime cause for fils dismissal. On one
occasion he said publicly that the Rea
gan transition team's reported eager
ness to dismiss him encouraged right
wing terrorism in strife-torn El
Salvador.
More recently, White criticized ef
forts by the ruling junta in El Salvador
to find the killers of four American
missionaries whose murders in De
cember led former President Carter
to suspend military aid to the junta.
That aid, totaling $5 million a year,
was later resumed by the Carter ad
ministration and, in Carter's waning
days in office, it was increased.
White had been quoted as publicly
disputing that policy and as resisting
advice by the Defense Dept. and Cen
tral Intelligence Agency that military
aid to El Salvador be sharply in
creased and include U.S. military ad
visers.
Action 'almost unheard of'
One State Dept. official said Haig's
action was "almost unheard of" in the
protocol-conscious world of the
diplomatic bureaucracy, where ca
reer officers a new administration
wants transferred — whether for poli
cy or political reasons — generally are
given a grace period at least until they
are given a new job or until their suc
cessors have been named.
Sources said the move was also sur
prising because the top post in the
Latin America Bureau remains va
cant since former assistant secretary
for Latin American affairs William
Bowdler simultaneously announced
his retirement and was told to leave by
the Reagan team early in January.
State Department spokesman Wil
liam Dyess said that White's removal
from the post of ambassador "does not
signal a change in policy" toward the
Salvadoran junta. If anything, Dyess
said, echoing a statement bv Haig at a
news conference last week, aid to the
junta will more likely be increased
than diminished.
Crucial test area
despite continuing crises in Poland
and the Persian Gulf, Central Ameri
ca has been viewed as a crucial test
area for the new administration's for
eign policy. Under the Carter adminis
tration, the region was a focus for hu
man rights concerns and a professed
respect for "ideological pluralism"
that would enable the United States to
deal with leftist revolutionary govern
ments such as Nicaragua's Sand
inistas.
Immediately following Reagan's
election, conservative spokesmen and
advisers to the incoming adminis
tration publicly expressed their dis
agreement with Carter policy and
their concerns that Nicaragua had be
come a staging area for Cuban and So
viet expansionism in the hemisphere.
Pragmatic, innovative diplomacy
White, a former ambassador to Par
aguay and a career officer identified

both with pragmatic, innovative
diplomacy and with human rights,
was appointed to El Salvador last
spring in hopes he could manage the
difficult task of pushing the military
dominated government toward re
form while holding the line against the
left.
Both White and Pezzullo questioned
those proposals and subsequently
charged the Reagan team with "un
dermining their authority." Some
Carter spokesmen went so far as to
charge the Reaganites with endanger
ing White's life in assassination-rid
den El Salvador by labeling him a
lame duck who would be thrown out of
his job along with his policies.
White was offered reassignment as
a senior inspector in the Office of the
Insepctor General of the Foreign Ser
vice but he declined the offer, admin
istration officials said. Under Foreign
Service rules, a returning career am
bassador has 90 days to accept re
assignment or face mandatory retire
ment. White, 54, is eligible for full re
tirement benefits.
