# Strong interest in new cross disciplinary major
## Public Policy Program offers more focused study 
### Cathy Janus 
A Public Policy program designed
to help students better understand the
complexities of government and poli
cy issues is now in its second quarter.
The program, supported by a
$367,000 grant from the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, is being coordinated by
an 11-member program committee.
Five professors are teaching in the
program, while six faculty members
are serving as advisors.
This quarter's public policy classes
have an average enrollment of 60 stu
dents. Several students have declared
their intentions to major in the pro
gram.
In order to earn a degree in the pro

gram, students are required to com
plete 70 units of coursework. This in
cludes 30 units of prerequisite courses,
the 25-unit sequence of core courses,
and 15 units of post-core coursework
An optional summer internship is also
being developed.
For the final 15 units, the student
chooses an area of concentration deal
ing with public policy and justifies it
as a coherent concentration. He con
sults with his advisor from the pro
gram to develop his area of study. The
problem-focused area may deal with
an energy policy, health care, food and
nutrition policy, or the economics of
regulation. The handbook states that
students should include at least one
small seminar course involving indi

vidual research.
Because Public Policy is a new ma
jor, students must submit a proposal
to the Committee on the Individually
Designed Major for approval Accord
ing to program director Nathan Ro
senberg, new majors always go
through this committee. "The se
quence of courses and requirements
are already set up, so the major is not
individually designed. All our majors
have been approved, so going through
the committee is only a formality."
The program has been in the plan
ning stages since 1976. The core is dis
tinctive because it offers five new
courses: Politics and Public Policy,
Organizations and Public Policy,
Philosophical and Ethical Issues in

Public Policy, Economics and Public
Policy and Quantitative Methods and
Their Application in Public Policy.
New courses will be added beginning
in 1982-83.
The Public Policy program was in
stituted during the winter quarter of
last year, and was then told that
degreeâ€”granting status wouldn't be
conferred until the courses had been
taught for a full year.
Professors from various University
departments began working in 1978 to
create the program which hoped to in
tegrate courses in political science,
statistics, sociology and economics.
The growth of interest in the pro
gram since it's inception was pre

dieted by Polical Science professor
Alexander George last year when he
said, 'There's a tremendous interest
in public policy at the University '
Professor George, who was on the
organizing committee for the pro
gram stated. There is a definite need
for a program like this, which is of
high quality, very demanding, and rig
orous. And the need is growing con
stantly.'
The program is taken in conjunction
with the regular political science pro
gram of study, which includes courses
from the areas of Comparative Poli
tics, International Relations, Political
Theory. American Politics, and Pub
lic Administration and Public Policy
