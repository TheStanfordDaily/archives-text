## Japanese defend volunteer army 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo Japan's top military
officer came under political fire
yesterday for challenging the
official doctrine that a military
draft would be unconstitutional.
Gen. Goro Takeda, who also
questioned the purely defensive
military policy of the govern
ment, was criticized in the par
liament for his comments, and
socialist members demanded
that he resign.
His unusual but not un
precedented breakinjg of ranks
posed an awkward problem for
Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki,
who ordered an inquiry, and for
the civilian defense minister,
who cautioned Takeda about his
remarks.
It is rare for a unii .jd of
ficer in Japan to publicly ques
tion government policy, even in
the current climate of opinion in
which the long-taboo subjects of
defense policy and budgets are
routinely discussed.
Takeda, a World War II
fighter pilot, is chairman of the
joint staff council, which over
sees Japan's air, sea and land
self-defense forces.
Involuntary servitude
In a magazine interview
widely quoted in the daily press
Monday, Takeda objected to the
government's official position
that military conscription
would violate two articles of
Japan's constitution, one of
which prohibits involuntary
servitude.
Takeda said it is "un
bearable" for a soldier's role in
defending his country to be con
sidered akin to slavery.
The interpretation he
challenged has been established
government policy since 1970
and was restated last August
when questions about the possi
bility of a military draft were
raised in the parliament.
Volunteer force
Japan has an all-volunteer de
fense force of about 240,000
men, and it is currently under
strength because of recruiting
problems. The government has
said it could draw on a small re
serve force in an emergency but
has stressed that a draft would
be unconstitutional either in
normal times or in an emer
gency.
Takeda also questioned the
long-established doctrine that
Japan's military forces are
purely for defensive purposes
and cannot be used abroad, even
as away of defending Japan.
Such a policy makes defense dif
ficult, he said in the interview,
and warned that it could mean
Japan would, in an emergency,
have to fight on Japanese soil.
That, he added, could mean for

eign occupation of part of
Japan.
Takeda also took issue with
the government understanding
that defense expenditures will
not exceed 1 percent of the coun
try's gross national product, a
limit being abided by in the cur
rent budget. A defense budget in
the neighborhood of 3 percent
would be "meaningful," he
said.
Predecessor fired
Takeda's outspokenness re
called a similar breach of
ground rules by his predecessor,
Hiroomi Kurisu, who in 1978
suggested that his forces, under
the present constitution, would
have to resort to extra-legal
measures to respond to an at
tack on Japan. He was dis
missed.
Like Kurisu, Takeda was
criticized in the parliament for
threatening the civilian control
of the military, an issue with
strong emotional content ever
since the end of World War 11.
It is known that many high
ranking Japanese officers favor
a substantial military buildup
and a clarification of their fight
ing roles. Usually these argu
ments are carried on by civilian
leaders of the defense agency,
or by hawkish supporters in the
ruling Liberal Democratic Par
ty.
More receptive
They have been given a more
respectful hearing in the past
few years as Japan worried
about the U.S. military commit
ment in Asia and a Soviet
buildup in the Far East. The re
ceptivity to pro-military argu
ments has grown since the Sovi
et invasion of Afghanistan.
Takeda responded to press in
quiries by saying he was only
speaking his personal opinions
and emphasizing that he was not
proposing a military draft,
merely questioning the govern
ment's rationale in finding one
unconstitutional.
His right to express private
views was supported in the par
liamentary questioning by his
civilian boss, Joji Omura, direc
tor-general of the defense agen
cy. However, Omura also said
that because of his high posi
tion, Takeda should exercise
prudence in public remarks.
Socialist Party leaders de
manded that Takeda be dis
missed, calling his remarks a
challenge to civilian control of
the military. The Socialists and
other minority parties are wag
ing a campaign through parlia
mentary questioning to get the
government to publicly state
limits to Japan's military ex
pansion.
