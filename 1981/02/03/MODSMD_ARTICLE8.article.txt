### Los Angeles Times 
Bangkok, Thailand Chinese
Premier Zhao Ziyang warned
Sunday that U.S.-China rela
tions will suffer if the Reagan
administration moves too close
to Nationalist Taiwan.
Relations between the two
countries have developed satis
factorily since they recognized
each other two years ago, and
China hopes that this will con
tinue under the Reagan presi
dency, Zhao told a press con
ference.
"What is clear is that Taiwan
is part of China and cannot be
separated from China," Zhao
said, "and the People's Re
public is the only legal govern
ment of China."
That principle, the 61-year
old premier continued, "must
be strictly and firmly observed.
Any damage to this principle
will set back U.S.-China rela
tions."
Zhao's words, while not new,
were rather more restrained
than previous warnings to the
United States against upgrading
its relations with Taiwan at the
expense of China. President
Reagan is a longtime supporter
of the Nationalist regime on
Taiwan.
Meeting
Making his first trip to south
east Asia since becoming pre
mier, Zhao flew to the northern
Thai city of Chiangmai Sunday
for a meeting with King
Bhumibol Adulyadej before re
turning to Beijing yesterday.
The Vietnamese military oc
cupation of Kampuchea domi
nated talks between Zhao,
Prime Minister Prem
Tinsulanonda and other top Thai
officials. Zhao was accom
panied on his four-day visit by
Foreign Minister Huang Hua.
Zhao reiterated China's
pledge to come to Thailand's as

sistance in the event of a Viet
namese invasion, but appeared
to hedge on that commitment
when he said what action China
would take depended on con
sultations with Thailand.
Stooge
He accused Vietnam of serv
ing as a stooge for Soviet Union
hegemonism in southeast Asia.
If Vietnam would only withdraw
its troops from Kampuchea and
Laos, stop trying to expand its
influence in southeast Asia, and
stop serving as a military base
for Soviet expansion to the
south, Zhao said, the two coun
tries could have good relations
immediately.
The Chinese leader restated
China's support for the fallen
Pol Pot Khmer Rouge, which he
pointed out is still recognized as
the legal government of Kam
puchea by the United Nations.
He said that China would sup
port either Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the exiled former
ruler of Kampuchea now living
in North Korea, or Son Sann, a
respected former prime min
ister, as the leader of a united
front against the Vietnamese
and the Hanoi-backed Heng
Samrin government in Phnom
Penh.
Sihanouk keeps saying that he
is not interested. Son Sann, who
divided his time between Paris
and Kampuchea, has neither the
following nor the guns to pose a
serious threat to Phnom Penh.
Zhao's visit came at a time
when many Thais were private
ly convinced that Thailand had
moved too close to Beijingat the
expense of its relations with
Moscow since the Vietnam con
quest of Kampuchea. A split on
the issue developed within the
Thai Foreign Ministry three
months ago when Prime Min
ister Prem paid a state visit to
China.
