# 'Phony,' says opposition
## Botha calls early elections in South Africa 
### Associated Press 
Johannesburg, South Africa South Africa is gear
ing up for what is expected to be its roughest national
election in years. But there is virtually no doubt that the
National Party, which has been in power for more than
three decades, will win it.
The tiny, fractionalized opposition has dubbed the
April 29 balloting the "phony election" because the real
contest will come before the votes are cast in the Na
tional Party caucuses that will nominate candidates for
the House of Assembly's 165 seats.
The outcome of that intra-party fight between Prime
Minister P.W. Botha's moderate wing and his ultra
rightist opponents will decide whether South Africa
continues its cautious steps toward some sort of accom
modation between the 4.5 million whites and the 20 mil
lion blacks or takes a sharp right turn.
Perilous future
Though Botha has made clear he would never ad
vocate a political system based on one man, one vote,
he has been telling whites since he became prime min
ister Sept. 28, 1978, that they must ease the lot of the

blacks or face a perilous future.
But hardline Nationals, led by Andries P. Treurnicht,
minister of state administration and statistics, want no
tampering with the rigid policies of racial segregation
imposed when the National Party first took power in
1948.
Most South African blacks view the upcoming elec
tion as irrelevant because they don't have the right to
vote. They tend to see Botha's reforms as window
dressing for the outside world and say they won't be sat
isfied until the whole edifice of apartheid is dismantled.
Early announcement
Botha would not have to call an election until 1983.
But faced with the burgeoning split in his party, he an
nounced the early election in Parliament last Wednes
day, saying he was placing himself and his government
"in the hands of the country with faith."
By announcing in the same speech that a Soviet spy
had been apprehended in South Africa, the prime min
ister immediately stole some of the rightists' thunder

by making the major theme of his campaign the conten
tion that communists are a threat to South Africa.
Within two days of the election announcement, South
African commandos raided Mozambique, a neighbor
ing Marxist-governed country, allegedly to wipe out a
sanctuary of black nationalist guerrillas fighting to top
ple the white-minority government here.
Economic reasons
Besides riding a wave of anti-communist sentiment
at least among whites Botha had economic rea
sons for calling an April election.
Some political observers predicted it would be an op
portune time for Botha to seek a new five-year mandate
because the economy is riding an unprecedented boom
spurred by the production of about $13.5 billion worth
of gold in 1980.
Economic problems loom, such as an annual infla
tion rate of 15.8 percent and critical shortage of skilled
manpower, but they are not expected to bite hard until
after the votes are counted.
