## 
### Brad Crystal 
Former presidential candidate and
ten-term Illinois congressman John
Anderson agreed in writing yesterday
to teach two political science courses
here spring quarter.
The announcement came after a
special meeting at the Pasadena
Hilton between Anderson and mem
bers of the ASSU Guest Professorship
Board
Although the Political Science De
partment has not yet formally ap
proved the course outline, which An
derson submitted yesterday, ac
creditation is expected.
According to the arrangements
ironed out yesterday, Anderson would
teach one open-enrollment lecture
course, focusing ori the legislative
process, and one seminar on the future
of the two party system, open only to
advanced undergraduates and gradu

ates. Anderson has no prior formal
teaching experience.
His salary would include $5000 from
the ASSU Guest Professorship Board,
$3500 from the Stanford Committee on
Political Education (SCOPE), and
$250 from the History Department, as
well as possible additional funding
from political science.
Members of. the board said the
SCOPE funding was especially help
ful.
"We wanted to make sure we could
help make this possible by being a ma
jor contributor," SCOPE director Jeff
Menath said.
Anderson may also win a $2000 grant
from the Dickinson Symposium Fund
should he appear in a series of four
panel discussions on topics of politi
cal, social and economic concern. He
has already agreed to participate.
Official ASSU Senate approval of

the $5000 Guest Professorhip Board al
location should come at the senate's
next meeting on Feb 11, according to
Sen Bobby Lapin. who has served as
liaison to the board
In accepting the board's offer, An
derson wrote to Political Science
Prof David Abernethy:
"I have just finished talking to
Steve Richardson, Dick Butterfield
and Luke Cole of the Guest Pro
fessorship Board. Through their very
persuasive efforts I have concluded
that I would like to accept..."
Anderson told the Daily the objec
tive of his course would be to "trans
late the last 20 years of my life into
some kind of meaningful expression
that will not only stimulate interest on
the part of the student body in an
academic way but also . . . generate a
desire for reform."
He said he hopes he can "elicit new
and fresh thinking on the part of stu
dents that could be translated into
change."
During the presidential campaign,
Anderson was a popular figure on col
lege campuses, where he was con
sidered a maverick thinker, unafraid
to outspokenly express his views. Last
February he gained attention for
openly advocating gun control while
speaking before a hostile audience in
New Hampshire.
His warm reception when he spoke
here last April was confirmed by his
first place finish in the Stanford mock
election, in which he polled 42.5
percent of the student vote.
One week later, in the national elec
tion, Anderson did not fare as well,
however, garnering just 7 percent of
the popular vote.
Since the election. Anderson said he
has been speaking at college cam
puses across the country. He is sched

uled to give a lecture tonight at Oc
cidental College in Los Angeles.
Under the plan worked out by the
Guest Professorship Board. Anderson
will live at the home of Psychology
Profs. Harriet and Walter Mischel on
Mavfield Avenue. Rent will be $1000 a
month The four-bedroom house, de
signed by a disciple of Frank Lloyd
Wright, features a solar-heated swim
ming pool and a jacuzzi.
The Mischels will be in New York
City during spring quarter, teaching
and conducting research at New York
University.
Anderson would be on campus Mon
days through Wednesdays throughout
the quarter, spending the rest of the
week in Illinois where is committed to
a series of television interviews. At
this time. Anderson is unsure whether
he will bring his family to Stanford.
He is eager to make himself avail
able for sherry hours, and visits to
dorms, according to Cole.
The large lecture course, tentative
ly entitled "The Legislative Process,"
would meet on Mondays and Wednes
days. preferably at 1:15 in one of the
more spacious auditoriums, Rich
ardson said.
"Anderson would like to teach in the
afternoons to maximize the number of
students able take the course," But
terfield said.
Kresge and Memorial Auditorium
are the two places the Guest Pro
fessorship Board would most like to
have, according to members.
Reaction to the Anderson appoint
ment was enthusiastic.
"The campus will be intellectually
a more lively place because of his
presence," said Political Science
Prof. David Danelski, who will serve


John Anderson
