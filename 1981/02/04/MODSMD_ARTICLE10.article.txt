# Seen as tainted symbol of old American policies
## Kissinger's visit to Mid- East fails 
### Los Angeles Times 
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia — Hen
ry Kissinger, who bedazzled the
Arab world with his imposing
personality and diplomatic
sleights of hand in the
mid-19705, has lost his charm
with the powerful kings and
presidents who once warmly
greeted him as America's pre
mier policy and peacemaker.
His latest trip to tfie Middle
East, where he made it clear he
would be reporting his findings
to President Ronald Reagan al
though it was a "private" vaca
tion, was largely seen here as a
flop and served to create con
siderable anxiety here .
(Kissinger met Monday with
Reagan at the White House for a
half hour in a meeting that had
not been publicly announced to
give his view of the trip, made in
late December and early Janu
ary. The White House released
no details of the meeting.)
King Hussein of Jordan,
whom Kissinger long touted in

Washington as an old friend, re
fused to allow him into his coun
try. Saudi Arabia's Crown
Prince Fahd, the real power of
this kingdom, would not receive
him, according to reliable
sources here and in Washington,
although an aide to Kissinger in
sisted the two had met.
President Anwar Sadat of
Egypt, for his part, took polite
but direct issue with Kissinger's
notion that it was time to in
clude the Jordanian monarch in
the Camp David talks.
For the most part, Kissinger
was viewed in the Arab world as
the harbinger of bad news and
the symbol of past American
policies that have become tat
tered and tainted with time and
led so far only to a separate
peace between Israel and
Egypt
Furthermore, the ambiguity
surrounding his standing in the
Reagan administration unset
tled many of his old Arab friends
and acquaintances. Washing
ton's key Arab allies — Egypt,

Saudi Arabia and Jordan — are
exceedingly nervous about the
new administration. They are at
once fearful about the meaning
of Reagan's pro-Israeli cam
paign statements, hopeful, out
side Cairo at least, that Reagan
will break with the Camp David
peace process, and anxious to
get going on the right foot with
him, if at all possible.
Thus, the Saudis, the Jor
danians and even Sadat seemed
eager to demonstrate their dis
tance from Kissinger and their
openness to a new approach
from a Republican adminis
tration that, unlike Jimmy
Carter's foreign policy team,
will not have to keep looking
over its shoulder in fear of being
zapped by Kissinger from the
right on matters like strategic
arms limitation or the Panama
Canal. The Arab leaders
seemed to be acting as if Kissin
ger had suddenly become irrele
vant, in at least the opening
phases of Reagan's presidency.
Moreover, Arab officials

were puzzled by Kissinger's
traveling the Middle East in the
private jet of Columbia Broad
casting System chief executive
William Paley along with Paley
and Brooke Astor, a socialite
and close associate of Kissin
ger's wife Nancy. Kissinger is
reported to have suggested in
some conversations that the trip
was largely his wife's idea.
William Hyland. an aide to
Kissinger, said in Washington
Monday that Kissinger had
made clear that "it was a
private trip" and that "he
wasn't there to negotiate any
thing or to persuade anybody
about anything.'' Hyland added
that "the facts of life are that it
is very hard for Henry Kissinger
to travel without being thought
of as representing a Republican
administration."
Hyland said Kissinger had
discussed the trip in advance
with Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.),
who then "checked with Rea
