# Wang's pleasing problem of growth
## 
### Washington Post 
Lowell, Mass.— To hear a lot
of people these days, American
business is deep in trouble. The
auto and steel industries are in a
slump. The U.S. is falling behind
on new technology. Competitive
spirit is on the wane.
Not at Wang Laboratories,
Inc.
While some U.S. firms may
be fighting desperately to stay
alive, the big problem at Wang
is how to slow the company's ex
plosive — and admittedly un
manageable — growth pace.
Since 1977 the Lowell-based
computermaker has been grow
ing at an average 67 percent an
nual rate — a staggering pace
that company executives con
cede is "unsustainable" and
must be arrested in the next two
or three years.
Wang's expansion has been so
rapid, it's spawned serious new
problems in managing per
sonnel and resources. There al
ready are complaints about ser
vice snags. And the firm is con
tinually looking for new plants
in which to locate new plants.
The company's own advances
in new technology are pushing it
into a far larger market, wi^h
the prospect that Wang will now
have to face new , more threat
ening competition from such
giants as IBM.
To top that off, the changes
come at a time when An Wang,
the 60-year-old computer genius
who founded the firm in 1951, is
beginning to ease himself grad
ually out of the driver's seat.
The question now is, will cor
porate managers be able to slow
the company's growth suc
cessfully from the current dizzy
pace? And how well will the cor
poration fare after An Wang
finally steps down?
"It's mathematically im
possible for them to grow at that
rate, and I don't think the mar
ketplace is going to give them a
chance," says Ulrich Weil, vice
president and analyst at Morgan
Stanley and Co., the New York
investment house.
Here at Wang's ultramodern

corporate headquarters — a 14
story glass and concrete towere
in Lowell's new industrial park
— the company's phenomenal
growth pace is evident at every
turn.
The work force — now at
13,500, up from only 1,000 just 10
years ago — is conspicuously
youthful. "I'm sort of a veter
an," boasts one corporate guide
now in her late 20s who joined
the firm four years ago.
And the physical plant is
brimming over. Officials con
cede the headquarters building,
still in the final stages of com
pletion, already is too crowded,
and the firm just broke ground
for a third big manufacturing
plant here.
Wang's frenetic growth, and
that of other high-technology
firms here, has spawned an eco
nomic renaissance for the en
tire New England region, which
had slumped badly following the
decline of its textile and foot
wear industries.
The result has been thousands
of new jobs and — for the first
time in recent memory — a re
versal of the region's traditional
suffering during time of re
cession. In the 1980 slump. New
England virtually was unaf
fected.
Moreover, virtually all of
these firms still are growing
rapidly, leading industry
analysts to project at least a
modest continuation in job
growth for several more years.
Wang's basic business is es
sentially in four fields:
-Word-processing equip
ment: Wang is the nation's larg
est manufacturer of cathode
ray-tube word-processing sys
tems — combination type
writer-and-TV-set devices used
for composing and writing let
ters or manuscripts.
-Small-business computers;
The Lowell company is second
only to IBM in production of rel
atively inexpensive business

computers, priced at $25,000 or
less, primarily for first-time
users and small- and medium
sized firms.
-Desk-top calculators and
computers intended mainly for
reserach engineering and scien
tific computations. Wang also
manufactures computer soft
ware. the programs and pro
cedures needed to make com
puters to their jobs.
—Complex integrated in
formation systems that com

bine data-processing, word
processing, printing and elec
tronic mail and message ser
vices in a single package. In this
field, too, Wang is the nations's
leader.
Today, Wang Laboratories
Inc., competes feverishly with a
dozen major computer makers,
including Burroughs, Digital
Equipment. Data General.
Hewlett-Packard, IBM. Xerox,
NCR, Exxon and Lanier Busi
ness Products.
