# 'Regulated and regularized mass murder'
## Historian decrys Nazi annihilation of Jews 
### Lucy Goldenhersh 
The extermination of six mil
lion Jews stands apart from oth
er World War II casualties, "not
because of the distinctive fate
or suffering of individuals, but
because of the unique intent of
the murderers and effect upon
the murdered." historian Lucy
Dawidowicz told a crowd of
over 200 at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium Sunday.
Dawidowicz, a scholar of
Jewish civilization and current
ly a visiting professor at Stan
ford, said that Hitler's annihila
tion of Jews is often glibly
equated with any other atrocity.
"Such attempts to universalize
Jewish suffering blur the dis
tinctiveness of the Jewish faith
and obscure the role of anti
semitism in accomplishing
those murders," the scholar
warned.
Dawidowicz cited the fre
quent argument for univer
salism: "Why. it is asked,
should the Jews be singled out
from statistics of millions that
were killed during World War
II?" World War II death and suf
fering was not confined merely
to Jews.
Figures alone cannot support
the distinction. Dawidowicz

pointed out. Of the 35 to 50 mil
lion killed during World War 11,
the Soviet Union suffered heav
iest losses — a total of 18 mil
lion, only 1.5 million of these
being Jews. Poland ranks next
on the list of heavy casualties,
followed by Yugoslavia,
Greece. France and the rest of
Western Europe.
Yet, figures alone cannot re
veal the effect or intent behind
the murders. "Though the Sovi
et Union suffered greater losses
than the Jews in actual figures,
no nation or people anywhere
lost the main body of its popu
lation at the fountainhead of its
cultural experience," claimed
Dawidowicz. "No other people
were chosen for total extinc
tion."

The intent behind this distinc
tion is not to minimize the suf
fering incurred by non-Jewish
victims of bomb raids, prison
camps or gas chambers,
Dawidowicz said. These
murders were "means to a
practical end" — that of Ger
man mastery over Europe.
"Yet the murder of Jews was
not a byproduct of the war," the
historian said, "but an end in
itself — an ultimate goal. "
Those who equate the de
struction of Japanese in
Hiroshima with the destruction
of Jews in Europe fail to see the
above distinction, said
Dawidowicz. The U.S. decided
to use the bomb against Japan to
demonstrate military superior
ity, not to annihilate the

Japanese race.
According to the historian,
holocaust murders proved
unique in effect as well as in
tent. Hitler's regime produced
no major transformation of so
ciety like those caused by com
munist revolutions in Russia
and China.
Rather, the major legacy of
the regime lies in the scattered
ruins of Europaan death camps,
and the "destroyed continuity or
Jewish history." The crumbled
remains of Auschwitz, a one
time concentration camp, serve
as reminders of a past that
"eclipsed man's vision of hell."
Today Auschwitz emerges as
a universal symbol for evil, an
interpretation that in

Dawidowicz's view, marks a de
parture from historical reality.
' The evil was not ecumenical
The killing was not bloodlust,"
declared the historian, "but.
rather, directed against certain
individuals."
The annihilation of six million
Jews, a unique attempt at
eliminating an entire race, may
well be a "special Jewish sor
row." Yet Hitler's method
alone — one* Da wido wicz calls
"regulated and regularized
mass murder" — is enough to
instill fear in men of all re
ligions. Never before had man
employed scientific and bureau
cratic methods to attain such
destructive ends, reaching what
the historian termed a "terrify
ing juncture."

to Jews.
Figures alone cannot support
the distinction. Dawidowicz

pointed out. Of the 35 to 50 mil
lion killed during World War 11,
the Soviet Union suffered heav
iest losses — a total of 18 mil
lion, only 1.5 million of these
being Jews. Poland ranks next
on the list of heavy casualties,
followed by Yugoslavia,
Greece. France and the rest of
Western Europe.
Yet, figures alone cannot re
veal the effect or intent behind
the murders. "Though the Sovi
et Union suffered greater losses
than the Jews in actual figures,
no nation or people anywhere
lost the main body of its popu
lation at the fountainhead of its
cultural experience," claimed
Dawidowicz. "No other people
were chosen for total extinc
tion."

The intent behind this distinc
tion is not to minimize the suf
fering incurred by non-Jewish
victims of bomb raids, prison
camps or gas chambers,
Dawidowicz said. These
murders were "means to a
practical end" — that of Ger
man mastery over Europe.
"Yet the murder of Jews was
not a byproduct of the war," the
historian said, "but an end in
itself — an ultimate goal. "
Those who equate the de
struction of Japanese in
Hiroshima with the destruction
of Jews in Europe fail to see the
above distinction, said
Dawidowicz. The U.S. decided
to use the bomb against Japan to
demonstrate military superior
ity, not to annihilate the

Japanese race.
According to the historian,
holocaust murders proved
unique in effect as well as in
tent. Hitler's regime produced
no major transformation of so
ciety like those caused by com
munist revolutions in Russia
and China.
Rather, the major legacy of
the regime lies in the scattered
ruins of Europaan death camps,
and the "destroyed continuity or
Jewish history." The crumbled
remains of Auschwitz, a one
time concentration camp, serve
as reminders of a past that
"eclipsed man's vision of hell."
Today Auschwitz emerges as
a universal symbol for evil, an
interpretation that in

Dawidowicz's view, marks a de
parture from historical reality.
' The evil was not ecumenical
The killing was not bloodlust,"
declared the historian, "but.
rather, directed against certain
individuals."
The annihilation of six million
Jews, a unique attempt at
eliminating an entire race, may
well be a "special Jewish sor
row." Yet Hitler's method
alone — one* Da wido wicz calls
"regulated and regularized
mass murder" — is enough to
instill fear in men of all re
ligions. Never before had man
employed scientific and bureau
cratic methods to attain such
destructive ends, reaching what
the historian termed a "terrify
ing juncture."
