## U.S. to repeat Iran mistakes 
### 
The hostages are home and
America is having its catharsis
in an orgy of hatred for the Ira
nians. All during the 14 month
affair we saw newscasts of Ira
nians with fists raised denounc
ing the U.S. Now that it is safe to
do so, both Jimmy Carter and
President' Ronald Reagan are
calling the Iranians
"barbarians." The major news
stations never seriously at
tempted to look at the issue
from the Iranian perspective to
find out why we found ourselves
in such a mess If the question
were raised, it was usually an
swered by pointing to recent
tactical errors, including not
heeding the CIA by providing
enough security for the embassy
and by permitting the Shah in
the country. It was assumed
that the hostage-taking was just
the act of a few irrational mili
tants who somehow or other
managed to capture the support
of the masses.
In the current surge of Ameri
can self-righteousness, it is un
likely that there will be much
discussion of the fact that the
U.S.-backed military and the
CIA ran Iran for the past several
decades, primarily for the
steady supply of cheap oil which
it afforded us. We conveniently
put out of our minds the torture
and murder of thousands of Ira
nians to maintain our "strategic
position." Now. pious, pride
miffed, we festoon ourselves in
yellow ribbons and wonder how
the Iranians could be so
barbarous as to take Americans
hostage and demand that in ex
change we return the Shah's
wealth and agree not to in
terfere in that country's affairs
again.
What is more disturbing, how
ever. is that we are continuing
our old Iranian-style policies in
other parts of the world, most
notably in El Salvador. In the in
terests of "our security in the
region" we are propping up a
junta which represents the in
terests of essentially 14 interna

tionally-connected families
with favorable views toward the
U.S. So far. some 10.000 people
have been killed to maintain
that government. It is absolute
ly certain that a popular revolu
tion would have taken place long
ago were it not for mass in
fusions of U.S. military as
sistance to the government We
don't need to send in "our
boys,'' as we did in Vietnam;
it's much cleaner simply to fi
nance the operation.
I am not anxious to see the
U.S.S R. take over imperialist
policies where we have left off.
The Salvadorians should rule El
Salvador Am I really so naive in
thinking that the U.S. could
stand up and say that we cannot
support a regime which is so
clearly against the interests of
the masses, let history take its
course by permitting a popular
government to take over, and
then stand ready to offer re
construction aid to any govern
ment which is serious in work
ing toward democratic ideals?

After all. is this not more in line
with our rhetoric? Even from a
strictly pragmatic viewpoint,
would it not be cheaper to gain
allies by supporting govern
ments working in the best in
terests of their people than by
continuing a costly stream of
military aid to keep a few des
pots in power?
The U.S. is refusing to learn
from the experience with Iran.
A government with no popular
support will fall sooner or later,
U.S. interests and U.S. aid not
withstanding. Once the brutal
U.S.-backed Salvadorian junta
is overthrown. Americans will
once again be baffled at the
animosity toward this country
which is sure to be displayed.
America is celebrating to
day: it thinks that the hostage
crisis is over. If we continue
pursuing short-sighted and nar
row interests, the hostage crisis
will be only the beginning.

nians. All during the 14 month
affair we saw newscasts of Ira
nians with fists raised denounc
ing the U.S. Now that it is safe to
do so, both Jimmy Carter and
President' Ronald Reagan are
calling the Iranians
"barbarians." The major news
stations never seriously at
tempted to look at the issue
from the Iranian perspective to
find out why we found ourselves
in such a mess If the question
were raised, it was usually an
swered by pointing to recent
tactical errors, including not
heeding the CIA by providing
enough security for the embassy
and by permitting the Shah in
the country. It was assumed
that the hostage-taking was just
the act of a few irrational mili
tants who somehow or other
managed to capture the support
of the masses.
In the current surge of Ameri
can self-righteousness, it is un
likely that there will be much
discussion of the fact that the
U.S.-backed military and the
CIA ran Iran for the past several
decades, primarily for the
steady supply of cheap oil which
it afforded us. We conveniently
put out of our minds the torture
and murder of thousands of Ira
nians to maintain our "strategic
position." Now. pious, pride
miffed, we festoon ourselves in
yellow ribbons and wonder how
the Iranians could be so
barbarous as to take Americans
hostage and demand that in ex
change we return the Shah's
wealth and agree not to in
terfere in that country's affairs
again.
What is more disturbing, how
ever. is that we are continuing
our old Iranian-style policies in
other parts of the world, most
notably in El Salvador. In the in
terests of "our security in the
region" we are propping up a
junta which represents the in
terests of essentially 14 interna

tionally-connected families
with favorable views toward the
U.S. So far. some 10.000 people
have been killed to maintain
that government. It is absolute
ly certain that a popular revolu
tion would have taken place long
ago were it not for mass in
fusions of U.S. military as
sistance to the government We
don't need to send in "our
boys,'' as we did in Vietnam;
it's much cleaner simply to fi
nance the operation.
I am not anxious to see the
U.S.S R. take over imperialist
policies where we have left off.
The Salvadorians should rule El
Salvador Am I really so naive in
thinking that the U.S. could
stand up and say that we cannot
support a regime which is so
clearly against the interests of
the masses, let history take its
course by permitting a popular
government to take over, and
then stand ready to offer re
construction aid to any govern
ment which is serious in work
ing toward democratic ideals?

After all. is this not more in line
with our rhetoric? Even from a
strictly pragmatic viewpoint,
would it not be cheaper to gain
allies by supporting govern
ments working in the best in
terests of their people than by
continuing a costly stream of
military aid to keep a few des
pots in power?
The U.S. is refusing to learn
from the experience with Iran.
A government with no popular
support will fall sooner or later,
U.S. interests and U.S. aid not
withstanding. Once the brutal
U.S.-backed Salvadorian junta
is overthrown. Americans will
once again be baffled at the
animosity toward this country
which is sure to be displayed.
America is celebrating to
day: it thinks that the hostage
crisis is over. If we continue
pursuing short-sighted and nar
row interests, the hostage crisis
will be only the beginning.
