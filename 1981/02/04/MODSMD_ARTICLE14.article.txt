# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Mike Charlson and Dan Fiduccia Value of repairs dubious at times 
### 
Max Mazenko's comments on
Santa Teresa Street (Daily, Jan.
21), in which he defends recent
repairs to the road, indicate a
serious misreading of a column
one of us wrote the week before.
The point of Mike Char lson's
first article was that the Plan
ning Office, among other Uni
versity organizations, at times
wastes money on projects of
dubious value.
We stand by this opinion — de
spite Mazenko's rather personal
attack on that column.
Mazenko. for example, claims
Charlson had a number of "fac
tual errors" in his column.
There was one error, but the
width of the street was irrele
vant. Mazenko correctly points
out that it was narrowed in two
places — just enough to meet
the apparent Planning Office re
quirement for removal of a cou
ple of parking places for every

street-related project.
The remaining issues which
Mazenko calls errors are not er
rors at all. It is simply incorrect
to call a statement of opinion a
factual error. Moreover,
Mazenko mistook several clear
ly facetious remarks as
statements of fact.
As far as the program to up
grade the Press Courtyard is
concerned, we can only speak of
what we see — a filthy area full
of garbage, pallets, dumpsters.
and five feet of water. Others
may disagree, but to open that
eyesore to public view was a
mistake.
But these are petty issues.
The main point is that the Uni
versity often wastes money,
much of it paid by tuition.
We reiterate that many of the
projects mentioned have ad
mirable, necessary objectives.
There is no question that Santa

Teresa Street needed repaving.
Our gripe is that money is spent
well above and beyond what is
needed to complete the neces
sary, or even aesthetically de
sirable work.
It appears to us that the Plan
ning Office is often behind some
of the most egregious misap
propriations of funds. And many
of the expenditures appear nec
essary only to correct problems
created when that office de
cided to "improve" something.
Consider the evolution of eve
ryone's favorite traffic-control
device, the bollard. They began
innocently enough as simple
white poles, ugly, functional and
occasionally visible at night.
Now they have progressed into
wooden and even concrete
forms.
They are popping up every
where now, in such unexpected
places as median strips around
Campus Drive. And they now
have chains between them, link
ing them together as eternal
symbols of waste.
According to Mazenko
himself, those poles cost be
tween $50 and $300 each. (The
chains, incidentally, are extra.)
But why dwell on the present?
Let's recap a few past Planning
Office "improvements" and see
if bollards and Santa Teresa
Street are just isolated boondog
gles.
—The proposed Lomita Dr.
extension. After moving
fraternity houses and switching
the names of Campus Dr. and
Mayfield Ave., the University
determined it had created a
traffic and safety problem
through the Row.
Six years later it proposed
spending more than a quarter of
a million dollars to close off
Mayfield at Campus and put a
road through the parking lots of
the houses around Lake
Lagunita. (The Planning Office
believes in getting the most out
of parking lots — witness the
Stanford Shopping Center.) In
terestingly, this new street
would itself be closed once Cam
pus Drive West was completed.
Fortunately, then-President
Richard Lyman put an end to
that idea
—The Lagunita Parking Lot.
After construction of Forsythe
Hall, the University needed
more parking on the west side of
campus. Despite adamant pro
tests from residents of Lagunita
Court, the University spent an

other quarter of a million
dollars building the lot adjacent
to the dorm.
When the University hired
consultants to plan the new stu
dent residence to be built west
of Lagunita, their first recom
mendation was to remove the
parking lot because, as
Lagunita residents had said
before the lot construction, the
asphalt ruined the environment
the consultants thought Stan
ford wanted to create with its
dorm, (The plan to remove the
lot was shelved temporarily,
however, since some believed
there might be flack over de
stroying a $220,000 lot after only
three years of life.)
— Storke Building-Press
Area. The University has seen
fit to put virtually all
media organizations into one
square block. Unfortunately,
the idea that such groups might
need easy street access (to load
and unload books and news
papers) and excellent fire pro
tection (the area is nothing but
chemicals, paper, and elec
trical equipment) has not yet
been comprehended in other
quarters of the University.
For example, when the Term
an Center was under construc
tion, the area could not be
reached by fire equipment. (The
fire marshall was quite sur
prised to find the University had
misinformed him of the location
of an access fence. It's actual
position made fighting any fire
there virtually impossible.)
Finally, at the intersection of
Santa Teresa and Lomita Dr.,
there still remains a patch of
asphalt which was supposed to
be a loading zone for the Storke
Building. The patch has never
been used by Storke because,
upon completion, it was im
mediately blocked off by
bollards.
Please don't misunderstand.
We have nothing against the
Planning Office per se And it's
not that we think the Planning
Office alone is responsible for
all, or even a large fraction, of
the waste of money here. But
let's put it this way: Mazenko
certainly shouldn't be issuing
any "Golden Fleece" awards
for waste, given the track re
cord of his organization.
