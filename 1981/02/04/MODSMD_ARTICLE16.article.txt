## South Africa: pawn in East- West political chess game 
### 
Before 1976, the trouble with
U.S. foreign policy toward
Africa and other continents and
nations was that it had been tied
too closely to grand strategy
and to the perceived immediate
exigencies of thwarting Soviet
power with too little thought
about either the indigenous
needs of the people affected by
U.S. policy or about the long
term interest of this country.
U.S. policy has been all too
quick to commit any injustice ir.
the name of anti-communism.
The Soviet menace has loomed
so large that all other policy
considerations have been
treated as secondary in im
portance.

It would have been far wiser
for the U.S. to have followed a
policy in support of black ma
jorities in southern Africa from
the beginning, a policy opposed
to colonial interests and against
white minority regimes — a pol
icy consistent with the ex
pressed values of the U.S., of the
expressed concern for the fun
damental values of equality and
liberty, fairness and justice — a
policy tied to an essential hu
manitarian concern for the wel
fare of all people — than to have
used Africa as a pawn in power
politics.
There is little doubt that had
the U.S. followed the right poli
cy from the start, this country's

motives would not be so much in
question as they are today. Fif
teen years ago most Africans
viewed the U.S. revolution as
their model and hope. Now the
U.S. is viewed with incredulity.
Until 1976, until the aftermath
of the shameful policy in Angola
made clear that the U.S. could
no longer approach Africa as it
had before, foreign policy had
been guided by National Secur
ity Council Memorandum 39.
which essentially said that the
white minority governments
were here to stay in Southern
Africa and that African policy
should seek accomodation with
those governments in the in
terest of political stability, eco

nomic prosperity and, most im
portantly, the strategic global
balance of power.
Not until 1976 did U.S. foreign
policy change to favor peaceful
transition to majority rule in
southern Africa. This was only
after the Soviet Union and Cuba
were camped on southern
Africa's doorstep. It seems this
new-found interest in black ma
jority rule was based upon the
spectre of cgmmunist expans
ion, rather than on human
itarian concerns of millions of
oppressed people in Zimbabwe,
Namibia, and Azania (South
Africa.) So, in 1976, the U.S.
began following the right policy,
but still for the wrong reasons.
During Jimmy Carter s brief
occupancy of the White House,
U.S. foreign policy was shaped
to make a commitment to ma
jority rule and to embrace the
concept of "human rights." The
Carter administration played a
critical role in Zimbabwe's
transition to majority rule last
year.
Now world attention focuses
on South Africa. As apartheid
intensifies, so does resistance to
this system of white supremacy
and racial separation. The role
the U.S. plays in the enfolding
South African struggle becomes
increasingly critical to peace
and justice in the southern tip of
the African continent.
Two weeks ago, the Reagan
administration moved into
Washington, bringing with it
some of Stanford's own Hoover
Fellows who, either directly or
indirectly, will help shape a new
U.S. foreign policy.
Will 1981 see the end of "hu
man rights'' as a major plank in
U.S. foreign policy? Will the
Reagan administration develop
even closer ties with the Southe
African government? What role
will the American people play in
shaping foreign policy?
As part of Black Liberation
Month, the South Africa Solidar
ity Committee has organized a
symposium which will bring the
community together to examine
the role of the American people
and the Reagan administration
in shaping foreign policy toward
South Africa. The symposium is
entitled. "U.S. Foreign Policy
Toward South Africa: A Critical
Analysis for the 80 s," and will
be held tomorrow at 7 p.m. in
Bishop Auditorium.
The symposium will allow the
community to analyze and

critique shifts from the Carter
to the Reagan foreign policy,
scrutinize the role of Stanford in
relation to the new adminis
tration and to South Africa,
identify and discuss the role of
the American people in shaping
foreign policy, and most
critically, raise the issue of the
participation of blacks and oth
er oppressed nationalities (who
historically have not had a great
deal of input into foreign policy
and other public policy matters)
in determining foreign policy
toward South Africa.
Questions to be raised and
analyzed by the symposium in
clude:
Will the U.S. make a clear
commitment to majority rule
for its own sake?
Will the U.S. make clear an
intention not to be involved mili
tarily, directly or indirectly,
covertly or overtly, in any war
that might occur in South
Africa? Will the U.S. make it
clear that its global interests of
frustrating Soviet power do not
extend to supporting oppressive
minorities in a race war in
southern Africa?
If Israel, Great Britain and
France continue to supply South
Africa with arms, what should
the U.S. response be?
By 1976 some three hundred
U.S. corporations had invested
more than $1.6 billion in South
Africa. Since profits for Ameri
can companies in South Africa
are higher than average for for
eign investment, should there
be governmental pressure on
the companies to plow some of
their profits back into higher
wages and greater benefits for
black workers? Presently,
there is scant evidence that
American companies treat their
workers any better than South
African companies treat theirs.
Should the U.S. take further
steps to deny tax credits to cor
porations which want to invest
in South Africa in the future, to
deny tax credits to companies
already investing in South
Africa, or to take actions to
curtail or eliminate American
investment in South Africa as
long as there is white minority
rule and the system of
apartheid?
While the U.S. must make
every effort to seek peaceful
transition to majority rule, will
the U.S. reduce its vehement
and vocal opposition to African
violence in their attempt to

achieve independence? The
present government in South
Africa practices institutional
violence which is every bit as
painful as revolutionary vio
lence. It is hoped that efforts
toward peaceful transition will
be successful, but many efforts
in the past to achieve peaceful
transition have been frustrated
by the refusal of the white mi
nority government to cede
power to the majority. Neither
George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson nor Patrick Henry
would have taken kindly to ap
peals for non-violence in 1776.
There is no reason why black
Africans should do so now.
If the United States has less
respect in the world than it once
had, it is not because our arma
ments are not still the most
powerful or that we lost in Viet
nam. Rather, it is that we en
tered Vietnam in the first place,
that we saw our interests so nar
rowly as to support the colonels
in Greece, the army in Chile, the
reactionaries in the Dominican
Republic, and) the colonialists
and white repressive regimes in
southern Africa. Unless and un
til the U.S. projects a broader
image of its interests in the
aspirations of the peoples of the
world for both economic secur
ity and political liberty, the U.S.
will continue to lose support
throughout the world.
A critical analysis of U.S. for
eign policy is needed now, not
only because of a new adminis
tration. The U.S. has within its
power the opportunity to show
the world that it has learned the
lesson that we stray from our
principles at our peril and that
the greatness of America lies
not in the power of its arma
ments but in the humanity of its
vision.
When 330 unarmed, black
South Africans can be killed and
opposition leaders held without
charge, when the minority gov
ernment refuses to share any of
its rights with 80 percent of its
own citizens, we cannot turn a
deaf ear or look the other way.
In South Africa, the hour is
late, and we must decide wheth
er we will in reality turn our
back upon or support those who
struggle against great odds for
justice — and therefore for ul
timate peace — in South Africa.

are higher than average for for
eign investment, should there
be governmental pressure on
the companies to plow some of
their profits back into higher
wages and greater benefits for
black workers? Presently,
there is scant evidence that
American companies treat their
workers any better than South
African companies treat theirs.
Should the U.S. take further
steps to deny tax credits to cor
porations which want to invest
in South Africa in the future, to
deny tax credits to companies
already investing in South
Africa, or to take actions to
curtail or eliminate American
investment in South Africa as
long as there is white minority
rule and the system of
apartheid?
While the U.S. must make
every effort to seek peaceful
transition to majority rule, will
the U.S. reduce its vehement
and vocal opposition to African
violence in their attempt to

achieve independence? The
present government in South
Africa practices institutional
violence which is every bit as
painful as revolutionary vio
lence. It is hoped that efforts
toward peaceful transition will
be successful, but many efforts
in the past to achieve peaceful
transition have been frustrated
by the refusal of the white mi
nority government to cede
power to the majority. Neither
George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson nor Patrick Henry
would have taken kindly to ap
peals for non-violence in 1776.
There is no reason why black
Africans should do so now.
If the United States has less
respect in the world than it once
had, it is not because our arma
ments are not still the most
powerful or that we lost in Viet
nam. Rather, it is that we en
tered Vietnam in the first place,
that we saw our interests so nar
rowly as to support the colonels
in Greece, the army in Chile, the
reactionaries in the Dominican
Republic, and) the colonialists
and white repressive regimes in
southern Africa. Unless and un
til the U.S. projects a broader
image of its interests in the
aspirations of the peoples of the
world for both economic secur
ity and political liberty, the U.S.
will continue to lose support
throughout the world.
A critical analysis of U.S. for
eign policy is needed now, not
only because of a new adminis
tration. The U.S. has within its
power the opportunity to show
the world that it has learned the
lesson that we stray from our
principles at our peril and that
the greatness of America lies
not in the power of its arma
ments but in the humanity of its
vision.
When 330 unarmed, black
South Africans can be killed and
opposition leaders held without
charge, when the minority gov
ernment refuses to share any of
its rights with 80 percent of its
own citizens, we cannot turn a
deaf ear or look the other way.
In South Africa, the hour is
late, and we must decide wheth
er we will in reality turn our
back upon or support those who
struggle against great odds for
justice — and therefore for ul
timate peace — in South Africa.

Before 1976, the trouble with
U.S. foreign policy toward
Africa and other continents and
nations was that it had been tied
too closely to grand strategy
and to the perceived immediate
exigencies of thwarting Soviet
power with too little thought
about either the indigenous
needs of the people affected by
U.S. policy or about the long
term interest of this country.
U.S. policy has been all too
quick to commit any injustice ir.
the name of anti-communism.
The Soviet menace has loomed
so large that all other policy
considerations have been
treated as secondary in im
portance.

It would have been far wiser
for the U.S. to have followed a
policy in support of black ma
jorities in southern Africa from
the beginning, a policy opposed
to colonial interests and against
white minority regimes — a pol
icy consistent with the ex
pressed values of the U.S., of the
expressed concern for the fun
damental values of equality and
liberty, fairness and justice — a
policy tied to an essential hu
manitarian concern for the wel
fare of all people — than to have
used Africa as a pawn in power
politics.
There is little doubt that had
the U.S. followed the right poli
cy from the start, this country's

motives would not be so much in
question as they are today. Fif
teen years ago most Africans
viewed the U.S. revolution as
their model and hope. Now the
U.S. is viewed with incredulity.
Until 1976, until the aftermath
of the shameful policy in Angola
made clear that the U.S. could
no longer approach Africa as it
had before, foreign policy had
been guided by National Secur
ity Council Memorandum 39.
which essentially said that the
white minority governments
were here to stay in Southern
Africa and that African policy
should seek accomodation with
those governments in the in
terest of political stability, eco

nomic prosperity and, most im
portantly, the strategic global
balance of power.
Not until 1976 did U.S. foreign
policy change to favor peaceful
transition to majority rule in
southern Africa. This was only
after the Soviet Union and Cuba
were camped on southern
Africa's doorstep. It seems this
new-found interest in black ma
jority rule was based upon the
spectre of cgmmunist expans
ion, rather than on human
itarian concerns of millions of
oppressed people in Zimbabwe,
Namibia, and Azania (South
Africa.) So, in 1976, the U.S.
began following the right policy,
but still for the wrong reasons.
During Jimmy Carter s brief
occupancy of the White House,
U.S. foreign policy was shaped
to make a commitment to ma
jority rule and to embrace the
concept of "human rights." The
Carter administration played a
critical role in Zimbabwe's
transition to majority rule last
year.
Now world attention focuses
on South Africa. As apartheid
intensifies, so does resistance to
this system of white supremacy
and racial separation. The role
the U.S. plays in the enfolding
South African struggle becomes
increasingly critical to peace
and justice in the southern tip of
the African continent.
Two weeks ago, the Reagan
administration moved into
Washington, bringing with it
some of Stanford's own Hoover
Fellows who, either directly or
indirectly, will help shape a new
U.S. foreign policy.
Will 1981 see the end of "hu
man rights'' as a major plank in
U.S. foreign policy? Will the
Reagan administration develop
even closer ties with the Southe
African government? What role
will the American people play in
shaping foreign policy?
As part of Black Liberation
Month, the South Africa Solidar
ity Committee has organized a
symposium which will bring the
community together to examine
the role of the American people
and the Reagan administration
in shaping foreign policy toward
South Africa. The symposium is
entitled. "U.S. Foreign Policy
Toward South Africa: A Critical
Analysis for the 80 s," and will
be held tomorrow at 7 p.m. in
Bishop Auditorium.
The symposium will allow the
community to analyze and

critique shifts from the Carter
to the Reagan foreign policy,
scrutinize the role of Stanford in
relation to the new adminis
tration and to South Africa,
identify and discuss the role of
the American people in shaping
foreign policy, and most
critically, raise the issue of the
participation of blacks and oth
er oppressed nationalities (who
historically have not had a great
deal of input into foreign policy
and other public policy matters)
in determining foreign policy
toward South Africa.
Questions to be raised and
analyzed by the symposium in
clude:
Will the U.S. make a clear
commitment to majority rule
for its own sake?
Will the U.S. make clear an
intention not to be involved mili
tarily, directly or indirectly,
covertly or overtly, in any war
that might occur in South
Africa? Will the U.S. make it
clear that its global interests of
frustrating Soviet power do not
extend to supporting oppressive
minorities in a race war in
southern Africa?
If Israel, Great Britain and
France continue to supply South
Africa with arms, what should
the U.S. response be?
By 1976 some three hundred
U.S. corporations had invested
more than $1.6 billion in South
Africa. Since profits for Ameri
can companies in South Africa
are higher than average for for
eign investment, should there
be governmental pressure on
the companies to plow some of
their profits back into higher
wages and greater benefits for
black workers? Presently,
there is scant evidence that

workers any better than South

deny tax credits to companies
already investing in South

curtail or eliminate American

spectre of cgmmunist expans
ion, rather than on human
itarian concerns of millions of
oppressed people in Zimbabwe,
Namibia, and Azania (South
Africa.) So, in 1976, the U.S.
began following the right policy,
but still for the wrong reasons.
During Jimmy Carter s brief
occupancy of the White House,
U.S. foreign policy was shaped
to make a commitment to ma
jority rule and to embrace the
concept of "human rights." The
Carter administration played a
critical role in Zimbabwe's
transition to majority rule last
year.
Now world attention focuses
on South Africa. As apartheid
intensifies, so does resistance to
this system of white supremacy
and racial separation. The role
the U.S. plays in the enfolding
South African struggle becomes
increasingly critical to peace
and justice in the southern tip of
the African continent.
Two weeks ago, the Reagan
administration moved into
Washington, bringing with it
some of Stanford's own Hoover
Fellows who, either directly or
indirectly, will help shape a new
U.S. foreign policy.
Will 1981 see the end of "hu
man rights'' as a major plank in
U.S. foreign policy? Will the
Reagan administration develop
even closer ties with the Southe
African government? What role
will the American people play in
shaping foreign policy?
As part of Black Liberation
Month, the South Africa Solidar
ity Committee has organized a
symposium which will bring the
community together to examine
the role of the American people
and the Reagan administration
in shaping foreign policy toward
South Africa. The symposium is
entitled. "U.S. Foreign Policy
Toward South Africa: A Critical
Analysis for the 80 s," and will
be held tomorrow at 7 p.m. in
Bishop Auditorium.
The symposium will allow the
community to analyze and

critique shifts from the Carter
to the Reagan foreign policy,
scrutinize the role of Stanford in
relation to the new adminis
tration and to South Africa,
identify and discuss the role of
the American people in shaping
foreign policy, and most
critically, raise the issue of the
participation of blacks and oth
er oppressed nationalities (who
historically have not had a great
deal of input into foreign policy
and other public policy matters)
in determining foreign policy
toward South Africa.
Questions to be raised and
analyzed by the symposium in
clude:
Will the U.S. make a clear
commitment to majority rule
for its own sake?
Will the U.S. make clear an
intention not to be involved mili
tarily, directly or indirectly,
covertly or overtly, in any war
that might occur in South
Africa? Will the U.S. make it
clear that its global interests of
frustrating Soviet power do not
extend to supporting oppressive
minorities in a race war in
southern Africa?
If Israel, Great Britain and
France continue to supply South
Africa with arms, what should
the U.S. response be?
By 1976 some three hundred
U.S. corporations had invested
more than $1.6 billion in South
Africa. Since profits for Ameri
can companies in South Africa
are higher than average for for
eign investment, should there
be governmental pressure on
the companies to plow some of
their profits back into higher
wages and greater benefits for
black workers? Presently,
there is scant evidence that
American companies treat their
workers any better than South
African companies treat theirs.
Should the U.S. take further
steps to deny tax credits to cor
porations which want to invest
in South Africa in the future, to
deny tax credits to companies
already investing in South
Africa, or to take actions to
curtail or eliminate American
investment in South Africa as
long as there is white minority
rule and the system of
apartheid?
While the U.S. must make
every effort to seek peaceful
transition to majority rule, will
the U.S. reduce its vehement
and vocal opposition to African
violence in their attempt to

achieve independence? The
present government in South
Africa practices institutional
violence which is every bit as
painful as revolutionary vio
lence. It is hoped that efforts
toward peaceful transition will
be successful, but many efforts
in the past to achieve peaceful
transition have been frustrated
by the refusal of the white mi
nority government to cede
power to the majority. Neither
George Washington, Thomas
Jefferson nor Patrick Henry
would have taken kindly to ap
peals for non-violence in 1776.
There is no reason why black
Africans should do so now.
If the United States has less
respect in the world than it once
had, it is not because our arma
ments are not still the most
powerful or that we lost in Viet
nam. Rather, it is that we en
tered Vietnam in the first place,
that we saw our interests so nar
rowly as to support the colonels
in Greece, the army in Chile, the
reactionaries in the Dominican
Republic, and) the colonialists
and white repressive regimes in
southern Africa. Unless and un
til the U.S. projects a broader
image of its interests in the
aspirations of the peoples of the
world for both economic secur
ity and political liberty, the U.S.
will continue to lose support
throughout the world.
A critical analysis of U.S. for
eign policy is needed now, not
only because of a new adminis
tration. The U.S. has within its
power the opportunity to show
the world that it has learned the
lesson that we stray from our
principles at our peril and that
the greatness of America lies
not in the power of its arma
ments but in the humanity of its
vision.
When 330 unarmed, black
South Africans can be killed and
opposition leaders held without
charge, when the minority gov
ernment refuses to share any of
its rights with 80 percent of its
own citizens, we cannot turn a
deaf ear or look the other way.
In South Africa, the hour is
late, and we must decide wheth
er we will in reality turn our
back upon or support those who
struggle against great odds for
justice — and therefore for ul
timate peace — in South Africa.

Before 1976, the trouble with
U.S. foreign policy toward
Africa and other continents and
nations was that it had been tied
too closely to grand strategy
and to the perceived immediate
exigencies of thwarting Soviet
power with too little thought
about either the indigenous
needs of the people affected by
U.S. policy or about the long
term interest of this country.
U.S. policy has been all too
quick to commit any injustice ir.
the name of anti-communism.
The Soviet menace has loomed
so large that all other policy
considerations have been
treated as secondary in im
portance.

It would have been far wiser
for the U.S. to have followed a
policy in support of black ma
jorities in southern Africa from
the beginning, a policy opposed
to colonial interests and against
white minority regimes — a pol
icy consistent with the ex
pressed values of the U.S., of the
expressed concern for the fun
damental values of equality and
liberty, fairness and justice — a
policy tied to an essential hu
manitarian concern for the wel
fare of all people — than to have
used Africa as a pawn in power
politics.
There is little doubt that had
the U.S. followed the right poli
cy from the start, this country's

motives would not be so much in
question as they are today. Fif
teen years ago most Africans
viewed the U.S. revolution as
their model and hope. Now the
U.S. is viewed with incredulity.
Until 1976, until the aftermath
of the shameful policy in Angola
made clear that the U.S. could
no longer approach Africa as it
had before, foreign policy had
been guided by National Secur
ity Council Memorandum 39.
which essentially said that the
white minority governments
were here to stay in Southern
Africa and that African policy
should seek accomodation with
those governments in the in
terest of political stability, eco

nomic prosperity and, most im
portantly, the strategic global
balance of power.
Not until 1976 did U.S. foreign
policy change to favor peaceful
transition to majority rule in
southern Africa. This was only
after the Soviet Union and Cuba
were camped on southern
Africa's doorstep. It seems this
new-found interest in black ma
jority rule was based upon the
spectre of cgmmunist expans
ion, rather than on human
itarian concerns of millions of
oppressed people in Zimbabwe,
Namibia, and Azania (South
Africa.) So, in 1976, the U.S.
began following the right policy,
but still for the wrong reasons.
