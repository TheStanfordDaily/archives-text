## Look behind deceptive names

L.H. Gann, a senior fellow at Hoover, responds
to his critics (Daily, Jan. 26) by accusing them of
arguing "ad hominem" (i.e., of insulting him
without responding to his ideas). Judging from
the quotes he includes, Gann is justified in his ac
cusation.
Ad hominem attacks are not only
reprehensible; they tend to be an admission of de
feat as well. So if. in this response to Gann's ideas,
I suddenly hurl invectives, look for the white flag.
It'll be hidden under a vicious noun.
Gann, applying some of his widespread reading
(I'll try to ignore the fact that he knows infinitely
more than I do), argues that "communists of all
persuasions use camouflage tactics" or decep
tions. and that, "although communists differ
among themselves ... right-wing authoritarian
regimes arc preferable to communist regimes. "
I won't take issue with Gann's first argument,
except to comment that people of all persuasions
use camoflauge tactics or deception.
I cannot agree with Gann's second argument
According to Gann, communist states are more
dangerous than other forms of dictatorship be
cause they attempt "to control every aspect of
life. Art. philosophy, science, religion â€” nothing
is exempt from (communists') interference . . .
they wish to create nothing less than the New
Man.'
"No right wing dictatorship has ever practiced
mass liquidation of the kind practiced in com

munist countries as diverse as Russia, China,
Vietnam and Cambodia."
I can only respond with this word: fascism (Ex
cuse the invective. No white flag intended).
Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, Franco's
Spain. And perhaps the Shah's Iran. These leaders
tried to change their countries. Hitler to produce a
ruling race of Aryan "New Men," and the Shah to
westernize an eastern nation.
The Shah did not "liquidate"' as Stalin did, but
Hitler's genocide is an established and stunning
fact. It would in some sense be nice to sweep
Hitler under the carpet of historical excess, but by
doing so we would impair our understanding of
right-wing regimes.
Indeed, that understanding should not be based
on whether a nation calls itself "communist,"
"fascist," or a "people's republic." Rather, it is
the nature of a country and of its leaders that
should determine whether a given set of leaders is
preferable from any viewpoint.
Mainland China is "communist," whatever
that tells you, but it is our ally against the equally
"communist" Soviets. It may be our opponent in
the years to come, as it has been in years past. But
should we now oppose China, simply because we
consider it "communist"?
Let's not be convinced by any ad hominem
"argument."
