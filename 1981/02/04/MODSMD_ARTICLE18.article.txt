## Rivlin submits budget shopping list 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Congress got a
preview yesterday of how it can
reduce the fiscal 1982 deficit by
about $40 million if it is willing
to cut popular programs like So
cial Security, food stamps and
student loans and close some
tax loopholes that largely bene
fit middle-income Americans.
At the request of the House
Budget Committee, Con
gressional Budget Director
Alice Rivlin submitted a shop
ping list of 105 "examples" of
how Congress could pare down
its projected 1982 deficit of $55-
to-60 billion by both cutting ex
penditures and raising revenues
through selective tax increases.
"There are no easy targets on
the list," Rivlin told the com
mittee. "There are none that
would not result in some people
or institutions being worse off
than they would otherwise be."
Budget Committee Chairman
James Jones (D-Okla.) de
scribed the list as the start of
"what may well turn out to be
the most painful political proc
ess through which any of us will
ever go." It could lead even
tually, he added, to a "political
revolution."
The list prepared by the Con
gressional Budget Office, which
serves the Democratic-con
trolled House and Republican
controlled Senate, was com
piled independently of budget
cuts that President Reagan is
expected to submit to Congress
as part of an overall economic
package later this month.
Moreover, more than half of the
CBO's deficit reductions come
from tax increases, while Rea
gan has promised tax cuts. But
the options could be important
in shaping congressional
priorities when Congress gets
down to acting on Reagan's pro

posals.
Jones said after Rivlin's testi
mony that, despite the political
problems posed by many of the
CBO options, it will be possible
to compile enough of them to cut
the projected deficit to about $25
billion. But the list ''points out
how difficult it will be ...
Jones said. He said he thought
some of the tax proposals might
win congressional approval, in
cluding reducing or eliminating
the tax deduction for interest
paid on credit purchases of con
sumer good's, which costs the
Treasury $6 billion a year.
This was recommended as an

option by Rivlin, along with put
ting a $120 monthly limit on de
ductions for employer-paid
health insurance benefits ($2.6
billion in savings) and a $5000
cap on the deduction for mort
gage interest ($6 billion in sav
ings). Jones said he thought a
change in the mortgage deduc
tion was highly unlikely, but
urged that the health insurance
proposal as well as the con
sumer credit idea be "taken
very seriously."
In her testimony, Rivlin also
noted that benefits to individ
uals constituted 49 percent of all
federal spending last year and
warned that "there is no other

way" to reduce the cost of these
programs than to cut benefits or
eligiblity lists.
As options, she cited raising
the retirement age for Social Se
curity to 68, restoring the
$40,000 family income ceiling
for eligibility for guaranteed
student loans, raising income
limits for food stamps amd
modifying cost of living in
creases for Social Security and
other programs.
"It is hard to see how the
growth in federal spending can
be significantly reduced without
changing these (cost of living)
indexing provisions," Rivlin
added.
