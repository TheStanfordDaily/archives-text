# Refiners start fuel price rise
## 
### 
New York (AP) â€” Several of
the nation's largest refiners
boosted wholesale pries of
gasoline, home heating oil and
diesel fuel as much as 5 cents a
gallon yesterday as the lifting of
federal petroleum price con
trols continued to drive fuel
prices higher.
The hikes could be felt shortly
by consumers, although one in
dustry source said gasoline
dealers in some regions "are
going to have to eat a lot" of the
wholesale increases because de
mand for the fuel has been weak
following earlier price hikes.
The source, who asked not to
be identified, said heating oil
users probably would see the
full effect of the wholesale in
crease because "they've got to
have" the fuel.
Mobil Corp. said it raised
gasoline, diesel fuel and home
heating oil prices a nickel a
gallon nationwide to reflect "in
creased crude oil prices" here

and abroad, The nation's sec
ond-largest oil company said the
domestic crude oil price hikes
came "as a result of decontrol. - '
Standard Oil Co. (Indiana),
the No. 6 oil company, said its
wholesale prices for Amoco
gasolines rose 4 cents a gallon
while those for its heating oil
and diesel fuel climbed 2 to 4
cents a gallon, depending on re
gion.
"Amoco still is attempting to
recover the increases in crude
oil costs that were incurred
prior to last week's total decon
trol of domestic crude oil
prices." the company said in a
prepared statement. A spokes
man. who asked not to be quoted
by name, refused to comment
when asked if further product
price increases were planned.
The national average price
for gasoline was about $1.27 a
gallon before President Reagan
announced Jan. 28 he had lifted
the oil price controls, eight

months before they had been
due to expire.
Analysts have said the Presi
dent's move could boost U.S.
fuel prices about 10 cents a
gallon, and several refiners sub
sequently announced wholesale
price increases of 1 to 6 cents a
gallon.
On Monday, No. 11 Sun Co.
Inc. said it increased wholesale
gasoline and home heating oil
prices by 2 to 3 cents a gallon in
the East, Midwest and
Southwest following an increase
of as much as 2.5 cents a gallon
in several regions late last
week.
