# Overcrowding plagues CPPC job interviews
## 
### Monika Guttman 
Students in the liberal arts who
want to sign up for interviews at the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter (CPPC) this quarter are finding
stiff competition.
On the days when sign up lists for
the prestigious firms are to be posted,
many have been lining up at the CPPC
as early as 3 a.m. Some students re
port that getting to the CPPC at these
early hours just barely assures them
of getting an interview with the "ma
jor" companies, such as Meryll Lynch
or Morgan Guarantee Trust.
One student said that when he ar
rived at 4 a.m. to sign up for an in
terview, he was eighteenth in line.
"One guy had a bed there, and several
people had sleeping bags," the student
said.
According to Ralph Keller, CPPC
director, this has been a recurrent
phenomenon for a number of years.
"We've tried various and sundry
systems, but most place some stu
dents at a distinct disadvantage," he
said. "We've tried to encourage peo
ple to line up at 8 a.m. when the CPPC
opens, but there are some people who
are so highly motivated that they show
up extremely early. And if one shows
up, then others are likely to also."
First-come first serve
Since most of the companies only in
terview about 12 students, the first
dozen students that sign up get the in
terviews through the current first
come, first-serve policy, Keller said.
However, the CPPC encourages most
companies to take and consider any
additional resumes submitted, he
added.

Former University President Rich
ard Lyman initiated the firsi-come,
first- serve policy in 1971.
University President Donald Ken
nedy has talked about the problems
with this system and the first
come, first-serve policy "clearly is
not working," according to Special As
sistant to the President Marlene Wine.
Burden on companies
"He has said that the burden should
rest on the companies," Wine said.
Wine mentioned that Kennedy has
considered such policies as sending re
sumes to the companies in advance
and letting them choose the 25 or so
students they wish to interview.
But Keller said that this sort of sys
tem would be discriminatory, and
stated that he would be against such a
change.
"Asking companies or the CPPC to
pre-screen is the least fair practice,"
he said. "It would place minority stu
dents at a disadvantage, since some
minority students may not be as
knowlegeable about the the corporate
applications process as some non-mi
nority students."
Science majors
Also, there are students, primarily
science and engineering majors, who
like the current system. These stu
dents said they have less trouble sign
ing up for interviews, and that signing
a list is "very convenient."
Daniel Powers, a senior in math sci
ences. said that he was "rather sur
prised to find that some of the com
pany interview sheets still had open
ings after being posted for several
days."
