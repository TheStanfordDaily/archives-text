San Francisco (AP) —
The main witness in the
trial of a fellow Iranian ac
cused of bombing a student
meeting in Berkeley said
yesterday he didn't tip po
lice after learning of the
plan because he was
"shocked, really shocked
and terrified."
Under cross examination
in U.S. District Court,
Amir Ehdaee, 39, re,-
iterated he feared for his
family and himself when
Naser Almaneih disclosed
he had been with an Iranian
secret police group and was
a member of the anti-sabo
tage committee, a group al

legedly involved in torture
and executions.
Ehdaee, himself a
former member of another
secret police group called
SAVAK, said this kept him
trying to break away from
the pro-shah Almaneih last
Aug. 20. the day they went
to Berkeley and planted the
bombs in the lobby of a high
school auditorium where
Iranian students were
meeting. One student was
injured slightly when the
first bomb went off.
He said that was also the
reason he failed to notify
authorities of his part in the
incident for more than two

weeks until his "conscience
got the best of him."
Ehdaee admitted he be
came a paid informant for
government law-enforce
ment agencies shortly after
arriving in the United
States in March 1979 on a le
gal Grenada passport
which cost him $20,000.
He said he got $1000 from
the Drug Enforcement Ad
ministration and other
payments, and began re
ceiving $20 a day and then
$50 a day for expenses until
being placed in the federal
witness protection pro
gram.
