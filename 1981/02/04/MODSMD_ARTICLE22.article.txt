# Three Mile Island catastrophe: Financial question still remains
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — A small lake of
radioactive water still stands on
the floor of the reactor building
at Pennsylvania's Three Mile
Island, site of the worst acci
dent in the history of peacetime
nuclear power.
For reasons of health and
safety, the water and the crip
pled reactor core must be
cleaned up and the nuclear
waste must be safely buried —
monumental tasks with a min
imum price tag of $1 billion.
The question is: who is going
to pay the bill?
Congress will struggle with
the issue this year, debating
whether taxpayers in Califor
nia, New York and the rest of
the nation should help pay for an
accident in Pennsylvania. If the
money does not come directly
from Washington, it may be sup
plied by the nation's electric
utilities. But that solution, too,
would ultimately transfer the fi
nancial burden to all Americans
in the form of higher electric
bills.
Because an accident like
Three Mile Island was un
precedented, no one foresaw the
extraordinary costs. Insurance
coverage, with a maximum of
$300 million, was woefully in

adequate. Metropolitan Edison,
operator of Three Mile Island,
already has spent two-thirds of
the insurance money it col
lected from a consortium of
companies, and has slowed
down activities to stretch out
the last $100 million and keep
the cleanup process going
through the end of 1982.
The Three Mile Island Unit 2
power plant has been shut down
since the accident March 28,
1979. A valve failure, com
pounded by human error, pro
duced the incident, which was
unparalleled in the era of nucle
ar power generation. Acciden
tally closed valves prevented
cooling water from circulating
and the reactor heated to a dan
gerously high level, with urani
um fuel in the core partly melt
ing.
Reactor core damaged
Before the reactor eventually
was brought under control, the
reactor core had been severely
damaged and dangerous vol
umes of radiation had been
emitted into the building hous
ing the reactor. The plant has
been shut ever since.
Strained by the cost of getting
replacement power and paying
interest on money borrowed to
build the Three Mile Island

units, Metropolitan Edison
teeters on the brink of
bankruptcy. The company says
it will be unable to pay its bills in
April unless the state of Penn
sylvania grants it emergency
rate relief.
Customers of Metropolitan
Edison have seen their utility
bills rise 25 percent since the ac
cident as the company buys
costly power from other com
panies to distribute to them. The
Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission will not allow the
company to charge its cus
tomers for the costs of cleaning
up Three Mile Island, or to re
tire the bonds used to pay for
building the nuclear unit.
So. all eyes have now turned
to the federal government as a
possible financial savior.
More is at stake than the fate
of Metropolitan Edison. The
future of nuclear power in the
United States may well depend
on the policies established to
clean up Three Mile Island, and
to handle the financial costs of
any future accidents.
Financial quandary
Three Mile Island's financial
quandary is "a scar on industry,
a wound that has to be healed,"
said Carl Walske, president of
the Atomic Industrial Forum, a

nuclear industry trade associa
tion.
"There is a mess that must be
cleaned up because of health
and safety reasons," said
Walske.
"All these players have to sit
around a table and hammer out
a deal," he continued, referring
to the company, the state of
Pennsylvania, the electric utili
ty industry and the federal gov
ernment.
An ordinary industrial plant
that was shattered by an acci
dent could be closedly relatively
cheaply. Any remaining struc
tures might be torn down, or
guards and watchgdogs posted
to keep out intruders.
Such a solution is impossible
for Unit 2 at Three Mile Island.
The radioactive water in the
containment building might
leak out, polluting the Sus
quehanna River. The damaged
uranium fuel rods are still spew
ing out radiation within the re
actor vessel.
"For better or worse, we're
pioneers" in the task of cleaning
up after an unprecedented acci
dent, said Philip Fine, manager
of public information on nuclear
matters for General Public Util
ities, the parent company of
Metropolitan Edison.

The question is: who is going
to pay the bill?
Congress will struggle with
the issue this year, debating
whether taxpayers in Califor
nia, New York and the rest of
the nation should help pay for an
accident in Pennsylvania. If the
money does not come directly
from Washington, it may be sup
plied by the nation's electric
utilities. But that solution, too,
would ultimately transfer the fi
nancial burden to all Americans
in the form of higher electric
bills.
Because an accident like
Three Mile Island was un
precedented, no one foresaw the
extraordinary costs. Insurance
coverage, with a maximum of
$300 million, was woefully in

adequate. Metropolitan Edison,
operator of Three Mile Island,
already has spent two-thirds of
the insurance money it col
lected from a consortium of
companies, and has slowed
down activities to stretch out
the last $100 million and keep
the cleanup process going
through the end of 1982.
The Three Mile Island Unit 2
power plant has been shut down
since the accident March 28,
1979. A valve failure, com
pounded by human error, pro
duced the incident, which was
unparalleled in the era of nucle
ar power generation. Acciden
tally closed valves prevented
cooling water from circulating
and the reactor heated to a dan
gerously high level, with urani
um fuel in the core partly melt
ing.
Reactor core damaged
Before the reactor eventually
was brought under control, the
reactor core had been severely
damaged and dangerous vol
umes of radiation had been
emitted into the building hous
ing the reactor. The plant has
been shut ever since.
Strained by the cost of getting
replacement power and paying
interest on money borrowed to
build the Three Mile Island

units, Metropolitan Edison
teeters on the brink of
bankruptcy. The company says
it will be unable to pay its bills in
April unless the state of Penn
sylvania grants it emergency
rate relief.
Customers of Metropolitan
Edison have seen their utility
bills rise 25 percent since the ac
cident as the company buys
costly power from other com
panies to distribute to them. The
Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission will not allow the
company to charge its cus
tomers for the costs of cleaning
up Three Mile Island, or to re
tire the bonds used to pay for
building the nuclear unit.
So. all eyes have now turned
to the federal government as a
possible financial savior.
More is at stake than the fate
of Metropolitan Edison. The
future of nuclear power in the
United States may well depend
on the policies established to
clean up Three Mile Island, and
to handle the financial costs of
any future accidents.
Financial quandary
Three Mile Island's financial
quandary is "a scar on industry,
a wound that has to be healed,"
said Carl Walske, president of
the Atomic Industrial Forum, a

nuclear industry trade associa
tion.
"There is a mess that must be
cleaned up because of health
and safety reasons," said
Walske.
"All these players have to sit
around a table and hammer out
a deal," he continued, referring
to the company, the state of
Pennsylvania, the electric utili
ty industry and the federal gov
ernment.
An ordinary industrial plant
that was shattered by an acci
dent could be closedly relatively
cheaply. Any remaining struc
tures might be torn down, or
guards and watchgdogs posted
to keep out intruders.
Such a solution is impossible
for Unit 2 at Three Mile Island.
The radioactive water in the
containment building might
leak out, polluting the Sus
quehanna River. The damaged
uranium fuel rods are still spew
ing out radiation within the re
actor vessel.
"For better or worse, we're
pioneers" in the task of cleaning
up after an unprecedented acci
dent, said Philip Fine, manager
of public information on nuclear
matters for General Public Util
ities, the parent company of
Metropolitan Edison.
Washington — A small lake of
radioactive water still stands on
the floor of the reactor building
at Pennsylvania's Three Mile
Island, site of the worst acci
dent in the history of peacetime
nuclear power.
For reasons of health and
safety, the water and the crip
pled reactor core must be
cleaned up and the nuclear
waste must be safely buried —
monumental tasks with a min
imum price tag of $1 billion.
