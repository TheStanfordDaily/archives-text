## Perkins punishes people 
### Mark Kerber 
Doug Perkins is not a smooth wrestler. His
offense has all the subtlety of Atilla the Hun's.
Sometimes he does things that would make
even a junior high school coach tear out his
hair.
But he wins.
Perkins, who is 37-8 in two years of varsity
level competition, is both the winningest and
the least orthodox wrestler on the Stanford
squad Most of Perkins' technique revolves
around his amazing combination of power,
flexibility, and positive thinking. "With my un
orthodox style. I think that I can beat anyone,
no matter how good they are," said Perkins.
"Sometimes I beat people that I shouldn't beat
because they can't adjust."
Coaches and teammates disagree. They
were virtually unanimous in citing attitude as
his secret to success. "He has an incredible at
titude." said 150-pounder Bruce Rubin. "He
just doesn't believe he can lose."
Perkins later confirmed Rubin's statement.
When asked if he ever worries about losing
before he steps onto the mat, Perkins an
swered unequivocally, "Never."
What about wrestling Eddie Banach. the
NCAA champ at Perkins' weight? "I still think
I could win," replied Perkins. "You have to
know that before you step on the mat."
Perkins' winning attitude pays real
dividends in competition. First, because of
his complete confidence. Perkins attacks con
tinuously This forces opponents to wrestle de
fensively and to adjust their tactics. In short.

Perkins makes them wrestle the match in his
style and at his tempo. Secondly, such con
fidence allows Perkins to try things in com
petition that no mere mortai would attempt,
even in practice. Since he could hit "the big
one" at any time, Perkins is never out of a
match until it's over.
Closely related to his winning attitude is
Perkins' penchant for heaping physical abuse
on his opponents. Although his sportsmanship
is exemplary. Perkins said that he "goes onto
the mat to hurt people." In wrestling, such an
attitude is not something left over from the
days of Vince Lombardi. but it is an essential
part of a winning frame of mind. Teammate
and workout partner Tom Mullen best sum
marized the effect of Perkins' unremitting of
fense. "Wrestling Perkins is no fun."
Perkins contributes to the wrestling pro
gram while off the mat. too. As a freshman, the
Reno. Nevada, native acted as both coach and
manager of the almost nonexistent Stanford
Wrestling Club, drumming up support and
scheduling meets in an attempt to save the
sport here.
Now a junior. Perkins is of course happy to
see wrestling return to varsity status, but he
feels student support is lacking. "Wrestling is
a misunderstood sport." he said, "but if people
would give it a chance, they'd like it."
Stanford students will be given their last
chance to see Perkins and the rest of the Stan
ford team wrestle this year at Maples Pavilion
on Friday at 5:00 p.m. wnen the Cardinals take
on Notre Dame.
