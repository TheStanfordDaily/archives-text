# Forward should start Friday
## Welch-DiBiaso conflict over 
### Chris Haft 
Any controversy addicts hop
ing for a strife-filled, anger-rid
den continuation to last week
end's Brian Welch embroglio
will be disappointed to hear that
the differences between the jun
ior forward and men's basket
ball coach Dick DiBiaso have
apparently been settled.
The source of the problem,
though, remains mysterious.
DiBiaso benched Welch, the
Cardinals' leading scorer and
co-captain, for the duration of
Saturday's 84-66 loss to Arizona
State, and caused confusion by
giving no explanation after
wards. Welch, who couldn't un
derstand why he was benched,
had also sat out the final three
minutes of Friday .night's 91-81
loss to Arizona.
However, Welch and DiBiaso
met Monday and settled their
problems.
"As far as I'm concerned,
everything is back to normal,"
said Welch yesterday, dismiss
ing the affair as a "small inci
dent."
"We discussed everything. In
a sentence, it was resolved,"
DiBiaso said."Brian and I sat
here, looked at each other eye
to-eye, and resolved it. I have a
faith and a belief in him — and I
would like to think he has the
same in me.
"Brian will have a chance to
win back his starting position in
practice this week," DiBiaso
added. Translation: Welch will
start Friday night against Ore
gon.
The coach also conferred with
co-captain Steve Crandell and
talked to the team concerning
the Welch matter before Mon
day's practice. "To the best of
my knowledge, the issue is
over," the coach affirmed.

"I don't think this is nearly as
big a thing as the press it's got
ten," Crandell said.
Neither of the parties in
volved revealed why the
benching took place. But since
the Pacific-10 Conference sea
son began, Welch has provided
the Cards with on-court leader
ship. One would guess that
Welch either overstepped his
limits as the team "leader," or
did something that Dißiaso felt
was unbecoming of a leader,
such as question a coaching de
cision during the game.
"From my standpoint as head
coach, 1 can understand people
and our fans wanting to know
details of what happened, but I
don't feel I should have to give
those details," Dißiaso said
"This is not to say it's a deep,
dark, flagrant type of thing."
There had been speculation
that Welch was being punished
for not hustling on defense Fri
day night against Arizona, but
Welch himself dispelled that
rumor.
"I don't think he was all
(that) upset with the way I had
played," Welch said. "It was
something other than the way I
had been playing. It's personal
between Coach Dißiaso, my
self. and the team."
Dißiaso thought long and
hard when asked why he didn't
offer Welch an immediate ex
planation. Eventually he
summed up, "I had a justifiable
reason not to approach him."
With the matter closed,
Welch didn't feel negatively
toward Dißiaso for having to
wait until Monday for a settle
ment. "I suppose I did (feel re
sentment) at the time, but I'm
sure he had his reasons — I don't
pass judgement on that." the
Boise, Idaho native said.

Neither of the parties in
volved revealed why the
benching took place. But since
the Pacific-10 Conference sea
son began, Welch has provided
the Cards with on-court leader
ship. One would guess that
Welch either overstepped his
limits as the team "leader," or
did something that Dißiaso felt
was unbecoming of a leader,
such as question a coaching de
cision during the game.
"From my standpoint as head
coach, 1 can understand people
and our fans wanting to know
details of what happened, but I
don't feel I should have to give
those details," Dißiaso said
"This is not to say it's a deep,
dark, flagrant type of thing."
There had been speculation
that Welch was being punished
for not hustling on defense Fri
day night against Arizona, but
Welch himself dispelled that
rumor.
"I don't think he was all
(that) upset with the way I had
played," Welch said. "It was
something other than the way I
had been playing. It's personal
between Coach Dißiaso, my
self. and the team."
Dißiaso thought long and
hard when asked why he didn't
offer Welch an immediate ex
planation. Eventually he
summed up, "I had a justifiable
reason not to approach him."
With the matter closed,
Welch didn't feel negatively
toward Dißiaso for having to
wait until Monday for a settle
ment. "I suppose I did (feel re
sentment) at the time, but I'm
sure he had his reasons — I don't
pass judgement on that." the
Boise, Idaho native said.

Forward Brian Welch and head coach Dick Dißiaso have apparent
ly come to an understanding over the "discipline problem" which
caused Dißiaso to bench his leading scorer for the ASU game last
weekend.
