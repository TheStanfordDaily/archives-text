sunny Mexico this week to par
ticipate in the Pan-American

twenty golf teams in the coun

State, Oklahoma State, and
Brigham Young University rep
resent just a sample of the tough
competition Stanford will face.
The Cardinal squad will include
three freshman (Tim Robinson,
Doug Thompson, Lew Dickey)
and two juniors, Skilling and
Tad Thompson, a transfer from
Rice University. They will tee
off Thursday morning, the first
day of the three round tour
nament Coripetition will con

day Feb. 7.
Head Coach David Yates
seemed enthusiastic about the
trip. He appeared anxious to see
how his team will measure up
against the nation's best. He de
scribed the Pan-Am tournament
as a "mini NCAA tournament,"
and expressed great hopes of es
tablishing Stanford's golf repu
tation there.
Yates went on to comment,
"These are the best teams in the
nation, and the experience is re
ally going to help us." The ex
perience is indeed one of the
reasons the Cardinals decided to
participate in the tournament.
The opportunity to compete
with these excellent teams may
help Stanford when they host the
NCAA Golf Championship on
it's home course, beginning May
27th.
