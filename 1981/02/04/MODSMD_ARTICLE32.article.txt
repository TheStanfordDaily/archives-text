# Oregon State leading powerful Pacific-10
## 
### Sarrah Carrel 
The Pacific-10 Conference
has long been yielding outstand
ing teams in basketball, but the
1981 season seems to be produc
ing some unusually fine ones.
Three of the teams are in the
top twenty and of these, the Ore
gon State Beavers stand in sec
ond place, while the explosive
Sun Devils from Arizona State
check in at number five. UCLA
is currently twelfth in the na
tion.
Coach Jim Haney of the Ore
gon Ducks does not have his
team ranked in the polls right
now, but is working through a
rebuilding year, trying to form a
team that will be much sturdier
by the close of the season. So
far, their two-and-five record
places them in a tie in the con
ference with Cal-Berkley, Stan
ford, and the University of Ari

zona.
The high points of the team's
season thus far has been its win
over USC and its road victory in
Pullman against Washington
State. To Haney, the 70-66 WSU
victory is a sign that his team is
getting stronger. He has looked
to the backbone of his team for
supportive performances this
season, which means he has
looked to his front line. High
scorer and rebounder Mike
Clark continues to perform con
sistently night in and night out,
and he has plenty of help from
his teammate, forward John
Grieg. Also of great value to the
team is surprise freshman Fred
Cofield, who has shown great
promise.
UO assistant coach Jim
Krause sees the remainder of
the season as a challenge, even
if it doesn't mean a finish high in

the Pac-10 standings. . "Last
year we finished seventh, so this
year we want at least sixth,"
Krause said. "All I hope to do is
beat the teams we ought to beat.
If things go well, the dice will
fall the right way." He went on
to say that "Coach Haney has
succeeded in changing our style
from a slow defensive group to a
fast-breaking offensive team.
The team is really responding to
his philosophy."
The Washington State
Cougars are also going through
a tough season with mostly new
players. Head coach George
Raveling was quick to point out
that none of his five starters
from last year are on the roster
this year. Newcomer Ken
McFadden and Angelo Hill pro
vide the team with extra
strength. Hill has looked espe

cially good so far this year; hav
ing bucketed the most points for
his team so far.
Despite the team's last place
conference standing, Raveling
looks quite optimistically
towards what is left of the sea
son. Recently the Cougars
showed their potential by beat
ing Cal. "We played our best
basketball of the season at both
ends of the court,"he said, "and
from that We know we can con
tinue to improve."
All of these Pac-10 coaches
and teams share one opinion.
They knowthat they are part of
what is traditionally an ex
tremely competitive con
ference. Raveling of Washing
ton State noted that, "It is not
unusual for the Pacific-10 to
place several teams in the top 20

every year.
What makes this year a sen
sation is the general agreement
that Oregon State is a definite
powerhouse, and has a good
chance to represent the Pac-10
in the national winner's circle at
the end of the year. Of his
Northwest neighbors, Raveling
said, "They are the best, and de
serving of number one." Cal's
Kuchen echoed the mentor from
WSU. "It's hard to rate a team
as number one (in the nation),
but Oregon State is certainly the
best team in the conference."

basketball tradition, and Ore
gon State, Arizona State, and
UCLA are among the nation's

The Pacific-10 is proud of its
basketball tradition, and Ore
gon State, Arizona State, and
UCLA are among the nation's
best. It is this that makes the
conference a constant challenge
to the other participating
teams.
The Pacific-10 Conference
has long been yielding outstand
ing teams in basketball, but the
1981 season seems to be produc
ing some unusually fine ones.
Three of the teams are in the
top twenty and of these, the Ore
gon State Beavers stand in sec
ond place, while the explosive
Sun Devils from Arizona State
check in at number five. UCLA
is currently twelfth in the na
tion.
Coach Jim Haney of the Ore
gon Ducks does not have his
team ranked in the polls right
now, but is working through a
rebuilding year, trying to form a
team that will be much sturdier
by the close of the season. So
far, their two-and-five record
places them in a tie in the con
ference with Cal-Berkley, Stan
ford, and the University of Ari

zona.
The high points of the team's
season thus far has been its win
over USC and its road victory in
Pullman against Washington
State. To Haney, the 70-66 WSU
victory is a sign that his team is
getting stronger. He has looked
to the backbone of his team for
supportive performances this
season, which means he has
looked to his front line. High
scorer and rebounder Mike
Clark continues to perform con
sistently night in and night out,
and he has plenty of help from
his teammate, forward John
Grieg. Also of great value to the
team is surprise freshman Fred
Cofield, who has shown great
promise.
UO assistant coach Jim
Krause sees the remainder of
the season as a challenge, even
if it doesn't mean a finish high in

the Pac-10 standings. . "Last
year we finished seventh, so this
year we want at least sixth,"
Krause said. "All I hope to do is
beat the teams we ought to beat.
If things go well, the dice will
fall the right way." He went on
to say that "Coach Haney has
succeeded in changing our style
from a slow defensive group to a
fast-breaking offensive team.
The team is really responding to
his philosophy."
The Washington State
Cougars are also going through
a tough season with mostly new
players. Head coach George
Raveling was quick to point out
that none of his five starters
from last year are on the roster
this year. Newcomer Ken
McFadden and Angelo Hill pro
vide the team with extra
strength. Hill has looked espe

cially good so far this year; hav
ing bucketed the most points for
his team so far.
Despite the team's last place
conference standing, Raveling
looks quite optimistically
towards what is left of the sea
son. Recently the Cougars
showed their potential by beat
ing Cal. "We played our best
basketball of the season at both
ends of the court,"he said, "and
from that We know we can con
tinue to improve."
All of these Pac-10 coaches
and teams share one opinion.
They knowthat they are part of
what is traditionally an ex
tremely competitive con
ference. Raveling of Washing
ton State noted that, "It is not
unusual for the Pacific-10 to
place several teams in the top 20

every year.
What makes this year a sen
sation is the general agreement
that Oregon State is a definite
powerhouse, and has a good
chance to represent the Pac-10
in the national winner's circle at
the end of the year. Of his
Northwest neighbors, Raveling
said, "They are the best, and de
serving of number one." Cal's
Kuchen echoed the mentor from
WSU. "It's hard to rate a team
as number one (in the nation),
but Oregon State is certainly the
best team in the conference."
The Pacific-10 is proud of its
basketball tradition, and Ore
gon State, Arizona State, and
UCLA are among the nation's
best. It is this that makes the
conference a constant challenge
to the other participating
teams.
