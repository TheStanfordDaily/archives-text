Phoenix, Ariz.(AP) — Former
Arizona State football Coach
Frank Kush testified Tuesday
that he "couldn't recall ever
touching" ex-Sun Devil player
Kevin Rutledge in a 1978 game
and says he first learned of an
alleged punching incident
through a booster almost a year
later.
Rutledge is suing Kush, the
university, former Sun Devil as
sistant coach Bill Maskill and
others for $2.2 million in dam
ages — claiming Kush punched
him in the mouth following a
poor punt during Arizona State's
41-7 loss to Washington Oct. 28,
1978.

Kush said he told Felker that,
"i definitely did not hit the
young man "

The Stanford baseball team
will travel to Hayward State to
day, for what might be their
toughest game thus far. "It will
be a good test for us," said
coach Mark Marquess.
The Cardinals won both of
their first two games, against
UC-Santa Clara and UC-Davis.
They could be in some trouble
this time however. Hayward
has a reputation for being tough,
particularly at home, and
almost beat the Cardinals at
Sunken diamond last year.
In addition, two starters will
see only limited playing time as
a result of injuries. Third
baseman John Elway and short
stop Dave Meier are both suffer
ing from badly bruised knees,
which will leave the Cardinals
short handed.lo

record, and stand at 2-4 in Nor-
