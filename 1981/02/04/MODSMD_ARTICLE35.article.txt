India breaks nuclear agreement
Bombay, India— India is free to reprocess U.S.-
supplied nuclear fuel without prior U.S. permission,
a senior Indian nuclear official said yesterday.
"There is no question of permission from the
United States for reprocessing the fuel." said Vinay
Meckoni, a high-level official at India's premier nu
clear development facility, the Bhabha Atomic Re
search Center here. "The fuel belongs to us."
The statement, made to a group of foreign
newsmen touring the center, marks the first time
that India has publicly claimed complete autonomy
over the fuel, which, if reprocessed, could be used to
make atomic weapons However. Meckoni said, no
decision has yet been made to actually begin reproc
essing the spent fuel.
Such an action would provide India with the poten
tial to acquire 1000 kilograms of plutonium. an
amount capable of producing 200 Hiroshima-type
bombs.
The United States has long maintained that terms
of a 1963 contract to supply enriched uranium to an
American-built nuclear plant at Tarapur prevented
India from reprocessing the spent fuel into
plutonium without prior U.S. approval.
India's stance appears to put it on a collision
course with the new Reagan administration. The
Republican Party platform called for cutting off the
supply of uranium unless India agrees to continue
compliance with the non-proliferation law. some
thing that India has consistently refused to do.
National debt ceiling raised
Washington— The House Ways and Means Com
mittee. acting swiftly and with an unusual show of
Republican support, overwhelmingly approved a $50
billion increase in the national debt ceiling to $985
billion yesterday
The near-unanimous action by voice vote on Pres
ident Reagan's first legislative request to Congress
improved chances that it would be passed this week
by the House and Senate so that the government can
keep paying its bills after Feb. 18.
Most of the 12 Republicans on the committee, in
contrast to their opposition to debt ceiling increases
during the Carter administration, supported the re
quest.
At the same time, big city mayors and black con
gressional leaders visited President Reagan in
hopes of protecting urban and social aid programs
from sharp reductions However. Reagan told them
his drive to prune federal spending will mean deep
cuts in urban aid.
The president has said no federal program would
be immune from potential cuts, although the admin
istration would not reduce overall defense spending.
Reagan planned to make a general address on the
economy to the nation tomorrow night and provide a
broad outline of his economic program in a State-of
the-Union address to Congress on Feb. 18.
Kania denounces Polish unions
Warsaw, Poland— Poland's Communist Party
leader, in his strongest denunciation of the inde
pendent trade union movement, yesterday accused
Solidarity of seeking to become a "political opposi
tion party" and of spreading anarchy.
Stanislaw Kania affirmed the government's op
position to a union of private farmers and said Po

land was faced with "manifestations of anarchy"
and with transformation of Solidarity into an or
ganization "far removed from what is laid down in
its statutes "
Kania's speech was given Saturday to a closed
door meeting of a committee preparing for next
month's party congress and excerpts were broad
cast by Polish state radio yesterday.
It came at a time of new charges from the Soviet
Union that independent labor leaders were hostile to
Communist Party rule and exploiting the crisis for
their political ends. The Soviet government news
paper Izvestia charged yesterday that the Voice of
America and Radio Free Europe were broadcasting
"coded instructions" to anti-socialist forces in Po
land
Kania said that while the government recognized
a right to strike, it "is a weapon of last resort ...
many of our strikes are clearly political in charac
ter " Kania also warned party members that they
should not take part in strikes.
On the issue of organization of Poland's private
farmers. Kania said it comes down to one question:
"Is the countryside to be a scene of cooperation be
tween the people's regime and peasant-farmers or is
it to be the scene of political struggle 0 "
ILA linked to organized crime
Washington— A five-month investigation by a
Senate subcommittee has found evidence of strong
ties to organized crime among high-ranking of
ficials of the scandal-ridden International Long
shoremen's Association in New York and Miami.
Interviews with shippers, dock workers, and fed
eral prosecutors, as well as secret tapes of con
versations between ILA officials and others, have
produced a picture of a major union "whose very
fabric is shot through with organized crime connec
tions." according to a source familiar with the Sen
ate inquiry.
A source close to the investigation said that there
was widespread evidence that businessmen have
made payoffs to the union's officers in order to re
ceive favored treatment on waterfront contracts. In
a typical case a union official may cooperate with
organized crime elements to steer work toward a fa
vored stevedoring company or container repair out
fit.
The Senate investigators are said to have focused
particular attention on the activities of Anthony
Scotto. George Barone, Paul LaPlante, and Tino
Fiumara, all leaders of the International Long
shoremen's Association. The men reportedly have
unsavory ties that will be documented in upcoming
Senate testimony. The Department of Justice has
furnished secret tape recordings to the subcommit
tee that illustrate links to the Vito Genovese crime
"family."
Canadian moves to control oil
Toronto— The government-owned Petro-Canada
oil company announced an agreement yesterday to
take over a Belgian company in a move that marked
the first step in the nation's program to make the oil
and gas industry more Canadian.
Once completed, the takeover will enable Canadi
ans to purchase gasoline at government-owned ser
vice stations from coast to coast. It will also ensure
an increase in the cost of a gallon of gasoline.
Yesterday Petro-Canada and Petrofina S. A. an

nounced their agreement to let the Canadian govern
ment company buy at least a majority of the shares
of Petrofina Canada, the Belgian company's Canadi
an subsidiary. The cost, in Canadian dollars, would
be $120 a share, including a premium of more than
$30 over the price of a share.
Petrofina had long been rumored as one of the
main targets of the new energy program announced
last October by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Un
der the program, the government pledged to break
the enormous foreign hold on the oil and gas industry
in Canada and work toward government or private
control of a significant number of the larger oil and
gas companies
The government energy program made provision
for a special "Canadian ownership account" tax on
gasoline to help finance government takeovers of
foreign companies
Anderson will judge '84 bid
Pasadena, Calif. — John B. Anderson, who cam
paigned unsuccessfully for the presidency last year
as an independent, said yesterday that he would
form a third party and run again in 1984 if President
Reagan's administration proves to be ' stillborn"
and people are disenchanted with the two-party sys
tem.
The former Republican member of Congress
from Illinois said that he would decide in nine
months whether to make another attempt to win the
presidency. If his decision is to try again. Anderson
said, he will call a national convention to organize a
third political party.
He said he would use a list of 250.000 contributors
to his 1980 campaign as a foundation to build upon;
shun "gurus of the old politics" like New York me
dia consultant David Garth, whom he blames in part
for his third-place finish, and become "a little bit
more apocalyptic" about issues.
At the same time. Anderson said, he will try to
soften the intensity of his campaign style.
The former congressman and presidential can
didate was in Pasadena for a reception honoring his
59th birthday this month and for a speech Wednes
day at Occidental College in Los Angeles.
Anderson said he was pleased with some of Rea
gan's appointments, such as Caspar W. Weinberger
as secretary of defense; but disappointed in others,
such as Alexander M. Haig Jr. as secretary of state.
Otherwise, Anderson declined to give Reagan any
marks for his presidency so.far.
"I don't think the grading period is over," he said.
"I don't think he's even had a quiz yet."
