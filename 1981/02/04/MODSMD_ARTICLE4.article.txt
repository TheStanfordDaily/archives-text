# U.S. considering neutron warheads
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger said yesterday
that the United States would probably
want to deploy neutron warheads in
Europe, a move that wou'd reverse a
controversial 1978 decision by the
Carter administration.
Weinberger said the initial decision
by former President Jimmy Carter to
deploy "enhanced radiation" or neu
tron weapons in Europe was not
wrong, although it was reversed soon
after it had been conveyed to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
"What was wrong was the sudden
change" of mind, he said, adding that
Carter's about-face was taken "to the
consternation of the German govern
ment as well as mahy others." Wein
berger promised "a greater degree of
constancy this time" in consulting
with U.S. allies.
"We have had, in the very recent
past, a strong recommendation from

this government that it (the neutron
weapon) be used," Weinberger said.
"I so far have seen very little to in
dicate to my mind that was wrong.
"... So I think that the opportunity
that this weapon gives to strengthen
theater nuclear forces is one that we
very probably would want to make use
of."
Responding to a question on the neu
tron weapons — which would have
greater radiation and less blast ef
fects than standard nuclear devices —
Weinberger at first said only that the
Pentagon should examine the possi
bility of producing the neutron war
heads. But he was more positive later
in the news conference.
The warheads would be placed on
Lance medium-range missiles and in
eight-inch artillery shells. They would
be targeted mainly on the huge Soviet
tank forces along the Iron Curtain.
The greater emission of neutron ra
diation by the weapon means that it
would be relatively more destructive

to living things than to structures, in
cluding buildings, than standard nu
clear warheads, weapons specialists
have said
After Carter sought the consent of
the NATO allies, particularly West
Germany, to deploy the weapon, a
heated public debate broke out in the
United States and apparently led to his
change of mind.
During the debate. Carter ordered
that production of neutron warheads
be deferred indefinitely, but then
directed that critical parts of the
weapon be ready so it could be pro
duced quickly, should a go-ahead be
given for such action.
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West
Germany claimed that the U.S. re
versal embarrassed him politically af
ter he had argued for deployment of
the weapon before his Social Demo
cratic Party. Carter aides claimed
that Schmidt used the issue only to ex
pose his broader disagreements with
Carter on many matters.
