# Senate approves final Reagan nominees
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — Despite Democratic
protests that he is unqualified, the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
voted 10-4, with three abstentions yes
terday to approve the nomination of
California Supreme Court Justice Wil
liam Clark as deputy secretary of
state.
And President Ronald Reagan filled
out his Cabinet yesterday as the full
Senate confirmed New Jersey busi
nessman Raymond Donovan to be Sec
retary of Labor on a 80-17 vote, just
two weeks after Inaguration Day.
The "no" votes were the most cast
against any Reagan nominee.
Donovan's opponents, all Democrats,
cited allegations by six FBI infor
mants that Donovan or his company,
Schiavone Construction Co. of
Secaucus, N.J.. had ties and dealings
with organized crime figures.
Before the Foreign Relations Com

mittee took the final vote on the Clark
nomination, Sen. Charles Percy (R
-111.), the committee chairman said,
"Never again can we accept a man
who professes to have no knowledge in
the area for which he has been nomi
nated." Percy nevertheless voted for
Clark.

Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker Jr. (R-Tenn), a committee
member, expressed hope yesterday
that the nomination could be approved
by the full Senate by tomorrow, before
the Senate adjourns for its week-long
Lincoln Day recess. But committee
sources said later that the necessary
papers would not be completed before
the recess starts. This means the Sen
ate cannot confirm Clark before Feb.
16 at the earliest.
Repeating objections raised during
questioning of the 49-year-old Califor
nia jurist Monday, his Democratic
critics complained that he had demon
strated an almost total lack of knowl

edge or interest in foreign affairs. Sen.
Joseph Biden Jr. (D-Del.) questioned
whether Clark "even reads the news
papers."
Administrator not policy maker
Clark, who wan not present for yea
terday's meeting, had told the com
mittee Monday that Reagan, his long
time associate, had selected him to be
an administrator, not a policymaker.
Before his appointment by Reagan to
the California court, Clark had served
as Reagan's executive secretary when
Reagan was governor.
The strongest support for Clark was
expressed by Sen. Jesse Helms, <R-
N.C.) who is known to be delighted
with Clark's reputation as a judicial
conservative.
Helms, who has frequently spoken
disdainfully of the State Department
bureaucracy, predicted that Clark, as
the department's chief administrator,
would do some shaking up of per
sonnel.
'New approach'
"He will bring a new approach,"
Helms predicted, "an approach that
the people voted for on Nov 4."
Before the Senate approved his
nomination yesterday, Donovan de
nied the allegations that he was linked
to organized crime in sworn testi
mony His defenders, led by Sen. Orrin
Hatch (R-Utah) cited an exhaustive
FBI investigation of the allegations
that failed to substantiate the charges.
Reagan telephoned congratulations
to Donovan immediately after the
vote, and Donovan told reporters: "I
certainly do feel vindicated, my part
ners feel vindicated and my company
feels vindicated "
Donovan, who watched much of the

debate from the Senate gallery, said
that he felt "sadness that people could
even think that of me.'' He said that he
held no hard feelings toward his
critics in the Senate. "I think the prob
lems of the country are so great. " he
said, "that I have to put personal feel
ings behind me."
Allegations provide fuel
The allegations provided fuel for
both Donovan's detractors and his
supporters.
"If we had such reports from one or
two individuals, it would perhaps be
possible to dismiss them." Sen. How
ard Metzenbaum. (D-Ohio) told the
Senate in explaining his vote against
Donovan. "But when six different 're
liable' informants independently pro
vide the same general information, I
don't believe that we can afford to ig
nore the possibility that a real prob
lem might, in fact, exist."
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
leading Democrat on the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee,
which held hearings on the Donovan
nomination, explained his vote against
the nominee:
"Although the record demonstrates
Mr. Donovan's success in business, I
believe that the record fails to show
that the nominee possesses that
degree of independence and sensi
tivity essential in a labor secretary at
this critical period in our nation's his
tory."
Sen. John East (R-N.C.) told his col
leagues that if they let the unproven
charges hang as a cloud over Donovan,
they would be giving "a veto power
over Cabinet appointees to the under
world." Donovan's chief accuser was
Ralph Picardo. a convicted felon.

that failed to substantiate the charges.
Reagan telephoned congratulations
to Donovan immediately after the
vote, and Donovan told reporters: "I
certainly do feel vindicated, my part
ners feel vindicated and my company
feels vindicated "
Donovan, who watched much of the

debate from the Senate gallery, said
that he felt "sadness that people could
even think that of me.'' He said that he
held no hard feelings toward his
critics in the Senate. "I think the prob
lems of the country are so great. " he
said, "that I have to put personal feel
ings behind me."
Allegations provide fuel
The allegations provided fuel for
both Donovan's detractors and his
supporters.
"If we had such reports from one or
two individuals, it would perhaps be
possible to dismiss them." Sen. How
ard Metzenbaum. (D-Ohio) told the
Senate in explaining his vote against
Donovan. "But when six different 're
liable' informants independently pro
vide the same general information, I
don't believe that we can afford to ig
nore the possibility that a real prob
lem might, in fact, exist."
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
leading Democrat on the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee,
which held hearings on the Donovan
nomination, explained his vote against
the nominee:
"Although the record demonstrates
Mr. Donovan's success in business, I
believe that the record fails to show
that the nominee possesses that
degree of independence and sensi
tivity essential in a labor secretary at
this critical period in our nation's his
tory."
Sen. John East (R-N.C.) told his col
leagues that if they let the unproven
charges hang as a cloud over Donovan,
they would be giving "a veto power
over Cabinet appointees to the under
world." Donovan's chief accuser was
Ralph Picardo. a convicted felon.
From the Daily wire services
Washington — Despite Democratic
protests that he is unqualified, the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
voted 10-4, with three abstentions yes
terday to approve the nomination of
California Supreme Court Justice Wil
liam Clark as deputy secretary of
state.
And President Ronald Reagan filled
out his Cabinet yesterday as the full
Senate confirmed New Jersey busi
nessman Raymond Donovan to be Sec
retary of Labor on a 80-17 vote, just
two weeks after Inaguration Day.
The "no" votes were the most cast
against any Reagan nominee.
Donovan's opponents, all Democrats,
cited allegations by six FBI infor
mants that Donovan or his company,
Schiavone Construction Co. of
Secaucus, N.J.. had ties and dealings
with organized crime figures.
Before the Foreign Relations Com

mittee took the final vote on the Clark
nomination, Sen. Charles Percy (R
-111.), the committee chairman said,
"Never again can we accept a man
who professes to have no knowledge in
the area for which he has been nomi
nated." Percy nevertheless voted for
Clark.

Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker Jr. (R-Tenn), a committee
member, expressed hope yesterday
that the nomination could be approved
by the full Senate by tomorrow, before
the Senate adjourns for its week-long
Lincoln Day recess. But committee
sources said later that the necessary
papers would not be completed before
the recess starts. This means the Sen
ate cannot confirm Clark before Feb.
16 at the earliest.
Repeating objections raised during
questioning of the 49-year-old Califor
nia jurist Monday, his Democratic
critics complained that he had demon
strated an almost total lack of knowl

edge or interest in foreign affairs. Sen.
Joseph Biden Jr. (D-Del.) questioned
whether Clark "even reads the news
papers."
Administrator not policy maker
Clark, who wan not present for yea
terday's meeting, had told the com
mittee Monday that Reagan, his long
time associate, had selected him to be
an administrator, not a policymaker.
Before his appointment by Reagan to
the California court, Clark had served
as Reagan's executive secretary when
Reagan was governor.
The strongest support for Clark was
expressed by Sen. Jesse Helms, <R-
N.C.) who is known to be delighted
with Clark's reputation as a judicial
conservative.
Helms, who has frequently spoken
disdainfully of the State Department
bureaucracy, predicted that Clark, as
the department's chief administrator,
would do some shaking up of per
sonnel.
'New approach'
"He will bring a new approach,"
Helms predicted, "an approach that
the people voted for on Nov 4."
