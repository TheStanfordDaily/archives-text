# University furniture thefts on rise
## 
### Debbie Walker 
A Stanford senior was arrested in the early dawn hours
last Friday and booked on charges of stealing a large
couch from the ZAP house lounge.
The arrest is but one example of a growing problem on
campus â€” the theft of furniture from University buildings
"This last quarter the University lost a substantial
amount of furniture," Director of Stanford Police Depart
ment Marvin Herrington said. "Several thousand dollars
worth was stolen from Terman, the Graduate School of
Business and Encina."
Assistant Director of Residential Education Diana Con
klin said this type of theft is not uncommon.
"I have heard the situation is worse this year than in
years past," Conklin said.
Herrington said students often start out with the idea
that a specific piece of furniture would look good in their
room and plan to "borrow" it for the year.
Justification
"This sort of justification to themselves is very interest
ing," Herrington said, "but it is still a theft, and we arrest
students if they commit crimes."
Herrington said students have been arrested for steal
ing furniture in the past.
"The University can't afford to keep getting ripped off
like this," Conklin said. "The important point is that bor
rowing' or stealing this furniture is not an innocent act
Notified last spring
Herrington said the police were first notified of this ZAP
house theft last spring quarter.
Jennifer Hirsch, former ZAP house manager and a cur
rent resident, said the theft occured within two weeks af
ter the expensive new couch had been placed in the lounge
"Over the summer one of the house members learned
that Tom Toal (the accused thief) had the couch at his

house," Hirsch said. "I told him to bring it back in the fall
but he never did."
Hirsch said she contacted Toal after returning to school,
but at that point he denied possession of the couch
Second hand evidence
"I didn't contact the police at that time because I didn't
think they could do anything with this type of second hand
evidence," Hirsch said. "Instead I contacted the Row Of
fice and tried to find out what kind of information would be
required to force Tom to return the couch
Hirsch said the Row Office advised her not to go to the
police and that some sort of concrete evidence would be
needed before the arrest could be made.
After one quarter, Hirsch said, word of the theft had
spread among ZAP residents, and, on January 21, bitter
feelings culminated in the decision to visit Toal's home in
a large group.
No physical confrontation
"We thought if so many people were there," Hirsch
said, ' there would be no possibility of physical confronta
tion."
Toal again denied he had the couch and allowed the stu
dents to tour his house in Los Gatos
After an unfruitful tour, one student poked around be
hind the garage and discovered a small shack which had
concealed the couch The students returned to campus
with the couch and later informed the Row Office that they
had recovered the missing piece of furniture
Stanford housing authorities then contacted the Stan
ford police, who obtained a felony warrant and arrested
Toal on Friday
Herrington said the Stanford police hoped this incident
would encourage students possessing stolen items to re
turn them.
