## States sue over proposed coastal leasing 
### Jennifer Seymour 
When the Department of the Interior
makes a "call for comments" on proposed
offshore oil leasing programs, it always
gets plenty of feedback. Rarely does it get
sued.
But the State of California, the State of
Alaska, and the Natural Resources Defense
Council (NRDC) have filed suit against the
Interior over their recently announced
Lease Sale No. 73, a land offering which
would open more than 24 million acres of
Outer Continental shelf for oil and gas ex
ploration
The targeted exploration fields, spanning
10 percent of the distance from the Equator
to the North Pole, include several "frontier
areas" which had never been leased before.
It is over these regions, especially tracts off
central California, northern California, in
the Bering Sea and the Arctic Seas off Alas
ka that conflict has arisen.
Several tracts deemed low in petroleum
potential and abundant in coastal or marine
resources are now being included in lease
propositions.
"It makes little sense to offer for lease
areas which have even less fuel reserves
than tracts deleted from previous sales,"
said Michael Fischer, the commission's ex
ecutive director.
Areas off Santa Cruz, San Mateo, Marin,
Mendocino and Humboldt counties, reflect
ing four very different geologic basins and
environments, are part of the proposed

lease.
The Coastal Commission also expressed
concern that it would not be possible to col
late all the data needed for filing environ
mental impact reports. A "call for com
ments" means the public may comment on
proposed areas being offered for lease to oil
companies. Such calls are prerequisite to
draft and final environmental impact
statements which are made at public hear
ings some time after the lease has been pro
posed.

71 makes little sense to offer for lease areas which have
even less fuel reserves than tracts deleted from previous
sales.'

Critical information for these reports on
environmental effects of offshore drilling in
more sensitive geologic basins will not be
available by the proposed sale date, accord
ing to the NRDC.
"We have told Interior before, and we
will continue to tell them, that lease sales of
this size cannot be properly evaluated for
environmental effects resulting from oil
drilling," said Fischer.
Leasing of such large offshore expanses
under one lease sale also violates the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments
of 1978. according to the Commission. This
is the root of the Interior law suit.
The Lands Act Amendments insure a bal
ance between energy production and
marine resource protection and require en
vironmental studies of frontier sale areas.
"The Commission is not opposed to off
shore drilling; that's unrealistic. But it's
virtually impossible to make needed en
vironmental analyses over such huge land
areas." said Commission official Kati Cor

saut.
"(The Departmentof the Interior has > in
cluded some of our most sensitive marine
environments in their package. To de
termine the drilling impact of oil spills,
blow outs, vessel traffic and effluent dis
charges for all nine geologic basins would
take more time than we have."
The NRDC point to 1969's Santa Barbara
Blowout, which belched over one million
gallons of oil over 30 miles of beach, as in
dicative of the damages drilling can inflict

on California coastal environments.
"How much" is also an issue, according
to the NRDC; about 1500 chemical com
pounds are emitted to the ocean during vari
ous drilling operations. Though small quan
tities of these are easily rendered harmless
when diluted by the ocean, the impact
large doses of such by-products would have
is unknown.
In the past, Interior has been responsive
to environmental concerns. The Com
mission applauded previous decisions to de
lete certain offshore tracts judged sensitive
by environmental groups But lease sale No.
73 would reopen these tracts for oil explora
tion.
Why the sudden leasing step-up? The
NRDC points to growing demands for inde
pendence from foreign oil. Offshore opera
tions in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, as
well as along the West Coast, are now being
placed within the scope of Interior's
1980-1985 leasing program.
