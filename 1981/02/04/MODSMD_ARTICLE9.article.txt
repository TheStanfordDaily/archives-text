# Teams try Sy ber Vision
## 
### Alan Wiemann 
There is a new program in the
sports world that seeks to com
bine psychological methods
with conventional physical
training to produce dramatic in
creases in skill for both the pro
fessional athlete and for the
weekend tennis piayer.
Professional Development
Associates. Inc. (PDA) in San
Leandro. publishing agent for
the system, claims that "Out of
every three months you prac
tice your sport using the
SyberVision system, your skill
and consistency level will
progress at least two years
ahead of where you would nor
mally be."
SyberVision is a trademark
for a training program which
uses visual cues and positive
feedback to develop consistency
of performance in athletes. Un
der this system the athlete
watches video recordings of
himself at the height of per
formance, carefully edited to
reinforce his mental image of
the performance, all with the
music of his choice in the back
ground.
A quarterback, for example,
will watch a rapid-fire repeated
playback of his best 40 yard pass
to the theme from the film
"Rocky."
The scenes are interweaved
with a blank blue screen, a vis
ual color cue which the athlete
uses later to recall a mental pic
ture of his performance.
This system was used by sev
eral Stanford tennis players last
year with mixed results.
Stanford Men's Tennis Coach
Dick Gould was approached by
PDA with the prospect of using
this system in training the ten
nis teams at Stanford. They
were given a presentation in San
Leandro after which Gould al
lowed the students to decide in

dividually if they wanted to par
ticipate Nine men and seven
women decided in January to
try the program.
These students were
videotaped during practice and
Gould and Frank Bren
nan, Stanford Women's Tennis
Team Coach, picked out five
best shots for each player,
based on technical correctness
These shots were edited onto
a video cassette with music of
the student's choice. The re
cording was viewed several
times a week with each session
preceded by a period of method
ical relaxation.
According to Gould, "a re
ligious approach is needed to
make this program effective."
Of those who used the pro
gram, about half benefited, ac
cording to Gould.
The capture of the 1980 NCAA
Tennis Championship has been
attributed to the use of
SyberVision by it proponents,
but Gould commented, "We
used SyberVision and won the
nationals — the women used it
and didn't."
The primary obstacle to
SyberVision's widespread ac
ceptance and use in college
sports, besides its almost pro
hibitive cost (between $2500 and
$3000 to cover technical costs
alone, according to Steven De-
Vore of PDA), is the lack of sci
entific evidence which indicates
that marked improvement in
performance or consistency is a
direct result of using the pro
gram.
Brian Hennessy, graduate
student in education at Stan
ford, is conducting research to
determine if increased level of
performance or increased con
sistency is correlated with par
ticipation in the SyberVision
program.
Eight men on the Stanford

golf team are his subjects. By
classifying them according to
past performance and then re
cording their performance his
tory this season, he hopes to
learn the degree of effective
ness, if any, of the program.
Because performance in golf
can be measured quantitatively
by way of scores, it is an espe
cially suitable sport for em
pirical testing.
Although he will not see any
real results until February,
some players have reported in
creased concentration. Jack
Skilling, captain of the golf
team, said that he was "better
able to control the focus of his
concentration."
However, caution was ex
pressed by Richard Schavone,
sports psychologist and director
of diving at Stanford, who
pointed out that SyberVision is
the reapplication of existing, es
tablished methods, and not a
new breakthrough in sports sci
ence. "They've put it in a pack
age," he said.
He stressed that the program
will enhance an athlete's per
formance at his current level
but does not increase skill and
will not correct wrong mechan
ics.
When asked if the use of
SyberVision as a psychological
training method poses any ethi
cal problems, Gould replied,
"No/absolutely not."
According to Hennessy, the
method does not employ hypno
tism to achieve results. The sys
tem merely enables the athlete
to use his own ability more ef
fectively and gives him no un
fair advantage over his com
petitor, he said.
Yates said that SyberVision
"poses no ethical problems
it's just developing another
skill."

direct result of using the pro
gram.
Brian Hennessy, graduate
student in education at Stan
ford, is conducting research to
determine if increased level of
performance or increased con
sistency is correlated with par
ticipation in the SyberVision
program.
Eight men on the Stanford

golf team are his subjects. By
classifying them according to
past performance and then re
cording their performance his
tory this season, he hopes to
learn the degree of effective
ness, if any, of the program.
Because performance in golf
can be measured quantitatively
by way of scores, it is an espe
cially suitable sport for em
pirical testing.
Although he will not see any
real results until February,
some players have reported in
creased concentration. Jack
Skilling, captain of the golf
team, said that he was "better
able to control the focus of his
concentration."
However, caution was ex
pressed by Richard Schavone,
sports psychologist and director
of diving at Stanford, who
pointed out that SyberVision is
the reapplication of existing, es
tablished methods, and not a
new breakthrough in sports sci
ence. "They've put it in a pack
age," he said.
He stressed that the program
will enhance an athlete's per
formance at his current level
but does not increase skill and
will not correct wrong mechan
ics.
When asked if the use of
SyberVision as a psychological
training method poses any ethi
cal problems, Gould replied,
"No/absolutely not."
According to Hennessy, the
method does not employ hypno
tism to achieve results. The sys
tem merely enables the athlete
to use his own ability more ef
fectively and gives him no un
fair advantage over his com
petitor, he said.
Yates said that SyberVision
"poses no ethical problems
it's just developing another
skill."
There is a new program in the
sports world that seeks to com
bine psychological methods
with conventional physical
training to produce dramatic in
creases in skill for both the pro
fessional athlete and for the
weekend tennis piayer.
Professional Development
Associates. Inc. (PDA) in San
Leandro. publishing agent for
the system, claims that "Out of
every three months you prac
tice your sport using the
SyberVision system, your skill
and consistency level will
progress at least two years
ahead of where you would nor
mally be."
SyberVision is a trademark
for a training program which
uses visual cues and positive
feedback to develop consistency
of performance in athletes. Un
der this system the athlete
watches video recordings of
himself at the height of per
formance, carefully edited to
reinforce his mental image of
the performance, all with the
music of his choice in the back
ground.
A quarterback, for example,
will watch a rapid-fire repeated
playback of his best 40 yard pass
to the theme from the film
"Rocky."
The scenes are interweaved
with a blank blue screen, a vis
ual color cue which the athlete
uses later to recall a mental pic
ture of his performance.
This system was used by sev
eral Stanford tennis players last
year with mixed results.
Stanford Men's Tennis Coach
Dick Gould was approached by
PDA with the prospect of using
this system in training the ten
nis teams at Stanford. They
were given a presentation in San
Leandro after which Gould al
lowed the students to decide in

dividually if they wanted to par
ticipate Nine men and seven
women decided in January to
try the program.
These students were
videotaped during practice and
Gould and Frank Bren
nan, Stanford Women's Tennis
Team Coach, picked out five
best shots for each player,
based on technical correctness
These shots were edited onto
a video cassette with music of
the student's choice. The re
cording was viewed several
times a week with each session
preceded by a period of method
ical relaxation.
According to Gould, "a re
ligious approach is needed to
make this program effective."
Of those who used the pro
gram, about half benefited, ac
cording to Gould.
The capture of the 1980 NCAA
Tennis Championship has been
attributed to the use of
SyberVision by it proponents,
but Gould commented, "We
used SyberVision and won the
nationals — the women used it
and didn't."
The primary obstacle to
SyberVision's widespread ac
ceptance and use in college
sports, besides its almost pro
hibitive cost (between $2500 and
$3000 to cover technical costs
alone, according to Steven De-
Vore of PDA), is the lack of sci
entific evidence which indicates
that marked improvement in
performance or consistency is a
direct result of using the pro
gram.
