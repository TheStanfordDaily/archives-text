# Student involvement called 'key'
## Bluegrass decision deferred 
### Eric Cornell 
Last night's special meeting of the
ASSU Senate, which was to have reex
amined this year's Bluegrass Festival
at Stanford, was postponed until next
week due to poor attendance.
The Council of Presidents (COP)
had called the meeting to reconsider
last week's senate resolution, which
was to bring the Bluegrass Festival
back to Stanford, provided it could be
accomplished with no financial risk
and a minimum of student involve
ment. But at 7 p.m.. Senate Chair
Doug Mitchell ruled that the meeting
had been insufficiently publicized, and
according to senate by-laws, it had to
be cancelled.

According to COP member Marc
Ventresca. various University depart
ments have indicated their disap
proval of a professionally produced
concert with little student partici
pation. The Bluegrass Festival is usu
ally produced by the deficit-plagued
and now defunct ASSU Special
Events.
Last week the senate voted to con
tinue with the Bluegrass Festival pro
posed for this spring The festival was
to be promoted and financed by groups
outside the University, but students
interested in concert production
would have had the opportunity to ob
serve for their educational benefit.
The Senate Finance Committee, in

its recommendation to the senate, out
lined explicit guidlines for the prod
uction and concluded. "The festival is
in no way meant to be indicative of ap
proval for student concert prod
uction."
After the aborted special meeting.
Dayna Goldfine, who heads the Task
Force on Contemporary Entertain
ment. talked about her conception of a
program to keep concerts at Stanford.
"We could hire a professional man
ager . . . and make various attempts
at outside fundraising or co-promo
tion."
"This can be accomplished by
spring quarter." Goldfine continued.
"It will be a profit-making venture for
the ASSU and will provide a needed
outlet for entertainment."
Goldfine called the method a stop
gap measure. "We're buying time,
keeping the festival at Stanford, until
we finish planning a student-run
project' which would fare better than
the ill-fated Special Events.
Committees
The senate broke into committee
meetings. The Senate Financial Com
mittee met to review Financial Man
ager Steve Davis' fall quarter report
on ASSU projects. The Sunday Flicks,
as usual, were very profitable, netting
more than $3600. Davis pointed out
that the Flicks were as popular as
ever, with last Sunday's attendance at
Ht'in,u There setting a 15-year record.
The ASSU Typing Service, however,
has not been as successful. The ser
vice lost more than $800 fall quarter,
continuing a year-long trend. Finance
Committee Chair Gary Reiff sug
gested the possibility of replacing the
Typing Service with a clearing house
bulletin board which lists the names
and numbers of students willing to do
typing on a free-lance basis.
The Senate will meet in a regular
session next week to discuss the fate of
the Bluegrass Festival. According to
Ventresca, the key issue is student in
volvement. The ASSU cannot afford to
commit a lot of time to the project
now. Ventresca said. On the other
hand, the University prefers that
projects of this nature include stu
dents rather than just outside man
agement.
Goldfine discounted the possibility
that the Office of Public Events
(OPE) will take over concert prod
uction. "I don't think the OPE would
handle it. Concerts are still the stu
dents' franchise," she said.
