# Seniors act out 'good deeds' for Children's Hospital
## 
### Andrew Johanos 
"Senior Class Good Deed at
Children's Hospital: Go to
Roble Lounge on Tuesday at
5:30." All right, I thought, just
another story assignment. I fig
ured I could make it quick, just
watch what they do and talk
with the organizers after the
show. Boy was 1 wrong.
Entering Roble I saw two
guys wearing cowboy hats, wav
ing their arms and directing a
group of twenty students who
were singing ' Do do this; Don't
do that. How are we to know?
The only way we'll ever learn is
watching Billy's show!" I
quickly double-checked my as
signment sheet for the location.
"Hey, are you in the show?"
The guy in the black hat meant
me. "Er, well I'm from the Dai
ly. I'm supposed to ... "
"That's OK," he said, "you're
in." Kidnapped isn't the word,
but I was caught without an ex
cuse.
Sitting down I began thinking
this might be fun and challeng
ing. In the next half hour, we
were to learn three skits and the
accompanying songs. Although
humbling, it didn't destroy my
ego to learn that these skits
served as fill-ins between acts
of real talent.
"Billy's Show" came first,
this week featuring the do's and
don'ts of dating. In one of six
scenarios. I was cast as a clod
who opens the wrong car after
getting popcorn at the drive-in. I
hoped they weren't type-cast

ing.
Next, we all learned the
words to the chorus of
"Rhinestone Hasher." "We
sing and dance the day away in
cafeteria land." Rhinestone
wears the white hat and always
saves the day. This week he
whipped "Billy Bad'" in a dance
off at the disco, after Billy had
tied the legs of his female com
petitor.
It was now 6:00. We quickly
ran through one last skit before
giving the songs another try.
The talent was rounded up from
surrounding rooms, and the

group set off for Stanford Chil
dren's Hospital.
Billy (Bad) Kemmeries, a
senior class president, gave me
a ride to the hospital, and I final
ly got some idea of what was
happening. Kemmeries and
Dave Jaffe (Rhinestone) are co
masters of ceremonies for the
"Senior Star Show," a presenta
tion given every other Tuedsay
for the patients at Children's
Hospital. This was their 18th
performance. Kemmeries was
psyched for the show. He said,
"Dave and I work so well to
gether. We're high energy, and

we give a lot of love."
At Children's Hospital we
rushed into a conference room,
cleared a stage and set seats in
rows. Gradually, the audience
of kids trickled in. Jaffe and
Kemmeries knew most of them
and traded jokes.
Soon the show started, Jaffe
and Kemmeries opening with a
vaudeville, song and dance
number called "You Gotta Have
Heart." Obviously a tradition,
the kids heckled them madly,
loving every minute of it.

"Billy's Do's and Don'ts of
Dating" was a smash. The kids
learned not to order garlic and
onion pizza on a first date, not to
"jive-talk" a date's parents, not
to pick their nose when given a
ring, never to run off without
kissing the girl goodnight, and.
on the other hand, not to attack.
Yes, they also learned what hap
pens if you don't remember
your car at the drive-in.
The entire show lasted forty
five minutes. Included in the
realm of talent were several
harmonizing Counterpoint
singers, a mime, a ballet
dancer, and a guitarist and pian
ist playing the Beatles.
A classroom skit showed the
evils of seeking revenge, and
Rhinestone Hasher defeated
Billy Bad at the disco contest.
Even I got to make a fool out of
myself at the disco. While danc
ing I heard a little girl in the
front row say, "He'scute, buthe

can't dance worth beans." I felt
like telling her that, yes, I could
type.
The show ended with a reprise
of "You Gotta Have Heart," but
it was half an hour before I could
interview Jaffee or Kem
meries. Both were busy spend
ing time with two friends they
see every two weeks.
Evidently, the two started
giving the shows over a year
ago. They write all of the skits
and coordinate the talent, Kem
meries said the cast was ori
ginally drawn from members of
the senior core and friends, but
that participation is open to all.
You needn't be a senior. Jaffe
noted that members oi the Zete
house are becoming a backbone
of the group. He said, "There's
always a core of four or five
Zetes helping out."
Jaffe and Kemmeries are
both inspired by a desire to help
those who are less fortunate.

Kemmeries said he had always
felt he was "a good Christian,"
but had never acted on his feel
ings. Both said they love what
they are doing. Jaffe said, I'd
love to do the show even if the
kids didn't want us to come."
Kemmeries and Jaffe are
both seniors, and expressed con
cern over the future of the show.
Jaffe said there were a few un
derclassmen already partici
pating, but that the group needs
more.
Kemmeries said the show of
fers "a chance to get out of the
Stanford lifestyle, a chance to
share." He said he wants people
to know how rewarding such a
gesture can be.
I'm convinced. I never had
such a fun interview before. I'll
show up on Tuesday, February
10. even if I have to miss supper
again.
