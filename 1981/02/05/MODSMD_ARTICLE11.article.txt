Last Friday, U.S. District Judge James
Turk issued a restraining order enjoining
Penthouse magazine from distributing an
issue featuring an interview with Rev.
Jerry Falwell of the Moral Majority. Rev.
Falwell claimed that he was misled by two
reporters who promised that the in
terview would not appear in a "porno
graphic magazine." Publication of the
magazine, Falwell pleaded, would cause
irreparable harm to his ministry and repu
tation. He also feared that if his name on
the cover induced anyone to buy the maga
zine that he "would have led somebody to
wrong."
On Monday, the day Penthouse ori
ginally planned to distribute the issue.
District Judge Turk refused to extend the
restraining order. In balancing the in
terest of Falwell and the public, Turk as
serted that "the scales tip decidedly in fa
vor of the public." Turk's refusal clears
the way for Penthouse to resume distribu
tion and requires Falwell to seek damages
only after publication of the interview.
While applauding Judge Turk's decision
to lift the restraining order, the Daily
questions the wisdom of imposing the or

der in the first place. If the government at
tempts to enforce such a prior restraint on
the press, it must show that irreparable
harm would result from publication, and
that the "speech" is not protected by the
First Amendment.
To allow Falwell to enjoy the benefits of
prior restraint without establishing any of
these elements would allow private
citizens and interests even greater
latitude in controlling speech than the pub
lic interest that theoretically motivates
government suits. Clearly, this would
threaten free expression at least as much
as direct government intervention.
Although Penthouse's distribution
schedule was held up for only a few hours,
Turk's initial restraining order sets a dan
gerous precedent. To allow private
citizens to prevent publication, even tem
porarily. is to assert the potential rights of
an individual litigant over the real and de
monstrable rights of press and public.
Whatever the merits of Falwell's cause of
action, they do not merit such a violent as
sault on the right of Penthouse to publish
or of the public to read.
