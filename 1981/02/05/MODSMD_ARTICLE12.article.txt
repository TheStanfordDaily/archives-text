# Take back the night
## 
### 
Attacks and assaults are a problem for
the whole community. Recent assaults of
women on campus, the robbery in the
Quad, and the armed robbery in the park
ing lot near Tresidder are all incidents
that reveal the growing need for com
munity action to combat these crimes.
The Palo Alto YWCA is sponsoring a
'Take Back the Night' march tonight in an
attempt to focus community awareness on
the problem of violent assaults upon wom
en and other victims. The rally is endorsed
by a wide variety of groups, including the
City of Palo Alto, the Stanford Women's
Center, the Mid-Peninsula Support
Network, the National Organization for
Women, the Rape Crisis Center of the
Mid-Peninsula YWCA, Everywoman. and
other community interest organizations.
The Daily supports this effort to in
crease community awareness of the prob

lem of violent crimes, and applauds the
symbol of concern common to Stanford
and the community that the march repre
sents.
Marchers are asked to bring candles or
flashlights and to assemble at a rally in
front of the New Varsity Theater on Uni
versiy Avenue at 5:15 p.m. At 6:15 p.m.,
they will march along University Avenue
and Palm Drive to Kresge Auditorium,
where there will be speakers and enter
tainment at 7:30 p.m.
The march addresses an issue that con
cerns all people and should draw represen
tation from all sections of the community.
Members of the Palo Alto city govern
ment, elderly citizens, families, women,
and students are all affected by the prob
lem of assaults, and the Daily encourages
all members of the Stanford community to
attend some or all of this important event.
