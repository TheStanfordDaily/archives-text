## Remodel America after Stanford 
### 
The country needs something
unique and innovative to solve
its many problems. Yes, there is
a new president, and with some
luck, this president may be able
to do more for the country than
the last president. However,
this president will undoubtedly
try to solve the country's prob
lems in the same manner as all
others.
He will probably try to fidget
around with the money supply,
begin extensive diplomatic
projects with foreign countries,
try to instill new patriotic spirit
into the country in order to
hinder the growing increase in
crime and racism, as well as
other similar acts. While these
measures, if handled correctly,
could be productive, they cer
tainly will not be unique.
In order to truly make people
feel good about themselves and
their environment, the country
needs something really dif
ferent. By this time, you're un
doubtedly thinking, "What
could that something be?" Well
geniuses, you're sitting on it.
That's right. That something
to which I am referring (no, not
your backside) is the old SU,
Stanford University. Someone
should call up the White House,
and say to Ron, "Hey Ron, I
think I know how I can solve all
your problems. Just turn the
whole country into one massive
Stanford University." Ron
would probably reply,
"What?!" (It is left to the
reader to decide whether this
reply would stem from Old
Ron's recent inability to hear
very well, or from his surprise
at the idea.) The caller would
then have to say, "Yes, Ron.
You heard correctly. Just ex
tend the boundaries of Stanford
University a little bit so that one
side of campus extends to the
Pacific Ocean, and the other
side extends to the Atlantic, and
you will soon find that this coun
try will be a much better
place."
I promise you that while
Ron's initial reaction would
probably not be that positive,
eventually a Noble Peace Prize
would be in the bag.
Just consider how simple life
would become if this country
transformed into a huge Stan
ford campus. Economic prob
lems? Of course not. Everyone
would just need $10,000 a year to
live. And if certain people could
not handle that, in this new Stan
ford country the government
would surely be able to put peo
ple on scholarship

Problems with foreign
powers? Nonexistent. In the
Stanford tradition, anytime the
country has problems with its
rivals, it can simply construct
some new buildings in Washing
ton, thereby attracting the lead
ers of those foreign powers to
come over to the Stanford side.
Of course, there could poten
tially be a decrease in the
number of new babies born in
this new country. If the Stanford
spirit were to become om
nipresent, there would definite
ly be a decrease in sexual activi
ty. Sex would just have to be
come one of those things that
everyone talks about, but that
few people do. I'm sorry; that is
just a Stanford fact of life.
Having been convinced of the
vast advantages of trans
forming the country into a big
Stanford, you are now probably
wondering how one could possi
bly turn the U.S.A. into the
U.S.S R. (United Stanford Stu
dents Republic).
As difficult as it may seem,
this transition would not be very
complicated. In fact, a project
of this type has already taken
place in what was once a vol
atile, violent prison in New
Mexico. A few months ago, the
prison had a particularly violent
prison revolution. The warden
was desperate for a solution to
the destructive attitude that ex
isted among the prisoners. A re
liable party (yours truly) sug
gested to him that he turn his
jail into a Stanford jail.
The project was simple. The
prison corridors were lined with
palm trees, volleyball courts
were put into the recreation
area, the prison uniform was
changed into jeans and a Stan
ford sweatshirt, and other acts
were undertaken that would
enable the prison to have a Stan
ford-like appearance.
Finally, and this was the most
important part of the whole
project, the prisoners were
forced to view films about Stan
ford life. The films, which
showed a typical student,
Stanley Ford, doing various
things around campus, were
shown to the prisoners con
tinually for a full month. By the
end of this month, the prisoners
were actually beginning to
think, act and even look like
Stanford students.
I know this sounds absurd.
However, one must take into ac
count the powerful effect that
Stanford can have on people.
From even the most indirect ex
posure, a person can "catch the

Stanford spirit" and will begin
to act like a Stanford student.
For example, I recall what hap
pened to me when I received my
acceptance letter from Stanford
two years ago. For some unex
plainable reason, for about five
days after receiving the letter, I
felt a compulsion to wear red
and white clothes. If a letter can
have this effect, one can im
agine the strong effect that
films can have.
Anyway, a couple months af
ter Project "Stanford Jail" had
begun, I received a letter from
the warden, who, I later dis
covered, had dyed his hair
black, and who had begun to ex
tent invitations to all prison
guards and attack dogs to jog
with him at 6:30 a.m. Tuesdays
and Thursdays. He informed me
that the project was a smashing
success. The prisoners had all
become inspired, creative peo
ple. He said the progress in the
vocational classes had been en
thusiasm, which he guessed ori
ginated from the fact that it had
bcome fashionable in the jail to
have a tan.
In order to do Project Stan
ford on a larger scale, it would
simply be necessary to deluge
people with Stanford material.
One would have to change the
subjects of all television, radio,
plays and movies so that they
were related to Stanford. For
example, the hit movie in this
new country would be Raging
Hio Major, a story about Bill
Frank, a pre-med student, and
his difficult battle to the top of
his biology class. Instead of a
television commercial telling
people to "catch the pepsi spir
it" while showing kids playing
volleyball on a beach, there
would be a commercial in which
one would listen to happy voices
singing "Catch the Stanford
spirit," while concurrently
seeing students pounding away
at the books at Green Library.
With material like this being
included in the media, people
would inevitably begin to act
like Stanford students.
Finally, think of the celebrity
status that would come to all of
us, authentic and original Stan
ford students. We would become
instant idols.
Of course, the ASSU would
have to change their famous T
shirts. The rivalry between
Stanford and Harvard would no
longer exist because the latter
would be engulfed by the
former. No, the main rivalry
would then be one between Stan
ford and the rest of the world.

This instead of what they for
merly said, the new ASSU T
shirts would say, "Russia, The
Stanford of the East."
And so, as I said before, the
1981 Nobel Peace Prize is a
guaranteed honor for anyone
who will suggest "Project Stan
ford" to the White House. My
modesty prohibits me from
doing it myself. However, any
one else has my blessings. I
should say that if someone is
willing to call Ron, he should do
it quickly. I hear that some cold
weather creatures on the East
Coast are having similar ideas
about a national trans
formation. How would you like
to live in a country called
"Princeton Interstate Student
Society," otherwise known as
P.I.S.S.
(Michael Weiss is an un
declared sophomore.)

the last president. However,
this president will undoubtedly
try to solve the country's prob
lems in the same manner as all
others.
He will probably try to fidget
around with the money supply,
begin extensive diplomatic
projects with foreign countries,
try to instill new patriotic spirit
into the country in order to
hinder the growing increase in
crime and racism, as well as
other similar acts. While these
measures, if handled correctly,
could be productive, they cer
tainly will not be unique.
In order to truly make people
feel good about themselves and
their environment, the country
needs something really dif
ferent. By this time, you're un
doubtedly thinking, "What
could that something be?" Well
geniuses, you're sitting on it.
That's right. That something
to which I am referring (no, not
your backside) is the old SU,
Stanford University. Someone
should call up the White House,
and say to Ron, "Hey Ron, I
think I know how I can solve all
your problems. Just turn the
whole country into one massive
Stanford University." Ron
would probably reply,
"What?!" (It is left to the
reader to decide whether this
reply would stem from Old
Ron's recent inability to hear
very well, or from his surprise
at the idea.) The caller would
then have to say, "Yes, Ron.
You heard correctly. Just ex
tend the boundaries of Stanford
University a little bit so that one
side of campus extends to the
Pacific Ocean, and the other
side extends to the Atlantic, and
you will soon find that this coun
try will be a much better
place."
I promise you that while
Ron's initial reaction would
probably not be that positive,
eventually a Noble Peace Prize
would be in the bag.
Just consider how simple life
would become if this country
transformed into a huge Stan
ford campus. Economic prob
lems? Of course not. Everyone
would just need $10,000 a year to
live. And if certain people could
not handle that, in this new Stan
ford country the government
would surely be able to put peo
ple on scholarship

Problems with foreign
powers? Nonexistent. In the
Stanford tradition, anytime the
country has problems with its
rivals, it can simply construct
some new buildings in Washing
ton, thereby attracting the lead
ers of those foreign powers to
come over to the Stanford side.
Of course, there could poten
tially be a decrease in the
number of new babies born in
this new country. If the Stanford
spirit were to become om
nipresent, there would definite
ly be a decrease in sexual activi
ty. Sex would just have to be
come one of those things that
everyone talks about, but that
few people do. I'm sorry; that is
just a Stanford fact of life.
Having been convinced of the
vast advantages of trans
forming the country into a big
Stanford, you are now probably
wondering how one could possi
bly turn the U.S.A. into the
U.S.S R. (United Stanford Stu
dents Republic).
As difficult as it may seem,
this transition would not be very
complicated. In fact, a project
of this type has already taken
place in what was once a vol
atile, violent prison in New
Mexico. A few months ago, the
prison had a particularly violent
prison revolution. The warden
was desperate for a solution to
the destructive attitude that ex
isted among the prisoners. A re
liable party (yours truly) sug
gested to him that he turn his
jail into a Stanford jail.
The project was simple. The
prison corridors were lined with
palm trees, volleyball courts
were put into the recreation
area, the prison uniform was
changed into jeans and a Stan
ford sweatshirt, and other acts
were undertaken that would
enable the prison to have a Stan
ford-like appearance.
Finally, and this was the most
important part of the whole
project, the prisoners were
forced to view films about Stan
ford life. The films, which
showed a typical student,
Stanley Ford, doing various
things around campus, were
shown to the prisoners con
tinually for a full month. By the
end of this month, the prisoners
were actually beginning to
think, act and even look like
Stanford students.
I know this sounds absurd.
However, one must take into ac
count the powerful effect that
Stanford can have on people.
From even the most indirect ex
posure, a person can "catch the

Stanford spirit" and will begin
to act like a Stanford student.
For example, I recall what hap
pened to me when I received my
acceptance letter from Stanford
two years ago. For some unex
plainable reason, for about five
days after receiving the letter, I
felt a compulsion to wear red
and white clothes. If a letter can
have this effect, one can im
agine the strong effect that
films can have.
Anyway, a couple months af
ter Project "Stanford Jail" had
begun, I received a letter from
the warden, who, I later dis
covered, had dyed his hair
black, and who had begun to ex
tent invitations to all prison
guards and attack dogs to jog
with him at 6:30 a.m. Tuesdays
and Thursdays. He informed me
that the project was a smashing
success. The prisoners had all
become inspired, creative peo
ple. He said the progress in the
vocational classes had been en
thusiasm, which he guessed ori
ginated from the fact that it had
bcome fashionable in the jail to
have a tan.
In order to do Project Stan
ford on a larger scale, it would
simply be necessary to deluge
people with Stanford material.
One would have to change the
subjects of all television, radio,
plays and movies so that they
were related to Stanford. For
example, the hit movie in this
new country would be Raging
Hio Major, a story about Bill
Frank, a pre-med student, and
his difficult battle to the top of
his biology class. Instead of a
television commercial telling
people to "catch the pepsi spir
it" while showing kids playing
volleyball on a beach, there
would be a commercial in which
one would listen to happy voices
singing "Catch the Stanford
spirit," while concurrently
seeing students pounding away
at the books at Green Library.
With material like this being
included in the media, people
would inevitably begin to act
like Stanford students.
Finally, think of the celebrity
status that would come to all of
us, authentic and original Stan
ford students. We would become
instant idols.
Of course, the ASSU would
have to change their famous T
shirts. The rivalry between
Stanford and Harvard would no
longer exist because the latter
would be engulfed by the
former. No, the main rivalry
would then be one between Stan
ford and the rest of the world.

This instead of what they for
merly said, the new ASSU T
shirts would say, "Russia, The
Stanford of the East."
And so, as I said before, the
1981 Nobel Peace Prize is a
guaranteed honor for anyone
who will suggest "Project Stan
ford" to the White House. My
modesty prohibits me from
doing it myself. However, any
one else has my blessings. I
should say that if someone is
willing to call Ron, he should do
it quickly. I hear that some cold
weather creatures on the East
Coast are having similar ideas
about a national trans
formation. How would you like
to live in a country called
"Princeton Interstate Student
Society," otherwise known as
P.I.S.S.
(Michael Weiss is an un
declared sophomore.)
The country needs something
unique and innovative to solve
its many problems. Yes, there is

begin extensive diplomatic
projects with foreign countries,
try to instill new patriotic spirit
into the country in order to
hinder the growing increase in
crime and racism, as well as
other similar acts. While these
measures, if handled correctly,
could be productive, they cer
tainly will not be unique.
In order to truly make people
feel good about themselves and
their environment, the country
needs something really dif
ferent. By this time, you're un
doubtedly thinking, "What
could that something be?" Well
geniuses, you're sitting on it.
That's right. That something
to which I am referring (no, not
your backside) is the old SU,
Stanford University. Someone
should call up the White House,
and say to Ron, "Hey Ron, I
think I know how I can solve all
your problems. Just turn the
whole country into one massive
Stanford University." Ron
would probably reply,
"What?!" (It is left to the
reader to decide whether this
reply would stem from Old
Ron's recent inability to hear
very well, or from his surprise
at the idea.) The caller would
then have to say, "Yes, Ron.
You heard correctly. Just ex
tend the boundaries of Stanford
University a little bit so that one
side of campus extends to the
Pacific Ocean, and the other
side extends to the Atlantic, and
you will soon find that this coun
try will be a much better
place."
I promise you that while
Ron's initial reaction would
probably not be that positive,
eventually a Noble Peace Prize
would be in the bag.
Just consider how simple life
would become if this country
transformed into a huge Stan
ford campus. Economic prob
lems? Of course not. Everyone
would just need $10,000 a year to
live. And if certain people could
not handle that, in this new Stan
ford country the government
would surely be able to put peo
ple on scholarship

Problems with foreign
powers? Nonexistent. In the
Stanford tradition, anytime the
country has problems with its
rivals, it can simply construct
some new buildings in Washing
ton, thereby attracting the lead
ers of those foreign powers to
come over to the Stanford side.
Of course, there could poten
tially be a decrease in the
number of new babies born in
this new country. If the Stanford
spirit were to become om
nipresent, there would definite
ly be a decrease in sexual activi
ty. Sex would just have to be
come one of those things that
everyone talks about, but that
few people do. I'm sorry; that is
just a Stanford fact of life.
Having been convinced of the
vast advantages of trans
forming the country into a big
Stanford, you are now probably
wondering how one could possi
bly turn the U.S.A. into the
U.S.S R. (United Stanford Stu
dents Republic).
As difficult as it may seem,
this transition would not be very
complicated. In fact, a project
of this type has already taken
place in what was once a vol
atile, violent prison in New
Mexico. A few months ago, the
prison had a particularly violent
prison revolution. The warden
was desperate for a solution to
the destructive attitude that ex
isted among the prisoners. A re
liable party (yours truly) sug
gested to him that he turn his
jail into a Stanford jail.
The project was simple. The
prison corridors were lined with
palm trees, volleyball courts
were put into the recreation
area, the prison uniform was
changed into jeans and a Stan
ford sweatshirt, and other acts
were undertaken that would
enable the prison to have a Stan
ford-like appearance.
Finally, and this was the most
important part of the whole
project, the prisoners were
forced to view films about Stan
ford life. The films, which
showed a typical student,
Stanley Ford, doing various
things around campus, were
shown to the prisoners con
tinually for a full month. By the
end of this month, the prisoners
were actually beginning to
think, act and even look like
Stanford students.
I know this sounds absurd.
However, one must take into ac
count the powerful effect that
Stanford can have on people.
From even the most indirect ex
posure, a person can "catch the

Stanford spirit" and will begin
to act like a Stanford student.
For example, I recall what hap
pened to me when I received my
acceptance letter from Stanford
two years ago. For some unex
plainable reason, for about five
days after receiving the letter, I
felt a compulsion to wear red
and white clothes. If a letter can
have this effect, one can im
agine the strong effect that
films can have.
Anyway, a couple months af
ter Project "Stanford Jail" had
begun, I received a letter from
the warden, who, I later dis
covered, had dyed his hair
black, and who had begun to ex
tent invitations to all prison
guards and attack dogs to jog
with him at 6:30 a.m. Tuesdays
and Thursdays. He informed me
that the project was a smashing
success. The prisoners had all
become inspired, creative peo
ple. He said the progress in the
vocational classes had been en
thusiasm, which he guessed ori
ginated from the fact that it had
bcome fashionable in the jail to
have a tan.
In order to do Project Stan
ford on a larger scale, it would
simply be necessary to deluge
people with Stanford material.
One would have to change the
subjects of all television, radio,
plays and movies so that they
were related to Stanford. For
example, the hit movie in this
new country would be Raging
Hio Major, a story about Bill
Frank, a pre-med student, and
his difficult battle to the top of
his biology class. Instead of a
television commercial telling
people to "catch the pepsi spir
it" while showing kids playing
volleyball on a beach, there
would be a commercial in which
one would listen to happy voices
singing "Catch the Stanford
spirit," while concurrently
seeing students pounding away
at the books at Green Library.
With material like this being
included in the media, people
would inevitably begin to act
like Stanford students.
Finally, think of the celebrity
status that would come to all of
us, authentic and original Stan
ford students. We would become
instant idols.
Of course, the ASSU would
have to change their famous T
shirts. The rivalry between
Stanford and Harvard would no
longer exist because the latter
would be engulfed by the
former. No, the main rivalry
would then be one between Stan
ford and the rest of the world.

This instead of what they for
merly said, the new ASSU T
shirts would say, "Russia, The
Stanford of the East."
And so, as I said before, the
1981 Nobel Peace Prize is a
guaranteed honor for anyone
who will suggest "Project Stan
ford" to the White House. My
modesty prohibits me from
doing it myself. However, any
one else has my blessings. I
should say that if someone is
willing to call Ron, he should do
it quickly. I hear that some cold
weather creatures on the East
Coast are having similar ideas
about a national trans
formation. How would you like
to live in a country called
"Princeton Interstate Student
Society," otherwise known as
P.I.S.S.
