## Graduate goal: 'employed' scholarship 
### 
Harry Mairson, a graduate
student in computer science,
has just published an article
(Daily, Jan. 23) concerned the
state of our priorities vis-a-vis
education. Mairson raises sev
eral vital and unanswered
(albeit answerable) questions.
He seems incensed that the Uni
versity should neglect and con
tinue to adopt a policy of near in
difference toward the levels of
support offered to humanities
and social sciences graduates
fellows. Given years ago,
stipends in the humanities were
91 percent of what Stanford esti
mated their needs to be. This
year that support is 76 percent.
And incensed he should be! In
censed we all should be if we are
to hope in the least for a return
to graduate schools which truly
foster independent thinkers, to
scholarship which can grow as it
once did to the point of becom
ing "employed" scholarship,
and most of all to an educational
or humanistic ideal nearer to
the top of the University's aims
than one finds at the present.
As Mairson puts it, "Why
should anyone pay thousands of
dollars a year to be a humanities

or social sciences graduate stu
dent at Stanford, especially
when the academic job pros
pects are so bleak?" The im
mediate reason, which is
always worth repeating, is that
graduate students have chose
their field because of their com
mitment to scholarship and
teaching. But ironically, there
are "worse" reasons for which
they endure the increasing sup
port of neglect within the uni
versity so that they may con
tinue their studies.
The irony is not only that hu
manities and social science
graduate students have tradi
tionally cared little about how
and in some cases if, they sur
vive. There are ways for the
graduate students to survive on
their stipends. But for any of
these alternatives to work, addi
tional funds are required. Extra
resources most often turned to
include the follow: marriage
and support from a spouse; pa
rental support; jobs beyond
their teaching requirements, al
though any work done over 10
hrs./wk. is against a rule
created and maintained by Stan
ford's own administration; stu
dent loans, an option which
merely compounds — daily —
the problem because human
ities students run the highest
risk of not being able to pay
these enormous sums back
since jobs are so few in number
and so low in salary; eating un
usually large amounts of starch.
Most of these people still opt
for some combination of the op
tions listed above. They will ac
cept the irony of this moral
prostitution in spite of them
selves, in spite of their beliefs
and hopes for the future of in
dependant thinkers within the
University. Most of them will
opt for these short-term
crutches, in spite of the job mar
ket which is rapidly becoming
worse than bleak, simply be
cause it is the last of few options
afforded to a group of people
whose business has long been to
avoid business.
It is not new to the humanities
that its Scholars and fellows ac
quiesce to the hard-pressed and
hard-lined business decisions
which neglect and thereby af
flict them. But what is relative
ly new is the danger of the Uni
versity turning corporate. This
new threat to the future of the

University should be enough of a
catalyst for our acquiescence to
be sublimated. It is time to
agree that the act of accepting
in gesture without necessarily
agreeing with in principle, is
tantamout in its unacceptability
to the current level of support
for the humanities.
At this crucial point in our
academic careers, ac
quiescence is as effective as an
abstention in a vote in which the
abstainer has not even been in
vited to participate. For just a
few moments in these careers,
we must make it heard through
out this university that mimetic
processes working here are
coming dangerously too close to
imitating corporate strucures,
in which case, scholarship and
teaching are seen to play a mi
nor role. The University must
be awakened to the reality that
their true option is not between
education or corporation, but
rather an option which has no
option at all: education or
education.
Let us not forget the privi
leged role Stanford plays in the
world. Has Stanford not earned
this role over the years because
the University has preserved
true academic standards, pre
cedents and excellence in the
wake of germs and genes that
would have had it otherwise if
left uncontrolled? Where do the
current precedents for educa
tion here at Stanford lie?
Mairson is most correct to
plant the seeds of vital questions
such as these in all of us. I feel
compelled to repeat his same
questions here, in the hopes that
they reiterate concerns that
many of us would express in
some form or another: "Where
are Stanford's priorities? . . .
What is Stanford doing cutting
academics (from the budget)
while it continues paving roads,
and building dormitories and
other building? ... If Stanford
decided that the support of grad
uate students was the number
one priority (and I don't believe
it should be), don't you think
they would be well supported?
Of course."
"Now relax that priority:

does the status quo really in
dicate what the administration
thinks of graduate students?"
To these urgent and fundamen
tal questions, we must all
muster some sort of response if
our common hope is to see the
University remain a place of
learning, scholarship and
teaching. Just because a large
yet modest sector of the Univer
sity is trapped (admittedly by
themselves in large measure,
by their own financial short
sightedness), it does not mean
that neglecting their plight will
erase the problem any quicker
than the school the students rep
resent will be erased from the
budget.
On the contrary, it would be
only then that the real problems
for the University would occur,
for only then will the genes for
the arts be lost by castration.
Let's not forget that we have
here and now at Stanford, as in
other Universities across the
country, a group of humanistic
minded people, many of whom
are devoted to their work to let
material worries bother their
love for knowledge. For these
people, the fifth option left to
them by the current system of
priorities — starch — is grossly
commensurate with their
needs.
But we should also be re
minded that this type of diet can
become quite heavy after a
while. Soon, much sooner than
we could have ever imagined,
people begin to drown in their
devotion, taking with them fel
low students, professors, gradu
ate schools, administrators,
hope for independent thinking
and education for the sake of
knowledge. The list only gets
worse. Do we want to simply ac
quiesce to unquestioned policy
while the graduate students of
the humanities struggle to re
main an endangered species?
Can any of us afford their
absence especially knowing
that we have condoned their sys
tematic extinction?

ly new is the danger of the Uni
versity turning corporate. This
new threat to the future of the

University should be enough of a
catalyst for our acquiescence to
be sublimated. It is time to
agree that the act of accepting
in gesture without necessarily
agreeing with in principle, is
tantamout in its unacceptability
to the current level of support
for the humanities.
At this crucial point in our
academic careers, ac
quiescence is as effective as an
abstention in a vote in which the
abstainer has not even been in
vited to participate. For just a
few moments in these careers,
we must make it heard through
out this university that mimetic
processes working here are
coming dangerously too close to
imitating corporate strucures,
in which case, scholarship and
teaching are seen to play a mi
nor role. The University must
be awakened to the reality that
their true option is not between
education or corporation, but
rather an option which has no
option at all: education or
education.
Let us not forget the privi
leged role Stanford plays in the
world. Has Stanford not earned
this role over the years because
the University has preserved
true academic standards, pre
cedents and excellence in the
wake of germs and genes that
would have had it otherwise if
left uncontrolled? Where do the
current precedents for educa
tion here at Stanford lie?
Mairson is most correct to
plant the seeds of vital questions
such as these in all of us. I feel
compelled to repeat his same
questions here, in the hopes that
they reiterate concerns that
many of us would express in
some form or another: "Where
are Stanford's priorities? . . .
What is Stanford doing cutting
academics (from the budget)
while it continues paving roads,
and building dormitories and
other building? ... If Stanford
decided that the support of grad
uate students was the number
one priority (and I don't believe
it should be), don't you think
they would be well supported?
Of course."
"Now relax that priority:

does the status quo really in
dicate what the administration
thinks of graduate students?"
To these urgent and fundamen
tal questions, we must all
muster some sort of response if
our common hope is to see the
University remain a place of
learning, scholarship and
teaching. Just because a large
yet modest sector of the Univer
sity is trapped (admittedly by
themselves in large measure,
by their own financial short
sightedness), it does not mean
that neglecting their plight will
erase the problem any quicker
than the school the students rep
resent will be erased from the
budget.
On the contrary, it would be
only then that the real problems
for the University would occur,
for only then will the genes for
the arts be lost by castration.
Let's not forget that we have
here and now at Stanford, as in
other Universities across the
country, a group of humanistic
minded people, many of whom
are devoted to their work to let
material worries bother their
love for knowledge. For these
people, the fifth option left to
them by the current system of
priorities — starch — is grossly
commensurate with their
needs.
But we should also be re
minded that this type of diet can
become quite heavy after a
while. Soon, much sooner than
we could have ever imagined,
people begin to drown in their
devotion, taking with them fel
low students, professors, gradu
ate schools, administrators,
hope for independent thinking
and education for the sake of
knowledge. The list only gets
worse. Do we want to simply ac
quiesce to unquestioned policy
while the graduate students of
the humanities struggle to re
main an endangered species?
Can any of us afford their
absence especially knowing
that we have condoned their sys
tematic extinction?
(Scott Hartstein is a graduate
student majoring in French and
Italian).
Harry Mairson, a graduate
student in computer science,
has just published an article
(Daily, Jan. 23) concerned the
state of our priorities vis-a-vis
education. Mairson raises sev
eral vital and unanswered
(albeit answerable) questions.
He seems incensed that the Uni
versity should neglect and con
tinue to adopt a policy of near in
difference toward the levels of
support offered to humanities
and social sciences graduates
fellows. Given years ago,
stipends in the humanities were
91 percent of what Stanford esti
mated their needs to be. This
year that support is 76 percent.
And incensed he should be! In
censed we all should be if we are
to hope in the least for a return
to graduate schools which truly
foster independent thinkers, to
scholarship which can grow as it
once did to the point of becom
ing "employed" scholarship,
and most of all to an educational
or humanistic ideal nearer to
the top of the University's aims
than one finds at the present.
As Mairson puts it, "Why
should anyone pay thousands of
dollars a year to be a humanities

or social sciences graduate stu
dent at Stanford, especially
when the academic job pros
pects are so bleak?" The im
mediate reason, which is
always worth repeating, is that
graduate students have chose
their field because of their com
mitment to scholarship and
teaching. But ironically, there
are "worse" reasons for which
they endure the increasing sup
port of neglect within the uni
versity so that they may con
tinue their studies.
The irony is not only that hu
manities and social science
graduate students have tradi
tionally cared little about how
and in some cases if, they sur
vive. There are ways for the
graduate students to survive on
their stipends. But for any of
these alternatives to work, addi
tional funds are required. Extra
resources most often turned to
include the follow: marriage
and support from a spouse; pa
rental support; jobs beyond
their teaching requirements, al
though any work done over 10
hrs./wk. is against a rule
created and maintained by Stan
ford's own administration; stu
dent loans, an option which
merely compounds — daily —
the problem because human
ities students run the highest
risk of not being able to pay
these enormous sums back
since jobs are so few in number
and so low in salary; eating un
usually large amounts of starch.
Most of these people still opt
for some combination of the op
tions listed above. They will ac
cept the irony of this moral
prostitution in spite of them
selves, in spite of their beliefs
and hopes for the future of in
dependant thinkers within the
University. Most of them will
opt for these short-term
crutches, in spite of the job mar
ket which is rapidly becoming
worse than bleak, simply be
cause it is the last of few options
afforded to a group of people
whose business has long been to
avoid business.
It is not new to the humanities
that its Scholars and fellows ac
quiesce to the hard-pressed and
hard-lined business decisions
which neglect and thereby af
flict them. But what is relative
ly new is the danger of the Uni
versity turning corporate. This
new threat to the future of the

University should be enough of a

But we should also be re
minded that this type of diet can
become quite heavy after a
while. Soon, much sooner than
we could have ever imagined,
people begin to drown in their
devotion, taking with them fel
low students, professors, gradu
ate schools, administrators,
hope for independent thinking
and education for the sake of
knowledge. The list only gets
worse. Do we want to simply ac
quiesce to unquestioned policy
while the graduate students of
the humanities struggle to re
main an endangered species?
Can any of us afford their
absence especially knowing
that we have condoned their sys
tematic extinction?
