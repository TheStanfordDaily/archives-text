Women not 'things'
John Halamka's projection
into the future is not only exag
gerated and overly sarcastic but
displays his naive (not yet
sophomoric) mentality in in
terpreting this women's move
ment as aiming to reduce both
men, women and even the no
tion of God, to "things."
His semantic argument,
which surely he agrees leads to
an absurd conclusion, carries
him well beyond the goals in
tended by feminists in interpret
ing history. I agree that we
should not deny history, and we
certainly cannot and should not
write it. But an attempt at un
derstanding history in a way
which is consistant with present
societal values is, I feel, com
mendable and very useful in re
flecting the modern needs of our
world society.
The women's movement is an
attempt at moving beyond his
torical norms as a way of life, to
a mentality which draws upon
all of our human resources, es
pecially in this crisis period
when resources are scarce.
Women have proven that they
are a vital resource to the future
of humanity as a whole, not only
because of our biological
capabilities, but based on our
sensitive, creative and some
times revolutionary ambitions
which are aimed at making his
tory and changing norms.
We have confronted the past
by striking out against the re
strictions placed upon us by men

and society, and have made our
own "herstory." Without collec
tive motivations for improve
ments in society, such as the
women's movement, civil
rights and even the rebel Ameri
can colonists, humanity
stagnates, never applying the
lessons of history.
Women have shown that we
can succeed in many roles, and
in fact, that the new positions
we have established for
ourselves are vital to a
progressive and productive so
ciety. Many Third World na
tions, for example face fun
damental problems in develop
ment due, in part, to the un
liberated positions of women in
society as merely childbearers
and as prisoners to a rural life
style.
Lack of education, health
care and employment of wom
en, in particular, are some of
the major contributors to ex
cessive population growth and
economic stagnation in these
countries. My point is that rele
vant economic and social
growth is enhanced by the
emancipation of women in socir
ety, as well as being an end in
itself.
The goal of the feminist
movement, in my interpreta
tion, is not merely semantic
equality, but equality of respect
for women's abilities beyond
that of childbearing, and re
spect for women as people, a
perfectly descriptive word, and
as individuals, not as things.
