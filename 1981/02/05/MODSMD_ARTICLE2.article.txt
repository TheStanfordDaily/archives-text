# President opposes staff unionization

Calling unionization a "mistake."
President Donald Kennedy sent a let
ter to faculty and staff here last week
stating his opposition to potential un
ions for Stanford's office workers.
The letter came after an announce
ment by the National Labor Relations
Board that set May 7 as the date for a
University-wide vote to decide if the
office staff here will be represented by
the United Stanford Employees
(USE).
Acknowledging that the University
does have "problems involving salary
levels, benefits, career opportunities
and working conditions for office and
library support staff," Kennedy wrote
that "unions don't automatically solve
these problems."
Opposition expected
Union organizers said they were ex
pecting the University to begin public
ly opposing unionization here. Kathy
McKennan. a staff organizer for Un
ion Local 715, said that although some
people were "surprised that he (Ken
nedy ) wrote it since he has quite a rep
utation as a liberal," she saw it as a
typical "union-busting letter."
Joyce Tipps-Coates, a secretary at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter who chairs the Office Staff Or
ganizing Committee (OSOC), said
that she was "encouraged that the let
ter agrees with what we have been
saying about problems at the Univer
sity." But she said she feels that the
letter is the "start of a vigorous anti
union campaign designed to put us in a
defensive position."
The administration strongly denied
that it is out to break the unions.
Priscilla Wheeler, Stanford's manag
ing attorney for labor, points out that
"it is not union-breaking to give your
opinion and the University will con
tinue doing this in the future to ensure
that no one is coerced in any way."
Wheeler argued that unions are not
necessary here because "employees
can bring problems directly to their
employers" through the existing sys
tem.
No rhetoric
This is the position the University
will maintain throughout the coming
weeks, according to Wheeler, and
"there will be no rhetoric from the
University. We want to ensure that
everyone makes a free and uncoerced
choice."
Kennedy argued against the unions
on the grounds that they "don't create
more revenue for the University to
pay higher salaries. They don't make

a few poor supervisors better, and
they don't decide what work is to be
done."
"Ultimately," he wrote, "the Uni
versity has to deal with these issues."
Most secretaries and office workers
said they doubt that the University
will confront their problems without
pressure from the union, despite the
promise to seek "solutions" in Ken
nedy's letter.
Union leverage
One secretary, noting that she has
been working here for 10 years, said
that "things are pretty much the same
and I don't think Kennedy will do that
much to change them." She said that
presently there is "no one to nego
tiate" for her and she wanted the
"leverage of a union to get a better
salary."
Other reactions towards the letter
included "it is natural that the man
agement be opposed to the union
and "this is the first tactic in trying to
prevent another union at Stanford."
Although a few secretaries ac
knowledged that they supported Ken
nedy's position, few were willing to
make a statement. Mildred Nilsson, a
Stanford employee of 17 years and
president of the secretaries' Distaff
Club, said she doesn't believe that
"the unionization of the University is
the right way to solve its problems."
She said she feels that those who
support the union have usually only
been here "two or three years, not
long enough to know how the organiza
tion can operate."
Insufficient reason
Nilsson contends that no big com
panies in the area have unionized of
fice help and says that increased
salaries are not a sufficient reason to
introduce unions here.
Tipps-Coates emphasized the irony
in the mailing of the letter. "The letter
goes against us. but we're asked to dis
tribute it." Diane McCubbin. an office
assistant at the Hoover Institution,
echoed this sentiment, saying. "It's
terrible. OSOC doesn't have the mate
rials, time, money, or staff to put out a
letter like that but the University can
use the time of people whoprobably
support the union."
While not all secretaries support the
union, many believe it is the only
means of gaining true recognition
from the University. As one secretary
said, "other organizations are even
harder to get recognized. A union is
one of the few vehicles that is legally
accepted."
