# Poles face 'intractable' problems
## 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland — The
summer sunshine in which
Poland basked during the ex
citing days of last August has
given way to winter slush.
The popular mood has
changed significantly too —
from heady optimism over a
new social experiment to un
certainty over the future
caused by the lack of any ob
vious long-term solution to
the country's intractable
problems.
As soon as one potentially
disastrous dispute is de
capitated. several more rise
like hydras in its place. Thus,
after threats from the inde
pendent trade union move
ment. Solidarity, of a general
strike and from the govern
ment of emergency meas
ures to keep production
going, a settlement was
reached last week over
shorter working hours and
greater access for the union
to the news media. Now at
tention has switched to

peasants demands for regis
tration of their own union,
the battle over the new
censorship law. and un
coordinated wildcat strikes
by local Solidarity branches
When the Gdansk agree
ment between the Polish
government and striking
workers was signed just over
five months ago, it was
hailed as a new social con
tract between rulers and
ruled It was clear that cen
tralized authoritarian rule
was unable to cope with the
demands of a sophisticated,
pluralistic society. The tired
old system had broken down
in the face of massive popu
lar discontent: something
different had to be con
structed in its place.
The reasons for the conti
nuing tension are complex —
and vary according to the
people to whom one talks.
Communist officials put the
blame on the obduracy of lo
cal Solidarity chapters and
militants within the union's

national leadership, accus
ing them of irresponsibility
and pushing the country
toward economic chaos. Soli
darity members blame the
authorities for failing to
adapt to a new political situ
ation and seeking to gradu
ally whittle away the union's
gains
A complicating factor is
that Poland's search for a
new political equilibrium is
taking place under external
constraints. Under the rules
of the game, accepted by
both sides in view of Poland's
geographic position, the
Communist Party has to re
main in power Inevitably its
freedom to maneuver is lim
ited.
Another problem is that
last summer's agreements
were negotiated under
enormous pressure and left
many loopholes for subse
quent misunderstandings.
Predictably enough, each
side interprets the accords
differently. The agreement

with coalminers in Silesia,
for example, unequivocably
promised a 40-hour week
starting Jan. 1 — but failed to
make clear whether this ap
plied to the whole country
(as Solidarity claims >or just
the miners (as the govern
ment argues).
A more fundamental ex
planation for the impasse is
that, given the scale of last
year's upheavals, it was un
reasonable to expect social
tensions to disappear merely
by signing a piece of paper. It
takes time to replace a sys
tem of government that has
been discredited and there is
bound to be conflict during
the transitional phase.
The real questions that
need to be answered there
fore are how much more
time does Poland have — and
how much conflict is com
patible with continued com
munist rule.
