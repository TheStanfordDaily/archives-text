# Poles face 'intractable' problems
## 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland — The
summer sunshine in which
Poland basked during the ex
citing days of last August has
given way to winter slush.
The popular mood has
changed significantly too —
from heady optimism over a
new social experiment to un
certainty over the future
caused by the lack of any ob
vious long-term solution to
the country's intractable
problems.
As soon as one potentially
disastrous dispute is de
capitated. several more rise
like hydras in its place. Thus,
after threats from the inde
pendent trade union move
ment. Solidarity, of a general
strike and from the govern
ment of emergency meas
ures to keep production
going, a settlement was
reached last week over
shorter working hours and
greater access for the union
to the news media. Now at
tention has switched to

peasants demands for regis
tration of their own union,
the battle over the new
censorship law. and un
coordinated wildcat strikes
by local Solidarity branches
When the Gdansk agree
ment between the Polish
government and striking
workers was signed just over
five months ago, it was
hailed as a new social con
tract between rulers and
ruled It was clear that cen
tralized authoritarian rule
was unable to cope with the
demands of a sophisticated,
pluralistic society. The tired
old system had broken down
in the face of massive popu
lar discontent: something
different had to be con
structed in its place.
The reasons for the conti
nuing tension are complex —
and vary according to the
people to whom one talks.
Communist officials put the
blame on the obduracy of lo
cal Solidarity chapters and
militants within the union's

national leadership, accus
ing them of irresponsibility
and pushing the country
toward economic chaos. Soli
darity members blame the
authorities for failing to
adapt to a new political situ
ation and seeking to gradu
ally whittle away the union's
gains
A complicating factor is
that Poland's search for a
new political equilibrium is
taking place under external
constraints. Under the rules
of the game, accepted by
both sides in view of Poland's
geographic position, the
Communist Party has to re
main in power Inevitably its
freedom to maneuver is lim
ited.
Another problem is that
last summer's agreements
were negotiated under
enormous pressure and left
many loopholes for subse
quent misunderstandings.
Predictably enough, each
side interprets the accords
differently. The agreement

with coalminers in Silesia,
for example, unequivocably
promised a 40-hour week
starting Jan. 1 — but failed to
make clear whether this ap
plied to the whole country
(as Solidarity claims >or just
the miners (as the govern
ment argues).
A more fundamental ex
planation for the impasse is
that, given the scale of last
year's upheavals, it was un
reasonable to expect social
tensions to disappear merely
by signing a piece of paper. It
takes time to replace a sys
tem of government that has
been discredited and there is
bound to be conflict during
the transitional phase.
The real questions that
need to be answered there
fore are how much more
time does Poland have — and
how much conflict is com
patible with continued com
munist rule.
Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the
editor of the influential
weekly Iblytika and a mem
ber of the Communist Par
ty's Central Committee,
agrees that no new stable so
cial contract has yet
emerged to replace the one
that collapsed last August. In
an interview, he admitted
frankly that time was run
ning out and it was difficult
to see a solution to the crisis
"in the visible future." The
party leadership, he said, re
mained committed to tackl
ing disputes through nego
tiation but both sides lacked
a clear vision of the way
ahead.
Rakowski said a basic dif
ficulty was how to fit the en
tirely new concept of inde
pendent trade unions into the
structure of a one-party
state.
He commented: "Theo

retically and practically
speaking, there is no place
for such a force in such a sys
tem and that is why we have
tensions . . . The system
was built under totally dif
ferent historical conditions
and society was educated to
the idea of the leading role of
the Communist Party (in all
fields). It is not possible to
change this philosophy of
power in a short time. "
Turning to Solidarity,
Rakowski said the move
ment was under the in
fluence of different political
forces and thus expressed an
instable variety of view
points. Objectively, it was
being pushed In the direction
of acting in opposition to the
party.
At the other end of the po
litical spectrum, Ludvik
Dorn, a dissident sociologist

who works as an adviser to
Solidarity in Warsaw, also
expressed pessimism over
the possibility of any short
term solution.
"My own opinion is that
the government is not really
willing to treat us as a part
ner in solving conflicts. It is
only when we threaten a gen
eral strike that we can have
proper negotiations with
them. The basic political
problem in Poland today is
that the system of govern
ment has not adjusted itself
to the enormous changes that
have been taking place in so
ciety." he said
He added: "Nothing has
really been solved by the last
round of negotiations. Unless
we change the basic formula
of government, conflicts can
only be disguised or dressed

up At present the authorities
seem to be following the
principle of not bowing to
pressure unless they have to
This itself paves the way for
the next conflict " A theme
that has been stressed by
both Solidarity and govern
ment leaders over the last
few weeks is that Polish soci
ety has yet to master the
skills of negotiation and com
promise. On signing the
Gdansk agreement, the dep
uty prime minister,
Mieczyslaw Jagielski, said
the negotiations had been an
example of how Poles should
talk to one another
So they were. But, sadly,
so far the talking only ap
pears to have produced re
sults when pistols are in
troduced into the conversa
tion as well.
