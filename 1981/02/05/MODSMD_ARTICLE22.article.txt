# Brings hunger, destruction, dislocation
## Uganda's war rages on 
### Washington Post 
Arua,Uganda — Along the
rutted, potholed dirt track that
is the main highway into Ugan
da's northwest are the burned
out remains of trucks, buses and
army vehicles left from the
struggle former Uganda dic
tator Idi Amin waged before
fleeing to exile.
More than a year later, how
ever, a sporadic bush war con
tinues in this remote corner of
Africa which is Amin's home
province of West Nile. Ancient
tribal distrust mixed with more
recent political animosities
have produced a climate of vio
lence in which armed men said
to be still loyal to Amin are
pitted against the Ugandan
Army and its Tanzanian allies.
Whether the fighting involves
retributions for old injuries or
attempts to wage a guerrilla
struggle against the new gov
ernment in Kampala is not
clear. What is clear, however, is
that it has brought hunger, de
struction and dislocations to
about half a million Ugandans
who live on the western bank of
the broad, steamy Nile River
that flows northward to Sudan.
Here in Amin's home prov
ince — near the juncture of the
frontiers of Zaire, Sudan and
Uganda — the former dictator

had his tribal and power base.
Since the fighting errupted last
October, the death toll in West
Nile is estimated at between
1 000 and 2 000. Some official
Ugandan documents talk about
"indiscriminate killings, loot
ings, rapings" of civilians. Ex
act figures were impossible to
obtain.
When full-scale fighting
broke out in October 1978, up
wards of 250,000 people fled
across the neighboring borders,
often leaving their crops, which
had been near harvest, to rot.
More than half the people
have now returned as fighting
has tapered off, but many are
homeless — their huts burned,
their crops gone.
All schools and most hospitals
are closed in this province of
600,000 people. There is neither
transportation nor communica
tions.
Arua, the capital of West Nile
near the Zaire frontier, is the
main casualty of the war. About
half the buildings in the down
town area of the city of about
10,000 have been gutted by fire
and looted. There are similar
scenes of destruction in Moyo,
the province's second largest
city just south of the Sudan
border.
The Ugandan government
claims that Amin loyalists

marched across both borders in
early October, capturing both
cities and burning and looting as
they advanced
However, a five-day tour of
the area late last month — the
first extensive visit by a re
porter since the province was
declared off-limits in October —
revealed that the residents were
mainly the victims of the Ugan
dan Army. Residents say sol
diers often went on rampages
when they pushed out the Amin
supporters, most of whom were
local inhabitants rather than in
vaders.
Officials, often speaking in
the presence of military men,
made it quite clear that the peo
ple feared their own army more
than the Amin forces, despite
repeated threats of a new in
vasion.
Both sides, however, have
been guilty of atrocities, ac
cording to stories filtering out
now that much of the population
has returned.
Given the traditional tribal
animosities, this trouble was ex
pected. A missionary here,
Father Joseph Bragotti, re
called that during Amin's rule
an Ugandan told him, "When
things change, not even a
chicken will be left alive" in
Amin's native province.
