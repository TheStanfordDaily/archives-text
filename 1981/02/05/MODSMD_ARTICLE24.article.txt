## Voodoo puts spell on Waldorf 
### Tony Kelly 
I know what you're thinking.
You've never heard of Wall of
Voodoo. You probably don't
care right now, either. But after
all, you've read this far, and
that must mean you don't have
anything really important to do
right now, right? So here are a
few facts to get you acquainted:
1) Wall of Voodoo is a five
member band from Los Angel
es.
2) They are not on any major
record label, but they do have a
12" EP out on IRS Records.
3) During their set at the Old
Waldorf last Friday night, they
made music that is different
from any kind I have heard in
my life. And it sounded terrific,
too. No one ever said this was
going to be objective.
To be sure, I didn't expect to
make that statement after
seeing the two opening acts that
evening. Los Microwaves and
Human Hands, two more LA
bands up here for a brief stint,
both seem to be devout practi
tioners of what could be called
"horn-rimmed rock": both
groups seemed more concerned
with their intricate circuitry
systems than actually per
forming for an audience. Los
Microwaves, in particular,
were so intent on maintaining
their artistic distance from the
audience that no one really
cared about them. Human
Hands fared much the same

way, only inspiring the crowd to
any significant reaction at the
end of their set by "playing" a
few thrash-thrash punk tunes.
Not a lot of fun. especially con
sidering San Francisco's violent
punk audiences. Overall, both
groups just demanded too much
work on the part of the listener
to get involved in the music.
I wasn't looking forward to a
lot of change in the pattern with
Wall of Voodoo. After all, they
took a terribly long time (45
minutes) just to set up. And one
look at the banks of synthesizers
told me to prepare for some
more pretentious art-rock. Then
Wall of Voodoo started playing,
and once again I was proved
wrong.
Wall of Voodoo's music is
complex, driving, and just plain
irresistible to the listener. That
is, if the listener likes syn
thesizers. There are usually
three of them going full tilt at
any one time, plus a rhythm se
quencer providing a steady
backbeat. That mechanized
beat freed percussionist Joe
Nanini to use one of the most in
ventive arrays of instruments
I've seen in any band anywhere.
His playing ranged from ap
proximating the ticking of a
bomb on a set of pots of pans
(with cooking stains on them, no
less) during "The Passenger,"
to using an unending variety of
African percussion instruments
on "Animal Day". The amazing

thing about it is it all works. At
times the band did seem in
dulgent (the repetitive in
strumental "Struggle", for in
stance) and occasionally the
added effects were a little in
timidating. However, the main
musicians-Nanini, guitarist
Marc Moeland,
bass/keyboardist Bruce
Moreland and keyboardist Chaz
Gray — showed an uncanny abil
ity to combine several distinct
rhythms into a full, coherent
sound.
Friday night, this complex
sound did have one major flaw:
the power of the music tended to
drown out singer/keyboardist
Stan Ridgway, a compelling
performer with a limited range.
Ridgway almost looked as if he
was being forced to sing onstage
— muttering the lyrics out of the
side of his mouth, with a
sarcastic tone much of the time.
Indeed, at times he looked like
he was close to breaking out in
laughter at the lyrics, especial
ly during a version of Johnny
Cash's "Ring of Fire".
There could be another rea
son for Stan's smirks, though
this band is actually funny. The
humor of Wall of Voodoo Friday
night stretched from the dry iro
ny of the lyrics such as "Tomor
row" 's ode to procrastination
(I'll do it tomorrow/ seems like
a pretty good idea to me.") and
"Can't Make Love" 's defini
tion of modern romance ("I'm a

nice guy/but I don't love you/I
just want to sleep with you") to
the self-deprecating humor of
the group onstage (Stan: "Buy
the record — I need a new
shirt," and Joe Nanini to Stan:
"Hey! You spilled my beer. I
quit the band"). Their sponta
neity got the audience involved,
and what was going to be a de
pressing evening turned out en
joyable. With a better sound mix
(perhaps closer to the prod
uction of the EF) and a trim
ming of the extra effects. Wall
of Voodoo could easily receive
the recognition they deserve.
