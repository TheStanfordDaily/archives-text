Most people know her by her "A rose is a rose is
a rose.'' yet she produced some five hundred and
thirty four titles, including plays, poetry, and
magazine articles. Her name is Gertrude Stein,
and she was the subject of a one-woman show per
formed at Memorial Auditorium last Friday by
the comedienne Pat Carroll.
"Genius is the art of becoming legendary,"
Gertrude Stein wrote, and she succeeded in be
coming a legend not through her work, which is
largely unread and unreadable, but through her
lifestyle as a patron of the arts.
Along with her brother Leo, Stein helped to
launch Picasso's career The Steins filled their
Paris apartment at 27 rue du Fleurus with works
by Cezanne and Matisse long before those pain
ters became famous Their evening soirees were
attended by the who's who of the artistic and liter
ary world, including Henri Rousseau. Guillaume
Appolinaire. Isadora Duncan and Ernest Heming
way.
I.a ric bnhemirnne came easily to the Steins.
Money was no problem — brother and sister spent
their time in art galleries and museums when they
weren't writing or discussing art— and Stein had
time to search for the identity that she had been
unable to find as a medical student at Johns
Hopkins.
Gertrude Stein spent long days scribbling away
in her illegible handwriting, believing herself to
be a great artist and innovator, the Picasso of the
English language, greater even than James
Joyce, who "smelled of museums."
Gertrude Stein's ego knew no bounds as she
struggled to further the revolution of the written
word as the Cubists had revolutionized painting.
One project of hers was to write without mak
ing sense. She concluded that it is impossible to
put words "... together without sense. I made in
numerable efforts to make words write without

sense and found it impossible. Any human being
putting down words had to make sense out of
them, she wrote. And yet we get the feeling that
she succeeded
Pat Carroll's portrait of Gertrude Stein is, for
tunately ,ot a cubist one. It has a beginning, a
middle, and an end: Gertrude Stein reminiscing,
Gertrude Stein still reminiscing and Gertrude
Stein finished reminiscing. Carroll plays the part
with a minimum of movement from an armchair.
The backdrop is the apartment where it all hap
pened. Gertrude Stein is being evicted. With the
rain falling outside and Alice B. Tolkas, Stein's
faithful companion, asleep, we hear the gossip
and the stories.
The problem is that the evening was amusing
but not funny, fit only for a smile and perhaps an
occasional chuckle and a yawn. Perhaps because
everyone expected the show to be hilarious, the
audience tended to laugh at regular intervals— no
matter how inappropriate — almost as if their
laughter had been prerecorded.
Pat Carroll's acting is not the problem; the
name dropping personality of Stein is. The in
evitable result was an evening of strung-together
anecdotes which flattered the listener with the il
lusion of being part of Stein's inner circle of liter
ati. but which were not remarkable in them
selves.
Perhaps Carroll could have saved her show if
she had concentrated more on the rift that came
between Gertrude Stein and her brother Leo, the
"Quattrocento art expert"*a phrase that Carroll
pronounces with special aplomb). They had been*
living together for many years. Stein's intimate
love relationship with Alice B Tolkas was also un
explored.
She should not have been so afraid of offending
the middle-American sensibility. Gertrude Stein
wouldn't have been.
