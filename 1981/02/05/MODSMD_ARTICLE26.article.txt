# Lily Tomlin's stature shrinks incredibly in new film
## 
### Jim Mattson 
The Incrediblc Shrinking
Woman goes wrong in more
ways than most movies have
ways: it is a small miracle of in
eptitude.
At first, it must have seemed
like a terrific idea — "you have
this woman, see, and she's
shrinking and can't do anything
about it, and this means she can
see things in different, funny
ways."
The cast seemed perfect Lily
Tomlin plays the shrinking
woman, and Charles Grodin
plays the shrinking woman's
husband. Tomlin is great at
seeing things in a new light, and
Grodin is great at not seeing
things at all.
The writer and co-producer of
The Incredible Shrinking
Woman is a woman, Jane
Wagner, and one might have ex
pected the movie to reflect
some insight into the problems
faced by a woman living in a
bloated society. Barring that,
one might have hoped for some
level — any level — of com
petence. As it turns out. these
expectations are unrealistic.
Judging by the evidence pres
ented by this film. Wagner has
entered another traditionally
male domain. That is, she's a
hack.
Like half a dozen other mov
ies now in release, The In
credible Shrinking Woman's
main problem is its script. It is a
satire with no clear picture of
what is being satirized. The re
sult is a lumpy, messy film
which substitutes noise for wit.
The Incredible Shrinking
Woman sounds better in synop
sis than it plays on the screen.
It's probably one of those mov
ies that get made because, a
year and a half from now,
they'll be easy to write a blurb
on in TV Guide: "Amusing tale
of woman who shrinks." Usual
ly. when a movie is easy to sy
nopsize it means that there's not
much there to begin with, and
here, Tomlin's not the only thing
that gets smaller as the movie
goes along.
Tomlin shrinks because of all
the chemicals she's ingested in
a lifetime of eating junk food
and using hairspray. The vil
lains of the piece, one assumes
at the beginning, are the manu
facturers who put the chemicals
there in the first place.

But. as the movie progresses,
we lose sight of whether it's
worse to sell chemicals or to
consume them Sometimes it
seems Wagner believes that
only stupid, tasteless people
succumb to stupid, tasteless ad
vertising campaigns, and that
the people who live in the mov
ie's ticky-tacky houses have re
ceived exactly what they de
serve.
Incredibly, the film's overt
message confirms this Tomlin,
at the beginning, plans to go on
television and tell the world not
to eat junk food; and she treats
it as a sacred mission Her hus
band. under the influence of the
chemical producers, talks her
out of it.and she allows herself
to be made into a decidedly mi
nor celebrity instead.
Near the end. just before
Tomlin shrinks away to nothing
(the original Incredible Shrink
ing Man, more poetic, called it
"going beyond the infinite"),
she finds herself in front of a mi
crophone with a gaggle of super
market shoppers as an au
dience. She doesn't convey any
message at all: her last few mo
ments are used to convey good
wishes and other chit-chat An
other movie might have found
some point in this point
lessness; this one simply at
tempts to slip it by unnoticed.
Matters are confused even
more by the attempt that has
been made to set up a color svm
bology within the film. (Most
movies fail in ordinary ways;
this one tries to do it with style.)
The consumers wear bright col
ors: hot pinks, lime greens,
fluorescent yellows. They live in
pastel houses, and drive pastel
cars (the movie's parking lots
have been seeded with pink Pin
tos and coral Mustangs). When
Tomlin gets down to six inches
high, she goes to live in her
daughter's doll house, and it
looks just like the place she's
been living in all along.
Bright colors mean com
mercialism, then, and we're
meant to laugh at the people
who wear/drive/live in them.
But then, midway through the
film, the archvillains (the neo
fascist managers of what seems
to be the world's largest
chemical corporation) appear,
and they're dressed tastefully in
gray suits. The movie, as
always, attempts to have things

both ways: we're to react to one
group because they like bright
colors and to the other because
they dress conservatively. We
end up reacting to neither.
Part of the attraction in good
satire lies in its ability to show
us the familiar in a new, reveal
ing light. It requires main
taining some consistency of vi
sion. which is why a comedy
centered around a shrinking
woman seemed like such a good
idea — her point-of-view would
remain the same even as her
world became drastically al
tered.
I'he Incredible Shrinking
Woman puts in everything it
can think of that might be wor
thy of satire: television com
mercials. small pets, big corpo
rations, and middle-class
dreams One senses that they
are linked, somehow, but nev
er why anyone should care that
they're linked
Our apathy, sadly enough,
centers around the Lily Tomlin
character. Tomlin is "prettier"
in this movie than she's ever
been: when she smiles, she con
ceals those trademark gums,
and the whine that sometimes
invades her voice — the force
ful. strident, unselfconscious
wail of righteousness — is no
where to be heard. Now, when
we look at her face, we're
stopped at its surface (and we
see the features of an actress
who's trying too hard) instead of
going deeper and seeing a wom
an who. at her smart-ass best, is
much more than pretty.
This feeling of great things
being missed pervades the mov
ie — even the special effects
seem tired. The effects aren't
terrible (they have a bargain
basement quality about them
that's rather appealing), but
there's not a single shot where it
seems as if the filmmakers
were having a good time with
what they were doing; the busi
ness of shrinking is treated
more like a chore to be com
pleted than a possibility for ex
ercising the imagination. The
Incredible Shrinking Woman
ends up being a little depress
ing: it laughs so loudly at its
own, tiny punchline that it's
hard not to feel that someone
along the line forgot to tell the
joke.
