# Drey fuss as sensitive male (yawn)
## 
### Geoffrey Mandel 
It is a truth universally acknowledged
that the most interesting thing about Rich
ard Dreyfuss is his hair. His career in fea
ture films has neatly spanned the decade of
the 70s, beginning with a brief walk-on in
The (Graduate, and during these 10 year his
hair has undergone a remarkable number of
changes in color and texture. Remember
the straight black crewcut of The Appren
ticeship of Duddy Kravitz and American
Graffitti, the grizzled "natural" and full
beard of Jaws and The Goodbye Girl, and
the conservative blow-dry cut of Close En
counters of the Third Kind? In the for
gettable The Bif> Fix, Dreyfuss appeared in
what one imagines to be his natural brown
locks, but also sported a trim little
moustache. Only in his most recent vehicle,
The Competition, does he appear for the
first time without any period haircut or
facial hair whatsoever. Here, at last, is
Richard Dreyfuss au naturel.
However, if you expected Dreyfuss's act
ing style to undergo a similar return to
basics, you will be disappointed with his
performance in The Competition. If any
thing, his quirky smiles and slightly neu
rotic cockiness have just about taken over,
leaving him even less of a real person and
even more of a colorful eccentric than ever.
In The Competition (which opened last
Friday at the Palo Alto Square), Dreyfuss
plays Paul, a pianist who is good but not
good enough to make it as a professional. He
takes third or fourth place in international
piano competitions, and his obsession with
becoming a concert pianist is driving his pa
rents into financial ruin and his father
toward a heart attack. The competition — a
fictional one set in San Francisco's old sym
phony hall — is Paul's last chance to make
it, and if he fails, he will dutifully become
a grade school music teacher somewhere in
the industrial Midwest.
Paul is essentially the same character
that Dreyfuss has played in many other
movies, if a slightly more subdued version.
Once again he is bouncy, arrogant, selfish,
witty, and ultimately lovable; in short, the
archetypal sensitive male. Is Dreyfuss now
considered only for this type of role, or was
it written with him in mind? Either way, it
fits him like a well-worn glove. When Paul
mutters to himself in one scene that he will
not be distracted from his practicing bv the
appearance of an old flame. Heidi (Amy Irv
ing), we know that it's all over as far as his
character is concerned. As in just about all

of his previous movies, he will struggle in
vain against this external force (e.g. the al
iens in Close Encounters, the shark in Jaws,
Marsha Mason in The Goodbye Girl),
which, of course, is really an internal force;
and he will be all the stronger at the end of
the movie for coming to terms with it.
This is probably a clause in Dreyfuss's
standard contract, along with a guaranteed
stormy love interest, at least one childish
temper tantrum, a declaration of love in an
unconventional place (in this case, a Ren
aissance fair in Candlestick Park), several
moments of inexpressible but wonderfully
sensitive awkwardness, and last but not
least, the heart-wringing sheepish reconcil
iation scene, where Dreyfuss lets us see
what a sensitive, caring individual is lurk
ing beneath his blustery, hard-ass exterior.
Nonetheless, The Competition is not a
bad movie. In fact, it's quite a lot of fun, and
Dreyfuss is very easy to accept in his role
precisely because it does fit him so well.
Amy Irving, as a wealthy WASPish com
petitor. does not — alas! — fare so well. Irv
ing, who was very convincing in The Fury,
has become a self-indulgent actress, mak
ing ample use of her own quirky smile, her
piercing pale blue eyes, and the horrible af
fectation of a quasi-Southern drawl (left
over, no doubt, from Honeysuckle Rose).
Unfortunately, Irving's bag of tricks are
gaudier and less convincing than
Dreyfuss's, and she makes Paul's rather un
believable character shine with conviciton
when contrasted with her own completely
unfathomable Heidi. Admittedly it was an
interesting casting idea to pair the two in
this movie, but ultimately the film suffers
because they are too much alike in their
self-centered quirkiness. Their incessant,
defensive, bantering has none of the charm
of, say, Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason in The
Goodbye Girl.
The film's plot, centering around the six
finalists in the competition, is pretty flimsy
stuff, but for someone who knows nothing
about the machinations of professional mu
sicians, it's fascinating. Most likely much of
the competition is romanticized and glossed
over, but a real competition would probably
mean a very boring two hours for anyone un
able to distinguish among the finer points of
piano music. On the whole, director Joel
Oliansky did a remarkable job of making a
musical film seem appalling to non-musical
audiences — much as The Turning Point
was able to give ballet wide appeal.
The other four finalists are enmeshed in a

subplot that's really a rehashing of Fame:
there's a refugee from Welcome Back Kot
ter, who wants to use his piano playing and
his chest hair as a springboard to John Trav
olta-like stardom; there's a mousy Russian
girl who is traumatized by the defection of
her music mother? teacher; there's a hip,
black expatriate who hovers between being
gay and just being obnoxious; and, to round
things out, there's a nerdish fellow in
glasses and a dark suit who shows to visible
signs of life until the movie's end credits.
The scenes of Dreyfuss, Irving, and oth
ers playing in rehearsal and in the competi
tion are technically quite effective; the ac
tors were rehearsed in the right finger
movements, and are able to sustain them
convincingly for scenes that are often five
or six minutes long. The actual piano music
was performed by music students, and to
any unschooled ear, the synchronization
seemed perfect. Possibly the best scene in
the entire movie is during the opening titles,
when Dreyfuss earnestly practices his fin
gering on his briefcase while waiting to
compete. The movie's piano score is per
fectly synchronized with Dreyfuss's fin
gers, note for note.
It is difficult to say if the musical se
quences are so powerful because the music
itself is powerful, or because of Oliansky's
capable direction. At one point, Paul re
marks to Heidi that she looks good even in
strong sunlight, and the same might be said
for The Competition. No matter how
bogged down the plot may get in the prob
lems of the supporting characters, or in
Paul and Heidi's bewildering relationship,
there is always something pretty to watch.
Lee Remich, as Heidi's famous piano
teacher, seems vaguely out of place in the
film, probably because she doesn't have
much to do except stand in as Heidi's cons
cience. and periodically fire off four-letter
expletives. Much more fun is Sam
Wanamaker as a lustful, prideful, Leonard
Bernstein-like conductor, whose lifestyle
makes a mockery of the ethic of "work
comes first!" that Remich keeps hammer
ing into Irving.
Although watching Dreyfuss's arteries
harden on the big screen can be a gruesome
ordeal. The Competition is an entertaining
film. It's well-written, well-directed, and
well-orchestrated, and all the more in
teresting because it deals with such a nar
row and esoteric topic.

it, and if he fails, he will dutifully become
a grade school music teacher somewhere in
the industrial Midwest.
Paul is essentially the same character
that Dreyfuss has played in many other
movies, if a slightly more subdued version.
Once again he is bouncy, arrogant, selfish,
witty, and ultimately lovable; in short, the
archetypal sensitive male. Is Dreyfuss now
considered only for this type of role, or was
it written with him in mind? Either way, it
fits him like a well-worn glove. When Paul
mutters to himself in one scene that he will
not be distracted from his practicing bv the
appearance of an old flame. Heidi (Amy Irv
ing), we know that it's all over as far as his
character is concerned. As in just about all

of his previous movies, he will struggle in
vain against this external force (e.g. the al
iens in Close Encounters, the shark in Jaws,
Marsha Mason in The Goodbye Girl),
which, of course, is really an internal force;
and he will be all the stronger at the end of
the movie for coming to terms with it.
This is probably a clause in Dreyfuss's
standard contract, along with a guaranteed
stormy love interest, at least one childish
temper tantrum, a declaration of love in an
unconventional place (in this case, a Ren
aissance fair in Candlestick Park), several
moments of inexpressible but wonderfully
sensitive awkwardness, and last but not
least, the heart-wringing sheepish reconcil
iation scene, where Dreyfuss lets us see
what a sensitive, caring individual is lurk
ing beneath his blustery, hard-ass exterior.
Nonetheless, The Competition is not a
bad movie. In fact, it's quite a lot of fun, and
Dreyfuss is very easy to accept in his role
precisely because it does fit him so well.
Amy Irving, as a wealthy WASPish com
petitor. does not — alas! — fare so well. Irv
ing, who was very convincing in The Fury,
has become a self-indulgent actress, mak
ing ample use of her own quirky smile, her
piercing pale blue eyes, and the horrible af
fectation of a quasi-Southern drawl (left
over, no doubt, from Honeysuckle Rose).
Unfortunately, Irving's bag of tricks are
gaudier and less convincing than
Dreyfuss's, and she makes Paul's rather un
believable character shine with conviciton
when contrasted with her own completely
unfathomable Heidi. Admittedly it was an
interesting casting idea to pair the two in
this movie, but ultimately the film suffers
because they are too much alike in their
self-centered quirkiness. Their incessant,
defensive, bantering has none of the charm
of, say, Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason in The
Goodbye Girl.
The film's plot, centering around the six
finalists in the competition, is pretty flimsy
stuff, but for someone who knows nothing
about the machinations of professional mu
sicians, it's fascinating. Most likely much of
the competition is romanticized and glossed
over, but a real competition would probably
mean a very boring two hours for anyone un
able to distinguish among the finer points of
piano music. On the whole, director Joel
Oliansky did a remarkable job of making a
musical film seem appalling to non-musical
audiences — much as The Turning Point
was able to give ballet wide appeal.
The other four finalists are enmeshed in a

subplot that's really a rehashing of Fame:
there's a refugee from Welcome Back Kot
ter, who wants to use his piano playing and
his chest hair as a springboard to John Trav
olta-like stardom; there's a mousy Russian
girl who is traumatized by the defection of
her music mother? teacher; there's a hip,
black expatriate who hovers between being
gay and just being obnoxious; and, to round
things out, there's a nerdish fellow in
glasses and a dark suit who shows to visible
signs of life until the movie's end credits.
The scenes of Dreyfuss, Irving, and oth
ers playing in rehearsal and in the competi
tion are technically quite effective; the ac
tors were rehearsed in the right finger
movements, and are able to sustain them
convincingly for scenes that are often five
or six minutes long. The actual piano music
was performed by music students, and to
any unschooled ear, the synchronization
seemed perfect. Possibly the best scene in
the entire movie is during the opening titles,
when Dreyfuss earnestly practices his fin
gering on his briefcase while waiting to
compete. The movie's piano score is per
fectly synchronized with Dreyfuss's fin
gers, note for note.
It is difficult to say if the musical se
quences are so powerful because the music
itself is powerful, or because of Oliansky's
capable direction. At one point, Paul re
marks to Heidi that she looks good even in
strong sunlight, and the same might be said
for The Competition. No matter how
bogged down the plot may get in the prob
lems of the supporting characters, or in
Paul and Heidi's bewildering relationship,
there is always something pretty to watch.
Lee Remich, as Heidi's famous piano
teacher, seems vaguely out of place in the
film, probably because she doesn't have
much to do except stand in as Heidi's cons
cience. and periodically fire off four-letter
expletives. Much more fun is Sam
Wanamaker as a lustful, prideful, Leonard
Bernstein-like conductor, whose lifestyle
makes a mockery of the ethic of "work
comes first!" that Remich keeps hammer
ing into Irving.
Although watching Dreyfuss's arteries
harden on the big screen can be a gruesome
ordeal. The Competition is an entertaining
film. It's well-written, well-directed, and
well-orchestrated, and all the more in
teresting because it deals with such a nar
row and esoteric topic.
It is a truth universally acknowledged
that the most interesting thing about Rich
ard Dreyfuss is his hair. His career in fea
ture films has neatly spanned the decade of
the 70s, beginning with a brief walk-on in
The (Graduate, and during these 10 year his
hair has undergone a remarkable number of
changes in color and texture. Remember
the straight black crewcut of The Appren
ticeship of Duddy Kravitz and American
Graffitti, the grizzled "natural" and full
beard of Jaws and The Goodbye Girl, and
the conservative blow-dry cut of Close En
counters of the Third Kind? In the for
gettable The Bif> Fix, Dreyfuss appeared in
what one imagines to be his natural brown
locks, but also sported a trim little
moustache. Only in his most recent vehicle,
The Competition, does he appear for the
first time without any period haircut or
facial hair whatsoever. Here, at last, is
Richard Dreyfuss au naturel.
However, if you expected Dreyfuss's act
ing style to undergo a similar return to
basics, you will be disappointed with his
performance in The Competition. If any
thing, his quirky smiles and slightly neu
rotic cockiness have just about taken over,
leaving him even less of a real person and
even more of a colorful eccentric than ever.
In The Competition (which opened last
Friday at the Palo Alto Square), Dreyfuss
plays Paul, a pianist who is good but not
good enough to make it as a professional. He
takes third or fourth place in international
piano competitions, and his obsession with
becoming a concert pianist is driving his pa
rents into financial ruin and his father
toward a heart attack. The competition — a
fictional one set in San Francisco's old sym
phony hall — is Paul's last chance to make
it, and if he fails, he will dutifully become
a grade school music teacher somewhere in
the industrial Midwest.

precisely because it does fit him so well.
Amy Irving, as a wealthy WASPish com
petitor. does not — alas! — fare so well. Irv
ing, who was very convincing in The Fury,
has become a self-indulgent actress, mak
ing ample use of her own quirky smile, her
piercing pale blue eyes, and the horrible af
fectation of a quasi-Southern drawl (left
over, no doubt, from Honeysuckle Rose).
Unfortunately, Irving's bag of tricks are
gaudier and less convincing than
Dreyfuss's, and she makes Paul's rather un
believable character shine with conviciton
when contrasted with her own completely
unfathomable Heidi. Admittedly it was an
interesting casting idea to pair the two in
this movie, but ultimately the film suffers
because they are too much alike in their
self-centered quirkiness. Their incessant,
defensive, bantering has none of the charm
of, say, Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason in The
Goodbye Girl.
The film's plot, centering around the six
finalists in the competition, is pretty flimsy
stuff, but for someone who knows nothing
about the machinations of professional mu
sicians, it's fascinating. Most likely much of
the competition is romanticized and glossed
over, but a real competition would probably
mean a very boring two hours for anyone un
able to distinguish among the finer points of
piano music. On the whole, director Joel
Oliansky did a remarkable job of making a
musical film seem appalling to non-musical
audiences — much as The Turning Point
was able to give ballet wide appeal.
The other four finalists are enmeshed in a

subplot that's really a rehashing of Fame:
there's a refugee from Welcome Back Kot
ter, who wants to use his piano playing and
his chest hair as a springboard to John Trav
olta-like stardom; there's a mousy Russian
girl who is traumatized by the defection of
her music mother? teacher; there's a hip,
black expatriate who hovers between being
gay and just being obnoxious; and, to round
things out, there's a nerdish fellow in
glasses and a dark suit who shows to visible
signs of life until the movie's end credits.
The scenes of Dreyfuss, Irving, and oth
ers playing in rehearsal and in the competi
tion are technically quite effective; the ac
tors were rehearsed in the right finger
movements, and are able to sustain them
convincingly for scenes that are often five
or six minutes long. The actual piano music
was performed by music students, and to
any unschooled ear, the synchronization
seemed perfect. Possibly the best scene in
the entire movie is during the opening titles,
when Dreyfuss earnestly practices his fin
gering on his briefcase while waiting to
compete. The movie's piano score is per
fectly synchronized with Dreyfuss's fin
gers, note for note.
It is difficult to say if the musical se
quences are so powerful because the music
itself is powerful, or because of Oliansky's
capable direction. At one point, Paul re
marks to Heidi that she looks good even in
strong sunlight, and the same might be said
for The Competition. No matter how
bogged down the plot may get in the prob
lems of the supporting characters, or in
Paul and Heidi's bewildering relationship,
there is always something pretty to watch.
Lee Remich, as Heidi's famous piano
teacher, seems vaguely out of place in the
film, probably because she doesn't have
much to do except stand in as Heidi's cons
cience. and periodically fire off four-letter
expletives. Much more fun is Sam
Wanamaker as a lustful, prideful, Leonard
Bernstein-like conductor, whose lifestyle
makes a mockery of the ethic of "work
comes first!" that Remich keeps hammer
ing into Irving.
Although watching Dreyfuss's arteries
harden on the big screen can be a gruesome
ordeal. The Competition is an entertaining
film. It's well-written, well-directed, and
well-orchestrated, and all the more in
teresting because it deals with such a nar
row and esoteric topic.
