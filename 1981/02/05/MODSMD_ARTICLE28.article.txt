# Black Stallion director shows excellent early work

In one of the lectures Pauline
Kael gave on her promotional
tour last year, she recalled that
back in the mid-sixties she lec
tured for a time at UCLA. When
she inquired of the film students
what new work they found excit
ing, all they could talk about
was a ten-minute short made by
one of their number, a young
man from Lake Tahoe named
Carroll Ballard. Though Ballard
shared top honors at UCLA with
his talented classmate Francis
Ford Coppola, it was Coppola
who landed a Hollywood con
tract, while Ballard found work
outside the,commercial film in
dustry — in educational and ex
perimental motion pictures. It
wasn't until Coppola had
founded his own company,
Zoetrope, and invited Ballard to
make the movie of his choice
that Ballard ventured into fic
tion film making. The project,
of course, was The Black
Stallion.

The Black Stallion is surely
one of the most extraordinary
feature film debuts in the his
tory of movies. It is a master
piece; possibly no other picture
has ever penetrated the world of
childhood, in which sensation is
heightened to the edge of the
realm of fantasy, with such sen
sitivity and assurance. One
longs to know where and how
Ballard developed his technique
and his motifs — and last week
the Pacific Film Archive at
Berkeley provided an unusual
opportunity for film buffs to find
out: an evening of shorts that
predate The Black Stallion, in
troduced by Ballard himself.
Ballard is an undistinguished
looking man with a moustache,
a tentative Vandyke and (on this
occasion at least) a black
tnuque. He looks more like a
lumberjack than a director, and
his manner is shy and self-effac
ing. He speaks in a small voice
and with the kind of offhand ir
reverence about his own work

that used to characterize Buster
Keaton But when he warms up
to his subject he can be a funny
raconteur, and many of his
stories reveal his pleasure in ex
perimenting with film; he
sounds like an inventor or a re
search scientist sharing — in a
half-embarrassed way, as if he
were not entirely sure why any
one else might be interested —
one or two of the neat results he
obtained by fiddling around in
his lab. He's Martin Ar
rowsmith with a movie camera.
Young as he was when he
made his first student film,
Waiting for May (1964), he was
already showing remarkable
self-confidence and a feeling for
the capacity of film to juxtapose
contrasting rhythms and points
of view. One can see why his col
leagues applauded. There is
nothing original in the film's
statement (that youth passes
rapidly into old age and sees
itself procreated in new youth)
but his presentation of the con

temporary world as overpower
ingly fast and vertiginous
through montages of towering
Orson Welles-like skyscrapers
and topsy-turvy freeways — as
an old person might perceive a
world that has sped past him —
is certainly not conventional.
Still, the jump from Waiting
for May to the next year's Pigs'.
— also a ten-minute piece — is
astonishing Ballard claims that
he shot and edited Pigs] in three
weeks for the USIA because he
was in the midst of settling a
divorce and desperately needed
five hundred dollars to prevent
the dispossession of his camera
equipment. The movie conveys
no sense of urgency, however, it
is rhapsodic. It begins with
glimpses of sleeping pigs, cud
dled by gentle shafts of light; it
is likely that no one before
Ballard ever thought of catch
ing pigs on camera in such an
uncharacteristic pose. Here we
can see the beginnings of what
Ballard and his cameraman,
Caleb Deschanel (who worked
on most of these pictures,
though Ron Dexter is listed as
photographer on Pigs!), would
bring to The Black Stallion: a
gift for capturing the com
monplace in such surprising
new ways that we feel we've
never really looked at it before.
The porcine protagonists of
are filmed with great wit.
Real personalities emerge, but
Ballard is not in the Disney trad

ition; he has too much respect
for his animal subjects (as we
see later in his portrayal of the
stallion) to anthropomorphize
them. Though there is an in
evitable analogy to children in
the shots of pigs playing in the
mud, it is reverse Disney; mud
loving children behave like
these joyful, filth-encrusted
pigs.
In 1969, a destitute Ballard
made The Perils of l*riscilla for
the Humane Society, in order to
save his car from being im
pounded. The heroine is a cat,
and her point of view controls
the picture. For a lot of it,
Ballard employs subjective
camera, with amusing results;
the camera swings like a crazed
pendulum when a careless child
sweeps Priscilla up. for exam
ple. Mechanical toys take on the
image of potential predators
(like the pet dog does in The In
credible Shrinking Man: and
our vision of the world is turned
upside down. This film which re
calls Jack London's Call of the
Wild, James Agee's.4 Mother's
Tale and The Incredible ■Jour-
ney by Sheila Burnford, is a
small marvel.
Rodeo was made the same
year. It was not surprising to
learn after watching the picture
that Ballard had based it on his
childhood reminiscences of
rodeos. Of all the shorts on the
PFA program. Rodeo most
clearly prefigures the kind of

imagery he focuses on in The
Htnch Stallion, a film so elo
quent in its depiction of a
child's view of the world. The
champion rider stays on the bull
for so long — we see it in slow
motion — that the two achieve a
strange, beautiful union, like
the boy and the horse in Stallion.
And when the harmony is inter
rupted by the disengagement of
animal and rider, we are truly
shocked This sequence, in
which the line between pain and
ecstasy becomes blurred, is sen
suous and choreographic.
Ballard surpasses Agnes de
Mille.
Seems Like Only Yesterday,
a documentary about Los Angel
es centenarians that was com
missioned by PBS and the
American Film Institute in 1971,
exists only in an unfinished
black and white print with a
slightly garbled soundtrack. Ap
parently PBS was displeased
with the footage Ballard showed
them and cut off funds; mean
while. the lab lost the only color
print. In its present form (run
ning about three-quarters of an
hour) it is somewhat shapeless
and contains some extraneous
material that Ballard would
likely have excised — but the old
people interviewed are so won
derful. and their stories are so
charming and (many of them)
so poignant, that one wonders
why PBS disliked it so much.
Perhaps they failed to under

stand the inventive use of mon
tage and variety of rhythm to
show — as in the much less so
phisticated Waiting for May —
the new world that must be in
comprehensible to anyone who
can remember a time when
there were no automobiles.
Ballard here makes contem
porary life look like science fic
tion.
Ballard shot Crystallization
(1974) in his bedroom. It is the
most magical of his movies
before The Black Stallion: a
wild series of metamorphoses
of forms, textures and colors, a
kaleidoscope that alternately
suggests fusion of the paintings
of Jackson Pollack and Mark
Rothko, the experimental films
of Ed Emshwiller, and a sky full
of rainbows vanishing each into
the next.
Although the PFA auditorium
was not crowded, the audience's
response to these films was en
thusiastic, and perhaps they
will appear again. Unfortunate
ly, there are few places even in
San Francisco and Berkeley
that will show programs of
educational and experimental
shorts. Ballard is currently
filming Never Cry Wolf, an
adaptation of a novel by the Ca
nadian writer Farley Mowat, in
the Yukon. He hopes for a 1982
summer release. But for now,
unfortunately Carroll Ballard is
represented to most viewers
only by The Black Stallion.
