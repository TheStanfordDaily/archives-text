# Panel says revolution will be needed to fight future racism
## 
### Carol Rose 
The division of black society along
class lines and the need for revolu
tionary change to end racism were the
central themes of a symposium en
titled "Racism in America: An
Analysis for the '80s," held last night
at Kresge Auditorium.
"The ruling class is also the ruling
race. This interlocking of class and
race cannot be ignored,"said keynote
speaker Maulana Karenga, associate
professor of black studies at Cal State
Long Beach
And according to Clay Carson, pro
fessor of history here, one of the para
doxes of racism in the '80s is the in
creasing black middle class concur
rent with greater unemployment
"The '60s witnessed the emergence
of a new generation of spokesmen
whose power did not depend on patron
age of the white in power." Clay said
"In the '70s we saw the growth of a
black bourgeoise which achieved its
livelihood from a white society, he
said.

The importance of retaining cul
tural identity and avoiding criteria for
success based upon white people's val
ues was an issue stressed by Carlos
Munoz. professor of Chicano studies at
UC-Berkeley.
Racism defined
"Racism is a system of denial and
defamation of a people's history and
humanity based primarily upon a
specious concept of race," Karenga
said
The more history you have, the
more humanity you have, according to
Karenga. Therefore, when a people's
history is denied they appear less hu
man.
All three speakers were pessimistic
in discussing the future of racism in
the '80s. They pointed to the election of
Ronald Reagan and the reemergence
of the Ku Klux Klan as examples of a
resurging racism
"The future of Afro-American soci
ety will move from the periphery of
the United States' society to the cen
ter." Clav said

This is both a positive and a
negative trend; positive because it
gives blacks (in the center) more
power because they are now essential
to the economy; negative because it
makes blacks dependent on the U.S.
economy and white society."he con
tinued
Karenga defined the three ways so
ciety limits minorities as racism, sex
ism and capitalism.
"Ninety percent of black people are
workers, without control over the
means of production. Therefore they
have no control over their lives," he
said.
Radical change needed
Each speaker said that revolu
tionary change in the economic and
political systems in the United States
is necessary to combat racism.
"Black power analysis of the 60s
was an important step forward, but
alone it was an insufficient step," Clay
said.
He stressed the need to synthesize
Marxist and nationalist movements.
Munoz said that "though we ought
to look at history, we must not be im
prisoned by it. We must learn from the
past, not duplicate it."
He emphasized the need to retain in
tegrity as minority scholars without
sacrificing the cause of revolution.
"The rulers of the United States
rule by cultural hegemony, thought
control of what is beautiful," accord
ing to Karenga.
This makes revolution more dif
ficult because people are co-«?pted and
revolution becomes faddish," he
added
"Many revolutions have come from
the ranks of the petty bourgeoise" he
said.
Karenga outlined five ways that
blacks can work to overcome racism
in the 1980s. These included main
tenance of a cultural revolution, build
ing more black institutions, opposi
tional practice, appropriate coali
tions. and collective mass movement
for radical social change.
The symposium was sponsored by
the Stanford Progressive Alliance and
Stanford Committee on Political
Education.
