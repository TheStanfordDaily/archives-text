# Cooder resurrects R & B
## 
### Pat O'Bannon 
If Ry Cooder ever decides to quit making music
he'll have no problems landing a job as a musi
cologist at the Smithsonian. Since his solo debut in
1970, Cooder has led a one man crusade to save
various forms of native American music from ob
scurity. He has breathed new life into such tradi
tional styles as Depression-era blues, gospel, Tex-
Mex, Hawaiian folk guitar, and early jazz. On his
latest lp, Borderline, Cooder continues the resto
ration work he began on '50s and '60s R&B in last
year's excellent "Bop Till You Drop."
This is not to say that Cooder and his music
belong in a glass case hidden away at the end of a
dusty museum corridor, or behind a classroom
lectern. On the contrary he instills traditional mu
sic with a freshness and enthusiasm which allows
it to stand proudly alongside more contemporary
works. He's also technologically innovative; he's
been pioneering the use of digital recording tech
niques in rock music for the last two years.
Cooder got his start in Watts, singing gospel
music in churches, and in West L. A., playing blues
guitar in clubs. In the mid-'6os, Cooder and Taj
Mahal formed Rising Sons, a blues band which
existed before Paul Butterfield earned respect for
resurrecting the blues. From the short-lived
Rising Sons Cooder joined the ranks of L.A.'s
corps of session musicians, working with such di
verse characters as Captain Beefheart and the
Rolling Stones.
Cooder's first three solo albums Ry Cooder,
Into the Purple Valley, and Boomer's Story
focused on Depression-era blues, the Dust Bowl
rising out of the grooves of each record. All spot
lighted Cooder's trademark slide guitar, which
had made him so popular as a session player. In
1974, on Paradise and Lunch, Cooder began delv
ing into new styles. He added gospel background
vocals, featuring Bobby King, now a regular on
Cooder albums, and experimented with new musi
cal combinations. "Jesus on the Mainline" blends
a Salvation Army-style brass band with the gospel
vocals to wonderful effect. Paradise and Lunch
even hinted at future excursions into the Tex-Mex
music of the American Southwest by prominently
featuring the words "Vaya con Dios" on the
album cover.
His next lp, Chicken Shin Music found Cooder

flirting with Tex-Mex by fronting Flaco Jimenez'
outstanding San Antonio-based groujs on several
tracks. The marriage seemed complete on the
live album Show Time, which combined Tex-Mex
instrumentation with gospel harmonies and
Cooder's slide work. Cooder spent the months
prior to his 1976 concert tour flying between San
Antonio, to rehearse with the band, and L.A., to
work with the singers. Band and singers met for
the first time just prior to opening night, where,
miraculously, everything fell into the loose funky
style one hears on the record.
Last year's Bop Till You Drop, rock's first
digital recording, and currently available in a
bargain bin near you, found Cooder wandering
around old R&B, accompanied by Bobby King's
silky vocals and Jackson Browne sideman David
Lindley's guitar work. Cooder and Lindley are a
delightful team throughout the album, weaving
several beautiful duets, particularly on the in
strumental "I Think it's Going to Work Out Find."
Cooder continues to educate listeners to the de
lights of R&B on Borderline. He has resurrected
classics like Wilson Pickett's "634-5789," Sam the
Sham and the Pharoah's, "Crazy 'Bout an Auto
mobile," and Joe South's "Down in the Boon
docks," giving them treatments so vital and joy
ful that they stand the test of comparison
alongside the originals.
In addition to such classics, Cooder's also un
earthed gems like "The Girls From Texas." Any
song with lyrics like: "Baby I'll give you the
clothes off my back/You can have everything I've
got in my shack/But if you ever try to leave they'll
take you out in a sack/ Cause me and my razor'll
see to that" deserves to be saved and placed in a
position of honor.
"Borderline" is shot through with the sinuous,
sexy slide guitar lines which earned Cooder his
reputation. With the death of Lowell George it
seems safe to say that Cooder and Bonnie Raitt
are the surviving experts of this genre. With
Cooder's guitar, Bobby King's gospel vocals, and
the general funky goodtime feel it has Borderline
promises a great deal more enjoyment than many
album offers these days.
Cooder will be appearing at the Old Waldorf in
San Francisco February 26 and 27.

Cooder continues to educate listeners to the de
lights of R&B on Borderline. He has resurrected
classics like Wilson Pickett's "634-5789," Sam the
Sham and the Pharoah's, "Crazy 'Bout an Auto
mobile," and Joe South's "Down in the Boon
docks," giving them treatments so vital and joy
ful that they stand the test of comparison
alongside the originals.
In addition to such classics, Cooder's also un
earthed gems like "The Girls From Texas." Any
song with lyrics like: "Baby I'll give you the
clothes off my back/You can have everything I've
got in my shack/But if you ever try to leave they'll
take you out in a sack/ Cause me and my razor'll
see to that" deserves to be saved and placed in a
position of honor.
"Borderline" is shot through with the sinuous,
sexy slide guitar lines which earned Cooder his
reputation. With the death of Lowell George it
seems safe to say that Cooder and Bonnie Raitt
are the surviving experts of this genre. With
Cooder's guitar, Bobby King's gospel vocals, and
the general funky goodtime feel it has Borderline
promises a great deal more enjoyment than many
album offers these days.
Cooder will be appearing at the Old Waldorf in
San Francisco February 26 and 27.
If Ry Cooder ever decides to quit making music
he'll have no problems landing a job as a musi
cologist at the Smithsonian. Since his solo debut in
1970, Cooder has led a one man crusade to save
various forms of native American music from ob
scurity. He has breathed new life into such tradi
tional styles as Depression-era blues, gospel, Tex-
Mex, Hawaiian folk guitar, and early jazz. On his
latest lp, Borderline, Cooder continues the resto
ration work he began on '50s and '60s R&B in last
year's excellent "Bop Till You Drop."
This is not to say that Cooder and his music
belong in a glass case hidden away at the end of a
dusty museum corridor, or behind a classroom
lectern. On the contrary he instills traditional mu
sic with a freshness and enthusiasm which allows
it to stand proudly alongside more contemporary
works. He's also technologically innovative; he's
been pioneering the use of digital recording tech
niques in rock music for the last two years.
Cooder got his start in Watts, singing gospel
music in churches, and in West L. A., playing blues
guitar in clubs. In the mid-'6os, Cooder and Taj
Mahal formed Rising Sons, a blues band which
existed before Paul Butterfield earned respect for
resurrecting the blues. From the short-lived
Rising Sons Cooder joined the ranks of L.A.'s
corps of session musicians, working with such di
verse characters as Captain Beefheart and the
Rolling Stones.
Cooder's first three solo albums Ry Cooder,
Into the Purple Valley, and Boomer's Story
focused on Depression-era blues, the Dust Bowl
rising out of the grooves of each record. All spot
lighted Cooder's trademark slide guitar, which
had made him so popular as a session player. In
1974, on Paradise and Lunch, Cooder began delv
ing into new styles. He added gospel background
vocals, featuring Bobby King, now a regular on
Cooder albums, and experimented with new musi
cal combinations. "Jesus on the Mainline" blends
a Salvation Army-style brass band with the gospel
vocals to wonderful effect. Paradise and Lunch
even hinted at future excursions into the Tex-Mex
music of the American Southwest by prominently
featuring the words "Vaya con Dios" on the
album cover.
His next lp, Chicken Shin Music found Cooder

flirting with Tex-Mex by fronting Flaco Jimenez'
outstanding San Antonio-based groujs on several
tracks. The marriage seemed complete on the
live album Show Time, which combined Tex-Mex
instrumentation with gospel harmonies and
Cooder's slide work. Cooder spent the months
prior to his 1976 concert tour flying between San
Antonio, to rehearse with the band, and L.A., to
work with the singers. Band and singers met for
the first time just prior to opening night, where,
miraculously, everything fell into the loose funky
style one hears on the record.
Last year's Bop Till You Drop, rock's first
digital recording, and currently available in a
bargain bin near you, found Cooder wandering
around old R&B, accompanied by Bobby King's
silky vocals and Jackson Browne sideman David
Lindley's guitar work. Cooder and Lindley are a
delightful team throughout the album, weaving
several beautiful duets, particularly on the in
strumental "I Think it's Going to Work Out Find."
