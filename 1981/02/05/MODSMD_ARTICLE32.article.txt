# Gaucho: slow funk in L.A.
## 
### 
By Don Willenburg
It is seldom purely coinciden
tal that a recording act waits as
long as three years to release a
new album after scoring a
critical and commercial suc
cess of major dimensions. Con
tract disputes or the ambition to
create some masterwork of
creative contemporary enter
tainment often delay new re
leases past a "normal" waiting
period; seldom does the fact
that the act now has enough
money that it doesn't need to re
lease a new album figure promi
nently in extending the hiatus.
Sometimes the delay is inten
tional. to minimize the com
parison with the earlier record
that is as inevitable as it is
seldom generous.
Still, Steely Dan's newest LP
(iauchn, invites a certain
degree of comparison with the
band's tremendously successful
Aja, released in 1977. Both
albums highlight the significant
songwriting and arranging tal
ents of Steely Dan members
Walter Becker and Donald
Fagen, augmented by an array
of top-notch sidemen and pro
duced with careful sophisti
cation by long-time Dan as
sociate Gary Katz Aja both le
gitimized the concept of a two
member band relying on a dif
ferent assortment of musicians
on each song and demonstrated
that a pop group could achieve
great popularity without the ap
peal that only live concerts can
bring.
The new release is not likely
to put much of a dent in this well
earned reputation, (iaucho is a
well-produced, finely tuned
album. But at the same time,
one is left with the feeling that
something is missing. Like Aja,
it is definitely a Los Angeles
album in spirit, mood, ex
pression and focus. Even the
lyrics reflect this immersion in
the culture and lifestyles of the
wealthy and would-be wealthy
of Southern California. The
songs are littered with refer
ences to Santa Ana, trips to San
Francisco, Hollywood
Boulevard, and accouterments
of life as essential to the West
wood sophisticate as they are
chimerical to the provincials of
Des Moines, Cleveland or
Pomona.
(iaucho's lyrics are, how
ever, sometimes disappointing.
Becker and Fagen's peculiar
gift has always been for writing
lyrics that, while distant and ob
scure on paper, seem to per
fectly define a moment, a feel
ing, or a situation when sung. It

is hard to believe that in the
most specifically L.A. song on
the album, "Glamour Pro
fession," alternately about a
Magic Johnson - style basket
ball player, a movie extra, and a
cocaine dealer, that the most
Becker and Fagen are able to
muster is "living hard will take
its toll."
There are other songs where
the lyrical brilliance that has
characterized most of the Dan's
albums shines as brightly as

ever. The title cut sings of "one
more expensive kiss-off" in a
way that sounds at once humor
ously and uncomfortably famil
iar. In what is probably that best
cut on the album, "Time Out of
Mind," the chorus - "Tonight
when I chase the dragon the wa
ter will change to cherry wine
and the silver will turn to gold
time out of mind" is sung with
the upbeat feeling of driving in
along Laurel Canyon for what
you just know will be a suc
cessful night at the studio or on
the town.
Musically, there is less
bounce to many of these songs
than those on Aja. The band
seems comfortable in a slow
funk style of play, and several of
the cuts are more infectious
than most artists on the pop
scene today can ever hope to
create. The thorough pro
fessionalism evident in each
song admits little of the rough
edges that seep into less careful
ly produced music, or form the
basis of styles as diverse as
punk and country western, both
of which have grown in popu
larity since Steely Dan's last re
lease. The lack of major
rhythmic changes or contrasts

within and between songs can
give the album more of a back
ground music effect that one
would expect from a group of
such high-powered musicians.
At times, the sound is almost too
professional; one wishes for
more spirit. The album sounds
like a soundtrack to a slickly
produced but almost mystically
insubstantial film, the kind only
critics with pretensions of sub
lime profundity ever claim to
appreciate or understand.

Perhaps one of the reasons
that (iauchn is neither as
coherent or dynamic an ex
pression. celebration, and pan
egyric of Los Angeles is that it
was largely recorded and mixed
in New York, with a larger cont
ingent of New York musicians
than usual. There seems a cer
tain nervousness and hesitation
on songs that attempt to depict
the West Coast with East Coast
personnel. Gary Katz has man
aged to retain many of the finest
musicians who have played with
Steely Dan in the past, and such
regulars as drummers Steve
Gadd, Rick Marotta and Jeff
Porcaro, percussionist Ralph
Mac Donald, and the inimitable
Tom Scott keep the sound from
straying too far east of the Hol
lywood studios.
As a whole, the album is a sol
id effort and a breath of fresh air
on the rather dismal polished
pop scene. Perhaps its faults lie
less in what's on the vinyl that in
false and overzealous expecta
tions engineered by the quality
of their last effort and the in
ordinate amount of time since
its release. Listen with a fresh
ear and enjoy.

Steely Dan in the past, and such

It is seldom purely coinciden
tal that a recording act waits as
long as three years to release a
new album after scoring a
critical and commercial suc
cess of major dimensions. Con
tract disputes or the ambition to
create some masterwork of
creative contemporary enter
tainment often delay new re
leases past a "normal" waiting
period; seldom does the fact
that the act now has enough
money that it doesn't need to re
lease a new album figure promi
nently in extending the hiatus.
Sometimes the delay is inten
tional. to minimize the com
parison with the earlier record
that is as inevitable as it is
seldom generous.
Still, Steely Dan's newest LP
(iauchn, invites a certain
degree of comparison with the
band's tremendously successful
Aja, released in 1977. Both
albums highlight the significant
songwriting and arranging tal
ents of Steely Dan members
Walter Becker and Donald
Fagen, augmented by an array
of top-notch sidemen and pro
duced with careful sophisti
cation by long-time Dan as
sociate Gary Katz Aja both le
gitimized the concept of a two
member band relying on a dif
ferent assortment of musicians
on each song and demonstrated
that a pop group could achieve
great popularity without the ap
peal that only live concerts can
bring.
The new release is not likely
to put much of a dent in this well
earned reputation, (iaucho is a
well-produced, finely tuned
album. But at the same time,
one is left with the feeling that
something is missing. Like Aja,
it is definitely a Los Angeles
album in spirit, mood, ex
pression and focus. Even the
lyrics reflect this immersion in
the culture and lifestyles of the
wealthy and would-be wealthy
of Southern California. The
songs are littered with refer
ences to Santa Ana, trips to San
Francisco, Hollywood
Boulevard, and accouterments
of life as essential to the West
wood sophisticate as they are
chimerical to the provincials of
Des Moines, Cleveland or
Pomona.
(iaucho's lyrics are, how
ever, sometimes disappointing.
Becker and Fagen's peculiar
gift has always been for writing
lyrics that, while distant and ob
scure on paper, seem to per
fectly define a moment, a feel
ing, or a situation when sung. It

is hard to believe that in the
most specifically L.A. song on
the album, "Glamour Pro
fession," alternately about a
Magic Johnson - style basket
ball player, a movie extra, and a
cocaine dealer, that the most
Becker and Fagen are able to
muster is "living hard will take
its toll."
There are other songs where
the lyrical brilliance that has
characterized most of the Dan's
albums shines as brightly as

ever. The title cut sings of "one
more expensive kiss-off" in a
way that sounds at once humor
ously and uncomfortably famil
iar. In what is probably that best
cut on the album, "Time Out of
Mind," the chorus - "Tonight
when I chase the dragon the wa
ter will change to cherry wine
and the silver will turn to gold
time out of mind" is sung with
the upbeat feeling of driving in
along Laurel Canyon for what
you just know will be a suc
cessful night at the studio or on
the town.
Musically, there is less
bounce to many of these songs
than those on Aja. The band
seems comfortable in a slow
funk style of play, and several of
the cuts are more infectious
than most artists on the pop
scene today can ever hope to
create. The thorough pro
fessionalism evident in each
song admits little of the rough
edges that seep into less careful
ly produced music, or form the
basis of styles as diverse as
punk and country western, both
of which have grown in popu
larity since Steely Dan's last re
lease. The lack of major
rhythmic changes or contrasts

within and between songs can
give the album more of a back
ground music effect that one
would expect from a group of
such high-powered musicians.
At times, the sound is almost too
professional; one wishes for
