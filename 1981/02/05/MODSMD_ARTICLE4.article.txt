## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — The State Depart
ment said yesterday it has been told
that Cynthia Dwyer, an American
free-lance journalist who has been un
der arrest in Iran since May, was giv
en a hearing in Iran, but not a trial.
William Dyess, the State Depart
ment spokesman, said information re
ceived here didn't confirm reports
from Swiss officials in Switzerland
that Dwyer was tried on espionage
charges and would be sentenced on
Monday.
Dyess also announced that a second

American citizen, Mohi Sobhani. who
had been in Iranian custody, apparent
ly was released yesterday. He said the
information came from Sobhanis
brother in Los Angeles.
"We are just very happy and very
thankful," Morris Sobhani said of the
release of his younger brother, Mohi,
who was born in Iran
The older Sobhani said he learned of
the release when he made an early
morning call to a relative in Tehran
about 2:30 a.m.
"We call about twice a week to see if
they have heard anything, but this

time Mohi answered the phone. He
said he had been freed about two hours
earlier,' the older brother said.
Mohi Sobhani had not been heard
from since last Sept. 6, when he was
arrested on unspecified charges.
Morris Sobhani has said his brother
was arrested because he is a member
of the Baha'i faith.
Dyess said he didn't know whether
Sobhani, an Iranian-born naturalized
U.S. citizen, had been charged with
any crime. Sobhani, 44, worked in Iran
as a computer technician for Rockwell
International. He was said to have

been arrested on Sept. 6 at Tehran air
port when he was about to leave the
country with his family.
Dyess said he had no new informa
tion on a third U.S. citizen in Iranian
custody, Zia Nassri, an Afghan-born
naturalized citizen. Little information
is available about Nassri.
"We are not aware of any specific
charges against Mrs. Dwyer," said
Dyess. He said the Swiss informed the
United States that there may be "a
disposition" of the case next week.
Dwyer, 49, of Amherst. N.Y.. near
Buffalo, had gone to Iran last April as

a free-lance journalist She was ar
rested on May 5 by revolutionary
guards and later accused of spying for
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency,
although she was apparently not for
mally charged.
In Berne. Switzerland, officials re
ported that Dwyer was tried yester
day by an Iranian Revolutionary Court
on espionage charges.
But Dyess said of that report, "Our
information is different." He added.
"We understand from the Swiss there
was a hearing earlier yesterday."
Referring to the case, he said the
United States "will be very pleased if
it can be disposed of in a satisfactory
manner."
A Swiss diplomat reported that a
verdict was expected Monday. The
diplomat did not provide details of the
one-day trial in Tehran but said Dwyer
appeared "nervous but in good condi
tion."
Dyess confirmed that a Swiss repre
sentative had been at the hearing
Dwyer. 49. of Amherst, a suburb of
Buffalo, NY, went to Iran to write
about the Iranian revolution and was
arrested on May 5 on suspicion of es
pionage for the CIA. Swiss officials,
looking after American interests in
Iran, have been attempting to nego
tiate her release
John Dwyer. her husband, said in
Buffalo yesterday that he had heard

news reports about the trial but had no
comment until he had talked to the
U.S. State Department. The State De
partment in Washington. D C., said it
had no comment.
Mr. Dwyer said Tuesday that he
was hopeful yesterday would bring
word on whether his wife would soon
be released
Mrs. Dwyer was not included in ne
gotiations between the United States
and Iran on release of 52 American
hostages freed from 444 days of cap
tivity on Jan. 20.
Dwyer said Tuesday that he had
been in contact with the U.S. State De
partment and that "apparently her
health continues to be good."
Mrs Dwyer, the mother of three,
has been held in Evin Prison in Iran
The Swiss Foreign Office spokes
man did not disclose details of the trial
proceedings.
He said he understood that the pub
lic was not admitted to the trial. He
said the Iranian authorities sent an in
vitation Tuesday to the Swiss Em
bassy in Tehran to send an observer to
the trial.
He was WilhelmSchmid.headof the
embassy's foreign interests section,
who was accompanied by an in
terpreter and a local Iranian employ
ee of the embassy, the spokesman
said.
In other pending cases in Iran, the
head of the Iranian Supreme Court
said yesterday that the fate of four
Britons held captive for several
months will be decided "in a few
days."
Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti
told a news conference in Iran that an
investigation had been completed in
the cases of the Britons, three
Anglican missionaries and a busi
nessman.
They are John Cleman and his wife
Audrey, who ran a medical clinic in

From the Daily wire services
Washington — The State Depart
ment said yesterday it has been told
that Cynthia Dwyer, an American
free-lance journalist who has been un
der arrest in Iran since May, was giv
en a hearing in Iran, but not a trial.
William Dyess, the State Depart
ment spokesman, said information re
ceived here didn't confirm reports
from Swiss officials in Switzerland
that Dwyer was tried on espionage
charges and would be sentenced on
Monday.
Dyess also announced that a second

American citizen, Mohi Sobhani. who
had been in Iranian custody, apparent
ly was released yesterday. He said the
information came from Sobhanis
brother in Los Angeles.
"We are just very happy and very
thankful," Morris Sobhani said of the
release of his younger brother, Mohi,
who was born in Iran
The older Sobhani said he learned of
the release when he made an early
morning call to a relative in Tehran
about 2:30 a.m.
"We call about twice a week to see if
they have heard anything, but this

time Mohi answered the phone. He
said he had been freed about two hours
earlier,' the older brother said.
Mohi Sobhani had not been heard
from since last Sept. 6, when he was
arrested on unspecified charges.
Morris Sobhani has said his brother
was arrested because he is a member
of the Baha'i faith.
Dyess said he didn't know whether
Sobhani, an Iranian-born naturalized
U.S. citizen, had been charged with
any crime. Sobhani, 44, worked in Iran
as a computer technician for Rockwell
International. He was said to have

been arrested on Sept. 6 at Tehran air
port when he was about to leave the
country with his family.
Dyess said he had no new informa
tion on a third U.S. citizen in Iranian
custody, Zia Nassri, an Afghan-born
naturalized citizen. Little information
is available about Nassri.
"We are not aware of any specific
charges against Mrs. Dwyer," said
Dyess. He said the Swiss informed the
United States that there may be "a
disposition" of the case next week.
Dwyer, 49, of Amherst. N.Y.. near
Buffalo, had gone to Iran last April as

a free-lance journalist She was ar
rested on May 5 by revolutionary
guards and later accused of spying for
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency,
although she was apparently not for
mally charged.
In Berne. Switzerland, officials re
ported that Dwyer was tried yester
day by an Iranian Revolutionary Court
on espionage charges.
But Dyess said of that report, "Our
information is different." He added.
"We understand from the Swiss there
was a hearing earlier yesterday."
Referring to the case, he said the
United States "will be very pleased if
it can be disposed of in a satisfactory
manner."
A Swiss diplomat reported that a
verdict was expected Monday. The
diplomat did not provide details of the
one-day trial in Tehran but said Dwyer
appeared "nervous but in good condi
tion."
Dyess confirmed that a Swiss repre
sentative had been at the hearing
Dwyer. 49. of Amherst, a suburb of
Buffalo, NY, went to Iran to write
about the Iranian revolution and was
arrested on May 5 on suspicion of es
pionage for the CIA. Swiss officials,
looking after American interests in
Iran, have been attempting to nego
tiate her release

Buffalo yesterday that he had heard

news reports about the trial but had no
comment until he had talked to the
U.S. State Department. The State De
partment in Washington. D C., said it
had no comment.

was hopeful yesterday would bring

health continues to be good."
