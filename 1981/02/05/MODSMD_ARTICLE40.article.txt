Reagan to keep grain embargo
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, im
pressed by the argument of Secretary of State
Alexander Haig that now is not the time to make
concessions to the Soviet Union, will keep the
Russian grain embargo in place for the fore
seeable future, according to White House
sources.
The grain embargo was a significant issue in
the 1980 presidential campaign. Reagan assailed
President Jimmy Carter for imposing it in re
taliation for the Russian invasion of Afghanistan
and said it was hurting American farmers far
more than it was the Russians.
But this is not now the case, Reagan was told
yesterday in a full-scale discussion of the issue
during a Cabinet meeting
The Russians face severe grain shortages, he
was told, and are using their hard currency to
buy grain from Argentina and other countries.
This was also one of the central arguments made
in a recent report by the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative, Washington-based research or
ganization that recommended extending the em
bargo.
The issue is highly sensitive for Reagan be
cause of his repeated promises to lift the em
bargo if he were elected. But some of his aides
argue privately that the situation has changed
since he made the pledge, both because of the So
viet threats to Poland and because there has
been some accumulation of evidence that the
embargo has made the Soviets pay out more of
their limited hard currency, perhaps as much as
$1 billion more, than they would have without
the embargo.
Carter imposed the embargo on Jan. 4, 1980.
with the support of most national farm organiza
tions. His order blocked delivery of 17 million
metric tons of wheat, corn and other products,
most of it destined for livestock feed.
Hua exits communist post
Beijing — Hua Guofeng reappeared here yes
terday after an absence of more than 10 weeks
from public affairs and extensive speculation
that he had been ousted as Communist Party
chairman.
The way in which Hua returned — dinner with
an exiled Vietnamese leader amid Chinese New
Year celebrations — indicated, however, that he
had not regained power, but rather is being al
lowed a graceful exit as part of a compromise
easing a lengthy political crisis here.
Such a compromise would return the tense po
litical situation here to that of late October when
Hua had agreed to step aside at the next party
congress, accepting a lesser post.
In return, the harsh denunciation of the late
Chairman Mao Zedong in a critical assessment
of the party's policies over the last 30 years ap
pears to be under revision. Hua had strongly ob
jected to the total abandonment of Maoist poli
cies as well as to the severity of the attacks on
Mao's leadership, informed Chinese sources
have said.
In reporting Hua's reappearance, neither the
official New China News Agency nor Beijing Ra
dio gave any indication of where the party chair

man had been nor any hint at the apparent com
promise that brought him back. They simply
said that he had given a dinner for Hoang Van
Hoan. a vice chairman of the Vietnamese Na
tional Assembly who defected to China and has
been living here for more than a year.
Hua had not appeared here since he met Nov
27 with the visiting prime minister of Romania
A scheduled meeting with a Greek Communist
delegation a few days later was canceled
without explanation.
Since becoming party chairman after Mao's
death, Hua had carefully built his support within
the military, which reportedly objected to his
ouster as a threat to the country's political unity
and stability Hua spent much of January solic
iting the backing of regional commanders out
side Beijing, according to Chinese sources, and
this further escalated the crisis.
Europe protests neutron bomb
London — Western European leaders reacted
with cautious opposition yesterday to fresh pros
pects of U.S. deployment of neutron weapons in
Europe.
In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass ac
cused President Ronald Reagan's adminis
tration of trying to "blackmail" Western Eu
ropean nations into deploying the weapons
against the Soviet Union. It said U.S. Defense
Secretary Casper Weinberger's statements fa
voring the weapons "evoked indignation and
fear around the world."
In Washington, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Gen. David Jones, said he also
favored use of enhanced radiation weapons in
Western Europe, "but I caution it's important
how we do it."
Weinberger said Tuesday he was leaning
toward deployment of the controversial neutron
weapon, which had been first promoted and then
shelved by the Carter administration in 1978.
Some members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization criticized Carter at the time for in
consistency, but most seemed relieved that the
issue had been dropped.
West German government spokesman Klaus
Becker called Weinberger's statements a
"vague formulation" that should be examined
with "supreme patience" by NATO as a whole.
Such an opportunity would probably not occur
before the NATO defense ministers' meeting
next May, he said. Neutron weapon deployment
in Western Europe would be a prime topic when
West German Defense Minister Hans Apel goes
to Washington for talks with the Pentagon next
month. Becker said.
Doctors protest teen sex ruling
California doctors raised an angry cry Tues
day over a new state law that requires them to
report to police every unmarried female patient
under 18 whom they suspect has engaged in sex
ual activity.
"I will go to jail before I will obey that law and
thereby violate the trust and confidence of my
patients." declared Dr. Edward Zalta, presi
dent of the Los Angeles County Medical Associa
tion. "It is unconstitutional. It abridges pa-

tients' rights."
Medical associations are interpreting the law,
which went into effect Jan 1. as meaning that
doctors must report all women under 18 who
come to them for birth-control pills or for treat
ment of venereal disease or for any other reason
that implies that they have been sexually active.
In San Francisco, Dr. Brad Cohn, president
elect of the California Medical Association,
called the legislation a "fink law." He said it re
quires doctors to report patients even if VD is
only suspected — not actual — because of the im
plication of sexual activity.
He said reporting a young girl to authorities
could have the effect of destroying for life her
trust in the medical profession and could result
in serious health problems if her mistrust of doc
tors caused her to avoid needed help. The law
makes doctors who don't conform liable to pros
ecution and possible jail sentences.
The law, sponsored by Democratic State Sen.
Omer Rains, was intended to improve existing
laws requiring doctors and certain other pro
fessionals to report suspected incidents of child
abuse to local agencies, according to Bob Moore,
an administrative aid to Rains.
The old law was drafted with a provision that
left it up to doctors to decide whether a particu
lar case should be reported to authorities. But,
Moore said that provision was removed from the
Rains bill at the last minute, largely at the wish
of Senate conservatives.
Murder suspect found sane
Oakland — Darlin June Cromer was sane
when she strangled a 5-year-old black boy, an
Alameda County jury decided today in its sixth
day of deliberation.
The ruling means the 34-year-old Pinole wom
an could be sentenced to die for the murder last
Feb. 5 of Reginald Williams of nearby Alameda.
Cromer was convicted by the same jury on
Jan. 16 of first-degree murder. The jury also
ruled that the killing was motivated by racial ha
tred, a special circumstance which makes
Cromer liable to a death sentence or life im
prisonment.
Cromer is white; Williams was black. Prose
cutors contended she knew what she was doing
when she strangled him in a fit of racist frenzy,
but her attorneys contended she was insane and
didn't understand the consequences of her ac
tion.
The penalty phase of the trial is scheduled to
begin tomorrow. The same jury will decide
whether Cromer will face the death sentence.
Indian nuclear threat rebuffed
Washington — A State Department official
yesterday rejected the contention that India
may reprocess U.S.-supplied nuclear fuel
without Washington's permission and obtain
plutonium that could be used for weapons.
Vinay Meckoni, an official at India's Bhabha
Atomic Research Center near Bombay, had told
U.S. reporters at the facility Tuesday that the
fuel "belongs to us" and may be reprocessed
freely.

"The 1963 U.S.-Indian agreement states that
no U.S. fuel may be reprocessed without con
sultation with the United States," said the State
Department official, who asked not to be identi
fied. •'We regard that agreement as still valid."
The fuel is supplied by the United States under
a 1963 contract The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission halted shipments last May because
India had refused to agree to international in
spection of its nuclear operations
Former President Jimmy Carter overruled
the commission's ban on shipments to India a
month later. He wanted to strengthen ties with
India, a country he said was influential in block
ing Soviet expansion in Southwest Asia.
A congressional bid to block more fuel
shipments won House approval and failed by
only two votes in the Senate last September after
opponents warned that India might turn to the
Soviet Union for nuclear fuel if refused U.S aid.
P.O.W. to face charges
Camp Lejeune, N.C. — A jury of five Marine
officers, all veterans of Vietnam, yesterday
began deliberating charges that Private Robert
Garwood collaborated with his captors during
almost 14 years in Vietnam and assaulted a fel
low prisoner of war.
The jury began considering the charges at
9:30 a.m. after hearing 17 pages of instructions
by military judge Col. R E. Switzer.
Switzer said the jury may find Garwood inno
cent of the charges if it believes defense claims
that the 34-year-old Indiana native was mentally
ill during the period of his captivity and could not
distinguish between right and wrong.
Garwood could face life imprisonment if he is
convicted.
Switzer detailed the charges in his instruc
tions to the jury, saying Garwood is accused of
"holding intercourse" with the Vietnamese by
wearing their uniform, carryng arms and accep
ting a position in their army, acting as an in
terpreter during political indoctrination classes
in POW camps, acting as an informer concern
ing prisoners' complaints, questioning POWs
about military units and attitudes, teaching
them Vietnamese, suggested they "cross over"
to the other side, and acting as an armed guard.
The other charge accuses Garwood of
maltreating Army Private David Harker by
striking him in the ribs with his hands without
justifiable cause.
