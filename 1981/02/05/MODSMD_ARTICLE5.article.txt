# Strike in southern Poland to continue
## 
### 
Warsaw, Poland (AP) — Nego
tiations aimed at ending a crippling lo
cal strike in southern Poland broke
down yesterday and independent un
ionists called for reinforcements
while the government warned of "con
sequences."
Independent labor leader Lech
Walesa, on hand in Bielsko-Biala for
the talks, told The Associated Press:
"It is better to fall while carrying
one's head high than to retreat ig
nominously.
"We are not afraid." said the leader
of the 10-million member independent
labor federation Solidarity.

Warsaw Radio said government ne
gotiators headed by Czeslaw Kotela,
deputy minister of administration, lo
cal economy and environment, re
turned to Warsaw after the talks
failed. It said no date was set for a pos
sible resumption.
The broadcast said the government
representatives told the strikers there
was "no basis" for their nine-day-old
job action, which has affected trans
portation and some 120 enterprises in
the city in the southern province of
Katowice.
Kotela relayed to the strikers the
government view that their action was

"against the spirit" of labor-govern
ment agreements reached last year in
settling nationwide strikes, the radio
said He said the strike committee
would be "responsible for the conse
quences."
There was no indication of what the
consequences might be, but a recent
government communique said author
ities would take "all necessary"
measures if strikes did not end.
Continuing labor unrest in this Sovi
et-bloc nation has raised fears of a
possible Soviet-led military interven
tion like that in Czechoslovakia in
1968

The unionists stopped work to press
demands for the resignation of local
officials they alleged were corrupt.
The provincial governor and his dep
tuy resigned Tuesday under pressure
from the strikers, and Premier Jozef
Pinkowski said he would "consider"
the resignations.
But Warsaw Radio reported, and
sources in Bielsko-Biala confirmed,
that the strikers also want the resigna
tions of Mayor Marian Kalon and two
of his deputies.
Walesa, contacted by telephone,
said "What we are doing here is forced
upon us by life. We do not want to go on
striking anywhere, but we are com
pelled to do so "
A Western visitor who arrived in
Warsaw from the southern city de
scribed the atmosphere there as "very
tense,"
Sources said the strike leaders, an
gered by the Warsaw delegation's
abrupt departure, stood and sang the
national anthem
A communique issued by strike
headquarters to all enterprises in
volved said: "The negotiations broke
down. The commission left for War
saw. The strike is being continued.
Strengthen second and third shift. In
crease food supplies and blankets. In
case of a breakdown in communica
tions go ahead with a total sit-in
strike."
The reference to strengthening
shifts appeared to be a call for more
workers to join the action.
