## New year's plan to feed Vietnam 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Hanoi — As the lean and ad
verse "Year of the Monkey"
drew to its close at midnight last
night, Vietnam's leaders hoped
the coming "Year of the
Cockerel" will be one of, if not
abundance and plenty, then at
least of minimal sufficiency

News analysis

The second five-year plan,
which elapsed with the old year
yesterday, has fallen far short
of its production goals. The vital
grain yield, instead of reaching
the target of 21 million tons in
1980, has never risen above a
maximum of 14 million tons in
the best years. It would only
take some natural disaster like
flooding or a hurricane to put
Vietnam instantly at the mercy
of outside sources of supply.
Industry, still in its infancy in
Vietnam, is starved of raw ma
terials and machine parts. And
as the cost of living climbs re
lentlessly, the economy is in
creasingly undermined by what
is officially termed "negative
phenomena," such as corrup
tion, malfeasances of every
kind or illicit trafficking.
Analyzing these setbacks at
the year's end, Hoang Tung, a
member of the Communist Par
ty Central Committee who over
sees the news media, sweeping
ly ascribed it all to "to the wars
we have had to contend with, the
natural cataclysms that period
ically assail us — and. for anoth
er third, our own selves."
Agricultural priority
Certainly 14 million tons of
grain to feed a nation of 53 mil
lion is cutting food supplies
close. This means that the on
ward drive toward in
dustrialization — the Holy Grail
of all developing countries —
has had to take second place to
agriculture and its ancillary
sectors.
Not that it has been an easy
matter even to lift cereal output
to the bare subsistence level of
an annual 14 million tons. In the
collective agricultural sector —
the north has no less than 95
percent of food production col
lectivized — the authorities in
cessantly upbraid producers for
their "lack of zeal."
The reasons for this are man
ifold, and officials seem to have
been at work to diagnose the key
symptoms — as is evident from
veiled references in the press to
the need for eliminating
"egalitarianism" and "way
wardness" from the nation's ec
onomic affairs.
But, as is no doubt privately
admitted, the diagnosis is really
a simple one. If those working
on the land lack zeal it is be
cause they lack the material in
centive to be zealous. Author
ities are therefore faced with a
serious reappraisal in seeking to

get those involved in agriculture
interested in their work by im
proving remuneration, and at
the same time respecting the
threefold obligation of socialist
society toward the state, the
community and the individual.
Realistic remuneration
Since October the press has
noticeably backed a more re
alistic approach, while official
reports noted that under a newly
introduced system of remunera
tion. production in the agricul
tural cooperatives and the fish
ing industry doubled in 1980 over
the previous year
Since last month directives
from the party's central com
mittee and the government have
begun to officialize the revised
plan for remuneration. As the
Communist Party daily \han
l)nn noted, "The new method of
work and remuneration has be
come part of daily life, and a
new vigor has appeared on the
production front."
The coming "Year of the
Cockerel" will be a year of
reckoning for the historic lead
ers of Vietnam's revolution, for
they will be expected to give an
account of their stewardship at
the fifth partv congress next
fall.
