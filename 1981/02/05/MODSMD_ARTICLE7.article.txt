# Nigeria: OAU backbone stiffens on Libya, apartheid
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Lagos, Nigeria — Oil-rich Nigeria, with its 80 million
people and vast economic potential, is rapidly estab
lishing itself as the uncontested leader of the African
continent.
Recent events in Chad, particularly the Chad-Libyan
union announced in Tripoli early last month, have con
firmed this dominant role as "Africa's leading power"
that Lagos aims to hold both politically and
diplomatically.
The civilian government under Shehu Shegari which
came to power 16 months ago has remained faithful to
the foreign policy lines laid down by previous military
leaders, particularly those of Gen. Yakubu Gowon (Ni
gerian head of state from July 1966 to September 1975)
and Gen. Murtalla Muhamed. who overthrew Gen.
Gowon and was assassinated in February 1976 during
an attempted coup
Both heads of state urged a policy of "nonalignment"
and were motivated in their African foreign policy by
the guidelines of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU).
Pro-West
Nigeria became independent in 1960 and as a former
British colony has remained a pro-West, capitalist na
tion. despite repeated official assurances of being non
aligned. The Biafra civil war. which ended in 1970 after
30 months of bloody fighting, never weakened the ideol
ogical. cultural, economic and financial ties with the
West dating from the 19605.
"We were pro-West then and we are pro-West to
day," a senior Foreign Ministry official said in an in
terview. "But after the shock of the civil war — re
member that France and certain African countries sup
ported the rebels — we have learned to be more radical
in our views on world events."
Nigeria now wants Africa to become totally inde

pendent, with African states settling their own dif
ferences without going outside the continent for advice.
But President Shehu Shagari's major aim is the total
elimination of apartheid from the continent.
Supports nationalists
Nigeria's standpoint on southern Africa and Namibia
is clear. Lagos recognizes the South West Africa Peo
ples' Organization (SWAPO) as the sole representative
of the Namibian people.
After the failure of the Geneva conference on
Namibia last month the Lagos government — which is
frequently consulted by the West but rarely heeded — is
prepared to harden its position, according to sources
close to the Foreign Ministry.
"We are ready to use diplomatic pressure with the
aim of speeding up the independence of Namibia and if
necessary we would start again a similar action to the
nationalization of British Petroleum (BP), as in July
1979, to speed up negotiations over Zimbabwe." the
sources added.
OAU guidelines
"We have tried to avoid confrontation, but in the
future we will stick strictly to decisions taken by the
OAU at Freetown in July 1980 where it was agreed that
countries trading with South Africa will be black
listed."
Nigeria played a decisive role in African affairs sev
eral times last year. They included:
— The OAU conference here in August 1980 on the
Somali-Ethiopia conflict when the OAU adopted the
view of President Shagari who wanted a settlement on
the basis of respect for former colonial borders, recog
nizing that the Ogaden Province was an integral part of
Ethiopia.
— President Shagari warned, at the OAU conference in
Freetown during the debate on the Western Sahara that

the OAU would disintegrate if Morocco and Senegal
promised to carry out their threat to quit if the
Polisario movement was accepted as a new member.
— Nigeria's views predominated during the OAU con
ference on Chad here in December. The Lagos govern
ment persuaded Chad President Goukuni Oeuddei to
take part in the conference, although he had initially re
fused to do so. The Lagos government also persuaded
fellow members at the conference not to condemn Lib
ya for its military presence in Chad at a time when
African delegates arrived here intending to vote for the
immediate retreat of Libya from Chad.
Call for withdrawal
But Nigeria has changed its views since the an
nouncement in Tripoli of the union between Libya and
Chad. It called for the withdrawal of Libyan troops
from Chad in Lome Jan. 14 at the conference called by
OAU President Siaka Stevens of Sierra Leone.
"We want Col. Moammar Khadafy of Libya to
withdraw his troops before the OAU summit in Nairobi
next July.'' a senior Nigerian official said.
"We realize that we underestimated Col. Khadafy
and that we had not aided President Goukuni enough in
the past."
Nigeria, at the Lome conference, urged that the Chad
crisis be solved by "Africans only," and Chad's neigh
bors should take steps to "prevent foreign powers out
side Africa or dissident Chadians using their country as
sanctuaries or bases to launch armed attacks against
Chad."
Nigerian Foreign Minister Ishaya Audu, during a re
cent visit to Paris, stated , "Nigeria is ready to aid
Chad to stand up to Libyan pressure but it will not in
tervene unless it is asked to do so, within the
framework of OAU principles." But Nigeria will only
give humanitarian aid to Chad when all Libyan troops
have gone, it was noted here.

terview. "But after the shock of the civil war — re
member that France and certain African countries sup
ported the rebels — we have learned to be more radical
in our views on world events."
Nigeria now wants Africa to become totally inde

pendent, with African states settling their own dif
ferences without going outside the continent for advice.
But President Shehu Shagari's major aim is the total
elimination of apartheid from the continent.
Supports nationalists
Nigeria's standpoint on southern Africa and Namibia
is clear. Lagos recognizes the South West Africa Peo
ples' Organization (SWAPO) as the sole representative
of the Namibian people.
After the failure of the Geneva conference on
Namibia last month the Lagos government — which is
frequently consulted by the West but rarely heeded — is
prepared to harden its position, according to sources
close to the Foreign Ministry.
"We are ready to use diplomatic pressure with the
aim of speeding up the independence of Namibia and if
necessary we would start again a similar action to the
nationalization of British Petroleum (BP), as in July
1979, to speed up negotiations over Zimbabwe." the
sources added.
OAU guidelines
"We have tried to avoid confrontation, but in the
future we will stick strictly to decisions taken by the
OAU at Freetown in July 1980 where it was agreed that
countries trading with South Africa will be black
listed."
Nigeria played a decisive role in African affairs sev
eral times last year. They included:
— The OAU conference here in August 1980 on the
Somali-Ethiopia conflict when the OAU adopted the
view of President Shagari who wanted a settlement on
the basis of respect for former colonial borders, recog
nizing that the Ogaden Province was an integral part of
Ethiopia.
— President Shagari warned, at the OAU conference in
Freetown during the debate on the Western Sahara that

the OAU would disintegrate if Morocco and Senegal
promised to carry out their threat to quit if the
Polisario movement was accepted as a new member.
— Nigeria's views predominated during the OAU con
ference on Chad here in December. The Lagos govern
ment persuaded Chad President Goukuni Oeuddei to
take part in the conference, although he had initially re
fused to do so. The Lagos government also persuaded
fellow members at the conference not to condemn Lib
ya for its military presence in Chad at a time when
African delegates arrived here intending to vote for the
immediate retreat of Libya from Chad.
Call for withdrawal
But Nigeria has changed its views since the an
nouncement in Tripoli of the union between Libya and
Chad. It called for the withdrawal of Libyan troops
from Chad in Lome Jan. 14 at the conference called by
OAU President Siaka Stevens of Sierra Leone.
"We want Col. Moammar Khadafy of Libya to
withdraw his troops before the OAU summit in Nairobi
next July.'' a senior Nigerian official said.
"We realize that we underestimated Col. Khadafy
and that we had not aided President Goukuni enough in
the past."
Nigeria, at the Lome conference, urged that the Chad
crisis be solved by "Africans only," and Chad's neigh
bors should take steps to "prevent foreign powers out
side Africa or dissident Chadians using their country as
sanctuaries or bases to launch armed attacks against
Chad."
Nigerian Foreign Minister Ishaya Audu, during a re
cent visit to Paris, stated , "Nigeria is ready to aid
Chad to stand up to Libyan pressure but it will not in
tervene unless it is asked to do so, within the
framework of OAU principles." But Nigeria will only
give humanitarian aid to Chad when all Libyan troops
have gone, it was noted here.
From the Daily wire services
Lagos, Nigeria — Oil-rich Nigeria, with its 80 million
people and vast economic potential, is rapidly estab
lishing itself as the uncontested leader of the African
continent.
Recent events in Chad, particularly the Chad-Libyan
union announced in Tripoli early last month, have con
firmed this dominant role as "Africa's leading power"
that Lagos aims to hold both politically and
diplomatically.
The civilian government under Shehu Shegari which
came to power 16 months ago has remained faithful to
the foreign policy lines laid down by previous military
leaders, particularly those of Gen. Yakubu Gowon (Ni
gerian head of state from July 1966 to September 1975)
and Gen. Murtalla Muhamed. who overthrew Gen.
Gowon and was assassinated in February 1976 during
an attempted coup
Both heads of state urged a policy of "nonalignment"
and were motivated in their African foreign policy by
the guidelines of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU).
Pro-West
Nigeria became independent in 1960 and as a former
British colony has remained a pro-West, capitalist na
tion. despite repeated official assurances of being non
aligned. The Biafra civil war. which ended in 1970 after
30 months of bloody fighting, never weakened the ideol
ogical. cultural, economic and financial ties with the
West dating from the 19605.
