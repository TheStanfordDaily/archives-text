# Marcos critics: 'Poor got poorer'
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Manila, Philippines — Critics
of President Ferdinand Marcos
of the Philippines say that the
rich are getting richer and the
poor poorer. Marcos replies
that the critics are "either blind
to the facts or are deliberately
distorting reality."
The weight of the evidence
suggests that it is Marcos who is
distorting reality. In listing the
accomplishments of his "New
Society" when he lifted martial
law on Jan. 17, Marcos said that
per capita income has tripled
from $214 in 1972 (when he de
clared martial law) to $755 in
1980.
"What do these figures mean
for the masses of our coun
trymen?" Marcos asked
rhetorically.
The answer, his critics shot
back, is nothing.
Economic imbalance
Per capita income means
nothing in a country where the
bottom 20 percent of the popu
lation receives only 5.5 percent
of the national income while the
top 20 percent gets 53 percent.
It is true, Marcos conceded,
that the rich have grown richer,
but he said they are more heav
ily taxed.

"They also have been dis
couraged from exercising the
way of the old oligarchy," he
said. "I am prepared to think
that they have developed a so
cial conscience that is growing
day by day."
Marcos' opponents say that
the president has merely re
placed one set of oligarchs with
another of his own creation. As
for Marcos' claim that these
people are developing a social
conscience, his critics are un
convinced.
They find it hard to reconcile
Marcos' claim with the osten
tatious lifestyle of Manila's
rich, especially the newly rich,
and their pampered sons and
daughters.
Worst gap
In fact, according to a World
Bank study, the gap between
rich and poor in the Philippines
is the worst in Southeast Asia
and is exceeded only in Latin
America.
A 392-page World Bank report
on poverty in the Philippines,
based on a field study done in
1979, disclosed that real wages
for skilled laborers in Manila
dropped 23.8 percent between
1972 and 1978. Unskilled la
borers were harder hit, with a
31.6 percent drop.
Oil-fueled inflation is the
principal villain and pro-
Marcos forces are quick to point
out that the president can't be
blamed for this.
The World Bank report was
vague on incomes in rural
areas, where the majority of
Filipinos live, but expressed the
view that for at least part of the
1970s absolute poverty in
creased. Some observers who
have traveled extensively in the
Philippines dispute this. They
say that the rural standard of
living has improved under
Marcos.
World Bank officials say they
are not singling out the Philip
pines for criticism and add that
Philippine economic planners
requested the study so they
could know where they stood.
Although international lend
ing agency officials have a good
relationship with the young
technocrats managing the Phil
ippine economy, they have little
enthusiasm for 11 showcase in
dustrial projects that would cost
$6 billion. The bank has en
dorsed only one of them.
Anti-Marcos elements argue
that the present World Bank
strategy of export-led growth
has in fact contributed to the de
cline of Filipino incomes by fail
ing to provide enough jobs.
In any event. World Bank len
ding to the Philippines during
the next five years will be con
centrated in two general areas:
alleviating poverty and chang
ing the industrial structure so as
to save or earn foreign ex
change.

based on a field study done in
1979, disclosed that real wages
for skilled laborers in Manila
dropped 23.8 percent between
1972 and 1978. Unskilled la
borers were harder hit, with a
31.6 percent drop.
Oil-fueled inflation is the
principal villain and pro-
Marcos forces are quick to point
out that the president can't be
blamed for this.
The World Bank report was
vague on incomes in rural
areas, where the majority of
Filipinos live, but expressed the
view that for at least part of the
1970s absolute poverty in
creased. Some observers who
have traveled extensively in the
Philippines dispute this. They
say that the rural standard of
living has improved under
Marcos.
World Bank officials say they
are not singling out the Philip
pines for criticism and add that
Philippine economic planners
requested the study so they
could know where they stood.
Although international lend
ing agency officials have a good
relationship with the young
technocrats managing the Phil
ippine economy, they have little
enthusiasm for 11 showcase in
dustrial projects that would cost
$6 billion. The bank has en
dorsed only one of them.
Anti-Marcos elements argue
that the present World Bank
strategy of export-led growth
has in fact contributed to the de
cline of Filipino incomes by fail
ing to provide enough jobs.
In any event. World Bank len
ding to the Philippines during
the next five years will be con
centrated in two general areas:
alleviating poverty and chang
ing the industrial structure so as
to save or earn foreign ex
change.
