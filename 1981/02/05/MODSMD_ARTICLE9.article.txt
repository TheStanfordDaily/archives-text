# Women's rights at CROW
## 
### Louise Solomon 
In the second lecture in the CROW (Center for
Research on Women) series, "Women and Equal
ity: Law and Justice," Nancy Davis, co-director
of Equal Rights Advocates, focused on the issues
on the "cutting edge" of women's rights. Davis
began by giving her receptive audience in Terman
Auditorium background information on working
women.
The average working woman has the same
education as the average working man, she said,
yet they are earning only three-fifths as much.
Most women work because of economic need, she
added, and two-thirds of them are single and are
the only breadwinners for themselves and their
dependents.
Women with high school diplomas are still
being paid less than men with elementary school
educations, Davis said, and women with college
degrees are still paid less than men with only
eighth-grade educations. Most women are work
ing in "dead-end'' jobs, she continued, noting that
80 percent of all clerical workers are women.
The national unemployment rate is highest for
black, young women and lowest for white, older
men, Davis said. Many of the women who come to
Equal Rights Advocates for help are not able to
afford a lawyer, or cannot find one with the neces
sary expertise in the particular type of sex dis
crimination which they are facing, she added, and
often their problems are not taken seriously.
The key, "vanguard" issues that Davis dis
cussed were pregnancy, occupational safety and
health, sexual harrassment, and the academic
marketplace.
After saying that the "capacity of women to
bear children has had a resounding impact on
women in the working world," Davis gave a brief
history of pregnancy as sex discrimination. In two
different cases the Supreme Court ruled that dis
crimination on the basis of pregnancy was not the
same as sex discrimination; they based their rul
ing on the idea that pregnancy-based discrimina
tion divided the working force into "pregnant
women and non-pregnant persons." she said.
Discouraged with the Court, feminist unions,
lawyers, and activist groups formed a lobbying

coalition which successfully lobbied in Congress
for an amendment to Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act. The amendment included pregnancy
based discrimination under sex-discrimination.
Davis maintained that the controversial ques
tion now is whether or not employers have ade
quate justification to treat pregnant women dif
ferently in any respect. She said typical cases in
volve employers who set specific restrictions on
how long a pregnant women may work.
Calling occupational safety and health a "field
of tremendous importance not just to women, but
to men workers as well,'' Davis said the debate is
focused on employer justification of policies
which require female workers to be sterilized (to
prevent birth defects).
She went on to say that these policies don't take
into account two important concerns: a woman's
desire to work in the field of her choice and the
possible effect on a man's reproductive system.
Davis termed the companies' professed concern
for the possibility of birth defects a "ruse" and
said that she believed they were looking to avoid
future lawsuits.
Davis went on to discuss the issue of sexual har
rassment saying it's "something which happens
all the time." She mentioned that the circuit
courts have ruled sexual harrassment should be
considered along with other types of sexual dis
crimination under Title VII. In one "very favor
able" ruling the court said that even if one isn't
harmed, one should not have to tolerate such
treatment.
Davis expressed concern that this issue is often
"laughed at or not taken seriously enough."
Discussing discrimination in the academic
market, Davis said that much litigation took
place in this area during the 19705. She said that
there was a distinct problem of proving sex dis
crimination in this area because of-"personality
qualifications" and the "different standards of
judgments that the courts have applied to univer
sities.
Davis closed by saying that most of the women
who seek legal help have a "tremendous amount
of guts" and are dedicated to "fair play and equal
rights."


"You gotta have heart" is one of the numbers performed by Billy
"Bad' Kemmeries and David Jaffee in the Zete house's Senior
Class Good Deed at Children's Hospital. Among the other songs per
formed by the Greek do-gooders were "Rhinestone Hasher," and

"We sing and dance the day away in cafeteria land." "Dave and I
work so well together," says Kemuicries. "We're high energy, and
we give a lot of love."

men, Davis said. Many of the women who come to
Equal Rights Advocates for help are not able to
afford a lawyer, or cannot find one with the neces
sary expertise in the particular type of sex dis
crimination which they are facing, she added, and
often their problems are not taken seriously.
The key, "vanguard" issues that Davis dis
cussed were pregnancy, occupational safety and
health, sexual harrassment, and the academic
marketplace.
After saying that the "capacity of women to
bear children has had a resounding impact on
women in the working world," Davis gave a brief
history of pregnancy as sex discrimination. In two
different cases the Supreme Court ruled that dis
crimination on the basis of pregnancy was not the
same as sex discrimination; they based their rul
ing on the idea that pregnancy-based discrimina
tion divided the working force into "pregnant
women and non-pregnant persons." she said.
Discouraged with the Court, feminist unions,
lawyers, and activist groups formed a lobbying

coalition which successfully lobbied in Congress
for an amendment to Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act. The amendment included pregnancy
based discrimination under sex-discrimination.
Davis maintained that the controversial ques
tion now is whether or not employers have ade
quate justification to treat pregnant women dif
ferently in any respect. She said typical cases in
volve employers who set specific restrictions on
how long a pregnant women may work.
Calling occupational safety and health a "field
of tremendous importance not just to women, but
to men workers as well,'' Davis said the debate is
focused on employer justification of policies
which require female workers to be sterilized (to
prevent birth defects).
She went on to say that these policies don't take
into account two important concerns: a woman's
desire to work in the field of her choice and the
possible effect on a man's reproductive system.
Davis termed the companies' professed concern
for the possibility of birth defects a "ruse" and
said that she believed they were looking to avoid
future lawsuits.
Davis went on to discuss the issue of sexual har
rassment saying it's "something which happens
all the time." She mentioned that the circuit
courts have ruled sexual harrassment should be
considered along with other types of sexual dis
crimination under Title VII. In one "very favor
able" ruling the court said that even if one isn't
harmed, one should not have to tolerate such
treatment.
Davis expressed concern that this issue is often
"laughed at or not taken seriously enough."
Discussing discrimination in the academic
market, Davis said that much litigation took
place in this area during the 19705. She said that
there was a distinct problem of proving sex dis
crimination in this area because of-"personality
qualifications" and the "different standards of
judgments that the courts have applied to univer
sities.
Davis closed by saying that most of the women
who seek legal help have a "tremendous amount
of guts" and are dedicated to "fair play and equal
rights."

In the second lecture in the CROW (Center for
Research on Women) series, "Women and Equal
ity: Law and Justice," Nancy Davis, co-director
of Equal Rights Advocates, focused on the issues
on the "cutting edge" of women's rights. Davis
began by giving her receptive audience in Terman
Auditorium background information on working
women.
The average working woman has the same
education as the average working man, she said,
yet they are earning only three-fifths as much.
Most women work because of economic need, she
added, and two-thirds of them are single and are
the only breadwinners for themselves and their
dependents.
Women with high school diplomas are still
being paid less than men with elementary school
educations, Davis said, and women with college
degrees are still paid less than men with only
eighth-grade educations. Most women are work
ing in "dead-end'' jobs, she continued, noting that
80 percent of all clerical workers are women.
The national unemployment rate is highest for
black, young women and lowest for white, older
men, Davis said. Many of the women who come to
Equal Rights Advocates for help are not able to
afford a lawyer, or cannot find one with the neces
sary expertise in the particular type of sex dis
crimination which they are facing, she added, and
often their problems are not taken seriously.
