# 'Take back the night' marchers emphasize unity against rape
## 
### Carol Rose 
Increasing rape and violence in the
Stanford and Palo Alto communities
prompted more than 1000 women,
men. and children to gather in a show
of protest and unity last night. As the
crowd marched from the New Varsity
Theatre to Kresge Auditorium they
chanted. "People unite, take back the
night!" and held banners which read
"We are women, we are strong."
The march ended with a rally at
Kresge Auditorium. Music was pro
vided by women musicians.
The march and rally were organized
by the Take Back The Night Coalition
and endorsed by 13 community
groups.
United front
"One of the benefits of the march is
that we show a united front. Women's
groups, police, and the city are all
united on this issue," Susan St. John,
director of the Mid-Peninsula Rape
Crisis Center said.
"My sister was attacked two weeks
ago. She was courageous, but I still
feel angry about it, " said one
marcher.
"The march gives me a feeling of
community and strength," said anoth
er.
Steady increase
In Santa Clara County, reported
rapes have risen 50 percent since 1976.
This is a steady increase of 11 percent

each year, St. John said.
On the Stanford campus there has
been an average of two reported rapes
each year, according to Stanford Po
lice Chief Marvin Herrington.
"The biggest problem is keeping the
level of awareness up," he said.
"The march has positive effects on
the community because it raises the
level of awareness. Not only are peo
ple more alert about rape, but they are
also angry about it," Herrington said.
Dangerous spots
"The two most dangerous spots on
the Stanford Campus are around the
lake and at the Dish. But rapes can
happen anywhere, anytime," he
stressed.
"It is dangerous to talk about 'dan
gerous spots' on campus as if other
places were safe," Alice Supton, as
sistant dean of residential education
said.
Instances of male rape "usually oc
cur out on the street at night or they
are pulled into a van or something. Vi
olence against women is everywhere.
There is no pattern," Supton said.
Speaking out about rape in order to
increase reporting of such incidents
was the main issue at the post-march
assembly held in Kresge Auditorium.
"By breaking the silence with our
cries we might create a society where
women, as well as men, have the right
to walk alone," said Andrea Gakk, a

senior at Gunn High School and speak
er at the rally.
Selfish silence
"To remain silent is selfish. When
women are silently angry they only
succeed in harming themselves,"
Gakk said.
"The most hopeful thing that has
happened only in the last five years is
that people are talking about rape up
front, before it happens," Herrington
said.
Proposals for eliminating rape and
violence in the community expressed
at the rally emphasized the need for a
system that takes into account wom
en's need for safety as well as the need
for movement.
"We don't want to go from 'blaming
the victim' of five years ago to re
stricting the victim," Patricia
Brandt, assistant dean of student af
fairs said.
Safety concerns
Approximately "48.5 percent of
women in a recent study reported that
they think of their own safety almost
all of the time, versus only 7 percent of
the men surveyed," Brandt said.
"Rape is a result of the objectifica
tion of women pervasive throughout
society, and especially manifested in
the media," said one marcher.
"Only when people are seen as ob
jects can violence be done against

them." he said.
"Women are caught in a web of cul
tural indoctrination which prepares
them to be victims." said Rena Ro
senberg. the final speaker at the rally.
Rosenberg enunciated the proosals
to end rape which were submitted by
the various groups who endorsed the
march. Some of these recommenda
tions included placing signs at every
spot where a woman has been raped on
campus, educating women to become
more independent, raising the Univer
sity and city leaders' consciousness
about safety in the community,
greater conviction of rapists and
greater community sensitivity to sex
ism in the media.
