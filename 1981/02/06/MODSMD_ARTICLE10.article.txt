# Buddhist meditation 'broadening' thoughts
## 
### Diane Johnson 
Each Wednesday from 4 to 5:30 p.m. nine students
gather with 'their pillows in the Soto lounge to partici
pate in meditation. These students are all enrolled in
the five-unit freshman seminar "Hindu and Buddhist
meditation" taught by Diana Paul, a professor in the
Religious Studies Department.
The course begins with the history of Indian psy
chology and the development of yoga and ends with the
history of Zen Buddhism and the practice of sitting
meditation.
"It's the first class to ever change my way of think
ing, " says Brian Jans, one of the freshman partici
pants. "It's broadened my thought pattern out of linear
Western thought logic to the more direct and intuitive
Eastern way of thinking."
At each class session, two students lead hour-long
discussions on the readings assigned for the day. Then
the meditators share in a jug of apple juice, furnished

by a different student each week, before engaging in
yoga exercises.
"The apple juice is supposed to satisfy our appetites,
keeping our minds off dinner during meditation," com
mented class member Barry Beal.
Paul said the students "come in with tensions and
pressures but generally relax by the end of the session.
They seem to get in the lotus position more easily each
time, but students are more tense than ever this week
due to mid-terms."
During the meditation, the students are to count their
breaths, letting thoughts come in and out of their
minds. They are not to respond to these thoughts, but
just to accept them and proceed, said Paul.
Class assignments include one paper per week on top
ics such as the philosophical and psychological goals of
meditation, the historical development of meditative
discipline, and a personal assessment of the value of
meditation. Students are also required to meditate for

30 minutes each day, preferably after eating.
Paul's specific area of research lies in Chinese Bud
dhism. This year marks the first year she has in
structed in meditation, basically because she was not
sure how it would be received. Her next endeavor will
be a course this spring entitled: "Women, religion, and
politics," the first ever taught in the Religious Studies
Department concerning women.
Among the benefits those who meditate hope to
achieve are:
— development of the full potential of the individual;
— improved ability to think clearly;
— improved ability to get along well with others.
A certain amount of scientific research done on the
subject indicates that meditation may be effective in
the control of the causes of hypertension, cardiac ar
rest, high blood-pressure, and various psychosomatic
illnesses. It has also proved helpful in the treatment of
drug abuse.


As part of the requirements for their "Hindu and Buddhist Meditation" seminar, these freshmen meditate once each week in Soto Lounge
