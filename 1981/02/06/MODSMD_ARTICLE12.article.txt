## End aid to El Salvador 
### 
Several points are too often ignored in
the debate over El Salvador and the ques
tion of whether the United States should
send aid to the reigning regime.
The central issue for the United States
to consider in determining its response to
the situation is whether it is proper for it
to take an active role in hammering out
the future of the Salvadoran people.
The United States, and particularly the
Reagan administration, must realize that
the times have passed when we could send
in the Marines, either figuratively or liter
ally, to bend Latin America to our will.
The United States should not regard El
Salvador as another Dominican Republic
to be invaded, or another Chile, ripe for
CIA subterfuge.
By aiding the junta in any way, America
implicitly endorses it. Though the aid we
send is supposedly for humanitarian
purposes, little of it filters down to the
poor who really need it.

The United States is unwisely lending its
credibility to the military-dominated gov
ernment by sending it aid. The arguments
for this policy are not advanced by the pat
ent absurdity of the "distinction " between
so-called lethal and non-lethal weapons or
the distinction between economic and mil
itary aid.
The economic issues underlying the
Salvadoran struggle should not be reduced
to a Reaganistic, oversimplified "Com
munism vs. Free World'' dichotomy. The
Salvadoran economy is dominated by an
elite that holds a disproportionate share of
the monetary and political resources. This
elite has used its influence to block land
reform that would have given the peasants
a fair share in the crops they raise.
But the merits of that issue are not as
important as respect for sovereignty. The
United States cannot justly intervene in
the situation. The outcome of the revolu
tion is for El Salvador to decide for itself.
