Nein to nine
It's clear to me that Steve
Vineberg (Daily. Jan. 3), per
haps because of limited im
agination or experience, didn't
get what 9 to 5 was about. When
he sneers at Fonda's portrayal
of Judy's entry into her first job,
it's obvious he has never been or
known a woman trying to do
right and be proper in an alien
world. And why does he de
scribe these as "classical
scenes of female incom
petence?" Ah. well, perhaps he
can't relate to Woody Allen
either.
He also feels Fonda can't play
a woman of average in
telligence. Apparently
Vineberg isn't able to dist
inguish between intelligence
and insecurity. Or did he view
Judy as necessarily average
since she had not gone from high
school to college to an executive
position?
And yes, if more women were
in a position to, they would in
stitute humane changes, result
ing in greater smiles, happiness
and, I dare say, productivity for

all. In the male dominated work
world, outside management
consultants and psychologists
are hired to try to teach those in
high level positions to deal with
staff as human beings, to grasp
that a happy worker is a more
productive worker.
The style of this film was to
take reality to an extreme,
hence the comic aspects of it. I
thought it funny and well
grounded in realities of which
Vineberg apparently has no
comprehension. I guess it's like
mathematics â€” if you miss the
first few lessons, the rest won't
make any sense. Vineberg's re
view told me more about him
than the film, even though I
would agree it had its share of
weaknesses.

Not in words
It's not so much the words
themselves which bother you so
much, Rebecca Fox (Daily,
Jan. 26), as the way they are
said. Why should that be so sur
prising? Women, as indicated
by recent research at the Uni
versity of Chicago under the su

pervision of Jerre Levy, exhibit
a statistically significant ability
to perceive inflection of voice
and non-verbal communication
in general. I believe that be
cause of the female ability to
perceive these nuances of lan
guage somewhere along the way
or perhaps throughout your
academic career you were in
doctrinated with a negative at
titude toward women.
However. I am uncertain as
to whether emphasis toward
change in the medium of com
municating attitudes will neces
sarily change the attitudes
themselves. The word sis
terhood can convey the same
sort of derogatory connotation
as brotherhood .
Yes, Ms. Fox, I mean words
such as mankind. In the mean
time, however, let us focus our
collective attention on the un
derlying attitudes which are
being transmitted. Because
when attitudes start changing
the spoken word takes on an en
tirely new meaning.
