## Only white racism opposes King holiday 
### 
You know, it's really quite
easy to grow up white. When I
stop to think about growing up
with a whole lot of people of my
*skin color, of my culture, who
share my basic values and who
enjoy a "system" (from the
government on down to the
Stanford administration) that
more or less represents me and
my needs, it makes life pretty
easy.
Whites tend to develop a
sense of superiority, often un
conscious, that makes'it easy to
forget that we are not the best,
the brightest — not God's
chosen race. Some talk about
"nuking" the Iranians, some
show concern about the spread
of Communism (democracy
being the white American way),
and some tell Polack jokes on
the weekend to wind down. If
this stereotype of the white
American does not fit. there is
no denying that, along with eve

ry other race, we're prejudiced
in some way. It is just much eas
ier for whites to get away with
prejudice in many subtle ways.
I felt disappointed reading
"Prejudices: A Separatist's
View" (Daily, Jan. 26). The au
thor felt a national holiday for
Martin Luther King would offer
a "ridiculous solution to a seri
ous problem," racism, which is
only one example of the in
justices in the world which each
of us must fight. This is a gross
oversimplification of the prob
lem of racism, which is danger
ously easy to simplify, especial
ly for those who have grown up
white.
Look below the surface and
consider our grade school his
torical heroes. George Washing
ton's birthday is a holiday. But
how many white grade school
children know what King stood
for? Most white parents do not
really know or care. But these

children are part of the future
and should learn as much about
King as about Washington. They
should be taught that not every
one is white or American.
Whites talk about injustice and
then do very little about ad
dressing the real problems of
deeply embedded racism and
cultural intolerance.
We should learn to open and
expand our minds to respect, un
derstand and accept different
cultures. The white child should
learn that the easy life he knows
is presently unfairly limited to
whites. He should learn to move
over and help make everyone's
life easier by not assuming, cat
egorizing, stereotyping or box
ing himself into a naive white
corner.
The more whites cut them
selves off from the reality of the
problem, the less able and will
ing they are to respect non
whites and recognize them as
equals. One would really have to
be superhuman to live passively
and happily on a shortage of re
spect and recognition. It must
be horrible to be followed in de
partment stores by suspicious
whites, to have to tolerate racist
remarks, to know that you are
confined and limited by a socie
ty that doesn't really want you,
and to know there is no escape.
How can we dare to resent their
defensive prejudice from the
safety of our ivory tower?
Non-whites do not need to
hear anything from me about
racial prejudice or cultural in
tolerance. But a lot of white peo
ple need to open their eyes, ears

and minds, to learn from and un
derstand those who live outside
the protective white umbrella.
White Americans have had it
easy for so long at the incredible
expense of others. This is in
justice.
As a white American, I have
debts to pay. We owe it to
blacks, and to every American,
to recognize King as a model of
open-mindedness, tolerance and
understanding, by making his
birthday a national holiday.
Some people will take such a
holiday as another excuse to re
lax and think of themselves but
not everyone will. If only a few
people realize the significance
of the holiday, it will still be
worthwhile. The holiday would
remind Americans of what he
stood for. Then maybe our chil
dren could begin to learn more
about what justice ought to be.

Non-whites do not need to
hear anything from me about
racial prejudice or cultural in
tolerance. But a lot of white peo
ple need to open their eyes, ears

and minds, to learn from and un
derstand those who live outside
the protective white umbrella.
White Americans have had it
easy for so long at the incredible
expense of others. This is in
justice.
As a white American, I have
debts to pay. We owe it to
blacks, and to every American,
to recognize King as a model of
open-mindedness, tolerance and
understanding, by making his
birthday a national holiday.
Some people will take such a
holiday as another excuse to re
lax and think of themselves but
not everyone will. If only a few
people realize the significance
of the holiday, it will still be
worthwhile. The holiday would
remind Americans of what he
stood for. Then maybe our chil
dren could begin to learn more
about what justice ought to be.

You know, it's really quite
easy to grow up white. When I
stop to think about growing up
with a whole lot of people of my
*skin color, of my culture, who
share my basic values and who
enjoy a "system" (from the
government on down to the
Stanford administration) that
more or less represents me and
my needs, it makes life pretty
easy.
Whites tend to develop a
sense of superiority, often un
conscious, that makes'it easy to
forget that we are not the best,
the brightest — not God's
chosen race. Some talk about
"nuking" the Iranians, some
show concern about the spread
of Communism (democracy
being the white American way),
and some tell Polack jokes on
the weekend to wind down. If
this stereotype of the white
American does not fit. there is
no denying that, along with eve

ry other race, we're prejudiced
in some way. It is just much eas
ier for whites to get away with
prejudice in many subtle ways.
I felt disappointed reading
"Prejudices: A Separatist's
View" (Daily, Jan. 26). The au
thor felt a national holiday for
Martin Luther King would offer
a "ridiculous solution to a seri
ous problem," racism, which is
only one example of the in
justices in the world which each
of us must fight. This is a gross
oversimplification of the prob
lem of racism, which is danger
ously easy to simplify, especial
ly for those who have grown up
white.
Look below the surface and
consider our grade school his
torical heroes. George Washing
ton's birthday is a holiday. But
how many white grade school
children know what King stood
for? Most white parents do not
really know or care. But these

children are part of the future
and should learn as much about
King as about Washington. They
should be taught that not every
one is white or American.
Whites talk about injustice and
then do very little about ad
dressing the real problems of
deeply embedded racism and
cultural intolerance.
We should learn to open and
expand our minds to respect, un
derstand and accept different
cultures. The white child should
learn that the easy life he knows
is presently unfairly limited to
whites. He should learn to move
over and help make everyone's
life easier by not assuming, cat
egorizing, stereotyping or box
ing himself into a naive white
corner.
The more whites cut them
selves off from the reality of the
problem, the less able and will
ing they are to respect non
whites and recognize them as
equals. One would really have to
be superhuman to live passively
and happily on a shortage of re
spect and recognition. It must
be horrible to be followed in de
partment stores by suspicious
whites, to have to tolerate racist
remarks, to know that you are
confined and limited by a socie
ty that doesn't really want you,
and to know there is no escape.
