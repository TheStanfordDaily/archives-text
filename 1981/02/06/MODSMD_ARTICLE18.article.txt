## Debunking great myths of Stanford 
### 
Stanford, like Sodom and
Camelot before it. is a place that
has generated many myths.
Back East, one hears it spoken
of wistfully as a kind of country
club for wealthy WASPs, a
palm-bedecked paradise where
there are no distribution re
quirements, no failing grades,
and no proctors at exams. You
hear of the perfect weather, the
romantic mission architecture,
the acres of firm, tanned flesh,
and the advantages of living
only a stone's throw away from
San Francisco (if one is able to
throw a stone 40 miles, that is).
The reality, however, falls
short of the mark. It comes as a
terrible blow to realize that
there are students at Stanford
who own neither a BMW nor
a Porsche; who don't know how
to suri. don't wear pink Lacoste
shirts or designer jeans, and
may actually have some inkling
of intellectual curiosity. After
weathering this rude shock, it
seemed only fitting that I should
seek out and vanquish the other
Great Myths of Stanford.
/. f.ahe Ijcigunita. It seems
patently ridiculous that a shal
low, dirty depression in the

ground will ever be transformed
by mere rainfall into a lake,
even a shallow, dirty lake. After
all, if there is enough rainfall to
fill Lake Lagunita to a depth of,
say, six feet, why isn't the entire
campus flooded by that same six
feet of water? This would not
necessarily be a bad thing — at
least Alber's wall would be un
der water.

The latest edition of the Yale "Insider's
Guide to Colleges" reports that Stanford is
now a campus of jocks, preppies and pre
professionals/

Clearly, if Lake Lag fills with
water every winter, there must
be forces other than rainwater
at work. Vast natural springs,
for example. Clever under
ground pipelines. Midnight
bucket brigades. Obviously,
someone wants to keep the
source of Lake Lag secret, if
only to protect it from the South
ern California agricultural in
terests.
2. Stanford Wealth. Now
then, who really believes that
Stanford gets all its money from
endowments and Federal
grants? Have you ever seen an
endowment, or a federal grant?
Do you know anyone who has?
For that matter, if you were an
alumnus, would you give money
to Stanford? Remember, I'm
talking megabucks — the kind of
cash it takes to build SLAC.
Doesn't it strike you as just a
teeny bit suspicious? Now, what
kind of business routinely takes
in this kind of money? Or
ganized crime, of course. And
how do they do it?
That brings me to another
question: just what kind of crop
is the University growing in
Lake Lag during the dry season?
That's no alfalfa crop. And what
about all those little brown
plants growing on Stanford land
in the foothills? And don't forget
about all the laboratories on
campus. Of course, I'm not
making any accusations, mind

you, but one could hardly im
agine a better case of supply
moving to where the demand is.
Hoover Tower. What exact
ly is on floors two through nine
of the Hoover Tower? Floors 10
to 13 are said to be offices, and I
imagine plushly decorated
suites filled with cigar smoke,
mementos of the late Herbert
Hoover, and stodgy, middle-

aged reactionaries. Below that,
there are no outside windows,
except narrow slits that re
semble the arrow ports of a me
dieval castle. The elevator
doesn't even stop there, and the
guide only makes vague refer
ence to mysterious library
stacks, forbidden to Stanford
students who are undoubtedly
perceived as a ragged mob of
grubby liberals.
The possiblities are intrigu
ing. Those eight floors would be
an ideal location for the top-se
cret Western headquarters of
NOR AD Defense Command, for
example. Or a swell place to in
stall four 60-foot Minuteman
ICBM s, ready to emerge at the
push of a button from the tow
er's minarets. Or — and this
would be right in keeping with
the Institution's conservative
leanings — the tower might se
crete a whole platoon of CIA
agents and their surveillance
equipment. Something to think
about the next time you're
stopped in White Plaza by a
member of the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade.
/. California (iirls. Thanks to
the Beach Boys, we hear a great
deal about California women
back East. It's not until you get
out here that you hear the joke
that nine out of ten women in
California are beautiful, while
the tenth goes to Stanford. All
Stanford women may not be the

bronze goddesses that fill the
thoughts of Eastern men during
the long, cold winters of New
York and Boston, but there's
something to be said by both
sexes for flesh so willingly ex
posed to the torrid heat of Janu
ary.
•5. California (iuys. There is a
pervasive notion in the East
that all California men are mus
cle-bound surfer types, but the
truth, as usual, is nothing like
the myth. From my many con
versations with Stanford wom
en, I gather that men are not
judged by the size of their
biceps, brain, or anything else
— but it is essential to have
perfect hair, and lots of the
stuff.
One wonders at the cost of
maintaining such a head of hair:
every sleek, dusty-brown strand
locked in perfect alignment
with every other, rivalling even
the formidable scalps of Mark
Hamill and Shaun Cassidy. Are
long hours from dawn until
morning class spent in the ritual
cultivation of such hirsute per
fection? What exotic and illegal
substances are used in this daily
rite? Is there — dare I say it —
even some recourse to the de
monaic black arts?
6. White Punhs on Dope.
Someone got it mixed up. It
should have been "white dopes
on punk."
7. Intellectuals. The latest
edition of the Yale Insider's
(iuide to Colleges reports that
Stanford is now a campus of
jocks, preppies, and pre-pro
fessionals, and warns pros
pective applicants not to expect
discussions of Nietzche or Con
rad over the dinner table. While
Stanford is hardly a campus of
high-powered intellectuals like,
say, Sonoma State or Cal Hay
ward, it is not the cultural
wasteland that many glib East
erners make it out to be. It's all
very well to say that Californi
ans exercise their bodies at the
expense of their minds, but
those same smug Yalies and
Princetonians should try con
centrating on fluid mechanics
or Absalom, Absalom while the
sun is shining outside. Besides,
if you want intellectuals, there's
always Foothill.

Back East, one hears it spoken

palm-bedecked paradise where
there are no distribution re
quirements, no failing grades,
and no proctors at exams. You
hear of the perfect weather, the
romantic mission architecture,
the acres of firm, tanned flesh,
and the advantages of living
only a stone's throw away from
San Francisco (if one is able to
throw a stone 40 miles, that is).
The reality, however, falls
short of the mark. It comes as a
terrible blow to realize that
there are students at Stanford
who own neither a BMW nor

may actually have some inkling

low, dirty depression in the

ground will ever be transformed
by mere rainfall into a lake,
even a shallow, dirty lake. After
all, if there is enough rainfall to
fill Lake Lagunita to a depth of,
say, six feet, why isn't the entire
campus flooded by that same six
feet of water? This would not
necessarily be a bad thing — at
least Alber's wall would be un

2. Stanford Wealth. Now
then, who really believes that
Stanford gets all its money from
endowments and Federal
grants? Have you ever seen an
endowment, or a federal grant?
Do you know anyone who has?
For that matter, if you were an
alumnus, would you give money
to Stanford? Remember, I'm
talking megabucks — the kind of
cash it takes to build SLAC.
Doesn't it strike you as just a
teeny bit suspicious? Now, what
kind of business routinely takes
in this kind of money? Or
ganized crime, of course. And
how do they do it?
That brings me to another
question: just what kind of crop
is the University growing in
Lake Lag during the dry season?
That's no alfalfa crop. And what
about all those little brown
plants growing on Stanford land
in the foothills? And don't forget
about all the laboratories on
campus. Of course, I'm not
making any accusations, mind

you, but one could hardly im
agine a better case of supply
