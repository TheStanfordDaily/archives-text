## Support of right not an apology for Nazism 
### 
In past contributions (Daily,
Jan. 13 and Jan. 26), I have
pointed to communist tactics of
camouflage, front-building, and
penetration of allied organiza
tions on the road to power in
Central America and
elsewhere. Craig Richards now
takes me to task (I)aily, Feb. 3)
for my "strident anti-com
munism" and for engaging in a
"smear campaign." To cap it
all, your correspondent sug
gests that I, a German Jew by
origin and a soldier in the Brit
ish Army in World War 11, am
led by my "right wing logic" to
believe that "millions of Jews
and other ethnic peoples of Eu
rope massacred by the right
wing German Third Reich were
indeed 'better dead than red.'"
Let us first look at Nicaragua,
a country that Richards finds so
praiseworthy. The left took
power in Nicaragua in the guise

of a natonal democratic liber
ation movement. The Sand
inistas contained non-Marxists
as well as Marxists. While the
struggle was in progress, the
Sandinistas, and their sup
porters in this country, played
down the Sandinistas' Cuban
and Soviet connections as well
as their socialist aims. The pro-
Sandinistas vilified as fanatical
anti-communists all those who
pointed out the communist con
nections of the Frente Sand
inista de Liberacion Nacional.
Now Marxist domination
seems secure. The balance of
political power has changed,
and so, suddenly, does the tone
of Nicaragua's official pronoun
cements. On a recent trip to
North Korea, Tomas Borge,
Minister of the Interior in the
Nicaraguan government, ex
plained that Nicaragua stood
firmly allied with all "social
ist" countries against the "im
perialist" United States, that
the United States would have to
leave South Korea, and that the
Nicaraguan revolutionaries
would continue the world wide
struggle until "imperialism"
had been everywhere over
thrown. No more shilly-shally
ing now about peaceful coex
istence between differing social
systems!
Nicaragua stands firmly

aligned with Moscow. A recent
communique jointly issued by
Soviet and visiting Nicaraguan
dignitaries in the USSR has ex
pressed Nicaraguan support for
Soviet action in Afghanistan.
Nicafaguans are fighting in El
Salvadro. In Nicaragua itself,
the governing junta has na
tionalized the major industries;
the workers are required to join
a single union controlled by the
Sandinistas; there is strict
censorship; something like
12,000 Nicaraguans are re
portedly in prison, a small
number by Cuban standards,
but many by the standards of a
small Central American coun
try. No matter what
Nicaragua's liberal apologists
have said in the past, Nicaragua
is set on the stony road to Marx
ism-Leninism.
I do not condone the Hitler re
gime; I detest its memory.
Richards' interpretation not
withstanding, the regime set up
by Hitler's National Socialist
German Workers' Party (the
correct name of the Nazi party)
had nothing in common with
right-wing regimes of the period
like those of General Metaxas,
Colonel Beck, or President
Salazar National Socialism in
Germany instead shared a great
many features with Stalin's ver
sion of socialism as practiced

during the Soviet Union.
Both regimes were total
itarian in that they claimed to
tal control over every aspect of
national life. Both regimes were
profoundly anti-religious in in
spiration. Both, for all practical
purposes, endowed their respec
tive leadership with the divine
qualities of being all-wise, all
powerful, and all-good. The Na
tional Socialists, like Stalin's
communists, practised the cult
of personality, and rejected
both parliamentary democracy
and the sanctity of person and
property.
Both glorified the armed
struggle and used mass liquida
tions as a normal instrument of
policy (with the difference that
Stalin managed to kill even
more human beings than
Hitler). National Socialism and
Communism alike created vast
refugee problems.
For all the communists' prop
aganda, the oppressed workers
always seek to leave communist
countries; they seek refuge in
capitalist countries from com
munist oppression, whether in
Cuba. East Germany, Cam
bodia, or China. Like National
Socialism, communism has led
to misery and murder wherever
it has been tried.
