# Faculty shows concern over student integrity

In discussing the University Honor
Code yesterday, Faculty Senate mem
bers expressed concern that students
seem willing to guarantee their own
integrity, but not to turn in other stu
dents they see cheating.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons explained that 14 to 20 cases of
Honor Code violations each year reach
the University judicial system estab
lished to treat code infringements. He
said the standard outcome for stu
dents found guilty of an Honor Code vi
olation is a one-quarter suspension
from the University and a loss of cred
it for the course.
Lyons said the number of violations
has remained fairly even over the
years, with a slight increase last year.
Many faculty members also ex
pressed concern over the requirement
that exams not be proctored. Biology
Prof. Robert Simoni summed up the
problem: "I leave the room so as not
to proctor, then I'm chased down by
students who need help. So I usually
end up staying in the room I don't con
sider it proctoring. and I don't think
most students do either. But after
wards some students tell me that they
consider my presence equivalent to
proctoring.''
President Donald Kennedy said his
solution is to wait outside the door,
even though he said he often feels like
he is lurking
Directly related to proctoring is the
question of whether students believe
they have a third party responsibility
to turn in cheaters Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. Robert Eustis said a
major faculty concern is that students
don't feel they have this responsi
bility "Professors," he said, "realize
that when they leave the room there
may be cheating, but students don't
want to see it and try not to." He cited
this as a major topic for student dis
cussion and settlement.
Citing her recent Honor Code sur

vey, University Director of Research
Sally Cole said, "Not many students
said they felt personally threatened by
cheating." But Cole noted contradic
tions. "Many students said they know
a lot of cheating goes on, even though
they don't do or see it," said Cole.
Engineering-Economic Systems
Prof. Ronald Howard said if students
don't live up to the third party respon
sibility it hurts them, not the pro
fessor.
The senate also discussed the re
sponsibility of the faculty to uphold
the Honor Code. Kennedy said he be
lieves the Honor Code is defined first
as an undertaking of the students. He
said it is "technically incorrect to talk
of violations by faculty."
But he said he believes the Honor
Code firmly establishes that the facul
ty is charged with carrying out the
sections of the Code requiring faculty
to place their confidence in students
and not to proctor exams.
The senate also received a report
from the Provost's Task Force on
Computing The report is a proposal
for the future of the newly established
Stanford Center for Information Tech
nology. Task Force Chairman William
Miller said the main emphasis of the
report is the establishment of a Uni
versity network for rapid communica
tion and information sharing As part
of the establishment of this network
the task force recommends a small- or
moderate-size computer system that
will connect various parts of the Uni
versity.
The system will be used by faculty,
staff and students. Faculty members
can use it to prepare and revise jour
nal articles and class notes, coordi
nate conference schedules with col
leagues. and search files
Staff members will be able to use
the computer to prepare or analyze
data, send and receive messages and
process various University forms.
