## Reagan plans stronger Congressional ties 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Charles (
Stenholm, a Democratic con- t
gressman from Texas, never set t
foot in the Oval Office during t
Jimmy Carter's presidency and a
never had a private meeting I
with Carter.
But there Stenholm was the (
other day, sitting down, talking c
and joking with the office's new t
Republican occupant. More im- I
portant, the 42-year-old con- £
gressman was agreeing to help £
line up support among Demo- s
crats for some of President I
Ronald Reagan's legislative s
goals. 1
"It was obviously a very im
pressive meeting for a c
sophomore congressman," \
Stenholm said later. "I found «
the president to be relaxed and l
very friendly and with that kind \
of demeanor I think he's going to (
be very persuasive." t
The meeting with Stenholm is <
part of an aggressive new style i
of dealing with Congress that ]
Reagan has brought to the White |
House. It is a style that stands in

sharp contrast with that of
Carter, who never managed to
build a close working rela
tionship with Congress, even
though both the House and Sen
ate then were controlled by the
Democrats.
In fact, Reagan is met in the
Capitol Wednesday with a group
of key senators of both parties in
the little-used President's
Room. The meeting, the first of
a series of such sessions planned
at the Capitol by Reagan, re
sumed a practice started by
President Woodrow Wilson but
seldom used since the days of
President Franklin Roosevelt.
The Reagan approach toward
dealing with Congress began
with the installation of a sea
soned team of congressional
liaison specialists, headed by
Max Friedersdorf, White House
director of congressional rela
tions. And it includes regular
stroking of key congressional
leaders — both Democrats and
Republicans — by Reagan
himself.
The session with Stenholm is

typical.
As coordinator of the Con
servative Democratic Forum,
comprising 41 House members,
Stenholm could be a crucial ally
for Reagan. With the Re
publicans controlling the Sen
ate, 53-47, the principal battle
ground for the president's legis
lative program, including con
troversial proposals to slash
federal spending, is expected to
be the House, where Democrats
outnumber Republicans 243 to
191 (with one seat vacant).
Despite an enthusiastic re
ception on the Hill so far,
Friedersdorf, who has been
through congressional battles
before as a Capitol Hill lobbyist
for former Presidents Richard
Nixon and Gerald Ford, knows
that the administration will be
in for a tough fight when it be
gins proposing cutbacks in spe
cific programs.
Friedersdorf's first con
gratulatory message after he
was appointed came from
former Nixon White House lob
byist Bryce Harlow. It included

a wry comment on the task
ahead: "Happiness is being di
rector of congressional rela
tions in a White House that
wants to increase federal spend
ing."
Friedersdorf said: "If you
want to cut spending, that does
cause unhappiness, of course.
Any proposal to reduce spending
arouses constituency groups
who complain to the Hill and
make it very difficult to build a
coalition."
Howls of protest already are
being heard. Secretary of State
Alexander Haig, for one, has
joined congressional leaders
and some of America's major
allies in vehemently opposing
severe slashes in foreign aid
that David Stockman, director
of the Office of Management
and Budget, has proposed. And
suggestions by administration
officials that certain Social Se
curity benefits be eliminated
have aroused angry reaction
from senior citizens and retired
persons groups.

"We are selling what is per
ceived by some as bitter politi
cal medicine." Friedersdorf
said in a lengthy interview.
"But I'm optimistic. The pend
ulum has swung to the point that
the country wants to do some
thing about inflation even if it
takes reduced federal spending.
Reagan is leaving little to
chance in his efforts to see that
the votes are there. Even before
taking office, he stimulated
good will on Capitol Hill by visit
ing congressional leaders of
both parties. And Democrats in
Congress applauded him for re
taining Mike Mansfield, the
former Senate Democratic
leader, as ambassador to Japan.
