## New bilingual policy to have little effect 
### Los Angeles Times 
The Reagan administration's decision
this week to withdraw proposed new federal
bilingual education rules may have a sym
bolic importance, but it is not expected to
have much immediate effect, experts in the
field say.
Existing court mandates, continuing fed
eral guidelines and voluntary compliance
agreements will keep most existing bil
ingual programs in place and will lead to
many more such programs, said the
educators, lawyers and past and present
government officials who were interviewed
in recent days.
Secretary of Education Terrel Bell, in his
announcement Monday, said that he was

withdrawing the new federal regulations,
two years in the works, because they were
"harsh, inflexible, burdensome, un
workable and incredibly costly."
Among all those adjectives, the key one
seems to be "inflexible," for a basic Reagan
administration principle is that states and
local school districts, not the federal gov
ernment, should decide education policy.
In Lau vs. Nichols, a 1974 case involving
Chinese-speaking pupils in the San Francis
co schools, the Supreme Court ruled that
students who speak little or no English have
a right to special language services.
The court did not specify what this in
struction should be, but since 1975 the Office
for Civil Rights has employed a set of "Lau

remedies" to determine whether or not a
school district is complying with the Su
preme Court ruling.
In most cases, the Lau remedies have re
quired bilingual instruction
The intent of bilingual instruction is to
permit a child to keep up with math, social
studies and other subjects in his native lan
guage while he is mastering English lan
guage skills.
At a Tuesday breakfast in Washington
with Illinois educators and school board
members, Bell said the Department of
Education would continue to enforce the
Lau remedy guidelines until a new set of
federal regulations could be drawn up.
