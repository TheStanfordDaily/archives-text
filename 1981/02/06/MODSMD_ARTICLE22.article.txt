# Deukmejian plans gubernatorial race

### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — "If I'm
ever going to run (for gov
ernor)." California Attorney
General George Deukmejian
said Wednesday, "this is the
best time for me to do it."
The Republican of
ficeholder said in an in
terview that he has been hap
py for the past two years in
his present job, but nonethe
less is looking forward to a
prospective battle for the
California governor's job
next year.
First step was to form an
exploratory committee this
week to raise at least
$250,000 and to sound out po
litical sentiment to see if this
is time to make his move.
There appears little doubt
in Deukmejian's mind that
his committee will urge him
to run. And in prospect of
that, the attorney general

will be battling for attention
this weekend at the biennial
Republican state convention
in Sacramento where all
prospective statewide of
ficeseekers will be show
casing their talents.
Timing — when to run for
higher office and when to lay
back — is important in politi
cal careers and Deukmejian
said that is one reason why
this is his time to move.
The clear implication of
his remark was that any ad
ministration — and particu
larly Brown's — will have
built up an army of enemies
after eight years.
But beyond that, he added,
there is "the extent of the ex
perience I have already ac
quired." compared to the ex
perience of Lt. Gov. Mike
Curb, his major GOP foe at
this stage.
