Cafe Borrone
2022 Broadway
Redwood Citv

Monday-Thursday — 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Friday nights until 10 p.m.
A green canopy leads off the street into
the Cafe Borrone in Redwood City. Those
who enter snack their way through many an
hors d'oeuvre, sip wine by the glass, and
share humble talk. The coffee house-wine
bar ambience encourages customers to sit
and relax while sharing fine cuisine and
good spirits.
The Cafe Borrone resembles the village
inns of Italy's San Gimignano region.
Wooden chairs, some adorned with em
broidered cushions, complement the
matching tables. Dark wood floors, pastel
wallpaper and soft lighting soothe the eyes
and mind.
Intrigued? The menu offers such dishes
as port-flavored cheese appetizers, chicken
liver hors d'oeuvres, variety salads,
baguettes, Italian tortas that resemble
fresh vegetable frittatas, extraordinary
quiche, and apple cognac cake. Truly this
continental coffee house and wine bar meets
premium standards, even though nothing on
the menu exceeds $7.95.
The long list of specialties and unusual
dishes appeals to food and wine "samplers"
who dine by tasting a bit of everything or
dered. Roy Borrone, the owner, recom
mends sharing dishes and disapproves of
more traditional dining in his cafe. My com
panion and I relaxed immediately and
agreed to share several dishes.

We started with "Nonnies own antipasto"
a blend of tuna and vegetables, served with
a baguette <$4.50>. Next, we tried the ap
petizer that enjoys the notoriety at Bor
rone's that escargot does elsewhere, the
"Calamari salad."
The rest of the hors d'oeuvre list is equal
ly delightful. It describes such plates as a
cheese ball, garlic herbed with pump
ernickel bread, zucchini patties sauteed in
olive oil, and cheese blintzes with preserves
and sour cream.
For supper the "Quiche of the day"
($4.95) and the special "Italian torta" won
our acclaim. Quiche lovers will adore the
fluted pie crust filled with a light layer of
fresh spinach leaves and another layer of
thinly sliced mushrooms in a seemingly
whipped mixture of soft cheeses, particu
larly Gruyere and Jarlsberg. We munched
our way happily through the Italian torta, an
egg and cheese casserole filled with good
things like Italian sausage, carrots, broc
coli, and zucchini pieces.
The wine and coffee bar attracts the most
attention among customers. It displays the
wines featured daily on the premuim wine
list and the many imported beers that are
available. The wines can be tasted for $1.75
to $2.75 per long-stemmed glass. Bottles of
reds, whites and champagnes can be
selected as well, for prices ranging from
$5.50 to $18. We liked the Richard Carey
Blanc Fume, 1979, and the Mill Creek
Cabernet Sauvignon, 1976.
If a diner is tempted to overeat, I would
recommend leaving Borrone's quickly after
the quiche. A glass case displays the men

ace of "fresh, gooey, rich and delicious ex
travaganzas prepared daily" for dessert.
Vanilla custard, a velvety, almost pudding
like custard sprinkled with fine nutmeg, and
specials like mocha almond torte and
almond crust shell filled with mocha
mousse and topped with whipped cream and
toasted almonds, make the choice a difficult
one for those who stay. I recall vividly the
desserts passed by: cheesecake, English
trifle, Swiss chocolate cake, mocha java
cake, chocolate mousse, and the original ap
ple cognac cake.
A steaming coffee drink complements a
meal everytime. The coffee concoctions,
imaginative desserts themselves, taste
great. I particularly recommend the Cafe
Orgeat, "an espresso, essence of almond
and steamed milk sprinkled with crushed
toasted almonds in a large-mouth glass." Or
try the Cappuccino San Francisco for a
"combination of 'creme de cafe' espresso
and steamed Chocolate milk." A Cafe Bor
rone is an espresso with steamed chocolate,
topped with cinnamon and crushed toasted
almonds. Other specialties include Italian
sodas, fresh fruit frappes, and frosted
mocha.
Roy Borrone's main concern is preserv
ing a coffeehouse-wine bar atmosphere. The
Cafe Borrone even offers a Thursday night
wine tasting series. Each occasion is a
"brown bag" affair: the wine's label re
mains a secret during the tasting. As the
menu states, "classic simplicity" and"the
freshest ingredients" make up "an authen
tic continental fare" all day.
