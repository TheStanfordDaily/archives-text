Jose's
2275 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6522
A large sign outside pro
claims "the worst pizza in
town." This alone helps to
distinguish Jose's from the
abundance of pizza estab
lishments in the area.
The atmosphere is un
assuming. In the style of
many pizzerias, the food is
prepared out in the open. In
fact, the pizza is made some
what in the center of the res
taurant. Those who have
missed seeing the pizza-mak
ing process can view Jose
himself twirling the dough
The dining room is
spacious and somehow fes
tive. There are no booths
such as those at Ramona's
and many pizzerias. Seating
is not designed for privacy.
Rather, it almost encourages
getting acquainted with fel
low patrons.
With wooden tables and
red and white checked
gingham curtains. Jose's fits
the traditional pizzeria ster
eotype on first glance. That
is, until you sink your teeth

into the Argentinean pizza
The thick, white sourdough
crust is amazingly filling.
The dough is airy and
chewy. Two different Eu
ropean cheeses (Josewas re
luctant to reveal their
names* were melted atop a
thinly spread layer of tomato
sauce.
A Cuban pizza with wheat
germ crust is also available.
Both pizzas are offered in 10-
inch, 14-inch and 16-inch
sizes. Prices range from
$4.50 to $12.75. And if you and
your eating partner can't
agree on a type, an individual
8-inch pizza with wheat germ
crust is available.
The pizzeria also em
phasizes smoked barbecue
specialties, which Jose calls
"the baddest barbecue in
town." The smoked spare
ribs, somewhat small for
$7.25. were found to be mea
ty, juicy and spicy (but not
ton hot).
Cooked over wood
charcoal, the ribs were about
six inches long.
Spanish rice and black
blood beans accompanied the
barbecue offerings. The rice

was standard fare, but the
blood beans provided a wel
come change from bland
baked beans typical of casual
eateries.
Our empanada <$4 75>, a
popular dish of Latin Ameri
ca, was a beef and cheese pie
baked with olives and
raisins. Don't be scared off
by the combination. A rich,
buttery crust encased the
piping hot filling. The mound
of pastry was placed in an
oval ceramic dish.
Jose's is suitable for both
vegetarians and the
carnivorous. In addition to a
large salad bar, which can be
ordered by itself or with an
entree, regular offerings in
clude a cheese empanada
and several vegetarian
pizzas.
Take-outs and special or
ders are available. Lunch
and dinner are served daily,
and Jose's is closed Mon-;
days.
If you have ulcers coming
on from midterms, maybe
Jose's is not the place for
you. Otherwise, go out and
have a good time.
