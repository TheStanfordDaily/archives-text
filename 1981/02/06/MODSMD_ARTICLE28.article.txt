# Privacy from the press?
## Spo bros speak out PRO

» Being a Stanford coach is a
special experience, and one that
I'm sure that most who have
been there would say is filled
with satisfactions. But while
some aspects are different,
there are others that are stan
dard for any coach, and one of
them is his right, indeed, his
duty, to keep some things from
(he press.
There are many reasons, and
good ones, that coaches have for
keeping their "dirty laundry"
out of the press.
Coaches have many responsi
bilities to many different peo
ple. However, their main re
sponsibility is to protect the in
tegrity of their players and
staff.
Sure, they also have a respon
sibility to the fans: to provide
them with an entertaining and
competitive version of their
sport (i.e., to win). That respon
sibility does not include inform
ing them of everything that goes
on in a program. Let's not turn
the sports pages into a mini /Va
ti<inal Enquirer with needless
gossip and hoopla. We, as the
press, should do our best to re
port the competitions on the
field as best we can, and let the
players lead their own personal
lives. Would we want all our dir
ty laundry distributed among
-thousands of people, ninety-nine
percent of whom we don't even
know?
Let's face it —curiosity is one
Of the strongest human motiva
tions. People want to know
what's going on and why. And it
is our job as the press to dis
seminate to them that informa
tion. But we must draw the line
somewhere. It is the coach's job
to draw that line.
- In addition, a coach may de
sire privacy in order to protect a
special game plan and prevent
something from reaching the
opponent which might thereby
damage the chance for victory.
Coaches need to protect their
players. The relationship be
tween a player and his coach is a
special one. By coming out and
telling all, a coach may affect

the performance of his team or
one of his players. If a coach
publicly discloses why he
benched one of his players, for
example, he takes the chance of
setting the stage for a continu
ing feud; whereas, if he keeps it
under wraps, it is much more
likely to be resolved between
the two of them and dismissed
as a "small incident." What
goes on between a coach and his
players is . . . well, between a
coach and his players.
Coaches do have a duty to the
press — to provide them with
quotes on their thoughts and
feelings on particular per
formances. and to answer any
and all questions as best they
can without jeopardizing the in
tegrity of the men and women
who play for them. Let's keep
Peyton Place on late night TV
and not pollute the sports pages
with it.
