Coaches at Stanford have
many responsibilities, the least
of which is to produce a winning
team. The primary one is to
maintain an atmosphere in
which the athlete does not feel
isolated from the student body,
and the student body feels as
though it has a vested interest in
varsity athletics.
For this reason, team privacy
must be considered a secondary
interest. It is naive to think of
college athletics as anything
other than a business, granted.
But this should not mean sacri
ficing the atmosphere of open
ness that has always existed at
Stanford.
Last week basketball coach
Dick Dißiaso benched a player
and refused to explain why. This
decision turned what was proba
bly a simple disciplinary prob
lem into an issue, something one
does not like to see in Cardinal
athletics.
Dißiaso chose to call the
problem "dirty laundry." One
does not expect to hear that
term used with reference to a
Cardinal team, particularly af
ter the Pacific-10 was reduced

to the Pacific-5 this fall.
Thankfully, Stanford came
through all of that with clean
"laundry." The two situations
are not directly applicable of
course, but when team privacy
becomes redefined as team ex
clusivity, the same problems
can easily arise.
Part of the football practice
field was fenced off and boarded
last year Most universities that
participate in big time college
athletics probably have fenced
off practice fields, but Stanford
has never been a typical big
time participant.
Team privacy is fine, even the
perogative of the coach But the
Cardinals saw their share of
Rose Bowls without a private
field. So why institute a practice
that is more typical of some
place like USC or Oklahoma —
schools that Stanford has never
wanted to be grouped with?
It is not pleasant to walk by
the practice field, stop to take a
look, and find that you can't see.
Most people don't particularly
care what the Cardinals do on
the practice field. Granted it is
probably pretty boring. It's the
principle of the thing, you see.
A trend might be developing
here, which could redefine the
student-athlete relationship
with Stanford in a rather unat
tractive way.
