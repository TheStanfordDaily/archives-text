# Reagan vows to reduce deficit
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Warning of a "run
away" federal deficit of almost $80
billion in the current fiscal year, Pres
ident Ronald Reagan said last night
that the nation faces "economic
calamity" unless drastic cuts are
made immediately in government
spending and taxes.
Reagan, making his first televised
address from the White House,
blamed past government policies for
what he called the "worst economic
mess since the Great Depression."
The president said that the United
States had come to a turning point and
must fight unemployment and infla
tion simultaneously with the econom
ic proposals he will present to Con
gress Feb. 18.
There will be budget cuts in vir
tually every department, Reagan
said, but his program will spare "truly
needy" Americans and eliminate gov
ernment benefits only for those who do
not deserve them.
"We are threatened with an eco
nomic calamity of tremendous pro
portions, and the old business-as-usual
treatment can't save us," Reagan
said.
"Since 1960 our government has
spent $5.1 trillion ; our debt has grown
by $648 billion. Prices have exploded
by 178 percent," he said. "How much
better off are we for it all? We all
know, we are very much worse off.
"When we measure how harshly
these years of inflation, lower prod
uctivity and uncontrolled government
growth have affected our lives, we
know we must act and act now," the
president said.
Reagan appealed for bipartisan
backing for his proposals and said that
he already had found a real spirit of
cooperation among Democrats and
Republicans during his 16 days in of
fice.
He applauded the House of Repre
sentatives for its overwhelming pas
sage yesterday of his first legislative
request: to raise the debt limit by $50
billion to $985 billion. He urged the
Senate to do the same so the govern
ment can pay its bills.
"Before we reach the day when we
can reduce the debt ceiling, we may in
spite of our best efforts see a national
debt ir. excess of a trillion dollars,"
Reagan said. "This Is a figure literally
beyond our comprehension."
While painting a bleak picture of ec
onomic conditions on the day he took
office, Reagan held out hope of revers
ing the trends.
"Make no mistake about it, we can
turn them around." he said.
"Our basic system is sound. We can,
with compassion, continue to meet our
responsibility to those who through no
fault of their own need our help," he
added.
"We cannot continue any longer our
wasteful ways at the expense of the
workers of this land or our children."
the president said.
Reagan said that the federal deficit

for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30
would run almost $80 billion, nearly
double the $55.5 billion estimate made
by former President Jimmy Carter in
his final budget a month ago.
Reagan gave no indication in his 23-
minute speech of how heavy his pro
posed spending reductions would be,
although his top economic advisers
have warned that they will be big
enough to "jolt" the economy — and
face tough opposition in Congress.
At the same time, the president re
affirmed his intention of asking for a
10 percent, across-the-board cut in in
dividual income taxes in each of the
next three years as well as major busi
ness tax reductions.
Here, at a glance, are the highlights
of Reagan's speech on the economy
last night:
Government spending — "We can

not delay in implementing an econom
ic program aimed at both reducing tax
rates to stimulate productivity and re
ducing the growth in government
spending to reduce unemployment and
inflation."
Unemployment and inflation —
"We don't have to choose between in
flation and unemployment — they go
hand in hand."
Economic situation — "We are in
the worst economic mess since the
Great Depression."
Taxes — "I shall ask for a 10 percent
reduction across the board in the per
sonal income tax rates for each of the
next three years."
Economic calamity — "We are
threatened with an economic calami
ty of tremendous proportions and the
old business-as-usual treatment can't
save us."
