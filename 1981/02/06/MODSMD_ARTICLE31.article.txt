As a result, Buchan — Stan
ford's leading scorer in the

AIAW championships with 83
points — will be forced to
redshirt the 1980-81 season. The
ligament damage was caused by
over-extension of the shoulder
and has been painful for some
time. Her rehabilitation is ex
pected to last six to 12 weeks.
Buchan set an AIAW record in
the 400 individual medley , blaz
ing to a 4:16.66 clocking in the
national meet. The Cardinals
held off a powerful Texas squad.

629-623, to triumph in the na
tional meet. Buchan's injury ap
peared a short time later.
The men's volleyball team
will participate in a United
States Volleyball Association
AA division tournament Satur
day, at the Burgess Park gym in
Menlo Park. The top ten
amateur clubs of Northern Cali

fornia wil be participating in the
tournament. Stanford will be
the only university team en
tered.

Head Coach Fred Sturm ex
pects his team to finish any
where from first to fourth. The
Cardinals participated in anoth
er USVBA tournament three
weeks ago and finished fourth.
However, they did beat the first
place team, Pangea, a club

composed of Berkeley alumni.
Stanford has entered the tour
nament series "for the game ex
perience," according to Sturm.
"Also, they're fun," he said. He
has found it increasingly dif
ficult to schedule matches in
Northern California because of
travel problems and a shortage
of schools with varsity pro
grams.
A Stanford team will compete
in the 74th Annual Wanamaker
Millrose Games tonight, in the
two-mile relay race.
Dennis Arriola. Doug Vil
laret, Robert Maiocco, and John
Schaer will run their first relay
of the year together, at Madison
Square Garden in New York.

The Games feature a star
studded field, headed by Re
naldo Nehemiah. Nehemiah
smashed his best indoor time in
the 50-vard high hurdles just
last week, at the Sunkist Invita
tional in Los Angeles. His main
competition will come from the
likes of Olympic stars Harvey
Glance. Houston McTear and
Herschel Walker.

The Northern California Ath
letic Conference Individual
Fencing Championships will be
held tomorrow at Roble Gym
from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sabre and
Women's Foil will be fenced
first, followed by Epee and
Men's foil.
The competition could be a re

play of the dual meet season,
with San Jose and Stanford pro
viding the bulk of the qualifying
competitors. The Cardinals and
Spartans account for 14 each
from a total field of 40. Stan
ford's Gary Johnson is defend
ing Epee champion, but to re
tain his title he will have to stop
San Jose's Peter Schifrin, an
Olympic team member who
red-shirted last year.
