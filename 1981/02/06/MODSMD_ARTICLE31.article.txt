As a result, Buchan — Stan
ford's leading scorer in the

AIAW championships with 83
points — will be forced to
redshirt the 1980-81 season. The
ligament damage was caused by
over-extension of the shoulder
and has been painful for some
time. Her rehabilitation is ex
pected to last six to 12 weeks.
Buchan set an AIAW record in
the 400 individual medley , blaz
ing to a 4:16.66 clocking in the
national meet. The Cardinals
held off a powerful Texas squad.

629-623, to triumph in the na
tional meet. Buchan's injury ap
peared a short time later.
The men's volleyball team
will participate in a United
States Volleyball Association
AA division tournament Satur
day, at the Burgess Park gym in
Menlo Park. The top ten
amateur clubs of Northern Cali

fornia wil be participating in the
tournament. Stanford will be
the only university team en
tered.

Head Coach Fred Sturm ex
pects his team to finish any
where from first to fourth. The
Cardinals participated in anoth
er USVBA tournament three
weeks ago and finished fourth.
However, they did beat the first
place team, Pangea, a club

composed of Berkeley alumni.
Stanford has entered the tour
nament series "for the game ex
perience," according to Sturm.
"Also, they're fun," he said. He
has found it increasingly dif
ficult to schedule matches in
Northern California because of
travel problems and a shortage
of schools with varsity pro
grams.
