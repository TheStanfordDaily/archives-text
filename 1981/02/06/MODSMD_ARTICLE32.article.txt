# Smith cans 34
## Cards nail UOP 
### Bill Beyda 
As the final seconds ticked off
the scoreboard clock at Maples
Pavillion Wednesday night, fans
and scorekeepers looked at
their stat sheets in amazement.
Stanford's Louise Smith had
scored 34 points to lead the
women's basketball team to vic
tory over a stunned UOP Lady
Tiger team, 72-50.Smith missed
only one shot from the field all
night (and that one with only 38
seconds left), giving her a field
goal percentage of .933 (14-15)
and a free throw percentage of
.858 (6-7).
Before the game Tiger coach
Mark French said, "We're a lit
tle worried about Louise Smith.
Her statistics are very im
pressive." His worrying was
justified, as Smith played what
perhaps was the game of her
life.
"I felt more confident to
night," Smith said, and it cer
tainly showed. Her shots went in
one after another, astounding
the Maples Pavillion crowd.
The Cardinals' rejuvenation
seems to have been spurred by
their increased communication
on the court, first seen against
Fresno, who the Cards beat last
weekend. The communication
paid off again against UOP as
the Cards' passes were crisp
and on target all night.
UOP had a large height
adavantage, but the Cards used
their agility and cleverness to
work around it. The Cards had
no trouble avoiding UOP'S press
defense, that caused them a last
minute 80-74 loss against UOP
earlier this season.
After the game, a very happy

Cardinal head coach Dotty
McCrea said,"We handled their
press very well. We knew they'd
use it, we practiced and planned
for it, and it paid off."
Stanford was never behind,
partly due to their outstanding
shooting. The Cards' field goal
percentage was .543 (25-46) and
their free throw percentage was
.800 (20-25). If the Cards can
continue to shoot this well, they
will be a hard team to beat.
The win puts Stanford's Nor
cal record at 3-4 and makes
them 12-11 overall. The Cards
are a much better team than
their NorCal record indicates,
as they have lost several games
they should have won. If the
Cards win their remaining Nor-
Cal games, they are still
mathematically eligible for an
WAIAW regional at-large berth.
