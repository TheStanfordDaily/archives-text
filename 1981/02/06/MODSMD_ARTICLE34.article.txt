# Stymies Hayward
## Grame throws no-hitter 
### Ralph Walker 
Something very special happened Wednesday
afternoon at the Hayward State baseball
diamond. Paul Grame became the first Stanford
pitcher to throw a no-hit, no-run ball game since
1968, when Phil Kellar stymied Arizona State over
a decade ago. Led by Grame and the hitting and
defensive play of centerfielder Mike Toothman,
Stanford rolled to its fourth consecutive victory of
the year by beating Hayward, 8-0.
Grame, assessed by Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess to be "one of the keys to our success this
year," stretched his streak of consecutive score
less innings to 14 with the no-hitter, and picked up
his second straight victory.
"He had real good velocity," said Stanford
catcher Bill Worden, who handled Grame during
his "no-no." "He also went nine innings for the
first time in a year or two and threw only 116
pitches, which demonstrated his control. It's real
encouraging to have something like this happen."
Grame, however, was quick to give credit to his
fielders. "We've got just a super defense —
there's no doubt about that. I'm sure it's the best

in the league," the senior hurler said. "It's really
going to help the pitching staff. All you have to do
is make them hit the ball on the ground and we're
going to make the plays. Pitchers love to see
that," he said, smiling.
Grame's words were not without justification,
as the turning point of the game came when Mike
Toothman made a spectacular diving catch.
Toothman's grab in right-centerfield with Hay
ward runners on second and third base preserved
the Cards' two-run lead in the third inning and ul
timately proved to save Grame's no-hitter.
"I just got a good jump on the ball and happened
to get to it," said Toothman, who also led the
Cards' offensive attack with four hits in four at
bats and a home run. Complementing Toothman
were Mike Dotterer, Steve Buechele and Bob
Hausladen who had two RBI s apiece.
Stanford's next game will be this afternoon
when they play host to Nevada-Reno. The game
will be at Sunken Diamond, and is scheduled to
start at 2:30. Brian Mignano (1-0), who was the
winning pitcher in Sunday's victory over Santa
Clara, is the probable starter for the Cards.
