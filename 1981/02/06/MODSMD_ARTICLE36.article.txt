# Attempt to shoot down Flying Ducks
## Card gymnasts hit Oregon Trail 
### Dean Eyre 
Watch out Oregon. No, it's not
another storm front buffeting
the state, but both of the Stan
ford gymnastics teams are con
verging on our neighbor to the
north in a pair of dual meets be
ginning tonight at the Univer
sity of Oregon.
In the women's half of the
meet, the Ducks are not na
tionally ranked, but by scoring
in the 130 to 138 point range, they
should provide "a very com
petitive experience for the
girls," according to head coach
Jackie Walker. Besides com
petition, Oregon also offers
good crowds which makes the
Cardinals perform better. Top
performers for the host squad
include Dawn Haberland and
Sarah Gustavson.
While the Card women face
an even match-up in Eugene,
Sadao Hamada's men will have
more of an uphill battle when
they take on their fourth-rated
opponents. Ranked second in
the west to UCLA, the Ducks

don't boast a standout all
around performer, but do claim
several of the country's leading
specialists. James Yuhashi's
9.55 score in floor exercise earns
him recognition as the fourth
best competitor in that event,
and two of the ring's performers
are ranked first and fourth as
well.
As a team, Oregon's season
best 271 points puts them almost
20 points ahead of (he Cards.
However, Hamada notes they
probably won't score that high
tonight.
"That score was at a home
meet when Oregon was psyched
up to meet the Japanese all-star
team," he said. "Five points
less is the level where they
should be, about 265 to 270
points. We didn't do too well last
week, but over the past three
weeks we've really improved
our consistency. We should give
them a pretty good challenge."
Saturday night, Walker's
women meet Oregon State for
the second time — the last en

counter being the Aloha Gym
fest in Hawaii, where Stanford
finished behind Cal State Full
erton, the Beavers and Nebras
ka. Currently, Oregon State is
rated sixth in the nation, with a
scoring range of 138 to 144
points.
"If we beat them, I would con
sider it an upset, but it's pos
sible," Walker said. The prime
reason for an improved showing
in the rematch is that, for the
first time, the top two Card all
around performers — Karen
Hall and Merilyn Chapman —
will both be competing. Backing
up this duo will be Anne Smith,
Julie Bledsoe, Jeanette
Lacoste, Caryn Lucido and Jen
nifer Roberts. Freshman Anne
Friend, who underwent ex
tensive knee surgery, will be
lost for the remainder of the
season.
"This is the most healthy
team I've had in a meet so far
this season," Walker explained,
as she knocked on her wooden
office desk. "It's the middle of
the season and this meet will

show where we re ranked. If we
do well, it will show that we
belong at the Nationals."
Saturday night's meet
against Portland State offers q
breather for Hamada's squad
and a chance for "specialists to
work on better seasonal
scores," according to Hamada.
More important than just com
petition, Saturday s meet will in
a small way attempt to revive
the sport in the Portland area
"Portland State is not really a
strong team. They're similar to
UC-Davis or San Jose State,"
Hamada said. "Originally, I
didn't schedule a meet for Sat
urday night, but several schools
competing with Portland
dropped gymnastics. They need
competition, and we can help
promote gymnastics.
The men's lineup for the two
meets will stray from the one
used in the past meets this sea
son. Jim Campanelli and Mike
Lee will go all-around, but Brian
Nelson will rest from injuries
received at last week's meet at
Davis.

work on better seasonal
scores," according to Hamada.
More important than just com
petition, Saturday s meet will in
a small way attempt to revive
the sport in the Portland area
"Portland State is not really a
strong team. They're similar to
UC-Davis or San Jose State,"
Hamada said. "Originally, I
didn't schedule a meet for Sat
urday night, but several schools
competing with Portland
dropped gymnastics. They need
competition, and we can help
promote gymnastics.
The men's lineup for the two
meets will stray from the one

received at last week's meet at
Davis.
Watch out Oregon. No, it's not
another storm front buffeting
the state, but both of the Stan
ford gymnastics teams are con
verging on our neighbor to the
north in a pair of dual meets be
ginning tonight at the Univer
sity of Oregon.
In the women's half of the
meet, the Ducks are not na
tionally ranked, but by scoring
in the 130 to 138 point range, they
should provide "a very com
petitive experience for the
girls," according to head coach
Jackie Walker. Besides com
petition, Oregon also offers
good crowds which makes the
Cardinals perform better. Top
performers for the host squad
include Dawn Haberland and
Sarah Gustavson.
While the Card women face
an even match-up in Eugene,
Sadao Hamada's men will have
more of an uphill battle when
they take on their fourth-rated
opponents. Ranked second in
the west to UCLA, the Ducks

don't boast a standout all
around performer, but do claim
several of the country's leading
specialists. James Yuhashi's
9.55 score in floor exercise earns
him recognition as the fourth
best competitor in that event,
and two of the ring's performers
are ranked first and fourth as
well.
As a team, Oregon's season
best 271 points puts them almost
20 points ahead of (he Cards.
However, Hamada notes they
probably won't score that high
tonight.
"That score was at a home
meet when Oregon was psyched
up to meet the Japanese all-star
team," he said. "Five points
less is the level where they
should be, about 265 to 270
points. We didn't do too well last
week, but over the past three
weeks we've really improved
our consistency. We should give
them a pretty good challenge."
Saturday night, Walker's
women meet Oregon State for
the second time — the last en

counter being the Aloha Gym
fest in Hawaii, where Stanford
finished behind Cal State Full
erton, the Beavers and Nebras
ka. Currently, Oregon State is
rated sixth in the nation, with a
scoring range of 138 to 144
points.
"If we beat them, I would con
sider it an upset, but it's pos
sible," Walker said. The prime
reason for an improved showing
in the rematch is that, for the
first time, the top two Card all
around performers — Karen
Hall and Merilyn Chapman —
will both be competing. Backing
up this duo will be Anne Smith,
Julie Bledsoe, Jeanette
Lacoste, Caryn Lucido and Jen
nifer Roberts. Freshman Anne
Friend, who underwent ex
tensive knee surgery, will be
lost for the remainder of the
season.
"This is the most healthy
team I've had in a meet so far
this season," Walker explained,
as she knocked on her wooden
office desk. "It's the middle of
the season and this meet will

show where we re ranked. If we
do well, it will show that we
belong at the Nationals."
Saturday night's meet
against Portland State offers q
breather for Hamada's squad
and a chance for "specialists to
work on better seasonal
scores," according to Hamada.
