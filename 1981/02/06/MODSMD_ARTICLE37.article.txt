Reading, Pa. (AP) — District
Justice Albert Gaspari has dis
missed all charges against a
Reading physician accused of il
legally prescribing am
phetamine-like drugs to seven
members of the World Cham
pion Philadelphia Phillies
baseball team.
Charges against two other
Reading men accused of illegal
ly obtaining the drugs from
pharmacies and delivering
them to the players or their
wives were also thrown out.
Dr. Patrick A. Mazza, 56,
team physician for the Phillies'
Reading farm club, and Robert
L. Masley. 54, and his son, Rob
ert M. Masley, 24, had all testi
fied in their own defense at the
seven-hour preliminary hearing
Wednesday.
Mazza had testified that he
had prescribed pep pills — the
state claimed more than 2600 —
to pitchers Steve Carlton, Larry
Christenson and Randy Lerch;
first baseman Pete Rose; out
fielder Greg Luzinski; shortstop

Larry Bowa and former catcher
Tim McCarver.
At an earlier hearing last
month, Sheena Bowa, Jean
Luzinski, Christenson, Rose and
McCarver all testified they nev
er requested any prescriptions
from Mazza or received them
from the Masleys.

Lerch testified Wednesday
that he had received approx
imately 75 Preludin tablets, an
amphetamine-like drug, and
had paid $15 for them, although
he said he never asked Mazza
for the drugs.
"What you have here are a
bunch of ballplayers who are

world champions, but who are
also champions of lying," said
attorney Emmanuel Dimitriou,
representing the three defen
dants. "They have tried to sell
this man (Mazza) down the
river to protect their own im
ages and their own pocket
books."
