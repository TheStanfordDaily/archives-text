# Swimmers face USC
## 
### Steve Odell 
Four of the nation's best col
legiate swim teams will be com
peting this Saturday at de-
Guerre Pool when the Cardinal
jrien sand women's swimming
teams take on USC. The meets
.will also feature ten Olympian
swimmers, with the women's
meet beginning at 11 a.m. and
the men scheduled to start at 1
p.m.
The USC men's team, which
brings into the meet the best
NCAA swimming record over
the last twenty years, is cur
rently ranked fifth in the nation.
Stanford men's head coach Skip
Kenney realizes that it will take
a supreme effort to pull off an
upset against the Trojans, but
he fully believes one is possible.
v 'We're going to need our best
times of the year." he said, "but
if we do get our best times, we
Should beat them. It'll be an out
standing meet."
As if the team competition
wasn't enough, there are going
to be some great individual
match-ups. also. The one-and
two finishers in last year's
NCAA men's 200-meter
backstroke will be facing each
other again in what should be a
classic rematch. Jamie Fowler,
from USC, was the collegiate
champ in that distance last
year, and the runner-up in that
race. Stanford's Wade Flem
ons. will be attempting to
avenge the loss.
Another great race should
take place in the 100-meter free
style, between USC's Chris
Cavanaugh and the Cardinals'
Sam Worden. Worden broke the
high school record in the 100

free, only to have his mark bet
tered three weeks later by
Cavanaugh. whose record still
stands.
The women's team, unlike the
men's, is favored in the South
ern Cal meet, and is therefore
viewing it quite differently.
"We'd like to finish up 11-1.
We're looking at this meet in
terms of winning it. picking up
some momentum, and quali
fying some more people for Na
tionals," said head coach
Holger Dietze.
The women will also have
some outstanding individual
competition on Saturday. Stan
ford's Patty Spees will do battle
with the number one ranked
women's breaststroker in the
nation, the Trojans' Anette
Frederickson. And in the
sprints, it'll be Barb Major.
