Saying that the University has "a
responsibility to mitigate the county's
housing problem," Director of Uni
versity Housing Programs Robin
Hamill told local residents and mem
bers of the Open Planning Process
Committee (OPPC) Wednesday night
that faculty, students and staff would
have "first priority" in the proposed
development of Stanford West, the 46-
acre parcel located at Willow Road be
tween Children's Health Center and
Oak Creek Apartments.
Speaking before the public commit
tee established to discuss develop
ment plans. Hamill said, "We con
tribute to the (housing) problem, and
feel an obligation to internal
priorities." She said that "the institu
tion cannot survive" without some
solution to the housing shortage in this
area.
According to a University report
submitted at the meeting. 80,000 work
ers in the Palo Alto planning area
compete lor 24.500 housing units. At
tfie Ontversity, 3,f00 at thv ix.ooo Â»eu
dents live off campus and only 700 fac
ulty and staff units are available to a
work force of 9000 The University pro
poses to build 2000 to 4000 units over
the next several years, according to
the report. Construction of 140 con
dominium units on Peter Coutts Hill,
targeted for sale to senior faculty
members, will begin this spring.
According to Hamill, the University
has been forced to "turn down a
number of faculty recruits" because
affordable housing is unavailable.
Associate Provost Wayne Price said
recruitment of faculty is "extremely
difficult. We encounter people once or
twice a day who are excited about

coming to the University but are not
willing to lower their standard of liv
ing," he said.
Approximately 75 attended the
meeting to discuss plans to construct
housing on University lands and pro
pose alternatives to development of
Stanford West. Several residents of
the area around Stanford West ex
pressed concern about the impact de
velopment of the area would have on
the environment, traffic, transporta
tion and the future of the University.
Lou Goldsmith, a Sharon Heights
resident, said the Santa Cruz Ave. and
Willow Creek Road intersection is "al
ready a bottleneck," and suggested a
"traffic survey of Willow Creek resi
dents."
"The 750 apartments could serve as
a potential source of information re
garding traffic problems," he said. "A
survey of work places might supply
some data on the future impact of the
46 acre development and traffic
needs."
Escondido Village Director Jan
yfarx satct to "foofc at e/ie Escondtdo
experience," and said that she would
participate in a study of the 1300 apart
ments' impact on traffic.
Menlo Park resident Herbert Miller
suggested the University undertake
"something less ambitious" in its at
tempt to ease the housing crunch
"Something smaller than the 46
acres at Stanford West might be better
for experimental purposes," he said.
"The University should save that
large parcel as long as possible. We
cannot foretell the University's needs
for the future with regard to SLAC and
other unseen purposes." He suggested
that the open field across from Saks
Fifth Avenue at the corner of Quarry
Road and Arboretum Road could pro
vide a small site with better road ac
cess.
Janet Owens, president of the Mid-
Peninsula Coalition Housing Fund, ex
pressed the need for "subsidized hous
ing for those of us with low-paying
jobs." She said that the University
"cannot set an absolute" stipulation
that only faculty, staff and students
would be eligible for the proposed
housing.
"It's only fair that these vast Stan
ford lands be used to provide assisted
housing to others," she said.
Hamill responded that the Univer
sity has never stated that the proposed
housing would be reserved exclusively
for Stanford personnel but that Uni
versity members would have "priori
ty." She said if the University ever
succeeded in meeting its own housing
needs, it could consider making hous
ing available to others.
