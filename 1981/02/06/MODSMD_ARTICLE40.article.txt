# Ali faces charges

Los Angeles (AP) — After
airing his side of the story in tel
ephone calls to three sports re
porters, a key figure in a $21 3
million fraud suit filed by Wells
Fargo bank remained silent to
day as bank officials challenged
his statements.
Dozens of reporters staked
out the elegant Hancock Park
home of Muhammad Ali on
Wednesday in hopes of locating
Harold J. Smith, 37, chairman of
Muhammad Ali Professional
Sports Inc. But Smith never ap
peared.
Wells Fargo Bank had issued
a statement terming "pre
posterous and totally im
plausible" Smith's claims to re
porters that up to 35 officials at
20 Wells Fargo branches were
involved in the alleged em
bezzlement and that the amount
missing was actually "two or
three hundred million dollars."
In a civil lawsuit filed Mon
day, the San Francisco-based
bank sought to recover $21.3
million in missing funds from
Smith; L. Ben Lewis, a Wells
Fargo loan officer and MAPS di
rector who also is missing; and
other officials and associates of
MAPS.
"We find preposterous and to
tally implausible Smith's
statement that the taking of
funds amounting to $200 million
or more is involved and that
high officials of the bank are in
volved," said a statement by
Wells Fargo chairman Richard
P. Cooley.
Bank officials also scoffed at
Smith's contention that at
tempts were made on his life.

that his 4-year-old son was brief
ly kidnapped and that he was
forced to flee to Switzerland and
Canada to escape bank-con
nected thugs who wanted to
keep him from talking about the
alleged embezzlement.
Cooley did. however, agree to
some extent with one claim
Smith made in telephone calls
Tuesday to Bud Furillo of LoS
Angeles radio station KABC,
Jim Hill of Los Angeles tele
vision station KNXT and New
York Times boxing writer
Michael Katz. Although none
saw Smith, all three believe he
was the caller.
Smith said the embezzlement
had occurred "over a period of
time, over eight, nine years,"
and Cooley acknowledged that
the fraud "goes back into last
year and maybe even farther.
We just don't know yet."
Bank officials have been re
luctant to describe how the al
leged embezzlement was ac
complished. It had been pre
viously speculated that the em
bezzlement had occurred over
several days or weeks at the
most.
The case is being investigated
by the FBI, but no criminal
charges have been filed and
none of the defendants in the
bank's civil suit are being
sought by authorities.
However, all MAPS assets
have been frozen and the or
ganization will not be promoting
a four-fight card with $8.5 mil
lion in purses scheduled for Feb.
23 at Madison Square Garden.
