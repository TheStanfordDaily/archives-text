cinema's greatest love teams
This is the Western, more influen

quoted as saying he watched it 40
times to analyze its filmmaking
technique before he set out to
make ('tfazcn Kane, and every di

Director Howard Hawks liked
to tell the story of how he got the
brilliant idea of taking one of the
characters from The Front Page
(the stage play and 1930 movie
about newspapermen i and turning
him into a woman The switch, not
as startling now as it was then,
seems to have had an energizing
effect on the movie: it's faster,
and sassier, and funnier than just
about any other comedy Hawks
worked it so the characters
stepped on each other's lines —
one butts in before another's half
finished talking, and the movie
speeds along like it's been
greased. Cary Grant and Rosalind
Russell play the reporters; Ralph
Bellamy is, as always, the movie's
biggest joke.

What we have here is really just
another version of .1 Star is Horn,
except this one is clothed in a 1969
Setting and centered on a charac
ter vaguely based on Janis Joplin
But the movie makes only three
references to '69, and without
those you'd probably just assume
the movie was set in the present.
The music is more aptly described
as frenetic show tunes with bass
and drums than as anything re
sembling Janis Joplin's primal,
gut-busting wailing. The per
formances at times manage to ob
scure some ot the movie's lack of
authenticity, but the much
ballvhooed Bette Midler only ex
acerbates the problem by being
less-than-convincing in the con
cert sequences (can we really be
lieve that she's playing a rack per
former?). When teamed with
either Fredric Forrest or Alan
Bates, Midler comes off much bet

The Incredible Shrinking
Woman, which stars Lily Tomlin
as (surprise!) a woman who
shrinks, goes wrong in more ways
than most moviefc have ways; it is
a small miracle of ineptitude.
A feeling of great things being
missed pervades the movie. Even
the special effects seem tired —
the business of shrinking is treated
more like a chore to be completed
than a possibility for exercising
the imagination. The movie ends
up being a little depressing it

that someone along the line forgot

The Australian director, Fred
Schepisi. has adapted a fine 1972
novel by Thomas Keneally about a
young half-white, half aborigine
whose tragedy is his inability to fit
in either world Schepisi uses a vis
ual shorthand that is the perfect
equivalent of Keneally's dense yet
terse prose, and he is able to con
vey the emotional tone of a scene
just by the grouping of actors. The
film contains a bold, brilliantly
sustained operatic climax that is
certain to disturb many viewers.

This is, by all acceptable stan
dards, a mediocre movie. It was
taken from a slight novella by
Truman Capote, one of his "but
tercup" books; director Blake Ed
wards. never able to let well
enough alone, tried to turn
Capote's sketch into a parable.
What should have been a winsome,
romantic tale became a plodding,
melodramatic morality play. It is
only fitting that George Peppard.
whose only talent is for serious
gazes, plays the male lead (a
struggling young author — real
ly); but Audrey Hepburn, one ol
the simplest of actresses, gets
smothered. Hepburn is wonderful
to watch when menaced from

falters — she cannot convince us
that there is anything malignant

Altered Slates ★

Altered States is the world's

Ken Russell (Women in Lave,

Chavefskv (Network) wrote the
story and screenplay. This tale of a
man who turns into an ape
(honest) and does other colorful
things after he takes a rare drug
reflects the worst aspects of both
of its creators: from Russell it re
ceives pointless visual flam
boyance: from Chayefsky it gains
pointless philosophical dis
cussions ("What is man? When do
we eat?"). Its visuals, however,
are very pretty — the movie prac
tically begs you to stop thinking
long enough to enjoy them — and
the soundtrack ("Megasound") is
loud and creepy. It's amazing what
wonderful things one can do with
no ideas at all.

smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy

Frank Capracorn ending. Lily
Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Dabnev
Coleman salvage as much as they
can, but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance: trying to
play a woman of average in

at the same time, she telegraphs

What we have here is really just
another version of .1 Star is Horn,
except this one is clothed in a 1969
Setting and centered on a charac
ter vaguely based on Janis Joplin
But the movie makes only three
references to '69, and without
those you'd probably just assume
the movie was set in the present.
The music is more aptly described
as frenetic show tunes with bass
and drums than as anything re
sembling Janis Joplin's primal,
gut-busting wailing. The per
formances at times manage to ob
scure some ot the movie's lack of

What we have here is really just
another version of .1 Star is Horn,
except this one is clothed in a 1969
Setting and centered on a charac
ter vaguely based on Janis Joplin
But the movie makes only three
references to '69, and without
those you'd probably just assume
the movie was set in the present.
The music is more aptly described
as frenetic show tunes with bass
and drums than as anything re
sembling Janis Joplin's primal,
gut-busting wailing. The per
formances at times manage to ob
scure some ot the movie's lack of
authenticity, but the much

What we have here is really just
another version of .1 Star is Horn,

Setting and centered on a charac
ter vaguely based on Janis Joplin
But the movie makes only three
references to '69, and without
those you'd probably just assume
the movie was set in the present.
The music is more aptly described
as frenetic show tunes with bass
and drums than as anything re
sembling Janis Joplin's primal,
gut-busting wailing. The per
formances at times manage to ob
scure some ot the movie's lack of

Director John Ford put John

cinema's greatest love teams
This is the Western, more influen
tial than any other Orson Welles is
quoted as saying he watched it 40
times to analyze its filmmaking
technique before he set out to
make ('tfazcn Kane, and every di
rector of action films owes a debt
to Ford's command of the art. This
is probably the first time Wayne
ever looked — and felt — at home
on the screen; you can sense that
there's a special presence here.

Director Howard Hawks liked
to tell the story of how he got the
brilliant idea of taking one of the
characters from The Front Page
(the stage play and 1930 movie
about newspapermen i and turning
him into a woman The switch, not
as startling now as it was then,
seems to have had an energizing
effect on the movie: it's faster,
and sassier, and funnier than just
about any other comedy Hawks
worked it so the characters
stepped on each other's lines —
one butts in before another's half
finished talking, and the movie
speeds along like it's been
greased. Cary Grant and Rosalind
Russell play the reporters; Ralph
Bellamy is, as always, the movie's
biggest joke.

The Hose *
Sunday, Mem Aud
What we have here is really just
another version of .1 Star is Horn,
except this one is clothed in a 1969
Setting and centered on a charac
ter vaguely based on Janis Joplin
But the movie makes only three
references to '69, and without
those you'd probably just assume
the movie was set in the present.
The music is more aptly described
as frenetic show tunes with bass
and drums than as anything re
sembling Janis Joplin's primal,
gut-busting wailing. The per
formances at times manage to ob
scure some ot the movie's lack of
authenticity, but the much
ballvhooed Bette Midler only ex
acerbates the problem by being
less-than-convincing in the con
cert sequences (can we really be
lieve that she's playing a rack per
former?). When teamed with
either Fredric Forrest or Alan
Bates, Midler comes off much bet
ter, but it's too little too late.

this rock-documentary of the

chosen to emphasize the per

mesmerizing eflect — we've never
been so i lose to these people
before. It's possible to question the
legitimacy of celebrities cam
paigning about such an issue
(would the movie have been made
any differently if the benefit had
been in support of nuclear energy
instead of against it?) but it's hard
not to get caught up with their en

Bijou, Palo Alto
The Incredible Shrinking
Woman, which stars Lily Tomlin
as (surprise!) a woman who
shrinks, goes wrong in more ways
than most moviefc have ways; it is
a small miracle of ineptitude.
A feeling of great things being
missed pervades the movie. Even
the special effects seem tired —
the business of shrinking is treated
more like a chore to be completed
than a possibility for exercising
the imagination. The movie ends
up being a little depressing it
laughs so loudly at its own, tiny
punchline that it's hard not to feel
that someone along the line forgot
to tell the joke.

The Australian director, Fred
Schepisi. has adapted a fine 1972
novel by Thomas Keneally about a
young half-white, half aborigine
whose tragedy is his inability to fit
in either world Schepisi uses a vis
ual shorthand that is the perfect
equivalent of Keneally's dense yet
terse prose, and he is able to con
vey the emotional tone of a scene
just by the grouping of actors. The
film contains a bold, brilliantly
sustained operatic climax that is
certain to disturb many viewers.
The performances of Tommy Lew

is a film of Sophoclean power — a
masterpiece.

This is, by all acceptable stan
dards, a mediocre movie. It was
taken from a slight novella by
Truman Capote, one of his "but
tercup" books; director Blake Ed
wards. never able to let well
enough alone, tried to turn
Capote's sketch into a parable.
What should have been a winsome,
romantic tale became a plodding,
melodramatic morality play. It is
only fitting that George Peppard.
whose only talent is for serious
gazes, plays the male lead (a
struggling young author — real
ly); but Audrey Hepburn, one ol
the simplest of actresses, gets
smothered. Hepburn is wonderful
to watch when menaced from
without, but when, as here, the de
mons must come from within, she
falters — she cannot convince us
that there is anything malignant
lurking behind her gamine-like
features.

Altered Slates ★

Altered States is the world's

ly vacuous.
Ken Russell (Women in Lave,
Tommy) directed; Paddy
Chavefskv (Network) wrote the
story and screenplay. This tale of a
man who turns into an ape
(honest) and does other colorful
things after he takes a rare drug
reflects the worst aspects of both
of its creators: from Russell it re
ceives pointless visual flam
boyance: from Chayefsky it gains
pointless philosophical dis
cussions ("What is man? When do
we eat?"). Its visuals, however,
are very pretty — the movie prac
tically begs you to stop thinking
long enough to enjoy them — and
the soundtrack ("Megasound") is
loud and creepy. It's amazing what
wonderful things one can do with
no ideas at all.

One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about the revenge three abused
secretaries take on their
chauvinistic boss are quickly
smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy
with a fake feminist gloss and a
Frank Capracorn ending. Lily
Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Dabnev
Coleman salvage as much as they
can, but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance: trying to
play a woman of average in
telligence and to be light and funny
at the same time, she telegraphs
appallingly and gives us scenes of
classic female incompetence,
which surely cannot be what she
intended.
