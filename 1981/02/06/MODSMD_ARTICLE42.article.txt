Garwood convicted of collaboration
Camp Lejeune, N.C. — A five-man military jury yesterday con
victed Marine Pfc. Robert Garwood of collaborating with the ene
my during the nearly 14 years he spent as a prisoner of war in Viet
nam. It was the first court-martial of a Vietnam-era POW.
The jury found the 34-vear-old Garwood — described by one
former POW as a "White Vietnamese" — innocent on a charge of
maltreating a fellow POW but convicted him on a lesser charge of
assaulting the POW. All the jurors are Vietnam veterans.
The verdict, which found Garwood guilty on all five accusations
in the collaboration charge, came during the jury's second day of
deliberations after they examined copies of testimony given by
some of the government's most damaging witnesses.
Sentencing will be determined by the same jury after further
hearings. The collaboration verdict carries a possible maximum
sentence of life in prison.
Guilty verdicts were returned against Garwood on charges of:
— Serving as an interpreter during political indoctrination
classes in a prison camp.
— Informing to the enemy about complaints, feelings and at
titudes of fellow captives.
— Interrogating POWS upon their entry into the camp about the
former military units, their attitudes and any escape plans.
— Indoctrinating POWS as part of a political course, extolling
the virtues of the National Liberation Front and suggesting that
they "cross over" to the enemy The jury deleted an accusation
from this charge alleging Garwood had ascribed the term
"mercenaries" to the American POWs.
— Serving as a guard, escorting POWs inside and outside the
camp. The jury deleted from this charge the allegation that Gar
wood served as an "armed" guard.
Mount St. Helens may erupt again
Vancouver, Wash. — Volatile Mount St. Helens shot a steam
plume a mile above its 8400-foot crater rim yesterday and scien
tists said they expected an eruption — but one that probably would
not spew ash.
The steam plume shot 5500 feet above the crater, while the
earthquakes which rattled the volcano earlier seemed to have
leveled off, scientists said.
That lull may be a clue to the volcano's next move, said Christ
ina Boyko. a spokeswoman for the University of Washington's
geophysics center in Seattle.
Seismic activity leveled off late yesterday morning to about
two events per hour after coming at a rate of six to eight per hour
earlier, she said.
She said any new eruption probably would be similar to the peri
od between Dec. 27 and Jan. 4, when molten rock squeezed up
through the volcano's crater floor, hardening into a dome larger
than Seattle's Kingdome.
Scientists issued a volcano alert early yesterday, saying a ma
jor eruption was a possibility.
"Seismic data of the last several hours indicate an eruption
within the next 12 hours," geophysics spokesman Dave Peckham
said, reading a department statement shortly after 5 a.m.
At that time, Peckham said the expected eruption could either
be non-explosive, like the one that created the dome, or could re
semble the mountain's last explosive eruption, which began Oct.
16 and shot steam and ash thousands of feet into the sky over three
days.
San Francisco bus driver murdered
San Francisco — Two men are being sought in yesterday's fatal
shooting of a San Francisco bus driver aboard his bus, police say.
Winfred McGee, 38, was shot several times with a revolver
about 2.30 p.m. He was at the end of his No. 15 bus run and eating a

snack, said Ron Gilmore. chief investigator for the San Francisco
Municipal Railway.
Robert Rockwell. Muni spokesman, said McGee had his two
way radio to the communications center in his hand when he was
shot. He said a motive was not immediately known.
The shooting took place on Ocean Avenue near San Francisco
City College. Two men fled from the bus after the shooting, police
said.
Fireman Alan Hunt, whose station house is near the turn
around, said firefighters heard about six shots. Firefighters saw
several dozen people "running amok" after the shots were fired
but did not see the suspects, he said
Meanwhile. San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein said she
was "appalled and shocked" and said the city would offer a $5000
reward. She added that officials would meet today to work out a
plan for undercover police to work on Muni buslines.
Low demand may cut world oil prices
New York — Although U.S. fuel costs have surged since Presi
dent Ronald Reagan scrapped federal controls, industry ob
servers said yesterday evidence is mounting that sluggish petro
leum demand worldwide may force some exporting countries to
cut their prices.
And that, said an American oil company executive who asked
not to be identified, could "help you and meat the pump, maybe,"
because the United States imports nearly 40 percent of its oil.
U.S. refiners have increased wholesale fuel prices about 8 cents
a gallon since Reagan's Jan. 28 announcement that he was ending
oil-price controls eight months ahead of schedule.
World crude oil prices have climbed more than 150 percent
since the beginning of 1979. pushing petroleum demand down 7.5
percent in major consuming countries and leading the Interna
tional Energy Agency to predict a further 1 to 2 percent drop in
1981.
Pentagon wants an extra $23 billion
Washington — The Pentagon's new civilian leadership has pre
pared a tentative proposal for a huge jump of about $23.6 billion
over the Carter administration's defense budget recommenda
tion for next year.
This would bring the fiscal 1982 defense budget to about $220
billion to speed a U.S. military buildup that Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger contends is essential "to re-arm America" in
the face of steady Soviet armed growth.
At the same time, administration sources said yesterday,
Weinberger believes this year's defense budget should be in
creased by about $6.4 billion over the Carter administration's re
vised total of $171.2 billion in budget authority.
The sources said discussion is still underway as to the specific
mix of programs that would benefit from the dramatic increases.
Gen. David Jones, chairman of the joint chiefs, testified in Con
gress Wednesday that the military services were seeking about $8
billion more for this fiscal year, which ends next Sept. 29, and
budget additions — "probably in the high 20s to 30s" — of billions
of dollars in the next fiscal year.
Defense officials said emphatically that though Weinberger
and the Reagan administration generally are strongly in favor of
a significant boost in defense spending, the armed services are
not being given any blank checks to pick and choose what specific
weapons and other programs should be increased and by how
much.
Also, the final figures will have to be negotiated with the White
House's Office of Management and Budget and accepted by Presi
dent Reagan before he sends them to Congress later this month or
in early March.
Some sources said the Pentagon's proposed total for fiscal 1982
may end up a couple of billion dollars higher than the tentative
$220 billion.

General strike threatened in Poland
Warsaw — Independent labor leader Lech Walesa called yes
terday for a general sit-in strike throughout Poland if the govern
ment cracks down on strikers in the Bielsko-Biala region and dis
rupts communications among union chapters.
In Jelenia Gora, union officials said the strike committee pro
claimed a general warning strike in that city starting Monday if
the government fails to meet previous demands and ensure full
pay for strikers. The strikers say they were promised full pay in
last August's strike settlement.
The threat of new strikes came after talks between strike lead
ers and government commissions broke down in both cities.
The Monday strike deadline coincides with the start of a session
of the Communist Party's Central Committee, widely expected to
deal with the labor conflict that has badly hurt Poland's shaky
economy. The persistent labor trouble and reports of Soviet
troops near Poland's border have raised fears in the West that the
Soviet Union would intervene.
Poll shows public faith in Reagan
New York — Americans think Ronald Reagan is the kind of per
son who can get things done, but they're split over whether the
new president will be able to put a rein on inflation or balance the
federal budget, an Associated Press-NBC News poll says.
The poll indicates the public does trust Reagan and thinks he
will be able to strengthen the nation's military and restore re
spect for America around the world.
The AP-NBC News poll, taken Jan. 21-23, is based on telephone
interviews with 2407 adults across the country.
Fifty-eight percent said they have an overall favorable opinion
of Reagan, with 18 percent having an unfavorable view. Twenty
four percent were not sure.
And 61 percent expressed a lot of trust in Reagan. Thirty-one
percent expressed little or no trust in him. That trust rating is
almost identical to the one enjoyed by Ex-President Jimmy
Carter in the first days of his administration in 1977.
Dow Jones average up 5 points
New York The stock market rallied yesterday as President
Ronald Reagan prepared to address the nation on the economy.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended the day up 4.78 at
946.76. Big Board volume totaled 45.32 million shares.
Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrial stocks picked up 1.24
to 146.92. and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 1.04 to 129.63.
The NYSE's composite index of all of its listed common stocks
rose 0.67 to 74.31.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy through tomorrow. A slight chance of showers to
day. Lows in the 40s. Highs in the 50s. Variable winds to 15 mph
afternoons. Chance of measurable rainfall 20 percent today.

jor eruption was a possibility.
"Seismic data of the last several hours indicate an eruption
within the next 12 hours," geophysics spokesman Dave Peckham
said, reading a department statement shortly after 5 a.m.
At that time, Peckham said the expected eruption could either
be non-explosive, like the one that created the dome, or could re
semble the mountain's last explosive eruption, which began Oct.
16 and shot steam and ash thousands of feet into the sky over three
days.
San Francisco bus driver murdered
San Francisco — Two men are being sought in yesterday's fatal
shooting of a San Francisco bus driver aboard his bus, police say.
Winfred McGee, 38, was shot several times with a revolver
about 2.30 p.m. He was at the end of his No. 15 bus run and eating a

snack, said Ron Gilmore. chief investigator for the San Francisco
Municipal Railway.
Robert Rockwell. Muni spokesman, said McGee had his two
way radio to the communications center in his hand when he was
shot. He said a motive was not immediately known.
The shooting took place on Ocean Avenue near San Francisco
City College. Two men fled from the bus after the shooting, police
said.
Fireman Alan Hunt, whose station house is near the turn
around, said firefighters heard about six shots. Firefighters saw
several dozen people "running amok" after the shots were fired
but did not see the suspects, he said
Meanwhile. San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein said she
was "appalled and shocked" and said the city would offer a $5000
reward. She added that officials would meet today to work out a
plan for undercover police to work on Muni buslines.
Low demand may cut world oil prices
New York — Although U.S. fuel costs have surged since Presi
dent Ronald Reagan scrapped federal controls, industry ob
servers said yesterday evidence is mounting that sluggish petro
leum demand worldwide may force some exporting countries to
cut their prices.
And that, said an American oil company executive who asked
not to be identified, could "help you and meat the pump, maybe,"
because the United States imports nearly 40 percent of its oil.
U.S. refiners have increased wholesale fuel prices about 8 cents
a gallon since Reagan's Jan. 28 announcement that he was ending
oil-price controls eight months ahead of schedule.
World crude oil prices have climbed more than 150 percent
since the beginning of 1979. pushing petroleum demand down 7.5
percent in major consuming countries and leading the Interna
tional Energy Agency to predict a further 1 to 2 percent drop in
1981.
Pentagon wants an extra $23 billion
Washington — The Pentagon's new civilian leadership has pre
pared a tentative proposal for a huge jump of about $23.6 billion
over the Carter administration's defense budget recommenda
tion for next year.
This would bring the fiscal 1982 defense budget to about $220
billion to speed a U.S. military buildup that Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger contends is essential "to re-arm America" in
the face of steady Soviet armed growth.
At the same time, administration sources said yesterday,
Weinberger believes this year's defense budget should be in
creased by about $6.4 billion over the Carter administration's re
vised total of $171.2 billion in budget authority.
The sources said discussion is still underway as to the specific
mix of programs that would benefit from the dramatic increases.
Gen. David Jones, chairman of the joint chiefs, testified in Con
gress Wednesday that the military services were seeking about $8
billion more for this fiscal year, which ends next Sept. 29, and
budget additions — "probably in the high 20s to 30s" — of billions
of dollars in the next fiscal year.
Defense officials said emphatically that though Weinberger
and the Reagan administration generally are strongly in favor of
a significant boost in defense spending, the armed services are
not being given any blank checks to pick and choose what specific
weapons and other programs should be increased and by how
much.
Also, the final figures will have to be negotiated with the White
House's Office of Management and Budget and accepted by Presi
dent Reagan before he sends them to Congress later this month or
in early March.
Some sources said the Pentagon's proposed total for fiscal 1982
may end up a couple of billion dollars higher than the tentative
$220 billion.

General strike threatened in Poland
Warsaw — Independent labor leader Lech Walesa called yes
terday for a general sit-in strike throughout Poland if the govern
ment cracks down on strikers in the Bielsko-Biala region and dis
rupts communications among union chapters.
In Jelenia Gora, union officials said the strike committee pro
claimed a general warning strike in that city starting Monday if
the government fails to meet previous demands and ensure full
pay for strikers. The strikers say they were promised full pay in
last August's strike settlement.
The threat of new strikes came after talks between strike lead
ers and government commissions broke down in both cities.
The Monday strike deadline coincides with the start of a session
of the Communist Party's Central Committee, widely expected to
deal with the labor conflict that has badly hurt Poland's shaky
economy. The persistent labor trouble and reports of Soviet
troops near Poland's border have raised fears in the West that the
Soviet Union would intervene.
Poll shows public faith in Reagan
New York — Americans think Ronald Reagan is the kind of per
son who can get things done, but they're split over whether the
new president will be able to put a rein on inflation or balance the
federal budget, an Associated Press-NBC News poll says.
The poll indicates the public does trust Reagan and thinks he
will be able to strengthen the nation's military and restore re
spect for America around the world.
The AP-NBC News poll, taken Jan. 21-23, is based on telephone
interviews with 2407 adults across the country.
Fifty-eight percent said they have an overall favorable opinion
of Reagan, with 18 percent having an unfavorable view. Twenty
four percent were not sure.
And 61 percent expressed a lot of trust in Reagan. Thirty-one
percent expressed little or no trust in him. That trust rating is
almost identical to the one enjoyed by Ex-President Jimmy
Carter in the first days of his administration in 1977.

Garwood convicted of collaboration
Camp Lejeune, N.C. — A five-man military jury yesterday con
victed Marine Pfc. Robert Garwood of collaborating with the ene
my during the nearly 14 years he spent as a prisoner of war in Viet
nam. It was the first court-martial of a Vietnam-era POW.
The jury found the 34-vear-old Garwood — described by one
former POW as a "White Vietnamese" — innocent on a charge of
maltreating a fellow POW but convicted him on a lesser charge of
assaulting the POW. All the jurors are Vietnam veterans.
The verdict, which found Garwood guilty on all five accusations
in the collaboration charge, came during the jury's second day of
deliberations after they examined copies of testimony given by
some of the government's most damaging witnesses.
Sentencing will be determined by the same jury after further
hearings. The collaboration verdict carries a possible maximum
sentence of life in prison.
Guilty verdicts were returned against Garwood on charges of:
— Serving as an interpreter during political indoctrination
classes in a prison camp.
— Informing to the enemy about complaints, feelings and at
titudes of fellow captives.
— Interrogating POWS upon their entry into the camp about the
former military units, their attitudes and any escape plans.
— Indoctrinating POWS as part of a political course, extolling
the virtues of the National Liberation Front and suggesting that
they "cross over" to the enemy The jury deleted an accusation
from this charge alleging Garwood had ascribed the term
"mercenaries" to the American POWs.
— Serving as a guard, escorting POWs inside and outside the
camp. The jury deleted from this charge the allegation that Gar
wood served as an "armed" guard.
Mount St. Helens may erupt again
Vancouver, Wash. — Volatile Mount St. Helens shot a steam
plume a mile above its 8400-foot crater rim yesterday and scien
tists said they expected an eruption — but one that probably would
not spew ash.
The steam plume shot 5500 feet above the crater, while the
earthquakes which rattled the volcano earlier seemed to have
leveled off, scientists said.
That lull may be a clue to the volcano's next move, said Christ
ina Boyko. a spokeswoman for the University of Washington's
geophysics center in Seattle.
Seismic activity leveled off late yesterday morning to about
two events per hour after coming at a rate of six to eight per hour
earlier, she said.
She said any new eruption probably would be similar to the peri
od between Dec. 27 and Jan. 4, when molten rock squeezed up
through the volcano's crater floor, hardening into a dome larger
than Seattle's Kingdome.
Scientists issued a volcano alert early yesterday, saying a ma
jor eruption was a possibility.
"Seismic data of the last several hours indicate an eruption
within the next 12 hours," geophysics spokesman Dave Peckham
said, reading a department statement shortly after 5 a.m.

over the Carter administration's defense budget recommenda
tion for next year.
This would bring the fiscal 1982 defense budget to about $220
billion to speed a U.S. military buildup that Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger contends is essential "to re-arm America" in
the face of steady Soviet armed growth.
At the same time, administration sources said yesterday,
Weinberger believes this year's defense budget should be in
creased by about $6.4 billion over the Carter administration's re
vised total of $171.2 billion in budget authority.
The sources said discussion is still underway as to the specific
mix of programs that would benefit from the dramatic increases.
Gen. David Jones, chairman of the joint chiefs, testified in Con
gress Wednesday that the military services were seeking about $8
billion more for this fiscal year, which ends next Sept. 29, and
budget additions — "probably in the high 20s to 30s" — of billions
of dollars in the next fiscal year.
Defense officials said emphatically that though Weinberger
and the Reagan administration generally are strongly in favor of
a significant boost in defense spending, the armed services are
not being given any blank checks to pick and choose what specific
weapons and other programs should be increased and by how
much.
Also, the final figures will have to be negotiated with the White
House's Office of Management and Budget and accepted by Presi
dent Reagan before he sends them to Congress later this month or
in early March.
Some sources said the Pentagon's proposed total for fiscal 1982
may end up a couple of billion dollars higher than the tentative
$220 billion.

General strike threatened in Poland
Warsaw — Independent labor leader Lech Walesa called yes
terday for a general sit-in strike throughout Poland if the govern
ment cracks down on strikers in the Bielsko-Biala region and dis
rupts communications among union chapters.
In Jelenia Gora, union officials said the strike committee pro
claimed a general warning strike in that city starting Monday if
the government fails to meet previous demands and ensure full
pay for strikers. The strikers say they were promised full pay in
last August's strike settlement.
The threat of new strikes came after talks between strike lead
ers and government commissions broke down in both cities.
The Monday strike deadline coincides with the start of a session
of the Communist Party's Central Committee, widely expected to
deal with the labor conflict that has badly hurt Poland's shaky
economy. The persistent labor trouble and reports of Soviet
troops near Poland's border have raised fears in the West that the
Soviet Union would intervene.
Poll shows public faith in Reagan
New York — Americans think Ronald Reagan is the kind of per
son who can get things done, but they're split over whether the
new president will be able to put a rein on inflation or balance the
federal budget, an Associated Press-NBC News poll says.
The poll indicates the public does trust Reagan and thinks he
will be able to strengthen the nation's military and restore re
spect for America around the world.
The AP-NBC News poll, taken Jan. 21-23, is based on telephone
interviews with 2407 adults across the country.
Fifty-eight percent said they have an overall favorable opinion
of Reagan, with 18 percent having an unfavorable view. Twenty
four percent were not sure.
And 61 percent expressed a lot of trust in Reagan. Thirty-one
percent expressed little or no trust in him. That trust rating is
almost identical to the one enjoyed by Ex-President Jimmy
Carter in the first days of his administration in 1977.
Dow Jones average up 5 points
New York The stock market rallied yesterday as President
Ronald Reagan prepared to address the nation on the economy.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended the day up 4.78 at

Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrial stocks picked up 1.24
to 146.92. and S&P's 500-stock composite index rose 1.04 to 129.63.
The NYSE's composite index of all of its listed common stocks
rose 0.67 to 74.31.

Garwood convicted of collaboration
Camp Lejeune, N.C. — A five-man military jury yesterday con
victed Marine Pfc. Robert Garwood of collaborating with the ene
my during the nearly 14 years he spent as a prisoner of war in Viet
nam. It was the first court-martial of a Vietnam-era POW.
The jury found the 34-vear-old Garwood — described by one
former POW as a "White Vietnamese" — innocent on a charge of
maltreating a fellow POW but convicted him on a lesser charge of
assaulting the POW. All the jurors are Vietnam veterans.
The verdict, which found Garwood guilty on all five accusations
in the collaboration charge, came during the jury's second day of
deliberations after they examined copies of testimony given by
some of the government's most damaging witnesses.
Sentencing will be determined by the same jury after further
hearings. The collaboration verdict carries a possible maximum
sentence of life in prison.
Guilty verdicts were returned against Garwood on charges of:
— Serving as an interpreter during political indoctrination
classes in a prison camp.
— Informing to the enemy about complaints, feelings and at
titudes of fellow captives.
— Interrogating POWS upon their entry into the camp about the
former military units, their attitudes and any escape plans.
— Indoctrinating POWS as part of a political course, extolling
the virtues of the National Liberation Front and suggesting that
they "cross over" to the enemy The jury deleted an accusation
from this charge alleging Garwood had ascribed the term
"mercenaries" to the American POWs.
— Serving as a guard, escorting POWs inside and outside the
camp. The jury deleted from this charge the allegation that Gar
wood served as an "armed" guard.
Mount St. Helens may erupt again
Vancouver, Wash. — Volatile Mount St. Helens shot a steam
plume a mile above its 8400-foot crater rim yesterday and scien
tists said they expected an eruption — but one that probably would
not spew ash.
The steam plume shot 5500 feet above the crater, while the
earthquakes which rattled the volcano earlier seemed to have
leveled off, scientists said.
That lull may be a clue to the volcano's next move, said Christ
ina Boyko. a spokeswoman for the University of Washington's
geophysics center in Seattle.
Seismic activity leveled off late yesterday morning to about
two events per hour after coming at a rate of six to eight per hour
earlier, she said.
She said any new eruption probably would be similar to the peri
od between Dec. 27 and Jan. 4, when molten rock squeezed up
through the volcano's crater floor, hardening into a dome larger
than Seattle's Kingdome.
Scientists issued a volcano alert early yesterday, saying a ma
jor eruption was a possibility.
"Seismic data of the last several hours indicate an eruption
within the next 12 hours," geophysics spokesman Dave Peckham
said, reading a department statement shortly after 5 a.m.
At that time, Peckham said the expected eruption could either
be non-explosive, like the one that created the dome, or could re
semble the mountain's last explosive eruption, which began Oct.
16 and shot steam and ash thousands of feet into the sky over three
days.
San Francisco bus driver murdered
San Francisco — Two men are being sought in yesterday's fatal
shooting of a San Francisco bus driver aboard his bus, police say.
Winfred McGee, 38, was shot several times with a revolver
about 2.30 p.m. He was at the end of his No. 15 bus run and eating a

snack, said Ron Gilmore. chief investigator for the San Francisco
Municipal Railway.
Robert Rockwell. Muni spokesman, said McGee had his two
way radio to the communications center in his hand when he was
shot. He said a motive was not immediately known.
The shooting took place on Ocean Avenue near San Francisco
City College. Two men fled from the bus after the shooting, police
said.
Fireman Alan Hunt, whose station house is near the turn
around, said firefighters heard about six shots. Firefighters saw
several dozen people "running amok" after the shots were fired
but did not see the suspects, he said
Meanwhile. San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein said she
was "appalled and shocked" and said the city would offer a $5000
reward. She added that officials would meet today to work out a
plan for undercover police to work on Muni buslines.
Low demand may cut world oil prices
New York — Although U.S. fuel costs have surged since Presi
dent Ronald Reagan scrapped federal controls, industry ob
servers said yesterday evidence is mounting that sluggish petro
leum demand worldwide may force some exporting countries to
cut their prices.
And that, said an American oil company executive who asked
not to be identified, could "help you and meat the pump, maybe,"
because the United States imports nearly 40 percent of its oil.
U.S. refiners have increased wholesale fuel prices about 8 cents
a gallon since Reagan's Jan. 28 announcement that he was ending
oil-price controls eight months ahead of schedule.
World crude oil prices have climbed more than 150 percent
since the beginning of 1979. pushing petroleum demand down 7.5
percent in major consuming countries and leading the Interna
tional Energy Agency to predict a further 1 to 2 percent drop in
1981.
