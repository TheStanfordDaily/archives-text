## Miners' lives change little despite rising gold profits 
### Washington Post 
Johannesburg — "We have
come here to follow the history
of our fathers because there is
employment here."
Reuben Kuna was explaining
why for the last 34 years he has
left his family in Mozambique
for 16 months at a time and
come to work as one of this
country's 500,000 black gold
miners. He is part of a work
force of major importance to
South Africa, which supplies 72
percent of the noncommunist
world's gold.
Kuna and his fellow black
miners make up two-thirds of
South Africa's mining labor
force. That force hauled 67 mil
lion tons of ore from the coun
try's 44 gold mines through last
September. Smelted down to 506
tons of gold, it was sold at re
cord prices, bringing the gov
ernment in Pretoria close to $4
billion in eight months.
In the last few years South
Africa's mining industry has
found itself confronted with a
better educated, more demand
ing work force at the same time
that modernization and mecha
nization have underlined the
need for a more skilled, stable
and loyal staff — something not
produced by the high turnover
typical of the migrant system.
In addition, the political
thrust of the country's in
dustrial relations now endorsed
by both the government and
private enterprise aims at
creating a prosperous and un
revolutionary work force, which
in effect mandates a change in
the old ways of dealing with

black labor.
It is considered especially im
portant for South Africa to im
plement these changes if it is to
maintain its role as a reliable
producer of strategic materials
for export to the West.
The higher gold price since
1972, according to Harry Op
penheimer. chairman of the
large Anglo-American mining
conglomerate, also had made it
"possible and practical to do
things that could not have been
contemplated before."
Forces promoting change in a
90-year-old industry were given
added impetus by events in the
past decade. From 1973 to 1975
there was serious unrest and vi
olence in the mines during
which 132 men were killed and
at least 500 injured, some by po
lice, others by fighting among
miners.
In 1974 the Malawian govern
ment temporarily stopped all
recruitment there for mine la
bor after a plane carrying
Malawian miners home
crashed, killing all aboard. In
the same year, the approach of
black rule in Mozambique led to
a decline in the number of
miners from that country.
Realizing the vulnerability of
importing labor from seven
nearby countries, the mining in
dustry sought to attract more
South African blacks by making
mining more appealing. Today.
South African blacks account
for 54 percent of the half mil
lion-strong black mining force.
Eight years ago, they were only

25 percent.
In the 19705, black gold
miners' wages rose by more
than 800 pergent and the black
white wage ratio narrowed
from 21 to 1 in 1970 to 7 to 1 in
1980.
Compound construction
Family housing for the top
echelon of black workers is also
being provided in the belief that
'" it would be a good thing to have
more blacks living on the mine
— they would be more contented
and probably stay with us forev
er." according to Henry Slater,
manager of Randfontein gold
mines, where an attractive
compound of 187 houses is under
construction.
Industrial relations depart
ments were set up to improve
race relations and halt abuse of.
and assaults on. blacks by white
supervisors. "Liaison commit
tees" sought to improve com
munication with workers.
Under pressure from the gov
ernment and companies, six of
the eight all-white unions con
nected with the mining industry
have reluctantly taken tentative
steps toward accepting black
members or creating a "par
allel" black branch.
Holdout
The most crucial holdout is
the predominantly Afrikaner
Mine Workers' Union led by Ar
rie Paulus, who publicly refers
to blacks as "baboons" and who
accuses Labor Minister Fanie
Botha of having "sold out"
white interests.

Paulus' union refuses to allow
blacks to get the crucial "blast
ing certificate" that is now
blocking black advancement un
derground in the mines and is
the last statutory job reserva
tion of consequence on the
books. This means that white
blasters are getting at min
imum $900 a month while a
black team leader, who often
does the work of the blaster, can
get only about $650.
Black miners also complain
that "as soon as you have got
blacks who know how to do
things, instead of promoting
him, they downgrade the job
and pay them less." They also
sense the resentment among
white miners.
"Now we have personnel and
industrial relations depart
ments. The white men hate
these departments, they don't
like it that a black can lay
charges" if one is assaulted,
said a miner from Transkei.
Toothless
Other miners say the liaison
committees lack teeth.
"The management only
wants to discuss things they
want to discuss," said one
miner who recently resigned
from a committee. But he con
ceded that there is no great
pressure for unions in a migrant
work force that is only 40
percent literate.
The improvements fail to
change the basic condition —
the migrant life — that is the
greatest concern of the miners.
"Compound life is unbearable
because we don't normally mix
with the other sex," said Tota, a

miner from Lesotho. The worst
thing for him, he said, is
"staying away from my family.
My wife is very sorry. She had
illegitimate children while I
was gone. She is in need of en
joying herself."
"Many of our men take up
sodomy and drinking, they are
the two big problems," he
added.

to Hoechst, in Austria's Vorarlberg province. Among them were

to Hoechst, in Austria's Vorarlberg province. Among them were

hundreds of "witches" from neighboring West Germany and
Switzerland.
Johannesburg — "We have
come here to follow the history
of our fathers because there is
employment here."
Reuben Kuna was explaining
why for the last 34 years he has
left his family in Mozambique
for 16 months at a time and
come to work as one of this
country's 500,000 black gold
miners. He is part of a work
force of major importance to
South Africa, which supplies 72
percent of the noncommunist
world's gold.
Kuna and his fellow black
miners make up two-thirds of
South Africa's mining labor
force. That force hauled 67 mil
lion tons of ore from the coun
try's 44 gold mines through last
September. Smelted down to 506
tons of gold, it was sold at re
cord prices, bringing the gov
ernment in Pretoria close to $4
billion in eight months.
In the last few years South
Africa's mining industry has
found itself confronted with a
better educated, more demand
ing work force at the same time
that modernization and mecha
nization have underlined the
need for a more skilled, stable
and loyal staff — something not
produced by the high turnover
typical of the migrant system.
In addition, the political
thrust of the country's in
dustrial relations now endorsed
by both the government and
private enterprise aims at
creating a prosperous and un
revolutionary work force, which
in effect mandates a change in
the old ways of dealing with

black labor.
It is considered especially im
portant for South Africa to im
plement these changes if it is to
maintain its role as a reliable
producer of strategic materials
for export to the West.
The higher gold price since
1972, according to Harry Op
penheimer. chairman of the
large Anglo-American mining
conglomerate, also had made it
"possible and practical to do
things that could not have been
contemplated before."
Forces promoting change in a
90-year-old industry were given
added impetus by events in the
past decade. From 1973 to 1975
there was serious unrest and vi
olence in the mines during
which 132 men were killed and
at least 500 injured, some by po
lice, others by fighting among
miners.
In 1974 the Malawian govern
ment temporarily stopped all
recruitment there for mine la
bor after a plane carrying
Malawian miners home
crashed, killing all aboard. In
the same year, the approach of
black rule in Mozambique led to
a decline in the number of
miners from that country.
Realizing the vulnerability of
importing labor from seven
nearby countries, the mining in
dustry sought to attract more
South African blacks by making
mining more appealing. Today.
South African blacks account
for 54 percent of the half mil
lion-strong black mining force.
Eight years ago, they were only

25 percent.
In the 19705, black gold
miners' wages rose by more
than 800 pergent and the black
white wage ratio narrowed
from 21 to 1 in 1970 to 7 to 1 in
1980.
Compound construction
Family housing for the top
echelon of black workers is also
being provided in the belief that
'" it would be a good thing to have
more blacks living on the mine
— they would be more contented
and probably stay with us forev
er." according to Henry Slater,
manager of Randfontein gold
mines, where an attractive
compound of 187 houses is under
construction.
Industrial relations depart
ments were set up to improve
race relations and halt abuse of.
and assaults on. blacks by white
supervisors. "Liaison commit
tees" sought to improve com
munication with workers.
Under pressure from the gov
ernment and companies, six of
the eight all-white unions con
nected with the mining industry
have reluctantly taken tentative
steps toward accepting black
members or creating a "par
allel" black branch.
Holdout
The most crucial holdout is
the predominantly Afrikaner
Mine Workers' Union led by Ar
rie Paulus, who publicly refers
to blacks as "baboons" and who
accuses Labor Minister Fanie
Botha of having "sold out"
white interests.

Paulus' union refuses to allow
blacks to get the crucial "blast
ing certificate" that is now
blocking black advancement un
derground in the mines and is
the last statutory job reserva
tion of consequence on the
books. This means that white
blasters are getting at min
imum $900 a month while a
black team leader, who often
does the work of the blaster, can
get only about $650.
Black miners also complain
that "as soon as you have got
blacks who know how to do
things, instead of promoting
him, they downgrade the job
and pay them less." They also
sense the resentment among
white miners.
"Now we have personnel and
industrial relations depart
ments. The white men hate
these departments, they don't
like it that a black can lay
charges" if one is assaulted,
said a miner from Transkei.
Toothless
Other miners say the liaison
committees lack teeth.
"The management only
wants to discuss things they
want to discuss," said one
miner who recently resigned
from a committee. But he con
ceded that there is no great
pressure for unions in a migrant
work force that is only 40
percent literate.
The improvements fail to
change the basic condition —
the migrant life — that is the
greatest concern of the miners.
"Compound life is unbearable
because we don't normally mix
with the other sex," said Tota, a

miner from Lesotho. The worst
thing for him, he said, is
"staying away from my family.
My wife is very sorry. She had
illegitimate children while I
was gone. She is in need of en
joying herself."
"Many of our men take up
sodomy and drinking, they are
the two big problems," he
added.
