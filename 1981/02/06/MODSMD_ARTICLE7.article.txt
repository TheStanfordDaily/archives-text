# Trudeau marks victory in constitutional struggle
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Toronto — The highest court
in the province of Manitoba
bolstered the controversial con
stitutional program of Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau by rul
ing last week that he and Par
liament have the right to act on
it without the approval of the
provinces.
It was a bitter and surprising
blow to six provincial premiers
who had filed lawsuits contend
ing that it would be illegal for
Trudeau to act without their ap
proval. The premiers had ex
pected to receive their most
sympathetic hearing in the pro
vincial courts.
But in a 3-2 decision, the Court
of Appeals of Manitoba, sitting
in Winnipeg, ruled that the fed
eral government and Par
liament could ask the British
Parliament to expand the Cana
dian constitution and transfer it
to Canada even without the ap
proval of the provinces. At pres
ent, the Canadian constitution is
actually a law of the British
Parliament known as the Brit
ish North America Act.
Chief Justice Samuel Freed
man, on behalf of the majority,

wrote that there was no legal
convention that required the
support of the provinces for con
stitutional amendments that af
fect them. To back up his ruling,
Freedman cited a decision of
the Supreme Court of Canada in
1979.
Supreme Court appeal
The legal battling, however,
is far from over. The premiers
also have filed suits in the
highest courts of the provinces
of Quebec and Newfoundland
and intend to appeal the Manito
ba decision to the Supreme
Court of Canada in Ottawa.
Some provincial officials
tried to find some solace in the
defeat.
"Sometimes the hard legal
decisions," said Bill Marshall,
deputy premier of Newfound
land, "do not follow always
what it is morally correct, what
is politically correct, and what
is in the good of the entire social
order."
For the moment, however,
the Manitoba decision undercut
the six premiers along with Joe
Clark, leader of the opposition
in Parliament and a British Par
liamentary committee in their
insistence that it was illegal for
the federal government to act
unilaterally on the constitution.
'Patriation'
The issue centers on what Ca
nadians call "patriation" of the
constitution. Since it is an act of
the British Parliament, the con
stitution can only be amended
by the British Parliament.
Trudeau's proposals would
change this remnant of colonial
ism by legally transferring the
act from the British Parliament
to the Canadian Parliament.

This would ensure that, in the
future, only Canada would have
the right to amend its constitu
tion.
In principle, all Canadian pol
iticians agree on the need for
this, but the issue has been com
plicated by Trudeau's in
sistence that the British Par
liament expand the constitution
with a bill of rights before patri
ating it. Since the bill of rights
would limit the powers of the
provinces, the six premiers con
tend that it cannot be enacted
without their consent.
In Ottawa, members of
Trudeau's Liberal Party
seemed jubilant over the Mani
toba court decision while mem
bers of Clark's Progressive Con
servative Party tended to down
play its importance.
The lawsuit had been filed in
Manitoba by the governments of
the provinces of Manitoba, Que
bec, Newfoundland, Alberta,
British Columbia, and Prince
Edward Island — six of Cana
da's 10 provinces. The case
itself, like the similar cases in
Newfoundland and Quebec, was
cited both by the Progressive
Conservative opposition in the
Canadian Parliament and by the
committee on foreign and com
monwealth affairs of the British
Parliament as evidence that
Trudeau's methods were ques
tionable from a legal and con
stitutional point of view. For
this reason, both groups urged
rejection of the Trudeau pro
posals.
The Manitoba decision weak
ened this argument con
siderably since, in the view of
many constitutional analysts, it
is unlikely to be overturned by
the Supreme Court of Canada.

Toronto — The highest court
in the province of Manitoba
bolstered the controversial con
stitutional program of Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau by rul
ing last week that he and Par
liament have the right to act on
it without the approval of the
provinces.
It was a bitter and surprising
blow to six provincial premiers
who had filed lawsuits contend
ing that it would be illegal for
Trudeau to act without their ap
proval. The premiers had ex
pected to receive their most
sympathetic hearing in the pro
vincial courts.
But in a 3-2 decision, the Court
of Appeals of Manitoba, sitting
in Winnipeg, ruled that the fed
eral government and Par
liament could ask the British
Parliament to expand the Cana
dian constitution and transfer it
to Canada even without the ap
proval of the provinces. At pres
ent, the Canadian constitution is
actually a law of the British
Parliament known as the Brit
ish North America Act.
Chief Justice Samuel Freed
man, on behalf of the majority,

wrote that there was no legal
convention that required the
support of the provinces for con
stitutional amendments that af
fect them. To back up his ruling,
Freedman cited a decision of
the Supreme Court of Canada in
1979.
Supreme Court appeal
The legal battling, however,
is far from over. The premiers
also have filed suits in the
highest courts of the provinces
of Quebec and Newfoundland
and intend to appeal the Manito
ba decision to the Supreme
Court of Canada in Ottawa.
Some provincial officials
tried to find some solace in the
defeat.
"Sometimes the hard legal
decisions," said Bill Marshall,
deputy premier of Newfound
land, "do not follow always
what it is morally correct, what
is politically correct, and what
is in the good of the entire social
order."
For the moment, however,
the Manitoba decision undercut
the six premiers along with Joe
Clark, leader of the opposition
in Parliament and a British Par
liamentary committee in their
insistence that it was illegal for
the federal government to act
unilaterally on the constitution.
'Patriation'
The issue centers on what Ca
nadians call "patriation" of the
constitution. Since it is an act of
the British Parliament, the con
stitution can only be amended
by the British Parliament.
Trudeau's proposals would
change this remnant of colonial
ism by legally transferring the
act from the British Parliament
to the Canadian Parliament.

This would ensure that, in the
future, only Canada would have
the right to amend its constitu
tion.
In principle, all Canadian pol
iticians agree on the need for
this, but the issue has been com
plicated by Trudeau's in
sistence that the British Par
liament expand the constitution
with a bill of rights before patri
ating it. Since the bill of rights
would limit the powers of the
provinces, the six premiers con
tend that it cannot be enacted
without their consent.
In Ottawa, members of
Trudeau's Liberal Party
seemed jubilant over the Mani
toba court decision while mem
bers of Clark's Progressive Con
servative Party tended to down
play its importance.
The lawsuit had been filed in
Manitoba by the governments of
the provinces of Manitoba, Que
bec, Newfoundland, Alberta,
British Columbia, and Prince
Edward Island — six of Cana
da's 10 provinces. The case
itself, like the similar cases in
Newfoundland and Quebec, was
cited both by the Progressive
Conservative opposition in the
Canadian Parliament and by the
committee on foreign and com
monwealth affairs of the British
Parliament as evidence that
Trudeau's methods were ques
tionable from a legal and con
stitutional point of view. For
this reason, both groups urged
rejection of the Trudeau pro
posals.
The Manitoba decision weak
ened this argument con
siderably since, in the view of
many constitutional analysts, it
is unlikely to be overturned by
the Supreme Court of Canada.
