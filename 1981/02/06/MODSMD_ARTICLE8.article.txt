# Spain's leader inherits troubles

Madrid, Spain (AP) — The first political crisis
since Spanish democracy was born again four
years ago is not proving easy to solve, and the out
come is of vital importance to the United States
and its European allies.
"It's not just another European game of musi
cal chairs," said a Spanish diplomat, referring to
the frequent government changes in Italy.
Adolfo Suarez, who became premier in 1976 af
ter the death of dictator Francisco Franco, unex
pectedly resigned Jan. 29. His generally con
servative party, the Union of the Democratic Cen
ter, picked Deputy Premier Leopoldo Calvo
Sotelo to succeed him, but hopes that he would be
confirmed quickly have proved too optimistic.
King Juan Carlos, obviously sensing problems
if not turmoil, has set aside plans for a trip to the
United States until he has a new government se
curely in place.
It is the first time that Spanish democracy's
fragile structure is being put to the test of orderly
transition. If there is a swing to the far left or a
rightist military coup, which is not entirely ex
cluded, what is at stake for the Western Alliance?
Defense bastion
While Spain is not yet a member of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, Western military
specialists consider it a bastion of Western de
fense. Located at one end of the Mediterranean, it
has four U.S. bases and more than 9500 U.S. mili

tary and Defense Department personnel on its
territory.
The base agreements expire in September, and
the U.S. and Spanish governments are now nego
tiating their renewal.
Spain spends some billion dollars annually
on defense, more than Canada, a NATO member.
Suarez was edging gingerly toward membership
in the alliance, with 1983 his target date.
But should Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists have to
be admitted to the government to form a majori
ty, Spain's entry into NATO and the future of the
U.S. bases would probably be challenged.
Common Market
Cold-shouldered by much of Western Europe in
the days of the Franco dictatorship, Spain has also
been attempting to enter the 10-member Europe
an Common Market, which would benefit Spanish
goods and give it the European political accep
tance it so desires.
Lurking behind the political confusion in Spain
is the continuing problem of Basque terrorism.
King Juan Carlos' recent trip to the Basque coun
try. a courageous move in the eyes of many, may
undercut the more militant Basques and lead to an
eventual solution of the problem of Basque sepa
ratism.
But if the terrorism continues, pressure for a
strong-handed military government will surely
increase.
