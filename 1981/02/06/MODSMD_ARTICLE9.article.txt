From the Daily wire services
New York — Former Gov.
Ella Grasso of Connecticut,
the first woman to be elected
chief executive of a state
without following her hus
band into office, died of
cancer at Hartford Hospital
yesterday. She was 61.
She had been reported in
critical condition Sunday
(Feb. 1) after becoming
semi-comatose. The turn for
the worse had followed a
good week, and physicians
had planned additional
chemotherapy in an effort to
arrest the cancer that had
spread through her liver.
The two-term governor re
signed Dec. 4, effective New
Year's Eve, because her ill
ness was draining her of the
strength and stamina needed
to perform her duties.
Grasso underwent surgery
last April, and it was later
disclosed that doctors had
found cancer. However, af
ter eight weeks of radiation
treatment, the physicians
said she was free of all signs
of the disease. But, in De
cember, she entered the hos
pital again and the doctors
found that the cancer had
reached her liver.
Grasso was in the middle
of her second term as gov
ernor, and, until April, when
she first learned she had
cancer, she had intended to
seek a third term.
The day Grasso resigned,
her successor, Lt. Gov. Wil
liam O'Neill, who was
elected on the ticket with her
in 1978, said, "The people of
this state mean more to her
than her own pride or well
being."
The first woman governor
of Connecticut — known to
her constituents as "Ella," a
neighbor and friend — she

had no qualms about hugging
voters openly or rushing to
provide on-the-spot comfort
and aid to victims of crippl
ing blizzards, floods or torna
does.
The picture most voters
remember was of a woman
who often perched her eye
glasses on her short-cropped,
tousled hair while pondering
the issues affecting the
Nutmeg State.
To the public, Grasso, a
Democrat, was a relaxed,
down-to-earth politician who
could be very tough around
election time. She had won
re-election in 1978 with a
campaign that stressed fis
cal responsibility.
At her inauguration, she
marched to the state Capitol
to mixed themes — the music
of "Yankee Doodle Dandy"
and "Star Wars." And, after
a 19-gun salute, she told the
audience gathered in Hart
ford that the challenge of the
next year was "to do our job
and meet our responsibilities
with concern and sensitivity
— to do our job with no new
or increased taxes."
Grasso's husband and
their son and daughter were
with her when she died, Bat
taglio said, adding the family
asked the public "to join us
tonight in praying for the
governor and her family."
During her llVi-weeks in
the hospital, Grasso was giv
en the last rites of the Roman
Catholic Church many times.
Gov. William O'Neill, who
took over as governor after
Grasso resigned, said she
would lie in state at the State
Capitol from 11 am'. Sunday
until 11 a.m. Monday. Her fu
neral was scheduled for noon
Monday at St. Joseph's
Cathedral.
