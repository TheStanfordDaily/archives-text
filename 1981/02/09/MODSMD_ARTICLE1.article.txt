# Panelists discuss future of U. S. policy on S. Africa
## 
### Christine Myers 
"Progressive forces must deal with
the fundamental and historical right
of the African people to have a sov
ereign state,'' said Randall Robinson,
guest speaker at Thursday's public
symposium on South Africa.
Robinson, the executive director of
Trans Africa, a Black American lobby
ing organization, participated in a
critical analysis of U.S foreign policy
toward South Africa. Other partici
pants included Hoover Institution Sen
ior Fellow Lewis Gann, Political Sci
ence Prof. David Abernethy, and
Ph.D. candidates Jacquelyn Howard
and Mwesiga Baregu.
All panelists agreed apartheid,
South Africa's system of institu
tionalized racism, is an intolerable sit
uation in which the United States has a
powerful economic stake. Although
generally acknowledging that South
Africa's political system cannot sur
vive, panelists disagreed on what
should constitute U.S policy,in what
form such policy changes should
come, how long the process of change

would take, and how much bloodshed
would be necessary before the coun
try's 15-million member black majori
ty could achieve approximate equality
of opportunity, suffrage, representa
tion and living standards.
Economic intervention
One of the symposium's major is
sues centered around U.S. economic
involvement in South Africa. Since
1960 and significant European divest
ment in the South African economy,
the government there has developed a
strong economy backed by U.S. bank
loans.
According to Gann, the United
States can best express its disap
proval of apartheid by working to
eliminate gold price inflation. Profits
from these price hikes have greatly
benefited the present regime, said
Gann. His statement drew snickers
from the crowd of 150 in Bishop
Auditorium. Many audience members
represented the University's African
community.
Robinson called for internal pres
sure on U.S. businesses that are in

volved economically in South Africa.
More than 300 American companies
provide vital goods to South Africa, he
said, including 70 percent of its com
puters and nearly half of its oil.
Robinson explained that disinvest
ment, selling stock in banks and multi
national corporations which support
South African industry, is ineffective,
because other people buy the stock and
the action does not hurt the investors.
Sanctions
Baregu took issue with the view that
the Soviet Union's presence in Africa
justifies American support of a "de
generate, fascist system" because of
South Africa's Western affiliation.
"As an African," Baregu said, "let
me say that we are quite capable of de
ciding who our friends and enemies
are."
The Tanzanian student defined the
power struggle in South Africa as one
of nationalist self-determination rath
er than a racial one.
Baregu's sentiments were echoed
by several African students, including
three South Africans, who spoke town
meeting style during a lengthy ques
tion period after the speakers fin
ished.
Future
In contrast with Gann, who said he
believes the South African state is
powerful enough to survive much
longer than many predict, Baregu and
Robinson agreed that change is in
evitable.
According to Robinson, the only de
cision the United States has to make is
whether to be a part of that process of
change, which "could be a source of
the third international confronta
tion."
Robinson said he believes the U.S.
role should be to "fight propaganda
and misrepresentation with educa
tion."
Robinson said he does not expect
improved relations as a result of Rea
gan's election. "U.S. relations with
Africa," he predicted, "will deterio
rate tremendously over the next four
years."
Abernethy summarized the sym
posium, saying, "While most African
nations are moving toward de
mocracy, South Africa is moving
away from it." He cited events such as
the breakup of the country into
"homelands" as one of the means by
which the powerful National Party,
the current ruling coalition, maintains
its apartheid ideals.
Abernethy agreed with Robinson's
statements on the effect of Reagan's
election on U.S.-South African rela
tions, stating that U.S. policy may
constitute a "rapid move
backwards." He mentioned several
options indicative of such backward
movement.

volved economically in South Africa.
More than 300 American companies
provide vital goods to South Africa, he
said, including 70 percent of its com
puters and nearly half of its oil.
Robinson explained that disinvest
ment, selling stock in banks and multi
national corporations which support
South African industry, is ineffective,
because other people buy the stock and
the action does not hurt the investors.
Sanctions
Baregu took issue with the view that
the Soviet Union's presence in Africa
justifies American support of a "de
generate, fascist system" because of
South Africa's Western affiliation.
"As an African," Baregu said, "let
me say that we are quite capable of de
ciding who our friends and enemies
are."
The Tanzanian student defined the
power struggle in South Africa as one
of nationalist self-determination rath
er than a racial one.
Baregu's sentiments were echoed
by several African students, including
three South Africans, who spoke town
meeting style during a lengthy ques
tion period after the speakers fin
ished.
Future
In contrast with Gann, who said he
believes the South African state is
powerful enough to survive much
longer than many predict, Baregu and
Robinson agreed that change is in
evitable.
According to Robinson, the only de
cision the United States has to make is
whether to be a part of that process of
change, which "could be a source of
the third international confronta
tion."
Robinson said he believes the U.S.
role should be to "fight propaganda
and misrepresentation with educa
tion."
Robinson said he does not expect
improved relations as a result of Rea
gan's election. "U.S. relations with
Africa," he predicted, "will deterio
rate tremendously over the next four
years."
Abernethy summarized the sym
posium, saying, "While most African
nations are moving toward de
mocracy, South Africa is moving
away from it." He cited events such as
the breakup of the country into
"homelands" as one of the means by
which the powerful National Party,
the current ruling coalition, maintains
its apartheid ideals.
Abernethy agreed with Robinson's
statements on the effect of Reagan's
election on U.S.-South African rela
tions, stating that U.S. policy may
constitute a "rapid move
backwards." He mentioned several
options indicative of such backward
movement.
"Progressive forces must deal with
the fundamental and historical right
of the African people to have a sov
ereign state,'' said Randall Robinson,
guest speaker at Thursday's public
symposium on South Africa.
Robinson, the executive director of
Trans Africa, a Black American lobby
ing organization, participated in a
critical analysis of U.S foreign policy
toward South Africa. Other partici
pants included Hoover Institution Sen
ior Fellow Lewis Gann, Political Sci
ence Prof. David Abernethy, and
Ph.D. candidates Jacquelyn Howard
and Mwesiga Baregu.
All panelists agreed apartheid,
South Africa's system of institu
tionalized racism, is an intolerable sit
uation in which the United States has a
powerful economic stake. Although
generally acknowledging that South
Africa's political system cannot sur
vive, panelists disagreed on what
should constitute U.S policy,in what
form such policy changes should
come, how long the process of change

would take, and how much bloodshed
would be necessary before the coun
try's 15-million member black majori
ty could achieve approximate equality
of opportunity, suffrage, representa
tion and living standards.
Economic intervention
One of the symposium's major is
sues centered around U.S. economic
involvement in South Africa. Since
1960 and significant European divest
ment in the South African economy,
the government there has developed a
strong economy backed by U.S. bank
loans.
According to Gann, the United
States can best express its disap
proval of apartheid by working to
eliminate gold price inflation. Profits
from these price hikes have greatly
benefited the present regime, said
Gann. His statement drew snickers
from the crowd of 150 in Bishop
Auditorium. Many audience members
represented the University's African
community.
Robinson called for internal pres
sure on U.S. businesses that are in

volved economically in South Africa.
More than 300 American companies
provide vital goods to South Africa, he
said, including 70 percent of its com
puters and nearly half of its oil.

ment, selling stock in banks and multi
