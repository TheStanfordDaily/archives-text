# Japan stakes claim on islands
## 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo — Amid the noisy rumblings of Russian
disapproval, Japan pressed its claim to four Sovi
et-held islands Saturday with parades, rallies, a
sad song, promotional gimmicks and a strong of
ficial blessing from the national government.
It was the first government-proclaimed
"northern territories day"and downtown Tokyo
echoed with chants demanding the return of four
islands held by the Soviet Union since the end of
World War 11.
The government's involvement reflected its
growing irritation with Soviet military moves on
the islands and a desire to take a tougher public
posture on an issue that has a strong emotional ap
peal among many Japanese.
In Tokyo, Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki lent his
support in a rally where he declared that the Sovi
et retention of the islands "is to be deeply re
gretted." He called for "peaceful negotiations"
to get them back, something the Soviets now flatly
reject.
There were official rallies in three other cities.
The Japanese tobacco monopoly put on sale spe
cial packs of cigarettes commemorating
"northern territories day"and a girl's choir
opened the Tokyo rally with a song, "Spring Shall
Come Again," lamenting the Soviet control. More
than 90 private groups joined in the commemora
tion.
The Soviet Union attacked the event in advance
with several shrill propaganda blasts contending
that it marked another stage in the revival of
Japan"s "militarism."
By officially endorsing the rallies, the Japanese
government was making "anti-Sovietism a state
policy," declared Tass, the official Soviet news
agency. Izvestia, the government newspaper, had
labeled the event "a nationwide provocative
show."

The four islands, northeast of Japan's island of
Hokkaido, were seized by Russian forces after the
end of World War 11. Japan has pleaded ever since
for their reversion, and for a while the Soviet
Union talked of negotiations on their future. It
now claims they are not a subject for negotiation.
While nominally insisting are Japanese
territory, the government has been unable to do
anything about the islands except complain. For a
while, it appeared to be playing down the issue to
avoid fouling relations with Moscow. Japan does a
booming trade with Russia, and many busi
nessmen are eager to keep relations smooth.
On the other hand, some private groups have
charged the government with complacency and
urged it to take a bolder public stand in favor of
reversion. It was partly to satisfy those groups
that the government procliaimed this day of com
memoration.
Soviet moves to militarize the islands also has
angered the government. More than a division of
Russian troops are stationed on one of them, only
a few miles off the northern coast of Hokkaido.
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan added to a
growing mood of nervousness about Russian in
tentions and Japan-Soviet relations were further
cooled when Japan boycotted the Moscow Olym
pics and enforced economic sanctions.
Against that background, the northern islands
issue became more significant, and private
groups seeking reversion stepped up their cam
paign in the past year, calling on the government
for more public support. A nationwide petition
campaign has received more than 18 million sig
natures and the support of more than 1600 vil
lages, towns and cities.
Feb. 7 was picked for the commemoration be
cause it was on that day in 1855 that Japan and
czarist Russia signed a treaty of commerce and
friendship that confirmed, among other things,
Japan's claims to the four islands.
