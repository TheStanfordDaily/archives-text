# Iranians bickering

Beirut, Lebanon (AP) — With
the U.S. hostages no longer a
rallying point, the deep
divisions of revolutionary Iran
are flaring up again in verbal
battles between its leaders and
street fighting between parti
sans.
Supreme ruler Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini has de
clared himself neutral and re
peatedly called for unity in the
face of the 4-month-old war with
Iraq. But he threatened in a
Feb. 4 speech to withdraw sup
port for Iran's political leaders
if they did not stop "biting each
other like scorpions."
The basic rift is between
Iran's ultra-conservative Is
lamic clergy, who command a
large following among the Per
sian nation's 36 million people,
and the more pragmatic secular
and ethnic minority groups, who
resent the clergy's dominance
of government.
It is best illustrated by the en
mity between President
Abolhassan Bani Sadr, a
Western-educated moderate,
and Prime Minister Moham
mad Ali Rajai, a Moslem fun
damentalist. Rajai has resisted
Bani Sadr's authority, exclud
ing him from Cabinet decisions
and the drafting of legislation.
Bani Sadr has repeatedly
labeled Rajai "incompetent."
Until the hostages were freed
Jan. 20, both groups appeared
united by their hatred of what
Khomeini branded "the Great
Satan," the United States. Since
then, however, the terms of the
hostage deal, the war with Iraq
and the power of political lead
ers have all been questioned by
groups challenging the govern
ment's authority.
Last Friday, members of the
Marxist Fedayeen (Men of Sac
rifice) guerrilla group defied a
government ban on demonstra
tions and rallied 7000 to 10,000
supporters at Freedom Square
in Tehran.
Between 30 and 40 people
were injured, some by gunfire,
when the Marxists clashed with
members of a loosely organized
Islamic fundamentalist group,
the Hezbollahi (God's Party)
under the towering concrete
arches originally designed as a
tribute to the late shah.
Earlier that week, Bani Sadr,
who has been bitterly criticized
by clerics for failing to block an
Iraqi invasion, increased at
tacks on his opponents, accusing
them of trying to impose "a new
tyranny."
When the U.S. hostages were
freed, the Bani Sadr accused
Rajai of keeping him unin
formed of the last stages of the
hostage negotiations and of fail
ing to make the deal conditional
on U.S. delivery of arms bought
by the shah.
