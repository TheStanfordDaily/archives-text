# Tips on the writing biz

If you've ever considered a career in jour
nalism or publishing and 1) you're enterprising
and persevering, 2) salary is no consideration
(lack of it, that is) and 3) you feel it's so impor
tant that you've just got to do it, then relax.
The odds are very good that eventually you'll
make it, and love every minute on the way
there.
That seems to be the general consensus of
two separate informal discussion held these
past two weeks at Stanford, addressing the
"how to's" in securing — and enduring — that
first job in publishing or journalism.
Recent years have seen a proliferation of
publishing courses designed to introduce the
"wide-eyed and naive" to the working side of
the industry. .One of the oldest is the 34-year
old Publishing Procedures Course at Radcliffe
College.
Frank Collins was on campus last week in
terviewing prospective students for what he
jokingly referred to as "one of the shortest
grad programs in the country": the six week
summer publishing training program in Bos
ton. Collins has the unenviable task of select
ing 80 people for the course, out of approx
imately 400 applicants.
Quite young and with a light-hearted, engag
ing manner, Collins was still very quick to dis
pel the notion of writing or publishing as a
glamorous or "ivory tower" work environ
ment.
According to Collins, the popular myth of
people going into publishing to continue in
tellectual pursuits while getting paid for it is
generally not true at all. "Publishing, along
with writing, is highly speculative and "one of
the most impossible jobs situations around.
Getting a secure 'foot in the door' is probably
the most difficult thing to deal with — can be
very dehumanizing. There's nothing worse
than being just out of college, unemployed with
little experience, and out looking for a job."
This is precisely why the phenonenon of
summer publishing courses have been gaining
popularity year after year. "The most valu
able function of the training," said Collins, "is
that it helps you define your interests from the
start. It also gives you a grasp of the language,
and employers are definitely more secure, in
any field, with people who have the vocab
ulary."
Besides the "hands on" experience, the fact
that you've spent time and money in the course
tells employers that you're very serious about
a career in that field, and any advantage in an
overcrowded field is something you can work
with.

What else can a person do to enhance his/her
employment visibility at the expense of the
competition?
According to Fred Nelson, panelist at a
CPPC sponsored discussion of careers in jour
nalism and publishing at Tressider on Jan. 29,
"a well-rounded curriculum is essential for a
writer. Employers are looking for people who
have a diversified background and the ability
to communicate clearly."
Nelson is special projects editor at Sunset
magazine, and emphasized that in the maga
zine industry, whether a journal is "staff writ
ten" as opposed to "non-staff written" (e.g.
Sunset vs. Harper's) is a key to finding em
ployment. In non-staff written magazines, the
principle job of writing is usually given to es
tablished free lancers and "big news" person
alities. Thus, according to Nelson, the main
thrust of job inquiries should be directed to
publications that are staff-written: re
searched, written and assembled by per
manent staffers.
Phyllis Brown, a Stanford graduate recently
employed by the Peninsula Times Tribune,
says "You have to be willing to start out any
where" to get "a foot in the door" in journal
ism. Her first "break" was a year spent in re
searching, writing, publishing and distributing
a small community newsletter. "They paid me
$200 for what was an estimated 20 hour work
week ; actually it was closer to between 45 and
50 hours, but it was great experience." Brown
also noted that entry opportunities are gener
ally better on small town and weekly publica
tions.
Delia van Heyst, director of the Stanford
Publishing Course (out of the Stanford Alumni
Association; designed primarily for pro
fessionals, but also accepting a small number
of college graduates) emphasized a number of
points for increasing your employment poten
tial ; 1) Research — Small press publishing has
been growing immensely in the past few
years; as well as the magazine industry. Look
carefully for interests that closely comple
ment yours and pursue these thoroughly. 2)
Perseverence — "always follow your resume
with a telephone call or letter." Only two out of
10 people bother to write a 'thank you' letter;
your interest in keeping close contact might be
a deciding factor. 3) Internships — Anything
"extra" to demonstrate your serious interest.
4) Proofread — A flawed cover letter is an ins
tant disqualifier in spite of a beautiful resume.
Her final note was an emphasis on en
thusiasm. "What you call recognizable talent
is really enthusiasm; really a desire to get into
something and do it."
