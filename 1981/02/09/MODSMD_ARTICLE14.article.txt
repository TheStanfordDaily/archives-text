A California law which took effect
on January 1 requires all doctors in
the state to report suspected sexual
relations by their female patients un
der 18. The reports are to be made to
"child protective agencies" as part
of a general program aimed at pre
venting child abuse. It was also felt
in Sacramento that this law would
encourage the largely dormant en
forcement of statutory rape laws.
This law represents a redundant
and overbroad attempt by the legis
lature to deal effectively with a seri
ous problem. There are already stat
utory reporting requirements for
child abuse. The new law does not
discriminate between incestual or
abusive sexual relations on the one
hand and consensual relationships on
the other. This inquiry into the most
private and intimate affairs of an in

dividual is hardly justified solely on
the basis of age.
The California Medical Associa
tion filed suit last week in San Fran
cisco to prevent enforcement of the
law. Should the law be allowed, to
stand as written, there would be a
chilling effect on the doctor-patient
relationship in some of the situations
in which it is most essential. The
likely deterrent effect of this law will
not be on men who have sex with
young women, but on young women
who, for reasons of public and
private health, should be most en
couraged to seek medical advice. A
young woman who suspects that she
may be pregnant or have venereal
disease may hestitate about going to
a doctor for tests under this law.
Even if the tests prove negative, the
doctor may regard the request for

tests as "suspicious" and dutifully
file his report, with some inquiring
government worker checking on the
woman a few weeks later. It is ironic
and unfortunate that the California
legislature picks a time when the
teenage pregnancy rate is soaring
and venereal disease transcends
epidemic proportions to deter the
prompt and effective detection of
either.
It is difficult to imagine a more
misguided and inappropriate piece
of legislation. Many doctors across
the state have already asserted that
they do not intend to submit the re
quired reports. The new California
legislature need not wait until the
resolution of the California Medical
Association's suit to repeal this stat
ute.
