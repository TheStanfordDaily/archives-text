## Washington experiences a new beginning 
### 
If Bonzo can do it, so can I. We
were both beginning something
new. About the same time
Ronald Reagan was elected
president I decided to stop out
for the winter. Oddly enough,
we both ended up in the same
city, Washington, D.C.
A week ago last Monday I
began working for my con
gressman in his Washington of
fice. My tenure there lasts until
the end of March. In a series of
articles I hope to convey some
of the highlights of the com
bined experience of stopping
out/working/being in Washing
ton. The change from Stanford
is a big one, but something that
any semi-domestic, tolerant,
patient individual can weather
without having to get on all
fours and bark like a dog. It's
fun to be out of school.
The most pertinent topic of
discussion at this point coin
cides with Bonzo's own theme of
renewal: A New Beginning. No,
I have not seen Martin Trep
tow's grave. But there are cer
tain aspects of being here that
merit mention.
First the city. Government is
everywhere, and obviously a
massive machine. It's as if the
blob ate what was here before
and spit it out in the form of
white stone buildings and civil
servants. The second biggest
employer in town is the Wash
ington Post, with 5000 drones on
the payroll.
Looking over the city is an im
pressive sight, and at times —
as when standing at the foot of
the Lincoln Memorial gazing
across the Mall at the stark

pride of the Washington Mon
ument and the ornate nobility of
the Capitol Building — a moving
one. Yet it's government never
theless.
Underneath the glory, as un
derneath anything, especially
glory, there are small cogs. As
an intern in my congressman's
office, I'm one of the smaller
ones.
To answer the first question,
no there is not a signature ma
chine — he signs everything by
hand. Through some primary
observations, based on my ex
periences and those of my room
mate, here are a few ideas about
"what a congressional office
is."
First, it is a lot of letters. Peo
ple do write their congressman,
and every letter received is an
swered. My job one afternoon
last week was to explain to an
eighth grader what the con
gressman felt about putting a
McDonald's in his town. "Tell
him that really isn't in the hands
of the federal government," I
was told by the. member
himself, "and give him a kind of
lesson in civic government." A
fairly responsive response,
n 'est-ce pas?
Secondly, the office is a ma
jor group effort. An overview of
the staff would show a set of
people trying to coordinate all
their efforts in the name of the
Hon. Cong. X (names will not be
used, nor are they necessary for
the basic understanding of the
experience) . The feeling is close
to that of being an 11th century
monk acting in the name of the
Lord, only the Lord didn't have
to sign everything. Our man is
not a diety,. but he does com

mand the focus and force of our
meager personnel.
Some other biggies in the of
fice: image making — "if we
can't get any legislation
through, let's at least get a
grant so people in the district
see that he's doing something."
A direct quote from the head
policy maker and a general at
titude in a very hard to hold dis
trict. Competition — yes, Stan
ford is not the only place on
earth where people sweat for no
good reason. I've found it most
acute among the two other in
terns ; a symptom of the "who is
going to rise above the rest
first" disease. We all have our
methods.
Seriousness — people here
take themselves seriously. That
makes life fun for a deviant like
myself.
One event that when discuss
ing my stay here I cannot fail to
mention is the inauguration.
The town was psyched for Ron
nie. The only thing I saw of any
historical importance was Nan
cy's flaming red coat, which
will probably end up in a
museum some day.
What was missed in seeing
Reagan, however, was made up
by being in the crowd. The antic
ipation, the oath and the emo
tion were too great a combina
tion to go unnoticed. One woman
near me began to cry. She came
from Pennsylvania to cry.
Somehow that kind of thing
doesn't come across on TV.
Of course part of the new be
ginning is living away from
Food Service, weekend parties
and notetaking. As Ganski said,
"It's a jungle out there, but it's
not just here, it's all over." So

far the biggest encounter with
the jungle/siege mentality has
been a towed car. Grim ex
perience. And if you think that
The Odd Couple is a fiction of
Neil Simon's creation, wait un
til you live with someone else
and he doesn't know how to do
the dishes.
All I can say is that some
thing's always going on. Each
day If igure out a new way to do
part of life people on TV make
look so easy — like ride buses

for example. Fifty minutes to
work has to be a record 112 And
with the hostages back, every
thing's just peachy.
Next column's topic will be
Bonzo meets the Washington so
cial scene . . . and likes it. Until
then, keep eating those jelly
beans.
