Make no mistake
If mv experience as an em
ployee had not already made me
conclude that unionization will
be the only way for Stanford's
clerical staff to receive the rec
ognition which we deserve, the
patronizing tone of Donald Ken
nedy's letter of January 27 in
forming all University faculty
and staff of his belief that "it
would be a mistake to unionize"
would have convinced me on its
own.
Are we not a legitimate part
of the "University" of which he
speaks? When Kennedy says
"ultimately the University has
to deal with those problems" —
he mentions salary levels, bene
fits, career opportunities, and
working conditions — can he ac
tually think the staff in question
has nothing to contribute to the
process? Why shouldn't "the
group so important to the
smooth functioning of the Uni
versity" have a voice in the set
ting of priorities, the allocation
of resources which we all recog
nize to be finite?
Of course, "unions don't auto
matically solve these prob
lems", and the implication that
those who are for a union think
so is gratuitously insulting. I,
for one, didn't sign a blue card
and do not intend to vote in favor
of union recognition because I
expect anything to be auto
matic; I am for unionization of
the clerical staff because I be
lieve that people have not just a
right but also an obligation to
stanf up for themselves, to ask
for credit where credit is due,
and to work together so that
some of the huge reservoir of
wasted potential on this campus
may be tapped.
There can be no "University
community" while there are
second class citizens in it.
Clerical workers, the great ma
jority of whom are women, are

consistently ignored at Stan
ford; we are subjected to the
whims of administrators who
all to often combine a woeful ig
norance of day-to-day working
procedures with a myopic un
willingness even to acknowl
edge, much less make use of,
the expertise of staff who are
right under their noses. In last
year's revamping of library sup
port staff job classifications, for
example, not one person whose
job fell under those classi
fications was consulted!
There is no way for any of us
as individuals to change the sit
uation. One voice is simply not
heeded, as many who obediently
"go through channels" can at
test. Underpaid and under
classified clerical staff are ex
pected to be docile, "good little
girls" (and now a few "boys"),
as we observe short-sighted
planning and wasteful expen
ditures on the one hand (the
energy gobbling new East Wing
of the Green Library is an exam
ple) and deliberate and cynical
policies of understating, under
classification, encouragement
of high turnover, and the re
peated hiring of "temporary"
employees on the other.
President Kennedy's
benevolent counsel
nothwithstanding, Stanford's
clerical staff would be foolish to
count on the "University's best
interest" to solve the problems
of coping with inflation, dis
crimination, job stress and frus
tration, health and safety con
cerns, and the like. We can only
count on ourselves.
Fortunately, there is strength
in numbers. Vote "yes"' for
union recognition for Stanford's
clerical staff on May 7.

Analysis absurd
Eric Clow's recent comments
(Daily, Feb. 3) astound me.
They betray an absurd analysis
of the Shah's overthrow, a stu
pendous ignorance of independ
ent African nations, and a hallu
cinatory fear of the Soviet
Union.
It is more shocking that his
remarks do indicate some
knowledge of conditions in
South Africa. Clow has twice
seen f.ast Grave at Dimbaza
and has read Keith Archuleta's
informative article (Daily. Jan.
29). He knows South Africa by
constitution is a racist society
that systematically deprives
blacks of civil rights. He knows
the black majority has been al
lotted a mere 13 percent of the
land and that upon this barren
terrain half the children die
before their sixth year. He like
wise knows about the nefarious
pass sytem, the degrading and
dangerous conditions under
which black miners labor, and
the dramatic wage differentials
between black and white work
ers in all sectors of the econo
my.
When Clow said,"The condi
tions of blacks in South Africa
certainly sound terrible from
the perspective of students at
Stanford,'' he is acknowledging
injustice. But, he is also imply
ing that Stanford students would
see starving children, forcibly
separated families, and the per
manent threat of prosecution,
as criminal assaults on their hu
manity, while African blacks
suffer little because they are
less civilized and more ac
customed to deprivation.
The virulence of this racist at
titude does not so much derive
from the public articulation of

debasing stereotypes as from
the way stereotypes (named or
implied) are used to justify
domination. If black South
Africans do not feel their op
pression, and if given the op
portunity they too will create a
tyrannical order, then pragmat
ic U.S. support of the apartheid
regime does not pose an ethical
problem. The logic of racism
makes it possible to blithely
choose chrome and manganese
over the human rights of dark
skinned people in Africa, just as
within our boundaries and past
it has been easy to choose Indian
lands and African labor over the
rights and lives of either people.
What most disturbs me about
Clow's perspective is its per
vasiveness — though rarely do
others enunciate it so crudely.
Many of us at Stanford and at
other pockets of privilege
across the U.S. appear to live
almost exemplary lives in the
narrow compass of our daily
rounds, yet our racism and self
interest spawn a certain failure
of sensibility and imagination.
We do not feel starvation in
South Africa, butchery in El
Salvador, genocide in Atlanta.
Perhaps we have not yet over
come our own barbarism.
