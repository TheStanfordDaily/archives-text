## Former minority has last laugh 
### 
A long oppressed minority is
beginning to show itself on the
Stanford campus. After years of
unwarranted and cruel social
oppression at the hands of the
majority, this new group will
soon make its power felt. They
are not a negligible force,
either; their power extends gov
ernment, business, the arts and
the Palo Alto YMCA. Who is this
silent minority turned majori
ty? The Republicans, of course.
All you vote-fearing Demo
crats had better beware; this
new group will not hesitate to
make themselves seen and
heard all over campus. You will
see them walking hand in hand
with others of their persuasion,
in broad daylight, flaunting
their differences. Soon, they
will ask for meeting space at the
Old Firehouse. No more will so
ciety compel them to hold their
until now socially unacceptable
meetings in the defensive safety
of Sigma Chi or the clandestine
corridors of the Cummings Art
Building. In the future, we can
expect to see state-wide refer
enda on the subject of hiring
openly Republican teachers and
appointments of openly Re
publican judges. It is all part of

the new freedom.
After years of depression at
the hands of the New Deal Dem
ocrats, the Republicans have
emerged with an air of mincing
defiance to flaunt their new
found freedom. Thousands of
them will soon come out of the
closet. Some will be your
friends, maybe even a relative,
for Republicans are born, not
made. They will dress in a
manner befitting their free
choice. They will walk like Re
publicans, act like it, and not be
afraid of living their lives in the
Republican way. You will see
long lines of them waiting for
the eleven o'clock service at
Pastor Milton Friedman's
Church of Orthodox Free Choice
Economics.
As an example of their emer
gence, Republicans in our area
have already planned a number
of activities: all-Republican
dances at the Old Firehouse,
Halloween parades on (James
K.) Polk Street in San Francis
co, Republican awareness week
and Republican blue jeans day.
You will see them at the upcom
ing Viennese Ball wearing their
hand tailored suits, making
wisecracks about the Demo
crats in their "waltz and wear"
suits.
We will soon see a prolifera
tion of other Republican causes
such as increased nuclear arms
deployment, decreased social
spending, more law school ap
plications, and more button
down all-cotton shirts. As their
power increases, they will not
hesitate to get what they want:
massive budget cuts, abolition
of certain social programs, and
more pre-law courses.
As their group grows in size
we will.see them lounging about
Tresidder, dressed alike, talk
ing about oil, or stocks, or trust
funds, trying to feel accepted in
their cloneliness. With one of
them in the White House, there

is no limit to how far they will go
to brandish their sudden power.
Gone is the social stigma that
has kept them in check since the
Watergate days. No doubt there
will be more Republican parties
at which innocent young mEn
and women will be seduced by
the apparent strength of their
political positions. Thousands of
these innocents will throw New
Deal liberalism to the winds,
and in the decadent college at
mosphere, will embrace the
new conservatism.
I knew one such lad. The un
fortunate boy was a roommate
of mine. After living together
for two weeks, he mentioned
how happy he was that Ronald
Reagan had been elected. I grew
suspicious. In time he fully re
vealed his conservative
weakness to me. I moved out,
not being able to tolerate such
activity in my room. I could not
deal with his activities, and was
at the time too insecure to risk
others thinking that I might be
Republican, too. I remember
the day he called his parents and
told them. His father disowned
him immediately, and someone
said his mother ate a bottle of
pills. It was very hard on the
boy, but he found comfort with
his friends. In all, it was a psy
chologically excruciating ex
perience for him. A truly sad
sight.
Mothers of Palo Alto, heed
this warning before it is too late.
The minute your son leaves the
house, does he put on another
shirt? Is he starting to memo
rize jokes about Democrats?
Are certain words creeping into
his conversation? Words like
"containment?" If so, my
friend, you have got trouble,
with a capital "T," gotta rhyme
it with "P," and that stands for
President.

vealed his conservative
weakness to me. I moved out,
not being able to tolerate such
activity in my room. I could not
deal with his activities, and was
at the time too insecure to risk
others thinking that I might be
Republican, too. I remember
the day he called his parents and
told them. His father disowned
him immediately, and someone
said his mother ate a bottle of
pills. It was very hard on the
boy, but he found comfort with
his friends. In all, it was a psy
chologically excruciating ex
perience for him. A truly sad
sight.
Mothers of Palo Alto, heed
this warning before it is too late.
The minute your son leaves the
house, does he put on another
shirt? Is he starting to memo
rize jokes about Democrats?
Are certain words creeping into
his conversation? Words like
"containment?" If so, my
friend, you have got trouble,
with a capital "T," gotta rhyme
it with "P," and that stands for
President.

A long oppressed minority is
beginning to show itself on the
Stanford campus. After years of
unwarranted and cruel social
oppression at the hands of the
majority, this new group will
soon make its power felt. They
are not a negligible force,
either; their power extends gov
ernment, business, the arts and
the Palo Alto YMCA. Who is this
silent minority turned majori
ty? The Republicans, of course.
All you vote-fearing Demo
crats had better beware; this
new group will not hesitate to
make themselves seen and
heard all over campus. You will
see them walking hand in hand
with others of their persuasion,
in broad daylight, flaunting
their differences. Soon, they
will ask for meeting space at the
Old Firehouse. No more will so
ciety compel them to hold their
until now socially unacceptable
meetings in the defensive safety
of Sigma Chi or the clandestine
corridors of the Cummings Art
Building. In the future, we can
expect to see state-wide refer
enda on the subject of hiring
openly Republican teachers and
appointments of openly Re
publican judges. It is all part of

the new freedom.
After years of depression at
the hands of the New Deal Dem
ocrats, the Republicans have
emerged with an air of mincing
defiance to flaunt their new
found freedom. Thousands of
them will soon come out of the
closet. Some will be your
friends, maybe even a relative,
for Republicans are born, not
made. They will dress in a
manner befitting their free
choice. They will walk like Re
publicans, act like it, and not be
afraid of living their lives in the
Republican way. You will see
long lines of them waiting for
the eleven o'clock service at
Pastor Milton Friedman's
Church of Orthodox Free Choice
Economics.
As an example of their emer
gence, Republicans in our area
have already planned a number
of activities: all-Republican
dances at the Old Firehouse,
Halloween parades on (James
K.) Polk Street in San Francis
co, Republican awareness week
and Republican blue jeans day.
You will see them at the upcom
ing Viennese Ball wearing their
hand tailored suits, making
wisecracks about the Demo
crats in their "waltz and wear"
suits.
We will soon see a prolifera
tion of other Republican causes
such as increased nuclear arms
deployment, decreased social
spending, more law school ap
plications, and more button
down all-cotton shirts. As their
power increases, they will not
hesitate to get what they want:
massive budget cuts, abolition
of certain social programs, and
more pre-law courses.
As their group grows in size
we will.see them lounging about
Tresidder, dressed alike, talk
ing about oil, or stocks, or trust
funds, trying to feel accepted in
their cloneliness. With one of
them in the White House, there

is no limit to how far they will go
to brandish their sudden power.
Gone is the social stigma that
has kept them in check since the
Watergate days. No doubt there
will be more Republican parties
at which innocent young mEn
and women will be seduced by
the apparent strength of their
political positions. Thousands of
these innocents will throw New
Deal liberalism to the winds,
and in the decadent college at
mosphere, will embrace the
new conservatism.
I knew one such lad. The un
fortunate boy was a roommate
of mine. After living together
for two weeks, he mentioned
how happy he was that Ronald
Reagan had been elected. I grew
suspicious. In time he fully re
vealed his conservative
weakness to me. I moved out,
not being able to tolerate such
activity in my room. I could not
deal with his activities, and was
at the time too insecure to risk
others thinking that I might be
Republican, too. I remember
