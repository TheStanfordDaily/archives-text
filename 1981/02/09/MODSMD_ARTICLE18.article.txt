## Unique solution to mascot controversy 
### 
Although the football season
and its traditional free-for-all
on the mascot issue are long
since over, it seems to me nec
essary to examine the issue
once again. This necessity
stems from the impending ref
erendum which may decide
things once and for all. The final
decision should be made only af
ter all alternatives have been
carefully examined.
The search for a new mascot
began about a decade ago when
then-President Richard Lyman
removed the Indian as Stan
ford's official symbol. Since
that time, the debate continued
in an on-again, off-again
manner until it climaxed about
two years ago. At that time, the
issue was one of the major top
ics of argument around campus.
The Opinion pages of the Daily
were filled with editorials, col
umns, and letters promoting
one choice or another. Gaieties

even had our lack of a suitable
mascot as its theme.
Basically, everyone agreed
about the characteristics of the
perfect mascot: it should suit
the Stanford style, it should not
offend anyone, it should be
unique, and it should be some
thing that most students could
agree on. The problem came in
finding a possibility that satis
fied these criteria.
The old choices, which had
been around since the con
troversy began, didn't meet the
requirements very well. The
"Trees" was seen by many peo
ple as somewhere between com
ical and idiotic. The "Bobber
Barons" was offensive to the
finer sensibilities of The Alum
ni. The "Gryphons" was a bit
too "he-man-ish" for most peo
ple (besides, no one could spell
it), and the "Cardinals" was
just plain boring.
As time went on, new possi
bilities were suggested with less
and less seriousness. "Mascot
Searches" turned up such ideas
as the Stanford Passes, the
Stanford Incompletes, the Stan
ford Students, and the Stanford
Accelerators. Gaieties had its
hopeful audience on the edge of
its collective seat before unveil
ing its awesome solution: the
Stanford "Uhhhh". Gaieties'
example led to a new strain of
suggestions which were not
animate/inanimate objects.
Examples of this genre included
the Stanford Experience, the
Stanford Years, and the Stan
ford Life.
Finally, the situation reached
a point where the prospect of
finding a mascot on which ev
eryone could agree seemed so
hopeless that steps were taken
to choose whichever possibility
satisfied the most people. The
result of these steps is the up
coming referendum.
It seems to me unlikely that
any improvement will result
from choosing one of the current
possibilities. First, I think it is
somewhat counterproductive to
replace the united, uniform and
mild dislike of our current
mascot, the "Cardinals", with
the factionalism and downright
hatred which may well result
from the choice of a "lesser
evil". Second, Stanford is not
just any university, and not just
any mascot will do.

About a year ago, I became
convinced that one of the sug
gestions being kicked about at
the time was indeed a suitable
solution. Simply by dropping
our "s", we'could become the
Stanford Cardinal - the color -
and join Harvard (which isn't
just any university either) with
its Crimson. As I have con
sidered this colorful solution,
however, I have become con
vinced that such a blatant op
portunity to copy Harvard is a
bit too cute to have occured nat
urally. In fact, I am suspicious
that our original adoption of the
"Cardinals" - ostensibly to pre
serve our color - resulted from
some administrative desire to
drop the "s" someday. In any
case, I don't like the idea of
Stanford following after
Harvard and thereby assuming
a subordinate role. I prefer to
see Stanford as a leader, and ex
pect innovation in the solution of
the mascot problem.

A few months ago, amidst
various casual conversations
with friends and acquaintances,
I quite unexpectedly bumped
into what I believe is the an
swer. It is a solution which is in
novative (no, I didn't think of
it), which can't possibly offend
anyone, which fits Stanford's
style, and which may well be
something that the students can

agree upon. The solution is sim
ply to have no mascot.
Before turning the page in
condemnation, consider the
question for a moment. After
all, why do we really need, or
want, a mascot? Surely the
"Cardinals" is not so inspiring
that school spirit would be lost
without it to rally around. Also,
wouldn't it be nice to see "Stan
ford" in the headlines than
"Cards", "Robber Barons",
"Trees", "Gryphons", "Tur
keys", or "Accelerators"? I for
one am a little embarassed ev
ery time I open the paper and
see "Cards" splattered all over
the Sporting Green. Besides,
how many students actually re
fer to our teams as the "Cards"
anyway? Don't most of your
friends use "Stanford"? Why
should we bother with a mascot
that no one uses simply for the
benefit of the sportswriters?
I believe that we can make a
great innovative step, suitable
to the uniqueness of this univer
sity, by choosing to eliminate
our mascot. In any case, I don't
want to tether future Stanford
students with a "lesser evil"
simply because I am too impa
tient to wait for the right
mascot.
