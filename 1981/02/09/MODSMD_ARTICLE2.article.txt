Hartford, Conn. (AP)— The
body of former Gov. Ella Grasso
lay in state from 11 a.m. yesterday
and will lie in state until 11 a.m. to
day, with the first hour reserved
for private mourning by her hus
band, Tom, and their children, Sus
ane and Jim.
For 23 hours, the people of Con
necticut are paying final respects
to the woman who became the first
female U.S. governor elected
without following her husband into
office when she won the gov
ernorship in 1974.
Grasso,a two-term governor, re
signed Dec. 4 because her illness
was draining her of the strength
and stamina needed to perform her
duties.
Grasso underwent surgery last
April, and it was later disclosed
that doctors had found cancer.
However after eight weeks of radi
ation therapy, physicians said she
was free of all signs of the disease.
But in December, she entered the
hospital again and the doctors
found that the cancer had reached
her liver.
Grasso died Thursday of com
plications resulting from the

cancer. She was 61. She had been
reported in critical condition Feb. 1
after becoming semi-comatose.
The turn for the worse had followed
a good week, and physicians had
planned additional chemotherapy
in an effort to arrest the cancer
that had spread through her liver.
