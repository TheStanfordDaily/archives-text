## Reagan reform: not 'business-as-usual' Struggle expected for new budget 
### Washington Post 
Washington — David Stock
man's big black book of budget
cuts, 145 pages of numbers and
fine print, makes tangible what
official Washington was already
beginning to grasp: the Reagan
crusade for federal reform is
not business-as-usual. It prom
ises, instead, to produce a year
of epic political struggle unlike
anything seen before in modern
Washington.
When President Ronald Rea
gan presents his detailed eco
nomic proposals Feb. 18, the
struggle will begin in earnest. In
the meantime, the budget-cut
ting prospectus prepared by
budget director Stockman and

obtained Saturday by The
Washington Post will be the
best-read official document in
the capital, widely circulated
and scrutinized in Congress and
in lobbyists' offices.
Tne sum of its details is
breath-taking: enormous reduc
tions proposed for long-familiar
and popular federal programs.
Stockman proposes to cut
scores of billions. In some cases
he would cut the benefits that
significant elements of the pop
ulation depend on for their sur
vival.
In the first days of his presi
dency Reagan has apparently
settled easily into the idea of
fighting this radical crusade,

which in fact is closer to the
apocalyptic rhetoric of his early
political career than the
soothing reassurances of last
year's presidential campaign.
Candidate Reagan often seemed
to be saying that the only thing
that had to be cut was federal
taxes in order to restore the
country's economic well-being.
Now President Reagan predicts
"an economic calamity of tre
mendous proportions" unless
radical surgery is performed on
the federal budget.
But the budget process takes
Congress most of the year to
complete, and it is beyond the
power of the White House to ac
celerate that schedule. Reagan
can win some quick skirmishes,
for example in his effort to re
duce the current budget by
about $14 billion, but the truly
revolutionary cuts he seeks in
fiscal 1982 and beyond won't be
voted on until much later.
This unavoidable delay will
give the special-interest groups
— ample time to mobilize their
political forces to try to frus

trate the administration's pro
posed cuts.
The outcome of this contest
remains unpredictable, not
least because unforeseeable
events can easily prove de
cisive. For example, the White
House is hoping to keep national
attention focused on the budget
issue until it is resolved, but an
international crisis — a Soviet
invasion of Poland, say — could
distract both the country and
the White House, opening up
new maneuvering room to the
interest groups.
But there is widespread,
agreement on this point: Rea
gan seems to have an opportuni
ty for success that his predeces
sors lacked, a sense of political
readiness and nervousness that
simply was not present in pre
vious seasons of much-heralded
budget cutting. Two dozen in
terviews with White House of
ficials, members of both houses
of Congress and professional
lobbyists suggest both why Rea
gan could win his crusade, and
what might tear it apart.
