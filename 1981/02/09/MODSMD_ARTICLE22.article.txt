# Hayakawa calls pact 'cowardly'
## Senator assails deal 
### Los Angeles Times 
Sacramento,' Calif. — The
United States should renege on
its agreement negotiated with
Iran to gain the release of the
American hostages, Sen. S.I.
Hayakawa (R-Calif.) said Sat
urday, because to honor the pact
would "clearly reveal us as
being timid, cowardly and
pusillanimous."
Specifically, the United
States should "throw away the
portion of the agreement calling
for a resumption of trade, cast
away the prohibition against the
hostages making claims against
Iran for their physical and psy
chological damages and for
their loss of property, and forget
about helping the Iranians re
cover the shah's assets," the
senator said in remarks pre
pared for the Republican State
Convention banquet.
Although President Ronald
Reagan already has said he in
tends to honor the terms of the
agreement negotiated to win the
release of the 52 American
hostages, Hayakawa said as a
member,# the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, "I don'^

like it.
"As far as I'm concerned,
honor has no place in dealing
with terrorists. If we fulfill the
remainder of the terms of this
agreement, we dignify these
crimes, we accept the guilt for
them and we pay the price.
"Where is there honor in
that?"
The tone of the pact makes
the United States the "villain"
and the Iranians "the abused,"
Hayakawa said. Iran has yet to
admit its responsibility in the
kidnapping, he said, and former
President Carter "bungled" the
negotiations.
"I strongly believe that ran
som has been agreed to and will
be paid to Iran if we fulfill the
terms of this agreement," he
said, despite assurances by both
Carter and Reagan that ransom
is not being paid.
The senator's denunciation of
the pact came in a speech de
signed to win him support in his
bid for re-election next year.
"I intend to run for re-elec
tion in 1982 and I intend to win,"
Hayakawa said. "I am not ask
ing for your support. I intend to
earn it."
