# Haig policies: attempted 'power grab'?
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig, in his first two weeks in of
fice, has made long strides toward
achieving the position he seeks as chief
formulator and administrator of Ameri
can foreign policy in the Reagan admin
istration. But despite fancy footwork,
Haig's bureaucratic maneuvering ex
posed vulnerabilities as well as
strengths.
As foreshadowed by his past ex
perience and pre-inaugural statements,
Haig came on fast and strong to carve
out the central role in America's diplo
matic, military and economic relations
with the rest of the world. It was so fast
and so strong, however, that storm sig
nals were immediately raised in the Rea
gan inner circle, especially among mem
bers of the senior White House staff.
The White House declined to endorse
directives proposed by the secretary of

state in the early hours of the new admin
istration giving him the dominant role in
foreign policy making of all sorts. One
senior official described the proposed
directives bluntly as an attempted
"power grab."
Haig's responses were deft:
— Without the directives, he went
ahead to convene interagency meetings
on a host of foreign policy issues in every
region of the world. Other agencies sent
representatives, lest they be left out of
the action. Their attendance ratified the
authority of the State Department to
create and preside over the policy groups
on an interim basis.
— In public pronouncements, especial
ly his news conference of Jan. 28, Haig
continued to assert his primacy over pol
icy. In public as well as in private, Haig
traced his authority to a "mandate" of
fered by Reagan along with the job of

secretary of state.
— In meetings with his Cabinet coun
terpart, Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, Haig negotiated a jointly
approved version of the directives that
previously were rejected in the White
House. These negotiations are reported
to have been completed at a State De
partment breakfast of the two Cabinet
officers last Friday. The revised direc
tives are being sent to the White House
for Reagan's approval.
White House approval of the Haig pro
posals, now the Haig-Weinberger pro
posals, is expected but it is not certain.
Haig's maneuvers to establish a sweep
ing policy-making writ, plus his quick
and forceful counterattack against the
foreign aid slashes proposed by budget
director David Stockman, raised the
hackles of some of the Reagan insiders.
These sources, by the way, predict that
the final budgetary totals for the aid pro
gram will be closer to Stockman's num

bers than to Haig's.
Under the rubric of "Cabinet govern
ment," the policy formulation proposals
would give the central role to interagen
cy committees, most of which are
chaired by the State Department. The
policy options created by these groups
would flow upward to the Cabinet-level
meetings of the National Security Coun
cil, including Reagan himself, for dis
cussion and final approval. This is no
mere formality, for Reagan has foreign
policy ideas of his own.
As Haig informed his senior staff at
Foggy Bottom, under this system the
State Department, rather than the staff
of the National Security Council, will
have the major role in policy coordi
nation beneath the Cabinet level. And as
any bureaucrat knows, those below who
draft the assessments and carve out the
options usually have more influence on
policy than those at the top who make the
final choices.
