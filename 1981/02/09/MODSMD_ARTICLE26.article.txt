# No. 1 Beavers hang on
## Cards beat Ducks, lose heartbreaker to OSU 
### Chris Haft 
Several things happened this past weekend at
Maples Pavilion that usually don't occur there,
making for two surprising and invigorating evenings
of men's basketball.
After all, how often does Stanford win on a under
hand double-pump lay-in in the final seconds? In
deed, a Cardinal victory is shocking enough. But this
was the case Friday night as Doug Marty's play
ground shot gave Stanford an 80-79 victory over Ore
gon.
And how often does a sellout crowd noisily rock
Maples? Since when has Stanford played well
enough to nearly defeat the nation's top-ranked
team? How frequently this season have the Cards,
one of the country's best free-throw shooting teams,
displayed costly inaccuracy from the charity
stripe? Answers: seldom, many moons ago. and
rarely. But these phenomena occurred Saturday
evening in the Cards' 62-57 loss to Oregon State.
Stanford now owns a 3-8 Pacific-10 Conference
mark — good for a seventh-place tie with Oregon
and California — and a 7-12 record overall. These
dismal figures, however, were forgotten in this past
weekend's excitement.
No slaughter
Most of the 8000 fans packing Maples to see OSU
and Stanford probably shared the mentality of the
Romans who used to watch the Christians in the
lion's den in bygone days. Yet this time, the beasts
had a little trouble devouring the humans.
After forging two first-half ties, the Cards never
trailed by more than seven points thereafter. With
1:16 to go. OSU led by only 55-51. The Beavers' five
point margin of victory was their second narrowest
of the season.
"I think we played very hard and gave a sustained
effort for 40 minutes," Stanford head coach Dick
Dißiaso said. "We can be very proud of the fact that
we played the best team in the country down to the
final minute. . .We played close to our maximum to
night."
The Beavers, ranked No. 1 by UPI and No. 2 by
AP, required a maximum shooting effort in the sec

ond half to retain their unblemished record (11-0 in
conference, 19-0 overall). OSU fended off the Cards
by connecting on a remarkable 73.9 percent (17-
of-23) of its second-half shots.
Mark Radford accounted for much of this ac
curacy, sinking nine of 12 shots and scoring 21 points,
all after halftime. The 6-foot-4 senior guard made
everyone forget about his scoreless first half by
pumping in 15 of OSU's first 21 points following in
termission.
"I knew we were struggling, but 1 just got fired up
and shot with no hesitation, and that's when I shoot a
good percentage," Radford said.
Revelli, Wichary star
Two Cards in particular also shot well, keeping
the score close throughout. John Revelli, who scored
a team-high 20 points, helped lead Stanford from an
early 12-3 deficit to a 15-15 tie with 8:42 left in the
half by notching eight of 12 points during the Cards'
resurgence.
Hans Wichary partially offset Radford's bombing
with some ground-to-air missiles of his own, collect
ing seven baskets in eight tries on his way to a col
legiate career-high 16 points, 14 in the second half.
Lanky folk like Wichary don't usually shoot from
outside, but the 6-foot-9 freshman showed that he
feels at home where smaller men range. Four of
Wichary's hoops came from beyond 16 feet, includ
ing a 25-foot rocket at the final buzzer.
Strong OSU finish
One of Wichary's buckets, a 16-foot baseliner over
6-foot-lO Steve Johnson, narrowed OSU's lead to
43-41 with 7:23 remaining.
Then OSU displayed the mettle characteristic of
top-ranked teams. Reserve forward Rob Holbrook
sank two shots from the top of the key, extending the
Beavers' advantage to 47-41. Five times afterward
Stanford cut the difference to four, but the orange
clad men from Corvallis staunchly held on.
The game might not have been so close had John
son given his usual effort. The senior center, who
had been averaging 20.9 points and shooting 76.1 per
cent fromthe floor, took only three shots and scored

just six points.
Three other people also performed ineffectively
— officials Ron Labetich, Charles Range and Jerry
White. On two doubtful calls, they disallowed
baskets by Keith Jones and Marty, ruling that they
had charged before scoring.
Johnson summed up the officiating in a single
word: "Poor."
Poor also described the Cards' 11-for-20 free
throw shooting, hardly characteristic of the group
leading the Pac-10 and ranking fifth in the nation in
that category. Revelli, a 79.5 free-throw shooter, hit
only six of 10. Jones, a 78.1 marksman, missed both
of his one-point attempts.
Marty's winner
The Cards doubtlessly slept well after Friday
night's triumph, though the game's final two
minutes were a nightmare.
Oregon fought back from a 76-69 deficit with a lit
tle more than two minutes left to take a 79-78 lead on
Felton Sealey's two free throws with 10 seconds left.
Two Stanford turnovers and a missed dunk by
Wichary helped fuel the Ducks' comeback.
After Sealey's free throws, the Cards called time
out. "All we wanted. . . whether they were in zone or
man-to-man. was for Doug Marty to bring the ball
upcourt with Keith (Jones) and Peter (Lallas) on
the wings, and we would take a jump shot at the end
if we couldn't get a layup," Dißiaso said.
What actually happened was Marty's dribbling
downcourt, angling right, cutting into the middle of
the key, rising for a lay-in between guard Fred
Cofield and another Duck and pumping once before
finally releasing a underhand scoop shot. The ball
rolled around the rim and trickled in two seconds
before the buzzer sounded.
"It was totally improvised," Marty said. "I got
between two guys and I knew I had to get in the
air. . .1 pumped it to get momentum."
Lallas, who scored 14 points, also made some im
portant shots, hitting three straight baskets to give
Stanford its brief 76-69 lead. Also, Revelli tied his
Stanford career high with 23 points, 10 of those com
ing shortly after intermission.

Three other people also performed ineffectively
— officials Ron Labetich, Charles Range and Jerry
White. On two doubtful calls, they disallowed
baskets by Keith Jones and Marty, ruling that they
had charged before scoring.
Johnson summed up the officiating in a single
word: "Poor."
Poor also described the Cards' 11-for-20 free
throw shooting, hardly characteristic of the group
leading the Pac-10 and ranking fifth in the nation in
that category. Revelli, a 79.5 free-throw shooter, hit
only six of 10. Jones, a 78.1 marksman, missed both
of his one-point attempts.
Marty's winner
The Cards doubtlessly slept well after Friday
night's triumph, though the game's final two
minutes were a nightmare.
Oregon fought back from a 76-69 deficit with a lit
tle more than two minutes left to take a 79-78 lead on
Felton Sealey's two free throws with 10 seconds left.
Two Stanford turnovers and a missed dunk by
Wichary helped fuel the Ducks' comeback.
After Sealey's free throws, the Cards called time
out. "All we wanted. . . whether they were in zone or
man-to-man. was for Doug Marty to bring the ball
upcourt with Keith (Jones) and Peter (Lallas) on
the wings, and we would take a jump shot at the end
if we couldn't get a layup," Dißiaso said.
What actually happened was Marty's dribbling
downcourt, angling right, cutting into the middle of
the key, rising for a lay-in between guard Fred
Cofield and another Duck and pumping once before
finally releasing a underhand scoop shot. The ball
rolled around the rim and trickled in two seconds
before the buzzer sounded.
"It was totally improvised," Marty said. "I got
between two guys and I knew I had to get in the
air. . .1 pumped it to get momentum."
Lallas, who scored 14 points, also made some im
portant shots, hitting three straight baskets to give
Stanford its brief 76-69 lead. Also, Revelli tied his
Stanford career high with 23 points, 10 of those com
ing shortly after intermission.

Stanford center John Revelli played a big hand in tne Cardinals'
basketball fortunes this weekend. He had 23 points against Oregon
and tossed in 20 markers the next night against OSU.
Several things happened this past weekend at
Maples Pavilion that usually don't occur there,
making for two surprising and invigorating evenings
of men's basketball.
After all, how often does Stanford win on a under
hand double-pump lay-in in the final seconds? In
deed, a Cardinal victory is shocking enough. But this
was the case Friday night as Doug Marty's play
ground shot gave Stanford an 80-79 victory over Ore
gon.
And how often does a sellout crowd noisily rock
Maples? Since when has Stanford played well
enough to nearly defeat the nation's top-ranked
team? How frequently this season have the Cards,
one of the country's best free-throw shooting teams,
displayed costly inaccuracy from the charity
stripe? Answers: seldom, many moons ago. and
rarely. But these phenomena occurred Saturday
evening in the Cards' 62-57 loss to Oregon State.
Stanford now owns a 3-8 Pacific-10 Conference
mark — good for a seventh-place tie with Oregon
and California — and a 7-12 record overall. These
dismal figures, however, were forgotten in this past
weekend's excitement.
No slaughter
Most of the 8000 fans packing Maples to see OSU
and Stanford probably shared the mentality of the
Romans who used to watch the Christians in the
lion's den in bygone days. Yet this time, the beasts
had a little trouble devouring the humans.
After forging two first-half ties, the Cards never
trailed by more than seven points thereafter. With
1:16 to go. OSU led by only 55-51. The Beavers' five
point margin of victory was their second narrowest
of the season.
"I think we played very hard and gave a sustained
effort for 40 minutes," Stanford head coach Dick
Dißiaso said. "We can be very proud of the fact that
we played the best team in the country down to the
final minute. . .We played close to our maximum to
night."
The Beavers, ranked No. 1 by UPI and No. 2 by
AP, required a maximum shooting effort in the sec

ond half to retain their unblemished record (11-0 in
conference, 19-0 overall). OSU fended off the Cards
by connecting on a remarkable 73.9 percent (17-
of-23) of its second-half shots.
Mark Radford accounted for much of this ac
curacy, sinking nine of 12 shots and scoring 21 points,
all after halftime. The 6-foot-4 senior guard made
everyone forget about his scoreless first half by
pumping in 15 of OSU's first 21 points following in
termission.
"I knew we were struggling, but 1 just got fired up
and shot with no hesitation, and that's when I shoot a
good percentage," Radford said.
Revelli, Wichary star
Two Cards in particular also shot well, keeping
the score close throughout. John Revelli, who scored
a team-high 20 points, helped lead Stanford from an
early 12-3 deficit to a 15-15 tie with 8:42 left in the
half by notching eight of 12 points during the Cards'
resurgence.
Hans Wichary partially offset Radford's bombing
with some ground-to-air missiles of his own, collect
ing seven baskets in eight tries on his way to a col
legiate career-high 16 points, 14 in the second half.
Lanky folk like Wichary don't usually shoot from
outside, but the 6-foot-9 freshman showed that he
feels at home where smaller men range. Four of
Wichary's hoops came from beyond 16 feet, includ
ing a 25-foot rocket at the final buzzer.
Strong OSU finish
One of Wichary's buckets, a 16-foot baseliner over
6-foot-lO Steve Johnson, narrowed OSU's lead to
43-41 with 7:23 remaining.
Then OSU displayed the mettle characteristic of
top-ranked teams. Reserve forward Rob Holbrook
sank two shots from the top of the key, extending the
Beavers' advantage to 47-41. Five times afterward
Stanford cut the difference to four, but the orange
clad men from Corvallis staunchly held on.
The game might not have been so close had John
son given his usual effort. The senior center, who
had been averaging 20.9 points and shooting 76.1 per
cent fromthe floor, took only three shots and scored

just six points.
Three other people also performed ineffectively
— officials Ron Labetich, Charles Range and Jerry
White. On two doubtful calls, they disallowed
