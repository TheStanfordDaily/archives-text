# Homers spark win
## SPORTS 
### Ralph Walker 
The Stanford baseball team
proved this weekend that its
mound staff is indeed com
prised of mortals, who occasion
ally need offensive backing to
win.
The Cards had given up only
one run in their first four games,
and although the pitching staff
continued to deliver solid per
formances, it was the offense
that played the key role in Fri
day's win over Nevada-Reno.
Stanford scored nine runs on ten
hits on the afternoon, en route to
a 9-6 come-from-behind victory.

The Cardinals trailed 6-3 in
the seventh inning when they ex
ploded for six runs. The outburst
was highlighted by catcher Bill
Worden's three-run homer, his
first tater of the year. It put the
Cards ahead to stay. Worden
was fourth in the Pac-10 last
year with 12 round trippers.
Centerfielder Mike Tooth
man, who continues to wield a
hot piece of aluminum, was also
instrumental in the victory. He
connected for three hits in four
at-bats, including a triple and
his second home run of the year,
a solo shot that tied the game at

3-3 in the third.
"Mike was by far the best
player during fall ball," stated
head coach Mark Marquess, in
reaction to Toothman's sparkl
ing play so far this season. "For
him, this is just a continuation
of the pre-season practices."
Steve Cottrell, a freshman
from Northridge who played
quarterback on the football
team behind John Elway and
Phil Wilson, picked up his first

victory of the young season
against Reno. Cottrell hurled
four strong innings in relief of
starter Brian Mignano, allow
ing only one earned run on two
hits.
Stanford's next game will be
Tuesday at 2:30 when they will
play host to San Francisco State
at Sunken Diamond. Paul
Grame (2-0), who threw a no
hitter in his last outing against
Hayward State, is scheduled to
start for the Cards.
