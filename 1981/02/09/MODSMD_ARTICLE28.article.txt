# Gymnasts perform well but lose
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's gymnasts proved to be
"roads" scholars this weekend, compiling
several record-breaking individual per
formances on the road in Oregon. Un
fortunately, a shortage of healthy bodies
prevented the Cardinals from turning fine
individual efforts into team victories.
In terms of team showings, the Stanford
squads dropped three of four close, hard
fought meets up north and once again pro
vided the bittersweet taste of their potential
— cheering team members and coaches
with what was accomplished while disap
pointing them with what might have been if
it weren't for injuries.
Both Duck teams posted victories over
the Cards Friday. Sadao Hamada's men fell
short by a 274.60 to 251.55 margin while
Jackie Walker's women suffered a dis
heartening 137.50 to 136.05 defeat.
Hamada was "expecting a high-scoring
performance" from his team, and but for an

untimely knee injury to Jim Campanelli in
the first event, the Cards would have lived
up to that goal. Despite hurting his right
knee, Campanelli completed his floor ex
ercise routine, helping Stanford to record
its highest team score (44.85) in that event
this season, and entered the pommel horse
and rings. His determination in floor was re
warded by a 9.25 score and Hamada said
with obvious disappointment that he was
"looking really good last week and super in
warm-ups."
Mike Lee tallied 53.55 points in all-around
competition, good for second place, and
Hamada praised the showing of Jeff Chung,
who filled in for a less-than-healthy Brian
Nelson in all-around. Chung earned 47.75
points and his top performances included a
9.05 judging on rings and an 8.75 effort in
floor exercise.
Despite an injury which forced number
two gymnast Karen Hall out of competition,
the 1.45 point loss to Oregon was one of the

best performances by Stanford's women
gymnasts. Merilyn Chapman's 36.55 all
around score, an average of 9.0 or better per
event, set a Card record, breaking Hall's
36.50 mark, and topped all other com
petitors.
Saturday night in Corvallis the women
came up short against sixth-ranked Oregon
State, 145.85 to 135.45, a remarkable per
formance considering they were without
Hall and had lost Smith with a reinjured
ankle.
The Beavers' Mary Ayotte took all
around honors with 37.35, the second highest
total in the country this season, followed by
Chapman's 36.80 showing which broke the
Stanford record and was the eighth-highest
mark in the nation so far.
The lone team victory for the Cards was
recorded by the men Saturday afternoon in
a one-sided affair with Portland State. Stan
ford won handily, 248.90 to 221.15 and Lee's
53.70 all-around total was his highest ever.
