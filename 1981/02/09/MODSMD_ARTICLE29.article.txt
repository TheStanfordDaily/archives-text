### Bill Beyda 
The San Jose State Spartans
women's basketball team beat
the Stanford Cardinals 61-49 at
San Jose Saturday night, possi
bly eliminating the Cards as re
gional hopefuls.
Before the game, Cardinals
coach Dotty McCrea said, "We
have to play with the same in
tensity as we did against UOP.
If we can do that, and control the
backboards, we'll beat
them."lntensity as well as ac
curate shooting were un
fortunately lacking Saturday
night. The Cards shot a dismal
32.1 percent from the field. Lou
ise Smith, usually a potent scor
ing threat, scored only 8 points,
and Anne Miller, known for her
deadly outside shot, didn't score
at all. Kim Kupferer led the
Cardinal list with 23 points.
Spartan coach Sharon Chat
man said after the game, "Stan
ford is the best perimeter shoot
ing team in the league. We knew
this, and planned our defense
accordingly, and it worked. It
was one of our best efforts of the

year.
The Cards played evenly with
the Spartans in the second half,
with each team scoring 25
points. The difference came in
the first half when the Spartans
scored 9 unanswered points in
four minutes; Stanford was un
able to recover. All of the Cards'
recent losses have occurred this
way.
"We turned the ball over too
much," McCrea said,"and we
didn't score points when we
needed to."
The loss stopped a Cardinal
winning streak that was leading
them to a possible regional
berth. The loss gives the Cards a
12-12 overall record, and a 3-5
conference record. It should be
noted that the Cards played one
of the toughest pre-conference
schedules in the league. Accord
ing to Chapman,"if they win the
rest of their conference games,
and our conference gets a third
regional berth, Stanford would
be the team to go."

The Cards play road games at
Oregon, Oregon State, Idaho,
and California before returning
to Maples Pavillion on February
24.

The San Jose State Spartans
women's basketball team beat
the Stanford Cardinals 61-49 at
San Jose Saturday night, possi
bly eliminating the Cards as re
gional hopefuls.
Before the game, Cardinals
coach Dotty McCrea said, "We
have to play with the same in
tensity as we did against UOP.
If we can do that, and control the
backboards, we'll beat
them."lntensity as well as ac
curate shooting were un
fortunately lacking Saturday
night. The Cards shot a dismal
32.1 percent from the field. Lou
ise Smith, usually a potent scor
ing threat, scored only 8 points,
and Anne Miller, known for her
deadly outside shot, didn't score
at all. Kim Kupferer led the
Cardinal list with 23 points.
Spartan coach Sharon Chat
man said after the game, "Stan
ford is the best perimeter shoot
ing team in the league. We knew
this, and planned our defense
accordingly, and it worked. It
was one of our best efforts of the

year.
The Cards played evenly with
the Spartans in the second half,
with each team scoring 25
points. The difference came in
the first half when the Spartans
scored 9 unanswered points in
four minutes; Stanford was un
able to recover. All of the Cards'
recent losses have occurred this
way.
"We turned the ball over too
much," McCrea said,"and we
didn't score points when we
needed to."
The loss stopped a Cardinal
winning streak that was leading
them to a possible regional
berth. The loss gives the Cards a
12-12 overall record, and a 3-5
conference record. It should be
noted that the Cards played one
of the toughest pre-conference
schedules in the league. Accord
ing to Chapman,"if they win the
rest of their conference games,
and our conference gets a third
regional berth, Stanford would
be the team to go."

The Cards play road games at
Oregon, Oregon State, Idaho,
and California before returning
to Maples Pavillion on February
24.
