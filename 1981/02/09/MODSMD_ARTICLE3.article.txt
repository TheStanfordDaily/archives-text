# Solidarity to consider more strikes
## General strike called in Polish city today 
### 
Warsaw, Poland (AP) â€” Workers in
the southwestern city of Jelenia Gora
yesterday called a general strike and
national leaders of the independent
union Solidarity met there to discuss
the possible spread of strikes to
nearby cities.
The strike, set to begin today, and
the promise of support from union
leaders in the region came as the Com
munist Party's Central Committee
prepares to meet during the week. A
Supreme Court ruling on an independ
ent farmers union and the opening of
the Polish Parliament are also to take
place this week.
And the state news agency PAP said
yesterday that officials investigating
the dissident Committee for Social-
Self Defense, known as KOR, had
found the organization was trying to
undermine Poland and its communist
allies and was aided by foreign "politi
cal subversion centers."
Announcement of the government
investigation suggested a new,
tougher stance on dissidents. KOR
members have been advising Solidar
ity, which was formed last summer
during a nationwide wave of strikes.
Last week, Warsaw Radio reported
members of a group called the Con
federation of Independent Poland also
were under investigation. The group's
leader, Leszek Moczulski, and six of
his associates are being held by au
thorities for trying to weaken Poland
"by bringing about social tension
jeopardizing the country's security
and public order," the radio said.
A critical move in Poland's labor
turmoil is expected tomorrow when
the Supreme Court is scheduled to con
sider a proposed union of independent
farmers, who own 75 percent of Po
land's farmland and produce 80 per
cent of its food.
The court has been studying the
farmers bid for registration of "Rural
Solidarity" since Dec. 30 when the
farmers appealed an earlier lower
court ruling denying the charter. Soli

darity backs the farmers, but it is un
clear if it would strike if the court re
jects the farmers' application.
Meanwhile a Solidarity spokesman
from Walbrzych, 25 miles southeast of
Jelenia Gora, said miners in the re
gion had postponed a strike call for
tomorrow by one day. The miners,
seeking five-day workweeks for all
employees in the industry in addition
to laborers, are to meet with govern
ment negotiators today in Katowice,
center of Poland's coal-mining region.
Walesa met union delegates from
regional Solidarity chapters and some
members of the union's national com
mission after arriving in Jelenia Gora
earlier in the day. A Solidarity spokes
man reached by telephone said Walesa
spoke to about 200 workers gathered in
a meeting hall.
In addition to discussing the Jelenia
Gora protest, the delegates were ex
pected to consider strike threats in
nearby cities including Glogow,
Lubin, Walbrzych, Wroclaw, Zielona
Gora and Legnica if talks with govern
ment negotiators in Jelenia Gora fail.
The Solidarity negotiators came to
Jelenia Gora from Bielsko-Biala,
where an 11-day protest ended Friday.
It had been the longest labor protest
since last summer's nationwide
strikes, which ended with government
agreement to formation of the inde
pendent union Solidarity that now
claims some 10 million members.
Warsaw radio reported that Solidar
ity officials were studying a govern
ment proposal to end the deadlocked
talks in Jelenia Gora.
Government negotiators had of
fered a possible solution to worker de
mands that the local health service
gain control of a resort and clinic used
exclusively by party and government
officials, the radio reported. It did not
elaborate.
Earlier, a Solidarity spokesman in
Jelenia Gora said a government nego
tiator had reiterated a tough position
against the workers demand for the

two buildings.
There was no radio comment on oth
er worker demands for the dismissal
of Trade Union Minister Stanislaw
Ciosek, the local party secretary be
tween 1975 and 1980, and other local of
ficials.
Today's strike would coincide with
a meeting of the Polish Communist
Party Central Committee, which is

expected to discuss the labor crisis.
At its last meeting in early Decem
ber, the committee purged four mem
bers of the Politburo including as
sociates of deposed party First Secre
tary Edward Gierek who was ousted
in September, and added two new
members, including Mieczyslaw
Moczar, who is widely regarded as a
rising star in the party hierarchy.
