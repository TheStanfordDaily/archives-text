Stanford spirit shined Satur
day as the Cardinal men 's swim
ming team defeated arch-rival
USC for the first time in eleven
years.
The LSJUMB, the Dollies,
and hundreds of enthusiastic
fans gathered at deGuerre pool
to witness the upset. Stanford
head coach Skip Kenney praised
the crowd and the band for their
avid support, citing it as the
greatest example of home pool
advantage that he had ever ex
perienced. "If I could have, I
would've personally thanked
each and every one who came,"
he said.
The Stanford swimmers pre
pared well for the Trojans, and
it showed. The team worked to
gether as a group, giving each
other the spirit and support nec
essary to win. According to
coach Kenney, "It was the
greatest team effort I've ever
been associated with, at any
level."
Distance man Bari Weick and
backstroker Wade Flemons

were particularly impressive.
They finished their events with
times rated as the best in the na
tion thus far this season. Weick
won the 1000-yard freestyle with
a time of 9:00.73, breaking both
the pool and meet records, as
well as the previous Stanford
top mark. Olympian Dave Sims
placed second with the, third
fastest time in the nation this
year, 9:07.45.
Flemons swam the 200-meter
backstroke in a blazing 1:49.3,
which also broke the pool and
meet records in that event.
Freshman Sam Worden
swept the short distance sprints
by winning the 50-yard freestyle
with a time of 20.8 and beating
NCAA champ Chris Cavanaugh
of USC in the 100-yard free with
a clocking of 45.40.
The combined efforts of
Weick and Sims racked up
points for Stanford in the dis
tance events. Besides placing
first and second in the 1000-yard
freestyle, Weick and Sims re
peated their performances in
the 500-yard free. Dave Sims

had an outstanding finish as he
pulled up from third place to nab
second behind USC's Jeff Float
in the last length.
Another excellent per
formance was given by the 400
medley relay team of Worden
and freshman â€¢ Mark Michaels,
and juniors Flemons and Jim
Jiminez.
One of the greatest contribu
tions to the Stanford win came
from the Cardinal divers.
Spence Rogers and Bryan Mc-
Cleve placed first in the three
meter and the one-meter diving
competitions, respectively,
leading the way for a complete
Stanford sweep in the diving
competition.
The women's swimming and
diving team also defeated the
Trojans, by a similar score of
77-45. According to coach Ken
ney, "they won pretty handily.'
Standouts of the meet included
sophmore backstroker Kim
Carlisle, and freshman distan
ces Sherri Hanna and Anne
Tweedy.
