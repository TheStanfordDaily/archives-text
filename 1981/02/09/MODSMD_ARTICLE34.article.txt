Review may delay money for Iran
Washington — The United States may not be able to
make the next deadline set by the Iranian hostage release
agreement, sources inside and outside government
warned Saturday.
It provided for the establishment, by Feb. 19, of an ac
count in the Bank of England that over the next six months
would receive $1 billion of now-frozen Iranian deposits
held in American banks' domestic branches.
This account would be used to pay off Americans whose
claims against Iran would have been upheld by the interna
tional claims commission that is to be established under
terms of the agreement.
The cause of the delay, sources agreed, would be the de
tailed legal review the Reagan administration is giving
the complex multibillion-dollar deal, completed in the
closing hours of the Carter presidency.
Sources could not say Saturday exactly when the Rea
gan-ordered review would be completed. But they con
tinued to emphasize administration statements that the
agreement would be honored consistent with international
and American law.
A further indication the Reagan review might push past
the deadline is that the Justice Department has asked that
legal action in the more than 300 claims cases against Iran
in U.S. courts be delayed until Feb 26.
However, while the Reagan officials carry on their
study of the Iranian hostage agreement, American
bankers, with Treasury Department approval, were re
ported Saturday to be flying to London to begin discussion
today with representatives of the Iranian Central Bank on
distribution of a $1.4 billion escrow account controlled by
Algeria.
Burger attacks correction system
Houston — Chief Justice Warren Burger yesterday at
tacked the nation's justice system, its schools and its pris
onsfor helping to make Americans "hostages" to crime.
"Like it or not," he said in his annual State of the Judi
ciary address to the American Bar Assocation, "today we
are approaching the status of an impotent society — whose
capability of maintaining elementary security on the
streets, in schools and in the homes of our people is in
doubt."
Burger said the legal system now provides too much
protection for the accused and too little for the victims of
crime. He called for new restrictions on access to the
courts for convicted criminals trying to get out of jail, and
greater leeway for judges to lock up potentially dangerous
defendants who have not been convicted.
He blamed the schools for at least part of the crime
problem because they have "virtually eliminated . . any
effort to teach values of integrity, truth, personal accoun
tability, respect for others' rights."
And he called for a "broad-scale" physical rehabilita
tion of prisons to provide "a decent setting" for education,

training and counseling programs.
Though Burger has touched on all these themes before,
the speech was his broadest and most vehement on the sub
ject of crime. It sounded at times, as many commented,
like a conservative Republican stump speech worthy of a
man running for office. Burger has been working on the
speech for seven months and is believed to consider it the
start of a major push for changes in the system, beyond
what he can do in Supreme Court opinions.
Specifically, Burger challenged the process by which
convicted criminals spend years filing habeas corpus peti
tions. suing prison wardens and parole boards and trying
to get new trials by citing minor errors in the first trial or
arrest. Once a person has been convicted and has ex
hausted the first round of appeals, Burger said, all later
judicial review should be confined to past "miscarriages
of justice."
"Our search for justice must not be twisted into a search
for technical errors to guilt or innocence," he said. "... A
true miscarriage of justice, whether 20. 30 or 40 years old,
should always be open to judicial review, but the judicial
process becomes a mockery, a mockery of justice, if it is
forever open to appeals and retrials for errors in the ar
rest. the search or the trial."
He also criticized the current bail laws that forbid
judges from considering a defendant's future danger
ousness when setting bail. "The crucial element of future
dangerousness. based on a combination of the particular
crime, the past record and the evidence before the court,"
should be restored to deter the "startling amount of crime
committed by persons on release awaiting trial," Burger
said.
He also repeated recommendations he has made before
for improving the prisons by making vocational and educa
tional programs mandatory and giving good-time credit
when a prisoner makes educational progress.
But he suggested that prisoners who spend all their time
with the jailhouse lawyer thinking up ways of challenging
their imprisonment will never accept rehabilitation while
incarcerated.
"Even while we struggle toward correction, education
and rehabilitation, our system encourages prisoners to
continue warfare with society. . . . How much chance do
you think there is of changing or rehabilitating a person
who is encouraged to keep up years of constant warfare
with society?"
Poll shows nation supports Reagan
Americans express overwhelming confidence in Ronald
Reagan's ability to be a good president, according to a na
tionwide Newsday poll, but sizable minorities believe that
in the near future the country is likely to become involved
in a war overseas and to be torn by increased racial vio
lence at home.
Although the public — and even most Democrats — says
they think that Reagan will do a good job, the survey found
substantial disagreement with many of the positions he

has taken on important foreign and domestic issues.
The next few months may tell whether Reagan's person
ality and leadership can rally support for his programs or
if current confidence in him will erode substantially. To
measure such developments in the Reagan presidency, the
Newsday Poll plans to interview periodically this national
sample of 1848 adults and determine how and why their at
titudes change.
Few Iranians have left country
Fifteen months of all-out effort by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service resulted in the expulsion of only
slightly more than 1 percent of the almost 61,000 Iranian
students in the United States, federal officials say.
An immigration service spokeswoman said that 754
Iranian students have departed the country as a result of
the special registration and verification crackdown or
dered by the Carter administration after the takeover of
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979.
Deportation hearings are still proceeding against anoth
er 3008 Iranians, while 2887 who were facing expulsion
have applied for political asylum, postponing, at least for
the moment, their departure, the official said.
The results indicate the unwieldiness of the immigra
tion service as a political and diplomatic weapon, accord
ing to some critics of the crackdown.
"On a cost-effectiveness basis, it would have been a lot
cheaper to send these kids to the university than it was to
try and send them back to Iran," said David Carliner, a
prominent Washington immigration attorney and chair
man of the American Bar Association's immigration sec
tion.
"From what we have been able to gather, there were
fewer Iranian students departing the U.S. in the last year
than would have normally been the case," said Georgia
Stewart, director of information of the National Associa
tion for Foreign Student Affairs.
But, added Carliner and others, the crackdown may
have had the effect, perhaps unintended by the Carter ad
ministration, of defusing public outrage against Iranians
during the height of the hostage crisis.
Donovan fights off accusations
Newark, N.J. — Efforts by five Democratic senators to
reopen an FBI investigation of U.S. Labor Secretary Ray
mond Donovan's past business dealings are "politically
motivated and an attempt to embarrass the Reagan ad
ministration," Donovan's lawyer said yesterday.
The five Democratic members of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, citing "two serious inac
curacies" in the FBI inquiry, called Saturday for another
look at Donovan's role as vice president of the Schiavone
Construction Co. of Secaucus, N.J.
Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Claiborne
Pell of Rhode Island, Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, How
ard Metzenbaum of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan

said they sent their letter to committee chairman Sen. Or
rin Hatch (R-Utah) after The Record of Hackensack, N.J.,
gave them information raising questions about the thor
oughness of the FBl's investigation.
A spokesman for Hatch said his committee staff would
investigate the allegations.
The Record, in a copyright story in its Sunday editions,
quoted two men, both with past criminal associations, as
corroborating elements of the story told by Donovan s
chief accuser, mob informant Ralph Picardo.
Picardo has said Donovan made payoffs to organized
crime figures to insure labor peace and that his company
dealt with reputed mobsters.
Gasoline up 10 cents a gallon
Los Angeles — Gasoline prices have jumped an average
of 10 cents a gallon in major U.S. cities since the first of the
year, oil market analyst Dan Lundberg said yesterday.
Lundberg, in a telephone interview with The Associated
Press, said a nationwide survey he completed Saturday
night indicated that retail prices — which are the average
of all four grades of gasoline — climbed from an average
$1.22 to $1.32 a gallon nationwide since the first of the year.
National wholesale prices, he said, have increased from
98.40 cents to $1.08 since Jan. 1.
Lundberg said the increase reflected price hikes by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Pres
ident Reagan's decision to lift oil-price controls eight
months early.
He said his office had projected prices of $1.45 a gallon
by the end of year without decontrol and OPEC price in
creases, but "it looks like the end of the year will get here
sooner than we had thought."
Today's weather
Variable clouds with scattered showers today. Partial
clearing tonight then partly cloudy tomorrow. Lows in the
40s tonight. Highs in the 50s to low 60s. Chance of rain 40
percent.
