# Earth Resources open to undergrads New major to mix geology, econ
## 
### Todd Pickett 
Focusing on the need for business
minded geologists in the earth re
sources industries, the Applied Earth
Sciences Department has introduced a
major with a combined emphasis on
economics and geology.
The new major, called "Earth Re
sources," requires a minimum
number of actual geology courses in
order to include courses in economics,
industrial engineering, petroleum en
gineering and operations research,
which are not usually found in the two
other Earth Science majors.
The students who complete the
Earth Resources major will be urged
to pursue a graduate degree in busi
ness administration, said Irwin
Remson, chairman of the Geology De
partment. With a primary education
in business and a background in geolo
gy, students should enter the pro
fessional world with an understanding
of the economics of mining the earth's
non-renewable resources, he added.
"I don't think we should turn out ge
ologists for just technical use and
leave the big decisions to somebody
else," said Remson.
Business background
According to Remson, a person with
a background in business and geology
would be more qualified to assess the
advantages of mining ore in a certain
area.
"There's a desperate need for this
type of person in the resources in
dustry," said Remson. "The jobs are
there."

A three-unit course surveying the
methods and problems of mining the
earth's non-renewable resources will
introduce the major this spring. The
course, Earth Resources 1, will be
taught by guest speakers who will dis
cuss the political, economic and en
vironmental issues which surround
the development of the earth's re
sources.
Remson and Steve Gorelick, a post
doctoral scholar in the Earth Sciences
School, will begin the course by in
troducing essential concepts in geolo
gy and ecnomics, eliminating the need
for any prerequisites. In succeeding
weeks, various corporate executives
involved in the earth resources in
dustry and University professors will
speak on the exploration of fossil
fuels, metallic and nonmetallic mate
rials, as well as issues in nuclear
energy.
Participating lecturers include

Emeritus Prof. Charles Parks, re
sources economic consultant Hugh
Douglas, and Thomas Peaks, man
ager of the economic department of
Standard Oil Co. of California.
By bringing in experts to discuss
earth resources and energy. Remson
said he hopes to clarify the vast
number of opinions which have
evolved from all sides of energy is
sues.
In addition to the two lectures a
week, a section will be held to discuss
the speakers' lectures and to assess
any pro-industry viewpoints which
might influence the information pre
sented, said Remson. The course is
open to both science and non-science
majors.
Only four other schools in the nation
are known to have a major combining
business and geology. Stanford is the
only university to offer such a pro
gram to undergraduates.
