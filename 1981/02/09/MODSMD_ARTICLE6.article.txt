### Joan O'Connell 
Philosophy Dept. Chairman lan
Hacking was arrested outside his of
fice Saturday and charged with being
drunk and disorderly, battery on a po
lice officer and resisting arrest, ac
cording to Stanford Police Captain
Raoul Niemeyer.
Hacking, 45, was released on his
own recognizance without bail from
the North County jail in Palo Alto ear
ly yesterday morning.
Niemeyer told University officials
his department received a call about 4
p.m. Saturday that "someone in the
philosophy department apparently
needed medical attention."
Officers Brian Wax, Trudy Eitel
and Michael Quane were sent to the
scene, where Niemeyer said they
found all the downstairs offices
locked. Niemeyer said the officers
found 15 members of the Western
Philosophical Association meeting up
stairs; none had keys to the office.

Meanwhile one of the officers saw
through a glass door a man they later
learned was Hacking, lying face down
in a locked office downstairs.
Niemeyer gave this account:
"One officer pounded on the glass
and asked if the man needed help. The
reply was no. Then Hacking got up and
opened the door into the hallway,
pushed one officer in the chest with
both hands, took a swing at him and
began yelling and fighting.
"At this point the group upstairs
heard the disturbance, came down and
a woman and a man jumped the of
ficers. Then the woman leaped on an
officer's back and put an arm-lock
around his neck. Hacking was of
fensive and combative and it was an
ugly situation."
However, when the Daily spoke to
Philosophy Prof. Julius Moravcsik,
who was a member of the group meet
ing upstairs, a different account was
given, with Moravcsik saying there
was "no such group" as the Western
Philosophical Association.
"It was a get-together of the West
Coast Aristotelian Society. There
were nine members," he said.
Moravcsik declined comment on
Hacking's arrest, but said the mem
bers of the society came downstairs
when they heard the noise. Moravcsik
stated that no member of the group got
involved in any way with Hacking's ar
rest, or with the police officers mak
ing the arrest.
Niemeyer also said that before the
officers finally managed to get Hack
ing into the squad car, he kicked of
ficer Brian Wax three times and
"kicked the car door hard enough to
spring it."
Niemeyer was unavailable for
further comment yesterday, and Ser
geant Philip Love, who was called to
the scene of the incident for assistance
on Saturday, refused to supply any
further details of the arrest except to
say "the scene was cleared and no oth
er arrests were made." Love said
none of the other persons allegedly in
volved were detained or charged
Hacking said yesterday he had
"absolutely no comment" on the inci
dent, as did his Palo Alto attorney.
William Keogh.
Niemeyer said Hacking refused
normal booking procedures and
"finally agreed to cooperate and was
released at 1:40 a. m. on Sunday morn
ing " The district attorney's office
will review the case this morning.
Hacking came to Stanford in 1975
from Cambridge University.
