### Associated Press 
An Iranian court convicted jailed American writer Cyn
thia Dwyer on spying charges yesterday, sentenced her to
time already served and ordered her expelled. The State
Department said Dwyer would be released to Swiss au
thorities early today with her departure from Iran to fol
low shortly.
At his home in the Buffalo, N.Y., suburb of Amherst,
Dwyer's husband, John, said he felt "tremendous, grate
ful. thrilled, relieved" atnewsof the pending release of his
49-year-old wife, who has been held by the Iranians for nine
months and three days. Mrs. Dwyer denied the spying
charges at her trial last Wednesday, according to Iranian
press reports.
Dwyer said he and the couple's three children had no
word of his wife's travel plans.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita
Stockman said the plans would be determined by the fami
ly
The State Department had been informed that Iran
wanted Dwyer to leave the country immediately upon her
release, she said.
Dwyer, an occasional writer for Humanist magazine
who her husband says went to Iran to research the Iranian
revolution for free-lance articles she hoped to sell, was
convicted on four charges including indulging in acts of
espionage against the Islamic Republic of Iran," accord
ing to Iran's official Pars news agency.
It listed the others as: "establishing contacts with coun
ter-revolutionary agents in order to mediate between

them and other American agents; collaborating with an
armed outlawed group in order to inform the former
American hostages in Iran on the status of social and polit
ical affairs in Iran" and "making efforts for establishing
radio commmunication between members of the opposi
tion in Iran and the United States."
She was sentenced to nine months imprisonment and or
dered deported from the country by the fourth division of
the Central Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran, Pars
said.
The court ruled that the prison term begin last May 5 â€”
the day she was arrested at her room in the Tehran Hilton
Hotel.
Iranian militants had announced a hunt for American
"agents" they believed were linked to the aborted hostage
rescue mission 10 days earlier, and Tehran newspapers
said Mrs. Dwyer was accused of spying for the CIA. The
report never was confirmed officially.
News of Dwyer's imminent release came first from a
spokesman at Tehran's Evin Prison where she has been
held. The report was confirmed the State Department and
by Swiss officials who represent U.S. interests in Iran.
Swiss diplomats in Tehran said they were still discuss
ing the case with authorities and could not confirm she
would be expelled today. Dwyer's husband, chairman of
the English Department at the state college in Buffalo,
N Y., has maintained throughout his wife's imprisonment
that she was not a spy, that she was sympathetic to the
Iranian revolution and went to Iran because she felt the
U.S. news media were providing a one-sided view of Iran
ian events.
