## Nonaligned group simply seeks long term answers 
### Washington Post 
New Delhi — Foreign min
isters from the nonaligned na
tions gather here today with the
t fragile cloak of unity in which
• the movement likes to wrap
1 itself threatened by a war be
tween two of its members and
widely differing views on how to
react to the Soviet occupation of
. Afghanistan and Vietnam's in
; vasion of Cambodia.
A week of lower-level meet
• ings appeared to have failed to
gloss over obvious differences
; among the more than 90 nations
; and organizations represented
• at the meeting as Islamic states
• insisted that the movement call
I for the withdrawal of Soviet
" troops from Afghanistan and
Asian nations pressed for a con
demnation of Vietnam.
? Moreover, Iran has de
' manded the ouster of Iraq from
• the movement because of the
■two nations' five-month-old
; Persian Gulf war and hard-line
I Arab nations want Egypt — one
- of the founders of nonalignment
I — expelled because it signed the
; Camp David accords and made
• a separate peace with Israel.
Since all positions are arrived
«at by consensus, the movement
; appears to face the dilemma
• here this week of remaining as a
; force to be reckoned with in the
world while sliding over the
} divisive issues facing it in the in
terest of preserving the facade
t of nonaligned unity.
« "The question of winning and
; losing does not arise in a fami
ly," conference spokesman J.N.
• Dixit, an Indian diplomat, said
-Saturday in dodging a question
on which view prevailed in a de
' bate in the political committee.
Differences
Yet there are major dif
ferences between members;
! some involve superpower dis
! putes while others are of mainly
; regional interest.
• There is, for example, no con
sensus on either Cambodia or
I Afghanistan — both of vital in
; terest to members of the move
• ment — and the only big shoot
ling war between nations going
lon at the moment is between
; two nonaligned states, Iran and
•Iraq.
1 Strong pressure developed
;here last week in preliminary
discussions among diplomats to
amend the Indian-prepared
draft declaration — which
merely called for a settlement
in Afghanistan — to push for the
withdrawal of foreign troops.
An amendment offered Friday
by Pakistan closely followed the
lines of a November U.N. reso
lution, but it did not mention the
Soviet Union by name.
The main activity on the Af

ghan front, however, may take
place in private sessions when
U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim arrives here Tues
day. There have been indica
tions that Pakistan is willing to
sit down to talks with the Soviet
installed Afghan government of
Babrak Karmal, but it remains
unclear under what conditions.
Moreover, Iran, which was to be
a third party to those talks, has
refused to deal with the Babrak
forces under any conditions.
Nudge
While it is clear there has
been some movement in the
past months toward nudging Pa
kistan and Afghanistan closer to
talks, it appears unlikely that
the meetings will take place
here this week, and even more
uncertain what they will ac
complish. since the rebel bands
who actually fight Soviet and
Afghan troops will not be in
cluded.
The talks could, however, ac
complish a prime Moscow aim
of gaining recognition for the
Babrak government from Paki
stan and perhaps other Islamic
nations. Some nonaligned
diplomats here also believe that
any new flexibility exhibited by
the Soviets in pushing the talks
is aimed mainly at influencing
delegates to this nonaligned
conference.
On Cambodia — another ma
jor divisive issue — Vietnam
has accused Singapore of being
an agent of imperialism,
fascism and part of the Sino-
American axis for trying, with
Indonesia and Malaysia, to have
the Hanoi government con
demned for its 1979 invasion that
installed the Heng Samrin gov
ernment in power.
ASEAN complaint
The three Association of
Southeast Asian Nations nations
want the overthrown Pol Pot
forces, which still hold Cam
bodia's U.N. seat, to be listed as
the official delegate to this con
ference and complained about
the "high-handed way" Cuba, as
nonaligned chairman, took the
seat from them at the Havana
summit.
It appears that neither side
will be seated here as, once
again, no consensus has de
veloped.
The debate, however, has
created a bloc consisting of the
ASEAN and other noncom
munist nations, including Paki
stan and some Islamic states, to
confront Cuba, Vietnam and
other Soviet allies on Afghan
istan and Cambodia.
Diego Garcia
Dixit, for instance, revealed
Saturday night that there is a

move to omit any references to
the U.S. naval base on the Indian
Ocean island of Diego Garcia
from the section of the declara
tion dealing with keeping the In
dian Ocean as a zone of peace.
Sources within the con
ference said this is being done to
eliminate any pro-Moscow bias
since the Soviet bases in the re
gion are not being specifically
mentioned.
It appears unlikely that the
conference will act on the call
for Egypt's expulsion, especial
ly since the large group of
African nations oppose it, or on
Iran's demand for the ouster of
Iraq. Nor is it expected to tackle
other battles between member
states, such as the Algerian-Mo
roccan dispute over the Sahara
desert or Libya's intervention in
Chad.
Fragmented
The movement is far more
fragmented today than it was 20
years ago, when it held its first
summit conference in Belgrade.
At that event, which will be
commemorated Wednesday as
the birth of the nonaligned
movement, it offered itself as
an alternative between the big
power blocs of East and West.
Now, however, many of those
same nations owe primary al
legiance to such regional blocs
as the Organization of African
Unity, all of whose members
belong to the nonaligned move
ment, or ASEAN or to groupings
such as the Islamic Conference.
Except at the United Nations,
where the nonaligned nations
form a substantial bloc, the non
aligned movement has lost in
fluence in the world during the
last 20 years.
Even Indian Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi, whose father
Jawaharlal Nehru was one of
the movement's founders, ac
knowledged in an interview with
The Washington Post in Decem
ber that nonalignment had lost
power, probably because it had
grown so large that many mem
bers fail to follow its principles.
There were 24 members at the
Belgrade summit 20 years ago.
The current member states
account for almost three-fifths
of the nations of the world.
