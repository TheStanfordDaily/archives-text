# Libyan presence in Chad annoying Africa; leaders wonder about Khadafi's next move

### Los Angeles Times 
N'Djamena, Chad — The Libyans have
been in Chad with both feet since Decem
ber, ending for now this country's bitter,
15-year civil war.
There are an estimated 8000 Libyans in
Chad, and their presence has caused
deep concern in Africa, particularly
among those nations that have long been
wary of the ambitions of Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafi to create a "greater
Saharan" Moslem state, presumably
with himself as head.
The Libyans entered the last phase of
the long civil war on behalf of the coun
try's interim president Goukouni Oued
dei, whose forces were on the verge of
defeat by his longtime enemy and former
defense minister, guerrilla leader
Hissen Habre.
Goukouni and the Libyans routed
Habre from shattered N'Djamena in
mid-December, and on Jan. 6, Khadafi
announced in Tripoli that Libya and Chad
would seek "full unity," a move con
sidered by outsiders as a merger.
Reaction
The Africans' reaction was swift and
angry, but it was confined to a coun
terattack of words. Diplomats spoke
privately of a Khadafi wedge "driven
into the heart of Africa" and pressing
against the borders of vulnerable Niger
and the Central African Republic.
On Jan. 15, members of the Organiza
tion of African Unity met in Lome, Togo,
to denounce the merger and call for Lib
ya's immediate withdrawal from Chad.
The presidents of Cameroon and Ni
ger. Chad's immediate neighbors, held a
two-day conference. Egyptian and
Sudanese spokesmen said their countries

would supply arms and aid to Habre to
prepare a counterattack.
Nigeria accused Khadafi of fomenting
riots by Moslem fanatics in its northern
city of Kano, and then announced a mili
tary budget of $6.4 billion, an expen
diture, it said, that had been "forced by
the world's events."
The Chadian civil war erupted in 1965,
rooted in northern moslem opposition to
the domination of the country by the
Christians and animists — believers in
traditional African religion — in the
south. But in the last few years, the fight
ing has been led by two rival moslem
northerners — Goukouni, a Toubou tribal
leader, and Habre, a French-educated
law graduate.

In August 1979, all 11 of Chad's feuding
political factions signed an agreement at
an OAU conference, creating a transi
tional government headed by Goukouni.
The government was directed to arrange
for free elections by January 1982, and
the agreement prohibited interference in
Chad by any neighboring country.
Oil deal
Libya announced two days after the
supposed merger agreement that it had
agreed to sign a contract with a French
oil company, Elf-Acquitaine, for an ex
ploration project in Libya. The wide

spread perception — in Africa and in
some quarters in France — was that
France had sold Chad to the Libyans, in
the words of one French columnist " for a
few barrels of oil."
France hastily announced a delay in
the signing of the oil agreement with Lib
ya. French Foreign Minister Jean Fran
cois-Poncet said France could only "cat
egorically condemn" any union of Libya
and Chad. Francois-Poncet then hurried
off to the Ivory Coast for a meeting with
French ambassadors to Africa.
In the meantime, France alerted its
navy in the Mediterranean and sent three
companies of marines to its base in
Bouar in the northwest of the Central
African Republic.

The 'merger" that ivas originally announced by Khadafi
seems to have become something less than an all-out
erasure of the border between Libya and Chad.

France is estimated now to have about
9000 troops on the ground in Africa (4000
of them are in Djibouti in the Horn of
Africa). But the French have made it
clear that there is no question of in
tervening in Chad against the Libyans,
suggesting to some that a "secret deal"
over Chad may have been struck by the
French and Libyans.
According to that view, Chad will
eventually become a "federal" republic,
divided into two spheres of influence —
the Libyans in the northern, desert
Moslem area and the French in the

southern, fertile Christian and animist
area. Such an arrangement would satisfy
France, which has never had much in
terest in the north of Chad, and the Lib
yans, who have been similarly unin
terested in the south.
Far-fetched idea?
Most senior diplomatic personnel in
this part of the world see such a possi
blity as far-fetched.
"I have a hard time accepting the
'French devil' theory in all this," one
said. "I think Khadafi outmaneuvered
and embarrassed the French, and I think
that's as far as it goes. I also think it is
extremeley likely that Colonel Khadafi
has overextended himself once again."
The "merger"that was originally an
nounced by Khadafi seems over the
weeks to have become something less
than an all-out erasure of the border be
tween Libya and Chad.
President Goukouni. who some say.
was unable to read the classical Arabic
statement agreeing to the merger, has
since scaled down the Libya-Chad ar
rangement for something less than a
union to something more approaching a
relationship.
One high official in Goukouni's govern
ment doubted the Libya-Chad rela
tionship would survive, citing other
Khadafi "mergers" that have disap
peared into thin air.
Perhaps 7000 Chadians have taken ref
uge across the river in Cameroon at the
refugee camp on the outskirts of the dus
ty town of Kousseri. Most cross the river
to their homes to salvage what little they
can find that has not been looted or
burned by a victorious government and
Libyan troops.
