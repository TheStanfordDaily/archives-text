# Rain, 20 units, and more rain...
## Winter quarter depression sets in 
### Karen Springen 
Few parties and holidays but
lots of rain and units You've got
one guess which quarter is being
described here.
Winter quarter at Stanford
suffers from a stigma Students
have settled into a routine. As
senior Lori Sutherland em
phasized, "they are past the in
itial novelty of being back at
Stanford."
And with six months until
summer, no end appears in
sight.
People tend to reserve their
heavy courses for winter quar
ter. Loneliness and isolation are
expected in a schedule that in
volves increased studying.
Students claim the at
mosphere in dorms grows more
intense as well. Winter seems to
be an emotionally and mentally,
rather than physically, draining
quarter.
According to senior Craig
Goldman, operations manager
at the Bridge, students perceive
their options winter quarter as
limited. They turn inward and
become depressed. He com
pared the reaction to learned
helplessness.
Thoughts of suicide increase
in the winter. It may be seen as
the only choice when students
feel confined and helpless, said
Goldman.
Winter quarter also suffers
from a dearth of social ac
tivities. Many students and
counselors suggest more dorm
planning for galas during the
winter months.
Personal contacts and in
teraction in general seem to be
less frequent than in the other
quarters. The Bridge, for exam
ple, tends to have fewer drop-ins
and more call-ins during winter.
Alcohol use also increases in
the winter. It is a depressant.
But according to David Dorosin,

director of counseling and psy
chological services here, "peo
ple use it as a mild anti-depress
ant."
Most students cited the
weather as a major cause of the
doldrums. The rain forces stu
dents to remain inside and inac
tive, and decreased physical ac
tivity leads to "cabin fever,"
said Dorosin. Depression tends
to deepen as the rains continue
for days on end.

In addition, the winter has
fewer hours of daylight, con
tributing to the overwhelming
darkness and heaviness which
students report.
People come to Palo Alto in
part because of the appeal of the
weather. But winter deprives
them of much of the sun and ac
tivity .
According to Sutherland,
"they get fat and out of shape."
Dorosin urged students to jog
and "get out." But he also ad
vised students to "enjoy the
coziness" of winter. "Less vig
orous socializing can also be
pleasant," he said. "You don't
have to go out and get on a surf

board and drink beer (to have a
good time)," he added
Dorosin called for "creative
thinking about how to plan for
some communion with joy in the
absence of alcohol." He said,
for example, "marshmallows,
hot chocolate and fireplaces are
awfully nice."
To avoid becoming a "nerd
machine." senior Roy Nor
dblom suggested students
"start spring quarter now." He

prescribed late night talks, giv
ing backrubs and meeting peo
ple as remedies for the winter
quarter blues. "Live for the mo
ment," he said
"Any kind of journey is less
happy in the middle of the trip,"
he emphasized.
Each class seems to be
negatively affected by the win
ter in a different way.
Freshman have just returned
from their first visit home, a
psychologically important
event. According to Dorosin,
freshman realize being away
from home is no longer tem
porary. For example, they may
have gone home and found their

room reassigned Many are dis
appointed also by their first set
of grades.
Sophomores easily fall into
the trap of sophomore slump
They face the pressure of decid
ing a major and many complain
of disillusionment
Juniors must make major de
cisions such as whether to be an
RA
And according to senior Liz
Budd, an RA and co-coordinator
of the advising associate pro
gram, "seniors get really dis
oriented. This is the quarter
they're interviewing." They are
not worrying about life here as
they concentrate on life outside
Stanford, she said.
Junior Kathy Schultz
summed up a sentiment on de
pression that seemed prevalent.
"It's the thing to do," she said
According to Dorosin, Hous
ton House tries to schedule
more workshops winter quar
ter. These include "Graduate
Women Face Special Prob
lems," offered by Houston
House, and workshops spon
sored by the Stanford Counsel
ing Institute.
Programs, such as those of
fered by the Bridge, encourage
students to explore and define
their problems and work con
structively toward a solution
rather than dwell on their trou
bles.
According to Goldman, "peo
ple are fighting their battles
alone. Nobody feels they can im
pose on anyone else because ev
eryone else looks so busy," he
said.
He urged people to pursue ac
tivities they think are worth
while. He also cited the need to
accept that people do not always
have to feel happy. "Sometimes
you have down periods but you
go on," he said.

Winter quarter has officially arrived. With the change of season comes a change in mood. Days upon
days of rain and long hours in the library combine, often bringing on the gray depression many students
endure.
