# Kennedy and the early morning dish-dash tradition
## 
### Fred Wainwright 
The entrance to the house at
737 Frenchman's Road is usual
ly dark and quiet at 6:30 a.m.
But today, two pairs of ap
proaching car lights cut through
the darkness. The drivers, clad
in warm-up suits, walk to the
entrance, and proceed to do
streching exercises.
In the early morning dimness,
a tall thin man emerges from
the house. Dressed in white run
ning shorts, a shirt, and a thin,
grey sweater, he introduces
himself to those assembled —
joggers who have come to join
him for the next few minutes
and the next few miles.
President Donald Kennedy
runs on Tuesday and Friday
mornings at 6:30. He will run
with anybody who can keep up
with him, and for the chief ex
ecutive of a large university,
Kennedy is admirably in shape.
Taking the commonly known
dish run', he leaves his house,
climbs a hill to the dish-shaped
Stanford Radio Telescope, and
then returns (downhill) to his
home.
The run itself takes about half
an hour, though the electrical
engineering professor and the
alumni who ran with Kennedy
on that Tuesday were con

siderably slowed by the uphill
track leading to the dish.
The conversation among the
runners varies. They dwell over
subjects like the shortening
length of the day.the engineer
ing professor's years at Stan
ford. Kennedy's yearly ski trip
and the background of the Daily
reporter sent to run with them.
There are many periods of si
lence, like during the uphill seg
ment. when the runners must
concentrate to keep up a steady
pace.
The run can be hazardous at
times. The track leading up to
the dish is eroded and covered
with stones. Add to this the fact
that the cows mingling in the
grass around the path don't ex
actly respect it as a clean place
for Stanford runners to work
out.
But the dangerous holes, the
rocks and the dung are nothing,
when, reaching the top of the
hill, one is overwhelmed by the
breathtaking skyline of the Uni
versity, lit up by the rising sun.

President Donald Kennedy goes through some stretches before tackling the uphill run to the dish. He
keeps a long-standing invitation encouraging runners to join him Tuesdays and Fridays at 6:15 a.m.
Enthusiasts meet at the foot of his driveway.
