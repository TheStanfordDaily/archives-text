## Enjoy first-year isolation 
### 
Freshmen have it easy; they
really do Granted that Western
culture is being forced down
their throats, but that is actual
ly a luxury. The major com
plaint against the western cul
ture requirement is valid; it has
no relevance or utility in today's
society. Intimate familiarity
with Plato's Republic or
Dante's Inferno will not help an
individual garner a client, settle
an account, or get him the job in
the first place; at best it might
impress a fellow employee But
this impracticality. this learn
ing of many admittedly useless
theories merely serves to rein
force the freshman's isolation
from the real world. They
should enjoy dealing with the
meaningless while they can.
Confines of a university
The freshman faces four
years within the confines of a
university. The conflict in the
Mideast and the hunger in the
Third World countries do not
disturb the student's tran
quility. although many non-stu
dents are also apathetic to in
ternational crises. However,
only the first-year student can
truly afford to be unaffected by
the state of the economy.
High interest rates, sky-rock
eting mortgages, and rising fuel
costs barely, if at all, touch this
pursuer of knowledge. Occa
sionally he may be confronted
with financial problems, which
to him constitute being unable
to afford an extra trip to San
Francisco or a new turntable.
Not all students are of the
same social class, but the status
of each is predetermined. The
process of acquiring wealth is
temporarily placed in
abeyance, as are most of the
concerns and goals of people in
society at large. The 7.4 percent
unemployment rate doesn't
phase him. although he proba
bly won't be able to get as great
a summer job as he desires.
This, of course, is seen as being
due to our quarter system that
enables all those students at oth
er schools to fill the really de
sirable positions when they go
home in May.
Rests in 'sanctuary'
He returns as a sophomore,
who. while not compelled to con
cern himself with the rise and
fall of ancient civilizations, nev
ertheless rests fairly com
fortably in this sanctuary. En
tertaining thoughts of majoring
in esoteric or intriguing fields.

this undeclared sophomore
looks disdainfully at his col
leagues who have already de
clared Dedicated pre-meds.
boring econ majors and calcu
lating engineers are obviously
not getting the full benefit of
college, as they stay home and
apply themselves instead of
skiing at Tahoe.
Who can handle the thought of
staying in school for another six
years, staring at graphs for dec
ades. or. even worse, complet
ing circuit diagrams for the next
half century 0 The future is seen
as distant, and to subject one's
self to unnecessary misery is
pointless. With philosophy and
English appealing to the in
tellectual. and psychology, soci
ology and communication
tempting the more gregarious
student, year two comes to a
close.
Junior year rolls around, and
the commitment is made In
most cases. Homer and his
friends are far in the past, as the
student must complete the re
quirements for his major. His
tory majors find they suddenly
possess an incredible need to be
master of all the tenses of a giv
en foreign language, while the
philosophy majors must find
time to grapple with computer
terminals. As his friends begin
their pleas for letters of recom
mendation. or start deciding
which states house the best
companies, the liberal arts stu
dent continues to read his clas
sics and parle his French, but
under a somewhat different
frame of mind.
Isolation ends
By this time, of course, the
imminent end of isolation from
the real world is beginning to be
felt. September comes, and the
student registers for his last fall
quarter; he realizes that he has
no idea where he will be or what
he will be doing one year hence.
He glances at the newspaper,
and reads of the non-existent job
market with increasing alarm.
Gone is the carefree indif
ference; panic has come in its
stead.
The year progresses, and he
hears the red-hot pre-meds non
chalantly consider which of sev
eral schools they should attend,
or the engineering nerds con
template which job offer they
should accept Visits to the
CPPC replace the trips to the
beach. Desperation sets in. and
the history major finds himself
spending the night in a sleeping

bag in 112 ront of the CPPC in order
to beat out his friends for a spot
on an interview list. An in
terview will provide him with a
chance to charm the world with
his cultivated appreciation of
the arts, yet a knowledge of eco
nomics would be a big help, as
being able to recite Tolstoy — in
Russian no less — just doesn't
psych the interviewer for Chase
Manhattan Bank As the senior
nods off to sleep, thoughts of
selling shoes, washing windows
or managing a Jack's are seen
as the rewards of a $40,000
education, and a future Master-
Charge bill becomes the basis of
a nightmare.
Finally the student starts the
last six months of school; the
logistics of finding inexpensive
places to live or ways to afford
exorbitant oil and water bills
are no longer the concerns of a
different world. Meanwhile, the
freshman down the hall bitches
about Machiavelli and St. Au
gustine.

the real world is beginning to be
felt. September comes, and the
student registers for his last fall
quarter; he realizes that he has
no idea where he will be or what
he will be doing one year hence.
He glances at the newspaper,
and reads of the non-existent job
market with increasing alarm.
Gone is the carefree indif
ference; panic has come in its
stead.
The year progresses, and he
hears the red-hot pre-meds non
chalantly consider which of sev
eral schools they should attend,
or the engineering nerds con
template which job offer they
should accept Visits to the
CPPC replace the trips to the
beach. Desperation sets in. and
the history major finds himself
spending the night in a sleeping

bag in 112 ront of the CPPC in order
to beat out his friends for a spot
on an interview list. An in
terview will provide him with a
chance to charm the world with
his cultivated appreciation of
the arts, yet a knowledge of eco
nomics would be a big help, as
being able to recite Tolstoy — in
Russian no less — just doesn't
psych the interviewer for Chase
Manhattan Bank As the senior
nods off to sleep, thoughts of
selling shoes, washing windows
or managing a Jack's are seen
as the rewards of a $40,000
education, and a future Master-
Charge bill becomes the basis of
a nightmare.
Finally the student starts the
last six months of school; the
logistics of finding inexpensive
places to live or ways to afford
exorbitant oil and water bills
are no longer the concerns of a
different world. Meanwhile, the
freshman down the hall bitches
about Machiavelli and St. Au
gustine.

Freshmen have it easy; they
really do Granted that Western
culture is being forced down
their throats, but that is actual
ly a luxury. The major com
plaint against the western cul
ture requirement is valid; it has
no relevance or utility in today's
society. Intimate familiarity
with Plato's Republic or
Dante's Inferno will not help an
individual garner a client, settle
an account, or get him the job in
the first place; at best it might
impress a fellow employee But
this impracticality. this learn
ing of many admittedly useless
theories merely serves to rein
force the freshman's isolation
from the real world. They
should enjoy dealing with the
meaningless while they can.
Confines of a university
The freshman faces four
years within the confines of a
university. The conflict in the
Mideast and the hunger in the
Third World countries do not
disturb the student's tran
quility. although many non-stu
dents are also apathetic to in
ternational crises. However,
only the first-year student can
truly afford to be unaffected by
the state of the economy.
High interest rates, sky-rock
eting mortgages, and rising fuel
costs barely, if at all, touch this
pursuer of knowledge. Occa
sionally he may be confronted
with financial problems, which
to him constitute being unable
to afford an extra trip to San
Francisco or a new turntable.
Not all students are of the
same social class, but the status
of each is predetermined. The
process of acquiring wealth is
temporarily placed in
abeyance, as are most of the
concerns and goals of people in
society at large. The 7.4 percent
unemployment rate doesn't
phase him. although he proba
bly won't be able to get as great
a summer job as he desires.
This, of course, is seen as being
due to our quarter system that
enables all those students at oth
er schools to fill the really de
sirable positions when they go
home in May.
Rests in 'sanctuary'
He returns as a sophomore,
who. while not compelled to con
cern himself with the rise and
fall of ancient civilizations, nev
ertheless rests fairly com
fortably in this sanctuary. En
tertaining thoughts of majoring
in esoteric or intriguing fields.

this undeclared sophomore
looks disdainfully at his col
leagues who have already de
clared Dedicated pre-meds.
boring econ majors and calcu
lating engineers are obviously
not getting the full benefit of
college, as they stay home and
apply themselves instead of
skiing at Tahoe.
Who can handle the thought of
staying in school for another six
years, staring at graphs for dec
ades. or. even worse, complet
ing circuit diagrams for the next
half century 0 The future is seen
as distant, and to subject one's
self to unnecessary misery is
pointless. With philosophy and
English appealing to the in
tellectual. and psychology, soci
ology and communication
tempting the more gregarious
student, year two comes to a
close.
Junior year rolls around, and
the commitment is made In
most cases. Homer and his
friends are far in the past, as the
student must complete the re
quirements for his major. His
tory majors find they suddenly
possess an incredible need to be
master of all the tenses of a giv
en foreign language, while the
philosophy majors must find
time to grapple with computer
terminals. As his friends begin
their pleas for letters of recom
mendation. or start deciding
which states house the best
companies, the liberal arts stu
dent continues to read his clas
sics and parle his French, but
under a somewhat different
frame of mind.
