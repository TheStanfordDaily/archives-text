Dial 911
There seems to be some con
fusion within the general Stan
ford community concerning the
usage of the 911 telephone
number (9-911 from all Univer
sity telephones). Most students
and faculty members know that
911 should be dialed to summon
emergency aid of a medical,
fire, or police nature; it puts the
caller in direct communication
with a dispatcher who will then
send the required assistance im
mediately.
However, it does not seem to
be generally known that 911
should be used in any situation
requiring medical, fire or police
assistance. This aspect must be
strongly stressed as 911 is not
being used as often as it should
be.
For instance, many calls
which could be quickly and easi
ly handled by dialing 911 come
into the Stanford University De
partment of Public Safety, re
quiring the secretaries to han

dle the calls. This is not as effec
tive as direct-dialing 911 since
the secretaries must record the
information and call 911 them
selves and, more importantly,
the delay slows down the re
sponse time for assistance. The
communicators are specifically
trained to react to medical, fire,
and police calls for service and
can thus dispatch units faster
and more effectively.
As part of a campus-wide pro
gram, the Stanford University
Department of Public Safety is
making this information more
widely known. An "all-points"
publicity campaign, including
press releases to the Stanford
Daily, the Campus Report and
KZSU, and distribution of 911
stickers to all student living
areas, is being used to reach the
Stanford community. Students
can aid this effort by noting and
passing on the information
about 911. It is the hope of the
participating agencies that 911
will be used more often and cor

rectly in the future to better
handle student and faculty
member needs and emer
gencies.
Contact the Department of
Public Safety if you need 911 or
9-911 stickers for your tele
phone.

The health and safety walk
through was arranged not by the
University but through the Of
fice Staff Organizing Commit
tee (OSOC) office. A staff mem
ber contacted John Listinsky, of
Union of Stanford Employee's
(USE) local 715 field staff who,
along with Steve Cardoza, USE
steward and member of the Unit
Health and Safety Committee,
agreed to come on the walk
through. They contacted
Barbara Cohrssen of the Uni
versity's Health and Safety Of
fice and asked her if she would
join them. All three came of
ficially as the unit - University
Health and Safety Committe.
The Tuesday night meeting
mentioned by Barbara Cohrssen
actually took place on Tuesday
noon and was sponsored by
OSOC. Listinsky, cardoza and
Cohrssen spoke to a large group
of concerned library staff. All
three agreed that the library
needed its own health and safety
committe. Listinsky reminded
staff members that they can re
quest SU 17 forms (Occupa
tional Accident Report) from
their supervisors if they are in
jured on the job or become ill
from working conditions.
Finally, the article stated
that "reconstruction . . . has
caused considerable discomfort
for the 30 workers in the build
ing." The west wing of the
Green Library contains many
more than just 30 workers. The
area in dispute involves a
stariway which at times has not
been accessible or safe to use by
the 35-45 staff members who
work on the upper floors of the
west wing.

Clash conflict
Charles Buckley (Daily, Jan.
29) contends that the Clash
"have lost track of their
priorities," that they should
"forget revolution rock" and re
vert to "high energy" music

that he can "bop up and down
to." "Rock and roll itself." he
says, seems to have been for
gotten on Sandinista.
Buckley's approach to music
epitomizes our general cultural
attitude towards it. Music is an
escape, something that stimu
lates nerve endings and evokes
pleasurable sensations within
us. As Elvis Costello ironically
entitled a recent album, we lis
ten to (ii't Happy.
Music in our society is a com
modity, not unlike detergent.
T V. dinners, and a university
education. Through the magic
medium of sound we vicaroiusly
experience feelings, emotions
and political committment. We
listen to Jackson Browne in or
der to experience the full range
of human emotions, and Hotel,
California when it is time for a
bit of self-deprecation for our
"decadent" life-style. Popular
music, like pizza, sex. and good
drugs, makes us feel better. The
Clash sardonically note "Coke
adds life, where there isn't
any This applies equally to
music.
We fully agree with Buckley
that Sandinista is a diverse, un
even album. He apparently
prefers music which is
thematically homogenous. Only
then will he feel "alright."
The Clash, however, are ex
perimenting here with a much
wider variety of musical styles
and political themes than they
had before. It appears that they
are having second thoughts
about "commodity music." By
"blending music into their poli
tics" rather than "blending pol
itics into their music," perhaps
they are questioning the ef
ficacy of using rock music as an
instrument of political and so
cial change. Or perhaps they
would like the buckleys of the
world to "reach quickly for the
lyric sheet." Indeed, one of the
more important themes of
Sandinista seems to be the vari
ety of ways in which we avoid
critically thinking about our so
ciety and ourselves.
We agree that the Clash are
not musical messiahs. Their
music is derivative, and their
political vision obviously sim
plistic. We do object however,
to the prevailing conception of
the function of music in our cul
ture. The Clash apparently do
also: "In these days, I don't
know what to sing, the more I
know, the less my tune can
swing."

The Clash, however, are ex

they are questioning the ef
ficacy of using rock music as an
instrument of political and so

would like the buckleys of the
world to "reach quickly for the

more important themes of
Sandinista seems to be the vari

critically thinking about our so

We agree that the Clash are

music is derivative, and their

Dial 911
There seems to be some con
fusion within the general Stan
ford community concerning the
usage of the 911 telephone
number (9-911 from all Univer
sity telephones). Most students
and faculty members know that
911 should be dialed to summon
emergency aid of a medical,
fire, or police nature; it puts the
caller in direct communication
with a dispatcher who will then
send the required assistance im
mediately.
However, it does not seem to
be generally known that 911
should be used in any situation
requiring medical, fire or police
assistance. This aspect must be
strongly stressed as 911 is not
being used as often as it should
be.
For instance, many calls
which could be quickly and easi
ly handled by dialing 911 come
into the Stanford University De
partment of Public Safety, re
quiring the secretaries to han

dle the calls. This is not as effec
tive as direct-dialing 911 since
the secretaries must record the
information and call 911 them
selves and, more importantly,
the delay slows down the re
sponse time for assistance. The
communicators are specifically
trained to react to medical, fire,
and police calls for service and
can thus dispatch units faster
and more effectively.
As part of a campus-wide pro
gram, the Stanford University
Department of Public Safety is
making this information more
widely known. An "all-points"
publicity campaign, including
press releases to the Stanford
Daily, the Campus Report and
KZSU, and distribution of 911
stickers to all student living
areas, is being used to reach the
Stanford community. Students
can aid this effort by noting and
passing on the information
about 911. It is the hope of the
participating agencies that 911
will be used more often and cor

rectly in the future to better
handle student and faculty
member needs and emer
gencies.
Contact the Department of
Public Safety if you need 911 or
9-911 stickers for your tele
phone.

The health and safety walk

Union of Stanford Employee's

along with Steve Cardoza, USE
steward and member of the Unit

The Tuesday night meeting

actually took place on Tuesday
noon and was sponsored by
OSOC. Listinsky, cardoza and
Cohrssen spoke to a large group
of concerned library staff. All
three agreed that the library

staff members that they can re

Finally, the article stated
that "reconstruction . . . has
