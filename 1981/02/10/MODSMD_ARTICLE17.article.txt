# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Paul Baer Registration apathy prevalent at Stanford 
### 
"Now that it's all over. I'm
kind of apathetic."
Those were (almost) the
same words a friend of mine
used when I asked him if he
wanted to attend a meeting of
Stanford Against Conscription,
(SAC), the other week. It
frightens me that this apathy
seems to be wide-spread; in par
ticular it bothers me that I see it
creeping up on me as well. In the
brief span of registration week
it was easy to be interested in
thinking about the draft, and ex
cited by the possibility of trying
to do something about it. But
now it seems to be business as
usuaJ. There are a million things
more important or more pleas
ant to think about. After all, it's

not like there was going to be a
draft tomorrow, is it?
Is it?
What will I do. and all my
classmates do, on the day before
the first lottery? "Hey! They
told us registration didn't mean
a draft!" Or maybe, "If I'd
known I was going to be drafted,
I wouldn't have registered!" I
have already seen myself and
most of my friends caught flat
footed by the realization that we
had a week to decide whether
we going to register. Will we be
caught the same way if the draft
is actually restarted? The an
swer is yes. but should be no.
It has been pointed out that
draft registration does not mean
a draft, and it certainly does not

mean war. But anyone who de
nies that registration implies
these things is not thinking
clearly. The Selective Service
does not want those cards to
enable it to award door prizes. It
wants them in order to be able to
put men in uniform quickly, to
train them to kill and to have
them available for that purpose.
"Well, all that's well and
good, but you're twisting the
point. The U.S. doesn't fight to
kill, it fights to defend itself
(and perhaps its allies)."
Perhaps I am twisting the
point. But there is only one thing
that is common to all wars, and
that is killing. If I had to twist 3
hundred points just to make peo
ple think a little more clearly
about what war really is, I
would not hesitate.
"Now you're just getting
emotional."
You think perhaps I can be un
emotional when I'm talking
about my own life and death 9
But let me try.to elaborate on
some of the reasoning that goes
along with the emotion.
I would not under any circum
stances support a draft. But this
is based on my own conceptions
of the relationship between man
and society, citizen and govern
ment. Some wars may be justi
fied. And it is the relationship
between a draft and unjustified
wars that everyone,draft age or
not. should think about.
One of the facts that disturbs
me the most about the draft is
that it leaves my life in the
hands of an arbitrarily small
number of people. Now. without
question it takes an act of Con
gress to establish the draft. But
it seems very clear to me that it
is completely within the ex
ecutive branch to bring us into a
situation where war is immi

nent and a draft is justified by a
state of "national emergency."
It also seems to me that the
executive branch has a great
deal of influence over Congress,
probably enough even to estab
lish a peacetime draft if it so de
sires. And in response to these
two points, I ask the following
question: simply because Rea
gan was elected president, and
he appointed Haig his Secretary
of State, do they have the au
thority to force people to fight
whenever their world view
claims it is necessary? If they
believe invading Mesopotamia
is vital to our national security,
should they have the power to
force me against my will to kill
in defense of something I don't
believe in? The fact that the
president and the congress are
elected does not give them carte
blanche to use lives as they see
fit.
It is widely accepted that the
United States must be prepared
to defend its access to Persian
Gulf oil. Now, completely apart
from the fact that it would be
impossible for any military
force to defend something as
vulnerable as our Mid-east oil
connection, I would make the
following blanket statement:
there is no economic condition
short of imminent starvation
that could persuade me either to
risk my life or to kill another
person. I am not a religious per
son, but I have no respect at all
for someone who would kill to
maintain his standard of living.
Everyone should ask; how
many dollars of GNP is a human
life worth?
Given the direct question
"would you kill for our oil supp
ly?" most people would hopeful
ly answer no. But it is the nature
of a draft that it removes the re

sponsibility from the individual.
A person whose own life is not on
the line is much more likely to
agree that our oil supply is
worth fighting for. Because
clearly, it is in our national in
terest to keep the oil flowing.
But there is a definite dif
ference between how much one
is willing to submit others to in
the national interest, and how
much one is willing to submit
oneself to. How many of our
Congressmen would (if they
were eligible) volunteer to fight
in Saudi Arabia?
If has been maintained that, if
there were no draft, we would
never get people to fight in any
war, "justified" or not. If the
people of the nation don't want
to fight, can the government
compel them to? If one says that
it is the right and duty of a gov
ernment to protect its citizens
when they don't wish to be pro
tected. what is to keep the gov
ernment from using its power of
conscription simply to keep
itself in power? Can the govern
ment use a draft army against
its own people?
One of the things that struck
me hardest about draft regis
tration is that it leads to ques
tions about all the major issues
of the nation and the world: poli
tics. economics, human rights,
you name it. It had given me in
centive to start thinking about
these things, things which are
often taken for granted when
one is busy studying for mid
terms. All those who are too
busy to think about these things,
should be warned: when they
come to draft you, "I'm doing
my homework" just won't cut
it.

terest to keep the oil flowing.
But there is a definite dif
ference between how much one
is willing to submit others to in
the national interest, and how
much one is willing to submit
oneself to. How many of our
Congressmen would (if they
were eligible) volunteer to fight
in Saudi Arabia?
If has been maintained that, if
there were no draft, we would
never get people to fight in any
war, "justified" or not. If the
people of the nation don't want
to fight, can the government
compel them to? If one says that
it is the right and duty of a gov
ernment to protect its citizens
when they don't wish to be pro
tected. what is to keep the gov
ernment from using its power of
conscription simply to keep
itself in power? Can the govern
ment use a draft army against
its own people?
One of the things that struck
me hardest about draft regis
tration is that it leads to ques
tions about all the major issues
of the nation and the world: poli
tics. economics, human rights,
you name it. It had given me in
centive to start thinking about
these things, things which are
often taken for granted when
one is busy studying for mid
terms. All those who are too
busy to think about these things,
should be warned: when they
come to draft you, "I'm doing
my homework" just won't cut
it.

"Now that it's all over. I'm
kind of apathetic."
Those were (almost) the
same words a friend of mine
used when I asked him if he
wanted to attend a meeting of
Stanford Against Conscription,
(SAC), the other week. It
frightens me that this apathy
seems to be wide-spread; in par
ticular it bothers me that I see it
creeping up on me as well. In the
brief span of registration week
it was easy to be interested in
thinking about the draft, and ex
cited by the possibility of trying
to do something about it. But
now it seems to be business as
usuaJ. There are a million things
more important or more pleas
ant to think about. After all, it's

not like there was going to be a
draft tomorrow, is it?
Is it?
What will I do. and all my
classmates do, on the day before
the first lottery? "Hey! They
told us registration didn't mean
a draft!" Or maybe, "If I'd
known I was going to be drafted,
I wouldn't have registered!" I
have already seen myself and
most of my friends caught flat
footed by the realization that we
had a week to decide whether
we going to register. Will we be
caught the same way if the draft
is actually restarted? The an
swer is yes. but should be no.
It has been pointed out that
draft registration does not mean
a draft, and it certainly does not

mean war. But anyone who de
nies that registration implies
these things is not thinking
clearly. The Selective Service
does not want those cards to
enable it to award door prizes. It
wants them in order to be able to
put men in uniform quickly, to
train them to kill and to have
them available for that purpose.
"Well, all that's well and
good, but you're twisting the
point. The U.S. doesn't fight to
kill, it fights to defend itself
(and perhaps its allies)."
Perhaps I am twisting the
point. But there is only one thing
that is common to all wars, and
that is killing. If I had to twist 3
hundred points just to make peo
ple think a little more clearly
about what war really is, I
would not hesitate.
"Now you're just getting
emotional."
You think perhaps I can be un
emotional when I'm talking
about my own life and death 9
But let me try.to elaborate on
some of the reasoning that goes
along with the emotion.
I would not under any circum
stances support a draft. But this
is based on my own conceptions
of the relationship between man
and society, citizen and govern
ment. Some wars may be justi
fied. And it is the relationship
between a draft and unjustified
wars that everyone,draft age or
not. should think about.
One of the facts that disturbs
me the most about the draft is
that it leaves my life in the
hands of an arbitrarily small
number of people. Now. without
question it takes an act of Con
gress to establish the draft. But
it seems very clear to me that it
is completely within the ex
ecutive branch to bring us into a
situation where war is immi

nent and a draft is justified by a
state of "national emergency."
It also seems to me that the
executive branch has a great
deal of influence over Congress,
probably enough even to estab
lish a peacetime draft if it so de
sires. And in response to these
two points, I ask the following
question: simply because Rea
gan was elected president, and
he appointed Haig his Secretary
of State, do they have the au
thority to force people to fight
whenever their world view
claims it is necessary? If they
believe invading Mesopotamia
is vital to our national security,
should they have the power to
force me against my will to kill
in defense of something I don't
believe in? The fact that the
president and the congress are
elected does not give them carte
blanche to use lives as they see
fit.
It is widely accepted that the
United States must be prepared
to defend its access to Persian
Gulf oil. Now, completely apart
from the fact that it would be
impossible for any military
force to defend something as
vulnerable as our Mid-east oil
connection, I would make the
following blanket statement:
there is no economic condition
short of imminent starvation
that could persuade me either to
risk my life or to kill another
person. I am not a religious per
son, but I have no respect at all
for someone who would kill to
maintain his standard of living.
Everyone should ask; how
many dollars of GNP is a human
life worth?
Given the direct question
"would you kill for our oil supp
ly?" most people would hopeful
ly answer no. But it is the nature
of a draft that it removes the re

sponsibility from the individual.
A person whose own life is not on
the line is much more likely to
agree that our oil supply is
worth fighting for. Because
clearly, it is in our national in
terest to keep the oil flowing.
But there is a definite dif
ference between how much one
is willing to submit others to in
the national interest, and how
much one is willing to submit
oneself to. How many of our
