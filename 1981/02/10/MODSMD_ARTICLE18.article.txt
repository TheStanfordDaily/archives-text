## Escondido rent hike 'unfair' 
### 
An Escondido Village meeting to protest the 15
percent rent increase drew a large, loud and an
gry crowd on January 29. The rent hike outrages
Escondido Village residents not simply because it
means more belt-tightening, but because it re
flects an unfair housing policy that could cause
the gradual extinction of Stanford graduate stu
dents as a species. By the time Escondido Village
rents double — four or five years from now at the
current rate — perhaps the only grad students left
will be those who have extensive holdings in oil
corporations and Palo Alto real estate.
The University set a pernicious precedent last
year when it raised Escondido Village by 14 per
cent: approximately two percent of that increase
went into a fund for new undergraduate housing
Ed Scoles. director of housing and food services,
said Escondido Village rents will keep climbing at
least 15 percent every year for two or three more
years. A substantial cut of the increased take will
go to the undergraduate building fund
Despite a Stanford study showing that the grad
uate student market would easily and eagerly ab
sorb 1000 additional on-campus housing units, the
University has not committed itself to build more
such housing Stanford compels grad students to
subsidize undergraduate housing but refuses to
meet graduate needs.
E. V. residents are more subsidizing than sub
sidized. Their rents cover costs and then some.
Compared to other near-by schools, Stanford does
not coddle graduate students. At Berkely a one
bedroom married-student apartment goes for
about $115, while at Stanford the figure is $251. Im
agine E. V.'s shock when Donald Kennedy an
nounces that . . . rents may be raised to the Palo
Alto market level, which is one of the highest in
the nation. The local Silicon Valley executives and
orthodontists can handle such rents, but what
about a student subsisting on a $3,210 stipend?
Should this rhetorical question seem to murky.

here is a clear-cut mathematical problem. If the
University subtracts Palo Alto level rents from
Stanford-level stipends, what is left? The correct
answer is a negative number.
One might argue that since the majority of
Stanford grad students manage somehow living
off-campus, all can afford the market rate. This is
specious reasoning, because off-campus graduate
students ferret out the cheapest housing avail
able. They tend to live in unsafe neighborhoods,
in run-down buildings and in noisy, crowded condi
tions They moonlight — often exceeding de
partmental restrictions on outside work-hours —
and take out more loans to supplement their "liv
ing' stipends. Writing a dissertation is tough un
der the best of circumstances, and these are the
worst.
Stanford lures top faculty to this unusually ex
pensive region with special mortgage plans and
proposals for more faculty housing, because it
rightly feels that is academic reputation depends
on the quality of its professors. However. Stan
ford forgets that a University's reputation also
depends heavily on the quality of its graduate stu
dents. If Stanford doesn't show some interest in
providing its graduate students with low-cost
housing, the best will go elsewhere.
The E. V. residents who attended Thursday's
meeting expressed concern not only for their own
financial survival but also for Stanford's viability
as an intellectual community. If our graduate pro
grams cease to thrive, people will understandably
assume that the "Junior" in "Leland Stanford
Junior I niversity' refers to "University" rather
than to "Leland Stanford." Everyone here has a
stake in solving the graduate housing problem. I
urge you all to consider thoughtfully the ramifica
tions of this matter — and then raise hell.

The E. V. residents who attended Thursday's
meeting expressed concern not only for their own
financial survival but also for Stanford's viability
as an intellectual community. If our graduate pro
grams cease to thrive, people will understandably
assume that the "Junior" in "Leland Stanford
Junior I niversity' refers to "University" rather
than to "Leland Stanford." Everyone here has a
stake in solving the graduate housing problem. I
urge you all to consider thoughtfully the ramifica
tions of this matter — and then raise hell.
