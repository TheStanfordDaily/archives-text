These lines from "We Just
Disagree" now seem to apply to
Dave Mason himself, a man who
reached commercial success in
1977 with "We Just Disagree
and "Let It Go, Let It Flow,"
but is now more famous for a
Miller Beer ad. This is some
thing of a mixed blessing. His
records no longer generate
enough interest to fill a large
concert hall, but it's just as
well: his talents are much bet
ter suited to smaller nightclubs
such as the Old Waldorf, where
he appeared last Friday and Sat
urday nights. Dave Mason, an
established artist whose career
began in 1964 with the band
Traffic, is not a flamboyant
character, a master showman,

or a person whose antics alone
are enough to keep a concert ex
citing. He is, however, an un
assuming man who happens to
be a consummate acoustic
guitarist and a distinctive

singer. These are traits that are
much more effective in an in
timate setting; in such a set
ting, a fine, quiet song can be a
thing to be savored rather than

just a filler between rockers
Mason personifies the terms
"mellow" and "unpreten
tious. Before his appearance
on stage, all that's visible are
seven acoustic guitars and a

banjo, two microphones, and a
pitcher of beer. As a performer,
he is as casual and comfortable
as an old easy chair. He does a
number, takes a swig of beer,

grabs a different guitar, and
starts the next song His com
ments to the audience are quick
and self-effacing, not the per
functory "Hello San Francis
co!" type yells that the average
star considers good audience
grabbers. His best line of the
night came when a
crewmember trotted on stage
with more beer, and he yelled,
"Is that a Miller? Send it back!"
Mason performed with the
talented guitarist Jim Krueger,
who has recorded with him for
the past several years. Krueger
has written a few songs for Ma
son. including "We Just Dis
agree" and the excellent (if not
well-known) "The Words". This
song appeared on the album
Mariposa Do Dm, which in
cluded the finest of many ver
sions of King and Goffin's "Will
You Still Love Me Tomor
row." The two men have an easy

comradery, which shows in
their deft harmonizing, both
musically and vocally. They can
sound like a large band playing
"All Along the Watchtower" as
easily as they can be simple and
mysterious with "Mystic Trav
eller."
Their opening act, introduced
as a comedian, could have
learned something from their
quiet confidence. By billing
himself as "Dr. Gonzo," he told
us all we needed to know about
his comedic subtlety and style.
With this exception, the show
was everything a nightclub act
should be — low-key, pro
fessional. and entertaining. As
the pair strummed away under
the bright lights, we sat,
watched, admired, dreamily en
joyed, and hoped that Mason
wasn't merely floating along on
a solid, unspectacular career
