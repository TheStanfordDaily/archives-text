# Latest human rights report downplayed by Reagan
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The State Depart
ment's annual human rights report,
whose publication was postponed by
White House request in order not to
embarrass South Korean President
Chun Doo Hwan during his visit here
last week, has charged Chun's mili
tary regime with repressive "law
and-order" policies depriving Kore
ans of most "basic political freedoms
and rights."
The indictment of Chun's govern
ment is part of a worldwide survey
that has similarly harsh things to say
about repression in several other
countries — among them El Salvador,
Guatemala, Argentina, Bolivia and

South Africa — where the adminis
tration of President Ronald Reagan is
expected to seek friendlier relations
with the ruling authorities.
In legard to El Salvador. for exam
ple, the report says that about 9000
people died during 1980 as the result of
terrorism not only from the extreme
left, which the administration regards
as the principal danger there, but also
from the extreme right, which has
covert support from the government
security forces.
The right's abuses detailed in the re
port, which is being made public to
day, are not a new story. But their pub
lication as part of an official report by
the State Department to Congress

comes at a potentially sensitive time
for the Reagan administration, which
has made no secret of its intention to
downgrade substantially the applica
tion of human rights considerations to
U.S. policy decisions.
Unlike former President Jimmy
Carter, who used the publicity atten
dant on the annual report to try to
force repressive regimes to make re
forms, Reagan and his secretary of
state, Alexander Haig, have sketched
out a policy of not interfering in the in
ternal situations of countries with au
thoritarian governments disposed to
be friendly toward the United States.
That was underscored at a Feb. 2
White House ceremony where Rea
gan, with Chun at his side, heaped
praise on the Korean leader and an
nounced strong support for his govern
ment without any qualification based
on its human rights record.
Similarly, Haig, stressing his belief
that the leftists in El Salvador are the
major threat to U.S. interests in Cen
tral America, has said that, if neces
sary, the United States is likely to in
crease its military aid to that govern
ment.
Although the military assistance
was instituted by the Carter adminis
tration, it had been tied to publicly
enunciated assurances that Washing
ton would prod Salvadoran authorities
to solve the murder of four American
women missionaries believed to have
been killed by rightists.
Last week, however, the new ad
ministration appeared to drop this
condition when Haig's spokesman,
William Dyess, refused to answer
questions about the murder investiga
tion and said that, in the future, it
would be pursued through "private

diplomatic channels."
These positions seemed to signal
that the Reagan administration unof
ficially has disowned the 1980 human
rights reports, which were prepared
under the supervision of Carter's ac
tivist assistant secretary of state for
human rights, Patt Derian. and will
not use them in policy decisions.
However, the reports, which repre
sent the factual reporting and analysis
of the department's geographic bu
reaus and its embassies covering 153
nations, are widely regarded as an ac
curate yardstick of the rights situ
ations in the countries covered. In ad
dition, they have their basis not in an
executive branch decision but in a leg
islative mandate from Congress
decreeing that the State Department
must prepare them annually.
As a result, unless Reagan seeks to
have Congress change the legislation
or elects to risk a fight with Capitol
Hill by ignoring the law, the reports
seem likely to keep cropping up every
year as a reminder of the policy that
the new administration wants to push
into the background.
Despite the Reagan adminis
tration's feeling that the Carter policy
was counterproductive, it retains
strong support within Congress and a
large number of church and other in
terest groups. These forces have made
no secret of their belief that human
rights should remain a priority con
sideration of U.S. foreign policy, and
they are girding for an all-out effort to
block congressional confirmation of
Reagan's choice as Derian's suc
cessor. Ernest Lefever, an outspoken
critic of the Carter approach.
In addition to its criticism of right
ist regimes that the Reagan adminis

tration wants to cultivate, the report
cites widespread violations by author
itarian communist regimes, particu
larly the Soviet Union, Commenting
on the situation there, the report says.
"In addition to their continuing vio
lation of basic human and national
rights in Afghanistan. Soviet author
ities have also stepped up repression
at home in a crackdown on human
rights activists as severe as any since
the beginning of the human rights
movement over a decade ago."
In regard to Israel, another country
that has been at the center of human
rights controversies, the report, as in
past years, lauds the high degree of de
mocracy and respect for individual
rights within Israel proper. But it
notes a "worsening trend" in the Is
raeli-occupied West Bank, where ten
sions increased as the result of the
killing of a number of Jewish settlers,
the maiming of two Arab mayors and
the wounding of Arab student .demon
strators.
In reference to the broad global pic
ture, the report found essentially the
same situation as in previous years: a
high respect for human rights uni
formly throughout Western Europe
and a mixed bag of improvements and
regressions in different parts of the
Third World.
