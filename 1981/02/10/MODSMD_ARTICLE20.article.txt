# One thousand clones:'Tribute' hits a new low in screenwriting
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
There has always been a steady supply of
bad writers on stage and screen, but seldom
does one react so violently to an author's
work that one wishes he would just stop
writing altogether. I think Bernard Slade
ought to leave show business and become a
used car salesman, a vocation for which he
is infinitely better suited than that of a play
wright/screenwriter.
I skipped the movie version of Same Time
Next Year, because I had seen it on Broad
way and had to fight to keep myself from
walking out. Ostensibly a comedy-drama
about an adulterous affair that goes on for
years — centuries — it was really just an ex
cuse for dumb sex gags and passe jokes that
Slade felt could be pawned off on audiences
if set in the framework of the past. (Same
Time Next Year must have been the only
show on Broadway in the mid-seventies that
contained jokes about hippies.) Although
the lovers had to endure the vicissitudes of
advancing middle age, the deaths of family
members, and the ruin of their hopes, the
play was devoid of human pity; both were
mere fodder for laugh lines.
Tribute was not a success on stage as
Same Time had been. Still Twentieth Cen
tury-Fox had bought the film rights by the
time it had opened out of town, and so the
movie got made despite the even lower qual
ity of the material. If Same Time was used
Neil Simon, Tribute is reworked Herb
Gardner and Frank Capra. The hero, Scottie

Templeton (Jack Lemmon), a graduate of
the Auntie Mame-A Thousand Clowns
"Live, live, live!" school, learns that he has
cancer, and decides to spend the rest of his
time on earth becoming closer to his son Jud
(Robby Benson). Jud, however, has re
sented him since his divorce from his moth
er, Maggie (Lee Remick). Scottie wants to
die in his own way; he refuses to take
chemotherapy until Jud talks him into it.
The treatment is agonizing, but the cancer
goes into remission, at which point the mov
ie should end — but doesn't. Instead, it goes
on to show us Jud's "tribute" to his dad: he
assembles all the people whose lives have
been touched by Scottie, so that they can
show him their appreciation. (Hundreds
gather; the convocation begins to look like
the Academy Awards, and you wonder
where Jud found the money to stage this
thing and the hordes to pack the house.)
We feel bewildered as we watch this
maudlin finale: this sort of homage is usual
ly paid to a dying man, not one who has re
cuperated. Actually, Scottie is already dead
but doesn't know it; in fact everyone in the
movie is already dead. Slade's dialogue is
the culprit: lines like "When a friend dies,
you lose a friend — but when you die, you
iose all your friends," and Jud's "I had this
idea that by objectively examining the
photographs I took of him, I could bring him
into focus" have embalmed the actors. Jack
Lemmon has never been worse, and Robby
Benson, whose lines are more painful than

Lemmon's, is still worse. As Scottie's doc
tor, Colleen Dewhurst fairs no better: she
hobbles around on an unexplained broken
ankle and looks as if she'd like to smash
Slade or the director, Bob Clark, in the
mouth. Only Lee Remick, who looks radi
ant, survives the picture: by not really giv
ing a performance at all, she steers clear of
the histrionics and ends up being the only hu
man being on screen.
Scottie is obviously meant to win our
hearts, and the fadeout on father and son re
united is designed to make us weep, but both
attempts fail because Scottie and Jud are so
insufferable. Jud is stiff, superior, selfish
and unforgiving. Scottie is childish, ego
centic, overbearing, and a constant em
barassment. Though we are told repeatedly
that he is beloved, we can't see why; he
plays stupid games like dressing up as a doc
tor to flirt with one of the other patients
(Kim Cattrall), and his good turns for his
friends, like the scene in which he throws a
testimonial dinner for a whore, attended by
all her faithful clients, are so bizarre, that
we just suspect we've heard them wrong
and so dismiss them as we watch.
Slade can't do anything that a writer is
supposed to do: he can't create plausible sit
uations, draw sympathetic characters,
write sharp dialogue, or structure a script.
Tribute is not good enough to earn him a
passing grade in any decent university play
writing course in the country.
