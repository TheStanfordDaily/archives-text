# 'Blue Room' lulls audiences with collage images
## 
### Stephen Nash 
Winston Tong calls himself a performer That is a
lot briefer than the truth: Tong is the creator of new
wave theatre collages involving music, film, slides,
dolls, dance, sound effects, and masks. He has been
working on solo performance pieces since 1976 i win
ning an Obie in 1978 and a Bay Area Critics Circle
award in 1979). More recently, he has been col
laborating with film-maker Bruce Gedulig Their
best-known works are "Bound Feet" and "Frankie
and Johnnie" (performed at the Magic Theatre last
fall).
Thanks to the work of people like Picasso.
Rauschenberg and Cornell, the evocativeness of the
collage is well-known Unfortunately, much multi
media theater is boring because the collage idea is
used only as a gimmick Various forms are in
variably used to illustrate just one idea giving the
work a rather overworked unity. The result fails to
provoke the resonances that give the collage form
its importance. What makes Tongs work so exciting
is that the audience is usually unaware — during the
performance — of any unifying idea. People gener
ally leave in a state of startled confusion not know
ing quite why they were so fascinated by what hap
pened on-stage
Last Thursday. Tong presented "Pinky's Blue
Room: an expose of a nite club" at the Barrister's
Eating Club. The performance was sponsored by the
Asian American Theatre Project It would be nice to
briefly describe what happened, and what it all
meant. Unfortunately. Tongs work is full of seem
ingly unconnected images. These images provoke
resonances, invoke memories, manipulate moods,
and hypnotize with their beauty

The stage was covered and backed by white sheets
and in the middle was a sheet-covered bench The
only light in the room was from a small film
projector Night club sounds came from an on-stage
speaker. There were bits and pieces of conversa
tions. piano chords, snatches of melody, crowd
noises
The performance began with Tong sitting on the
bench reading a newspaper He was wearing a heavy
overcoat, sunglasses, a hat, and a mask. He spoke
into a microphone, but the words were barely
audible, and only about half of them were under
standable.
Tong ripped up the newspaper. The strobe effect
of the projector (fragmented news
paper tragmented light), became noticeable. He
brought out a cardboard skeleton and put it on the
bench. Tong treated it as a puppet, moving the seg
ments of the body slowly and smoothly. The motions
were so graceful that the skeleton seemed alive,
even though there was no attempt at illusion. Tong
transferred his costume to the puppet, and put a pink
slide in front of the projector.
Tong told us that this was Pinky. "He's blind . . .
the Blue King . . . ruthless but fair." he said I heard
African music. A film showed a man walking in
shadow. Later it became clear that the man was
Tong, naked.
More music — oriental, new-wave, jazz — played,
changing from time to time. Tong said that there
were lines on the tables telling everyone how to be
have and how to pick the winner. There were more
film: a gradual close-up of a fountain with Egyptian
heads, then shots of the water splashing, moving
mysteriously in and out of focus, and beautiful shots

of a bright orange anemone, which Tong used to
backlight the skeleton. Then Tong covered the
skeleton with a sheet, and we saw a fish swimming
in the water Earlier he had rewound the film, and
we heard the end of the film fluttering.
Finally. Tong told us that there was nothing to do
all day except to play. He pointed the projector
around the room. Maybe it was a spotlight, maybe it
was a searchlight. In any case, the performance was
over.
What did it all mean? Few ideas surfaced: The
performance was too mesmerising The music,
films, and movements were so evocative that it pre
vented analysis. The feeling afterwards was like the
beginning of a good high. It seemed better to relax
and enjoy the sensations than to worry about ex
planations.
The next day, though, it became apparent that
many parts of the work did have a common motiva
tion. Tong spent much of the time gradually reveal
ing himself, often by transferring disguises from
himself onto Pinky. This observation leads to a lot of
questions. Was Tong foisting the phoniness in his
own character onto Pinky, a skeleton? When he
shone the projector at the end. was Tong searching
for answers for himself, or was he implying that the
audience should trust in Pinky as he had?
It seems senseless to try and come up with solid
answers to these questions. Asking the questions,
though, is essential, because it causes the images to
further resonate in the mind. Tongs work triggers
moods and memories; it makes no attempt to "say"
anything definitive at all. See his work and let your
self be provoked. Don't worry if you don't under
stand why.
