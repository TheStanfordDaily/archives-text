Reagan economic forecast disputed
Washington — A Reagan administration forecast that (
the inflation rate will be cut in half in 1982 while the econo
my is booming was labeled yesterday by some independ
ent economists as "wishful thinking" based on untested
theory.
The controversial forecast is being used to justify Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's program of three-year tax cuts and
severe spending reductions that he will outline to Congress
on Feb. 18.
A volunteer group of advisers from the Claremont In
stitute of Economics has developed a forecast of an un
orthodox combination of plunging prices and galloping
growth in 1982 following a mild recession in mid-1981
It forecasts an inflation rate of 6.5 percent next year,
compared with the present 12.5 percent rate, along with a 7
percent increase in economic growth.
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. staff econo
mists for the Senate and House Budget committees, and
officials of the Congressional Budget Office expressed
skepticism, mixed with disbelief, at the rosy outlook.
"They're kidding themselves," one congressional econ
omist, who asked that his name not be used, said. "What
they're doing is starting with a balanced budget and work
ing backwards."
The forecast is based on "rational expectations" theo
ry. which assumes that consumers and business ex
ecutives will change their behavior quickly if they expect

inflation rates to fall in the future. Conventional forecasts
assume that economic behavior will be based on the ex
perience of consumers and business in the recent past
A forecast by a private firm projects an inflation rate of
10.2 percent in 1982 and 9.5 percent in 1983 and a growth
rate of 3.3 percent next year, less than half of the surge in
growth predicted by the president's advisors.
Severe drought hits east coast
New York — Students at Harvard are eating off paper
plates to save dishwater and officials in New York are
thinking of digging a well under Shea Stadium to keep the
Mets' baseball park green as a winter drought parches
farflung parts of the nation.
North Jersey now faces a record low 40-dav supply of
water, and the worsening drought throughout New Jersey
has prompted Gov. Brendan Byrne to extend emergency
water rationing to cover more than half the state, includ
ing all of heavily populated Bergen and most of Passaic
counties.
The region needs 25 inches of rain — 50 percent above
normal precipitation — to bring reservoirs to full capacity
by summer, said Richard Becker, deputy commissioner of
environmental protection Rainfall in December and Jan
uary was 14 percent of normal.
Because of a drought emergency in New York, both the
Mets and Yankees have been told they may be barred from
using city water on the grass when their baseball seasons

begin.
The city Park Dept. submitted water conservation plans
Saturday that included refurbishing the Yankee Stadium
well used in a 1960s drought and digging a similar one un
der Shea Stadium, said Park Commissioner Donald Feren
ci.
In Massachusetts. 29 cities and towns have declared wa
ter emergencies. If the situation doesn't improve in a few
months, a statewide water emergency may be declared.
"There would be no watering of lawns, no filling up of
the swimming pool — and it would be monitored." said
state conservation head Victor Wolski.
RDF command change debated
Washington — Aides to the Joint Chiefs of Staff are rec
ommending that the top U.S. military leader in Europe
should command the much-publicized U.S. Rapid Deploy
ment Force and its 110,000 troops, Pentagon sources re
ported.
The Pentagon sources said the military staff of the joint
chiefs has recommended that the RDF be placed under the
command of Army Gen. Bernard Rogers, the head of all
U.S. forces in Europe and the NATO Supreme Com
mander.
In what has become a much-debated issue, the Marines

have been pushing to have the RDF placed under the U.S.
commander for the Pacific, Navy Adm. Robert Long.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, who head the individual ser
vices, are expected to vote soon on the transfer of com
mand.
The Pentagon sources noted that the European com
mander has responsibility for the land areas of Europe as
well as the Middle East, including Iran, Saudi Arabia and
North Africa, which are the most likely areas that might
call for an RDF operation.

947.18 by the close of trading.
