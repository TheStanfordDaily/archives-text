squad car. only after he had kicked Officer Brian Wax re
peatedly and damaged the door of the car.
After Hacking was taken to the North County jail Satur

or to take a blood test. The arresting officers said they
smelled alcohol on his breath, according to Herrington.
Hacking was charged with being drunk and disorderly,
battery on a police officer and resisting arrest. He was re
leased on his own recognizance without bail at 1:40 a.m.
Sunday, after finally agreeing to participate in standard
booking procedures.
