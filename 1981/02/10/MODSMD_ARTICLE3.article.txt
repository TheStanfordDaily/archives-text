# Spraying still foreseen; Fruit fly fight continues
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” An expert on
insects says the battle against the
Mediterranean fruit fly may be far
from over, despite claims by state of
ficials that the war is being won.
State officials said Friday a fruit
stripping and ground-spraying pro
gram in Santa Clara County had led to
a "resounding defeat" of the pest,
which threatens the state's $12 billion
agriculture industry. They added,
however, that it still may be neces
sary to have aerial spraying, a step
fought by local officials.
Gordon Edwards, an entomologist
at San Jose State University, said he
thinks state officials may be overly
optimistic.

"Whole trees have not been stripped
of fruit," he said. "The fruit-stripping
project, more or less, was a waste of
money.
"It didn't do any harm, it may be
helpful, but when the spring emer
gence (of the flies) begins, I think
we'll have fruit flies all around us," he
said.
Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state
of emergency Christmas Eve and or
dered California Conservation Corps
workers to strip fruit in the county. Of
ficials had already imposed a quaran
tine in two areas.
Officials estimate the eradication
effort has cost the state and federal
governments $4.5 million.
