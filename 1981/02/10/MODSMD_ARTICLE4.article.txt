# Annual Viennese ball to top off the week
## 
### Debbie Walker 
The fourth annual Viennese Ball scheduled for
this Saturday in Roble Gym will top off a week of
Austrian activities that began last night with a
"Kaffe Haus" at Haus Mitteleuropa.
The week of festivities is designed to bring a bit
of Austria to Stanford — from the smoky in
timacy of the coffehouses to the pomp and for
mality of the Viennese balls — according to Bren
da Watson, one of three co-directors of the Vien
nese Ball Committee.
"We hope people will take advantage of all the
activities going on this week." Watson said.
"And for those who have been overseas, maybe
they will feel as if they're back in Vienna."
Committee co-director Anne McCormack said
the Ball will be Austria Week's most popular
event.
Just four days after tickets for the ball went on
sale, they were sold out, McCormack said. Al
though the ball was originated only four years
ago. it is already an established Stanford tradi
tion. she added. ,
"When people hear about the ball, they no long
er ask what it is." McCormack said. "They say
'I'd better get tickets.' "
As Watson pointed out, it is the only annual for
mal function open to the entire University, and
this explains its appeal.

The first Viennese ball here was organized by
Jeff Ryan, a returnee from the Vienna overseas
campus who wanted to share his enthusiasm for
Austria with other students. Ryan hoped the ball
would generate more interest in the Vienna pro
gram, according to committee co-director Ruth
Brentari.
In each year since the first ball, the event has
sold out and enrollment to Vienna has in
creased. Austrian dignitaries and others as
sociated with Vienna located in the Bay Area now
make the annual trek to Stanford to attend.
Brentari, who attended an authentic ball while
she was studying in Vienna, said it was an in
credible experience.
"The best part was that all the Viennese who
seem so solemn and dignified on the streets were
dancing around and smiling," Brentari said.
At Stanford's ball, dancers will have the choice
of waltzing to the classical music of Stanford's
Festival Orchestra or swinging along with the
Stanford Jazz Band.
Free lessons are being offered tonight for
those who want to learn the challenging Viennese
waltzing technique from 7 to 9 p.m. in the Zapata
dining hall.
In keeping with the formality of the event,
Watson said that Selix Formal Wear of Palo Alto
is offering a 10 percent discount to anyone renting

a tuxedo for the ball.
Ball Committee member Jeff Franke said the
Charles Krug and Beringer wineries are provid
ing complimentary wine for the event, and com
mittee members will prepare hors d'ouevres.
Brentari said the proceeds from the ball will
either go into a fund for next year's Ball Commit
tee or be channeled in some form to the Stanford
in-Vienna program, Brentari said.
Funds from ticket sales are also used for the
Austria Week activities, which include a lecture
by Political Science Prof. Kurt Steiner, a
gasthaus. folkdancing in White Plaza and a
heurigen.
The gasthaus can best be compared to a casual,
dimly lit American restaurant, but the heurigen
is a strictly an Austrian phenomenon. Heurigens,
a cross between restaurants and drinking halls,
are located near vineyards in the Austrian coun
tryside. Crowds of Austrians gather in these es
tablishments nightly to drink large quantities of
new wine — called "heurige."
On Thursday night, Stanford students will have
the opportunity to emulate this popular Austrian
pastime
Both the gasthaus and the heurigen will be con
ducted at Haus Mittleleuropa, and the folk
dancing will take place in White Plaza at noon on
Friday as well as during the ball.

Ball Committee member Jeff Franke said the
Charles Krug and Beringer wineries are provid
ing complimentary wine for the event, and com
mittee members will prepare hors d'ouevres.
Brentari said the proceeds from the ball will
either go into a fund for next year's Ball Commit
tee or be channeled in some form to the Stanford
in-Vienna program, Brentari said.
Funds from ticket sales are also used for the
Austria Week activities, which include a lecture
by Political Science Prof. Kurt Steiner, a
gasthaus. folkdancing in White Plaza and a
heurigen.
The gasthaus can best be compared to a casual,
dimly lit American restaurant, but the heurigen
is a strictly an Austrian phenomenon. Heurigens,
a cross between restaurants and drinking halls,
are located near vineyards in the Austrian coun
tryside. Crowds of Austrians gather in these es
tablishments nightly to drink large quantities of
new wine — called "heurige."
On Thursday night, Stanford students will have
the opportunity to emulate this popular Austrian
pastime
Both the gasthaus and the heurigen will be con
ducted at Haus Mittleleuropa, and the folk
dancing will take place in White Plaza at noon on
Friday as well as during the ball.
