# Polish prime minister replaced by Jaruzelski

### Washington Post 
Warsaw â€” Poland's prime min
ister, Jozef Pinkowski, was replaced
last night by an Army general in an ap
parent attempt to shore up the coun
try's weakened political leadership
The new prime minister is Gen Wo
jciech Jaruzelski, 57, defense minister
since 1968 and a long-standing mem
ber of the ruling Politburo. His sur
prise appointment to become Poland's
fourth prime minister in less than a
year reflects the government's failure
to achieve a smooth working rela
tionship with Solidarity, the com
munist world's first independent
trade union federation
(Industrial unrest continued yester
day, as workers at about 400 factories
in the southwestern province of
Jelenia Gora ignored the pleas of Lech
Walesa, Solidarity's leader, and went
ahead with a general strike over local
grievances.)
Despite the change of prime min
isters, there are no indications that
Stanislaw Kania. who took over as
head of the Polish Communist Party in
September, is in immediate danger of
losing his position.
Pinkowski's dismissal, which had
been widely rumored in Warsaw dur
ing the last few days, also reflects his
failure to steer the economy out of
deep crisis. Last week it was an
nounced that the national income had
dropped for the second year running,
this time by 4 percent.
The change of prime minister.was
announced at the end of a meeting of
the Communist Party's central com
mittee, where members called for a
stronger line against continuing in
dustrial unrest and peasants' de
mands for an independent union.

The meeting opened with hard
liners calling strongly to limit Solidar
ity's grounds for calling strikes and in
cluded denunciations of its ties with
the major Polish dissident group. Kor.
the self-defense committee.
During the past week, official news
media in the Soviet Union. East Ger
many and Czechoslovakia have
stepped up their criticism of Solidar
ity and. by implication, the Polish
leadership.
Coinciding with the Polish central
committee meeting, the Soviet of
ficial press agency Tass declared in a
Warsaw dispatch that "Solidarity has
stepped up its subversive political
agitation among the population." in
coordination with the Kor rights group
and other 'anti-Socialist groups."
Continuing the harsh denunciations
of the past two weeks, the press agen
cy said that "the Solidarity leadership
is trying to mount a campaign of un
bridled slander against the Polish
United Workers Party and is organiz
ing attacks on the socialist system in
Poland."
Tass accused Kor leader Jacek
Kuron and others of conspiring to
travel throughout the country "to
many provinces and major en
terprises to agitate the population
against the party decisions." The
blunt language of the official press
agency reflects the anger of the
Kremlin leadership that Solidarity
and the free trade union movement
continues to gain victories in its show
downs with the Stanislaw Kania-led
Polish party and government.
Under Leninist doctrine, the party
is supreme and trade unions cannot
exist outside party control. As the
Polish crisis unfolded, the Soviets
steered clear of accusing Solidarity of
overtly political goals. But in recent
days, as the labor turmoil has con
tinued and now involves the major
southern province of Jelenia Gora in a
general strike over a luxurious san
atorium for police, the Soviet tone has
grown much harsher.
Tass also accused Kuron of calling
for "changing the political system."
and accused Kor of sending "emissar
ies to different parts of the country to
maintain the situation of anxiety and
tension."
The Soviets last fall raised their
military units along the Polish fron
tier to a state of highest readiness, and
Western analysts believe the Kremlin
may have come very close to ordering
an invasion last December.
Jaruzelski's promotion and the
tough rhetoric emerging from the
Polish central committee plenum ap
peared at least partly designed to re
assure Poland's worried Soviet Bloc
neighbors of the Communist Party's
ability to control events here.
Although Jaruzelski is known in the
Army as a disciplinarian, he is re
garded as a moderate in Polish politi
cal terms and is believed to have
argued strongly against the use of
force to crush workers' unrest last
summer. During a previous crisis, he
is reported to have advised his Polit
buro colleagues. "Polish soldiers will
not fire on Polish workers."
Nevertheless, the fact that an Army
