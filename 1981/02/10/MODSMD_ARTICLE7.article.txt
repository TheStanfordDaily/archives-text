## Mexico agrees to help Cuba on oil 
### Washington Post 
Mexico City — As the Reagan
administration moves toward a
harder line with Cuba. Mexico
has shown its determination to
maintain warm ties with Ha
vana by signing a broad energy
agreement with the government
of Fidel Castro.
Initially. Mexico will help
Cuba search for its own oil, sell
the country propane gas, expand
Cuba's main refinery and assist
it in buying whatever related
equipment is needed on the
world market.
Although Mexico has re
peatedly offered to sell Cuba oil
and does sell it lubricants. Ha
vana so far has preferred to
stick to the favorable terms on
which it obtains crude oil from
the Soviet Union
This is, nonetheless, the most
comprehensive energy deal be
tween any noncommunist coun
try and Cuba, which depends on
Moscow for 95 percent of its
energy and much of its ex
pertise. The deal also includes
Mexican training of Cuban per
sonnel.
There is no evidence that the
United States has voiced opposi
tion to the accord, concluded
Jan. 2U although in the final
days of the Carter adminis
tration and during the first
weeks under President Reagan
Washington has toughened its
stand toward Cuba, charging
that Havana is aiding guerrilla
movements in Central America.
Oil exploration
Mexico, with which Reagan
hopes to develop a better rela
tionship. also has given public
diplomatic support to the oppo
nents of the U.S.-backed govern
ment in El Salvador.
This month engineers of the
Mexican state oil company
Pemex are expected to start
work on the main refinery in Ha
vana. which will be modernized
and expanded with a new pro
pane gas plant. The plant should
make up for Cuba's severe
shortages of bottled domestic
gas. For this year. Mexico is to
sell Cuba 10.000 tons of propane
— about l-20th of the amount
sold to the United States last
year.
But the spotlight will in
evitably be on the oil explora
tion that Mexico is to begin both
on land and off Cuba's western
shore.
Soviet and Romanian engi
neers have found only traces of
oil off shore and small quan
tities on land. These produce 5
percent of Cuba's oil needs. To
get another, outside opinion,
Castro turned to the Mexicans,
who had gained specific knowl
edge of the area while mapping
out their own structures under
the Gulf of Mexico. Some be
lieve that Cuba's offshore geo
logical formations might be tied
in, at great depth, with the vast
Mexican fields.
Mexico's ongoing explora
tions show its oil fields off the
Yucatan Peninsula reach

almost as far north as Merida.
which is only a few hundred
miles from the Cuban west
coast.
Cuba-watchers here say it
clearly strengthens Castro's
hand and weakens U.S. chances
to isolate Cuba if Washington
were to consider new sanctions
in the face of alleged Cuban sup
port for the region's revolu
tionaries.
In practical terms, the deal
will also give Cuba long-wanted
access to Western technology
for its two refineries, both of
which were built and owned by
American companies until their
expropriation.
Although Canadian. British
and Dutch oil firms have con
sidered providing the Cubans
with technical assistance, an
accord with the Mexican gov
ernment is more favorable and
secure from Cuba's point of
view.
While the text of the agree
ment gives few financial de
tails. it says that Mexico will
supply "equipment and materi
als produced in Mexico" on a
basis of "cost plus expenses''
and will "make its best efforts"
to help Havana acquire equip
ment in other countries when
necessary.
U.S. law bans sale of Ameri
can goods to Cuba, and U.S. of
ficials are said to be watching
for evidence that Mexico might
act as an intermediary in chan
neling American oil machinery
or raw materials to Havana
Mexico was the only Latin
American nation not to break
diplomatic relations with Cuba
in the 19605, but Mexico im
plicitly supported the U.S.-in
itiated embargo imposed in 1964
by halting most trade with the
island. However. 10 years ago
Mexico began improving politi
cal and commercial ties with
Havana to the point where they
are very close now. Last year.
President Jose Lopez Portillo
went to Cuba following an
earlier visit by President Fidel
Castro here.
There has been widespread
speculation as to Mexico's
motives for reaching the energy
agreement with Cuba. Some an
alysts have suggested it is mere
ly one additional way for Mexico
to assert its independence from
Washington.
Others say the real reason is
that it was promoted by Pemex
chief Diaz Serrano as a way of
furthering his domestic politi
cal career. Diaz Serrano, a
close friend of Lopez Portillo. is
among several aspirants to be
come the next president of Mex
ico.
One of Diaz Serrano's handi
caps. these analysts say. is his
image of being too pro-Ameri
can and too pro-business. These
analysts suggest that his trip to
Havana, where he delivered a
strongly pro-Cuban speech, was
an attempt to redress the bal
ance.
