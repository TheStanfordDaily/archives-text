Kano, Nigeria <AP) — A Ni
gerian federal commission is
holding hearings here into
Moslem riots in which hundreds
of people were killed in this
northern city last December
There are indications that the
political ramifications of the
outbreak go beyond the scope of
the inquiry.
Diplomats say the Nigerian
government in Lagos was
shocked by the 10-day rampage
by followers of a self-pro
claimed Islamic reformer One
diplomat said the government
saw the disturbances as a "re
flection of the country's vulner
ability."
There has been no official
comment on rumors that Libya,
which has sent several thousand
soldiers into Chad, Nigeria's
northeastern neighbor, was be
hind the riots. But a week after
ward. the entire Libyan diplo
matic mission was expelled
from the country. The govern
ment's official reason was that
the mission failed to observe
proper procedure. But diplo
matic sources and press com
mentary indicated the expulsion

was directly linked to the dis
turbances.
Immigrants
Many of the December ri
oters, however, were reportedly
foreign immigrant workers who
under regional cooperation
agreements can move freely be
tween Nigeria and neighboring
countries. They come to this
part of Nigeria — far from the
oil-rich areas of the south — to
work at such jobs as street ped
dlers or house servants.
Two foreign businesmen who
asked not to be identified said
they saw police kill several hun
dred prisoners in two police sta
tions. clubbing them to death
and shooting them
"They were beating them
with lead pipes out in a court
yard and yelling at them to say
who was responsible for the
rampage.an American con
tractor said. "Then they threw
the bodies in a truck — must
have been at least 100."
Another businessman said he
watched from a window of his
office next to a police station as
police lined prisoners up against
a wall and shot them.
