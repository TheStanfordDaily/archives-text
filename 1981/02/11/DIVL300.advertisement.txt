112 "Human Monoclonal Antibodies 112
in Diagnosis and Treatment" |
? Antibodies are specific immunoglobulin molecules produced by &
£ B-lymphocytes in response to foreign substances known as antigens. &
& Methods have been developed for immortalizing antibody-producing &
I B-lymphocytes by fusing them to malignant myeloma cells in culture. §
§ This procedure has recently been adapted to human lymphocytes and §
4 human myeloma cells to yield human monoclonal antibodies. The poten- }
v tial application of such antibodies in diagnosis and treatment will be
* discussed. < ?
