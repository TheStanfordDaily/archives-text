From the Daily Wire Services
Las Vegas, Nev. — At least eight
people were killed and more than 100
others injured when fire — possbily
caused by arson — erupted last night
in the east wing of the Las Vegas
Hilton Hotel.
Firefighters said that the blaze
began on the eighth floor and virtually
exploded through elevator lobby win
dows, leaping 100 feet into the
darkness and spreading to the top of
the 30-story structure.
The blaze, which was reported at
8:07 p.m. and brought under control an
hour later, followed by less than three
months the disastrous fire at the
nearby MGM Grand Hotel in which 84
people died.
Some guests at the 2,783-room
stone-fronted Hilton broke windows
and screamed frantically for help af
ter the fire started from unknown
causes on the southeast corner of the
eighth floor, quickly spreading as high
as the 24th floor and sending smoke
wafting over the nearby Las Vegas
Strip.
Helicopters evacuated people from
the roof, and ambulances rushed to the
facility. Several sheets could be seen
hanging from eighth-floor windows.
"We looked out the window and it
was awful scary seeing the chopper
and the lights," said Deborah Sawyer
of Key West, Fla., who was in a 23rd
floor room with her husband, Tom.
"We saw windows breaking and peo
ple screaming. We felt trapped."
She said they called the switchboard
and were told "to put towels under the
door and stay in the room. We did
that, and we filled the bathtub with
water."
Edward Hammerman and Joseph
Adolf, conventioneers from Chicago,
said they were in their 29th-floor room
when they heard sirens and saw smoke
and headed immediately for the roof.
"When we got to the roof, we saw
flames coming up the (elevator) shaft
through the building," Adolf said. "So
we ran over to the other side of the
roof. When we saw flames there, we
started to get nervous."
Adolf said that within minutes, two

helicopters landed and began taking
about 25 people from the roof.
Many evacuees walked from the ho
tel to the nearby convention center,
where Red Cross and Civil Defense
workers were sent.
Authorities at four hospitals said a
total of about 70 people were brought
in with injuries, mostly smoke inhala
tion. A spokesman at Desert Springs
Hospital had said initially that it re
ceived 100 injury victims, but.that re
port was later scaled down.
Rodney Davis, desk officer at the
nearby Royal Americana Hotel, said
half the building was dark and the
flames for a time reached up the side
of the building at least 100 feet.
Capt. Ralph Dinsman, a Fire De
partment spokesman said the fire
started from unknown causes on the
eighth floor and then "jumped from
floor to floor."
More than two hours later white
smoke was still pouring out of the
building but the flames were subsid
ing.
A Hilton reservations spokesman in
Los Angeles said four conventions
were under way at the hotel and it was
fully booked.
"Yes. there is a large fire at the
Hilton. I've got to go," said an uniden
tified official who answered the fire
department's telephone number.
In an interview following the MGM
Grand fire, Fritz Huebler, manager of
the Las Vegas Hilton, said that his ho
tel "has the highest degree of safety.
Like everyone else, we review it every
month or so."
He said the hotel had smoke alarms
and sprinklers on every floor. The
MGM Grand had sprinklers on only a
few floors and no smoke alarms.
When they smelled the smoke and
heard the sirens Tuesday night, guests
at the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel said
they had one thought — "it was like
the MGM fire all over again.
"My wife had come here and
brought with her an article on what to
do in case of a Hotel fire," said Hank
Arkin of Merritt, Long Island, N.Y.
"All I can say is the safety features in
this town stink."
