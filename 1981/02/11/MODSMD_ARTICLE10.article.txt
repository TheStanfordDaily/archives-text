## Budget cuts could spur increased poverty 
### Washington Post 
Washington — In all the talk about cut
ting Social Security and other broad en
titlement programs that are the bedrock
of the federal budget, one important fact
has been lost sight of: these programs
are not just burdens on taxpayers.
They are important sources of income
to about one American out of every four.
Federal or federal-state income main
tenance programs such as welfare. So
cial Security, veterans' benefits and un
employment insurance make up nearly
14 percent of personal income in Ameri
ca.
The growth of these programs has
helped to reduce the proportion of people
below the poverty line from 22.4 percent
two decades ago to 11.6 percent in 1979,
and any large cut would almost certainly
reverse that downward trend, plunging
more people into poverty.
Today there are 25,214,000 people in
the United States with incomes below the
poverty line, which the government cal
culates at about $3600 annual income for
a single person and $7400 for a family of
four.
But at least 1.9 million additional
Americans would be thrown below the
poverty line if real benefit levels in six
major public income-support programs

were cut 10 percent, according to com
puter calculations by a leading economic
analysis unit here.
If this occurred, the portion of the U.S.
population below the poverty line would
jump to 12.5 percent.
The calculations assumed a 10 percent
benefit cut across the board in Social Se
curity. aid to families with dependent
children (AFDC), welfare for the aged,
blind and disabled (supplemental secur
ity income or SSI), unemployment insur
ance, veterans' pensions and federal em
ploye pensions.
Neither President Ronald Reagan nor
congressional leaders have proposed ex
actly this, but discussions on Capitol Hill
and in the Office of Management and
Budget suggest there may eventually be
sizable reductions in several of these
programs.
The calculations obtained by The
Washington Post showed that even if the
10 percent cut were restricted to only
three programs — Social Security,
AFDC and SSI — the number of people in
poverty would rise over 1.6 million and
the poverty level would jump to 12.3 per
cent.
A 5 percent cut in these three pro
grams would throw fewer additional peo
ple into poverty, 756,000, and raise the
poverty level to 11.9 percent. And a 3 per

cent cut in these three programs would
mean a 429,000 increase of those in pover
ty and a level of 11.8 percent.
"This could reverse the long-term 1
trend and go back the other way," said
Dean Mitchell Ginsberg of the Columbia
University School of Social Work. "Since
the 19605, the theory has been that one ob
jective has been to reduce poverty. I
would be opposed to any such large
cuts." he said.
The economists who performed the
calculations asked not to be identified,
because the figures are preliminary and
aren't based on specific proposals made
so far by the Reagan administration. But
several economists made these points
about the impact of social program cuts:
—A cut in public income programs
such as Social Security, AFDC and SSI
would fall much more heavily on blacks
and Hispanics than on the general white
population because far more of them are
poor or nearly poor now and they depend
more heavily on public income main
tenance programs. Those already under
the poverty line would become poorer.
Those just above it would fall below it.
(Although the national poverty level to
day is 11.6 percent, it is about 31 percent
for blacks and 22 percent for Hispanics.)
—The elderly, whose poverty level is

also higher than the national average (15
percent) would be harder hit than the
general population. Elderly people get a
very high percentage of their income
from Social Security. In 1977, it was esti
mated that about three-fifths of all aged
persons got at least half their income
from Social Security. If through reduc
tions in automatic cost of living in
creases and other Social Security
changes being discussed real benefits
were reduced, the elderly would feel it
especially keenly.
—The South would remain the region
with the most poor people.
The national focus on poverty in recent
times began with the administrations of
John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson
(1961 to 1969) and their efforts to reduce
poverty. The poverty index was de
veloped in the mid-1960s by Mollie Or
shansky and others at the Social Security
Administration.
The poverty line was calculated at
three times the cash value of the Agricul
ture Department's minimum market
basket of food needed to sustain life. This
figure has been updated annually for in
flation. Today it is about $3500 to $3900
for a non-farm individual (the figures
differ slightly depending on age and cer
tain other factors), and $7400 for a family
of four. Only cash income is counted.

benefit cut across the board in Social Se
curity. aid to families with dependent
children (AFDC), welfare for the aged,
blind and disabled (supplemental secur
ity income or SSI), unemployment insur
ance, veterans' pensions and federal em
ploye pensions.
Neither President Ronald Reagan nor
congressional leaders have proposed ex
actly this, but discussions on Capitol Hill
and in the Office of Management and
Budget suggest there may eventually be
sizable reductions in several of these
programs.
The calculations obtained by The
Washington Post showed that even if the
10 percent cut were restricted to only
three programs — Social Security,
AFDC and SSI — the number of people in
poverty would rise over 1.6 million and
the poverty level would jump to 12.3 per
cent.
A 5 percent cut in these three pro
grams would throw fewer additional peo
ple into poverty, 756,000, and raise the
poverty level to 11.9 percent. And a 3 per

cent cut in these three programs would
mean a 429,000 increase of those in pover
ty and a level of 11.8 percent.
"This could reverse the long-term 1
trend and go back the other way," said
Dean Mitchell Ginsberg of the Columbia
University School of Social Work. "Since
the 19605, the theory has been that one ob
jective has been to reduce poverty. I
would be opposed to any such large
cuts." he said.
The economists who performed the
calculations asked not to be identified,
because the figures are preliminary and
aren't based on specific proposals made
so far by the Reagan administration. But
several economists made these points
about the impact of social program cuts:
—A cut in public income programs
such as Social Security, AFDC and SSI
would fall much more heavily on blacks
and Hispanics than on the general white
population because far more of them are
poor or nearly poor now and they depend
more heavily on public income main
tenance programs. Those already under
the poverty line would become poorer.
Those just above it would fall below it.
(Although the national poverty level to
day is 11.6 percent, it is about 31 percent
for blacks and 22 percent for Hispanics.)
—The elderly, whose poverty level is

also higher than the national average (15
percent) would be harder hit than the
general population. Elderly people get a
very high percentage of their income
from Social Security. In 1977, it was esti
mated that about three-fifths of all aged
persons got at least half their income
from Social Security. If through reduc
tions in automatic cost of living in
creases and other Social Security
changes being discussed real benefits
were reduced, the elderly would feel it
especially keenly.
—The South would remain the region
with the most poor people.
The national focus on poverty in recent
times began with the administrations of
John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson
(1961 to 1969) and their efforts to reduce
poverty. The poverty index was de
veloped in the mid-1960s by Mollie Or
shansky and others at the Social Security
Administration.
The poverty line was calculated at
three times the cash value of the Agricul
ture Department's minimum market
basket of food needed to sustain life. This
figure has been updated annually for in
flation. Today it is about $3500 to $3900
for a non-farm individual (the figures
differ slightly depending on age and cer
tain other factors), and $7400 for a family
of four. Only cash income is counted.
Washington — In all the talk about cut
ting Social Security and other broad en
titlement programs that are the bedrock
of the federal budget, one important fact
has been lost sight of: these programs
are not just burdens on taxpayers.
They are important sources of income
to about one American out of every four.
Federal or federal-state income main
tenance programs such as welfare. So
cial Security, veterans' benefits and un
employment insurance make up nearly
14 percent of personal income in Ameri
ca.
The growth of these programs has
helped to reduce the proportion of people
below the poverty line from 22.4 percent
two decades ago to 11.6 percent in 1979,
and any large cut would almost certainly
reverse that downward trend, plunging
more people into poverty.
Today there are 25,214,000 people in
the United States with incomes below the
poverty line, which the government cal
culates at about $3600 annual income for
a single person and $7400 for a family of
four.
But at least 1.9 million additional
Americans would be thrown below the
poverty line if real benefit levels in six
major public income-support programs

were cut 10 percent, according to com
puter calculations by a leading economic
analysis unit here.
If this occurred, the portion of the U.S.
population below the poverty line would
jump to 12.5 percent.
