# Showing off for the visiting tourists

You're walking around cam
pus and you see a large group
looking up at Hoover Tower.
First you panic. Maybe that
think tank has finally blown its
top. Then you notice something
strange about the spectators.
They are wearing suits and
dresses. Some even have gray
hair and there is not a backpack
among them. You begin to get
suspicious. Finally, you detect
the tell-tale sign — cameras.
You breathe a sigh of relief.
"Just another group of tour
ists," you say and walk quietly
past them, a proud Stanford stu
dent.
Tourists. They come to this
campus at all ages from all
parts of the world.
And what do our visitors find
interesting among what stu
dents consider so mundane?
Tour guide Teri Tompkins said
the continuity of the campus
layout seems to impress and
surprise most of the visitors.
"They are surprised that we
have so much land and that the
architecture is so continuous.
They are surprised that Stan
ford isn't plopped right in the
middle of a city."
She said people are very im
pressed with Memorial Church
and the view from Hoover Tow
er. Another tour guide said
many visitors are interested by
the dish and how to get there.
Tompkins together with other
student tour guides provide bits
of Stanford history and a guided
tour to various campus sights
through the Tourist Information
Center. Tours are given twice
daily. The route begins at the
front of the Quad, goes past the
Terman Engineering Building,
through White Plaza and ends at
Hoover Tower.
There are as many reasons to
view Stanford as there are tour
ists. Most of those that
Tompkins guides are pros
pective students and their pa

rents.
"Students want to know what
the food's like, what dorm life is
like. Parents want to know
where the library is," she
laughed.
Then there are tourists like
Juanita Williams. She is 60-
years-old. She visited Stanford
to see how much the campus had
changed since her son attended
Stanford 17 years ago.
Not all of Stanford's visitors
can be called tourists. Last year
a record 1151 foreigners came.
Many of the visits were ar
ranged through the Interna
tional Foreign Visitors Pro
gram (IFVP).This program es
tablished by the Fullbright-
Hayes Act is intended to act as
an official host to leading mem
bers of foreign societies. After
being selected by committees in
their home country, the partici
pants are encouraged to learn
about various segments and
views of American society.
Maria-Mary Bun, coordinator
of the program, believes Stan
ford is a popular choice among
participants because of its in
ternational reputation.
"We have 2000 foreign stu
dents and professors who travel
enough so they've heard of us,"
she said.
She attributes the record
number of visitors last year to
the presidential election. Every
election year the number in
creases because foreign jour
nalists, politicians and
educators want a close-up view
of America in the midst of
change.
Bun observed that it is wrong
to call these people 'tour
ists,'because, "It's not as
simple as it looks."
IFVP participants usually
stay from one to three days dur
ing which they follow an individ
ually tailored program. Unlike
most visitors, these people
come to Stanford with clear

educational purposes in mind.
But cashiers at the Stanford
Bookstore point out that our
guests have some interests in
common: souvenirs. Margerie
Roberts, of the bookstore, said
most tourists buy mugs, tee
shirts and key chains.
Tour guides said they receive
good feedback from visitors.
Overwhelmed by Stanford's
teaching facilities and environ

ment, one visitor asked: "Is it a
university or a resort? Only the
students know for sure.''
In addition to prospective stu
dents, alumni and foreign
VlF's, an occasional current
Stanford student will show up
for a tour. An ex-tour guide sug
gested that people take a tour
when they get "depressed and
wonder why they came here in
the first place."


Campus tours are given twice daily and feature
bits of Stanford history along with the sights.

Groups depart from the Quad and finish the route
with the view from Hoover Tower.


Visitors to Stanford include alumni, prospective students, and for
eign VIPs. Tour guides say they receive positive feedback — most
people are overwhelmed by Stanford's teaching facilities and en
vironment. A commonly asked question has been, "Is this a univer
sitv or a countrv club?"
