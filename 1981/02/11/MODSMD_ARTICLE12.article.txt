San Francisco (AP) — A
coalition of fundamentalist re
ligious groups is expected to
launch an anti-homosexual
movement in San Francisco
soon, KRON-TV reported Mon
day.
The NBC station said the Rev.

Richard Zone, head of "In God
We Trust Inc." of Seaside, plans
to target public officials who
are homosexuals or who support
homosexual rights.
"I think there are more peo
ple in San Francisco who feel
homosexuality should not be

treated as a legitimate minority
than those who think it should,"
Zone told the station.
The station said the Moral
Majority was also expected to
join in the drive. It quoted Dean
Wycoff, head of the group's San
ta Clara County chapter, as
saying he thinks homosexuality
should be punishable by death.
Gay Supervisor Harry Britt
said in response to the proposed
drive, "If they think they have a
chance in San Francisco, they
don't know this town,"
Zone said the group has
$100,000 in "seed money" to buy
radio time and hope to "polarize
the community" with ads.
"If we can do it in San Fran
cisco, we can do it anywhere,"
he said.
San Francisco is known as a
gay center, with an estimated
100,000 or more of its 675.000
population said to be homosex
uals.
Zone is an Assembly of God
minister in Seaside, on the Mon
