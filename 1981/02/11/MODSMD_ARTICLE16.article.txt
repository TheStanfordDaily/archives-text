## Reverse neutron bomb stance 
### 
As The Mew York Times said on Sunday.
President Ronald Reagan has been devot
ing most of his attention to his economic
policies, and his lack of attention to mili
tary and foreign issues shows. One exam
ple of this is Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger's recent endorsement of the
neutron bomb.
The neutron bomb, called an "enhanced
radiation weapon" in Pentagon parlance,
is designed to emit large quantities of
lethal radiation while only causing a rela
tively small blast, leaving buildings in
tact. The bomb was developed with the in
tention of use against an invasion of
Western Europe by Warsaw Pact forces.
Superficially, this may seem like an ef
fective way to discourage the Soviets from
attempting a 'conventional' assault on our
European NATO allies. However, there
are several flaws in this approach.
For one thing, possession and deploy
ment of the neutron bomb would serve
only to foster the mistaken notion that a
nuclear war can be either "limited" or
winnable. A bomb with a more limited ra
dius of destruction is one that is more like
ly to be used; it would be psychologically
more accessible to the generals because it
is sold to them as being somehow more
palatable, less "dirty" than tactical weap
ons deployed so far. But even if it is lim

ited in some way, the ecological and hu
man disturbance it could cause would be
staggering.
Any use of nuclear weapons would be
likely to cause a nuclear reply by the op
posite side. It is highly doubtful that the
nuclear responses would be restricted to
only "tactical" exchanges and that the ex
pansion of nuclear exchange to 'strategic'
attacks (a euphemism for civilian cen
ters) could be prevented. No Soviet or
American leader would long command the
respect or obedience of his countrymen
had their nation sustained a nuclear strike
and failed to respond in kind.
Almost too obvious to mention are the
perverse values required for someone to
build a weapon aimed at saving property
but destroying human life. Whatever mud
dled strategic reasoning may lurk behind
the bomb pales in the face of this absurdi
ty. The neutron bomb would not only kill
those people within its range, but subject
them to the horrors of radiation poisoning.
Furthermore, our Western European al
lies, in whose hinterlands the neutron
bomb will be deployed if the Pentagon pro
posals are followed, object strenuously to
the bomb. They believe it would
destabilize and endanger the balance of
power in Western Europe.
