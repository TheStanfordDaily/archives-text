# Reagan sets belligerent tone
## 
### 
A new president's initial statements to
the press set the tone for the new adminis
tration. Unfortunately, President Ronald
Reagan projected an inflexible, hostile
and belligerent attitude in his first news
conference last Thursday, and has con
tinued this attitude in his subsequent ap
pearances.
The danger of adopting a hard-line posi
tion toward the Soviets is compounded by
the president's simplistic treatment of
delicate issues. Reagan's overly blunt
statements will lead to uncertainty and
confusion among our friends and allies as
inevitably as they will add to the existing
distrust between the U.S. and less friendlv

countries.
Last Thursday. Reagan blasted the Sovi
ets, calling detente a "one-way street."
He further claimed that "they reserve
unto themselves the right to commit any
crime" to attain a one-world socialist or
communist state.
The hazards of President Reagan's gen
eral attitude and tough stance are magni
fied by the attention that these first
statements will receive. Since the begin
ning of his administration, Reagan has
dangerously and foolishly set a confronta
tional tone, and the possible harmful ef
fects of his actions may be quite difficult
to undo.
