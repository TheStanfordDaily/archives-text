## Clerical workers 'astonished' 
### 
With a union election for Stan
ford's clerical workers coming
up in May. and a federal law
that forbids the unfair influenc
ing of such elections, some of us
were more than astonished to
get a letter from President
Donald Kennedy with the
punchline, "I think it would be a
mistake to unionize."
A mailout like that, addressed
to the entire staff and faculty,
with all the authority and pres
tige of the president's office be
hind it, must be running awfully
close to the law. There is no
question that such a statement
constitutes a powerful man
ifesto of support for all lower
level supervisors who wish, by
one means or another, to dis
suade. discourage or intimidate
employees from joining a union.
Although he calls himself "a
lifelong Democrat" — and may
well be rooting for unions in Po
land. 4,000 miles away — his ob
servations on unionization here
betray little of that and are
surely more noteworthy for
their provenance than their ob
jectivity.
"Unions don't make a few
poor supervisors better," he
said. True — even if he is too
modest about their number. A
union does not transform the
poor supervisors Stanford hires
and maintains (although it often
succeeds in curbing their worst
excesses). It does, however,
provide the employee with a
modicum of protection against
such supervisors — such as a de
cent grievance procedure,
which we surely do not have
now.
University Counsel Priscilla
Wheeler's statement, (Daily,
Feb. 5) that a union is not neces
sary because "employees can
bring problems directly to their
employers," does not quite
portray the reality of the situ
ation, which she should know
better than most.
In cases of dispute — when
employer and employee are not
quite in accord on questions of
promotions, raises and justice
in the workplace — Stanford
employees who are not mem
bers of USE's bargaining unit
are now subject to a judicial sys
tem in the workplace that they
would reject out of hand as
grotesque in any other context.
The administration, a few
years back, abolished outside
arbitration — an ultimate
judgment by an impartial out
sider with power of subpoena
for all relevant documentation
— for all but dismissal cases
The grievance procedure,
beguilingly, is open to any em
ployee "whenever an unfair or
improper action has occurred
In effect, the employee nor
mally has to appeal for redress
to the very people responsible
for the "unfair or improper ac
tion" in the first place — or to
their immediate superior, up to
their superiors' superiors.
As many grievants have dis
covered, what they find along

the way is not an earnest bunch
of people sincerely grappling
with the bewildering problems
of justice, but rather, in the
closed chambers of the griev
ance hearings, a solid adminis
trative group solely intent upon
upholding the hierarchy, leav
ing the grievant no recourse but
to bite the bullet or quit.
"Unions don't create more rev
enue for the University," said
Kennedy. That is setting up a
straw man and knocking him
down. Since when has it been the
role of unions to go out and make
money for employers? Even at
Chrysler they have not been
asked to go out on the showroom
floor and push cars. (But
Chrysler workers do say that
had they been drawn into the de
cision-making processes much
sooner, the company might not
now be in the pickle it is in.)
Stanford always talks poor to
the union. It is an enormously
rich institution. Allocating
monies for decent wages for its
employees should be one of its
first priorities.
For advice on unionization,
Kennedy sends us to the Univer
sity Counsel's or the Employee
Relations office. The former, in
its haste, rejected the union
petition before it was even filed.
The latter - to the surprise of
many who think (though not for
long) it is a body designed to
protect employees, or, at least,
mediate for them — is a well-en
gineered prop for the adminis
trative hierarchy. Referring
people to either office is like
sending the sheep to see the wolf
for dietary guidance.
Kennedy has portrayed the
union drive as spawned by re
cent hires — a sort of youthful
aberration not quite shared by
more nature minds. Since union
cards are, quite properly, con
fidential, he may not realize
that in the library, for instance,
they were signed copiously by
women in their forties and fif
ties. most of them long-time
employees and several to whom
"union" had been a dirty word
until quite recently. They were
recruited by their own vast dis
content with an arrogant and un
responsive management and
frustration over their im
potence in dealing with their sit
uation individually or through
small groups, easy to ignore.
"There are real problems in
volving salary levels, benefits,
career opportunities and work
ing conditions," admitted Ken
nedy. But then he added, "We
. . . employers must seek solu
tions to them ... It is the Uni
versity's best interest to be re
sponsive to its employees."
The implications of these
words seem in itself to provide a
rationale for unionizing. Why is
it only the employer that must
seek the solutions? How about
the employees, who are most af
fected by them? His very con
cept of what constitutes the Uni
versity excludes its employees
— as if those of us who work at

Stanford were not an integral
part of it, but merely the object
of our employer's disposition.
"Unions don't automatically
solve these problems." No one
says they do. A union is not a
panacea to all the ills of the
workplace. It is a coming to
gether, in an orderly organiza
tion, of people with a com
munality of interests, desires
and concerns about the way and
place in which they make their
living so that, united, they a
have a stronger; voice.
There is no doubt that the ad
ministration, when confronted
with a union that comprises the
great majority of its employees
will have to listen and respond
in ways that are very different
from those accorded to individ
ual, isolated efforts. It does lit
tle credit to the administration
of a university to oppose so forc
ibly the right of one of its largest
constituencies to establish an
effective apparatus for making
its needs known and safe
guarding its interests.
To unionize is not a mistake.
It is the only means we have of
effectively dealing with dignity
on a footing of equality with our
employer to work toward solu
tions to our problems and to se
cure for ourselves some of our
basic rights.

cent hires — a sort of youthful
aberration not quite shared by
more nature minds. Since union
cards are, quite properly, con
fidential, he may not realize
that in the library, for instance,
they were signed copiously by
women in their forties and fif
ties. most of them long-time
employees and several to whom
"union" had been a dirty word
until quite recently. They were
recruited by their own vast dis
content with an arrogant and un
responsive management and
frustration over their im
potence in dealing with their sit
uation individually or through
small groups, easy to ignore.
"There are real problems in
volving salary levels, benefits,
career opportunities and work
ing conditions," admitted Ken
nedy. But then he added, "We
. . . employers must seek solu
tions to them ... It is the Uni
versity's best interest to be re
sponsive to its employees."
The implications of these
words seem in itself to provide a
rationale for unionizing. Why is
it only the employer that must
seek the solutions? How about
the employees, who are most af
fected by them? His very con
cept of what constitutes the Uni
versity excludes its employees
— as if those of us who work at

Stanford were not an integral
part of it, but merely the object
of our employer's disposition.
"Unions don't automatically
solve these problems." No one
says they do. A union is not a
panacea to all the ills of the
workplace. It is a coming to
gether, in an orderly organiza
tion, of people with a com
munality of interests, desires
and concerns about the way and
place in which they make their
living so that, united, they a
have a stronger; voice.
There is no doubt that the ad
ministration, when confronted
with a union that comprises the
great majority of its employees
will have to listen and respond
in ways that are very different
from those accorded to individ
ual, isolated efforts. It does lit
tle credit to the administration
of a university to oppose so forc
ibly the right of one of its largest
constituencies to establish an
effective apparatus for making
its needs known and safe
guarding its interests.
To unionize is not a mistake.
It is the only means we have of
effectively dealing with dignity
on a footing of equality with our
employer to work toward solu
tions to our problems and to se
cure for ourselves some of our
basic rights.

With a union election for Stan
ford's clerical workers coming
up in May. and a federal law
that forbids the unfair influenc
ing of such elections, some of us
were more than astonished to
get a letter from President
Donald Kennedy with the
punchline, "I think it would be a
mistake to unionize."
A mailout like that, addressed
to the entire staff and faculty,
with all the authority and pres
tige of the president's office be
hind it, must be running awfully
close to the law. There is no
question that such a statement
constitutes a powerful man
ifesto of support for all lower
level supervisors who wish, by
one means or another, to dis
suade. discourage or intimidate
employees from joining a union.
Although he calls himself "a
lifelong Democrat" — and may
well be rooting for unions in Po
land. 4,000 miles away — his ob
servations on unionization here
betray little of that and are
surely more noteworthy for
their provenance than their ob
jectivity.
"Unions don't make a few
poor supervisors better," he
said. True — even if he is too
modest about their number. A
union does not transform the
poor supervisors Stanford hires
and maintains (although it often
succeeds in curbing their worst
excesses). It does, however,
provide the employee with a
modicum of protection against
such supervisors — such as a de
cent grievance procedure,
which we surely do not have
now.
University Counsel Priscilla
Wheeler's statement, (Daily,
Feb. 5) that a union is not neces
sary because "employees can
bring problems directly to their
employers," does not quite
portray the reality of the situ
ation, which she should know
better than most.
In cases of dispute — when
employer and employee are not
quite in accord on questions of
promotions, raises and justice
in the workplace — Stanford
employees who are not mem
bers of USE's bargaining unit
are now subject to a judicial sys
tem in the workplace that they
would reject out of hand as
grotesque in any other context.
The administration, a few
years back, abolished outside
arbitration — an ultimate
judgment by an impartial out
sider with power of subpoena
for all relevant documentation
— for all but dismissal cases
The grievance procedure,
beguilingly, is open to any em
ployee "whenever an unfair or
improper action has occurred
In effect, the employee nor
mally has to appeal for redress
to the very people responsible
for the "unfair or improper ac
tion" in the first place — or to
their immediate superior, up to
their superiors' superiors.
As many grievants have dis
covered, what they find along

the way is not an earnest bunch
of people sincerely grappling
with the bewildering problems
of justice, but rather, in the
closed chambers of the griev
ance hearings, a solid adminis
trative group solely intent upon
upholding the hierarchy, leav
ing the grievant no recourse but
to bite the bullet or quit.
"Unions don't create more rev
enue for the University," said
Kennedy. That is setting up a
straw man and knocking him
down. Since when has it been the
role of unions to go out and make
money for employers? Even at
Chrysler they have not been
asked to go out on the showroom
floor and push cars. (But
Chrysler workers do say that
had they been drawn into the de
cision-making processes much
sooner, the company might not
now be in the pickle it is in.)
Stanford always talks poor to
the union. It is an enormously
rich institution. Allocating
monies for decent wages for its
employees should be one of its
first priorities.
For advice on unionization,
Kennedy sends us to the Univer
sity Counsel's or the Employee
Relations office. The former, in
its haste, rejected the union
petition before it was even filed.
The latter - to the surprise of
many who think (though not for
long) it is a body designed to
protect employees, or, at least,
mediate for them — is a well-en
gineered prop for the adminis
trative hierarchy. Referring
people to either office is like
sending the sheep to see the wolf
for dietary guidance.
