Clericals outraged
I am appalled and surprised
that Donald Kennedy would use
his prestige and power as Presi
dent to urge office workers not
to join together in an organiza
tion to represent their interests
(Daily, Jan. 27).
Faculty members have long
protected their interests both as
employees of the University and
as professionals.
Should clerical workers,
largely women with con
siderable less individual power,
be denied the opportunity to
unite in an organization to pro
tect their needs and rights?
Whose interests does it serve to
separate and divide workers
and force them to rely on the
questionable benevolence of the
University administration?
Unions have been the tradi
tional form of organization
through which workers have
won improved working condi
tions. The broad experience of

Local 715 of the Service Em
ployees International Union will
be of great assistance to the
Stanford office workers in their
negotiations with the University
administrations.
It is incredible that President
Kennedy should stoop to anti
union propoganda. Such activity
is best left to hirelings paid to do
the dirty work. The office of the
Presidency need not have been
degraded nor the Kennedy im
age as a liberal besmirched.
I hope the office workers will
not allow themselves to be ma
nipulated to act against their
own best interests.
I hope the faculty and stu
dents who have learned the val
ue of unity through organization
will support the drive of women
workers to become an organized
group recognized as an in
valuable constituency of the
University.

Blacks demeaned
As a concerned member of
the minority community, I feel
outraged at the insensitivity of
the Daily in publishing two po
litical cartoons featuring blacks
in menial and demeaning roles
(Daily, Jan. 26 and 28).
In both political cartoons, the
black was portrayed as a butler
shuffling in the background. The
presence of the black butler is
startling because there are no
other blacks in the picture, mak
ing it obvious that the
stereotypical role was intended
to add to the humor.
This kind of humor is de
rogatory since it implies that
the black man is an inferior.
This is no different from the
"coon" humor originating in the
1850's that stressed romantic
and sentimentalized images of
happy, contented slaves. In
drawing these images, white
Americans rejected the human

izing content of folklore and the
complexity of human diversity
for the comforting facade of ro
manticized, folksy caricatures.
Today it is TV, films, and
caricatures such as these which
have taken up the function of ex
pressing, popularizing and ex
ploiting the black American cul
ture through old stereotypes. To
cite an explicit example,
Benson of the hit TV show of the
same name, like the caricature
in the Daily, is nothing more
than a descendent of the old
stereotype of the black butler
who runs the plantation's big
house. Caricatures such as
these reinforce my view that
some white Amricans are afraid
to see blacks, Chicanos, and oth
er minorities for what they are.
They draw romanticized im
ages of blacks content with the
present situation in America.
