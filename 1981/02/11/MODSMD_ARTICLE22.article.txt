## Curse of being an intellectual here 
### 
Before entering Stanford, I
used to believe in the superior
intellectual environment of the
university. After all, the univer
sity was the place where one
could engage in pure intellec
tual speculation on a whole
range of serious matters from
human nature to social-econom
ic forces, history to contem
porary politics, philosophy to
psychology, the struggle for
freedom, a realistic vision of a
better society and how to go

about realizing that vision . . .
etc.
Most importantly, I use to be
lieve that it was at the univer
sity where one would largely de
velop a well-reasoned set of per
sonal values for his or her entire
life, enriched by a daily interac
tion with intelligent, concerned
peers. The most controversial
issues of the day would be de
bated endlessly. Such elusive
topics as the "destiny of human
ity," the meaning of history" or
"the role of science and technol
ogy in the modern world" would
be discussed enthusiastically
outside the classroom as well as
inside the classroom.
I don't know what I could have
been thinking at the time to
have fervently believed in the
intellectual purity, sophisti
cation and superiority of the
university environment. Maybe
it was the anticipation of getting
away from the awkwardness
and the pettiness which so char
acterized the high school en
vironment. Maybe I evoked the
image of the ancient Greek ide
al all too often when thinking of
the modern university. Maybe it
was the memory of my one day
visit to this university as a pros
pective freshman where I sat in
on a philosophy class and
watched many concerned Stan
ford students passionately and
thoughtfully take down notes
. . . Anyway, as it stands now,
my illusions on this point are ef
fectively and thoroughly de
stroyed. at least as far as this
university is concerned.

Of course, I admit, my expec
tations were far too high. After
all, a university is also supposed
to prepare students for specific
careers out in the real world
whether they give a damn about
humanity's destiny or not, or
whether they have an opinion on
the contemporary political and
economic situation. I don't dis
pute the fact that one must get a
job sooner or later some time
after graduation, or that usually
the quality of that job depends
on, to a large extent, specific
knowledge and skills acquired
during a university education.
But does this mean that the
academic environment at this
university must necessarily be
so blatantly anti-intellectual?
Does this mean that virtually all
discussion of "serious" matters
must be confined to the
classroom? Must there always
be some sort ot stigma as
sociated with a serious dis
cussion at the dinner table? I
mean by serious at least some
thing other than the Econ. I
midterm, the unfair grade on
the last paper — "How dare he
give me a B!the party Friday
night, the latest hit record, the
latest dirty joke. etc.
The guiding principles at
Stanford nowadays (and the en
tire country for that matter)
seem to be superficiality and
narrow-minded ambition. I
even find myself trying more
often to avoid a serious intellec
tual discussion at the dinner
table, in a vain attempt to fit in
with all the admirable gaiety
and superficiality surrounding

me. The little conformist voice
cries within me "be mellow, but
don't be too opiniated!". But
still I often feel unsatisfied and
even disgusted after yet another
meaningless discussion, for
there is another little radical in
tellectual voice within me
which repeatedly and naively
asks the question, "What is
wrong with having a serious dis
cussion about something we all
have in common, even after
you've been in class all day, or
even having such discussions
frequently?".
I suspect an electrical engi
neering major and an art major
have more in common with each
other than they think. There are
things that affect all our lives
which we all have a common
task in understanding, and that
task requires serious intellec
tual discussion. If being in
tellectual is out of style at the
university level, then I hate to
think what it is like in other
levels of society. Indeed, if one
can't pursue a serious intellec
tual discussion on a daily basis
in a prestigious university such
as Stanford then where can one?
Must the underlying guidelines
to university life always be am
bition (getting the A) and super
ficiality (getting wasted)?
Luckily, there are the excep
tions. Thank God for the excep
tions to the rule without which
people like myself would always
feel alienated. I'm sure there
are a significant number of in
tellectuals at Stanford who feel
the need daily to get a serious
matter off their chests and re
late their concerns to other stu
dents. whether it be personal or
public. But all too often, like
myself, they are forced to buy
their concerns and think of
something else which fits the su
perficial intellectual mentality
so charactistic of this univer
sity. This is the curse of being an
intellectual at Stanford.

Most importantly, I use to be
lieve that it was at the univer

life, enriched by a daily interac

peers. The most controversial
issues of the day would be de
bated endlessly. Such elusive
topics as the "destiny of human

"the role of science and technol

be discussed enthusiastically
outside the classroom as well as
inside the classroom.
I don't know what I could have
been thinking at the time to
have fervently believed in the
intellectual purity, sophisti
cation and superiority of the
university environment. Maybe
it was the anticipation of getting
away from the awkwardness
and the pettiness which so char
acterized the high school en
vironment. Maybe I evoked the
image of the ancient Greek ide
al all too often when thinking of
the modern university. Maybe it
was the memory of my one day
visit to this university as a pros
pective freshman where I sat in
on a philosophy class and
watched many concerned Stan
ford students passionately and
thoughtfully take down notes

my illusions on this point are ef

stroyed. at least as far as this
university is concerned.

Of course, I admit, my expec
tations were far too high. After
all, a university is also supposed
to prepare students for specific
careers out in the real world
whether they give a damn about
humanity's destiny or not, or
whether they have an opinion on
the contemporary political and
economic situation. I don't dis
pute the fact that one must get a
job sooner or later some time
after graduation, or that usually
the quality of that job depends
on, to a large extent, specific
knowledge and skills acquired
during a university education.
But does this mean that the
academic environment at this
university must necessarily be
so blatantly anti-intellectual?
Does this mean that virtually all
discussion of "serious" matters
must be confined to the
classroom? Must there always
be some sort ot stigma as
sociated with a serious dis
cussion at the dinner table? I
mean by serious at least some
thing other than the Econ. I

Stanford nowadays (and the en

with all the admirable gaiety
and superficiality surrounding

me. The little conformist voice

I suspect an electrical engi

have more in common with each
other than they think. There are
things that affect all our lives
which we all have a common
task in understanding, and that
task requires serious intellec
tual discussion. If being in
tellectual is out of style at the
university level, then I hate to
think what it is like in other
levels of society. Indeed, if one
can't pursue a serious intellec

as Stanford then where can one?

to university life always be am

are a significant number of in

the need daily to get a serious
matter off their chests and re
late their concerns to other stu
dents. whether it be personal or
public. But all too often, like
myself, they are forced to buy
their concerns and think of
something else which fits the su
perficial intellectual mentality
so charactistic of this univer
sity. This is the curse of being an
intellectual at Stanford.
