# Billy the Kid's grave: the mystery solved
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Huntigton Beach, Calif. (API
— Billy the Kid was not known
for his sense of humor — his
principal amusement seemed to
be shooting people dead — but
even the notorious Old West out
law might have got a giggle out
of all the hoopla over the theft
and recovery of his tombstone.
The Kid's 200-pound granite
tombstone was filched from his
steel-fenced grave site in a dus
ty little cemetery just outside of
Fort Sumner, N.M., on the first
Sunday of February.
This stirred grave concern in
Fort Sumner, a farm town of
1800 whose main claim to fame
is that on July 14, 1881, Sheriff
Pat Garrett plugged the Kid
twice, fatally.
The folks of Fort Sumner
were worried because some
10,000 visitors came to gawk at
the Kid's grave each year — and
they expected thousands more
on the 100 th anniversary of the
big event Would they
come if the Kid's tombstone
wasn't there?
Well, not to worry.
Huntington Beach Detectives
Bob Russell and Ray Hat
tabaugh picked up the stone
Tuesday from the home of a
long-haul truck driver Walter
Nicolson, 25.
They found the house, the
name of the suspect and the
tombstone after a tip was tele
phoned to New Mexico State Po
liceman Marshall Warren and
De Baca County, N.M., Sheriff
John T. Mcßride and relayed to
Huntington Beach, which is
about 40 miles south of Los An
geles.
The tip, according to
Mcßride, was only that the
tipster had attended a party at a
house in Huntington Beach,
near the ocean, that he'd seen
the tombstone of Billy the Kid

there, and that the host of the
party was a long-haul truck
driver who sometimes passed
through Fort Sumner.
The suspected tombstone
thief, however, was on the road
in his truck. He was still being
sought on New Mexico warrants
for larceny and burglary late
Tuesday.
When news of the tombstone's
recovery got out, Hattabaugh
and Russell were deluged by
newsmen.
"We've caught murderers
before and nothing like this ever
happened," said Russell wryly
standing beside the tombstone
with his partner.
"Well," said Hattabaugh,
"It's a nice change — normally
we're recovering TV sets from
residential burglaries."
And they had a little fun with
their boss, the chief of detec
tives. They set up the Kid's
tombstone in his office and dec
orated it with flowers as a sur
prise when he came to work
Tuesday morning.
The detectives were de
lighted to be able to help out a
fellow lawman in what he ob
viously considered a big case.
"The sheriff told us," said Rus
sell. "that they considered this
tombstone theft just slightly
less serious than murder."
In a telephone interview,
Sheriff Mcßride said yessir, he
did think it was a pretty serious
piece of villainy, but not all that
close to being on a level with
murder/
"But it really was a big deal,"
he said. "They, the people in
town, was really upset. Now
myself, I'm a law officer, and I
always figured Billy the Kid as
just a gangster. But I guess it
was the history of the thing they
was concerned about."
