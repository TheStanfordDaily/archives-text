# Lallas: the wait is over
## 
### Steve Odell 
For Pete Lallas, the wait has been a long
one.
For the last three years, he has sat on the
Stanford bench and waited. And waited. And
waited.
He has waited for a chance to play Pac-10
basketball at Stanford and to prove himself
worthy of the responsibility that goes along
with the title. He has reason to be impatient. In
high school, he had been one of the top scorers
in the state of Oregon both his junior and senior
years,averaging well over 20 points a contest,
and had been named all-conference three
straight times.
And it was on this background on which he
packed up his basketball and books and headed
down to the Farm an optimistic young
freshman. He had good reason for optimism,
with head coach Dick Dißiaso commenting
before Lallas' rookie campaign that "Peter
has the potential to see considerable action this
year." Instead Lallas saw limited playing
time, and sat on the bench behind Wolfe Perry
and Paul Giovacchini. He played in only three
games, scoring two points for the entire sea
son. His sophomore season read like a carbon
copy of his freshman year, and his junior cam
paign was simply more of the same.
Lallas summed up his first three years of
Stanford basketball in one word: "Frustra
tion. I had got caught in a rut. I had tried ev
erything to get out of it." The senior from
Eugene. Oregon, knew that he had to make a
change or face another season of not playing
and thereby end his Stanford career on the
bench.
And it appeared as though that is exactly

where he would end his days as a Cardinal
eager, playing little in the first half of the sea
son. But then, one Thursday afternoon, head
coach Dick Dißiaso called Lallas into his of
fice. "Coach called me in and talked about the
improvements that he'd seen in my game,"
Lallas recalled. " He told me that I was start
ing. I was extremely happy and extremely ex
cited."
Lallas is trying to make sure his appearance
in the starting five is a regular occurence. In
his first starting assignment ever on the Farm,
Lallas responded with a career-high eight
points against Arizona. His personal mark
lasted only one day though, as the next night
against the tough ASU backcourt of Lafayette
Lever and Byron Scott, he pumped in 17 and
was the Cards' leading scorer.
"One of my roles is to shoot the ball," Lallas
said in explanation of his scoring outburst. "I
was just fired up and ready to play. I've always
been pretty confident in my ability to score."
Still, what prompted Dißiaso to go with a
senior who had limited playing experience and
a career scoring average of about two points a
game in a rebuilding year? Lallas thinks he
knows the answer.
"I made a deliberate effort to take four or
five months off from the game for the first
time in 10 or 12 years," Lallas said. "I really
took time to think things out.
"It's basically just been a change in at
tiitude," he continued. "I'm more confident
and relaxed. I feel more this year than any oth
er that I can really contribute and do some
things. It's basically a young team. I've been
around three and one-half years, and I view my
role more broadly now."
