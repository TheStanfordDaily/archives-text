With the graduation of two
All-Americas and no seniors
among the top six players, one
could at first glance write off
1981 as a rebuilding year for
Stanford's defending NCAA
champion tennis team. After
all. the same thing happened in
1979, when three juniors and
three freshmen finished third in
the nation, two below Stanford's
accustomed spot.
However, despite the loss of
Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne, there are several rea
sons why the Cards are pre
season favorites to pick up their
fourth NCAA title in five sea
sons.
Those three freshmen of 1979
are now seasoned juniors. There
are two sophomore returnees
from last year's starting lineup
at the NCAA tournament. The
lone freshman among the top six
is good enough to play No. 2
among thte r crowd.
At the center of what coach
Dick Gould called "a good nu
cleus" is junior co-captain Tim
Mayotte. The Cards' No. 1
player ran off 19 consecutive
wins in the middle of last season
before a late-season slump
curtailed his record at 28-5.
Last fall, the 6-foot-3 Mayotte
picked up where he left off, de
feating Jimmy Connors at the
Transamerica Open in San
Francisco. He's now No. 171 in
the world, as well as the highest
ranked amateur.
Right behind Mayotte is
freshman Scott Davis of Santa
Monica, who is, like Mayotte, a
proponent of the power game.
Davis won 24 titles as a junior
player and began his college ca
reer in like fashion yesterday.
Playing No. 1, he romped over
Tye Ferdinandsen &-3, 6-2 as the
Cards destroyed West Valley
College 9-0 at Stanford Stadium

(Stanford, 1-0, hosts USF tomor
row at 1:30 p.m.).
Had freshman Mike Falberg
remained at No. 3, there would
have three hard-hitters, but
Falberg hasn't even remained
on campus. Falberg stopped out
late last month after several
weeks of indecision about
staying at the University. Ac
cording to Gould, he is working
construction near his Santa
Barbara home and probably will
not be back this season.
Other starters include juniors
Scott Bondurant and Jeff Arons,
and sophomores Jim Gurfein
and David Siegler. Co-captain
Bondurant is the toughest com
petitor on the team, as he
proved in last year's NCAA title
match, when he came from be
hind to beat Cal's Phil Lehnhoff
in a third-set tiebreaker.
Arons. Gurfein, and Siegler
were starters last year, and all
three had successful summers
on the pro satellite circuits.
Siegler stopped out this quarter
to play a pro cirucit in New Zea
land, and will not be eligible un
til the third Pacific-10 Con
ference match of the season.
April 3 at Cal.
Maybe because of the Falberg
affair, Gould wishes Siegler
would hurry home. "They are
all improved from last year,"
Gould said. "But don't think it
will be easy if we lose Siegler
and Falberg."
It's alright, Dick. Siegler's
only gone for a few more weeks.
