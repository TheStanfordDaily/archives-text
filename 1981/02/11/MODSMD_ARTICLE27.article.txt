# Card 9 wins 6th in a row
## 
### Ralph Walker 
The Stanford baseball
team continued its winning
ways yesterday, rolling to its
sixth straight victory by
beating San Francisco State.
6-2.
Although it is still too early
to assess the full potential of
this year's squad, it is be
coming more and more ap
parent that when the Cards
open their Pacific-10 season
against Arizona on May 6.
they will sport a much-im
proved team.
Pitcher Paul Grame's per
formances thus far this year
are examples of this im
provement. En route to his
third Victory of the season,
Grame fired six shutout in
nings and allowed only two
hits, extending his streak of
scoreless frames to 20. The 6-

foot-3 senior, who nursed a
sore arm last year, equalled
his entire 1980 win total with
yesterday's victory.
Freshman Steve Cottrell fin
ished the game with three
strong innings of relief, ren
dering only one earned run on
one hit.
This early success of the
pitching staff, (which after
six games has an earned run
average of 1.21), has rubbed
off on the rest of the team.
Shortstop Dave Meier
commented on the effect of
the solid performances that
the pitching staff has turned
in so far. "When you are on
defense and you know that
the pitchers are doing their
jobs by getting ahead of the
hitters, it makes it a lot eas
ier and more relaxing to play
behind them."

Stanford's seven hit attack
was led by outfielders Mike
Dotterer (2-for-3, 2 runs, 1
RBI) and Mike Toothman
(two stolen bases and 3
RBIs.) The Cards jumped
out to a 2-0 lead by scoring in
each of the first two innings.
In the fifth, with Dotterer
on second and Bob DeCosta
on third. Toothman slapped a
ground ball up the middle. It
was flagged down by Gator
second baseman Dennis
Brickel, but when he bobbled
the ball. Dotterer came all
the way home to score on a
headfirst slide from second
base.
Stanford's next three con
tests will be against USF;
Friday they travel to San
Francisco for a single game,
and then Saturday, the Cards
host the Dons
