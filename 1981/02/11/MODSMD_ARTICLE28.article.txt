After feasting on hors
d'oevures such as Cal State-
Northridge and Santa Clara, the
No. 9 Stanford men's volleyball
squad takes a 6-0 match record
into the meat of their schedule
this week with the opening of
their California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association play.
And who eats who is foremost on
the Cards' mind.
Tonight Stanford hosts
fourth-ranked San Diego State
at 7:30 at Maples Pavilion
before USC comes to the Farm
Saturday. Assistant coach Don
Shaw said Stanford matches up
favorably with the Aztecs and
have a good chance of pulling off
a minor upset What he is count
ing on is teamwork, something
he said the Cards have excelled
in.
"I think this team is really un

usual in that they play so well to
gether." Shaw said. "Everyone
has gotten along so well togeth
er and the effort has been un
real." Stanford is a young team,
so the quicker they meld, the
better. Shaw said they lack
game experience.
"Junior Kip Engen is the
most experienced. We have one
senior. John McColl. but this is
only his second year on the
team." Shaw said. The re
mainder of the starting lineup
consists of sophomores Randy
Smith and Mark Reagan, and
freshmen Peter Shapiro and
Steve Saeta.
Right behind the starters are
seventh man Bob Dean and sen
ior defensive specialist Ruben
Nieves. "Without all eight
playing well, we won't be suc
cessful." Shaw said
