# Germans help Berlin Center expansion

Berlin — Stanford's once-faltering
overseas study center in this divided
city suddenly seems to be facing a
brighter future.
A new and unique fund-raising ef
fort has secured major contibutions
and internship offers from West Ger
man firms "at far higher levels than
U.S. firms." according to Ken Kauf
man . special assistant to the president
in charge of the fund drive.
The gifts have enabled the Overseas
Studies Office to begin planning the
expansion of the Berlin Center which
will include an Autumn quarter pro
gram for science and engineering stu

dents in preparation for paid in
ternships in West Germany during the
following Winter quarter.
The Overseas Studies Office is con
sulting the Engineering Department
to select a professor for the Autumn
1981-82 program, according to Direc
tor Mark Mancall. The department
has narrowed the choice down to a few
candidates, but has not reached a de
cision yet, Mancall said. The Autumn
program will also include non-science
students, he added.
Favorable response
Of several dozen firms which have
been approached, about one-half have
already responded favorably and only

one has refused, Kaufman said.
The Siemens Coumputer Co. has of
fered five summer internships for stu
dents studying at the Berlin center
this Winter or Spring quarters, and ne
gotiations have begun with other com
panies, including Henckel. Mobil and
Klockner Corp., Kaufman said.
He attributed the success of the on
going fund drive to the lack of private
universities in Germany, which would
otherwise compete for resources.
Surprising results
"They (the firms) were suprised to
hear from us, and we were surprised
at the results," Kaufman said during a
recent visit to Berlin.
The project is unique in several re
spects. he said.
—It's the first time an American
university has undertaken a major ov
erseas fund drive to support an ongo
ing overseas campus;
—The contributions will be in West
German marks and will be given
directly to the Berlin Study Center;
—The grants represent an un
precedented undertaking for West
German corporations, which other
wise do not directly support higher
education.
Founded in 1975, the Berlin program
has had a largely precarious ex
istence. In its first year it was housed
in a small office at Berlin's Free Uni
versity and co-existed uneasily with
two other German language residence

programs — the now-defunct
Beudelsbach program in West Germa
ny (Stanford's first overseas campus,
founded in 1958) and the Vienna center
in Austria, which is still in operation.
Feasibility study
In 1979 a feasibility study conducted
by Dr. Michael Oman for the Prov
ost's office gave a favorable outlook
for an overseas fund raising effort,
leading to Kaufman's appointment to
head the project.
Last year, Kaufman phased out of
his position administering the student
loan program for the Financial Aids
Office at Stanford and into his new
position, for which he completed three
trips to West Germany.
An important step in the process
was the founding of a Stanford Alumni
Club in West Germany last May, em
powered to receive contributions and
having, tax-exempt status. The seven
founding members include several
businessmen, such as club president
Peter Schlenzka, a principal partner
of the MacKinsie counsulting firm of
Frankfurt, Jurgen Schrader, presi
dent of the Lintas Corp., and Klaus
Zoellner, president of the Hoppecke
Corp., a battery producer. The club
also includes academic figures such as
Prof. Volker Rittberger of the Univer
sity of Tubingen.
