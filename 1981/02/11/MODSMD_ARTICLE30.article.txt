# Men's golf is on the way up in '81

The Stanford men's golf
team, under the tutelage of head
coach David Yates, appears to
be coming on strong after two
mediocre years. An indication
of Us revival was shown by the
team's strong finish at the re
cently concluded Fan-American
Invitational in Monterrey Mexi
co.
The Cards concluded the first
round of play in 16th place, but
moved up to 7th place by the end
of the tournament. Which was
an incredible finish, considering
that the top 15 teams in the na
tion were entered in the tour
nament.
Even more amazing was the
fact that three of Stanford's five
competitors--Doug Thompson,
Tim Robinson, and Lew Dickey,
were freshmen. And Jack Skill
ing. perhaps the team's best
player, was not a factor.
"We're an even better
team than the one we played like
down there,"said Yates. "Skill
ing was the co-medalist in the
Pac-10 last year and we had to
throw out his score."
Thompson, from Laguna Ni
quel, California, was the low
Cardinal scorer in the tour
nament, but is not yet estab
lished as the top player on the
team. "We don't really have an
established number one player.
Rather, we want to have all five
people playing well, which was
what happened in Monterrey,"
said Yates.
Why the big turn around from
the previous two years, when
the Cardinals could not even
qualify for the NCAA tour
nament? Yates thinks the rea
son for the improvement is a
change in the team's attitude.

"Last year everybody was
worried about how they did, and
never mind anyone else," he
said. He believes this year will
be different, "The difference
from last year is caused by the
attitudes of the three freshmen,
the attitude of Tad Buchanan,
our transfer from Rice, and the
attitude of Jack SkiHing. "
Skilling. who barely missed
the NCAA championships last
season, is considered by Yates
to be the leader of the team. "He
has always been a team player,
and has always had a great at
titude. He is a fantastic individ
ual, and a great captain." Skill
ing, Thompson, Buchanan, Rob
inson, and Dickey, will probably
compose the Cardinals best five
this season.
Fall practice low scorer Neil
Robinson, former Walker Cup
star Doug Clarke, and junior
David Games will also fight for
a spot in the top five.
And the outlook for the team?
The Pacific-10 is perhaps the
strongest golf conference in the
country. Thus, Yates is under
standably cautious when
assesing his team.
"We will not be able to com
pete with the strongest teams
week in and week out because
we stress academics. And you
have also got to remember that
we are one of the youngest
teams in the conference."
But while he is cautious, he is
also extremely optomistic. "We
have come a long way in three
weeks," he said. "Hard work,
dedication, and willingness to
sacrifice got us to where we are
now, and the kids can see that
we are headed in the right direc
tion. If we continue to improve
we will have an exceptional golf
team."
