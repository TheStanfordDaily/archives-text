Reagan spares seven programs
Washington — Seven popular domestic programs — including
Social Security retirement benefits. Medicare and veterans' pen
sions — will be spared in President Ronald Reagan's budget-cut
ting drive, the White House announced yesterday.
The other "untouchables" were school lunch and breakfast pro
grams for students from poor families, the Head Start program
for poor pre-schoolers. Supplemental Security income for the
needy aged or disabled, and the summer jobs program for teen
agers.
In another important decision, the White House announced that
the present formula for calculating cost-of-living increases in So
cial Security payments once a year would not be changed. The
Carter administration had recommended an alternative formula
that would reduce benefits to retirees by lowering the amount of
the inflation adjustment.
Together, the seven programs will cost $210 billion; they ac
count for about 30 percent of the estimated spending in the fiscal
year starting Oct. 1 in former President Jimmy Carter's final
budget.
The decision to exempt the programs from budget cuts, an
nounced bv White House Press Secretary James Brady, resulted
from Reagan's orders not to reduce essential services or benefits
for the "truly needy." Brady said.
Meanwhile, David Stockman, director of the Office of Man
agement and Budget, warned again that Reagan's proposed
spending reductions will be "very large and severe" and Secre
tary of the Treasury Donald Regan said they will be "painful."
Stockman said the deductions would total about $50 billion.
Announcement of the list of "untouchable" programs con
stituted both a bow to political reality and Reagan's reply to Dem
ocrats who have charged that his budget trimming was aimed
chiefly at the poor. Stockman reported at a Cabinet meeting that
consensus has been achieved among the Cabinet secretaries on 90
percent of the budget cuts that will be proposed when Reagan out
lines his plan to Congress on Feb. 18.
TMI operators may have witheld info
Washington — Operators of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant
in Pennsylvania may have intentionally withheld initial informa
tion from the government on the true severity of the March 1979
accident there. House investigators claimed yesterday.
In the early hours of the nation's most serious civilian nuclear
accident, plant managers supplied misleading data to state and
federal officials, the investigators' study added.
This alleged conduct by TMI employees could have jeopardized
the health and safety of area residents had "a major release of
radiation occurred," the investigators asserted.
The allegations, which appeared to at least partly contradict
other official investigations of the accident in placing blame,
were part of a 250-page report prepared by the majority staff of
the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee.
A spokesman for General Public Utilities, the parent New Jer
sey corporation, blasted the new study.
"This finding is 180 degrees from the president's commission
as well as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's investigation
into TMI." Dool said.
It was the first time any major investigative report on the acci
dent had alleged a deliberate withholding of information on the
part of the utility.
The report said control-room operators had many indications in
the early hours of the nuclear accident that the damaged reac
tor's core was seriously overheating — but did not convey this
data to state or federal officials.
"The lack of such information prevented state and federal of
ficials from accurately assessing the condition of the plant," it
said.
It said that the failure of government officials "to comprehend
the nature of the ... accident could have resulted in unnecessarily
high radiation exposures had the situation deteriorated to the
point where a major release of radioactive materials occurred. "
This was in the early hours of the accident.
The accident so badly damaged the reactor core that even now.
nearly two years later, the plant remains highly contaminated
with radioactivity.
American writer freed from Iran
Dubai, United Arab Emirates — American writer Cynthia
Dwyer flew out of Iran to freedom yesterday after a one-day mix
up in her deportation, leaving one American still captive of the
Iranians.
The 49-year-old Dwyer, a free-lance journalist imprisoned for
nine months and then convicted of espionage and ordered de
ported, arrived in Dubai on an Iranian plane loaded with peasants.

Met by U.S. Embassy officials, she was whisked away in a po
lice car without talking to reporters. She was due to fly on to
Switzerland and then to New York today for a reunion with her
husband and three children.
Her departure left Zia Nassry, an Afghan-born New York busi
nessman arrested March 8. as the last American ensnared in Iran.
He was seized shortly after he went there reportedly hoping to
make his way into Afghanistan to support rebels fighting the Sovi
ets. Nassry. 34. has been charged with spying
A State Department spokeswoman in Washington. Sue Pit
tman, said there were no government plans to hospitalize Dwyer
or debrief her as was done with the 52 American hostages freed by
Iran Jan. 20.
"Dwyer is well and has expressed a desire not to meet the
press," a U.S. Embassy spokesman said.
Her husband. John. 45, a college English professor, said at his
home in Amherst. N.Y., a Buffalo suburb, that he felt "terrific"
knowing she was finally free.
"There have been so many letdowns. It's a new feeling,'' he
said.
A sympathizer with the Iranian revolution. Dwyer went to Iran
last April to do some articles she hoped to sell in the United
States. She was arrested May 5, 10 days after the failed comman
do mission to rescue the U.S. hostages.
She pleaded innocent to espionage charges at her trial last week
and a Tehran newspaper said she had been drawn into a fictitious
plot to rescue some of the American hostages. Her husband said
she had been the victim of a "clear-cut case of entrapment."
Israeli government expands settlements
Jerusalem — The Israeli military government in the Occupied
West Bank is rapidly declaring thousands of acres of Arab
claimed property as public domain land for use in expanding ex
isting Jewish civilian settlements.
Palestinian lawyers and human-rights activists representing
West Bank landowners yesterday called the settlement expansion
drive the "biggest Israeli land grab'' since the 1967 war and
blamed it on statements by President Ronald Reagan that he re
gards settlements in the territory to be legal.
"I think that he gave the Israelis the green light," East Jerusa
lem attorney Elias Khouri said in an interview. "The government
knows it is going out, and it wants to create facts on the ground
before the (June 30) elections. They know that if a Labor govern
ment finds everything prepared, it will not cancel what has been
done,"
Military government officials said that the land in question had
been surveyed over the last several months and was found to be
without record of ownership, or with records that are so vague
that they could not withstand the scrutiny of a court test. Such
property is considered "state land" under Israeli law, and the
military governor, as acting sovereign in the West Bank, assumes
title.
Khouri said he will circulate an appeal in Israel's Knesset (par
liament) asking members to intervene "politically" with pres
sure on the Likud government, since, he said, the settlement ex
pansion will be completed before he can obtain hearings in court
on his appeals.
Ibrahim Matar, a Palestinian economist who helps West Bank
farmers in land cases, said the government of Prime Minister
Menachem Begin has been encouraged to seize more land for set
tlements by Reagan's press conference statements last week that
he disagreed with previous U.S. policy that West Bank settle
ments are illegal and an obstacle to peace.
Matar said Reagan's statement "reversed 13 years of official
U.S. policy toward Israeli settlements."
Palestinian sources said they were also discouraged by
statements by Labor Party leader Shimon Peres indicating that if
Peres is elected prime minister, he will not dismantle settle
ments and by what they called Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's
"aloofness" to the settlements problem
Cubans have trouble resettling
Washington — A month ago, Luis Valla dares, a 22-vear-old boat
mechanic who fled Cuba last summer, was practicing his English
in a class at Fort Chaffee, Ark. This week he was still studying
English, but his classroom was the Fellowship House Farm in
Pottstown, Pa.
After eight months of confinement in resettlement camps, he is
finally on his way to a sponsorship family, joining the 120.000
Cubans who have been resettled in the last several months.
There are another 4700 Cuban refugees still at Fort Chaffee,
however. Like Valladares, most are young, single black men with
few job or language skills and no friends or relatives in the United
States. Their chances for resettlement have been hurt too be
cause many have criminal records, some are gay and several hun

dred have been receiving psychiatric care.
Federal officials charged with finding sponsors for the remain
ing refugees insist that 70 percent can be resettled without major
difficulty. But the pace has been slow, fewer than 30 a day in Janu
ary. It costs about $400,000 a day to operate Chaffee, and the bill
for resettling the newcomers is expected to reach $720 million by
the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30
Experts who have dealt with other refugee groups say the
Cubans have been hurt as a group by the actions of a relative few.
There were several violent disturbances by the Cubans at Chaffee
and in earlier resettlement camps. And President Fidel Castro
used the boatlift from Cuba to expel many jail inmates and men
tal hospital patients. In addition, press accounts about the large
number of gays in the refugee population added to the bad public*
ity the Cubans received
Storm sweeps across country
Driven by high winds, the biggest storm of the winter swept
from the Rockies to the eastern Great Lakes on yesterday bring
ing blinding snow and bone-chilling cold that contributed to at
least seven deaths.
Tornadoes struck to the south, meanwhile, killing at least one
person in Texas and hitting a middle school in Alabama. Two of
the students, a bus driver and another employee were seriously
injured.
The snow — and the wind that made it feel like 40 or 50 below
zero in many places — stretched from Montana to Ohio, sending
shivers through more than a dozen states. Schools were closed
and officials pleaded with people to stay home and keep off icy
roads where drifting, blowing snow made it hard to see more than
a few feet.
The National Weather Service said a blizzard warning was in
effect yesterday for eastern Nebraska and added that near
blizzard conditions prevailed across Kansas and lowa. Winter
storm warnings continued in parts of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,
Michigan, Wisconsin and Kentucky.
Weinberger favors neutron bomb
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger declared
yesterday that he favors deploying neutron warheads in Europe
partly because they "could do quite a lot" to offset the Soviet ad
vantage in tanks along the NATO front.
Weinberger, in an interview with The Washington Post, thus
underscored his personal commitment to the weapon despite the
controversy that erupted in Europe last week when he first set
forth his position. The State Department felt compelled to cable
North Atlantic Treaty Organization capitals to reassure them
that Weinberger's remarks did not represent any change in the
government position on the weapon.
The new defense secretary stressed that he was still speaking
for himself, not President Ronald Reagan, since no formal ad
minstration decision has yet been made. He added that European
allies would be consulted before any deployment of neutron weap
ons took place.
Nevertheless, he repeated that he felt former president Carter
made a mistake by not going ahead with the production and
deployment of enhanced radiation warheads, especially since
NATO nations seemed ready to accept them, though in some
cases reluctantly.
Weinberger said he faults the Carter administration for its
"sudden withdrawal" in 1978 of its deployment plan. The "re
versal." Weinberger contended, "understandably confused and
angered the NATO allies, particularly Germany."
Asked if he favored deploying neutron warheads even if the
United States also deploys nuclear-tipped cruise missiles on the
ground in Europe. Weinberger answered in the affirmative. "The
enhanced radiation weapon adds a great deal to the strength from
a number of points of view, one of which is deterrence."
Reagan plans affect stocks
New York— Stock prices turned mixed yesterday as traders

nomic plans and the prospects for his success.
