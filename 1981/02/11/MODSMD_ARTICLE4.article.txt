# Polish strike ends; nation still in crisis
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Warsaw, Poland — Compromises
were reached yesterday to defuse a
general strike in southwestern Poland
and peasants' demand for an inde
pendent union, easing slightly the
crisis situation here.
And in Moscow and Washington, of
ficial government statements reflect
ed the continued concern with which
both nations viewed the unrest in Po
land.
In the province of Jelenia Gora,
where workers had gone on strike over
predominantly local issues, agree
ment was reached to turn over a Cen
tral Committee health resort to the
general health service until a new hos
pital can be built in the area. Govern
ment officials successfully resisted
demands to convert a newly built In
terior Ministry sanitarium to general
use.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court re
jected demands for a rural branch of
the independent trade union Solidar
ity. but left open the possibility of
peasants organizing "associations."
It is still unclear whether this lim
ited form of trade union will be enough
to satisfy the peasants who have been
demanding full parity with industrial
workers But Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa called the court decision a
"tie"and appealed to both farmers
and industrial workers to demonstrate
calm and order "so that no one can ac
cuse us of trying to unsettle things "
More changes
Meanwhile, the official news agen
cy PAP said that more government
changes will be announced at a parlia
mentary session beginning today.
Parliament will also be asked to con
firm formally the appointment of the

defense minister, Gen. Wwojciech
Jaruzelski, as premier in succession
to Jozef Pinkowski.
In Washington, the replacement of
Poland's civilian prime minister by
Jaruzelski was seen by the Reagan ad
ministration yesterday as a sign that
Warsaw's embattled government will
do what is necessary to control events
there and forestall a Soviet interven
tion — at least for the time being.
The dismissal of Pinkowski had
been expected by some administration
analysts here, and some officials went
so far as to welcome the elevation of a
general with a reputation for tough
ness and nationalism.
Situation precarious
In the longer run.the situation re
mains precarious. Reagan adminis
tration officials continued to play
down the possibility that the United
States would offer increased econom
ic aid and credits to Poland until its in
ternal problems are solved
At the same time officials em
phasized that the administration re
mains undecided on whether to take
any steps toward extending the sched
ule for Poland's loan repayments to
this country, as Polish authorities re
quested late last year. A large portion
of Poland's $1 4 billion indebtedness to
U.S. banks falls due for debt servicing
during 1981.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig
is particularly anxious to spike re
ports that he considers a Russian in
vasion an inevitability. He instructed
State Department spokesman William
Dyess to say that "we do not feel that
Soviet military intervention is immi
nent. inevitable or justifiable."
