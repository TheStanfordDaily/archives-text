# Trustees ponder additional mortgage assistance
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
The University Board of Trustees
was expected to approve an increase
in the faculty coinvestmnet mortgage
program (COIN) yesterday which
brings the total amount of funds which
may be Invested to *11 million.
The increase of $4 million to the pi
lot program which was established to
help faculty and staff members fi

nance home purchases, came before
the board's monthly meeting in San
Francisco yesterday. Although no
board members or University of
ficials were available for comment
last night, a background report to the
board .stated that fuitHcr mtudy will
also be given to possible revision of the
program, with a more detailed ac
count to be readv in the fall.

In other the business the board was
also expected to authorize the Vice
President for Business and Finance to
apply for a construction grant from
the National Cancer Institute (NCI* in
connection with construction of a Ra
diobio/o*r>' f».««vi fr'h BiiileJirtjz 4 J
though the estimated cost of tne new
building, which would be constructed
in the Governor's Avenue Complex, is
$8.8 million, the request to NCI is for
$2.7 million, because of the limited
funding available from that group.
In fact, limited funding from all
government-sponsored research
sources is likely to be a problem for re
search universities across the coun
try. Vice President for Public Affairs,
Robert Rosenzweig, said last week.
For instance the expendable budget
of the National Science Foundation —
which last year contributed more than
$24 million or 15 percent of Stanford's
research funding — is expected to be
limited severely by the new Reagan
administration.
Rosenzweig said when the presi
dent's budget is released later this
month, the University will better be
able to plan its course of action.
"Right now we're making it known
to decision-makers the consequences
of reductions of concern to us," Ro
senzweig said.
Rosenzweig added that while re
search budgets of organizations like
the NSF and NASA would experience
"sharp cutbacks", the University
would be able to balance this decrease
somewhat through increased Defense
Department funding.
One of the largest grants received
for the month of December, according
to the board's agenda, was a $5.1 mil
lion grant from the NSF to the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory for Operations, Research and
Dedicated Time research.
Scheduled for a meeting of the

board's finance and administration
committee was a discussion of "the
cost of attending Stanford."
According to Rosenzweig, the dis
cussion was to focus on two things —
the fact that the University was the
rdrrmt «r» fuif/on r/!»-
next academic year and the amount by
which the tuition was raised this year
and its relationship to the fees an
nounced by other universities.
"The board will examine whether
our early announcement puts us at a
disadvantage because it locks us into a
figure despite changing economic con
ditions," Rosenzweig said. However,
because of problems associated with
Stanford's budgeting schedule, it is
unlikely the announcement time will
be changed by the board, according to
University spokesman. Bob Beyers.
The board also heard a report pre
pared on fire safety at the University,
which, in addition to giving a history of
fires here, also stated "major
projects planned for accomplishment
within the next three years."
These projects include modification
of 140 elevators to comply with fire
and seismic codes, Hoover Tower
modifications — scope and cost as yet
undetermined — and installation of
fire sprinklers in eight old row houses.
Also presented was an account com
piled by Deputy Fire Marshal Clifford
M. Johnson, on the Storey House fire
last March. Clifford's assessment of
the cause of the fire was stated as fol
lows:
"It is the opinion of this deputy that
this fire was caused by bed and
furniture being in direct contact with
the electric heater, which did not al
low the heat to dissipate in a normal
manner. This in turn broke down the
insulation on the electrical wiring on
the interior of the heater, causing a
short to occur. The insulation and
paint inside the heater were then ig
nited and heat was transferred to com
bustibles that were .1 close prox -

of reductions of concern to us," Ro
senzweig said.
Rosenzweig added that while re
search budgets of organizations like
the NSF and NASA would experience
"sharp cutbacks", the University
would be able to balance this decrease
somewhat through increased Defense
Department funding.
One of the largest grants received
for the month of December, according
to the board's agenda, was a $5.1 mil
lion grant from the NSF to the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory for Operations, Research and
Dedicated Time research.
Scheduled for a meeting of the

board's finance and administration
committee was a discussion of "the
cost of attending Stanford."
According to Rosenzweig, the dis
cussion was to focus on two things —
the fact that the University was the
rdrrmt «r» fuif/on r/!»-
next academic year and the amount by
which the tuition was raised this year
and its relationship to the fees an
nounced by other universities.
"The board will examine whether
our early announcement puts us at a
disadvantage because it locks us into a
figure despite changing economic con
ditions," Rosenzweig said. However,
because of problems associated with
Stanford's budgeting schedule, it is
unlikely the announcement time will
be changed by the board, according to
University spokesman. Bob Beyers.
The board also heard a report pre
pared on fire safety at the University,
which, in addition to giving a history of
fires here, also stated "major
projects planned for accomplishment
within the next three years."
These projects include modification
of 140 elevators to comply with fire
and seismic codes, Hoover Tower
modifications — scope and cost as yet
undetermined — and installation of
fire sprinklers in eight old row houses.
Also presented was an account com
piled by Deputy Fire Marshal Clifford
M. Johnson, on the Storey House fire
last March. Clifford's assessment of
the cause of the fire was stated as fol
lows:
"It is the opinion of this deputy that
this fire was caused by bed and
furniture being in direct contact with
the electric heater, which did not al
low the heat to dissipate in a normal
manner. This in turn broke down the
insulation on the electrical wiring on
the interior of the heater, causing a
short to occur. The insulation and
paint inside the heater were then ig
nited and heat was transferred to com
bustibles that were .1 close prox -

The University Board of Trustees
was expected to approve an increase
in the faculty coinvestmnet mortgage
program (COIN) yesterday which
brings the total amount of funds which
may be Invested to *11 million.
The increase of $4 million to the pi
lot program which was established to
help faculty and staff members fi

nance home purchases, came before
the board's monthly meeting in San
Francisco yesterday. Although no
board members or University of
ficials were available for comment
last night, a background report to the
board .stated that fuitHcr mtudy will
also be given to possible revision of the
program, with a more detailed ac
count to be readv in the fall.

In other the business the board was
also expected to authorize the Vice
President for Business and Finance to
apply for a construction grant from
the National Cancer Institute (NCI* in
connection with construction of a Ra
diobio/o*r>' f».««vi fr'h BiiileJirtjz 4 J
though the estimated cost of tne new
building, which would be constructed
in the Governor's Avenue Complex, is
$8.8 million, the request to NCI is for
$2.7 million, because of the limited
funding available from that group.
In fact, limited funding from all
government-sponsored research
sources is likely to be a problem for re
search universities across the coun
try. Vice President for Public Affairs,
Robert Rosenzweig, said last week.
For instance the expendable budget
of the National Science Foundation —
which last year contributed more than
$24 million or 15 percent of Stanford's
research funding — is expected to be
limited severely by the new Reagan
administration.
Rosenzweig said when the presi
dent's budget is released later this
month, the University will better be
able to plan its course of action.
"Right now we're making it known
to decision-makers the consequences
of reductions of concern to us," Ro
senzweig said.
Rosenzweig added that while re
search budgets of organizations like
the NSF and NASA would experience
"sharp cutbacks", the University
would be able to balance this decrease
somewhat through increased Defense
