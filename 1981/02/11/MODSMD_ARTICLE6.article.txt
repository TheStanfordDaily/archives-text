# Journalists discuss experiences and dilemmas
## 
### Sally Newman 
Working under deadlines measured
in seconds, choosing between "self
censorship" and expulsion from South
America, and resisting special in
terest groups' attempts to influence
edtorial policy were some of the
dilemmas cited by journalists Joanne
Omang and Judy Robinson, who ad
dressed visiting Communication lec
turer David Burnham's Media Ethics
and Responsibilities class here yester
day. 1
Omang, who writes for the Wash
ington I'ost after working as a UPI re
porter in South Dakota, Springfield,
Massachusetts, and Boston, told of
some of the special obligations of a
wire service reporter. "You've got to
get stuff on the wire as soon as it hap
pens.-' she said Prior knowledge of
the subject is not a factor, she added
To illustrate the point Omang re
lated the story of a federal grand
jury's decision to not indict Senator
Edward Kennedy on the Chappaquid
lick incident. After running up the hill

from the court building to the UPI bu
reau office reading the just obtained
official report."The second I stepped
out of the elevator, my editor barked
for my lead. I typed it out. and he had
his hand over my typewriter, grabbing
the copy as soon as I finished to give to
the wire operator.
"The operator typed it in—and in
stantly asked for the rest of the
story!"
The story was completed—by ne
cessity—within the half hour.
One problem which is common in
both news and editorial writ
ing,according to both women, is per
sonal bias. According to Robinson,
being a professional means surmount
ing that by "doing the job you were
hired to do as well as possible without
regard for your personal view." She
said that this can present difficulties,
especially in editorial writing where
the personal views of a reporter must
be subordinated in order to "reflect
the views of the newspaper, its pub
lisher and editors."

"I was never asked to write some
thing with which I strongly disagreed.
Most newspapers probably follow that
general rule," said Robinson, who
sees the role of editorials as "teaching
and informing while giving an opin
ion."
After UPI work and an 8-year stint
as a legislative assistant for Sen.
Gavlord Nelson. Robinson became an
editorial writer for the Son Francisco
Examiner where she remained for a
year and a half.
"I felt that it suited my talents bet
ter."she said. "Editorial writing is
more graceful (than writing news for
a wire service), and you can write
what you feel knowing that lots of peo
ple will read it."
Deadline pressure, considerably
lighter by comparison than that of the
editorial board, "can really manipu
late the news," according to Omang
During the confirmation hearings of
Interior Secretary-designate James
Watt, for example, Senator Gary Hart
was not given the floor until deadline

was approaching, at a time when most
reporters were away writing their
stories. His quesion raised an issue
which, if widely publicized, could have
been harmful to Watt's bid for con
firmation
As Washington I'ost correspondent
in South America from 1975-77. Omang
found herself in a position which made
questions of deadline seem like child's
play. "There were 23 countries to cov
er and I felt like I should know what
was going on in all countries all the
time," she said.
Additionally, the military regimes
in Chile. Argentina, and elsewhere in
South America did not allow for an ov
erwhelming margin of error While
there. Omang said that she "learned
to distrust everyone. "
Tales of intrigue and derring-do
aside, however. Omang offered some
unequivocal advice for aspiring jour
nalists ' Write, and try to get your
stories published — n nyfvhvro, it
doesn't matter." she said.
