## Jones overcomes opposition; remains Joint Chiefs head 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” Gen.
David Jones has survived a
campaign by some Republican
conservatives to oust him as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger told The Associated
Press on Monday that President
Ronald Reagan has accepted his
recommendation that Jones
complete his term, due to end in
a little more than 16 months.
"General Jones will remain
on in the normal course," Wein
berger said.
He added that the president
agreed with him that Jones' re
tention "really wasn't an is
sue."

Some conservative Re
publicans who backed Reagan
for the party's presidential
nomination sought to make
Jones an issue as long ago as last
summer.
Led by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-
N.C.) the conservative group
accused Jones of too readily
supporting Carter adminis
tration policies which they con
tended weakened the country.
Jones drew fire from this
group because he supported the
Carter adminstration's push for
ratification of the Panama
Canal treaties and the SALT II
nuclear arms limitation agree
ment with the Soviet Union.
They criticized him. too, on

grounds he did not fight hard
enough for the B-l bomber,
which Carter scrapped in 1977.
Removal of Jones by the new
president would have been un
precedented. Former defense
secretaries James Schlesinger
and Harold Brown both warned
against such action, saying it
would "politicize" the highest
military post in the U.S. govern
ment.
Senior military officers and
retired officers who were less
than enthusiastic about Jones'
performance opposed the idea
of retiring him before his term
was up.
Jones, who served as Air
Force chief of staff in the Nixon,
Ford and early Carter adminis
trations. has acknowledged he is
"a team player" but has argued
"that is the best way to get
things done and to have in
fluence" within an adminis
tration.
