# Brown readies state with fake quake
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — Saying the
question is not whether a
catastrophic earthquake will hit
California, but rather when it
will occur. Gov. Jerry Brown
took steps Monday to prepare
Californians to cope with such a
disaster.
Brown established a state
emergency task force on earth
quake preparedness to imple
ment the recommendations of
an ad hoc group he named last
November. Dr. William
Whitson. a Brown assistant who
was director of the ad hoc
group, also will head the task
force.
The task force will have 32 ad
visory groups. One will focus on
methods of mobilizing and
training neighborhood self-help
teams, which would shoulder
the burden during the first 24
hours after a quake, when com
munications, transportation
routes, emergency services and
other life-line networks are dis
rupted.
Brown asked the Legislature
for $4.5 million to begin the
quake preparedness program.
but added. "This thing is going
to cost a lot more before we are
finished." ,
However, he noted, "We have
(spent) billions defending for a
war. which is a contingency; a
catastrophic earthquake is a
certainty. It will kill thousands
of people and we're not ready

for it."
• Brown's action Monday
marked the 10th anniversary of
the San Fernando Valley quake,
which, although "moderate" in
seismic terms, caused 58 deaths
and about a half-billion dollars
damage.
As the governor signed the ex
ecutive order in the state office
building here, government
agencies were testing their pre
paredness plan with a simulated
8.3 magnitude earthquake on the
San Andreas Fault in Southern
California. Officials now say
there is a greater than a 50 per
cent chance of such a quake dur
ing the next 30 years.
The simulated quake was pat
terned after the great earth
quake of 1857 in which a 220-mile
section of the San Andreas Fault
ruptured.
In Monday's simulated ex
ercise the estimated casualties
were indeed catastrophic: 2790
deaths; 11.160 injuries, hospi
talized; 68.280 unhospitalized in
juries; 44.000 persons
homeless; $1.5 billion damage.
In addition, two dams were
assumed to have failed, causing
another 7520 deaths and an addi
tional 211,500 homeless.
Nineteen hospitals were de
stroyed; 88 had major damage;
and all functioning hospitals
were overwhelmed by the
caseloads.
