Your help is needed in obtaining an accurate and represen- [|J
tative picture of what this experience has been like for you p
as a university student. If you are an undergraduate j—
whose parents have separated or divorced at any time |@
during your undergraduate experience (or within the six |j|)
months prior to your entering Stanford), we would like you ra]
to contact us for participation in a research study of how this bj
has affected you. To get a clear idea of how parental
separation or divorce affects university students, we would |t=
like your input regardless of whether this was an easy or [j|]
difficult experience for you. Participation in this study re- rg
quires only completion of a brief confidential questionnaire, .-g
with an optional one time follow-up interview. If you are lU
interested in participating or would like more information, [©
please contact Lois Quesada, Counseling and Psychologi- J||
