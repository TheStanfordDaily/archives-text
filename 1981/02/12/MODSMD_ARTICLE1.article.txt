# SPA forum discusses labor tactics
## 
### Richard Klingler 
" We ought to get hold of our money,
and we ought to get hold of our de
cisions," said a local labor leader as
he addressed the forum, "Labor
Unions and Worker Control:
Progressive Analyses and Strategies
for the '80s" last night in Kresge
Auditorium.
Michael Nye, a member of the AFL
CIO Central Labor Council for Santa
Clara County, joined two other speak
ers in addressing an audience of about
80 people at the forum sponsored by
the Stanford Progressive Alliance and
the Stanford Committee on Political
Education as part of their series.
"What now America? Progressive Al
ternatives for the '80s."
Workers must realize that invest
ment capital is "not somebody else's
money, but our own money," accord
ing to John Harrington. Chairman of
Governor Jerry Brown s Task Force
on Public Investment. He said that
employee capital in public and private
pension funds totals more than $650
billion and will probably top $4 trillion
by 1995.
Harrington predicted that workers
increasingly will be able to use their
funds for community projects, hous
ing loan financing, and accomplishing
political goals such as less U.S. invest
ment in South Africa and Korea.
"How we can get more people in
volved in running a corporation on a
day-to-day basis" is as important as
control of capital, said Dave Olsen,
founder of the New School for Demo

cratic Management and consultant for
labor-management committees
across the nation.
Olsen emphasized the need for
worker participation toward more
democratic control and for discussion
between workers and management in
addition to collective bargaining.
Workers seldom consulted
Linda Brickman, a member of the
Community Labor Information Cen
ter, moderated the forum and said
that workers are seldom if ever con
sulted by management on any matter.
"Workers have darn little to say"
about what is produced, where pro
duction takes place, how money is in
vested, and other corporate decisions,
agreed Nye.
Olsen suggested that labor-man
agement committees on general, de
partmental, and work-site levels can
increase worker autonomy as well as
"address problems of waste and inef
ficiency." Both labor and man
agement can gain from worker partic
ipation, he said.
Olsen s system in San Francisco's
public sector is effective "especially
at the grass-roots level; that's where
the project is designed to work."
As long as workers have guarantees
against reprisals and lay-offs," Olsen
said, "employees have ended up with
a lot more freedom."
Public service productivity is
almost impossible to measure quan
titatively, according to Olsen, and one
of the benefits of the labor-man

agement committee discussion is a
human rather than purely statistical
measure of services.
'Money talks'
All speakers emphasized the power
that accompanies control of money.
Harrington said,"Believe me, money
talks." .
He stressed the influence over so
cial issues that follows workers' con
trol over their pension funds. Not only
can workers benefit directly from
their own funds, but they can also con
trol investment overseas, in nuclear
power, and especially in their own
communities.
Workers' funds will soon be the pri
mary source of corporate investment,
according to Harrington. These funds
are crucial because "morality plays
no part of a fund manager's decision."
Unions changing
Nye cited three current union
trends: leadership turnover, union
mergers, and expansion of sources of
organization.
The leadership of all major unions is
changing rapidly, and leaders are
being drawn from all sections of the
population. Unions of all sizes are
merging, he said, and unions are in
creasingly organizing public, service,
and farm workers.
Nye outlined three areas of worker
control in the coming decade. The fun
damental strategy for worker control
of investment decisions will be sup

piemen ted by attempts to bring public
ownership to non-competitive sections
of the economy and by initiatives to at
tain public control of basic industries,
he said.
Frank Manfredi, a grizzled and
dignified-looking local union member,
rose from the audience at the end of
the concluding question and answer
session, and spoke of his long union ex
perience :
"I've had my head cracked open in
the Ford strikes ... the only reason
you have the standard of living you
have is because of the sacrifice of lives
in the coal, iron, and steel industries."
