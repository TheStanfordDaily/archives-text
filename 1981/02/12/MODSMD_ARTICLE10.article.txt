# OAU eyes Chad vote

### Los Angeles Times 
N'Djamena, Chad — The Lib
yan-backed government of Chad
has said it may be willing to ad
mit a multi-national com
mission into the country to help
supervise national elections,
Edem Kodjo, secretary general
of the Organization of African
Unity, said after meeting with
Chadian officials.
Kodjo emphasized, however,
that the Chadian government's
major current preoccupation is
with its own security, now
bolstered by the presence of
Libyan troops. He said major fi
nancial and material problems
must be resolved before elec
tions can be held in the country,
poor and weak after 15 years of
civil war.
Kodjo met for two hours last
week with Chad President
Goukouni Oueddei, and held
talks with Foreign Minister
Ahmat Acyl, considered the
strongest pro-Libyan voice in
Chad's government.
Kodjo said Goukouni, a 37-
year-old former guerrilla lead
er from northern Chad, ex
pressed clear displeasure over a
declaration by 13 OAU heads of
state made in Togo on Jan. 15,
decrying Libyan intervention in
Chad's civil war and calling for
an immediate withdrawal from
Chad by Libyan troops. The ma
jor push for that declaration
came from neighbors of both
Libya and Chad who view the
ambitions of Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafi with great
suspicion.
"President Goukouni was dis
turbed by the declaration,"
Kodjo said. "He felt he should
have been consulted." It is
Goukouni's position, Kodjo
added, that the Libyans were in
vited into the country.
OAU concerns rose with the
announcement Jan. 6 that Libya
and Chad had effected a
"merger." The announcement
followed entry by Libyan troops
into fierce fighting for
N'Djamena, which appeared
about to fall to rebel leader
Hissen Habre, Chad's former
defense minister.
Habre is chief of one of sever
al guerrilla bands whose pro
tracted warfare has divided this
country.
Khadafi is seen as a spoiler by
outsiders, including most mem
ber states of the OAU. At one
time or another the Libyan lead
er has backed 10 of the 11 fac
tions that have quarreled over
Chad in the last 14 years.
Kodjo said he agrees with
Goukouni that Chad's problems
cannot be resolved from outside
the country. Goukouni told him
that the Libyan soldiers would
leave Chad when there is no
longer a "security problem."
Unofficial but reliable
sources reported that Khadafi
plans a trip here within 10 days
and that he might meet Niger
ian President Shehu Shagari
during his stay in N'Djamena. It
was impossible to confirm the
reports in N'Djamena.
