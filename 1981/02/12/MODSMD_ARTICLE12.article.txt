# Historians 'hard-sell' their product

"You can't do without history
if you are a human being," said
Pulitzer Prize winning History
Prof. Carl Degler Tuesday
night. That endorsement of his
tory's importance was typical
at the forum, "Why Study His
tory?" held at the Branner Hall
lounge — although Degler clas
sified his approach as more
"hard-sell" than his col
leagues'. Prof. Peter Stansky,
chairman of the History Depart
ment, and Prof. Peter Paret
joined Degler in the presenta
tion.
Admittedly, said Stansky,
history does not lead directly to
a professional field. But, he
said, if one caters to the im
mediately practical, maybe 20
years later one may feel that
one has made a mistake. His
tory teaches the important
skills of analysis, research, and
writing perhaps more than the
other liberal arts. As well as
providing intellectual training,
history teaches marketable
skills.
Each of the history professors
discounted the often-stated no
tion that students ought to study
history because it teaches les
sons or can be used to predict
the future, especially Paret,
who stated with characteristic
simplicity, "I don't believe in
that."
The historians, all believers
in a liberal arts education, felt
that the learning of professional

skills is not the prime purpose of
a college education. "Your four
years here," said Stansky,
"should be pertinent experience
for your future, but not direct
experience." Stansky added
that students should major in
what they're interested in.
Paret agreed, prefacing his
remarks by saying. "I'm not at
all sure that one ought to major
in history. I see it as neither
more nor less valuable than any
other field." He added, how
ever, that he considers it an ex
tremely valid part of a liberal
education.
Degler, who won a Pulitzer
Prize for his book on slavery and
race relations, Neither Black
nor White, disagreed with the
others about the benefits of a
major in history. In making
what he called "the hard-sell
approach," Degler offered six
reasons to show that "it is es
sential for any liberated person
to know history and be con
cerned with it." History, he
said:
— provides perspective, so
that we can compare the pres
ent, such as the crime rate, with
the past;
— provides an idea of why
things are the way they are, and
how they developed that way;
— helps understand possi
bilities for change;
— leads to an understanding
that the world was not always
the way it is today, and that in
other times, values were radi

cally different;
— shows that change can be
very slow;
— proviiic's kciontity : "Without
history," Degler said, "each of
us is nothing."
The last reason, he said, is the
most important. "An individual
who has lost his memory has
nothing. History is the memory
of society. When we study his
tory. we can understand
progress, and understand who
we are." To know what it is to be
an American, Degler offered as
an example, we study American
history.
History, Degler said, must be
real and nol mythical, so that
we study the unpleasant as well
as the good, and the losers as
well as the heroes.
Paret, apparently discussing
the same issue, remarked that
history is distinguished among
all the social sciences by "the
atrocious way" in which it is
taught in high school.
This manner often promotes
mythical conceptions of history,
such as the mistaken idea that
all Europeans came to America
in a search for religious free
dom.
Following the brief remarks
which opened the forum, the
three professors answered
questions from the audience.
The forum was the first of a
planned series to be held every
other Tuesday evening in the
Branner lounge. Each presenta
tion will deal with a different ac

ademic field, according to Bran
ner RA and history major Mark
Swanson, who will coordinate
the programs. The sched
uled for February 24 at 6:30
p.m., will deal with the ques
tion. "Why Study Philosophy?"
Other fields planned for in
clusion in the series, which will
run into spring quarter, are Lit
erature, Physics, and Econom
ics.

years later one may feel that
one has made a mistake. His
tory teaches the important
skills of analysis, research, and
writing perhaps more than the
other liberal arts. As well as
providing intellectual training,
history teaches marketable
skills.
Each of the history professors
discounted the often-stated no
tion that students ought to study
history because it teaches les
sons or can be used to predict
the future, especially Paret,
who stated with characteristic
simplicity, "I don't believe in
that."
The historians, all believers
in a liberal arts education, felt
that the learning of professional

skills is not the prime purpose of
a college education. "Your four
years here," said Stansky,
"should be pertinent experience
for your future, but not direct
experience." Stansky added
that students should major in
what they're interested in.
Paret agreed, prefacing his
remarks by saying. "I'm not at
all sure that one ought to major
in history. I see it as neither
more nor less valuable than any
other field." He added, how
ever, that he considers it an ex
tremely valid part of a liberal
education.
Degler, who won a Pulitzer
Prize for his book on slavery and
race relations, Neither Black
nor White, disagreed with the
others about the benefits of a
major in history. In making
what he called "the hard-sell
approach," Degler offered six
reasons to show that "it is es
sential for any liberated person
to know history and be con
cerned with it." History, he
said:
— provides perspective, so
that we can compare the pres
ent, such as the crime rate, with
the past;
— provides an idea of why
things are the way they are, and
how they developed that way;
— helps understand possi
bilities for change;
— leads to an understanding
that the world was not always
the way it is today, and that in
other times, values were radi

cally different;
— shows that change can be
very slow;
— proviiic's kciontity : "Without
history," Degler said, "each of
us is nothing."
The last reason, he said, is the
most important. "An individual
who has lost his memory has
nothing. History is the memory
of society. When we study his
tory. we can understand
progress, and understand who
we are." To know what it is to be
an American, Degler offered as
an example, we study American
history.
History, Degler said, must be
real and nol mythical, so that
we study the unpleasant as well
as the good, and the losers as
well as the heroes.
Paret, apparently discussing
the same issue, remarked that
history is distinguished among
all the social sciences by "the
atrocious way" in which it is
taught in high school.
This manner often promotes
mythical conceptions of history,
such as the mistaken idea that
all Europeans came to America
in a search for religious free
dom.
Following the brief remarks
which opened the forum, the
three professors answered
questions from the audience.
The forum was the first of a
planned series to be held every
other Tuesday evening in the
Branner lounge. Each presenta
tion will deal with a different ac

ademic field, according to Bran
ner RA and history major Mark
Swanson, who will coordinate
the programs. The sched
uled for February 24 at 6:30
p.m., will deal with the ques
tion. "Why Study Philosophy?"
Other fields planned for in
clusion in the series, which will
run into spring quarter, are Lit
erature, Physics, and Econom
ics.
"You can't do without history
if you are a human being," said
Pulitzer Prize winning History
Prof. Carl Degler Tuesday
night. That endorsement of his
tory's importance was typical
at the forum, "Why Study His
tory?" held at the Branner Hall
lounge — although Degler clas
sified his approach as more
"hard-sell" than his col
leagues'. Prof. Peter Stansky,
chairman of the History Depart
ment, and Prof. Peter Paret
joined Degler in the presenta
tion.
Admittedly, said Stansky,
history does not lead directly to
a professional field. But, he
said, if one caters to the im
mediately practical, maybe 20
years later one may feel that
one has made a mistake. His
tory teaches the important
skills of analysis, research, and
writing perhaps more than the
other liberal arts. As well as
providing intellectual training,
history teaches marketable
skills.
