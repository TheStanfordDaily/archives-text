Amid charges of racial and
sexual tokenism in Stanford's
hiring policies, panelists at the
Feminist Speakers' Series
Tuesday night discussed the
problems of making sexual
equality a day-to-day reality in
the workplace.
Attempts by Stanford to hire
women and minorities who
"don't rock the boat" have
marred the University's af
firmative action goals, accord
ing to Lise Giraud, University
librarian and member of USE.
Giraud charged that this
amounts to a kind of tokenism
that defeats the purpose of af
firmative action.
"I have a gut hatred of op
pressed groups who become op
pressors," said Giraud. "Op
portunistic women (who use the
women's movement solely for
their own benefit), racist Jews,
kind of management blacks who
then step on the face of other
blacks. I confess that the in
stitution loves such women.
"Very seldom Stanford hires
somebody who is not like that
. . . There are noble exceptions
but their role here is not an easy
one. This sort of tokenism beau
tifully satisfies Stanford."
Giraud charged that the ad
ministration was more con
cerned with its public image
than with actually making good
on its commitment to bring ra
cial and sexual equality to cam
pus.
"This is a favorite phrase in
the administration: 'to look
clean.' "said Giraud. "In ad
ministrative circles I have nev
er heard the word 'justice' pro

nounced. The concern is: 'do we
look clean?' "
Giraud also said that Stanford
only hired women and minor
ities who are from more privi
leged backgrounds.
"Stanford's affirmative ac
tion policy is not exactly this
business of: give me your poor,
your oppressed, your huddled
masses,' " she said sarcastical
ly. "We don't want any huddled
masses here."
The librarian also lashed out
at several University officials,
calling one female attorney
here "one of the biggest anti
feminists around." She also
charged a black former dean
with what amounted to bigotry.
Other speakers at the sym
posium, which was sponsored
by the six cooperative houses on
campus, dealt with the dif

ficulties of maintaining their
feminist ideals while at work
within the system.
Patricia Brandt, assistant
dean of student affairs, said that
"there can be problems dealing
with a hierarchy situation when
you're in it."
Brandt said that Stanford is
still governed along patriarchal
lines that prevent women from
attaining any power to control
their lives here.
"I still worry a lot about the
family model that I see so much
around the University," said
Brandt. "There's a man who
makes the decision about the
money, about the policy. The
women work very, very hard,
often harder than the men who
are their bosses. They have the
power of influence, the power of
hard work, but not the power of
power."
Jane Benson, co-director of
SWOPSI, spoke of feminism as a
way of life.
"For me what feminism does
is to apply political concerns to
day-today life."
Benson spoke of feminism as
a movement that is opposed to
"any institution that enforces
unequal power relationships on
the basis of sex or race.
"By definition." said Benson,
"feminism is anti-capitalist."
Benson made a distinction be
tween her ' job" and her

work
The way she earned her mon
ev, she said, was of less im
portance than her work as mem
ber of the women's self-defense
collective, and non-racist, non
sexist New Seed Press publish
ing business and other feminist
concerns. These activities
earned her little or no money,
but furthered her political
goals
Voicing her own personal per
spective was Terri Owen of the
Office Staff Organizing Com
mittee which engineered the
vote for unionization of office
workers here, scheduled for
May 7.
"The organizing effort (at
Stanford >." Owen said, "is very
much a women's issue."
Owen likened the patriarchal
traditional home life and its op
pressions to a patriarchal Stan
ford administration.
"You find yourself in a patri
archal situation at home, and
you find the same patriarchal
situation at work. (Organizing
workers at Stanford) involves
almost the same consciousness
raising issues.
"The move to unionize is the
same move a woman makes in
her home, " Owen said. "You
become an actor in determining
the process of what is going to
happen to you. You gain a cer
tain power."
