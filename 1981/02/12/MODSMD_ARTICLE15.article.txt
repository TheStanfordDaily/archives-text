# 'Non-serious' candidate gains popularity
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Paris — About 50 candidates have now de
clared their intention to run in the French
presidential election three months from
now, but only one has the candor to declare
that he has no qualifications for the job, and
the humor to proclaim that he will flee to a
Caribbean island if elected.
He is Coluche, a 36-year-old music-hall
comedian who packs them in nightly at a
long-running one-man show in a Paris thea
ter, and now says that he has signature
pledges from 632 French mayors for a presi
dential nominating petition.This is more
than enough to ensure that his name will ap
pear on the ballot in the first round of voting
April 26, if he clears other electoral hurdles.
"I don't want to be president, but I do
want the guys playing politics to realize that
politics today is as dead as (unprintable).
As for politicians, they're a pain in the rear.
Everybody says my candidacy is not seri
ous." he told Lo Monde, France's most seri
ous newspaper,"but what does not serious
mean? It means that it's a bloody pain,
that's all. My candidacy is important the

moment I scare candidates because 1 might
take votes from them."
Given the fact that all of the "serious can
didates" for the presidency are politicians
whom the French have been looking at and
listening to for 20 years or longer, Coluche is
a breath of air — whether fresh or foul — on
the political scene.
Nobody expected that Coluche would be
able to gather the necessary signatures to
make the ballot — a process that is certain
to eliminate probably two-thirds of the 50 or
so who have declared their candidacy so far.
Moreover, all of the candidates must also
pass a screening by a group called the Na
tional Campaign Control Commission,
which is charged with ensuring that the
election is conducted with dignity — the
very opposite of what Coluche is doing.
So he has not quite made it yet, but in the
meantime he is certainly a popular can
didate, and his name is often heard in the
bars where taxi drivers, plumbers and ga
rage mechanics gather day and night for a
glass of wine.
However "serious" his candidacy turns

out to be. Coluche is making his mark in the
early public-opinion polls. One poll has put
him at 12.5 percent and another at 18 per
cent, and he says that he is polling 23 per
cent among unemployed voters.
"President Valery Giscard d'Estaing is
helping me with this category," he says.
Asked if he wasn't making a farce of the
democratic institutions of France, he re
plied without a smile: "You can only ridi
cule the institutions because they can be rid
iculed."
If Coluche does pass the constitutional
hurdles to get on the ballot as an official can
didate. he will be entitled to free television
time, the same as Giscard d'Estaing and all
the others who will be running. He makes no
bones about what this will be worth to him.
As for where he stands politically. Col
uche says that he is certainly on the left —
"for the guys who are never represented by
political parties, the taxi drivers, hair
dressers, homosexuals, farmers. ... I am
the candidate of the minorities, and if the
minorities are placed end to end they be
come the majority."
