## Editorial Reagan toast overstated 
### 
President Ronald Reagan greeted visit
ing South Korean President Chun Doo
Hwan last week with friendly praise and
promises of U.S. support for his regime. In
a toast, Reagan proclaimed, "In the short
time you've had, Mr. President, you've
done much to strengthen the tradition of
3000 years' commitment to freedom." For
Americans concerned with human rights,
Reagan's toast ignored the political re
pression that has continued in South Korea
under the Hwan regime.
Hwan's declaration of martial law in
South Korea last year and his recent im
prisonment of one of his country's leading
political figures, Kim Dae Jung, show lit
tle concern for human rights. Kim, a long
time critic of the Park and Hwan regimes,
was forceably abducted from a Tokyo ho
tel, taken back to Korea, and tried for sub
version. Hwan's influence apparently
helped secure a death sentence for Kim.
Two weeks ago, Hwan, under heavy
pressure from the United States, com
muted Kim's sentence to a life term. He

also ended martial law before leaving on
his scheduled visit to the United States.
Reagan found these actions sufficient to
praise the Korean leader for his demo
cratic ideals.
While South Korea and the U.S. may
share a community of interest, they do not
yet share a community of values. Reagan
postponed the publication of the annual
state department report on human rights
conditions in foreign countries until Hwan
left Washington. The study, which came
out early this week, contained information
in marked contrast to Reagan's rosy
assessment of the South Korean govern
ment.
When our nation's top leader announces
before the world community American
support of such an undemocratic regime,
the credibility of our commitment to polit
ical rights is severely diminished. Ameri
cans and others can rightlv question our
dedication to the principles of freedom
when we consider Hwan's feeble gestures
a sign of democracy.
