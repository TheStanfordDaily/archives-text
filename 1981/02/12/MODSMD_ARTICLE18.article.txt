LOTS worse
As I sit here at my desk, con
templating the work that I have
to do in the immediate future. I
realize that I will be seeing a lot
of sunrises this week. What is it
that keeps me from joining the
rest of humanity in sleeping at
night? Have I bitten off more
than I can chew academically?
Have I neglected to properly
budget my time? Unfortunate
ly. the answer is not something
so easily rectified. Is it some
thing over which I have no con
trol. I am one of the unfortunate
multitude. I take computer sci
ence.
Anybody who has ever taken a
course in this field knows that
there is one factor that over
whelmingly contributes to the
hellishness of this course of
study - the LOTS system. I am
told by those who know better
than I that LOTS is not an ex
tremely advanced computer
system, but that it is adequate
for the educational purposes
that it is catted on to serve. 1
don't have to ask anyone, how
ever, to know that LOTS is being
badly abused.
LOTS is overcrowded. Ev
eryone knows this, yet the situ
ation is allowed to become
worse every quarter No other
computer system that I know of
has three-hour waits to gain ac
cess to a one and a half hour ter
minal session. No other system
that I know of crashes as often
as LOTS.
Since there is a direct rela
tionship between the reliability
and speed of LOTS and the size
of the computer science classes,
there would seem to be only two
viable alternatives. One would
be to reduce the size of the com
puter science classes, but this
doesn't seem in keeping with
Stanford tradition. Human Sex
uality is taught in Mem Aud.
presumably because it is a popu
-1 a r class. Physics and
Chemistry are broken up into
several sections for the same
reason. It seems that Stanford
prefers accommodation, rather
than limitation and reduction
for popular courses.
That leads us to the more de

sirable solution: the expansion
of LOTS. LOTS was originally
created to relieve overcrowding
on the SCIP system. LOTS is
now in the same situation. Un
fortunately. it exists in a twi
light zone between the com
puter science and education de
partments. This being the case,
repeated efforts at obtaining ad
ditional funds for expansion
have come up empty handed.
I hereby invite anyone who
has ever waited over 90 minutes
for a terminal, anyone who has
ever enjoyed the sight of dawn
over CERAS, anyone who has
ever 'had volumes of effort
nullified when the system
crashed in the middle of typing a
file, anyone who has ever sat in
front of a terminal waiting for it
to respond to a command with
the sure knowledge that a pencil
and a pad of paper would be
much quicker, and anyone who
has to use LOTS, to put a copy of
this letter in an envelope and
send it to the Acting Provost Al
bert Hastorf in Building 10, to
encourage the University to
look \nto this matter.
If we just sit back and wait,
it's only going to get worse.

I am sorry President Donald
Kennedy considers it a mistake
for the office and clerical work
ers at Stanford to form their
own bargaining unit of the Unit
ed Stanford Employees. It
would be grand it we could be
supported as we move to take
responsibility for and be in
charge of our lives in a mean
ingful economic way.
As we gain for ourselves in
creases in our wages adequate
to compensate us for the con
tribution we make to Stanford;
assurances of compensation for
overtime work; retirement ben
efits which relieve our ever
present fears of post-retirement
poverty; fair grievance pro
cedures which by their very ex
istence in the administration's
consciousness will lead to better
working conditions (thus lessen

ing grievances); and op
portunities for training and ad
vancement to motivate and in
crease our very real pride in
being Stanford University em
ployees. students, professors,
administrators and workers,
and related community mem
bers. will all prosper and profit.
I am not a new employee, nor
a young person who does not ap
preciate Stanford's gentle am
biance. Working here as a secre
tary since 1959.1 have grown in
awareness of economic as well
as other strengths available to
those who reach out and join
with others in honest effort for
mutual benefit.
I see the office and clerical
workers unions now forming all
across the nation as providing
new opportunities for workers,
especially women, to gain eco
nomic strength and dignity for
themselves and then to use their
new strength to help their fami
lies and communities.
That's the ultimate that
prompts me to join the Stanford
workers' union. I look forward
to the May 7 election, when that
"ultimately" will arrive in the
form of our union.
