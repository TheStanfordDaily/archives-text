# Italian graduates face scholarship delay
## 
### Cathy Janus 
Approximately 36 Bay Area Italian
nationals, including a graduate stu
dent here, may have their studies in
America interrupted because the Ital
ian government has failed to send
promised scholarship money.
Gian Luigi Bellin, a graduate stu
dent in philosophy, won a two-year,
$10,000 per year scholarship from the
Italian Council of Research. He said
he has had to borrow money from
friends in Italy and from Stanford in
order to continue working toward his
PhD.
The Italian Council of Research,
which operates laboratories in Italy
and funds students' research abroad,
was supposed to forward the scholar
ship money last September. Bellin
said.
When he didn't receive the money.
Bellin said that he contacted the Ital
ian Consulate in San Francisco, which
acts as an intermediary between the
government and the students in the

United States.
After communicating with the Ital
ian Research Council, the consulate
informed Bellin that because of red
tape and the added complications
caused by the Italian earthquake dis
aster last fall, he may not receive the
money until June.
Bellin said "my situation is not an
exception, but the rule." The Italian
government is "ineffective and ir
responsible" because of the "political
stagnation" to which citizens there
have grown accustomed, he said.
Another Italian national working
toward his PhD in mathmatics here
received his scholarship money just
last week, Bellin said.
The Foreign Students Advisor at the
Bechtel International Center,
Mitchell Hall, said he called the Ital
ian Consulate and asked them to ex
tend a loan to Bellin. The Chancellor
for the Consulate, Guido Basile, said
that the consulate "couldn't offer him

(Bellin) a loan because we don't have
enough money for our own operating
expenses at this point."
A question of time
Hall said he then recommended that
Stanford's Office of Financial Aids
give Bellin a short-term loan because
"it is just a question of time before the
money will be sent."
Chancellor Basile said that he is
trying to find the reasons for the de
lays, but that when he calls or sends
cables and telegrams he receives no
reply.
"We are frustrated by the prob
lem," he said.
In previous years students have had
problems getting their scholarship
money, Basile said, but not until last
year did all students have difficulties.
Bellin said he came to Stanford be
cause one of his professors in Sweden
advised him that its combined, inter
disciplinary program with the philoso

phy and mathematics departments is
the best in the world. Bellin had stud
ied in Sweden for one year.
Receive funds
Italian graduate students receive
funds to go abroad for their education
because there is no established PhD
program in Italy, he said Because a
PhD isn't required to teach in the uni
versities, Bellin said that he could re
turn home and teach if he wanted to.
However, he said he wants to master
his field before beginning his career.
Foreign students comprise 22 per
cent of all graduate students here.
These students are heavily dependent
on aid from their governments, the
U.S. government, fellowships from
businesses and aid from foreign uni
versities, according to Hall.
In the past, other foreign students
have had to wait for their scholarship
funds. Hall said. Such complications
as the Iranian situation put many stu
dents under financial pressures, he
said.
