## Anorexiphiliac diets are hard to swallow 
### 
Is mastication a social dis
ease?
"Oh my God, they're out of
Tab!" The horror, the horror. A
gallon of Tab. but neigh a drop of
Coke. The calories, the calories.
'Roast beef?"
"No."
"Potatoes Lyonaise?"
"No, just give me a teaspoon
ful of the creamed spinach."
The disease, you've seen it,
you know the symptoms: the
bottle of Lo-Cal salad dressing
that's taken to class, on the
town, to bed; the salad syn
drome; the 50 calorie a day lim
it. the dreaded libidic fantasy,
for ice cream, pizza, an eclair.
The very weakness of the soul
that Plato found counter to the
good is spreading. The un
heralded epidemic of modern
day anti-mastication has ar
rived: the ultimate fear of
frying, that constant preoccupa
tion with food, diets, weight,
and calories, anorexiphilia.
"Oh my God. I can't do the
Special-K pinch! I've got to lose
at least ten pounds today."
Sound familiar? Let's think
about dieting for a moment. If
you eat a single slice of bread
each day that exceeds the
amount of food you burn off,
how much more will you weigh
in 20 years? 5 pounds? 10
pounds? Actually 200 pounds. A
single slice of bread extra a day
for 20 years will add up to 200

pounds.
So. 20 years from now you dis
cover, "Wow, I'm 200 pounds
overweight. I think I'll cut out a
slice of bread from my diet."
Bingo, you've reduced your food
intake, will you lose weight? No.
you'll simply stay the same, 200
pounds overweight.
"Wow, my diet's not working,
I'll cut out 2 pieces of bread."
What initiative, what daring and
self sacrifice. Unfortunately, it
will take 20 years to lose the 200
pounds that took 20 years to
build up.
The dieting psyche is the first
battleground. The human body
is designed to exist in an
equilibrium of weight. Eating
correctly does not increase this
equilibrium weight. Eating fa
natically, eating 4 boxes of Cap
tain Crunch, or worrying with a
constant preoccupation about
weight can cause this
equilibrium to flutter.
"But I can't eat anything, I'll
gain weight if I eat anything."
If eating is thought of as a
"refueling" or a "supplier of
necessary chemical sub
stances" rather than a socio
emotional gestalt experience
with overwhelming guilt de
pression. the first step toward a
reasonable equilibrium is being
taken.
"All I have to do is smell food
and I gain weight."
If the "smelling food vapor
adds pounds" syndrome is a

problem, then the equilibrium
has to be considered. If your
body is literally trying to gain
weight, then you could be forc
ing your body out of equilibrium
with an unusually low weight.
The mental anorexiphilia that
strikes terror in the hearts of
eaters is an ascetic disease.
Flagellation, hair shirts, and
the Chronic Diet syndrome are
all cousins. The anxiety that
once ushered in the corset, the
macro heel, and a myriad of or
thopedic horror has now
glorified the 19 inch waist.
The chronic diet yo-yo strug
gle is even more amusing.
"Well, I've starved myself to
102 pounds, a little ice cream
won't hurt. A little ..."
If there is any solution to the
prevailing social disease, it
must be a product of sensibility
and reason. If you chew so fast
that one bite is being swallowed
while another is being chewed,
you are probably eating with a
punk rock tempo. Baroque is
much more efficient. Savor
each bite; food service may not
allow such a strategy, but at
tempt. Chew slowly, not like a

grey squirrel or Appaloosa.
The most important key to
any equilibrium is to listen-to
your body. The "hungerstat"
like a thermostat will signal
when enough is enough. Don't
eat until you're "full" but until
you're no longer hungry. There
is a difference, often a vast dif
ference.
Exercise. Keep the heart ac
tive. An active body establishes
an equilibrium, unlike a sloth
like, sedate lump of flesh.
Think positively. Don't over-
Tab and manic depressive
thoughts of looking like a
Bollard. Think about yourself in
terms of equilibrium, when you
can eat reasonably until you are
no longer hungry, and remain at
the same weight, your ideal, un
contrived weight.
Try bran and fiber. Fiberous
foods (whole grains, celery,
fiber breads, corn) add very few
calories and provide filler so
you do not feel hungry.
Most importantly, don't carry
Lo-Cal Italian to class; oil and
polyester don't mix.
