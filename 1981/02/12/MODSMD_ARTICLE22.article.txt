## Real defense of freedom is domestic affair 
### 
Bill Wray's angry diatribe
against those of us who ad
vocate resistance to the draft
and to foreign interventionism
(I)aily, Feb. 2) gravely mis
represents both our position and
current realities.
For example. Wray suggests
that our opposition to foreign in
tervention rests on the belief
that the right-wing autocracies
generally supported by the U.S.
are worse than left-wing auto
cracies.
As Wray notes, that belief is
false. If anything, left-wing dic
tatorships are a bit more brutal
and authoritarian than right
wing dictatorships. For exam
ple. the Pol Pot regime in Cam
bodia murdered more people
than did the Shah.
Our opposition to foreign in
tervention does not rest, as
Wray implies, on the belief that
leftists are more humane than
rightists: indeed, we are not
much interested in the numbers

game of whether rightists such
as Hitler, the Shah, and Somoza
slaughtered more innocent peo
ple than did leftists such as
Stalin, Mao, and Castro.
Rather, our opposition to for
eign despots of any sort dese
crates and negates the ideals of
liberty which America once
symbolized. The U.S. policy of
supporting any dictator opposed
by radical leftists has en
couraged the peoples of the
world to believe that the only
choice lies between tyranny of
the right and tyranny of the left.
There can be neither peace
nor freedom on this planet until
that belief is rejected and until
people recognize that there is a
third choice beyond left and
right â€” the choice of a society
which rejects all varieties of
tyranny and which recognizes
individual rights and human lib
erty.
America's primary duty to
the world is to serve as a beacon

to illuminate this truth: that a
free society with a political sys
tem responsible to the people is
both possible and desirable. The
policies which Wray defends
have denied and obscured this
truth and therefore constitute a
gross neglection of America's
duty.
Wray justifies his general
tone of angry intolerance with
the claim that he, an officer in
the U.S. Army, is nobly and un
selfishly defending the freedom
of all of us against foreigners
who threaten our freedom.
Where are these hordes of for
eign devils, eager and able to in
vade the United States, against
whom soldier Wray will defend
us?
The fact is that they do not ex
ist except in Wray's fantasies.
No foreign power poses any re
alistic threat to American free
dom. Thanks to the good fortune
of our geography, few nations
need to fear invasion less than

America.
In short, we do not need sol
dier Wray and we owe him no
gratitude for playing soldier at
the taxpayers' expense.
The real defense of freedom
begins at home. If American lib
erty is ever extinguished, it will
be not by foreign bogeymen but
through our own negligence and
irresponsibility.
The true defense of liberty
consists not of play soldiers but
rather of unceasing vigilance in
defense of freedom and in
transigent opposition to govern
ment encroachments upon our
liberties. The preservation of
liberty in America requires that
we inform ourselves of the
many (often well-intentioned)
attempts to diminish freedom;
that we engage in political ac
tivity to oppose those who would
sacrifice liberty in the name of
security, expendiency, or his
torical necessity; and that we
seek to deepen public under

standing of the nature of free
dom and strengthen public sup
port for free institutions.
These democratic responsi
bilities may often seem less ex
citing and heroic, more realistic
and mundane, than Wray's fan
tasies of defending American
freedom with rifle and bayonet.
Nonetheless, these responsi
bilities are the real price of lib
erty.
Unlike Wray, I believe that
even those persons, such as
Wray himself, who refuse to
bear the responsibilities of free
dom have, nevertheless, the
right to be free. But we should
recognize that their freedom is
the fight not of boys like Wray
playing soldier but rather of
men and women who pursue a
realistic commitment to pre
serving Americans' liberty.
