## A 						liberal education, wealth and happiness 
### 
" ... an education which
broadens the students' knowl
edge in each of the major areas
of human knowledge ..."
Another quote from some un
realistic liberal, or perhaps a
cute but useless remark from
Thoreau. right?
Wrong Actually, this is the
stated philosophy of Stanford
University, a philosophy that
emphasizes a liberal education.
However, it appears that Stan
ford's policy has become mere
ly philosophic rhetoric and this
idealistic education has been
surpassed by the "practical"
education. The education for
jobs.
The purpose of an education is
difficult to define, but it is time
that we all defined, on a person
al level, the importance and ob
jective of our education.
Why are we here? Why are we
in college at all 0 And most im
portantly. what do we expect to
accrue from our education?

These are seemingly simplistic
questions, yet they are ques
tions that rarely receive enough
serious thought.
It seems that many students
caught up in the hustle and bus
tle of our competitive world
have made their educational ob
jective not to learn but to get a
good job - good implying well
paying. Case in point, might be
the recent onslaught of "prac
tical" majors - economics, engi
neering, etc. — while the once
aspiring humanities continue to
wither away.
Similarly, when one is pre
paring a study list the most fre
quent question is: "How hard is
the class?" Or perhaps, is
there a lot of reading?" Rarely
is it, "How much will I learn?"
Ironically, the original
purpose of education, for one to
learn and to expand the mind, is
often disbanded because learn
ing generally implies hard
work, and many students would
rather get good grades, work

less, and party more.
The recent fervor over the
Western Culture requirement is
a prime example. Students dis
like the series not because they
are not learning — to the con
trary. the vast knowledge ac
quired through the series is gen
erally overlooked — but because
it requires a large amount of
reading.
A further example is the
ASSU "cliff notes," although
produced as a supplemental aid
for the student, they are often
used as a substitute for class.
Many students feel they no long
er have any need to go to class
because they have lecture
notes.
What this adds up to is the ori
ginal purpose of education
thoughtlessly obscured by stu
dents seeking good times and a
good job Thus, many students
fail to take advantage of the
vast opportunities at Stanford,
often restricting themselves to
classes thev are familiar with

and are guaranteed to do well in,
and venturing outside their ma
jor only to meet the require
ments. The end result often
being a good job with little
knowledge.
1 am by no means suggesting
that everyone should major in
the humanities — they
shouldn't Instead, it is critical
for students to construct a liber
al program of study of taking
classes from many depart
ments. searching for challeng
ing classes, experimenting, and
most importantly, majoring in
what one enjoys most, not what
pays most.
An education is designed to
prepare one for life, not merely
a job. Its objective is to teach
people to think and evaluate, not
to memorize and regurgitate It
is important that we ask
ourselves whether we are truly
learning here and striving to tap
our maximum potential, or just
going through the motions,
meeting requirements, and

counting the days until gradu
ation.
This is not to suggest that a
good job and knowledge are
mutually exclusive, for they
certainly are not But when a
student begins to place too much
emphasis on grades and jobs
and begins to fear experiment
ing. it becomes time for him to
analyze why he is here, in terms
of both an education and in the
larger sense, our life.
Internal happiness must still
play an important role in our de
cisions. The old adage, "To
thinfc own self be true," may
never be more true than now
The decisions we make during
these four years will dramati
cally shape our future and our
happiness.
Perhaps it is time we injected
a bit of personal idealism into
our reality, for aren't dreams
the foundation for our reality?
