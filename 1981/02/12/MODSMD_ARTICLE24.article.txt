# U.S. lags in aid-to-wealth ratio
## 
### Associated Press 
U.S. foreign aid, once the gold
mine of world development, is
in an accelerating decline at a
time when such other industrial
democracies as Japan and West
Germany are setting higher and
higher goals for their aid pro
grams.
Among the top half-dozen
donor nations of the West, only
Britain, under Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's austerity
program, has joined Washing
ton in whittling away at its fi
nancial assistance to poorer na
tions.
As a result of the current aid
skid, the United States now
ranks 15th among 17 nations in
ratios of aid-to-wealth. The 17
countries are the major aid
donors of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and De
velopment, a grouping of in
dustrialized democracies.
Official American develop
ment aid in 1979, the last year
for which comparative
statistics are available, totaled
$4.7 billion, which equaled one
fifth of 1 percent of the U.S.
gross national product. Only
Austria, with an aid program
equivalent to .19 percent of
GNP, and Italy, at .08 percent,
were lower.
The most generous donors
statistically — Sweden, the
Netherlands and Norway — all
topped the .9 percent-of-GNP
level, almost five times the U.S.
rate.
The United States remains
the biggest single contributor of
foreign aid. In dollars, the Swe
dish, Dutch and Norwegian pro
grams together totaled barely
more than half the amount of
U.S. aid.
But specialists in the field re
gard the aid-to-GNP ratio as the
most meaningful indicator of a
government's generosity.
They point out, for example,
that the GNP of the United
States equals the GNPs of
Japan, West Germany and
France combined, but those
three countries together spend
twice as much on foreign aid as
Washington.

In its report for 1980, tie
OECD's Development As
sistance Committee conclude::
"there appears to be no present
c hance" that OECD donors will
collectively reach the United
Nations' goal of .7 percent of
GNF in aid by 1985. The commit
tee largely blames the United
States.
The outgoing Carter adminis
tration proposed a foreign-aid
budget of $8 billion for fiscal
1982, which begins next Oct. 1.
but President Ronald Reagan's

Office of Management and
Budget has suggested cutting
that by $2 6 billion, for a budget
of roughly $6.4 billion.
The State Department and
OMB have been working on a
compromise that is expected to
>e announced this week.
The proposed cuts drew
citicism from such U.S. allies
as West Germany, France and
Caiada. Liberals in Congress
als» assailed the planned cut
backs.
