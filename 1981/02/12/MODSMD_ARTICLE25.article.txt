# Libel suit verdict stuns the art world
## 
### 
Boston (AP)â€” Artists are
quaking at their palettes over a
$30,000 libel award made recent
ly by a New York civil court jury
in the curious case of "The Mug
ging of the Muse."
The verdict, under appeal by
painter Paul Georges, resulted
from an allegorical canvas
showing three men with drawn
shivs pouncing on an ill-clad
maiden from a darkened alley,
while nearby a winged angel
watches and a fire hydrant
gushes blood.
Artist Georges called it"The
Mugging of the Muse."
Fellow artists Anthony Siani
and Jacob Silberman called for
their lawyers. They claimed
two of the muggers bore a dis
tinct resemblance to them, and
the libel jury agreed to the tune
of $30,000.
Other artists painting in a re
alistic mode worry that the
judgment against Georges, who
denied any intention of libeling
his colleagues, may set off simi
lar suits from people unflatter
ingly depicted in paintings or
claiming to see themselves in
side a picture frame.
Anyhow, it's the biggest court
suit to hit the art world since
James McNeill Whistler
hollared for his mouthpiece to

silence John Ruskin. But that
was a caie of painter going after
critic, n4 a subject after an ar
tist.
Famousportrait sitters have
resorted tc violence in the past
but rarely to litigation to even
the score with a painter.
Winston Chjrchill, it was re
vealed aftei his death, put his
admiralty word through a
portrait dont of him by a noted
member of the Royal Academy.
"It made melook as if I were
having a dittcult stool," Sir
Winston compained to W. Som
erset Maughan.
A Sunday printer of more
than passable tilent, Churchill
always was harl on fellow ar
tists. especially he moderns.
Getting back o "The Mug
ging of the Muse" I wonder if
it's too late to sutthe photogra
pher who took my ?irst Commu
nion picture. It vas my moth
er's favorite, but I've always
hated it. It show: me looking
pale and surly in ; short pants
blue serge suit con
spicuously spotted, the resit of
getting car sick in a trolley to
the portrait studio. A touch of
the airbrush in the lame of al
legory might have sived me for
posterity from tie camer
aman's ruthless realism.
