## Resnais' Oncle comes to America 
### Jim Mattson 
For all the discussion in film
theory about using the camera
as one might use a pen (the cam -
era-stylo), there have been rela
tively few attempts to compose
an essay with film. Most movies
employ the medium's capacity
for inducing visceral, emotional
impact, and its discursive abili
ty has been neglected.
But Man Oncle d'Amerique,
which opened in the Bay Area
last weekend, goes a long way
toward showing that film can be
equally powerful in presenting a
structure of ideas. This is the
latest in a series of exceptional
film essays by director Alain
Resnais.
Resnais' other works include
Last Year at Marienbad, a won
derfully complex examination
of the relationship between
place and memory, and
and Foil, which juxtaposed two
Auschwitzes: as it was during
the Holocaust and as it existed
in serene decay 10 years later.
These films reflect a fixation
with the process by which point
of view creates different, but
equally "valid," visions of the
world.
It comes as no surprise, then,
that Man Uncle d'Amerique
deals with the present as it is af
fected by the past. At the mov
ie's beginning, Resnais in
troduces three characters, and
through flash-back and flash
forward he shows how their
present situations are a product
of their histories. To this,
Resnais adds another, less-ex
pected element in the form of an
impartial observer who com
ments on the characters' ac
tions. For much of the film, we
are encouraged not to identify
with, but to look at, the people
on the screen.
This "impartial commen
tator" is a real-life psy

chologist, Henri Laborit. Labor
it plays himself, and he ex
presses his own theories about
the formation of human behav
ior patterns. His appearance,
and the aura of authority he
brings, lends this fiction film a
peculiar, slightly distorted am
biance. The suspension of dis
belief associated with the nar
rative film is transformed into
something which requires more
effort on the part of the viewer:
almost unconsciously, we try to
apply Laborit's proposals to the
actions we see the characters
perform.
Resnais returns again and
again to the psychologist; it is
sometimes unclear whether the
characters' actions prompt La
borit's comments or if their ac
tions are prompted by his com
ments. Much of the film's power
is derived from exploiting this
tension between documentary
(Laborit's commentary), and
narrative (the characters' in
volvements).
It is impossible to forget that
there are two intellects, and two
creative egos, at work in Man
(>ncle d'Amerique: the one that
belongs to Laborit and, more
powerfully, the one that belongs
to Resnais. The images the di
rector supplies do not "il
lustrato" the psychologist's the
ory — and, when image matches
text exactly, the effect pro
duced verges on satire.
Laborit describes how rats,
when placed in a situation of
stress, with no way to attack the
real cause of their disturbance,
will attack each other. Resnais
supplies a number of visual in
terpretations of this idea. First,
we see laboratory rats reacting
in the manner Laborit has de
scribed. Then, we see the char
acters reacting in a way that
mirrors the way the rats have
reacted. Finally, Resnais car
ries the idea one step further:

we see the performers in rat
costumes. The literalness of the
interpretation distances us
from the movie, and we begin to
see what can happen when theo
ries appropriate for rats are ap
plied too rigidly to human
beings.
Resnais uses Laborit's theory
to create a structure for his
film-essay; the psychologist
supplies the framework of su
perficial veracity that can sup
port the director's more am
bivalent concerns. Although
Resnais cuts repeatedly to the
psychologist through the course
of the film, he also supplies a
subtext: clips of old movies
which have structured, and
which reflect, the characters'
motivations.
Resnais presents three people
whose lives intersect briefly,
and this time of intersection
forms the "present" portion of
the film. But we also see the sep
arate pasts which bring them to
gether, and we see the environ
ments which have contributed
to their successes and their
anguish. In his other films,
Resnais has equated place and
recollection of place; here, he
adds a third factor to the for
mula. With the film clips, not
only do we see where the char
acters are and have been, we
see them as they would like to
be.
Roger-Pierre plays Jean Le
Gall, a man who was born on the
island his grandfather owned
and who matures to become
news director for French Radio.
He worships movie-siren
Danielle Darrieux; he tries to
imagine what she would do if
she were in his place.
Nicole Garcia plays Janine
Gamier, a woman who was
raised a communist, became an
actress, and finally becomes a
textile designer. For a time, she
is Jean Le Gall's mistress. She

idolizes screen-star Jean Mara
is; she sees his face when she
makes love.
Gerard Depardieu plays Rene
Ragueneau, a man born the son
of a devoutly Catholic farmer
who grows up to become a
devoutly Catholic manager at a
textile plant. Nicole Garcia be
comes his superior in the textile
firm. Ragueneau styles himself
after Jean Gabin; we see a clip
of the movie star whenever the
manager feels himself to be
most put-upon.
All three actors give fine per
formances. Depardieu (best
known to American audience
for his roles in J 900 and Get Out
Your Handkerchiefs) has a gift
for seeming exactly "right;"
with his crooked face and
farmer's body, he is the least ac
torish of actors. All capture
something of Resnais' vision of
a world made up of equal parts
of biological imprinting and
movie-fantasy dreams.
The tension between
documentary and narrative
gives M<m Oncle d'Amerique
its resonance; the distance be
tween where the characters are
and where they would like to be
gives the film its dry, some
times-bitter humor.
The greatest Irony comes
with the title itself. All three
characters speak of hearing
about a legendary American un
cle who has found success and
happiness in the New World.
The imaginary splendor of this
oncle d'Amerique is a factor
which Laborit has forgotten, but
which Resnais has not. Ameri
can uncles and movie-heroes
represent a faith in something
— anything — greater that is es
sentially human. Only when
even this petty faith is aban
doned does a theory as logical,
and as chilling, as Laborit's be
gin to seem appropriate.
