# Ballet merely 'nice'

### Mary Walp 
The San Francisco Ballet is a promising com
pany, full of well-trained dancers who show great
technical and intellectual potential. However,
they rarely rose above mere niceness Thursday
night at the War Memorial Opera House in San
Francisco. For the most part, the dancers per
formed very well, but the main problem of the
evening was the choreography.
The program opened with Balanchine's Diver
timento No. 15. This classical ballet is a trite, typ
ically Balanchine work uninspired and
monotonous. A series of affected solos by both the
men and the women, followed by similar pas de
deuxs, were adequately danced by the company
members. However, the corps could have used a
few more rehearsals to clean up their lines and
their synchronization. It was occasionally hard to
tell if the dancer's movements were mistaken, or
if the choreography called for them to be slightly
off. Just before the finale, the women performed a
series of divertessements in front of the corps who
occupied themselves with silly port dc bras - an
annoying error that drew attention away from the
soloists.
Some relief from the limited style of the Diver
timento came with Psalms, a ballet celebrating
the Jewish community and its traditions that was
accompanied by the San Francisco Boys' Chorus
singing Leonard Bernstein's Chichester Psalms.
Gladstein's choreography evokes the strong
bonds that tie the Jewish culture together, and a
sense of unity could be felt among the company as
a whole, as well as between each pair of dancers.
Goldstein's choreography permitted the com
pany to shine, and to prove that, given the chance,
they are able to add their own emotional strength
of a performance. Both the costumes and the
lighting complemented the ballet, and Goldstein's
choice of Bernstein's vocal piece was perfect.

Three, a modern ballet choreographed by John
Butler, was superbly danced bv Lynda Meyer,
Tomm Rudd, and Vane Vest. Meyer's excellent
technique and understanding of ballet enhanced
Butler's choreography, giving the audience an ab
sorbing insight into the sexual dilemma of one
woman. The ballet was offset by an appropriately
abstract Tom John sculpture, which hung over
head.
Unfortunately, the last ballet of the evening —
Scarlatti Portfolio, choreographed by Lew Chris
tensen — debased the company's integriy with its
frivolous buffoonery. Admittedly, it is supposed
to be a work celebrating the Commedia dell Arte,
a burlesque form of theatre which flourished in
the Middle Ages and Renaissance, but perhaps
such a subject is not appropriate for ballet. It
seemed as if Mr. Christensen took the comic char
acter dances from full-length ballets such as
Swan Lahe and Coppelia, lengthened them, and
then strung them all together. This sort of thing is
acceptable in small doses and in the proper con
text, but an entire ballet that relies on such con
trivances as a harlequin skipping about with a
hoop, or a man dressed as a woman jiggling over
sized artificial breasts, is insulting to the au
dience.
In addition, the dancers made several sloppy
mistakes, and seemed understandably, to lack the
inspiration of the earlier pieces. The one bright
spot here was the female corps of young maidens,
who danced exquisitely and were a refreshing
break from the general foolishness.
If the San Francisco Ballet would only limit
itself to intelligent works, then it clearly would
have the talent and ability to be a great and consis
tent success. But as it stands now, the company
will never become a great one if such empty and
frivolous works such as Scarlatti Portfolio and Di
vertimento No. In are kept in their repertoire.
