# Watt suggests scenic coast for oil leasing
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Four areas lying off some of
California's most scenic coastline were tentatively
recommended for oil leasing yesterday by Interior
Secretary James Watt,
In a letter to California Gov. Jerry Brown. Watt
asked for comment on a proposal to put the tracts
back into a sale scheduled for late May of this year.
Brown, environmentalists, California fishermen
and tourist interests have all campaigned strongly
against oil and gas drilling in the areas, which are
off Big Sur. Mendocino and Point Reyes.
Former Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus deleted
the tracts from the proposed sale last October,
saying the amount of oil and gas expected to be
found was not great enough to override strong en
vironmental concerns about leasing the tracts
Increase oil, gas production
In his letter to Brown. Watt said. "I have made no
final decision as to whether all. or any, of these
basins will actually be offered at the bid opening in
late May. but the president has instructed me to take
the necessary steps to increase the domestic pro
duction of oil and gas. and I firmly intend to take

those steps. ''
Knvironmental groups and some California politi
cians were quick to criticize Watt's proposal.
The Sierra Club said Watt was "proving to be a
special interest advocate" and 11 California con
gressmen sent a telegram to Watt saying inclusion
of the four tracts would be "a tragic mistake ...
which the people of the central and northern Califor
nia coast will not tolerate."
Leasing process 'undermined'
The telegram said.'' Not only does (the action) un
dermine the integrity of the leasing process, but it
totally ignores the compelling arguments made at
every level against the inclusion of the northern four
basins."
The congressmen said Watt's proposed action
would overturn a decision reached after years of
study that the economic and environmental dangers
of drilling far outweighed the potential benefits
In a separate statement. Sen Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.) said. ' These tracts must remain out of the
sale, not only to protect the sensitive and fragile en
vironment of California s beautiful and largely un
spoiled coastline, but also to protect the right of

state and local governments to manage their coastal
resources."
Senator has 'grave reservations'
California's other senator. Republican S I Hay
akawa. said he had "grave reservations' about the
proposal. He said he planned to tell Watt of the
"widespread concern I have received from the peo
ple living in the coastal areas ..."
The proposed California sale approved by Andrus
in October included only 115 tracts off the Santa
Maria basin Watt's proposal would add another 127
tracts in the deleted basins — Eel River. Point
Arena. Bodega and Santa Cruz for a total of 1.3 mil
lion acres.
Watt said he had under review not only the Cali
fornia case but also the entire five-year leasing pro
gram which Andrus issued in June 1980 to see
"whether revisions in that schedule are necessary
and desirable."
President Ronald Reagan criticized the Carter
administration during the campaign for being too
slow in leasing offshore and onshore federal tracts
for oil exploration.
