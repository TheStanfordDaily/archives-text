# Trust: Elvis Costello cuts hair and returns to audience
## 
### Chris Butchko 
Don't say a word/Don't say
anything-Don't say a word/I'm
not even listening"
Despite that indication. Elvis
Costello is finally trying to come
to terms with his audience on his
new album. Trust. From a look
at the album cover, one can see
that he has regained two things
that were pretty much put aside
after his first album: his
crewcut and his sense of
humour. On the cover, the new
ly-shorn Elvis seems about to
respond to someone who has
just asked him if he really was
the rock star Donny Osmond.
The inner sleeves have the same
kind of self-parodying humour
as the cover and the title. One
side shows Elvis reclining in a
frame chair wearing a slouch
hat and overcoat, trying very
hard to look like Humphrey
Bogart, and the other has Elvis
playing in front of a massive,
Buddy Holly-style orchestra.
Despite the lighter touch shown
on this album, however, the con
tent of Elvis' songs hasn't really
changed. On his first album he
told us he "used to be disgusted,
but now I try to be amused."
Whatever it says about the
world now, he's certainly
amused.
After "Get Happy!!" where
the music was pared down as
much as possible, and two of the
three new songs on "Taking Lib
erties," which sounded as
though they had been recorded
during a fire drill and had been
backed by an anvil chorus,
Elvis's style seemed to be mov
ing away from the mainstream
towards a "less-is-best" feel
ing. Trust, however, is a defi
nite return to full instrumenta
tion, without any loss of inspira
tion.
This album is very much
geared to the public, yet is
beyond any charge of "sellout"
(Elvis's last few albums were
criticized as not being
'accessible'). As if to prove that
this album is meant for the pub
lic, Elvis opens with his new sin
gle, "Clubland." In this song,
which, like a lot of his songs.

could have used a lyric sheet, he
depicts the singles scene. He
makes it seem both frantic and
secure, a refuge and a hell
"They lead you half way to par
adise, they lead you half way to
bliss" he sings, never making it
quite clear if that's all one
should expect.
The next song. "Lovers
Walk" is pinned to a writhing,
conga-beat, and shimmies its
way through a list of things that
lovers — those silly fools — do:

From a look at the cover, one can see that
(Elvis) has regained two things that were
pretty much put aside after his first album:
his crewcut and his sense of humor.

"Lovers strut, lovers stroll, lov
ers leap/Lovers late, lovers
wait, making promises they
can't keep." A nearly inaudible
piano line keeps the song stut
tering along until the end, where
a seemingly exasperated Elvis
asks "Will you look what love
has done?"
"You'll Never Be a Man,"
supposedly directed at Bonnie
Bramlett, with whom Elvis got
into a much-publicized bar
fight, is killing with its kind
ness. Condescendingly, Elvis
asks "Are you so superior?/Are
you in such pain/Are you made
out of porcelain?" Despite ob
vious putdowns and references,
this song may not be that
simple. Elvis also realizes the
power — and possibly the re
sponsibility — that his fame has
given him. "I've got the
password/I've got persuasion/A
proposition for invasion of your
privacy/Give yourself away and
find the fake in me." Perhaps
this song is letting us know Elvis
will think twice before shooting
his mouth off while drunk.
The next two songs, "Pretty
Words" (which don't mean

much anymore) and "Strict
Time" are alike in that they
both have a fairly downhearted
view of the world In "Pretty
Words" the daily newspaper of
fers "No words of consola
tion/Just cartoons and chitter
chatter." "Strict Time" show ,
a world where the best advice is
to "Toughen up. toughen
up/Keep your lip buttoned up."
and where "The boys are
straight-laced/The girls are
frigid/The talk is fruitless/And

the rules are rigid."
"Luxembourg," which fol
lows, breaks out of the sad view
of the world simply through its
energy. A rave up of the first or
der, it seems to have no in
telligible lines, but has anover
all, dead-serious "cheer up or
get out" message: "You're
talking and yawning/You didn't
listen to a thing you
heard/You're gonna stop all of
your moaning/Or you might
wake up in Luxembourg," the
significance of which is hidden
somewhere in the verses.
The first side ends with
"Watch Your Step," arguably
the best song on the album. Car
ried along on a slowly undulat
ing bass line and supported by a
high organ melody, it unwinds
and flows through imagery and
dry wit. "Every day is full of fun
. . he sings, "They're making
heroes/out of fall guys/They say
it's good for business." The last
line is delivered with calm sur
prise, and gives the song direc
tion.
Only two songs on the album
do not really work: "Different

Finger." another of Elvis's at
tempts to record a definitive
country song, which falls short
because it does not mention
prisons or freight trains, just an
extramarital affair, and "Shot
With His Own Gun," a highly
melodramatic song that walks "a
dangerous line between sad sin
cerity and sickly pathos. Over a
slow piano backing. Elvis sings
of a dirty sexual atfair: "What's
on his mind now is anyone's
guess, losing his touch with each
caress . . . Spending every eve
ning looking so appealing/He
comes without warning, leaves
without feeling. " Here, his very
cleverness makes the concept of
the song itself seem shallow.
The rest of the second side is
solid, including a rock duet with
Glen Tilbrook of Squeeze (Who
opened for Elvis on his recent
tour) about the life in clubs,
called "From a Whisper to a
Scream." Another hard rock
song is "White Knuckles" which
happens to be the story of a mar
riage — or an affair — that
ended when the man started
beating the woman: "White
knuckles on black and blue
skin/He didn't mean to hit her
but she kept laughing." What
makes this song unusual is that
it is told from different view
points: from the man's — "He
needs her like the axe needs the
turkey" — and the woman's, as
when she goes back to her fami
ly and they tell her they knew all
along. In the end, Elvis ob
serves. "there's always some
one new to toy with."
In "New Lace Sleeves," Elvis
creates a striking image of the
morning after: "Bad lovers
face to face in the morning/Shy
apologies add polite regret." He
goes on to decry the lives of the
rich and the gentry, and comes
to the end accusation "You
know you have been cap
tured/you feel so civilized/and
you look so pretty in your new
lace sleeves."
Before the album ends, Elvis
gives shows of both good

humour and old-time disgust. In
"Fish and Chip Paper" he says
"The Sunday morning dandruff
turns out to be confetti/and the
cost of living in sin would make
a poor man of Paul Getty." The
song follows the life of sin
through all its facets, and the
chorus pops up to urge it on:
"You better speak up now, it
won't mean a thing lat
er/yesterday's news is tomor
row's fish and chip paper."
"Big Sister s Clothes," the
last song is produced by Elvis
(instead of Nick Lowe, who pro-

duced the rest of the album) and
shows Elvis's touch both in the
production, in which strange
and out of place noises drift
through the background, and
most certainly in the lyrics.
"Sheep to the slaughter," it
starts, "Oh. I thought this must
be love!" In a sad, resigned
voice, he tells of all the phoni
ness and pretense that goes on in
a romance. Wryly, he points out
the important things in love:
"With a hammer for the 'slap
and tickle'/And the girls with
their comments/With all the

style and finesse/And the
purchase of armaments." In the
end. Elvis admits that "It's eas
ier to say I love you/than yours
sincerely, I suppose/All little
sisters/Like to try on big sis
ter's clothes."
Elvis Costello has made a
long step back towards his au
dience, and he has done it
without compromising his
views. The "new" Elvis, a little
more calm, a little less angry, a
little more witty, and a lot more
experienced, is making the best
music of his career. If he could
only learn to hold his liquor . . .
