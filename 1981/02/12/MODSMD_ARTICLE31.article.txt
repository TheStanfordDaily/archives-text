# New Toto release is tolerable ... for now
## 
### David Schmelzer 
A few years ago, Toto dis
covered that making a suc
cessful first album spawns the
unfortunate and perverse ex

pectation of producing an even
more successful second one.
How do you follow a spectacular
debut? With difficulty, they
found. They have too much tal

ent and experience from years
of backup work with other bands
to create a truly bad album, but
their next LP, Hydra, although
it had some fine moments and
an intriguing, original theme,
did not measure up com
mercially or artistically to its
predecessor, Totn. Now, Toto
has taken more time, hired a
new producer (Geoff Work
man), and made an album
almost as good as their initial
smash.
Turn Hack, like the other two
records, is primarily a product
of David Faich, who wrote four
of these eight songs and co
wrote two others. Paich cul
tivated his songwriting and mu
sical skills while working with
Boz Scaggs, first as a key
boardist and backup vocalist,
and then as co-writer on Scaggs'
million-selling Silk Degrees.
With Toto, he's gotten the
chance to pick up the pace a bit;
his music on Turn Hack is even
more rock-oriented than that on
the preceding two albums in
that even his slower works gen
erate some heat in spots.
Probably the most apparent
example of this is "A Million
Miles Away," an experiment in
blending a slow, simple, sparse
ly-accompanied verse with an

intense, heavily-orchestrated
chorus — a tactic he used once
before on Hydra's "Lorraine."
The newer song is not the most
easily accessible on the album
and will not likely be anyone's
favorite alter a single listening,
but it is the most interesting,
and will retain an appeal after
the others have blended into a
pool of pleasant, but all-to-fa
miliar tunes.
Not surprisingly, also
wrote what will probably be the
single, "Goodbye Eleanor'.'
"Eleanor" is not overly ex
perimental, but is a rocker in
fectious enough that you'll find
yourself tapping along on any
thing handy — its first few mo
ments feature Jeffrey Porcaro
ripping into a drum roll remi
niscent of Billy Steinberg's
opening to "How Do I Make
You." Happily, "Eleanor"
doesn't let up after this driving
beginning and ranks among
Toto's best rock songs.
Turn Hack can also boast
what may be the definitively
titled love song of the young dec
ade in "I Think I Could Stand
You Forever." Sort of chokes
you up, doesn't it? What hap
pened to the days of songs like
"Love Is a Many Splendored
Thing?" But, still, this less

than-sentimental marriage pro
posal, along with some ex
cellent acoustic guitar work,
makes for another good
number.
The album has its few prob
lems in those songs that Paich
didn't write. "Live For Today,"
although an agreeably
hedonistic little song, is ham
pered by Steve Lukather's bare
ly adequate vocals. Unlike that
of lead singer Bobby Kimball (a
high-quality rock vocalist with
fine resonance and range),
Lukather's voice, while pleas
ant enough on slower numbers
like "Georgy Porgy," strains
when he has to belt in the higher
registers. Kimball sings lead on
the title track, the other Paich
less song, which is actually one
of the more poetic that you'll
find ("Only the wind sang the
words he could hear/Born of the
sand washed ashore on a tear").
Here the problem is a somewhat
ponderous melody.
Still, these songs are certainly
not poor enough to seriously de
tract from what is a good, if not
outstanding, album. You'll
think you could stand this, if not
forever, then at least until
Toto's fourth try.
