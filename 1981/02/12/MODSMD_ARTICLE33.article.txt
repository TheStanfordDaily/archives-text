# Melvin and Howard: American Dream turns comic
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Here's how the story goes:
Melvin Dummar was driving
across the Nevada desert very
late one evening when he came
upon an old man lying on the
sand, apparently injured Figur
ing him for a wino, Melvin
helped him into his truck and of
fered him a lift to the closest
hospital. But the brusque,
laconic passenger refused to see
a doctor and asked to be driven
to Las Vegas. During the all
night journey, these most mis
matched of companions became
comrades, and Melvin even
seduced the old codger into sing
ing a duet with him At one
point, Melvin confided that he
had tried many jobs but had not
yet found his niche in life; in
listing his shots at discovering a
vocation, he mentioned that he
had applied to work at Hughes
once but had been rejected.
"That's too bad." the older man
commented. "I could have done
something for you I'm Howard
Hughes." Dummar didn't be
lieve him. of course — until
Hughes died eight years later
and a copy of a will listing him
as one of the beneficiaries found
its way into Melvin's hands.
The so-called "Mormon will"
story (an account of which is
given in Harold Rhoden's book
Yli.uh Stake*) is the inspiration
for Jonathan Demme's Melvin
and Howard, written by Bo
Goldman, which is an im
aginative reconstruction of the
meeting between Dummar
(Paul Le Mat) and Hughes
(Jason Robards), and of Dum
mar s life during the eight years
that followed. (The meeting was
possibly apocryphal, but there

with whom they share a strong
emotional bond. The script con
tains some of the best writing in
movies of the last several years
— particularly in the opening
twenty minutes (the drive
through the desert). Melvin and
Howard is a classic American
comedy.
The Hughes-Dummar se
quence occupies only the first
quarter of the movie, but in ret
rospect it seems much longer.

This is partly because Goldman
and Demme have built Melvin's
character, along with the im
plications of the later sections
— in which we watch his in
teraction with his two wives and
his daughter and his efforts to
settle into a job — on the con
trast between these two men
and on the strength of Melvin's
unaffected charm, which is
enough to soften Hughes.
Hughes is a celebrity billionaire
whose triumph in attaining the
pot of gold at the end of the
Horatio Alger rainbow has
ended up destroying him; Dum
mar is a ne'er-do-well who hun-

gers for the dream objects
(jazzy cars, boats) that most
people associate with men like
Howard Hughes. When Melvin's
wife Lynda < Mary Steenburgen)
wins ten thousand dollars on a
quiz show, she and Melvin feel
they have grabbed a stake in the
territory of which the most rec
ognizable symbol is Howard
Hughes.
Jason Robards towers over
the movie, even though he ap
pears only briefly at the begin
ning and (in a flashback) at the

end. One of my friends refers to
Robards as a living Eugene
O'Neill character Maybe you
have to have played the three
greatest O'Neill men (Jamie
Tyrone in I. on a Day's -Journey
into Night and .A Moon for the
Misbegotten, Hickey in The
Iceman Cometh, and have
plaved them as brilliantly as
Robards has (these per
formances are generally con
sidered definitive), in order to
play Howard Hughes. O'Neill
would have understood the fail
ure in Hughes ' success Robards
has a long face and great sunken
sad eyes; his grey-white hair
flies out like the points of a star.
No actor has ever managed to
look so eccentric and so tragic
at the same time. And when he
sings "Bye Bye Blackbird," the
lyrics have a special poignancy
("No one here can love or un
derstand me/Oh. what hard luck
stories they all hand me") that
make you feel that the song
must have been written for
Hughes. (For an actor who can't
sing, Robards does remarkable
things with a song. No one who
saw him in A Moon for the Mis
begotten is likely to forget his
weeping rendition of "In the
Baggage Car Ahead.")
Three and a half years ago
Jonathan Demme directed
Handle with Care (originally
called Citizens Band), a charm
ing, offbeat comedy about CB
operators. It was a small-town
western masque: each of the
characters assumed an identity
with his "handle," and at the
end. when they united to track
down an old-time trucker who
had disappeared, they didn't
recognize each other. Handle
with Care had a terrific script

(by Paul Brickman), but
Demme gave the movie a quali
ty it would not otherwise have
had: lyricism. Melvin and
Howard shares that quality with
Demme's earlier comedy; he

match. The opening sequence,
which the photographer Tak Fu
jimoto has made to seem almost
hallucinatory, has an unceasing
but gentle rhythm, as if Dum
mar's truck were floating
across wide expanses of desert.
Demme has a gift for unusual
visual detail and strange, re
vealing human moments — the
texture of this film is not quite
like that of other comedies.
Melvin chases his daughter and,
catching up, grabs her affec
tionately around the waist. Lyn
da, seeing the girl off on a bus
that will return her to Melvin,
puts together a sandwich for her
from remainders on the tables
of a crummy snack bar. At his
second wedding, Melvin wears a
spanking white tie with a glit
tering black and silver border
and one of the witnesses, an old
man. has palpitations. Melvin
gets a job as a milkman; at the
factory where he picks up his
load is a huge dummy cow on
wheels.

There aren't any stock char
acters in this movie; everybody
has idiosyncrasies, but Demme
and Goldman do not condescend
to any of them. Even the quiz
show host (Robert Ridgeiyt,
who seemed so slick and obnox-

ious when the Dummars
watched him on television,
turns out to be surprisingly sym
pathetic. The major characters
are wonderfully drawn — and
Demme andGoidman have been
fortunate in their cast. As Lyn
da. Mary Steenburgen (who was
Jack Nicholson's bride in (tain'
Smith and Malcolm McDowell's
paramour in Time After Time
has the perfect outlet for her
spacey sexiness, and she shows
more depth than either of her
earlier roles allowed her.
Through Lynda's daffy en

thusiasm and weird, fixed sense
of priorities (when Melvin
storms into the strip joint where
she is working and she is fired
for causing a disturbance, she
saunters through the club na
ked. making sure she says good
bye to each of the other strip
pers) we see a very touching
blend of maternal devotion, vul
nerability and a fierce, flailing
grasp for anything that might
keep her life — which is in dan
ger of flying off into the
stratosphere at any moment —
moored to the ground. Much
earthier is Pamela Reed (Belle
Star, in the Lnnu Riders), who is
very good as Melvin's second
wife, Bonnie.
Melvin Dummar is an authen
tic innocent — a man as in
capable of not dreaming as he is
of practicality or disingenuous
ness. He's like Johnny Nolan in
A Tree (irows in Brooklyn, but
with none of Johnny's blarney.
Paul Le Mat. the overage
adolescent in the yellow deuce
coupe in American (iraffiti and
the idealistic hero of Handle
with Care, plays Melvin better,
one would say,then anyone else
could have. When this incom
parably generous bumpkin sings
with shrewd, sad-eyed Jason
Robards, the moment is magic.
