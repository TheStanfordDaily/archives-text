# Company performs 'The Me Nobody Knows'
## 
### Patricia Rose 
In spite of one fundamental flaw, the Company's pro
duction of The \fe Nobody Knows was very good. The
pacing, singing, and choreography were all natural,
and lent the performances a sincerity that held togeth
er the series of short vignettes that make up the show.
This sincerity, however, was left undirected and turned
what is supposed to be street kids' wisdom into plain
tive moralizing. I wondered if anyone in the cast or pro
duction staff had ever been to New York City.
On the first page of the program there is the follow
ing note: "The spoken text in this production was writ
ten by children between the ages of 7 and 18 attending
New York City public schools in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Harlem, Jamaica (Queens), and Manhattan, and the
Youth House in the Bronx . . . These are children's
voices from the ghetto. In their struggle lies their hope,
and our ours. They are the voices of change."
\l this not had not been in the program, one could have
imagined the text being taken from any set of pre
cocious kids, hurt by their parental and school environ
ment. City kids, however, have a special kind of tough

ness. a self-reliance born of anger, of early massive
doses of "life is not fair." These kinds of kids want
least of all to be pitied; they offer their wisdom through
at least one defensive layer of cynicism. They've
learned to protect themselves by playing down all their
childish emotion; but they are kids, so somehow it
always comes through.
When the performances portrayed this kind of re
straint, they were beautiful, powerful, especially Ben
Wilson's during "The Horse," a junky's lament. Other
fine moments of this kind were consistently evoked by
Julie Henry, although it seemed that she switched in
and out of character for some of the upbeat, happy
group numbers instead of making the emotional
changes internally. The show as it is written, however,
makes this internalizing extremely difficult to do. The
cast as a whole might have taken their time a bit more
to make these transitions more believable. Troy
Schmidt was particularly careful with this.
The happy numbers were genuinely happy and had a
terrific sense of release, especially "Flying Milk and
Runaway Plates" and "Counting Numbers." Applause

here for the choreography, which was obviously easy,
fun and an excellent blend of structure and improvisa
tion. This is probably the most difficult kind of choreo
graphy to pull off in a small space with no real set. It
was consistently interesting, and almost never trite.
The set paintings were good because they were
simple, communicating the idea of cityscapes, racial
separatism, alienation and thoughtfulness with "an
economy of line" in black and white, like abstract art or
good graphics. At one point, the shadow of one of the
characters loomed ominously against one of the set pic
tures, underscoring the loneliness evoked in the song.
More lighting effects and changes of this kind would
have helped the show break down into its smaller com
ponent parts. ' .
Last, but certainly not least, the small funky combo
assembled for the performances played sensitively and
supportively, which is exactly how a show band is sup
posed to play. Especially fine were Wayne Winborne's
opening notes on the tenor sax, immediately setting the
street to life tone of pain, learned from, and turned to
life.
