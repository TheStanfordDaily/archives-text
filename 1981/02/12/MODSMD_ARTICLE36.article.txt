# Campus rock band
## Stanford grows its own Magic 
### Sally Girvin 
Rooftop Magic: the name is
familiar to many across Stan
ford campus, from co-ops to
frats to dorms ... but who are
they and why do they appeal to
so many?
At the simplest, they are a
good dance band. They play Jef
ferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix,
the Grateful Dead; the old fa
vorites plus a number of ori
ginal pieces. They are tight and
practically a guarantee of an ex
ceptional party.
In the winter and spring of
1979, a group of students from
Phi Psi house formed an in
formal band. Entertaining the
co-op residents with their living
room jams, they became know
as the Phi Psi Band and began to
play campus parties and bene
fits.
"That spring was blissful,"
remembers guitarist Chris
Pilon. "We were so concen

trated on the music that we had
to blow off studies."
When the band split up at the
end of the school year, Pilon,
singer Leslie Moulton and key
board player Jay Gitterman
joined with guitarist Jim Ger
rell to form the core of Rooftop
Magic. They rehearsed that
summer in a Menlo Park room
that smelled so bad they called
it"the kennel," and performed
both on and off-campus. Be
cause they first started playing
for fun and for friends, the link
between the performers and the
audience is still a vital one.
"I like to keep the line be
tween the audience and us
fuzzy," Moulton says. "They do
as much as we do!"
Seven months ago, Joe
Klecan became their regular
drummer, and Jeff Bell, after
finishing with his lead role in the
production "Jesus Christ Super
star" last spring, became their

bass player.
Although the band members
are modest about their techni
cal skills, their level of musical
awareness is high. With a re
pertoire that draws heavily on
'60s rock, they are wary of the
dangers of overplaying the fa
vorites. They constantly revise
and drop numbers to keep their
selection fresh, and this careful
evaluation is typical of the con
centration that goes into Roof
top Magic's work.
"As a new member." recalls
Bell, "I thought 1 could offer a
different perspective on their
old songs, but I didn't under
stand why they didn't want to
play them."
As Ferrell describes it, Roof
top Magic's music is a "simple
reaction against the whole rock
extravagance. The underlying
thing is having fun."
The college and community

response to their music makes
the future look promising''for
Rooftop Magic. Although
member is working towards bif
ferent non-musical goals, grad
uation from Stanford will rrrferk
for some of them their ?(rst
chance to really devote them
selves to the musical world to
see whether it is the path tljiey
wish to pursue. j
But Rooftop Magic is not but
to dazzle. The band members
don't think about stardom, lÂ£ast
of all superstardom.
"It's too fake," said Piton.
"You can act out your fantasies,
though, as long as it's not affec
tation. The most important
thing is to be yourself."
"To shoot for stardom is sec
ondary; you have to get jobs
first," Bell adds. "One of the se
crets is catchy music, but it's
really tough."


Rooftop Magic will be performing tonight at the Keystone, Palo Alto, with the Claude Monet Band. The
show begins at 9 p.m. (Rooftop Magic, left to right, is: Joe Klecan, Leslie Moulton, Chris Pilon, Jeff
