# The 						Dell' Arte Company finds something fishy in the state of California
## 
### Geoffrey Mandel 
Intrigue at Ah-Pah, the Dell'Arte Players
Company's latest play, is a congenial mixture
of slapstick comedy, raucous saxophone mu
sic, sexual innuendo, and a mystery plot that
is no more understandable than any of
Bogart's Sam Spade or Phillip Marlowe mov
ies.
The twist in this case is that the detective —
a private dick from Eureka, Cal., who goes by
the unlikely name of Scar Tissue — happens to
be a woman. And even though this sexy,
female, ace detective is on a fishing trip up
north (Ah-Pah is a tributary of the Klamath
River in Northern California), she still gets
away with lines like, "the only rod I was pack
ing had a reel on the end of it."
Ah-Pah is something of a hybrid, combin
ing all the traditional elements of a detective
mystery — a worldly, wiseacre detective, a
colorful group of supporting characters, and
several grisly murders — with two very un
traditional additions. The first is a circus
carnival atmosphere which includes juggling,
acrobatics, and boisterous musical accom
paniment, all performed by the show's eight

member cast; the second is a subject that hap
pens to be a politically sensitive one, that of
Northern California water rights.
Mara Sabinson, who plays two roles in the
play as well as doubling as a percussionist,
told me that the goal of the Dell'Arte group is
primarily to provide good, entertaining
theatre; in the past, Dell'Arte has performed
vaudeville routines by Stan Laurel, an adap
tion of the Robert Crumb comic book "White
Man Meet Bigfoot," and an original satire
called The Loon's Rage, which dealt with an
other pressing environmental concern, nucle
ar power. A secondary goal of the company is
to present issues which are important to its
audience, particularly those issues native to
the company's Humboldt County. As Sabinson
explained, the company tries not to take a
hard-line stand on any topic, even those like
the water rights problem, which they clearly
have strong feelings about. As Scar Tissue
says near the end of the play, "I don't want
them using this river to wash low-riders and
fill swimming pools."
The Dell'Arte company, a non-profit group
of professional actors and musicians, has
toured California three times in the past four
years as part of the California Arts Council
Touring Theatre Program. The players have
also performed at two major U.S. theatre fes
tivals, and one in Venice. Ah-f'ah was named
by both The San Francisco Chronicle and The
San Francisco Bay (iuardian as among the
best productions of 1979, and it played to
standing room-only audiences in Los Angeles.
The group plans to return to L.A. for an ex
tended engagement following their ap
pearances at Stanford and Berkeley this week.
Dell'Arte is a form of popular theatre that
dates from Renaissance Italy, and usually in
volves stock characters much like the ones
that populate modern detective mysteries. It
is also improvisational theatre, and like

vaudeville, is usually performed from a
scenario rather than a script, allowing the ac
tors to improvise or cut out material at will.
Although Ah-f'ah is performed from a script,
the play was collectively written.
Ah-I'ah's slapstick sides were well-timed
and funny, and a little self-parody is always a
healthy thing. But the problem is where to
draw the line: When one of the actors cocks
the trigger of a revolver by say "click-click."
it's funny; and when a pack of backstage dogs
are indicated near the end of the play with a
few half-heard "woof-woofs," that's funny
too. But when Scar Tissue engages in a
stylized mock battle with a mysterious man in
white (apparently based on Saturday Night
Lire's "Mr. Mike"), or when local deputy
Fred Hurlbutt starts to slap another charac
ter around the stage to the accompaniment of
ill-timed and too-loud sound effects, the com
edy becomes a bit strained. It's important to
have a certain amount of faith in one's materi
al, and any production that relies so heavily on
visual gags, sound effects, and clever stage
machinations seems to suggest that it has
doubts about the script.
At times, the odd mixture of 1940s detective
film and modern social commentary gets to
be a bit too much. When a giant salmon by the
name of "Deep Trout" appears on stage and
tells our sexy female detective in a sonorous
Indian voice that "what the White Man has
given, he can take away," the confusion of
genres is enough to foil the hardiest sus
pension of disbelief. The idea of a female Sam
Spade (complete with a dangling cigarette,
shoulder holster, and an awesome scar on her
right cheek) is wonderful, and .Joan Schirle is
surely the perfect actress for the part with her
husky voice and long-legged sexuality; but
was it really necessary to have her go through
such elaborate double-entendres with the
mercenary sports-fisherman. Beau Masters'?

Without going into specifics, the gags involve
fishing poles . . . and in other scenes, guns, bil
ly clubs, and arrows. There's even a running
joke in which Scar Tissue refers to herself as a
"private dick," and every time she mentions
her beau Beau, she speaks of his "contra-dic
tions" (emphasis hers). The play reaches its
nadir when Beau says that he feels like a Dr.
Pepper, since he's come in a bottle for so long
— a line that brought gasps of disbelief from
the audience.
But the plays good points go a long way to
make up for the bad Donald Forrest, as the
newsboy Woodie, simply walks away with the
show. His freshly-scrubbed face, nasal little
bov voice, and the wonderful scene where the
man in white gives him a lick of an acid-spiked
lollipop, are all outrageously funny. Mara
Sahinson is also very good as the statuesque
hairdresser. Madge, who at one point starts to
give Scar Tissue a shave. (One only wishes
that the writers had followed up on a promis
ing seduction between her and Woodie.)
Michael Fields, as the sadistic man in white,
is much better than as the overstuffed Pop.
and his scenes with Woodie are marvellous.
The most impressive thing about the
Dell'Arte company is the ease with which
each of the eight members wears so many dif
ferent hats. Jeff Raz, for example, appears as
a juggler and a guitar accompanist, and acts
the role of deputy Hurlbutt. Donald Forrest
and Michael Fields each play three different
roles. The company's ability to improvise in a
pinch is also remarkable, and it's often hard to
tell whether a particular routine is a hasty im
provisation or was intended all along.
Although Intrigue at Ah-Pah is a bit too
much of a strained hodgepodge, the blend of
musical comedy and political thriller is cer
tainly an interesting one. The Dell'Arte com
pany is a talented group, and it would be good
to see more of their work at Stanford.

edy becomes a bit strained. It's important to
have a certain amount of faith in one's materi
al, and any production that relies so heavily on
visual gags, sound effects, and clever stage
machinations seems to suggest that it has
doubts about the script.
At times, the odd mixture of 1940s detective
film and modern social commentary gets to
be a bit too much. When a giant salmon by the
name of "Deep Trout" appears on stage and
tells our sexy female detective in a sonorous
Indian voice that "what the White Man has
given, he can take away," the confusion of
genres is enough to foil the hardiest sus
pension of disbelief. The idea of a female Sam
Spade (complete with a dangling cigarette,
shoulder holster, and an awesome scar on her
right cheek) is wonderful, and .Joan Schirle is
surely the perfect actress for the part with her
husky voice and long-legged sexuality; but
was it really necessary to have her go through
such elaborate double-entendres with the
mercenary sports-fisherman. Beau Masters'?

Without going into specifics, the gags involve
fishing poles . . . and in other scenes, guns, bil
ly clubs, and arrows. There's even a running
joke in which Scar Tissue refers to herself as a
"private dick," and every time she mentions
her beau Beau, she speaks of his "contra-dic
tions" (emphasis hers). The play reaches its
nadir when Beau says that he feels like a Dr.
Pepper, since he's come in a bottle for so long
— a line that brought gasps of disbelief from
the audience.
But the plays good points go a long way to
make up for the bad Donald Forrest, as the
newsboy Woodie, simply walks away with the
show. His freshly-scrubbed face, nasal little
bov voice, and the wonderful scene where the
man in white gives him a lick of an acid-spiked
lollipop, are all outrageously funny. Mara
Sahinson is also very good as the statuesque
hairdresser. Madge, who at one point starts to
give Scar Tissue a shave. (One only wishes
that the writers had followed up on a promis
ing seduction between her and Woodie.)
Michael Fields, as the sadistic man in white,
is much better than as the overstuffed Pop.
and his scenes with Woodie are marvellous.
The most impressive thing about the
Dell'Arte company is the ease with which
each of the eight members wears so many dif
ferent hats. Jeff Raz, for example, appears as
a juggler and a guitar accompanist, and acts
the role of deputy Hurlbutt. Donald Forrest
and Michael Fields each play three different
roles. The company's ability to improvise in a
pinch is also remarkable, and it's often hard to
tell whether a particular routine is a hasty im
provisation or was intended all along.
Although Intrigue at Ah-Pah is a bit too
much of a strained hodgepodge, the blend of
musical comedy and political thriller is cer
tainly an interesting one. The Dell'Arte com
pany is a talented group, and it would be good
to see more of their work at Stanford.

Intrigue at Ah-Pah, the Dell'Arte Players
Company's latest play, is a congenial mixture
of slapstick comedy, raucous saxophone mu
sic, sexual innuendo, and a mystery plot that
is no more understandable than any of
Bogart's Sam Spade or Phillip Marlowe mov
ies.
The twist in this case is that the detective —
a private dick from Eureka, Cal., who goes by
the unlikely name of Scar Tissue — happens to
be a woman. And even though this sexy,
female, ace detective is on a fishing trip up
north (Ah-Pah is a tributary of the Klamath
River in Northern California), she still gets
away with lines like, "the only rod I was pack
ing had a reel on the end of it."
Ah-Pah is something of a hybrid, combin
ing all the traditional elements of a detective
mystery — a worldly, wiseacre detective, a
colorful group of supporting characters, and
several grisly murders — with two very un
traditional additions. The first is a circus
carnival atmosphere which includes juggling,
acrobatics, and boisterous musical accom
paniment, all performed by the show's eight

member cast; the second is a subject that hap
pens to be a politically sensitive one, that of
Northern California water rights.
Mara Sabinson, who plays two roles in the
play as well as doubling as a percussionist,
told me that the goal of the Dell'Arte group is
primarily to provide good, entertaining
theatre; in the past, Dell'Arte has performed
vaudeville routines by Stan Laurel, an adap
tion of the Robert Crumb comic book "White
Man Meet Bigfoot," and an original satire
called The Loon's Rage, which dealt with an
other pressing environmental concern, nucle
ar power. A secondary goal of the company is
to present issues which are important to its
audience, particularly those issues native to
the company's Humboldt County. As Sabinson
explained, the company tries not to take a
hard-line stand on any topic, even those like
the water rights problem, which they clearly
have strong feelings about. As Scar Tissue
says near the end of the play, "I don't want
them using this river to wash low-riders and
fill swimming pools."
The Dell'Arte company, a non-profit group
of professional actors and musicians, has
toured California three times in the past four
years as part of the California Arts Council
Touring Theatre Program. The players have
also performed at two major U.S. theatre fes
tivals, and one in Venice. Ah-f'ah was named
by both The San Francisco Chronicle and The
San Francisco Bay (iuardian as among the
best productions of 1979, and it played to
standing room-only audiences in Los Angeles.
The group plans to return to L.A. for an ex
tended engagement following their ap
pearances at Stanford and Berkeley this week.
Dell'Arte is a form of popular theatre that
dates from Renaissance Italy, and usually in
volves stock characters much like the ones
that populate modern detective mysteries. It
is also improvisational theatre, and like

vaudeville, is usually performed from a
scenario rather than a script, allowing the ac
tors to improvise or cut out material at will.
Although Ah-f'ah is performed from a script,
the play was collectively written.
Ah-I'ah's slapstick sides were well-timed
and funny, and a little self-parody is always a
healthy thing. But the problem is where to
draw the line: When one of the actors cocks
the trigger of a revolver by say "click-click."
it's funny; and when a pack of backstage dogs
are indicated near the end of the play with a
few half-heard "woof-woofs," that's funny
too. But when Scar Tissue engages in a
stylized mock battle with a mysterious man in
white (apparently based on Saturday Night
Lire's "Mr. Mike"), or when local deputy
Fred Hurlbutt starts to slap another charac
ter around the stage to the accompaniment of
ill-timed and too-loud sound effects, the com
