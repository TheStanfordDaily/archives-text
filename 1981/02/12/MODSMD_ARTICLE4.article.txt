# ASSU Senate affirms support for the May bluegrass festival
## 
### Don Willenburg 
The ASSU Senate last night voted to
continue its commitment to a student
sponsored bluegrass festival at Stan
ford this spring. By a narrow 8-6
margin, the senate defeated a
challenge sponsored by the Senate Fi
nance Committee opposing the festi
val because it is risky and could set an
undesirable precedent for future Uni
versity-ASSU relations.
The senate vote clears the way for
Student Financial Manager Steve
Davis and Council of Presidents mem
ber Dayna Goldfine to examine pro
posals for the May concerts, including
the hiring of a booking agent, expected
to occur later this week.
However, the senate passed a new
motion changing a key provision of the
festival authorization. Associate Dean
for Student Affairs Thomas Massey
indicated that the University pre
ferred a student sponsored festival to
include substantial student partici
pation In response, the senate's new

motion made a verbal commitment to
increasing that participation by char
acterizing it as "involvement" rather
than "observation."
This new language may be vetoed
by the Council of Presidents (COP) if
it acts within 72 hours. If the new lan
guage is vetoed, the original author
ization passed by the senate on Janu
ary 31 remains in force.
Three of the four COP members
have already expressed their opposi
tion to the bluegrass festival. It is un
certain what effect a veto would have
on the fate of the festival or on Univer
sity acceptance of any ASSU proposal.
'Unrealistic'
Opponents of the festival character
ized its supporters as "unrealistic"
and reiterated their claim that con
cert production was too complex and
time-consuming a task for effective
student management. COP member
Dick Butterfield said, "I see stars in a
lot of people's eyes."
He added that inexperienced stu
dent organizations are likely to be
taken advantage of in the concert pro
motion industry. Citing the financial
losses suffered for nine of the 10 years
that ASSU Special Events operated on
campus. Butterfield commented that
"concerts ruin students."
Supporters of the festival pointed to
the fact that last year's bluegrass fes
tival actually made money in a year
when Special Events as a whole lost
more than $90,000. Some senators said
the high student demand for concerts
justifies whatever outlays of time and
effort the project would require
Goldfine. the only COP member
supporting the bluegrass festival,
claimed that if the ASSU did not spon
sor the festival and another organiza
tion on campus chose to take the
project over, the ASSU might lose the
right to hold concerts on campus in the
future.

Associate Dean Massey replied that
the University has a moratorium on
campus concerts until the final de
livery and assessment of the ASSU's
Task Force on Contemporary Enter
tainment report.
That report, scheduled for Senate
Finance Committee consideration
next week, is to provide a framework
and a set of recommendations about
the future of ASSU-sponsored con
certs on campus. Finance Committee
Chair Gary Reiff, in opposing the fes
tival. joined with Massey in calling a
decision on a specific event before de
ciding the general policy on concerts
was "putting the cart before the
horse."
A motion to defer consideration of
the bluegrass issue until after the sub
mission of the Task Force report to
the Senate received little support
from either side.
Reiff and Butterfield, both Task
Force members, stated that approval
of the report was uncertain and might
take considerable time to ratify. Gold
fine replied that it was already rela
tively close to concert time and that
further delay would make it extreme
ly difficult to book acts and make oth
er necessary arrangements.
Davis, who joined with the Senate
Finance Committee in opposing the
festival, pointed out that the pre
liminary Task Force report which
came out in January had blamed this
lack of adequate lead time, among
other factors, for the collapse of the
Special Events program. He noted
that the length of time which that re
port indicated to be insufficient was
little more than the length of time un
til the concert, planned for the second
weekend in May.
Guest professors
In other actions, the senate ap
proved the nominations submitted by
the Guest Professorship Board for this
Spring Quarter. Environmentalist Dr.
David Brower. minority lobbyist An
dre Burnett, and former presidential
candidate John Anderson were all ap
proved, with some reservations as to
the Board's tendency to pick guest
professors from the left end of the po
litical spectrum.

Senate Chair Doug Mitchell also an
nounced the resignation of four more
graduate student members of the sen
ate. He had sent letters to the four and
several undergraduates requesting
their resignations due to repeated
absences from senate meetings.
Graduate Senator David Krause
characterized Mitchell's actions as a
"graduate student senate purge."

was "putting the cart before the
horse."
A motion to defer consideration of
the bluegrass issue until after the sub
mission of the Task Force report to
the Senate received little support
from either side.
Reiff and Butterfield, both Task
Force members, stated that approval
of the report was uncertain and might
take considerable time to ratify. Gold
fine replied that it was already rela
tively close to concert time and that
further delay would make it extreme
ly difficult to book acts and make oth
er necessary arrangements.
Davis, who joined with the Senate
Finance Committee in opposing the
festival, pointed out that the pre
liminary Task Force report which
came out in January had blamed this
lack of adequate lead time, among
other factors, for the collapse of the
Special Events program. He noted
that the length of time which that re
port indicated to be insufficient was
little more than the length of time un
til the concert, planned for the second
weekend in May.
Guest professors
In other actions, the senate ap
proved the nominations submitted by
the Guest Professorship Board for this
Spring Quarter. Environmentalist Dr.
David Brower. minority lobbyist An
dre Burnett, and former presidential
candidate John Anderson were all ap
proved, with some reservations as to
the Board's tendency to pick guest
professors from the left end of the po
litical spectrum.

Senate Chair Doug Mitchell also an
nounced the resignation of four more
graduate student members of the sen
ate. He had sent letters to the four and
several undergraduates requesting
their resignations due to repeated
absences from senate meetings.
Graduate Senator David Krause
characterized Mitchell's actions as a
"graduate student senate purge."
The ASSU Senate last night voted to
continue its commitment to a student
sponsored bluegrass festival at Stan
ford this spring. By a narrow 8-6
margin, the senate defeated a
challenge sponsored by the Senate Fi
nance Committee opposing the festi
val because it is risky and could set an
undesirable precedent for future Uni
versity-ASSU relations.
The senate vote clears the way for
Student Financial Manager Steve
Davis and Council of Presidents mem
ber Dayna Goldfine to examine pro
posals for the May concerts, including
the hiring of a booking agent, expected
to occur later this week.
However, the senate passed a new
motion changing a key provision of the
festival authorization. Associate Dean
for Student Affairs Thomas Massey
indicated that the University pre
ferred a student sponsored festival to
include substantial student partici
pation In response, the senate's new

motion made a verbal commitment to
increasing that participation by char
acterizing it as "involvement" rather
than "observation."
This new language may be vetoed
by the Council of Presidents (COP) if
it acts within 72 hours. If the new lan
guage is vetoed, the original author
ization passed by the senate on Janu
ary 31 remains in force.
Three of the four COP members
have already expressed their opposi
tion to the bluegrass festival. It is un
certain what effect a veto would have
on the fate of the festival or on Univer
sity acceptance of any ASSU proposal.
'Unrealistic'
Opponents of the festival character
ized its supporters as "unrealistic"
and reiterated their claim that con
cert production was too complex and
time-consuming a task for effective
student management. COP member
Dick Butterfield said, "I see stars in a
lot of people's eyes."
He added that inexperienced stu
dent organizations are likely to be
taken advantage of in the concert pro
motion industry. Citing the financial
losses suffered for nine of the 10 years
that ASSU Special Events operated on
campus. Butterfield commented that
"concerts ruin students."
Supporters of the festival pointed to
the fact that last year's bluegrass fes
tival actually made money in a year
when Special Events as a whole lost
more than $90,000. Some senators said
the high student demand for concerts
justifies whatever outlays of time and
effort the project would require
Goldfine. the only COP member
supporting the bluegrass festival,
claimed that if the ASSU did not spon
sor the festival and another organiza
tion on campus chose to take the
project over, the ASSU might lose the
right to hold concerts on campus in the
future.

Associate Dean Massey replied that
the University has a moratorium on
campus concerts until the final de
livery and assessment of the ASSU's
Task Force on Contemporary Enter
tainment report.
That report, scheduled for Senate
Finance Committee consideration
next week, is to provide a framework
and a set of recommendations about
the future of ASSU-sponsored con
certs on campus. Finance Committee
Chair Gary Reiff, in opposing the fes
tival. joined with Massey in calling a
decision on a specific event before de
ciding the general policy on concerts
