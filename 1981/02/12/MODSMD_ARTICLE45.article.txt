State, Pentagon disagree over bomb
Washington — Despite its emphasis on speaking with
one voice, the Ronald Reagan administration was struggl
ing with its first foreign policy flap yesterday because of
increasingly public disagreement between the State De
partment and the Pentagon over what to do about the neu
tron bomb.
At the center of the flap is Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, who this week repeated a statement that
caused him problems with the State Department last
week personally. Weinberger said, he supports deploying
neutron warheads in Europe.
Weinberger made his most recent statement on the is
sue although no decision has yet been made on the con
troversial weapon, which is designed to have a large hu
man kill factor while leaving buildings and others struc
tures relatively intact.
While the State Department tried to paper over Wein
berger's remarks of last week, it said yesterday that Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig has different priorities
where nuclear weapons are concerned.
William Dyess. a spokesman for the State Department,
said that Haig believes that the first priority of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should be fulfilling
its 1979 commitment to modernize its theater nuclear
forces by basing new U.S. Pershing missiles and I S.
ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe
By inference, a lower priority goes to Weinberger's fa
vored neutron weapons.
The neutron bomb issue is especially sensitive because
the question of whether or not to deploy it is an emotion
charged. politically controversial matter in Western Eu
rope Weinberger's initial statement supporting the neu
tron bomb came as an unwelcome surprise to allied gov
ernments in Europe.
Seeking to calm that reaction last week, the State De
partment said that U.S. policy remains unchanged from
that of the administration of former president Jimmy
Carter, which decided in 1978 not to deploy the neutron
bomb.
Weinberger's second assertion of support for the neu
tron weapons created additional problems for the Reagan
administration because it came only days after the presi
dent had cautioned members of his Cabinet not to debate in
public about issues that had not yet been decided
At the White House yesterday, Kama Small, a deputy
press secretary, initially told reporters — in response to
questions about neutron warheads — that "this situation is
under study" and that "we've been in full and extensive
consultation with our allies.
Her words seemed to suggest that the administration
was seriously asking members of NATO to station neu
tron. or "enhanced radiation" warheads, on European ter
ritory.
But another press aide, Lyndon Allin, interrupted her
"There have been no discussions with the allies specifi
cally on whether or not it (the neutron weapon) should be
deployed." Allin said. "This decision (on making and
deploying the weapon > has not been fully considered, fully
discussed within the administration."
Hispanics fear civil rights loss
Washington — The Reagan administration presents a
threat to Hispanic civil rights despite the comparatively
strong Latino support for Republicans in 1980. the new
head of the Washington office of the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund said yesterday.
Antonia Hernandez, who will represent the California
based fund here, said that her major concern would be the
renewal of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which is sched

uled to expire in 1982 Originally designed to protect black
voters' rights, the act was amended to require that elec
tions be conducted in both English and Spanish where a siz
able Spanish-speaking electorate exists.
She said that another concern of her organization is the
Reagan record for Latino appointments, which she called
"zilch."
Secretary of Education Terrel Bell's revocation last
week of the Carter administration's bilingual education
policies is an area of "major concern." she said
"The manner of the withdrawal was more of a shock
than the withdrawal itself," she said. "The old guidelines
remain in effect, but we were concerned that the president
used the new regulations as an example of burdensome'
regulations. The Hispanic community was not consulted
and we are also concerned about the philosophy of sending
this kind of problem back to the states.
Leaders of many of the 23 organizations making up the
National Hispanic Task Force will meet with President
Ronald Reagan at the White House today to talk about
those issues. Hernandez said
Hernandez saw one favorable feature in the new admin
istration: the access that she believes Hispanics will en
joy. She said she has known Attorney General William
Smith for a long time. The fact that the president and
many of his key aides are from California gives them a
basic understanding of Latino problems, she said.
Court OKs Davis admissions policy
San Francisco — The UC-Davis law school may use a
preferential admissions policy for minorities, the state Su
preme Court ruled yesterday.
The 4-2 decision by Justice Frank Richardson reversed
lower court rulings. It held that procedures that con
sidered ethnic minority status when selecting the 1975
first-year class didn't violate non-minorities' rights.
The California tribunal said its ruling was controlled by
the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Allan Bakke
case, which involved racial quotas set at the UC-Davis
medical school. The federal court said race may be con
sidered in professional school admissions, but quotas can't
be set.
The admissions policy had been challenged by Glen De-
Ronde. a white who was one of 2238 applicants seeking en
rollment in King Hall, the law school, in 1975 That year,
406 applicants were offered admission, but Deßonde
wasn't one of them.
He sought a writ from Yolo County Superior Court
against the UC regents and law school dean, alleging ad
mission procedures were invalid because preference was
granted to minorities, denying him equal protection.
Although the trial court in 1976 said Deßonde would
have been unsuccessful anyway in seeking admission, it
found the admissions policy was discriminatory. It said
the policy violated equal protection rights. The university
then was' barred from using any admission criteria based
on an applicant's race, color or ethnic origin.
Immigration officials to work in field
Washington — Adopting a management tool used by
Chairman Mao. Acting Immigration Commissioner David
Crosland has ordered 10 of his top officials to do temporary
field work in border patrol offices, detention centers, air
ports and records offices to learn first-hand about the
agency's problems and the public's concerns.
The program announced yesterday is termed ' Mud
Training" by the Immigration and Naturalization Service
but it bears some similarity to a principle of the deceased
Chinese leader. Mao Zedong. Mao insisted that top bureau
crats do field work, such as farm labor, to ensure they not

lose touch with the concerns of ordinary citizens
In an interview, Crosland said, "I'm not a student of
Mao and I didn't know the program was similar to his. but
1 felt that some actual field work would be more useful
than simple field trips or classroom courses in giving our
people a first-hand sense of our problems and the concerns
the public has with us."
In (Quotations from Chairman Mao, the "little red
book" of the leader's sayings, is an April 1945 statement
calling on the party "to see that no comrade at any post is
divorced from the masses It should teach every comrade
to identify himself with the masses wherever he.goes
and. instead of standing above them, to immerse himself
among them ..."
The senior managers in the program will be working for
several days in areas that they supervise normally from
headquarters.
Crosland himself intends to spend several days working
with INS agents on horse patrol at the border between San
Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, the site of heaviest illegal en
try in the United States.

Crosland said the program would be more useful and
less costly than sending top agency executives to
classroom courses offered at a federal facility for senior
executives in Charlottesville, Va.

State, Pentagon disagree over bomb
Washington — Despite its emphasis on speaking with
one voice, the Ronald Reagan administration was struggl
ing with its first foreign policy flap yesterday because of
increasingly public disagreement between the State De
partment and the Pentagon over what to do about the neu
tron bomb.
At the center of the flap is Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, who this week repeated a statement that
caused him problems with the State Department last
week personally. Weinberger said, he supports deploying
neutron warheads in Europe.
Weinberger made his most recent statement on the is
sue although no decision has yet been made on the con
troversial weapon, which is designed to have a large hu
man kill factor while leaving buildings and others struc
tures relatively intact.
While the State Department tried to paper over Wein
berger's remarks of last week, it said yesterday that Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig has different priorities
where nuclear weapons are concerned.
William Dyess. a spokesman for the State Department,
said that Haig believes that the first priority of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should be fulfilling
its 1979 commitment to modernize its theater nuclear
forces by basing new U.S. Pershing missiles and I S.
ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe
By inference, a lower priority goes to Weinberger's fa
vored neutron weapons.
The neutron bomb issue is especially sensitive because
the question of whether or not to deploy it is an emotion
charged. politically controversial matter in Western Eu
rope Weinberger's initial statement supporting the neu
tron bomb came as an unwelcome surprise to allied gov
ernments in Europe.
Seeking to calm that reaction last week, the State De
partment said that U.S. policy remains unchanged from
that of the administration of former president Jimmy
Carter, which decided in 1978 not to deploy the neutron
bomb.
Weinberger's second assertion of support for the neu
tron weapons created additional problems for the Reagan
administration because it came only days after the presi
dent had cautioned members of his Cabinet not to debate in
public about issues that had not yet been decided
At the White House yesterday, Kama Small, a deputy
press secretary, initially told reporters — in response to
questions about neutron warheads — that "this situation is
under study" and that "we've been in full and extensive
consultation with our allies.
Her words seemed to suggest that the administration
was seriously asking members of NATO to station neu

But another press aide, Lyndon Allin, interrupted her
"There have been no discussions with the allies specifi

deployed." Allin said. "This decision (on making and
deploying the weapon > has not been fully considered, fully
discussed within the administration."
Hispanics fear civil rights loss
Washington — The Reagan administration presents a
threat to Hispanic civil rights despite the comparatively
strong Latino support for Republicans in 1980. the new
head of the Washington office of the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund said yesterday.
Antonia Hernandez, who will represent the California
based fund here, said that her major concern would be the
renewal of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which is sched

uled to expire in 1982 Originally designed to protect black
voters' rights, the act was amended to require that elec
tions be conducted in both English and Spanish where a siz
able Spanish-speaking electorate exists.
She said that another concern of her organization is the
Reagan record for Latino appointments, which she called
"zilch."
Secretary of Education Terrel Bell's revocation last
week of the Carter administration's bilingual education
policies is an area of "major concern." she said
"The manner of the withdrawal was more of a shock
than the withdrawal itself," she said. "The old guidelines
remain in effect, but we were concerned that the president
used the new regulations as an example of burdensome'
regulations. The Hispanic community was not consulted
and we are also concerned about the philosophy of sending
this kind of problem back to the states.
Leaders of many of the 23 organizations making up the
National Hispanic Task Force will meet with President
Ronald Reagan at the White House today to talk about
those issues. Hernandez said
Hernandez saw one favorable feature in the new admin

many of his key aides are from California gives them a

Court OKs Davis admissions policy
San Francisco — The UC-Davis law school may use a
preferential admissions policy for minorities, the state Su
preme Court ruled yesterday.
The 4-2 decision by Justice Frank Richardson reversed
lower court rulings. It held that procedures that con
sidered ethnic minority status when selecting the 1975
first-year class didn't violate non-minorities' rights.
The California tribunal said its ruling was controlled by
the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Allan Bakke
case, which involved racial quotas set at the UC-Davis
medical school. The federal court said race may be con
sidered in professional school admissions, but quotas can't
be set.
The admissions policy had been challenged by Glen De-
Ronde. a white who was one of 2238 applicants seeking en
rollment in King Hall, the law school, in 1975 That year,
406 applicants were offered admission, but Deßonde
wasn't one of them.
He sought a writ from Yolo County Superior Court
against the UC regents and law school dean, alleging ad
mission procedures were invalid because preference was
granted to minorities, denying him equal protection.
Although the trial court in 1976 said Deßonde would
have been unsuccessful anyway in seeking admission, it
found the admissions policy was discriminatory. It said
the policy violated equal protection rights. The university
then was' barred from using any admission criteria based
on an applicant's race, color or ethnic origin.
Immigration officials to work in field
Washington — Adopting a management tool used by
Chairman Mao. Acting Immigration Commissioner David
Crosland has ordered 10 of his top officials to do temporary
field work in border patrol offices, detention centers, air
ports and records offices to learn first-hand about the
agency's problems and the public's concerns.
The program announced yesterday is termed ' Mud
Training" by the Immigration and Naturalization Service
but it bears some similarity to a principle of the deceased
Chinese leader. Mao Zedong. Mao insisted that top bureau
crats do field work, such as farm labor, to ensure they not

lose touch with the concerns of ordinary citizens
In an interview, Crosland said, "I'm not a student of
Mao and I didn't know the program was similar to his. but

Immigration officials to work in field
Washington — Adopting a management tool used by
Chairman Mao. Acting Immigration Commissioner David
Crosland has ordered 10 of his top officials to do temporary
field work in border patrol offices, detention centers, air
ports and records offices to learn first-hand about the
agency's problems and the public's concerns.
The program announced yesterday is termed ' Mud
Training" by the Immigration and Naturalization Service
but it bears some similarity to a principle of the deceased
Chinese leader. Mao Zedong. Mao insisted that top bureau
crats do field work, such as farm labor, to ensure they not

lose touch with the concerns of ordinary citizens
In an interview, Crosland said, "I'm not a student of
Mao and I didn't know the program was similar to his. but
1 felt that some actual field work would be more useful
than simple field trips or classroom courses in giving our
people a first-hand sense of our problems and the concerns
the public has with us."
In (Quotations from Chairman Mao, the "little red
book" of the leader's sayings, is an April 1945 statement
calling on the party "to see that no comrade at any post is
divorced from the masses It should teach every comrade
to identify himself with the masses wherever he.goes
and. instead of standing above them, to immerse himself
among them ..."
The senior managers in the program will be working for
several days in areas that they supervise normally from
headquarters.
Crosland himself intends to spend several days working
with INS agents on horse patrol at the border between San
Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, the site of heaviest illegal en
try in the United States.

Crosland said the program would be more useful and
less costly than sending top agency executives to
classroom courses offered at a federal facility for senior
executives in Charlottesville, Va.

State, Pentagon disagree over bomb
Washington — Despite its emphasis on speaking with
one voice, the Ronald Reagan administration was struggl
ing with its first foreign policy flap yesterday because of
increasingly public disagreement between the State De
partment and the Pentagon over what to do about the neu
tron bomb.
At the center of the flap is Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, who this week repeated a statement that
caused him problems with the State Department last
week personally. Weinberger said, he supports deploying
neutron warheads in Europe.
Weinberger made his most recent statement on the is
sue although no decision has yet been made on the con
troversial weapon, which is designed to have a large hu
man kill factor while leaving buildings and others struc
tures relatively intact.
While the State Department tried to paper over Wein
berger's remarks of last week, it said yesterday that Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig has different priorities
where nuclear weapons are concerned.
William Dyess. a spokesman for the State Department,
said that Haig believes that the first priority of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should be fulfilling
its 1979 commitment to modernize its theater nuclear
forces by basing new U.S. Pershing missiles and I S.
ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe
By inference, a lower priority goes to Weinberger's fa
vored neutron weapons.
The neutron bomb issue is especially sensitive because
the question of whether or not to deploy it is an emotion
charged. politically controversial matter in Western Eu
rope Weinberger's initial statement supporting the neu
tron bomb came as an unwelcome surprise to allied gov
ernments in Europe.
Seeking to calm that reaction last week, the State De
partment said that U.S. policy remains unchanged from
that of the administration of former president Jimmy
Carter, which decided in 1978 not to deploy the neutron
bomb.
Weinberger's second assertion of support for the neu
tron weapons created additional problems for the Reagan
administration because it came only days after the presi
dent had cautioned members of his Cabinet not to debate in
public about issues that had not yet been decided
At the White House yesterday, Kama Small, a deputy
press secretary, initially told reporters — in response to
questions about neutron warheads — that "this situation is
under study" and that "we've been in full and extensive
consultation with our allies.
Her words seemed to suggest that the administration
was seriously asking members of NATO to station neu
tron. or "enhanced radiation" warheads, on European ter
ritory.
But another press aide, Lyndon Allin, interrupted her
"There have been no discussions with the allies specifi
cally on whether or not it (the neutron weapon) should be
deployed." Allin said. "This decision (on making and
deploying the weapon > has not been fully considered, fully
discussed within the administration."
Hispanics fear civil rights loss
Washington — The Reagan administration presents a
threat to Hispanic civil rights despite the comparatively
strong Latino support for Republicans in 1980. the new
head of the Washington office of the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund said yesterday.
Antonia Hernandez, who will represent the California
based fund here, said that her major concern would be the
renewal of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which is sched

uled to expire in 1982 Originally designed to protect black
voters' rights, the act was amended to require that elec
tions be conducted in both English and Spanish where a siz
able Spanish-speaking electorate exists.
She said that another concern of her organization is the
Reagan record for Latino appointments, which she called
"zilch."
Secretary of Education Terrel Bell's revocation last
week of the Carter administration's bilingual education
policies is an area of "major concern." she said
"The manner of the withdrawal was more of a shock
than the withdrawal itself," she said. "The old guidelines
remain in effect, but we were concerned that the president
used the new regulations as an example of burdensome'
regulations. The Hispanic community was not consulted
and we are also concerned about the philosophy of sending
this kind of problem back to the states.
Leaders of many of the 23 organizations making up the
National Hispanic Task Force will meet with President
Ronald Reagan at the White House today to talk about
those issues. Hernandez said
Hernandez saw one favorable feature in the new admin
istration: the access that she believes Hispanics will en
joy. She said she has known Attorney General William
Smith for a long time. The fact that the president and
many of his key aides are from California gives them a
basic understanding of Latino problems, she said.
Court OKs Davis admissions policy
San Francisco — The UC-Davis law school may use a
preferential admissions policy for minorities, the state Su
preme Court ruled yesterday.
The 4-2 decision by Justice Frank Richardson reversed
lower court rulings. It held that procedures that con
sidered ethnic minority status when selecting the 1975
first-year class didn't violate non-minorities' rights.
The California tribunal said its ruling was controlled by
the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Allan Bakke
case, which involved racial quotas set at the UC-Davis
medical school. The federal court said race may be con
sidered in professional school admissions, but quotas can't
be set.
The admissions policy had been challenged by Glen De-
Ronde. a white who was one of 2238 applicants seeking en
rollment in King Hall, the law school, in 1975 That year,
406 applicants were offered admission, but Deßonde
wasn't one of them.
He sought a writ from Yolo County Superior Court
against the UC regents and law school dean, alleging ad
mission procedures were invalid because preference was
granted to minorities, denying him equal protection.
Although the trial court in 1976 said Deßonde would
have been unsuccessful anyway in seeking admission, it
found the admissions policy was discriminatory. It said
the policy violated equal protection rights. The university
then was' barred from using any admission criteria based
on an applicant's race, color or ethnic origin.
