# Change in steward election process
## USE to vote on by-law amendments 
### John Boyle 
In a meeting of United Stanford
Employees (USE) last night, more
than 30 members determined the final
changes to the chapter's proposed new
bylaws, to be voted on by the member
ship-at-large beginning Feb. 20.
Major changes include:
— allowing associate members, who
pay dues but don't work under USE
negotiated contracts, the right to run
for chapter offices, excluding that of
chief steward;
— expanding the executive commit
tee from 8 to 12;

— lowering the quorum for member
ship meetings from a proposed 25 to
15;
— cutting the terms of chapter of
ficers from two years to one; and
— making the office of chief steward
subject to election by the chapter
membership, rather than by the stew
ards' council.
The meeting, chaired by chapter
Treasurer Jack Foley, often broke
into intense debate over proposed
amendments, particularly that con
cerning the chief steward's election
procedures.
Supporters of that motion argued
that the chief steward's influence has
increased since USE affiliated with
the AFL-CIO and that members
should have more voice in that of
ficer's actions.

Other members felt that the stew
ards' council would be more likely to
select the best qualified person for the
job. claiming that the chief steward
election might turn into a "popularity
contest."
The motion finally carried with 22 in
favor and 10 opposed.
Voting on the proposed new bylaws
will be by mail. Ballots will be counted
on the evening of March 9.
In other business, a proposal was
made for a petition responding to
President Donald Kennedy's "dear
friend'' letters to Stanford employees
discouraging clerical workers from
unionizing.
In addition, congratulations were
extended to Gerald Dabbs. a chapter
member who was fired and recently
reinstated with a $7000 settlement.
