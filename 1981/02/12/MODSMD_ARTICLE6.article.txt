### Los Angeles Times 
Las Vegas — A room service
busboy was arrested late yesterday
on suspicion of arson and murder in
the fire that shot like a blowtorch
through the east tower of the Las
Vegas Hilton Hotel, killing eight
persons and injuring 242.
Cline, the first person to report
the fire, was booked on eight counts
of murder and one count of arson.
The busboy was working the
night of the blaze picking up room
service trays from the 21st floor
down Cooper said that Cline was
on the eighth floor of the east tow
er, where the fire broke out. "He
went from room to room knocking
on doors and he entered one room
and used a phone to call security."
said Cooper.
Police refused to discuss motiva
tion for the arson or disclose any
other details of their investigation
But there were indications that
Cline was given a lie detector test
Cline was booked for only the
first of four separate fires that
broke out at the Hilton beween 8
p m and midnight Tuesday. Coop
er said the busboy was not believed
to have been involved in the other
fires
"We have no explanation yet for
the other fires." Cooper said
Before the arrest, the Hilton Ho
tels Corp had offered a $100,000 re
ward for information leading to the
apprehension of a suspect It was
not immediately clear what would
happen to the money
Seven in custody
Six other persons were taken into
custody and interrogated by detec
tives shortly after the fire But Lt

John Conner, a member of the Las
Vegas homicide squad, said that all
six satisfied officers that they were
innocent — and none was arrested.
The fire was the second at a ma
jor Las Vegas hotel to claim lives in
the past three months It and a
blaze that killed 84 persons last
Nov. 21 at the MGM Grand Hotel,
two miles away, caused worry
among Las Vegas officials about
the city's image as a tourist attrac
tion. They said it was too early to
tell whether business would be
hurt.
Hotel fire safety
The blaze also raised new con
cern about fire safety in Nevada
high-rise hotels.
Neither the MGM Grand nor the
burning wing of the Hilton had
smoke detectors that guests could
hear — and neither had sprinkler
systems. At both hotels, officials
said, smoke was the main killer.
As guests screamed from broken
windows and fashioned makeshift
escape ropes from torn sheets,
more than 4000 persons were evac
uated from the Hilton — 110 of
them in an airlift from the roof by
military, city and private heli
copters. One man fell — or jumped
— to his death from the 16th floor
Six in critical condition
Six persons were reported in
critical condition One, a fireman,
was placed in intensive care and
two others were hospitalized in co
ronary care facilities
The first flames were reported
