## Optimistic, Chinese await Woodcock's replacement 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Beijing — The Jimmy Carter
era in Sino-American relations
ends this week with U.S. Am
bassador Leonard Woodcock's
departure from Beijing. But to
China's delight, and many
diplomats' surprise. Carter's
China policy shows strong signs
of surviving under the new ad
ministration.
Former United Auto Workers
President Woodcock, who nego
tiated diplomatic relations dur
ing two hectic months at the end
of 1978. got his walking papers
within a few days after Presi
dent Ronald Reagan took office.
In ordinary circumstances, the
ambassador's super-prompt de
parture tomorrow should have
inspired considerable edginess
here, especially with a major
China policy review going on at
the State Department.
Last Friday, a week before
Woodcock was due to leave, the
State Department spokesman in
Washington declared that the
1978 communique "contains sol
emn undertakings of the United
States, and we shall naturally
honor them." Previous Reagan
spokesmen had gone no further
than promising to adhere to the
Taiwan Relations Act. which
pledges U.S. support to Taiwan.
Beijing's response has been that
that congressional act has no
standing in international law.
The great imponderable re
maining was whether Reagan's
implied acceptance of the nor
malization terms conceded by
Carter would be accompanied
by some matching gesture to
Taiwan. Reagan advisers in the
past had spoken of sending a
personal representative of the
president to Taipei. And Taiwan
has been pressing for per
mission to buy advanced fighter
planes from U.S. companies. On
both scores the Chinese have
been adamant that any con
cessions to Taiwan would en
danger the existing relationship
with Beijing.
Threatens expulsion
China underscored that by
threatening to expel the Dutch
ambassador here if the Nether
\ands proceeded with sate of two
submarines to Taiwan. Dutch
officials had defended the sub
sale as private business, but the
Chinese ridiculed that As one
published commentary put it,
"There is a whale of a dif
ference between submarines
and butter or beef." It went on
to say that "it is certainly not
the people of Taiwan" — the
phrase the U.S. Congress wrote
into the Taiwan Relations Act —
"who want to buy the sub
marines."
Whether the message came
through as it clearly was in
tended to in Washington, it was
obviously heard in the Hague.
Last week, the Dutch Par
liament reversed itself and dis
approved the submarine deal.
The Chinese have no expecta
tions that the next American

ambassador, as yet unnamed,
will prove as sympathetic as
Woodcock. But they are known
to be almost euphoric over Alex
ander Haig's appointment as
secretary of state. Develop
ments so far would seem to jus
tify that sentiment.
Chinese leaders got to know
Haig when he headed the techni
cal advance party for then-Pres
ident Richard Nixon's historic
trip to Beijing in 1972. Haig was
the first American general to
set foot on the mainland since
the Communist victory in 1949.
Apparently some valuable per
sonal relationships were estab
lished with the Chinese military
then, and Chinese sources say
Haig kept them alive while he
was commander-in-chief of
NATO and later when he was out
of office.
Authoritative sources said
the statement issued at the
State Department Friday had
been drafted shortly after Rea
gan's election by a middle-level
official held over from the
Carter administration The fact
that two months passed before
its issuance enhanced the belief
here that it had gone to the top
for approval.
That also seems confirmed by
its timing — at the height of
hostile exchanges between
Washington and Moscow. The
Chinese have argued all along
that only the Russians gain from
any disturbance to the status
quo on Taiwan.
Stability
Woodcock said his main con
cern was China's political sta
bility.
"For the first time since very
soon after I got here back in July
1977. things seem fluid again."
he told friends recently. It was
in July 1977 that Deng Xiaoping,
now effectively head of the re
gime, officially was restored to
office after the Cultural Revolu
tion. Deng has recently had to
fend off disputes within the
leadership over his pace of mod
ernization and the degree to
which Mao Zedong's record can
be safety revised.
Woodcock makes no secret of
his admiration for Deng as a
tactician, although he has said
he suspects the party vice chair
man can be pretty abrasive to
his colleagues. Three times
Deng has been purged from
leadership roles over his long
career as general and states
man. and there are still China
watchers who believe it could
happen again. They note that
the press has been building up
the image of another party vice
chairman. Chen Yun. 74, a spe
cialist in economic recovery
who is believed to be well-re
garded by all the factions in the
Politburo.
Quick recall
As a career labor leader.
Woodcock. 70. was not surprised
by his quick recall after Reagan

took office. He has told friends
he will not miss the bureau
cratic ways of government.
Woodcock noted that because
of U.S. policy requiring him to
avoid direct contact with the
Communist Party, he has never
met Hu Yaobang, the Chinese
party's general secretary, wide
ly expected to replace Hua in
the country's highest post later
this year.
He also said he was informed
he couldn't even write to Deng
Xiaoping after the latter retired
from his government post as
vice premier in September.
Then someone remembered
that in addition to being vice
chairman of the Communist
Party. Deng also held the sym
bolic post of chairman of the Na
tional Legislature's upper
house. It was decided the am
bassador could communicate
with Deng at the latter address.
