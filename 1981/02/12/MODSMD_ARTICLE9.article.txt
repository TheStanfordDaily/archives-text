# Czech industrial reform to stress quality
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Prague. Czechoslovakia — The Com
munist government has introduced a series
of changes designed to make industry more
efficient, but it rejects suggestions that
these changes are economic reforms.
The word reform is too closely associated
with the upheaval taking place in neighbor
ing Poland and is anathema to the highly or
thodox Czechoslovak regime headed by
Gustav Husak. who is both president and
party chief.
While Poland is undertaking a major re
form of its economic system under the pres
sure of a workers' revolt that started last
summer, the Czechoslovaks are putting into
effect a set of rules that are referrd to of
ficially as "new measures for the improve
ment of the system of planned management
of the economy.''
An academic economist said that new
rules to emphasize quality instead of quanti
ty could remove loss-making enterprises
and reduce the high costs that make the
country's engineering industry so ineffi
cient compared with its Western competi
tion.
The Czechoslovaks, who are among the
most orthodox central planners in East Eu
rope and close followers of the Soviet
Union's economic and political model, have
been slower to make changes in their man
agement system than their innovative
neighbors in Hungary and even Bulgaria.
Poland
The Czechoslovaks, despite their concern
about the political and economic upheaval
taking place across their northern border in
Poland, deny that the planning changes are
inspired by events in Poland.
In their cautious fashion, the Czechoslo
vak leaders started experimenting with new
measures three years ago in selected fac
tories.
Traditionally. Czechoslovak production
goals — as in the Soviet Union — have been
expressed in volume terms. Now. more so
phisticated specifications will be drawn.
"The old system was based on gross out

put," a planning official said. "The new
measures emphasize net output."
The measures are seen by Western
diplomats as an indication of increased con
cern in Prague for responding to workers'
demands. Leading political figures, includ
ing President Gustav Husak, have been
making more frequent visits to factories
than ever before.
Work stoppages
Twice this winter, short work stoppages
brought immediate responses from the gov
ernment . In one case, workers who had been
denied Christmas bonuses simply sat down
at their jobs. Within hours, the plant man
ager was given extra money to pay the
bonuses.
The steady slowdown in Czechoslovak ec
onomic growth is typical across Communist
East Europe and in the Soviet Union. The
impact is more noticeable here because
before World War 11, Czechoslovakia had a
higher standard than its eastern neighbors
and some West European countries.
Now Czechoslovaks have seen the Hun
garians and East Germans catch up with
them. Until about two years ago. even Po
land was approaching the Czechoslovak
level.
One reason for the slowdown in Czechoslo
vakia has been the official policy of direct
ing heavy investment to the eastern, Slovak,
half of the country, which before the war
was more agrarian than the western, Czech,
half.
Another is the spreading of investment
money too thinly. Throughout Prague, one
of the most beautiful cities in Europe, a
common sight is scaffolding that has been in
place many years but rarely has any work
ers on it. The priority project in Prague now
is an extension of the subway system.
Inefficiency
In the famous engineering industry, the
planners have allowed out-moded, ineffi
cient plants to continue functioning.
A trade expert said that of 600,000 varie
ties of engineering products recognized in
the world, Czechoslovakia makes 66 per

cent. The United States, he said, makes 50
percent of the different products, West Ger
many 20 percent and Japan 17 percent.
The economist was asked if Czechoslovak
industry included plants in which a handful
of workers were hand-crafting machines
that were too expensive and too difficult to
sell and he replied, "Exactly."
With the new measures, outward-looking
economists hope that Czechoslovakia will
begin to concentrate on making products
that will sell better in Western markets and
command higher prices in Communist mar
kets by coming closer to world standards.
"We must produce what we can sell and
not try to sell what we produce," the econo
mist said.
Trade imbalance
Czechoslovakia has seen its exports to
both markets rise substantially but not
enough to cover imports.
Prague gets 95 percent of its oil from the
Soviet Union. The current price is substan
tially below world prices, but the cost is ris
ing sharply and must be paid with ever-in
creasing exports to the Soviets.
Prague has also been forced to import
grain, especially from the United States.
Under the new measures, it is likely to im
port more Western technology and buy
licenses to permit the production of high
quality goods. These can only be paid for by
increasing exports to Western countries at a
time when competition in world trade is es
pecially intense and world economic growth
slowed to a crawl.
Czechoslovakia reported 3 percent na
tional growth last year and a 3 percent rate
of inflation. Western experts believe that in
flation was actually two or three times that
high and was disguised by such devices as
model changes and relabeling.
Personal incomes have risen more slowly
than general output. The average wage last
year reached the equivalent of $300 a month,
a rise of only 2.5 percent over the 1979 fig
ure, because productivity did not reach the
official targets and many workers were
deprived of bonuses.

a rise of only 2.5 percent over the 1979 fig

official targets and many workers were
deprived of bonuses.
Prague. Czechoslovakia — The Com
munist government has introduced a series
of changes designed to make industry more
efficient, but it rejects suggestions that
these changes are economic reforms.
The word reform is too closely associated
with the upheaval taking place in neighbor
ing Poland and is anathema to the highly or
thodox Czechoslovak regime headed by
Gustav Husak. who is both president and
party chief.
While Poland is undertaking a major re
form of its economic system under the pres
sure of a workers' revolt that started last
summer, the Czechoslovaks are putting into
effect a set of rules that are referrd to of
ficially as "new measures for the improve
ment of the system of planned management
of the economy.''
An academic economist said that new
rules to emphasize quality instead of quanti
ty could remove loss-making enterprises
and reduce the high costs that make the
country's engineering industry so ineffi
cient compared with its Western competi
tion.
The Czechoslovaks, who are among the
most orthodox central planners in East Eu
rope and close followers of the Soviet
Union's economic and political model, have
been slower to make changes in their man
agement system than their innovative
neighbors in Hungary and even Bulgaria.
Poland
The Czechoslovaks, despite their concern
about the political and economic upheaval
taking place across their northern border in
Poland, deny that the planning changes are
inspired by events in Poland.
In their cautious fashion, the Czechoslo
vak leaders started experimenting with new
measures three years ago in selected fac
tories.
Traditionally. Czechoslovak production
goals — as in the Soviet Union — have been
expressed in volume terms. Now. more so
phisticated specifications will be drawn.
"The old system was based on gross out

put," a planning official said. "The new
measures emphasize net output."
The measures are seen by Western
diplomats as an indication of increased con
cern in Prague for responding to workers'
demands. Leading political figures, includ
ing President Gustav Husak, have been
making more frequent visits to factories
than ever before.
Work stoppages
Twice this winter, short work stoppages
brought immediate responses from the gov
ernment . In one case, workers who had been
denied Christmas bonuses simply sat down
at their jobs. Within hours, the plant man
ager was given extra money to pay the
bonuses.
The steady slowdown in Czechoslovak ec
onomic growth is typical across Communist
East Europe and in the Soviet Union. The
impact is more noticeable here because
before World War 11, Czechoslovakia had a
higher standard than its eastern neighbors
and some West European countries.
Now Czechoslovaks have seen the Hun
garians and East Germans catch up with
them. Until about two years ago. even Po
land was approaching the Czechoslovak
level.
One reason for the slowdown in Czechoslo
vakia has been the official policy of direct
ing heavy investment to the eastern, Slovak,
half of the country, which before the war
was more agrarian than the western, Czech,
half.
Another is the spreading of investment
money too thinly. Throughout Prague, one
of the most beautiful cities in Europe, a
common sight is scaffolding that has been in
place many years but rarely has any work
ers on it. The priority project in Prague now
is an extension of the subway system.
Inefficiency
In the famous engineering industry, the
planners have allowed out-moded, ineffi
cient plants to continue functioning.
A trade expert said that of 600,000 varie
ties of engineering products recognized in
the world, Czechoslovakia makes 66 per

cent. The United States, he said, makes 50
percent of the different products, West Ger
many 20 percent and Japan 17 percent.
The economist was asked if Czechoslovak
industry included plants in which a handful
of workers were hand-crafting machines
that were too expensive and too difficult to
sell and he replied, "Exactly."
With the new measures, outward-looking
economists hope that Czechoslovakia will
begin to concentrate on making products
that will sell better in Western markets and
command higher prices in Communist mar
kets by coming closer to world standards.
"We must produce what we can sell and
not try to sell what we produce," the econo
mist said.
Trade imbalance
Czechoslovakia has seen its exports to
both markets rise substantially but not
enough to cover imports.
Prague gets 95 percent of its oil from the
Soviet Union. The current price is substan
tially below world prices, but the cost is ris
ing sharply and must be paid with ever-in
creasing exports to the Soviets.
Prague has also been forced to import
grain, especially from the United States.
Under the new measures, it is likely to im
port more Western technology and buy
licenses to permit the production of high
quality goods. These can only be paid for by
increasing exports to Western countries at a
time when competition in world trade is es
pecially intense and world economic growth
slowed to a crawl.
Czechoslovakia reported 3 percent na
tional growth last year and a 3 percent rate
of inflation. Western experts believe that in
flation was actually two or three times that
high and was disguised by such devices as
model changes and relabeling.
Personal incomes have risen more slowly
than general output. The average wage last
year reached the equivalent of $300 a month,
a rise of only 2.5 percent over the 1979 fig
ure, because productivity did not reach the
official targets and many workers were
