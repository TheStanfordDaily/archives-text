# Rally decries El Salvador aid
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
The United States' increasing in
volvement in the violence in El
Salvador foreshadows the beginning
of a new Vietnam, according to speak
ers at a White Plaza rally yesterday.
Prof. Richard Fagen said that the
only "preventive force" forestalling a
U.S. military escalation in El
Salvador was the "concern of people"
in groups like the one at Stanford.
All three speakers emphasized the
lack of accurate information in the
press and the importance of student
protest.
Estela Ampuero of Casa El
Salvador, a San Francisco-based or
ganization committed to changing
U.S. policy towards that country,
spoke out against the " Vietnamization
in El Salvador." She said that the
United States should let the
"Salvadoran people decide their own
future."
Ampuero said she believes the "in
creased involvement wanted by the
Reagan administration will only pro
long the situation" in that country.
If the military aid to El Salvador
stopped, "the situation would be re

solved because the people know what
they want," Ampuero said. Instead,
"Americans may die."
Ampuero said that increased in
volvement must be opposed: "We all
learned from Vietnam and we don't
want to repeat it. So we have to say no
to U.S. (military) intervention."
Fagen, a Political Science Depart
ment specialist in developmental
problems in Central America, at
tacked U.S. aid to El Salvador on the
grounds that such "levels of support
do nothing except kill people and in
tensify the feelings of the people
against oppression."
Fagen said the feeling of enmity
"brings in more gunships. more op
pression" and eventually leads to the
interference of the U.S. armed forces,
"in other words, Vietnam "
Diane Richards, a graduate student
in bilingual education and a represent
ative of Amnesty International, spoke
out against the "nature of the lan
guage the press uses to describe" the
situation in El Salvador. She said that
the El Salvador junta is usually de
scribed as "moderate" and that "non
lethal" American aid is said to help in

"logistics, communication, and in
telligence."
Of the estimated 8000 deaths in El
Salvador since the U.S.-backed coup in
October 1979, about 6000 of them have
been linked by Amnesty International
to government forces, Richards said.
These deaths are attributed by the
government and the press to
"guerilla" activity; a means the gov
ernment uses, according to Richards,
to "evade accountability for extra-le
gal measures."
Amnesty International discovered
that most of the government's oppo
nents and their sympathizers are "not
generally shown to have any direct in
volvement in armed guerrilla activi
ty," said Richards.
Thus the "non-lethal" aid is used,
according to Richards, in "detention,
torture, and killing" by the govern
ment's police and army.
Richards also said that "land seized
for agrarian reforfln " by the so-called
moderate government is turned over
to government members.
Ampuero, who went to El Salvador
last summer on a fact-finding mission
for the Archdiocese of San Francisco's
Social Justice Commission, said since
the 1979 coup the country has been in
creasingly "divided between those
who have and those who don't have."
Ampuero said she met with the lead
ers of the Democratic Revolutionary
Front (FDRi and found them not
"Marxist-Leninist radicals as they
are portrayed in the U.S. press."
The FDR did have some Soviet
arms, but, Ampuero said, it is well
known that "any type of gun can be
bought on the black market." She
pointed out that the FDR also had
American arms and said she hoped in
the future American press would not
"fall into red-baiting."
She said the situation in El Salvador
is "not a question of extreme left and
extreme right" as she feels it is pre
sented in the U.S. press.
The repression in El Salvador came
only from the right-wing government
and the people are fighting to stop this,
said Ampuero. They are fighting for
the FDR. who "represent all sectors

of the Salvadoran people," she said.
All three speakers underscored the
importance of student involvement in
opposing escalation of U.S. military
aid to El Salvador. Fagen pointed out
that the condition linking U.S. aid to
El Salvador to progress in the in
vestigation into the murder of four
American nuns in that country has
been lifted by the Reagan adminis
tration.
Ampuero urged students to unite
against the repression in El Salvador
as she believes the combined efforts of
all the students could be effective. "It
is time to get involved to bring the
question of El Salvador home,"said
Ampuero.
A spokesman for the El Salvador
Solidarity Committee at Stanford said
the purpose of the rally was to "in
crease the awareness of the communi
ty to a potentially dangerous situ
ation." Between speeches at the rally,
guitarist David Borough playing songs
in support of El Salvador, and or
ganizer Craig Richards read a press
release from a regional conference of
six student groups held recently which
stated that the groups are "joined to
gether to advance the cause of the es
tablishment of a democratic and popu
lar government in El Salvador."

She said the situation in El Salvador

of the Salvadoran people," she said.
All three speakers underscored the
importance of student involvement in
opposing escalation of U.S. military
aid to El Salvador. Fagen pointed out
that the condition linking U.S. aid to
El Salvador to progress in the in
vestigation into the murder of four
American nuns in that country has
been lifted by the Reagan adminis
tration.
Ampuero urged students to unite
against the repression in El Salvador
as she believes the combined efforts of
all the students could be effective. "It
is time to get involved to bring the
question of El Salvador home,"said
Ampuero.
A spokesman for the El Salvador
Solidarity Committee at Stanford said
the purpose of the rally was to "in
crease the awareness of the communi
ty to a potentially dangerous situ
ation." Between speeches at the rally,
guitarist David Borough playing songs
in support of El Salvador, and or
ganizer Craig Richards read a press
release from a regional conference of
six student groups held recently which
stated that the groups are "joined to
gether to advance the cause of the es
tablishment of a democratic and popu
lar government in El Salvador."
The United States' increasing in
volvement in the violence in El
Salvador foreshadows the beginning
of a new Vietnam, according to speak
ers at a White Plaza rally yesterday.
Prof. Richard Fagen said that the
only "preventive force" forestalling a
U.S. military escalation in El
Salvador was the "concern of people"
in groups like the one at Stanford.
All three speakers emphasized the
lack of accurate information in the
press and the importance of student
protest.
Estela Ampuero of Casa El
Salvador, a San Francisco-based or
ganization committed to changing
U.S. policy towards that country,
spoke out against the " Vietnamization
in El Salvador." She said that the
United States should let the
"Salvadoran people decide their own
future."
Ampuero said she believes the "in
creased involvement wanted by the
Reagan administration will only pro
long the situation" in that country.
If the military aid to El Salvador
stopped, "the situation would be re

solved because the people know what
they want," Ampuero said. Instead,
"Americans may die."
Ampuero said that increased in
volvement must be opposed: "We all
learned from Vietnam and we don't
want to repeat it. So we have to say no
to U.S. (military) intervention."
Fagen, a Political Science Depart
ment specialist in developmental
problems in Central America, at
tacked U.S. aid to El Salvador on the
grounds that such "levels of support
do nothing except kill people and in
tensify the feelings of the people
against oppression."
Fagen said the feeling of enmity
"brings in more gunships. more op
pression" and eventually leads to the
interference of the U.S. armed forces,
"in other words, Vietnam "
Diane Richards, a graduate student
in bilingual education and a represent
ative of Amnesty International, spoke
out against the "nature of the lan
guage the press uses to describe" the
situation in El Salvador. She said that
the El Salvador junta is usually de
scribed as "moderate" and that "non
lethal" American aid is said to help in

"logistics, communication, and in
telligence."
Of the estimated 8000 deaths in El
Salvador since the U.S.-backed coup in
October 1979, about 6000 of them have
been linked by Amnesty International
to government forces, Richards said.
These deaths are attributed by the
government and the press to
"guerilla" activity; a means the gov
ernment uses, according to Richards,
to "evade accountability for extra-le
gal measures."
Amnesty International discovered
that most of the government's oppo
nents and their sympathizers are "not
generally shown to have any direct in
volvement in armed guerrilla activi
ty," said Richards.
Thus the "non-lethal" aid is used,
according to Richards, in "detention,
torture, and killing" by the govern
ment's police and army.
Richards also said that "land seized
for agrarian reforfln " by the so-called
moderate government is turned over
to government members.
Ampuero, who went to El Salvador
last summer on a fact-finding mission
for the Archdiocese of San Francisco's
Social Justice Commission, said since
the 1979 coup the country has been in
creasingly "divided between those
who have and those who don't have."
Ampuero said she met with the lead
ers of the Democratic Revolutionary
Front (FDRi and found them not
"Marxist-Leninist radicals as they
are portrayed in the U.S. press."
The FDR did have some Soviet
arms, but, Ampuero said, it is well
known that "any type of gun can be
bought on the black market." She
pointed out that the FDR also had
American arms and said she hoped in
the future American press would not
