# Friday the 13th club flouts triskaidekaphobiacs' fear
## 
### 
Philadelphia, Pa. (AP) — At 8:13 this morn
ing, members of Philadelphia's Friday the 13th
Club will walk under a ladder, eat a breakfast
of 13 items, break mirrors, spill salt, open um
brellas, joke about black cats and light three
cigarettes on one match. The ceremony will
wrap up at 10:13 a.m.
"There's no such thing as bad luck," said
Philip Klein, the 74-year-old club president.
"People ought to have more courage, show
more guts, and do more things, and not hide be
hind excuses, or superstitions."
Klein is a retired newspaper publisher,
former college president and city planner who
formed the club 45 years ago and is the only ori
ginal member still active. The club has 13
members and meets every Friday the 13th to
give lie to the idea of triskaidekaphobia — fear
of the number 13.
Those who are superstitious consider Friday
the 13th the unluckiest of all days.
But Klein said, "Superstitions relating to 13,
or any kind of superstitions, are just silly. They
are hangups for people who can't cope with
things on their own and can't afford a psy
chiatrist."

Klein said the Friday the 13th Club "started
as a gimmick" in 1936. "I was in the advertis
ing business at the time, and it was a good way
to take people to lunch and entertain cus
tomers," he said.
The fuss over Friday the 13th, according to
some references, stems from the fact that
Christ was crucified on Friday, and 13 men
were present at the Last Supper. There is also
a Viking fable in which 12 gods were invited to
a banquet but 13 showed up and one was killed.
So the superstition says that if you must dine
on Friday the 13th don't eat with 12 others at
the table. Legend says the first or last to rise
from the table will die within a year.
Klein's response: "Puremalarky. It's never
happened with us."
On the first Friday the 13th of every year the
club elects Klein president.
"I nominate myself and then close the nomi
nations because I always pick up the tab. This
year there are three Friday the 13ths, in Febru
ary, March and November, and it's going to be
expensive, which is the unluckiest part of the
whole thing."
