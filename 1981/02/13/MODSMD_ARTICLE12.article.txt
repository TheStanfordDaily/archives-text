Where'd you get all this fancy
fgltitionship stuff?
— Bogart's ghost in Play it
Again. Sam
As Valentine's Day ap
proaches, and thoughts of shiny
heart-shaped boxes and glisten
ing red roses wrapped in tissue
paper fill the heads of
sophomores and seniors alike, it
seems that a single word is on
everyone's lips, or at least
lodged in everyone's throats —
Relationships.
, What exactly is a Rela
tionship? Relationships are
something like hiccups — ev
eryone knows exactly what they
are, but it's difficult to put into
words. A relationship (small
"r") might be nothing more
than a mundane "hi." ex
changed in White Plaza with a
dimly-remembered compatriot
from freshman English, but a
Relationship is always a once
in-a-lifetime. all-or-nothing,
riow-or-never matter. A Rela
tionship occupies your body and
soul like a private demon, at
least until the requisite three of
four months have passed and the
demon runs off to greener
pastures.
I People talk about Rela
tionships much more than they
have them. At any given time in
Jour life, you never have enough
Lelationships, or you have too
many. A Relationship is like a
Chinese restaurant - you may
search for the perfect one all
your life without ever turning up
anything more than a passable
mu-shu pork or a tolerable
Szechuan beef. You're always
hearing of a great new place
that just opened up in Mountain
View, and despite past ex
rriences. decide to drive down
check it out . . .
The ('happie and Inside Stan
ford give the feeling that the
only relationships that exist on
tihe Stanford campus are con
fined to the bedroom, or in most
cases, the dorm room. That cer
tainly seems to be how most of
the country (most of the
world?) sees California: as the
thrusting promontory of the sex
ual freedom movement, a haven
of self-indulgence, where free
love, free sex, and wife-swap

ping are as common as hot tubs
and cocaine
But when you get right down
to it, most of California is very
conservative, even traditional,
in its sexual mores. As as Cali
fornia goes, so goes Stanford.
Sitting in the Coffee House,
drinking your Sumatra blend,
the kind of remarks you over
hear usually deal with the finer
points of courtship etiquette:
for example. "I told him that if
he wanted to go out with me, he
had to ask me at least a month
in advance!" Never juicy stuff
like. "I couldn't wait to get my
hands on his creamy white but
tocks!"
But if California relationships
are not all they're cracked up to
be in terms of sexual wan
tonness. they do seem to less
neurotic than their East coast
counterparts: the gentle
breezes that play across White
Plaza seem to whisper "go with
the flow." and "love the one
you're with," a last surviving
echo of the lenient '60s. In con
trast, the snow-covered
Harvard commons or a wind
swept Morningside Heights
rules out all but the hardiest and
most dedicated of relationships
— it's so much easier just stay
home, and stay warm.
The clement weather and
nurturing environment of the
Stanford campus impresses
itself on all that happens within
its tree-lined borders, and the
inevitable results are rela
tionships as undemanding and
as comfortably laid-back as a
sunny patch of grass behind
Stern. This kind of relationship
is almost a prenatal rela
tionship — one hardly has to
worry about the real world at
all, just float happily along
within the protective womb of
Mother Stanford.
As conventional and as (dare
I say it?) superficial as many of
the relationships at Stanford
seem to be, some mention must
be made of the sizable minority
that defies the usual sexual ster
otyping. It's not onlv acceptable
table but downright fashionable
to be experimental in your sex
ual outlook: homosexual, heter
osexual, bisexual, asexual,

transsexual . . . you name it.
Just by mixing and matching,
you can come up with a fascinat
ing variety of relationships: tri
angles. rectangles, pentagons,
menaces a treize, and so on.
The situations that result
from such sexual freedom are
startling to a newcomer in this
carnal lotus land. For example,
one woman found herself com
peting with her best friend for a
particularly juicy male, the
complication being that her best
friend was a man. The small
scale repercussions are just as
troublesome. At a recent party,
I found — much to my embar
rassment — that I have been
flirting madly with a woman
who had arrived earlier with her
lesbian lover. I shudder to think
of the proper Valentine's Day
etiquette in such cases: who do
you send flowers to in a menage
a tmis? (And you thought
jealousy was a problem in a
simple monogamous rela
tionships. )
There is always an air of quiet
desperation about Valentine's
Day. What is it about the 14th of
February that wrests so many
hasty and ill-advised declara
tions of love from the tender
young lips of Stanford students?
Why the feeling of now or nev
er? — either commit yourself
with a bunch of smarmy red
roses from Stanford Florists,
or forever hold your peace.
There is simply no reason why
Valentine's Day should be as
sociated so strongly in our
minds with little pink hearts and
fluffy white carnations. In fact,
one could make a strong argu
ment that the profusion of heart
shaped dollies that appears in
store windows at this time of
year only serves to cheapen and
commercialize a holiday that
is dedicated to one of the most
basic and enjoyable of human
vices — love. I don't propose the

hearts and cupids be done away
with entirely, as that would be
on a par with banishing Santa
Claus or the Easter Bunny. But
surely some variations on the
time-worn themes would be
welcome. How tedious to get the
same rose or the same box of
Barton's chocolates year after
year, and how insipid a way to
suddenly announce your ex
istence to the special someone.
Valentine's Day gifts, like
any gifts, call for some imagina
tion and originality, and in a
community as large and as di
verse as Stanford, one should
make the best of what's avail
able. Here are a few suggestions
for unconventional V.D. (Valen
tine's Day) tactics:
— The English Approach. Write
a few poignant lines from
Eliot's The Wasteland on a
scrap of notebook paper, and
lose it somewhere in the lining
of your tweed jacket.
— The Philosophy Approach.
Arrange to have your beloved
discover you lying face down on
the floor of his or her room, and
start swinging as soon as he or
she approaches.
— The Computer Science Ap
proach. Send the following
message to your beloved's ter
minal: "ROSES RED VI
OLETS BLUE TTY 35 LOVES
TTY 61."
— The Neic Wave Approach.
With fluorescent blue spray
paint, write "BE MY VALEN
TINE YOU DEPRESSING
FlG'' on your beloved's door.
— The B-School Approach.
Take your heloved out for drinks
at the British Banker's Club,
drop a compliment about his or
her assets, and then offer to
start a consulting firm together.
— The Chappie Approach.
Plaster his or her car with dog
turds.
