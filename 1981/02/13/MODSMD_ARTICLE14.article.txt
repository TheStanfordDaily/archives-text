## Life here and 'there':a world of difference 
### 
As any recent Stanford gradu
ate will tell you, there is a huge
discrepancy between life in the
real world and life here. I think
it is a disgrace. Forced to live in
a state of isolation for four
years, students here forget how
one goes about living in the real
world. We become intellectual,
socially maladjusted human
beings.
Here is a copy of a letter that I
recently received from a
former student who made the
jump into the real world last
year:
"Michael:
Here I am in the real world,
and I'm miserable. I just cannot
seem to adjust to this new real
life.
A few nights ago I went to a
party. I truly did not know how

to act. I'm used to Stanford
parties, with Stanford women,
but here, with these real world
women, . . . well . . . Okay,
what are you supposed to do
when a girl approaches you with
a smile on her face and a gleam
in her eye, but she wants to do
more than get help on an engi
neering problem set? I know it
sounds far-fetched, but that's
the way women are out here.
Yesterday, at work, I told my
boss that I had some questions
and that I would like to see him
during his office hours. He told
me he was usually in his office
the whole day. Yet. when I went
to him later that day, he told me
he was busy. Doesn't he realize
that if he posts office hours from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m., he should be
willing to answer questions dur
ing that time. I just don't get it.
Last night was the worst inci
dent of all. I took a date to a res
taurant. Of course, I did not
think I needed any money. I still
had my old Stanford meal
ticket, Plan A. However, when
the waiter brought me the
check, and I flashed him my
meal ticket, he told me he ac
cepted cash only. It was never
like that at Stanford. I don't
need to say much more, other
than that I washed more dishes
that night during all my years of
hashing.
Michael, everything out here
is so different. It's so real."
Consider, the automatic ac
cess that students have to all the
University's beautiful build
ings. Take Green Library. This
place is more similar to the New
York Plaza Hotel than to a col
lege library. Yet all a student
needs is an I D. card and he's
there. That's just not real.
There should some form of dis
crimination.

The administration should do
us all a favor and change Green
Library into "Studio Green."
Without a doubt it would be the
hottest, most exclusive library
club in town.
I can see it now: the time:
8:00 on a Saturday night. The
place: Studio Green. Already
there is a crowd outside the
door. Fred Hargadon is standing
just inside deciding who will be
given admittance. Students are
frantically waving their well
polished books over their heads.
They are desperately trying to
catch Fred's attention but to no
avail. Only the chic, jet-set,
hard-core SU students get ad
mitted to Studio Green.
Suddenly, a chauffeur-driven,
hot pink Schwinn bicycle pulls
up in front. Fred spots the
fabulous brunette that gets off
the bicycle and quickly starts
clearing the path. The crowd is
in awe as they watch Kathy
Stanfordchickovich, an English
major pulling a 3.85, walk by
them. Many students leave at
this point and go across the
street to Meyer, the town's
sleazy, low-class library-club.
They know that with red-hots
like Stanfordchickovich around,
they have no chance of getting
into Green.
It's just a typical night at Stu
dio Green.
By transforming Green Li
brary into Studio Green, stu
dents would learn that in the'
real world, people are not all
treated equally. As it is now,
there is a complete lack of dis
crimination on this campus.
Another conspicuous dispari
ty between SU and RW (Real
World), is the virtual non-ex
istence of any penal code
against academic misde
meanors. Consider the crime of

cheating, for example. People
on this campus cheat constantly
because they feel no threat of
being punished. Not only does
this contribute toward an im
moral society, but it also allows
students to leave this school
thinking that crime pays.
In order to make the school
more closely resemble the real
world, the administration
should create something simi
lar to a vice squad. An honor
squad, for example, would con
sist of students proctoring ex
ams with guns in their hands.
Next time Steve P. Chem were
to glance at his neighbor's paper
during a biology test, a proctor
would be there to shoot him
Maybe Steve would be unable to
finish the test, but consider the
valuable lesson that he would
have learned about real life.
Of course, the most damaging
fake aspect of this campus is the
ease with which students can ar
range to see President Donald
Kennedy. Think of the implica
tions of this. A president of a
major university, and a Ken
nedy, and yet he walks around
the university without any bod
yguards. C'mon, fellas. That's
not like the real world.
Future assassins studying
here could be misled by the lack
of protection. Picture Joe As
sassin, a Stanford graduate,
calling up the White House to
make a jogging date with Presi
dent Ronald Reagan. He just
doesn't know any better.
I just hope that people in the
administration will read this
article and take pity on stu
dents. This campus really isn't
real enough.
