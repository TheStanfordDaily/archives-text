Academic freedom
We would like to bring to your
attention the grave crisis facing
Palestinian universities on the
Israeli-occupied West Bank. We
feel that all those who value the
institution of the free university
will be deeply concerned about
the violations of the academic
freedom of these institutions,
violations which have become a
persistent feature of the Israeli
military occupation.
University operations in the
West Bank, which we in
vestigated on a fact-finding visit
from November 24-30 1980, are
severely hampered by a series
of onerous and discriminatory
restrictions imposed by the mil
itary government. This situ
ation has been intensified with
the promulgation of Military
Order 854 in July, 1980 by the
Military Governor of the West
Bank. General Benjamin
Eliezar, an order which mod
ified prevailing Jordanian law
to extend military control to
Palestinian institution of higher
learnings, in direct violation of
both the Geneva and Hague con
ventions.
Under Order 854. all univer
sities must renew their operat
ing licenses annually, and must
submit lists of faculty and stu
dents to the military govern
ment for approval. New pro
grams, textbooks, requests for
educational equipment, and
public lectures come under the
purview of the military govern
ment. We discovered an ex
tensive censorship of books, the
denial or withholding of work
permits from foreign faculty,
restrictions on faculty and stu
dent associations, and a general

surveillance of cultural activi
ty. The most recent example
was the military government's
closure of Bir Zeit University in
November 1980, during the lat
ter's Palestine Week, a festival
celebrated for three years pre
viously without major prob
lems.
Such conditions, along with a
marked increase in the harass
ment and detention of students
and faculty by the Israeli Army,
have resulted in a constant in
terruption of teaching and
course work — and indeed in a
climate of fear — which have
made it extremely difficult for
students and professors to
pursue their work. As of this
writing, all three West Bank
universities - Bir Zeit Univer
sity, Al Najah University and
Bethlehem University - face un
certain futures.
We urge you to join with us in
endorsing the appeal which is
being sent to Israeli authorities
and U.S. officials. A similar
petition is currently being
circulated by Israeli academ
ics.

Graduate housing
The issue of on-campus hous
ing for graduate students has
been raised frequently in recent
weeks on the campus. The dis
cussion has been characterized
in letters to the Daily as a "con
troversy," and it has been sug
gested that improved com
munication among graduates,
undergraduates, the Dean of
Student Affairs and the Director
of Residential Education may
be the appropriate first step in
diminishing the controversy. I
am suggesting here an earlier
first step: that the advocates of
graduate housing become in
formed about the activities and
planning that the University ad
ministration has already under
taken in the area of housing
On September 1, 1980, I as
sumed the newly-created posi
tion of Director of Stanford
Housing Programs. My princi
pal charge, assigned by Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and Vice
President of Business and Fi
nance Bill Massy, is to draft a
Comprehensive Housing Plan
for faculty, staff and students.
That plan will include recom
mendations both for improved
use of existing housing stock and

for construction of new housing.
It is clear that those recommen
dations will include the con
struction of housing units ap
propriate for the unique aca
demic. personal and financial
needs of graduate students.
Whether or not a coalition is
formed on behalf of graduate
housing. I would like to extend
to the potential members of
such a coalition my availability
to their comments and sugges
tions and to inform them of my
enthusiasm for their cause. I
hope we can work together
toward a solution that responds
to graduate housing values as
well as the University's aca
demic. economic and land use
policies.

KZSU operation
As a staff member of KZSU. I
was very interested to read
Dean Lyons' comments about
the station (Daily, Jan. 26).
KZSU is Stanford's radio sta
tion, run by students, and sup
ported by student funds. The
station also works to serve the
community as a whole.
The recent shutdown over
Christmas break (except for the
broadcast of a Palo Alto City
Council meeting to comply with
a contract) was due to a lack of
student personnel to staff the
station, rather than to any ir
responsibility on the part of the
management. Why should
KZSU be expected to operate
over a vacation when there are
few if any students in the area to
either staff the station or enjoy
its programming?
It is interesting to note that

other campus media are not ex
pected to continue operations
over vacations. For example,
during the final two weeks of the
quarter, the Daily publishes
only one issue, while KZSU staf
fers keep the station running
with only minor changes in the
normal schedule.
In the future, I hope that
members of the Stanford com
munity will pause to listen to
KZSU and find out what is really
happening. I expect when they
consider the elements involved
in the operation of a radio sta
tion, they will be impressed
with KZSU.

'Double standard'
Two questions to you and oth
ers who support the editorial
"End Aid to El Salvador" (Dai
ly, Feb 6):
If sending aid to El Salvador
is a violation of its sovereignty
is the aid we are giving the lef
tist regime of Nicaragua also a
violation of its sovereignty? I
have never read any protest by
those who endorse your position
against aid to any "left" dic
tatorship.
If the U.S. discontinues all aid
to El Salvador, and Cuba and the
Soviet Union continue their mil
itary aid to the rebels who seek
to establish their own ruthless
dictatorship, what should our
policy be?
I believe I speak for many
who are puzzled by your double
standard.
