## Administration changes economic forecast 
### 
Washington (API — The Rea
gan administration, retreating
from an early, rosier predic
tion, is forecasting inflation of
slightly more than 8 percent in
1982 and little change in un
employment over the next two
years as its economic recovery
program takes hold, sources
say.
Several sources, who asked
not to be identified, also said
Wednesday the president's eco
nomic forecast would concede
the possibility of a "technical
recession" this year — a slight
dip in economic growth for at
least two consecutive quarters.
!n sharp contrast to an earlier
prediction, the administration
will forecast economic growth
in 1982 of only 1 percent to 2 per
cent, sources said.
Also, although work on three
departments' spending plans is
behind him, President Ronald
Reagan still faces his toughest
decisions on how to trim $50
billion from next year's federal
budget and has yet to choose a
target date for the 30 percent,
three-year tax cut he will pro
pose.
"You save the hard ones for
last," said White House press
secretary James Brady.
Brady said Reagan had made
final decisions on the budgets of

the departments of Interior, Ag
riculture and Health and Hu
man Services during meetings
with secretaries of those de
partments Wednesday.
Yesterday's schedule in
cluded Labor Secretary Ray
mond Donovan, Commerce Sec
retary Malcolm Baldrige and
the heads of independent agen
cies.
The series of meetings, which
continues today, is giving Rea
gan "a chance to cross-ex
amine" the Cabinet members
about their budget requests,
Brady said.
Asked whether a decision had
been made on an effective date
for the tax cut, which would low
er income taxes across the
board by 10 percent a year for
each of three years, Brady said,
"It hasn't."
He said that decision would be
made before next Wednesday,
when the president will address
a joint session of Congress and
release details of the spending
and tax cut proposals that aides
have said will be sweeping. The
president will also announce the
administration's economic pre
dictions to the joint session.
David Stockman, director of
the Office of Management and
Budget, has said Reagan would
try to lop $50 billion off the $739.3

billion budget proposed by the
Carter administration for the
1982 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1
The president, according to
his aides, plans to finish his
budget meetings and make his
final decisions at his Camp
David. Md., retreat over the
three-day Washington's Birth
day holiday.

Sources said the inflation
forecast breaks down this way:
about 11 percent in 1981, com
pared with 12.4 percent last
year; about 8.25 percent in 1982;
6.25 percent in 1983 and 5.5 per
cent in 1984.
Those figures contrast with
the earlier report that foresaw
about 6.5 percent inflation next

year, about 4.5 percent in 1983
and 3 percent in 1984
One source said the adminis
tration expects a slight increase
in unemployment this year and
a small drop in 1982, leaving the
jobless rate at the end of 1982
about the same as last month's
7 4 percent rate.
