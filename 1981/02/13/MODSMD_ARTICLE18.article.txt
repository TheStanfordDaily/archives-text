## 
### Associated Press 
Winter's worst storm was blamed for the crash
of a corporate jet in Westchester County, N.Y.,
that killed seven people, as deadly winds howled
across the nation and freezing rains turned snow
covered areas into giant ice slicks yesterday. The
storm's death toll climbed to 43.
Tornados churned through the South with winds
strong enough to lift a 59-year-old North Carolina
man from his mobile home, toss him 35 feet
through the air head-over-heels and hang him in a
Chinaberry tree by his feet. He was not seriously
hurt.
Five people froze to death in lowa, Oklahoma,
Colorado and Idaho. Tornadoes ravaged theCaro
linas and Texas, leaving at least five dead. Traffic
fatalities and weather-related heart attacks
claimed lives in several other states.
Thunderstorms charged out of the Great Lakes
on Wednesday after slinging more snow on the
frozen Midwest.
Heavy rains pounded New England, Florida
and North Carolina.

The mercury see-sawed as a burst of tropical
air broke heat records for the day in some areas
only to be followed by biting cold.
In White Plains, N.Y., a Lockheed jetstar
crashed and burned during foggy weather
Wednesday night near the Westchester County
Airport. Authorities blamed the crash on the poor
weather and low visibility. The jet belonged Tex
asgulf Inc. of Stamford, Conn. Seven people were
killed.
Wisconsin reported a dozen weather-related
deaths — most of them elderly people who col
lapsed while shoveling snow, scraping wind
shields and, in one case, wading through drifts to a
bird feeder.
Winds were clocked at 82 mph in the Adiron
dack mountains of New York state.
Temperatures throughout Illinois hovered
around zero or below all day Wednesday as the
state dug out from a storm that dumped up to a
foot of snow in the Chicago metropolitan area and
about 6 inches elsewhere.
