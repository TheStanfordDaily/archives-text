# Freed from Iranian prison
## Dwyer comes home 
### 
Amherst, N.Y. (AP) â€”
Cynthia Dwyer. returning
from nine months' imprison
ment in Iran to the bitter
wind and new-fallen snow of
her upstate New York home
town, said, "It was nice and
warm in Tehran, but it's a lot
warmer here, if you know
what I mean "
Feeling "great"' after her
release from Tehran's Evin
Prison, she arrived here late
Wednesday to the hugs of
friends and relatives she
hadn't seen since leaving for
Iran last spring
A "Welcome Home Cyn
thia" banner was strung out
side her home, and inside
about 20 friends and relatives
waited with gifts and two
cakes, one decorated with
daffodils and "Welcome
Home Cynthia, We Love
You."
The 49-year-old mother of
three went to Iran to write
about the American
hostages, but was arrested
last May, 10 days after the
failed hostage rescue mis
sion.
Tried and convicted last
weekend on espionage
charges, she was ordered de
ported and left Tehran on
Tuesday, flying home via
Dubai in the United Arab
Emirates. Switzerland and
New York.
Reunited with family
She was reunited in New
York on Wednesday with her
husband. John, and their

children, Ben. 14, Dan, 12,
and Susannah, 9. whom she
gave a scarf that she knitted
in prison as a "souvenir of
Evin."
Aboard the plane to Buf
falo, N.Y., she toasted her
newly regained freedom and
explained how she'd passed
her time.
She was unable to talk with
most of the other women
prisoners at the prison be
cause most spoke only Farsi,
she said.
And one lesson she learned
from her ordeal was: "Don't
ever go to another country
without knowing the lan
guage."
Iran's scapegoat
At an airport news con
ference before the flight to
Buffalo, Ms. Dwyer said she
felt her arrest was due to
Iran's need for a scapegoat
after the failed mission to
rescue the American
hostages April 25.
Ms. Dwyer said she was
kept alone from the time of
her arrest until July 20 when
she was transferred to Evin
Prison, which she called an
"obvious political prison."
Ms. Dwyer s experience
changed her previously sym
pathetic feelings toward the
Iranian revolution "because
they put me in a position to
see the worst aspect ... (of
what) they are doing," she
said.
