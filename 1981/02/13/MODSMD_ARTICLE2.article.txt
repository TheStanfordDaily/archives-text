# University, graduate students clash over rent hikes
## 
### Jan Mireles 
University administrators are de
fending the housing system that grad
uate students claim is "indifferent" to
the financial strain created by recent
rent hikes in Escondido Village.
"They aren't being singled out. It's
not just Escondido rents, but all cam
pus housing. They're all going up 15
percent next year." said Ed Scoles, di
rector of housing and food services.
Last year rent rates in Escondido
Village were increased by 14 percent.
That figure is expected to rise to 15
percent in 1981, and another 15 percent
in 1982. Village residents are upset
with the planned rent hikes because
they feel current rents more than cov
er costs of maintaining the units. They
believe they shouldn't be "respon
sible" for costs in undergraduate
housing because of their own wide

spread tight financial circumstances.
"Escondido Village used to be sepa
rate from other University housing —
then our rents covered costs. Now
graduate students are taking out extra
loans to cover additional housing
costs," said Lisa Schneider, a gradu
ate student in comparative literature.
Scoles refuted graduate students
arguments against shared responsi
bility.
"If you're going to claim that rents
more than cover costs, or that build
ings have been paid off, thus you
shouldn't have to pay rent, well, that's
also true of some dorms," said Scoles.
"We long ago abandoned the principle
of setting rates according to loca
tion," he explained.
Laura Ziock, an Escondido Village
renter and member of a resident
group examining the rent hikes,

voiced displeasure with the current
rent outlook.
"Graduate students should not be
responsible for undergraduate hous
ing. (President Donald) Kennedy has
implied that he wants to raise rents to
market level; yet undergraduates pay
less in increases than graduates and
there are no plans for graduate hous
ing,'' said Ziock.
Scoles says there are no definite
plans for more graduate student hous
ing. but "it's probable that the next in
crement of housing will be for gradu
ates. I can't make a commitment be
cause I don't know about future bond
rates."
Schneider also fears a rent raise to
the market level.
"If people are driven off campus in
search of cheaper housing, there will
be a greater demand and the market

price will go up still more," said
Schneider,
Escondido Village residents also
question the University's reluctance
to use money from building funds or
unrestricted gifts instead of im
plementing rent raises to maintain
campus residences.
According to Schneider, last year
two percent of Escondido profits went
to pay off general housing debts.
"The rent profits from Escondido
get soaked up paying for losses in oth
er housing," said Ziock.
Jan Marx, director of Escondido
Village, says she does not see any way
around the rent hikes.
"If you look at the whole system,
there's not much leeway. It's basical
ly a result of the cost the University in
curs. Housing costs are self-con
tained," said Marx. "It produces in

come, but also spends money. There is
no other place for the money to come
from." she said.
Marx admits to graduate student
claims that rent surpluses are being
required as part of the "push" to up
date dorms before work on the new
housing project is completed.
"There is a push to get under
graduate housing into shape; there
will be a surplus next year that will
most likely go toward updating stu
dent housing." said Marx.
Scoles also said that the University
is trying to raise the safety standards
of the older dorms, but added that it
would be an ongoing project.
"Someone paying room rent in 1985.
will be helping to pay for the next new
housing project." said Scoles.
Marx and Scoles both said they are
