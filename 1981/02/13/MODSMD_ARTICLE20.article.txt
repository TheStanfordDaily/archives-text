Results from a survey conducted this summer in
dicate that 1981 freshmen are more conservative, ca
reer-oriented and ambitious than ever. Respondents to
the questionnaire totaled 1289 of the 1500-member
class, an increase of 299 over the 1978 survey.
The study has been conducted annually since 1977 by
both the American Council on Education and UCLA.
Signs of increased conservatism appeared in many of
the responses In comparison to the 1978 survey, stu
dents agreeing to more liberalized divorce laws shifted
from 47 7 percent to 42 percent and those favoring the
legalization of marijuana decreased from 53 percent to
40.7 percent
Advocation of laws prohibiting homosexual rela
tionships increased from 15.1 percent to 19.0 percent
and of legalized abortions dropped from 75.7 percent to
73 percent. •Actions of married women are best con
fined to home and family." according to 16.4 percent of
the men and 4 9 percent of the women With regard to
living together before marriage. 48.8 percent of the stu
dents cited the act as advantageous, a decrease from
52.5 percent in 1978 Women should be subject to the
draft agreed 74.5 percent and 98.6 percent agreed that
women should receive job equality.
Interest in engineering has doubled over the past four
years (from 8 to 16 percent), while the proportion plan
ning to attain law degrees has declined (from 13 to 9
percent). Responses to a question regarding careers
versus general education were as follows:
While I'm at Stanford, preparing myself for a career
will be at least as important to me as acquiring a gener
al education;

degree (33.2 percent), a Ph.D. or Ed.D. (23.6 percent),
a M.D., D O , D.D.S., D.V.M. (23.1 percent) or a law
degree (12.3 percent). Little difference was reported
between men and women in these various responses.
Over nine out of 10 incoming freshmen expect to be
satisfied with Stanford and four out of five expect to
find jobs in their preferred field. The overwhelming
reason for choosing Stanford over other schools ap
peared to be its good academic reputation (93 percent).
Other reasons cited were financial aid (26 percent) and
special education programs (21 percent).
