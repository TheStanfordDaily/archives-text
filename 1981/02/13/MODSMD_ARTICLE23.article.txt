Jaruzelski asks strike moratorium
Warsaw, Poland — Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Poland's
new premier, appealed to workers yesterday for "90
peaceful days," warning that continued unrest could pitch
Poland into civil war. He also reshuffled the government's
top echelon and announced a 10-point program to tackle
the economic emergency.
Jaruzelski, who replaced Jozef Pinkowski as premier
Wednesday and retains his post as defense minister, said
in a televised speech that Poland is in the grip of destruc
tive chaos that could lead to "conflict and . the most ter
rible thing, a fratricidal wars."
The four-star, Soviet-trained general said in a speech to
Parliament, "I am calling on all trade unions with an ap
peal. Let us stop all strikes. I am asking you for three
months of honest work, 90 days of calm, to put some order
in our economy."
The first reaction from the independent trade union Soli
darity to Jaruzelski's appeal was one of qualified wel
come. Meeting in the Baltic port of Gdansk, Solidarity
leaders overwhelmingly adopted a resolution banning
strikes not approved beforehand by the union's national
coordination committee.
The Solidarity leaders made an important exception to
the ban: no approval is needed in cases involving a direct
attack by the authorities on a union branch or the union's
members or collaborators.
Asked about Jaruzelski's proposal for a three-month
moratorium on strikes, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said
he was in favor of the idea in principle, but that the govern
ment must outline its position more fully.
> "They would have to give us something in return." he
said.
Russians withdraw border troops
Moscow — Soviet military reservists who were called to
duty in the Carpathian region bordering Poland when the
Polish crisis erupted last August have been returned to ci
vilian status subject to quick reactivation, reliable
sources said yesterday.
The accounts reaching here, believed credible by in
formed western sources, assert that the stand-down of re
servists in the region began in mid-December and that
almost all are now back at their normal civilian jobs.
The sources say, however, that factories and other
places of work in the strategic military district in the
western Ukraine have received special instructions to
keep the reserves near at hand in case they are to be called

up again.
The sources say the August call-up was marked by ex
traordinary confusion, disorder, and wholesale desertions
by reservists from mustering points and bivouacs The
sources assert that the initial activation was so unsuc
cessful that it has led to the dismissal of senior staff re
servists responsible for reserve readiness in the
Carpathian region.
The Soviet sources said discipline among the reserves,
who were said to have been told only that they were being
called for "retraining." was a major problem from the be
ginning. These sources alleged that the reservists, with
families and friends nearby, melted away from their
duties in numbers so large that punishment became im
possible.
Air controllers threaten strike
Washington — Negotiations opened here yesterday be
tween the Federal Aviation Administration and the na
tion's air traffic controllers, who have threatened a na
tionwide strike March 15 unless their demands are met for
higher wages, fewer working hours, and earlier retire
ment.
As teams of lawyers and labor relations specialists
began their closed sessions, neither side would predict the
outcome. FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said only that "we
expect it to be a long drawn-out process."
In recent years, as computer failures at air traffic con
trol centers and reports of near-misses by aircraft have in
creased. tension has mounted between the air traffic con
trollers and the FAA. their employer.
The union charges that the equipment the controllers
use is inefficient and inadequate for today's crowded
skies, and that they need better systems and training. The
union also has demanded improved benefits to compensate
the controllers for the stress and other occupational haz
ards of their job.
The aviation agency, on the other hand, has defended its
computer capability, and has charged that complacency
on the part of controllers is part of the problem.
Former FAA Administrator Langhorne Bond warned
the controllers that the agency would crack down on em
ployees who show complacency in their jobs, positions
that he once described as "not much different than a bus
driver's."
That statement angered the controllers, who say that
their responsibilities for guiding aircraft across the coun
try and directing takeoffs and landings make them com
parable to pilots.
