# Scientists warned of gimmickry in genetics

Scientists involved in genetic engi
neering must resist the "secrecy and
gimmickry" imposed by emerging
biotechnology companies, according
to University Nobel Laureate Dr.
Arthur Kornberg.
In a speech at the dedication of the
David L. Lawrence Convention Center
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Kornberg called for better com
munication between academia and in
dustry for their mutual benefit.
"The explosive developments in ge
netic engineering have generated con
frontations between academia and in
dustry. Unlike the post war elec
tronics revolution which originated
mostly in industry, the earliest in
dustrial applications of genetic
chemistry and immunobiology have
come exclusively from academic lab
oratories," he said.
"Understandably, the scientists
that provided the ideas, techniques,
and practitioners of genetic chemistry
are reluctant to be excluded from its
financial rewards by entrepreneurs
and venture capitalists."
More willingness on the part of com
panies dealing with university scien
tists to communicate in a free and
open academic manner would help
these companies attract the best sci
entists and insure the success of their
efforts. Kornberg said.
He warned of dangers if industry
chooses to hire its own scientists and
then keeps them isolated from free ex
change of new knowledge.
At the same time, there are obvious
problems if universities as nonprofit
organizations become en
trepreneurial and employ their facul
ties for both academic and com

mercial performance, he said.
The solution, according to
Kornberg, cannot come from summit
meetings, government agents or law
yers. Instead the scientists must set
their own standards.
"I am hopeful that scientists who
have been and will remain the major
resources of these commercial efforts
will have the character and wisdom to
preserve academic standards and
combat pressures for secrecy and
gimmickry."
Despite the problems, however, the
commercial success of molecular and
cellular biology has done two positive
things. "It has created many attrac
tive jobs in an area where op
portunities had become scarce and
has also secured a respectability for
biological science among our fellow
citizens . . . that dominance of the
Nobel Prize awards never could
achieve."
Scientists must always remember
that technology (the application of
knowledge) is based on a foundation of
science (the acquisition of basic
knowledge), he said. This scientific
base is often obscured by highly publi
cized advances in technology which
make it seem that the marketed prod
uct is more important than the knowl
edge that fathered it, according to
Kornberg.
"I believe the responsibility of the
scientist is to do the most creative and
dedicated research within his or her
power, and to report the results hon
estly. promptly and unstintingly," he
said. "It is not the responsibility of the
scientist to choose research of clear
social or economic value, nor to affect
the transfer of research findings to
technology."
