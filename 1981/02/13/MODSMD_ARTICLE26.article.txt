## Netters smash San Francisco 
### Ivan Maisel 
It all seems so easy. The USF Dons are better than most
NCAA Division I schools, but the day they beat Stanford is
the day mop-haired Jim Gurfein goes bald Even the 8-1
score by which the Cards triumphed under hazy skies yes
terday at Stanford Stadium shows what a breeze it is for
the defending national champs.
If you believe that, you won't get the time of day from
guys like John Corse, who struggled for more than two
hours before subduing Mike Yee 3-S, 6-2, 6-4.
Nor from Tim Mayotte, who overcame a balky first
serve and a shaky lob to beat Eddie Barretto 6-3, 6-4,
before teaming up with Scott Bondurant to lose 7-6. 6-4 to
Barretto and Mike Howard in No. 1 doubles.
There are three reasons why Stanford's win was not as
easy as it sounds. Though tennis players never are really in
an "off-season", the Cards will be the first to admit they
are not psychologically ready for dual matches.
Secondly, notice the names in the box score. Corse.
Andy Chase and Greg Hing do not normally start for Stan
ford. Playing teams such as USF gives them match ex
perience, but it also gives them the chance to show coach
Dick Gould how well they can play.
Last of all there is the king-of-the-hill syndrome. The lit
tle-schools-that-could often can. It's a chance for momen
tary glory, as Foothill received a few years back when
they beat Stanford.
So the thrill of yesterday's victory sounded more like a
sigh of relief.
One of the Cards who had the easiest time in singles was
Bondurant, who destroyed Howard in No. 3 singles, 6-3,
6-1 Mostly what Bondurant did was hit the ball over the
net and let Howard make one of many unforced errors.
Nevertheless, the junior realized how careful he had to
be against the Dons. "These are not the important
matches. The te, m has a tough time getting up There's
very little incent /e.
"We can only 1 se," Bondurant added. "If we win — big

deal. If we lose, it's a really big loss."
It was also easy for No 5 Andy Chase, who overcame
first-set jitters to rout Peter Westner 6-4. 6-1 Chase said
showing himself he could win was as important as showing
Gould
"It's good to play someone different than on the (Stan
ford) team. You think you hit it well in practice, but you're
not really sure. There's also pressure even on the lower
guys. Everyone's expected to win."
That must be a good feeling for the Rhode Island native
Chase has played very little in the past three years. Get
ting a chance to play is one thing Being expected to win.
even against USF, must be a welcome burden. Unless, of
course, the pressure of showing the coach you can play is
too much.
"To that extent they are real nervous." Bondurant said
of the teammates ranked below him. "From their past
records they are much better It's not from a lack of want
ing to win," he said of the jitters. "It's from the lack of
match play."
Chase said he shies away from thinking of impressing
Gould. "Sometimes I have in the past to an extent. I don't
go out thinking I have to win big. You can't go out saying
you gotta win or it will backfire.
"Every win tends to build on the last one, " Chase said of
his second victory in as many starts. "It gives me a little
confidence, particularly to someone who doesn't always
play."
A smiling Hing, who hobbled on a heavily bandaged leg
to a 7-5, 6-4 victory in No. 6 singles over Greg Davis, put it
very simply. "I don't get to play that often. You've got to
do it while you can."
