## To play-off or not to play-off PRO 
### Steve Odell 
New Year's Day. What a day it
is. Filled with celebrations, family
get-togethers, and most of all —
college football Bowl games.
However, the Bowl Games —
while Lord knows I love them - do
not accomplish a main purpose; to
determine the number one col
legiate football team in the nation.
Let's face it, college football, the
major business that it is. is the only
sport in its class that does not have
a play-off system to determine who
is number one. And while I'm not in
favor of doing away with either the
Bowls or the Polls, it is ridiculous
that we do not have a fair and
equitable system to determine the
top team in the land.
Instead of doing away with
either the Bowls or the Polls, how
ever. we should rather incorporate
them into a national college foot
ball playoff system
My proposal would have the top
20 teams involved. Numbers one
through 12 (as determined by The
Polls) would have a first round bye,
and the teams ranking 13 through 20
would play each other to determine
the other four teams to make it into
the play-offs. This woqld still make
use of the rankings, but it would not
allow them to decide numern un<>
on paper. The best team would
have to prove it was the best team
where it counts — out on the field.
Becoming number one should not
be an easy chore. How it stands
now, a team can slip through on a
relatively easy schedule, go un
defeated against basically subpar
teams, and end up on top. Georgia
is a good example. Now while the
Dogs are a fine team and had a good
year, I question if there are few, if
any, who would not doubt their
claim as the best team in the na
tion. (Unless of course, you live in
Atlanta, or are related to Herschel
Walker.)
Now, the regular season ends
about the third weekend in Novem
ber. which would allow plenty of
time to incorporate my proposal.
Give the teams a few weeks off,
and start these "wild card" games

the first Saturday in December
That would reduce the field to 16
teams, and they would play in eight
assorted Bowls across the land the
next weekend. The winners of these
games would play each other and
then there would be four teams left
to attempt to lay claim to the
spoils.
The four biggest Bowl games —
the Orange, the Cotton, the Sugar,
and the Rose — would alternate on
these last four games every year,
meaning that the game to decide
the championship would be played
in one of the big four quadrennially.
The system would eliminate hav
ing Michigan and USC playing in
the Rose Bowl every year, and
would mean that fans across the
nation would get a chance to see a
variety of good teams from across
the country.
Another problem with the pres
ent set-up is that there rarely is a
clear-cut match up of the top
challengers. A play-off system
would alter that, and bring a total
of 20 exciting Bowl games, enough
for even the heartiest fan. to the
public (and the TV networks ).
The best thing about my play-off
proposal though, is that it would
keep the Bowls. They are a great
piece of Americana which should
live forever. It would, however,
take advantage of their potential
and give the college game the kind
of prestigious play-off system it so
richly deserves.
There would still be the parades
and the half-time shows — but
without the uncertainty that cur
rently hovers over the annual cry of
"We're Number One."
