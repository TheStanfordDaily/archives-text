What would we do over Christ
mas vacation without Bowl
games? Probably eat a lot less than
we usually do, drink a lot more than
we should, and generally be bored
bv the college play-off games.
Who can forget those afternoons
and evenings in front of the tele
vision, chewing on leftover turkey
and mashed potatoes, rooting for
teams we've grown up with? And
then, after the game, going out and

playing football in the snow.
Tho fact is. college football has
always been different from the
pros, in organization, and more im
portantly. in spirit. Why is it the
pro playoffs have never been quite
as exciting?
A playoff system in college foot
ball. regardless of what kind,
would cast a more business-like at
mosphere over those autumn after
noons. Don't we have enough of
that already?
I don't particularly care whether
USC or Alabama is No. 1 But Ido
enjoy watching Bear Bryant and
John Robinson fight about it in the
papers And I particularly enjoy
arguing about it over a drink in a
bar with friends Let's face it.the
ambiguity is part of the fun.
Some might argue that the
smaller Bowl games are boring and
inconsequential. Not if you like to
bet.
Some might argue that these
smaller games cloud the issue, i.e.,
who's the No. 1 team in the nation.
On the contrary. I think they pro
vide fans with an overview of the
nation's collegiate teams and tal
ent, while providing smaller
schools with the chance to capture
a little national attention.
The fact is. a school like Stanford
has a vested interest in these Bowl
games. Lest we forget, the Blue
bonnet Bowl is where the unranked
1979 Cardinals got the chance to
beat nationally ranked Georgia.
The Cardinals have always been
among the flakiest, but also the
best, teams in the nation. The prob
lem is that nobody knows it but us,
unless they find their way to a Lib
erty, Gator, or even Garden State
Bowl
College football may be a busi
ness. but I maintain that we should
at least take a stab at preserving
the pretense that it is not, if only for
the fun of it. Play-offs would turn a
bunch of nice young guys into pro
fessional athletes, calculating
their bonus check totals before
they had even signed the contract.
Who wants to settle down in a fa
vorite chair with turkey and
potatoes, turn on the television,
and watch a bunch of junior ex
ecutives thrash around?
