# Frosh Hathhorn stars off bench
## Stanford steals a victory from Vandals 
### Bill Beyda 
The Stanford Cardinals women's
basketball team strung up the Univer
sity of Idaho Vandals 71-68 at Moscow,
Idaho, Wednesday night. The game
was close until the final minute when
Ann Miller drove one-on-one and sunk
the go-ahead basket.
"They were a very scrappy team,"
Stanford assistant coach Mike Kehoe
said of Idaho, "but we put together a

great team effort." One of the game's
stars, according to Kehoe, was
freshman Siobhan Hathhorn, who
came off the bench to score twelve
points and play "an excellent de
fensive game." Other Card stars were
Louise Smith, who led Stanford with 20
points and 10 rebounds; Kim Kup
ferer, who had 15 points and 15 re
bounds; and Ann Miller, who chipped
in with 11 points and 8 rebounds.

"Denise McGuire did a great job
coming off the bench and running the
show when Debbie Gore got into foul
trouble," Kehoe added.
The Cards will face the University
of Oregon and Oregon State on the
road this weekend. The Ducks are cur
rently ranked 16th nationwide, but
head coach Dotty McCrea is confident
about her team's chances, "If we can
hold the ball, and slow down the tempo

of the game, we can beat them. We're
not going to attempt to run with
them."
The Cards' overall record going into
the two Oregon games is 13-12. Idaho is
not in Stanford's conference, so the
win did not affect their NorCal Con
ference record, which remains at 3-5.
The Cards will play at Berkeley next
Tuesday night, and will return to
Maples Pavilion to face USF
