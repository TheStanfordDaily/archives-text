# Pass/no credit policy may change
## 
### Alexi Assmus 
Due to repeated instances in which University policy
has been disregarded, the faculty is reviewing the pro
cedures for implementing the pass/no credit option.
According to Ombudsman John Goheen, "there has
been a lot of deviation" from the University's guidelines.
The Committee on Academic Appraisal and Achiev
ment (CAAA), headed by Mathematics Prof. Mary Sun
seri, is preparing an Interim Report for the Faculty Senate
examining the problems of the pass/no credit system and
recommending possible changes. The report will be given
to the Faculty Senate at its next meeting.
Two changes being considered are the establishment of
an earlier deadline for students to exercise this option and
requiring students to declare a course to be taken pass/no
credit to the registrar.
University policy as it now stands requires that a stu
dent notify the instructor of the intent to take the course
pass/fail by the day add/drop slips are due or earlier, de
pending on the individual instructor'spreference.
There is no formal procedure that holds students and in
structors to this, however. Therefore it is left to the in
structor's discretion as to when a student must declare the
intent to take the course pass/fail
The main problem is that students often ask to exercise
the option after the deadline. Apparently this deadline has
not been stringently enforced. Professor Paul David,
chairman of the Economics Department, issued a memo
randum last quarter to his faculty stressing the need to
comply with University regulations regarding pass/fail.

"As this has not invariably been the prior practice in ec
onomics courses it is necessary to announce it now in all
undergraduate classes." said the memorandum.
Professor Richard Muth. Undergraduate Secretary of
the Economics Department was not aware of any prob
lems within his department, however. "Nothing has been
officially brought to my attention in my capacity as under
graduate secretary," he said He is, however, "reasonably
certain that there have been cases where University regu
lations have been violated."
The option to take a course pass/no credit has been
available at Stanford since the 1960s when students were
only allowed to take 27 units of course work without receiv
ing a letter grade. When the option was first offered the
student was responsible for formally declaring to the reg
istrar's office the intent to take a course pass no credit.
The University decided in 1970 that students would not
be restricted as to the amount of units they could take
pass no credit. By then, the requirement that students re
port their decision to take a course pass no credit to the
registrar had been dropped due to administrative prob
lems in handling the amount of work.
Sally Mahoney, the registrar, said because "the trans
action now falls within the rules honored by students and
instructors." there is no way for the University to enforce
the deadline.
In 1975 the CAAA, recognizing this problem, recom
mended that the registrar's office once again be given the
responsibility for formally recording a student's decision
to take a course pass/no credit. They hoped to eliminate
the possibility of a student deciding to take the pass/fail
option just before the final exam, or after handing in a dis
astrous paper. Also, according to the registrar, under this
system instructor's could no longer be pressured by stu
dents at the last minute.
However, the registrar's office was not able to admin
ister this system which would have forced students to file
cards similar to the add/drop cards.
The CAAA is again considering this possibility and ac
cording to Sally Mahoney, "it is (the registrar's office)
goal to achieve the objective set by the faculty."
