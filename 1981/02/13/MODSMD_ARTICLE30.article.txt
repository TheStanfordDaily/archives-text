# On the road to Washington
## Cards go north to face Huskies, Cougars 
### Chris Haft 
After unsuccessfully battling the Galahads and
Lancelots of the Pacific-10 Conference, Stanford's
men's basketball team gets a chance to mix it up
with the Joes and Hanks of the league tomorrow eve
ning at Washington and then Monday night at Wash
ington State.
Two weekends ago, the Cardinals had to face na
tionally No. 5-ranked Arizona State. Last Saturday,
they played Oregon State, then ranked No. 1 by UPI.
This weekend, however, the seventh-place Cards
meet opponents closer to their own level.
Washington, 4-7 in the Pac-10 and 10-10 overall,
stands in sixth place, just ahead of Stanford in the
conference's pecking order. Last month the Huskies
defeated the Cards in Maples Pavilion, 65-58. "That
was one of those games we let slip away," Stanford
head coach Dick Dißiaso commented.
Slipping away on offense is something Washing
ton does effectively. Dißiaso said Stanford must
prevent the Huskies from beginning thoir offense
before the Card defense sets up
" We have to stop their quick scorers. They get the

ball upcourt very quickly," Dißiaso said
A significant Husky threat is 6-foot-7 forward An
dra Griffin, whom Dißiaso likens to former Card
great Kimberly Belton in that he "hangs around the
hoop." Griffin's loitering near the basket has given
him a scoring average of 18.7 points per game. The
Cards will also be conscious of 6-foot-4 guard Bob
Fronk (16.1), who burned them for 25 points in the
earlier Maples meeting
Lacking a 6-foot-10 or 7-foot behemoth and
possessing adequate but not overwhelming speed,
Washington relies on its shooting for its success.
"They can shoot themselves out of the game or shoot
themselves in the game," Dißiaso affirmed
Washington State, meanwhile, has had trouble
staying in most of its games this season Feeling the
effects of losing all five starters from last year's 22-6
team, the Cougars have fallen to last place in the
conference with a 2-9 record, though they trail the
seventh-place trio of Stanford, California and Ore
gon (3-8) by only one game.
Comparing the Cougars to Stanford, Dißiaso said.
"Our styles of play are similar, except they have
quickness and we don't."

Despite this difference, the Cards outlasted WSU
62-60 here last month. "We were fortunate in that we
got an early lead and controlled the game, taking
away the stuff WSU likes to do," Dißiaso recalled.
What WSU likes to do is run the fast break — and
make mistakes. In their loss at Maples, the Cougars
often displayed disorganization on defense and
hastiness on offense, causing head coach George
Raveling to scream in exasperation at one point.
"Show some patience, will you 9 "
Notes: Monday night's game against WSU will be
televised locally on Ch. 36 starting at 8
p.m. . .Despite scoring 10 and 11 points off the bench
against Oregon and Oregon State respectively last
weekend, guard Doug Marty will remain a sub
stitute. This is not to say that his efforts have gone
disregarded, however. "He really provides a
boost," Dißiaso said. "No team wins with five
guys". . With seven triumphs in 20 games, the
Cards have already tied their victory total of last
year, when they finished 7-19. . WSU has not lost to
Stanford at home since 1975. Last year the Cougars
annihilated the Cards at Friel Court, 102-74
