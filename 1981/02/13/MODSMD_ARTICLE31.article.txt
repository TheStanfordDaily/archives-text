## Freshmen the key to season 
### John Kosner 
"The best thing about freshmen,"
said former Marquette coach A 1
McGuire, "is that they become
sophomores." Not so at Stanford.

Commentary

For coach Dick Dißiaso and his
schizophrenic Cardinals (how else do
you describe a team that can come
ever so close to electrocuting top
ranked Oregon State on one weekend
and yet can come even closer to re
sembling the basketball equivalent of
refried beans against sweet, gentle St.
Mary's on another?), the best thing
about the squad's frosh quartet — cen

ter John Revelli, forward Hans
Wichary, guard Keith Jones, and sw
ingman Roger Lemons — is that all
four can play. Now.
And play well. Combined, the fab
four of Revelli, Wichary, Jones, and
Lemons have accounted for 33 points,
15 rebounds, and countless facials per
game. With their help, the Cardinals
(7-13 overall, and 3-8 in the Pacific-10
Conference) have equalled last year's
victory total and have six more
chances to prove that their recent im
proved play is no fluke.
Considering that Stanford lost two
of its top returnees — leading re
bounder Orlando Ward (academic
problems) and penetrating guard

Terry Smith (bad back) — before the
Pac-10 schedule had even begun, the
team's record, albeit mediocre, is no
disgrace.
The main reason why Stanford
hasn't fallen on its face in this, the
school's umpteenth "rebuilding'
year, has been the inspired play of
Dißiaso's prize recruits. To gauge
their importance, try and imagine the
Cardinals' fortunes without the
freshman eligibility rule. Imagine op
posing teams quintuple-teaming the
Cards' lone sharpshooter Brian
Welch. Imagine Stanford actually los
ing to Wisconsin-Superior! Imagine
the Stanford band changing the uni-
versity's fight song from "All Right
Now" to "Dust in the Wind "
Then imagine the following
scenarios: It is next Saturday night
Maples Pavilion is packed because the
big, bad UCLA Bruins are in town for a
rematch (the Uclans having trampled
Stanford last month in Los Angeles).
What's in the offing? Another blow
out?
Nope This time, the Card guards —
Jones and Peter Lallas (the pride of
South Eugene. Oregon) — break the
Bruins' vaunted press. This time.
Revelli and Wichary gang up to put a
hurt on the swizzlestick-shaped Bruin
big men. With Welch dropping in
jumpers from Menlo Park and
Lemons, Doug Marty, and Jeff Ryan
coming off the bench to rally the
troops, Stanford wallops the UCLA
whippets. It could happen. With con
siderable help from God and the refer
ees.
All jokes and dreams aside, Stan
ford has made legitimate progress
this winter. After five straight losing

seasons, Dißiaso finally has the per
sonnel to turn things around:
• In Revelli — who has shot 56% and
averaged 17 points per game in his last
12 outings — Dißiaso has the big guy
necessary for survival in the titan
filled Pac-10. "John has really im
proved," remarked Dißiaso. "He has
learned to pace himself and he has
much more confidence in his shot. In
deed. Revelli looked very confident
last weekend as he worked over the
Oregon Ducks for 23 points and eight
rebounds on Friday night (Stanford
won 80-79 >
• In Wicharv, Dißiaso has the big
shooting forward he needs to take the
heat off Revelli underneath and Welch
in the corners. While he has not de
veloped as quickly as Revelli, he has
shown some signs of steady improve
ment. Wichary has become increas
ingly physical — especially last week
when he hit up the Beavers for 16
points (on seven of eight shooting) and
six rebounds
• In Keith Jones. Dißiaso has the
fast point guard that all teams covet.

According to the coach, Jones is the
"pulse" of the club, and as he im
proves, so will the Cards.
While his freshmen have received
most of the ink this season, Dißiaso
has got to be happy with the effort of
his upperclassmen, also. Co-captain
Brian Welch has been a force at times
and he and the coach have apparently
put their differences away (dif
ferences that kept Welch on the bench
agianst Arizona State thirteen days
ago).
With Lallas stabilizing the
backcourt. and Ryan and Marty (a hot
shooter as of late) giving the Cards
some punch off the pine, Dißiaso has
been left with but one dilemma —
where to play the versatile Lemons. A
solution will no doubt surface this
weekend when Stanford journeys to
Washington for a Saturday night game
and to Washington State for a tele
vised encounter on Monday evening.
This story does not necessarily have
a happy ending. Stanford figures to be
a decided underdog in each of its re

maining games (the away pair in
Washington, home contests against
USC and UCLA next week, and road
contests at Arizona and ASU in two
weeks) and the Cards will be hard
pressed to post a double-figure victory
total for the season Despite the nice
job Dißiaso has done in assimilating
not one. but four, freshmen into a most
competitive program, at season's end
he will likely be judged by his "W's"
(wins) — or lack of them.
If the Cards fail to improve upon
last year's abysmal 7-19 mark, the lo
cal loonies will no doubt be out for
Dißiaso's scalp Which is a shame.
Stanford is not Nevada-Las Vegas,
and the assorted athletic/academic
double-standards that exist at other
top-echelon universities like UCLA,
Virginia, and Georgetown, will simply
not play here. The kind of ballplayer
who could turn Stanford's program
around would much rather study NBA
green than study in Green. As it is, the
Cards aren't too shabby anyhow As
UCLA should find out next Saturday
night.
