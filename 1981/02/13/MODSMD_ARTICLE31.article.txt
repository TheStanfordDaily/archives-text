## Freshmen the key to season

"The best thing about freshmen,"
said former Marquette coach A 1
McGuire, "is that they become
sophomores." Not so at Stanford.

Commentary

For coach Dick Dißiaso and his
schizophrenic Cardinals (how else do
you describe a team that can come
ever so close to electrocuting top
ranked Oregon State on one weekend

Cards' lone sharpshooter Brian
Welch. Imagine Stanford actually los
