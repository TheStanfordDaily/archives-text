# Gymnasts to face top ranked teams
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Workouts in Encina Gym and aca
demics in the Quad may be closer to
parity than most people think — as if
the theory of evolution weren't getting
its due recognition in the classroom,
Stanford's gymnasts are conducting
their own experiments on the survival
of the fittest.
Fans will have their chance to see
the healthiest Cards in their next to
last home meet tonight as the men
play host to fourth-ranked UCLA and
ninth-rated California while the wom
en entertain Washington State, both
meets beginning a 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
Sadao Hamada's squad has the
toughest assignment of the evening,
taking on the two top-10 teams without
the services of all-arounder Jim Cam
panelli. The frosh standout strained
ligaments in his right knee last Friday
night against Oregon and will be lost
for the season, according to Hamada.
Acknowledging that both opponents
will be "a lot better than our team,"
the head coach said that raising team

and individual scores would be top
priority.
With the loss of Campanelli and
missing an important returnee, Rich
Rosen, with a slowly-healing wrist in
jury up until last weekend, the post
season hopes for the team look dim.
Individually, however, several Cards
could be seeing spring in Nebraska.
"Bob Daniel could go to the NCAA's
in vaulting, Mike Lee could go in all
around and pommel horse, and maybe
Craig Goldman in rings," Hamada
said at practice yesterday. "Improve
ment in those areas is what I'm espe
cially looking forward to tomorrow."
No matter what the meet's final
outcome is, Stanford will record a
unique first in that the competition
will be nationally televised via ESPN
cable television.
"Schools back east are interested in
how the western teams are doing and
they want to see what kind of judging
we have," Hamada said. Cable cov
erage offers widespread exposure and
some financial benefits for the men's
gymnastic program, but viewers get

the real treat as they will get a look at
some top collegiate talent, including
UCLA's Olympic-caliber performers
Peter Vidmar, Mitch Gaylord, Carlos
Spivey and Mark Caso. Cal's top en
trant will be all-arounder Finn Gjers
tein. the Norwegian national cham
pion.
Stanford's lineup includes Lee, Kirk
Druey, Chris Smith and Brian Nelson
in all-around. The Cards' best chance
at surpassing the awesome ursine ath
letes is in vaulting. Last week against
Portland State, Jeff Chung and Druey,
Smith, Lee and Danile, Inc. rolled up
scores of 9.25, 9.35, 9.50, 9.30 and 9.60.
Other top performances at the meet
included Daniel's 9.15, Goldman's 9.10
and Lee's 9.05 on rings and Lee's 9.30
showing on high bar. .
In the women's portion of the meet,
Jackie Walker's squad seems bent on
Darwinism with a vengeance — the
number of relatively injury-free team
members has dropped from nine to
six. The sextet includes Merilyn Chap
man, Karen Hall, Anne Smith. Julie
Bledsoe, Jeanette Lacoste and Caryn
Lucido, and the big number they hope
to perform is 138 or better according
to Walker
Stanford is hoping to keep all six
gymnasts in tonight's meet, un
fortunately an unprecedented event
this season. Chapman set back-to
back school records in all-around last
weekend and there's "still room for
improvement," Walker said.
"Karen will be going all-around
She's not (really) ready but the com
petition is here," Walker added.

"She's not totally prepared, but even
if she's not 100 percent, she's still help
ing the team a lot.
Stanford scored 136.05 last Saturday
against Oregon State without Hall and
Smith, so hitting the goal of 138 points
shouldn't be all that difficult. But the
squad will need all the high scores it
can muster until the end of the season
to justify going on any trips in late
March or early April. Walker said that
her team will have to score 140 or bet
ter in three or four of the remaining
five meets and regionals to qualify for
nationals.

for the season, according to Hamada.
Acknowledging that both opponents
will be "a lot better than our team,"
the head coach said that raising team

and individual scores would be top
priority.
With the loss of Campanelli and
missing an important returnee, Rich
Rosen, with a slowly-healing wrist in
jury up until last weekend, the post
season hopes for the team look dim.
Individually, however, several Cards
could be seeing spring in Nebraska.
"Bob Daniel could go to the NCAA's
in vaulting, Mike Lee could go in all
around and pommel horse, and maybe
Craig Goldman in rings," Hamada
said at practice yesterday. "Improve
ment in those areas is what I'm espe
cially looking forward to tomorrow."
No matter what the meet's final
outcome is, Stanford will record a
unique first in that the competition
will be nationally televised via ESPN
cable television.
"Schools back east are interested in
how the western teams are doing and
they want to see what kind of judging
we have," Hamada said. Cable cov
erage offers widespread exposure and
some financial benefits for the men's
gymnastic program, but viewers get

the real treat as they will get a look at
some top collegiate talent, including
UCLA's Olympic-caliber performers
Peter Vidmar, Mitch Gaylord, Carlos
Spivey and Mark Caso. Cal's top en
trant will be all-arounder Finn Gjers
tein. the Norwegian national cham
pion.
Stanford's lineup includes Lee, Kirk
Druey, Chris Smith and Brian Nelson
in all-around. The Cards' best chance
at surpassing the awesome ursine ath
letes is in vaulting. Last week against
Portland State, Jeff Chung and Druey,
Smith, Lee and Danile, Inc. rolled up
scores of 9.25, 9.35, 9.50, 9.30 and 9.60.
Other top performances at the meet
included Daniel's 9.15, Goldman's 9.10
and Lee's 9.05 on rings and Lee's 9.30
showing on high bar. .
In the women's portion of the meet,
Jackie Walker's squad seems bent on
Darwinism with a vengeance — the
number of relatively injury-free team
members has dropped from nine to
six. The sextet includes Merilyn Chap
man, Karen Hall, Anne Smith. Julie
Bledsoe, Jeanette Lacoste and Caryn
Lucido, and the big number they hope
to perform is 138 or better according
to Walker
Stanford is hoping to keep all six
gymnasts in tonight's meet, un
fortunately an unprecedented event
this season. Chapman set back-to
back school records in all-around last
weekend and there's "still room for
improvement," Walker said.
"Karen will be going all-around
She's not (really) ready but the com
petition is here," Walker added.

"She's not totally prepared, but even
if she's not 100 percent, she's still help
ing the team a lot.
Stanford scored 136.05 last Saturday
against Oregon State without Hall and
Smith, so hitting the goal of 138 points
shouldn't be all that difficult. But the
squad will need all the high scores it
can muster until the end of the season
to justify going on any trips in late
March or early April. Walker said that
her team will have to score 140 or bet
ter in three or four of the remaining
five meets and regionals to qualify for
nationals.
Workouts in Encina Gym and aca
demics in the Quad may be closer to
parity than most people think — as if
the theory of evolution weren't getting
its due recognition in the classroom,
Stanford's gymnasts are conducting
their own experiments on the survival
of the fittest.
Fans will have their chance to see
the healthiest Cards in their next to
last home meet tonight as the men
play host to fourth-ranked UCLA and
ninth-rated California while the wom
en entertain Washington State, both
meets beginning a 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
Sadao Hamada's squad has the
toughest assignment of the evening,
taking on the two top-10 teams without
the services of all-arounder Jim Cam
panelli. The frosh standout strained
ligaments in his right knee last Friday
night against Oregon and will be lost
for the season, according to Hamada.
