# Young V-ball team comes through
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
A young but surprisingly steady
men's volleyball team won it's first
league game Wednesday night, de
feating San Diego State 3-2 at Maples
Pavilion.
The Cardinals got off to a bad start,
losing the first five consecutive points
of the first game. They loosened up
rapidly however, giving up only four
more points and winning the game
15-9. The second game was a close con
test, in which Stanford was unable to
maintain control, losing 12-15.
The Cardinals showed strong re
cuperative powers, winning the third
game 15-11 when Bob Dean served six
straight points, but lost the fourth by
the same score. A very hungry squad
came out for the fifth game and de
molished San Diego, 15-5.
Assistant coach Don Shaw cited
Dean, Randy Smith, and Mark Reagan
as outstanding players of the game.
Smith for his 30 spikes, and Reagan for
strong defensive blocks.
"The whole team played very
steadily," said Shaw. "It's very un
characteristic of so young a team play
that way, but they really did a good job
of it."
Shaw also noted that a change has
occurred in the team's attitude since
last season. The Cardinals had de
veloped a tendency to crack under
pressure in close matches such as this
one, but Wednesday night he saw no
such signs.
"These guys showed that they
wanted to win badly, they were very
hungry," he remarked. "They didn't
get tight in tight situations, they just
came out and crushed San Diego in the
fifth game. I hope we can continue to
do that."
The Cardinal's only problem
seemed to be one of gaining momen
tum, but each time San Diego threat
ened them the squad came through to
retain the lead. "A couple of times I
thought we were in trouble, but they
really hung on," said Shaw.
The Cardinals will play their next
home game against UC-Santa Cruz, at
Maples Pavilion Tuesday night; the
match will begin at 7.30 p.m.
