- A guy with many unanswered
questions. . .and a smile in my heart.
Txi'ris the night bejore V-Day
When I left my cltiss,
To meet with a chicken
And talk fiberglass.
The films: They were Irippy.
(Appropriate though)
'Cuz that was the night that
Weirdo met Weirdo.
Since then it's been true Im'e,
And I sing this song:
I certainty hope thai
The Beats will go on.
Kenny,
Love you rilot!!!
(Even though you are a lousy backgammon
player!) S.
Roses are red,
Vtolas ate few:
My hfe would be dead,
Lirul', if it weren't for you.
