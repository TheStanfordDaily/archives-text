In each human heart there are a tiger, a
pig, an ass. and a nightingale. Diversity of
character is due to their unequal activity.'
— Ambrose Bierce
,For the lovestruck, Valentine's Day has
always been a time of do or die.' The same ap
plies to the publishing industry, which puts out
a plethora of love-related books each year
before Valentine's Day, only to have them re
maindered soon afterwards These offerings
range from Rod McKuen-style schlock to the
more hard core Joy of Sex. One constant
always seems to remain true, however:
almost without exception, you are better off
buying flowers.
The Hook of Hearts is an exception A col
lection of heart-related trivia — a sort of nar
rowed Hook of Lists — it has somehow man
aged to rise above its gimmick to become gen
uinely fun and interesting
112 he key to its success lies in its variety and
good taste. The literary selections, which
dominate the book, are all from high-brow fa
miliars. and make good reading: there's
Poe's Telltale Heart. Shakespeare's Betwixt
Mine Eyes and Heart. Johnson's definition of

the heart, a John Donne poem, and even — oh
my God. not that again — something from
Chretien de Troves. In addition, quotes — hun
dreds of them — are sprinkled in the margin;
the quote at the beginning of this article is one
of these.
The scientific trivia is mostly morbid and
definitely along the lines of "amaze your
friends:" did you know, for instance, that the
heart of a blue whale beats five or six times a
minute, whereas the heart of a shrew beats
one thousand times per minute? Or that heart
disease costs this country about $28 billion per
year?
Other non-scientific trivia includes: a reci
pe for pickled elk heart, a crossword puzzle,
instructions on how to play Hearts,' and cul
ture and literary quizzes (who wrote "Batter
my heart, three person God. . .?"). The
strangest of all is the Shakespeare Cardio
graph. a graph which plots the number of ref
erences to hearts in Shakespeare's plays
against the period of his life in which they
were written. Surprisingly, the play with the
fewest references to the heart is Hamlet.
The Book of Hearts is a fluke of marketing
Hearts are a gimmick, and a gimmick that is
dwelt upon usually becomes annoying. Some
how, it doesn't here: the quality of the materi
al is one reason. The other is Dorman's re
fusal to equate the heart with love: from tiger
to pig to ass to nightingale, the heart gets full
play in these 110 pages, and still somehow sur
vives a complete and profound mystery.
For the more literal-minded, there's The
Aphrodisiac Cookbook, 124 pages of hopeful

recipes designed to leave the dishes for later
According to the author, this book is not in
tended for those with an eye to obscene cake
designs. Rather, he writes, it is "for those who
enjoy the subtlety of a bowl containing bold
bananas and furry clefted peaches. " The sub
tlety of his statement is questionable, and
many will object to the stereotyped fruit tare
there no bold peaches or fuzzv bananas in this
world 0 ); still, the recipes sound pretty good
There is. for instance:
Apricots in Hub hies
6 ripe apricots, peeled, halved, and pitted.
Champagne
Place apricots in chilled champagne glass.
Fill with champagne. Garnish with fresh mint
leaves.
The reviewer tried this recipe — amid dim
lights, appropriate music, and the scent of
fresh tulips — and the effect was tremendous.
TREMENDOUS. Unfortunately, the re
viewer was alone.
Being the basically meat and potatoes man
that he is. the author has not included instruc
tions for doubling or trebling recipes. He has,
however, included an alphebetical list at the
back of the book of what he and popular myth
consider to be aphrodisiacs. All the old favor
ites — oysters, figs, and asparagus, for in
stance — figure heavily, but also listed are
hundreds of lesser known items such as liver,
acidophilus, and the phosphorus in shrimp. All
of the ingredients can be combined and re
combined into your own recipes — the only
cautionary note that the author adds is that
portions should not be too large.

In each human heart there are a tiger, a
pig, an ass. and a nightingale. Diversity of
character is due to their unequal activity.'
— Ambrose Bierce
,For the lovestruck, Valentine's Day has
always been a time of do or die.' The same ap
plies to the publishing industry, which puts out
a plethora of love-related books each year
before Valentine's Day, only to have them re
maindered soon afterwards These offerings
range from Rod McKuen-style schlock to the
more hard core Joy of Sex. One constant
always seems to remain true, however:
almost without exception, you are better off
buying flowers.
The Hook of Hearts is an exception A col
lection of heart-related trivia — a sort of nar
rowed Hook of Lists — it has somehow man
aged to rise above its gimmick to become gen
uinely fun and interesting
112 he key to its success lies in its variety and
good taste. The literary selections, which
dominate the book, are all from high-brow fa
miliars. and make good reading: there's
Poe's Telltale Heart. Shakespeare's Betwixt
Mine Eyes and Heart. Johnson's definition of

the heart, a John Donne poem, and even — oh
my God. not that again — something from
Chretien de Troves. In addition, quotes — hun
dreds of them — are sprinkled in the margin;
the quote at the beginning of this article is one
of these.
The scientific trivia is mostly morbid and
definitely along the lines of "amaze your
friends:" did you know, for instance, that the
heart of a blue whale beats five or six times a
minute, whereas the heart of a shrew beats
one thousand times per minute? Or that heart
disease costs this country about $28 billion per
year?
Other non-scientific trivia includes: a reci
pe for pickled elk heart, a crossword puzzle,
instructions on how to play Hearts,' and cul
ture and literary quizzes (who wrote "Batter
my heart, three person God. . .?"). The
strangest of all is the Shakespeare Cardio
graph. a graph which plots the number of ref
erences to hearts in Shakespeare's plays
against the period of his life in which they
were written. Surprisingly, the play with the
fewest references to the heart is Hamlet.
The Book of Hearts is a fluke of marketing
Hearts are a gimmick, and a gimmick that is
dwelt upon usually becomes annoying. Some
how, it doesn't here: the quality of the materi
al is one reason. The other is Dorman's re
fusal to equate the heart with love: from tiger
to pig to ass to nightingale, the heart gets full
play in these 110 pages, and still somehow sur
vives a complete and profound mystery.
For the more literal-minded, there's The
Aphrodisiac Cookbook, 124 pages of hopeful

recipes designed to leave the dishes for later
According to the author, this book is not in
tended for those with an eye to obscene cake
designs. Rather, he writes, it is "for those who
enjoy the subtlety of a bowl containing bold
bananas and furry clefted peaches. " The sub
tlety of his statement is questionable, and
many will object to the stereotyped fruit tare
there no bold peaches or fuzzv bananas in this
world 0 ); still, the recipes sound pretty good
There is. for instance:
Apricots in Hub hies
6 ripe apricots, peeled, halved, and pitted.
Champagne
Place apricots in chilled champagne glass.
Fill with champagne. Garnish with fresh mint
leaves.
The reviewer tried this recipe — amid dim
lights, appropriate music, and the scent of
fresh tulips — and the effect was tremendous.
TREMENDOUS. Unfortunately, the re
viewer was alone.
Being the basically meat and potatoes man
that he is. the author has not included instruc
tions for doubling or trebling recipes. He has,
however, included an alphebetical list at the
back of the book of what he and popular myth
consider to be aphrodisiacs. All the old favor
ites — oysters, figs, and asparagus, for in
stance — figure heavily, but also listed are
hundreds of lesser known items such as liver,
acidophilus, and the phosphorus in shrimp. All
of the ingredients can be combined and re
combined into your own recipes — the only
cautionary note that the author adds is that
portions should not be too large.
