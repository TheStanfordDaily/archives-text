Tonight.' Kresge
Roman Polanski directed this
fine, violent, nightmarish evoca
tion of the ,10s Los Angeles under
world Faye Dunaway plays a
woman who has a terrible secret.
Jack Nicholson plays the detective
who must help her Both per
formers give astounding per
formances. Nicholson, especially,
makes us feel the unwholesome
ness that accompanies this Cali
fornian wasteland
There are no "good ' characters
in this film; they are all victims
or. at best, not particularly sym
pathetic victims Polanski brings
out the worst in all of us; his genius
is a disturbingly bitter one.

Melvin and Howard ***★
Park, Menlo Park
The so-called "Mormon will"
story is the inspiration for
Jonathan Demme's Melvin and
Howard This is an imaginative re
construction of the meeting be
tween Melvin Dummar (Paul Le
Mat) and Howard Hughes (Jason
Robards), and of Dummar s life
during the eight years that fol
lowed. The script contains some of
the best writing in movies of the
last several years; Melvin and
Howard is a classic American
comedy
Robards towers over the movie,
even though he appears only brief
ly at the beginning and (in a
flashback) at the end. And Paul Le
Mat, the overage adolescent in the
yellow deuce coupe in American
Graffiti, plays Melvin better, one
would say, then anyone else could
have. When this incomparably
generous bumpkin sings with
shrewd, sad-eyed Robards, the
moment is magic.

At 70. Akira Kurosawa directs
what may be his summit achieve
ment: a samurai epic that sug
gests a fusion of Shakespeare and
Pirandello. A thief is hired as the
shadow' of a samurai chieftain —
to stand in for him when he is in
jured in battle — and when the
leader dies, the thief must take
over. There's a post—battle se
quence that is reminiscent of the
Guernica ' A masterpiece.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sort of like Clodxpell with dirty
jokes. Several brilliant sketches
are lost in the drivel; it's all funny,
but it goes on tor much too long.
The Monty Python troupe takes
aim at Biblical epics, terrorist
logistics, and the PLO; while they
don't always score, in this form
even a string of bullseyes would be
boring. A Python movie needs a
better plot than the Bible can pro
vide.

John Cassavetes movies are so
unyieldingly in his own style that
when he begins to imitate other
people he is praised for it. (1 loria t is
a junk collage made up from bits
from Little Caesar. The God
father. Little Miss Marker and
some of the nastier film's noirs of
the early '50s It's accessible, all
right, and compared to his "seri
ous" work — Egf.es, for instance,
or .1 Woman I r nder (!)<• Influence
— it's almost enjoyable. But it's a
dreadful movie.
Cassavetes' wife, Gena
Rowlands (playing a woman who
isn't neurotic — for the first time
in one of her husband's movies),
gives a surprisingly resilient per
formance. But she tends to play
emotional scenes with every mus
cle in her face — a peculiar: kind of
mugging.

Alfred Hitchcock directed this
tale of intrigue set in the days im
mediately preceding World War
11. Though it has neither the moral
depth nor the ambiguity of
Hitchcock's greatest work, it nev
ertheless manages to be wonder
fully entertaining The movie is
filled with the set-pieces
Hitchcock is famous for: a wind-,
mill, used as a signal by spies, has
vanes that spin backwards; a
rainy-day murderer is hidden in a
sea of people carrying umbrellas;
a plana crash over the ocean is
filmed from the pilot's point of
view — we see the water loom near
and crash through the windshield
in a single shot. Joel McCrea plays
an American reporter- sent to find
out what all of this is supposed to
mean.

Raging Hull***'*
P'ine Arts. Palo Alto
Raging Hull is a great piece of
moviemaking, and it is a pow
erhouse. But on every level direc
tor Martin Scorsese throws ob
stacles in our path that prevent us
from becoming involved with the
film's characters. Scorsese and
star Robert De Niro have done
something very strange: they
have created a hero (based on the
life of famous middleweight Jake
La Motta) who does not respond on
any level to our attempt to locate
him on the human scale: he is im
penetrable. Raning Hull is all
about passion, yet in some ul
timate and important way the pas
sion never reaches us, even when
Jake's blood spatters the spec
tators at the last fight As much as
I admire the film's technique. I
have to confess I don't like it very
much.

A/oh Onvle iVAmeriqne ★★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Mon Oncle d'Amerique is the
latest in a series of exceptional
film essays by director Alain
Resnais<7.fl>f Year at Marienbad,
Ni.aht and F >u). This examination

of human destiny and choice fol
lows the lives of three characters
— a wealthy executive, a devoutly
Catholic superviser in a textile
plant, and an actress who was
raised a Communist — as they
almost accidentally intersect.
Their story is intercut with an in
terview with real-life psychologist
Henri Laborit. changing the film
into something that is not-quite
fiction and not-quite fact. The ten
sion between documentary and
narrative gives Mon Oncle
d'Amerique its resonance; the dis
tance between where the charac
ters are and where they would like
to be gives the film its dry, some
times-bitter humor.

Haskell Wexler. who directed
the fascinating mock-documen
tary Medium Cool, photographed
this rock-documentary of the
MUSE (Musicians United for Safe
Energy) benefit which took place
in New York a year ago. He's
chosen to emphasize the per
formers' faces, often to
mesmerizing effect — we've never
been so close to these people
before. It's possible to question the
legitimacy of celebrities cam

paigning about such an issue
(would the movie have been made
any differently if the benefit had
been in support of nuclear energy
instead of against it?) but it's hard
not to get caught up with their en
thusiasm and concern.
Your opinion of the movie will
inevitably be affected by your
opinion of its people. They include
Bruce Springsteen and the E
Street Band. Jackson Browne, the
Doobie Brothers, and Gil Scott-

Citizen Kane ★★★★
Monday. Kresge
Kane's reputation as being the
greatest movie ever made
shouldn't scare you away from
seeing it. This is a masterpiece
that's also masterfully fun to
watch. Orson Welles, who
directed, starred, and co-wrote,
called the movies the greatest toy
train set a boy ever had, and his
film is infused with a sense of pure
joy in exploring the capabilities of
the medium. Tradition has it that
William Randolph Hearst, after
discovering the unpleasant simi
larities between Kane and his own
life, had the movie suppressed:
the truth may be that audiences of
the time were simply unprepared
for the movie's elliptical narrative

and precedent shattering tech
nique If you see only one movie
this quarter, this should be it.
Plays with another master
piece. Jean Renoir's Rules of the
damp.

I tiered States *
Palo Alto Square
Altered States is the world's
first 70-millimeter, six-track ster
eo Looney Tune. It's brightly col
ored. wonderfully noisy, and utter
ly vacuous.
Ken Russell (Women in Lore,
Tommy) directed; Paddy
Chayefsky (Network) wrote the
story and screenplay. This tale of a
man who turns into an ape
(honest) and does other colorful
things after he takes a rare drug
reflects the worst aspects of both
of its creators: from Russell it re
ceives pointless visual flam
boyance; from Chayefsky it gains
pointless philosophical dis
cussions ("What is man" 5 When do
we eat?"). Its visuals, however,
are very pretty — the movie prac
tically begs you to stop thinking
long enough to enjoy them — and
the soundtrack ("Megasound") is
loud and creepy It's amazing what
wonderful things one can do with
no ideas at all.

Th'' Incredible Shrinking
Woman which stars Lily Tomlin
as (surprise!) a woman who
shrinks, goes wrong in more ways
than most movies have ways: it is
a small miracle of ineptitude.
A feeling of great things being
missed pervades the movie Even
the special effects seem tired —
the business of shrinking is treated
more like a chore to be completed
than a possibility for exercising
the imagination The movie ends
up being a little depressing: it
laughs so loudly at its own, tiny
punchline that it's hard not to feel
that someone along the line forgot
to tell the joke.

Seems l ike Old limes *
Palo Alto Square
A movie only a schnauzer could
love. Goldie Hawn. Chevie Chase,
and Charles Gfodin share the
screen with six dogs in assorted
sizes; the only really funny scene
comes when the dogs turn up their
noses at Hawn's pepperoni
chicken. Neil Simon's script com
bines a ludicrous storyline with
one-dimensional characters:
Hawn has nothing to do but act
frazzled, while Grodin snivels and
Chase mugs. The "old times" that
Simon would like to evoke are the
screwball comedies of the '30s and
'40s, but Seems Like Old Times
only brings to mind the TV sitcoms
of the '70s.

Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business: his showing as
Buddy Holly makes this movie
worthwhile. Busey can sing, and
he's also a marvelously idiosyn
cratic actor When the plot gets
saccharine toward the end he
holds it all together. The Huddy
Holly Story could've been better,
and that 's no hooey, but it's hard to
imagine a better hick superstar

Old Mill. Mountain View
One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about the revenge three abused
secretaries take on their
chauvinistic boss are quickly
smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy
with a fake feminist gloss and a
Frank Capracorn ending. Lily
Tomlin. Dolly Parton and Dabney
Coleman salvage as much as they
can. but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance: trying to
play a woman of average in
telligence and to be light and funny
at the same time, she telegraphs
appallingly and gives us scenes of
classic female incompetence,
which surely, cannot be what she
intended.
