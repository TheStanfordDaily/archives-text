## Spartans pin Stanford wrestling team 
### Mark Kerber 
Stanford wrestled well but was ov
ermatched in a 38-8 loss to a very
tough San Jose State team Tuesday
night. Head coach Chris Horpel, how
ever, was realistic about the loss.
"They had a lot of seniors and used all
three of their nationally-ranked peo
ple." said Horpel, referring to the Tro
jans' Eddie Baza. (134 lbs.), Reggie
Thompson, (158 lbs.), and David
Brouhard. (190 lbs.), each of whom
are ranked in the NCAA's top eight.
The Cardinals picked up two wins, at

150 and 167 pounds.
At 150, Bruce Rubin scored a 14-3 de
cision for Stanford. After a scoreless
first period. Rubin exploded with an
escape and a quick headlock for a 5-0
lead, then kept constant pressure on
his opponent to seal the victory.
Mark Martel used similar tactics in
the 167-lb. match. Tied 2-2 in the first
period, Martel took control and physi
cally dominated the rest of the match.
After the meet, Martel commented
on his strategy. "Lots of pain'' he said.
"You have to hurt them."

Rubin agreed. "When you're on top,
you have to take something out of
them. If the guy's intimidated, you
have him."
In most of the match-ups, however,
it was the Trojans applying the pres
sure. At 126 lbs, Tim Daniels led 4-2,
but lost concentration and was de
feated 15-9. Eddie Baza took down
Stanford's Derrick Strahorn five
times en route to a 16-8 victory by ma
jor decision at 134.
At 158, Denny Childs refused to be
pinned, but was nevertheless domi

nated by USC's Reggie Thompson,
33-8.
Tom Mullen lost a controversial 7-6
decision at 177. Mullen lost on riding
time after yielding a late reversal
near the edge of the mat.
190-pounder Doug Perkins had his
hands full in a 15-3 loss to David
Brouhard. Perkins had previously lost
to Brouhard only 6-3 and 6-4, but
couldn't come that close this time
around.
San Jose State added eighteen more
points on Stanford forfeits at 118 lbs,
142 lbs. and the heavyweight division.
