# Hoover's Marotta spreads the Institution's views and prestige
## 
### Richard Ross 
Did you know that along with foun
tain pens, good manners, and Saturn's
rings the Hoover Institution is
"in?"Or so say the editors of Wom
en's Wear Daily, who listed it in their
"What's in?" column.
In the last several years, and in the
last year in particular, the Hoover's
visibility has exploded. The Hoover is
in the news practically every day,
either as the source for a story or as
the subject of the story itself.
The person largely responsible for
the new visibility of the Institution is
Hoover Senior Fellow George Marot
ta. A soft-spoken man, Marotta is
making the Hoover a household name
in America.
Marotta. also head of the public af
fairs program at the Hoover, has an
extensive background in the foreign
policy establishment of the United
States
He came to the Hoover after work
ing with the National Security Coun
cil, the State Department, the Defense
Department, and the Agency for In
ternational Development Marotta
also helped establish the Peace Corps
and has field experience in Southeast
Asia, Latin America, and Western Eu
rope
Marotta s latest research concerns
the problems of Third World develop
ment in the context of north/south re

lations. He also teaches sophomore
seminars focusing on Third World de
velopment and on the instruments of
U.S. foreign policy. Marotta has no
formal training in public relations, his
main concern at the Hoover these
days.
As he says."I spend about as much
time getting the works of Hoover
scholars out to the media as I do on my
own research."
Among the Marotta's successes at
the Hoover is the Op-Ed program he
instituted three years ago. This pro
gram consists of sending short opinion
pieces to local and national news
papers with the expressed intent that
they be used on the Op-Ed pages, those
opposite the editorial pages.
During the first year of the pro
gram. according to Marotta, editors
printed about 17 pieces. The second
year, newspapers published 58 of the
pieces, and in 1979 the number jumped
to about 100 Marotta hopes to have
double last year 's figure of 180 editori
als in 1981.
He says he will succeed He said
that in the month of January this year,
newspapers published twice the
number of editorials they did last Jan
uary Overall, Marotta says. Ameri
can newspapers and magazines pub
lished more than 350 pages of new
paper" clippings about or by Hoover
scholars

The publications that printed in
formation emanating from the Hoover
include The Neic York Times, The
Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles
Times, The Wall Street -Journal, The
Times of India, The Economist,
Neirsieeck, and, of course, Women's
Wear Daily.
Not all papers accept articles, ac
cording to Marotta. He said The
Washington Post has been noticeably
resistant to Hoover articles, a fact
Marotta finds strange as he expects
the editors of that "liberal'' journal
"would like to have more balance."
The Op-Ed program is hardly the
only means used to spread the Hoover
word. "All kinds of electronic media
have been coming to the Hoover to do
stories, especially since Reagan was
elected," Marotta said.
Television networks from England,
France, Italy, and Switzerland have
done stories. The Swiss network will
include their story in a series they are
preparing for broadcast for all of Eu
rope. entitled "Present Times."ln the
United States, many television stories
focus on the Hoover In addition, ac
cording to Marotta. Hoover scholars
are often asked to appear on both tele
vision and radio talk shows
As head of public affairs, Marotta is
the person responsible for disseminat

ing as rapidly as possible information
regarding the vast amount of work
produced at the Institution. This in
formation, if left to run through the
usual cycle of scholarly dispersal
would "take about two years to reach
the man on the street," Marotta said
"Sometin.es an idea just won't or
can't take that long.'' he added.
It is also Marotta's job to schedule
interviews and act as a general liaison
officer between the Hoover and the
journalists who arrive at the Hoover's
doorstep.
Marotta says he does not seek ag
grandizement of the Hoover's reputa
tion. Rather, he believes the public af
fairs program is meant to get topical
opinions and information to the public
in order to both "enhance the results
of debate and the consideration of pub
lic policy issues at all levels through
out the U. 5.," and to "show thetruedi
versity of opinion (of the Hoover )"
The Public Affairs Program should
enable the man on the street to gauge
what is being done at the Hoover by
way of public communication with the
fellows. Marotta said, and to expose
the Hoover to all forms of criticism
Marotta added the main goal that is
part of the responsibility of being an
influential think-tank is seeking to be
more responsive to the needs of the
American public.
