## Chinese expect culture shakeup 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — Huang Zhen. Chi
na's minister of culture, has
been replaced in what Chinese
sources said last week would
probably become a general re
organization of the cultural bu
reaucracy here with a stronger
emphasis on the political
message in art.
Huang, an' artist from the
Shanghai of the free-wheeling
1930s as well as a veteran
diplomat who has served in Par
is. Budapest and Washington,
has been shifted to the lesser
post of chairman of the newly
revived Commission on Cultural
Relations with Foreign Coun
tries.
The key appointment, how
ever. will be that of a new direc
tor of the Communist Party's
Propaganda Department,
whicn sets policy in culture,
education and the' mass media.
Wang Renzhong, tte current di
rector. is widely expected to be
come the party's general secre
tary, succeeding Hu Yaobang
when he becomes party chair
man.
As the Propaganda Depart
ment chief for the last year.
Wang has proven far more or
thodox than Hu. his predeces
sor, and has been insistent re
cently that artists consider the
social impact of their works. As
general secretary. Wang would
have a major voice in picking
his successor, an indication to
Chinese of strengthened ideol
ogical controls on all the arts.
Didactic role
Conservatives within the par
ty and government are pushing
strongly now for a full return to
the didactic role of the arts un
der socialism and for new re
strictions on what they term the

undirected creative impulses of
artists here. The appointments
of a new Propaganda Depart
ment chief and minister of cul
ture will probably settle that
question in practical terms for
several years.
"In Chinese politics, cultural
policy is a key bellwether," a
Chinese novelist said. "If you
want to know the fate of de
mocracy, of constitutional re
form, of economic liber
alization, cultural policy will
give the first indications. . . .
Cultural policy, on the other
hand, exaggerates the other
changes like a logarithmic scale
does. But that is the nature of
the arts and of artists. "
Huang's political standing as
a former political secretary to
the late Chairman Mao Zedong
and to Chu Teh. founder of the
People's Liberation Army, and
as one of the diplomats recalled
for two years of "re-education"
early in the Cultural Revolu
tion, enabled him to take over
the decimated Ministry of Cul
ture. cleanse it of most of the
radicals and.in effect, re-estab
lish its authority.
Huang had come to the job at
the end of 1977 after serving for
more than four years as the first
chief of the Chinese Liaison Of
fice in Washington before Sino-
American relations were nor
malized at the start of 1979.
As disliked as Huang is by
writers, artists and musicians,
who criticize his autocratic
ways, many were concerned
this weekend by who would re
place him. "The new minister
will reflect the present mood,
which is increasingly tight, and
that makes Huang look not so
bad." a member of the artists
union said.
