# Japan seeks deregulation of nuclear plant
## 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo â€” In an early test of the Reagan ad
ministration nuclear non-proliferation poli
cy. Japan is preparing to seek removal of
the major restrictions on its nuclear fuel re
processing plant.
Officials say they will probably ask the
new administration to lift limits on the
amount of fuel that can be reprocessed in an
experimental plant and to do away with
time limits that had been imposed in the
past at the insistence of the Carter adminis
tration.
They say they do not know how the United
States will react to the proposals, but
Japanese press reports indicate that some
expect the Reagan administration to take a
less rigid posture than the Carter adminis
tration.
If agreement is not reached by this sum
mer. Japan's experimental plant at Tokai
mura theoretically could be shut down. It
began full-scale operations in January for
the first time and is legally able to operate
only until June 1 under a new interim agree
ment with the United States.
Plutonium
The issue was one of the most con
troversial ones between Japan and the Unit
ed States throughout the Carter years. In
itially. President Jimmy Carter had strong
ly opposed the Tokai-mura operation be
cause it had-the potential for producing
Plutonium, the stuff of which nuclear ex
plosives are made.
Japan insisted that the pilot plant was es
sential for its long-range plan of nuclear
energy development. In September 1977,Ahe
two countries reached agreement on a two
year operating plan that has since been ex

tended until June 1 of this year.
Foreign Ministry officials said they ex
pect to open "informal contacts" on the is
sue soon with the Reagan administration
but do not expect formal negotiations until
this spring because it is not yet clear who
will be the responsible officials in Washing
ton.
Atsuhiko Yatabe, director-general for
scientific and technological affairs at the
Foreign Ministry, said no specific plan for
the negotiations has been prepared.
But he noted that the present ceiling on
spent nuclear fuel reprocessing will be
reached by late spring. "In view of this,
there is a general feeling in Japan that the
time has come to talk with the Americans
on the reprocessing issue and to reach a
basic agreement" on what can be under
taken after June 1.
Fixed periods
Specifically, he said, this would mean
asking for an open-ended agreement that
would end the practice of setting fixed peri
ods of time for Tokai-mura's plant to oper
ate.
It would also mean removing ceilings
completely on the amount of fuel that can be
reprocessed there.
From its beginning in September 1977 un
til the end of 1980, 79 tons of spent fuel had
been reprocessed there. In theory, the plant
could reprocess about 140 tons a year, giving
time off for cleaning and repairs. There are
reports that Japan would want to reprocess
about 100 tons a year.
Yatabe said there have been no clear in
dications from Reagan administration of
ficials on what attitude they will adopt
toward rules for nuclear proliferation. But
he noted that "it seems much more positive

than the previous one on the question of nu
clear power in general."
Although the Tokai-mura pilot plant is
small in output, the question of U.S.-im
posed restrictions has great importance for
future Japanese nuclear development. The
government last year opened the door for
private commercial reprocessing and one
company, Japan Atomic Fuel Service, is
planning to open a full-scale operation about
1990 to process about 1200 tons a year.
Purchase
The enriched uranium used in Japan's nu
clear power plants is purchased from the
United States, which reserves the right to
set restrictions on any reprocessing of the
spent fuel.
In an agreement signed last month, the
United States permitted Japan to process 50
additional tons before the June 1 deadline
and the Tokai-mura plant theoretically
could be shut down after that. It will be
closed anyway after that date for about
three months for cleaning and repair, so the
actual deadline will be about Sept. 1. Of
ficials indicated that if no overall agree
ment to continue operations is reached by
that time, a new interim agreement might
be negotiated.
Japan, the only target of atomic bomb
ings since the dawn of the nuclear age, dis
claims any intention of building nuclear
weapons, although some experts have re
ported it has or will soon have the technolo
gy for making them.
The government has said repeatedly that
it is only interested in industrial uses for nu
clear fuel and that Japan must have more
nuclear energy to make it less dependent on
imported oil and gas.
