# Iran has internal worries

From the Daily wire services
Tehran, Iran — Two years af
ter the Islamic fundamentalist
revolution brought down Iran's
2500-year-old monarchy, the
country is grappling with a
plethora of major problems — a
prolonged war with Iraq, per
sistent rebellion in Kurdistan
Province and internal political
squabbling.
In attempts to stifle the quar
rels, religious leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini recently ap
pealed to Iranian politicians for
an end to the attacks.
"Don't force me to carry out
my duty because it could take
away from anyone everything I
gave him," the ayatollah said.
The threat appeared to in
dicate the severity of the politi
cal in-fighting and the extent of
the confusion it has caused.
It also seemed to indicate that
the ayatollah remains the un
contested leader of Iran. Al
though he has receded from the
day-to-day functionings of the
country, the 80-year-old
ayatollah, who sparked the ex
shah's overthrow, has been at
center stage during key events
in post-revolutionary Iran.
Embassy
It was his militant "student"
supporters who seized the
American embassy staff. The
hostages were freed 444 days
later following an agreement
based on conditions set by the
ayatollah.
The ayatollah also played an
undisputed role in the resigna
tion of the provisional revolu
tionary government of former
Prime Minister Mehdi
Bazargan, who stepped down in
the spring of 1979 complaining
that power splits made govern
ing next to impossible. He
shared power with the Islamic
Revolutionary Council, headed
by the ayatollah.
Since then, the position of
Moslem fundamentalists was
strengthened when the clergy
led Islamic Republican Party
gained a majority in the Iranian
Parliament, prompting re
peated, public quarrels with
President Abolhassan Bani
Sadr.
Meanwhile, Iran adamantly
rejects any attempts to mediate
a settlement of the Persian Gulf
war that has severely hampered
Iranian oil exports and is strain
ing the country's economy, al
ready hit by Western economic
sanctions over the hostage
crisis.
Meanwhile, no headway has
been made in soothing separa
tist aspirations in the western
Iranian region of Kurdistan.
Iranian revolutionary leaders
have repeatedly said that they
would n6t give in to Kurdish au
tonomy demands.
