# 'It is ultimately our rights at stake'
## Pro-choice speaker urges action 
### Louise Solomon 
Control over our own repro
ductive rights is in jeopardy to
day and has already been lost by
the poor," said civil rights ac
tivist Margaret Crosby, speak
ing at a noon lecture sponsored
by CROW (Center for Research
on Women).
Addressing the controversial
abortion funding issue, Crosby
told her primarily female au
dience to "organize." Crosby,
who graduated from Yale Law

School in 1973 and has since de
voted much of her professional
career to civil rights issues, em
phasized that the pro-choice fac
tion "truly is the majority."
"It is ultimately our rights at
stake and it's up to us to cherish
and safeguard them," she said.
Reiterating that her "main
message" is that women must
organize, she implied that the
present lack of energetic action
is due to personal inexperience
with the past struggle for abor

tion rights.
"Too many of us came of age
when abortions were legal. The
horror stories have faded," said
Crosby.
She went on to raise the most
direct appeal for action thus far
in this winter's CROW series by
requesting the audience to get in
touch with the Pro-Choice Al
liance at Stanford or Menlo
Park.
Crosby noted that only nine
states now offer Medicaid for

the indigent and that even these
programs are under attack by
the Moral Majority.
Criminal abortion laws were
commonplace until 1973, at
which time the Supreme Court
handed down two landmark de
cisions, Crosby said. The most
significant aspects of the rul
ings determined that abortion
was solely the decision of the
pregnant woman and her physi
cian and that the government
should have no role in that de
cision.
Following the ruling, most re
strictive abortion laws and stat
utes were struck down by the
courts, and "women's rights
were considered paramount,"
Crosby said. Crosby added, how
ever, that since 1973 many
"anti-choice" groups have tried
to combat that decision.
As for federally funded abor
tions, Crosby implied that the
anti-choice groups were having
a "field-day" with the legisla
ture. She said that they often at
tach an amendment which the
anti-abortionists support to a
bill of crucial national im
portance. Crosby likened this
tactic to "bribery."
A key example , she noted, is
the Hyde amendment, which
prohibited the use of federal
funds for abortion and was
strategically attached to the en
tire HEW budget for 1976.
In February of 1980 a lower
court ruled that the Hyde
amendment was unconstitu
tional. However, since that time
the Supreme Court has upheld
the amendment, Crosby said.
In June of 1978 an amendment
to the California state budget
prohibited appropriation of
state funds for abortions except

in cases of special medical
need. This amendment is cur
rently being considered by the
California Supreme Court,
Crosby said.
Crosby was one of the lawyers
involved in the presentation to
the Court. She added that this
amendment will have especially
grave effects for teenage girls,
who account for 30,000 of the
Medicaid funded abortions each
year.
"The California Supreme
Court will lose 30 years of its
more progressive decisions" if
it follows the United States Su
preme Court's ideas on this is
sue, she said. This viewpoint,
Crosby maintained, "harks
back to old views of welfare in
which welfare was considered a
kind of charity." She called this
"poverty morality" and added
that it allowed states to inflict

their own opinions about abor
tion on women.
The state Court's decision is
expected any day or any hour,
Crosby said. But she also
warned that even if the decision
is favorable, a referendum bat
tle is expected.
Crosby noted that the mortal
ity and birth defect rate for
teenage mothers is unusually
high Speaking of the teenage
girls who will be denied abor
tions under the new amend
ment, she said, "80 percent of
them will drop out of high
school; 94 percent will keep
their babies; and of these, 92
percent will be on welfare
within five years."
Crosby also explained the
four theories which she and oth
ers recently presented to the
state Supreme Court. The first
of these, "vagueness." claims

that there are no clear criteria
for doctors to distinguish what
is or is not "medical need. "
The second theory, "equal
protection," holds that under
this amendment the rich will
still be able to get abortions on
demand, whereas the poor will
not be able to get them at all.
The third theory showed that a
woman on welfare would not be
able to get an abortion without
"breaking the law."
The fourth theory is "neutral
ity"— the idea that the govern
ment should not be allowed to
subsidize only one side of the
abortion issue by only subsidiz
ing welfare and not the right to
have an abortion as well.
Crosby concluded, '"The
Court seemed most interested
in the last argument which is
also my favorite."
