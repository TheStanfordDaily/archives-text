# New committee solicits student input on Honor Code structure
## 
### Karen Springen 
Students here are familiar with the
term "honor code" but are often ig
norant of what constitutes a violation
and of how to report one.
In an effort to educate students, the
Honor Code Commission will imple
ment a Student Advisory Committee
this spring The committee will pro
vide a forum for publicity and com
munication concerning the code.
According to sophomore Frances
Wong, an Honor Code Commission
member, the duties of the commission
should include getting feedback from
students on the code. However, "the
Honor Code Commission is too small
to really integrate with the student
body," she said.
The advisory group, a separate
committee of about 30 students, will
assume this function. Members, to be
selected based on application forms
submitted to the commission, will
counsel students on matters concern
ing the code.
They will represent a cross-section
of University housing. During Spring
quarter, committee members will in
troduce themselves to students in
their living areas. Members will be
available to answer questions and to
deal with problems, Wong said.
The system is designed to provide a
bridge of communication between the
students and the advisory committee,
and between the committee and the
commission, she said.
As a condition of entering the Uni
versity. all students signed a paper ac
cepting the code. And freshmen orien
tation packets contain an honor code
booklet. But few students remember
either of these facts. As a result, many
honor code-related problems have
arisen because of ignorance, Wong
said. The committee representatives
will help solve this problem by attend

ing house meetings and by being ac
cessible, she said.
"Students often don't know which
channels to turn to," Wong said. For
example, they may hesitate to make
an accusation tor fear of being wrong.
Discussing the case with a committee
member rather than being told to "go
to the Ombudsman" would be easier
and less intimidating, she said.
Wong called the advisory commit
tee "a more personal approach to the
honor code" than has previously ex
isted here.
The committee will hold sherry
hours and forums to solicit input. Top
ics that will be addressed include
methods of enforcing the code, chang
ing parts of the code, the actual validi
ty of the code, and pros and cons of
proctoring during tests. Recommen
dations will be submitted to the stu
dent legislative council.
According to junior Blake Jor
gensen. the committee's staff assis
tant, the code asserts that students
are responsible for themselves. The
use of a proctor implies mistrust and
defeats the purpose of students "being
here to learn." he said.
A relatively new issue which the
committee will address concerns the
potential abuse of the computer sci
ence system here. Most students lack
the knowledge to lock their files but
have the ability to copy someone else's
program.
Another computer-related problem,
which Wong said probably constituted
a violation of the University's Fun
damental Standard for student con
duct. involves opening numerous ac
counts.
The Honor Code requires students
to turn in someone who cheats. By sup
porting this section students "uphold
the spirit of the code." Wong said. But
the importance of these "third party"

violations is unclear to many students,
she said.
According to a recent student sur
vey, cheating here has actually de
creased slightly since 1976, But in
terest in the Honor Code has in
creased, according to Jorgensen.
Students are more aware of vio
lations now, he said. For example, stu
dents have expressed increased con
cern about teacher violations, Jor
gensen added.
It is a code violation to put students
in a position in which cheating is
temptingly easy. A situation might in
volve telling students to work on a
take-home exam for just one hour
when they have the test for a day or
more.
According to Jorgensen, the Honor
Code Commission is the only one of the
60 University committees that has im
plemented a wide-scale program such
as the Student Advisory Committee.

vey, cheating here has actually de
creased slightly since 1976, But in
terest in the Honor Code has in
creased, according to Jorgensen.
Students are more aware of vio
lations now, he said. For example, stu
dents have expressed increased con
cern about teacher violations, Jor
gensen added.
It is a code violation to put students
in a position in which cheating is
temptingly easy. A situation might in
volve telling students to work on a
take-home exam for just one hour
when they have the test for a day or
more.
According to Jorgensen, the Honor
Code Commission is the only one of the
60 University committees that has im
plemented a wide-scale program such
as the Student Advisory Committee.
Students here are familiar with the
term "honor code" but are often ig
norant of what constitutes a violation
and of how to report one.
In an effort to educate students, the
Honor Code Commission will imple
ment a Student Advisory Committee
this spring The committee will pro
vide a forum for publicity and com
munication concerning the code.
According to sophomore Frances
Wong, an Honor Code Commission
member, the duties of the commission
should include getting feedback from
students on the code. However, "the
Honor Code Commission is too small
to really integrate with the student
body," she said.
The advisory group, a separate
committee of about 30 students, will
assume this function. Members, to be
selected based on application forms
submitted to the commission, will
counsel students on matters concern
ing the code.
They will represent a cross-section
of University housing. During Spring
quarter, committee members will in
troduce themselves to students in
their living areas. Members will be
available to answer questions and to
deal with problems, Wong said.
The system is designed to provide a
bridge of communication between the
students and the advisory committee,
and between the committee and the
commission, she said.
As a condition of entering the Uni
versity. all students signed a paper ac
cepting the code. And freshmen orien
tation packets contain an honor code
booklet. But few students remember
either of these facts. As a result, many
honor code-related problems have
arisen because of ignorance, Wong
said. The committee representatives
will help solve this problem by attend

ing house meetings and by being ac
cessible, she said.
"Students often don't know which
channels to turn to," Wong said. For
example, they may hesitate to make
an accusation tor fear of being wrong.
Discussing the case with a committee
member rather than being told to "go
to the Ombudsman" would be easier
and less intimidating, she said.
Wong called the advisory commit
tee "a more personal approach to the
honor code" than has previously ex
isted here.
The committee will hold sherry
hours and forums to solicit input. Top
ics that will be addressed include
methods of enforcing the code, chang
ing parts of the code, the actual validi
ty of the code, and pros and cons of
proctoring during tests. Recommen
dations will be submitted to the stu
dent legislative council.
According to junior Blake Jor
gensen. the committee's staff assis
tant, the code asserts that students
are responsible for themselves. The
use of a proctor implies mistrust and
defeats the purpose of students "being
here to learn." he said.
A relatively new issue which the
committee will address concerns the
potential abuse of the computer sci
ence system here. Most students lack
the knowledge to lock their files but
have the ability to copy someone else's
program.
Another computer-related problem,
which Wong said probably constituted
a violation of the University's Fun
damental Standard for student con
duct. involves opening numerous ac
counts.
The Honor Code requires students
to turn in someone who cheats. By sup
porting this section students "uphold
the spirit of the code." Wong said. But
the importance of these "third party"

violations is unclear to many students,
she said.
According to a recent student sur
vey, cheating here has actually de
creased slightly since 1976, But in
terest in the Honor Code has in
creased, according to Jorgensen.
Students are more aware of vio
lations now, he said. For example, stu
