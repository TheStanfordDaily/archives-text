# Brower and Burnett to come
## Guest Prof. Board continues 
### Adam Goodman 
After being thrown into the
spotlight by hiring John An
derson, the ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board is now trying
to play down its sudden rela
tionship with him in order to
give equal attention to their oth
er guest professors and plans.
Hidden beneath Anderson's
shadow are two guest pro
fessors, David Brower, presi
dent and chairman of the board
of Friends of the Earth, a prom
inent conservationist group, and
Andree Burnett, a minority
education specialist with the
U.S. Department of Education.
Brower will teach a course on
the relationship of the environ
ment and the business world,
most likely to be called "Earth
Island: Getting from here to
2001." Board members hope

that Brower's course will be ac
credited through the Human
Biology department.
Burnett's course will deal
with minority higher education,
and the Board is trying to get it
approved through the SWOPSI
program.
Of the 20 or so people sent let
ters by the Board earlier this
year offering guest pro
fessorships, only Anderson,
Brower, and Burnett will be
coming to Stanford this spring.
Other prominent personalities
contacted by the Board included
actors Alan Alda and Woody Al
len; feminists Charlotte Bunch
and Gloria Steinem; columnist
William F. Buckley; cartoonist
Gary Trudeau; former South
Dakota Democratic Senator
George McGovern. Also, Ham
ilton Jordan — Carter White

House counsel; Montroe
Wheeler—President of the NY
Museum of Modern Art; and
Malcolm Toon-Ex-ambassador
to the U.S.S.R. McGovern and
Wheeler are likely candidates
for guest professorship posi
tions next fall, according to sev
eral Board members.
Members of the Board are
Tod Bergstrom, Dick But
terfield, Laura Charlton, Luke
Cole, Kathy Doi, Pete
Escobedo, Bobby Lapin, Glynn
O'Donnell, Steve Richardson,
Paul Salazar and Mark Ven
tresca.
Most likely the Board will ask
for a fee assessment this spring
if all goes well in their plans and
it may even be for more than
one quarter so that the program
can expand, according to Dick
Butterfield. COP Member.


John Anderson will be teaching an undergraduate
lecture class and an advanced seminar here this
spring. His coming to Stanford was initiated by
three energetic freshmen members of the ASSU

Guest Professorship Board. At the former con-
Sressman's right is Palo Alto Mayor Alan Hen
erson, who joined Anderson on the podium during
a whistle stop tour Nov. 1.
