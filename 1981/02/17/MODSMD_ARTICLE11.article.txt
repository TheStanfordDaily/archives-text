# Freshmen's persistence pays
## The
						story of Anderson's acceptance 
### Adam Goodman 
Though most students re
alize that John Anderson will
be teaching at Stanford this
spring, few know that An
derson's acceptance came
mainly through the per
sistent efforts of three
freshman members of the
ASSU Guest Professorship
Board.
The three freshmen, Tod
Bergstrom, Luke Cole and
Steve Richardson, have led
the work on the Anderson ne
gotiations, which culminated
with Anderson's personal ac
ceptance of the offer in a
meeting Feb. 3 at the
Pasadena Hilton.
Their work began Nov. 17
when Richardson sent An
derson a letter asking if he'd
be interested in a guest pro
fessorship offer. "I did not
have anyone in mind to write
so I took Anderson," Rich
ardson said, describing one
of the first meetings of the
board last quarter. "I called
his Washington office to get
his address and the next
morning he called me."
He became Anderson's
contact with the board by
writing over a dozen letters
to the former Illinois con
gressman and speaking with
him during numerous phone
calls.
While Richardson was
busy doing the correspon
dence work, Cole shared the
leadership of the board with
COP member Dick But
terfield. "There was a real
lack of continuity from pre
vious years and by showing
up each week I was able to
become a major force on the
board," Cole said.
"It's exciting that there is

a chance for freshmen who
have the energy or the drive
just to be able to go in and get
involved and feel that they
are a vital part of the ASSU,"
he commented
The board quickly found
that they faced many prob
lems in actually getting An
derson's negotiations
finalized â€” having troubles
with accreditation require
ments, housing and most im
portantly, funding.
Bergstrom sought out al
ternative funding sources to
help pay for Anderson, and
his successful venture came
in the form of the Dickinson
Symposium Fund, a panel
discussion series of four
parts, beginning April 13,
which will pay Anderson to
participate in its debate-lec
tures.
"The idea is to make An
derson as available as pos
sible to the largest number of
students and community."
Bergstrom said. He believes
that the board will succeed in
making Anderson sufficient
ly available to students
through his undergraduate
lecture class, his advanced
seminar, sherry hours and
speaking engagements.
The work of these
freshmen as well as the rest
of the 10-member board has
been praised by many famil
iar with them.
"This is one of the best
working, most inspiring
groups I have been fortunate
to work with in the ASSU,"
Butterfield said. "Their
energy is incredible, and
their willingness to follow
through with their objectives
is unique."
Butterfield has worked

alongside the younger board
members, "providing a per
spective look" as he de
scribes it. "Each one of the
board members has had an
incredible experience work
ing with the administration
as well as professors," he
said. "It's the type of educa
tional experience one can't
get in the classroom."
Two faculty members who
have been in contact with the
board are Professors David
Abernethy and David
Danelski of the Political Sci
ence Department.
Abernethy is chairman of the
Dickinson Symposium Com
mittee and chairman of the
Undergraduate Studies Com
mute and Danelski is An
derson's faculty sponsor.
"I'm very impressed with
the group and their pleasant
persistence," Abernethy
said. "They've gone out of
their way to get into the de
tails."
Echoing the same senti
ments, Danelski explained
that he too believed that An
derson's acceptance was the
result of the board's
' diligence and enthusiasm "I
know how hard they worked,
they deserve the credit." he
said.
However, the board's suc
cess in getting Anderson
almost never came about. In
fact some of the board mem
bers worried at the end of
last month that the entire
deal would fall through.
Communication between the
board and Anderson had bro
ken down over Christmas
break and the deadline for
Anderson to turn in a course
outline to the Political Sci
ence Department was fast

approaching
When the board found out
that Anderson was to be in
Pasadena to speak at Oc
cidental College in early
February, they arranged to
meet him at his hotel since
he did not have the time to
come to Stanford. But
terfield, Cole and Rich
ardson flew to Pasadena
Feb. 3 to make a 2 p.m. ap
pointment with Anderson at
his hotel.
The three then met with
Anderson in his room for
about two hours while he
worked out a rough outline of
his courses and wrote an of
ficial acceptance letter
"The whole time I was think
ing. T can't believe I'm sit
ting with John Anderson.' "
Richardson said
Currently the Political Sci
ence Department is working
on preparing the specifics of
Anderson's courses, such as
reading lists and room sched
uling. according to Danelski.
"I hope his lecture course
would be open to several hun
dred students," he said.
Abernethy explained that
the Political Science Depart
ment had approved An
derson's courses in principle
"but we still need to work on
the syllabus."
According to board mem
bers. their job would only be
halfway over when the Polit
ical Science Department of
ficially accredits Anderson's
course. They say they will
still have much to do after
Anderson comes next quar
ter.
"Everyone in the ASSU
can learn from the board,"
Butterfield said. "They are
building professionalism "
