## Bluegrass festival is a short-sighted mistake 
### 
The ASSU Senate, long re
garded by students at large as a
body of aspiring politicos who
seek only a nice credential for
their resumes, is jeopardizing
whatever legitimacy and
credibility it has in an effort to
produce the annual bluegrass
festival and thus prove its prod
uctivity to the Stanford com
munity.
Last Wednesday, the Senate
approved student involvement
in the production of the blue
grass festival. The body had
previously specified students
would be limited to only ob
servation in the outdoor concert
production Since the original
order was not rescinded, the two
directions stand in contradic
tion. How is a student working
on the concert to know whether
to observe or participate in pro
duction plans? And how can he
explain the contradictory or
ders to the University officials
he must deal with to stage the
show, let alone to negotiators
outside the University in the en
tertainment industry? I'm glad
I'm not stuck in that tight spot
between a rock and a hard
. place.
The Senate further con
tradicted itself by placing COP
member Dayna Goldfine in a
leadership role in the bluegrass
festival project. Goldfine heads
up the ASSU Task Force on Con

temporary Entertainment,
which is now studying the
feasibility of a new ASSU
project for student-produced
concerts. The Task Force was
directed not to involve itself in
the bluegrass festival produc
tion because any participation
would prematurely imply that
concerts are feasible and would
undermine the task force
charge to determine financial
feasibility before establishing a
new ASSU project. Goldfine will
have to work with the very peo
ple she has interviewed to de
termine a concert-producing
project's likelihood of success.
No doubt, those people will as
sume that she has deemed con
certs a reasonable pursuit of the
ASSU. What if she is unable to
meet deadlines or demands the
industry mandates? What is to
come of the Tast Force on Con
temporary Entertainment if its
organizer is consumed with pro
ducing one concert this spring?
The Task Force was estab
lished after the Senate
abolished ASSU Special Events
last fall. Special Events con
sistently lost money in the 10
years of its existence. The
losses were rendered unaccep
table when Special Events went
$92,000 in the red last year. Stud
ies show the losses were largely
a result of short lead time
before the concert date. Gold

fine has two months to get this
show on the road. Special
Events always had longer than
that.
This year's Senate has estab
lished a fine internal structure
to expedite external ac
complishments by future Sen
ates. Unfortunately, the effort
that went into laying the founda
tion for productivity is not im
mediately visible to the student
body. It is frustrating to serve
on a body that is in a state of
transition and requires a new
framework before it can ad
dress problems that students
face, like the housing draw and
the function of Tresidder as a
student union.
This year's Senate, concerned
with service to students, has set
out a nearly impossible task in
aiming to arrange a major con
cert in two months — by the
target date of May 12. Senators
feared that forfeiting produc
tion this year may lead to the
loss of the ASSU franchise on
campus concerts and thus the
loss of a learning experience for
students and entertainment for
the Stanford community.
What the Senate has chosen to
ignore is the University
moratorium on concerts until
the Task Force on Contem
porary Entertainment has de
termined whether students can
run a concert-producing agent.

Senators have also overlooked
the easy access to entertain
ment at off-campus locations as
nearby as Keystone Palo Alto on
California Avenue.
The decision to go ahead with
the bluegrass festival was a
well-intended effort to produce
visible results for the student
body. Sadly, the concert can
only have negative effects. If is
is unsuccessful, ASSU will lose
any credibility it had in the en
tertainment industry and may
well destroy, the future of stu
dent-run campus entertainment
endeavors.
Success of the festival re
quires long, hard hours of work
by those who would otherwise
devote their efforts toward the
establishment of a new contem
porary entertainment project.
Members of the task force will
be extremely concerned with
the success of the festival, since
its failure would demonstrate
the infeasibility of student-pro
duced concerts. If attention to
the project itself is deferred un
til mid-May, after the bluegrass
festival has been staged, there
will not be enough time for the
task force to get a successor to
Special Events off the ground

this year.
All this anxiety is a result of
about 500 surveys students com
pleted in the fall, which in
dicated students want concerts
on campus. With 12,000 students
attending this school. I wonder
how indicative a sampling of 500
is? And I am certain those stu
dents who want to see concerts
are seeing them.
Six of the seven ASSU leaders
with the most expertise in con
cert production — three COP
members, the student financial
manager, the Senate finance
committee chair and the Senate
chair — are adamantly against
the bluegrass festival. Is the
Senate going on the judgement
of one COP member who may
well be too close to the issue to
make a rational assessment?
It would be better to forego
one on-campus concert this
spring in favor of establishing
an ongoing mechanism for the
future. But as consumed with
the immediate present as the
ASSU Senate apparently is.

happen.

This year's Senate has estab
lished a fine internal structure
to expedite external ac
complishments by future Sen
ates. Unfortunately, the effort
that went into laying the founda
tion for productivity is not im
mediately visible to the student
body. It is frustrating to serve
on a body that is in a state of
transition and requires a new
framework before it can ad
dress problems that students
face, like the housing draw and
the function of Tresidder as a
student union.
This year's Senate, concerned
with service to students, has set
out a nearly impossible task in
aiming to arrange a major con
cert in two months — by the
target date of May 12. Senators
feared that forfeiting produc
tion this year may lead to the
loss of the ASSU franchise on
campus concerts and thus the
loss of a learning experience for
students and entertainment for
the Stanford community.
What the Senate has chosen to
ignore is the University
moratorium on concerts until
the Task Force on Contem
porary Entertainment has de
termined whether students can
run a concert-producing agent.

Senators have also overlooked
the easy access to entertain
ment at off-campus locations as
nearby as Keystone Palo Alto on
California Avenue.
The decision to go ahead with
the bluegrass festival was a
well-intended effort to produce
visible results for the student
body. Sadly, the concert can
only have negative effects. If is
is unsuccessful, ASSU will lose
any credibility it had in the en
tertainment industry and may
well destroy, the future of stu
dent-run campus entertainment
endeavors.
Success of the festival re
quires long, hard hours of work
by those who would otherwise
devote their efforts toward the
establishment of a new contem
porary entertainment project.
Members of the task force will
be extremely concerned with
the success of the festival, since
its failure would demonstrate
the infeasibility of student-pro
duced concerts. If attention to
the project itself is deferred un
til mid-May, after the bluegrass
festival has been staged, there
will not be enough time for the
task force to get a successor to
Special Events off the ground

this year.
All this anxiety is a result of
about 500 surveys students com
pleted in the fall, which in
dicated students want concerts
on campus. With 12,000 students
attending this school. I wonder
how indicative a sampling of 500
is? And I am certain those stu
dents who want to see concerts
are seeing them.
Six of the seven ASSU leaders
with the most expertise in con
cert production — three COP
members, the student financial
manager, the Senate finance
committee chair and the Senate
chair — are adamantly against
the bluegrass festival. Is the
Senate going on the judgement
of one COP member who may
well be too close to the issue to
make a rational assessment?
It would be better to forego
one on-campus concert this
spring in favor of establishing
an ongoing mechanism for the
future. But as consumed with
the immediate present as the
ASSU Senate apparently is.
that's not the way it's going to
happen.
(Sue (Inldfarb is a senior major
ing in communication and Eng
lish. She is an ASSU Senator.)
The ASSU Senate, long re
garded by students at large as a
body of aspiring politicos who
seek only a nice credential for
their resumes, is jeopardizing
whatever legitimacy and
credibility it has in an effort to
produce the annual bluegrass
festival and thus prove its prod
uctivity to the Stanford com
munity.
Last Wednesday, the Senate
approved student involvement
in the production of the blue
grass festival. The body had
previously specified students
would be limited to only ob
servation in the outdoor concert
production Since the original
order was not rescinded, the two
directions stand in contradic
tion. How is a student working
on the concert to know whether
to observe or participate in pro
duction plans? And how can he
explain the contradictory or
ders to the University officials
he must deal with to stage the
show, let alone to negotiators
outside the University in the en
tertainment industry? I'm glad
I'm not stuck in that tight spot
between a rock and a hard
. place.
The Senate further con
tradicted itself by placing COP
member Dayna Goldfine in a
leadership role in the bluegrass
festival project. Goldfine heads
up the ASSU Task Force on Con

temporary Entertainment,
which is now studying the
feasibility of a new ASSU
project for student-produced
concerts. The Task Force was
directed not to involve itself in
the bluegrass festival produc
tion because any participation
would prematurely imply that
concerts are feasible and would
undermine the task force
charge to determine financial
feasibility before establishing a
new ASSU project. Goldfine will
have to work with the very peo
ple she has interviewed to de
termine a concert-producing
project's likelihood of success.
No doubt, those people will as
sume that she has deemed con
certs a reasonable pursuit of the
ASSU. What if she is unable to
meet deadlines or demands the
industry mandates? What is to
come of the Tast Force on Con
temporary Entertainment if its
organizer is consumed with pro
ducing one concert this spring?
The Task Force was estab
lished after the Senate
abolished ASSU Special Events
last fall. Special Events con
sistently lost money in the 10
years of its existence. The
losses were rendered unaccep
table when Special Events went
$92,000 in the red last year. Stud
ies show the losses were largely
a result of short lead time
before the concert date. Gold

fine has two months to get this
show on the road. Special
Events always had longer than
that.
