No intellect
Thank heavens someone dis
played enough fortitude to ex
pose the appalling paucity of in
tellectual discourse at Stanford.
I refer, of course, to R.B.
Lynch's splendid essay, "Curse
of being an intellectual here"
(Daily, Feb. 11). I most certain
ly concur with Lynch when he
asserts that there is a dearth of
truly engaging conversation to
be found at Stanford.
In my extensive travels I have
observed that at the great learn
ing centers of the world (e.g.
Oxford, the Sorbonne, Foothill),
one can sense a certain je ne sais
quoi. The aura is one of, how do
you say, pretentiousness? It tru
ly pains me to realize that the
same cannot be said of Stanford.
Why, just the other evening
during dinner, I simply could
not find a single soul who was
willing, nay, even capable of,
discussing the role of the
croissant in the French Revolu
tion I would venture to guess
that the whole meal would have
centered upon my efforts to ex
tract a glint of worthwhile con
versation from the horde of nat
tering nitwits which surrounded
me, were it not for the solace of
a rather exceptional bottle of
cabernet sauvignon (Robert
Mondavi, 1974), which enabled
me to shrug off the futility of my
situation and, subsequently,
vomit. If you can name the
Ibsen play which had a scene
similar to the one I just re
counted. contact me for a
Mensa Club application.
I am compelled to ask if it is
not patently absurd that at a uni
versity such as ours the vast
majority of students concern
themselves with such mundane
matters as jobs? The mere
thought of it causes me to emit a
rueful chuckle even as I type.
They are just so, how do you say,
practical?

Prof's incredible
It is not true that old fart
alumni do nothing but sit on
tailgates, drink highballs, and
wear red feathers in their hair.
We also watch TV. And boy, did
I see a good'n on the tube last

Monday night: ABC's That's In
credible, with special guest star
Philip G. Zimbardo.
I'd be hard pressed to think of
an act that I've enjoyed more
than the one Zimbo put on for
the nice folks at That's In
credible. To my mind, his
"Stanford Prison Follies" was
every bit as good as Larry
Hagman's Dallas. (The key
question here is not "Who shot
JR?", but "How much did they
pay Phillip G?") Cripes, the guy
even beat out Fifi the flying dog
— a segment shown earlier in
the show — and that was a tough
act to follow.
Zimbo's clearly hit on a good
idea here, and I, for one, think
he should follow up on it. Who
needs the small time exposure
from Psych 1 classes in Dink
Aud when you can really make it
big with a show on network TV?
Call the show Some Social Psy
chologists are Real Incredible
and wow em each week with a
different experiment. When
those run dry (Paul Simon must
have had Zimbardo in mind
when he wrote "One Trick
Pony"), invite guest stars to fill
in the void. Get B.F. Skinner to
bring his trained pigeons; have
Milgram jolt viewers with his
trusty dry cells; maybe even in
vite Bandura to give karate les
sons (I understand TV is a good
medium for that sort of thing).
Jeez, the possibilities are end
less!
Well, I gotta go and pick up a
couple of hip flasks for next foot
ball season, but I just wanna say
one last thing. Zimbo's ap
pearance on That's Incredible
makes me one proud alumni. I
mean, after all, you don't see
Harvard professors on shows
like that.

David Miller's response (Dai
ly, Feb. 12) to my column (Dai
ly, Feb. 2) made some valid
points concerning American re
sponsibilities in relation to the
preservation and promulgation
of liberty. It is unfortunate,
however, that he succumbed to
the common malaise of selec

tive misinterpretation when
criticizing the points I was at
tempting to make.
Miller chooses to portray me
as a puerile would-be John
Wayne with visions of defending
God and Country against im
moral hordes of communists.
The subtlety of that portrayal is
enough to invalidate the rest of
his column as it is, but he makes
several fatuous statements
which complete the task. I refer
to his declaration that no for
eign power can threaten Ameri
can freedom, and his belief that
government encroachment
upon our civil liberties is our
most pressing problem (his per
ception of government seems to
be as fraught with hysteria as
my own supposed fear of Com
mies — or "foreign bogeymen,"
to use Miller's phrase).
The central point which I
tried to make in my column
(and which was unclear to
Miller through a combination of
my bad writing and his bad
reading) was that a threat to
freedom in any part of the world
is our responsibility to some ex
tent. Simply setting a good ex
ample is not going to be enough.
The real defense of freedom is
not a merely "domestic affair"
because the modern world
leaves no room for isolationism.
Finally, while Miller seemed
to delight in calling me a "boy
playing soldier," he should re
alize that his name-calling
merely served to detract from
his credibility by marring what
would otherwise have been a
cogently written column. I look
forward to reading his views
without the accompanying at
tempts at derision which
masked the essential veracity of
his column of Feb. 12.

No second term
Margaret Thatcher, follow
ing the economic advice of
Adam Smith and Milton Fried
man, is now on Madame
Tussard's "most hated'' list.
Only if the Labor Party nomi
nates Adolf Hitler is she likely
to win a second term.
Let us hope that our new pres
ident understands this message.
