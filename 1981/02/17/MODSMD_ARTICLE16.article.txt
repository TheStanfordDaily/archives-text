The current national mood of
optimism reminds me of the pe
riod following President John
Kennedy's victory 20 years ago.
At the beginning of the Kennedy
administration, the nation was
confident that we could make
further progress even after
eight years of President Dwight
Eisenhower's excellent leader
ship and good government. Na
tional leaders were respected
then and our institutions of gov
ernment were serving us well.
We were brimming over with
idealism. "Ask not what your
country can do for you; ask what
you can do for your country,"
was the charismatic Kennedy
challenge to the nation.
Proud of their president and

eager to serve were thousands
of American youths. Kennedy
not only excited the young, but
had advocated during the cam
paign and created in his first
year of office a program for ser
vice abroad - the Peace Corps.
The objective of the Peace
Corps is to provide a framework
for Americans, young and old,
to serve the needs of peoples in
the poorer countries with per
sonal skills at the local levels.
There was such great admira
tion throughout the world for the
new president as a world states
man that leaders of Third World
countries requested thousands
more volunteers than the United
States could provide in the first
year of the program. The United
States and the president were
held in such high esteem that
foreigners wanted these "young
Kennedys" (as the volunteers
were called) to come and help
them with their problems
U.S. prestige was high then
throughout the "Third World"
for many reasons, but principal
ly because we helped so many
colonies become independent
nations by putting U.S. power
behind the right of peoples for
self-determination.
The creation of the Peace
Corps was greeted in the U.S. as
confirmation that Kennedy had
rare qualities of leadership. The
idea gained immediate bi-parti
san support and Americans,
young and old, deluged the head
quarters in Washington with let
ters volunteering for service
even before the program was of
ficially launched and printed ap
plication forms were available.
The Peace Corps volunteer
works on the local level. In most
cases, he or she lives in small
villages or rural areas under the
same conditions as the natives
with whom they work or help.
They speak the language and
shop for and eat the same local
foods. In addition to the techni
cal skills provided, volunteers
share their idealism, values and
concern for developing foreign
peoples. Volunteers are paid a
living allowance, very modest
spending money and a small
monthly amount deposited back

in the United States for use
when they return.
Today, the Peace Corps con
tinues to provide developing
countries with enthusiastic, ide
alistic Americans. True, they
are fewer now - some 6000 volun
teers serve in 59 developing
countries of Latin America,
Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.
Is the Peace Corps worth the
expense? Although the cost per
volunteer is high, we get a lot for
our money.
First, fifty-nine countries are
thankful that we could send vol
unteers to help them develop a
better life. They are providing
skills and a better under
standing of Americans and our
value system.
Second, the volunteers are
given an opportunity to serve
their country and to personally
develop skills and gain valuable
experience.
Third, and possibly most im
portant, our country gains a res
ervoir of talented young people
who have an excellent under
standing of how most of the peo
ple live in the world. They be
come fluent in exotic languages
and have a good knowledge of
foreign areas. These skills are a
national resource which is serv
ing our nation well.
Over ten percent of Ameri
cans serving in our foreign aid
program are former Peace
Corps volunteers. Some volun
teers go into international busi
nesses. Many are joining the
growing ranks of private agen
cies, such as CARE, which do
relief and development work ov
erseas.
Those volunteers who return
to their communities to work
and share their Peace Corps ex
periences with their neighbors
are making us aware of the fact
that one billion people in the
Third World live at the very
edge of existence.
