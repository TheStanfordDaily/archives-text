## Japan auto import quotas not the answer 
### 
Japan's unique stability and
constancy of purpose have
raised that country to the most
advanced ranks of the in
dustrialized world. It is not sur
prising, however, that Japan's
remarkable economic growth
has been accompanied by fric
tions with other industrial
powers, including the United
States. In recent years, Japan's
large trade surpluses and the
continued difficulty of access to
the Japanese market have been
of particular concern, creating
protectionist pressures in both
the United States and Europe.
The close interdepenence of
the U.S. and Japanese econo
mies makes certain problems
inevitable. What is essential is
that both countries learn to
manage these problems in ways
that do not damage our overall
relationship. At this time of
mounting international turmoil
and instability, our differences
on trade must not be allowed to
disrupt our vital alliance.
The most serious strains at
the present time center around
the question of automobile im
ports, an issue that will in
evitably affect other aspects of
the U.S.-Japan security rela
tionship if not kept under con
trol. That is why it is particular
ly important for the United
States and Japan to move now to
come to terms on this matter.
With Chrysler on the brink of
collapse and Ford threatening
to follow, sentiment has grown
rapidly in Congress and the ad
ministration to restrict the en
try of Japanese auto imports.
Now that the three major Amer
ican automakers have reported
losses of more than $4 billion in
1980, Senators John Danforth
(R-Mo.) and Lloyd Bentsen (D-
Tex ), the chairman and rank
ing minority member on the
Senate trade subcommittee,
have introduced legislation that
would set annual quotas of 1.6
million automobiles over the
next three years.

Any such attempt to impose
formal import quotas at this
time would be an unwise and
short-sighted step. A quota
would drive up prices on Ameri
can-made cars, thereby fueling
inflation and promoting greater
inefficiency within the domestic
industry. In addition, it could
evoke a protectionist response
from Japan, with the risk of set
ting off an international trade
war.
Although we should not per
manently rule out the option of
mandatory restrictions, we
should first seek to acheive an
agreement with the Japanese on
voluntary export restraint and
increased "local content" re
quirements. It is regrettable
that an understanding on these
matters has not already been
reached. France and Great
Britain have been able to work
out agreements with the
Japanese on automobile ex
ports, and it is time that the
United States acheived a simi
lar understanding.
We should also strongly en
courage Japanese automakers
and auto parts manufacturers to
locate more of their plants in the
United States. Japanese invest
ment in the U.S. brings jobs to
American workers and main
tains competition and real
choice for American con
sumers. We should urge the
Japanese government to con
tinue its efforts to promote
greater investment in the U.S.,
including the sponsorship of ad
ditional government/business
missions to the United States to
explore investment op
portunities for the Japanese au
tomobile and auto parts in
dustries.
Furthermore, the United
States should seek the continued
reduction of Japanese import
barriers to American auto
sales . Japan has already taken a
number of significant steps in
this regard Japan has removed
the tariffs on foreign-made

chassis and other car parts; it
has been improving and sim
plifying its standards and in
spection procedures; and it has
dispatched two trade missions
to the United States to promote
Japanese purchases of Ameri
can auto parts. While these de
velopments are encouraging, it
is imperative that we make
even further progress in the
area.
The steps outlined above will
be essential to preserve the
American auto industry during
its transition to smaller, fuel ef
ficient cars. At the same time,
by avoiding mandatory import
quotas, we would preclude any
serious deterioration of U.S. -
Japan trade relations. Both of
these results will be of great
benefit to our overall rela

tionship with Japan.
At a time of serious global
challenges to our security, the
U.S. - Japanese relationship is
of extremely high importance.
Despite the problems that exist,
the centrality and basic
strength of our alliance remain
fundamentally unchanged. Al
though our closely intertwined
economies will make dif
ferences unavoidable, de
termined efforts on both sides
can assure that such differences
do not undermine the basic rela
tionship of frienship, close coop
eration, and mutual benefit that
has been so productive for both
nations and for the cause of
world peace.
