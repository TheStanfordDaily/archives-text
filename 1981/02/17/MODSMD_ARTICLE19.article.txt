# British colony of Belize sets out alone in '80s
## 
### Washington Post 
Belize City, Belize — George
Price, 62, the premier of the
British colony of Belize and
almost certain to be its first
prime minister when it becomes
a sovereign nation, is known as
an educated, piously Catholic,
politically astute and sensitive
man with a fierce dream: inde
pendence.
Talking at a recent rally
about his plans to make that
dream a reality this year, he cut
loose on his opposition — those
Belizeans who are at least reluc
tant to leave Britain's protec
tive shadow.
These opponents of Price talk
about the security risk from
hostile Guatemala, about eco
nomic uncertainties, about all
that can go wrong for a small
land colonized by British sailors
that sets out on its own in the
tough world of the 1980s.

"These are the things," said
Price, laying it on the line about
such doubts to a hundred people
in the muddy bus depot called
Cinderella Plaza, "that the dev
ils are putting in the way."
"We ready, man," shouted an
enthusiastic supporter. "We
ready long time, daddy."
His supporters don't hesitate
to think of him as the father of
his country. His opponents are
profoundly suspicious.
"You might have noticed his
religious aura," Manuel Es
quivel, an articulate and
acerbic senator for the opposi
tion United Democratic Party,
said of Price the next morning.
"He's straight out of the inquisi
tion and believes in the maxim
that error has no rights. Since
we oppose him we are in error
and must be in league with the
Devil."
Price's Peoples United Party

has brought forth a draft con
stitution, known as the White
Paper, for an independent
Belize. "To my mind," said Es
quivel, "it lays the groundwork
for a dictatorship."
Harsh words are common on
all sides these days in this near
nation beset by a plague of what
one longtime American resident
calls "village politics, the petti
ness where everybody knows
everybody and their foibles."
From the beginnings of seri
ous local politics in 1950, Price
was what one of his colleagues
called "a silent partner at the
top: the man behind the
throne." But employed as the
secretary of Belize's only mil
lionaire, he preferred to keep a
low profile, this colleague said.
He suffered a political set
back later in the decade when he
was accused of making secret
initiatives to Guatemala, but by
1961 he was back publicly and
firmly in charge of his party.
With the start of internal self
rule in 1964, Price became
Belize's first and thus far the
only premier.
Even his detractors concede

some of Price's accomplish
ments. Literacy is virtually uni
versal because of a system of
church-state schools that Price
helped create.
In the last colony-wide elec
tion in 1979 his party won 13 of
the 18 seats in the National As
sembly. The opposition charges
that the electoral machinery is
in the hands of Price's party
and, without proof, that the
elections are fraudulent.
Price's control is already sol
id, but the opposition argues
that it would be even stronger
under the proposed constitution.
The opposition has refused to
participate in what was sup
posed to be a joint committee
canvassing the nation for com
ment on the White Paper, and
some opposition leaders suggest
they will not attend the constitu
tional conference in London ex
pected this spring.
Frustrated and defeated, the
United Democratic Party is in
creasingly on the outside of gov
ernment and the substantial mi
nority it represents is left with
less voice .
Meanwhile, notwithstanding

ambitious plans, much of the co
lony languishes
Price has constructed a new
capital in the interior,
Belmopan, which has a popu
lation of about 4000 and looks
more like a modern American
junior college than a seat of gov
ernment, but which is clean and
quiet and has helped open up the
middle reaches of Belize
The poverty and dilapidation
of Belize City — with a third of
the colony's 145,000 population
and its principal port — are ap
parent to any visitor.
Seven years after a sewer sys
tem was begun, it has yet to be
completed. Most people get
their water from rain barrels,
and when the sea breeze dies the
stench from the gutters is stun
ning. Power cuts are recurrent.
With its small population and
limited resources. Belize has
virtually no infrastructure for
any kind of commercial activi
ty. Its potential farmlands are
vast. The Price government
talks of making Belize the
breadbasket of the Caribbean,
but for now 25 percent of its im
ports are foodstuffs.
