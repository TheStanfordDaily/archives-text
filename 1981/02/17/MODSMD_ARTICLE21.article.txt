Los Angeles (AP) — The
United States' rapidly growing
reserves of gasoline are so great
that refineries may be forced to
slow down or shut down and gas
prices eventually may drop, an
oil industry analyst says.
Dan Lundberg said oil-pro
duction runs at refineries are at
"uneconomic rates" and gaso
line stockpiles, fast ap
proaching a record-breaking in
ventory, are so great that "the
industry may have to drink it."
But his "Lundberg Letter," a
weekly oil industry periodical,
stressed that "regardless of
surpluses, certain increased
costs must get through to the
pump, so a decline in prices is
not a reasonable prospect at this
time."
The letter said consumer con
servation of gasoline and con
tinued production of fuel oil for
winter heating were combining
to create stocks of 277 million
barrels of gas at refineries, in
pipelines and at large terminals
throughout the country.
Another oil industry publica
tion official said Sunday that the
nation has begun to control its
consumption of petroleum prod
ucts and could be on the way to
easing the energy problem

"without fully realizing it."
German Chacin, editor of the
"Energy Detente" newsletter,
said the U.S. economy has im
proved its energy efficiency 12
percent since the Arab oil em
bargo of 1973. He said that trans
lates into a savings of 4.9 million
barrels of oil a day.
"Since the petroleum price
increases of 1973-74, conserva
tion . . . has entered the scene
with a vigor that many wouldn't
have thought possible back in
the 1960s and early '705," Chacin
said.
"Energy Detente" is a bil
ingual, twice-monthly publica
tion that studies the energy situ
ation in the Western Hemi
sphere.
The "Lundberg Letter," pub
lished Friday, said refinery pro
duction runs dropped to 72.7 per
cent of capacity in January
from an already low 76.6 per
cent in December. Refiners,
who generally like to run at
about 90 percent capacity, are
faced with "even greater
slowdowns, perhaps shut
downs," the letter said.
Industry experts say produc
tion runs of less than 75 percent
aren't profitable for most re
fineries.
