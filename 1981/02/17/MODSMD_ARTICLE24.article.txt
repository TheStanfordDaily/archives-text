New York (AP) — Two law
yers said they met for 90
minutes in Los Angeles yester
day with missing boxing pro
moter Harold Smith and said he
was innocent in connection with
an alleged $21.3 embezzlement
from a Wells Fargo bank in Cali
fornia.
According to stories in to
day's editions of both the New
York Daily News and The New
York Times, one of the lawyers,
Robert Rains of Cleveland, said
that Smith has done nothing "il
legal. improper or immoral."
The News quoted Rains and
Albert Sheppard of Los Angeles
as saying that Smith might not
surface publicly for a week or
two. They said Smith had re
tained them to represent him in
a lawsuit filed by Wells Fargo

naming him as a defendant in
the alleged embezzlement.
Smith, chairman of Muham
mad Ali Professional Sports
Inc., has been missing for three
weeks, although he reportedly
has made phone calls to as
sociates and newsmen describ
ing a bizarre flight from
gunmen and an alleged kidnap
ing of his young son.
Smith was to have promoted a
major boxing card at New
York's Madison Square Garden
on Feb. 23, including three
championship bouts. The show
has since been canceled.
Meanwhile, Wells Fargo,
which has already suspended
one branch manager in connec
tion with the embezzlement
suit, relieved the Hollywood
branch manager of his duties

while it probes $3.5 million in
loans approved there, a bank
spokesman said.
According to the News,
Smith, through his lawyers,
claimed that every month
amounts ranging from $550,000
to $995,000 were funneled
through one of his bank ac
counts, Harold J. Smith Produc
tions, without his knowledge.
They said the money never
showed up on bank statements
and said Smith was making a
routine check on his balances
when it was disclosed that $21.3
million was funneled through
his account that way.
"It is obviously a computer
crime that must involve the
very highest officials of Wells
Fargo," Sheppard said.
