# Bruins drown Cardinals
## 
### David Siminoff 
The clouds that enveloped deGuerre Swim
ming Complex Friday were forebodingly ar
rayed in the shape of the letters U-C-L-A. Aside
from a few select instances when the sun pene
trated and a Stanford swimmer shined, the
clouds were omnipresent for the Cardinals.
UCLA, sporting six Olympians including
1976 Gold Medalist Brian Goodell, drowned
Stanford in a tide of talent, 72-41. Stanford
coach Skip Kenney felt that "this UCLA squad
is probably the best dual meet team in his
tory."
The composition of UCLA's cloud included
Goodell, Bill Barrett, current world record
holder in the 200 meter Individual Medley and
200 yard Breastroke, and Steve Barnicoat, win
ner of the 1980 mock Olympic trials in the 200
Backstroke.
The clouds did part from time to time; in one
instance Stanford swept the 200 Fly with
freshman Cardinal Mark Mitchell coming out
on top in 1:50.2. John Walton, also a freshman,
turned in the first victory of his career in the
200 Breast in 2:08.4. Wade Flemons, a member
of the Canadian Olympic team and one of Stan

ford's inspirational leaders, set a pool record
of 1:49.2 in the 200 Backstroke, coupled with a
superb 50.5 effort in the 100 Back to lead off the
Medley Relay.
While the swimming magic that prevailed
against favored USC last week was con
spicuously absent, Kenney said that the Cards
are "on the right track. We are picked to finish
eighth or ninth at NCAA's but our team goal is
to finish sixth or better. I think we will make
it."
When the first and second ranked swimmers
in the country go against each other in the
same event, lightening strikes. Such was the
case Friday when Stanford's Bari Weik duelled
with Goodell in the 1000 and 500 freestyles.
Though Weik lost both races, he feels that
when the NCAA's roll around, he and Goodell
will race again.
The Stanford divers fared no better than
their swimming counterparts. Coach Rick
Shavone best summed up the Cardinal effort
when he said, "Our guys did their best. What
more can you ask of a diver or swimmer?" If
the Cardaquamen reflect the same positive at
titude that the coaching staff has, the sun can't
help but shine on them at the NCAA's.
