### Chris Haft 
Two frequently-asked questions regarding Dick Dißiaso's
job security have been: should he be fired? and will he be
fired? The second query was put to rest Saturday, when the
40-year-old head coach of the men's basketball team received
a two-year extension of his contract from Athletic Director
Andy Geiger.
"I think things have been going well enough to make the de
cision that way," Geiger stated yesterday in a telephone in
terview from Moscow, Idaho, where the Stanford contingent
stayed before last night's game against Washington State
Geiger cited the sound performances of this year's four
freshmen — Keith Jones, Roger Lemons, John Revelli and
Hans Wichary — as a reason for retaining Dißiaso.
"The team has played reasonably well in the second half of
the season," Geiger added.
As for the timing of the decision, the athletic director ac
knowledged that announcing Dißiaso's contract extension
now will prevent disorganization from entering this year's
all-important recruiting process. It will also end the debate in
the press and among fans concerning Dißiaso's status
"I did not want . continued speculation," Geiger said
Geiger apparently expects Dißiaso to attract another tal
ented group of high school seniors to Stanford It's no secret
that the Cardinals covet 6-foot-BV 2 forward Johnny Rogers of
Fountain Valley's La Quinta High School, and the Peninsula
Times Tribune reported yesterday that 7-foot-2 Ewe Blab of
Effingham, Illinois, is also on Dißiaso's list.
"I'm impressed with the people we're recruiting," Geiger
said. "We need to win some of those recruiting battles, and
we're trying to make sure we're as strong as possible in meet
ing those challenges."


Dick Dißiaso will remain at Stanford for at least two more years
His career record before this weekend's contests was 61-93.
