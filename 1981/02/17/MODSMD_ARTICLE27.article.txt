# Cards emerge from weekend 9-1

### Ralph Walker 
The Stanford baseball team
entered last weekend's play
with a 6-0 record and a N0.5 na
tional ranking. They came out
four games later with a 9-1 mark
after winning a three game
series against the University of
San Francisco, and a 7-2 de
cision over UC-Santa Clara.
Stanford posted an im
pressive 13-2 victory against
USF Saturday. Card pitchers
Brian Mignano and Gregg
Lomickey teamed up for a six
hitter, with neither of the
hurlers allowing an earned run.
The two pitchers were over
shadowed however by the Card

hitters, who turned Sunken
Diamond into a popcorn popper.
Trailing by one run in the third,
shortstop Steve Buechelle tied
the game with his first home run
of the year. Next up was Phil
Wilson, who promptly con
nected on a 2-1 pitch and sent it
flying over the centerfield wall.
First baseman Loring Davies
gave the ballboys another to re
trieve by ripping a 3-2 pitch over
the left-centerfield wall. Then
designated hitter Bob Hauslade
succumbed to peer pressure and
hit Stanford's fourth round trip
per of the inning.
The Red Machine was dor
mant until the fifth, when

sophomore Eric Hardgrave hit
a three run tater, the fifth of the
day.
the Bible tells us that the
Lord rested on the seventh day
after creating the Heavens and
earth. Stanford apparently
began the first half of Sunday's
twin bill vs. the Dons in similar
spirit. They took a game off and
were subsequently handed their
first loss of the season, 8-3.
"The bad thing about the loss
was that we gave it away," said
coach Mark Marquess. "They
got four runs on only one hit, and
we made three errors. I'm ob
viously unhappy with that."
The Cards resumed their

characteristic manner of play in
the nightcap, beating the Dons
7-2. Stanford took a one run lead
in the second when Daryl Ste-.
phens smacked a high fastball
over the fence. Bill Worden hit a
two run triple and Mike Tooth-*
man added his third homer of
the season in the fourth.
Paul Grame, Stephens, and
Worden led Stanford to its ninth
victory Monday at Santa Clara.
Grame, who had not allowed a
single run in 20 previous innings,
had his streak broken when San
ta Clara scored in the fourth. He
went on to pitch seven innings,
rendering only two runs and
notching his fourth victory.
