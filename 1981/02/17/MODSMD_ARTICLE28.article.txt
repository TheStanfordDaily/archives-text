the top five on the strength of

Among Stanford's highlights
were Lee's fifth-place finish in
floor (9.10) and in all-around
with 54.10 points, a personal

Hamada. He also tied with
Nelson for fourth on high bar

their second highest mark of the

everyone is improving," Walker
said. "Julie (Bledsoe) had her
