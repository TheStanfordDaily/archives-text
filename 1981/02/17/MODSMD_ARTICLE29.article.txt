## 
### Bill Beyda 
The Stanford women's
basketball team had a rough
weekend, losing to the Oregon
Ducks 97-62 Friday night, and to
the Oregon State Beavers Satur
day night, 78-53. The losses bury
Cardinal hopes of post season
play.
Oregon shot an amazing 60
percent from the field, and Stan
ford shot a very respectable 50
percent. Any other night, 50 per
cent would have been enough,
but not against the no. 16 Ducks.
"We played very well both de
fensively and offensively, may
be even to our maximum poten
tial," assistant coach Mike
Kehoe said, "The other teams

were just very hyped up."
"Also, we had two very bad
officials." he continued. " We
had them two nights in a row,
which is almost unheard of."
There were many bright
lights for the Cardinals this
weekend. Louise Smith scored
20 points and rebounded nine,
and Kim Kupferer scored 12 and
rebounded eight against Oregon
State. Smith scored 22 and Kup
ferer scored 17 against Oregon.
Kehoe also cited Leigh
Pederson and Denise McGuire
for their outstanding play.
The Cards' future is op
timistic. with Kathy Murphy the
only departing senior, and the
return of last year's leading

scorer and rebounder, Jeanne
Ruark (now Jeanne Ruark
Hoff). "This has been a transi
tion year," head coach Dotty
McCrea said. " We're building
on a solid base, and looking for
ward to next year." McCrea dis
cusses the team's future in
depth in Thursday's Cardinals
Today.
The Cards overall record is
now 13-14. Their conference rec
ord remains 3-5 as these were
not NorCal Conference games.
The Cards play first place Cali
fornia tonight at Berkeley, and
return to Maples Pavilion Feb
ruary 24 to play University of
San Francisco at 7:30 PM.
