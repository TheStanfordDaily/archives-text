# Student loan cheaters face rigid new crackdown
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — i he .justice Department begun a
broad new crackdown on student-loan defaults yes
terday with the filing of 501 lawsuits in three Ohio
cities to recover more than $660,000 in defaulted fed
eral loans.
The suits are being filed in U.S. District Courts in
Columbus. Dayton and Cincinnati by U.S. Attorney
James Cissell. who says he is "alarmed" at the
number of defaulted student loans across the coun
try, and especially in the southern district of Ohio.
He said the amount in default in the National
Direct Student Loan Program administered by col
leges in the southern district of Ohio was $23.6 mil
lion. 76 percent more than the $13.4 million taken in
all the bank robberies in the country in 1978
"The average loan in default in this district for
this one program was $947, which exceeded by $421
the average amount taken by burglars." Cissell
said. "Nationally, the amount in default for this sin
gle student-loan program was $732 million, an
amount more than four times greater than all rob
beries in the nation in 1978."
Monday's suit to recover $663,868 46 in defaulted
student loans marks the second time in the last two
years that Cissell has cracked down on student-loan
defaulters. The new suit brings to court more than
three times the number of defaulters involved in the

first suit and spotlights a trend in the Justice De
part merit, which is Mending out tho that
holders of federal student loans can now expect to be
sued if they default.
U.S. attorneys in Detroit, Cleveland and Milwau
kee are cracking down on student-loan defaults with
the same aggressiveness that Cissell's Cincinnati
office is. The U.S. attorney in Cleveland is giving the
names of alleged student-loan defaulters to local
newspapers. The U.S. attorney in Detroit used a new
computerized system and a staff of seven paralegal
technicians to track down loan defaulters and col
lect $1.2 million last year alone.
Nationwide, the Justice Department network of
95 U.S. attorneys' offices collected more than $23
million last year in student-loan defaults. Broken
down, the collections represented $12,752,885 in
loans granted by the Veterans Administration and
$10,757,593 in loans made by the Department of
Education.
To hear Cissell tell it, recipients who defaulted on
their federal student loans were just about immune
from prosecution until 1978. He says that U.S. at
torneys didn't have the manpower or the machinery
to cope with the rising number of defaulters, and
that the colleges that administered student-loan
programs were less than enthusiastic about pursu
ing defaulters.

"One college administrator told me he didn't have
tho hrart to go ufter loan ci&faultei. 11** said it tv/is lihf
a father suing his son," Cissell said.
The trouble with that attitude, he said, is that it
presumes that people who default on their student
loans are destitute. Nothing could be further from
the truth, he said, adding that most defaulters are
employed people who don't believe that the federal
government is serious about getting its money back.
"A brief review of their employment information
reveals they are employed by sheriffs' departments,
police departments, fire departments and probation
departments," Cisell said "We've tracked loan de
faulters to newspapers and broadcast companies,
telephone companies, construction companies and
utility companies. These individuals are not desti
tute."
The crackdown on student-loan defaults is just be
ginning. New computers to track defaulters and
larger staffs to carry out default actions are moving
into U.S. attorneys' offices across the country.
Along with the manpower and machinery has
come a tougher attitude. Chief Assistant U.S. At
torney Jay Brent in Detroit says, "In the past we
haven't put liens on property or garnished any
wages to get back the government's money. We're
just beginning to do that."

loans are destitute. Nothing could be further from
the truth, he said, adding that most defaulters are
employed people who don't believe that the federal
government is serious about getting its money back.
"A brief review of their employment information
reveals they are employed by sheriffs' departments,
police departments, fire departments and probation
departments," Cisell said "We've tracked loan de
faulters to newspapers and broadcast companies,
telephone companies, construction companies and
utility companies. These individuals are not desti
tute."
The crackdown on student-loan defaults is just be
ginning. New computers to track defaulters and
larger staffs to carry out default actions are moving
into U.S. attorneys' offices across the country.
Along with the manpower and machinery has
come a tougher attitude. Chief Assistant U.S. At
torney Jay Brent in Detroit says, "In the past we
haven't put liens on property or garnished any
wages to get back the government's money. We're
just beginning to do that."
Washington — i he .justice Department begun a
broad new crackdown on student-loan defaults yes
terday with the filing of 501 lawsuits in three Ohio
cities to recover more than $660,000 in defaulted fed
eral loans.
The suits are being filed in U.S. District Courts in
Columbus. Dayton and Cincinnati by U.S. Attorney
James Cissell. who says he is "alarmed" at the
number of defaulted student loans across the coun
try, and especially in the southern district of Ohio.
He said the amount in default in the National
Direct Student Loan Program administered by col
leges in the southern district of Ohio was $23.6 mil
lion. 76 percent more than the $13.4 million taken in
all the bank robberies in the country in 1978
"The average loan in default in this district for
this one program was $947, which exceeded by $421
the average amount taken by burglars." Cissell
said. "Nationally, the amount in default for this sin
gle student-loan program was $732 million, an
amount more than four times greater than all rob
beries in the nation in 1978."
Monday's suit to recover $663,868 46 in defaulted
student loans marks the second time in the last two
years that Cissell has cracked down on student-loan
defaulters. The new suit brings to court more than
three times the number of defaulters involved in the

first suit and spotlights a trend in the Justice De
part merit, which is Mending out tho that
holders of federal student loans can now expect to be
sued if they default.
U.S. attorneys in Detroit, Cleveland and Milwau
kee are cracking down on student-loan defaults with
the same aggressiveness that Cissell's Cincinnati
office is. The U.S. attorney in Cleveland is giving the
names of alleged student-loan defaulters to local
newspapers. The U.S. attorney in Detroit used a new
computerized system and a staff of seven paralegal
technicians to track down loan defaulters and col
lect $1.2 million last year alone.
Nationwide, the Justice Department network of
95 U.S. attorneys' offices collected more than $23
million last year in student-loan defaults. Broken
down, the collections represented $12,752,885 in
loans granted by the Veterans Administration and
$10,757,593 in loans made by the Department of
Education.
To hear Cissell tell it, recipients who defaulted on
their federal student loans were just about immune
from prosecution until 1978. He says that U.S. at
torneys didn't have the manpower or the machinery
to cope with the rising number of defaulters, and
that the colleges that administered student-loan
programs were less than enthusiastic about pursu
ing defaulters.

"One college administrator told me he didn't have
tho hrart to go ufter loan ci&faultei. 11** said it tv/is lihf
a father suing his son," Cissell said.
The trouble with that attitude, he said, is that it
presumes that people who default on their student
loans are destitute. Nothing could be further from
the truth, he said, adding that most defaulters are
employed people who don't believe that the federal
government is serious about getting its money back.
"A brief review of their employment information
reveals they are employed by sheriffs' departments,
police departments, fire departments and probation
departments," Cisell said "We've tracked loan de
faulters to newspapers and broadcast companies,
telephone companies, construction companies and
utility companies. These individuals are not desti
tute."
