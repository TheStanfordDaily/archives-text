## A 						beautiful, offbeat movie 'Demon Pond'plays encore in S.F. 
### Steve Vineberg 
The movies of Masahiro
Shinoda are familiar to very few
Americans ; he hasn't caught on
with art house audiences, whose
contact with Japanese cinema
is limited to Kurosawa's pic
tures and the now-classic films
of Mizoguchi and Ozu — both of
whom have been dead for years.
It would be tragic if the exciting
work of Shinoda had to wait until
after his death to be recognized
in this country. Two years ago,
The Ballad of Orin played only
briefly in a handful of cities,
even though its American pre
miere at Filmex (L.A.'s annual
film festival) had been received
enthusiastically, and David
Denby, the \ew York Magazine
critic, had attempted to pro
mote it. It is the story of a blind
girl who is raised by a band of
goze (blind women who take a
vow of celibacy and lead the

lives of nomadic singers) and
when expelled from their com
pany for breaking her oath, she
has no choice but to become a
courtesan. It was a very tender
and extremely affecting movie.
The Bay Area is one of the few
places in the country where one
can see Shinoda's movies. I
caught The Ballad of Orin at
Berkeley's Pacific Film
Archive last September, where
the small audience applauded it
enthusiastically. Demon Pond,
which was shown at Filmex last
spring, opened at the Kokusai in
San Francisco this fall, and it
has just returned there for an
encore engagement. It is a beau
tiful, offbeat movie — a Kabuki
fable. It's not really like any
other movie I've seen: one
might best describe it as a Hans
Christian Andersen tale told by
a Japanese artist who is a com
bination of Gustave Dore and

Salvador Dali.
Demon Pond is double
layered. The main plot begins in
the summer of 1913 with the ar
rival of a traveller, the
schoolteacher Yamasawa
(Tsumoto Yamazaki), at a vil
lage in the hills. A drought is
killing off all the inhabitants —
the first we see of them is a pro
cession of men with white
painted faces bearing flowers
and a corpse in an open coffin —
and yet just above the village, a
mysterious woman named Yuri
lives contentedly. She drinks the
water of Demon Pond, which
the villagers will not touch be
cause they believe that it has
been poisoned by a dragon that
makes its home at the bottom of
the pond. Yamasawa is seeking
his best friend, Hagiwara (Go
Kato), who disappeared some
months earlier and he finds him
here, a captive of Yuri's love.
The secondary plot is the leg
end of Demon Pond, which
Hagiwara tells to Yamasawa.
The pond is the domain of Prin
cess Shirayuki, the daughter of
the Dragon God, who is pledged
to protect the village. Every day
a bell is rung to insure that the
pond will not overflow and
drown the village. The princess
longs to leave her kingdom and
join her lover, a neighboring
prince, but this obligation keeps
her at home.
The two pivotal roles, Yuri
and the princess, are both
played by one man - Tamasbuto
Bando. Bando is Japan's leading
Kabuki actor (Kabuki women's
parts have always been played
by men), and he is ex
traordinary, although his pecul
iar stylization takes some get
ting used to for an audience un
familiar with traditional
Japanese theater. When we
watch Kurosawa's movies, we
bridge the cultural gap with
ease, because he has already
moved closer to our sensibility
than most Japanese directors:
his pictures are steeped in the
lore of American movies, espe
cially Westerns. But Demon
Pond is a completely novel ex
perience, especially the fantasy
sequences. The movement, the
ornate costumes (some of the
actors impersonate various
marine creatures), the exag

gerated performances, the im
pressionistic color-coded pho
tography, and the weird, highly
charged material puts us off our
guard and forces us to respond
in new ways.
But Shinoda has not worked
out a successful technique for
merging the two styles he has
chosen. At first, the fantasy
scenes seem to intrude on the
main plot, but they are so re
markable that we are soon
swept up by them; and the vil
lage scenes, to which Shinoda
soon returns, begin to seem like
an intrusion. The two stories are
interconnected in some com
plicated way, and Yuri is seen
as the princess' alter ego, but
much of this is unclear. (It is
also unclear why Isao Tomita's
lush, haunting music turns to
Debussy in the middle of the
movie, or how we are meant to
understand the passage of
time.) What we rely on, finally,
is the power of Shinoda's im
agery, which works in spite of
the confusing narrative and
characterization.
Shinoda worked with two pho
tographers (Masao Kosugi and
Noritaka Sakamoto) and three
art directors, and the special ef
fects crew must have far out
numbered the actors. There is a
sequence in which the princess
floats beneath the surface of the
water, her robes opening to re
veal fish scales, that certainly
merits a footnote in the history
of fantasy on film. The in
evitable flood is a wonder — al
though the visual trickery
doesn't match up well with the
live actors playing the villagers,
who suddenly look like puppets.
We don't register any of the ac
tors anyway, except for Bando:
this is a movie about the magic
of water and turquoise land
scapes and sabled thatched
huts We come away from De
mon Pond with our heads full of
strange images — a shiny auto
mobile, eerily incongruous as it
descends a moonlit path into the
village; a catfish monk convers
ing with an anemic, bushy
headed spirit; a pink-tinted oil
lamp with blue trim, through
which a golden glow is filtered.
It's an opium dream of a movie.


Tonight: Jennifer Green, Mark Rhoda and Lome Buchman star in Stanford Drama Department's pro
duction of Odon von Horvath's "Tales from the Vienna Woods." Set in Vienna in the '30s, the play opens
at 8 p.m. in the Little Theatre. Tickets are available at the Tresidder Ticket Office, at major Bay Area
agencies and by telephone (497-4317).

The movies of Masahiro
Shinoda are familiar to very few
Americans ; he hasn't caught on
with art house audiences, whose
contact with Japanese cinema
is limited to Kurosawa's pic
tures and the now-classic films
of Mizoguchi and Ozu — both of
whom have been dead for years.
It would be tragic if the exciting
work of Shinoda had to wait until
after his death to be recognized
in this country. Two years ago,
The Ballad of Orin played only
briefly in a handful of cities,
even though its American pre
miere at Filmex (L.A.'s annual
film festival) had been received
enthusiastically, and David
Denby, the \ew York Magazine
critic, had attempted to pro
mote it. It is the story of a blind
girl who is raised by a band of
goze (blind women who take a
vow of celibacy and lead the

lives of nomadic singers) and
when expelled from their com
pany for breaking her oath, she
has no choice but to become a
courtesan. It was a very tender
and extremely affecting movie.
The Bay Area is one of the few
places in the country where one
can see Shinoda's movies. I
caught The Ballad of Orin at
Berkeley's Pacific Film
Archive last September, where
the small audience applauded it
enthusiastically. Demon Pond,
which was shown at Filmex last
spring, opened at the Kokusai in
San Francisco this fall, and it
has just returned there for an
encore engagement. It is a beau
tiful, offbeat movie — a Kabuki
fable. It's not really like any
other movie I've seen: one
might best describe it as a Hans
Christian Andersen tale told by
a Japanese artist who is a com
bination of Gustave Dore and

Salvador Dali.
Demon Pond is double
layered. The main plot begins in
the summer of 1913 with the ar
rival of a traveller, the
schoolteacher Yamasawa
(Tsumoto Yamazaki), at a vil
lage in the hills. A drought is
killing off all the inhabitants —
the first we see of them is a pro
cession of men with white
painted faces bearing flowers
and a corpse in an open coffin —
and yet just above the village, a
mysterious woman named Yuri
lives contentedly. She drinks the
water of Demon Pond, which
the villagers will not touch be
cause they believe that it has
been poisoned by a dragon that
makes its home at the bottom of
the pond. Yamasawa is seeking
his best friend, Hagiwara (Go
Kato), who disappeared some
months earlier and he finds him
here, a captive of Yuri's love.
The secondary plot is the leg
end of Demon Pond, which
Hagiwara tells to Yamasawa.
The pond is the domain of Prin
cess Shirayuki, the daughter of
the Dragon God, who is pledged
to protect the village. Every day
a bell is rung to insure that the
pond will not overflow and
drown the village. The princess
longs to leave her kingdom and
join her lover, a neighboring
prince, but this obligation keeps
her at home.
The two pivotal roles, Yuri
and the princess, are both
played by one man - Tamasbuto
Bando. Bando is Japan's leading
Kabuki actor (Kabuki women's
parts have always been played
by men), and he is ex
traordinary, although his pecul
iar stylization takes some get
ting used to for an audience un
familiar with traditional
Japanese theater. When we
watch Kurosawa's movies, we
bridge the cultural gap with
ease, because he has already
moved closer to our sensibility
than most Japanese directors:
his pictures are steeped in the
lore of American movies, espe
cially Westerns. But Demon
Pond is a completely novel ex
perience, especially the fantasy
sequences. The movement, the
ornate costumes (some of the
actors impersonate various
marine creatures), the exag

gerated performances, the im
pressionistic color-coded pho
tography, and the weird, highly
charged material puts us off our
guard and forces us to respond
in new ways.
But Shinoda has not worked
out a successful technique for
merging the two styles he has
chosen. At first, the fantasy
scenes seem to intrude on the
main plot, but they are so re
markable that we are soon
swept up by them; and the vil
lage scenes, to which Shinoda
soon returns, begin to seem like
an intrusion. The two stories are
interconnected in some com
plicated way, and Yuri is seen
as the princess' alter ego, but
much of this is unclear. (It is
also unclear why Isao Tomita's
lush, haunting music turns to
Debussy in the middle of the
movie, or how we are meant to
understand the passage of
time.) What we rely on, finally,
is the power of Shinoda's im
agery, which works in spite of
the confusing narrative and
characterization.
Shinoda worked with two pho
tographers (Masao Kosugi and
Noritaka Sakamoto) and three
art directors, and the special ef
fects crew must have far out
numbered the actors. There is a
sequence in which the princess
floats beneath the surface of the
water, her robes opening to re
veal fish scales, that certainly
merits a footnote in the history
of fantasy on film. The in
evitable flood is a wonder — al
though the visual trickery
doesn't match up well with the
live actors playing the villagers,
who suddenly look like puppets.
