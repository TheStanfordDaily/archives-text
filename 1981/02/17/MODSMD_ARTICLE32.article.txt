# Pasolini's latest doesn't shock-it seduces
## 
### Vince Waldman 
Before his death in 1975. Pier Paolo
Pasolini never had much success outside
Italy. While he had fine credentials (as a
writer for Fellini and Bertolucci. among
others) before becoming a director, he
was known less for the quality of his own
films than for his theoretical writings on
cinema and for his frequent battles with
the censors His last films did achieve a
certain degree of notoriety as artily
pornographic renderings of classic tales
— especially the infamous Sain: 120
Days of Sodom (1975) and The Can
terbury Tales (1972). Both movies
achieved some popular success in this
country despite widespread critical re
jection.
It's rather surprising, therefore, to ob
serve the warm praise that has greeted
The Arabian Mights, the latest Pasolini
epic to be released in America. Yes. the
film won a special prize at Cannes in
1974, but the bizarre tastes of the Cannes
festival are well known. Though slow and
convoluted. The Arabian Nights has
been drawing large audiences to the Lu
miere (California and Polk, San Francis
co); though full of nudity and gore, it has
been treated with respect and admira
tion by the critics. The praise has been
excessive: especially in San Francisco,
the media have treated the film as a mas
terpiece. which it is not.

Nevertheless, The Arabian Nights is a
very fine film, and an enjoyable one at
that. The "plot," such as it is, tells of the
search by one Nur Eddir for his slave girl
and lover Zumurrud. who was stolen
from him by a Christian merchant.
Before the lovers are finally reunited.
Pasolini weaves a complex tapestry of
fragmented legends, all centering on the
theme of sexual pleasure and sacrifice.
He creates a world of characters defined
by their erotic experiences Only the un
named Christian speaks in terms of ex
ternal morals: but he is shown to be a
hypocrite, a thoroughly reprehensible
figure who begs charity from Nur and
then abducts his lover. He richly de
serves his eventual crucifixion. The rest
of the characters — even the other vil
lains — seem to have no principles
beyond their willingness to follow the
urges of love.
This means, of course, that the movie
has a great deal of sex. both hetero- and
homosexual. The Arabian Nights is
rated X. probably because of an abun
dance of male genitalia: the American
rating system speaks for the proposition
that only females may be acceptable sex
objects. Yet this is certainly not the typi
cal exploitative porn flick. In fact, wom
en seem to like the film more than men,
possibly because the boys are prettier
than the girls (several of the subplots ac

tually center around this fact) or be
cause the women characters have more
substantial roles: the men tend to be
pusillanimous, while the women control
the action.
Pasolini's treatment of sex is surpris
ingly reticent: nude bodies are ev
erywhere, but the lovemaking is highly
stylized. The eroticism is evidently not
intended to arouse the audience; rather,
it sets a pervading mood of lugubrious
physicality. Most of the time, there isn't
even any foreplay — the characters
make love quickly and routinely, as if
they are forced to coitus by urges they
might resist if given the time. The rapidi
ty of the sex is incongruous in a film that
tries to be a leisurely celebration of the
pleasures of animal vitality.
The film has other faults. Most of it
was apparently filmed in Arabic, then
dubbed in Italian. For American release
subtitles were added, so the viewer suf
fers both from the chore of reading sub
titles and from the distraction of a
soundtrack out of sync with the move
ment of the actors' lips. At times the pho
tography is diffuse or even blurred;
some scenes are badly edited, so that
characters react to things that aren't
there.
Nevertheless, The Arabian IVights is a
triumph in one respect: rarely has a film
so masterfully captured the spirit of
fable. The landscape is timeless: stone

fortresses glisten like gold, the wild
desert floor could be another world, and
the rich, terraced fields are a fecund set
ting for the film's luxuriant erotic
dreams. Events are magical: things hap
pen without rational explanation, and yet
the characters — and the audience — ac
cept them without reference to any logic
outside the fabulous. In the film's most
moving story, a foolish young man
named Azi2L is smitten with love for an
other woman on his wedding day. His
bride understands, and even helps him
consummate his desires. "It's normal,"
she says placidly. In another sequence,
Zumurrud escapes her captors, and
through an improbable coincidence be
comes ruler of the city. This allows her to
punish her tormentors and to find her
beloved Nur; but her cunning is less im
portant than an enchanted bowl of rice
which seems to draw everyone she seeks.
The ardent but somewhat fatuous Nur
searches endlessly, without hope of find
ing his love. Suddenly, inexplicably, he is
confronted by a lion which leads him to
Zumurrud's kingdom. By this time the
viewer has come to understand the mys
terious internal logic of the fable, and
can believe in the power of fate without
the intervention of skepticism.
PasoJini's vision is a seductive dream
which ultimately entrances the audience
and makes it a part of the mysterious
world on screen.

beloved Nur; but her cunning is less im
portant than an enchanted bowl of rice
which seems to draw everyone she seeks.
The ardent but somewhat fatuous Nur
searches endlessly, without hope of find
ing his love. Suddenly, inexplicably, he is
confronted by a lion which leads him to
Zumurrud's kingdom. By this time the
viewer has come to understand the mys
terious internal logic of the fable, and
can believe in the power of fate without
the intervention of skepticism.
PasoJini's vision is a seductive dream
which ultimately entrances the audience
and makes it a part of the mysterious
world on screen.
Before his death in 1975. Pier Paolo
Pasolini never had much success outside
Italy. While he had fine credentials (as a
writer for Fellini and Bertolucci. among
others) before becoming a director, he
was known less for the quality of his own
films than for his theoretical writings on
cinema and for his frequent battles with
the censors His last films did achieve a
certain degree of notoriety as artily
pornographic renderings of classic tales
— especially the infamous Sain: 120
Days of Sodom (1975) and The Can
terbury Tales (1972). Both movies
achieved some popular success in this
country despite widespread critical re
jection.
It's rather surprising, therefore, to ob
serve the warm praise that has greeted
The Arabian Mights, the latest Pasolini
epic to be released in America. Yes. the
film won a special prize at Cannes in
1974, but the bizarre tastes of the Cannes
festival are well known. Though slow and
convoluted. The Arabian Nights has
been drawing large audiences to the Lu
miere (California and Polk, San Francis
co); though full of nudity and gore, it has
been treated with respect and admira
tion by the critics. The praise has been
excessive: especially in San Francisco,
the media have treated the film as a mas
terpiece. which it is not.

Nevertheless, The Arabian Nights is a
very fine film, and an enjoyable one at
that. The "plot," such as it is, tells of the
search by one Nur Eddir for his slave girl
and lover Zumurrud. who was stolen
from him by a Christian merchant.
Before the lovers are finally reunited.
Pasolini weaves a complex tapestry of
fragmented legends, all centering on the
theme of sexual pleasure and sacrifice.
He creates a world of characters defined
by their erotic experiences Only the un
named Christian speaks in terms of ex
ternal morals: but he is shown to be a
hypocrite, a thoroughly reprehensible
figure who begs charity from Nur and
then abducts his lover. He richly de
serves his eventual crucifixion. The rest
of the characters — even the other vil
lains — seem to have no principles
beyond their willingness to follow the
urges of love.
This means, of course, that the movie
has a great deal of sex. both hetero- and
homosexual. The Arabian Nights is
rated X. probably because of an abun
dance of male genitalia: the American
rating system speaks for the proposition
that only females may be acceptable sex
objects. Yet this is certainly not the typi
cal exploitative porn flick. In fact, wom
en seem to like the film more than men,
possibly because the boys are prettier
than the girls (several of the subplots ac

tually center around this fact) or be
cause the women characters have more
substantial roles: the men tend to be
pusillanimous, while the women control
the action.
Pasolini's treatment of sex is surpris
ingly reticent: nude bodies are ev
erywhere, but the lovemaking is highly
stylized. The eroticism is evidently not
intended to arouse the audience; rather,
it sets a pervading mood of lugubrious
physicality. Most of the time, there isn't
even any foreplay — the characters
make love quickly and routinely, as if
they are forced to coitus by urges they
might resist if given the time. The rapidi
ty of the sex is incongruous in a film that
tries to be a leisurely celebration of the
pleasures of animal vitality.
The film has other faults. Most of it
was apparently filmed in Arabic, then
dubbed in Italian. For American release
subtitles were added, so the viewer suf
fers both from the chore of reading sub
titles and from the distraction of a
soundtrack out of sync with the move
ment of the actors' lips. At times the pho
tography is diffuse or even blurred;
some scenes are badly edited, so that
characters react to things that aren't
there.
Nevertheless, The Arabian IVights is a
triumph in one respect: rarely has a film
so masterfully captured the spirit of
fable. The landscape is timeless: stone

fortresses glisten like gold, the wild
desert floor could be another world, and
the rich, terraced fields are a fecund set
ting for the film's luxuriant erotic
dreams. Events are magical: things hap
pen without rational explanation, and yet
the characters — and the audience — ac
cept them without reference to any logic
outside the fabulous. In the film's most
moving story, a foolish young man
named Azi2L is smitten with love for an
other woman on his wedding day. His
bride understands, and even helps him
consummate his desires. "It's normal,"
she says placidly. In another sequence,
Zumurrud escapes her captors, and
through an improbable coincidence be
comes ruler of the city. This allows her to
punish her tormentors and to find her
beloved Nur; but her cunning is less im
portant than an enchanted bowl of rice
