# Stanford student releases album—on his own label
## 
### Scott McIntyre 
It's the end of the week,
You're walking home through
White Plaza, you know the
scene: Recordman; Pipeman;
Pillowperson; you might even
stop to buy a rose or two for a
friend, and walk on. But wait,
who's this new face?
He's pleading with you to buy
an album, and looks like he
hasn't eaten in weeks. You take
pity on him and, after looking
him over, buy his album. You
carry it home and decide to lis
ten to it over dinner, or a beer;
you're still quite skeptical.
You're beginning to wonder
what made you pay $6.50 for an
album you've never heard, or
heard of. But after several
minutes — it may take longer
for some — you're pleasantly
surprised and probably wonder
ing, "Who is this guy?"
His name is Larry Good, he's
a Stanford senior, and he made
that album you just bought; he
wrote, performed, recorded,
and produced it. Entitled
Try ing to Rcach the (Wound by
Larry Good and friends, the
album is a varied blend of
styles, ranging from calypso to
jazz to rock 'n' roll.
"I like to think this record re
flects an evolution of popular
music. That way if you don't like
something, then it's not really
my fault," Good wrote on the
album insert.
"It's the kind of music you
have to get to know to like,"
Good claims, "but I think it
wears well. I mean, I've lis
tended to it a thousand times
and I still like it. No one has told
me yet that they don't like it.
Even the producers in L.A. liked
it. but told me it would be a hard
sell.
"But that's okay with me," he
added. I don't want to make
commercial music. That's the
point of Third Rail Records
(Good's label). We want to do
things people don't have a
chance to hear elsewhere."

Good brought Third Rail Rec
ords into existence with two
hundred dollars. The point was
to retain as much control as pos
sible over the recording proc
ess. He also claims that he can't
wait for the royalties to start
pouring in; as the publishing
company, he will receive 1/2
penny per minute of airtime.
"Right now, Third Rail Rec
ords has $5.50 and Larry Good
has $8," he said. "I paid for it
all myself and I have to sell a
thousand records, and still
won't break even. It's like I dug
a hole and I'm hoping there'll be
enough dirt to fill it in."
But it's the album, not the
record company, which has his
attention.
"I started my own record
company and everything,"
Larry says, "but I'd rather talk
about the music."
Trying to Reach the
(Wound is the culmination of
seven months of hard work, and
at least three years of dreaming
— but it probably goes back
farther than that," he says.
"When I was seven, people
would ask me what I wanted to
be and I would say, a composer.
I always wanted to be a com
poser. Then about three sum
mers ago I started making a list
of all the songs I'd ever written.
I had about 100. I thought I'd put
out four different albums under
four different names. I'd have a
country music album, a rock 'n'
roll album, an instrumental
album."
Trying to Reach the
(Wound got its big break while
Larry was working at a stereo
store, and bought a four-track
recorder at a discount price. Us
ing his musical skills (he plays
the guitar, piano, mandolin, and
cello) and his education at Stan
ford in orchestration and con
ducting. he was able to get the
album off the ground.
"All these things came into
play. In the studio I had to know
what I wanted, what to do, what

sounds to use. I learned all about
making new sounds, even using
things around the house.
"Most of my tracks on the
album were recorded in the stu
dio. They had the benefit of high
technology, and I had the bene
fit of all the time I needed. It
was three months straight at
home, six hours a day or more. I
had the attitude if I can make
this a little better, even if no one
notices, then that'll be great.' "
Good adds: "I got compulsive
about it. My room was
spiderweb of stereo cords,
guitars all over the floor, egg
cartons on the wall."
The care that Good put into
the making is evident in the fin
ished product. Although it has
the look and sound of a home
made album — because it is
homemade — it is also a very
well-crafted product, from the
artwork to the lyric sheet to the
quality of the recordings. From
beginning to end. it is a Larry
Good original.
Good lives on a small farm
near the bay, on the soon-to-be
developed edge of Mountain
View, in a house with rusty wa
ter, slated floors, and a one
eyed dog named Washington. He
drives a battleweary Datsun
wagon, and smokes Camel
lights. He writes short stories in
the style of Borges and Robert
Coover. He plays guitar, piano,
and sings with The Claude
Monet Band, a campus con
glomerate. And he thoroughly
enjoyed the experience making
the album allowed him, despite
the problems.
"I feel really good about it.
I've had some personal prob
lems packaging myself, pushing
my own album. My friends will
say, 'Hey, Rock Star.' Once you
put out an album it's pretty ob
vious you want to make music
and perform in front of people,
but there's still an ego identity
problem.
"I'm sure a lot of the people in
Stanford bands are feeling the

same way, as we all try to
branch into the real-world mu
sic scene. I'm sure a lot of them
are having identity problems.
When you're in a band and that's
all you think about and all you
want to think about, it's hard to
make that transition back to
real life."
This is where it all started:
"My dad, a Religious Studies
professor at Stanford, doesn't
listen to anything but classical
music. I used to get out those
thick old 78s and play them on
my little phonograph. I really
got into it. Then, in fifth grade, I
went to AM."
Good played guitar and piano
throughout high school, gradu
ally picking it up, then took a
year off after school to live in
East Palo Alto with some
friends who had formed a band.
He worked in a factory ten hours
a day for seven months. During
this period he wrote the song
"Boss Man," which appears on
the album.
Like a smart boy, he saved his
money and headed to the Carib
bean. There, on a small island
called St. Lucia, he met Giles
Hunt, who invited Good to live
with him, and introduced him to
some local friends and musi
cians.
"They tried to teach me to
play Reggae, but I just couldn't
get the beat. I could play the
guitar, but couldn't get the beat.
Giles couldn't play guitar, but
he had the beat. I heard steel
bands for the first time, and got
turned on to Calypso."
Giles, who has since emi
grated to Canada, is the only
paid musician on the album.
When he returned, Larry
formed a band with some
friends, called "Yomamus
Chin."
"I've always been skeptical
of Stanford musicians, and kept
away from them. I didn't think
they could concentrate on their
music and school too. But then
the Stanford music scene really

took off a couple of years ago,
and I heard about an opening in
The Claude Monet Band.
Though Good played the bulk
of the instruments on Trying to
Reach the (Wound, other musi
cians, including members of
three Stanford bands, Claude
Monet, Rooftop Magic, and
Wildebeest, helped out tremen
dously. Missy Peabody and
Leslie Moulton, of Claude Monet
and Rooftop Magic respective
ly, each sang a song Chris
Pilon, Tom Casciato and Bob
Williams all played guitar;
Lewis McLin added the drums;
Bill Murphy played bass; and
Marty Rapkin played sax
aphone and finished "Breakfast
of Blues" with a bloodcurdling
scat (a jazz technique of sing
ing nonsense syllables in an in
strumental style). Every per
son on the album except Giles
and Bill Murphy, who plays
bass, is or was a Stanford stu
dent.
Good experienced a great
many setbacks while cutting
Trying to Reach the (Wound.
"At first," he explains, "I was
really manic about doing ev
erything myself: the insert, the
cover, the scheduling of people
in the studio. There were so
many things I can't even re
member. And going to school. I
had to promise myself The Big
Sleep later on.
"Some songs I had to remix,
recut. Then I wasn't satisfied
with the pressing quality, and
had to get that redone. I was giv
en some bad information on the
cover size, and they all came out
too small. That was the last
step."
All in all, he had to work with
twelve companies, two graphic
artists — "one split right in the
middle of everything" — and
two printers. The finished prod
uct, however, doesn't show the
scars of its maker. Considering
the diversity of styles, it has a
cohesion many albums lack.
"I've gotten some feedback

from the industry," Larry says,
"and they say my stuff's not
commercial and that all the
songs are too long. I think it's
too commercial. The variety of
styles is bad for com
mercialism, because I can't
pigeonhole myself for a radio
station. But it's good for Third
Rail Records, the idea of diver
sity and expanded frontiers."
Good lights a cigarette from a
borrowed pack of Winstons.
What about the future?
"I'm looking forward to get
ting out of school so I can con
centrate on my own musical
ideas, rather than studying oth
er people's. Now that I have a
record out, people are coming
up to me and giving me tapes.
And that's neat, but I have to
like what they're doing to pro
duce it. And it'll have to sell. I
have to feel strongly both
ways."
As for Third Rail Records,
Claude Monet, Rooftop Magic,
and Wildebeest are all talking
about cutting albums — "but
it's all very tentative." Good
says. Other projects include
recording obscure classical
pieces as performed by the

Manzanita Quartet, and cutting
a meditation record "of the
sound of rain hitting the tufa for
mations at Mono Lake." "As for
me," Larry adds, "I want to do
another album already." But
first, he has to sell this one. He
wrote himself a song to com
memorate the occasion:
Put all your finishing touches
away,
for some other day.
Put all your finishing touches
away,
for some other day gonna find
you
looking for something in
complete.
You'll start it again, this time
u ith a different heat.
Trying to Reach the Ground
will be released this Friday, and
will be available at the Stanford
Bookstore, at Plowshare book
store in Palo Alto, and from
Larry Good himself. Good and
fellow Stanford musician Adlai
Alexander will celebrate the
album's release with a per
formance at the Coffee House
this Friday night.
