Task force okays hostage agreement
Washington — A special government task force has
found there is no legal obstacle to implementing the agree
ment that led to the release of the 52 American hostages
from Iran last month, administration officials said yester
day.
The officials, who asked not to be named, said lawyers
from the State and Justice departments had determined
the complex and unprecedented pact negotiated by former
President Jimmy Carter with the Iranians was not in
consistent with American law.
"There's no legal problem that they've been able to find
with implementation of the agreement." said one admin
istration official of the comprehensive review.
The inter-agency task force sent its findings to the White
House yesterday.
Reagan economic message ready
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, arguing that
"the system will work if we let it work." will tell Congress
tomorrow night that the nation must act immediately and
follow his prescription of budget and tax cuts, his spokes
man said yesterday.
Reagan will "build a case that we must act now." White
House press secretary James Brady said after reading the
text of the address the president will deliver to a joint ses
sion of the House and Senate.
Brady said the speech will offer details on four points:
budget cuts; cuts in individual and business taxes, the lat
ter through an accelerated depreciation schedule; the
need for a stabilized monetary system; and regulatory re
vision initiatives.
The spokesman said Reagan will seek to set straight
"some misapprehensions" by emphasizing that there will
be "equal treatment for business subsidies as well as other
government programs."
That would appear to be an effort to alleviate fears that
the president will try to stem government spending in
creases by cutting programs of social assistance without
making reductions in government assistance for business.
After returning from a three-day Washington's Birth
day weekend visit to Camp David, Md., the president re
viewed yesterday a draft of the speech in the White House
library with seven key aides, Brady said.
The president and his aides went over the speech "page
by page, line by line," and by the end of the meeting, the
speech was considered complete, Brady said.
Pope's visit interrupted by blast
Karachi, Pakistan — A bomb went off yesterday near a
VIP reviewing stand at Karachi's national stadium
minutes before Pope John Paul II arrived to celebrate
Mass for 100.000 people on his way to a peace mission to the
Far East. The blast killed the man who slipped the device
into the stadium and seriously hurt his two alleged ac
complices. police said.
John Paul, making a stopover in the predominantly
Moslem nation on his 12-day tour, apparently was unaware
of the explosion and may not have been told of it. His jour
ney will take him to the Philippines. Guam. Japan and An
chorage, Alaska.
The 60-vear-old pontiff, wearing a white cassock and
skullcap, arrived under heavy police escort and celebrated
a 90-minute Mass for the faithful.
Witnesses said the blast occurred as choirs sang hymns

and most of the spectators did not hear it There was no
panic.
The dead and and at least two of the injured were be
lieved to be Pakistanis in their 20s. At least one of the vic
tims was identified by police as a Pakistani Christian.
Terrorists attack Paris embassy
Paris — Terrorists smashed two rockets into the South
Yemen Embassy early yesterday in what they claim is re
taliation for a deadly synagogue bombing The thunderous
explosions awakened the fashionable neighborhood and
heavily damaged the embassy but caused no injuries.
"We claim the action against the South Yemen Em
bassy in the name of all victims of RueCopernic," said the
French-language recording played over the telephone to
the Agence France-Presse news agency. "We have left a
sign of our attack next to where the rockets were launched.
Remember Copernic."
The Copernic synagogue bombing Oct. 3 killed three
passers-by and one worshipper and injured 20 people in one
of the most violent of recent anti-Semitic incidents in the
French capital The bomb exploded minutes before the
service inside was about to end There have been no ar
rests in the case.
"Remember Copernic" was scrawled in English on a
note police found along with two empty rocket-launching
tubes near the embassy of the small, Soviet-backed Arab
nation. It was not clear why the South Yemen Embassy
was singled out for yesterday's attack
Investigators said they believed the nighttime attack
was the work of three people with expertise in explosives
but they had no clues to their identity. The dual launching
was triggered by timing devices, police said.
The embassy ground floor was heavily damaged and
closed yesterday. Metal security bars were twisted and
window shutters pulverized
Soviet espionage plot exposed
Moscow — Soviet secret police last month sought unsuc
cessfully to blackmail and recruit as a spy a U.S. Army at
tache stationed in Moscow who is a candidate to be a mili
tary adviser to Vice President George Bush, a position in
which he would have access to high national secrets, re
liable sources say.
The sources said the attempt to recruit Maj. James
Holbrook may have included use of drugs to incapacitate
him and a military colleague, efforts to arrange com
promising photographs of Holbrook and an offer of "help"
from a Soviet colonel Holbrook knew from a previous
Eastern bloc assignment who mysteriously appeared on
the scene at a crucial moment.
The U.S. Embassy here has refused all comment on the
incident, which the sources described as the most serious
— although crude — attempt to compromise and recruit a
U.S. Embassy staffer in Moscow in recent years. The at
tempt failed when Holbrook and his traveling companion.
Army Lt. Col. Thomas Spencer, immediately reported the
setup to their superiors, the sources said. Holbrook since
has returned to Washington with his family.
A State Department spokesman refused to comment,
saying, "We cannot confirm or deny the story."
Peter Teeley. press secretary for Bush, said Holbrook is
still a candidate for the job of special military adviser to
the vice president and is one of four persons being con
sidered.
Sources here said the entrapment attempt occurred the
week of Jan. 12, in the western Ukrainian city of Rovno,

apparently shortly before Washington ordered Holbrook
home for an interview for the job with Bush.
Observers speculate that Soviet intelligence may have
learned Holbrook was a prospect for the position with
Bush, where he could have access to sensitive Reagan ad
ministration secrets, sit in on military strategy sessions,
and see highly classified information of the United States
and its allies.
Two more bodies found in Atlanta
Atlanta — Eleven-year-old Jeffery Mathis, last seen
almost a year ago when he walked to a service station near
his home, has become the 17th black child found slain in
the Atlanta area in the past 19 months, police say.
Medical officials who spent much of the weekend ex
amining the skeletal remains found Friday in an over
grown area of south Fulton County made the identification
Sunday.
Dr. John Feegel, associate medical examiner for Fulton
County, said dental records were the main tool used to
identify the Atlanta child and to rule out the possibility the
body was that of another missing black child, 10-year-old
Darron Glass.
He said there were "minor inconsistencies" between
the records of each child and the teeth found in the
skeleton. But the skeletal teeth also had several consisten
cies with Mathis' records and none with Glass', he said.
Glass is the only child still missing in the series of 18
slayings and disappearances of black children.
Feegel said no cause of death could be established from
the remains, which were found by an FBI team in an area
where the bodies or remains of six other children have
been found since the string of slayings began.
In related developments, authorities want to question a
man in a green car who was seen near where the body of
one of Atlanta's 17 slain children was found last week, a
police spokesman said yesterday.
Two employees who worked at the office park where the
body of 11-year-old Patrick Baltazar was discovered Fri
day said they saw a man nearby when they arrived early in
the morning, said Chuck Johnson, a spokesman for the
DeKalb County police.
Ex-Beatles having recording session
Plymouth, Montserrat — Former Beatles Paul Mc-
Cartney and Ringo Starr began a joint recording session on
this Caribbean island yesterday, said Steve Jackson, man
ager of Air Studio-Montserrat.
In an earlier interview, Jackson denied reports Mc-
Cartney and Starr are recording a tribute album to John
Lennon, the former Beatle shot to death in front of his New
York apartment Dec. 8.
Jackson also denied reports the third surviving member
of the group, George Harrison, would be joining Mc-
Cartney and Starr for the recording session. That same
word came from the London law firm Euro-Atlantic, Ltd.,
which represents Harrison.
Jackson did say, however, that Harrison will 'definitely
be on the record" and that the ex-Beatle has already rec
orded tracks for the album in London.
