# Difficulties in converting industry to wartime use cited
## Pentagon can't fill emergency production needs 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — In 1974, after huge
numbers of U.S. tanks were shipped to
Israel to replace those destroyed in
the Yom Kippur War, the U.S. Army
found itself essentially without tanks
for its own divisions. A crash program
was launched to produce more tanks
at an Army-owned. Chrysler-run fac
tory kept in reserve for just such
emergencies.
"It didn't work," recalled Jacques
Gansler, then deputy assistant secre
tary of defense for materiel acquisi
tion.
"We couldn't buy the hull and turret

castings for the tanks," he said. "The
main supplier told us to get in line be
hind his commercial customers. U.S.
Steel didn't want any government
work It was more than two years
before tanks began to come off that
line."

Neivs analysis

The Army's experience with its sup
posedly ready tank factory apparently
is typical of an eroding capacity to
shift industrial capabilities quickly
from civilian to military production.
Traditionally, Americans have

tended to believe that they could con
centrate on civilian activities until a
crisis developed, then switch almost
overnight to become "the arsenal of
democracy" — as legend at least says
was done in World War 11.
Increasing concern
Yet Pentagon officials and outside
specialists in military production ex
press increasing concern over the na
tion's ability to convert industrial fa
cilities fast enough to meet an emer
gency.
Gen Alton Slay, chief of the Air
Force Systems Command, said it is
"foolhardy and dangerous" to believe
that the United States is ready for
such crisis conversions.
If the Air Force, for example, were
ordered to go all-out today with pro
duction of its best planes, the F-15 and
F-16 fighters, the rate of production
could not be increased by as much as a
single- picric /oi 10 months*. i*n<J it
would be three years before signifi
cant numbers of the new craft could
fly. Slay told Congress recently.
The Navy, for its part, has calcu
lated that it would take 10 years to
build enough ships and planes to meet
its recommended force levels, accord
ing to Adm. A. J Whittle, chief of
Navy materiel. He blames a scarcity
of shipyards capable of constructing
large-hull ships and a shortage of
skilled workers, among other things.
Trident delays
In its biggest on-going program, the
Navy has seen the production of its
Trident missile-firing submarines slip
two years behind schedule. Navy of
ficials have complained publicly that
the steel that the Navy was receiving
did not meet specifications, that im
proper welds were discovered in the
boats, and that water-based rather
than oil-based paint was used in Tri
dent bilges. The contractor blamed
Navy-ordered design changes for

much of the schedule slippage, but
whatever the cause, the delays il
lustrate the limits of the nation's abili
ty to keep a high-priority defense pro
duction program on schedule.
The United States is the only nation
in the world that does not treat its de
fense industry as a critical national re
source. Gansler wrote in a recent
book, The Defense Industry. Particu
larly since the Vietnam War. the de
fense industry has deteriorated to a
point that today, the production of mil
itary equipment is not economical and
could not be increased rapidly for
strategic weapons.
The defense industrial picture also
is clouded by increased reliance on
foreign sources of raw materials and
the quality of U.S. products and work
ers.
Dependence on foreign sources
According to Gen. David Jones,
<jf t/ic %J*9lnt Ctoiisfa Stuff,
the United States is increasingly de
pendent on foreign sources for
strategic materials. For the 25 min
erals and other materials most impor
tant for defense, 70 percent of the
quantities used now come from
abroad, compared with 54 percent 20
years ago. And.he said, the situation
will worsen in the coming decade.
A quality comparison of three
Japanese and three U.S. companies
making 16.000-bit memory chips for
integrated circuits found a failure rate
that was nine times higher for the best
American chip than for the best
Japanese chip. Gen. Slay reported.
He quoted a Douglas Aircraft Co. of
ficial as saying that up to 40 percent of
aerospace work must be redone "be
cause it was not (done) right the first
time." The Air Force has had re
peated problems with defective en
gine turbine parts, bearings, welds,
structures and tubings, Slay told a
House Armed Services subcommittee.
The Defense Industrial Base Panel of that subcommit
tee. in a December report, said that the lead time for man
ufacturing critical parts has been increasing rapidly in re
cent years.
The critical lack of forgings — steel, titanium and
aluminum — was blamed in part by Slay on '' the closure of
literally hundreds of foundries in the mid-1970s as a result
of very ambitious OSHA-EPA rule-making
But Gansler. who is now vice president of the Analytic
Sciences Corp . took a somewhat different position on the
effect of the regulations.
"The data show that foundries that closed were the
smaller ones, not those who make the big and specialized
forgings that the military needs," Gansler said
"1 blame primarily the single-year contracts and small
buys of the Defense Department for this situation with the
big forgings," he said

ficial as saying that up to 40 percent of
aerospace work must be redone "be
cause it was not (done) right the first
time." The Air Force has had re
peated problems with defective en
gine turbine parts, bearings, welds,
structures and tubings, Slay told a
House Armed Services subcommittee.
The Defense Industrial Base Panel of that subcommit
tee. in a December report, said that the lead time for man
ufacturing critical parts has been increasing rapidly in re
cent years.
The critical lack of forgings — steel, titanium and
aluminum — was blamed in part by Slay on '' the closure of
literally hundreds of foundries in the mid-1970s as a result
of very ambitious OSHA-EPA rule-making
But Gansler. who is now vice president of the Analytic
Sciences Corp . took a somewhat different position on the
effect of the regulations.
"The data show that foundries that closed were the
smaller ones, not those who make the big and specialized
forgings that the military needs," Gansler said
"1 blame primarily the single-year contracts and small
buys of the Defense Department for this situation with the
big forgings," he said
Washington — In 1974, after huge
numbers of U.S. tanks were shipped to
Israel to replace those destroyed in
the Yom Kippur War, the U.S. Army
found itself essentially without tanks
for its own divisions. A crash program
was launched to produce more tanks
at an Army-owned. Chrysler-run fac
tory kept in reserve for just such
emergencies.
"It didn't work," recalled Jacques
Gansler, then deputy assistant secre
tary of defense for materiel acquisi
tion.
"We couldn't buy the hull and turret

castings for the tanks," he said. "The
main supplier told us to get in line be
hind his commercial customers. U.S.
Steel didn't want any government
work It was more than two years
before tanks began to come off that
line."

Neivs analysis

The Army's experience with its sup
posedly ready tank factory apparently
is typical of an eroding capacity to
shift industrial capabilities quickly
from civilian to military production.
Traditionally, Americans have

tended to believe that they could con
centrate on civilian activities until a
crisis developed, then switch almost
overnight to become "the arsenal of
democracy" — as legend at least says
was done in World War 11.
Increasing concern
Yet Pentagon officials and outside
specialists in military production ex
press increasing concern over the na
tion's ability to convert industrial fa
cilities fast enough to meet an emer
gency.
Gen Alton Slay, chief of the Air
Force Systems Command, said it is
"foolhardy and dangerous" to believe
that the United States is ready for
such crisis conversions.
If the Air Force, for example, were
ordered to go all-out today with pro
duction of its best planes, the F-15 and
F-16 fighters, the rate of production
could not be increased by as much as a
single- picric /oi 10 months*. i*n<J it
would be three years before signifi
cant numbers of the new craft could
fly. Slay told Congress recently.
The Navy, for its part, has calcu
lated that it would take 10 years to
build enough ships and planes to meet
its recommended force levels, accord
ing to Adm. A. J Whittle, chief of
Navy materiel. He blames a scarcity
of shipyards capable of constructing
large-hull ships and a shortage of
skilled workers, among other things.
Trident delays
In its biggest on-going program, the
Navy has seen the production of its
Trident missile-firing submarines slip
two years behind schedule. Navy of
ficials have complained publicly that
the steel that the Navy was receiving
did not meet specifications, that im
proper welds were discovered in the
boats, and that water-based rather
than oil-based paint was used in Tri
dent bilges. The contractor blamed
Navy-ordered design changes for

much of the schedule slippage, but
whatever the cause, the delays il
lustrate the limits of the nation's abili
ty to keep a high-priority defense pro
duction program on schedule.
The United States is the only nation
in the world that does not treat its de
fense industry as a critical national re
source. Gansler wrote in a recent
book, The Defense Industry. Particu
larly since the Vietnam War. the de
fense industry has deteriorated to a
point that today, the production of mil
itary equipment is not economical and
could not be increased rapidly for
strategic weapons.
The defense industrial picture also
is clouded by increased reliance on
foreign sources of raw materials and
the quality of U.S. products and work
ers.
Dependence on foreign sources
According to Gen. David Jones,
<jf t/ic %J*9lnt Ctoiisfa Stuff,
the United States is increasingly de
pendent on foreign sources for
strategic materials. For the 25 min
erals and other materials most impor
tant for defense, 70 percent of the
quantities used now come from
abroad, compared with 54 percent 20
years ago. And.he said, the situation
will worsen in the coming decade.
A quality comparison of three
Japanese and three U.S. companies
making 16.000-bit memory chips for
integrated circuits found a failure rate
that was nine times higher for the best
American chip than for the best
Japanese chip. Gen. Slay reported.
