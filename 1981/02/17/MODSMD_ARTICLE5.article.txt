# Suicides at universities: a difficult problem to comprehend
## Students' high expectations sometimes make it difficult to cope with setbacks

First of two parts
Three Stanford men recently
took their own lives.
One was an 18-year-old pre-med
ical school student who said he
could not communicate his person
al problems. Another, a 27-year-old
graduate student in engineering,
said he thought he was going crazy.
And last week, an internationally
respected chemist, who wrote that
he had suffered severe depression,
committed suicide at the age of 54

News analysis

Suicide is a difficult problem to
understand — especially when it
happens to members of a univer
sity community.
"Futility, despair, hopeless
ness." are three key words for un
derstanding suicide, according to
Dr David Dorosin, director of
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices (CAPS) here.
"You can feel very depressed,"
he said. "That's different from
feeling suicidal." If someone be
gins to feel hopeless and helpless
persistently, that person may be
suicidal, he said
No one can be sure as to the
causes of suicides, and the experts
disagree over whether factors such
as social background make a dif
ference.
Suicide, like most other social
problems, may be more frequent
among the lower social classes, ac

cording to Dr. Douglas Powell, di
rector of Harvard's psychological
services. Students "who are ac
cepted into the top dozen or so col
leges have a lot going for them
(and) a network of friends," and
therefore are less likely to commit
suicide, he added. There is a dif
ference between "someone who
goes to Chico State" and someone
who goes to the top schools. Powell
suggested.
Dorosin said that he disagreed
with Powell's assertion. Dorosin
said that he has never seen social
class specific data for college stu
dents in regard to suicide.
"The evidence in the past has
gone the other way," Dorosin said.
The more competitive universites
have had higher suicide rates
Failure to 'reach out'
Dorosin said that people who kill
themselves usually failed to
"reach out" for help. He noted that
students who come to CAPS in a su
icidal or depressed state have "a
heightened sense of personal cul
pability." Getting a B grade in a
class does not mean just getting a
lower grade — it means the loss of a
person's whole outlook, he said
Problems in personal or family
relationships, academic disap
pointments or a mixture of both
can bring out suicidal tendencies or
depression, Dorosin said
"Stanford attracts people with
high expectancies People with ex
pectancies have to learn to deal
with setbacks," Dorosin said

Dorosin recently helped produce
a film on the psychological prob
lems associated with college life
called (treat Expectations.
Depression very common
He noted that depression is very
common among college students
and he estimated that 25 to 30 per
cent of Stanford students "have
vague thoughts about committing
suicide."
Since 1963, when Cowell Health
Center began collecting the
statistics, there have been 22 cam
pus-related student suicides — 21
by males and one by a female
Dorosin said the number of sui
cides among undergraduates and
graduate students are about equal
Dorosin also noted that despite
national statistics showing an in
crease in suicide rates among col
lege-age persons, there has been no
such upward trend at Stanford.
Overall the suicide rate here has
been very low. he said.
Harvard suicide rate
At Harvard, the suicide rate
"varies every year," according to
Powell. The number of students
committing suicide in any particu
lar academic year has varied from
zero to five or six, he said.
In 1974. Powell said, there were
seven self-inflicted deaths at
Harvard Over the next two years,
however, there were no suicides
there, he said
"We've had no suicides so far
this year," Powell added,
As a "rule of thumb." for everv

one or two suicides at the univer
sity there are probably 20 other
people hospitalized for suicide at
tempts and about 30 to 40 others
who "made a gesture" toward sui
cide. he said
Dorosin said that it is difficult to
distinguish between attempted sui
cides and gestures.
Publicity at Cornell
One university. Cornell, has re
ceived much adverse publicity be
cause of suicides there.
"It's our topography more than
anything else," said Dr William
White, director of psychological
services at Cornell's Gannett
Health Center When a student
jumps from a bridge or into a steep
gorge — as has happened at Cornell
— it is bound to attract more atten
tion than a suicide by some other
less spectacular means, White
said.
Cornell students also face "in
ordinately" bad weather during the
winter and what White called
"tertiary" problems — pressure
and competitiveness A student
will sometimes think "I've done
exactly what I'm supposed to do
but I'm not getting into medical
school," White said
Dramatic deaths
Because of the dramatic way in
which a few Cornell students have
taken their lives, the suicide rate
for the school has been vastly over
stated, White said Out of a student
