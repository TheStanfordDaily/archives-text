## Chun eases censorship in Korea; permits stories of Washington visit 
### Washington Post 
Seoul, South Korea — For the
first time in more than a year.
South Koreans are able to read
uncensored news reports about
their country in foreign news
papers and periodicals.
Two American news
magazines, Time and News
week, and the Hong Kong-based
Far Eastern Economic Review
appeared on newsstands here
last week with extensive stories
on South Korea, none of which
had been tailored by the
censor's scissors.
It marked the first time since
October 1979. when President
Park Chung Hee was as
sassinated, that foreign jour
nals had appeared for sale un
censored.
After his death, military lead
ers taking over the government

assigned censors to clip out of
fending articles paragraph by
paragraph. For months,
through a military crackdown
last May and a bloody insurrec
tion in Kwangju, censors either
snipped out items or banned en
tire issues.
A government spokesman ac
knowledged that there had been
a change in policy this year, in
keeping with President Chun
Doo-hwan's assertion that
censorship was a thing of the
past.
The government has said that
with the lifting of martial law
last month there will be no more
censorship of any kind. How
ever, major Seoul newspapers
have been instructed in con
siderable detail as to what they
can print. A government agent
has been assigned as "liaison"

with each publication, and edi
tors expect retaliation if they do
not obey the guidelines.
In a sweeping reorganization
of the news media last fall,
Chun's government took control
of all national television and ra
dio broadcasting systems. What
South Koreans hear now is what
the government wants them to
hear.
Meanwhile, government
sources hinted this week that
Chun, who was assured of a sev
en-year term »as president by
this month's election, is plan
ning new moves to loosen re
strictions.
The sources said he was ex
pected to eliminate some re
strictions on foreign travel for
South Koreans, who have long
chafed at rules preventing their
leaving the country except for
specific, government-approved
reasons.
Chun also is expected to an
nounce an amnesty for a
number of political prisoners
when he is inaugurated early
next month. There was specula
tion that there would be a reduc
tion in the life sentence for the
opposition leader. Kim Dae
Jung, although some sources

cautioned reporters not to ex
pect it.
Kim was sentenced to death
on sedition charges, but the sen
tence was commuted to life im
prisonment last month.
The reported liberalization
measures are described by
knowledgable sources as re
flecting Chun's feeling that a
largely successful state visit to
Washington has made him popu
lar enough to move away from
hard-line supporters
Lifting censorship of foreign
publications was the first step,
they said. "Everybody agreed
that there had been a lot of silly
stuff (in the censorship) any
way," one source said.
Most of the stories left intact
this week dealt with Chun's
Washington visit and the prom
ises of support he received from
President Ronald Reagan.
However, a few un
complimentary remarks sur
vived in print, and one magazine
explained the international up
roar over Kim Dae Jung's death
sentence. Neivsweek also car
ried pictures of North Korean
President Kim II Sung and of
schoolchildren singing his
praises.
