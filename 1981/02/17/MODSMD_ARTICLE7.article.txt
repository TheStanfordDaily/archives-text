C atching some rays
Rows of mirrors catch the sun's rays at the Eurelios sun energy plant near Adranos, Sicily.
The 182 mirrors reflect the sun to a tower (in background), which converts the rays into elec
tricity. The power plant is a joint enterprise of the European community and Italy, France and
West Germany. The installation, which has an output of one megawatt, cost about $14 million.
