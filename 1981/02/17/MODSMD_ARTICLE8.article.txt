# Europe groans under weight of social welfare upkeep
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Brussels, Belgium — Western Europe's industrial
democracies are struggling to maintain*their mam
moth, expensive social welfare programs at the same
time that they are fighting to overcome a recession that
has cut deeper than they expected.
Fearful of raising their high taxes any higher, the
countries are for the first time in postwar history cut
ting social welfare spending and borrowing heavily to
make up budget deficits.
The effect of that has been to increase labor tension
and embitter partisan politics. The crisis has also
pinched Western Europe's ability to spend for defense.
Given the social and economic structure of Europe,
any return to the heady days of expanding social bene
fits and rising living standards may be far in the future.
Europe's budget cutting is modest compared with
what the Reagan administration plans to do. because
European budgets provide for much less discretionary
spending than in the United States.
The economic problems of Britain have received the
most attention, but the smaller countries are suffering
nearly as much. Belgium has the Continent's highest
rate of unemployment and has been swept by a series of
regional strikes held to protest the government's at
tempts to stabilize the economy.
British political leaders are sharply divided over how
to deal with economic problems — the British Labor
Party's leadership has split on the issue — and the West
German governing coalition is torn partly because of
the country's stagnant economy and inability to finance
new social programs.
Impact
The European problems include a more severe im
pact from higher oil prices than in the United States, a
recession in inefficient, aged and over-sized traditional
industries, a lack of new investment and a falling rate
of population growth.
While some of those problems are shared by the Unit
ed States, Europe's ability to cope with them is ham
pered by political divisions on the Continent and a so
cial and economic rigidity unknown in the United
States.
Europe's dilemma was underscored recently when
the European Parliament added a total of $380 million
to the budget of the Common Market, mostly for social
programs. Because their individual governments are
limited in their ability to increase spending on social
programs, members of the European Parliament were
turning to the 10-member community, of which the
Common Market is a part.
France. West Germany and Belgium have refused to
contribute their share of the additional $380 million,
and the case will go to the European Court for adjudica
tion.
Social programs
At the core of the European malaise is the high cost
of maintaining the many social welfare programs built

up since World War 11, a period in which Europe ac
complished a remarkable rebuilding task and regained
economic strength and confidence.
After the war, the Europeans of nearly every
policital persuasion agreed that their postwar societies
should remove as many of the economic risks of daily
life as possible. And. following the example of Sweden,
which was able to finance its many programs partly be
cause it had stayed out of the war, the richer European
states built what they called social democracies.
All are characterized by free or nearly free medical
care and education through the university level, gener
ous unemployment and retirement benefits and strong
laws against discharging workers.
Some countries have added a staggering collection of
other programs — direct payments to individuals or
subsidies for rent, and the operation of state services,
including railroads, airlines and industries.
Many countries pay "milk money" to mothers re
gardless of their income status. A mother of four in
Belgium, for instance, receives more than $5000 a year
tax free.
All those social programs are financed with high tax
es on workers and employers, and comparing the total
of those taxes with a country's gross national product,
which is the sum of a country's goods and services,
gives an indication of the extent of that country's com
mitment to social programs.
The governments have learned that while big social
benefits are popular, the taxes needed to support them
are not And the level of tax cheating rises in direct re
-1 fit ion to the increase in revenues.
In Belgium, for instance, one authority estimated
last year that the volume of tax avoidance was twice
the deficit in the national budget of 100 billion francs —
the equivalent of about $6 billion.
In order to meet the rising cost of their social pro
grams. Europe's social democracies turned first to
public borrowing. Only recently have they tried to limit
spending.
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
taken the lead in trying to dismantle social programs.
But she has not been able to reduce the need to borrow
money.
In other countries, governments have done more for
eign borrowing to avoid upsetting more than necessary
the management of their economies while still financ
ing their deficits.
Unemployment
While the social programs are expensive, it is the ad
dition of unexpectedly heavy unemployment payments
that has caused the biggest shock for the Europeans.
Unemployment compensation in Europe more close
ly resembles a public welfare program than the re
stricted system to which Americans are accustomed.
In addition to covering nearly all workers, European

unemployment benefits pay a higher proportion of
wages than the U.S. system.
The average unemployment benefit in the United
States is about 34 percent of wages. In the Netherlands,
unemployment pays 80 percent of wages; in France 70
percent; in Denmark, 65percent; Belgium, 55percent;
Germany, 47 percent; and Britain, 45 percent.
More than 7 million people are unemployed in the
Common Market, close to 7 percent of the work force,
and the rate will continue to rise, according to official
estimates, to as many as 12 million people, or 10.5 per
cent, in 1985.
While unemployment and other social benefits serve
as a cushion, maintaining incomes in slack times, they
are not enough to finance an economic recovery. They
probably prevent Europe from having the sharp type of
slowdown the United States experienced last year, but
they are also generous enough in some countries to dis
courage people from taking a job.
Still, the cost of financing the programs cannot be
avoided. Unlike income taxes, which rise and fall with
profits, and value-added (sales) taxes, which depend on
turnover of goods, social secuirty taxes are based on
payrolls.
In the United States, both employer and employee
make the same contribution, which is currently 6.13
percent on an annual salary of $15,000.
German workers at a comparable level pay 16.5 per
cent and their employers 17.5 percent, for a total tax of
34 percent — nearly three times the U.S. figure.
In Denmark the total payment is only 6 percent. In
France the individual pays 11 percent and the employer
40 percent of a comparable wage.
Denmark has suffered the greatest change in life
style so far in the recession, with private consumption
reduced by 4 percent last year alone. The coalition gov
ernment has tightened welfare spending by cutting sub
sidies to local governments and tightening rules for
eligibility to receive benefits.
In Sweden, local government payments are being re
duced, along with subsidies for food and interest on
home mortgages. The government also aims to reduce
income taxes to a maximum rate of 50 percent from the
present 80 percent.
In Belgium, the government is attempting to freeze
wage levels and reduce social security spending by
eliminating abuses. A campaign against tax cheating is
under way.
Germany, with a cap on public spending, is under
pressure to shift money from its defense budget to so
cial areas. The argument is a major element in the split
between the left and right wings of the Social Demo
cratic Party of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
France, too, is attempting to hold down public spend
ing but, with a national election approaching, is taking
no new initiatives beyond the frugal policy in effect the
last few years.

Europe's dilemma was underscored recently when
the European Parliament added a total of $380 million
to the budget of the Common Market, mostly for social
programs. Because their individual governments are
limited in their ability to increase spending on social
programs, members of the European Parliament were
turning to the 10-member community, of which the
Common Market is a part.
France. West Germany and Belgium have refused to
contribute their share of the additional $380 million,
and the case will go to the European Court for adjudica

Social programs
At the core of the European malaise is the high cost
of maintaining the many social welfare programs built

up since World War 11, a period in which Europe ac
complished a remarkable rebuilding task and regained
economic strength and confidence.
After the war, the Europeans of nearly every
policital persuasion agreed that their postwar societies
should remove as many of the economic risks of daily
life as possible. And. following the example of Sweden,
which was able to finance its many programs partly be
cause it had stayed out of the war, the richer European
states built what they called social democracies.
All are characterized by free or nearly free medical
care and education through the university level, gener
ous unemployment and retirement benefits and strong
laws against discharging workers.
Some countries have added a staggering collection of
other programs — direct payments to individuals or
subsidies for rent, and the operation of state services,
including railroads, airlines and industries.
Many countries pay "milk money" to mothers re
gardless of their income status. A mother of four in
Belgium, for instance, receives more than $5000 a year
tax free.
All those social programs are financed with high tax
es on workers and employers, and comparing the total
of those taxes with a country's gross national product,
which is the sum of a country's goods and services,
gives an indication of the extent of that country's com
mitment to social programs.
The governments have learned that while big social
benefits are popular, the taxes needed to support them
are not And the level of tax cheating rises in direct re
-1 fit ion to the increase in revenues.
In Belgium, for instance, one authority estimated
last year that the volume of tax avoidance was twice
the deficit in the national budget of 100 billion francs —
the equivalent of about $6 billion.
In order to meet the rising cost of their social pro
grams. Europe's social democracies turned first to
public borrowing. Only recently have they tried to limit
spending.
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
taken the lead in trying to dismantle social programs.
But she has not been able to reduce the need to borrow
money.
In other countries, governments have done more for
eign borrowing to avoid upsetting more than necessary
the management of their economies while still financ
ing their deficits.
Unemployment
While the social programs are expensive, it is the ad
dition of unexpectedly heavy unemployment payments
that has caused the biggest shock for the Europeans.
Unemployment compensation in Europe more close
ly resembles a public welfare program than the re
stricted system to which Americans are accustomed.
In addition to covering nearly all workers, European

unemployment benefits pay a higher proportion of
wages than the U.S. system.
The average unemployment benefit in the United
States is about 34 percent of wages. In the Netherlands,
unemployment pays 80 percent of wages; in France 70
percent; in Denmark, 65percent; Belgium, 55percent;
Germany, 47 percent; and Britain, 45 percent.
More than 7 million people are unemployed in the
Common Market, close to 7 percent of the work force,
and the rate will continue to rise, according to official
estimates, to as many as 12 million people, or 10.5 per
cent, in 1985.
While unemployment and other social benefits serve
as a cushion, maintaining incomes in slack times, they
are not enough to finance an economic recovery. They
probably prevent Europe from having the sharp type of
slowdown the United States experienced last year, but
they are also generous enough in some countries to dis
courage people from taking a job.
Still, the cost of financing the programs cannot be
avoided. Unlike income taxes, which rise and fall with
profits, and value-added (sales) taxes, which depend on
turnover of goods, social secuirty taxes are based on
payrolls.
In the United States, both employer and employee
make the same contribution, which is currently 6.13
percent on an annual salary of $15,000.
German workers at a comparable level pay 16.5 per
cent and their employers 17.5 percent, for a total tax of
34 percent — nearly three times the U.S. figure.
In Denmark the total payment is only 6 percent. In
France the individual pays 11 percent and the employer
40 percent of a comparable wage.
Denmark has suffered the greatest change in life
style so far in the recession, with private consumption
reduced by 4 percent last year alone. The coalition gov
ernment has tightened welfare spending by cutting sub
sidies to local governments and tightening rules for
eligibility to receive benefits.
In Sweden, local government payments are being re
duced, along with subsidies for food and interest on
home mortgages. The government also aims to reduce
income taxes to a maximum rate of 50 percent from the
present 80 percent.
In Belgium, the government is attempting to freeze
wage levels and reduce social security spending by
eliminating abuses. A campaign against tax cheating is
under way.
Germany, with a cap on public spending, is under
pressure to shift money from its defense budget to so
cial areas. The argument is a major element in the split
between the left and right wings of the Social Demo
cratic Party of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
France, too, is attempting to hold down public spend
ing but, with a national election approaching, is taking
no new initiatives beyond the frugal policy in effect the
last few years.
Brussels, Belgium — Western Europe's industrial
democracies are struggling to maintain*their mam
moth, expensive social welfare programs at the same
time that they are fighting to overcome a recession that
has cut deeper than they expected.
Fearful of raising their high taxes any higher, the
countries are for the first time in postwar history cut
ting social welfare spending and borrowing heavily to
make up budget deficits.
The effect of that has been to increase labor tension
and embitter partisan politics. The crisis has also
pinched Western Europe's ability to spend for defense.
Given the social and economic structure of Europe,
any return to the heady days of expanding social bene
fits and rising living standards may be far in the future.
Europe's budget cutting is modest compared with
what the Reagan administration plans to do. because
European budgets provide for much less discretionary
spending than in the United States.
The economic problems of Britain have received the
most attention, but the smaller countries are suffering
nearly as much. Belgium has the Continent's highest
rate of unemployment and has been swept by a series of
regional strikes held to protest the government's at
tempts to stabilize the economy.
British political leaders are sharply divided over how
to deal with economic problems — the British Labor
Party's leadership has split on the issue — and the West
German governing coalition is torn partly because of
the country's stagnant economy and inability to finance
new social programs.
Impact
The European problems include a more severe im
pact from higher oil prices than in the United States, a
recession in inefficient, aged and over-sized traditional
industries, a lack of new investment and a falling rate
of population growth.
While some of those problems are shared by the Unit
ed States, Europe's ability to cope with them is ham
pered by political divisions on the Continent and a so
cial and economic rigidity unknown in the United
States.

gives an indication of the extent of that country's com
mitment to social programs.
The governments have learned that while big social
benefits are popular, the taxes needed to support them
are not And the level of tax cheating rises in direct re
-1 fit ion to the increase in revenues.
In Belgium, for instance, one authority estimated
last year that the volume of tax avoidance was twice
the deficit in the national budget of 100 billion francs —
the equivalent of about $6 billion.
In order to meet the rising cost of their social pro
grams. Europe's social democracies turned first to
public borrowing. Only recently have they tried to limit
spending.
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
taken the lead in trying to dismantle social programs.
But she has not been able to reduce the need to borrow
money.
In other countries, governments have done more for
eign borrowing to avoid upsetting more than necessary
the management of their economies while still financ
ing their deficits.
Unemployment
While the social programs are expensive, it is the ad
dition of unexpectedly heavy unemployment payments
that has caused the biggest shock for the Europeans.
Unemployment compensation in Europe more close
ly resembles a public welfare program than the re
stricted system to which Americans are accustomed.
In addition to covering nearly all workers, European

unemployment benefits pay a higher proportion of
wages than the U.S. system.
The average unemployment benefit in the United
States is about 34 percent of wages. In the Netherlands,
unemployment pays 80 percent of wages; in France 70
percent; in Denmark, 65percent; Belgium, 55percent;
Germany, 47 percent; and Britain, 45 percent.
More than 7 million people are unemployed in the
Common Market, close to 7 percent of the work force,
and the rate will continue to rise, according to official
estimates, to as many as 12 million people, or 10.5 per
cent, in 1985.
While unemployment and other social benefits serve
as a cushion, maintaining incomes in slack times, they
are not enough to finance an economic recovery. They
probably prevent Europe from having the sharp type of
slowdown the United States experienced last year, but
they are also generous enough in some countries to dis
courage people from taking a job.
Still, the cost of financing the programs cannot be
avoided. Unlike income taxes, which rise and fall with
profits, and value-added (sales) taxes, which depend on
turnover of goods, social secuirty taxes are based on
payrolls.
In the United States, both employer and employee
make the same contribution, which is currently 6.13
percent on an annual salary of $15,000.
German workers at a comparable level pay 16.5 per
cent and their employers 17.5 percent, for a total tax of
34 percent — nearly three times the U.S. figure.
In Denmark the total payment is only 6 percent. In
France the individual pays 11 percent and the employer
40 percent of a comparable wage.
Denmark has suffered the greatest change in life
style so far in the recession, with private consumption
reduced by 4 percent last year alone. The coalition gov
ernment has tightened welfare spending by cutting sub
sidies to local governments and tightening rules for
eligibility to receive benefits.
In Sweden, local government payments are being re
duced, along with subsidies for food and interest on
home mortgages. The government also aims to reduce
income taxes to a maximum rate of 50 percent from the
present 80 percent.
In Belgium, the government is attempting to freeze
wage levels and reduce social security spending by
eliminating abuses. A campaign against tax cheating is
under way.
Germany, with a cap on public spending, is under
pressure to shift money from its defense budget to so
cial areas. The argument is a major element in the split
between the left and right wings of the Social Demo
cratic Party of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
France, too, is attempting to hold down public spend
ing but, with a national election approaching, is taking
no new initiatives beyond the frugal policy in effect the
last few years.
