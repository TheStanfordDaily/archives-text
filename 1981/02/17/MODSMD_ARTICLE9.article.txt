# Pontiff arrives amid Philippines' turmoil
## 
### 
Manila, Philippines (AP) —
Anti-government demonstra
tions led by priests and nuns, the
bloodiest guerrilla raids in
years and a new political
challenge to the authoritarian
Philippines regime have set the
stage for Pope John Paul ll's
first major stop on his Asian pil
grimage.
Each of the nine Philippine
cities the pope is visiting will
put on an elaborate and costly
welcome with arches, thrones
and papal colors. Radio and tel
evision announcements urge:
"Let us prepare for the great
visit." Banners reading "Tutus
Tuus." Latin for "I'm all
yours," hang from lampposts
and buildings.
John Paul leaves the Philip
pines Feb. 22 for an overnight
stop in Guam and then visits
Japan until Feb. 27 in his first
visit to Asia as pope.
Here, John Paul will step into
a country of political and social
tension, touched off Jan. 17
when President Ferdinand
Marcos declared an end to eight
years of martial law.
Marcos remains the domi
nant force in Philippine politics,
retaining his near-dictatorial
powers. In recent days he has
announced plans for a presiden
tial election in May.
Associates of one possible op
position candidate, former Sen.
Benigno Aquino, have said he
may return "before, after or

with'' the pope to challenge
Marcos. Aquino, in exile in the
United States, faces terrorism
charges and a possible death
sentence.
Marcos has organized a vast
political machine under martial
law,-while the opposition holds
only a handful of local offices.
The papal visit has brought
church and state together tem
porarily, but some clerics say
they want to be sure the pope
hears about alleged repression
under Marcos.
Priests and nuns carrying a
giant wooden cross led 2500
demonstrators in a brief clash
with riot police Friday in the
largest of several street pro
tests since the lifting of martial
rule.
Renewed violence by guer
rillas seeking independence for
the predominantly Moslem
southern Philippines is ex
pected to draw the pope's atten
tion as he visits the island of
Mindanao.
The pope is to address repre
sentatives of Moslem tribes in
his visit to the southern Mind
anao city of Davao. In other
cities, the pope is to speak to
sugar workers, their bosses,
farmers, students and Indo
chinese refugees.
He will also spend two hours
with Marcos, who is Catholic,
his wife, Imelda, and their three
children at Malacanang Palace.
