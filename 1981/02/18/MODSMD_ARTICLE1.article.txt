## Abel analyzes U.N. press pact

Speaking on the topic "Politics of
International News," Communication
Prof. Elie Abel asserted that he does
not advocate U.S. withdrawal from
UNESCO but said that "we must stay
and listen and fight'for what we be
lieve."
Abel, speaking last night in the
Round Room of Memorial Church as
part of the Distinguished Faculty Fo
rum. presented what he called "a per
plexing set of issues in a new arena of
international politics." He said in the
field of international communication
policy "has simply not kept pace with
the blistering speed of technological
development over the last 10 to 15
years."
(UNESCO is a United Nations agen
cy whose members are discussing a
proposed code for regulating interna
tional information and communica
tion.)
Abel, who has received both the
Peabody Award for Broadcast Jour
nalism and the Pulitzer Prize, said it
is not the facts concerning the im
balance in news flow which are seri
ously in dispute but the proposed rem
edies. The United States, he said, ex
ports twice as many television pro
grams as all other exporting countries
put together, leads the world in com
puter and satellite technology, and is
the largest distributor of motion pic
tures. It is not disputed that roughly
two-thirds of humankind lacks access
to the modern communication sys
tems, according to Abel. What is de
bated, however, is the U.N. General
Assembly's adoption of a "new world
information and communication or
der" which Abel calls "more slogan
than plan of action" and which, he
says, is an attempt "to apply, on a
global scale, the principle of dis
tributive justice."
Abel said he feels one of the prob
lems arises from regional differences
as to the meaning of the term "new in
formation order." For example, he
said, Latin American radicals see it as
"a blueprint for dispossessing the rich
and powerful owners of advertiser
supported newspapers, in their own
countries."
Africa, however, which is the
poorest continent in terms of its media

according to Abel, views the "new or
der" as an opportunity for aid in ac
quiring materials with which they can
build their own communications sys
tem, help in training their media tech
nicians and professionals and hope for
more systematic and sympathetic
coverage of the country by foreign
journalists.
Abel said that proponents of the
"new order" who believe that people
of developing countries are "passive
receivers ... in a tidal wave of un
wanted, irrelevant and alien informa
tion" are mistaken, and that more
often than not, the subscriber is the
government itself which seeks to con
trol the flow of ideas, keeping much of
it for "official use."
In these countries, said Abel, the
new order is a "fresh excuse for op
pressive rulers to tighten their con
trols" of journalists.
"When government becomes the
judge of journalistic ethics, we are on
the slippery slope to an international
system of mind control," said Abel.
Abel said that the idea of licensing
journalists,, pursued by UNESCO,
would not have any effect in practical
terms except "to exclude from the
practice of journalism those who do
not happen to share your own ideol

ogical and practical views." Carrying
a UNESCO identification card would
not save a journalist's life, according
to Abel. "In the real world, journalists
are in danger whenever they tell the
world they're journalists," he said.
What is at stake in the debate, ac
cording to Abel, is a world less open
than the one today, a less informed
world where developing countries
may feel free to censor their own me
dia. and our major computer and high
technology companies. "I do not be
lieve in the state making decisions
having to do with products of the hu
man mind," said Abel, who suggested
that in countries where U.S. programs
are cheaper than homemade produc
tion and nave mass audience appeal,
an attempt should be made to build
self-reliant media by starting slowly
instead of trying to keep pace with
American standards.
"I believe it is time to take UN
ESCO matters more seriously, said
Abel. "We have a right and a need to
demand stronger representation."
Abel said that while American media
needs to be more sensitive and while
policy makers should discuss aid with
sympathy and generosity, free speech
and press rights should not be com
promised.
