# Sexual harassment policy to be adopted presently
## State to submit sexual harassment policy 
### Los Angeles Times 
Sacramento, Calif. — A casu
al pat on the backside. The
boss's suggestion that a female
employee work alone with him
past normal quitting time. The
lecherous leer.
Those traditional symbols of
sexual harassment at the work
place may soon be joined in the
office of California state gov
ernment by such things as im
peding movement, sexually sug
gestive cartoons, smutty jokes
and even possibly winking. And,
all will be prohibited.
State government for the first
time is about to adopt a strict
policy on sexual harassment.
Drafters of the proposed policy
term sexual harassment a
"form of sexual discrimina
tion," which long has been out
lawed.
Violators of the policy would
be subject to unspecified dis

ciplinary actions that could in
clude a reprimand, demotion,
and in severe cases, suspension
and dismissal.
Until now, California state
government went without a poli
cy specifically prohibiting sex
ual harassment of its employ
ees. The federal government re
cently ordered the states to
adopt one.
Added impetus for California
to act was provided by the wide
ly publicized case of Mary
Lebrato, a state psychologist,
who said she was propositioned
by her boss at a Christmas party
in 1978. She refused his ad
vances, which she said was ac
companied by a threat, then
filed a complaint and subse
quently was denied a promotion.
The proposed policy will be
submitted Feb. 25-26 to the State
Personnel Board for adoption
and virtually will have the force

of law. It will apply to the entire
state workforce, except higher
education employees whose ad
ministrators are developing
their own similar policy.
In draft form, which is not ex
pected to be changed substan
tially, the policy declares that
the state "is committed to pro
viding a work environment that
is free from all types of dis
crimination, including sexual
harassment, which is a form of
sex discrimination."
The proposal further states
that "all employees must be al
lowed to work in an environ
ment that is free from un
solicited and unwelcome sexual
overtones. This policy applies to
all state employees and pro
hibits sexual harassment in any
form, including written, verbal,
physical and or visual harass
ment."
It concludes: "Violations of

this policy and of employee
rights to due process will not be
tolerated and will result in dis
ciplinary action."
The draft, closely modeled af
ter federal guidelines, also ad
vises on procedures to follow
when an employee believes that
he or she has been sexually
harassed.
Basically, sexual harassment
is defined as unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual
favors and "other verbal, visual
or physical conduct" which oc
curs under certain circum
stances.
These circumstances include
when submission to such con
duct is made a term or condition
of employment "either explicit
ly or implicitly"; or when sub
mission to or rejection of such
conduct is used as a basis for
making decisions affecting the
employee; or when such con
duct substantially interferes
with an individual's work per
formance and creates an "of
fensive working environment."
Sexual harassment, accord
ing to the guidelines, can in
clude suggestive or obscene let
ters, notes and invitations, de
rogatory comments, slurs,
jokes, epithets, touching, leer
ing, gestures and "display of
sexually suggestive objects or
pictures, cartoons or posters."
Likewise it can be offering
benefits such as promotions, fa
vorable performance reports
and desirable work shifts in ex
change for sexual favors. On the
flip side, sexual harassment can
be the imposition of reprisals or
making actual or implied
threats of reprisals for failure to
submit.
Laura Aguilera, chief of the
Personnel Board's public em
ployment and Affirmative Ac
tion division, said that although
only three formal complaints of
sexual harassment have
reached the board, "it is our
feeling that it is a widespread
statewide problem that we need
to address."

She said the impression that
the problem is widespread was
drawn from conversations with
affirmative action and women's
program officers throughout
the system. It also came from
telephone calls from persons
who complain informally of sex
ual harassment but stop short of
filing an action against the of
fender. Probably, such persons
believe they would be subject to
reprisal, she said.
Aguilera said that while wom
en are the primary victims of
sexual harassment, it is not lim
ited to them. She said the Per
sonnel Board has received calls
from homosexual employees
who believe they are victims
"based on their sexual orien
tation." None have formally
complained, however.
Aguilera, noting that pro
cedures already are in place for
processing employee com
plaints. said a single wink or
leer probably would not con
stitute valid grounds for the fil
ing of a sexual harassment com
plaint.
Rather, she said, the individ
ual who received the leer or
wink would have to make it
clear that such behavior was of
fensive or inappropriate. If the
action persisted, Aguilera said
the offended employee would
have the right to file a com
plaint.
"It all depends ori the situ
ation," she said. "As in all com
plaints, it woul be investigated
and if there was information to
substantiate the claims, there
would be some action. If there
was not, then it would probably
be recommended to be dis
missed as others are."
The case of Lebrato, who
holds a doctorate in experimen
tal psychology, appears to be
the first of its type to reach the
Personnel Board.
The board's staff investigated
the complaint and recom
mended in favor of Lebrato. The
Department of Developmental
Services, for which she worked,
challenged the findings, but said
it would not appeal the recom
mendations.
The case is pending before the
board and final action has not
been taken.
The board's staff said the su
perior who propositioned
Lebrato at the Christmas party
"appears not to have had a
direct role" in the process that
selected someone else to fill the
post she sought.
But it did conclude that she
had been discriminated against.
The investigation found that the
"evidence clearly established a
pattern of events that was lead
ing to the appointment of Dr.
Lebrato as the Evaluation Sec
tion chief; were it not for the
Christmas luncheon events and
the complaint, she would have
been appointed."
(The superior, Robert
Carillo, was disciplined follow
ing the Christmas party by
being put on extended probation
and having his salary docked.
The board staff's confidential
report was dated April 4, 1980

and he resigned in May, conten
ding his departure was un
related to the report.)
The board's Aguilera said
that while the federal govern
ment had ordered the state to
act and there was an increasing
"general recognition" of the
problem, Lebrato's case played
a role in drafting the sexual
harassment policy.
"We have considered her
case as a real example of how
this should work," Aguilera
said. "Yes, we have taken that
particular case into considera
tion in formulating our policy.'!
As for Lebrato, she said she is
basically satisfied with what
she has seen and heard of the
draft policy. She takes issue,
however, with some of the pro*
cedures involved in processing a
complaint.
For her part, Aguilera said
the most difficult issue to over
come lies ahead.
"I think even when we have
such a policy adopted in all de
partments, it still will be very
difficult for someone to file such
a complaint given the per
ceptions that exist in terms of
reprisals," she said.

place may soon be joined in the
office of California state gov
ernment by such things as im
peding movement, sexually sug
gestive cartoons, smutty jokes
and even possibly winking. And,
all will be prohibited.
State government for the first
time is about to adopt a strict
policy on sexual harassment.
Drafters of the proposed policy
term sexual harassment a
"form of sexual discrimina
tion," which long has been out
lawed.
Violators of the policy would
be subject to unspecified dis

ciplinary actions that could in
clude a reprimand, demotion,
and in severe cases, suspension
and dismissal.
Until now, California state
government went without a poli
cy specifically prohibiting sex
ual harassment of its employ
ees. The federal government re
cently ordered the states to
adopt one.
Added impetus for California
to act was provided by the wide
ly publicized case of Mary
Lebrato, a state psychologist,
who said she was propositioned
by her boss at a Christmas party
in 1978. She refused his ad
vances, which she said was ac
companied by a threat, then
filed a complaint and subse
quently was denied a promotion.
The proposed policy will be
submitted Feb. 25-26 to the State
Personnel Board for adoption
and virtually will have the force

of law. It will apply to the entire
state workforce, except higher
education employees whose ad
ministrators are developing
their own similar policy.
In draft form, which is not ex
pected to be changed substan
tially, the policy declares that
the state "is committed to pro
viding a work environment that
is free from all types of dis
crimination, including sexual
harassment, which is a form of
sex discrimination."
The proposal further states
that "all employees must be al
lowed to work in an environ
ment that is free from un
solicited and unwelcome sexual
overtones. This policy applies to
all state employees and pro
hibits sexual harassment in any
form, including written, verbal,
physical and or visual harass
ment."
It concludes: "Violations of

this policy and of employee
rights to due process will not be
tolerated and will result in dis
ciplinary action."
The draft, closely modeled af
ter federal guidelines, also ad
vises on procedures to follow
when an employee believes that
he or she has been sexually
harassed.
Basically, sexual harassment
is defined as unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual
favors and "other verbal, visual
or physical conduct" which oc
curs under certain circum
stances.
These circumstances include
when submission to such con
duct is made a term or condition
of employment "either explicit
ly or implicitly"; or when sub
mission to or rejection of such
conduct is used as a basis for
making decisions affecting the
employee; or when such con
duct substantially interferes
with an individual's work per
formance and creates an "of
fensive working environment."
Sexual harassment, accord
ing to the guidelines, can in
clude suggestive or obscene let
ters, notes and invitations, de
rogatory comments, slurs,
jokes, epithets, touching, leer
ing, gestures and "display of
sexually suggestive objects or
pictures, cartoons or posters."
Likewise it can be offering
benefits such as promotions, fa
vorable performance reports
and desirable work shifts in ex
change for sexual favors. On the
flip side, sexual harassment can
be the imposition of reprisals or
making actual or implied
threats of reprisals for failure to
submit.
Laura Aguilera, chief of the
Personnel Board's public em
ployment and Affirmative Ac
tion division, said that although
only three formal complaints of
sexual harassment have
reached the board, "it is our
feeling that it is a widespread
statewide problem that we need
to address."

She said the impression that
the problem is widespread was
drawn from conversations with
affirmative action and women's
program officers throughout
the system. It also came from
telephone calls from persons
who complain informally of sex
ual harassment but stop short of
filing an action against the of
fender. Probably, such persons
believe they would be subject to
reprisal, she said.
Aguilera said that while wom
en are the primary victims of
sexual harassment, it is not lim
ited to them. She said the Per
sonnel Board has received calls
from homosexual employees
who believe they are victims
"based on their sexual orien
tation." None have formally
complained, however.
Aguilera, noting that pro
cedures already are in place for
processing employee com
plaints. said a single wink or
leer probably would not con
stitute valid grounds for the fil
ing of a sexual harassment com
plaint.
Rather, she said, the individ
ual who received the leer or
wink would have to make it
clear that such behavior was of
fensive or inappropriate. If the
action persisted, Aguilera said
the offended employee would
have the right to file a com
plaint.
"It all depends ori the situ
ation," she said. "As in all com
plaints, it woul be investigated
and if there was information to
substantiate the claims, there
would be some action. If there
was not, then it would probably
be recommended to be dis
missed as others are."
The case of Lebrato, who
holds a doctorate in experimen
tal psychology, appears to be
the first of its type to reach the
Personnel Board.
The board's staff investigated
the complaint and recom
mended in favor of Lebrato. The
Department of Developmental
Services, for which she worked,
challenged the findings, but said
it would not appeal the recom
mendations.
The case is pending before the
board and final action has not
been taken.
The board's staff said the su
perior who propositioned
Lebrato at the Christmas party
"appears not to have had a
direct role" in the process that
selected someone else to fill the
post she sought.
But it did conclude that she
had been discriminated against.
The investigation found that the
"evidence clearly established a
pattern of events that was lead
ing to the appointment of Dr.
Lebrato as the Evaluation Sec
tion chief; were it not for the
Christmas luncheon events and
the complaint, she would have
been appointed."
(The superior, Robert
Carillo, was disciplined follow
ing the Christmas party by
being put on extended probation
and having his salary docked.
The board staff's confidential
report was dated April 4, 1980

and he resigned in May, conten
ding his departure was un
related to the report.)
The board's Aguilera said
that while the federal govern
ment had ordered the state to
act and there was an increasing
"general recognition" of the
problem, Lebrato's case played
a role in drafting the sexual
harassment policy.
"We have considered her
case as a real example of how
this should work," Aguilera
said. "Yes, we have taken that
particular case into considera
tion in formulating our policy.'!
As for Lebrato, she said she is
basically satisfied with what
she has seen and heard of the
draft policy. She takes issue,
however, with some of the pro*
cedures involved in processing a
complaint.
For her part, Aguilera said
the most difficult issue to over
come lies ahead.
"I think even when we have
such a policy adopted in all de
partments, it still will be very
difficult for someone to file such
a complaint given the per
ceptions that exist in terms of
reprisals," she said.

policy on sexual harassment.
Drafters of the proposed policy
term sexual harassment a
"form of sexual discrimina
tion," which long has been out
lawed.
Violators of the policy would
be subject to unspecified dis

ciplinary actions that could in
clude a reprimand, demotion,
and in severe cases, suspension
and dismissal.
Until now, California state
government went without a poli
cy specifically prohibiting sex
ual harassment of its employ
ees. The federal government re
cently ordered the states to
adopt one.
Added impetus for California
to act was provided by the wide
ly publicized case of Mary
Lebrato, a state psychologist,
who said she was propositioned
by her boss at a Christmas party
in 1978. She refused his ad
vances, which she said was ac
companied by a threat, then
filed a complaint and subse
quently was denied a promotion.
The proposed policy will be
submitted Feb. 25-26 to the State
Personnel Board for adoption
and virtually will have the force

of law. It will apply to the entire
state workforce, except higher
education employees whose ad
ministrators are developing
their own similar policy.
In draft form, which is not ex
pected to be changed substan
tially, the policy declares that
the state "is committed to pro
viding a work environment that
is free from all types of dis
crimination, including sexual
harassment, which is a form of
sex discrimination."
The proposal further states
that "all employees must be al
lowed to work in an environ
ment that is free from un
solicited and unwelcome sexual
overtones. This policy applies to
all state employees and pro
hibits sexual harassment in any
form, including written, verbal,
physical and or visual harass
ment."
It concludes: "Violations of

this policy and of employee
rights to due process will not be
tolerated and will result in dis
ciplinary action."
The draft, closely modeled af
ter federal guidelines, also ad
vises on procedures to follow
when an employee believes that
he or she has been sexually
harassed.
Basically, sexual harassment
is defined as unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual
favors and "other verbal, visual
or physical conduct" which oc
curs under certain circum
stances.
These circumstances include
when submission to such con
duct is made a term or condition
of employment "either explicit
ly or implicitly"; or when sub
mission to or rejection of such
conduct is used as a basis for
making decisions affecting the
employee; or when such con
duct substantially interferes
with an individual's work per
formance and creates an "of
fensive working environment."
Sexual harassment, accord
ing to the guidelines, can in
clude suggestive or obscene let
ters, notes and invitations, de
rogatory comments, slurs,
jokes, epithets, touching, leer
ing, gestures and "display of
sexually suggestive objects or
pictures, cartoons or posters."
Likewise it can be offering
benefits such as promotions, fa
vorable performance reports
and desirable work shifts in ex
change for sexual favors. On the
flip side, sexual harassment can
be the imposition of reprisals or
making actual or implied
threats of reprisals for failure to
submit.
Laura Aguilera, chief of the
Personnel Board's public em
ployment and Affirmative Ac
tion division, said that although
only three formal complaints of
sexual harassment have
reached the board, "it is our
feeling that it is a widespread
statewide problem that we need
to address."

She said the impression that
the problem is widespread was
drawn from conversations with
affirmative action and women's
program officers throughout
the system. It also came from
telephone calls from persons
who complain informally of sex
ual harassment but stop short of
filing an action against the of
fender. Probably, such persons
believe they would be subject to
reprisal, she said.
Aguilera said that while wom
en are the primary victims of
sexual harassment, it is not lim
ited to them. She said the Per
sonnel Board has received calls
from homosexual employees
who believe they are victims
"based on their sexual orien
tation." None have formally
complained, however.
Aguilera, noting that pro
cedures already are in place for
processing employee com
plaints. said a single wink or
leer probably would not con
stitute valid grounds for the fil
ing of a sexual harassment com
plaint.
Rather, she said, the individ
ual who received the leer or
wink would have to make it
clear that such behavior was of
fensive or inappropriate. If the
action persisted, Aguilera said
the offended employee would
have the right to file a com
plaint.
"It all depends ori the situ
ation," she said. "As in all com
plaints, it woul be investigated
and if there was information to
substantiate the claims, there
would be some action. If there
was not, then it would probably
be recommended to be dis
missed as others are."
The case of Lebrato, who
holds a doctorate in experimen
tal psychology, appears to be
the first of its type to reach the
Personnel Board.
The board's staff investigated
the complaint and recom
mended in favor of Lebrato. The
Department of Developmental
Services, for which she worked,
challenged the findings, but said
it would not appeal the recom
mendations.
The case is pending before the
board and final action has not
been taken.
The board's staff said the su
perior who propositioned
Lebrato at the Christmas party
"appears not to have had a
direct role" in the process that
selected someone else to fill the
post she sought.
But it did conclude that she
had been discriminated against.
The investigation found that the
"evidence clearly established a
pattern of events that was lead
ing to the appointment of Dr.
Lebrato as the Evaluation Sec
tion chief; were it not for the
Christmas luncheon events and
the complaint, she would have
been appointed."
(The superior, Robert
Carillo, was disciplined follow
ing the Christmas party by
being put on extended probation
and having his salary docked.
The board staff's confidential
report was dated April 4, 1980

and he resigned in May, conten
ding his departure was un
related to the report.)
The board's Aguilera said
that while the federal govern
ment had ordered the state to
act and there was an increasing
"general recognition" of the
problem, Lebrato's case played
a role in drafting the sexual
harassment policy.
"We have considered her
case as a real example of how
this should work," Aguilera
said. "Yes, we have taken that
particular case into considera
tion in formulating our policy.'!
As for Lebrato, she said she is
basically satisfied with what
she has seen and heard of the
draft policy. She takes issue,
however, with some of the pro*
cedures involved in processing a
complaint.
For her part, Aguilera said
the most difficult issue to over
come lies ahead.
"I think even when we have
such a policy adopted in all de
partments, it still will be very
difficult for someone to file such
a complaint given the per
ceptions that exist in terms of
reprisals," she said.
