Cape Canaveral, Fla. (AP) — A crucial
countdown rehearsal began Monday night that
will determine if the space shuttle Columbia is
ready to carry two astronauts into orbit in April on
its maiden voyage.
The 2V2-day test, already delayed 24 hours, was
intended to exercise all elements of the shuttle's
system for the first time.
The countdown started at 7:15 p.m. EST when
electrical power was fed into the reusable space
vehicle.
If there are no problems, the test will end at
7:45 a.m. Thursday when the count reaches zero
and the space shuttle's three main engines are
fired for 20 seconds while the vehicle remains
locked on its launch pad.
The shuttle is targeted for its first launch on
April 7.
Late Monday afternoon, launch director
George Page gave the go-ahead for the formal
"call to stations," even though technicians still
were struggling with several problems.
"There is a potential problem with a backup en
gine controller for the No. 2 engine," said Ken
nedy Space Center spokesman Karl Christ
opherson. "We've been getting a low voltage read
ing but they believe they have solved the problem.
"They're also still working on the installation

of thermal tile around the tank nose cone, but that
should be finished by the end of the day,"he said.
The $8 billion program, already two years be
hind schedule, was hit by the latest delay Sunday
when officials agreed to postpone the test-firing
until Thursday because bad weather hampered
last-minute preparations.
Specialists manned computer consoles here, at
other National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration centers and at tracking stations around
the world.
Experts at the Kennedy Space Center con
ducted the actual count, while flight controllers at
the Johnson Space Center in Houston — where
April's flight will be controlled — monitored the
activity.
At Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville,
Ala., design specialists stood by to provide advice
on the shuttle engine systems.
The test includes all aspects of the launch
countdown except for the insertion of the
astronauts — John Young and Bob Crippen — in
Columbia's cockpit. During the practice, 526,000
pounds of liquid hydrogen and oxygen fuel were to
be pumped into the vehicle's external tank.
"A successful test will provide cbnfidence that
the space shuttle is ready for flight," said
Page.
