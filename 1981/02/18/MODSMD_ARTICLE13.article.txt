## Aid to El Salvador irrational 
### 
According to the article,
"U.S. ambassador White dis
missed by Gen. Haig," (Daily,
Feb 3), State Department
spokesman William Dyess re
iterated that aid to the right
wing j unta in El Salvador is like
ly to be increased. Such an of
ficial stance by the government
jof the United States portends
grave consequences — both for
the people of El Salvador and for
our hemispheric and global in
terests.
To understand the ramifica
! tions of increased aid to the mil
itary dictatorship in El
Salvador, one must first com
prehend the dynamics of the in
: ternal situation in that country.
El Salvador is the most densely
, populated country in the
i Western Hemisphere. Of the
, population, roughly two percent
owns 60 percent of the arable
land, creating obvious crowding
problems. In the area of health,
one in four children dies before
reaching the age of five, and a
1 majority of the population re
' ceives less than 60 percent of the
necessary daily caloric intake.
Repression in El Salvador is
well-documented. Amnesty In
ternational reports 8000 cases of
extra-legal abduction and as
sassinations of civilians by mili
tary and security forces in 1980.
Included in the assassinations
were the Archbishop of El
Salvador, the president of the
human rights commission of the
Archdiose of San Salvador,
* three American nuns, at least
four journalists, and the rector
1 'of the National University. Ac
cording to the Veic York Times,
the death toll reached at least
' r lo.ooo in 1980 alone. In many
' cases, these assassinations
Were carried out by para
military hit squads, using de
terrent techniques that included
■'displaying the mutilated
corpses of slain peasants in pub
lic places as warnings to the
general peasant populace.
Reformist efforts to curb
these problems in El Salvador
have produced, at best, negli
gible results. On October 15,
1979. a broad-based junta
formed in the wake of a coup d
etat against the military gov
ernment of General Carlos
Romero. In January. 1980. less
than four months after it£ for
mation. the civilian leadership
of the Salvadorean junta and all
the civilian cabinet ministers
resigned in protest over their in
ability to either curb military
' repression or enact promised
1 reforms.
T As these statistics suggest,
the forces molding the situation
in El Salvador are essentially
"internal. It is the complex
dynamics of desperate poverty
amongst the masses, coupled
with a loss of confidence in the
present, compromised junta's
ability to enact reform, plus ex
treme oppression by right-wing
paramilitary groups allied with
the junta that creates a revolu
tionary atmosphere.
This is not the scenario
painted in the American press
by U.S. government sources.
The simplistic State Depart
ment image is one of a widely
popular junta effectively work
ing to ameliorate social condi

tions but caught in the cross-fire
of extreme right-wing and left
wing, communist forces
However, as a dissent paper
prepared by members of the
CIA. Department of Defense.
Department of State, and the
National Security Council
posits, the junta that actually
embodied broad, cross-societal
representation — Social Demo
crats, Christian Democrats,
Communists, the labor move
ment, as well as the military —
collapsed in January, 1980. The
present junta is not moderate.
Rather, it is under the direction
of this junta that reform has
been blocked and thousands of
human beings have been killed.
What the State Department
purposefully labels moderate is
really, extremest-right.
Just as what the State Depart
ment labels moderate is not
moderate, the Democratic Rev
olutionary Front (FDR), which
the U.S. government and press
label left is not the "left" of
American political reality, but
something different and highly
complex. Following the col
lapse of the first junta and the
assassination of the archbishop,
the FDR has developed into a
wide-based coalition of Social
Democrats, youth segments of
the Christian Democrats. So
cialists. Communists, tradi
tional liberals, labor, and most
segments of the Church in El
Salvador. The urban middle
class appears either supportive
of the FDR, neutral, or has left
the country. Again, the sim
plistic labelling by the U.S. gov
ernment is both misleading and
inherently dishonest.
Evidence suggests that our
government intends to overtly
support an excessively brutal,
reactionary and exploitive re
gime. Such support only en
courages the violent tendencies
of the right-wing forces in El
Salvador. In November. 1980, a
sign left with the bullet-ridden
bodies of 54 young men and
women assassinated by the par
amilitary death squads read,
"With Ronald Reagan we will
finish the guerrillas and evil
doers in El Salvador and Central
America."
For the people of El Salvador,
the consequences of renewed
U.S. military aid (which in
cludes eight helicopters and
nine military advisors sent in
December as part of a five mil
lion dollar military aid pack
age* are certain to be immense
in terms of human suffering
For American interest, as the
aforementioned report in
dicates, disastrous conse
quences accompany continued
US support of the military jun
ta.
The history of popular, na
tionalistic uprisings in the past
two decades (i.e. Cuba. Viet
nam. Zimbabwe. Iran, and
Nicaragua) emphasize the
strength of nationalistic,
egalitarian movements in the
third world today. During this
same period the U.S. has sacri
ficed billions of dollars and
thousands of lives in an attempt
to maintain a tenuous status
quo, remained uncognizant of
changing economic realities in

many third world countries, and
slighted the problems of the peo
ple of these countries by re
sponding to elitist influence
rather than to the socio-struc
tural factors present within the
third world.
Such reliance on elitist in
fluence has led to the State De
partments preoccupation with
Hoover Institute-type theory
which explains third world pop
ular movements in communist
camouflage tactics terms. The
failure of this foreign policy has
left American credibility in
creasingly tarnished in the third
world, and has driven every vic
torious popular movement
away from neutrality into the
Soviet economic sphere (with
the exception of Nicaragua, an
exception the Reagan adminis
tration appears bent on destroy
ing).
The present situation in El
Salvador, like in Vietnam, con
tains regional implicatins. The
right-wing regimes of Honduras
and Guatemala both hold vested
interests in the survival of the
military dictatorship in El
Salvador. Representative of the
stake, that perceived in the con
flict was the Rio Sampul
massacre in May, 1980. Hon
duran troops stationed at the El
Salvador border forced 600 refu
gees to swim back across the
Rio Sampul where awaiting
Salvadorian troops gunned
down the group of men, women,
and children. As this incident in
dicates. coordination between
these governments is rather
well-developed and. as the
CIA/State Department dissent
paper reports, the United States
is the kingpin of this coordi
nated effort.
No doubt, the FDR receives
aid from Nicaragua. Cuba and
the Soviet Union. This is signifi
cant for two reasons. It poses
the possibility of the conflict es
calating and incorporating the
entire region, plus the super
powers. Also, the fact that the
popular movement receives aid
primarily from the Soviet
sphere strengthens the positions
of the radical left within the
broadly-based FDR.
Once again our government
attempts to prop up an op
pressive. unpopular regime de
spite its instability, despite the
fact that such support radical
izes the wide-based popular
movement, and despite the fact
that the popular front receives
the support of much of the West
and most of the third world. The
Social Democratic Party,
worldwide, including Willy
Brandt backs the FDR. Amnes
ty International, Long
shoremen and Warehouse
Workers, and 1300 professors
nationwide have called for an
end to U.S. military aid to the
junta in El Salvador.
Ignoring world and con
siderable national sentiment,
ignoring the ethical implica
tions of our policy, and ignoring
the dismal record of U.S. at
tempts to maintain the status
quo, the Reagan administration
naively supports the junta in a
tragic abrogation of common
sense.
