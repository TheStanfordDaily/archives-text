Military, not draft
David Miller's snide rebuke
(Daily, Feb. 12) of Bill Wray's
advocacy of the draft (Daily,
Feb. 2) requires comment due
to its unrealistic statement of
"current reality" as well as its
misrepresentation of the views

of those of us who oppose the
draft.
Miller is entirely correct in
his statement that any U.S. sup
port for foreign despots, right or
left wing, violates the ideals of
liberty which the U.S. was
founded upon. And, he is correct
when he suggest that the proper

role of the U.S. is to "serve as a
beacon to illuminate" the ideal
of a free society. However, to
suggest that the U.S. has no
need for the voluntary military
that Wray represents (as an of
ficer therein) and to heap abuse
and insult on that military is as
inane as it is tasteless.
Miller suggests that geogra
phy alone is sufficient to protect
our relatively free and prosper
ous society. I would like to be
there when he takes a U.S. his
tory class and discovers that the
U.S. was invaded by Britain, at
tacked by Japan, and had a war
with Mexico. He should also
take a look at the plans that
Hitler had for the invasion of the
U.S. and consider how close the
Nazis were to developing the
atomic bomb (which is still
alive and well in the hands of
some of our en
emies, in case he doesn't know).
Where are the hordes of foreign
devils eager and able to invade
the U.S.? Abolish the military
and disarm the country and you
will see them soon enough for a
few moments before you die.
The military is essential for

the protection of the country,
but it must be a voluntary force.
As one who was an under
graduate during the Vietnam
draft, I am fully aware of what
involuntary servitude in a mili
tary fighting a foreign war can
do. I can think of no law more
destructive to individual rights,
faith in one's government, not
love of country than the Selec
tive Service Act.
If you are not willing to de
fend your own freedom volun
tarily, then you don't deserve to
have it. but this is certainly not
a license for your government
or any other to take it away
from you. If someone defends
your freedom for you, you do, in
deed, owe them a debt of grat
itude. If you want to go defend
freedom in a foreign land (as
Bill Wray apparently does), go
ahead. But, when you use the
law to draft those unwilling to
go - you have destroyed in your
own homeland what you meant
to defend elsewhere.
