The following misprints appeared in David Miller's column
(Daily, Feb. 12):
"Rather, our opposition to foreign despots of any sort dese
crates and negates the ideals of liberty ..." should have
read. "Rather, our opposition to foreign intervention rests on
the conviction that U.S. support for foreign despots of any
sort desecrates and negates the ideals of liberty which Ameri
ca once symbolized."
In the paragraph, "But we should recognize that their free
dom is the gift not of boys like Wray playing soldier but rather
of men and women who pursue a realistic commitment to pre
serving American liberty," "gift" was replaced by "fight".
The Daily sincerely regrets the errors.
