## Chip Sandground Reform 'pre- professional' goals 
### 
What is most evident about
the state of college education in
America today is the rising per
centage of students involved in
"pre-professional" study pro
grams. One only needs to check
the statistics on the increasing
numbers of applicants to busi
ness, law, and medical schools
to realize that there must be an
equivalent upswing in the ranks
of the undergraduates prepar
ing for admission to these
sought-after institutions.
In light of this recent trend,
one obvious question to ask
would be, and what will (and, in
fact, already has) become of the
broad-based, liberal arts educa
tion? Believing that this most
rewarding and important type
of education is being increasing
ly neglected, the next logical
query to pose is: What are the
values of the liberal arts to
those preparing for careers that
are becoming more complex
and technical every year? The
direction that both our academ
ic goals and careers are taking
seems to be in need of drastic re
form.
Of all the undergraduate pro
fessional preparation regimes,
pre-med is often the most rigid,
competitive, and malign in its
affect on the students and their
aspirations.
The most common complaint
about the program, by both pre
meds and non-pre-meds alike, is
the fierce intensity and com
petitiveness of the courses. Re
ceipt of a "C" on a single mid
term has been known to cause

great anxieties and doubts
about whether or not one is cut
out for medicine. A legitimate
concern expressed by students
and interested observers is over
how the tension of grade pres
sures is handled. Too often this
competition (supposedly de
signed to encourage one's best
efforts) results in attitudes of
hostility and egocentricity by
the students. If we are, unwit
tingly or not, engendering these
types of emotions in those that
are to be the compassionate
healers of our society, are we
not doing something desper
ately wrong?
Another problem of at least
equal weight is that of the over
specialization that occurs early
on in a pre-med's education. So
onerous are the combined pre
requisites of physics,
mathematics, chemistry, and
biology that a student scarcely
has the time or motivation to
pursue other avenues of in
tellectual pursuit.
According to Carletoh Chap
man, President of the Com
monwealth Fund (New York),
an organization involved with
medical education, "The pre
med sciences now required
taken together are a
burdensome and stultifying ov
erkill . . . " A related concern to
the rigidity of their academic
requirements is that pre-meds
develop a dependency on having
things set out and mandated for
them to do. Will the conse
quences of training future phy
sicians to mechanistically fol
low the formula of basic memo
rization and regurgitation lead
to doctors inexperienced in in
dependence and free thought?
While the following proposals
are written with the hope of
amending certain aspects of
pre-med education, it is not sug
gested that the "core" classes
can be forsaken or radically al
tered. It is essential to provide a

solid science background for
those who will take up the study
of medicine.
No doubt it will always be
competitive to obtain admission
to medical school. With limited
places and more applicants an
nually, various standards must
be imposed to evaluate and
select the "best" candidates.
What has always been known by
Medical School evaluators yet
often neglected by students and
advisors is that the best can
didates are not necessarily
those that can boast the highest
science GPA's. A diversified
liberal arts education, sup
plementing what are recognized
as the standard, yet crucial,
background sciences, is an op
timal training program. On con
sideration, the benefits of such a
course of study extend beyond
merely supplying necessary re
lief to a relatively homogenous
all-science workload. Ideally,
students will be intellectually
stimulated by these courses,
and the kind of new ideas, per
spectives, and experiences they
encounter would be the catalyst
for personal reflection,
creativity, and innovation.
The newly established
"Western Culture" program be
gins to meet the necessity for
creating academic diversity in
all programs of study. As this
program is one year mandated
diversity, however, its success
is limited only to being able to
expose students briefly to new
ideas and hampered by the re
ality that it is a requirement.
The true task is still to en
courage students to create their
own challenges and diversity,
an objective that should not be
impossible for a creative and
well-informed advisor to meet.
As the "already pre-med"
freshman's first academic con
tact, the faculty advisor should
be an enthusiastic and en
couraging proponent of pro

grams of preparation other than
a narrow four year science ma
jor. It should be stressed that
liberal arts classes or majors
can be worked on concurrently
with the incipient pre-med re
quirements and that successful
applications are made by non
natural science majors. Ad
visors of students outside of
those that indicate pre-med ear
ly on might consider encourag
ing some whose natural diver
sity indicates the type of ap
titude best-suited for the in
terpersonal work that medicine
provides to start the pre-med se
quence (without fears that they
will be out-competed and devas
tated by hard-core pre-med).
With the proper advice and at
titude, the student interested in
studying medicine will be in a
position to,.truly explore the pro
fession in a personally construc
tive way, without the hang-ups
that can change a human, well
motivated individual into a
combative and often limited
one. In defense of the harshly
described latter type, most pre
med students are merely re
sponding to what they perceived
(or have been convinced) the
situation dictates when they at
tempt to out-compete the next
student to get in medical school.
Medicine is not a profession
to go into without a great deal of
personal introspection. The
lasting benefit of keeping stu
dents out of the four-year tunnel
that supposedly leads from col
lege to Medical School is that
they will be constantly
challenged to shape and re-de
fine the reason they want to be
doctors and to test that interest
with first-hand experience. It is
only when we feel drawn to ex
pand and analyze our interests
that honest and informed de
cisions can be made about per
sonal career choice.

will be out-competed and devas

With the proper advice and at

studying medicine will be in a
position to,.truly explore the pro

that can change a human, well
motivated individual into a

Medicine is not a profession

What is most evident about
the state of college education in
America today is the rising per
centage of students involved in
"pre-professional" study pro
grams. One only needs to check
the statistics on the increasing
numbers of applicants to busi
ness, law, and medical schools
to realize that there must be an
equivalent upswing in the ranks
of the undergraduates prepar
ing for admission to these
sought-after institutions.
In light of this recent trend,
one obvious question to ask
would be, and what will (and, in
fact, already has) become of the
broad-based, liberal arts educa
tion? Believing that this most
rewarding and important type
of education is being increasing
ly neglected, the next logical
query to pose is: What are the
values of the liberal arts to
those preparing for careers that
are becoming more complex
and technical every year? The
direction that both our academ
ic goals and careers are taking
seems to be in need of drastic re
form.
Of all the undergraduate pro
fessional preparation regimes,
pre-med is often the most rigid,
competitive, and malign in its
affect on the students and their
aspirations.
The most common complaint
about the program, by both pre
meds and non-pre-meds alike, is
the fierce intensity and com
petitiveness of the courses. Re
ceipt of a "C" on a single mid
term has been known to cause

great anxieties and doubts
about whether or not one is cut
out for medicine. A legitimate
concern expressed by students
and interested observers is over
how the tension of grade pres
sures is handled. Too often this
competition (supposedly de
signed to encourage one's best
efforts) results in attitudes of
hostility and egocentricity by
the students. If we are, unwit
tingly or not, engendering these
types of emotions in those that
are to be the compassionate
healers of our society, are we
not doing something desper
ately wrong?
Another problem of at least
equal weight is that of the over
specialization that occurs early
on in a pre-med's education. So
onerous are the combined pre
requisites of physics,
mathematics, chemistry, and
biology that a student scarcely
has the time or motivation to
pursue other avenues of in
tellectual pursuit.
According to Carletoh Chap
man, President of the Com
monwealth Fund (New York),
an organization involved with
medical education, "The pre
med sciences now required
taken together are a
burdensome and stultifying ov
erkill . . . " A related concern to
the rigidity of their academic
requirements is that pre-meds
develop a dependency on having
things set out and mandated for
them to do. Will the conse
quences of training future phy
sicians to mechanistically fol
low the formula of basic memo
rization and regurgitation lead
to doctors inexperienced in in
dependence and free thought?
While the following proposals
are written with the hope of
amending certain aspects of
pre-med education, it is not sug
gested that the "core" classes
can be forsaken or radically al
tered. It is essential to provide a

solid science background for
those who will take up the study
of medicine.
No doubt it will always be
competitive to obtain admission
to medical school. With limited
places and more applicants an
nually, various standards must
be imposed to evaluate and
select the "best" candidates.
What has always been known by
Medical School evaluators yet
often neglected by students and
advisors is that the best can
didates are not necessarily
those that can boast the highest
science GPA's. A diversified
liberal arts education, sup
plementing what are recognized
as the standard, yet crucial,
background sciences, is an op
timal training program. On con
sideration, the benefits of such a
course of study extend beyond
merely supplying necessary re
lief to a relatively homogenous
all-science workload. Ideally,
students will be intellectually
stimulated by these courses,
and the kind of new ideas, per
spectives, and experiences they
encounter would be the catalyst
for personal reflection,
creativity, and innovation.
The newly established
"Western Culture" program be
gins to meet the necessity for
creating academic diversity in
all programs of study. As this
program is one year mandated
diversity, however, its success
is limited only to being able to
expose students briefly to new
ideas and hampered by the re
ality that it is a requirement.
The true task is still to en
courage students to create their
own challenges and diversity,
an objective that should not be
impossible for a creative and
well-informed advisor to meet.
As the "already pre-med"
freshman's first academic con
tact, the faculty advisor should
be an enthusiastic and en
couraging proponent of pro

grams of preparation other than
a narrow four year science ma
jor. It should be stressed that
liberal arts classes or majors
can be worked on concurrently
with the incipient pre-med re
quirements and that successful
applications are made by non
natural science majors. Ad
visors of students outside of
those that indicate pre-med ear
ly on might consider encourag
ing some whose natural diver
sity indicates the type of ap
titude best-suited for the in
terpersonal work that medicine
provides to start the pre-med se
quence (without fears that they
will be out-competed and devas
