## Revamp placement interviews 
### 
The article on overcrowding at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center, (Daily, Feb. 4), con
tained some peculiar views on how to best handle
the allocation of on-campus interviews. Accord
ing to Ralph Keller, CPPC director, the problem
of students waiting in overnight lines to sign up for
a small number of interview time slots has oc
curred for a number of years.
The accompanying statement from President
Donald Kennedy's office is that the current first
come, first serve policy "clearly is not working."
The obvious question is: If the current system is
failing to work effectively and has been for years,
why isn't it being revamped?
Keller's response to this question is that each
new system that has been considered has disad
vantages for certain groups of students and that
until a better alternative is proposed, there is no
use in changing the current policy. Keller's opinin
is that the "least fair" allocation process is to
have the interviewing companies or the CPPC
pre-screen the resumes of interested students.
According to Keller, "It would place minority stu
dents at a disadvantage, since some minority stu
dents may not be as knowledgeable about the cor
porate applications process as some non-minority
students."
Such a view should not be allowed to go uncon
tested. The resources on campus that can help stu
dents understand the corporate application proc
ess include the CPPC, Stanford-in-Business, Stan
ford-in-Government, Stanford-in-Law, and the
Stanford Engineering Society. These organiza
tions offer their services to all students.
Additional resources that are available prima
rily for minority students include Asian-Ameri

can, black, Chicano, and native American Socie
ties for pre-business, pre-law, pre-med/health,
and science and engineering students. With the
wealth of services that these organisations offer,
there should not be any students at a disadvantage
in understanding how corporations manage their
recruiting processes.
Corporations pre-screen resumes as a common
practice to reduce the number of interviews they
will conduct. Where they interview — on campus
or off — need not make a difference in de
termining who gets interviews. Because the
CPPC's current system is inefficient for both stu
dents and interviewing firms, the CPPC should
consider the following proposal:
The CPPC announces which firms will be com
ing to campus to interview and sets a deadline for
those interested in particular firms to submit
their resumes to the CPPC.
The CPPC forwards resumes en masse to each
firm as per students' requests accompanied by a
CPPC general cover letter.
Each firm screens the resumes it has been sent,
chooses which students it would like to interview,
and sends its list of choices to the CPPC, whereby
the CPPC posts a final schedule of the on-campus
interviews.
The corporate pre-screening method of allocat
ing interviews should be reconsidered for its time
proven merit; such a policy cannot realistically
be condemned for discriminating against minor
ity students.
