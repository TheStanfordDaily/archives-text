# Reagan to propose tax relief; Kemp high- income cuts nixed
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan, in a slight stretching of his or
iginal budget plan, will ask Congress
to approve individual income tax re
ductions of 5 percent in 1981, 10 per
cent in 1982 and 1983 and another 5 per
cent in 1984. informed sources said
yesterday.
The White House announced that
Reagan had also decided to seek a re
duction in the maximum tax on invest
ment income from 70 percent to 50
percent over three years.
But the president has rejected a pro
posal by Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), to
propose a similar reduction in the
present 50 percent tax ceiling on in
come from wages and salaries.
The sources said that the president
would seek spending reductions of $12
billion in the current fiscal year, end
ing Sept. 30, and would urge a $50
billion reduction below former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's proposed outlays
of $739.3 billion in the following fiscal
year.
If enacted by Congress, Reagan's
plan would provide a tax saving of $114
for a family of four with income of
$20,000 in 1981, a Treasury official
said. The same family would get a tax
cut of $300 in 1982, $464 in 1983 and $578
in 1984 below current rates, the of
ficial added.
A family of four with $200,000 in in
come would receive a tax reduction of
$920 this year, $3619 in 1982, $8199 in
1983 and $10,775 in 1984 below the pre
vailing rates.
There were signs that Reagan's pro
gram would run into some trouble in
the Democratic-controlled House,

however. Speaker Thomas O'Neill
(D-Mass.) told reporters that he fa
vored close scrutiny of the president's
plan.
"We're not going to ram through ev
erything he's asking for," O'Neill
said. "Legislation made in haste
makes for an awful lot of waste along
the line."
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-IU),
chairman of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee, said that
Reagan's plan would lower tax collec
tions by $261 billion by 1986.
"Those figures are staggering and
call into serious question the effect
such massive reductions would have
on inflation, economic growth, the
deficit, interest rates and the long
range benefit to working Americans,"
Rostenkowski said in a speech to the
Economic Club of Chicago.
Overall, the president's tax pro
posal would reduce revenues from fed
eral income taxes by $6.4 billion in this
fiscal year and by $44.2 billion in fiscal
year 1982. which begins Oct. 1.
Reagan will ask that Congress
make the personal tax cuts effective
July 1, the White House press office
confirmed, although reduction in busi
ness taxes will be proposed to be retro
active to Jan. 1 to prevent a slowdown
in investment on the part of businesses
that would otherwise delay making in
vestments until July 1 to take advan
tage of the tax benefit.
No further dollar breakdown of how
the tax cut would affect individuals or
families with other levels of income
was provided by the Treasury. A
White House spokesman said that the
details would be available after Rea
gan unveils the proposal tonight

before a joint session of Congress
In another development, Treasury
officials confirmed that some tax
payers with high incomes, realized en
tirely from wages and salaries, would
not get the full benefit of the presi
dent's proposal for a 30 percent
across-the-board tax cut. spread over
three years.
The present law taxes income at
rates ranging from 14 percent to 70
percent. Those rates would be cut by
10 percent a year over the next three
years under Reagan's plan, so they
would range from 10 percent to 50 per
cent by mid-1984.
But the law now allows a person to
limit taxes on income from wages and
salaries — known as "earned income"
in the tax code — to 50 per cent, the
maximum tax.
Thus, the maximum tax now paid by
single individuals with earned income
of more than $42,500 and by couples
with incomes of $60,000 a "vear and
above, would benefit from Reagan's
plan to lower tax rates, but not as
much in the'early years as will those
with lower incomes.
Even if Congress enacts the presi
dent's plan, "a very small per
centage" of persons with wage-salary
income of more than $215,400 a year
would get less than a 30 percent cut,
according to Norman Ture, under
secretary of the Treasury for tax af
fairs.
"It was never contemplated to do
otherwise,'' Ture told a press briefing.
The president also will outline a
plan for speedier tax write-offs on in
vestments in business equipment and
structures, an administration source
said.

iginal budget plan, will ask Congress
to approve individual income tax re
ductions of 5 percent in 1981, 10 per
cent in 1982 and 1983 and another 5 per
cent in 1984. informed sources said
yesterday.
The White House announced that
Reagan had also decided to seek a re
duction in the maximum tax on invest
ment income from 70 percent to 50
percent over three years.
But the president has rejected a pro
posal by Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), to
propose a similar reduction in the
present 50 percent tax ceiling on in
come from wages and salaries.
The sources said that the president
would seek spending reductions of $12
billion in the current fiscal year, end
ing Sept. 30, and would urge a $50
billion reduction below former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's proposed outlays
of $739.3 billion in the following fiscal
year.
If enacted by Congress, Reagan's
plan would provide a tax saving of $114
for a family of four with income of
$20,000 in 1981, a Treasury official
said. The same family would get a tax
cut of $300 in 1982, $464 in 1983 and $578
in 1984 below current rates, the of
ficial added.
A family of four with $200,000 in in
come would receive a tax reduction of
$920 this year, $3619 in 1982, $8199 in
1983 and $10,775 in 1984 below the pre
vailing rates.
There were signs that Reagan's pro
gram would run into some trouble in
the Democratic-controlled House,

however. Speaker Thomas O'Neill
(D-Mass.) told reporters that he fa
vored close scrutiny of the president's
plan.
"We're not going to ram through ev
erything he's asking for," O'Neill
said. "Legislation made in haste
makes for an awful lot of waste along
the line."
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-IU),
chairman of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee, said that
Reagan's plan would lower tax collec
tions by $261 billion by 1986.
"Those figures are staggering and
call into serious question the effect
such massive reductions would have
on inflation, economic growth, the
deficit, interest rates and the long
range benefit to working Americans,"
Rostenkowski said in a speech to the
Economic Club of Chicago.
Overall, the president's tax pro
posal would reduce revenues from fed
eral income taxes by $6.4 billion in this
fiscal year and by $44.2 billion in fiscal
year 1982. which begins Oct. 1.
Reagan will ask that Congress
make the personal tax cuts effective
July 1, the White House press office
confirmed, although reduction in busi
ness taxes will be proposed to be retro
active to Jan. 1 to prevent a slowdown
in investment on the part of businesses
that would otherwise delay making in
vestments until July 1 to take advan
tage of the tax benefit.
No further dollar breakdown of how
the tax cut would affect individuals or
families with other levels of income
was provided by the Treasury. A
White House spokesman said that the
details would be available after Rea
gan unveils the proposal tonight

before a joint session of Congress
In another development, Treasury
officials confirmed that some tax
payers with high incomes, realized en
tirely from wages and salaries, would
not get the full benefit of the presi
dent's proposal for a 30 percent
across-the-board tax cut. spread over
three years.
The present law taxes income at
rates ranging from 14 percent to 70
percent. Those rates would be cut by
10 percent a year over the next three
years under Reagan's plan, so they
would range from 10 percent to 50 per
cent by mid-1984.
But the law now allows a person to
limit taxes on income from wages and
salaries — known as "earned income"
in the tax code — to 50 per cent, the
maximum tax.
Thus, the maximum tax now paid by
single individuals with earned income
of more than $42,500 and by couples
with incomes of $60,000 a "vear and
above, would benefit from Reagan's
plan to lower tax rates, but not as
much in the'early years as will those
with lower incomes.
Even if Congress enacts the presi
dent's plan, "a very small per
centage" of persons with wage-salary
income of more than $215,400 a year
would get less than a 30 percent cut,
according to Norman Ture, under
secretary of the Treasury for tax af
fairs.
"It was never contemplated to do
otherwise,'' Ture told a press briefing.
The president also will outline a
plan for speedier tax write-offs on in
vestments in business equipment and
structures, an administration source
said.
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan, in a slight stretching of his or
iginal budget plan, will ask Congress
