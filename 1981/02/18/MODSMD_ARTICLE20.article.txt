## Supervisor's letter spurs constituent protest storm 
### Los Angeles Times 
San Francisco — Even in San
Francisco, the most tolerant of
cities, there apparently is a lim
it — and Supervisor Carol Ruth
Silver seems to have exceeded
it.
At Silver's request, the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors
last week sent a sympathetic
letter to Rep. Jon Hinson (R-
Miss.) commenting on Hinson's
recent arrest on homosexual
charges in a men's room in the
Longworth House Office Build
ing in Washington.
The letter indicated that Sil
ver wanted to "express her re
gret that the Capitol Police ap
parently find it necessary to
conduct investigations into such
incidents involving so-called
victimless crime" when they
should be on the street to com
bat violent crime.
And it said the Supervisor
"hopes that the problem caused
by this incident will soon be
over."
But after a storm of protest
from outraged constituents and
some less-than-flattering edito
rial comment in the local press,
Silver's colleagues on the Board
of Supervisors did some
backpedaling yesterday to dis
sociate themselves from her
sentiments.
Board disavows letter
In short, they sought in 30
minutes of debate to make it
clear that the letter, even

though it went out on official
stationery and over the signa
ture of the board's clerk, ex
pressed the view only of Silver
and not the rest of the 11-mem
ber board.
Chairman John Molinari said
he was concerned with "the im
pression it (the letter) left in the
minds of the people in this coun
try" and wondered whether
"the more we disavow, the
more foolish we look." He coun
seled his colleagues to "be more
cautious about what passes
through here routinely."
And Supervisor Quentin Kopp
said he wanted it understood
that he was "in no way as
sociated with such action . . .
with respect to this con
gressman in Washington, D.C."
Deluge of calls
Leading up to yesterday's de
bate was a deluge of angry tele
phone calls to every supervisor
— "I got more phone calls on
this than I do on something im
portant like the budget," Kopp
told the Los Angeles Times —
and some sharp criticism in
both local newspapers.
"On the scale of the absurd,"
editorialized the afternoon San
Francisco Examiner, "we
thought that the maximum bell
had been rung long ago on the
Board of Supervisors by some of
its bizarre expressions. But
here comes Supervisor Carol
Ruth Silver with a super bell
ringer. . . . With this leap, Su

pervisor Silver has, quite sim
ply, made a fool of the city."
Not to be outdone, the morn
ing Chronicle described the in
cident as "another of those pre
posterous forays by the board
. . . into territory where it has
no business whatsoever."
Tempest in a teapot
As far as Silver is concerned,
however, she views the whole
thing as a tempest in a teapot.
She said yesterday that she took
full responsibility for the letter.
She also delivered a prepared
statement to her fellow super
visors in its defense, saying it
was intended not so much to re
flect sympathy for Hinson as it
was to draw attention to "con
tinued misallocation of police
resources."
