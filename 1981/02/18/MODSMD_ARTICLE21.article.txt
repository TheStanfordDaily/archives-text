# Spokesman refutes newspaper story
## Tax plan denied 
### Associated Press 
President Ronald Rea
gan's spokesman yesterday
denied published reports that
said the president does not
plan to give high-income
Americans the same tax
break as those in lower
salary brackets.
White House press secre
tary James Brady, said the
Reagan proposal for tax rate
reductions of 10 percent a
year for three years would be
applied "across the board."
Earlier, the New York
Times and The Baltimore
Sun quoted sources as saying
Reagan would retain the
maximum 50 percent tax
rate, which single people pay
on salary income, after de
ductions, in excess of $42,500.
A family of four pays the top
tax on wages and salaries of
more than $60,000.
Reagan's plan, which he
will formally present to Con
gress tonight, will call for

cutting tax rates 10 percent a
year for three years, but will
leave intact the 50-percent
maximum rate, the news
papers said.
But Brady said the tax cut
proposals are those on which
Reagan had campaigned for
two years, including the
"across-the-board" cuts.
Asked if he denied The
Times story, Brady replied,
"Yes."
On Feb. 5, Reagan, in his
nationally televised econom
ic report to the nation, said
he will "ask for a 10 percent
reduction, across the board,
in personal income tax rates,
for each of the next three
years."
Reagan last week decided
to propose cutting the max
imum tax rate on unearned
income, such as dividends
and interest, from 70 percent
to 50 percent over three
years.
