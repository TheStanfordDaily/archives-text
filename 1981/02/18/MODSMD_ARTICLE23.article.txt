# Reagan budget to fund military expansion
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The bomber
and the aircraft carrier — the
two mainstays of American de
fense for the past 40 years — will
get a new lease on life in the
Reagan administration.
Officials say that the White
House will include funds for in
itial production of a new
manned bomber and an addi
tional nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier next month when it
sends amendments to the fiscal
1982 budget submitted to Capitol
Hill by the Carter adminis
tration.
Though no decision has been
made on exactly what type of
new bomber will be built, of
ficials said it would most likely
be a modified version of the 81,
the production of which Presi
dent Jimmy Carter canceled in
a controversial decision in 1977.
Officials said they believe the
Air Force could begin deploying
sizable numbers of these new
bombers by 1985 and 1986, and
that adding these weapons ap
pears to be the quickest and
most efficient way to restore
some of the balance of nuclear
power between Washington and
Moscow that the Reagan admin
istration believes has been
eroded in recent years.
Major expansion
The decision to include what
are called long lead-time funds
for production of a new nuclear
powered aircraft carrier also
reverses a Carter adminis
tration decision not to seek any
money in the fiscal '82 budget
for these huge warships. It could
mark the start of the kind of ma
jor expansion naval leaders
have been seeking for years.

Though officials say there is
no final acceptance by the Rea
gan administration as to the ul
timate size of the Navy's car
rier fleet, a number of officials
believe the start on the new car
rier will be the first step to a
Navy built around 15 carrier
task forces permanently
deployed in three oceans.
The Navy has 12 carriers in
operation plus a 13th that is used
for training. The tentative plan
is to build two more large car
riers, though not necessarily nu
clear-powered, in addition to
the one in the new budget, over
the next 10 years. This would al
low, officials say, for per
manent U.S. carrier fleets in the
Indian Ocean as well as in the
Atlantic, Pacific and Mediter
ranean.
Severe strain
The Navy has maintained a
two-carrier task force in the In
dian Ocean since late in 1979
when the crises in Iran and Af
ghanistan developed. But this
has caused a severe strain on
naval manpower and ship avail
ability.
Officials also talk privately of
possible plans to make main
tenance of a three-ocean, possi
bly five-fleet Navy easier by
perhaps seeking arrangements
to homeport ships in Australia
and put additional vessels in the
Philippines.
Though potential increases in
the size of the'fleet have seemed
unrealistic for some time be
cause the services were failing
to recruit and hold the personnel
to man ships, officials say reten
tion has improved substantially
in recent months and suggest
there may be a slight increase in

the size of the Navy and the
Marine Corps in the forth
coming Reagan budget amend
ments.
The decision to move ahead
with the new bomber is not sur
prising. While the Carter ad
ministration had no money for it
in its last budget, Congress has
mandated that the adminis
tration present options for a new
plane and get one into produc
tion by 1987, and has put some
$300 million into the budget for
research and development
work. Officials said they
thought the new administration
would up the total spent on the
new plane next year — including

the long lead-time hardware —
to between $1.5 billion and $2.5
billion.
Because the new plane would
most likely be a variation of the
81, officials said the production
time can be cut substantially.
The idea is that the new bomber
would eventually replace the
8525, some of which are 30 years
old. The new aircraft, however,
would gradually replace the
older bombers without losing
any of the missions assigned to
them.
The new plane, for example,
would ultimately be able to pen
etrate Soviet air defense and fly
directly to targets inside Soviet

borders. It would also be able to
carry conventional bombs and
be used as the 852 was in Viet
nam. It is also planned to be a
more efficient carrier of nucle
ar-tipped cruise missiles than is
the 852.
Thus, as the new plane enters
service, it would take on the role
that is most difficult for the 852
— namely, the problem of flying
through Soviet air defenses. The
852s then would be used mostly
as cruise-missile carriers that
could stand outside Soviet de
fenses and lob their missiles to
targets deep inside the Soviet
Union.
