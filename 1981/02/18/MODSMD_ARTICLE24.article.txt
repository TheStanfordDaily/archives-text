Washington (AP) â€” President Reagan will im
plement fully the Iranian hostage agreement, sen
ators were told yesterday, and former Secretary
of State Edmund Muskie said the arrangement
will not encourage further terrorism.
Muskie and two of his onetime deputies told
House and Senate committees that America
should honor the agreement with Iran that freed
52 U.S. hostages Jan. 20 after 444 days of captivity.
"We should fulfill the agreement because we
are a great power with interests ... in keeping our
word," Muskie told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.) chairman of the
committee, announced that Secretary of State
Alexander Haig had told senators Reagan has de
cided to "implement fully the agreement."
"They obviously will adjudicate any legal ques
tions," Percy said. "It would be my hope that we
will take any international questions to the world
court."
Muskie said the deal maintains U.S. honor and

said he and his negotiators accomplished "our ob
jective not to make any arrangement to en
courage terrorism in the future."
He said Iran was isolated by the world com
munity for taking the hostages in violation of in
ternational rules of behavior, and lost the use of
$12 billion in assets frozen by then President Jim
my Carter.
"And in return Iran achieved none of its objec
tives," Muskie said. "Internationally and
domestically, the United States emerged stronger
and Iran emerged weaker."
Former Deputy Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, chief U.S. negotiator of the deal, also
told the senators that Iran achieved none of its ob
jectives.
Christopher said Iran failed to win a U.S.
apology for past U.S.-Iran relations, got no U.S.
ransom for the hostages, got no U.S. help in the
Iran-Iraq war and never achieved its demand for
U.S. return of the late Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi.
