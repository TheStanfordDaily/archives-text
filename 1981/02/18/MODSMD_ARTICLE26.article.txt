# Small town tactics draw big city names
## Seniors seek celebrity speaker 
### Los Angeles Times 
Fort Jones, Calif. —The 18
seniors at Fort Jones High
School did not want a repeat of
last year.
"That time we wrote the gov
ernor, asking him to speak at
graduation," said Robert E.
Novo, principal of the tiny
school in this remote mountain
town in Northern California.
"We got back a form letter
that looked like the ones they
send you from the Reader's
Digest. It said something like,
'Gee, I can't be there, but good
luck.'
"So, instead of Governor
(Jerry) Brown we had a retired
woodshop teacher. He tried his
best, but. . . .
"Well: he really didn't have
that much to say, " chimed in
Tammie Harris, 17, president of
this year's student body.
"We decided that this year,
we'd try to get someone who had
really made it, someone who
could tell us how to get there.
You know, a real celebrity."
Tammie and Novo got their
heads together and agreed that
new tactics were in order.
I So, instead of the governor,
: Tammie wrote to four news
papers.
She asked them to spread
; word of her request for "a fa
mous person. . . .
"It would mean a lot," she
;said.
At least two papers re
sponded: the San- Francisco
Chronicle, which reprinted her
letter, and the Los Angeles
Times, which ran a small story.
Then Tammie, Bob Novo and
the 500 or so other residents of
this lumber and farming com
munity about 30 miles south of

the Oregon border went back
about their business, which is
pretty quiet this time of year,
being winter.
But a few days later, the
phones at the six-room
schoolhouse began to ring. And
the mail began to pour in.
"The first one big was Ten
nessee Ernie Ford," Novo said.
"He told us he really wants to
come.
"The next one was Pete Mc-
Closkey, the congressman. He
said he'll come too. A while lat
er, March Fong Eu, the (Cali
fornia) secretary of state, said
she'll be here.
"And there were more. Lots
more.
"One guy said he could de
liver Mork and Mindy. One said
he's on Star Trek, another said
he's the human fly.
"Six guys said they'd jump
out of an airplane carrying red,
white and blue smoke bombs —
or, if we prefer, they'd do a rain
bow effect.
"I've been offered any gener
al I want from the Sixth Army.
I've been offered the author of
"Von Ryan's Express." One
guy suggested his wife of 26
years— he said she 'typifies the
best that is womanhood.'
"A member of the San Fran
cisco Board of Supervisors said
he'd get us Ted Hendricks of the
Oakland Raiders."
The 88 students at Fort Jones
High School seem to be taking it
all in stride.
They offered opinions about
the advantages of living in a
town like Fort Jones and attend
ing its high school:
"It's a good place to raise
your kids. No crime. No drugs."
"At our school, everyone

knows you and everyone cares.
Everybody knows your prob
lems and everybody helps.
"Nobody gets left out of any
thing. Everyone who wants to
makes the team."
One student offered per
spective:
"I used to go to high school in
Santa Rosa,"Kris Wilson
said."There were 900 in my
class, here we're 18.
"There, you were closed in.
Here, it's open.
"Here, I can just walk out of
the house and catch a fish, and I
don't have to lock the door be
hind me, 'cause no one will take
anything."
But living in Fort Jones has at
least one drawback.
"There's no Taco Bell," one
student lamented.
There's no bowling alley,
either. No movie theater. No
disco.
There are a lot of dogs — the
large, lumpy kind that wag hap
pily up to have their ears
scratched after a comfortable
nap on a porch, in the back of a
truck, or even in a warm patch
of sun in the middle of the
streeet.
The town, a rag-tag collection
of tattered Victorian cottages,
false-fronted stores and slab
sided mobile homes, is domi
nated by the high school —
modern, pin-neat, glass-and
masonry structure across the
river from the main drag.
Built in 1974 and scrupulously
maintained since then by the
woman janitor who lives in a
trailer behind the science room,
the school is small but com
plete, well stocked with up-to
date furnishings and equipment.
