# Delegates from the UN 1980 Conference for Women speak out
## Copenhagen conference discussed 
### 
"Unless western feminists
become politically responsible
citizens and oppose imperialist
policies, they will continue to
oppose their sisters in the third
world," a delegate from the 1980
World Conference for Women
commented Thursday evening
in Meyer Library.
Nilufer Cagatay, graduate
student in Economics, joined
four other women delegates in a
discussion of the Copenhagen
conference which focused on the
problems and concerns of wom
en in the third world.

'The nature of our oppression as women
differs based on the social context in which
we live. 9 —Nilufer Cagatay, graduate
student in economics

The purpose of the con
ference, according to Ursula
Funk, was "to evaluate changes
made throughout the decade in
health, education and welfare of
women."
Funk, a graduate student in
anthropology, also pointed to
problems at Copenhagen, citing
"stark cases of misrepresenta
tion" among the delegates to the
conference which represented
135 countries.
"Mrs. Sadat of Egypt and
Mrs. Marcos of the Phillipines
. . . they could not be expected
to do justice to our feminine
concerns," she explained.
"There was a conflict be
tween middle and upper class

western women representing
only themselves, and working
class women who were repre
senting the concerns of their
third world countries," she
added.
Nilufer Cagatay also spoke of
the conflict between the women
of the third and western worlds,
as evident in the language bar
rier.
"The whole conference was
virtually in English," Cagatay
said. "We were constantly
fighting the language problem."
The domination of English
language was not welcomed by

many of the delegates from the
third world countries.
"One South American woman
became so frustrated and angry
during a panel discussion that
she stood up and screamed be
cause she could not understand
the language," Cagatay re
called.
The conflict at the conference
between women of the different
worlds revealed to Cagatay that
"we cannot treat women as a
homogeneous group."
"While western women de
sire more and greater job op
portunities, a woman in India
works 18 hours a day and wants
more leisure time," she ex
plained.
Cagatay left the conference
having learned that "the nature
of our oppression as women dif
fers based on the social context
in which we live."
A third delegate, Margo
Davis, gave a slide presentation
of women in Northern Nigeria
and Kenya.
"These slides underline the
priorities for women in African
areas, which are, basically, to
survive," said David, who is as
sistant director of the Center for
Research on Women and an in
structor in the Freshman Semi
nar Program.
Bella Mody, assistant pro
fessor in Communications, dis

cussed a research paper outlin
ing the problems of women
headed household among Indo-
Chinese refugees living in San
Jose.
Mody, who coordinates the
masters program for com
munication and development in
third world nations, presented
the research paper at the con
ference in Copenhagen.
Cecilia Burciaga, assistant
provost, also spoke of social and
economic problems among
third world women in a presen
tation of the concerns of Mexi
can migrant workers.
Ursula Funk summed up the
various presentation concern
ing social and economic prob
lems.
"The inequalities of women
cannot be separated from prob
lems of underdevelopment in

countries." she said, adding
that "women will never be free
without racism and classism^
The conference resulted in 48 0
resolutions for improvement of
women's conditions throughout
the world. The resolutions,'.'
available in Government Docu
ments, were "a condemnation
of racist regimes." said Funk.. <u
These resolutions were ac
knowledged by only 75 of the 135
countries, a sign to Funk that 1 '
"many governments were not
taking us seriously." ~,
"But I consider the program
of action formed at the con-.,,
ference and improtant and in
fluencial study," Funk coun-,.
tered. "I feel that women have
an important potential power.,
for future political and econom
ic development of the third
world." • ■"

cause she could not understand
the language," Cagatay re
called.
The conflict at the conference
between women of the different
worlds revealed to Cagatay that
"we cannot treat women as a
homogeneous group."
"While western women de
sire more and greater job op
portunities, a woman in India
works 18 hours a day and wants
more leisure time," she ex
plained.
Cagatay left the conference
having learned that "the nature
of our oppression as women dif
fers based on the social context
in which we live."
A third delegate, Margo
Davis, gave a slide presentation
of women in Northern Nigeria

Research on Women and an in
structor in the Freshman Semi

"Unless western feminists
become politically responsible
citizens and oppose imperialist
policies, they will continue to
oppose their sisters in the third
world," a delegate from the 1980
World Conference for Women
commented Thursday evening
in Meyer Library.
Nilufer Cagatay, graduate
student in Economics, joined
four other women delegates in a
discussion of the Copenhagen
conference which focused on the
problems and concerns of wom
en in the third world.

'The nature of our oppression as women
differs based on the social context in which
we live. 9 —Nilufer Cagatay, graduate
student in economics

The purpose of the con
ference, according to Ursula
Funk, was "to evaluate changes
made throughout the decade in
health, education and welfare of
women."
Funk, a graduate student in
anthropology, also pointed to
problems at Copenhagen, citing
"stark cases of misrepresenta
tion" among the delegates to the
conference which represented
135 countries.
"Mrs. Sadat of Egypt and
Mrs. Marcos of the Phillipines
. . . they could not be expected
to do justice to our feminine
concerns," she explained.
"There was a conflict be
tween middle and upper class

western women representing
only themselves, and working
class women who were repre
senting the concerns of their
third world countries," she
added.
Nilufer Cagatay also spoke of
the conflict between the women
of the third and western worlds,
as evident in the language bar
rier.
"The whole conference was
virtually in English," Cagatay
said. "We were constantly
fighting the language problem."
The domination of English
language was not welcomed by

many of the delegates from the
third world countries.
"One South American woman
became so frustrated and angry
during a panel discussion that
she stood up and screamed be
cause she could not understand
the language," Cagatay re
called.
The conflict at the conference
between women of the different
worlds revealed to Cagatay that
"we cannot treat women as a
homogeneous group."
"While western women de
sire more and greater job op
portunities, a woman in India
works 18 hours a day and wants
