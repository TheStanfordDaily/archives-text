# Cards shuffled to bottom of Pac-10 deck

### Steve Odell 
Pullman, Wash. — The Stan
ford men's basketball team
gave a very good imitation of
Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde this
weekend, coming up with two
very contrasting efforts. But al
though the games were about as
opposite in every aspect as they
could possibly be, there was one
glaring consistency — the
CaFdinals lost both.
On Saturday night in Seattle,
Stanford was pummeled by the
Washington Huskies, 89-71, a
f;ame which the Huskies con
roiled pretty much from the tip
off r Proof of this was to be found
in .the final statistics, which
Washington dominated in near
ly every category.
Monday night's confronata
tion with the Cougars, however,
saft Stanford fall quickly be
hind, but bounce back with eight
and eleven point runs to put
thim ahead by a comfortable
sevten point margin at halftime.
They continued to lead in the
second half until Steve Harriel
hit a jump shot with 20 seconds
left, propelling WSU to a 59-58
victory. And even though it was
Washington's Birthday, the
statistics did lie, as they fa
vored Stanford convincingly in
the losing effort.
fl?he differences in the week
end games did not stop there:
Against Washington, the
were bullied on the
boards, being outrebounded
52-09. The Huskies had two,
three, and even four shots at
tirijes on their offensive end. In
Pidlman. it was the Cards who
controlled the area around the
rim, as they hauled down 33
missed shots to just 25 for the
Cougars.
ft In the Husky loss, the Cards
shot a dismal 39 percent from
the' field. Stanford's shooting
wojes were no better ex
emplified than by Brian Welch's
frigid 1-14 shooting from the
floor.

Against Washington State,
however, the Cards were hot,
hitting on 52 percent of their
field goal attempts. Welch re
covered his shooting touch as
well, and he banged in seven out
of 12 from the filed to take game
scoring honors with 18 points.
• Finally. Saturday night's
contest was played in front of an
unenthusiastic crowd of 3281;
indeed, at times, Edmundson
Pavilion could have been mis
taken for Green Library.
The crowd from the Palouse
were a different story altogeth
er. Boasting a legion of some 50
rally persons, the crowd was
into the game even before it
began. And Cougar head coach
George Raveling resembled a
greek god with his exhortations
to the hometown fans. Standing
in front of the WSU bench, he
simply raised his hands and pro
claimed, "Let there be noise."
And 10, there was noise. Cons
tant, and sometimes deafening
noise.
Seattle Slew
Saturday night's game saw
the Huskies score the first two
times they had the ball en route
to a quick 10-2 lead — a lead they
never relinquished. Stanford
staged an early run of their own
to cut Washington's lead to
12-10, and from that point until
four minutes remained in the
first half, the teams stayed
close. Exchanging baskets, the
biggest lead the Huskies could
manage was four points.
It was then that the Cards be
came as cold as the harsh Seat
tle weather. After Revelli got a
lay-in — off an alley-oop pass
from Jeff Ryan with 4:41 re
maining. the Cards failed to pro
cude another field goal the rest
of the half.
The Huskies took advantage

of Stanford's drought to extend
their lead to 13 by the in
termission, 41-28. It was this
stretch that prompted Dißiaso
to say, "The final three minutes
of the first half was where the
game was probably lost."
"We lost our composure,'' the
sixth year coach lamented. "We
had a lot of critical turnovers
and poor shots."
In the second half, it was
more of the same as Washington
continued their onslaught right
where they had left off. The
Dogs gradually built up their
lead to 22 with 10:44 remaining,
67-45.
Stanford made yet another
comeback bid at this point, str
inging together eight straight
points. After Marty nailed a
bomb from the top of the key,
Wichary put in two buckets af
ter fine offensive rebounds.
It was then that freshman
guard Keith Jones went to work.
Looking at the play-by-play
sheet between the seven minute
mark and when Jones fouled out
with 3:55 remaining, it reminds
one of a "J" page in a telephone
book.
Jones hit a nine-foot bank
shot, drilled 2 free throws, and
then popped in successive 10 and
14-footers to bring the Cards
within 12, 73-61. But that was as
close as Stanford was able to
come and the Huskies won going
away.
"We just lost our patience and
shot too quick," commented
Dißiaso. "When you're down by
18 with 15 minutes left, there's
no need to hurry."
Han-iel's heroics
On Monday night, it appeared
the Cards would gain a split —
being ahead by five with two and
one-half minutes remaining af

ter Revelli followed his own
missed shot and put it down.
But then the Cougar defense
took control, shutting out Stan
ford for the rest of the night.
Ken McFadden hit a bomb from
the right corner with 2:04 left,
and after a missed front end of a
one-and-one by Revelli, Ollie
Johnson had an easy fast break
lay-in, but missed.
On the ensuing transition,
Tyrone Brown came up with one
of his five steals on the night. He
passed ahead to McFaden, who
slammed one home with 54 sec
onds left, bringing the Pullman
crowd into a frenzy.
Following a Stanford time
out, Wichary attempted an in
bounds pass for Revelli, but it
was broken up and controlled by
the Cougars. It was just one of 20
turnovers in the game for Stan
ford, and their second in the
final minute. After moving the
ball around, Brown found Har
riet on the baseline for his game
winning bucket.
But Stanford still had a shot at
it, or two — as it turned out.
Welch took the inbounds pass
following a time-out and drove
the baseline, but his shot was re
jected out of bounds by Steve
Haskins. Wichary got his
chance on the next field goal try,
but his attempt from the far cor
ner was long, and Johnson
grabbed the rebound to seal
WSU's win.
"In the final analysis," a dis
gusted Dißiaso said after the
game, "you can't miss free
throws and turn the ball over
like that and expect to win a ball
game."
"I guess you've got to credit
their defense," he said. "But af
ter 20-some games, those kinds
of mistakes just shouldn't be
made."
