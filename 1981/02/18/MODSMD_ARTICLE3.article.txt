# Stanford braces for funding cuts in all areas except Pentagon research
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
President Ronald Reagan's pro
posed federal budget, which he will de
liver to Congress today, may force sig
nificant changes in many areas at
Stanford, ranging from the Museum to
the radio science laboratory to student
loans.
Most University faculty and admin
istrators have adopted a "wait and
see" attitude, knowing they will be af
fected, but hoping that what they feel
are significant projects will continue
to receive adequate funding.
As Gerald Lieberman, dean of grad
uate studies and research, said, "I am
worried. I don't view what appears to
be forthcoming as a disaster for the
University, but it will affect us."
Stanford receives significant feder
al funds, in the form of specific con
tracts and general grants. Of the Uni
versity's $463.7 million operating
budget last year, $118.9 million came
from the government. The Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) re
ceived an additional $68.9 million in
federal funds.ln all, the government
provides about 40 percent of Stan
ford's funds.
Although no specific details are
available concerning potential budget
cuts, information provided by the fed
eral Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) fueled speculation that
there will be massive cuts except in
defense research, according to
Lieberman.
Lieberman said Stanford would

probably undergo relatively fewer
cuts than other major research uni
versities. "The quality of the faculty
is such that even in times of tight re
search budgets, even though it may
suffer some cuts, Stanford's fraction
of federal grants could actually in
crease."
Electrical Engineering Prof. John
Katsufrakis said Stanford is particu
larly "vulnerable" to budget cuts due
to its extensive involvement in Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration (NASA) projects and its
widespread funding by the National
Science Foundation (NSF), two areas
destined for cuts by Reagan.
Two teams of Stanford scientists
are developing experiments for
NASA's Galileo Space Explorer, one
of the projects which the OMB al
legedly targeted for cutbacks, accord
ing to Electrical Engineering Prof.
Von Eshleman.
Eshleman said he hopes Galileo, a
spacecraft to be launched in 1984 to ex
plore Jupiter and its satellites before
continuing into outer space, will be
spared by Congress. A large amount of
money has already been invested in
the experiment, he said.
Eshleman said the decision on cuts
in specific programs "should be de
termined by the agency concerned"
and pointed out that if the United
States were to cancel the project the
nation might be considered an "un
reliable partner" by a number of Eu
ropean nations developing experi

ments for Galileo.
Eshleman said there is a need to
"bring the budget under control "but
said'he feels the space program should
be allowed to keep its "small traction
of the national budget " because "it is
an investment in the future.''
Earl Cilley, director of sponsored
projects, the University office which
negotiates contracts between the
Stanford and the federal government,
said he does "not expect any quality
research to be stopped " although it is
"too soon to tell with any certainty."
Speculating on other changes in fun
ding. Cilley said he feels research sup
ported by the Department of Defense
may receive more money under Rea
gan's new budget while federally
sponsored student loans may disap
pear. since Reagan has attacked this
form of government aid. Cilley said he
believes this will not have any "direct
effect" on a student's ability to con
tinue in school. According to Cilley,
the Financial Aids Office could com
pensate for loan cutbacks on the basis
of individual need
Kent Peterson, associate vice presi
dent for business and finance, also
said he expects cuts in the federally
sponsored student aid and loan pro
grams. It is impossible to make a long
range forecast on the overall impact
budget cuts will have on Stanford until
more is known about specific cuts.
SLAC, however, will feel any budget
cuts immediately as it depends on the
Department of Energy for most of its
operating expenses, according to
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky.
He said that less money would "result
in decreased operations" but does not
believe this will happen since he is
"encouraged by the positive attitude
towards basic research" of the new
administration.
In the arts, however, Art Prof. Al
bert Elsen expects budget cuts be
cause the Reagans have shown "little
personal interest" in the field. FZlsen
said budget cuts in the arts would
"hold no surprises" especially since
Reagan had a " dismal record in Cali
fornia" in state funding for the Cali
fornia Arts Commission while he was
governor.
The Museum is one of the areas

where Stanford received federal fund
ing in the past, according to Carol Os
borne. assistant director and curator
of collections. Grants received
through the National Endowment for
the Arts (NEA) funded several schol
arly catalogues for special exhibi
tions, provided money for a catalogue
of master drawings in the permanent
collection, and helped bring a number
of Ensor paintings to the museum as
part of the Belgium Today colloquium
Held here last year.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said that he is ready
to "accept drastic budget cuts," but
hopes no one field will be singled out
for the majority of them. "It's a bad
idea to try and do it all in one year and
I hope it will be done in ways that are
as little disruptive as possible," he

said.
Rosenzweig recently published an
article in The Chronicle of Higher
Education calling for "stability and
predictability in financing, lightening
some aspects of the regulatory
burden," and for increased tax incen
tives for industries that fund univer
sities. He feels that in considering
budget cuts it is essential to preserve
the "vitality" of the universities, "the
core activities which allow the faculty
and students to pursue their projects
creatively, with adequate resources
and minimum distraction."
The University would fight any cuts
which attempted to these disrupt core
activites, according to Rosenzweig.
Lieberman said the University would
"lobby to restore research it feels is
important."

Although no specific details are
available concerning potential budget
cuts, information provided by the fed
eral Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) fueled speculation that
there will be massive cuts except in
defense research, according to
Lieberman.
Lieberman said Stanford would

probably undergo relatively fewer
cuts than other major research uni
versities. "The quality of the faculty
is such that even in times of tight re
search budgets, even though it may
suffer some cuts, Stanford's fraction
of federal grants could actually in
crease."
Electrical Engineering Prof. John
Katsufrakis said Stanford is particu
larly "vulnerable" to budget cuts due
to its extensive involvement in Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration (NASA) projects and its
widespread funding by the National
Science Foundation (NSF), two areas
destined for cuts by Reagan.
Two teams of Stanford scientists
are developing experiments for
NASA's Galileo Space Explorer, one
of the projects which the OMB al
legedly targeted for cutbacks, accord
ing to Electrical Engineering Prof.
Von Eshleman.
Eshleman said he hopes Galileo, a
spacecraft to be launched in 1984 to ex
plore Jupiter and its satellites before
continuing into outer space, will be
spared by Congress. A large amount of
money has already been invested in
the experiment, he said.
Eshleman said the decision on cuts
in specific programs "should be de
termined by the agency concerned"
and pointed out that if the United
States were to cancel the project the
nation might be considered an "un
reliable partner" by a number of Eu
ropean nations developing experi

ments for Galileo.
Eshleman said there is a need to
"bring the budget under control "but
said'he feels the space program should
be allowed to keep its "small traction
of the national budget " because "it is
an investment in the future.''
Earl Cilley, director of sponsored
projects, the University office which
negotiates contracts between the
Stanford and the federal government,
said he does "not expect any quality
research to be stopped " although it is
"too soon to tell with any certainty."
Speculating on other changes in fun
ding. Cilley said he feels research sup
ported by the Department of Defense
may receive more money under Rea
gan's new budget while federally
sponsored student loans may disap
pear. since Reagan has attacked this
form of government aid. Cilley said he
believes this will not have any "direct
effect" on a student's ability to con
tinue in school. According to Cilley,
the Financial Aids Office could com
pensate for loan cutbacks on the basis
of individual need
Kent Peterson, associate vice presi
dent for business and finance, also
said he expects cuts in the federally
sponsored student aid and loan pro
grams. It is impossible to make a long
range forecast on the overall impact
budget cuts will have on Stanford until
more is known about specific cuts.
SLAC, however, will feel any budget
cuts immediately as it depends on the
Department of Energy for most of its
operating expenses, according to
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky.
He said that less money would "result
in decreased operations" but does not
believe this will happen since he is
"encouraged by the positive attitude
towards basic research" of the new
administration.
In the arts, however, Art Prof. Al
bert Elsen expects budget cuts be
cause the Reagans have shown "little
personal interest" in the field. FZlsen
said budget cuts in the arts would
"hold no surprises" especially since
Reagan had a " dismal record in Cali
fornia" in state funding for the Cali
fornia Arts Commission while he was
governor.
The Museum is one of the areas

where Stanford received federal fund
ing in the past, according to Carol Os
borne. assistant director and curator
of collections. Grants received
through the National Endowment for
the Arts (NEA) funded several schol
arly catalogues for special exhibi
tions, provided money for a catalogue
of master drawings in the permanent
collection, and helped bring a number
of Ensor paintings to the museum as
part of the Belgium Today colloquium
Held here last year.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said that he is ready
to "accept drastic budget cuts," but
hopes no one field will be singled out
for the majority of them. "It's a bad
idea to try and do it all in one year and
I hope it will be done in ways that are
as little disruptive as possible," he

said.
Rosenzweig recently published an
article in The Chronicle of Higher
Education calling for "stability and
predictability in financing, lightening
some aspects of the regulatory
burden," and for increased tax incen
tives for industries that fund univer
sities. He feels that in considering
budget cuts it is essential to preserve
the "vitality" of the universities, "the
core activities which allow the faculty
and students to pursue their projects
creatively, with adequate resources
and minimum distraction."
The University would fight any cuts
which attempted to these disrupt core
activites, according to Rosenzweig.
Lieberman said the University would
"lobby to restore research it feels is
important."
President Ronald Reagan's pro
posed federal budget, which he will de
liver to Congress today, may force sig
nificant changes in many areas at
Stanford, ranging from the Museum to
the radio science laboratory to student
loans.
Most University faculty and admin
istrators have adopted a "wait and
see" attitude, knowing they will be af
fected, but hoping that what they feel
are significant projects will continue
to receive adequate funding.
As Gerald Lieberman, dean of grad
uate studies and research, said, "I am
worried. I don't view what appears to
be forthcoming as a disaster for the
University, but it will affect us."
Stanford receives significant feder
al funds, in the form of specific con
tracts and general grants. Of the Uni
versity's $463.7 million operating
budget last year, $118.9 million came
from the government. The Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) re
ceived an additional $68.9 million in
federal funds.ln all, the government
provides about 40 percent of Stan
ford's funds.
