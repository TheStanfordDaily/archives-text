was unable to score.
"We played tremendously
well," Cardinal asssistant

over ten. "We out rebounded
and out hustled them," Kehoe
said.
The Cards were led in scoring

Metzger fouled out in the last
minute. Cal was led in scoring

Meg Metzger put the Cards up
by one at the half with three con

Hathorn and Denise McGuire
came off the bench and played a
tremendous game," Kehoe

said.
The Cards were behind most
of the second half, and were un
able to regain the lead until
Smith's shot in the closing sec
onds. "We played collectively,
as a team," Kehoe said, "and it
was one of out best efforts of the
year."
The loss was only the second
for California all season. The
Golden Bears were favored to
win by a large margin, but the
Cardinals surprised everyone
with their last minute, heart
stopping heroics.
