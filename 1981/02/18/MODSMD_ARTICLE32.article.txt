# Ruggers trounce number 2 BATS
## 
### Sheila Duigan 
An African chief, upon seeing
his first rugby game said to his
host, "Sir! This is like war
without spears." It must have
felt that way to the Bay Area
Touring Side (the "BATS") as
they lost 25-8 to Stanford's own
rugby team.
The No. 2 ranked BATS have
defeated Stanford each year
since 1970, and have long domi
nated Bay Area rugby in gener
al. Not this bright and sunny
Monday afternoon.
The usually high scoring
BATS were limited to only two
tries. Swarming Stanford backs
consistently stopped their oppo
nents from going outside. But
when they then tried to go inside
they met the powerful Stanford
scrum, Gary Marenzi, Milt
McColl, Claude Tardy, and John
Walecka, who played like the
Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse.
McColl was undoubtedly
Prince of the turf, dominating
the line-outs and defense. He

also proved that playing on the
Cardinal football defensive
squad has not diminished his of
fensive instincts. He scored on a
bull-like 60 yard run, with his
head down and knees up.
Forwards Tardy and Frank
Hicks teamed up on one of the
more exciting scoring plays of
the day. Tardy broke up-field
for 10 yards only to be collard by
the defense. He then slipped the
ball to Hicks, who exploded for a
60 yard score, his second try of
the day.
This could be the peak year
for Stanford rugby. The dash of
French and Aussie students has
given consistency and speed to
this year's lean and hard driving
squad. A National Cham
pionship? Not impossible, par
ticularly after back-to-back vic
tories over the two best teams in
the country (UCLA and BATS).
Two Canadian university
teams wjll travel to Stanford's
Maloney field this week.
