# Dante made of Iron

### Jim Elfers 
Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti, who guided this year's
Cardinal water polo team to a
national championship, placed
sixth in the 1981 International
Triathalon. The event, which
took place last Saturday in Ha
waii, is one that most athletes
would be pleased just to finish.
The grueling day-long test
consists of a 2V2-mile swim in
the Pacific, followed by 112
miles of bicycling and a run
(walking and crawling also al
lowed) of 26 miles. While the
running portion alone con
stitutes a marathon, the com
bined effect of such punishment
is, needless to say, an intense
physical and mental drain.
First to finish was John How
ard of the United States. How
ard, perhaps the best bicyclist
in the nation, was the only con
testant in Dettamanti's age
group to finish before him. How
ard's victory did not surprise
Dettamanti as the bicyclist fin
ished second last year and
worked to improve his weakest
event, the swim. For Dettaman
ti the goal was not so much to
win as to finish.
Dante was in 31st place in a
field of nearly 400 after the
swim. He considered this his
weakest leg of the Triathalon
and was pleased to be that high
up in the pack. Donning his bik
ing gear, he set off for 112 miles
of riding along the Kona Coast of
Hawaii.
The course took him through
an incessant series of lava
fields, the monotony was only
broken up when he passed other
contestants or paused at an aid
station to refil his water bottle.
Eight miles into the race, John
Howard, who had finished the
swim behind the coach, pedaled
by in what was obviously his
strongest leg of the race. But
Howard was one of very few to
pass Dettamanti, and at the end
of the bicycling, unhampered by

flat tires, Dante had moved up
into tenth place.
At this point he was nearly
seven hours into the race, and
now his abused legs had to pro
pel his body the 26 miles to the
finish line. The marathon,
logically, was the most demand
ing segment of the day for Det
tamanti. He had to call upon
physical and mental reserves
already depleted by the preced
ing 115 miles and coax himself
onward.
Asked if he had felt like quit
ting the race, Dettamanti an
swered, "I never felt like quit
ting, but I sure felt like stopping
to rest." Yet except for a few
uphill stretches he essentially
ran the entire 26 miles, walking
only through the aid stations,
where he quaffed "defizzed"
Coke and an occasional banana.
Over the course of the day he
ate five bananas, three oranges,
numerous dates and raisins, and
drank countless glasses of wa
ter and Coke, all in an attempt
to replenish the vast amount of
energy he was burning up.
Toward the end of the mara
thon Dante felt (relatively)
Strong, and in the last four miles
passed a runner to move into
fifth place. This was soon al
tered as he in turn was passed
and fell back to sixth. He
skipped the last few aid sta
tions, urged on by the crowd,
and came across the finish line
in a most respectable sixth
place.
With a time of 10 hours-29
minutes, he had attained second
place in his age group to overall
winner Howard. Howard is 32
years old, Dettamanti 38.
Reflecting upon his emotions
at the end of the race, Det
tamanti remarked that he was
exultant both to have finished so
high and to have just plain fin
ished. "To finish the marathon
you have to put yourself in a
trance and just gut it out," he
explained.

miles of bicycling and a run
(walking and crawling also al
lowed) of 26 miles. While the
running portion alone con
stitutes a marathon, the com
bined effect of such punishment
is, needless to say, an intense
physical and mental drain.
First to finish was John How
ard of the United States. How
ard, perhaps the best bicyclist
in the nation, was the only con
testant in Dettamanti's age
group to finish before him. How
ard's victory did not surprise
Dettamanti as the bicyclist fin
ished second last year and
worked to improve his weakest
event, the swim. For Dettaman
ti the goal was not so much to
win as to finish.
Dante was in 31st place in a
field of nearly 400 after the
swim. He considered this his
weakest leg of the Triathalon
and was pleased to be that high
up in the pack. Donning his bik
ing gear, he set off for 112 miles
of riding along the Kona Coast of
Hawaii.
The course took him through
an incessant series of lava
fields, the monotony was only
broken up when he passed other
contestants or paused at an aid
station to refil his water bottle.
Eight miles into the race, John
Howard, who had finished the
swim behind the coach, pedaled
by in what was obviously his
strongest leg of the race. But
Howard was one of very few to
pass Dettamanti, and at the end
of the bicycling, unhampered by

flat tires, Dante had moved up
into tenth place.
At this point he was nearly
seven hours into the race, and
now his abused legs had to pro
pel his body the 26 miles to the
finish line. The marathon,
logically, was the most demand
ing segment of the day for Det
tamanti. He had to call upon
physical and mental reserves
already depleted by the preced
ing 115 miles and coax himself
onward.
Asked if he had felt like quit
ting the race, Dettamanti an
swered, "I never felt like quit
ting, but I sure felt like stopping
to rest." Yet except for a few
uphill stretches he essentially
ran the entire 26 miles, walking
only through the aid stations,
where he quaffed "defizzed"
Coke and an occasional banana.
Over the course of the day he
ate five bananas, three oranges,
numerous dates and raisins, and
drank countless glasses of wa
ter and Coke, all in an attempt
to replenish the vast amount of
energy he was burning up.
Toward the end of the mara
thon Dante felt (relatively)
Strong, and in the last four miles
passed a runner to move into
fifth place. This was soon al
tered as he in turn was passed
and fell back to sixth. He
skipped the last few aid sta
tions, urged on by the crowd,
and came across the finish line
in a most respectable sixth
place.
With a time of 10 hours-29
minutes, he had attained second
place in his age group to overall
winner Howard. Howard is 32
years old, Dettamanti 38.
Reflecting upon his emotions
at the end of the race, Det
tamanti remarked that he was
exultant both to have finished so
high and to have just plain fin
ished. "To finish the marathon
you have to put yourself in a
trance and just gut it out," he
explained.
