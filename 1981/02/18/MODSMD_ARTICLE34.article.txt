# Disappointing weekend
## Netters fall to USC, Santa Cruz 
### Sally Jenkins 
Stanford's young volleyball
team learned an important les
son last weekend: don't mess
with steely-eyed Trojans, just
nail them where it hurts. Right
in the old Achilles tendon if pos
sible.
USC didn't give the Cardinals
the time of day, defeating them
Saturday night 15-3, 15-11, 15-11.
According to coach Frank
Sturm, "it was no fun at all."
He did see some good through
all the devastation, however.
His team will head south Friday
to face another giant, N0.2
ranked UCLA. The experience
against USC may leave the
Cardinals a lttle better pre
pared, and a lot hungrier.
After good showings in two
US Volleyball Association tour
neys, the Cards played an ex
cellent match against San Diego
State last week. Perhaps praise
from coaches and fans left the
Cardinals a little cocky, be
cause the team let down in prac
tice sessions. USC seems to

have brought them up short
"We slacked off after SDS,"
said Sturm. "I am one of those
who believes that you play like
you practice; this is a hard
working team, and SC reminded
us of just how far we have left to
go"
The Trojans seized the up
perhand from the start of the
match, and didn't let go In spite
of a supportive and unusually
large crowd at Maples Pavilion,
the Cardinals couldn't seem to
gain any.momentum.
"We were going to try and get
the jump on them early and es
tablish our own rhythm," said
assistant coach Don Shaw "But
we simply didn't play very well,
not up to our own expectations."
One of the problems may
have been the size of the Trojan
front line. According to Sturm,
Stanford has always had trouble
with teams that are big at the
net because they prevent the
Cardinals from executing. "We
had a difficult time doing what
we do well," he said.

The Cardinals worked hard at
the beginning of this week, ap
parently trying to reverse the
earlier downward trend. Sturm
called Tuesday's practice ses
sion "the best we have had in a
week and a half 'The effort was
unfortunately to no avail, at
least against UC-Santa Cruz last
night at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinals suffered
through an agonizing five game
match, only to lose after win
ning the first two games, 15-7,
15-9. They couldn't come up with
a third victory, losing 15-17,
10-15, and 9-15 in the next three
consecutive games.
Sturm made what might be
called a controversial decision,
which could have contributed to
the loss. After the first team
locked away two games he put
the second team in for the next
two, which they lost. The first
team re-entered the match cold,
as the fifth game score dismally
reflects.
So perhaps coach Sturm has
learned a lesson about steely
eyed surfers from Santa Cruz.
