### Steve Odell 
The Stanford women's ten
nis team breezed to an easy
10-0 victory Tuesday after
noon against Santa Clara, in
the team's season opener at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The Cards dropped only one
set all day, and for the most
part had an easy time of it.
But it was the work Stan
ford had done in preparation
for the match that made it as
easy as it was. Alison Hard
ey, who won at number three
singles, said "All the running
really paid off. I felt great
out there." Sophomore
Caryn Copeland added,
"Those two out of three set
matches in practices have
made a big difference."
Head coach Frank Bren
nan was obviously pleased
with yesterday's per
formances. but he was re
alistic about the match
"These are just sort of
warm-up matches for us.
This doesn't really have any
great significance, except
that we're finally getting
into it. We've been out here
since September."
Copeland set the pace for
the Cards at number one sin
gles. where she destroyed
freshman Carol Bowers, 6-0,
6-0, in a match which took
less than an hour.
At number two singles, it
was All-America Donna
Rubin winning in straight
sets, two and one. Rubin was
pressed into action because
Michelle Weiss, who was ori
ginally scheduled to play
number two, had a cold. She
played admirably in relief,
keeping the pressure on San
ta Clara's Susan Molitor all
afternoon.
Freshman Hardey won her

first match as a Stanford
Cardinal at number three,
trouncing Lucy Eggertsen,
6-2, 6-1. The rookie from San
ta Barbara combined a good
baseline game with a mix
ture of passing shots to claim
the victory.
At number four, it was
Chan opening up her 1981 sea
son with a 6-0, 6-2 win over
Carrie Osborn. And at
number five, it was another
freshman picking up her first
win, where Joanna Girard
dusted SC's Joan Porthan
6-1, 6-2. Girard, from Pacific
Palisades, was in control
throughout the match, caus
ing numerous unforced er
rors.
The battle at number six
singles turned into a classic
marathon affair, but Susie
Barbe fought back from a
one-set deficit to claim a
hardfought 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 win
over Santa Clara's Michelle
Ford. The match, which took
over two and one-half hours,
consisted mainly of baseline
rallies, and Barbe's patience
paid off in the end.
Sophomore Judy Jordan
gained a victory at number
seven singles, with an easy
win over Marianne Belser,
one and two.
In doubles, it was Rubin
and Copeland rolling over
Bowers and Eggertsen at
number one, 6-2, 6-0, The
story was the same in
number two and three
doubles. At two, the team of
Sue Rasmussen and Hardey
ganged up on Osborne and
Molitor, 6-3, 6-2; and at
three, Chan and Girard dis
posed of Ford and Belser,
6-1, 6-4.
