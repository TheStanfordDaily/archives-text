Social Security funds near depletion
Washington — The trust fund that provides the money
for Social Security retirement checks will be depleted by
early 1983 and could be $63.5 billion in the red by 1986. the
Congressional Budget Office said yesterday.
Unless Congress makes changes in the program. the def
icit could grow to $128 9 billion by the start of the 1990 fis
cal year, the arm of Congress told the House subcommit
tee on Social Security.
Congress could keep the system afloat by making such
changes as placing a cap on retirees' annual cost-of-living
adjustments and raising the payroll tax rate, now at 6.65
percent, by 0.5 percent, it suggested.
Raymond Scheppach, the budget office's deputy direc
tor, testified that even if the economy improved during the
next few years, the system would probably weaken
"High levels of unemployment are likely to continue ex
erting pressure on the trust funds, as fewer workers con
tribute payroll taxes and as a number of older workers re
tire sooner than they would have if the labor market were
stronger." he said.
But he said there probably will be an improvement in
the system as the earnings of members of the
War II baby boom increase.
Some 36 million Americans receive benefits from the
system, making it the single largest program in the feder
al government. Made up of three trust funds, it will pay out
$138 billion this year to retired and disabled workers and
their families.
Two of the trust funds. Disability Insurance and Hospi
tal Insurance, are operating in the black. The other, the
Old Age and Survivors Insurance, is nearing depletion
The House subcommittee, chaired by Rep. J.J. Pickle
(D-Texas) is hearing testimony on ways in which Congress
can rescue the system.
Pickle said the major retirement fund "will run short of
reserves to pay a month's benefits sometime in 1982 "
But he added:"This is not an emergency. Nor is it the
12th hour."
Scheppach told the panel that in the 1983 fiscal year,
which begins Oct. 1, 1982. the Old Age fund will have in
come of $143 billion and pay out $158.7 billion, with a year
end deficit of $8.2 billion.
Garrick supports coastal oil drilling
Washington — A high-level White House official from
California said yesterday that despite mounting opposition
in that state, he wholeheartedly supported a decision to
permit offshore oil leasing in four previously protected re
gions off the northern and central California coast.
Moreover, Robert Garrick. deputy counselor to Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, said that he knew of no opposition to
the leasing plan within the administration, whose top of
ficials include more than a dozen Californians.
"As long as we're going to run out of oil, we're going to
have to get it from some place," Garrick said
Garrick, 60. a public relations executive and retired ad
miral, commented on the oil leasing plan and other issues
facing the Reagan adminstration during a breakfast ses

sion with reporters from the Los Angeles Times. Garrick,
who owns oil stock, also disclosed during the discussion
that he was seeking legal advice as to whether he must dis
pose of it to remain in his White House post.
Gov. Edmund Brown has accused the Reagan adminis
tration of "making a radical break with the past and treat
ing California as though it were a colony" in deciding the
oil leasing question Other California officials and en
vironmentalists also are angered over the leasing decision
by Secretary on the Interior James Watt. That decision re
versed an Oct. 16 ruling by the Carter administration and
went against 13 recommendations made by California of
ficials to the Department of Interior over the past six
years.
Garrick brought up his own dilemma about whether he
must dispose of oil stocks when he was asked why Reagan
was taking so long to send names of nominees for second
level positions to Congress for confirmation
He explained that the most thorough conflict-of-interest
check ever conducted by an administration — in line with
laws passed during the Carter administration — had
caused the hold-up.
"It takes a lot of time," he said "You need an accoun
tant. You need an attorney. If you've accumulated any
thing, it's just a cumbersome test.
"And you know how lawyers are. They don't give you the
benefit of the doubt. So you get hung up. I own some oil
stock and I'm not totally cleared yet. I'm trying to figure
out. get the lawyer to tell me do I have to get rid of this
stuff. There are a lot of gray areas in there."
Garrick took issue with a comment earlier by Sen. Rob
ert Byrd tD-W. Va.) the Senate minority leader, that Rea
gan "doesn't have a grasp of issues" and has gotten off to a
slow start.
"I would insist that I think we're off to an excellent
start, moving rapidly, a lot of people getting into place."
Garrick said. "Byrd has a right to his opinion. I would say
the president and his counselors feel they have a grasp of
the issues."
Garrick said that a report presented at a recent White
House senior staff meeting showed that the Reagan ad
ministration was "ahead of several past administrations"
in nominating second-level officials.
Business wants to ease air standards
Washington — American business launched a campaign
yesterday to relax the air quality standards established
under the Clean Air Act, the anti-air-pollution program
that is up for renewal in Congress this year, and which was
attacked by President Ronald Reagan during the 1980 elec
tion campaign
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, through an affiliate,
the National Chamber Foundation, released a scientific
study challenging the health-research data that was used
to set the national standards for emissions of sulfur diox
ide and tiny airborne particles that are associated with
that gas. Both pollutants come largely from electric
power plants.
The analysis of available research indicates that the al

lowable amount of sulfur dioxide emissions could be more
than doubled without any effect on health, the president of
the chamber and the foundation, Richard Lesher, said
At the same time, however, the study conducted by the
American Council on Science and Health reported that no
one knows at what point prolonged exposure to relatively
low levels of those pollutants becomes a health hazard.
Lacking such evidence, the study said, more weight
should be given by Congress to the cost of pollution control
equipment required by the Environmental Protection
Agency to meet the standards set by the Clean Air Act of
1970 as revised by Congress in 1977.
While the study dealt with only one segment of the com
plex anti-pollution law. it raised a general issue that will
be at the heart of the debate that is expected to start this
spring and last all year.
The approach represented by the U.S. Chamber of Com
merce is that the law unfairly errs on the side of health
safety and that each additional step to clean up the air be
comes far more costly than may be jusitifed in terms of
hard-to-measure, or immeasurable, health benefits. That
penalizes business and industry and results in higher
energy costs to consumers, according to critics of the law.
Taking an opposite approach are proponents of the
Clean Air Act concept, including environmental groups,
some health researchers, EPA administrators and others.
Their approach is to err, if necessary, on the side of health
safety until there is enough scientific evidence to show
that standards can be relaxed without affecting health.
Supervisors disavow D.C. gay letter
San Francisco — Even in San Francisco, the most toler
ant of cities, there apparently is a limit — and Supervisor
Carol Silver seems to have exceeded it.
At Silver's request, the San Francisco Board of Super
visors last week sent a sympathetic letter to Rep. Jon
Hinson (R-Miss.) commenting on Hinson's recent arrest
on homosexual charges in a men's room in the Longworth
House Office Building in Washington.
The letter indicated that Silver wanted to "express her
regret that the Capitol Police apparently find it necessary
to conduct invesgations into such incidents involving so
called victimless crime'' when they should be on the street
to combat violent crime.
And it said the Supervisor "hopes that the problem
caused by this incident will soon be over."
But after a storm of protest from outraged constituents
and some less-than-flattering editorial comment in the lo
cal press, Silver's colleagues on the Board of supervisors
did some backpedaling yesterday to dissociate themselves
from her sentiments.
In short, they sought in 30 minutes of debate to make it
clear that the letter, even though it went out on official sta
tionery and over the signature of the board's clerk, ex
pressed the view only of Silver and not the rest of the 11-
member board.
Chairman John Molinari said he was concerned with

"the impression it (the letter I left in the minds of the peo
ple in this country" and wondered whether "the more we
disavow, the more foolish we look " He counseled his col
leagues to "be more cautious about what passes through
here routinely."
And Supervisor Quentin Kopp said he wanted it under
stood that he was "in no way associated with such action
... with respect to this congressman in Washington, D C."
Leading up to yesterday's debate was a deluge of angry
telephone calls to every supervisor — "I got more phone
calls on this than I do on something important like the
budget," Kopp told the Los Angeles Times — and some
sharp criticism in both local newspapers.
'Raging Bull' wins oscar nominations
Hollywood — Raging Bull, a hard view of the prizefight
world, and The Elephant Man, the real-life story of a
freak in Victorian England, won top honors in the 53rd
Academy Award nominations yesterday, scoring in eight
categories each.
Coal Miner's Daughter, the story of Loretta Lynn's rise
to country music stardom, received seven nominations,
followed by Fame, Ordinary People and Tess with six
apiece.
Fame, the story of young people attending a performing
arts high school was released early in 1980 and was some
thing of a surprise with its good showing. Ordinary People,
on the other hand, had been expected to make an even
stronger showing, but it figured where it counts — in the
major categories.
By contrast, The Empire Strikes Hack, by far the big
gest money-maker of the year, managed to collect only
three minor nominations.
Oddly, two of the nominees for best picture were photo
graphed in black and white for purposes of mood — Raging
Hull and Fhe Elephant Man. Also listed for the top prize:
Ordinary People, Coal Miner's Daughter and Tess.
Stocks climb; oil issues soar
New York — The stock market turned higher yesterday,
paced by gains among blue-chip and oil issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 20.73
points last week, ended the day up 8.11 to 939.68.
But advances held only a 745-730 edge over declines on
the New York Stock Exchange, termed "a miserable per
formance," by Lew Smith of Bear, Stearns & Co.
Big Board volume totaled 37.94 million shares, against
33.36 million Friday.
Weather
Mostly fair with occasional high clouds today becoming
partly cloudy tomorrow. Patchy night and morning fog.
Lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs in the 60s. Variable
winds to 15 mph.

freak in Victorian England, won top honors in the 53rd
Academy Award nominations yesterday, scoring in eight
categories each.
Coal Miner's Daughter, the story of Loretta Lynn's rise
to country music stardom, received seven nominations,
followed by Fame, Ordinary People and Tess with six
apiece.
Fame, the story of young people attending a performing
arts high school was released early in 1980 and was some
thing of a surprise with its good showing. Ordinary People,
on the other hand, had been expected to make an even
stronger showing, but it figured where it counts — in the
major categories.
By contrast, The Empire Strikes Hack, by far the big
gest money-maker of the year, managed to collect only
three minor nominations.
Oddly, two of the nominees for best picture were photo
graphed in black and white for purposes of mood — Raging
Hull and Fhe Elephant Man. Also listed for the top prize:
Ordinary People, Coal Miner's Daughter and Tess.

Social Security funds near depletion
Washington — The trust fund that provides the money
for Social Security retirement checks will be depleted by
early 1983 and could be $63.5 billion in the red by 1986. the
Congressional Budget Office said yesterday.
Unless Congress makes changes in the program. the def
icit could grow to $128 9 billion by the start of the 1990 fis
cal year, the arm of Congress told the House subcommit
tee on Social Security.
Congress could keep the system afloat by making such
changes as placing a cap on retirees' annual cost-of-living
adjustments and raising the payroll tax rate, now at 6.65
percent, by 0.5 percent, it suggested.
Raymond Scheppach, the budget office's deputy direc
tor, testified that even if the economy improved during the
next few years, the system would probably weaken
"High levels of unemployment are likely to continue ex
erting pressure on the trust funds, as fewer workers con
tribute payroll taxes and as a number of older workers re
tire sooner than they would have if the labor market were
stronger." he said.
But he said there probably will be an improvement in
the system as the earnings of members of the
War II baby boom increase.
Some 36 million Americans receive benefits from the
system, making it the single largest program in the feder
al government. Made up of three trust funds, it will pay out
$138 billion this year to retired and disabled workers and
their families.
Two of the trust funds. Disability Insurance and Hospi
tal Insurance, are operating in the black. The other, the
Old Age and Survivors Insurance, is nearing depletion
The House subcommittee, chaired by Rep. J.J. Pickle
(D-Texas) is hearing testimony on ways in which Congress
can rescue the system.
Pickle said the major retirement fund "will run short of
reserves to pay a month's benefits sometime in 1982 "
But he added:"This is not an emergency. Nor is it the
12th hour."
Scheppach told the panel that in the 1983 fiscal year,
which begins Oct. 1, 1982. the Old Age fund will have in
come of $143 billion and pay out $158.7 billion, with a year
end deficit of $8.2 billion.
Garrick supports coastal oil drilling
Washington — A high-level White House official from
California said yesterday that despite mounting opposition
in that state, he wholeheartedly supported a decision to
permit offshore oil leasing in four previously protected re
gions off the northern and central California coast.
Moreover, Robert Garrick. deputy counselor to Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, said that he knew of no opposition to
the leasing plan within the administration, whose top of
ficials include more than a dozen Californians.
"As long as we're going to run out of oil, we're going to
have to get it from some place," Garrick said
Garrick, 60. a public relations executive and retired ad
miral, commented on the oil leasing plan and other issues
facing the Reagan adminstration during a breakfast ses

sion with reporters from the Los Angeles Times. Garrick,
who owns oil stock, also disclosed during the discussion
that he was seeking legal advice as to whether he must dis
pose of it to remain in his White House post.
Gov. Edmund Brown has accused the Reagan adminis
tration of "making a radical break with the past and treat
ing California as though it were a colony" in deciding the
oil leasing question Other California officials and en
vironmentalists also are angered over the leasing decision
by Secretary on the Interior James Watt. That decision re
versed an Oct. 16 ruling by the Carter administration and
went against 13 recommendations made by California of
ficials to the Department of Interior over the past six
years.
Garrick brought up his own dilemma about whether he
must dispose of oil stocks when he was asked why Reagan
was taking so long to send names of nominees for second
level positions to Congress for confirmation
He explained that the most thorough conflict-of-interest
check ever conducted by an administration — in line with
laws passed during the Carter administration — had
caused the hold-up.
"It takes a lot of time," he said "You need an accoun
tant. You need an attorney. If you've accumulated any
thing, it's just a cumbersome test.
"And you know how lawyers are. They don't give you the
benefit of the doubt. So you get hung up. I own some oil
stock and I'm not totally cleared yet. I'm trying to figure
out. get the lawyer to tell me do I have to get rid of this
stuff. There are a lot of gray areas in there."
Garrick took issue with a comment earlier by Sen. Rob
ert Byrd tD-W. Va.) the Senate minority leader, that Rea
gan "doesn't have a grasp of issues" and has gotten off to a
slow start.
"I would insist that I think we're off to an excellent
start, moving rapidly, a lot of people getting into place."
Garrick said. "Byrd has a right to his opinion. I would say
the president and his counselors feel they have a grasp of
the issues."
Garrick said that a report presented at a recent White
House senior staff meeting showed that the Reagan ad
ministration was "ahead of several past administrations"
in nominating second-level officials.
Business wants to ease air standards
Washington — American business launched a campaign
yesterday to relax the air quality standards established
under the Clean Air Act, the anti-air-pollution program
that is up for renewal in Congress this year, and which was
attacked by President Ronald Reagan during the 1980 elec
tion campaign
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, through an affiliate,
the National Chamber Foundation, released a scientific
study challenging the health-research data that was used
to set the national standards for emissions of sulfur diox
ide and tiny airborne particles that are associated with
that gas. Both pollutants come largely from electric
power plants.
The analysis of available research indicates that the al

lowable amount of sulfur dioxide emissions could be more
than doubled without any effect on health, the president of
the chamber and the foundation, Richard Lesher, said
At the same time, however, the study conducted by the
American Council on Science and Health reported that no
one knows at what point prolonged exposure to relatively
low levels of those pollutants becomes a health hazard.
Lacking such evidence, the study said, more weight
should be given by Congress to the cost of pollution control
equipment required by the Environmental Protection
Agency to meet the standards set by the Clean Air Act of
1970 as revised by Congress in 1977.
While the study dealt with only one segment of the com
plex anti-pollution law. it raised a general issue that will
be at the heart of the debate that is expected to start this
spring and last all year.
The approach represented by the U.S. Chamber of Com
merce is that the law unfairly errs on the side of health
safety and that each additional step to clean up the air be
comes far more costly than may be jusitifed in terms of
hard-to-measure, or immeasurable, health benefits. That
penalizes business and industry and results in higher
energy costs to consumers, according to critics of the law.
Taking an opposite approach are proponents of the
Clean Air Act concept, including environmental groups,
some health researchers, EPA administrators and others.
Their approach is to err, if necessary, on the side of health
safety until there is enough scientific evidence to show
that standards can be relaxed without affecting health.
Supervisors disavow D.C. gay letter
San Francisco — Even in San Francisco, the most toler
ant of cities, there apparently is a limit — and Supervisor
Carol Silver seems to have exceeded it.
At Silver's request, the San Francisco Board of Super
visors last week sent a sympathetic letter to Rep. Jon
Hinson (R-Miss.) commenting on Hinson's recent arrest
on homosexual charges in a men's room in the Longworth
House Office Building in Washington.
The letter indicated that Silver wanted to "express her
regret that the Capitol Police apparently find it necessary
to conduct invesgations into such incidents involving so
called victimless crime'' when they should be on the street
to combat violent crime.
And it said the Supervisor "hopes that the problem
caused by this incident will soon be over."
But after a storm of protest from outraged constituents
and some less-than-flattering editorial comment in the lo
cal press, Silver's colleagues on the Board of supervisors
did some backpedaling yesterday to dissociate themselves
from her sentiments.
In short, they sought in 30 minutes of debate to make it
clear that the letter, even though it went out on official sta
tionery and over the signature of the board's clerk, ex
pressed the view only of Silver and not the rest of the 11-
member board.
Chairman John Molinari said he was concerned with

"the impression it (the letter I left in the minds of the peo
ple in this country" and wondered whether "the more we
disavow, the more foolish we look " He counseled his col
leagues to "be more cautious about what passes through
here routinely."
And Supervisor Quentin Kopp said he wanted it under
stood that he was "in no way associated with such action
... with respect to this congressman in Washington, D C."
Leading up to yesterday's debate was a deluge of angry
telephone calls to every supervisor — "I got more phone
calls on this than I do on something important like the
budget," Kopp told the Los Angeles Times — and some
sharp criticism in both local newspapers.

visors last week sent a sympathetic letter to Rep. Jon
Hinson (R-Miss.) commenting on Hinson's recent arrest
on homosexual charges in a men's room in the Longworth
House Office Building in Washington.
The letter indicated that Silver wanted to "express her
regret that the Capitol Police apparently find it necessary
to conduct invesgations into such incidents involving so
called victimless crime'' when they should be on the street
to combat violent crime.
And it said the Supervisor "hopes that the problem
caused by this incident will soon be over."
But after a storm of protest from outraged constituents
and some less-than-flattering editorial comment in the lo
cal press, Silver's colleagues on the Board of supervisors
did some backpedaling yesterday to dissociate themselves
from her sentiments.
In short, they sought in 30 minutes of debate to make it
clear that the letter, even though it went out on official sta
tionery and over the signature of the board's clerk, ex
pressed the view only of Silver and not the rest of the 11-
member board.
Chairman John Molinari said he was concerned with

"the impression it (the letter I left in the minds of the peo
ple in this country" and wondered whether "the more we
disavow, the more foolish we look " He counseled his col
leagues to "be more cautious about what passes through
here routinely."
And Supervisor Quentin Kopp said he wanted it under
stood that he was "in no way associated with such action
... with respect to this congressman in Washington, D C."
Leading up to yesterday's debate was a deluge of angry
telephone calls to every supervisor — "I got more phone
calls on this than I do on something important like the
budget," Kopp told the Los Angeles Times — and some
sharp criticism in both local newspapers.
'Raging Bull' wins oscar nominations
Hollywood — Raging Bull, a hard view of the prizefight
world, and The Elephant Man, the real-life story of a
freak in Victorian England, won top honors in the 53rd
Academy Award nominations yesterday, scoring in eight
categories each.
Coal Miner's Daughter, the story of Loretta Lynn's rise
to country music stardom, received seven nominations,
followed by Fame, Ordinary People and Tess with six
apiece.
Fame, the story of young people attending a performing
arts high school was released early in 1980 and was some
thing of a surprise with its good showing. Ordinary People,
on the other hand, had been expected to make an even
stronger showing, but it figured where it counts — in the
major categories.
By contrast, The Empire Strikes Hack, by far the big
gest money-maker of the year, managed to collect only
three minor nominations.
Oddly, two of the nominees for best picture were photo
graphed in black and white for purposes of mood — Raging
Hull and Fhe Elephant Man. Also listed for the top prize:
Ordinary People, Coal Miner's Daughter and Tess.

Social Security funds near depletion
Washington — The trust fund that provides the money
for Social Security retirement checks will be depleted by
early 1983 and could be $63.5 billion in the red by 1986. the
Congressional Budget Office said yesterday.
Unless Congress makes changes in the program. the def
icit could grow to $128 9 billion by the start of the 1990 fis
cal year, the arm of Congress told the House subcommit
tee on Social Security.
Congress could keep the system afloat by making such
changes as placing a cap on retirees' annual cost-of-living
adjustments and raising the payroll tax rate, now at 6.65
percent, by 0.5 percent, it suggested.
Raymond Scheppach, the budget office's deputy direc
tor, testified that even if the economy improved during the
next few years, the system would probably weaken
"High levels of unemployment are likely to continue ex
erting pressure on the trust funds, as fewer workers con
tribute payroll taxes and as a number of older workers re
tire sooner than they would have if the labor market were
stronger." he said.
But he said there probably will be an improvement in
the system as the earnings of members of the
War II baby boom increase.
Some 36 million Americans receive benefits from the
system, making it the single largest program in the feder
al government. Made up of three trust funds, it will pay out
$138 billion this year to retired and disabled workers and
their families.
Two of the trust funds. Disability Insurance and Hospi
tal Insurance, are operating in the black. The other, the
Old Age and Survivors Insurance, is nearing depletion
The House subcommittee, chaired by Rep. J.J. Pickle
(D-Texas) is hearing testimony on ways in which Congress
can rescue the system.
Pickle said the major retirement fund "will run short of
reserves to pay a month's benefits sometime in 1982 "
But he added:"This is not an emergency. Nor is it the
12th hour."
Scheppach told the panel that in the 1983 fiscal year,
which begins Oct. 1, 1982. the Old Age fund will have in
come of $143 billion and pay out $158.7 billion, with a year
end deficit of $8.2 billion.
Garrick supports coastal oil drilling
Washington — A high-level White House official from
California said yesterday that despite mounting opposition
in that state, he wholeheartedly supported a decision to
permit offshore oil leasing in four previously protected re
gions off the northern and central California coast.
Moreover, Robert Garrick. deputy counselor to Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, said that he knew of no opposition to
the leasing plan within the administration, whose top of
ficials include more than a dozen Californians.
"As long as we're going to run out of oil, we're going to
have to get it from some place," Garrick said
Garrick, 60. a public relations executive and retired ad
miral, commented on the oil leasing plan and other issues
facing the Reagan adminstration during a breakfast ses

sion with reporters from the Los Angeles Times. Garrick,
who owns oil stock, also disclosed during the discussion
that he was seeking legal advice as to whether he must dis
pose of it to remain in his White House post.
Gov. Edmund Brown has accused the Reagan adminis
tration of "making a radical break with the past and treat
ing California as though it were a colony" in deciding the
oil leasing question Other California officials and en
vironmentalists also are angered over the leasing decision
by Secretary on the Interior James Watt. That decision re
versed an Oct. 16 ruling by the Carter administration and
went against 13 recommendations made by California of
ficials to the Department of Interior over the past six
years.
Garrick brought up his own dilemma about whether he
must dispose of oil stocks when he was asked why Reagan
was taking so long to send names of nominees for second
level positions to Congress for confirmation
He explained that the most thorough conflict-of-interest
check ever conducted by an administration — in line with
laws passed during the Carter administration — had
caused the hold-up.
"It takes a lot of time," he said "You need an accoun
tant. You need an attorney. If you've accumulated any
thing, it's just a cumbersome test.
"And you know how lawyers are. They don't give you the
benefit of the doubt. So you get hung up. I own some oil
stock and I'm not totally cleared yet. I'm trying to figure
out. get the lawyer to tell me do I have to get rid of this
stuff. There are a lot of gray areas in there."
Garrick took issue with a comment earlier by Sen. Rob
ert Byrd tD-W. Va.) the Senate minority leader, that Rea
gan "doesn't have a grasp of issues" and has gotten off to a
slow start.
"I would insist that I think we're off to an excellent
start, moving rapidly, a lot of people getting into place."
Garrick said. "Byrd has a right to his opinion. I would say
the president and his counselors feel they have a grasp of
the issues."
Garrick said that a report presented at a recent White
House senior staff meeting showed that the Reagan ad
ministration was "ahead of several past administrations"
in nominating second-level officials.
Business wants to ease air standards
Washington — American business launched a campaign
yesterday to relax the air quality standards established
under the Clean Air Act, the anti-air-pollution program
that is up for renewal in Congress this year, and which was
attacked by President Ronald Reagan during the 1980 elec
tion campaign
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, through an affiliate,
the National Chamber Foundation, released a scientific
study challenging the health-research data that was used
to set the national standards for emissions of sulfur diox
ide and tiny airborne particles that are associated with
that gas. Both pollutants come largely from electric
power plants.
The analysis of available research indicates that the al

lowable amount of sulfur dioxide emissions could be more
than doubled without any effect on health, the president of
the chamber and the foundation, Richard Lesher, said
At the same time, however, the study conducted by the
American Council on Science and Health reported that no
one knows at what point prolonged exposure to relatively
low levels of those pollutants becomes a health hazard.
Lacking such evidence, the study said, more weight
should be given by Congress to the cost of pollution control
equipment required by the Environmental Protection
Agency to meet the standards set by the Clean Air Act of
1970 as revised by Congress in 1977.
While the study dealt with only one segment of the com
plex anti-pollution law. it raised a general issue that will
be at the heart of the debate that is expected to start this
spring and last all year.
The approach represented by the U.S. Chamber of Com
merce is that the law unfairly errs on the side of health
safety and that each additional step to clean up the air be
comes far more costly than may be jusitifed in terms of
hard-to-measure, or immeasurable, health benefits. That
penalizes business and industry and results in higher
energy costs to consumers, according to critics of the law.
Taking an opposite approach are proponents of the
Clean Air Act concept, including environmental groups,
some health researchers, EPA administrators and others.
Their approach is to err, if necessary, on the side of health
safety until there is enough scientific evidence to show
that standards can be relaxed without affecting health.

ide and tiny airborne particles that are associated with
that gas. Both pollutants come largely from electric
power plants.
The analysis of available research indicates that the al

lowable amount of sulfur dioxide emissions could be more
than doubled without any effect on health, the president of
the chamber and the foundation, Richard Lesher, said
At the same time, however, the study conducted by the
American Council on Science and Health reported that no
one knows at what point prolonged exposure to relatively
low levels of those pollutants becomes a health hazard.
Lacking such evidence, the study said, more weight
should be given by Congress to the cost of pollution control
equipment required by the Environmental Protection
Agency to meet the standards set by the Clean Air Act of
1970 as revised by Congress in 1977.
While the study dealt with only one segment of the com
plex anti-pollution law. it raised a general issue that will
be at the heart of the debate that is expected to start this
spring and last all year.
The approach represented by the U.S. Chamber of Com
merce is that the law unfairly errs on the side of health
safety and that each additional step to clean up the air be
comes far more costly than may be jusitifed in terms of
hard-to-measure, or immeasurable, health benefits. That
penalizes business and industry and results in higher
energy costs to consumers, according to critics of the law.
Taking an opposite approach are proponents of the
Clean Air Act concept, including environmental groups,
some health researchers, EPA administrators and others.
Their approach is to err, if necessary, on the side of health
safety until there is enough scientific evidence to show
that standards can be relaxed without affecting health.
Supervisors disavow D.C. gay letter
San Francisco — Even in San Francisco, the most toler
ant of cities, there apparently is a limit — and Supervisor
Carol Silver seems to have exceeded it.
At Silver's request, the San Francisco Board of Super
visors last week sent a sympathetic letter to Rep. Jon
Hinson (R-Miss.) commenting on Hinson's recent arrest
on homosexual charges in a men's room in the Longworth
House Office Building in Washington.
The letter indicated that Silver wanted to "express her
regret that the Capitol Police apparently find it necessary
to conduct invesgations into such incidents involving so
called victimless crime'' when they should be on the street
to combat violent crime.
And it said the Supervisor "hopes that the problem
caused by this incident will soon be over."
But after a storm of protest from outraged constituents
and some less-than-flattering editorial comment in the lo
cal press, Silver's colleagues on the Board of supervisors
did some backpedaling yesterday to dissociate themselves
from her sentiments.
In short, they sought in 30 minutes of debate to make it
clear that the letter, even though it went out on official sta
tionery and over the signature of the board's clerk, ex
pressed the view only of Silver and not the rest of the 11-
member board.
Chairman John Molinari said he was concerned with

"the impression it (the letter I left in the minds of the peo
ple in this country" and wondered whether "the more we
disavow, the more foolish we look " He counseled his col
leagues to "be more cautious about what passes through
here routinely."
And Supervisor Quentin Kopp said he wanted it under
stood that he was "in no way associated with such action
... with respect to this congressman in Washington, D C."
Leading up to yesterday's debate was a deluge of angry
telephone calls to every supervisor — "I got more phone
calls on this than I do on something important like the
budget," Kopp told the Los Angeles Times — and some
sharp criticism in both local newspapers.
'Raging Bull' wins oscar nominations
Hollywood — Raging Bull, a hard view of the prizefight
world, and The Elephant Man, the real-life story of a
freak in Victorian England, won top honors in the 53rd
Academy Award nominations yesterday, scoring in eight
categories each.
Coal Miner's Daughter, the story of Loretta Lynn's rise
to country music stardom, received seven nominations,
followed by Fame, Ordinary People and Tess with six
apiece.
Fame, the story of young people attending a performing
arts high school was released early in 1980 and was some
thing of a surprise with its good showing. Ordinary People,
on the other hand, had been expected to make an even
stronger showing, but it figured where it counts — in the
major categories.
By contrast, The Empire Strikes Hack, by far the big
gest money-maker of the year, managed to collect only
three minor nominations.
Oddly, two of the nominees for best picture were photo
graphed in black and white for purposes of mood — Raging
Hull and Fhe Elephant Man. Also listed for the top prize:
Ordinary People, Coal Miner's Daughter and Tess.
Stocks climb; oil issues soar
New York — The stock market turned higher yesterday,
paced by gains among blue-chip and oil issues.

points last week, ended the day up 8.11 to 939.68.
But advances held only a 745-730 edge over declines on
the New York Stock Exchange, termed "a miserable per
formance," by Lew Smith of Bear, Stearns & Co.
Big Board volume totaled 37.94 million shares, against
33.36 million Friday.
