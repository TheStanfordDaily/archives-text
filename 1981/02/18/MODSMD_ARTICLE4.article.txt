Three days after freshman David Hasegawa s Feb. 1
suicide, students here met to discuss the topic of col
lege suicides and to view a film on the subject in
Cedro's lounge.
The discussion, led by Dr. David Dorosin. director of
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), and
Norm Robinson, associate dean of residential educa
tion, was planned before news of Hasegawa s death
reached campus. But at least two of the 20 students who
attended the discussion were Hasegawa's friends; his
death was referred to more than once.
"David was too subtle," one friend said, "he didn t
want to burden people with his problems.
"I wish he (Hasegawa) had fold somebody — but he
didn't,77 Dorosin said and added he believes CAPS is
good at helping people see that suicide is not the answer
to problems. "We're good, but we're not so good that we
can read your head," he said.
Students at the panel argued over which aspects of
University life might push someone to commit suicide.
"When I came here as-a freshman I was really com
petitive and gungo-ho — and I just burnt myself out,
one student said.
Although are open and friendly, "the
openness gets reduced to superficial niceties," another
commented. A third added that "superficiality is ev
erywhere" and that a "good base of friends" is a neces
sity here.
Robinson noted that he's heard students tell him they

"go here for four years and really don't have a good
friend."
Robinson defended University policy concerning
housing, saying he thought the current arrangements
help foster community life here.
The University must balance the demands of stu
dents who, on the one hand, want continuity in house
memberships from year to year and, on the other hand,
don't want to "get frozen out" of any particular resi
dence, like the Row, added Robinson.
Within the houses, Dorosin said, each person has re
sponsibilities in regard to potential suicides.
"The person who has a problem has a responsibility,
too — there's no situation as serious as suicide. Your
roommate can't know unless you tell him. Unless you
say it directly, no one is going to know."
"Everybody else has a responsibility to respond." he
said. For students without a base of friends and in need
of assistance, several organizations exist here to help
those contemplating suicide overcome problems
First, there is CAPS. Dorosin said CAPS sees about
10 percent of the student body each year and, of these,
most are seniors or graduate students. Usually, the
staff sees the same person four to five times and
Dorosin says 85 to 90 percent of these follow-up eases
report feeling better afterward.

Located in Huston House, 575 Salvatierra St., CAPS
is readily accessible. Dorosin said he hopes to increase
CAPS's accessibility by running discussion sessions
similar to Cedrb's discussion and by circulating in
formation on its services.

"We do a lot to make the place as supportive as pos
sible (but) we're not intrusive. We try to decrease the
stigma of seeking help because in the final analysis,
when people are feeling that bad, they must get help,"
he says.
Dorosin said students are "in a transition phase —
you've always lived in a world someone else created.
Now you create your own." If the transition is difficult,
CAPS can help but only if the person lets the staff there
know what his problems are.
A second campus organization designed to help stu
dents overcome difficulties is the Bridge, located at
Salvatierra and Campus Drive.
The Bridge is staffed by four live-in residents, six co
ordinators and 30 volunteers.
According to Barbara Krczyskowka. one of the four
live-in staffers, the Bridge is "oriented toward bring
ing people through crises."
Members of the Bridge are trained as peer counsel
ors for short term therapy and usually offer help to ap
proximately 400 students each year for problems rang
ing from depression to loneliness to rape
The Bridge has not received many calls from people
considering suicide, Krczyskowka said, "If somebody
calls us (about suicide) we try to keep the person talk
ing. find out where they are and what they're taking,"
she says.
"We tend to be very graphic with our questions," she
added. The Bridge counselor will ask the person if he or
she intends to commit suicide and, if so, how.
"It's a crisis situation." she said. "We ask about the

here and now."
Krczyskowka said most suicide callers would be re
ferred to CAPS
There are also suicide hotlines available for use. The
Santa Clara Suicide Hotline at 494-8420 handles about 60
calls each day, according to Dr. Mark Antonucci. direc
tor. "About one quarter of those are what I would call
high risk calls," Antonucci says.
Antonucci said there has been an overall decline in
the suicide rate in Santa Clara County, but that males
age 20 to 29 are the highest on the incident list for any 10-
year group.
The hotline is staffed by 60 to 80 volunteers who have
received basic training in suicide causes and preven
tion, Antonucci says.
A second suicide hotline is run by San Francisco Sui
cide Prevention, Inc. at 752-4866.
Mirna Choy-Murillo, director of the San Francisco
hotline, said her organization handles 32.000 calls each
year.
"There's a really fine line between depression and
suicide," she added, but estimates between five and 10
percent of the calls are emergencies. Of those calls,
most are from people under 29 years of age The hotline
has received calls from students at the University of
San Francisco, San Francisco State and City College,
according to Choy-Murillo. She added she does not be
lieve the line has received calls from Stanford students
Like most of the organization staffers contacted,
Choy-Murillo sees her organization as part of a men
tal health community."
