# Explaining behavior: is sociobiology valid?
## How genes may determine actions 
### Coleen Fitzpatrick 
Sociobiology is defined as the
biological basis for social be
havior. Inherent in the argu
ment is that much of an or
ganism's behavior is de
termined by the genes, rather
than a product of environmental
influence
The sociobiologist doctrine
begins with the Darwinian theo
ry of evolution. Like Darwin, so
ciobiologists believe that the
key to the biological under
standing of animal features, in
cluding behavior, is evolution
through natural selection.
Those organisms that are bet
ter adapted to the environment
out reproduce the rest, and
more copies of their genes will
be represented in the next gen
eration.
Sociobiologists have asserted
that natural selection operates
at the level of the individual.
Since organisms often must
compete for survival, seem
ingly group-motivated behav
iors such as altruism create a
paradox. From a biological
viewpoint, altruism means be
having in a way that helps the
reproductive chances of another
organism, apparently
diminishing one's own chances
How can sacrificing one's life
increase the probability of leav
ing descendants? Darwin recog
nised the paradox in the case of
social insects, such as bees. A
whole caste of these insects, the
workers, are sterile and spend
their lives taking care of the
queen and their newborn sis
ters.

According to Edward Wilson,
who first used the term soci
obiology in his 1975 book of the
same name, the dilemma posed
by altruism is "the central theo
retical problem of soci
obiology."

For a long time the problem
was dismissed by depicting
selection as favoring ' the good
of the species " It was in 1955
that biologist J.B.S. Haldane
put forward the idea of kin
selection: that organisms may
behave in seemingly altruistic
ways in order to save close rela
tives with whom the organism
may share a number of genes.
But it was not until 1964 that
biologist William Hamilton pro
vided the idea of kin selection
with a more precise
mathematical formulation.
Hamilton argued that the so
cial insects, such as ants and
bees, have a peculiar genetic re
lationship to each other. Not
only are worker ants and bees
sisters but they have 3/4 of their
in common instead of 1/2,
the average percentage of genes
shared between siblings in most
animal species. So through the
genetic calculus, it is in the
worker's own genetic self-in
terest not to breed but to assist
the queen in producing more sis
ters, thereby producing more
copies of their genes than if they
produced 50 percent-related off
spring of their own.
It is not the individual that
counts in evolution, soci
obiologists claim, it is the gene.
Individuals are reduced to mere
vehicles for the survival of their
genes. Natural selection acts
upon the individual, but it is the
compliment of genes which de
termines the individual's fit
ness. As Richard Dawkins puts
it in his 1976 book The Selfish
dene. "The genes march
on. . . . They are the replicators
and we are their survival ma
chines. When we have served
our purpose we are cast aside.
But genes arethe denizens of ge
ological time: genes are forev
er.''
The principle of kin selection
as applied to social insects has

been extended by soci
obiologists to humans. On the
average, we share half of our
genes with our brothers and sis
ters. so if an individual sacri
fices it's own reproduction, as in
homosexuality, in order to en
hance the survival of more than
two siblings, that person's genes
will still be represented in the
next generation, in the siblings'
offspring.
Sociobiology does not deny
the existence of sharing and co
operation. it only predicts that it
will be rare.
Other examples of altruistic
behavior, however, require
further explanation. Some birds
cry out, in the absence of im

mediate relatives, alerting
their flock to the presence of
predators, yet endangering
themselves in the process. Rob
ert Trivers. a sociobiologist at
UC Santa Cruz has proposed a
solution, a biological version of
"I scratch your back if you
scratch mine": individuals pro
vide favors because the favor
will eventually be returned.
The applicability of soci
obiology to human behavior has
been the target of much
criticism, and the debate is like
ly to continue for some time.
But this rapidly growing field
has contributed much to the un
derstanding of the genetic bases
of behavior through concepts
such as kin selection and re
ciprocal altruism.

our purpose we are cast aside.
But genes arethe denizens of ge
ological time: genes are forev

The principle of kin selection
as applied to social insects has

been extended by soci
obiologists to humans. On the
average, we share half of our
genes with our brothers and sis
ters. so if an individual sacri
fices it's own reproduction, as in
homosexuality, in order to en
hance the survival of more than
two siblings, that person's genes
will still be represented in the
next generation, in the siblings'
offspring.
Sociobiology does not deny
the existence of sharing and co
operation. it only predicts that it
will be rare.
Other examples of altruistic
behavior, however, require
further explanation. Some birds
cry out, in the absence of im

mediate relatives, alerting
their flock to the presence of
predators, yet endangering
themselves in the process. Rob
ert Trivers. a sociobiologist at
UC Santa Cruz has proposed a
solution, a biological version of
"I scratch your back if you
scratch mine": individuals pro
vide favors because the favor
will eventually be returned.
The applicability of soci
obiology to human behavior has
been the target of much
criticism, and the debate is like
ly to continue for some time.
But this rapidly growing field
has contributed much to the un
derstanding of the genetic bases
of behavior through concepts
such as kin selection and re
ciprocal altruism.

Charles Darwin in better times.
Sociobiology is defined as the
biological basis for social be
havior. Inherent in the argu
ment is that much of an or
ganism's behavior is de
termined by the genes, rather
than a product of environmental
influence
The sociobiologist doctrine
begins with the Darwinian theo
ry of evolution. Like Darwin, so
ciobiologists believe that the
key to the biological under
standing of animal features, in
cluding behavior, is evolution
through natural selection.
Those organisms that are bet
ter adapted to the environment
out reproduce the rest, and
more copies of their genes will
be represented in the next gen
eration.
Sociobiologists have asserted
that natural selection operates
at the level of the individual.
Since organisms often must
compete for survival, seem
ingly group-motivated behav
iors such as altruism create a
paradox. From a biological
viewpoint, altruism means be
having in a way that helps the
reproductive chances of another
organism, apparently
diminishing one's own chances
How can sacrificing one's life
increase the probability of leav
ing descendants? Darwin recog
nised the paradox in the case of
social insects, such as bees. A
whole caste of these insects, the
workers, are sterile and spend
their lives taking care of the
queen and their newborn sis
ters.

According to Edward Wilson,
who first used the term soci
obiology in his 1975 book of the
same name, the dilemma posed
by altruism is "the central theo
retical problem of soci
obiology."

For a long time the problem
was dismissed by depicting
selection as favoring ' the good
of the species " It was in 1955
that biologist J.B.S. Haldane
put forward the idea of kin
selection: that organisms may
behave in seemingly altruistic
ways in order to save close rela
tives with whom the organism
may share a number of genes.
But it was not until 1964 that
biologist William Hamilton pro
vided the idea of kin selection
with a more precise
mathematical formulation.
Hamilton argued that the so
cial insects, such as ants and
bees, have a peculiar genetic re
lationship to each other. Not
only are worker ants and bees
sisters but they have 3/4 of their
in common instead of 1/2,
the average percentage of genes
shared between siblings in most
animal species. So through the
genetic calculus, it is in the
worker's own genetic self-in
terest not to breed but to assist
the queen in producing more sis
ters, thereby producing more
copies of their genes than if they
produced 50 percent-related off
spring of their own.
It is not the individual that
counts in evolution, soci
obiologists claim, it is the gene.
Individuals are reduced to mere
vehicles for the survival of their
genes. Natural selection acts
upon the individual, but it is the
compliment of genes which de
termines the individual's fit
ness. As Richard Dawkins puts
it in his 1976 book The Selfish
dene. "The genes march
on. . . . They are the replicators
and we are their survival ma
chines. When we have served
our purpose we are cast aside.
But genes arethe denizens of ge
ological time: genes are forev
