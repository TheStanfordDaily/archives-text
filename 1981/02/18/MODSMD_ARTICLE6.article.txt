# Durham on yams and malaria...
## 
### 
()rrr long periods of time cul
turc and biology work together
to provide an adaptation to a
fUirtie it la r environment.
Durham has recently concen
trated <m two examples of adap
tation that can he explaihed
through his interactive model:
thu evolution of the ability to
digest mill; through adulthood
in the Northern hemisphere
and the peculiar yam taboo and
harvest festival of West Africa.
What follows is Durham \s sum
mary of his research on the sub
ject of the yam taboo.
If you look at tropical West
Africa there's a band of rain for
ests and savanah running from
the Ivory Coast through Nigeria
in which there are over 100
tribal groups with a wide diver
sity of social and political struc
tures. But several themes cut
through that diversity: a tre
mendous importance of the cul

tivation of yams and the rituals
and beliefs surrounding their
cultivation.
The curious thing is that the
usual harvest festival is pre
ceeded by a complete ban on the
consumption of yams prior to
the ceremony. Society after so
ciety makes an issue out of it. If
someone violates this taboo, the
belief goes, harm will come to
the community. That harm has
something to do with health.
The prohibition, determined
by priests or local authorities,
occurs sometime during the
rain season, a period of hunger
and malaria.
Yams, it turns out, allow peo
ple to take advantage of the re
sistance to malaria provided by
sickle cell anemia, an often fa
tal genetic blood disease..A
chemical in the yams, thio
cyanate, helps to eliminate the
crippling effects of sickle cell

anemia. Yams, then, provide an
equivalent to chemotherapy.
The catch is that yams, by re
ducing the harmful effects of
sickle cell anemia, reduce the
resistance to malaria as well.
Without yams the cells will
sickle, and thus prevent
malaria. So during the time of
year when malaria is a problem
you do not want to eat yams.
Later when the rains stop the
malaria threat ceases and yam
eating resumes, reducing the
dangers of the sickling cells.
The yam taboo has evolved as
an adaptation to malaria under
the strong selection pressures of
one of the biggest killers in his
tory, malaria, and the de
literious effects of sickle cell
anemia.
The yam taboo is therefore
the outcome of both biological
and cultural processes.
