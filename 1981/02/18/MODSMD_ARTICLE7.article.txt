# Scientists attack Sociobiology

—Traditional sex roles are rooted in brain
differences between males and females.
—Mathematical formulas exist to predict
women's fashions.
—Patriotism, racism,and fear of strangers
and snakes are a part of our biological
heritage. . .
These statements may sound far-fetched but
each is believed by at least some soci
obiologists who claim to have "scientific" evi
dence to support them. These declarations
may be popular with the press but such catchy
statements are raising eyebrows in scientific
circles.
"Sociobiologists have a capacity for making
headlines whenever they can," said Luigi
Cavalli-Sforza, genetics professor here. "This
is a novelty in science. The custom is to go
through the scientific journals first."
Cavalli-Sforza, who is co-authoring a book on
cultural evolution to appear this spring, thinks
the approach taken by sociobiologists as
"naive."
"Sociobiologists are claiming to give an
swers that cannot be given, but by answering
so many questions they have become popular,"
Cavalli-Sforza said.
The problem is that it is very difficult to
study the interaction of genetics and culture,
according to Cavalli-Sforza.
Only very limited studies of twins reared
apart have been made, which is the only way to
obtain results, according to Cavalli-Sforza,
and their reliability is not high.
Cavalli-Sforza does not denv that we are con
trolled by genes. "We need all the. para
phenalia to be able to behave," he said. What
he denies is any conclusive proof that a partic
ular behavior such as altruism is genetically
controlled.
William Durham, assistant professor of an
thropology here, is of the same mind. When
Harvard Entomologist Edward Wilson argues
for a culture held on the leash of biology he is
ignoring the million years of human evolution,
according to Durham.
What has happened is that there has been a
strong selection for culture. "The capacity for
culture has been selected for in ever increasing
rates over the past three million years. If you
plot cranial capacity against time, there is no
suggestion that biology is somehow holding
back on culture," Durham said.
"Sociobiology is full of assumptions about
what society was like a million years ago but
nobody has bothered to spell out the increasing
role of culture."
The sociobiologists' theory of altruism (see
box) is valid if there are genes for altruism, ac

cording to Cavalli-Sforza Although it is clear
there has to be some genetic basis in insects,
the same cannot necessarily be said for man,
according to Durham.
There is also a problem with extending
analogies from insect to human behavior.
Some of it is. according to Durham, a question
of semantics.
"Sociobiologists are trying to strip down the
meaning of 'altruism' to a relationship be
tween genotypes," said Durham. "Once a
term gets defined in broad and humanistic
terms such as helping the poor, then defining it
so narrowly leads to confusion."
In contrast, Wilson, sociobiology's most out
spoken proponent who talks these days about
genetics setting up probabilities for certain
cultural traits which he calls "culturegens," a
different version of Richard Dawkin's (author
of The Selfish Gene) "memes."
"There is an obsession with cultural parti
cles among sociobiologists," said Durham!
"They are the ether of sociobiology. The idea
that you can take an institution like the Catho
lic Church and start to explain it in terms of
culturegens is absurd." Wilson may not be
analysing the Catholic Church but has, reports
Time magazine, come up with a probabilistic
formula to showhow women's fashions change.
The analogy of biological evolution can be
used to explain how culture evolves, however,
Cavalli-Sforza and Prof. Marcus Feldman of
the Biology department here are coming out
with a book, Cultural Transmission and
Evolution: A Quantitative Approach this
spring.
Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman define their
units of cultural change in an operational way,
according to Cavalli-Sforza.
"You can use many of the concepts used in
the study of evolution. You can even carry over
much of the math. The concepts may be simi
lar but what is behind them is much different,
much more complex," Cavalli-Sforza said.
"Using Cavalli-Sforza atid Feldman's theo
ry predicts how fast a culture will change, giv
en a particular mode of transmission of cul
tural practices. A parent transmits cultural
practices to a child as does a relative or a
school.
"We have looked at who teaches what to
whom," Cavalli-Sforza explained.
One conclusion that Cavalli-Sforza has
drawn is that cultural evolution, especially in
the developing countries, is "much more con
servative then we think. Because the family is
so important we are unlikely to effect impor
tant changes. It is in cultures where the family
is not so important that there is room for rapid
cultural change."

term gets defined in broad and humanistic
terms such as helping the poor, then defining it
so narrowly leads to confusion."
In contrast, Wilson, sociobiology's most out
spoken proponent who talks these days about
genetics setting up probabilities for certain
cultural traits which he calls "culturegens," a
different version of Richard Dawkin's (author
of The Selfish Gene) "memes."
"There is an obsession with cultural parti
cles among sociobiologists," said Durham!
"They are the ether of sociobiology. The idea
that you can take an institution like the Catho
lic Church and start to explain it in terms of
culturegens is absurd." Wilson may not be
analysing the Catholic Church but has, reports
Time magazine, come up with a probabilistic
formula to showhow women's fashions change.
The analogy of biological evolution can be
used to explain how culture evolves, however,
Cavalli-Sforza and Prof. Marcus Feldman of
the Biology department here are coming out
with a book, Cultural Transmission and
Evolution: A Quantitative Approach this
spring.
Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman define their
units of cultural change in an operational way,
according to Cavalli-Sforza.
"You can use many of the concepts used in
the study of evolution. You can even carry over
much of the math. The concepts may be simi
lar but what is behind them is much different,
much more complex," Cavalli-Sforza said.
"Using Cavalli-Sforza atid Feldman's theo
ry predicts how fast a culture will change, giv
en a particular mode of transmission of cul
tural practices. A parent transmits cultural
practices to a child as does a relative or a
school.
"We have looked at who teaches what to
whom," Cavalli-Sforza explained.
One conclusion that Cavalli-Sforza has
drawn is that cultural evolution, especially in
the developing countries, is "much more con
servative then we think. Because the family is
so important we are unlikely to effect impor
tant changes. It is in cultures where the family
is not so important that there is room for rapid
cultural change."
—Traditional sex roles are rooted in brain
differences between males and females.
—Mathematical formulas exist to predict
women's fashions.
—Patriotism, racism,and fear of strangers
and snakes are a part of our biological
heritage. . .
These statements may sound far-fetched but
each is believed by at least some soci
obiologists who claim to have "scientific" evi
dence to support them. These declarations
may be popular with the press but such catchy
statements are raising eyebrows in scientific
circles.
"Sociobiologists have a capacity for making
headlines whenever they can," said Luigi
Cavalli-Sforza, genetics professor here. "This
is a novelty in science. The custom is to go
through the scientific journals first."
Cavalli-Sforza, who is co-authoring a book on
cultural evolution to appear this spring, thinks
the approach taken by sociobiologists as
"naive."
"Sociobiologists are claiming to give an
swers that cannot be given, but by answering
so many questions they have become popular,"
Cavalli-Sforza said.
The problem is that it is very difficult to
study the interaction of genetics and culture,
according to Cavalli-Sforza.
Only very limited studies of twins reared
apart have been made, which is the only way to
obtain results, according to Cavalli-Sforza,
and their reliability is not high.
Cavalli-Sforza does not denv that we are con
trolled by genes. "We need all the. para
phenalia to be able to behave," he said. What
he denies is any conclusive proof that a partic
ular behavior such as altruism is genetically
controlled.
William Durham, assistant professor of an
thropology here, is of the same mind. When
Harvard Entomologist Edward Wilson argues
for a culture held on the leash of biology he is
ignoring the million years of human evolution,
according to Durham.
What has happened is that there has been a
strong selection for culture. "The capacity for
culture has been selected for in ever increasing
rates over the past three million years. If you
plot cranial capacity against time, there is no
suggestion that biology is somehow holding
back on culture," Durham said.
"Sociobiology is full of assumptions about
what society was like a million years ago but
nobody has bothered to spell out the increasing
role of culture."
The sociobiologists' theory of altruism (see
box) is valid if there are genes for altruism, ac

cording to Cavalli-Sforza Although it is clear
there has to be some genetic basis in insects,
the same cannot necessarily be said for man,
according to Durham.
There is also a problem with extending
analogies from insect to human behavior.
Some of it is. according to Durham, a question
of semantics.
"Sociobiologists are trying to strip down the
meaning of 'altruism' to a relationship be
tween genotypes," said Durham. "Once a
term gets defined in broad and humanistic
terms such as helping the poor, then defining it
so narrowly leads to confusion."
