## Genes and culture interact in adaptation 
### Jiri Weiss 
Seated behind his desk in his office that
is crowded with books on human culture
and evolution, William Durham spoke with
the Daily about his position in the debate
over the interaction of biology and culture.
Do you disagree with sociobiology?
Sociobiology is going to be forced one day
to admit recognize that an emphasis on
biology is one sided. The emphasis is on
biology as the starting and ending point in
the analysis. I think that sociobiologists will
have to recognize that you are dealing with
two copartjjcipants.
My argument is not that evolutionary the
ory is somehow wrong or that it does not ap
ply in any form to human beings. It is dif
ficult to argue that the theory behind soci
obiology is wrong only that is is very in
complete. It leaves out a good deal of the
more interesting parts of human diversity.
The focus has to be on how culture and
biology interact.
Our behavior is tied to the increasing ca
pacity for culture, not pinned to genetic
roots. There is no indication that biology is
somehow holding back on culture. What I
see is evolution providing a capacity
without determining the content.
So you don't see, as some sociobiologists
would suggest, a genetic basis for our moral
ity or altruism ?
Those are so heavily influenced by cul :
ture that it makes no more sense to argue
for a genetic basis than to argue for a genet
ic basis for head hunting or genital mutila
tion.
Does the evolution of culture work in a
similar way us biological evolution?
To a certain degree. With the evolution of
the capacity for culture, freedom was given
to human behavior that on one hand assured
that humanity could adjust to short term
fluctuations in the environment but it also
permits behaviors that may not be consis
tent with the biological model. Soci

obiologists predict that you will not find a
great deal of opposition between culture and
biology. I think that we need to look for op
position, where a cultural adaptation flies in
the face of a successful biological adapta
tion. I would suspect that those cases exist
but that they are relatively short term.
You see culture and tradition as adap
tive, what about something as apparently
maladaptive as war?
There are adaptive wars and there are
maladaptive wars. Wars provide life threat
ening situations. You fight to defend your
self, to hang onto a resource that you need
that is why traditions emerge for dealing
with the problem. I don't think that there is
a gene that determines wars but it is pos
sible for there to be an adaptive war from
time to time.
In his hook, On Human Nature, Edward
Wilson says that everyone has the propensi
ty toward agression would you agree?

'With the evolution of the capacity for culture, freedom
was given to human behavior . . .'

Wilson argues that agressiveness seems
to varies in its form and outlet. It is as if
Wilson was saying that what is biological
about agressiveness is that people have
energy which will find a way to express
itself. It is as if he is using energy and
agression simultaneously which means that
agression becomes a vacuous concept.
You use examples from 'traditional'soci
eties. What about modern culture? Does
this adaptation break down when you have
such a rapid cultural change as we are ex
periencing today?
Of course one of the things that this
analysis hinges on is tradition. What I am in
terested in is how the extent to which cul
tural behaviors that maintain themselves
through long periods of time enhance hu

man adaptation.
Since traditions are maintained only
through human effort, I am betting that cul
tures are likely to maintain traditions only
if there is some kind of regular reinforce
ment.
The sort of rapid cultural change you are
seeing today is yet another step in freedom
from biological adaptation. The cultural
change we see today doesn't represent the
years and years of cumulative ex
perience in dealing with human survival
problems that tradition does.
Could this be dangerous?
When you find cultures changing as rapid
ly as our own I couldn't begin to suggest that
everything will prove to be adaptive in the
long run. If anything, what we have learned
from this is a sense of danger and precau
tion in a cultural milieu where traditions
are changing so rapidlyâ€” you want to watch

out for the long term consequences. What
this kind of study tells you is that it takes a
long time to know what's fully adaptive in a
particular environment.
Don't you see traditional culture as op
pressive and constraining?
It is definitely constraining. Let me give
you an example. There are lots of people in
Africa who say, "I don't know why
we follow this yam taboo,especially when I
am hungry.'' It is constraining in the short
term for the individual but for the greater
good of the individuals and the society over
time. I am not sure that current cultural
forms in the U.S. contain the wisdom of long
standing traditions. Traditions after all,
they emerged over a long period in a partic
ular environment.
