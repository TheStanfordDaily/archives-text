# Brown speaks on 'Cosmopolitan'
## 
### Cathy Shimizu 
Even if she didn't single
handedly start the sexual revo
lution in the 1960'5, Helen
Gurley Brown has certainly
been instrumental in
amalgamating the sexual with
the competitive order of ex
pression in America for the past
eighteen years.
Speaking last Thursday
before Professor Lyle Nelson s
Communication 125: "Prob
lems of the Mass Media" class,
Brown was delightfully and un
abashedly verbal ("I think that
being a sexual object is the most
moral thing in the world")
about her enterprising ideology,
which evolved in 1962 from her
first book "Sex and the Single
Girl." It was from there in 1965
that the "single girl" became
the "Cosmo Girl", as Brown
catapulted to a spectacular pro
fessional career as editor-in
chief of "Cosmopolitan", which
is today one of the top five US
newsrack (as opposed to sub
scription) moneymakers in
circulation.
For the uninitiated, Cosmo is
a forerunner of the ever
expanding genre of "sexually
and-otherwise" liberated wom
en's self-help journals, which
came riding in on a tide of revo
lution set in motion in the 60's by
a rising standard (and cost) of

living, which sent more women t
out in search of employment to
supplement family incomes.,
and even better: sent women
out as independent income
earners. This was the beginning
of Gloria Steinem, Ms., and the
feminist era.
However, there was and still
is the assumption that a woman
is not a complete human being
by herself, and this is where
Brown picked up the cue with
Cosmopolitan. Gaining notorie
ty as well as feminist protests
over the use of bosomy, exotic
— if not artificial — cover girls,
the underlying statement was
obvious: although success and
career are important, "man
trapping" is still a viable preoc
cupation, Over the years that
message has been incorporated
more indirectly; as Brown
pointed out, "why can't a wom
an be a sex object as well as the
president of General Motors?
Born in Green Forest Arkan
sas in 1922, Brown is the pro
totypical Cosmo girl. Overcom
ing a fatherless, financially in
secure Depression childhood
and 18 years of self-support in
various New York secretarial
pools, Brown went on to become
the recipient of many awards in
advertising and journalism, as
well as an honorary alumna of

Stanford in 1977
Already financially secure at
age 37, she then married movie
producer David Brown and went
on to write five books in the
"Sex and the Single Girl"
series, as well as bringing year
ly escalating sales to Cosmo as
editor-in-chief.
But the thing that Brown re
members most clearly is when
she was single and scared.
Which is why, Brown ex
plains, the article in Cosmo to
day "deal with women under
standing their own psyches, as
well as men's, and how to deal
with things such as shyness, an
ger, anxiety ... to help women
get what they want out of life
and assure them they have com
pany; they're not alone."
However, in that regard, Cos
mo represents too many people
— especially college educated
women — the manifestation of
an idea whose moment has al
ready passed. To them, Brown
is selling only half a feminist
message, and many times quite
garbled at that.
A tiny woman, whose ap
parent fragility belies a sur
vivor's determination, Brown
expertly holds her own when
questions, framed in feminist
ideology, begin to assail from

the audience: "Why do you put
those kind of women on the
cover 9 How do you reconcile
your supposed feminist view
point with the statement life
isn't good without a man'?".
Taking a reflective stance,
Brown replied, "Of course it
(Cosmo) is a commercial en
terprise; I'm not putting it out
for the good of humanity, I'm
putting it out for my own good.
But it turns out that what we're
doing is helpful, maybe even in
spirational . . . for many women
not quite ready for the full
feminist burden Male editors
are looking at the demographics
and doing surveys because
they're not quite sure what
women are all about. But I am
me, and I've gotten further
ahead in life by doing those
things that I'm telling other peo
ple how to do, and so I feel justi
fied doing that."
Out of the 14 million readers
of Cosmopolitan, over 11 million
are women. These women ob
viously still need to hear what
Helen Gurley Brown is saying,
and although the feminist
message of "equality and
achievement for women" may
be somewhat garbled, it is in
fact being presented — and en
tertainingly so — to women who
might otherwise not hear it.

Editor-in-chief of ''Cosmopolitan" Magazine, Helen Gurley Brown, fielded questions on her magazine
and the ethics behind it during a visit to the class, Problems of the Mass Media, last Thursday. Gurley,
who single-handedly revamped the publication in 1965, defended it saying the record Cosmo sales since
then are proof enough that people are interested in her "outrageous" ideas.


Helen Gurley Brown herself is the prototypical 'Cosmo Girl.' She
overcame a fatherless childhood during the Depression to become
financially secure at age 37. From there she went on to write five
books and bring spiraling sales to Cosmo.
