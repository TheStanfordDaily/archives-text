Manila, Philippines (AP) —
Pope John Paul II exhorted the
residents of one of Asia's most
wretched slums today to escape
their grinding poverty through
"love, brotherhood and peaceful
solidarity," not "violence, class
struggle or hate."
"Defending the human digni
ty of the poor and their hope for
a human future is not a luxury
for the church, nor is it a
strategy of opportunism, nor a
means for currying favor with
the masses. It is her duty," said
the pope, speaking from a large
platform in Manila's Tondo
slum as a burning sun shot the
temperatures into the 90s.
"Nobody has a keener sense
of justice than the poor who suf
fer the injustices that circum
stances and human selfishness
heap upon them," he continued.
But he warned the slum
dwellers "not to be tempted by
ideologies that preach only ma
terial values or purely temporal

ideals, which separate political,
social and economic develop
ment from the things of the spir
it."
"The road toward your total
liberation is not the way of vio
lence, class struggle or hate; it
is the way of love, brotherhood
and peaceful solidarity," he de
clared.
The pontiff appeared un
perturbed earlier in the day
when an engineering student
wearing a T-shirt with the
slogan "I Love You'' in Spanish
dashed toward him at a univer
sity stadium. Plainclothesmen
arrested him, but he got a papal
embrace.
The youth, Lou Calugcug, 19,
told reporters he wanted to kiss
the pope.
"I kissed his hand, and I told
him I loved him very much," he
said. "I'm not surprised the se
curity people grabbed me. I ex
pected them to."
"People just shouldn't make

a stupid move like that," said a
police official, Rufino Reyes.
"We see Mendoza's ghost in
anybody trying to come near the
Holy Father."
Benjamin Mendoza, a Boli
vian painter, attacked Pope
Paul VI at Manila airport in
1970, slightly wounding him in
the chest with a knife.
Security was noticeably
tightened after the incident.
Plans for the pope to visit a slum
family in Tondo were cancelled,
and he left the slum immediate
ly after his speech.
Police briefly held seven
slum residents including a well
known social activist, Trinidad
Herrera. and "talked them out"
of holding an anti-government
demonstration during the
pope's visit to Tondo, police Col.
Vicente Vinarao said.
John Paul ended the second
day of his six-day visit to the
Philippines by giving Asia's
only Roman Catholic nation its
first candidate for sainthood.
