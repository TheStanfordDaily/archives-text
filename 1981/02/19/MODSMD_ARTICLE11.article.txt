# Are all the alternatives provided?
## CPPC: options examined 
### Sarah HotchkiS 
In universities across the
country, career service offices
provide students with informa
tion and employment contacts
to a vast array of large corpo
rate firms, leaving the small
businesses and public interest
groups sorely under
represented. At Stanford, the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) claims to pro
vide a complete service to stu
dents interested in careers of all
types, not just with the "For
tune 500."
But do they really provide all
the alternatives? Or do students
looking for these diverse em
ployment contacts at the CPPC
leave dissatisfied?
Phil Soto, a senior majoring
in economics and international
relations, doesn't like the at
titude of several CPPC staff
members. "They sound like
they're doing me a favor by talk
ing to me," he said.
Phil tried to use the career
service to help him locate and
secure a job incorporating his
major field at the CPPC," he in
sisted. "I saw a peer counselor,
but I knew more about em
ployment than he did."
Officials at the CPPC, such as
assistant to the director Debbie
Duncan, assert that their office
employs two professional liber
al arts career counselors and
eight peer counselors. In addi

tion, Duncan occasionally ad
vises upon referral. These coun
selors provide help with most
aspects of job hunting for stu
dents on an appointment or
walk-in basis.
According to Soto, employers
who might hire graduates in his
field "just aren't coming to the
CPPC." When companies do in
terview with liberal arts majors
at Stanford, long lines often re
sult from the great demand for
interviews, and the limited
number of students for each in
terview. The competition to
sign up frustrates and in
timidates many students. Some
students feel the interviews for
liberal arts majors at the CPPC
aren't worth a short wait, much
less a night spent outside the
building.
Senior Dick Rose describes
his experience with the in
terview as "informational",
and often, claim both Soto and
Rose, the same set of names
crop up on a majority of the
sign-up lists for companies
seeking non-technical, non-sci
ence students. Undoubtedly,
this group of liberal arts majors
have more persistence than oth
ers bidding for the same in
terviews.
Alternatives to the present
system include pre-selection by
the prospective employers, or a
lottery conducted by the CPPC
staff to eliminate extra can

didates for each interview.
The difficulties associated
with interviews concern many
students, but what about com
panies that don't recruit
through the CPPC? How does a
"soon-to-graduate" senior find
contacts to these smaller com
panies or interest groups?
Suggested resources at Stan
ford other than the CPPC in
clude The Stanford Alumni con
tact service. Bechtel Interna
tional Center, and various de
partments and professors. An
other source of employment
contacts, said senior Mary Anne
Fochek, is the business school li
brary. She uses this library
often, and calls the CPPC "a
good place for general informa
tion."
According to Fochek, who is
seeking details on small invest
ment banks, the listing for em
ployment contacts needs updat
ing. The directory contains
cards on which "they penciled
the date they got the informa
tion and some of the listings are
two or three years old."
Despite these problems, a
majority ot students who use the
CPPC find jobs. Over 7 000 sen
iors and alumni are registered
with the career service this
year. Of that group, the liberal
arts students face the greatest
challenge finding employment.

walk-in basis.
According to Soto, employers
who might hire graduates in his
field "just aren't coming to the
CPPC." When companies do in
terview with liberal arts majors
at Stanford, long lines often re
sult from the great demand for
interviews, and the limited
number of students for each in
terview. The competition to
sign up frustrates and in
timidates many students. Some
students feel the interviews for
liberal arts majors at the CPPC
aren't worth a short wait, much
less a night spent outside the
building.
Senior Dick Rose describes
his experience with the in
terview as "informational",
and often, claim both Soto and
Rose, the same set of names
crop up on a majority of the
sign-up lists for companies
seeking non-technical, non-sci
ence students. Undoubtedly,
this group of liberal arts majors
have more persistence than oth
ers bidding for the same in
terviews.
Alternatives to the present
system include pre-selection by
the prospective employers, or a
lottery conducted by the CPPC
staff to eliminate extra can

didates for each interview.
The difficulties associated
with interviews concern many
students, but what about com
panies that don't recruit
through the CPPC? How does a
"soon-to-graduate" senior find
contacts to these smaller com
panies or interest groups?
Suggested resources at Stan
ford other than the CPPC in
clude The Stanford Alumni con
tact service. Bechtel Interna
tional Center, and various de
partments and professors. An
other source of employment
contacts, said senior Mary Anne
Fochek, is the business school li
brary. She uses this library
often, and calls the CPPC "a
good place for general informa
tion."
According to Fochek, who is
seeking details on small invest
ment banks, the listing for em
ployment contacts needs updat
ing. The directory contains
cards on which "they penciled
the date they got the informa
tion and some of the listings are
two or three years old."
Despite these problems, a
majority ot students who use the
CPPC find jobs. Over 7 000 sen
iors and alumni are registered
with the career service this
year. Of that group, the liberal
arts students face the greatest
challenge finding employment.
There is a great demand for
engineering-science students,
