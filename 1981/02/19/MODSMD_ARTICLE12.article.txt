# In-depth profile:
## Burnham, the man behind Serpico 
### Robin Severns 
We all know that victors write
history, but who actually does
the writing? In the modern age
it is often the journalist who
types out the words which later
become the established version
of the past.
One of those history-makers
is teaching in our very own
Redwood Hall this quarter.
You've heard of Serpico? David
Burnham did the investigation
of the New York Police Depart
ment which inspired the book of
that title. Does the name Karen
Silkwood sound familiar? She
was the union worker who col
lected evidence of safety vio
lations in the atomic industry
and intended to reveal them to
the press. David Burnham was
the reporter she was going to
meet when she was mys
teriously killed in an auto acci
dent.
Burnham has done in
vestigative reporting for the
UPI, the Washington Post, and
the New York Times. Despite
his record as a muckraking in
vestigative journalist, however,
he is neither the fiery-eyed ide
alist nor the tense, world-weary
reporter we associate with the
term muckraker. He is, instead,
sophisticated, friendly, and
very New York. He sits calmly
and answers questions thought
fully. He smiles frequently, ner
vously sometimes. He is of me
dium height and has narrow,
slightly stooped shoulders. He
could be your favorite high
school English teacher but with
a lot more savvy than most high
school teachers have.
What brings David Burnham
to Stanford? "My book," he ex
plains. kicking back in his chair
and putting his feet on the table.
"Sperry Topsiders" say the
labels on the soles. "The goal
... is to describe how modern
telecommunications equipment
based on the computer is in
creasing the power of large pub
lic and private bureaucracies in
relation to the individual."
The Silicon Valley offers nu
merous experts on computers
and their applications.
Burnham came to consult with
them.
Burnham also came to Stan
ford this quarter to fill in as pro
fessor in the Media: Ethics and
Responsibilities course offered
by the Journalism Department.
He finds teaching to be "great
fun . . . having them (students)
ask questions and challenge, it's
really nice."
Burnham got into journalism

but many prospective em
ployers of liberal arts graduates
don't need to recruit through the
CPPC. Assistant to the director
Duncan mentions public rela
tions and journalism as two of
these non-recruiting fields.
Statistics point favorably to
the success of the CPPC with all
students who use the center. Of
the 570 liberal arts students who
registered last year, 398 re
ported they had jobs or had en
tered graduate school. One

almost accidentally.
"I knew I didn't want to be a
businessman, doctor or law
yer," he said. "I decided I'd do
free-lance writing "
He went broke pretty fast but
realized that he really liked to
write. He went to work as a re
porter for a small Washington
news service in 1958. From
there, he moved to UPI and lat
er to the Cronkite Evening News
with CBS. "It was a terrible
job!" he exclaims. "Yes, you
can quote me. Writing for TV is
a terrible job. I don't think peo
ple hear words on TV. Words
just slide around them. Pictures
are so powerful."
Burnham's next job brought
him to a turning point in his life.
He was appointed assistant di
rector of the President's Com
mission on Law Enforcement
and Administration of Justice.
He became a leading expert on
criminal justice.
The New York Times needed
his expertise and hired him to
cover the police department
beat. It wasn't long before
Burnham relaized that his as
signment wasn't broad enough.
Hundreds of crimes are com
mitted in New York City every
day. Which ones should he cov

— worry about the ones you don't get.' —
David Burnham

er? A friend who had worked
with him on the President's
Crime Commission said it for
him first: stories should "iden
tify those habits and procedures
that stop an agency from
achieving its stated goals."
This new emphasis led
Burnham to examine the New
York Police department itself.
The specific crimes were no
longer of interest. They were
valuable only as a means to es
tablish a pattern and under
stand the system as a whole.
Burnham soon discovered that
police officers routinely slept
while on duty. His story on
"cooping" as it was called,
made the front page of the
Times and founded his reputa
tion as a muckraker.
Soon afterwards, two ideal
istic police officers sought him
out to tell him a convoluted tale
of bribery and corruption in the
police department bureau
cracy. One of the police officers
was named Frank Serpico.
Burnham investigated

hundred and twenty did not re
port, 8 withdrew from the labor
market, and 44 continue to
search. "Some of these 120 may
have not found jobs, but this is
still pretty good," said Duncan.
She mentioned the various
workshops such as resume writ
ing, interviewing, and self
assessment as another impor
tant service provided by the
center. Last year, approximate
ly 100 liberal arts students en
rolled in these three workshops
per quarter. In addition, a

Serpico's story and two years
later he made the front page
again with a story about police
corruption in high places.
"That's what made this story
different," Burnham says."It
was a broad problem that in
volved the highest echelons."
"We thought it was dangerous
at the time," Burnham re
sponds to my query. "We were
sure everyone was after us.
Now I don't think so. I don't
think anyone tried to stop us. We
got death threats, though. We
ignored them." He remembers
being pretty upset at the first
threat, however. He called a
friend who was a senior police
official. "Don't worry about the
death threats you get,"his
friend told him. "Worry about
the ones you don't get."
Shortly after the police cor
ruption story broke, Frank
Serpico approached Burnham
with the idea of writing a book.
Burnham was busy writing fol
low-up stories for The New
York Times, however, and
didn't have time. "I don't think I
could have written that book
anyway," says Burnham. "I
was.too close to it, to the peo
ple." So Serpico went to a pub
lisher by himself and the book

and the movie Serpieo resulted.
David Burnham stayed with
The Nete York Times until last
year when he quit to work full
time on his book. How does his
latest literary effort reflect his
philosophy of discovering hin
drances to organizations' stated
goals? Burnham thinks a mo
ment.
"It doesn't really," he re
sponds. "I'm changing some
what. I'm looking at impacts not
considered by the public sector
or by private companies. They
are impacts which interfere
with the great goals of our socie
ty. They represent in some ways
a possible threat to. you know,
to free speech and free associa
tion and free political debate."
Burnham says this softly and
seriously. He values his right to
speak and write his opinions. Is
that why he became a journal
ist?
"I like the power. The power
to affect history." He pauses,
then he amends his statement.
"I don't have power. The New

greater number of students read
CPPC brochures and written
materials rather than partici
pate in workshops.
The "How to . . . Your Re
sume, Cover Letter and In
terview" booklets remain high
ly in demand. "We had 1500 cov
er letter sheets, and they were
gone in two weeks," said Dun
can. If the company or group
doesn't recruite through the
CPPC, the students should send
their cover letter and resume
directly to the prospective em-

York Times has power."
Burnham believes news
papers should use their in
fluence in a responsible
manner. For instance, he thinks
most newspapers cover govern
ment poorly, by not offering ex
tensive, critical analysis of gov
erment actions "Be skeptical
of everything," he advises.
Newspapers tend to be un
critical for many reasons. Re
porters may be too lazy to
analyze their material ade
quately. Furthermore, editors
and owners of newspapers often
identify with the institutions
they report on and tend to have a
simplistic faith in official
statements. This is not always
true, Burnham emphasizes.
Burnham thinks The New
York Times and The Wall
Street ■Journal report pretty
well on government. Marvin
Landauer of The Wall Street
■Journal, Morton Mintz of The
Washington Post and Seymour
Hirsch do good reporting in
Burnham's opinion.
That brings to mind some of
the ethical questions Burnham
covers in his journalism class:
What should the relationship be
tween reporters and their supe
riors be? Who finally decides
what goes into print?
An even tougher question is,
"What is the relationship of a
reporter to the truth?" Are re
porters merely stenographers
or can they comment on the
news? The line between being
an "advocacy reporter," who
promulgates certain points of
view, and being a reporter who
does more than merely repeat
official statements is a fine line
to walk.
On principle, Burnham dis
likes advocacy reporting. Con
sistent with that was his policy
of only examining organizations
along criteria based on their
stated goals. Paraphrasing
Stokely Carmichael, Burnham
says,"the stated goals of most
government agencies are plenty
radical for me."
But he's writing a book on
computers — from the outside.
"I'm looking at impacts not con
sidered by either the public sec
tor or by private companies, "he
says. Perhaps this is another
turning point for Burnham. He
agrees that he's changing. Any
thinking person must. David
Burnham is definitely a thinking
man. Is he an ethical person as
well? "I can't answer that," he
responds. Are ethics important
to him? "Yes," the answer
comes quickly. Write on! ,

ployer, she added.
In the final analysis, the
CPPC offers a wide variety of
career exploration programs,
seminars, workshops, and other
employment aids. Duncan
stressed the importance of stu
dents taking their own initiative
and using the CPPC as soon as
possible. "The CPPC is not here
to make a direct match between
employee and employer; we
give students the tools they need
to find jobs," she added.


The University's Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC)
provides students with complete services including seminars,
workshops and other employment aids. However, some seniors feel

the interviews aren't worth a short wait, much less a night spent
outside the building.

an "advocacy reporter," who
promulgates certain points of

does more than merely repeat
official statements is a fine line
to walk.
On principle, Burnham dis
likes advocacy reporting. Con

stated goals. Paraphrasing
Stokely Carmichael, Burnham

stressed the importance of stu

give students the tools they need

We all know that victors write
history, but who actually does
the writing? In the modern age
it is often the journalist who
types out the words which later
become the established version
of the past.
One of those history-makers
is teaching in our very own
Redwood Hall this quarter.
You've heard of Serpico? David
Burnham did the investigation
of the New York Police Depart
ment which inspired the book of
that title. Does the name Karen
Silkwood sound familiar? She
was the union worker who col
lected evidence of safety vio
lations in the atomic industry
and intended to reveal them to
the press. David Burnham was
the reporter she was going to
meet when she was mys
teriously killed in an auto acci
dent.
Burnham has done in
vestigative reporting for the
UPI, the Washington Post, and
the New York Times. Despite
his record as a muckraking in
vestigative journalist, however,
he is neither the fiery-eyed ide
alist nor the tense, world-weary
reporter we associate with the
term muckraker. He is, instead,
sophisticated, friendly, and
very New York. He sits calmly
and answers questions thought
fully. He smiles frequently, ner
vously sometimes. He is of me
dium height and has narrow,
slightly stooped shoulders. He
could be your favorite high
school English teacher but with
a lot more savvy than most high
school teachers have.
What brings David Burnham
to Stanford? "My book," he ex
plains. kicking back in his chair
and putting his feet on the table.
"Sperry Topsiders" say the
labels on the soles. "The goal
... is to describe how modern
telecommunications equipment
based on the computer is in
creasing the power of large pub
lic and private bureaucracies in
relation to the individual."
The Silicon Valley offers nu
merous experts on computers
and their applications.
Burnham came to consult with
them.
Burnham also came to Stan
ford this quarter to fill in as pro
fessor in the Media: Ethics and
Responsibilities course offered
by the Journalism Department.
He finds teaching to be "great
fun . . . having them (students)
ask questions and challenge, it's
really nice."
Burnham got into journalism

but many prospective em
ployers of liberal arts graduates
don't need to recruit through the
CPPC. Assistant to the director
Duncan mentions public rela
tions and journalism as two of
these non-recruiting fields.
Statistics point favorably to
the success of the CPPC with all
students who use the center. Of
the 570 liberal arts students who
registered last year, 398 re
ported they had jobs or had en
tered graduate school. One

almost accidentally.
"I knew I didn't want to be a
businessman, doctor or law
yer," he said. "I decided I'd do
free-lance writing "
He went broke pretty fast but
realized that he really liked to
write. He went to work as a re
porter for a small Washington
news service in 1958. From
there, he moved to UPI and lat
er to the Cronkite Evening News
with CBS. "It was a terrible
job!" he exclaims. "Yes, you
can quote me. Writing for TV is
a terrible job. I don't think peo
ple hear words on TV. Words
just slide around them. Pictures
are so powerful."
Burnham's next job brought
him to a turning point in his life.
He was appointed assistant di
rector of the President's Com
mission on Law Enforcement
and Administration of Justice.
He became a leading expert on
criminal justice.
The New York Times needed
his expertise and hired him to
cover the police department
beat. It wasn't long before
Burnham relaized that his as
signment wasn't broad enough.
Hundreds of crimes are com
mitted in New York City every
day. Which ones should he cov

er? A friend who had worked
with him on the President's
Crime Commission said it for
him first: stories should "iden
tify those habits and procedures
that stop an agency from
achieving its stated goals."
This new emphasis led
Burnham to examine the New
York Police department itself.
The specific crimes were no
longer of interest. They were
valuable only as a means to es
tablish a pattern and under
stand the system as a whole.
Burnham soon discovered that
police officers routinely slept
while on duty. His story on
"cooping" as it was called,
made the front page of the
Times and founded his reputa
tion as a muckraker.
Soon afterwards, two ideal
istic police officers sought him
out to tell him a convoluted tale
of bribery and corruption in the
police department bureau
cracy. One of the police officers
was named Frank Serpico.
Burnham investigated

hundred and twenty did not re
port, 8 withdrew from the labor
market, and 44 continue to
search. "Some of these 120 may
have not found jobs, but this is
still pretty good," said Duncan.
She mentioned the various
workshops such as resume writ
ing, interviewing, and self
assessment as another impor
tant service provided by the
center. Last year, approximate
ly 100 liberal arts students en
rolled in these three workshops
per quarter. In addition, a

Serpico's story and two years
later he made the front page
again with a story about police
corruption in high places.
"That's what made this story
different," Burnham says."It
was a broad problem that in
volved the highest echelons."
"We thought it was dangerous
at the time," Burnham re
sponds to my query. "We were
sure everyone was after us.
Now I don't think so. I don't
think anyone tried to stop us. We
got death threats, though. We
ignored them." He remembers
being pretty upset at the first
threat, however. He called a
friend who was a senior police
official. "Don't worry about the
death threats you get,"his
friend told him. "Worry about
the ones you don't get."
Shortly after the police cor
ruption story broke, Frank
Serpico approached Burnham
with the idea of writing a book.
Burnham was busy writing fol
low-up stories for The New
York Times, however, and
didn't have time. "I don't think I
could have written that book
anyway," says Burnham. "I
was.too close to it, to the peo
ple." So Serpico went to a pub
lisher by himself and the book

and the movie Serpieo resulted.
David Burnham stayed with
The Nete York Times until last
year when he quit to work full
time on his book. How does his
latest literary effort reflect his
philosophy of discovering hin
drances to organizations' stated
goals? Burnham thinks a mo
ment.
"It doesn't really," he re
sponds. "I'm changing some
what. I'm looking at impacts not
considered by the public sector
or by private companies. They
are impacts which interfere
with the great goals of our socie
ty. They represent in some ways
a possible threat to. you know,
to free speech and free associa
tion and free political debate."
Burnham says this softly and
seriously. He values his right to
speak and write his opinions. Is
that why he became a journal
ist?
"I like the power. The power
to affect history." He pauses,
then he amends his statement.
"I don't have power. The New

greater number of students read
CPPC brochures and written
materials rather than partici
pate in workshops.
The "How to . . . Your Re
sume, Cover Letter and In
terview" booklets remain high
ly in demand. "We had 1500 cov
er letter sheets, and they were
gone in two weeks," said Dun
can. If the company or group
doesn't recruite through the
CPPC, the students should send
their cover letter and resume
directly to the prospective em-

York Times has power."
Burnham believes news
papers should use their in
fluence in a responsible
manner. For instance, he thinks
most newspapers cover govern
ment poorly, by not offering ex
tensive, critical analysis of gov
erment actions "Be skeptical
of everything," he advises.
Newspapers tend to be un
critical for many reasons. Re
porters may be too lazy to
analyze their material ade
quately. Furthermore, editors
and owners of newspapers often
identify with the institutions
they report on and tend to have a
simplistic faith in official
statements. This is not always
true, Burnham emphasizes.
Burnham thinks The New
York Times and The Wall
Street ■Journal report pretty
well on government. Marvin
Landauer of The Wall Street
■Journal, Morton Mintz of The
Washington Post and Seymour
Hirsch do good reporting in
Burnham's opinion.
That brings to mind some of
the ethical questions Burnham
covers in his journalism class:
What should the relationship be
tween reporters and their supe
riors be? Who finally decides
what goes into print?
An even tougher question is,
"What is the relationship of a
reporter to the truth?" Are re
porters merely stenographers
or can they comment on the
news? The line between being
an "advocacy reporter," who
promulgates certain points of
view, and being a reporter who
does more than merely repeat
official statements is a fine line

Burnham believes news
papers should use their in
fluence in a responsible
manner. For instance, he thinks
most newspapers cover govern
ment poorly, by not offering ex
tensive, critical analysis of gov
erment actions "Be skeptical
of everything," he advises.
Newspapers tend to be un
critical for many reasons. Re
porters may be too lazy to
analyze their material ade
quately. Furthermore, editors
and owners of newspapers often
identify with the institutions
they report on and tend to have a
simplistic faith in official
statements. This is not always
true, Burnham emphasizes.
Burnham thinks The New
York Times and The Wall
Street ■Journal report pretty
well on government. Marvin
Landauer of The Wall Street
■Journal, Morton Mintz of The
Washington Post and Seymour
Hirsch do good reporting in
Burnham's opinion.
That brings to mind some of
the ethical questions Burnham
covers in his journalism class:
What should the relationship be
tween reporters and their supe
riors be? Who finally decides
what goes into print?
An even tougher question is,
"What is the relationship of a
reporter to the truth?" Are re
porters merely stenographers
or can they comment on the
news? The line between being
an "advocacy reporter," who
promulgates certain points of
view, and being a reporter who
does more than merely repeat
official statements is a fine line
to walk.
On principle, Burnham dis
likes advocacy reporting. Con
sistent with that was his policy
of only examining organizations
along criteria based on their
stated goals. Paraphrasing
Stokely Carmichael, Burnham
says,"the stated goals of most
government agencies are plenty
radical for me."
But he's writing a book on
computers — from the outside.
"I'm looking at impacts not con
sidered by either the public sec
tor or by private companies, "he
says. Perhaps this is another
turning point for Burnham. He
agrees that he's changing. Any
thinking person must. David
Burnham is definitely a thinking
man. Is he an ethical person as
well? "I can't answer that," he
responds. Are ethics important
to him? "Yes," the answer
comes quickly. Write on! ,

In the final analysis, the
CPPC offers a wide variety of
career exploration programs,
seminars, workshops, and other
employment aids. Duncan
stressed the importance of stu
dents taking their own initiative
and using the CPPC as soon as
possible. "The CPPC is not here
to make a direct match between
employee and employer; we
give students the tools they need
to find jobs," she added.


The University's Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC)
provides students with complete services including seminars,
workshops and other employment aids. However, some seniors feel

the interviews aren't worth a short wait, much less a night spent
outside the building.
We all know that victors write
history, but who actually does
the writing? In the modern age
it is often the journalist who
types out the words which later
become the established version
of the past.
One of those history-makers
is teaching in our very own
Redwood Hall this quarter.
You've heard of Serpico? David
Burnham did the investigation
of the New York Police Depart
ment which inspired the book of
that title. Does the name Karen
Silkwood sound familiar? She
was the union worker who col
lected evidence of safety vio
lations in the atomic industry
and intended to reveal them to
the press. David Burnham was
the reporter she was going to
meet when she was mys
teriously killed in an auto acci
dent.
Burnham has done in
vestigative reporting for the
UPI, the Washington Post, and
the New York Times. Despite
his record as a muckraking in
vestigative journalist, however,
he is neither the fiery-eyed ide
alist nor the tense, world-weary
reporter we associate with the
term muckraker. He is, instead,
sophisticated, friendly, and
very New York. He sits calmly
and answers questions thought
fully. He smiles frequently, ner
vously sometimes. He is of me
dium height and has narrow,
slightly stooped shoulders. He
could be your favorite high
school English teacher but with
a lot more savvy than most high
school teachers have.
What brings David Burnham
to Stanford? "My book," he ex
plains. kicking back in his chair
and putting his feet on the table.
"Sperry Topsiders" say the
labels on the soles. "The goal
... is to describe how modern
telecommunications equipment
based on the computer is in
creasing the power of large pub
lic and private bureaucracies in
relation to the individual."
The Silicon Valley offers nu
merous experts on computers
and their applications.
Burnham came to consult with
them.
Burnham also came to Stan
ford this quarter to fill in as pro
fessor in the Media: Ethics and
Responsibilities course offered
by the Journalism Department.
He finds teaching to be "great
fun . . . having them (students)
ask questions and challenge, it's
really nice."
Burnham got into journalism

but many prospective em
ployers of liberal arts graduates
don't need to recruit through the
CPPC. Assistant to the director
Duncan mentions public rela
tions and journalism as two of
these non-recruiting fields.
Statistics point favorably to
the success of the CPPC with all
students who use the center. Of
the 570 liberal arts students who
registered last year, 398 re
ported they had jobs or had en
tered graduate school. One

almost accidentally.
"I knew I didn't want to be a
businessman, doctor or law
yer," he said. "I decided I'd do
free-lance writing "
He went broke pretty fast but
realized that he really liked to
write. He went to work as a re
porter for a small Washington
news service in 1958. From
there, he moved to UPI and lat
er to the Cronkite Evening News
with CBS. "It was a terrible
job!" he exclaims. "Yes, you
can quote me. Writing for TV is
a terrible job. I don't think peo
ple hear words on TV. Words
just slide around them. Pictures
are so powerful."
Burnham's next job brought
him to a turning point in his life.
He was appointed assistant di
rector of the President's Com
mission on Law Enforcement
and Administration of Justice.
He became a leading expert on
criminal justice.
The New York Times needed
his expertise and hired him to
cover the police department
beat. It wasn't long before
Burnham relaized that his as
signment wasn't broad enough.
Hundreds of crimes are com
mitted in New York City every
day. Which ones should he cov

er? A friend who had worked
with him on the President's
Crime Commission said it for
him first: stories should "iden
tify those habits and procedures
that stop an agency from
achieving its stated goals."
This new emphasis led
Burnham to examine the New
York Police department itself.
The specific crimes were no
longer of interest. They were
valuable only as a means to es
tablish a pattern and under
stand the system as a whole.
Burnham soon discovered that
police officers routinely slept
while on duty. His story on
"cooping" as it was called,
made the front page of the
Times and founded his reputa
tion as a muckraker.
Soon afterwards, two ideal
istic police officers sought him
out to tell him a convoluted tale
of bribery and corruption in the
police department bureau
cracy. One of the police officers
was named Frank Serpico.
Burnham investigated

hundred and twenty did not re
port, 8 withdrew from the labor
market, and 44 continue to
search. "Some of these 120 may
have not found jobs, but this is
still pretty good," said Duncan.
She mentioned the various
workshops such as resume writ
ing, interviewing, and self
assessment as another impor
tant service provided by the
center. Last year, approximate
ly 100 liberal arts students en
rolled in these three workshops
per quarter. In addition, a

Serpico's story and two years
later he made the front page
again with a story about police
corruption in high places.
"That's what made this story
different," Burnham says."It
was a broad problem that in
volved the highest echelons."
"We thought it was dangerous
at the time," Burnham re
sponds to my query. "We were
sure everyone was after us.
Now I don't think so. I don't
think anyone tried to stop us. We
got death threats, though. We
ignored them." He remembers
being pretty upset at the first
threat, however. He called a
friend who was a senior police
official. "Don't worry about the
death threats you get,"his
friend told him. "Worry about
the ones you don't get."
Shortly after the police cor
ruption story broke, Frank
Serpico approached Burnham
with the idea of writing a book.
Burnham was busy writing fol
low-up stories for The New
York Times, however, and
didn't have time. "I don't think I
could have written that book
anyway," says Burnham. "I
was.too close to it, to the peo
ple." So Serpico went to a pub
lisher by himself and the book

and the movie Serpieo resulted.
David Burnham stayed with
The Nete York Times until last
year when he quit to work full
time on his book. How does his
latest literary effort reflect his
philosophy of discovering hin
drances to organizations' stated
goals? Burnham thinks a mo
ment.
"It doesn't really," he re
sponds. "I'm changing some
what. I'm looking at impacts not
considered by the public sector
or by private companies. They
are impacts which interfere
with the great goals of our socie
ty. They represent in some ways
a possible threat to. you know,
to free speech and free associa
tion and free political debate."
Burnham says this softly and
seriously. He values his right to
speak and write his opinions. Is
that why he became a journal
ist?
"I like the power. The power
to affect history." He pauses,
then he amends his statement.
"I don't have power. The New

CPPC brochures and written
materials rather than partici

death threats you get,"his
friend told him. "Worry about
the ones you don't get."
Shortly after the police cor
ruption story broke, Frank
Serpico approached Burnham
with the idea of writing a book.
Burnham was busy writing fol
low-up stories for The New
York Times, however, and
didn't have time. "I don't think I
could have written that book
anyway," says Burnham. "I
was.too close to it, to the peo
ple." So Serpico went to a pub
lisher by himself and the book

and the movie Serpieo resulted.
David Burnham stayed with
The Nete York Times until last
year when he quit to work full
time on his book. How does his
latest literary effort reflect his
philosophy of discovering hin
drances to organizations' stated
goals? Burnham thinks a mo
ment.
"It doesn't really," he re
sponds. "I'm changing some
what. I'm looking at impacts not
considered by the public sector
or by private companies. They
are impacts which interfere
with the great goals of our socie
ty. They represent in some ways
a possible threat to. you know,
to free speech and free associa
tion and free political debate."
Burnham says this softly and
seriously. He values his right to
speak and write his opinions. Is
that why he became a journal
ist?
"I like the power. The power
to affect history." He pauses,
then he amends his statement.
"I don't have power. The New

greater number of students read
CPPC brochures and written
materials rather than partici
pate in workshops.
The "How to . . . Your Re
sume, Cover Letter and In
terview" booklets remain high
ly in demand. "We had 1500 cov
er letter sheets, and they were
gone in two weeks," said Dun
can. If the company or group
doesn't recruite through the
CPPC, the students should send
their cover letter and resume
directly to the prospective em-

York Times has power."
Burnham believes news
papers should use their in
fluence in a responsible
manner. For instance, he thinks
most newspapers cover govern
ment poorly, by not offering ex
tensive, critical analysis of gov
erment actions "Be skeptical
of everything," he advises.
Newspapers tend to be un
critical for many reasons. Re
porters may be too lazy to
analyze their material ade
quately. Furthermore, editors
and owners of newspapers often
identify with the institutions
they report on and tend to have a
simplistic faith in official
statements. This is not always
true, Burnham emphasizes.
Burnham thinks The New
York Times and The Wall
Street ■Journal report pretty
well on government. Marvin
Landauer of The Wall Street
■Journal, Morton Mintz of The
Washington Post and Seymour
Hirsch do good reporting in
Burnham's opinion.
That brings to mind some of
the ethical questions Burnham
covers in his journalism class:
What should the relationship be
tween reporters and their supe
riors be? Who finally decides
what goes into print?
An even tougher question is,
"What is the relationship of a
reporter to the truth?" Are re
porters merely stenographers
or can they comment on the
news? The line between being
an "advocacy reporter," who
promulgates certain points of
view, and being a reporter who
does more than merely repeat
official statements is a fine line
to walk.
On principle, Burnham dis
likes advocacy reporting. Con
sistent with that was his policy
of only examining organizations
along criteria based on their
stated goals. Paraphrasing
Stokely Carmichael, Burnham
says,"the stated goals of most
government agencies are plenty
radical for me."
But he's writing a book on
computers — from the outside.
"I'm looking at impacts not con
sidered by either the public sec
tor or by private companies, "he
says. Perhaps this is another
turning point for Burnham. He
agrees that he's changing. Any
thinking person must. David
Burnham is definitely a thinking
man. Is he an ethical person as
well? "I can't answer that," he
responds. Are ethics important
to him? "Yes," the answer
comes quickly. Write on! ,

In the final analysis, the
CPPC offers a wide variety of
career exploration programs,
seminars, workshops, and other
employment aids. Duncan
stressed the importance of stu
dents taking their own initiative
and using the CPPC as soon as
possible. "The CPPC is not here
to make a direct match between
employee and employer; we
give students the tools they need
to find jobs," she added.


The University's Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC)
provides students with complete services including seminars,
workshops and other employment aids. However, some seniors feel

the interviews aren't worth a short wait, much less a night spent
outside the building.
