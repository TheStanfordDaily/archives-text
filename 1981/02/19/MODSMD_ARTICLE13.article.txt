## Gun control: too long to wait 
### 
It is superfluous to cite cases of deaths
caused by the misuse of handguns. The
murders of John Lennon, Dr. Herman
Tarnower and, most recently, the attacks
on bus drivers in San Francisco are only a
few examples of the continuing seri
ousness of the question.
It takes too long to debate the cliche
phrases used by opponents and proponents
of gun control; while guns don't kill peo
ple, people kill people; and people without
guns can't shoot anyone.
It is futile to interpret non-statistics like
the number of people who are deterred
from committing crimes because they
fear fellow citizens may be armed. Or how
how many gun owners have the training
and presence of mind to use their weapons
properly in an emergency.
But it is all too easy to pull a gun's trig
ger and end a human life. That's the most
critical time of all and a time that law en
forcement officials must be prepared to
deal with correctly. If we cannot remove
the guns from unprepared hands, we must
at least raise the standard required for ob
taining them.
The Daily supports the efforts of hand
gun control proponents to reform the Fed
eral Gun Control Act of 1968. The proposed
amendment would bar the importing of

parts for 'Saturday Night Specials" and
require gun dealers to check with local po
lice on the eligibility of potential cus
tomers before selling them a handgun — a
practice which would especially aid in the
prevention of gun sales to convicted fel
ons.
Well-publicized cases like the shooting
of John Lennon. periodically bring the is
sue to the top of the public agenda. It is
less widely recognized that firearms are
only second to automobiles as a cause of
fatal injuries, according to a Surgeon Gen
eral's report. Of those fatalities, more
than half occurred as a result of an acci
dent or argument.
A president's wife who has a "tiny little
gun by her bedside and a president who
gives rifles as presents while visiting
dignitaries do not inspire popular support
for comprehensive gun control. But a cur
rent push for tighter licensing laws and
possibly requiring consumers to demon
strate proficiency and eligibility before
purchasing guns may help reduce some
deaths.
Better to take the time before the crime
or accident than to lament another vic
tim's death by marveling that it "hap
pened so fast."
