## Right to protest is worth defending 
### 
Compulsory registration and
classification of youth are the
first steps toward fascist gov
ernment. By requiring regis
tration, the government was
saying. "You belong to us You
are government property." The
action was a sign of growing
American militarism through
out the world.
In the last weeks of his presi
dency, Jimmy Carter turned
world unrest into a political
tool. Many today question his
motives in playing up a confron
tation scenario.
When they decide they don't
have enough soldiers, whenever
they want to use violence and
murder to handle foreign rela
tions. the computer will go
clicking through the Selective
Service System's list of names.
And if you are registered, your
name will be on that list.
Are you crouching under your
bed in fear of a CIA agent rap
ping on your door to haul you off
and teach you how to oppress
Third World Nations? Are you
sure that the telescreen behind
the Mona Lisa print is really out
of order?
Reading through a mound of
Stanford Against Conscription
literature passed out during reg
istration week made me burn an
American flag and draw a neo-
Nazi mustache on my Reagan
Country poster. Unfortunately,
my roommate convinced me
that napalming the Hoover In
stitution would be excessive.
Seriously though, let's think
about the issue of registration
and service. If the Stanford
Against Conscription (SAC)
view of Ronald Ray-gun op
pressing the poor and the world
with growing militarism,
"enslaving the youth of Ameri
ca with the Selective Service"
and indiscriminately waiting to
click through the selective ser

vice list were true, what would
the Status Quo resemble?
Every morning, we'd rise
from the Stanford barracks to
sing hail to our Leader and hang
a few Third World nations in ef
figy. We'd say grace to the
Almighty Bomb, and then dig
into K-rations a la Food Service
while listening to their com
puter click out names to be sent
to the front and obliterated. Af
ter all. registering would make
us all government property, po
litical tools, and the means of
imperialistic militarism
throughout the world.
What could cause such an un
realistic. illogical view of the
present? Ignorance? Rose col
ored glasses? Magic
mushrooms 0
Certainly, conflict is never
desirable, but it is a reality.
Maintaining a large standing
army is costly and morally un
pleasant. but the volatile politi
cal nature of the world today al
lows us no alternative.
Preventing conflict is a noble
goal and the use of reason
founded deterrents, in order to
make the aggression of war to
painful for the aggressor to con
sider. is the logical solution.
The existence of our nuclear
arsenal is a reminder of the hor
rifying thought of nuclear con
flict. Nations that have the
capability are more likely to re
sort to their nuclear arsenal if
their strategic forces are weak
or ineffective.
Is it unreasonable to conclude
that conflict will inevitably oc
cur unless we take action to de
ter it? Is it illogical to consider
that conventional preparedness
will aid in establishing world
peace, rather than "promulgate
actions of American ag
gression?"
SAC members will claim that
"there is nothing to defend, so

why have deterrents at all?"
Unfortunately. SAC has not con
sidered that its existence, right
to organize, and right to protest
are by virtue of the freedoms
and liberties guaranteed by the
United States Constitution. By
claiming there there is nothing
to defend, they are claiming
that the right to their existence
as a group is meaningless and
not worth defending.
There is something to defend.
Peace is preferable to war. De
terrence and diplomacy are the
answer for peace.
People are the first con
sideration. If we as a country
desire peace and seek to uphold
our present civil liberties and
freedoms, is it not reasonable to
willingly serve in a civil or mili
tary position for a short length
of time to fulfill a duty? If we
wish to defend something we
often take for granted, the Con
stitution. is asking for service so
absurd?
Representative Pete Mc-
Closkey proposed legislation
elaborating on this concept in
1979. Possibilities open to 18
year olds would include Peace
Corps work, active service,
training, reserve work, forestry
work, and other government
services.
If peace and ideology are ob
jectives worth working for. the
concept of nationwide service
for a short period of time (for
example, the summer before
college) is not an unreasonable
one. Spitting on the "status quo
militarism" may be invigorat
ing now. but when the time
comes for action, the right to
spit may disappear in a cloud of
dust.
