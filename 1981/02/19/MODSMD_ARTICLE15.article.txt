That's Chun to you
While I agree with the general
thrust of the Daily's recent edi
torial on South Korea, there
were three mistakes in the edi
torial that I would like to point
out.
the family name of
President Chun Doo Hwan is
Chun, and he is properly re
ferred to by this name, rather
than by Hwan.
Second, martial law was not
declared last year; it was im
posed in 1979. immediately after
the death of President Park
Chung Hee What Chun did was
to.extend martial law to the en
tire country during the severe
military crackdown last May.
Third, the Daily's editorial
implies that former opposition
leader Kim Dae Jung was kid
napped from Japan just prior to
his arrest last May. Kim was ac
tually kidnapped in 1973; he was
subsequently tried and im
prisoned for 33 months, until
shortly before Park's death.
Before Chun acted last May to
put an end to the short-lived
movement toward democracy
in South Korea. Kim had been
fcee and had even resumed lim
ited political activities

The ill-advised, ill-timed let
ter of January 27, 1981 from
Stanford President Donald Ken
nedy to the members of the Uni
versity faculty and staff took
the form of yet another subjuga
tion and put-down of clerical
wprkers in particular, and wom
en in general We think Kennedy
efred in his denunciation of the
union threat when he did
We wonder if Kennedy and his
a&isers have given any thought

to cutting expenses at the top
and passing the savings along to
the clerical staff. United States
President Ronald Reagan re
cently cut Government spend
ing by imposing a 5 percent cut
in travel budgets for Govern
ment employees and bureau
crats. Perhaps Stanford Univer
sity could follow his lead. A cut
of 5 percent in the enormous
travel expenses throughout the
University would undoubtedly
lend to appreciable savings.
It is doubtful that the basic
needs of the clerical staff will be
met by voting in a union. The
union will not alleviate the most
pressing problems of under
staffing and excessive paper
work. And we wonder what the
cost of the union will be to us fi
nancially. If the union should be
instrumental in obtaining a 2
percent to 3 percent per annum
increase for us, and proceeds to
charge 1 percent to 2 percent of
our salaries as union dues, I
doubt we would have ac
complished a great deal in the
long run. And we do not relish
contributing a percentage of our
income to line the pockets of yet
another chauvinistic group of
enormously wealthy and pow
erful union executives and lob
byists.

Today, in the midst of the yel
low ribbons and the welcoming
home of the 53 American
hostages from Iran, it is ap
propriate to recall a much larg
er group of Americans who
were held hostage by a govern
ment without ever being
charged with crime. These
hostages were the Japanese-
Americans living the western
states during World War 11.
Numbering about 120.000, they

were held captive for more than
a thousand days.
Today is the 39th anniversary
of President Roosevelt's Ex
ecutive Order 9066 which gave
rise to the so-called relocation
centers, situated as near by to
Stanford as the Tanforan area.
Over the past four decades,
there have been those who
sought to rationalize the estab
lishment of the Japanese-Amer
ican internment camps as "a
wartime necessity." Never
theless, such a policy was not
followed by the British against
Germans in that country nor by
the federal government against
other Americans whose parents
were from countries we were
in Europe.
The internment of Japanese-
Americans was justified solely
on the same racist fears which
brought Dennis Kearney to
power on "The Chinese Must
Go" platform of the 1870 s, the
Alien Land Laws in the early
1900 s, and the exploitation of
Mexican. Filipino and Chinese
laborers in the fields and on the
railroads.
It is easy to look back for a
day at what occurred in 1942.
However, the impact of the
shattered months, lost time, as
well as lost property and belong
ings is still felt in the day-to-day
lives of many. Congress, recog
nizing that the internment poli
cies and conditions have never
been fully uncovered, recently
impaneled a nine-member in
vestigatory commission which
may recommend compensation
for the internees
While the Commission will
not repair damaged lives, it will
be able to restore financial
losses and, more importantly,
provide sufficient public atten
tion to eliminate the potential
for future Tanforans and Man
zanars.

Kennedy letter
The ill-advised, ill-timed let
ter of January 27, 1981 from
Stanford President Donald Ken
nedy to the members of the Uni
versity faculty and staff took
the form of yet another subjuga
tion and put-down of clerical
wprkers in particular, and wom
en in general We think Kennedy
efred in his denunciation of the
union threat when he did
We wonder if Kennedy and his
a&isers have given any thought

to cutting expenses at the top
and passing the savings along to
the clerical staff. United States
President Ronald Reagan re
cently cut Government spend
ing by imposing a 5 percent cut
in travel budgets for Govern
ment employees and bureau
crats. Perhaps Stanford Univer
sity could follow his lead. A cut
of 5 percent in the enormous
travel expenses throughout the
University would undoubtedly
lend to appreciable savings.
It is doubtful that the basic
needs of the clerical staff will be
met by voting in a union. The
union will not alleviate the most
pressing problems of under
staffing and excessive paper
work. And we wonder what the
cost of the union will be to us fi
nancially. If the union should be
instrumental in obtaining a 2
percent to 3 percent per annum
increase for us, and proceeds to
charge 1 percent to 2 percent of
our salaries as union dues, I
doubt we would have ac
complished a great deal in the
long run. And we do not relish
contributing a percentage of our
income to line the pockets of yet
another chauvinistic group of
enormously wealthy and pow
erful union executives and lob
byists.

Today, in the midst of the yel
low ribbons and the welcoming
home of the 53 American
hostages from Iran, it is ap
propriate to recall a much larg
er group of Americans who
were held hostage by a govern
ment without ever being
charged with crime. These
hostages were the Japanese-
Americans living the western
states during World War 11.
Numbering about 120.000, they

were held captive for more than
a thousand days.
Today is the 39th anniversary
of President Roosevelt's Ex
ecutive Order 9066 which gave
rise to the so-called relocation
centers, situated as near by to
Stanford as the Tanforan area.
Over the past four decades,
there have been those who
sought to rationalize the estab
lishment of the Japanese-Amer
ican internment camps as "a
wartime necessity." Never
theless, such a policy was not
followed by the British against
Germans in that country nor by
the federal government against
other Americans whose parents
were from countries we were
in Europe.
The internment of Japanese-
Americans was justified solely
on the same racist fears which
brought Dennis Kearney to
power on "The Chinese Must
Go" platform of the 1870 s, the
Alien Land Laws in the early
1900 s, and the exploitation of
Mexican. Filipino and Chinese
laborers in the fields and on the
railroads.
It is easy to look back for a
day at what occurred in 1942.
However, the impact of the
shattered months, lost time, as
well as lost property and belong
ings is still felt in the day-to-day
lives of many. Congress, recog
nizing that the internment poli
cies and conditions have never
been fully uncovered, recently
impaneled a nine-member in
vestigatory commission which
may recommend compensation
for the internees
While the Commission will
not repair damaged lives, it will
be able to restore financial
losses and, more importantly,
provide sufficient public atten
tion to eliminate the potential
for future Tanforans and Man
zanars.

That's Chun to you
While I agree with the general
thrust of the Daily's recent edi
torial on South Korea, there
were three mistakes in the edi
torial that I would like to point
out.
the family name of
President Chun Doo Hwan is
Chun, and he is properly re
ferred to by this name, rather
than by Hwan.
Second, martial law was not
declared last year; it was im
posed in 1979. immediately after
the death of President Park
Chung Hee What Chun did was
to.extend martial law to the en
tire country during the severe
military crackdown last May.
Third, the Daily's editorial
implies that former opposition
leader Kim Dae Jung was kid
napped from Japan just prior to
his arrest last May. Kim was ac
tually kidnapped in 1973; he was
subsequently tried and im
prisoned for 33 months, until
shortly before Park's death.
Before Chun acted last May to
put an end to the short-lived
movement toward democracy
in South Korea. Kim had been
fcee and had even resumed lim
ited political activities
