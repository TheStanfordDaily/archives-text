# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Paul Reidinger Weekends weren't made for Wittgenstein 
### 
Dreamland reopened a couple
of weekends ago, so naturally a
bunch of us went. It was an ex
pensive way to kill a Saturday
night: $10 to get in, plus (I'm
told) another $5 or so for the
drugs and then whatever for
drinks. Inside, the music was
loud, funny-colored lights were
flashing, and the dance floor
was choked with people speed
ing wildly. It may not sound too
appealing in my flatfooted
prose, but there was, as they
say. a highly-charged at
mosphere. When "La Bamba"
segued into "Relight My Fire"
at 4 AM, we all threw up our
arms and screamed It was
glorious.
Or so I thought at the time.
Now, after reading R. B.
Lynch's article (Daily, Feb. 12),
I feel enormously guilty. I am

one of those people who never
says anything important at the
dinner table. I complain about
B's. And I squander vast quan
tities of free time being silly
(not once at Dreamland did I
even mention Wittgenstein's
name). The reproving spirit of
R. B Lynch haunts me every
moment, reminding me of my
countless abdications of in
tellectual responsibility.
Fortunately, history majors
learn, if nothing else, how to
argue Often fallaciously, it is
true, and even more often, over
points of arcana. Let me none
theless dispute Lynch's idea of
what a university (particularly
a California university) should
be.
It seems to me that his
castigation of Stanford students
as anti-intellectual results from
a monumental humorlessness.
It sounds like a university isn't
really a university unless ev
eryone is a hyperconscious
philosopher and dinner con
versations are spent com
miserating over cosmic noth
ingness. To be serious-minded,
runs the implication, one must
be just plain serious; to ap
preciate the weightier things in

life, one must wallow in
lugubriousness.
Now. I've doubtless exag
gerated and oversimplified
Lynch's complaint. That's part
of the fun of arguing: it's what
we learn from history. Despite
my distortions, however,
Lynch's vision of what a univer
sity should be is profoundly
wrong. Not disastrously wrong,
as is Lisa Bernard's (Daily,
Feb. 11), but wrong enough in its
assumptions to invalidate his
criticisms.
The world is an awful place,
full of barbarous and stupid peo
ple. People have to work, they
have to ride buses, they have to
talk to their mothers-in-law,
and so forth. Our lives have no
purpose, they're full of angst,
and they end too quickly. Given
these mortifying parameters,
the 'task to which universities
should set themselves is a light
ening of the load we all carry,
not a further weighting down.
We all need to play if we want to
avoid going off the deep end psy
chologically. and to learn to
play wellâ€”to use leisure time
happily-should be a result of ev
ery college education.
This does not mean that

classes in Frisbee throwing
should be required of every
freshman. Recreative activity
might mean anything from
reading Kant's Critique of l\irc
Reason to printing dirty pic
tures at LOTS. Or anything but
The point is that seriousness is
neither necessarily better nor
more seemly than playfulness,
and that lightness of heart is not
the same as mindlessness and
anti-intellectualism.
I am more sympathetic to
Lynch's complaints than per
haps I have sounded. Of course
he's right that there are grave
issues in the world that deserve
a measure of attention But I do
think that one can appreciate
such issues without becoming
chattels to them. The great boon
of a Stanford education is that it
offers both a shield against
creeping existential rumi
nations and an antidote to the
enervating sobriety the dread
real world will soon foist upon
us.
I lied. I never felt guilty about
Dreamland at all.
