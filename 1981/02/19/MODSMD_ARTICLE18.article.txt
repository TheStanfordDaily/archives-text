## Conflicts in conscience and duty to fight 
### 
The point of Paul Baer's col
umn. "Registration apathy
prevalent at Stanford" (Daily,
Feb. 10), is well-taken. Ideal
istically. you do not ever wish to
fight for the privileges you en
joy as an American citizen - jus
tified or not. You might die as an
outcome of war. What person
ever really wants to die? Clear
ly, none of us do even if it occurs
at an advanced age That is one
conflict with which we must
deal sooner or later.
However, Baer's argument
leaves unmentioned some other
very basic conflicts which have
unknowingly but successfully
been woven into his reasoning
and which most young adults
face. American society en
courages citizens to continue
their education, to stay out of
the professional work force, and
to enjoy a prolonged
adolescence. It also encourages
them to act responsibly, to pay
bills, and to speak with "adult
know-how."
At the same time that the
message says to be frivolous
and youthful, it also says to be
come immediately and totally
adult-like by accepting a very
adult-oriented responsibility of
fighting for your "God given,
constitutionally guaranteed"
rights and possibly dying. It is
another example of a conflict
that one may be asked to deal
with sooner than later.
Towards the end of his argu
ment Baer advocates an accep
tance of the draft and any conse
quent war in the case of a "clear

and present danger." He has
shifted his opinion more than
slightly to consider the possi
bility of imminent starvation as
a justifiable cause for war. He
excuses himself for not being re
ligious, and he states that he has
"no respect at all for someone
who would kill to maintain his
standard of living." But in the
event that he may die due to
starvation maybe then he would
wish that he had dealt with the
situation before.
Hypothetically, what does
Baer see as the difference be
tween people starving in this
country due to inflation, lack of
jobs; people in the Midwest and
Northeast freezing to death in
the winter due to lack of heating
fuel, another OPEC oil em
bargo; or citizens of western
Europe fending off that often
mentioned and generally ridi
culed notion of communist ag
gression.
There is no real difference.
But, society gives us the illusion
of a difference by offering sepa
rate priorities for each of these
situations. It is not until the last
situation is considered that we
as individuals become actively
involved. It is not until we en
counter the last situation that
we become actively concerned
about political prowess and po
litical responsibility as may be
viewed by a select few.
Society has condoned the be
lief that as long as there is no
"clear and present danger" for
me. I do not have to react. But
there is no real lack of urgency

about any of the three
hypothetical situations. None is
less urgent than either of the
other two in terms of conscious
responsibility. There is a dif
ference in priority based on po
litical responsibility. This is an
example of another conflict not
just for the young to consider.
The word "society" is defined
as the system in community life
in which individuals form a con
tinuous and regulatory associa
tion for their mutual benefit and
protection. The definition does

not include the paradoxical con
flicts which society uses to its
detriment to shade the import of
our collective responsibilities.
We have many responsibilities
within our society. The respon
sibility of war should not fall
squarely on the shoulders of
men along. Baer is correct in
claiming "... when they come
to draft you/me, 'I'm doing my
homework' just won't cut it."

rights and possibly dying. It is
another example of a conflict
that one may be asked to deal
with sooner than later.
Towards the end of his argu
ment Baer advocates an accep
tance of the draft and any conse
quent war in the case of a "clear

and present danger." He has
shifted his opinion more than
slightly to consider the possi
bility of imminent starvation as
a justifiable cause for war. He
excuses himself for not being re
ligious, and he states that he has
"no respect at all for someone
who would kill to maintain his
standard of living." But in the
event that he may die due to
starvation maybe then he would
wish that he had dealt with the
situation before.
Hypothetically, what does
Baer see as the difference be
tween people starving in this
country due to inflation, lack of
jobs; people in the Midwest and
Northeast freezing to death in
the winter due to lack of heating
fuel, another OPEC oil em
bargo; or citizens of western
Europe fending off that often
mentioned and generally ridi
culed notion of communist ag
gression.
There is no real difference.
But, society gives us the illusion
of a difference by offering sepa
rate priorities for each of these
situations. It is not until the last
situation is considered that we
as individuals become actively
involved. It is not until we en
counter the last situation that
we become actively concerned
about political prowess and po
litical responsibility as may be
viewed by a select few.
Society has condoned the be
lief that as long as there is no
"clear and present danger" for
me. I do not have to react. But
there is no real lack of urgency

about any of the three
hypothetical situations. None is
less urgent than either of the
other two in terms of conscious
responsibility. There is a dif
ference in priority based on po
litical responsibility. This is an
example of another conflict not
just for the young to consider.
The word "society" is defined
as the system in community life
in which individuals form a con
tinuous and regulatory associa
tion for their mutual benefit and
protection. The definition does

not include the paradoxical con
flicts which society uses to its
detriment to shade the import of
our collective responsibilities.
We have many responsibilities
within our society. The respon
sibility of war should not fall
squarely on the shoulders of
men along. Baer is correct in
claiming "... when they come
to draft you/me, 'I'm doing my
homework' just won't cut it."
