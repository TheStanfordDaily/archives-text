# Tresidder remodeling plan announced
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
Hungry students, night owls and
procrastinators may find the Transi
tion in Tresidder Union a more en
joyable gathering place after a
planned $220,000 renovation project is
finished.
The Tresidder Advisory group an
nounced plans to renovate the
cafeteria during a regular meeting of
the Union Board yesterday.
Junior Sam Howe, chair of the
Union 'Board, summarized the
purpose behind the remodeling effort
saying, "The Transition has been
crying for renovation. The at
mosphere there now is really disap
pointing. It is not inviting; the
cafeteria looks more like an airport
lounge than a student meeting place."
The Union Board is a committee of
students, faculty and staff that was
formed to investigate and initiate im
provements in Tresidder. The ad
visory group is a six-member com
mission charged with coordinating
renovation plans.
Campus center
Howe said he believes the new
carpeting, lighting, furniture and
SRace allocation effort slated to begin
next month "gives the Transition the
potential to become a vital campus
center."
Renovation plans, formulated dur
ing the last nine months in conjunction
with the University's planning and
provost's offices, include "earth tone
colored carpeting and walls, new
booths, counters, tables and stools, a
new lighting system and perhaps new
service procedures," said Ellen Op
penheim, union director and advisory
group member.
"We have increased the present
seating from 297 to 350. There will be
improved lighting when remodeling is
complete. This is an important
change. The lighting in the Transition
now is dim to the point of gloomi
ness," she said.
"We want to create a warm, pleas
ant atmosphere where students can

chat, have a soda, and do light study
ing, so we have chosen earth tones for
the walls and carpeting," said Op
penheim, who noted that the advisory
group will be placing orders for new
furniture and lighting in two weeks.
The remodeling effort is funded by
Tresidder Union reserves, money set
aside to replenish buildings and equip
ment, according to Oppenheim. "We
have been saving reserves for such an
effort for three or four years. We have
the energy, time, commitment and re
sources to undertake this remodeling.
Colors
Wall painting, in off-white and beige
colors, should begin by March, accord
ing to senior Mark Breier, advisory
group member. "We thought about
having a red decor to go with the Stan
ford image, but we decided stop lights
are red for a reason. Red was too
hostile a color, and we had seen
durable, attractive carpet in shades of
black-grey and burgundy at the Uni
versity of Santa Clara. We decided to
recommend walls, furniture, and
flooring in the lighter, calmer colors."
Stackable wooden chairs and two
sizes of wooden stools in light colors
will replace the present formica
furniture covering the Transition's
tiled floor. Booth seating will be re
modeled to include modular two-seat
booths and booths with inside wall ac
cess along the cafeteria's south wall.
Booth walls will be lower than eye
level "preventing the hungry student
from walking in front of each table to
see if it's occupied," said Greg
Larson, assistant director of Tres
idder.
"We expect the increased number
of two- and four-person booths to be
very popular, especially for solo stu
dying," added Larson.
Portable furniture
All furniture, including newly in
stalled wooden planter di"iders be
tween the immediate area surround
ing the Alternative, a small serving
line along the Transition's north wall
and the remaining cafeteria floor

space, will be portable.
"In making the furniture modular
and movable, we have tried to achieve
as much flexibility as possible. Be
cause we want the cafeteria to be a
multipurpose area, we have allowed
the possibility of clearing the hall in
the remodeling," said Pat Stein, head
consultant for Food Facilities Plan
ning Service, the Portola Valley-based
firm which planned the renovation ef
fort.
"In the early stages of planning stu
dent recreational areas, students usu
ally look for something flamboyant.
But this desire wears off and they
come to seek a more conservative ap
proach which will maximize flexibili
ty," said Stein, who added he is
pleased with the renovation effort.
"We want a flexible area where stu
dents can hold a dance or concert if
they want," said Breier. Although ren

ovation plans do not call for piped mu
sic, Breier said long range goals for
the cafeteria include additional recre
ational services.
Service window
"Under the remodeling process, we
will be closing off the Transition en
trance on the Old Union side. There
will also be a service window on the
eastern wall of the Transition so that
students watching an outdoor Friday
concert won't have to come inside to
be served," said Oppenheim
Neither food prices nor Transition
menus, made up and served by
Servomation (an independent food
service firm which rents Transition
space from Tresidder Union), will
change significantly as a result of re
modeling. But Larson said serving
renovation, including the sale of draft
beer and novel food items, is a possible
long-range goal.
The Transition will remain open
during the five-month renovation
process. "We are shooting to have
most of the work done by Commence
ment. There will be very few
closedowns since most of the work will
be done at night and on weekends."
said Oppenheim. She added that cus
tomers will be warned of Transition
closings.
"My image of the Transition is
walking in and feeling like I am in the
1950s with flashing neon tiles. This im
pression tells me the time to do this is
now," said Oppenheim
The Union Board endorsed the ad
visory group's renovation plan
without dissent. Board member
James Lyons, dean of student affairs,
said, "I couldn't think of a more
perfect way to begin renovation than
the advisory group's presentation.
Hell, let's get on with it."

chat, have a soda, and do light study
ing, so we have chosen earth tones for
the walls and carpeting," said Op
penheim, who noted that the advisory
group will be placing orders for new
furniture and lighting in two weeks.
The remodeling effort is funded by
Tresidder Union reserves, money set
aside to replenish buildings and equip
ment, according to Oppenheim. "We
have been saving reserves for such an
effort for three or four years. We have
the energy, time, commitment and re
sources to undertake this remodeling.
Colors
Wall painting, in off-white and beige
colors, should begin by March, accord
ing to senior Mark Breier, advisory
group member. "We thought about
having a red decor to go with the Stan
ford image, but we decided stop lights
are red for a reason. Red was too
hostile a color, and we had seen
durable, attractive carpet in shades of
black-grey and burgundy at the Uni
versity of Santa Clara. We decided to
recommend walls, furniture, and
flooring in the lighter, calmer colors."
Stackable wooden chairs and two
sizes of wooden stools in light colors
will replace the present formica
furniture covering the Transition's
tiled floor. Booth seating will be re
modeled to include modular two-seat
booths and booths with inside wall ac
cess along the cafeteria's south wall.
Booth walls will be lower than eye
level "preventing the hungry student
from walking in front of each table to
see if it's occupied," said Greg
Larson, assistant director of Tres
idder.
"We expect the increased number
of two- and four-person booths to be
very popular, especially for solo stu
dying," added Larson.
Portable furniture
All furniture, including newly in
stalled wooden planter di"iders be
tween the immediate area surround
ing the Alternative, a small serving
line along the Transition's north wall
and the remaining cafeteria floor

space, will be portable.
"In making the furniture modular
and movable, we have tried to achieve
as much flexibility as possible. Be
cause we want the cafeteria to be a
multipurpose area, we have allowed
the possibility of clearing the hall in
the remodeling," said Pat Stein, head
consultant for Food Facilities Plan
ning Service, the Portola Valley-based
firm which planned the renovation ef
fort.
"In the early stages of planning stu
dent recreational areas, students usu
ally look for something flamboyant.
But this desire wears off and they
come to seek a more conservative ap
proach which will maximize flexibili
ty," said Stein, who added he is
pleased with the renovation effort.
"We want a flexible area where stu
dents can hold a dance or concert if
they want," said Breier. Although ren

ovation plans do not call for piped mu
sic, Breier said long range goals for
the cafeteria include additional recre
ational services.
Service window
"Under the remodeling process, we
will be closing off the Transition en
trance on the Old Union side. There
will also be a service window on the
eastern wall of the Transition so that
students watching an outdoor Friday
concert won't have to come inside to
be served," said Oppenheim
Neither food prices nor Transition
menus, made up and served by
Servomation (an independent food
service firm which rents Transition
space from Tresidder Union), will
change significantly as a result of re
modeling. But Larson said serving
renovation, including the sale of draft
beer and novel food items, is a possible
long-range goal.
The Transition will remain open
during the five-month renovation
process. "We are shooting to have
most of the work done by Commence
ment. There will be very few
closedowns since most of the work will
be done at night and on weekends."
said Oppenheim. She added that cus
tomers will be warned of Transition
closings.
"My image of the Transition is
walking in and feeling like I am in the
1950s with flashing neon tiles. This im
pression tells me the time to do this is
now," said Oppenheim
The Union Board endorsed the ad
visory group's renovation plan
without dissent. Board member
James Lyons, dean of student affairs,
said, "I couldn't think of a more
perfect way to begin renovation than
the advisory group's presentation.
Hell, let's get on with it."
Hungry students, night owls and
procrastinators may find the Transi
tion in Tresidder Union a more en
joyable gathering place after a
planned $220,000 renovation project is
finished.
The Tresidder Advisory group an
nounced plans to renovate the
cafeteria during a regular meeting of
the Union Board yesterday.
Junior Sam Howe, chair of the
Union 'Board, summarized the
purpose behind the remodeling effort
saying, "The Transition has been
crying for renovation. The at
mosphere there now is really disap
pointing. It is not inviting; the
cafeteria looks more like an airport
lounge than a student meeting place."
The Union Board is a committee of
students, faculty and staff that was
formed to investigate and initiate im
provements in Tresidder. The ad
visory group is a six-member com
mission charged with coordinating
renovation plans.
Campus center
Howe said he believes the new
carpeting, lighting, furniture and
SRace allocation effort slated to begin
next month "gives the Transition the
potential to become a vital campus
center."
Renovation plans, formulated dur
ing the last nine months in conjunction
with the University's planning and
provost's offices, include "earth tone
colored carpeting and walls, new
booths, counters, tables and stools, a
new lighting system and perhaps new
service procedures," said Ellen Op
penheim, union director and advisory
group member.
"We have increased the present
seating from 297 to 350. There will be
improved lighting when remodeling is
complete. This is an important
change. The lighting in the Transition
now is dim to the point of gloomi
ness," she said.
"We want to create a warm, pleas
ant atmosphere where students can

chat, have a soda, and do light study
