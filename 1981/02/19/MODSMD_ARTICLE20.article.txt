# Visiting economics prof analyzes currency problems of W. Europe

### Patty Kammerer 
The unstable U.S. dollar and
the oil crisis are the primary
causes of the present currency
problems in Western Europe,
according to visiting economics
professor Peter Bernholz from
Basel, Switzerland. "Monetary
and Currency Developments:
Problems and Policy in Eu
rope" was the topic of
Bernholz's speech at Bechtel I-
Center last Thursday, part of
the winter speakers series pre
sented by AIESEC (Interna
tional Association of Economics
and Management Students).
Bernholz said that the basic
monetary problems in Europe
involve maintaining stable ex
change rates and price levels.
He maintained "these problems
would not exist if the interna
tional monetary system was
functioning properly."
The Bretton Woods system,
Bernholz explained, was de
vised in 1944 and is based on the
stability of the U.S. dollar. Dur
ing the '50s the dollar was recog
nized as the international "re
serve currency" which the U.S.
government was obliged to con
vert into gold upon request.
The sixties, however, pro
duced a growing distrust in the
stability of the system, evident
by increased "hedging and
speculation." Bernholz said
that the United States should
have pursued more restrictive
policies at this time.
The Kennedy and Johnson ad

ministrations engaged instead
in expansionary policies. Ac
cording to Bernholz, the prob
lem of domestic unemployment
held a higher priority for them
than inflation. Thus the U.S. def
icit continued to grow and our
gold stock reserves were steadi
ly depleted. The dollar was "ov
ervalued," making overseas in
vestment an attractive option
for American investors.
In 1971, President Nixon
enacted the Smithsonian Agree
ment which stated that the U.S.
dollar was no longer backed by
gold. This was a direct result of
the depleted gold stocks which
would eventually be unable to
meet the demand. Nixon
claimed that his was the most
important monetary aggrement
in history. Bernholz said that
Nixon clearly did not under
stand the implications of this
agreement.
In 1973, the system collapsed
Bernholz said, exchange rates
were allowed to "float", there
fore providing no control over
inflation and people moved their
money to Switzerland Many un
expected problems arose due to
the floating exchange rates.
The European Currency Sys
tem, established in 1978 by the
Common Market countries had
two major goals: internally
stable exchange rates and price
levels, and reduced inflation.
Bernholz said that the success
of this system, similar to the
Bretton Woods, will depend on

the strict enforcement of their
policies.
Bernholtz believes major
problems have also arisen due
to the oil crises of 1973 and 1979.
The second oil crisis created
more pronounced problems, es
pecially for the underdeveloped
nations. Huge oil deficits have
trouble both the industrialized
and the undeveloped world, he
said.
After the first crisis, Arab in
vestment in secure liquid assets
of the industrialized nations

provided some "self-healing
forces". Europe and the United
States then "recycled" some of
this money to the under
developed countries to help
them pay off their deficits. Af
ter the second crisis however,
this was not the case.
Bernholz concluded that it re
mains to be seen whether the
private banking system of Eu
rope can handle fluctuating ex
change rates along with the
burden of their own oil deficits
and those of the undeveloped
world.
