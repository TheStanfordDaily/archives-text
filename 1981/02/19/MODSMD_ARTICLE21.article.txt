# White House press secretary Brady criticized
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Whenever White
House press secretary James Brady
stepped to the podium to give the dai
ly briefing for reporters last week
there was a scattering of applause
and cheering.
"You're going to write a piece
about Brady?" joked one White
House official. "You must be an in
vestigative reporter."
The applause and cheers were
sarcastic and the joke, which not ev
eryone found funny, was that Brady
had become a difficult man to track
down in the first weeks of the Reagan
administration.
It was a peculiar twist. When Brady
was named to the job he was known to
reporters who covered the Reagan
campaign and the transition as a
spokesman who made great efforts to
get answers to questions and be avail
able when needed. The only rap
against Brady was in that since he
was not a longtime Reagan loyalist he
might not have enough access to the
president to be able to know and com
municate what the president was
thinking.
Instead, Brady's access to Reagan
has been ample. What has been poor is
reporters' access to Brady.
The Brady-run press office hit the
ground running. The inaugural and
events connected with the hostages'
return home were well-handled, a

large sample of White House re
porters agreed, but then Brady, who
sometimes calls himself by his
nickname "The Bear," hit the
ground.
He sent his deputies, Larry Speakes
and Kama Small, to handle the daily
briefings and he was rarely in his of
fice to talk to reporters or return re
porters' telephone calls.
Brady was spending his time with
Reagan.
"You have to front-end-load this,"
Brady said in response to criticism of
his performance. His first priority, he
said, had to be to get to know the pres
ident better by observing him in all
sorts of situations.
Brady did seem to be resurfacing.
He gave three of the five briefings last
week, compared to only one the week
before. He was better at returning the
reporters' phone calls.
"I have found it hard to find tim£ to
be press secretary," Brady conceded.
He added that he can see the day com
ing when he'll be able to return all the
phone calls.
A large number of reporters, from
television, magazines and news
papers, have complained to Brady —
when they could find him — about his
inaccessibility. There also has been
some criticism of Brady in the White
House.
"He's totally disorganized," one
senior official said of the press secre

tary.
The disorganization may result
from the fact that Brady got a late
start. Although he was the press
spokesman for the Reagan Washing
ton transition, he was not named
White House press secretary until
Jan. 6.
As a result, he had to spend time
forming a staff and planning how to
run his office. There still are vacan
cies to be filled on his staff.
When he does give the briefing, and
despite all the criticism, he has given
two-thirds of the first 22, Brady can be
very good. His sense of humor goes
down well with most reporters, and he
can be disarming when refusing to an
swer a question.
"It's not full disclosure, folks,"
Brady said last week in trying — not
for the first time — to explain why he
would not give further details of a
Cabinet meeting.
"The principle of the mind's ability
to absorb what the seat can endure
was tested to the limit today," Brady
began his Friday description of the
long series of budget-cutting sessions
Reagan and Cabinet members had
just concluded.
In Brady's absence, Speakes and
Small have had varying degrees of
success in giving briefings and han
dling reporters' inquiries.
Speakes, who was in the White
House press office during the Ford ad

ministration, often has been sent in to
a briefing with only a few minutes' no
tice and therefore little time to pre
pare himself.
He also was sent to speak in
Brady's place to a luncheon group in
the first days of the administration,
where he delivered himself of a not
very flattering, but quite apt com
parison of reporters to ducks: "You
have to feed them a morsel every so
often, or they bite you."
A random survey of the ducks in the
press room gives Speakes pretty high
marks for his efforts when he has
been standing in for Brady or at
tempting to answer questions in his
office.
Small has been less successful, in
the eyes of the reporters.
Her first solo flight in the briefing
room Wednesday did not go smoothly.
What is the president's position on
Cabinet members' discussing their
private views in public? she was
asked.
"Well, we'd have to ask him,
wouldn't we?" she replied.
A minute later she said that the
White House had strict rules govern
ing contact between the White House
and the Justice Department on pend
ing legal cases.
"What are the rules?" a reporter
asked.
"Do you want a legal seminar up
here?" she replied.
