## Guardian Angels 
### Los Angeles Times 
New York — The flashing
lights, pulsating music and pa
rade of top politicians were a far
cry from the perilous world of
lonely streets, dimly lit subway
platforms and graffiti-covered
trains.
The scene was Magique, a
chic discotheque on Man
hattan s East Side. As cast
members from such shows as
"A Chorus Line" and "Sugar
Babies" looked on, New York
Lt. Gov. Mario Cuomo and Carol
Bellamay, president of the New
York City Council, led festiv
ities honoring the Guardian
Angels. Designers Bill Blass
and Oscar de la Renta, many of
whose clients normally spurn
subways, contributed clothes to
a fund-raising auction for the
group and pop artists provided
posters and prints.
While the evening afforded
youngsters from tenements and
people from plush cooperative
apartments a chance for enter
tainment. it also provided a val
uable clue to something more —
just how far the Guardian
Angels have come in gaining le
gitimacy in New York in just
two years.
The Guardian Angels are dis
tinctively dressed volunteers,
mostly in their teens from ghet
to neighborhoods, who patrol
the city's worst trouble spots —
subways, parks and streets.
Their red and white T-shirts and
red berets have become a com
mon sight in a city that worries
about crime.
The Angels always patrol in
groups of at least eight. They
spread through subway trains,
one to a car and are careful to
stand near the door that con
nects the cars. Each patrol
member memorizes an
elaborate set of signals to quick
ly summon help. The SOS sig
nals can range from a member
waving his beret or stopping to
comb his hair. When the Guard
ian Angels walk the streets,
there is always a car with a two
man backup within two blocks

of the main group.
On many trains the Angels, •
who receive some martial arts
training, are applauded by sub
way riders. Grateful residents
give them meals when they .
guard some streets. In two
years their membership has
grown from 13 original volun
teers who named themselves
the "Magnificent 13" to 1000, in
cluding 28 women. Z.
For many of the teen-agers,
the New York Guardian Angels
provides some of the first real
discipline and community en
couragement they have ever re
ceived
These kids are creating a pa
trol presence in places where no
one else is going. They have •
caught the imagination of the
city," a high-ranking New York
City police official said
Police Commissioner Robert
McGuire has announced his in
tention to give the group some
training and to register its
members. Under current plans
that still are being negotiated
and that still have to be formally
approved by Mayor Edward
Koch, the Guardian Angels
would receive identification
cards. They would be given leer,
tures in the legal guidelines for
making arrests without war
rants. first-aid training and. on
a selective basis, courses in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation
"Clearly, you have a large
group of kids from poorly
educated and low soci
oeconomic families who on the
face of it are committed to
doing something good in a volun
teer way," Robert Keating, the
mayor's criminal justice coor
dinator. said. V
However, Mayor Koch has
been ambivalent about the,.
Angels, first labeling them
"vigilantes" and later'
withdrawing the charge. He has
spurned requests from the
Guardian Angels for a mayoral
commendation. That has"
brought anger from Curtis
Sliwa. 23, the group's founder
