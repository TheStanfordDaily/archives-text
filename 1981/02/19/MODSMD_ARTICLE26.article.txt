## Polanski's 'Tess' less than a classic 
### Jim Mattson 
7V.s.s is based on Thomas Har
dy's Toss of the d'Urbervilles.
Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a
classic. Tess is not. What has
been lost is something more
than three words in the title.
Roman Polanski, who
directed and co-wrote Tess, has
summoned up a doppelgangerof
a movie. The characters' names
are the same, the landscape
looks familiar, the storyline
runs more or less as it does in
the book, but the soul of the
work is gone. Tess isn't by any
means a despicable or "bad"
movie. Much of it (especially in
the first half) is very good. But
one is left with the peculiar feel
ing that the movie, if let out into
the daylight, wouldn't cast a
shadow.
When a film is based on a
great novel, certain expecta
tions are created, whether the
filmmakers like them or not.
When the title and the story are
borrowed, so is the reputation.
The filmmakers (and the ad
vertisers) gain instant product
recognition. They also implicit
ly agree to take on a standard
against which the film may be
measured.
This "measurement" •is
something that doesn't happen
when a film is based on an ori
ginal story. It is something that
usually doesn't matter when a
film is based on popular fiction.
(Nobody really cared, for exam
ple, when Polanski's version of
Rosemary's Hciby differed sig
nificantly from the novel it was
taken from.)
It does matter here. One may

maintain that every movie,
even one called Tess, should be
judged on its own merits and not
on the degree to which it cap
tures the feeling of its source.
This impartial judgment isn't as
easy as it sounds, as anyone who
has read this novel, or any other
Hardy, will testify. Folanskihas
been at once too reverent (he
has included more plot than the
movie can bear) and not rever
ent enough (he is unable to
transfer any of Hardy's pas
sion).
Hardy is one of literature's
great descriptive writers. We
can see, and taste, and hear and
feel the environments he writes
about; we come to know his peo
ple. Hardy's title character is a
woman who is beautiful, in
telligent and serene. Polanski's
title character is merely beau
tiful.
Tess's centerpiece is
Nastassia Kinski, the 19-year
old daughter of German film
star Klaus Kinski She is lovely.
With her pouty lips and deep-set
eyes, she looks incredibly like
Ingrid Bergman. Looking at
her. one can almost believe that
she could, without in the least
intending to, drive men to do
terrible deeds.
But then Kinski opens her
mouth, and the spell is broken.
She is not a bad actress (though
she's not a terribly good one,
either), but she possesses the
one thing which a convincing
Tess must not have: she has an
accent. It is difficult to concen
trate on the plight of this poor
English girl when it sounds as if
she spent summers on the banks
of the Rhine. When the un-

familiar syllables come tumbl
ing from her lips, we see an ac
tress', not a character's, strug
gle.
It's not clear whether Kinski
would have been able to pull off
this admittedly difficult role in
any language. She is fine in the
quiet scenes, where she is able
to project a (?00l elegance. More
complex scenes are beyond her
range, and, unfortunately for all
of us, the movie becomes more
and more complex as it goes
along.
Near the end, just after kill
ing the man who has raped her
and forced her to become his
mistress, she rejoins her hus
band (this is a very long book
and, time being relative, an
even longer movie). She says
brightly, "I have killed him!"
and the audience laughs. Any
point the movie might have had
is lost and will not be found
again.
The laughter is partially
Kinski's fault, but the ultimate
responsibility rests with
Polanski. Almost unbelievably
(especially when one remem
bers that the director chose to
open his version of Macbeth
with a lovingly gory shot of se
vered limbs), Polanski has
chosen to tone down the action
in the book, and to soften the
plight of his Tess.
In his piece on Hardy in
Portraits from Life, Ford
Madox Ford described his in
itial objections to Tess of the
d'llrbervilles: "we could not but
be aware that the book con
cerned itself with the hanging of
a nice young woman. And I did
not think . . . that one ought to

be harrowed by having to read
of a nice young woman being
hanged." Ford was writing in
jest, but Polanski appears to
have taken the criticism much
more seriously. We are not har
rowed, and we are not moved.
Tess' misfortunes begin when
she is raped by a man and bears
his child. This is the shame that
must affect everything else she
does. This is the shame that
finally moves her to commit
murder. But, possibly to make
this tale mpre "immediate" for
modern audiences, at the begin
ning we don't sense the anguish
that Tess must feel. The vil
lagers, instead of scorning her,
appreciate the love she feels for
the infant. If anything, her en
vironment is supportive.
This, in turn, makes the
motivations for most of the rest
of the movie seem very vague
indeed. We don't comprehend
why (and Kinski's inadequate
performance doesn't help us)
the Vicar of the church won't al
low the child a Christian burial
when it dies. We can't under
stand why the man Tess later
marries calls her decadent and
disgusting, and leaves her,
when she finally confesses what
has happened in her past. And,
most damnably of all, we don't
know what drives this beautiful,
gentle woman to murder the
man who gave her a child that
is, after all, no longer alive.
Polanski has created a work
that is almost devoid of passion.
This actually works to his ad
vantage in the rape scene, which
is nearly as understated, and as
brief, as it is in Hardy. But ev
erything else suffers from this

emotional aridness.
The climactic murder takes
place off-screen. Unlike vir
tually every homicide in any
movie of the last 20 years, the
killing isn't explicit enough
Polanski treats the murder deli
cately, almost coyly (so as not
to harrow us, one surmises).
This makes the events that fol
low seem just a little silly. The
danger here is that Polanski's
prettification campaign will
make people say, "look how
Hardy has dated," rather than,
"look how Polanski has altered
the tone of the work."
Everything in this movie is
given a sheen to match Kinski's
lip gloss. The shabby hut Tess'
family inhabits is made to look
comfortable and quaintly
primitive. City streets have a
picturesque patina of dust scat
tered about to make them look
lived in. The clothes of the
peasants are shabby in all the
right places.
The cinematography was
started bythe late Geoffrey Un
sworth (2001, Cabaret) and
completed by Chislain Cloquet.
It, too, is gorgeous; it, too, is
sometimes too gorgeous. The
look of the movie is so perfect,
and so picturesque, that it be
gins to look lifeless. '
The most effectively photo
graphed scene comes im
mediately after the in
termission, when Tess has been
left by her husband and is on her
way home. Here the image is al
lowed to become grainy and
coarse. Its starkness captures
something of the bitterness of
Tess' world. Then, sadly, the
movie returns to its former

slick, studio finish, and once
again we are confronted by wax
works. This is "epic" photogra
phy. It is the cold, impersonal
look of movies that strive to be
truly important. It is chilling
The director is at his best
when he allows himself to move
more slowly. In one sensuous,
lazy, funny scene, the man who
will become Tess' husband
(played by Peter Firth) encoun
ters four dairy maids. Tess
among them, on their way to
church. Their path has been
blocked by a huge puddle, so he
offers to carry them, one at a
time, to the other side. Firth
carries them across one by one

until he come to Tess and whis
pers, "three-quarters of this
trouble was for you alone." This
is a beautiful punchline to a
well-told anecdote, and, for a
movement, the movie soars.
Moments as good as this in
dicate that Polanski may have
been intimidated by his source.
Unwilling to render any real,
cinematic interpretation of it,
he contented himself with dra
matizing its "big moments."
What he forgot to do, or what he
was afraid to try. was to offer
any reason for seeing the movie
rather than staying home and
rereading the book.

to project a (?00l elegance. More
complex scenes are beyond her
range, and, unfortunately for all
of us, the movie becomes more
and more complex as it goes
along.
Near the end, just after kill
ing the man who has raped her
and forced her to become his
mistress, she rejoins her hus
band (this is a very long book
and, time being relative, an
even longer movie). She says
brightly, "I have killed him!"
and the audience laughs. Any
point the movie might have had
is lost and will not be found
again.
The laughter is partially
Kinski's fault, but the ultimate
responsibility rests with
Polanski. Almost unbelievably
(especially when one remem
bers that the director chose to
open his version of Macbeth
with a lovingly gory shot of se
vered limbs), Polanski has
chosen to tone down the action
in the book, and to soften the
plight of his Tess.
In his piece on Hardy in
Portraits from Life, Ford
Madox Ford described his in
itial objections to Tess of the
d'llrbervilles: "we could not but
be aware that the book con
cerned itself with the hanging of
a nice young woman. And I did
not think . . . that one ought to

be harrowed by having to read
of a nice young woman being
hanged." Ford was writing in
jest, but Polanski appears to
have taken the criticism much
more seriously. We are not har
rowed, and we are not moved.
Tess' misfortunes begin when
she is raped by a man and bears
his child. This is the shame that
must affect everything else she
does. This is the shame that
finally moves her to commit
murder. But, possibly to make
this tale mpre "immediate" for
modern audiences, at the begin
ning we don't sense the anguish
that Tess must feel. The vil
lagers, instead of scorning her,
appreciate the love she feels for
the infant. If anything, her en
vironment is supportive.
This, in turn, makes the
motivations for most of the rest
of the movie seem very vague
indeed. We don't comprehend
why (and Kinski's inadequate
performance doesn't help us)
the Vicar of the church won't al
low the child a Christian burial
when it dies. We can't under
stand why the man Tess later
marries calls her decadent and
disgusting, and leaves her,
when she finally confesses what
has happened in her past. And,
most damnably of all, we don't
know what drives this beautiful,
gentle woman to murder the
man who gave her a child that
is, after all, no longer alive.
Polanski has created a work
that is almost devoid of passion.
This actually works to his ad
vantage in the rape scene, which
is nearly as understated, and as
brief, as it is in Hardy. But ev
erything else suffers from this

emotional aridness.
The climactic murder takes
place off-screen. Unlike vir
tually every homicide in any
movie of the last 20 years, the
killing isn't explicit enough
Polanski treats the murder deli
cately, almost coyly (so as not
to harrow us, one surmises).
This makes the events that fol
low seem just a little silly. The
danger here is that Polanski's
prettification campaign will
make people say, "look how
Hardy has dated," rather than,
"look how Polanski has altered
the tone of the work."
Everything in this movie is
given a sheen to match Kinski's
lip gloss. The shabby hut Tess'
family inhabits is made to look
comfortable and quaintly
primitive. City streets have a
picturesque patina of dust scat
tered about to make them look
lived in. The clothes of the
peasants are shabby in all the
right places.
The cinematography was
started bythe late Geoffrey Un
sworth (2001, Cabaret) and
completed by Chislain Cloquet.
It, too, is gorgeous; it, too, is
sometimes too gorgeous. The
look of the movie is so perfect,
and so picturesque, that it be
gins to look lifeless. '
The most effectively photo
graphed scene comes im
mediately after the in
termission, when Tess has been
left by her husband and is on her
way home. Here the image is al
lowed to become grainy and
coarse. Its starkness captures
something of the bitterness of
Tess' world. Then, sadly, the
movie returns to its former

slick, studio finish, and once
again we are confronted by wax
works. This is "epic" photogra
phy. It is the cold, impersonal
look of movies that strive to be
truly important. It is chilling
The director is at his best
when he allows himself to move
more slowly. In one sensuous,
lazy, funny scene, the man who
will become Tess' husband
(played by Peter Firth) encoun
ters four dairy maids. Tess
among them, on their way to
church. Their path has been
blocked by a huge puddle, so he
offers to carry them, one at a
time, to the other side. Firth
carries them across one by one

until he come to Tess and whis
pers, "three-quarters of this
trouble was for you alone." This
is a beautiful punchline to a
well-told anecdote, and, for a
movement, the movie soars.
Moments as good as this in
dicate that Polanski may have
been intimidated by his source.
Unwilling to render any real,
cinematic interpretation of it,
he contented himself with dra
matizing its "big moments."
What he forgot to do, or what he
was afraid to try. was to offer
any reason for seeing the movie
rather than staying home and
rereading the book.

7V.s.s is based on Thomas Har
dy's Toss of the d'Urbervilles.
Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a
classic. Tess is not. What has
been lost is something more
than three words in the title.
Roman Polanski, who
directed and co-wrote Tess, has
summoned up a doppelgangerof
a movie. The characters' names
are the same, the landscape
looks familiar, the storyline
runs more or less as it does in
the book, but the soul of the
work is gone. Tess isn't by any
means a despicable or "bad"
movie. Much of it (especially in
the first half) is very good. But
one is left with the peculiar feel
ing that the movie, if let out into
the daylight, wouldn't cast a
shadow.
When a film is based on a
great novel, certain expecta
tions are created, whether the
filmmakers like them or not.
When the title and the story are
borrowed, so is the reputation.
The filmmakers (and the ad
vertisers) gain instant product
recognition. They also implicit
ly agree to take on a standard
against which the film may be
measured.
This "measurement" •is
something that doesn't happen
when a film is based on an ori
ginal story. It is something that
usually doesn't matter when a
film is based on popular fiction.
(Nobody really cared, for exam
ple, when Polanski's version of
Rosemary's Hciby differed sig
nificantly from the novel it was
taken from.)
It does matter here. One may

maintain that every movie,
even one called Tess, should be
judged on its own merits and not
on the degree to which it cap
tures the feeling of its source.
This impartial judgment isn't as
easy as it sounds, as anyone who
has read this novel, or any other
Hardy, will testify. Folanskihas
been at once too reverent (he
has included more plot than the
movie can bear) and not rever
ent enough (he is unable to
transfer any of Hardy's pas
sion).
Hardy is one of literature's
great descriptive writers. We
can see, and taste, and hear and
feel the environments he writes
about; we come to know his peo
ple. Hardy's title character is a
woman who is beautiful, in
telligent and serene. Polanski's
title character is merely beau
tiful.
Tess's centerpiece is
Nastassia Kinski, the 19-year
old daughter of German film
star Klaus Kinski She is lovely.
With her pouty lips and deep-set
eyes, she looks incredibly like
Ingrid Bergman. Looking at
her. one can almost believe that
she could, without in the least
intending to, drive men to do
terrible deeds.
But then Kinski opens her
mouth, and the spell is broken.
She is not a bad actress (though
she's not a terribly good one,
either), but she possesses the
one thing which a convincing
Tess must not have: she has an
accent. It is difficult to concen
trate on the plight of this poor
English girl when it sounds as if
she spent summers on the banks
of the Rhine. When the un-

familiar syllables come tumbl
ing from her lips, we see an ac
tress', not a character's, strug
gle.
It's not clear whether Kinski
would have been able to pull off
this admittedly difficult role in
any language. She is fine in the
quiet scenes, where she is able
to project a (?00l elegance. More
complex scenes are beyond her
range, and, unfortunately for all
of us, the movie becomes more
and more complex as it goes
along.
Near the end, just after kill

7V.s.s is based on Thomas Har
dy's Toss of the d'Urbervilles.
Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a
classic. Tess is not. What has
been lost is something more
than three words in the title.
Roman Polanski, who
directed and co-wrote Tess, has
summoned up a doppelgangerof
a movie. The characters' names
are the same, the landscape
looks familiar, the storyline
runs more or less as it does in
the book, but the soul of the
work is gone. Tess isn't by any
means a despicable or "bad"
movie. Much of it (especially in
the first half) is very good. But
one is left with the peculiar feel
ing that the movie, if let out into
the daylight, wouldn't cast a
shadow.
When a film is based on a
great novel, certain expecta
tions are created, whether the
filmmakers like them or not.
When the title and the story are
borrowed, so is the reputation.
The filmmakers (and the ad
vertisers) gain instant product
recognition. They also implicit
ly agree to take on a standard
against which the film may be
measured.
This "measurement" •is
something that doesn't happen
when a film is based on an ori
ginal story. It is something that
usually doesn't matter when a
film is based on popular fiction.
(Nobody really cared, for exam
ple, when Polanski's version of
Rosemary's Hciby differed sig
nificantly from the novel it was
taken from.)
It does matter here. One may

maintain that every movie,
even one called Tess, should be
judged on its own merits and not
on the degree to which it cap
tures the feeling of its source.
This impartial judgment isn't as
easy as it sounds, as anyone who
has read this novel, or any other
Hardy, will testify. Folanskihas
been at once too reverent (he
has included more plot than the
movie can bear) and not rever
ent enough (he is unable to
transfer any of Hardy's pas
sion).
Hardy is one of literature's
great descriptive writers. We
can see, and taste, and hear and
feel the environments he writes
about; we come to know his peo
ple. Hardy's title character is a
woman who is beautiful, in
telligent and serene. Polanski's
title character is merely beau
tiful.
Tess's centerpiece is
Nastassia Kinski, the 19-year
old daughter of German film
star Klaus Kinski She is lovely.
With her pouty lips and deep-set
eyes, she looks incredibly like
Ingrid Bergman. Looking at
her. one can almost believe that
she could, without in the least
intending to, drive men to do
terrible deeds.
But then Kinski opens her
mouth, and the spell is broken.
She is not a bad actress (though
she's not a terribly good one,
either), but she possesses the
one thing which a convincing
Tess must not have: she has an
accent. It is difficult to concen
trate on the plight of this poor
English girl when it sounds as if
she spent summers on the banks
of the Rhine. When the un-

familiar syllables come tumbl
ing from her lips, we see an ac
tress', not a character's, strug
gle.
It's not clear whether Kinski
would have been able to pull off
this admittedly difficult role in
any language. She is fine in the
quiet scenes, where she is able
to project a (?00l elegance. More
complex scenes are beyond her
range, and, unfortunately for all
of us, the movie becomes more
and more complex as it goes
along.
Near the end, just after kill
ing the man who has raped her
and forced her to become his
mistress, she rejoins her hus
band (this is a very long book
and, time being relative, an
even longer movie). She says
brightly, "I have killed him!"
and the audience laughs. Any
point the movie might have had
is lost and will not be found
again.
The laughter is partially
Kinski's fault, but the ultimate
responsibility rests with
Polanski. Almost unbelievably
(especially when one remem
bers that the director chose to
open his version of Macbeth
with a lovingly gory shot of se
vered limbs), Polanski has
chosen to tone down the action
in the book, and to soften the
plight of his Tess.
In his piece on Hardy in
Portraits from Life, Ford
Madox Ford described his in
itial objections to Tess of the
d'llrbervilles: "we could not but
be aware that the book con
cerned itself with the hanging of
a nice young woman. And I did
not think . . . that one ought to

be harrowed by having to read
of a nice young woman being
hanged." Ford was writing in
jest, but Polanski appears to
have taken the criticism much
more seriously. We are not har
rowed, and we are not moved.
Tess' misfortunes begin when
she is raped by a man and bears
his child. This is the shame that
must affect everything else she
does. This is the shame that
finally moves her to commit
murder. But, possibly to make
this tale mpre "immediate" for
modern audiences, at the begin
ning we don't sense the anguish
that Tess must feel. The vil
lagers, instead of scorning her,
appreciate the love she feels for
the infant. If anything, her en
vironment is supportive.
This, in turn, makes the
motivations for most of the rest
of the movie seem very vague
indeed. We don't comprehend
why (and Kinski's inadequate
performance doesn't help us)
the Vicar of the church won't al
low the child a Christian burial
when it dies. We can't under
stand why the man Tess later
marries calls her decadent and
disgusting, and leaves her,
when she finally confesses what
has happened in her past. And,
most damnably of all, we don't
know what drives this beautiful,
gentle woman to murder the
man who gave her a child that
is, after all, no longer alive.
Polanski has created a work
that is almost devoid of passion.
This actually works to his ad
vantage in the rape scene, which
is nearly as understated, and as
brief, as it is in Hardy. But ev
erything else suffers from this

emotional aridness.
The climactic murder takes
place off-screen. Unlike vir
tually every homicide in any
movie of the last 20 years, the
killing isn't explicit enough
Polanski treats the murder deli
cately, almost coyly (so as not
to harrow us, one surmises).
This makes the events that fol
low seem just a little silly. The
danger here is that Polanski's
prettification campaign will
make people say, "look how
Hardy has dated," rather than,
"look how Polanski has altered
the tone of the work."
Everything in this movie is
given a sheen to match Kinski's
lip gloss. The shabby hut Tess'
family inhabits is made to look
comfortable and quaintly
