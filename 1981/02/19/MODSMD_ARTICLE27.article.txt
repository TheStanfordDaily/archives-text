# 'Fort Apache, the Bronx': making movies the scrapbook way
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
The idea of Fort Apache, the Bronx is im
aginative and promising. The 41st Precinct,
we are told, is "a fort in hostile territory"; its
ragtaggle band of cops, all of whom would
much prefer to be elsewhere, works to provide
some semblance of peace and order in the
midst of that swamp of vice known as the
South Bronx. Old people and mothers with
babies hang out in front of the station because
it is the only safe spot in the neighborhood; in
side, the men have hung Indian souvenirs on
the walls as a symbol of the role they see
themselves playing (the cavalry in a
western). It's easy to think of the possible im-

Audiences sympathize with (Paul) Newman more fully,
perhaps, than any of her actor. . .he doesn't appear to have a
pretentious bone in his body.

plications of this parallel, and the early scenes
in the film feature enough knockabout humor
that we expect an ironic urban western com
edy with Paul Newman as the earnest, honest
hero.
Audiences sympathize with Newman more
fully, perhaps, than they do with any other
movie star. It's not just that he is un
reasonably handsome (and seems to grow
more attractive as he ages) but that he
projects more warmth and sincerity than
most actors. He comes across as intelligent
but not intellectual, and so he is able to play
men of vastly different educational back
grounds and with varying mental resources.

And he doesn't appear to have a pretentious
bone in his body.
Newman was anxious to play Murphy, the
cop hero of Fort Apache, and we can see why.
Murphy is a decent guy who tries to do his job
well and in an easygoing manner, but he
doesn't have much of a life outside the station
— he is divorced and sees his children only oc
casionally — so he spends perhaps too much
time in bars and in front of the television set.
He is so funny and unaffected that he is a fa
vorite of the other men on the force; he is also
truly honest, and the thought that others
might assume him to be subject to the corrup
tion to which many other cops fall prey in-

furiates him. He has to be restrained from hit
ting a pimp who tries to bribe him, and when
he and his partner Corelli (Ken Wahl) see an
other policeman (Danny Aiello) tossing an in
nocent Puerto Rican kid off a tenement roof,
Murphy is tormented by the conflict between
his overwhelming impulse to turn the killer in
and his awareness that to do so would read to
the other cops as disloyalty and brand him for
the rest of his career.
As Newman plays Murphy, the horror and
disgust he feels at witnessing this outrageous
breach of every tenet of his moral code is
nearly palpable. It is such an open, convincing
performance for most of the way we never

question Murphy's moral stance, which is. cer
tainly not shared by all his buddies, as we
might have questioned that of Al Pacino in
Serpicn. Serpico seemed so intellectually, as
well as morally, superior to everyone around
him thatwe began to see him as a saint; there
is no comparable danger in Fort Apache.
There are moments in the last scenes of the
picture when one senses that Newman is
playing at his role rather than playing it (he
has indulged in this kind of semi-serious act
ing in other movies — one could say that it is
his sole lapse of integrity), and he doesn't
carry off his big emotional piece, but that is
the fault of the director, Daniel Petrie, who
doesn't bring the camera close enough to es
tablish a much needed personal space for
Newman to inhabit in this scene (he is up
staged by the set). Still this performance is
among his best work; I hope that it attracts
more notice than his good acting usually has
(in pictures like The Life and Times of Judge
Roy Bean, Buffalo Bill and the Indians and
Slap Shot).
Ken Wahl's disco kid style presents an
amusing contrast to Newman's old-fashioned
gallantry; and though Wahl should take pains
not to look and sound so much like Travolta in
Saturday Night Fever, he is as fresh here as
he was in The Wanderers and his line readings
are more assured. There are a couple of tal
ented performers from the cast of the unfairly
neglected film Short Eyes, too; Miguel
Pinero, who plays a dope dealer, and Tito
Goya, who has an amazing five minutes as a
suicidal homosexual.
But despite all of these interesting per
formers, and the unusual texture of some of

the sequences (a long tracking shot down the
narrow hall of a squalid ghetto apartment, a
scene in which Newman and Aiello fight on the
street and have to be pulled apart by other
cops), Fort Apache is disappointing. It doesn't
deliver on the promise of its title and its initial
scenes. The movie opens with the shooting of
two policemen at point blank range by a
zonked-out black whore (Pam Grier); we ex
pect a war to develop between the force and
the underworld, but Petrie and the
screenwriter, Heywood Gould, pick up and
discard this theme so often and so arbitrarily
that you begin to feel that the shooting sched
ule must have arisen daily out of what Gould

happened to have read in the papers the night
before. The fact that the hooker murders in
discriminately, and then is killed off before
the cops can trace the deaths of her colleagues
to her, is supposed to be an ironic kick, but the
narrative is so disjointed that his point is lost.
At any rate, this woman's behavior is so puzzl
ing that it distracts us. Why does she direct vi
olence at every man she meets except her
pimp, who brutalizes her? How, if she is so
spaced out, is she shrewd enough to carry a
razor blade in her mouth in one scene, ready
for her next victim? Doesn't it hurt?
The whole movie suffers from a separation
of cause and effect. When we first encounter
the new captain (Edward Asner), he is pre

sented as a stock, result-oriented, author
itarian figure without special concern for the
citizens he is supposed to be protecting; he or
ders the arrest of half the neighborhood in
connection with the cop killings, and when a
mob gathers to protest the detention of mem
bers of the popular South Bronx People's Par
ty. he calls for tear gas. But then he fades
from the film, and so do his methods.
Even more curious is the romance between
Murphy and a nurse with a junk habit named
Isabelle (Rachel Ticotin). According to the
script, she goes with him because she is im
pressed that he has delivered a baby on his
beat, and there is an embarrassing scene in a

bar in which they hazard guesses about each
other's lives — embarrassing because both of
their analyses seem pointedly inaccurate, and
yet the movie makes no effort to either con
tradict them or suggest what in the world has
prompted them to talk to each other in this
way. The relationship is impenetrable: you
never believe that these two people would
have ten minutes' worth of conversation to ex
change But their affair is not obligatory
filler; evidently it is meant to be pivotal, like
the murder of the cops and the kid who is
thrown off the roof and the tough marine-like
police captain. Everything is given equal
weight — and everything is swept away. It's
the damnedest way to construct a movie.

Murphy is tormented by the conflict between
his overwhelming impulse to turn the killer in
and his awareness that to do so would read to
the other cops as disloyalty and brand him for
the rest of his career.
As Newman plays Murphy, the horror and
disgust he feels at witnessing this outrageous
breach of every tenet of his moral code is
nearly palpable. It is such an open, convincing
performance for most of the way we never

question Murphy's moral stance, which is. cer
tainly not shared by all his buddies, as we
might have questioned that of Al Pacino in
Serpicn. Serpico seemed so intellectually, as
well as morally, superior to everyone around
him thatwe began to see him as a saint; there
is no comparable danger in Fort Apache.
There are moments in the last scenes of the
picture when one senses that Newman is
playing at his role rather than playing it (he
has indulged in this kind of semi-serious act
ing in other movies — one could say that it is
his sole lapse of integrity), and he doesn't
carry off his big emotional piece, but that is
the fault of the director, Daniel Petrie, who
doesn't bring the camera close enough to es
tablish a much needed personal space for
Newman to inhabit in this scene (he is up
staged by the set). Still this performance is
among his best work; I hope that it attracts
more notice than his good acting usually has
(in pictures like The Life and Times of Judge
Roy Bean, Buffalo Bill and the Indians and
Slap Shot).
Ken Wahl's disco kid style presents an
amusing contrast to Newman's old-fashioned
gallantry; and though Wahl should take pains
not to look and sound so much like Travolta in
Saturday Night Fever, he is as fresh here as
he was in The Wanderers and his line readings
are more assured. There are a couple of tal
ented performers from the cast of the unfairly
neglected film Short Eyes, too; Miguel
Pinero, who plays a dope dealer, and Tito
Goya, who has an amazing five minutes as a
suicidal homosexual.
But despite all of these interesting per
formers, and the unusual texture of some of

the sequences (a long tracking shot down the
narrow hall of a squalid ghetto apartment, a
scene in which Newman and Aiello fight on the
street and have to be pulled apart by other
cops), Fort Apache is disappointing. It doesn't
deliver on the promise of its title and its initial
scenes. The movie opens with the shooting of
two policemen at point blank range by a
zonked-out black whore (Pam Grier); we ex
pect a war to develop between the force and
the underworld, but Petrie and the
screenwriter, Heywood Gould, pick up and
discard this theme so often and so arbitrarily
that you begin to feel that the shooting sched
ule must have arisen daily out of what Gould

happened to have read in the papers the night
before. The fact that the hooker murders in
discriminately, and then is killed off before
the cops can trace the deaths of her colleagues
to her, is supposed to be an ironic kick, but the
narrative is so disjointed that his point is lost.
At any rate, this woman's behavior is so puzzl
ing that it distracts us. Why does she direct vi
olence at every man she meets except her
pimp, who brutalizes her? How, if she is so
spaced out, is she shrewd enough to carry a
razor blade in her mouth in one scene, ready
for her next victim? Doesn't it hurt?
The whole movie suffers from a separation
of cause and effect. When we first encounter
the new captain (Edward Asner), he is pre

sented as a stock, result-oriented, author
itarian figure without special concern for the
citizens he is supposed to be protecting; he or
ders the arrest of half the neighborhood in
connection with the cop killings, and when a
mob gathers to protest the detention of mem
bers of the popular South Bronx People's Par
ty. he calls for tear gas. But then he fades
from the film, and so do his methods.
Even more curious is the romance between
Murphy and a nurse with a junk habit named
Isabelle (Rachel Ticotin). According to the
script, she goes with him because she is im
pressed that he has delivered a baby on his
beat, and there is an embarrassing scene in a

bar in which they hazard guesses about each
other's lives — embarrassing because both of
their analyses seem pointedly inaccurate, and
yet the movie makes no effort to either con
tradict them or suggest what in the world has
prompted them to talk to each other in this
way. The relationship is impenetrable: you
never believe that these two people would
have ten minutes' worth of conversation to ex
change But their affair is not obligatory
filler; evidently it is meant to be pivotal, like
the murder of the cops and the kid who is
thrown off the roof and the tough marine-like
police captain. Everything is given equal
weight — and everything is swept away. It's
the damnedest way to construct a movie.
The idea of Fort Apache, the Bronx is im
aginative and promising. The 41st Precinct,
we are told, is "a fort in hostile territory"; its
ragtaggle band of cops, all of whom would
much prefer to be elsewhere, works to provide
some semblance of peace and order in the
midst of that swamp of vice known as the
South Bronx. Old people and mothers with
babies hang out in front of the station because
it is the only safe spot in the neighborhood; in
side, the men have hung Indian souvenirs on
the walls as a symbol of the role they see
themselves playing (the cavalry in a
western). It's easy to think of the possible im-

Audiences sympathize with Newman more

movie star. It's not just that he is un
reasonably handsome (and seems to grow

men of vastly different educational back

Newman was anxious to play Murphy, the
cop hero of Fort Apache, and we can see why.
Murphy is a decent guy who tries to do his job

doesn't have much of a life outside the station
— he is divorced and sees his children only oc
casionally — so he spends perhaps too much
time in bars and in front of the television set.

might assume him to be subject to the corrup

scenes. The movie opens with the shooting of
two policemen at point blank range by a
zonked-out black whore (Pam Grier); we ex
pect a war to develop between the force and
the underworld, but Petrie and the
screenwriter, Heywood Gould, pick up and
discard this theme so often and so arbitrarily
that you begin to feel that the shooting sched

happened to have read in the papers the night
before. The fact that the hooker murders in
discriminately, and then is killed off before
the cops can trace the deaths of her colleagues
to her, is supposed to be an ironic kick, but the
narrative is so disjointed that his point is lost.
At any rate, this woman's behavior is so puzzl
ing that it distracts us. Why does she direct vi
olence at every man she meets except her
pimp, who brutalizes her? How, if she is so
spaced out, is she shrewd enough to carry a
razor blade in her mouth in one scene, ready
for her next victim? Doesn't it hurt?
The whole movie suffers from a separation
of cause and effect. When we first encounter
the new captain (Edward Asner), he is pre

sented as a stock, result-oriented, author
itarian figure without special concern for the
citizens he is supposed to be protecting; he or
ders the arrest of half the neighborhood in
connection with the cop killings, and when a
mob gathers to protest the detention of mem
bers of the popular South Bronx People's Par
ty. he calls for tear gas. But then he fades
from the film, and so do his methods.
Even more curious is the romance between
Murphy and a nurse with a junk habit named
Isabelle (Rachel Ticotin). According to the
script, she goes with him because she is im
pressed that he has delivered a baby on his
beat, and there is an embarrassing scene in a

bar in which they hazard guesses about each
other's lives — embarrassing because both of
their analyses seem pointedly inaccurate, and
yet the movie makes no effort to either con
tradict them or suggest what in the world has
prompted them to talk to each other in this
way. The relationship is impenetrable: you
never believe that these two people would
have ten minutes' worth of conversation to ex
change But their affair is not obligatory
filler; evidently it is meant to be pivotal, like
the murder of the cops and the kid who is
thrown off the roof and the tough marine-like
police captain. Everything is given equal
weight — and everything is swept away. It's
the damnedest way to construct a movie.
