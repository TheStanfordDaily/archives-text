# 'Woods' provides rare opportunity
## 
### Mike Hale 
The Drama Department pro
duction of Odon von Horvath's
Tales from the Vienna Woods is
a rare opportunity: the play,
written in 1931, was translated
only four years ago, and this is
one of its first productions in
America. It is generally thought
of as Horvath's best work, and
Horvath, after a long period of
neglect, currently has a reputa
tion to rival Brecht's. While the
current production has more
than its share of problems, no
one should miss a chance to see
this wonderful play.
Horvath gave Tales from the
Vienna Woods the following
epigraph: "Nothing gives as
strong an impression of infinity
as stupidity." The play has no
villains, only "stupid," ev
eryday people of varying
degrees of humanity. The main
problem with the Drama Dept.
production is that, in the princi
pal roles, the humanity seems to
have been discarded and only
the dullness and stupidity re
main. It is primarily a problem
of acting style: Mark Alan
Rhoda, who plays Alfred, a
good-for-nothing and occasional
bookie, and Sheila Brodie, who
plays Valerie, a tobacconist and
Alfred's occasional lover, act in

the same irritating manner. It is
a style that seems common
among college actors — Rhoda
and Brodie are both ferociously
correct in their enunciation, and
every line rolls out of their
mouths in a ringing sing-song as
they gaze soulfullv at the ceil
ing. I can't believe director
Jean-Bernard Bucky wanted
Rhoda to deliver every line in
exactly the same way. At least
Brodie exhibits what could be
called an emotion every so
often; Rhoda exhibits nothing
but pomposity at any time that
he is on stage.
Jennifer Green plavs
Marianne, the daughter of a Vi
ennese shopkeeper. The play
chronicles her fall as she breaks
her engagement to the
malevolent Oskar. a butcher,
and moves in with Alfred, not
recognizing him for the sponger
that he is. Green is always com
petent and under control;
Marianne is the only character
willing to fight against her cir
cumstances, and Green's re
strained performance conveys
Marianne's basic dignity very
well. In certain scenes, such as
the picnic which ends the first
act. she could do with a bit more
spunk, but overall her choices
are correct.
The actors in the minor roles
give the most memorable per
formances in this production
(this seems to be the norm in the
Little Theater). Most of the
parts have been made into
caricatures, and while one could
argue with the individual in
terpretations. they are all high
ly enjoyable. Of particular note
is Rush Rehm as Marianne's
father, the "Zauberkonig"' or
Magic King, who runs a magic
shop doll hospital. He's sup
posed to be pompous, and Rehm

does a very good job of it; one of
the best moments in the play
comes when the Zauberkonig,
convinced he is having a heart
attack, loudly begs God for
respite, and suddenly realizes
that nothing is wrong with his
heart Rehm carries off this dif
ficult scene with considerable
aplomb. Also very good are
Fred Bender as Oskar, the
butcher, and Sam Barker as
Erich, a Nazi-youth law stu
dent. They represent two dif
ferent sides of the totalitarian
mind — Erich is the en
thusiastic young moralist, loud
but priggish, who is constantly
arguing and generally making a
fool of himself, while Oskar is a
silent presence, always correct
in his actions but possessing a
basic malignancy which occa
sionally shows through.
Bender's portrayal of Oskar is
suitably enigmatic — at first
you think that Bender really
isn't doing much of anything on
stage, but his performance
grows on you. and he gradually
becomes a commanding figure.
A false note is struck by Nona
Barker as Alfred's grand
mother. the closest thing to a
villain in the play. Barker plays
her more like a wicked witch
than an evil human being,
teetering on and off stage and
screeching for all she's worth A
little of Bender's quietness
would be more appropriate for
her character.
Director Buckv has done the
play in cinematic style. One
scene melts into the next with
little or no pause, and the char
acters'entrances and exits are
done so that one gets a feeling of
constant motion. Several in
stances of violent action on
stage — Valerie falling and
knocking over a table, Marianne

attacking Alfred's grandmother
with a zither — have been
eliminated, making the action
even smoother. This is ap
propriate for the Little Theater,
with its lack of a curtain and
moveable properties; another
factor is the length of the play,
more than three hours if uncut.
Bucky has cut out large pieces
of the third act, apparently for
reasons of time. The cuts are
generally benign, although one
important scene between
Valerie and the Zauberkonig
should have been left — without
it, we lose the motivation for the
Zauberkonig's reconciliation
with his daughter, and we also
miss one of the few glimpses of
Valerie's human side.
One major complaint I have
with this production is its em
phasis on the play's prurient
aspects. No one misses a chance
to give a line or an action sexual
overtones, usually in the
crudest manner possible. Espe
cially irritating is Brodie's coy
way of turning everything into a
phallic symbol (presumably
with the director's encourage
ment). Guns should only be
stroked in dorm plays. The pro
duction sometimes gives the im
pression of a bunch of high
schoolers madly mugging and
trying to out-gross each other.
This general carnality doesn't
fit with the reticence of the tav
ern scene, where the sex is sup
posed to be at its most explicit.
Horvath's stage directions call
for "naked women," including
Marianne; Bucky has hidden ev
eryone behind towels and gauze.
This is his prerogative, of
course, and it is probably the
right choice; but if he is going to
make this concession, he should
also be able to do without the
schoolboy jokes.
