# Rock against radioactivity

### Scott McIntyre 
Jackson Browne will headline
a benefit concert Friday at the
Sacramento Memorial
Auditorium. Proceeds will go to
an assortment of anti-nuclear
groups fighting for closure of
the Rancho Seco nuclear reac
tor near Sacramento and for the
permanent denial of an operat
ing license to the Diablo Canyon
nuclear facility north of San
Luis Obispo.
In the last several years,
Browne has not been paid for
most of his performances, pre
ferring instead to donate his
time to help raise money for the
anti-nuclear cause. Recently,
he has performed with Graham
Nash, Pete Seeger and others,
and appeared in the movie, No
Nukes.
Joining Browne on the bill are
musicians Cris Williamson and
Floyd Westerman, and John
Trudell, a spokesperson for
native American groups. The
concert has been organized by
Pacific Alliance, a nationwide
non-profit production agency.
"The function of Pacific Al
liance is to provide professional
concert promotion for anti-nu
clear and environmental
groups," said Rex Wyler, a Pa
cific Alliance spokesperson.
"We'll be producing between 30
and 50 concerts this year."
Portions of the proceeds will
go to Citizens for Safe Energy, a
Sacramento lobbying group;
People for a Nuclear-Free
Future, a Davis-based group
working for the conversion of
nuclear weapons research to
peacetime activities; and
Greenpeace Sacramento, a lo
cal chapter of the Greenpeace
organization working to expose
and stop transportation of nu

clear materials in the Sacra
mento area.
These groups, composed of lo
cal residents, are concerned
with high levels of radioactive
iodine found in dairy milk near,
Rancho Seco, shipments in and
out of the nuclear waste facility
located there, recent radio
active leaks, and future rate in
creases due to new safety regu
lations arising from the Three
Mile Island accident, Wyler
said.
The Rancho Seco reactor is a
twin of the Three Mile Island re
actor in Harrisburg, Pa.
The remainder of the money
will go to the Abalone Alliance
in San Luis Obispo to help buy

media space to keep the Diablo
Canyon nuclear plant from ob
taining an operating license.
That plant has been found to be
located on or near an active geo
logic fault zone.
The Abalone Alliance is in
volved in safe energy informa
tion distribution, a spokes
person said, and is gearing up
for a May 19 hearing before the
Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board to decide whether to
grant PG&E a low-power tes
ting permit. That would be tan
tamount to an operating license,
the spokesperson said, because
it would require putting fuel in
the core and starting the reac
tor.
