# Reagan speech calls for budget, tax cuts
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services with staff reports
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan urged Congress last night to
"act forcefully, and now," to cut $41
billion in spending and enact tax re
ductions worth $1500 to a middle-in
come family of four over the next
three years.
To the applause of a politically
divided Congress. Reagan proposed
the most drastic set of budget cuts
ever recommended by a president,
saying they were necessary to reverse
the course of a government "some
what out of control."
Reagan said his proposal, if enacted
in full, would halve the inflation rate,
create 3 million jobs and balance the
budget by 1984.
Reagan's "program for economic
recovery" would put the government
upon an untested path leading away
from spending and regulatory trends
that date back almost 50 years to
Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.
"There is nothing wrong with
America that we can't fix," he de
clared
Across the board
Reagan called for sweeping cuts
across the board in virtually every
area of federal spending except de
fense. And he told Congress that, if it
enacts his "economic recovery pro
gram," he will follow up with addi
tional proposals for "desirable tax
changes." Such changes could include
indexing income tax brackets to pro
tect taxpayers against inflation,
granting school tuition tax credits and
abolishing the so-called "marriage
penalty" tax.
Addressing a joint session of Con
gress for the first time since taking of
fice a month ago.the president painted
what he called a grim picture of the
economy. But he said that he had
painted it accurately.
The president was greeted by a pro
longed standing ovation from Con
gress, his Cabinet, his wife Nancy and
spectators who watched from the
House galleries. His speech was inter
rupted 14 times by applause, when he
mentioned budget cuts and also when
he promised to boost defense spend
ing. There was only silence when Rea
gan pledged to save major social pro
grams from the budget knife,
Reagan's proposed budget cuts,
most of which had been system
atically leaked to the press in recent
days, include trims of $5.5 billion from
spending in the 1981 fiscal year ending

Sept. 30.
It is for the 1982 budget year, which
begins Oct. 1, that Reagan has pro
posed to clamp down on federal spend
ing most forcefully. That budget has
been described as a Republican blue
print designed to carry out the presi
dent's campaign pledge to "get the
government off the people's backs."
Reagan described his recovery plan
as "a comprehensive four-part pro
gram'' and pointed out that he had re
leased specific details of the blueprint
in a bulky document called, "Ameri
ca's New Beginning: a Program for
Economic Recovery."
"This plan is aimed at reducing the
growth in government spending and
taxing, reforming and eliminating
regulations which are unnecessary
and counterproductive, and encourag
ing a consistent monetary policy
aimed at maintaining the value of the
currency." he said.
Defense boost
Reagan proposed a $169.5 billion
boost in military spending beyond
levels already planned over the next
five years.
Actually, Reagan said, the Pen
tagon does not entirely escape the
budget ax. The Department of De
fense, he said, came up with specific
cuts in proposed outlays that would
save $2.9 billion in 1982 and a total of
$28.2 billion by 1986.
But Reagan said that his duty as
president required that he recom
mend overall increases in defense
spending during the coming years be
cause "since 1970, the Soviet Union
has invested $300 billion more in its
military forces than we have."
"As a result of its massive military
buildup," Reagan said, "the Soviets
now have a significant numerical ad
vantage in strategic nuclear delivery
systems, tactical aircraft, sub
marines. artillery and anti-aircraft
defense. To allow this imbalance to
continue is a threat to our national se
curity."
Reagan emphasized that it was
"important to note that weare only re
ducing the rate of increase in taxing
and spending We arc rot attempting
to cut either spending or taxing to a
level below that which we presently
have. This plan will get our economy
moving again, increase productivity
growth, and thus create the jobs our
people must have."
If enacted in full, he said, his pro-
gram would help control inflation and
create 13 million new jobs, "nearly
three million more than we would
have without these measures "
According to Economics Prof.
Michael Boskin, an adviser to Reagan,
the plan "is a very good beginning. I
see a very, very gradual abatement of
inflation This type of thing of has to
occur for many years before it has any
long-range effect."
Boskin said he thought Reagan was
very effective in "conveying a sense
of urgency" concerning the economic
outlook for the United States But
"getting it through Congress will be
another issue because there are a lot
of actors in the game and everybody
has their own ideas,' he said.
Reagan's plan would steer the na
tion into uncharted economic waters.
If enacted, it could either cause the
most dramatic turnaround in the na
tion's economy since President
Franklin Roosevelt led the country out
of the Great Depression in the 19305,
or it could result in more serious un
employment and perhaps other eco
nomic complications.
The president's economic
projections were based primarily on
optimistic assumptions about the na
tion's future, based on his advisers'
theories of "supply-side economics"
and the importance of tax reductions
in bringing faster growth and less in
flation
Reagan's advisers described his
projections not as a forecast, but as a
scenario, because they are not based
on standard economic analysis. More
orthodox economists have termed
such projections wisful thinking.
One well-known economist, Nobel
laureate Paul Samuelson, has sug
gested that a radical, crash program
such as that proposed by Reagan could
prove to be a greater risk than trying
to cope with inflation without
drastically altering present taxing
and spending patterns.

from spending and regulatory trends
that date back almost 50 years to
Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.
"There is nothing wrong with
America that we can't fix," he de
clared
Across the board
Reagan called for sweeping cuts
across the board in virtually every
area of federal spending except de
fense. And he told Congress that, if it
enacts his "economic recovery pro
gram," he will follow up with addi
tional proposals for "desirable tax
changes." Such changes could include
indexing income tax brackets to pro
tect taxpayers against inflation,
granting school tuition tax credits and
abolishing the so-called "marriage
penalty" tax.
Addressing a joint session of Con
gress for the first time since taking of
fice a month ago.the president painted
what he called a grim picture of the
economy. But he said that he had
painted it accurately.
The president was greeted by a pro
longed standing ovation from Con
gress, his Cabinet, his wife Nancy and
spectators who watched from the
House galleries. His speech was inter
rupted 14 times by applause, when he
mentioned budget cuts and also when
he promised to boost defense spend
ing. There was only silence when Rea
gan pledged to save major social pro
grams from the budget knife,
Reagan's proposed budget cuts,
most of which had been system
atically leaked to the press in recent
days, include trims of $5.5 billion from
spending in the 1981 fiscal year ending

Sept. 30.
It is for the 1982 budget year, which
begins Oct. 1, that Reagan has pro
posed to clamp down on federal spend
ing most forcefully. That budget has
been described as a Republican blue
print designed to carry out the presi
dent's campaign pledge to "get the
government off the people's backs."
Reagan described his recovery plan
as "a comprehensive four-part pro
gram'' and pointed out that he had re
leased specific details of the blueprint
in a bulky document called, "Ameri
ca's New Beginning: a Program for
Economic Recovery."
"This plan is aimed at reducing the
growth in government spending and
taxing, reforming and eliminating
regulations which are unnecessary
and counterproductive, and encourag
ing a consistent monetary policy
aimed at maintaining the value of the
currency." he said.
Defense boost
Reagan proposed a $169.5 billion
boost in military spending beyond
levels already planned over the next
five years.
Actually, Reagan said, the Pen
tagon does not entirely escape the
budget ax. The Department of De
fense, he said, came up with specific
cuts in proposed outlays that would
save $2.9 billion in 1982 and a total of
$28.2 billion by 1986.
But Reagan said that his duty as
president required that he recom
mend overall increases in defense
spending during the coming years be
cause "since 1970, the Soviet Union
has invested $300 billion more in its
military forces than we have."
"As a result of its massive military
buildup," Reagan said, "the Soviets
now have a significant numerical ad
vantage in strategic nuclear delivery
systems, tactical aircraft, sub
marines. artillery and anti-aircraft
defense. To allow this imbalance to
continue is a threat to our national se
curity."
Reagan emphasized that it was
"important to note that weare only re
ducing the rate of increase in taxing
and spending We arc rot attempting
to cut either spending or taxing to a
level below that which we presently
have. This plan will get our economy
moving again, increase productivity
growth, and thus create the jobs our
people must have."
If enacted in full, he said, his pro-
gram would help control inflation and
create 13 million new jobs, "nearly
three million more than we would
have without these measures "
According to Economics Prof.
Michael Boskin, an adviser to Reagan,
the plan "is a very good beginning. I
see a very, very gradual abatement of
inflation This type of thing of has to
occur for many years before it has any
long-range effect."
Boskin said he thought Reagan was
very effective in "conveying a sense
of urgency" concerning the economic
outlook for the United States But
"getting it through Congress will be
another issue because there are a lot
of actors in the game and everybody
has their own ideas,' he said.
Reagan's plan would steer the na
tion into uncharted economic waters.
If enacted, it could either cause the
most dramatic turnaround in the na
tion's economy since President
Franklin Roosevelt led the country out
of the Great Depression in the 19305,
or it could result in more serious un
employment and perhaps other eco
nomic complications.
The president's economic
projections were based primarily on
optimistic assumptions about the na
tion's future, based on his advisers'
theories of "supply-side economics"
and the importance of tax reductions
in bringing faster growth and less in
flation
Reagan's advisers described his
projections not as a forecast, but as a
scenario, because they are not based
on standard economic analysis. More
orthodox economists have termed
such projections wisful thinking.
One well-known economist, Nobel
laureate Paul Samuelson, has sug
gested that a radical, crash program
such as that proposed by Reagan could
prove to be a greater risk than trying
to cope with inflation without
drastically altering present taxing
and spending patterns.
From the Daily wire services with staff reports
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan urged Congress last night to
"act forcefully, and now," to cut $41
billion in spending and enact tax re
ductions worth $1500 to a middle-in
come family of four over the next
three years.
To the applause of a politically
divided Congress. Reagan proposed
the most drastic set of budget cuts
ever recommended by a president,
saying they were necessary to reverse
the course of a government "some
what out of control."
Reagan said his proposal, if enacted
in full, would halve the inflation rate,
create 3 million jobs and balance the
budget by 1984.
Reagan's "program for economic
recovery" would put the government
upon an untested path leading away
from spending and regulatory trends
that date back almost 50 years to
Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.
