hilaration: American Ballet
t Theatre's production of La
f&ayadrre had some of each of
these. Even more, it had a few
ijfOod laughs. Indeed, the com-
Bany held back on nothing — ex
' cept perhaps the choreography,
the plot, and the action.
Hj La Bayadere ("The Temple
■Dancer ") presents the story of a

noble warrior and a temple
dancer who swear eternal love
to one another despite the love
of a high priest for the dancer.
The high priest swears to kill the
warrior, but unnecessarily —
the Radjah offers his daughter's
hand to the great warrior first,
forcing him to forsake his true
love. Aware that her future hus
band does not love her, the Rad
jah s daughter devises a plot to
get rid of the temple dancer:
during the betrothal ceremony,

in which the bayadere is forced
to dance, the Radjah's daughter
sends the dancer a bouquet of
flowers. As the bayadere ad
mires the flowers, a deadly
viper strikes from within them,
killing her instantly.
The bayadere continues to
dance, however, now in the land
of shadows. There the warrior
visits her in an opium dream.
When he awakes he must be wed
to the Radjah's daughter. He
eventually repeats the vows, but
speaks them in his deluded mind
not to the Radjah's daughter but
to the memory of his true love.
Finally the gods wreak ven
geance on the mortals by caus
ing an earthquake that destroys
the world. The result? The war
rior and the bayadere may
dance together eternally in the
land of the shadows.
As far as the plot goes, La
Bayadere consists mainly of
vain oaths and sudden deaths.
The problem is that there is not
much in the way of develop
ment. Solor, the warrior, for in
stance, is considered great be
cause he has killed a tiger. Yet
we never see him in action
against the tiger; he merely
struts on stage and orders the
others to carry the tiger away:
The ballet as a whole has the
same problem. At the beginning
of the matinee, the lovers are in
love. By the end they've been re
united. In between, a few
awkward details are ironed out,
but their importance — indeed
the importance of the whole
love story — is dwarfed by the

gods' decision to destroy the
world.
Generally when the story of a
ballet is dull, the choreography
strives to make up for it through
exciting new moves and
challenges for the dancers. In
the case of La Bayadere, those
who hope for such redemption
will be disappointed. The dan
cers invoke the gods by raising
their arms to heaven, and in
dicate revenge with a fist. They
salute by touching a hand to
their forehead, and indicate
married status or an impending
wedding by pointing to the third
finger of the left hand. The tem
ple dancer shows her love for
the warrior by leaning against
him and lifting her leg in a
phallus-like arabesque. Mixed
into this vastly unimaginative
choreography are a few
pirouettes, leaps and ar
abesques. Occasionally, the
men pick up the women, too. To
top it all off, 20 dancing girls in
white tutus move in a slow and
soothing way to lullaby-like mu
sic. LkLthliJL* . • •
Only one hope remains when
both the plot and the choreo
graphy are dull: individual ex
cellence. Luckily for our heavy
eyelids, there were some stars
in Saturday afternoon's per
formance. Cynthia Gregory, as
Gamzati, the Radjah's daugh
ter, seemed to create grace.
One pirouette, in particular,
spiraled up and suspended for a
long, spellbinding moment. It
was a shame that she couldn't
have danced longer. Kevin

McKenzie, as the warrior, also
executed some inspiring leaps
and turns. Johan Renvall, the
Bronze Idol who appears in the
last act, bounded off with the
hearts and enthusiasm of the au
dience. His body control was
breathtaking, consisting of
strange contortions that un
twisted to carry him into wild
leaping turns. His one solo sug
gested the intensity that the rest
of the performance lacked
What would ABT do without
its marvelous soloists? It would
have to rely on the few remain
ing factors of this production
that kept the attention of the au
dience and made the show
worthwhile entertainment, the
sets, props, and special effects.
Did Rousseau paint the sets?
Where did they get a stuffed
Tony-the-Tiger? How much did
they spend on dry ice? Have you
ever seen such a long rubber
snake? How would you get
across the idea that an earth
quake destroys everything
without destroying all your
sets? If you were the American
Ballet Theatre you would fan
some smoke on stage, paint a
gauze curtain with blocks and
rocks, and have the curtain de
scend slowly as the dancers
seem to disappear in the wake
of all that smoke. And you
wouldn't forget the red lights.
[aj Bayadere has spectacle,
drama, special effects, a few
moments of movement and
grace, and even some laughs. It
gives some of what we go to the
ballet for, but not enough.
