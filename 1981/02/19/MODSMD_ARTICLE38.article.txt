Crash passengers escape serious injury
Santa Ana — Quick action by the pilot of a jetliner that was
landing with 109 people aboard may have helped avert tragedy
when he crash-landed his plane in flames after spotting another
plane on the runway, authorities said yesterday
Thirty-four people were injured, none seriously, in the accident
Tuesday night at John Wayne Airport in Orange County
Apparently both the incoming Air California Boeing 737 and an
other Air California jet bound for San Jose with 117 people abo ird
were cleared for the same runway at the same time, but there was
no immediate comment from authorities on how that could hap
pen.
An investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board
who asked not to be identified said. It looks like we have some
heroes in the crew, but that's for the investigation to decide
Air California spokesman Mark Peterson said We were very
lucky that the crew performed in such a professional way
"There was no panic, and this is a tribute to al! the passengers
and the crew. "
Airport operations chief Dennis Horn said. 1 think it was prob
ably a combination of skill on the part of the air crew and a tor
tunate turn of events The airplane didn't break up The emer
gency response was outstanding
Horn also said it was fortunate that the tlaming jetliner came to
rest in front of the airport fire station after the crash landing He
said rescue personnel were at the scene within a minute and were
able to quickly control the fire
The plane on the ground aborted its takeoff and was not dam
aged when the incoming jet tried to abort its landing but hit the
runway with such force that its wheels collapsed and the fuselage
cracked in half, airline officials said.
Both planes had been told to abort by frantic air traffic con
trollers who saw a collision developing, but a witness monitoring
the airline's radio frequency said the pilot of the landing jet yelled
over the radio at the pilot on the ground to "Go' Go' Go!' ap
parentlv trying to get the plane out of the way
U.S. pledges to honor hostage agreement
Washington — The State Department yesterday officially
pledged to carry out the hostage-release agreement with Iran
saying that compliance best serves L'.S. interests in the oil-rich
Persian Gulf area and the rest of the world
"W'e did not find it necessary to reach a conclusion as to the le
gally-binding character of these agreements under international
law.'' State Department spokesman William Dyess said We are
proceeding because we believe it is in the overall interests of the
United States to carry out the agreement.''
At the same time that he gave the Reagan administration's ap
proval to the implementation of the complex agreements, Dyess
warned that former President Jimmy Carter s response to the
Iranian hostage taking should not be viewed as a U.S. precedent.
Declaring that the Reagan administration would not have nego
tiated for the hostages' release. Dyess read a prepared statement
that said: "Future acts of state-sponsored terrorism against the
U.S. will meet swift and sure punishment.''
During his 1980 election campaign. President Ronald Reagan
did not take public issue with the Carter adminstration's efforts
to negotiate the release of the 52 hostages, but upon their release
he declared that any such actions against U.S. diplomats in the
future would be met by swift retribution. The new administration
immediately launched a task-force review of the release agree
ments. which were completed in the last hours of Carter's presi
dency.
Yesterday, the State Department released the task force's con
clusions.
Dyess said yesterday that the task force, which has completed
its review, considered the rights of U S citizens with claims
against Iran. U.S. policy toward terrorism, long-term U.S. in
terests in Iran and the Persian Gulf and other international in
terests. including obligations to third countries He specifically
mentioned Algeria, which acted as the go-between in the delicate
negotiations for release of the diplomats, who were held for 444
days by Moslem militants.
Gay conservatives to fight Moral Majority
San Francisco — A group of predominantly gay San Francisco
Republicans announced plans yesterday to combat a Moral Ma

jority campaign to turn the city against its large homosexual
community
Duke Armstrong, president of Concerned Republicans for Indi
v ldual Rights, said Republican organizations in other cities would
be asked to help his 175-member group in the forming of "Cor
nerstone.' a conservative coalition "to protect and defend the
Bill .of Rights."
One goal of the plan, said Armstrong, will be "to generate a re
sponsible political response to the Moral Majority."
A coalition ot fundamentalist church and Moral Majority
groups last week announced plans for a $3 million media blitz
against San Francisco's gays, calling the city the "Sodom and
Gomorrah of the United States
The city's gay community is estimated at 15 percent ot a popu
lation of 675.000.
"As Republicans, we cannot help but defend their right to say
and believe in what they may," Armstrong said at a news con
ference "But we do wish for the citizens of San Francisco and the
United States to realize that this Republican organization be
lieves these groups are intent upon denying constitutional guaran
tees .to a minority whose singular sin is to be different ''
Armstrong said that while gays were the initial target, "we see
their aims as being much more pervasive in limiting rights to mil
lions of Americans."
Court to rule on death penalty jury choice
San Francisco The state Supreme Court agreed yesterday to
consider whether excluding jurors opposed to the death penalty
results in an unfair jury for the guilt phase of a murder trial.
It also will decide if failing to provide tor consideration of
mitigating evidence in imposing a life term without parole in a
murcier case violates Constitutional sanctions against cruel and
unusual punishment
The challenge comes from John Zimmerman, who wants his
conviction for murdering a Los Angeles couple overturned. Spe
cial circumstances, requiring either the death penalty or life
without parole, were found
The prosecutor in the case systematically used challenges re
quiring no reason to exclude prospective jurors who had reserva
tions about the death penalty. However, they said they could be
impartial in the guilt phase
Zimmerman claims this deprived him of his right to a fair
cross-section jury under state and federal constitutions.
He said the alternative sentence allowed, life without parole,
denied consideration of mitigating circumstances
Zimmerman was found guilty of murdering Vriana and Brian
Dean and of burglary and rape The jury could not agree on a sen
tence. and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles Wood
mansee gave him life.
A Court of Appeal on Oct. 20 said the defendant can't be
deprived of the right to an impartial jury that is a fair cross-sec
tion of the community by systematic exclusion of a "cognizable
class" of citizens.
But it said it found little or no authority holding that the
elimination of jurors because of their opposition to the death pen
alty results in an unfair jury for the guilt phase of the trial.
It also pointed to a 1980 California Supreme Court ruling that
held two separate juries were not necessary in capital cases.

New York — A fire sent billowing black smoke through the 800-
room Harley Hotel in mid-Manhattan yesterday, the day of its of
ficial opening. At least a dozen persons were injured.

rush hour clogged 42nd Street, watching the clouds of thick smoke
pouring from the building and the squads of firemen who entered
the hotel in relays to fight the blaze.

fire engines, ambulances and police emergency vehicles con
verged on the hotel, across a narrow alley from the New York
Daily News Building.

hotel employees received oxygen for smoke inhalation. At least

Lack of funds ends police 'sting' operation
San Francisco — Police "sting" operations that bought back
nearly $4 5 million in stolen goods and resulted in a "99 percent
conviction rate' have ended with the expiration of federal financ
ing, officials say.
San Francisco Police Department officers, in a news briefing
yesterday, described the four storefront stings, including the
latest one in which hidden microphones and cameras recorded ev
idence against 52 suspects, 41 of whom have been arrested
Despite the success of the undercover effort, "there are a lot
more fences out there," said Lt, Vernon McDowell
"Doggone it, it was the first time we really had a chance to at
tack the problem Usually we just react." McDowell said, when
asked to assess the program
He was reluctant to predict how the operations' demise would
affect burglary in the city but later he said that statistics in other
cities show that the crime usually increases somewhat after the
stings are discontinued
Since 1977, when the sting operations began, the number of bur
glaries in San Francisco have dropped from 19.258 to 16,795 in
1980, according to Police Chief Cornelius Murphy.
By the end of 1980, the undercover team of 10 officers had re
covered nearly $4.5 million in stolen property, McDowell said.
Some of the property was found after police obtained warrants to
check the residences of fences. McDowell said.
Under the first federal grant of $400,000, 304 people were ar
rested The second award, $312,000 from the federal Law Enforce
ment Assistance Administration, was used in three operations
that saw 362 arrests. A total ot 88 fences were arrested under all
the operations, Murphy reported.
