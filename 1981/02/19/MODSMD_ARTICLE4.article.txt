From the Daily wire services
Washington â€” The politically divided Congress
gave President Ronald Reagan's sweeping econom
ic program a generally favorable reception yester
day despite the revolutionary nature of some of his
tax and spending cut proposals.
"In no way are we going to obstruct you," House
Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) said he
told the president after a White House briefing on
the program for congressional leaders.
O'Neill, whose Democrats hold a sharply
diminished majority in the House, said that he also
told Reagan that "we understand the feeling and the
will of the American people and we intend to move
as expeditiously as we possibly can."
Rep. Clair Burgener (R-Calif.), a member of the
House GOP leadership team, said Reagan got a gen
erally good reception when he presented the pro
gram at the White House briefing.
"Not even any Democrats jumped up and said,
'Hell, you can't do that' or 'My God,' " said
Burgener, secretary of the House GOP conference,
the organization of all House Republicans.
Expressions of support also came from leaders of
the Senate's majority Republicans and minority

Democrats.
"It is my hope that we can take the first step
through the Senate by Easter," Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn), said in reference to a
forthcoming resolution that would direct con
gressional committees to make specified spending
cuts in government programs.
Speaking for Senate Democrats, Minority Leader
Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) said, "our policy is not
going to be one of obstruction. Our policy is going to
be one of cooperation in reducing federal spending
where it can be done equitably and fairly."
But Byrd, along with other Democrats in both the
Senate and House, made it clear that they had strong
reservations about Reagan's tax cut proposals.
They charged that the cuts would unfairly favor the
wealthy.
House Majority Leader Jim Wright (D-Texas)
went further than Byrd in criticizing Reagan's call
for an across-the-board tax cut of 10 percent each
year for three years.
"A blunderbuss approach," Wright said of the tax
proposal. "It would add to deficits and inflation."
He said that there were other tax approaches to
meeting Reagan's goals of increasing industrial

productivity and cutting inflation.
From those comments, it appeared that the new
president's proposals for cutting spending would
command broader support in Congress than his tax
cut proposals.
Rep. James Jones (D-Okla.) chairman of the
House Budget Committee, where the resolution
mandating spending cuts will originate, expressed
optimism that the bulk of the president's proposed
spending reductions could be passed fairly soon.
While praising Reagan for what he proposed. Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) said that he would like to go
even further in cutting both spending and taxes.
House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-Ill.)
called the tax proposal "the most significant pro
gram of tax-rate reduction we've ever had."
While joining other Democrats in promising coop
eration, Senate Minority Whip Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.) called Reagan's economic proposals "an ex
periment with the nation's economic program and
with the well-being of millions of Americans.
"The experiment may work," Cranston con
tinued. "It may not. But the voters last November
decided to give Ronald Reagan his economic turn at
bat."
