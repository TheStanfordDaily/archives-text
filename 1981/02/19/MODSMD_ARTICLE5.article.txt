# South Africa boycott debated
## 
### Fred Wainwright 
The second of a series of debates
sponsored by the Stanford Debate
Team addressed the issue of whether
the United States should impose a
boycott on South Africa because of its
racist policies.
The purpose of the series, according
to Prof. Kennell Jackson, is "to en
courage intelligent talk at Stanford."
Jackson was one of the speakers in last
night's debate held at Branner Hall.
Winning a coin toss, Jackson and his
companion, Patrick Woolley, a mem
ber of the Debate Team, decided to
speak in favor of the boycott. Dr. Lew
is Gann, Senior Fellow of the Hoover
Institute, and Jerry Wertheimer, also
a member of the Debate Team, had to
try to show that the boycott was un
necessary.
"With a white minority in power.
South Africa has a dinosaur govern
ment," Jackson said in his first eight
minute speech. "The prime minister
suggested that the South Africans
adapt or die. "
"Since 1955, there has been more
subversion, guerrilla warfare and ra
cial problems in South Africa than in
any other place in Africa. Nothing can
get better for blacks, or whites. The
time is perfect; Reagan can do in
South Africa what Carter couldn't. We
need the surgical instrument of

boycott in South Africa."
Answering a cross-examination
question from Wertheimer, Jackson
said that "apartheid is not settled in
South Africa, so it can be weakened."
Gann centered his eight-minute
speech on the idea that other African
countries are in the same "condition
of inequity". He also stressed that
South Africa is very developed and
that the 100 percent increase in manu
facturing since World War II has
brought profits that "have un
mistakeably trickled down to the
blacks".
Woolley asked Gann to explain the
racist riots in South Africa during the
two-minute cross examination. Gann
answered that the main reason for the
riots was that the "poor blacks were
scared of more unemployment."
Gann said the boycott would increase
the chances of there being less jobs.
Woolley then proceeded to give his
argument for the creation of the
boycott. "South Africa," he said, "has
a systematic, complete oppression
based on racism. The blacks are co
lonized." He went on to say that South
Africa is not vital to the U.S. but added
that a gradual boycott would be pref
erable because of the dependence the
two countries have on each other.
He ended his speech by quoting

Golin Legum, an editor of several
newspapers dealing with Africa. "If
human rights are to mean anything at
all for the international community,
this must mean relegating apartheid
to the garbage can of obscenities."
Speaking against the boycott,
Wertheimer said that South Africa
and the Soviet Union have control of
the production of various minerals
and a U.S. boycott would allow Soviet
influence to grow in South Africa.
Warning that "the world does not
accept bigotry," Wertheimer stressed
that there are other countries commit
ing "evils."
"The U. 5.," he continued, "is not
going to help blacks by pulling out."
He had suggested that through Ameri
can companies already settled in
South Africa, equal opportunity em
ployment could be implemented.
Following Wertheimer's speech,
members of the audience asked ques
tions of the speakers. Answering one
of these questions, Jackson said that
"pulling out of South Africa would ac
celerate its government's efforts to
create equality in the country."
Gann stressed that industry had
helped create more skilled jobs for
blacks in South Africa and that "the
present arms embargo, which has had
its lapses, has been effective."
