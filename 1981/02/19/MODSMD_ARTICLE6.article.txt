## Nkomo loses ground after recent rout in Zimbabwe 
### Los Angeles Times 
Salisbury, Zimbabwe —
Prime Minister Robert
Mugabe, in putting down last
week's small-scale but bloody
mutiny within the Zimbabwe
army, used the occasion to
further erode the political in
fluence of his disgruntled rival,
Joshua Nkomo.
Another significant result of
the revolt was to brighten even
more the image of Emmerson
Munangagwa, who has risen
during the first year of the
Mugabe government to control
the armed services an the in
telligence services.
Mugabe gave the orders last
week, but he left their im
plementation to Munangagwa,
who is sometimes referred to as
"iron-fisted" even by the prime
minister. And it was
Munangagwa who decided that
the mutiny called for bringing in
white-officered black troops for
the first time since Mugabe took
office.
At the time of the decision,
Nkomo's armed supporters
were on the march and defying
authority in five locations
around Bulawayo, the country's
second-largest city.
Nkomo. an old-line black na
tionalist npw in his 60s, has been
gradually losing his political
clout in the Mugabe coalition
government, for his support in
the Ndebele tribe is centered in
western Zimbabwe. Mugabe's
Shona tribe is much larger and
spread over most of the re
mainder of the country.
In a recent Cabinet reshuffle.
• Nkomo was moved from min
ister of home affairs, which in
cludes control of the police, and
the post was given to Mugabe
confidant, Richard Hove.
Nkomo ended up in the empty
job of minister without
portfolio.
Foreign diplomats believe
that Mugabe intends to weaken
Nkomo's political position even
further, thus making Zimbabwe
effectively a one-party state,
which it pretty much is already.
Media control
To consolidate its control, the
Mugabe government has used
its ownership of radio and TV,
Inherited from the previous
white government, to almost
eliminate favorable broadcast
mention of Nkomo and his politi
cal party, now known as the Pa
triotic Front.
The troops called out to re
store order in last week's fight
ing were the former Rhodesian
African Rifles — a unit that had
fought for the white government
during the seven-year conflict
with the guerrillas of Mugabe
and Nkomo. Although inte
grated into Zimbabwe's new na
tional army, soliders of the
African Rifles received little re
spect from the guerrillas who
were also being put into the new
army.
Yet when it came to putting
down the rebellion,
Munangagwa used the old "ene
' my" unit and, under its white

junior officers, the former
African Rifles ruthlessly did
their job.
One of its officers is William
Fleetwood, a former U.S. Army
ranger from Mill City. Ore.
"The fighting was like old
times," Fleetwood said.
About 200 people, including
some civilians, were killed dur
ing the brief rebellion and its
suppression. Nkomo's
adherents suffered most in the
outbreak, but the casualty total
cannot be exact because the
Nkomo guerrillas dragged away
and privately buried some of
their dead — a guerrilla tactic to
disguise losses.
Cease-fire
In the cease-fire arranged
Friday, representatives of
Nkomo and Mugabe accepted
the need to reduce friction
caused by historic tribal dif
ferences. For a time, guerrillas
loyal to each leader who pres
ently were incorporated into the
same national army units will
be kept apart.
Troop movements to achieve
their separation were com
pleted Monday when guerrilla
supporters of Nkomo were
trucked from Bulawayo to tem
porary quarters at an army
shooting range 18 miles away.

The Mugabe guerrillas were
moved to a similar installation
on Sunday.
The Nkomo group refused at
first to move because
Munangagwa insisted that both
sides be disarmed before trav
eling, as a further precaution
against new troubles starting.
They finally agreed to give up
their weapons save for a few
that Mugabe conceded that they
could keep 'for self defense."
Munangagwa, despite his rep
utation for toughness, displays
no signs of it. He is a quiet
speaking 37-year-old lawyer,
who became close to Mugabe
during the guerrilla fighting
against white rule.
As head of Zimbabwe's joint
high command, he deals with
the commanders of all three of
the major military forces in
volved in the war of liberation
that led to independence from
Britain and majority black rule
a year ago.
Munangagwa's appointment
means that Mugabe now con
trols the integrated 11,000-man
national army. He was planning
to increase its size to 35,000 men
as an integrated force, but be
cause of last week's disruptive
fighting the plans for growth
have had to be shelved.
