# Nuclear power plant causes furor in West Germany
## Helmut Schmidt's 'fuzzy' energy policy is at stake as Bonn rethinks the rules 
### Washington Post 
Bonn, West Germany — At a distant
spot on the marshy meadows of the Elbe
River in northern West Germany, set
beside a lighthouse and grazing cows,
are the beginnings of a 1.4 million kilo
watt nuclear power plant that so far has
generated nothing except controversy.
A specially dug moat, reinforced by a
metal fence crowned with barbed wire,
encircles the 75-acre area near the one
pub village of Brokdorf where Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt — along with the
pro-growth forces of West German busi
ness and industry — would like to see the
$1.25 billion project completed.
But the moat and fence testify to the
fierce tempers and violent protest that
the atomic plant has drawn.
In the midst of a recession that can be
traced in large part to the sharply higher
price of oil imports, opposition to nucle
ar power here might have have been ex
pected to diminish. Yet in a decision that
piled political embarrassment for
Schmidt on top of deep frustration for
Bonn's energy program, the Hamburg
city senate decided last week to postpone
construction of the project for another
three years.
Alternatives
While the Hamburg action may even
tually be circumvented by alternative fi
nancial or political means, it represents
a sharp rebuff to the Bonn government's
hopes of reducing dependency on im
ported energy through the limited build
ing of nuclear power plants.
Moreover, it suggests that Bonn's

energy policy — rather fuzzily
articulated at the national level lately —
may not be pushed through coherently at
the local level. This has revived doubts
about West Germany's ability to wean
itself from oil.
The increased cost of oil from nations
of the Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries has contributed to
Bonn's balance of payments deficit
which, in turn, has weakened the
Deutschemark and prompted the central
bank to keep interest rates relatively
high to draw capital. But high interest
rates have contributed to the slowing of
an already-weakened economy.
Despite the evident economic urgency
of cutting oil imports, nuclear power
continues to run into determined re
sistance from a politically sophisticated
corps of environmental groups,
bolstered by legions of farmers in the ru
ral areas where a number of the new
atomic projects are to be located.
Complicating the West German nucle
ar story is a complex licensing system in
volving a bureaucratic web of state and
federal agencies whose rulings are
challengeable in the courts.
West Germany has 14 nuclear power
plants in operation, providing 3.6 percent
of the country's primary energy needs.
Another 10 are awaiting a construction
permit; some have been waiting more
than five years.
Competitive edge
Aside from the billions of dollars al
ready invested in the blocked plants, the
West German nuclear industry is fearful

of losing its international competitive
edge — not least of all to the neighboring
French, who have pursued an ambitious
atomic development program with rela
tively little interference.
The chief responsibility for inaction on
nuclear energy rests with the Bonn gov
erning coalition. The partner Social
Democrats and Free Democrats both in
clude influential antinuclear factions
that have inhibited the government from
setting atomic power as a clear priority.
Although Schmidt is known to favor
strongly the development of atomic
power, he was moved to moderate his
personal position in last November's pol
icy declaration setting forth his govern
ment's aims for the next four years.
Nevertheless, it had been hoped by the
leadership in Bonn that positive action on
the Brokdorf plant would break the log
jam. Instead, the project has become a
bone of contention within Schmidt's So
cial Democratic Party, aggravating an
already-serious rift.
Occupation
Brokdorf is accustomed to conflict.
When construction on the project began
in October 1976, demonstrators tried to
occupy the site in what became one of the
biggest and most violent antinuclear
confrontations in the movement's ex
perience. In February 1977, building ac
tivity was halted by an administrative
court pending fulfillment of certain con
ditions — among them, further provision
for disposal of nuclear wastes.
With those conditions since fulfilled,
the Hamburg senate reconsidered the
project — which is owned jointly by the
city's electricity works and by Nor
dwestdeutsche Kraftwerke, a subsidiary
of Veba, West Germany's largest com
pany.
Mayor Hans Ulrich defied Schmidt,
who is also from Hamburg and a member

of the same party, by opposing develop
ment of the Brokdorf plant. Ulrich
argued that his city, which already
draws 30 percent of its energy from
atomic plants, would become too depen
dent on nuclear power.
Faced by this show of rebel strength,
the national party leadership mustered a
weak response last week. It reiterated
the party's energy policy that placed
energy-saving measures and greater use
of coal above the development of atomic
energy.
The Christian Democrats, who rule in
the state of Schleswig-Holstein where
the Brokdorf plant is to be built, have
committed themselves to the project and
may yet find a way of proceeding without
Hamburg.
While seemingly paralyzed for the mo
ment on the nuclear question, the Bonn
government provides a stream of details
on measures taken in recent years to
curb oil consumption in other ways. West
Germany is said to have been the first
Western country to draft a coordinated
energy program, in 1973. It was updated
in 1977.
West Germany has adopted energy
saving incentives, boosted the use of coal
— the country's major domestic energy
source — in power stations and en
couraged industry to produce fuel-saving
vehicles. The percentage of West Ger
man energy consumption drawn from oil
dropped from 55 percent in 1973 to 48 per
cent last year, although dependence on
crude from the Middle East actually rose
last year to 44 percent from 41 percent.
What troubles the Bonn leaders is
knowing they will be judged not by what
has been done, but by the size of the prob
lem that remains.
