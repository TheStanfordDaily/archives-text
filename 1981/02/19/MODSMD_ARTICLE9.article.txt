# Saudi oil cash poses dilemma

Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (AP) â€”
Earning $320 million a day from
oil, Saudi Arabia is in a headlong
rush to build a modern nation
before its wells run dry.
But the boom has posed a ma
jor dilemma for the rulers of the
desert kingdom of about 7 mil
lion people: how to absorb the
fast-paced change while pre
serving the traditional Islamic
lifestyle. Islamic religious law
is the common law of the land.
To some experts the develop
ment is reminiscent of the crash
modernization that contributed
to the downfall of Shah Moham
mad Reza Pahlavi in nearby
Iran.
Saudi officials, determined
not to make the same mistake,
appear to be pondering whether
to slow the pace of development
and cut back the daily produc
tion of oil, currently at 10.3 mil
lion barrels.
"Definitely, what has taken
place in the last 10 years has
changed Saudi society to the
point where there is confusion in
the minds of many as to where
we are going," Mahmoud Safar,
a U.S.-trained deputy minister
of higher education, said in an
interview here.
"We are not forced to produce
oil. We can slow down and at the
same time honor our obligation
to the rest of the world," he
added. "We don't want to rush
development to the point where
we lose our people."
The government has al
located an estimated $200 billion
for building hospitals, schools,
industries, airports, roads and
other projects in the next five
years. Even so, Western
diplomats say, Saudi Arabia is
earning $2 billion more a month
than it is able to spend.
Exposure to foreigners and
their customs, as well as the
seduction of Western gadgets, is
the concern of a growing
number of Saudis.
Safar noted that 30,000 Saudi
students are enrolled in schools
in the United States and
Western Europe and he said the
government feared some would
pick up Western habits not in
keeping with the Islamic re
ligion.
A Saudi businessman from
Jedda, who declined to be iden
tified, said he was concerned
about the number of young men
taken from small villages and
desert tribes for military train
ing.
Some observers believe that
Saudi Arabia will become in
creasingly torn by tensions be
tween the religious conserva
tives and more secular-minded
technocrats and military men.
They believe this could make
the kingdom the next flashpoint
after Iran.
But Saudi officials maintain
that King Khaled and the royal
family have established close
ties with the religious hierarchy
and the possibility of such revo
lutionary upheaval is remote.
