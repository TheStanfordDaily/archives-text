# McGovern speaks out against 'right wing zeal' politicking
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
The Moral Majority and other single issue political
groups represent "an emotionalism which is substituted
tor reason and common sense in public discussion and
which undermines the democratic process," George Mc-
Govern told an overflow audience of 600 in Annenberg
Auditorium last night.
The former South Dakota senator said he is concerned
about "the force with which irrational, unreasonable and
simplistic right-wing groups have been operating. The fa
voritism and right-wing zeal (that such groups display > is
unsettling to our political system "
McGovern, one of several liberal senators targeted for
defeat in the 1980 elections by right-wing efforts, main
tained he is not bitter about his loss to Republican James
Abnor and said "what single issue groups did < in the 1980
elections) was to control the dialogue in political dis
cussions."
Instead of facing questions on inflation and foreign poli
cy. the 1972 presidential candidate would "enter an
auditorium and face questions on killing babies and selling
out to the Russians and giving our canal to the Com
munists The dialogue was poisoned.
"I don't regret being out of the senate. 1 worry about
how we get back to the real issue of campaigns which are
dominated by single-issue bigots.'' added the current
Northwestern University professor.
McGovern cited the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty
(SALT II) and the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as
two issues distorted by right-wing groups Referring to
right wing opposition to the ERA, McGovern said. "One
wonders how reasonable people, 200 years alter our coun
try's birth, maintain that we should deny an amendment to

safeguard the rights of the more than 50 percent of our
citizens who happen to be women
During a 50-minute speech, interrupted frequently by
applause, the 59-year-old former legislator also com
mented on the increasing importance of evangelical politi
cal efforts. Although McGovern, son of an evangelical
minister, said he thought evangelism was a time honored
tradition in America, he questioned the efforts of the Mor
al Majority and other televised religious movements,
saving. My father never taught me God was a right-wing
reactionary
He added that he was concerned because some tele
vision groups, including the Moral Majority headed by
Jerry Falwell. "are using a great base to advocate very
narrow, if not political, doctrine that has no biblical back
ground."
Paid $2500 by the Stanford Committee on Political
Education and Stanford Speakers' Bureau. McGovern in
terlaced his speech with Biblical quotes and discussed the
congressional moral rating system used by politically-ori
ented evangelical groups. A congressperson got marked
down 10 points for opposing the Department of Education
1 don't know what part of the Old Testament they got that
out of
"In a nutshell what they are equating with morality is
right-wing extremism It should come as no surprise that I
got zero and that Hep. Telley of Florida of ABSCAM fame
got 100 percent rating, said McGovern
McGovern quoted numerous evangelical speeches, in
cluding several made at a Dallas convention of these re
ligious groups

George McGovern spoke about single party politics last night at Annenberg Auditorium.
Although he said he is not opposed to
Billy Graham, McGovern said the ten
dency of many evangelical groups to
see issues in simplistic terms makes
the Moral Majority a menace," and
warned audience members not "to
confuse the doctrine of the new right
with the doctrine of the New Testa
ment."
In response to issue confusion by
right-wing groups, McGovern or
ganized Americans for Common
Sense, a political activist group. He
explained the group's inception. "I de
cided last summer when I thought I
might win the election to form a group
to search for better answers than
those offered by right-wing groups.
We will search for common-sense an
swers to such problems as inflation;
alternate dependable, sources of
energy; a more rational foreign poli
cy, and a meaningful way to deal with
crime. 1 find more people today are
worried about getting hit on the street
than getting hit by the Russians."
Fielding questions from the au
dience, McGovern said he is opposed
to U.S. military aid to El Salvador and
noted that the ambiguousness in that
country 's situation represented an un
certainty present in Vietnam. The
three-term senator mentioned Walter
Mondale, Sen. Edward Kennedy, and
Gov. Jerry Brown as possible 1984
presidential candidates.
McGovern commented on his 1972
loss to Richard Nixon, saying "I would
much rather be here as loser than
switch places with the 1972 winner."
McGovern postponed judgment on
President Ronald Reagan's adminis
tration and budget cuts. "Republican
policy should be given a chance. If
nothing else (the change in adminis
tration ) will clear the air," he said.
McGovern received two standing
ovations.

dency of many evangelical groups to
see issues in simplistic terms makes
the Moral Majority a menace," and
warned audience members not "to
confuse the doctrine of the new right
with the doctrine of the New Testa
ment."
In response to issue confusion by
right-wing groups, McGovern or
ganized Americans for Common
Sense, a political activist group. He
explained the group's inception. "I de
cided last summer when I thought I
might win the election to form a group
to search for better answers than
those offered by right-wing groups.
We will search for common-sense an
swers to such problems as inflation;
alternate dependable, sources of
energy; a more rational foreign poli
cy, and a meaningful way to deal with
crime. 1 find more people today are
worried about getting hit on the street
than getting hit by the Russians."
Fielding questions from the au
dience, McGovern said he is opposed
to U.S. military aid to El Salvador and
noted that the ambiguousness in that
country 's situation represented an un
certainty present in Vietnam. The
three-term senator mentioned Walter
Mondale, Sen. Edward Kennedy, and
Gov. Jerry Brown as possible 1984
presidential candidates.
McGovern commented on his 1972
loss to Richard Nixon, saying "I would
much rather be here as loser than
switch places with the 1972 winner."
McGovern postponed judgment on
President Ronald Reagan's adminis
tration and budget cuts. "Republican
policy should be given a chance. If
nothing else (the change in adminis
tration ) will clear the air," he said.
McGovern received two standing
ovations.
The Moral Majority and other single issue political
groups represent "an emotionalism which is substituted
tor reason and common sense in public discussion and
which undermines the democratic process," George Mc-
Govern told an overflow audience of 600 in Annenberg
Auditorium last night.
The former South Dakota senator said he is concerned
about "the force with which irrational, unreasonable and
simplistic right-wing groups have been operating. The fa
voritism and right-wing zeal (that such groups display > is
unsettling to our political system "
McGovern, one of several liberal senators targeted for
defeat in the 1980 elections by right-wing efforts, main
tained he is not bitter about his loss to Republican James
Abnor and said "what single issue groups did < in the 1980
elections) was to control the dialogue in political dis
cussions."
Instead of facing questions on inflation and foreign poli
cy. the 1972 presidential candidate would "enter an
auditorium and face questions on killing babies and selling
out to the Russians and giving our canal to the Com
munists The dialogue was poisoned.
"I don't regret being out of the senate. 1 worry about
how we get back to the real issue of campaigns which are
dominated by single-issue bigots.'' added the current
Northwestern University professor.
McGovern cited the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty
(SALT II) and the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) as
two issues distorted by right-wing groups Referring to
right wing opposition to the ERA, McGovern said. "One
wonders how reasonable people, 200 years alter our coun
try's birth, maintain that we should deny an amendment to

safeguard the rights of the more than 50 percent of our
citizens who happen to be women
During a 50-minute speech, interrupted frequently by
applause, the 59-year-old former legislator also com
mented on the increasing importance of evangelical politi
cal efforts. Although McGovern, son of an evangelical
minister, said he thought evangelism was a time honored
tradition in America, he questioned the efforts of the Mor
al Majority and other televised religious movements,
saving. My father never taught me God was a right-wing
reactionary
He added that he was concerned because some tele
vision groups, including the Moral Majority headed by
Jerry Falwell. "are using a great base to advocate very
narrow, if not political, doctrine that has no biblical back
ground."
Paid $2500 by the Stanford Committee on Political
Education and Stanford Speakers' Bureau. McGovern in
terlaced his speech with Biblical quotes and discussed the
congressional moral rating system used by politically-ori
ented evangelical groups. A congressperson got marked
down 10 points for opposing the Department of Education
1 don't know what part of the Old Testament they got that
out of
"In a nutshell what they are equating with morality is
right-wing extremism It should come as no surprise that I
got zero and that Hep. Telley of Florida of ABSCAM fame
got 100 percent rating, said McGovern
McGovern quoted numerous evangelical speeches, in
cluding several made at a Dallas convention of these re
ligious groups
