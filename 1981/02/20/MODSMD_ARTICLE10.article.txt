# Soviet press attacks on Reagan harshen

Moscow (AP) — Official Sovi
et press attacks on the new Rea
gan administration have come
more quickly and been harsher
and more personal than
criticism of other recent Ameri
can presidents.
While the Soviet news media
tried to make the best of the ear
ly statements of Richard Nixon,
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter,
official commentators have
been quick to attack Ronald
Reagan from the first moments
of his presidency.
The press treatment appears
to be a sign that Kremlin lead
ers see no prospect for early im
provement in U.S. ties, which
went sour over the crisis in Po
land, Soviet intervention in Af
ghanistan and the stalled
Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks.
In the first month of Reagan's
presidency, Soviet media have
accused his administration of
"political incompetence,"
"malicious libel," "playing a
dangerous game . . . with lies
and hypocrisy" and "indulging
in philosophical discussions
from the Middle Ages."
A review of the record shows
Kremlin leaders welcomed Nix
on's inaugural "expressions

concerning peace" in 1969, de
scribed Ford as a balanced,
calm and confident person in
1974, and described Carter's
first presidential utterances in
1977 as "heartening."
Despite their initial courtesy,
the Soviet press eventually
found reason to criticize all
three administrations.
These criticisms concen
trated on nuclear weapons con
trol, which Soviet propagan
dists said was hampered by
"militaristic circles in the Unit
ed States." Nearly as sensitive
was the issue of human rights in
the Soviet Union, a cause cham
pioned by Carter early in his ad
ministration.
Soviet commentators also at
tacked U.S. attempts to gain
more influence in Western Eu
rope and the developing world,
actions the Kremlin called an
American drive for world domi
nation.
In 1969, Soviet leaders, eager
for detente, let it be known they
had adopted a "wait and see at
titude" to incoming President
Nixon, well remembered in the
Kremlin for his tough anti-com
munist stand from the Cold War
era of the 1950s and 19605.
