Moscow â€” Soviet authorities
have seized a Kharkov psy
chiatrist who helped defend dis
sidents incarcerated in Soviet
mental hospitals because of
their political views, unofficial
sources have reported.
Dr. Anatoli-Koryagin, 42, was
arrested Feb.l3 while en route
by train from Kharkov to Mos
cow, dissidents said. In mid-
January, Koryagin met two
Western correspondents in
Kharkov to discuss his work for
an unofficial commission in
vestigating the use of
psychiatry for political
purposes in the Soviet Union,
virtually all of the commission
members have been jailed in the
past year.
During those interviews, he
reiterated an earlier written
statement that mining engineer
Alexei Nikitin, who was sent to

a Dnieprpetrovsk mental hospi
tal after talking with correspon
dents of The Washington Post
and another Western news
paper, was "totally healthy."
Dissidents said Koryagin's
arrest may be linked to the fact
that he had openly questioned
the confinement to mental hos-
Eitals of Nikitin, who already
ad spent seven of the past 10
years undergoing forced psy
chiatric treatment and im
prisonment. Nikitin was ex
pelled from the Communist
Party in 1969 and fired from his
job at the Butovka mine in 1970
after protesting work and safety
conditions.
Koryagin's whereabouts are
unknown.
Meanwhile, it was learned
that Vasili Baratz, another dis
sident activist, was seized
Thursday and taken to a Mos
cow mental hospital for un
specified reasons.
