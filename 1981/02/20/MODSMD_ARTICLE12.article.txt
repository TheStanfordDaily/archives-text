# 'Some finger painters can do just as well' Art Museum's tour prompts mixed reactions
## 
### Richard Klingler 
"There are some finger-pain
ters that do just as well," ob
jected one of the 25 people on the
weekly Stanford Art Museum
special tour, referring to Jack
Tworkov's painting, "Changes
on a Wednesday No 1" and Step
han Greene's "Altar."
Marilyn Fogel, the art
museum docent leading the
Tuesday lunch-hour tour,
"Changing Purposes of Art in
the 20th Century," listened,
smiled politely, and described
how Greene's piece was ab
stract without being ex
pressionistic.
Works in the 20th century gal
lery prompted reactions that
varied from deprecation to
awestricken praise, with one
older woman turning to her
companion to say, "That disk
(Robert Irwin's suspended
sculpture, "Untitled") is ex
quisite, simply terrific."
The last in the weekly gallery
tours until April, the tour of the
20th century gallery was part of
the educational program of the
Stanford Art Museum.
Fogel said that the distinctive
feature of 20th century art is
that "the artist's concern is not
with the visible; it is with his in

ner state." Behind her,
Tworkov's work of broad, angry
red slashed on a large, dark can
vas bore eloquent testimony to
the docent's words.
Using Pablo Picasso's "The
Painter at Work" as an exam
ple, Fogel showed how the artist
nas designated his own point of
view to be the central part of his
work. In the pieces, Picasso "
. . . has shown a record of the
painting process.''
Art in the 20th century draws
much of its strength from this
new conception of the im
portance of the artist, said
Fogel. In modern art, self-ex
pression becomes all-impor
tant; "the artist is not con
cerned with creating a work
that can be judged by measuring
it against reality."
The artist's subject has
changed so drastically in the
past century that color and in
teractions between colors are
now themselves often the sub
ject of a work Fogel used Jules
Olitki's "Almirante Green," a
huge painting of greens and
purples sprayed or rolled onto
the canvas, to illustrate new
uses of technology, color-field
painting, and the "removal of
painting from drawing."
Light, as well as color, is a

principal element of modern
art. Fogel suggested that Dew
ain Valentine's "Double Pyra
mid," a translucent, purple,
crystal-shaped sculpture of
poured resin, played with the
qualities and reflection of light.
Many of the works dwarfed
the docent, who said that the
large scale "allows the artist to
create a total environment"
that dominates the observer's
field of vision.
Throughout the hour-long
tour, Fogel asked questions of
the mostly late middle-aged,
predominantly female group to
elicit their observations of the
peculiarities of 20th century art.
Although some members of
the group were clearly baffled
by the confrontation with the
painting of their age, Fogel re
marked that their generally
sympathetic reaction would
have been impossible in the
19405, for example.
Part of the ambivalent reac
tion to the art of the past 80
years stems from art's de
parture from portraying the
concrete. This is also the great
promise of modern art, accord
ing to Foqel: "20th century art
has enabled artists to find ways
to portray things that are in
tangible."
