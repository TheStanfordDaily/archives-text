## Nick Burbules Haig's statement cynical

•j
v"lnternational terrorism will take the place of
hitman rights in our concern because it is the ul
timate abuse of human rights. "
— Alexander Haig, The Nation, Feb. 14
The cynicism and hypocrisy of statements like
Haig's are typical of the early foreign policy pro
nouncements of the Reagan administration. Peo
ple with a sincere desire to promote human rights
and to oppose senseless violence should not be
misled by its apparent humanism.
First, the Reagan administration's use of the
term "terrorism" extends only to the acts of revo
lutionary groups or the Soviet Union. It does not
apply to the actions of governments friendly to the
U.S. Witness the sudden increase in support for
the junta in El Salvador, despite overwhelming
evidence that it has tolerated and overlooked (if
not directly ordered) acts of terror and repres
sion. The same can be said of the governments of
South Africa. Argentina, South Korea, the Philip
pines, and other nations.
Second, "terrorism" applies to left-wing
groups, but not to right-wing groups. In part, this
distinction overlaps with the first. But when ex
tremist groups on the right use terrorists tactics,
as does the KKK, or the Cuban expatriates in Mi
ami, the administration is strangely silent.
Third, "terrorism" is presumed to exist
elsewhere, but not here in the U.S. The murder of
black children in Atlanta has received no official
condemnation to compare with, for example, the
administration's public outrage against Iranian
"hoodlums." Although there is no more vicious
act of terror than the systematic killing of chil
dren, stands in favor of the "human rights" of mi
norities are not familiar to Reagan or his cohorts.
Just imagine what would happen if white children
were being killed!
Nor are the violent assault and rape of women
regarded as instances of terrorism. Yet such acts
are increasingly frequent, and many women live
in perpetual terror. These outrages do not fall
within the scope of the administration's concern
with "terrorism" and "human rights."
Fourth, "terrorism" is distinguished from "le

gitimate" acts of war. The actions of the U.S. in
Vietnam, whatever the extent of their savagery,
would not be considered terrorist because we
were at war. Revolution is also a war, if between
classes, and not between nations: yet when popu
lar insurgents, poorly armed and desperate, deto
nate a bomb in a public place, it is regarded as
morally distinguishable from dropping a bomb
from dropping a bomb from an expensive plane.
Which is "terrorist?"
Fifth, and finally, there is the matter of whom
"terrorism" affects. Where it affects the poor,
the powerless, and the silent, it is beneath public
notice and outrage. Where it affects the wealthy,
the secure, and the influential, it is intolerable.
This factor can be seen at work behind each of the
other four, and it appears to be the true message
of Haig's statement.
The only human rights that the administration
is really concerned with are those of our own
citizens (not even all of them, apparently) and of
those groups in other countries who promote U.S.
interests or. more precisely. U.S. capitalist in
terests. Terrorism is what the lurking forces of
anarchy do to "our"' people. The government
plainly uses the label "terrorist" as a tool of polit
ical propaganda: our enemies use terroist tac
tics; our allies do not. An even-handed and hu
mane conern with "human rights" would con
demn right-wing terroism, repressive violence,
and brutal acts of war with equal concern. But you
will find none of this concern in the Reagan ad
ministration's position.
Ultimately it must be asked if revolutionary
"terrorism" is ever justified Because it is fre
quently the only act of resistance available to op
pressed groups, a flat-out stand against such
forms of violence puts a great advantage in the
hands of those who can afford "cleaner" forms of
massacre (such as the neutron bomb). Yet the
final service to human rights can only be paid by
making humans free from repression, poverty,
and the threat of violence. Are there "non-ter
rorist" ways of achieving such a revolution?
