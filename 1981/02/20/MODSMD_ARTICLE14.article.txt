## No 'glorious' issues to protest 
### 
What ever happened to the
good old days? The days when
riots were just fun with the
gang. What ever happened to the
causes we could really protest?
What ever happened to ignoring
the establishment? Has the in
evitable occurred? Are we pris
oners in a twilight zone with
nothing grand and glorious to
protest?
Somehow the whales just
don't measure up to Vietnam.
Somehow shaking fists at the
mighty bastion of nuclear pro
liferation and third world coun
try oppression, the nuclear
power plant, doesn't have the
impact of protesting racial seg
regation.
What's the alternative? Do
we protest? Do we find an issue
or fabricate one? Doesn't it
seem that somehow we missed
the boat of great causes?
Loss of punch
UC-Berkeley, the bastion of
ideology in the '60s. has some
how lost its powerful punch of
liberal thoughts and active pro
tests. The underground papers
are faltering and dying for lack
of readership. So what direction
is there to turn?
The light at the end of the
great cause gap is fast ap
proaching. Could the good old
days of anti-establishment be
returning with the return of
moral majority? Could Ronald
Reagan father a new generation
of beatniks? Could Alexander
Haig bring back protests
against the oppression and ex
ploitation of Third World na
tions? Will Mao's widow's con
viction ignite the torch of de
mocracy and human rights pro
tests?
Possibly . . . Soon, we too
may be able to share in the trad
ition of our precursors, a good
cause to protest. But, in the iter
im, a few good causes are in or
,oer. So, pack up the whales,
your nukes, your anti-regis
-tration pin, and let's find a few
IJreat causes to fill the great
cause gap.
!- Remember there will only be
!wars as long as mankind is evil.
There will only be wars as long
as mankind oppresses his fellow
brothers and sisters. There will

only be war as long as man rec
ognizes the dark side of the
Force!
Death to transcripts
Wasted lives, wasted souls, a
floating derelict of what once
was. The life of a pre-med, bar
ren. neglected, forgotten, long
oppressed by the establishment.
Freedom! Let the cry of free
dom ring! All pre-meds will be
liberated from the capitalist op
pression that chains them to
their classes. Death to the tran
script.
Rodin. Calder, Poncet,
Moore, Albers: their work
stands unprotected from the
elements, susceptible to the evil
nemesis of sculpturekind. the
common pigeon. This insidious
beast, pervading the very es
sence of society is exterminat
ing the history and tradition of
Western thought and must be
eliminated. Let this be our bat
tle cry: "Save a statue, eat a
pigeon!"
Death to smokers. Gently and
quietly tell smokers blowing un
breathable secondary smoke
into your lungs to daintily extin
guish their smoking mateirals.
If not, force them to ingest a Mi
das muffler connected to a Pin
to.
Immoral minority
Stand up for the oppressed
Immoral Minority. The long op
pressed and frequently non-vo
cal facet of American society is
now displaced from a gov
ernmental influence. Fight
back, the immoral minority can
live. The immoral minority can
affect you. Support it with a
hearty contribution.
Feeling alone and depressed
because you are the only
pimpleless adolescent? Dispel
the useless fear and ap
prehension. Pimples can be
yours. Work for them. Enjoy
Stanford, work hard, and soon
you too will join that popular
group and be welcomed as a
peer again.
The causes are self-evident
and as legitimate as any preva
lent today. So find your cause,
work for it. support it; there will
always be something to com
plain about and no matter what
the age, there will be someone

to complain. Remember that we
must complain to feel justified,
as Descartes wrote, "I com
plain. therefore I am."
And eternally remember, no
matter what fate and fortune
may dictate, to uphold the inte
grity of Our Precious Bodily
Fluids.
