## Libertarians overemphasize invisible fist 
### 
All this talk lately about dem
ocratic socialism has got me to
thinking: if the libertarians
keep calling us so many nasty
names, maybe we are on the
right track. We're both talking
about the same things: people
controlling their own lives, en
joying the fruits of their labor,
and treating each other with re
spect. decency, and cooperative
spirit. So why all the fuss?
Critical questions which de
mand resolution are: What are
the important decisions which
affect us? Who makes them?
How are they made? How can
we make sure that people get
some input and direction in
those decisions? How can we
distribute the decision-making
power so that good decisions
will be made, and people get
what they want?
My basic disagreement with
the libertarian position is that
they perceive a lack of basis for
"political" power; that the only
natural power is economic, and
that all other forms of influence
are coercive. Just let the in
visible fist take over, and ev
eryone will be happy. Right?
My own position is that power
is power. In a complex world in
dividual (libertarians use the
word "atomistic") decisions
often have very wide-ranging
effects. The best way to handle
the apparent contradiction in a
political democracy with a mar
ket economy is not by convert
ing to a Darwinistic political
system (as libertarians would
suggest) but rather by demo-

cratizing the economy as much
as possible.
Worker control and man
agement of production have
been in the news recently as
across the United States and Eu
rope workers and communities
have been faced with massive
layoffs, plant closings, and oth
er forms of economic disloca
tion. Employee-owned and con
trolled businesses have been
around for many years — in the
Pacific Northwest plywood
companies have been worker
owned since the 1920 s — but re
cent years have seen a re
surgence of such efforts.
Worker control has been de
fined in several ways, but pri
marily refers to participation in
decision-making through a vari
ety of democratic means, in
cluding election of directors,
sharing in the distribution of the
company's income, and worker
or community ownership of fa
cilities. Knowledge on which de
cisions are based is shared,
rather than remaining in the
hands of experts, and worker se
curity, health and safety are
valued along with profit and ef
ficiency.
Worker-controlled businesses
range from small retail and ser
vice firms to large-scale manu
facturing companies.
Control or ownership by those
most affected by the hiring and
firing of a business generally
means planning for the stability
of and responsibility to the com
munity at large. Worker control
can be seen as an aspect of corn-

munity self-determination. In
cases in which a large plant
closure would affect an entire
community, the community
itself has rallied behind the
workers. Along with worker and
community control comes a
commitment to social and po
litical change through the
elimination of exploitation of
subsidiary firms merely for cor
porate profit.
Among recent worker-control
events are campaigns to save
jobs in the steel industry in the
U.S. and in Europe. In Youngs
town. Ohio, workers and com
munity members have re
sponded to the closing of a steel
mill employing 5000 people, 12
percent of the regional labor
force, by developing a plan for
community/worker control. A
group of local religious leaders
has been central in efforts to
purchase the plant and in gener
ating nationwide support. Simi
lar activities are taking place in
North Wales, Great Britain,
France, and West Germany.
Workers and communities
are active in other industries as
well. In Vermont, employees
bought out a closing asbestos
mine and now share in man
agement. Mohawk Valley Com
munity Corporation in New
York formed to take over a li
brary furniture factory from
Sperry Rand. All over the Bay
Area workers are engaging in
cooperative self-management,
or communities have estab
lished cooperatives, in food,
publishing, media, retail, de-

livery. in all sorts of trades, in
cluding manufacturing.
These are just a few ex
amples of current efforts
toward worker control. They
must be seen in the context of
rising unemployment in de
veloped countries as large cor-.
porations and industries shift to",
more capital-intensive means of J
production or to cheaper labor
forces in other areas of the
world.
Worker-owned and worker
controlled companies must
coexist and compete with these
colonial corporations both in the*
marketplace and for govern- '
ment support. Reaganesque
subsidies in the forms of tax
breaks for direct financing cur
rently sustain business, and will
be cause for struggle between;
maintaining existing systems
and moving towards new ones
more concerned with stable em
ployment and useful production.
Along with difficulties in
herent in a change to worker and
community control come op-"
portunities for more fundamen
tal changes. Alliances among a
wide range of organizations
within a community are pos
sible. and necessary in some
cases for the capital formation
needed to sustain new or newly
acquired businesses. Local con
trol means different business
priorities. Economic health,"
provision of socially useful
goods and services, conserva
tion and attention to renewable
resources, and a pollution-free
environment become major
criteria in decision-making,
rather than externalities. It is
not simply the preservation of
jobs and profits, but also the
creation and maintenance of
new jobs which motivate work
ers to take control.
Finally, this is a slow process
that involves a sort of on-the-job
training in management. As
methods of democratic man
agement and the process and
direction for change becomes
clearer, so should the means for
achieving real worker and com
munity control. That the task of
progress is difficult should not
allow us to resort to tired old
forms of reactionary domi
nation as a means of economic
and political escapism. Now, in
the midst of crisis, is the time to
develop some real solutions.
