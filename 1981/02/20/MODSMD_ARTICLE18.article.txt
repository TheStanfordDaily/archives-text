Gann 'right'
I have followed with much in
terest the El Salvador debate
that has been going on for the
past few weeks between Lewis
Gann on the one hand, and his
many critics on the other. Gann
is obviously capable of defend
ing his views against all comers.
He is, however, unlikely to ob
ject a second time to malicious
attacks against his person. I
would therefore like to protest
the comments made in Peter Al
lum's letter, "Art for the
Masses" (Daily, Jan. 30).
In his first two paragraphs, an
attempt at satire, Allum
focuses on the substantive is
sues. In the final two para
graphs. he abandons satire and
becomes serious (as indicated
by the word "Seriously ... ").
From this point on, Allum in
dulges in a personal attack ev
ery bit as vicious as the ones
launched by those correspon
dents who opposed Gann in your
previous issues. Gann is ac
cused of having "a paranoid at
titude," "a narrow viewpoint."
and "perspectives ... irrelevant
and even offensive to human
dignity;" he is said to have
made "fantastic, simplistic,
and misguided comments," and
he allegedly has a preference
for regimes widely acknowl
edged to have murdered
thousands of their opponents.
What Gann actually said, just
to set the record straight, was
quite different. He argued that
no right-wing military regime,
however corrupt, has ever com
mitted anything equivalent to
the atrocities perpetrated by
communist tyrants. Gann did
not condone atrocities, either by
the left or by the right.
If those who do not agree with
Gann must resort to character
assassination, insults and mis
representations, in order to
combat his views, they should
not take pen in hand

Moral re-education
Maybe when Jerry Falwell
finishes with the homosexuals,
abortionists and feminists,
maybe, just maybe, he will ac
cuse ABC, NBC, and CBS of
heresy because they offer alter
native programming to his Na

tional Sunday Sermon.
Or perhaps he will indict
newspapers for publishing a
nondenominational Sunday edi
tion. Who's to say, perhaps
someday His Highness Jerry
will round up all the Jews -
(don't forget our own Japanese-
American citizens) and send
them to "Re-Education
Camps" to learn to quote scrip
ture.
Perhaps Anita Bryant, the
then Secretary of "Education"
will use the right of eminent do
main to condemn Stanford and
use it as one of these "camps."

Poetic validity
Judging from the numerous
irritated or puzzled voices in the
audience after the recent lec
ture by Hans-Georg Gadamer,
emeritus professor of philoso
phy at the University of
Heidelberg, one can judge that
most people accept his thesis
that the poem cannot be reduced
to any or all of the various ap
proaches — biography, psy
chology, conscious authorial in
tent, history, sociology, etc. —
and that indeed a poem is some
thing beyond all that can grow
with successive readings and
wider contexts. On the other
hand, the voices wanted us to be
lieve that the poem was not just
open to endless modifications,
but had a "solid" meaning not
only in the sense that Gadamer
allowed of conforming to cer
tain norms at a certain level of
its being, e.g., some verifiable
truths or falsehoods it contains.
No, the voices wanted to feel
that at the more artistic level
there was something stable and
meaningful about it.
I agree with them The way to
reconcile these two aims is to
pitch the full meaning off into a
sort of Edenic future — an ul
timate North Star of meaning —
which is no less objective for
being something which we can
only asymptomatically ap
proach along our groping
Adamic way. If that "far out"
truth weren't magnetically
there, I for one wouldn't bother
trying for years to understand
those difficult masterpieces
which keep tantalizing me
What would be the use if almost
any casual reading was just as
valid?
No, one knows intuitively that

a faithful reading is more valid
and keeps trying. Sometimes
one makes verifiable hits in the
E. D. Hirsh sense, in which the
public in time recognizes its su
periority, and some readings
have seemingly permanent val
ue.
Saul Bellow spoke in his
Nobel address of glimpsing
what is "simple and true" in lit
erature he loves (as opposed to
the emptier-than-thou struc
turalists or Robbe-Grillet et.
at.). I have no doubt that Pro
fessor Gadamer would agree
with this, judging from the
warm way he spoke about the
uniqueness of the poem, his fun
damental literariness, and his
imaginative affection for art.
But communication is not
always ideal in lecture circum
stances, and I hope these few re
marks will shed some useful
light.

'Low turnout'
I hope those considering the
question of union representation
read the article on "USE.
Bylaw Changes" (Daily, Feb.
12). Thirty two members voted
on the issues. That is 32 out of
1400 in the bargaining unit. One
of the bylaw changes was to low
er the quorum to 15 so that an
even smaller number can guide
the union. This low turnout has
been a problem of unions for
years. If you plan to vote for a
union, also plan to attend every
meeting for the rest of your stay
at Stanford or you will be repre
sentated by the same type of
leadership that has guided the
union since its beginnings at
Stanford.
If you want some knowl
edgeable opinions on the value
of U S E., ask most any machin
ist or sheet metal worker or
welder at SLAC.

I was pleased to read (Daily,
Feb. 11), that some members of
the Moral Majority are as sen
sible as Dean Wycoff, head of
the Santa Clara County chapter,
who believes that homosexuali

ty should be punishable by
death. While I often wonder why
anyone who does not know me
should have any interest what
soever in my personal life, I am
gratified to learn that Wycoff
finds it a matter of such great
concern. Imagine the honor of
being thought as important as
one of the nation's top crimi
nals! When the wish of the Mor
al Majority becomes law, at the
very least I shall have to start
running red lights and evading
my taxes. Think of how much
money I'll make selling the
movie rights to my auto
biography.

'Low turnout'
I hope those considering the
question of union representation
read the article on "USE.
Bylaw Changes" (Daily, Feb.
12). Thirty two members voted
on the issues. That is 32 out of
1400 in the bargaining unit. One
of the bylaw changes was to low
er the quorum to 15 so that an
even smaller number can guide
the union. This low turnout has
been a problem of unions for
years. If you plan to vote for a
union, also plan to attend every
meeting for the rest of your stay
at Stanford or you will be repre
sentated by the same type of
leadership that has guided the
union since its beginnings at
Stanford.
If you want some knowl
edgeable opinions on the value
of U S E., ask most any machin
ist or sheet metal worker or
welder at SLAC.

I was pleased to read (Daily,
Feb. 11), that some members of
the Moral Majority are as sen
sible as Dean Wycoff, head of
the Santa Clara County chapter,
who believes that homosexuali

ty should be punishable by
death. While I often wonder why
anyone who does not know me
should have any interest what
soever in my personal life, I am
gratified to learn that Wycoff
finds it a matter of such great
concern. Imagine the honor of
being thought as important as
one of the nation's top crimi
nals! When the wish of the Mor
al Majority becomes law, at the
very least I shall have to start
running red lights and evading
my taxes. Think of how much
money I'll make selling the
movie rights to my auto

Gann 'right'
I have followed with much in
terest the El Salvador debate
that has been going on for the
past few weeks between Lewis
Gann on the one hand, and his
many critics on the other. Gann
is obviously capable of defend
ing his views against all comers.
He is, however, unlikely to ob
ject a second time to malicious
attacks against his person. I
would therefore like to protest
the comments made in Peter Al
lum's letter, "Art for the
Masses" (Daily, Jan. 30).
In his first two paragraphs, an
attempt at satire, Allum
focuses on the substantive is
sues. In the final two para
graphs. he abandons satire and
becomes serious (as indicated
by the word "Seriously ... ").
From this point on, Allum in
dulges in a personal attack ev
ery bit as vicious as the ones
launched by those correspon
dents who opposed Gann in your
previous issues. Gann is ac
cused of having "a paranoid at
titude," "a narrow viewpoint."
and "perspectives ... irrelevant
and even offensive to human
dignity;" he is said to have
made "fantastic, simplistic,
and misguided comments," and
he allegedly has a preference
for regimes widely acknowl
edged to have murdered
thousands of their opponents.
What Gann actually said, just
to set the record straight, was
quite different. He argued that
no right-wing military regime,
however corrupt, has ever com
mitted anything equivalent to
the atrocities perpetrated by
communist tyrants. Gann did
not condone atrocities, either by
the left or by the right.
If those who do not agree with
Gann must resort to character
assassination, insults and mis
representations, in order to
combat his views, they should
not take pen in hand

Or perhaps he will indict

someday His Highness Jerry

Poetic validity
Judging from the numerous
irritated or puzzled voices in the
audience after the recent lec
ture by Hans-Georg Gadamer,
emeritus professor of philoso
phy at the University of
Heidelberg, one can judge that
most people accept his thesis
that the poem cannot be reduced
to any or all of the various ap
proaches — biography, psy
chology, conscious authorial in
tent, history, sociology, etc. —
and that indeed a poem is some
thing beyond all that can grow
with successive readings and
wider contexts. On the other
hand, the voices wanted us to be
lieve that the poem was not just
open to endless modifications,
but had a "solid" meaning not
only in the sense that Gadamer
allowed of conforming to cer
tain norms at a certain level of
its being, e.g., some verifiable
truths or falsehoods it contains.
No, the voices wanted to feel
that at the more artistic level
there was something stable and
meaningful about it.
I agree with them The way to
reconcile these two aims is to
pitch the full meaning off into a
sort of Edenic future — an ul
timate North Star of meaning —
which is no less objective for
being something which we can
only asymptomatically ap
proach along our groping
Adamic way. If that "far out"
