# Controversy results from tenure denials
## 
### Monika Guttman 
The issue of tenure at the University
is always a sensitive matter, and re
cent tenure denials have brought the
subject once more to the forefront.
Several junior faculty members
said they feel the University is taking
a harsher attitude towards granting
tenure than in the past, but adminis
trators and department chairmen de
nied that this is true
"I don't want to try to identify all
the criteria which they (the Univer
sity departments) used in evaluating
my position,' said Steven Strasnick,
an assistant professor in the Philoso
phy Department who was denied
tenure this year "It's hard to say;
there are a lot of possibilities."
But Strasnick said he felt that "dif
ferent criteria than in the past" are
being considered when a department
looks at the candidate's record.
"Before, according to the faculty
handbook. you had to be among the top
two or three in your field Also, if you
were a weak teacher, but there was
evidence that you could become a good
teacher, then the University was
much more likely to consider granting
you tenure than thev are now. "

At present. Strasnick maintains,
"The University is looking for ex
cellence in both You have to be the top
in your field, and a very good teacher
as well."
According to Peg Dickenson of the
Provost's office, however, "Univer
sity-wide standards haven't
changed "
"It's not tair to say the standards
are changing . . . and as far as I know,
the departmental processes haven't
changed either."
The process for tenure considera
tions has several steps. First, the de
partment gathers opinions from ex
perts in the candidate's field on the
qualifications, the expertise and the
renown of the candidate. Also, the
candidate's publications are con
sidered, along with evaluations by stu
dents, course evaluations in the .is'M '
('nurse (iuidc and letters of other fac
ulty members. All of these, are con
sidered by the department, which then
sends recommendations to the Dean
of Humanities and Sciences. There the
application is again reviewed, and
sent to the Provost's office A special
advisory board then considers the ap
plication. and. if approved, it goes to
the Provost and finally to the Board of

Trustees.
Noel Kolak. assistant to the prov
ost. said she is not aware ot any
change in the standards for approval
"We have always required that the
candidate be outstanding in one aspect
(publishing or teaching) and very,
very good in the other," she said.
Henry Levinson, an assistant pro
fessor in religious studies who was
also denied tenure this year, said he
felt that the situation has changed
over the past decade. He said that six
or seven years ago people probably
had a pretty good chance to be granted
tenure.
"In fact, the situation is now a good
deal Ynore like at Harvard or Yale . . .
that you will not get tenure. I'm not
making a judgment about whether this
is good or bad.' 1 ,.
But Vice Provost Gerald
Lieberman said that he felt policies
have been applied "even-handedly."
"I don't think policies have
changed." he said. "If anything, we
are more serious about the teaching
issue. But I have been evaluating
credentials for the last five years, and
I don't find any difference."
Several sources speculated that

there may be many different factors
which are making it more difficult for
young faculty members to be granted
tenure.
Prof. Van Austin Harvey, chairman
of the Religious Studies Department,
said that although the standards tor
granting tenure haven't changed,
ttiere is a question about whether you
can judge someone's qualifications
fairly in the first 112 ive'years after 'they
wrote their dissertation.
In the Humanities, that's a 1 airly
task-," he said
Other sources speculated that a
tighter job market is forcing Univer
sity departments to consider tenure
applications more carefully. Since
there are more applicants for fewer
positions across the nation, the Uni
versity may be more hesitant to grant
tenure in "borderline" cases than
they were a few years ago
Lieberman, however, said he felt
that "outstanding faculty continue to
get job offers from all over the place.
"But some areas probably are eas
ier to move around in, such as com
puter science or engineering," he ad
mitted "Shortage of positions is prob
ably to a great extent field-related "

"I don't want to try to identify all
the criteria which they (the Univer
sity departments) used in evaluating
my position,' said Steven Strasnick,
an assistant professor in the Philoso
phy Department who was denied
tenure this year "It's hard to say;
there are a lot of possibilities."
But Strasnick said he felt that "dif
ferent criteria than in the past" are
being considered when a department
looks at the candidate's record.
"Before, according to the faculty
handbook. you had to be among the top
two or three in your field Also, if you
were a weak teacher, but there was
evidence that you could become a good
teacher, then the University was
much more likely to consider granting
you tenure than thev are now. "

At present. Strasnick maintains,
"The University is looking for ex
cellence in both You have to be the top
in your field, and a very good teacher
as well."
According to Peg Dickenson of the
Provost's office, however, "Univer
sity-wide standards haven't
changed "
"It's not tair to say the standards
are changing . . . and as far as I know,
the departmental processes haven't
changed either."
The process for tenure considera
tions has several steps. First, the de
partment gathers opinions from ex
perts in the candidate's field on the
qualifications, the expertise and the
renown of the candidate. Also, the
candidate's publications are con
sidered, along with evaluations by stu
dents, course evaluations in the .is'M '
('nurse (iuidc and letters of other fac
ulty members. All of these, are con
sidered by the department, which then
sends recommendations to the Dean
of Humanities and Sciences. There the
application is again reviewed, and
sent to the Provost's office A special
advisory board then considers the ap
plication. and. if approved, it goes to
the Provost and finally to the Board of

Trustees.
Noel Kolak. assistant to the prov
ost. said she is not aware ot any
change in the standards for approval
"We have always required that the
candidate be outstanding in one aspect
(publishing or teaching) and very,
very good in the other," she said.
Henry Levinson, an assistant pro
fessor in religious studies who was
also denied tenure this year, said he
felt that the situation has changed
over the past decade. He said that six
or seven years ago people probably
had a pretty good chance to be granted
tenure.
"In fact, the situation is now a good
deal Ynore like at Harvard or Yale . . .
that you will not get tenure. I'm not
making a judgment about whether this
is good or bad.' 1 ,.
But Vice Provost Gerald
Lieberman said that he felt policies
have been applied "even-handedly."
"I don't think policies have
changed." he said. "If anything, we
are more serious about the teaching
issue. But I have been evaluating
credentials for the last five years, and
I don't find any difference."
Several sources speculated that

there may be many different factors
which are making it more difficult for
young faculty members to be granted
tenure.
Prof. Van Austin Harvey, chairman
of the Religious Studies Department,
said that although the standards tor
granting tenure haven't changed,
ttiere is a question about whether you
can judge someone's qualifications
fairly in the first 112 ive'years after 'they
wrote their dissertation.
In the Humanities, that's a 1 airly
task-," he said
Other sources speculated that a
tighter job market is forcing Univer
sity departments to consider tenure
applications more carefully. Since
there are more applicants for fewer
positions across the nation, the Uni
versity may be more hesitant to grant
tenure in "borderline" cases than
they were a few years ago
Lieberman, however, said he felt
that "outstanding faculty continue to
get job offers from all over the place.
"But some areas probably are eas
ier to move around in, such as com
puter science or engineering," he ad
mitted "Shortage of positions is prob
ably to a great extent field-related "
The issue of tenure at the University
is always a sensitive matter, and re
cent tenure denials have brought the
subject once more to the forefront.
Several junior faculty members
said they feel the University is taking
a harsher attitude towards granting
tenure than in the past, but adminis
trators and department chairmen de
