## Economic program Reagan plan called risky 
### Newsday 
Washington — President
Ronald Reagan in effect invited
Congress and the American peo
ple Wednesday to join him in a
gamble that cutting taxes will
wipe out deficits, and that infla
tion, which has resisted frontal
assaults, can be defeated by an
attack from the rear
He proposed largely untested
remedies that, if unsuccessful,
could cause bigger deficits and
worse inflation. He proposed ac
tions that would, in the short

ISeivs Analysis

run, increase the costs of hun
dreds of consumer items and
services, from travel to mailing
a letter to local taxes. He de
manded sacrifices that will
seem excessive if they do not
yield the results Reagan prom
ises. He proposed many cuts in
federal spending that may only
pressure state and local govern
ments to increase their own
spending and taxes by a like
amount.
He asked the public to believe
that the same market forces
that have made a jungle of the
energy business could ultimate
ly, if freed of government re
straints, solve most of the na

tion's energy problems. He pro
posed a $45-billion deficit for the
coming fiscal year, almost
twice the deficit proposed by his
predecessor. Jimmy Carter,
only months ago
But he said that the American
economy was in a crisis and that
faith in his plan would cut the in
flation rate to 5.5 percent, less
than half of the present level, by
the end of his term. He held out
the promise of a budget surplus
— the first since 1969 — bv 1984
The centerpiece of Reagan's
plan is his faith in the relatively
new concept of supply-side eco
nomics This theory assumes
that massive tax cuts of the kind
normally considered danger
ously inflationary can stimulate
American consumers to begin
increasing their savings.
If savings do increase, the
Reagan scenario goes, they will
be used by American business
and industry to modernize
plants and equipment to pro
duce more goods more cheaply

The economy then will expand
to the point at which revenues
lost in the tax cut will be made
up in new tax revenues gener
ated by the expansion, by more
people working and paying tax
es This expansion, so the theory
goes, also will offset the painful
effects of Reagan's budget cuts
on those individuals, businesses
and local governments most af
fected by them.
Reagan's critics have a dif
ferent scenario. They fear that
his tax cut will unleash a new
rush of consumer spending thai
will only drive up prices. They
also warn that it takes an act of
purest faith to believe the
budget can be balanced at the
same time revenues are being
cut and defense expenditures
are rising steeply. And if Rea
gan stumbles, the Federal Re
serve could be forced to in.%
stitute horrific credit and mone- 1
tary policies that could drive the>
economy into a blockbuster re
cession.
