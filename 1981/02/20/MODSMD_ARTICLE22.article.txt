# AFL-CIO moves toward political unification
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Miami Beach, Fla. â€” Unhappy with
the last two Democratic Party presiden
tial candidates, the AFL-CIO moved
Wednesday to try to unite its 101 af
filiated unions behind a single candidate
in future presidential primary elections.
"It's revolutionary. We've really
crossed the Rubicon on this issue at last,
and perhaps now we in labor won't have
to wait until the Democrats hand us a
presidential candidate and say, 'Take it
or leave it,' " said Alexander Barkan,
political director of the 13.5 million
member labor federation.
There was widespread unhappiness
among union leaders in 1972 when the
Democrats chose the unsuccessful Sen.
George McGovern (D-S.D.) as their
standard bearer, and the unionists had
little enthusiasm for former President
Jimmy Carter in 1976 and even less for
him in the 1980 campaign, although they
backed him officially in the general elec
tions.
In another revolutionary move, the
AFL-CIO called Tuesday for U.S. eco
nomic support for the government of a
Communist nation.
Solidarity spurs recognition
The unprecedented stand by the mili
tantly anti-Communist leaders of the 14-
million-member labor federation was
the result of the Polish government's
recognition of Solidarity, Poland's inde

pendent union movement.
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland
said that if the Polish government lives
up to the commitments it has made to
Solidarity, "It could have far-reaching
effects on the question of detente with all
Communist countries willing to allow the
existence of a free trade union move
ment."
A formal statement adopted unani
mously by the AFL-CIO executive coun
cil, said, "Because we share the aspira
tions of Poland's workers for a better life
and for an economic climate more con
ducive to Solidarity's success, the AFL
CIO is prepared to support an extension
of Western credits to Poland, but only un
der conditions that safeguard the rights
and interests of the workers ..."
Union in-fighting
In the past, unions in the AFL-CIO
often fought with one another as each
made its own endorsement of presiden
tial primary candidates, although they
usually managed to unite behind the
Democratic nominee for the general
election.
Kirkland named a 14-member com
mittee to work out details of the feder
ation's precedent-setting effort to in
volve itself directly in presidential pri
mary campaigns and in the politics of the
political parties themselves.
Kirkland insisted that the federation

would like to work within both the Demo
cratic and Republican parties.
"1 want to make it clear that we're not
talking about the Democratic Party
alone," he said, although he conceded
that until now the union has been prima
rily involved in the Democratic Party.
Barkan, who will retire this year after
16 years as the federation's political di
rector, was more blunt.
"As a practical matter, the Re
publicans don't want us in their opera
tions as a national party, although we do
work closely with some individual Re
publican candidates." he said.
Meany rejected involvement
Barkan has long advocated greater in
volvement by the AFL-CIO in the Demo
cratic Party, but that concept was
always rejected by the late George
Meany, president of the AFL-CIO from
1955 until his death last year.
Kirkland made the move to bring labor
into the primary election process as a
single force, and to make the Democrat
ic Party what he told the executive coun
cil could be "labor's party."
Kirkland contrasted this sharply with
the idea of labor having its own political
party, something he said could not work
because third parties could not work in
this country.
Kirkland said the federation does in
tend to maintain its independence and

not become a captive of either party,
"but I believe we have a right and the re
sponsibility ... to attempt to advance
(workers') interests within the party
structures."
Involvement started
While the AFL-CIO is officially still
studying the details of how to best
achieve its new political goals, it actual
ly has already started involving itself
directly in Democratic Party politics.
The federation, with direct partici
pation by Kirkland. helped lawyer
Charles Manatt win a preliminary vote
in his campaign to become the Demo
cratic national chairman.
The Democratic National Committee
will meet later this month and is ex
pected to elect Manatt. It will also select
25 at-large members of the 371-member
committee.
In sessions with Kirkland, Manatt and
other party leaders, the unions were as
sured that 13 of the new 25 at-large dele
gates would come from the AFL-CIO and
two would come from the independent
United Auto Workers.
Also, the party leader said, the AFL
CIO would get two more seats on the 32-
member executive committee of the
DNC, for a total of three. The UAW,
which has been active inside the Demo
cratic Party, already has two members
on the party's executive committee.
