### 
Ann Arbor, Mich. (AP) —
Marijuana use among high
school seniors appeared to drop
off in 1980 — the first decline in
20 years — but experimentation
with some harder drugs seems
to have risen, researchers at the
University of Michigan say.
And while American high
schools likely never will be
drug-free, the overall use of il
licit drugs apparently has
leveled off, according to a re
port released Wednesday by the
University's Institute for Social
Research.
"We still have a long way to
go before we return to anything
like the relatively drug-free
years of the '505," said Lloyd
Johnston, one of three social
psychologists who compiled the
report.
"In fact, it seems unlikely

that we ever will return to those
levels. But the dramatic rise
over the last two decades in
proportion of young people in
volved with illicit drugs appears
at or very near an end," he said."
The report was based on a
comparison of questionnaire re
sponses from nearly 17,000 sen
iors in the class of 1980 with sen
iors from previous classes.
There was no indication how
the students were chosen to re
ceive questionnaires or what the
margin of error was in
projecting the results.
The study by Johnston, Jerald
Bachman and Patrick O'Malley
revealed that in 1980. a larger
percentage of students than in
years past has at least ex
perimented with stimulants and
the sedative methaqualone, bet
ter known as Quaaludes. .**
