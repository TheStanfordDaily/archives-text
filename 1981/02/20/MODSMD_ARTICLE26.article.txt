## Cards shut out UOP 
### Ralph Walker 
The Stanford men's baseball
team, behind the shutout
pitching of freshman Gregg
Lomnicky, showed Tuesday in
their 8-0 win over UOP why they
may indeed be deserving of the
No. 5 national ranking they re
ceived last week.
"We're for real," stated
pitching coach Tom Dunton,
whose staff now has four
shutouts and an E R A. of well
under two for the season.
Pitching, however, is not
Stanford's only strong point this
year. In addition, the Cards
boast a potent offense that is
averaging eight runs per game,
and an airtight defense that is
making things much easier on
the pitching staff.
"I think you should give the
credit to the fielders," said a
grateful Lomnickey. "They
give a pitcher confidence. I can
throw anything up there and
know that they will make the
plays behind me."
Lending credence to Lom
nickey's words were Mike
Aldrete, who made four sparkl
ing defensive plays at first

base; and Mike Toothman, who
preserved Lomnickey's shutout
in the ninth with a super throw
from rightfield that pegged
UOP's Greg Carvozzi at home
It's becoming a habit for Tooth
man, who saved Paul Grame's
no-hitter earlier this year on a
diving catch.
Stanford took the lead in the
third when, after a double by
Aldrete and a walk to Tooth
man, Bill Worden slapped a two
out grounder that should have
been the third out and ended the
inning. But UOP shortstop
Steve Voight's throw to first
was high, allowing Aldrete to
score and Worden and Tooth
man to advance to second and
third, respectively. Pitcher Ron
Duhamel then balked Toothman
home, giving Stanford an early
2-0 lead.
The Cards added one more
run in the sixth, two in the sev
enth, and three in the eighth
with the aid of two UOP errors.
Stanford was led offensively
by Toothman and Mike Dot
terer, who each had a pair of
hits on the afternoon.
