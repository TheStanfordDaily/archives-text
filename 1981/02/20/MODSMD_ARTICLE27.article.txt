## Dear Andy: DiBiaso? 
### 
Sneaker-to-Sneaker is a com
mentary written by sports edi
tors Steve Odell and Sally
Jenkins. Each week we debate a
different controversial issue in
sports, usually one surrounding
the Stanford community.
This week's issue is the recent
decision by Athletic Director
Andy (leiger to extend men's
head basketball coach Dick
Dißiaso's contract for two
years.

ball conference in the nation),
and respect what Dißiaso has
accomplished with what he has
had.
"He's trying to play with
guns, and the rest of us have
cannons," said George Ravel
ing, head coach at Washington
State. "But I'll tell you one
thing, anybody who doesn't
think that Stanford will be a
force to be reckoned with in the
future is just kidding them
selves. Those four freshmen are
tough."
And that's another reason
why the decision to retain
Dißiaso was a good one. With
his four freshman recruits, he's
got a solid base for a winning
team in the future. "He's about
a player and a half away," ac
cording to Raveling.
If Geiger would have given
Dißiaso the pink slip, it would
have destroyed the continuity
which is so important to a pro
gram, and would have drastical
ly hurt the recruiting for next
year. The athletic director's
timing was superb. Because
now high school seniors can look
at Stanford as a program on the
way up, a team built on youth, as
well as one with a stable
coaching staff.
One more good recruiting
year, and who knows? With
Dißiaso back
at the helm for two more years,
the best of Stanford basketball,
believe it or not, is yet to come.
Thanks, Andy.
