Dick Dißiaso has been under
fire for the past several years
because of his inability to win
consistently in the Pacific-10.
But thanks to Andy Geiger,
Dißiaso still has two more
years to prove himself at one of
the most demanding coaching
jobs in the nation.
But there is much more to
being a major college coach
than piling up "W's" in the win
loss column. Dißiaso has the re
spect of his players — as a per
son and a coach.
Getting rid of Dißiaso would
not solve the problem, it would
only further cloud Stanford's
basketball future. Dißiaso is
working hard to break down the
barriers blocking the success of
his program, and winning per
centages are matters for discre
tion at any rate.
One also has to look back and
remember that Dißiaso did not
exactly inherit a basketball
powerhouse when he took the
post
here on the Farm in 1975. Even
though Stanford has had super
teams in the past, Dißiaso came
into a program that had had only
one winning season in the pre
vious eight. He steered that first
team to an 11-16 record, and as a
result, he was named Pacific-8
Conference Co-Coach of the
Year in a vote by his peers.
And that is an important
point. Dißiaso is regarded high

basketball the best — his con
temporaries. Other coaches in
the Pac-10 know just how hard it
