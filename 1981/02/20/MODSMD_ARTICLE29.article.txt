Dear Andy —
Imagine my shock and sur
prise when I discovered that
coach Dick Dißiaso's contract
had been renewed. I would be
willing to overlook the fact that
his win-loss record is nothing
short of dismal, if only he
showed any indication that
basketball at Stanford can be
fun.
I can appreciate the fact that
building a winning program at
Stanford is not easy. But he
seems to have added to the
many obstacles by creating a
rather disagreeable at
mosphere in Maples Pavilion.
The excuse that recruiting is

hard at Stanford because it is
difficult to find NCAA-quality
athletes with minds, is growing
old rapidly. What one is essen
tially saying with that
statement is that it is hard to
find blacks who can play, and
who have decent educational
backgrounds.
But the issue cannot be re
duced to black and white. While
the above statement might be
true occasionally, to carry it
further is to say that whites do
not compete as well in NCAA
basketball, which is garbage. If
you want names, how about Bill
Bradley and Paul Westphal.
If Stanford basketball has a
talent problem, then why does
the program seem prone to the
same syndrome that other
Cardinal teams struggle with?
The basketball team has seen its
share of victories over UCLA
and USC, so talent is not the
problem. But consistent losses
combined with a victory here
and there indicates only one
thing to me: the players are
playing for themselves.
Which is fine to a certain ex
tent. But what happened to
playing for the school, for the
team, and for fun? Dißiaso's
record indicates not a lack of
talent, but a lack of knowledge
of how to motivate that talent
correctly.
Unbelievable as it seems,
Stanford has had a cham
pionship basketball team here
and there. The 1937 squad trav
eled back East to play the best
team in the nation, Long Island
University. They shocked the
basketball world by having fun,
of all things, in New York's
Penn Station.
When the team had to wait for
the luggage off the train they
started up a bowling game with
oranges. LIU thought they had a
lock against the s'lly kids from
the West, who obviously didn't
take the game seriously. Stan
ford won, of course, 49-35. The
team had a season record of
25-2. That is playing for fun, and
that was a successful team.
It appears that Dißiaso is one
of those very good assistant
coaches, who has only a vague
idea of how to inspire a team,
which is a major requirement
for a successful head coach.
