### Alice Abrams 
The Northern California Democrat
ic Party recently elected its youngest
treasurer ever: Stanford graduate
Steve Westly.
'Westly, an energy consultant for the
Public Utilities Commission in San
Francisco, served on the Council of
Presidents while attending Stanford
and initiated the present Honor Code
Commission
After graduating in 1978 with a his
tory degree, Westly worked in Wash
ington. D.C., as a legislative aide to
the late Rep. Leo Ryan (D-San
Mateo) While there he specialized in

energy issues and edited the book
Energy Efficiency . . . New Direc
tions.
Upon his return to California about
a year and a half ago. Westly began to
work in the Democratic Party, cam
paigning for State Assemblyman
Byron Sher and most recently for
former President Jimmy Carter He
traveled to the Democratic National
Convention in New York City last
summer as an elected delegate and
whip
At the end of last year State Sen
Arlen Gregorio appointed Westly to
the 1600-member State Central Demo

cratic Committee. After this appoint
ment VVestly decided to run for treas
urer during the state convention
Westly said he was surprised at the
intensity of campaigning for such
state-wide posts, which are often held
by multi-millionaires The four-week
campaign, he said, "is almost over
whelming."
According to Westly, he was suc
cessful because he was well-organized
and constantly aware of delegates'
views He is strongly in favor of hav
ing human contact with voters and
hopes to change some of the Demo
cratic campaigning techniques.

In future elections, VVestly would
like to see the Democrats expand their
use of computers to monitor voter at
titude. He also wants the party to form
a system of precinct coordinators like
those the Republicans used in the 1980
campaign, to provide more local con
tact with voters
This lack of "grassroots" support
contributed to the Democratic loss in
1980, according to Westly. In the last
campaign the Democrats received
campaign contributions from tar
fewer sources than the Republicans,
he said. Westly said he feels increased
contact with the public could change
this.
During his campaign for treasurer,
Westly had to convince the delegates
that his youth was an asset He also
had to overcome the opposition of ac
tivist Tom Hayden's influential Cam
paign for Economic Democracy
(CED), which controlled approx
imately 30 percent of the delegates
Westly was the only person to defeat
one of the six CED-endorsed can
didates.
As for future plans. Westly was non
committal Reluctant to mount a full
fledged, six-month campaign for a
seat in the California Assembly, West
ly said he would like to start a family
before becoming further involved in
politics.
Westly said he strongly believes
that Stanford students should consider
a political career. He said he feels the
government needs intelligent and
competent people working in it.
Stressing the fact that there are never
enough people. Westly said he feels
that a politician will be successful if he
is reliable, well-organized and hard
working He also said. "A little bit of
sacrifice is not a bad thing," if you
want to go out and improve the gov
ernment,
A resident of Menlo Park, Westly
often returns to the Stanford campus,
and stays informed about the current
issues in student government here As
a former member of the COP, he said
they were "radical," recalling a 100-
student occupation at Old Union in
1978 to protest the situation in South
Africa Westly is supportive of the
current COP, although he said he was
less conservative
