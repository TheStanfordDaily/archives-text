# Stanford continues losing ways against USC
## 
### Chris Haft 
Rebounding a basketball is a
difficult task requiring timing,
strength and technique. Last
night at Maples Pavilion, how
ever, rebounding became damn
near impossible for Stanford,
which lost to USC, 74-67.
USC's 39-21 rebounding edge
demonstrated the problems
Stanford had underneath the
basket. It didn't matter that
none of the Trojans' starters
stands taller than 6-foot-7, for
they used their superior
quickness and jumping ability
to beat the Cardinals to the
boards. It didn't matter that the
Trojans shot poorly from the
outside, because they were
often in position to grab their
own misses and deposit them
through the hoop.
• "It may have been the worst
display of rebounding that
we've had in a long, long time,"
Stanford head coach Dick
Dißiaso said.
"We were just completely
embarrassed on the boards,"
agreed Card co-captain Brian
Welch. "There's no excuse for
what happened to us. We didn't
block out."
The Cards, now 3-11 against
Pacific-10 Conference foes and
7-16 overall, also didn't force the
Trojans to take the outside shots

they have trouble making USC
scored only eight baskets on
shots that weren't lay-ups, tip
ins or follows after an offensive
rebound
Now 7-6 in conference action
and 12-10 overall, the Trojans
essentially settled matters dur
ing the first nine minutes of the
second half, when they dis
played matchless efficiency by
scoring 12 baskets in 13
possessions, to extend a 33-31
half time lead into a 57-45 advan
tage with 11:11 to go.
Seven of those dozen hoops
came on lay-ins, two after of
fensive rebounds and three on
outside shots, characterizing
what occurred the rest of the
evening.
"Their total team just sort of
— mesmerized us," Dißiaso
said with a hint of helplessness
in his voice.
Yet the Cards, particularly
Welch (20 points) and Keith
Jones (14 points, five steals)
snapped out of their reverie
enough to seriously challenge
the Trojans.
With Stanford trailing 60-49,
the Trojans actually had a scor
ing slump. Meanwhile, Welch
notched a lay-up, Jones hit a
fast-break jumper and Welch
added a 14-footer, cutting the
margin to 60-55 with 6:58 re

maining.
Still trailing by five. 64-59,
with less than three minutes
left, the Cards' chance to close
to within three failed when
guard Doug Marty missed a
jumper and tipped the rebound
to a grateful Jacque Hill He
quickly passed to forward
James McDonald for a fast
break basket with 2:38 to go that
put USC up 66-59.
USC guard Dwight Anderson
did the most to prevent a last
minute Card rally, scoring six
points in the final minute-and-a
half on a goal-tended lay-in and
four free throws.
The 6-foot-3 junior transfer
from Kentucky showed why the
Trojans so anxiously awaited
Jan. 26, the date he became
eligible to play. Anderson fin
ished with 20 points, a game
high 12 rebounds and substantial
compliments from both
coaches.
"For a team as quick as they
are and not that big, he gives
them a real offensive weapon,"
Dißiaso said.
"There was never a doubt in
my mind that Dwight Anderson
would be an outstanding
player," stated USC head coach
Stan Morrison. "He's improv
ing with each game, and he's be
coming more familiar with our

style of play."
McDonald proved to be anoth
er indispensable Trojan, limit
ing Stanford's John Revelli to
three points and four rebounds,
far below his corresponding av
erages of 13.7 and 7.6
Neither Anderson nor
McDonald, however, helped the
Trojans much at the outset. The
Cards jumped to an 11-4 lead
before USC opened its under
the-basket barrage, and with
8:10 left in the first half Stan
ford still had its seven-point
cushion, 22-15. But three
straight USC baskets, one by
forward Cedric Bailey and two
by Anderson, narrowed the gap
to 22-21.
Roger Lemons' 17-foot
baseline jumper and Jones' free
throw gave Stanford a 25-21
edge, but the Trojans scored the

next eight points to take a 29-25
lead, a lead they never relin
quished
