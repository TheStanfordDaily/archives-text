Yesterday's play in the Nor-
Cal Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships was a victory
for all those pragmatic folk out
there who never believed in the
Impossible Dream. The odds on
any team not named Stanford or
California winning this tour
nament are the as on Stan
ford's basketball team of win
ning the Pac-10 title.
Five of Stanford's six entries
won in singles yesterday at the
San Francisco Tennis Club,
while all three doubles teams
swept to wins. Only Andy
Chase's 6-3. 3-6. 7-6 loss to Phil
Lehnhoff prevented the Cards
from going unbeaten.
The eight wins gave Dick
Gould's team a one-point lead
over the Bears from Berkeley.
Stanford won two of three
matches in which the schools
faced each other, giving the
Cards the 8-7 edge.
Top-seeded Tim Mayotte.
Stanford's No. 1 player, had an
easy time with Andv Lutz of
Chico State in a 6-3.6-1 win. Oth
er straight-set winners for Stan
ford were sophomore Jim Gur
fein (6-2. 6-4 over Jeff Jacklich
of Fresno State i and Scott Bond
urant, who evened the Stanford-

Cal score at one apiece with a
6-3. 6-1 victory over the Bears'
Doug Stone.
Greg Hing repeated last

USF's Greg Davis with a 1-6,
6-1,6-3 victory and John Corse
edged out John Saviano of San
Jose State 2-6. 6-2, 6-4.
When sophomore Jeff Arons
withdrew from the tourney field
due to illness, freshman Scott
Davis decided not to leave for
the father-son meet in which he
expected to play. The result was
better doubles play for Stan
ford, as he and Bondurant
whipped Cal's Lehnhoff and
Randy Nixon 6-4. 6-4.
With his partner Arons gone.
