# Cards face USC, Cat
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's two gymnastics
teams head into competition
this weekend with very dif
ferent visions of their respec
tive opponents. The Cardinal
women's squad travels to
Berkeley tomorrow night about
as sure as one can be in this
sport of emerging victorious.
On the other hand, the Stanford
men face a host USC team to
night of uncertain strength.
Since gymnasts compete
more against themselves and
the event equipment than oppos
ing squads, there is not a whole
lot that a team or coach can do
even if they have a detailed
scouting report. Subjectively,
however, knowledge of the com
petition can add pressure in a
close match-up. often improv
ing routines in the case of ex
perienced gymnasts. In a
lopsided meet, overconfiden
cecan haunt the favorite team
and sometimes nervousness can
affect the underdog.
Against the Golden Bears, the
Cards are favored by roughly 14
to 18 points, based on average
team scores so far this season.
Rather than the Bear gymnasts,
the toughest opponent for Stan
ford could be overconfidence
and it will take extra concentra
tion to ward off.
"We should beat them signifi
cantly," the Stanford coach said
yesterday. "They are hurting in
depth — Karen Kelsall (Cal's
top performer) is not as strong
as she was last year and Jill
Hansen (the Bears' top re

turnee) transferred to San Die
go State.
"Karen Hall will be going all
around for us, so we'll be expec
ting our highest score of the sea
son." Walker said. "Last week
our goal was 138 points and we
got 136 without her. This time
we could easily hit 138, and I'd
be happy if we hit 140."
Besides counting on Hall in
all-around, the Cards also hope
to see Jeanette Lacoste in at
least three events. Suffering
from a shoulder injury, she was
limited to entering only one
event last against Washington
State.
For the men, the pre-meet es
timates are not clear cut, but
the bet by head coach Sadao
Hamada hedges towards a close
contest down south.
"I really don't know about
USC this year," Hamada said.
"I haven't received any of their
statistics. In the past they have
had a lot of good all-around men
and they're supposed to be a bet
ter team this year, but they've
had a lot of injuries recently.
We're fully prepared for an ex
citing battle — they're going to
be tough."
Overall, the Cards are rated
20th in the country, and in the
top 15 or 10 in floor exercise,
rings and high bar. Individually,
top all-arounder Mike Lee
placed a "borderline sixth or
seventh in the western region"
Hamada said, and if he con
tinues to hit 54.00 points-plus, he
has a good chance at nationals.
