## Brown: a new shade of Bruin 
### 
When Larry Brown came
to UCLA two years ago to re
place Gary Cunningham as
the Bruins' basketball coach,
it just didn't seem right. It
was kind of like Pablo
Picasso stepping down to
teach Art I, or William
Faulkner teaching freshman
English.

Com mentary

You see, Larry Brown was
a pro. He had spent more
than 10 years as a player and
coach in the ABA and NBA,
rubbing shoulders with guy*
like Rick Barry and David
Thompson. Observers be
lieved the intense Brown,
who leads the Bruins into
Maples Pavilion tomorrow
night, would be too harsh on
fuzzy-cheeked, acne-prone
collegians. Skeptics doubted
that Brown could adjust his
NBA strategies to fit
UCLA's.
But Brown, exasperated
with the ulcerating ways of
professional basketball,
traded visits to Madison
Square Garden with junkets
to Harmon Gymnasium. He
now launches invective not
at Darrell Garretson, but at
Booker Turner. Instead of
trying to figure out how to
stop Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
he worries about containing
Steve Johnson.
The doubters nodded sage
ly when the Bruins began the
1979-80.season by losing six of
their first 14 games — three
times to Pac-10 opponents,
twice to Notre Dame and
once to DePaul. Obviously,
they thought, UCLA couldn't
win the big ones with Brown
The skeptics made them
selves scarce, though, when
UCLA won five straight
games in the NCAA tour
nament and fell just a hand
ful of points short of winning
the national championship.
Brown's current 38-14 career

record at UCLA proves that
he can successfully coach
college basketball.
Yet one can still argue that
Brown doesn't fit the typical
college basketball coach's
mold, at least on the surface.
The average college coach
looks like he stepped out of
Hoys' Life magazine. Brown,
meanwhile, is a walking ad
vertisement for Gen
tleman's Quarterly.
Coaches — Pac-10
coaches, at least — fall into
one of two categories.
There's the big, tall, former
player type, characterized
by Stanford's Dick Dißiaso,

California's Dick Kuchen,
Washington State's George
Raveling and USC's Stan
Morrison. These guys look
like they could still go out
there and grab a few re
bounds.
Then there's the grizzled,
wrinkled type, like Arizona
State's Ned Wulk, Washing
ton's Marv Harshman and
Oregon State's Ralph Miller.

With their creased faces and
general well-worn ap
pearance, they ought to be
herding cows, not directing
ballplayers.
Brown, however, is
neither rangy nor elderly.
Short and dark-haired, he re
sembles a successful young
stockbroker more than any
thing else. Unlike the other
coaches, who dress neatly
but conventionally in the
haberdashery of Brooks
Brothers or J.C. Penney s,
Brown opts for the Pierre
Cardin-Bill Blass-Ralph
Lauren look.
Brown's speech further
defines his uniqueness. Dur
ing post-game press con
ferences, one gets the feeling
Brown just got off the bus
from Flatbush. His Brooklyn
accent gives him a definite
"tough-guy" aspect most
coaches lack, and his diction
strengthens the image of a
man-of-the-streets. In short,
he doesn't talk like the 40-
year-old he is.
"Man, you should see our
freshmen handle the ball (in
practice)," Brown
mused after last month's
UCLA-Stanford game. "It's
a trip."
Brown tries to silence per
sistently circulating rumors
citing his eagerness to return
to NBA coaching by saying
he's not "ready" for pro
fessional basketball. One
wonders, however, if the
world of college basketball
coaches is ready to keep
Larry Brown, a cool breeze
among staid relics, for a few
more years. What if the other
Pac-10 coaches, envious of
Brown's success, decide to
copy him? I mean, can you
imagine Ralph Miller or
Dick Dißiaso wearing Calvin
Klein shirts and lamenting
their teams' ballhandling
mistakes as "trips"?
