Hosie the Riveter
Monday, Bishop Auditorium
The stars of this fine documen
tary are Wanita Allen, a former
foundry worker, Gladys Belcher, a
former welder, Lyn Childs, a
former burner, Lola Weixel. a
former welder, and Margaret
Wright, a former ammunitions
worker In a series of, interviews,
we hear them tell how they found
exceptionally fulfilling em
ployment in the factories during
World War 11, and how difficult it
was for them to be forced to go
back to "women's work" after the
war was over
The interview footage is in
tercut with the propaganda films
made for home consumption dur
ing the war The contrast between
what these women were and how
they were portrayed in the popular
media is devastating. This film
will make you appreciate the
strength of these women, and it
will also make you angry about
how badly they were used by their
— and our — society. The film was
funded in part by a grant from the
National Endowment for the Hu
manities Connie Field directed.
(This is a free presentation
sponsored by SWOPSI. The pro
gram starts at 7:30.)

Ihe Incredible Shrinking
It oman *
Bijou, Palo Alto
The Incredible Shrinking
Woman, which stars Lily Tomlin
as (surprise!) a woman who
shrinks, goes wrong in more ways
than most movies have ways: it is
a small miracle of ineptitude.
A feeling of great things being
missed pervades the movie. Even
the special effects seem tired —
the business of shrinking is treated
more like a chore to be completed
than a possibility for exercising
the imagination The movie ends
up being a little depressing: it
laughs so loudly at its own, tiny
punchline that it's hard not to feel
that someone along the line forgot
to tell the joke.

Altered States *
Palo Alto Square
Altered States is the world's
first 70-millimeter, six-track ster
eo Looney Tune It's brightly col
ored, wonderfully noisy, and utter
ly vacuous
. Ken Russell (Women in Love.
Tommy) directed; Paddy
Chayefsky (Network) wrote the
story and screenplay This tale of a
man who turns into an ape
(honest) and does other colorful
things after he takes a rare drug
reflects the worst aspects of both
of its creators: from Russell it re
ceives pointless visual flam
boyance; from Chayefsky it gains
pointless philosophical dis
cussions i "What is man? When do
we eat?"). Its visuals, however,
are very pretty — the movie prac
tically begs you to stop thinking
long enough to enjoy them — and
the soundtrack ("Megasound") is
loud and creepy. It's amazing what
wonderful things one can do with
no ideas at all.

Mon (hide d'Amerique ★★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Mon Oncle d'Amerique is the
latest in a series of exceptional
film essays by director Alain
Resnais (Lust Year at Marienbad.
Night and. Fog). This examination
of human destiny and choice fol
lows the lives of three characters
— a wealthy executive, a devoutly
Catholic superviser in a textile
plant, and an actress who was
raised a Communist — as they
almost accidentally intersect.
Their story is intercut with an in
terview with real-life psychologist
Henri Laborit, changing the film
into something that is not-quite
fiction and not-quite fact. The ten
sion between documentary and
narrative gives Mon Oncle
d'Amerique its resonance; thedis
tance between where the charac
ters are and where they would like
to be gives the film its dry, some
times-bitter humor.

Hearts and Minds
Wednesday, First Congregational
Lutheran Church
This documentary is emotional
ly devastating it presents a numb
ing panorama of the United States'
involvement in Vietnam Its ap
proach is to start in-close and
move out. We see the horrible par
ticulars, and then see how they fit
into the larger structure of the
war The film, like the war, will re
main in your subconscious forev
er.
(This is a benefit showing which
will begin at 7:30 First congrega
tional Lutheran is located at Lewis

Harold and Maude★★★
Old Mill, Mountain View

old woman who believes in free
love and the inherent goodness of
humanity. It's clear from the be
ginning that the two are destined
to fall in love. Bud Cort plays
Harold; Ruth Gordon is Maude.
Hal Ash by (Being There, Coming
Home) directed. The script, by
Colin Higgins (9 to 5) was initially
done as a UCLA master's project.
Late show this weekend.

The lilack Stallion ★
Fox, Redwood City
Carroll Ballard, up until now
known primarily as a promising
protege of Francis Coppola,
directed The Black Stallion as if
the only logic he had ever known
was a cinematic one Incidents in
the film, which, on the strictest
narrative level, are absurd, seem
perfectly reasonable when viewed
on the film's own terms. Ballard
has lived up to his promise with a
work of striking, and strikingly
beautiful, imagery.
A boy and ahorse are both ship
wrecked on a desert island; when
the child is rescued, he refuses to
leave without the animal. Re
turned to civilization, both must
learn to live in what has become an
alien landscape
Plays tomorrow night only.

ISo ,\uktfx ★★★'£
Old Mill, Palo Alto
Haskell Wexler, who directed
the fascinating mock-documen
tary Medium Cool, photographed
this rock-documentary of the
MUSE (Musicians United for Safe
Energy) benefit which took place
in New York a year ago. He's
chosen to emphasize the per
formers' faces, often to
mesmerizing effect — we've never
been 50 c/asr to these people
before. It's possible to question the
legitimacy of celebrities cam
paigning about such an issue
1 would the movie have been made
any differently if the benefit had
been in support of nuclear energy
instead ot against it?) but it's hard
not to get caught up with their en
thusiasm and c oncern.
Your opinion of the movie will
inevitably be affected by your
opinion of its people They include
Bruce Springsteen and the E
Street Band. Jackson Browne, the
Doobie Brothers, and Gil Scott-
Herron Late show this weekend.

innir llull ★★★★
New Varsity. Palo Alto
Woody Allen's great psycho
sexual comedy has no weak mo
ments; it's his most consistently
appealing film. Allen and his co
star, Diane Keaton, are wonderful
together When Keaton's around,
Allen loses some of his freakish
ness and is transformed into a per
son who. if still not entirely nor
mal. is a very special human
being Keaton. too. is lent a special
radiance: she sings "Seems Like
Old Times" in a thin, quivery.
pretty voice, and. as the camera,
caresses her face, we sense how
much Allen adores her A lovely
movie.
Flays tonight only.

9 to 5 *
Old Mill. Mountain View
One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about .the revenge three abused
secretaries take on their
chauvinistic boss are quickly
smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy
with a fake feminist gloss and a
Frank Capracorn ending. Lily
Tomlin. Dolly Parton and Dabney
Coleman salvage as much as they
can, but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance: trying to
play a woman of average in
telligence and to be light and funny
at the same time, she telegraphs
appallingly and gives us scenes of
classic female incompetence,
which surely cannot be what she
intended.

Apocalypse Now *"***
Sunday, Mem Aud
An extraordinary work of mad,
glorious genius. Writer-director
Francis Coppola's reworking of
Heart of Darkness takes Conrad's
essential narrative and structures
a journey into a physical hell; it's
likely to engross — horribly
fascinate — some, and turn away
others.
Aided by the superb cinemato
graphy of Vittorio Storaro, Cop
pola creates stunning images of
Vietnam that combine frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and a vision of over
whelming evil The movie has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions it confronts
you with justify the seeming crazi
ness of this "impossible," almost
nihilistic vision of mankind Star

Brando

Shatlow a Doubt
Wednesday, Tresidder Large
Lounge
There are few directors whose
mastery of cinema —and not just
"suspense" — rivals Alfred
Hitchcock's This 1943 master
piece finds the director at the top
of his form Black smoke from the
train he travels on heralds the ar
rival of a murderer into a small
town The murderer, named
Charlie (Joseph Cotten) is wel
comed by his favorite niece, also
named Charlie (Theresa Wright).
Slowly, she unravels her uncle's
past: with a shock, she realizes the
ring he gave her as a gift was taken
from the hand of one of his vic
tims. Hitchcock brilliantly jux
taposes this with the apparent
serenity of the town (the film was
shot on location in Santa Rosa) and
the love the family feels for their
relative. The wedding between the
beautiful and horrible is captured
by the bit of tune the characters
keep humming: 'The Merry
Widow Waltz "

tool Miner's Daughter ★***
Guild. Menlo Park
A pretty terrific movie, made
that way by some great per
formances and by director
Michael Apted's eve for telling de
tail. Country star Loretta Lynn s
rags-to-riches story is brought to
the screen with warmth and fine
humor. Even when, two-thirds of
the way through, the inevitable
heartbreak comes, the movie
glides through showbiz cliche and
comes out with its good nature in
tact.
Sissy Spacek portrays the
singer as ii she and Lynn had been
best friends: her performance
suggests shared secrets and late
night soul searching. Tommy Lee
Jones and Beverly D'Angelo (as
Patsy Cline) turn in superb sup
porting performances.

Palo Alto Square
Frederick Forsyth's thriller
contains the basic elements ol a
'30s action adventure picture with
some modern cynicism thrown in
— a huge multinational hires a
band of mercenaries to stage a
coup d'etat in a small African
country. But director John Irvin
can't bring himself to give the
movie the pulpy thriller feel it
needs; instead, the film plays as if
it were an updated version of Lives
of a Bengal l.ancer with a script by
Samuel Beckett. Irvin reduces the
movie to a study of its hero and his
feelings about his terrible deeds
Christopher Walken plays the head
mercenary; when he's not in ac
tion (which is most of the movie)
he's required to project torment
and uncertainty, but his inex
pressive face betrays him — his
performance is excruciating The
very great cinematographer Jack
Cardiff isn't helped by having the
dead-weight Walken at the center
of nearly all his shots.

The characters names are the C

storyline runs more or less as it C
does in the book, but the soul of the »=
work is gone £
Tcis* centerpiece is Nastassia C

she could, without in the least in- i

she has an accent. It is difficult to .
concentrate on her character's r
plight when it sounds as if she
spent summers on the banks of the
Rhine.
The ultimate responsibility, of
course, rests with director Roman
Polanski. Unable to render any
real, cinematic interpretation of
the novel, he contented himself
with dramatizing its "big mo

what he was afraid to try, was to
offer any reason for seeing the
movie rather than staying home
and rereading the book.

The Kids Are Uriaht
Old Mill, Mountain View
The Kids Are Alright is like an
erector set married to a time ma

the hallmarks of a pop
phenomenon being bolted into

successful life of The Who is a
compilation of concert footage anct

over a 10-year span What sets this
movie apart from other concert

At 70, Akira Kurosawa directs
what may be his summit achieve
ment: a samurai epic that sug
gests a fusion of Shakespeare and
Pirandello. A thief is hired as the
'shadow' of a samurai chieftain —■
to stand in for him when he is in
jured in battle — and when the
leader dies, the thief must take
over. There's a post - battle se
quence that is reminiscent of the
'Guernica.' A masterpiece.

Saturday. Cubberley
Natalie Wood is a pretty bad ac
tress: Jim Backus is worse. Sal
Mineo gets by on the force of sheer
neurotia. But James Dean, as a
middle class boy gone bad, is as
tounding; his presence, combined
with Nicholas Ray's direction,
tires this movie with late-adoles
cent anger Dean is the modern
cowboy: he carries courage, and
passion, from off the plains onto
the urban landscape He is a dis
tinctively twentieth-century hero.
