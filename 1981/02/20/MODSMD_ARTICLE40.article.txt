The blintzes consisted of two

After carefully examining the
diverse menu, we settled on
blintzes ($4 25). the veggie
omelette ($4 35) and a side or

vegetables, raisins and sun

with tomato slices The unique
flavor and crunchy texture of
this salad was outstanding.

order dessert since we came for
