An inviting freshness characterizes
the food and atmosphere of Country Sun
Cafe The store is airy and bright, and the
home-cooked fare is served with cheery
smiles.
As you enter the Country Sun. the cafe
is to the right behind two low bamboo
screens. The natural food store area is to
the left. Attractive wooden tables and
chairs are appropriate to the simple and
warm dining corner, where one can sit by
a large, sunny window or at the counter
on high wooden stools. Instead of individ
ual menus at the tables, a large, hand
made menu hangs on the wall above the
counter where you place your order, pay.
and leave your name. While you wait for
your meal, enjoy the background music
and interesting surroundings.
From the brunch menu, which offers
buttermilk pancakes, French toast,

omelettes, eggs, and scrambled tofu
with vegetables, we selected an omelette
and buttermilk pancakes. For your
omelette, you may choose up to three in
gredients ; the omelettes are topped with
sour cream, and served with home fries,
a corn muffin, and a slice of fresh-cut or
ange The delicately browned pancakes
come with fresh butter and an orange
slice also. On the tables and counter are
jars of honey, syrup, apple butter, and
strawberry and honey preserves Ev
erything is attractively served on beau
tiful stoneware plates
We found the seasoning for each dish to
be well-balanced — pronounced but not
overdone The flavor of the omelettes is
dependent upon the choice of fillings; the
tomato/chili sauce, a zesty blend of
tomatoes, peppers, and other spices, de
liciously complemented the ripe
avocados and raw spinach The whole
wheat pancakes had a delicate sweetness
which made further embellishment un
necessary.
To tickle your imagination, the Cafe
offers an amazing variety of juices, teas,

coffees, and smoothies! For a tropi
cal adventure, try their coconut pineap
ple juice. And should you feel creative,
try concocting your own smoothie with
ingredients such as toasted carob,
yogurt, juices, cashews and the list
goes on The smoothies look deceptively
small, but they're actually almost a
meal in themselves
If you'd prefer something hot, try any
Celestial Seasonings Tea (il it's not be
hind the counter, ask anyway — they'll
bring it tor you from the store!) or one of
their other fine teas. Or. try their hot ap
ple cider — or steamed milk with honey,
almonds, and cinnamon We found the
unlimited refills for their excellent,
fresh-ground coffee and de-caf coffee to
be unusually generous; cappuccino,
espresso, and double espresso are sold by
the cup If you're just thirsty tor water,
there are pitchers of ice water and cups
on the counter
Brunch is served from 10-2 on Satur
days and Sundays. Starting again in
April, there will be live folk music from
12-2 on Fridays and Sundays.
If you'd like something besides the
items on the brunch menu, sample one of
their appetizing deli salads, such as
tabbouli,curried rice, or fruit salad They
also have sandwiches, soups, frozen
yogurt, cookies, and tea rings that beg to
be eaten
Prices are very reasonable for the
quality of food — anywhere from $1.75
for a "Little Munch" (soup, muffin, and
either a deli or green salad i to $4.00 for
their delectable omelettes. Pleasant em
ployees are happy to answer any ques
tions about the food and its preparation

From the brunch menu, which offers
buttermilk pancakes, French toast,

omelettes, eggs, and scrambled tofu
with vegetables, we selected an omelette
and buttermilk pancakes. For your
omelette, you may choose up to three in
gredients ; the omelettes are topped with
sour cream, and served with home fries,
a corn muffin, and a slice of fresh-cut or
ange The delicately browned pancakes
come with fresh butter and an orange
slice also. On the tables and counter are
jars of honey, syrup, apple butter, and
strawberry and honey preserves Ev
erything is attractively served on beau
tiful stoneware plates
We found the seasoning for each dish to
be well-balanced — pronounced but not
overdone The flavor of the omelettes is
dependent upon the choice of fillings; the
tomato/chili sauce, a zesty blend of
tomatoes, peppers, and other spices, de
liciously complemented the ripe
avocados and raw spinach The whole
wheat pancakes had a delicate sweetness
which made further embellishment un
necessary.
To tickle your imagination, the Cafe
offers an amazing variety of juices, teas,

coffees, and smoothies! For a tropi
cal adventure, try their coconut pineap
ple juice. And should you feel creative,
try concocting your own smoothie with
ingredients such as toasted carob,
yogurt, juices, cashews and the list
goes on The smoothies look deceptively
small, but they're actually almost a
meal in themselves
If you'd prefer something hot, try any
Celestial Seasonings Tea (il it's not be
hind the counter, ask anyway — they'll
bring it tor you from the store!) or one of
their other fine teas. Or. try their hot ap
ple cider — or steamed milk with honey,
almonds, and cinnamon We found the
unlimited refills for their excellent,
fresh-ground coffee and de-caf coffee to
be unusually generous; cappuccino,
espresso, and double espresso are sold by
the cup If you're just thirsty tor water,
there are pitchers of ice water and cups
on the counter
Brunch is served from 10-2 on Satur
days and Sundays. Starting again in
April, there will be live folk music from
12-2 on Fridays and Sundays.
If you'd like something besides the
items on the brunch menu, sample one of
their appetizing deli salads, such as
tabbouli,curried rice, or fruit salad They
also have sandwiches, soups, frozen
yogurt, cookies, and tea rings that beg to
be eaten
Prices are very reasonable for the
quality of food — anywhere from $1.75
for a "Little Munch" (soup, muffin, and
either a deli or green salad i to $4.00 for
their delectable omelettes. Pleasant em
ployees are happy to answer any ques
tions about the food and its preparation
After your meal, you may wish to browse
through the natural foods aisles — the va
riety of goods is fascinating
