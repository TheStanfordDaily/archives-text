# Congressmen do 'favors'
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — A four-term congressman
suggested yesterday that a survey of his House
colleagues would reveal that most of them
have been offered $500 or so to perform a ser
vice for a constituent.
Rep Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) who disclosed that
he had rejected such a campaign contribution
four years ago, raised the issue at a House judi
ciary subcommittee hearing on guidelines gov
erning FBI undercover operations.
The guidelines, issued by former Attorney
General Benjamin Civiletti two weeks before
the Carter administration ended, are now un
der review by Attorney General William
Smith, Hyde said They are especially sensi
tive now because of the six congressmen or
former congressmen convicted in the FBl's
"Abscam" undercover operation
Two fields of congressional activity —
private bills that a congressman introduces on
behalf of an individual, and legislation on im
migration matters — are "a source of prob
lems" for congressmen, Hyde said.
"It would be fascinating to take a survey of
congressmen on how many have been "Offered,
say, $500 for (such services as) getting some
one in from India." Hyde said "I daresay most
have."
In the Abscam operation, an undercover FBI
agent pretended to represent a wealthy Arab
sheik who was willing to pay large sums of
money for legislation that would enable him to
remain in the United States.
Hyde said after the hearing that he had been
approached four years ago by "a wealthy guy
from India" who wanted his help in assisting
students from India to achieve permanent resi
dence in the United States.
The next thing he knew, Hyde said, the man
was trying to make a $500 contribution to his
reelection campaign. Hyde said that he turned

back the contribution, which was offered "un
comfortably close" to the time of the Indian's
request.
Hyde said he would not have helped the man.
with or without a contribution, because the stu
dents were not from his district.
Hyde attributed that approach to him to
"some people being stupid' in thinking that
the "old politics" is the way things are ac
complished in Washington
At the hearing, two law school professors of
criminal law and procedure said that they re
garded the undercover guidelines as steps in
the right direction that failed to go far enough
Louis Michael Seidman of Georgetown Uni
versity Law Center said that he was concerned
that the guidelines "appear to permit the FBI
to dangle substantial inducements before
wholly innocent citizens suspected of no
wrongdoing and unlikely ever to be involved in
crime."
Seidman said that undercover operations
should be carefully directed at persons in cases
where there is convincing evidence that they
to commit the crime involved.
"The social fabric is inevitably strained by
the spectacle of seemingly -law-abiding
citizens induced to commit crimes." Seidman
said. "The government simply has no business
randomly and purposelessly stress-testing the
morality of its citizens, like so many soldered
joints on an assembly line. "
Geoffrey Stone of the University <t>f Chicago
Law School said that there was "a special so
cial cost associated with the use of spies, se
cret agents and informers."
He said that the unrestrained use of under
cover operatives had the potential of under
mining "that sense of trust which is essential
to the very existence of productive social, busi
ness, political and personal — as well as crimi
nal — relations."
