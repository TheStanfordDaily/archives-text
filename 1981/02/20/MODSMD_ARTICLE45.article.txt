Anti-juntists rail at U.S. military role
San Salvador, EI Salvador — Leftist leaders charged yesterday
that 100 U.S. military advisers are masterminding a counter-in
surgency plan to "cut off the head of the leftist and intellectual
sectors in El Salvador." The Salvadoran junta and U.S. Embassy
sources denied the accusation.
The Democratic Revolutionary Front (FDR). a coalition of lef
tists who want to set up a socialist government, said in a com
munique to news media that the "shameful aid from Washington"
had "obliged the junta to turn schools into barracks." The FDR
said the U.S. activity should remind the world of "what happened
not too many years ago in Vietnam."
The statements came as a prestigious Brazilian newspaper
commented that present U.S. policy on El Salvador would bring
about a "resuscitation of the left" in Latin America. A Reagan
administration effort to drum up support for its El Salvador poli
cy from European leaders, meanwhile, was not met en
thusiastically.
U.S. Embassy sources said there are 18 U.S. advisers in the
country. 13 assisting pilot training for six helicopters given to El
Salvador in January and five advising on "protection for the har
vest."
Political violence between the left, clandestine right-wing par
amilitary groups and the government killed an estimated 13.000
people last year. This year. 2000 to 2500 people have been reported
dead, most of them guerrillas killed since their "final offensive"
was launched Jan. 10.
Meanwhile. Lawrence Eagleburger. personal emissary of Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig, was sent to Europe to brief U.S.
allies on the alleged Soviet involvement in El Salvador and got a
restrained, if not cool, response.
Postal commission votes rate boost
Washington — The U.S. Postal Service yesterday received per
mission to increase the first-class postage rate from 15 cents to 18
cents and the cost of mailing a postcard from 10 to 13 cents
The new rates recommended by the Postal Rate Commission,
which would be the fifth increase since 1970. could take effect as
early as mid-March and also would result in higher parcel post
costs and possibly higher prices for some magazines Because the
rate commission recommended increases lower than those
sought by the Postal Service, additional increases probably will
be needed sooner than postal officials had estimated, perhaps in
two years, rate commission chairman Lee Fritschler said.
The Postal Service governors, who have the final decision on
rates, are expected to take up the issue on March 3. Postal Service
officials said. The governors usually approve the rate com
mission's recommendations, they said. The cost of a first-class
stamp went from 13 cents to 15 cents three years ago. The Postal
Service had been seeking a 20-cent stamp and a 13-cent postcard.
The rate commission's decision was the second setback within
12 hours for the financially troubled Postal Service. On Wednes
day, President Ronald Reagan proposed a $632 million reduction
in its federal subsidies for fiscal 1982. Fritschler told a Senate sub
committee yesterday that if the cuts are made, non-profit mailers
now receiving discount rates may be forced to pay regular rates,
and Saturday mail delivery, rural deliveries or other services
could get the ax.
Postmaster General William Bolger warned the rate com
mission in a speech before the National Press Club earlier this
month against rejecting his request for a 20-cent stamp and other
increases, citing the effects of inflation on postal costs and the
proposed subsidy cuts facing the agency. Bolger said then that he
would not eliminate Saturday mail delivery and would seek prod
uctivity gains and other measures instead.
Pope firm on traditional view of family
Cebu City, Philippines — Pope John Paul II flew south from
Manila to the central Philippines, yesterday — to the place where
Ferdinand Magellan brought Christianity in 1521 — to reaffirm
the Roman Catholic opposition to divorce, abortion, and con-

traception
"The church will never dilute or change her teaching on mar
riage and the family," he told thousands gathered at a sunset
Mass dedicated to the family.
"On my part I owe it to my Apostolic office to reaffirm as clear
ly and as strongly as possible what the Church of Christ teaches in
this respect and to reiterate vigorously her rejection of artificial
contraception and abortion."
His strong statement put him into direct opposition to the gov
ernment of the Philippines, which has been struggling for 20 years
to reduce a birth rate that is one of the highest in the world. The
rate has been reduced recently from 32 to 27 births per thousand
population each year, according to official statistics. But this
level is still regarded as too high to permit a development pro
gram able to reduce widespread malnutrition and unemploy
ment.
Cebu is the center of Catholic conservatism in the Philippines
and its archbishop. Cardinal Julio Rosales. 74, is not among the
churchmen raising social challenges to the Philippine govern
ment.
The pope began his long third day in the Philippines with an ear
ly morning Mass in Quezon City, near Manila. The Mass was dedi
cated to peace, a cause of growing concern here as violence
spreads in the south of the nation where both Moslem separatist
and Communist insurgent forces are active.
His major address of the day, reserved for the family Mass
here, went beyond an affirmation of the traditional views on mar
riage. divorce, contraception and abortion.
"The selfish pursuit of pleasure, sexual permissiveness and the
fear of a permanent commitment are destructive forces." he told
the huge crowd
He added a cautious endorsement of sex education, with em
phasis on the family role.
Poland nears end of recent strikes
Warsaw, Poland — After months of turmoil, Poland was nearly
strike-free yesterday as farmers in a remote mountain village
near the Soviet border were expected to approve an agreement
ending the nation's last known labor protest.
A spokesman for the Gdansk headquarters of the independent
trade union Solidarity said settlement of farmer protests in south
eastern Poland could finally end the nationwide strikes that
started in August.
"However, there may be some isolated action of which we
know nothing," he said "But generally, nothing is happening."
The settlements came a week after Poland's new premier.
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski took office with a plea for a 90-day labor
truce and promised a government of dialogue and negotiation.
Prospects for calm increased yesterday when students across
the nation cancelled protests as word spread of an agreement in
Lodz ending their month-long strike.
Meanwhile, farmers occupying a headquarters building of the
old. government-run union in Rzeszow said they would leave as
soon as an agreement they signed early yesterday was approved
by some 20 farmers holding a sit-in at Solidarity offices in
Ustrzyki Dolne. a remote village of some 5000 people tucked in a
mountain valley eight miles from the Soviet border.
The protests there and in Rzeszow began over registration of a
union of independent farmers under the name Rural Solidarity.
But that issue has been "delayed" for later discussion, a Solidar
ity spokesman in Rzeszow said.
The compromise approved by students in Lodz, seeking aca
demic and social reforms, was signed Wednesday. Students won
registration of a nationwide independent students' association,
but differences remained on some points.
A period of calm and order would enable Poland's leaders to
present a positive picture to other East bloc leaders at Monday's
opening of the Soviet Communist Party Congress in Moscow.
Sen. Percy optimistic for U.S.-Soviet ties
Washington — The Soviet Union will find a way to withdraw
from Afghanistan and will not send troops into Poland unless

there is "a dramatic change" in the situation there, Senate For
eign Relations Committee Chairman Charles Percy (R-Ill.) pre
dicted yesterday.
Percy said that until the Reagan administration took office, the
Soviets "did not have a precise understanding of what the real
consequences" would be if they were to take aggressive action
against another country.
"I don't think the Soviets would have gone into Afghanistan had
they known the price they would have had to pay — the grain em
bargo, the Olympic boycott, and trade restrictions on electronics
and other items." Percy said.
Interviewed by a group of reporters here, Percy spoke with ex
traordinary optimism about future U.S.-Soviet relations.
Referring to recent exchanges of harsh words between the Rea
gan administration and Soviet authorities, Percy said, "Having
gone through this period of rough words. I think we will cooperate
as rational nations and do things that are in our mutual interest.
However, Percy referred to a Jan. 24 letter that Secretary of
State Alexander Haig wrote to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromvko warning the Soviets not to send troops into Poland.
Because of Haig's explicit warning, Percy said, there can be
"no miscalculation" as to U.S. intentions in Poland.
The senator said that a Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghan
istan "will help the climate" for arms negotiations and other
dealings between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Percy also said it is "very clear" that Cuba would like to lessen
its dependence on the Soviet Union and normalize relations with
the United States.
The Reagan administration, he said, "has a great willingness
to look at the Cuban situation realistically. They've got no hangup
about wanting to maintain the degree of animosity we've had with
Cuba."
Sadat winds up European travels
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat concluded a whirlwind
10 days of high-level diplomacy yesterday that focused on Europe
but was equally aimed at improving his image for future Ameri
can and Israeli meetings.
In what is being touted by the Egyptian media as virtually a
conquest of Europe, Sadat addressed the European Parliament in
Luxembourg, was royally received in Paris by French President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, welcomed Austrian Chancellor Bruno
Kreisky to Cairo and concluded the diplomatic flurry yesterday in
a lengthy Nile-side talk with visiting West German Foreign Min
ister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
Five times during the 10 days, Sadat repeated a suggestion he
first offered in 1972 that the Palestinians supplant the Palestine
Liberation Organization and its "compromise" chairman,
Yasser Arafat, with a provisional government-in-exile in order to
prepare themselves for a responsible role in Middle East peace
negotiations.
"He was following the old Arab proverb, Repetition convinces
even a donkey,' but I don't think he has much hope for the idea,"
one observer said.
Egyptian and U.S. officials are currently laying plans for the
Reagan-Sadat meeting in Washington in late March or early
April according to Cairo sources.
Stocks fall after early week surge
New York — Oil stocks and a cross-section of other blue chip
issues led a sharp decline in the market yesterday, wiping out
most of the gains of the past two days.
The selloff was attributed partly to uncertainty over how the
economic proposals President Ronald Reagan made Wednesday
night might fare in Congress.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.74 to 933.36.
Today's weather
Fair, cool, and windy today. Highs from the upper 50b to
mid-60s. Northwesterly winds. Warmer tomorrow.

issues led a sharp decline in the market yesterday, wiping out
most of the gains of the past two days.
The selloff was attributed partly to uncertainty over how the
economic proposals President Ronald Reagan made Wednesday
night might fare in Congress.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.74 to 933.36.
Today's weather
Fair, cool, and windy today. Highs from the upper 50b to

Anti-juntists rail at U.S. military role
San Salvador, EI Salvador — Leftist leaders charged yesterday
that 100 U.S. military advisers are masterminding a counter-in
surgency plan to "cut off the head of the leftist and intellectual
sectors in El Salvador." The Salvadoran junta and U.S. Embassy
sources denied the accusation.
The Democratic Revolutionary Front (FDR). a coalition of lef
tists who want to set up a socialist government, said in a com
munique to news media that the "shameful aid from Washington"
had "obliged the junta to turn schools into barracks." The FDR
said the U.S. activity should remind the world of "what happened
not too many years ago in Vietnam."
The statements came as a prestigious Brazilian newspaper
commented that present U.S. policy on El Salvador would bring
about a "resuscitation of the left" in Latin America. A Reagan
administration effort to drum up support for its El Salvador poli
cy from European leaders, meanwhile, was not met en
thusiastically.
U.S. Embassy sources said there are 18 U.S. advisers in the
country. 13 assisting pilot training for six helicopters given to El
Salvador in January and five advising on "protection for the har
vest."
Political violence between the left, clandestine right-wing par
amilitary groups and the government killed an estimated 13.000
people last year. This year. 2000 to 2500 people have been reported
dead, most of them guerrillas killed since their "final offensive"
was launched Jan. 10.
Meanwhile. Lawrence Eagleburger. personal emissary of Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig, was sent to Europe to brief U.S.
allies on the alleged Soviet involvement in El Salvador and got a
restrained, if not cool, response.
Postal commission votes rate boost
Washington — The U.S. Postal Service yesterday received per
mission to increase the first-class postage rate from 15 cents to 18
cents and the cost of mailing a postcard from 10 to 13 cents
The new rates recommended by the Postal Rate Commission,
which would be the fifth increase since 1970. could take effect as
early as mid-March and also would result in higher parcel post
costs and possibly higher prices for some magazines Because the
rate commission recommended increases lower than those
sought by the Postal Service, additional increases probably will
be needed sooner than postal officials had estimated, perhaps in
two years, rate commission chairman Lee Fritschler said.
The Postal Service governors, who have the final decision on
rates, are expected to take up the issue on March 3. Postal Service
officials said. The governors usually approve the rate com
mission's recommendations, they said. The cost of a first-class
stamp went from 13 cents to 15 cents three years ago. The Postal
Service had been seeking a 20-cent stamp and a 13-cent postcard.
The rate commission's decision was the second setback within
12 hours for the financially troubled Postal Service. On Wednes
day, President Ronald Reagan proposed a $632 million reduction
in its federal subsidies for fiscal 1982. Fritschler told a Senate sub
committee yesterday that if the cuts are made, non-profit mailers
now receiving discount rates may be forced to pay regular rates,
and Saturday mail delivery, rural deliveries or other services
could get the ax.
Postmaster General William Bolger warned the rate com
mission in a speech before the National Press Club earlier this
month against rejecting his request for a 20-cent stamp and other
increases, citing the effects of inflation on postal costs and the
proposed subsidy cuts facing the agency. Bolger said then that he
would not eliminate Saturday mail delivery and would seek prod
uctivity gains and other measures instead.
Pope firm on traditional view of family
Cebu City, Philippines — Pope John Paul II flew south from
Manila to the central Philippines, yesterday — to the place where
Ferdinand Magellan brought Christianity in 1521 — to reaffirm
the Roman Catholic opposition to divorce, abortion, and con-

traception
"The church will never dilute or change her teaching on mar
riage and the family," he told thousands gathered at a sunset
Mass dedicated to the family.
"On my part I owe it to my Apostolic office to reaffirm as clear
ly and as strongly as possible what the Church of Christ teaches in
this respect and to reiterate vigorously her rejection of artificial
contraception and abortion."
His strong statement put him into direct opposition to the gov
ernment of the Philippines, which has been struggling for 20 years
to reduce a birth rate that is one of the highest in the world. The
rate has been reduced recently from 32 to 27 births per thousand
population each year, according to official statistics. But this
level is still regarded as too high to permit a development pro
gram able to reduce widespread malnutrition and unemploy
ment.
Cebu is the center of Catholic conservatism in the Philippines
and its archbishop. Cardinal Julio Rosales. 74, is not among the
churchmen raising social challenges to the Philippine govern
ment.
The pope began his long third day in the Philippines with an ear
ly morning Mass in Quezon City, near Manila. The Mass was dedi
cated to peace, a cause of growing concern here as violence
spreads in the south of the nation where both Moslem separatist
and Communist insurgent forces are active.
His major address of the day, reserved for the family Mass
here, went beyond an affirmation of the traditional views on mar
riage. divorce, contraception and abortion.
"The selfish pursuit of pleasure, sexual permissiveness and the
fear of a permanent commitment are destructive forces." he told
the huge crowd
He added a cautious endorsement of sex education, with em
phasis on the family role.
Poland nears end of recent strikes
Warsaw, Poland — After months of turmoil, Poland was nearly
strike-free yesterday as farmers in a remote mountain village
near the Soviet border were expected to approve an agreement
ending the nation's last known labor protest.
A spokesman for the Gdansk headquarters of the independent
trade union Solidarity said settlement of farmer protests in south
eastern Poland could finally end the nationwide strikes that
started in August.
"However, there may be some isolated action of which we
know nothing," he said "But generally, nothing is happening."
The settlements came a week after Poland's new premier.
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski took office with a plea for a 90-day labor
truce and promised a government of dialogue and negotiation.
Prospects for calm increased yesterday when students across
the nation cancelled protests as word spread of an agreement in
Lodz ending their month-long strike.
Meanwhile, farmers occupying a headquarters building of the
old. government-run union in Rzeszow said they would leave as
soon as an agreement they signed early yesterday was approved
by some 20 farmers holding a sit-in at Solidarity offices in
Ustrzyki Dolne. a remote village of some 5000 people tucked in a
mountain valley eight miles from the Soviet border.
The protests there and in Rzeszow began over registration of a
union of independent farmers under the name Rural Solidarity.
But that issue has been "delayed" for later discussion, a Solidar
ity spokesman in Rzeszow said.
The compromise approved by students in Lodz, seeking aca
demic and social reforms, was signed Wednesday. Students won
registration of a nationwide independent students' association,
but differences remained on some points.
A period of calm and order would enable Poland's leaders to
present a positive picture to other East bloc leaders at Monday's
opening of the Soviet Communist Party Congress in Moscow.
Sen. Percy optimistic for U.S.-Soviet ties
Washington — The Soviet Union will find a way to withdraw
from Afghanistan and will not send troops into Poland unless

there is "a dramatic change" in the situation there, Senate For
eign Relations Committee Chairman Charles Percy (R-Ill.) pre
dicted yesterday.
Percy said that until the Reagan administration took office, the
Soviets "did not have a precise understanding of what the real
consequences" would be if they were to take aggressive action
against another country.
"I don't think the Soviets would have gone into Afghanistan had
they known the price they would have had to pay — the grain em
bargo, the Olympic boycott, and trade restrictions on electronics
and other items." Percy said.
Interviewed by a group of reporters here, Percy spoke with ex
traordinary optimism about future U.S.-Soviet relations.
Referring to recent exchanges of harsh words between the Rea
gan administration and Soviet authorities, Percy said, "Having
gone through this period of rough words. I think we will cooperate
as rational nations and do things that are in our mutual interest.
However, Percy referred to a Jan. 24 letter that Secretary of
State Alexander Haig wrote to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromvko warning the Soviets not to send troops into Poland.
Because of Haig's explicit warning, Percy said, there can be
"no miscalculation" as to U.S. intentions in Poland.
The senator said that a Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghan
istan "will help the climate" for arms negotiations and other
dealings between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Percy also said it is "very clear" that Cuba would like to lessen
its dependence on the Soviet Union and normalize relations with
the United States.
The Reagan administration, he said, "has a great willingness
to look at the Cuban situation realistically. They've got no hangup
about wanting to maintain the degree of animosity we've had with
Cuba."
Sadat winds up European travels
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat concluded a whirlwind
10 days of high-level diplomacy yesterday that focused on Europe
but was equally aimed at improving his image for future Ameri
can and Israeli meetings.
In what is being touted by the Egyptian media as virtually a
conquest of Europe, Sadat addressed the European Parliament in
Luxembourg, was royally received in Paris by French President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, welcomed Austrian Chancellor Bruno
Kreisky to Cairo and concluded the diplomatic flurry yesterday in
a lengthy Nile-side talk with visiting West German Foreign Min
ister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
Five times during the 10 days, Sadat repeated a suggestion he
first offered in 1972 that the Palestinians supplant the Palestine
Liberation Organization and its "compromise" chairman,
Yasser Arafat, with a provisional government-in-exile in order to
prepare themselves for a responsible role in Middle East peace
negotiations.
"He was following the old Arab proverb, Repetition convinces
even a donkey,' but I don't think he has much hope for the idea,"
one observer said.
Egyptian and U.S. officials are currently laying plans for the
Reagan-Sadat meeting in Washington in late March or early
April according to Cairo sources.

Anti-juntists rail at U.S. military role
San Salvador, EI Salvador — Leftist leaders charged yesterday
that 100 U.S. military advisers are masterminding a counter-in
surgency plan to "cut off the head of the leftist and intellectual
sectors in El Salvador." The Salvadoran junta and U.S. Embassy
sources denied the accusation.
The Democratic Revolutionary Front (FDR). a coalition of lef
tists who want to set up a socialist government, said in a com
munique to news media that the "shameful aid from Washington"
had "obliged the junta to turn schools into barracks." The FDR
said the U.S. activity should remind the world of "what happened
not too many years ago in Vietnam."
The statements came as a prestigious Brazilian newspaper
commented that present U.S. policy on El Salvador would bring
about a "resuscitation of the left" in Latin America. A Reagan
administration effort to drum up support for its El Salvador poli
cy from European leaders, meanwhile, was not met en
thusiastically.
U.S. Embassy sources said there are 18 U.S. advisers in the
country. 13 assisting pilot training for six helicopters given to El
Salvador in January and five advising on "protection for the har
vest."
Political violence between the left, clandestine right-wing par
amilitary groups and the government killed an estimated 13.000
people last year. This year. 2000 to 2500 people have been reported
dead, most of them guerrillas killed since their "final offensive"
was launched Jan. 10.
Meanwhile. Lawrence Eagleburger. personal emissary of Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig, was sent to Europe to brief U.S.
allies on the alleged Soviet involvement in El Salvador and got a
restrained, if not cool, response.
Postal commission votes rate boost
Washington — The U.S. Postal Service yesterday received per
mission to increase the first-class postage rate from 15 cents to 18
cents and the cost of mailing a postcard from 10 to 13 cents
The new rates recommended by the Postal Rate Commission,
which would be the fifth increase since 1970. could take effect as
early as mid-March and also would result in higher parcel post
costs and possibly higher prices for some magazines Because the
rate commission recommended increases lower than those
sought by the Postal Service, additional increases probably will
be needed sooner than postal officials had estimated, perhaps in
two years, rate commission chairman Lee Fritschler said.
The Postal Service governors, who have the final decision on
rates, are expected to take up the issue on March 3. Postal Service
officials said. The governors usually approve the rate com
mission's recommendations, they said. The cost of a first-class
stamp went from 13 cents to 15 cents three years ago. The Postal
Service had been seeking a 20-cent stamp and a 13-cent postcard.
The rate commission's decision was the second setback within
12 hours for the financially troubled Postal Service. On Wednes
day, President Ronald Reagan proposed a $632 million reduction
in its federal subsidies for fiscal 1982. Fritschler told a Senate sub
committee yesterday that if the cuts are made, non-profit mailers
now receiving discount rates may be forced to pay regular rates,
and Saturday mail delivery, rural deliveries or other services
could get the ax.
Postmaster General William Bolger warned the rate com
mission in a speech before the National Press Club earlier this
month against rejecting his request for a 20-cent stamp and other
increases, citing the effects of inflation on postal costs and the
proposed subsidy cuts facing the agency. Bolger said then that he
would not eliminate Saturday mail delivery and would seek prod
uctivity gains and other measures instead.
Pope firm on traditional view of family
Cebu City, Philippines — Pope John Paul II flew south from
Manila to the central Philippines, yesterday — to the place where
Ferdinand Magellan brought Christianity in 1521 — to reaffirm
the Roman Catholic opposition to divorce, abortion, and con-

traception
"The church will never dilute or change her teaching on mar
riage and the family," he told thousands gathered at a sunset
Mass dedicated to the family.
"On my part I owe it to my Apostolic office to reaffirm as clear
ly and as strongly as possible what the Church of Christ teaches in
this respect and to reiterate vigorously her rejection of artificial
contraception and abortion."
His strong statement put him into direct opposition to the gov
ernment of the Philippines, which has been struggling for 20 years
to reduce a birth rate that is one of the highest in the world. The
rate has been reduced recently from 32 to 27 births per thousand
population each year, according to official statistics. But this
level is still regarded as too high to permit a development pro
gram able to reduce widespread malnutrition and unemploy
ment.
Cebu is the center of Catholic conservatism in the Philippines
and its archbishop. Cardinal Julio Rosales. 74, is not among the
churchmen raising social challenges to the Philippine govern
ment.
The pope began his long third day in the Philippines with an ear
ly morning Mass in Quezon City, near Manila. The Mass was dedi
cated to peace, a cause of growing concern here as violence
spreads in the south of the nation where both Moslem separatist
and Communist insurgent forces are active.
His major address of the day, reserved for the family Mass
here, went beyond an affirmation of the traditional views on mar
riage. divorce, contraception and abortion.
"The selfish pursuit of pleasure, sexual permissiveness and the
fear of a permanent commitment are destructive forces." he told
the huge crowd
He added a cautious endorsement of sex education, with em
phasis on the family role.
Poland nears end of recent strikes
Warsaw, Poland — After months of turmoil, Poland was nearly
strike-free yesterday as farmers in a remote mountain village
near the Soviet border were expected to approve an agreement
ending the nation's last known labor protest.
A spokesman for the Gdansk headquarters of the independent
trade union Solidarity said settlement of farmer protests in south
eastern Poland could finally end the nationwide strikes that
started in August.
"However, there may be some isolated action of which we
know nothing," he said "But generally, nothing is happening."
The settlements came a week after Poland's new premier.
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski took office with a plea for a 90-day labor
truce and promised a government of dialogue and negotiation.
Prospects for calm increased yesterday when students across
the nation cancelled protests as word spread of an agreement in
Lodz ending their month-long strike.
Meanwhile, farmers occupying a headquarters building of the
old. government-run union in Rzeszow said they would leave as
soon as an agreement they signed early yesterday was approved
by some 20 farmers holding a sit-in at Solidarity offices in
Ustrzyki Dolne. a remote village of some 5000 people tucked in a
mountain valley eight miles from the Soviet border.
The protests there and in Rzeszow began over registration of a
union of independent farmers under the name Rural Solidarity.
But that issue has been "delayed" for later discussion, a Solidar
ity spokesman in Rzeszow said.
The compromise approved by students in Lodz, seeking aca
demic and social reforms, was signed Wednesday. Students won
registration of a nationwide independent students' association,
but differences remained on some points.
A period of calm and order would enable Poland's leaders to
present a positive picture to other East bloc leaders at Monday's
opening of the Soviet Communist Party Congress in Moscow.
Sen. Percy optimistic for U.S.-Soviet ties
Washington — The Soviet Union will find a way to withdraw
from Afghanistan and will not send troops into Poland unless

there is "a dramatic change" in the situation there, Senate For
eign Relations Committee Chairman Charles Percy (R-Ill.) pre
dicted yesterday.
Percy said that until the Reagan administration took office, the
Soviets "did not have a precise understanding of what the real
consequences" would be if they were to take aggressive action
against another country.
"I don't think the Soviets would have gone into Afghanistan had
they known the price they would have had to pay — the grain em
bargo, the Olympic boycott, and trade restrictions on electronics
and other items." Percy said.
Interviewed by a group of reporters here, Percy spoke with ex
traordinary optimism about future U.S.-Soviet relations.
Referring to recent exchanges of harsh words between the Rea
gan administration and Soviet authorities, Percy said, "Having
gone through this period of rough words. I think we will cooperate
as rational nations and do things that are in our mutual interest.
However, Percy referred to a Jan. 24 letter that Secretary of
State Alexander Haig wrote to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromvko warning the Soviets not to send troops into Poland.
Because of Haig's explicit warning, Percy said, there can be
"no miscalculation" as to U.S. intentions in Poland.
The senator said that a Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghan
istan "will help the climate" for arms negotiations and other
dealings between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Percy also said it is "very clear" that Cuba would like to lessen
its dependence on the Soviet Union and normalize relations with
the United States.
The Reagan administration, he said, "has a great willingness
to look at the Cuban situation realistically. They've got no hangup
about wanting to maintain the degree of animosity we've had with
Cuba."
Sadat winds up European travels
Cairo, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat concluded a whirlwind
10 days of high-level diplomacy yesterday that focused on Europe
but was equally aimed at improving his image for future Ameri
can and Israeli meetings.
In what is being touted by the Egyptian media as virtually a
conquest of Europe, Sadat addressed the European Parliament in
Luxembourg, was royally received in Paris by French President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, welcomed Austrian Chancellor Bruno
Kreisky to Cairo and concluded the diplomatic flurry yesterday in
a lengthy Nile-side talk with visiting West German Foreign Min
ister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
Five times during the 10 days, Sadat repeated a suggestion he
first offered in 1972 that the Palestinians supplant the Palestine
Liberation Organization and its "compromise" chairman,
Yasser Arafat, with a provisional government-in-exile in order to
prepare themselves for a responsible role in Middle East peace
