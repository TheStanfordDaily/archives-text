## 
### Adam Goodman 
The University Committee on Park
ing and Transportation immediately
accepted a proposal vesterday by resi
dents of Madera, Otero, Rinconada
and Soto houses which would rezone
the Wilbur Hall parking lot.
At the meeting, residential assis
tants (RAsi from Madera and Otero
presented the committee with a peti
tion signed by 180 students asking for
the first two rows of parking on the
southeast side of Wilbur (next to
Wilbur field > to be changed from "C"
parking to residential parking
The committee accepted the peti
tion at the meeting When contacted
later in the afternoon. Alan Water
man. chairman of the committee, said
he had already sent off a memo to the
RAs agreeing to the change. ' It's all
underway, there should be no more
red tape." he said
According to Captain William
Wullschleger of Police Services, the
rezoning of the Wilbur lot would
"hopefully be done within a week
The new Wilbur parking plan would
use 58 spaces which would be safer,
closer and more convenient for resi
dents to use than the current residen
tial spaces on the east side of Wilbur
(across from Escondido Village), said
Mark Leahy. RA at Madera
"The lighting on the southeast side
is much better than that on the east
side," Leahy said. "We are also wor
ried about the grove of trees on the
east side which could make the lot
potentially hazardous at night
The new plan would also change the
back row of the east side of the lot
from residential to "C" parking, thus
compensating for the loss of spaces on
the southeast side

It would actually provide an over
all gain of six "C" parking spots,"
said Corby Kessler. HA at Otero.
The residents petition stated that
the parking change needed to be made
in order to ensure the safety of the
cars by allowing residents to see their
cars from the dorm, to provide protec
tion for the residents walking from
their cars to the dorm at night, and to
allow residents to have the conve
nience of parking nearer to their
houses.
Students say that the problem arose
last week when approximately 70 stu
dents had their cars ticketed for park
ing in the "C" lot though they had resi
dential parking stickers on their cars
According to several students, only
cars which had no stickers had been
ticketed before last week
"I parked there last quarter and
wasn't ticketed." commented Ted
Hopper, Madera freshman I just
want to know why I hey are doing it
now."
Both stickers cost $20. with the "C"
permit being for those people living
off campus and the residential permit
being tor those who live on campus
At the meeting. Kessler and Leahy
also presented the results of a survey
they ran According to Kessler, the
survey showed that the "C" lot is un
derutilized as only 75 to 80 cars park
there although 180 spaces are avaiN
able.
Other parking problems raised at
the meeting could not be solved so
quickly, however The committee
heard complaints on overcrowding in
I niversitv parking lots, especially
near Tresidder, which Waterman de-
