## Venezuelan aid speaks to regional concern 
### Los Angeles Times 
Caracas, Venexuela —
Spurred by a democratic ideol
ogy and concern over spreading
Cuban influence, Venezuela has
moved into the vanguard of op
position to leftist revolutionary
movements in Central America
and the Caribbean
The immediate focus of Vene
zuela's increasing regional ac
tivism is El Salvador, where the
government of President Jose
Napoleon Duarte is being
besieged by a leftist rebellion on
one side and hard-line rightists
on the other. There is growing
evidence of direct Cuban sup
port for the leftist side.
Although Venezuelan Presi
dent Luis Herrera Campins will
not disclose amounts, he re
portedly has poured hundreds of
millions of dollars into El
Salvador to help Duarte and his
junta maintain control.
In addition, there have been
reports of direct Venezuelan
military aid to the Salvadoran
government, reports strongly
denied by Herrera's spokes
men.
Political survival
But whatever the form of the
aid and in whatever amount.
Herrera is clearly and deeply
committed to Duarte's survival
— so committed that many ob
servers think that he is risking
his own political survival and
perhaps the stability of his own
country.
"Given the already unsteady
economic standing of his gov
ernment," a European diplomat
here said, "it is unlikely that
Herrera's political movement
could survive the failure of his
foreign policy objectives in El
Salvador."
Those objectives are simply
to see that Duarte has enough
strength to push back the leftist
threat while at the same time
curbing the power of the right
ists who seek to return El
Salvador to the near-feudal sys
tem that existed until the last
few years.
These goals are not fully ac
cepted in Venezuela. Herrera's
main opposition is Democratic
Action, a socialist party that
shares the president's dislike of
Cuban President Fidel Castro,
yet generally opposes propping
up Duarte.
If Herrera's policy on El
Salvador fails. Democratic Ac
tion would be in a good position
to defeat his forces in the next
election.
Fear
In the background is the addi
tional fear that the downfall of
the Duarte junta would en
courage violence by Venezue
la's small radical movement
and a renewal of Cuban sub
version here.
For many reasons Herrera —
by ignoring such problems —
has jumped into the mess of El
Salvador. They range from a 20-
year-old antipathy between
Venezuela and Castro's Cuba to
an international political move
ment that links Herrera and
Duarte.
, When Castro took power in
Cuba two decades ago, Venezue
la had just overthrown its own

dictator. At first it seemed that
the two countries would estab
lish close ties. Castro came to
Caracas and was given a hero's
welcome.
But the Cuban leader soon fell
out with the moderates who took
over in Venezuela and he active
ly tried to overthrow the Cara
cas government
Terrorists from Cuba also
were accused of trying to kill
Romulo Betancourt, a former
president of Venezuela and a
leader of the democratic left in
Latin America. Castro trained
Venezuelan guerrillas and sup
plied them with arms.
Break
For a time, in 1974 and 1975.
the two governments sought to
put aside their differences and
normalize relations, but they
broke sharply in 1976, following
the sabotage of a Cuban airliner
in which two Venezuelans were
accused of taking part.
Since then, the Caracas-Ha
vana relationship has never
progressed much past the cool
stage, and the two governments
have been rivals for regional
leadership.
Beyond his enmity with
Castro. Herrera is motivated by
his political relationship with
Duarte.
Both are Christian Demo
crats. a loosely defined political
movement that proclaims a
moderate, centrist philosophy.
Christian Democratic
groups, for example, includes
West Germany's main opposi
tion party and the majority par
ty in Italy.
In 1972. Duarte won the
Salvadoran presidency under
the Christian Democratic ban
ner But the military nullified
the returns and jailed Duarte.
On his release he went to Vene
zuela for seven years and at
tended a training school for
Christian Democrats in Cara
cas He and Herrera developed
a close relationship during that
time.
But beyond that, according to
a senior diplomat here, Herrera
sees Duarte's political ap
proach as the most important
alternative to Cuban-style
Marxism in El Salvador, as well
as an option to reactionary ex
tremism.
U.S. support
The United States has sup
ported the Herrera initiatives in
El Salvador, but that same ag
gressiveness has been shown in
Venezuela's backing of the
Nicaraguan junta, which has
caused concern in Washington.
The Herrera government has
carried out a large financial aid
program for the leftist Sand
inista regime that overthrew
the Nicaraguan dictatorship of
Anastasio Somoza more than
one year ago.
The objective of the aid. total
ing at least $120 million, is to
promote a moderate political
line in Nicaragua and to wean
the Sandinistas from Cuba.
Diplomatic observers say
Herrera is now concerned about
his Nicaragua policy because
the government there has shown
dictatorial tendencies and. per

haps worse, has been accused of
supporting Salvadoran leftists
Against Duarte
Nevertheless. Venezuela,
bothered though it may be, is
committed to supporting
Nicaragua's junta in hopes that
moderate forces there will push
for a pluralistic, multi-party
government, diplomats say.
Regional
Venezuelan leaders point out
that their regional concerns go
beyond El Salvador and
Nicaragua.
. For example, they point out
that Herrera has sent high of
ficials to Jamaica to negotiate
aid for the new moderate gov
ernment of Edward Seaga. who
recently defeated leftist Prime
Minister Michael Manley, an
ally of Castro.
Officials in the Foreign Min
istry also cite a program they
developed with Mexico to give
low-interest loans to nations of
the region to help them buy
Mexican and Venezuelan oil.
Although Venezuela has eco
nomic problems at home — a
staggering foreign debt that

soaks up about 26 percent of its
entire $16 billion budget, infla
tion of more than 20 percent a
year and unemployment of up to
23 percent in some areas — the
government has committed
nearly $6 5 billion to foreign aid
in the last six years
Venezuela sees itself as a
leader of the underdeveloped
world and sometimes speaks
loftily about the need for poorer
countries to aid one another, but
its aid policies are not entirely
altruistic.
"No. when it comes down to
it, it is done in our own self-in
terest." one Venezuelan official
said. "We want democracy for
ourselves. We had years and
years of dictators and we want
no more.
"But if we are going to keep
some of our own people from
getting the idea that overthrow
ing governments is the way to
solve problems, we have to
make sure such tactics fail
elsewhere.
"That is why we work to pre
vent anti-democratic move
ments in other countries, to stop
them from spreading here.''
