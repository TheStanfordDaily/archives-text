# Israel-proven weapons industry means big business

Military correspondent. The Jerusalem Post
Jerusalem — The Mexican minister of
defense visited Israel in mid-January as
the head of a 16-man military delegation,
ostensibly to visit military installations,
but in fact to discuss the potential
purchase of 24 Israeli-made Kfir fighter
aircraft. He arrived hot on the heels of
his Colombian counterpart, and just two
months after the departure of the South
African finance minister.
This together with the recent an
nouncement by Israeli Deputy Defense
Minister Mordechai Zippori that Israel
this year will sell a projected $1.25 billion
in arms (more than twice the total of the
previous year) and a recently published
report that Israel is now the third largest
seller of arms to the Third World, has
highlighted this nation's seeming
metamorphosis from the People of the
Book to one of the world's major arms
suppliers.
It is a strange role for the Jewish peo
ple, which has traditionally seen itself as
"a light unto the nations."
The decision to establish a significant
arms industry in Israel was taken after
the French — until 1968 Israel's major
supplier of arms — decided shortly after
the Six Day War to clamp an embargo on
all arms sales to the Jewish state. Israel
had not yet established any military rela
tionship with the United States, and it
seemed as if other Europen nations could
not be relied upon for Israel's defense
needs.
It was not an easy decision. Israel was
dependent on foreign aid to maintain a
delicate balance of power with six major
confrontation states still in a declared
state of war with Israel. At the same
time, Israel was absorbing thousands of
refugees each year. There was no exist
ing industrial infrastructure, and no pool
of trained manpower capable of under
taking the assignment. Furthermore, it
was clear that unless Israel were able to
offset some of the development and man
ufacturing costs by exporting its arms,
the economic burden on the already over

extended economy would be too great.
Many argued against the effort, in
cluding former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, who felt that Israel had no right
venturing into the realm of aircraft and
missile manufacture.
And indeed. Israel today has over a
dozen military industries employing
about 20.000 workers to produce several
types of military aircraft, four missile
boat models. Ultra-sophisticated elec
tronic and avionic equipment, air-to-air
missiles, sea-to-sea missiles, rockets,
tanks, artillery pieces, rifles, automatic
weapons and ammunition for almost ev
ery conceivable weapon.
It is in the process of developing a
third-generation of fighter aircraft,
which it intends to market against North
rop's F-5G and General Dynamics' F-16,
and there are high hopes here that an ex
port order will finally be signed with
Mexico for the Kf ir. which has an Ameri
can J-79 engine. (The sale of 12 Kfirs to
Equador was blocked in 1977 by Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's human-rights poli
cy, which forbade the transfer of Ameri
can technology to repressive regimes.)
Weapons merchant
Nevertheless, one could hardly place
Israel in the front rank of international
weapons merchants. Its total military
exports for fiscal 1980-81, for example,
amount to slightly more than the value of
aircraft sold by Switzerland to Iraq in
1979. and are the equivalent of last year's
sales by Italy to Libya. Israel still has a
long way to go before it can equal the ef
forts of any of the European in
dustrialized nations, including the sup
posed neutrals, and even those of Brazil.
In fact. Israel's entire weapons produc
tion effort is less than that of any one of
the dozen private American companies.
McDonnell Douglas alone, for example,
employs more workers than do all of Is
rael's military industries combined.
It is not even certain whether Israel's
sophisticated weapons are paying for
themselves through exports, as Peres
thought they would. The truth of the mat
ter is that, apart from those arms deals

officially announced by the various gov
ernments involved, we know very little
about who sells what to whom. And there
are few things Israel is more secretive
about than what it sells.
The reason for this is clear: Almost all
of Israel's clients are subject to Arab
pressure; publicity can only jeopardize
sales.
Yet the image is undeniably there: not
only of Israel as successful mini-arms
factory working at full capacity to pro
vide all those willing to pay with modern

Commentary

instruments of death, but also as a coun
try that has become associated with sup
plying repressive and regressive re
gimes around the world with sophisti
cated weapons.
The international press has been re
porting for several years now that Israel
has become a major supplier of weapons
to South Africa. Chile. Argentina.
Bolivia, El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Equador, to name but a few.
If we are to believe Newsweek, the
reach of this country's salesmen has ex
tended to China, Taiwan, Singapore.
Malaysia and Indonesia. Other journals,
most of them knowledgeable, have Israel
conducting a roaring arms trade with
several African nations, and recently Is
rael was accused of going so far as to sell
arms to Khomeini's Iran.
Many of these countries to which Is
rael allegedly sells arms do not have dip
lomatic relations with Israel. Some to
this day even refuse to recognize it as an
independent Jewish state.
One reason that so many governments
find Israeli weapons attractive is that
they are battle-proven. In contrast to
many other arms-exporting nations, Is
rael develops primarily systems that it
needs for its own defense.
But this has also led to problems, and a
perennial argument between the Israel
armed forces, which want to keep Is
rael's military development as secret as
possible, and the arms manufacturers,

who, in order to sell, must extoll the vir
tues of their wares by describing their
combat performance to potential clients
— including those that have no diplomat
ic ties with Israel, and even some closely
aligned with the Arab bloc.
Development
Many people here, both inside and out
side the defense establishment, ques
tion the continued wisdom of developing
Israel's military industrial infrastruc
ture. They believe that the price, espe
cially since the failure to market the
Kfir. has been too high.
In contrast to the weapons Israel
purchases from the United States, which
are financed primarily by a $2 billion aid
package, all locally developed arms are
financed from a defense budget which
alredy constitutes 40 percent of the over
extended national budget. And despite
the image Israel has of being a major
supplier of weapons to the world, the
sorry fact is that it has not managed to
sell its main systems — the Kfir and the
Merkava tank.
There is another consideration which
seems to be dominating official think
ing. that the qualitative advantage Is
rael has enjoyed over the Arab confrota
tion states for three decades is being
negated by the accelerated flow of so
phisticated weapons to these states from
the West.
Israel has purchased F-15s. So has
Saudi Arabia. Israel has Phantoms. So
does Egypt. Israel dwns improved Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles. So does Jordan.
The Western world's most sophisticated
tanks, artillery, anti-tank missiles,
radar, missile boats and "smart"
bombs, are flowing into the Middle East
as fast as Arab petrodollars can
purchase them. A parallel flow of Soviet
weapons is streaming into Moscow's al
lies in the region.
The growing sophistication of the
weapons and their simplified main
tenance procedures now found on both
sides of the border has almost negated Is
rael's longstanding qualitative edge over
the Arab states.

The decision to establish a significant
arms industry in Israel was taken after
the French — until 1968 Israel's major
supplier of arms — decided shortly after
the Six Day War to clamp an embargo on
all arms sales to the Jewish state. Israel
had not yet established any military rela
tionship with the United States, and it
seemed as if other Europen nations could
not be relied upon for Israel's defense
needs.
It was not an easy decision. Israel was
dependent on foreign aid to maintain a
delicate balance of power with six major
confrontation states still in a declared
state of war with Israel. At the same
time, Israel was absorbing thousands of
refugees each year. There was no exist
ing industrial infrastructure, and no pool
of trained manpower capable of under
taking the assignment. Furthermore, it
was clear that unless Israel were able to
offset some of the development and man
ufacturing costs by exporting its arms,
the economic burden on the already over

extended economy would be too great.
Many argued against the effort, in
cluding former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, who felt that Israel had no right
venturing into the realm of aircraft and
missile manufacture.
And indeed. Israel today has over a
dozen military industries employing
about 20.000 workers to produce several
types of military aircraft, four missile
boat models. Ultra-sophisticated elec
tronic and avionic equipment, air-to-air
missiles, sea-to-sea missiles, rockets,
tanks, artillery pieces, rifles, automatic
weapons and ammunition for almost ev
ery conceivable weapon.
It is in the process of developing a
third-generation of fighter aircraft,
which it intends to market against North
rop's F-5G and General Dynamics' F-16,
and there are high hopes here that an ex
port order will finally be signed with
Mexico for the Kf ir. which has an Ameri
can J-79 engine. (The sale of 12 Kfirs to
Equador was blocked in 1977 by Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's human-rights poli
cy, which forbade the transfer of Ameri
can technology to repressive regimes.)
Weapons merchant
Nevertheless, one could hardly place
Israel in the front rank of international
weapons merchants. Its total military
exports for fiscal 1980-81, for example,
amount to slightly more than the value of
aircraft sold by Switzerland to Iraq in
1979. and are the equivalent of last year's
sales by Italy to Libya. Israel still has a
long way to go before it can equal the ef
forts of any of the European in
dustrialized nations, including the sup
posed neutrals, and even those of Brazil.
In fact. Israel's entire weapons produc
tion effort is less than that of any one of
the dozen private American companies.
McDonnell Douglas alone, for example,
employs more workers than do all of Is
rael's military industries combined.
It is not even certain whether Israel's
sophisticated weapons are paying for
themselves through exports, as Peres
thought they would. The truth of the mat
ter is that, apart from those arms deals

officially announced by the various gov
ernments involved, we know very little
about who sells what to whom. And there
are few things Israel is more secretive
about than what it sells.
The reason for this is clear: Almost all
of Israel's clients are subject to Arab
pressure; publicity can only jeopardize
sales.
Yet the image is undeniably there: not
only of Israel as successful mini-arms
factory working at full capacity to pro
vide all those willing to pay with modern

Commentary

instruments of death, but also as a coun
try that has become associated with sup
plying repressive and regressive re
gimes around the world with sophisti
cated weapons.
The international press has been re
porting for several years now that Israel
has become a major supplier of weapons
to South Africa. Chile. Argentina.
Bolivia, El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Equador, to name but a few.
If we are to believe Newsweek, the
reach of this country's salesmen has ex
tended to China, Taiwan, Singapore.
Malaysia and Indonesia. Other journals,
most of them knowledgeable, have Israel
conducting a roaring arms trade with
several African nations, and recently Is
rael was accused of going so far as to sell
arms to Khomeini's Iran.
Many of these countries to which Is
rael allegedly sells arms do not have dip
lomatic relations with Israel. Some to
this day even refuse to recognize it as an
independent Jewish state.
One reason that so many governments
find Israeli weapons attractive is that
they are battle-proven. In contrast to
many other arms-exporting nations, Is
rael develops primarily systems that it
needs for its own defense.
But this has also led to problems, and a
perennial argument between the Israel
armed forces, which want to keep Is
rael's military development as secret as
possible, and the arms manufacturers,

who, in order to sell, must extoll the vir
tues of their wares by describing their
combat performance to potential clients
— including those that have no diplomat
ic ties with Israel, and even some closely
aligned with the Arab bloc.
Development
Many people here, both inside and out
side the defense establishment, ques
tion the continued wisdom of developing
Israel's military industrial infrastruc
ture. They believe that the price, espe
cially since the failure to market the
Kfir. has been too high.
In contrast to the weapons Israel
purchases from the United States, which
are financed primarily by a $2 billion aid
package, all locally developed arms are
financed from a defense budget which
alredy constitutes 40 percent of the over
extended national budget. And despite
the image Israel has of being a major
supplier of weapons to the world, the
sorry fact is that it has not managed to
sell its main systems — the Kfir and the
Merkava tank.
There is another consideration which
seems to be dominating official think
ing. that the qualitative advantage Is
rael has enjoyed over the Arab confrota
tion states for three decades is being
negated by the accelerated flow of so
phisticated weapons to these states from
the West.
Israel has purchased F-15s. So has
Saudi Arabia. Israel has Phantoms. So
does Egypt. Israel dwns improved Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles. So does Jordan.
The Western world's most sophisticated
tanks, artillery, anti-tank missiles,
radar, missile boats and "smart"
bombs, are flowing into the Middle East
as fast as Arab petrodollars can
purchase them. A parallel flow of Soviet
weapons is streaming into Moscow's al
lies in the region.
The growing sophistication of the
weapons and their simplified main
tenance procedures now found on both
sides of the border has almost negated Is
rael's longstanding qualitative edge over
the Arab states.

cluding former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, who felt that Israel had no right
venturing into the realm of aircraft and
missile manufacture.
And indeed. Israel today has over a
dozen military industries employing
about 20.000 workers to produce several
types of military aircraft, four missile
boat models. Ultra-sophisticated elec
tronic and avionic equipment, air-to-air
missiles, sea-to-sea missiles, rockets,
tanks, artillery pieces, rifles, automatic
weapons and ammunition for almost ev
ery conceivable weapon.
It is in the process of developing a
third-generation of fighter aircraft,
which it intends to market against North
rop's F-5G and General Dynamics' F-16,
and there are high hopes here that an ex
port order will finally be signed with
Mexico for the Kf ir. which has an Ameri
can J-79 engine. (The sale of 12 Kfirs to
Equador was blocked in 1977 by Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's human-rights poli
cy, which forbade the transfer of Ameri
can technology to repressive regimes.)
Weapons merchant
Nevertheless, one could hardly place
Israel in the front rank of international
weapons merchants. Its total military
exports for fiscal 1980-81, for example,
amount to slightly more than the value of
aircraft sold by Switzerland to Iraq in
1979. and are the equivalent of last year's
sales by Italy to Libya. Israel still has a
long way to go before it can equal the ef
forts of any of the European in
dustrialized nations, including the sup
posed neutrals, and even those of Brazil.
In fact. Israel's entire weapons produc
tion effort is less than that of any one of
the dozen private American companies.
McDonnell Douglas alone, for example,
employs more workers than do all of Is
rael's military industries combined.
It is not even certain whether Israel's
sophisticated weapons are paying for
themselves through exports, as Peres
thought they would. The truth of the mat
ter is that, apart from those arms deals

officially announced by the various gov
ernments involved, we know very little
about who sells what to whom. And there
are few things Israel is more secretive
about than what it sells.
The reason for this is clear: Almost all
of Israel's clients are subject to Arab
pressure; publicity can only jeopardize
sales.
Yet the image is undeniably there: not
only of Israel as successful mini-arms
factory working at full capacity to pro
vide all those willing to pay with modern

instruments of death, but also as a coun
try that has become associated with sup
plying repressive and regressive re
gimes around the world with sophisti
cated weapons.
The international press has been re
porting for several years now that Israel
has become a major supplier of weapons
to South Africa. Chile. Argentina.
Bolivia, El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Equador, to name but a few.
If we are to believe Newsweek, the
reach of this country's salesmen has ex
tended to China, Taiwan, Singapore.
Malaysia and Indonesia. Other journals,
most of them knowledgeable, have Israel
conducting a roaring arms trade with
several African nations, and recently Is
rael was accused of going so far as to sell
arms to Khomeini's Iran.
Many of these countries to which Is
rael allegedly sells arms do not have dip
lomatic relations with Israel. Some to
this day even refuse to recognize it as an
independent Jewish state.
One reason that so many governments
find Israeli weapons attractive is that
they are battle-proven. In contrast to
many other arms-exporting nations, Is
rael develops primarily systems that it
needs for its own defense.
But this has also led to problems, and a
perennial argument between the Israel
armed forces, which want to keep Is
rael's military development as secret as
possible, and the arms manufacturers,

who, in order to sell, must extoll the vir
tues of their wares by describing their
combat performance to potential clients
— including those that have no diplomat
ic ties with Israel, and even some closely
aligned with the Arab bloc.
Development
Many people here, both inside and out
side the defense establishment, ques
tion the continued wisdom of developing
Israel's military industrial infrastruc
ture. They believe that the price, espe
cially since the failure to market the
Kfir. has been too high.
In contrast to the weapons Israel
purchases from the United States, which
are financed primarily by a $2 billion aid
package, all locally developed arms are
financed from a defense budget which
alredy constitutes 40 percent of the over
extended national budget. And despite
the image Israel has of being a major
supplier of weapons to the world, the
sorry fact is that it has not managed to
sell its main systems — the Kfir and the
Merkava tank.
There is another consideration which
seems to be dominating official think
ing. that the qualitative advantage Is
rael has enjoyed over the Arab confrota
tion states for three decades is being
negated by the accelerated flow of so
phisticated weapons to these states from
the West.
Israel has purchased F-15s. So has
Saudi Arabia. Israel has Phantoms. So
does Egypt. Israel dwns improved Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles. So does Jordan.
The Western world's most sophisticated
tanks, artillery, anti-tank missiles,
radar, missile boats and "smart"
bombs, are flowing into the Middle East
as fast as Arab petrodollars can
purchase them. A parallel flow of Soviet
weapons is streaming into Moscow's al
lies in the region.
The growing sophistication of the
weapons and their simplified main
tenance procedures now found on both
sides of the border has almost negated Is
rael's longstanding qualitative edge over
the Arab states.
