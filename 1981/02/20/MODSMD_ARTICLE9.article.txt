# CROW presents Prof. Catherine MacKinnon
## Men and women: a culture barrier 
### Louise Solomon 
Visiting Professor Catherine
Mackinnon told a large audience
in Terman Auditorium Wednes
day that as far as sexuality is
concerned, women and men
"live in different cultures."
Speaking about sexual
harassment, Mackinnon de
clared that men do not consider
their actions to be menacing or
injurious, rather they consider
them innocuous, funny, even af
fectionate. But women may con
sider the same actions mali

cious and threatening, she said
Mackinnon related an inci
dent in a movie script to ex
emplify the differences in the
male/female perspectives. In
the script, a woman who was
getting her laundry out of the
dryer found that the crotch and
nipples had been cut out of all of
her underclothing Mackinnon
asked her predominantly
female audience if anyone
thought the incident was funny;
no one said anything She main
tained that men would often find

this incident amusing whereas
women would find it terrifying.
She said she could believe that a
man might be able to empathize
and find it offensive, but not
frightening

"Men do not consider their actions to be menacing
or injurious; rather they consider them innocuous,
Junny, even affectionate ..."

Mackinnon, who received her
law degree from Yale while si
multaneously working on her
Ph.D., maintained that one
must look at the problem of sex
ual harassment politically and
socially as well as legally. She
warned that the greatest danger
is the belief that women should
feel outraged only when their
outrage is confirmed by the le
gal system.
"Sexual harassment is im
posed on someone not able to re
fuse it," Mackinnon said, add
ing that "this definition raises a
vast array of questions that
need to be answered." It is dif
ficult to determine exactly what
is or is not sexual, Mackinnon
suggested, reiterating that it de
pends on the point of view of the
individual observer.
She also noted that if a woman

considers certain behavior sex
ual, it does not necessarily
mean that she is turned on by
it."
Addressing the accusation
that women sometimes "ask for

it," Mackinnon declared that
certain manners of demeanor
are often necessary to get a job,
citing the dress codes for secre
taries and receptionists which
require short skirts and tight
pants as examples She also said
that waitresses "must learn to
be sexually inviting while re
maining unavailable" in order
to survive.
Mackinnon questioned how
resistance is to be determined,
noting that tolerance is often
necessary to keep one's job. She
declared that "sexual harass
ment is a question of power,"
and then went on to say that the
most important action a woman
can take is to complain. "Wom
en who feel like they have to go
along with harassment are often
the most injured, but have the
least case," she said.
