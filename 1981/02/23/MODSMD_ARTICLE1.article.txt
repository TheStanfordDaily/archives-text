# Cards stun UCLA and fans with thrilling 74-72 victory
## 
### Chris Haft 
A host of Stanford athletes — Olym
pians, NCAA champions, All-Ameri
cans — were honored for their
achievements during halftime of Sat
urday night's men's basketball game
at Maples Pavilion.
Meanwhile, the evening's real he
roes waited in the locker room.
Upon emerging, the Cardinals out
shot, out-hustled and ultimately out
lasted sixth-ranked UCLA, 74-72, end
ing a four-game losing streak and
transporting themselves and most of
the 6917 witnesses into utter jubila
tion.
"I think it was a great win for Stan
ford — not so much because we won,
but because of the way we controlled
the game the whole way," head coach
Dick Dißiaso said.
Indeed, the Cards did nearly ev
erything they could to create their up
set victory:
—They blended their youth and ex
perience fabulously. Freshmen Keith
Jones, Hans Wichary and John Revelli
accounted for 53 of Stanford's points
while juniors Doug Marty and Brian
Welch kept the offense and defense
functioning smoothly. "I thought Mar
ty and Welch held the team together,"
UCLA head coach Larry Brown ob
served.
—They battled the Bruins to a
standoff on the boards, 31-31. "That
was the most important thing," Welch

said. "We blocked out really well, as
opposed to Thursday (when USC, a
small but quick and high-leaping team
like UCLA, destroyed Stanford with
its rebounding). We didn't give them
that many second shots."
—They received a superb individual
effort from Jones. The 6-foot-2 guard
scored a collegiate career-high 23
points by sinking nine of 10 shots and
five of six free throws. He also had
four steals. Most of Jones's points
came on driving layins past Bruin
guards heralded for their quickness.
"They're always saying that UCLA
has super-quick players, and I felt like
I could get around them, which I did,"
he said.
—They refrained from committing
the excess of turnovers which almost
always victimizes them, making only
12 such errors. "We were getting bet
ter movement and making passes
more sure tonight," Marty said.
Crazy last minute
Both teams, however, contributed
to the frenzy of the final minute. For
the Cards, it was a wild frenzy. They
missed four of six free throws and
made a turnover allowing UCLA to cut
their lead to one point.
For the Bruins, it was a controlled
frenzy. Rod Foster, whose 24 points
led all scorers, introduced the last
minute by sinking a 21-foot jumper
and added two free throws with 31 sec

onds left Sandwiching a Peter Lallas
free throw. Foster's four points nar
rowed a 72-66 Stanford advantage to
73-70.
After Foster's free throws. UCLA's
harrassing full-court press forced
Lallas to hurl an errant pass that
guard Michael Holton intercepted
Mike Sanders's ensuing lay in made it
73-72 with 19 seconds to go.
Stanford's chance to increase its
slim lead failed when Revelli. sent to
the free-throw line after being shoved
by Darren Daye on an in-bounds play,
missed the front end of a one-and-one
Holton grabbed Revelli's miss and
quickly fired the ball to Foster. Driv
ing up the right side, the 6-foot-l flash
tried a running jumper with about 10
seconds left but instead met the 6-
foot-9 Wichary, who turned in the most
important blocked shot of his career
"All I could do was go for the
block," Wichary said. "I knew 1
couldn't let him shoot it, because he
had hit three or four in a row and 1 fig
ured he would hit it again I just went
up and stuck my hand up "
Wichary grabbed his own rejection
— an equally difficult play — and
passed downcourt to Marty, who hit a
breakaway layup but had to settle for
making one of two free throws, since
the officials ruled that Daye had inten
tionally fouled him with five seconds
left.

Ryan and his teammates after the game.
After Marty's second free
throw, the one he made,
Holton sped downcourt
toward the middle of the
free-throw lane, where he en
countered Marty and Lallas.
The trio appeared to collide.
Holton jumped up between
the two Cards and, with noth
ing better to do, fired the ball
out ot bounds just before the
final horn sounded.
'' I should have shot a jump
shot, but I decided there was
room between them to go to
the basket." Holton said.
Referring to the contact
with Marty and Lallas.
Holton claimed the officials
should have made some kind
of call. "I think it was either
a charge or a block." he said.
"I'd have to see it again to be
sure, but it wasn't a 'no
call.' "
The officials weren't the
only ones guilty of inaction.
Holton added.
"We waited too long to get
involved in the game." he
said. "Nowadays, you just
can't do that in basketball.
You just can't wait until
(there are) seven minutes
left and turn it on."

By contrast, the Cards
never waited to turn it on
when they had to. particular
ly after intermission.
When Holton and Dave
opened the second half with
baskets snapping a 38-38 tie.
Bruin domination seemed
imminent.
But after the next three
minutes, Bruin domination
seemed distant The Cards
tallied the next 10 points to
take a 48-42 lead Fittingly,
the trio that did most of the
scoring was responsible for
the offense in this span.
Revelli, who totaled 16
points, began the streak by
following in a missed shot.
Jones contributed a squirm
ing jumper Wichary, who
added 14 points, notched six
during this stretch on a steal
and full-court lavup, a short
turn-around jumper and a 16-
foot banker that waddled
around the hoop before fall
ing through.
The Bruins closed to
within 50-48 moments later,
but Stanford responded by
scoring 12 of the next 18
points, extending its lead to
63-54 with barely less than
nine minutes left.
At about this time Jones

realized that the Cards would
almost certainly win "Rod
(Foster) and Holton had the
scare' in their eyes." he
said.
The crowd, meanwhile,
sensed victory almost im
mediately, as Stanford as
sumed a 12-3 lead with only
3:26 elapsed. Thus aroused,
the audience almost never
quieted, raising dins rarely
heard in Maples basketball
games.
"I wish the crowd was like
this every game." Welch
said "It felt like we were
playing at home for once."
Notes: Stanford is now 4-11
in the Pacific-10 Conference
and 8-16 overall. UCLA is 10-4
and 17-5. . .Marty has fig
ured prominently in most of
the Cards' triumphs. Besides
scoring 11 points and making
a key free throw with five
seconds to play Saturday
night, he scored a team-high
12 points against Air Force
(58-52). netted a career-high
14 against UC-Davis (68-62),
hit an important free throw
in the waning moments of the
Washington State victory
(62-60) and sank the last-sec
ond. game-winning lavup
against Oregon (80-79).

"I think it was a great win for Stan

Indeed, the Cards did nearly ev

—They blended their youth and ex

Jones, Hans Wichary and John Revelli
accounted for 53 of Stanford's points

Welch kept the offense and defense
functioning smoothly. "I thought Mar

UCLA head coach Larry Brown ob

—They battled the Bruins to a

was the most important thing," Welch

said. "We blocked out really well, as
opposed to Thursday (when USC, a
small but quick and high-leaping team
like UCLA, destroyed Stanford with
its rebounding). We didn't give them
that many second shots."
—They received a superb individual
effort from Jones. The 6-foot-2 guard
scored a collegiate career-high 23
points by sinking nine of 10 shots and
five of six free throws. He also had
four steals. Most of Jones's points
came on driving layins past Bruin
guards heralded for their quickness.
"They're always saying that UCLA
has super-quick players, and I felt like
I could get around them, which I did,"
he said.
—They refrained from committing
the excess of turnovers which almost
always victimizes them, making only
12 such errors. "We were getting bet

Crazy last minute
Both teams, however, contributed
to the frenzy of the final minute. For
the Cards, it was a wild frenzy. They
missed four of six free throws and
made a turnover allowing UCLA to cut
their lead to one point.
For the Bruins, it was a controlled
frenzy. Rod Foster, whose 24 points
led all scorers, introduced the last
minute by sinking a 21-foot jumper
and added two free throws with 31 sec

onds left Sandwiching a Peter Lallas
free throw. Foster's four points nar
rowed a 72-66 Stanford advantage to
73-70.
After Foster's free throws. UCLA's
harrassing full-court press forced
Lallas to hurl an errant pass that
guard Michael Holton intercepted
Mike Sanders's ensuing lay in made it
73-72 with 19 seconds to go.
Stanford's chance to increase its
slim lead failed when Revelli. sent to
the free-throw line after being shoved
by Darren Daye on an in-bounds play,
missed the front end of a one-and-one
Holton grabbed Revelli's miss and
quickly fired the ball to Foster. Driv
ing up the right side, the 6-foot-l flash
tried a running jumper with about 10
seconds left but instead met the 6-
foot-9 Wichary, who turned in the most
important blocked shot of his career
"All I could do was go for the
block," Wichary said. "I knew 1
couldn't let him shoot it, because he
had hit three or four in a row and 1 fig
ured he would hit it again I just went
up and stuck my hand up "
Wichary grabbed his own rejection
— an equally difficult play — and
passed downcourt to Marty, who hit a
breakaway layup but had to settle for
making one of two free throws, since
the officials ruled that Daye had inten

left.

After Marty's second free
throw, the one he made,
Holton sped downcourt
toward the middle of the
free-throw lane, where he en
countered Marty and Lallas.
The trio appeared to collide.
Holton jumped up between
the two Cards and, with noth

out ot bounds just before the
final horn sounded.
'' I should have shot a jump
shot, but I decided there was

"I'd have to see it again to be

The officials weren't the
only ones guilty of inaction.
Holton added.
"We waited too long to get
involved in the game." he
said. "Nowadays, you just
can't do that in basketball.
You just can't wait until
(there are) seven minutes
left and turn it on."

By contrast, the Cards
never waited to turn it on
when they had to. particular

When Holton and Dave
opened the second half with
baskets snapping a 38-38 tie.
Bruin domination seemed
imminent.
But after the next three
minutes, Bruin domination
seemed distant The Cards
tallied the next 10 points to
take a 48-42 lead Fittingly,
the trio that did most of the
scoring was responsible for
the offense in this span.
Revelli, who totaled 16
points, began the streak by
following in a missed shot.
Jones contributed a squirm

added 14 points, notched six
during this stretch on a steal
and full-court lavup, a short
turn-around jumper and a 16-
foot banker that waddled
around the hoop before fall

The Bruins closed to

sure, but it wasn't a 'no
call.' "
The officials weren't the
only ones guilty of inaction.
Holton added.
"We waited too long to get
involved in the game." he
said. "Nowadays, you just
can't do that in basketball.
You just can't wait until
(there are) seven minutes
left and turn it on."

By contrast, the Cards
never waited to turn it on
when they had to. particular
ly after intermission.
When Holton and Dave
opened the second half with
baskets snapping a 38-38 tie.
Bruin domination seemed
imminent.
But after the next three
minutes, Bruin domination
seemed distant The Cards
tallied the next 10 points to
take a 48-42 lead Fittingly,
the trio that did most of the
scoring was responsible for
the offense in this span.
Revelli, who totaled 16
points, began the streak by
following in a missed shot.
Jones contributed a squirm
ing jumper Wichary, who
added 14 points, notched six
during this stretch on a steal
and full-court lavup, a short
turn-around jumper and a 16-
foot banker that waddled
around the hoop before fall
ing through.
The Bruins closed to
within 50-48 moments later,
but Stanford responded by
scoring 12 of the next 18
points, extending its lead to
63-54 with barely less than
nine minutes left.
At about this time Jones

realized that the Cards would
almost certainly win "Rod
(Foster) and Holton had the
scare' in their eyes." he
said.
The crowd, meanwhile,
sensed victory almost im
mediately, as Stanford as
sumed a 12-3 lead with only
3:26 elapsed. Thus aroused,
the audience almost never
quieted, raising dins rarely
heard in Maples basketball
games.
"I wish the crowd was like
this every game." Welch
said "It felt like we were
playing at home for once."
Notes: Stanford is now 4-11
in the Pacific-10 Conference
and 8-16 overall. UCLA is 10-4
and 17-5. . .Marty has fig
ured prominently in most of
the Cards' triumphs. Besides
scoring 11 points and making
a key free throw with five
seconds to play Saturday
night, he scored a team-high
12 points against Air Force
(58-52). netted a career-high
14 against UC-Davis (68-62),
hit an important free throw
in the waning moments of the
Washington State victory
(62-60) and sank the last-sec
ond. game-winning lavup
against Oregon (80-79).

Freshman forward Hans Wichary drives to the hoop in the Cards dramatic 74-72 victory over
UCLA. Wichary later blocked a Rod Foster shot with eight seconds left to preserve the win.
A host of Stanford athletes — Olym
pians, NCAA champions, All-Ameri
cans — were honored for their
achievements during halftime of Sat
urday night's men's basketball game
at Maples Pavilion.
Meanwhile, the evening's real he
roes waited in the locker room.
Upon emerging, the Cardinals out
shot, out-hustled and ultimately out
lasted sixth-ranked UCLA, 74-72, end
ing a four-game losing streak and
transporting themselves and most of
the 6917 witnesses into utter jubila
tion.
"I think it was a great win for Stan
ford — not so much because we won,
but because of the way we controlled
the game the whole way," head coach
Dick Dißiaso said.
Indeed, the Cards did nearly ev
erything they could to create their up
set victory:
—They blended their youth and ex
perience fabulously. Freshmen Keith
Jones, Hans Wichary and John Revelli
accounted for 53 of Stanford's points
while juniors Doug Marty and Brian
Welch kept the offense and defense
functioning smoothly. "I thought Mar
ty and Welch held the team together,"
UCLA head coach Larry Brown ob
served.
—They battled the Bruins to a
standoff on the boards, 31-31. "That
was the most important thing," Welch

said. "We blocked out really well, as
opposed to Thursday (when USC, a
small but quick and high-leaping team
like UCLA, destroyed Stanford with
its rebounding). We didn't give them
that many second shots."
—They received a superb individual
effort from Jones. The 6-foot-2 guard
scored a collegiate career-high 23
points by sinking nine of 10 shots and
five of six free throws. He also had
four steals. Most of Jones's points
came on driving layins past Bruin
guards heralded for their quickness.
"They're always saying that UCLA
has super-quick players, and I felt like
I could get around them, which I did,"
he said.
—They refrained from committing
the excess of turnovers which almost
always victimizes them, making only
12 such errors. "We were getting bet
ter movement and making passes
more sure tonight," Marty said.
Crazy last minute
Both teams, however, contributed
to the frenzy of the final minute. For
the Cards, it was a wild frenzy. They
missed four of six free throws and
made a turnover allowing UCLA to cut
their lead to one point.
For the Bruins, it was a controlled
frenzy. Rod Foster, whose 24 points
led all scorers, introduced the last
minute by sinking a 21-foot jumper
and added two free throws with 31 sec

onds left Sandwiching a Peter Lallas
free throw. Foster's four points nar
rowed a 72-66 Stanford advantage to
73-70.
After Foster's free throws. UCLA's
harrassing full-court press forced
Lallas to hurl an errant pass that
guard Michael Holton intercepted
Mike Sanders's ensuing lay in made it
73-72 with 19 seconds to go.
Stanford's chance to increase its
slim lead failed when Revelli. sent to
the free-throw line after being shoved
by Darren Daye on an in-bounds play,
missed the front end of a one-and-one
Holton grabbed Revelli's miss and
quickly fired the ball to Foster. Driv
ing up the right side, the 6-foot-l flash
tried a running jumper with about 10
seconds left but instead met the 6-
foot-9 Wichary, who turned in the most
important blocked shot of his career
"All I could do was go for the
block," Wichary said. "I knew 1
couldn't let him shoot it, because he
had hit three or four in a row and 1 fig
ured he would hit it again I just went
up and stuck my hand up "
Wichary grabbed his own rejection
— an equally difficult play — and
passed downcourt to Marty, who hit a
breakaway layup but had to settle for
making one of two free throws, since
the officials ruled that Daye had inten
tionally fouled him with five seconds
left.


Saturday night was all right for Cardinal basketball fans

Maples Pavilion spectators mobbed Card forward Jeff
Ryan and his teammates after the game.
After Marty's second free
throw, the one he made,
Holton sped downcourt
toward the middle of the
free-throw lane, where he en
countered Marty and Lallas.
The trio appeared to collide.
Holton jumped up between
the two Cards and, with noth
ing better to do, fired the ball
out ot bounds just before the
final horn sounded.
'' I should have shot a jump
shot, but I decided there was
room between them to go to
the basket." Holton said.
Referring to the contact
with Marty and Lallas.
Holton claimed the officials
should have made some kind
of call. "I think it was either
a charge or a block." he said.
"I'd have to see it again to be
sure, but it wasn't a 'no
call.' "
The officials weren't the
only ones guilty of inaction.
Holton added.
"We waited too long to get
involved in the game." he
said. "Nowadays, you just
can't do that in basketball.
