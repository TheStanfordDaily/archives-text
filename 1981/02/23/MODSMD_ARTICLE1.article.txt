A host of Stanford athletes — Olym
pians, NCAA champions, All-Ameri
cans — were honored for their
achievements during halftime of Sat
urday night's men's basketball game
at Maples Pavilion.
Meanwhile, the evening's real he
roes waited in the locker room.
Upon emerging, the Cardinals out
shot, out-hustled and ultimately out
lasted sixth-ranked UCLA, 74-72, end
ing a four-game losing streak and
transporting themselves and most of
the 6917 witnesses into utter jubila
tion.
"I think it was a great win for Stan
ford — not so much because we won,
but because of the way we controlled
the game the whole way," head coach
Dick Dißiaso said.
Indeed, the Cards did nearly ev
erything they could to create their up
set victory:
—They blended their youth and ex
perience fabulously. Freshmen Keith
Jones, Hans Wichary and John Revelli
accounted for 53 of Stanford's points
while juniors Doug Marty and Brian
Welch kept the offense and defense
functioning smoothly. "I thought Mar
ty and Welch held the team together,"
UCLA head coach Larry Brown ob
served.
—They battled the Bruins to a
standoff on the boards, 31-31. "That
was the most important thing," Welch

said. "We blocked out really well, as
opposed to Thursday (when USC, a
small but quick and high-leaping team
like UCLA, destroyed Stanford with
its rebounding). We didn't give them
that many second shots."
—They received a superb individual
effort from Jones. The 6-foot-2 guard
scored a collegiate career-high 23
points by sinking nine of 10 shots and
five of six free throws. He also had
four steals. Most of Jones's points
came on driving layins past Bruin
guards heralded for their quickness.
"They're always saying that UCLA
has super-quick players, and I felt like
I could get around them, which I did,"
he said.
—They refrained from committing
the excess of turnovers which almost
always victimizes them, making only
12 such errors. "We were getting bet
ter movement and making passes
more sure tonight," Marty said.
Crazy last minute
Both teams, however, contributed
to the frenzy of the final minute. For
the Cards, it was a wild frenzy. They
missed four of six free throws and
made a turnover allowing UCLA to cut
their lead to one point.
For the Bruins, it was a controlled
frenzy. Rod Foster, whose 24 points
led all scorers, introduced the last
minute by sinking a 21-foot jumper
and added two free throws with 31 sec

onds left Sandwiching a Peter Lallas
free throw. Foster's four points nar
rowed a 72-66 Stanford advantage to
73-70.
After Foster's free throws. UCLA's
harrassing full-court press forced
Lallas to hurl an errant pass that
guard Michael Holton intercepted
Mike Sanders's ensuing lay in made it
73-72 with 19 seconds to go.
Stanford's chance to increase its
slim lead failed when Revelli. sent to
the free-throw line after being shoved
by Darren Daye on an in-bounds play,
missed the front end of a one-and-one
Holton grabbed Revelli's miss and
quickly fired the ball to Foster. Driv
ing up the right side, the 6-foot-l flash
tried a running jumper with about 10
seconds left but instead met the 6-
foot-9 Wichary, who turned in the most
important blocked shot of his career
"All I could do was go for the
block," Wichary said. "I knew 1
couldn't let him shoot it, because he
had hit three or four in a row and 1 fig
ured he would hit it again I just went
up and stuck my hand up "
Wichary grabbed his own rejection
— an equally difficult play — and
passed downcourt to Marty, who hit a
breakaway layup but had to settle for
making one of two free throws, since
the officials ruled that Daye had inten
tionally fouled him with five seconds
left.
