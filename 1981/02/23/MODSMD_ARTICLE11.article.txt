According to Jane Holland of
Stanford Travel Associates, a
local travel agency, "Students
should be thinking now about
where they want to travel this
summer and how they're going
to get there."
Holland advises purchasing
your airline tickets as soon as
possible due to skyrocketing air
fares. Most airlines offer what
they call "APEX" fares which
are advanced purchase deals
that are subject to certain re
strictions. The tickets must be
round-trip, paid for at least
three weeks in advance. Depen
ding on where you travel, and
there are minimum and max
imum restrictions on length of
stay.
If you want a European vaca
tion this summer, APEX fares
apply to many of the Continent's
major cities. Venturing to Lon
don via TWA will cost approx
imately $772. Franfurt, Germa-

Ny, costs around $777, Paris
about $976, and if you feel like
taking in a little bit of Italian
culture, Rome will cost you a
mere $1034.
Prices vary among airlines,
and also vary as to whether you
depart mid-week or on the
weekend. For example, round
trip to Rome leaving on a Tues
day will cost you $1034, while
taking off on a Saturday jumps
the price up to $1211.
Another way to go is to fly
standby to London, reducing
your airfare by one half. Once in
London, you can catch a ferry to
the Continent and take the train
to the country of your choice.

Or if you'd rather go straight
to France, Air France is re
instituting its special
"Vacances" flights for the sum
mer of '81. This offer provides
low fare service between New
York and paris until mid-Octo
ber. A special "Vacances"
Youth Fare is available for
travelers aged 12 to 22. It is valid
for one year and for an addi
tional $50, allows an open and
confirmed return reservation.
The advantage of APEX fares
is that students can buy tickets
now for summer travel at cur
rent prices, thereby avoiding
higher costs due to inflation.
But there have been problems
with some airlines who force
passengers to pay the increase
even though they purchased
their tickets in advance. KLM
Airlines and Swiss Airlines both
refuse to guarantee APEX
fares. According to Stanford
Travel Associates, most other
major airlines do guarantee
that the price you pay in ad-

vance will hold.
If you are willing to put up
with a little inconvenience,
many airlines provide budget
fares for considerbly less than
APEX fares. The only com
plications are that tickets must
be purchased 21 days in advance
and although you pick the week,
the airlines specify which day
you will leave. These fares run
$568 to London, $934 to Rome
and $790 to Frankfurt for round
trips.
Another way to save money is
to contact the Council of In
ternational Education Ex
change (CIEE), which is lo
cated in San Francisco. This
travel agency specializes in
helping students plan vacations,
such as their Mexicano night
flight to Mexico City for $158
each way. They also arrange
flights to most other places, in
cluding special fares to New
York City ($159 one way) and
Chicago ($371 round trip.)
However, if you're tired of
the annual trek to gay Paris, you
might try an adventure in one of
the tranquil sunspots like Portu
gal, Spain or the tropics. The
fact that summer is low season
for these places means cheaper
airfare and fewer tourists.
If you idea of a vacation is
playing native for a few weeks,
Club Med has the perfect deal.
They offer a package in Tahiti
which includes airfare, lodging,
entertainment, and lots of
beach-action and tropical
enchantment. Club Med has two
locations in Tahiti, one at Bora
Bora and the second club in
Morrea, which is slightly
cheaper. Airfare to the island
from L.A. to Papeete runs $750,
with your actual stay costing
either $420 or $490 depending on
which club you choose.
Other package deals, such as

the group inclusive tour fare
special offer airfare, hotel, and
car rental. Depending on the
package deal you choose, you
may receive additional bene
fits. Often, special deals like
these will save you money in the
long run, because most costs are
included.
No matter where you are
headed this summer, the key to
an enjoyable vacation is to plan
far in advance. In fact, making
plans now is not too soon since,
according to one travel agent,
"In the next three or four
months we're going to see a lot
of price changes due to the con
tinuing rise in fuel costs and a
reduction in passenger vol
ume."
Students should take advan
tage now of APEX fares, pack
age deals, and budget fares be
cause the cost of these relative
ly reasonable deals will undoub
tedly increase in the future.

Airlines and Swiss Airlines both
refuse to guarantee APEX

If you are willing to put up
with a little inconvenience,
many airlines provide budget
fares for considerbly less than
APEX fares. The only com
plications are that tickets must
be purchased 21 days in advance
and although you pick the week,
the airlines specify which day
you will leave. These fares run
$568 to London, $934 to Rome

Another way to save money is
to contact the Council of In

travel agency specializes in

such as their Mexicano night
flight to Mexico City for $158
each way. They also arrange
flights to most other places, in
cluding special fares to New
York City ($159 one way) and
Chicago ($371 round trip.)
However, if you're tired of
the annual trek to gay Paris, you
might try an adventure in one of
the tranquil sunspots like Portu
gal, Spain or the tropics. The
fact that summer is low season
for these places means cheaper
airfare and fewer tourists.
If you idea of a vacation is
playing native for a few weeks,
Club Med has the perfect deal.
They offer a package in Tahiti
which includes airfare, lodging,
entertainment, and lots of
beach-action and tropical
enchantment. Club Med has two
locations in Tahiti, one at Bora
Bora and the second club in
Morrea, which is slightly
cheaper. Airfare to the island
from L.A. to Papeete runs $750,
with your actual stay costing
either $420 or $490 depending on
which club you choose.
Other package deals, such as

the group inclusive tour fare
special offer airfare, hotel, and
car rental. Depending on the
package deal you choose, you
may receive additional bene
fits. Often, special deals like
these will save you money in the
long run, because most costs are
included.
No matter where you are
headed this summer, the key to
an enjoyable vacation is to plan
far in advance. In fact, making
plans now is not too soon since,
according to one travel agent,
"In the next three or four
months we're going to see a lot
of price changes due to the con
tinuing rise in fuel costs and a
reduction in passenger vol

Students should take advan
tage now of APEX fares, pack
age deals, and budget fares be
cause the cost of these relative

According to Jane Holland of
Stanford Travel Associates, a
local travel agency, "Students
should be thinking now about
where they want to travel this
summer and how they're going
to get there."
Holland advises purchasing
your airline tickets as soon as
possible due to skyrocketing air
fares. Most airlines offer what
they call "APEX" fares which
are advanced purchase deals
that are subject to certain re
strictions. The tickets must be
round-trip, paid for at least
three weeks in advance. Depen
ding on where you travel, and
there are minimum and max
imum restrictions on length of
stay.
If you want a European vaca
tion this summer, APEX fares
apply to many of the Continent's
major cities. Venturing to Lon
don via TWA will cost approx
imately $772. Franfurt, Germa-

Ny, costs around $777, Paris
about $976, and if you feel like
taking in a little bit of Italian
culture, Rome will cost you a
mere $1034.
Prices vary among airlines,
and also vary as to whether you
depart mid-week or on the
weekend. For example, round
trip to Rome leaving on a Tues
day will cost you $1034, while
taking off on a Saturday jumps
the price up to $1211.
Another way to go is to fly
standby to London, reducing
your airfare by one half. Once in
London, you can catch a ferry to
the Continent and take the train
to the country of your choice.

Or if you'd rather go straight
to France, Air France is re

Youth Fare is available for
travelers aged 12 to 22. It is valid
for one year and for an addi
tional $50, allows an open and
confirmed return reservation.
The advantage of APEX fares
is that students can buy tickets
now for summer travel at cur
rent prices, thereby avoiding
higher costs due to inflation.
