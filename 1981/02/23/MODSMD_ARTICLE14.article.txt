# Students hype New Zealand tour

What has 17 million sheep and 3 million
people? If you answered "a large kinky sex
show" don't pass go, don't collect $200. If,
however, you answered New Zealand, then
pat yourself on the back.
Two New Zealand students came to Stan
ford February 18-20. Brigit Chaffey is an
arts undergraduate at the University of
Canterbury, and a well known ski-instruc
tor. Tony Stuart is a graduate of the same
university, who organized this tour, called
"Kiwis On Campus." While other fellow
students did their marketing projects on
topics such as watches or televisions, Tony
did his on travel. As a result, he convinced a
variety of companies to sponsor this pro
gram. Tony and Brigit are going to cam
puses in California, Oregon, Colorado and
Hawaii, spreading the word on New Zea
land, explaining where it is and what it has
to offer American students.
I had a chance to talk with them over
lunch at the Coffee House. Brigit ordered a

cream cheese, sprouts, lettuce and tomato
sandwich. Toni ordered a pizza. I saw his
surprised expression when he got it, cold. I
explained that he had to put it in a micro
wave, and I went to pour myself a cup of
mocha java. I came back and peered in on
Tony's pizza, stopping the machine im
mediately, explaining to him that one gener
ally takes the wrapping off first.
As I learned. New Zealand has a lot to of
fer an American student. The native lan
guage is English, and there is opportunity
for study, both graduate and under
graduate. However, this seems like an un
likely thing to want to do in a country so
suited for recreation. Located in the South
ern Hemisphere, New Zealand consists of
two islands, 1000 miles in length. Seasons
are reversed, so if Tahoe is rained out, not to
worry â€” July is a great time for skiing! Lift
tickets average $8 a day. Scuba diving is
also very popular there. Of course, the
warmer waters for scuba are in the north,
while skiing takes place down south. Anoth

er fascinating fact, toilet bowls flush coun
ter-clockwise!
New Zealand is devoid of poisonous in
sects, snakes and dangerous wild animals,
which makes it ideal for hiking and
backpacking. Big game fishing and surf
casting are very good there. It is unpolluted,
with clean, fresh air and beautiful lakes and
rivers.
Their dress is similar, if not identical
to ours. An interesting observation Tony
made concerned bars. He said that over
there they are wide open, cheery places
Not like the ones here, with low lighting and
a "dungeon-like appearance."
If this sounds appealing to you. more de
tailed information may be obtained at the
Overseas Resource Center in the Bechtel-
International Center. Their hours are Mon
day-Friday, 8-12 and 1-5. Stop in and see if
New Zealand might be for you. It is bound to
be a great time, for sure. Or as they would
say in New Zealand, "it'll be a great time,
no worries!"
