### Suzi Alexander 
A cultural, historical, and
archeological expedition of Chi
na is being planned by Stanford
Religious Studies professor
Diana Paul, and is open to un
dergraduatoa. graduates, rela
tives. alumni, faculty and staff
â€” essentially, anyone with a
"sincere interest in the coun
try," says Paul.
Paul and her husband Doug,
an enthusiastic couple with a
tremendous store of knowledge
and a genuine excitement about
China, will lead the adventure
late this summer. The expedi
tion wil cover Manila, Beijing,
Daton, Shanghai and,according
to Paul, "all of the cities known
for their historical significance
in China's culture, especially
Buddhist cites" (Buddhist cities
being Paul's specialty). The
tour will also include some
modern cities.
"The Imperial Journey"
planned for August 17-Septem
ber 13 is being coordinated by a
travel headquarters which ar
ranges campus tours. There is a

possibility of planning joint ac
tivities with another University
which will be conducting a simi
lar tour.
The cost of the trip will be
$3,195 including airfare, land
travel, all meals (except some
in Manila and Hongkong), and
hotel expenses. Furthermore,
students planning to register
fall quarter of 1981 may obtain
five units of credit through the
Religious Studies department
for "Chinese Buddist Thought."
Paul stresses that she is look
ing for a diverse mixture of peo
ple, and that a great facility
with Chinese history or Bud
dhist thought is not required. In
terviews will begin April 1. Af
ter the group has been selected,
an orientation meeting will be
held explaining what to bring
and suggesting background
reading that may broaden the
experience.
For more information, Paul
can be reached during the day at
497-0467 or 497-3322 or evenings
at 328-0597.
