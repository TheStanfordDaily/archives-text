# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Paul Davies & Peter Maillet Iran sanctions needed to preserve honor 
### 
Tuesday. Janauary 20, wit
nessed two very important
events in American history; the
inauguration of Ronald Reagan
as the nation's President and
the release of the fifty-two
Americans held hostage by Iran
for 444 days. Each event sepa
rately raised important ques
tions in the minds of Ameri
cans: Will Reagan be able to
control inflation and unemploy
ment? Can he revise United
States military 0 Can he balance
the budget? The release of the
hostages opened still other ques
tions. How were the captive
Americans treated? Did the
Americans suffer extreme psy
chological damage? The most
urgent of these questions is how
the United States should treat
the Iranians. Should we accept
the status quo or punish them
with either military or econom
ic sanctions?
Let us suppose that President
Reagan opts to take retributive
action against Iran. Certainly
there are many dangers in
herent in such a policy.
First, applying sanctions
against Iran might force Iran
into a closer relationship with
the Soviet Union. Furthermore,
military sanctions might pro
vide an excuse for the Soviet
Union to invade Iran, another
possibility with grim conse
quences for the United States.
Second, we risk further
destabilization in the already
tenous Persian Gulf region. The
Middle East is clearly an area in
which we must not upset the
precarious stability. In con
sidering applying punitive sanc
tions, then, we must consider
the impact on the stability of the
Gulf.
Third, we must consider the
possible reactions of the in
ternational cummunity to any
punitive sanctions administered
by the United States.. We cer
tainly risk alienating Japan and
our European allies who, in the
long run, will depend heavily on
Iranian oil and who are already

acting to lift trade embargos on
that nation. Furthermore, we
risk invoking the anger of Alger
ia. a nation that, as an in
termediary, has now secured
the release of American
hostages on two separate occa
sions.
Despite these potential risks,
however, acceptance of the
present situation can not be to
lerated. Outweighing all other
considerations is the image of
the United States in the eyes of
the rest of the world.
Despite demands for the re
turn of the Shah, and his wealth
to Iran, it seems clear that the
Iranians were primarily seek
ing another objective from the
start: that of international hu
miliation of "the terrible
Satan", the United States. By
repeatedly exploiting expecta
tions and hopes of the American
diplomats and the public, Kho
meini was able, on numerous oc
casions, to foster optimism for
the return of the hostages only
to reverse his position and deny
the United States such satisfac
tion. a process somewhat taken
as teasing a dog with a bone.
Such taunting undoubtedly dam
aged America's prestige
abroad. Ultimately, the final
statement had devastating im
pact on American prestige
abroad. Throughout the world,
many see the agreement as a
payoff - "a reward for ter
rorism" - which reflects the
weakness of America.
Throughout the Iranian
crisis, the United States dis
played weakness on the interna
tional level unparalleled in
American history. Out national
will was tested by the Iranians
and found lacking. Whether or
not the United States is capable
of standing up to its enemies is a
separate issue. Yet as a result of
our actions over the past four
teen months, the world now per
ceives the United States as a
country reluctant (unwilling?)
to use its economic and military
capabilities to counter ag
gression. This new perception of

United States resolve invites
future acts of aggression by ene
mies both large and small. We
must act immediately to re
verse this undesirable per
ception.
In short, the world must be
taught a lesson: the United
States will not tolerate acts of
aggression against itself or its
allies. Reagan should reject the
status quo, with its inherent hu
miliation of the United States,
an option within the bounds of
international law. In addition to
rejecting the hostage agree
ment. the United States should
apply further sanctions to the

Iranians. Only the President
and his advisors know the full
range of military and economic
options available; we certainly
hope that Reagan fully in
vestigates the possibilities and
resists the temptation to accept
the status quo. Ideally, he will
react with the "swift and effec
tive retribution" that he prom
ised other terrorist nations to
assure that such a dark day in
American history is never re
peated.
