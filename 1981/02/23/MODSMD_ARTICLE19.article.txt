Chicano business
The Chicano Business Society
would like to clarify its position
on certain issues which may
have been miscontructed as a
result of what we felt was a mis
leading article written about us
(Daily. Jan. 26).
We take issue with the per
vasive notion that all business is
inherently opposed and in
sensitive to the interests of op
pressed peoples and is, as such,
undeserving of Chicanos' par
ticipation. Granted, some cor
porations do act in a socially ir

responsible manner. Yet these
cases don't serve to justify such
a rash generalization.
Capitalism as a socio-eco
nomic system suffers from cer
tain market imperfections
which cause inefficiencies in the
system. Discrimination is just
such an imperfection which, we
believe, can be corrected for the
greater welfare of those upon
whom it specifically impinges
as well as for that .of the entire
economy. Ours is a dynamic,
not static economy. As such, it
is our duty to ensure that future
changes concerning discrimina

tion are positive ones. Active
participation within the system
can effect such changes.
Second, we feel that "as
similation" is a much abused
word. To call someone a ven
dido (sell-out) is a charge we re
fuse to level upon any one as an
excuse to denounce the path in
life they have chosen. This is the
kind of value judgement which
engenders the very alienation
we are fighting against.
Also, we must look upon our
opportunities as positive
chances to serve others. It is no
where written in stone that
achieving success and main
taining one's social responsi
bility are mutually exclusive.
As role models, we must take on
a dual role; that of a productive
economic citizen yet also sensi
tive to the needs of others less
fortunate than ourselves. The
task is difficult as well as a
noble one; perhaps not meant
for all to undertake. Nonethe
less it is upon such an ideol
ogical base that the Chicano
Business Society was founded.
We hope that in the months and
years to come our organiztion
can aspire to be instrumental in
the attainment of such goals.
