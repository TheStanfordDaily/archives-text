### Bill Beyda 
Law School Prof. William Baxter
may become the latest Stanford addi
tion to President Ronald Reagan's ad
ministration, following a White House
announcement Friday.
Baxter, 51, has been nominated to
serve as assistant attorney general in
charge of anti-trust matters.
Baxter told the Daily yesterday he
is "pleased and is looking forward to
the Senate confirmation hearings."
A White House spokesman said Bax
ter was chosen because his quali
fications best suited the position and
Reagan personally approved his ap
pointment to the Justice Department.
Baxter, a conservative Republican
and staunch Reagan supporter, said
he will make changes in some areas of
the department. "There are some
areas where I don't plan to follow the
policies presently in effect," he said,
but did not elaborate.

Nor* Hid Baxter say felt bound to
agree with the president on every is
sue. "While in charge of the anti-trust
division, I will feel free to discuss any
differences the President and myself
have on issues regarding my depart
ment, but I will have no reason to dis
cuss any other differences, " he said.
"I have no reason to think that the
President's views towards the busi
ness community will adversely effect
the workings of the anti-trust depart
ment."
Baxter told the Peninsula Times-
Tribune recently that he supports dis
mantling regulations that prevent
banks from operating in more than one
state and said he feels competition
should be allowed between banks in
different states.
He has also recommended remov
ing regulations on the energy industry.
Law School Dean Charles Meyers
said of his colleague, "I am delighted

with the now* of Hit* uppointiriont 1
don't know anybody that could do a
better job than Bill; he's had over 20
years of practical experience in the
anti-trust field and is well-informed on
economic issues."
Baxter has taught at Stanford for 20
years and works as a legal consultant
on anti-trust affairs to several corpo
rations. Baxter is known for his sup
port of the electronic banking industry
and his opposition to the supersonic
transport. He is the co-author of Re
tail Banking and the Computer Age
and the author of People or Penguins:
An Optimum Level of Pollution. Bax
ter earned undergraduate and law
degrees from Stanford, and served as
an assistant law professor here before
joining a Washington D.C. law firm in
1956. He returned to Stanford in 1960.
Meyers said,"Bill will be welcome
to return here at any time in the future
if he so chooses."
