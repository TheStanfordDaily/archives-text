## Nuclear war is inevitable 
### 
Prophets have been predict
ing the end of the world for cen
turies; and for centuries they
have been labeled as daft.
Modern forebodings of global
disaster have carried weight
ever since the first squadron of
nuclear-tipped ICBM's hit the
launching pads. Considering
that the Silicon Valley is a
prime target of the Kremlin,
I'm surprised that I haven't
heard more discussions con
cerning the possibility of nucle
ar war. But then again macabre
conversations are pretty de
pressing. Perhaps not. What
would you do if you had just ten
minutes to live from the time
you heard that the Russians's
(missies) were coming?
I would like to believe that
there is no way a civilized coun
try or leader could actually use
nuclear weapons because of the
awesome destructive power:
one hydrogen bomb could easily
vaporize Washington D.C. But
all is fair in love and war, as was
shown in President Truman's
decision to destroy Hiroshima
in 1945.
What are the chances for nu
clear war within our lifetimes?
How about before next football
season? Optimists insist that
nuclear war will not occur be
cause of the "balance of terror"
between nuclear powers. This
balance was two-thirds effec
tive in preventing World War 111
during the Cuban missle crisis.
However, in a similar confron
tation in 1981 between the U.S.
and the U.S.S.R., it is doubtful
that the Russian bear could be
coerced to back down.
Nowadays, the U.S.S.R. is at
least equal to the U.S. in mili
tary power.
The chance of another dan
gerous confrontation in Africa
or the Middle East is very high
considering the West's depen
dence on these areas for min
erals and oil. Moscow has two
incentives for a resource grab.
Control of the oil fields would
ensure an adequate supply for
the U.S.S.R. is a belligerent
monster with hegemanic ambi
tions.
Bui the really frightening
aspect of Soviet policy is their
attitude toward nuclear war.

Unlike the U.S., the Soviets
have massive civil defense
plans, and do not believe in the
idea of mutually assured de
struction which seems so at
tractive and becalming to the
average American citizen.
Yet it takes two to fight a war.
At present, the U.S. is entering a
new era in foreign policy in
which she will be more ag
gressive in defending her in
terests. Ronald Reagan — pro
nounced Ray-gun by some —
won the presidency by a land
slide on a platform partly based
on restoring American prestige
abroad. The U.S. Congress has
no qualms about spending
billions more on defense, espe
cially conventional capabilities.
Does the public have the
absurd notion that a "safe" con
ventional war with the "outside
power" in the Mideast won't be
come a nuclear one? There is a
no doubt that in the coming
years the U.S. will get more in
volved overseas. What will hap
pen when the unstoppable Rus
sian force collides with the im
movable American mass?
Perhaps nothing. There is no
doubt that the "balance of ter
ror" will continue to restrain
sane leaders, but not indefinite
ly, just because of the fact that
accidents do happen.
Certainly the greatest danger
of war today is in the Third
World. And although the
capability to make it radio
active does not yet exist, it soon
could. Presently, only six na
tions acknowledge having nu
clear bombs, but that number
could increase to twenty almost
overnight if the need arose, due
to the spread of bomb material
and technology worldwide.
Colonel "Crazy-man" Kad
dafy of Libya has made it not se
cret that he wants the bomb; in

fact he tried to buy one from
France (I'm surprised they
didn't sell). Now it seems that
Saudi Arabia and Iraq also want
bombs. Recently the Saudis
agreed to supply almost a billion
dollars to Pakistan to finance an
"Islamic bomb.'' Israel made a
bomb years ago with enriched
uranium stolen from the U.S. In
addition. Taiwan and South
Africa are suspected of possess
ing atomic bombs.
The horizontal proliferation
of nuclear weapons is directly
tied to the spread of nuclear
plants, technology, and materi
al. The development of the
breeder reactor and widespread
reprocessing will only increase
the supply of plutonium essen
tial for the bomb. More nuclear
powers, especially unstable
ones, will only increase the
chances of a nuclear holocaust.
It seems that not much can be
done to eliminate the spread of
nuclear weapons, either ver
tically or horizontally. SALT did
nothing about the 80,000 nuclear
devices in existence today. And
it is doubtful that the Non-Pro
liferation Treaty will hold up as
the superpowers start the arms
race anew. Proliferation will
stop when countries no longer
regard these weapons as neces
sary for their survival, or when
wars no longer occur. I do not
think I will live to see the day.
President Reagan's cam
paign comment that "nuclear
proliferation is none of our busi
ness," Vice President Bush's
talk on the feasibility of a "lim
ited nuclear war", and Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig's
comments regarding the use of
American "power" all point to
mushroom clouds in the sky.
Nuclear war is inevitable.

overnight if the need arose, due
to the spread of bomb material
and technology worldwide.
Colonel "Crazy-man" Kad
dafy of Libya has made it not se
cret that he wants the bomb; in

fact he tried to buy one from
France (I'm surprised they
didn't sell). Now it seems that
Saudi Arabia and Iraq also want
bombs. Recently the Saudis
agreed to supply almost a billion
dollars to Pakistan to finance an
"Islamic bomb.'' Israel made a
bomb years ago with enriched
uranium stolen from the U.S. In
addition. Taiwan and South
Africa are suspected of possess
ing atomic bombs.
The horizontal proliferation
of nuclear weapons is directly
tied to the spread of nuclear
plants, technology, and materi
al. The development of the
breeder reactor and widespread
reprocessing will only increase
the supply of plutonium essen
tial for the bomb. More nuclear
powers, especially unstable
ones, will only increase the
chances of a nuclear holocaust.
It seems that not much can be
done to eliminate the spread of
nuclear weapons, either ver
tically or horizontally. SALT did
nothing about the 80,000 nuclear
devices in existence today. And
it is doubtful that the Non-Pro
liferation Treaty will hold up as
the superpowers start the arms
race anew. Proliferation will
stop when countries no longer
regard these weapons as neces
sary for their survival, or when
wars no longer occur. I do not
think I will live to see the day.
President Reagan's cam
paign comment that "nuclear
proliferation is none of our busi
ness," Vice President Bush's
talk on the feasibility of a "lim
ited nuclear war", and Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig's
comments regarding the use of
American "power" all point to
mushroom clouds in the sky.
Nuclear war is inevitable.
(John Keen is a sophomore ma
joring in history.)
Prophets have been predict
ing the end of the world for cen
turies; and for centuries they
have been labeled as daft.
Modern forebodings of global
disaster have carried weight
ever since the first squadron of
nuclear-tipped ICBM's hit the
launching pads. Considering
that the Silicon Valley is a
prime target of the Kremlin,
I'm surprised that I haven't
heard more discussions con
cerning the possibility of nucle
ar war. But then again macabre
conversations are pretty de
pressing. Perhaps not. What
would you do if you had just ten
minutes to live from the time
you heard that the Russians's
(missies) were coming?
I would like to believe that
there is no way a civilized coun
try or leader could actually use
nuclear weapons because of the
awesome destructive power:
one hydrogen bomb could easily
vaporize Washington D.C. But
all is fair in love and war, as was
shown in President Truman's
decision to destroy Hiroshima
in 1945.
What are the chances for nu
clear war within our lifetimes?
How about before next football
season? Optimists insist that
nuclear war will not occur be
cause of the "balance of terror"
between nuclear powers. This
balance was two-thirds effec
tive in preventing World War 111
during the Cuban missle crisis.
However, in a similar confron
tation in 1981 between the U.S.
and the U.S.S.R., it is doubtful
that the Russian bear could be
coerced to back down.
Nowadays, the U.S.S.R. is at
least equal to the U.S. in mili
tary power.
The chance of another dan
gerous confrontation in Africa
or the Middle East is very high
considering the West's depen
dence on these areas for min
erals and oil. Moscow has two
incentives for a resource grab.
Control of the oil fields would
ensure an adequate supply for
the U.S.S.R. is a belligerent
monster with hegemanic ambi
tions.
Bui the really frightening
aspect of Soviet policy is their
attitude toward nuclear war.

Unlike the U.S., the Soviets
have massive civil defense
plans, and do not believe in the
idea of mutually assured de
struction which seems so at
tractive and becalming to the
average American citizen.
Yet it takes two to fight a war.
At present, the U.S. is entering a
new era in foreign policy in
which she will be more ag
gressive in defending her in
terests. Ronald Reagan — pro
nounced Ray-gun by some —
won the presidency by a land
slide on a platform partly based
on restoring American prestige
abroad. The U.S. Congress has
no qualms about spending
billions more on defense, espe
cially conventional capabilities.
Does the public have the
absurd notion that a "safe" con
ventional war with the "outside
power" in the Mideast won't be
come a nuclear one? There is a
no doubt that in the coming
years the U.S. will get more in
volved overseas. What will hap
pen when the unstoppable Rus
sian force collides with the im
movable American mass?
Perhaps nothing. There is no
doubt that the "balance of ter
ror" will continue to restrain
sane leaders, but not indefinite
ly, just because of the fact that
accidents do happen.
Certainly the greatest danger
of war today is in the Third
World. And although the
capability to make it radio
active does not yet exist, it soon
could. Presently, only six na
tions acknowledge having nu
clear bombs, but that number
could increase to twenty almost
overnight if the need arose, due
to the spread of bomb material
