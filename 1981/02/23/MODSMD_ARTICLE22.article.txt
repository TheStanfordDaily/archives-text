## Ethiopia asks aid in refugee return 
### 
Asmara, Ethiopia (AP) — Marxist Ethio
pia, which used Soviet arms and Cuban ad
visers to win two wars on its territory, is
asking the West for vast sums to repair the
damage and bring home refugees driven out
by the hostilities.
Tens of thousands of refugees are return
ing in what Ethiopian officials predict will
be a reversal of one of Africa's biggest emi
grations. Many are former guerrillas, dis
illusioned by months of mountain skirmish
ing; others fled the fighting in secessionist
Eritrea and in the Ogaden region, claimed
by neighboring Somalia.
Major assistance
Ethiopian officials say they expect major
assistance from the West, although they
concede that their military alliance with the
Soviet Union has turned off some Western
donors.
"It shouldn't make any difference if aid is
truly given for humanitarian reasons," said
Shimelis Adugna, head of the National Re
lief and Rehabilitation Commission.
Western nations and multinational agen

cies have been the biggest givers since
drought in 1973-74 put Ethiopia, one of the
world's poorest countries, on the relief
rolls. Despite a recent Soviet gift of 12,000
tons of Australian wheat, commission
spokesmen say they do not expect the East
bloc to take on a significant part of the
burden.
"We get more from the Lutheran World
Federation than we do from the socialist
countries," Tamrew Fyesse, commission
spokesman, said.
UN reparations
Ethiopia this year presented a request to
the United Nations for $1.5 billion — the esti
mated cost of repairing war damage in
Eritrea and the Ogaden desert, and of re
habilitating millions of drought and war vic
tims. Commission officials say the amount
is so large that there is little chance of its
immediate acceptance.
Ethiopia will test Western generosity
again April 9-10 in Geneva, Switzerland, at a
U.N.-sponsored conference on refugees.
Africa has some 5 million refugees, half the

world's total, the U.N. estimates.
Total African aid requests at Geneva
could exceed $1 billion, a spokesman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.
Tamrew said Ethiopia needs $55 million
to bring back 268,000 refugees from Sudan,
Djibouti and Somalia during the next three
years. The United States, which Ethiopians
say has given $65 million as the biggest
donor since 1974, is likely to react coolly.
Claims
Owen Roberts, head of the U.S. Embassy
in Addis Ababa, the capital, said U.S. law
bars any long-term aid until Ethiopia settles
claims by American companies totaling
more than $5 million for property na
tionalized in the Marxist revolution six
years ago.
Girma Gabreyessus, who calls himself
the political commissar in Eritrea, told re
porters: "Marxism-Leninism is part of our
program. We are proud of it. Assistance
should not mean denying the principles of
the revolution."
