From the Daily wire services
Beijing â€” Former Cambodian head of state
Norodom Sihanouk has invited the main Cam
bodian anti-communist group to join him in ne
gotiations with the Khmer Rouge on the for
mation of an anti-Vietnamese coalition.
In a message Saturday from his exile home
in Pyongyang, North Korea, Sihanouk said he
had proposed to Son Sann's Khmer People's
National Liberation Front (KPNLP) that they
take part in "the discussions between the
Khmer Rouge and us, and the nationalists."
The former Cambodian leader recently pub
licly stated that he conditionally agreed to lead
a Cambodian united front against Vietnamese
occupation forces. Son Sann, a former premier
under Sihanouk, was named by the latter as
one of the three Cambodian figures likely to
head a coalition government. Sihanouk would,
meanwhile, take up the figurehead post of
president of the anti-Vietnamese front.
With its 3000 men, Son Sann's KPNLF is the
leading anti-communist resistance movement
battling the Hanoi-backed Phnom Penh re
gime.
Fielding some 30,000 men against the 200,000
Vietnamese troops deployed in Cambodia, the
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge represent the

principal resistance force confronting the pro-
Vietnamese Phnom Penh regime. Aware of
the Khmer Rouge's tarnished image in the
world (they are held allegedly responsible for
the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Cam
bodians in Phnom Penh from 1975 to 1979) Chi
na has been trying for some time to talk
Sihanouk into leading an anti-Vietnamese
coalition.
Sihanouk set the following conditions for his
agreement: China should supply his forces
with military and material aid and the designa
tion "Democratic Kampuchea" adopted by the
Khmer Rouge should be scrapped in favor of
the traditional name: Cambodia.
By seeking the dismantling of "Democratic
Kampuchea," Sihanouk is virtualy demanding
that the United Nations withdraw its recogni
tion of the Khmer Rouge regime, deposed by
the Vietnamese army two years ago, as Cam
bodia's representative in the world body, ana
lysts here said.
Before Sihanouk announced his conditional
agreement to preside over an anti-Vietnamese
front, Son Sann had held several rounds of talks
with the Khmer Rouge.
