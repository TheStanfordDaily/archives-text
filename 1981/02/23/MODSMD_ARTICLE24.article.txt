# Rough weekend for Larry Brown
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Larry
Brown said it was the worst
week of his coaching life — part
ly because it was the first time
his life has been threatened
Brown, coach of the N0.6-
rated UCLA basketball team,
had protection from some se
curity men Friday and Saturday
when the Bruin team was at
Stanford to play the Cardinals.
Earlier Friday UCLA Athletic
Director Bob Fischer had re
ceived a call saying Brown
would not return from the
team's trip to the San Francisco
Bay area.
Other things that contributed
to an uphappy week for Brown
were:
— Repeated denials of re
ports he had signed to return to
pro basketball as coach of the
New Jersey Nets next season.
— Brown's decision to drop
freshman center Kenny Fields
from the team.
— And a sharp dropoff in the
Bruins' performance. After

moving up to a ranking of sixth
in the nation among major col
lege teams following upset vic
tories over Notre Dame and Ari
zona State the previous week,
the Bruins had trouble beating
California Thursday night, and
were upset by Stanford Satur
day night 74-to-72.
"Maybe I'm the Bear Bryant
of Westwood," Brown said as he
tried to joke about his deadly se
rious protectors, comparing
them to the Alabama state
troopers who accompany foot
ball coach Bryant at 'Bama
games.
"It's a first for me," Brown
added concerning the threat on
his life. "The things that have
been going on the last eight
days, to be culminated with
something like this (the threat).
It affects you.
"But it's been so tough for the
kids. The Kenny Fields thing,
the Nets thing — I don't want to
take anything away from Stan
ford, but it's all affected them.
How could it not?"
