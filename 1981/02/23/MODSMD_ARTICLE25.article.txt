# Trackmen compete against San Jose St.
## 
### Marty Yee 
The day started ominously for
the Stanford men's track team
Saturday when they faced San
Jose State in their first dual
meet of the season. The 4xloo
meter relay team had just lost
to the Spartans "A" team, and
was almost nipped at the finish
by San Jose's "B" team.
After that opening display of
depth and talent, the Sparts con
tinued to flex their running
muscles for the rest of the day.
The result, although this was a
non-scoring meet, was a big vic
tory for the men just south on
the peninsula.
In all, San Jose State won
eight of the 11 running events.
These victories included a one
two-three sweep in the 100
meters, first and second-place
finishes in the 200 meters, and
first and third places in the 1500
meters, with Rod Berry taking
second place to break up the
sweep. The Spartans' Bo
Breigan also took the 800-
meters in a tough match-up
against the Cardinals' John
Schaer.
A measure of respect, how
ever, was gained by Stanford
runners Dennis Arriola, Garry
Shumway, and Bill Graham;
who all picked up first place fin
ishes on the afternoon: in the
3000-meter steeplechase, the
400-meter intermediate
hurdles, and the 5000-meter run.
respectively. Shumway and
Graham blazed to strong vic
tories in their events, while Ar
riola ran a career best 9:11.6,

only five seconds off the meet
record.
The Cards fared much better
in the field events, showing
signs of improvement over last
season. "We won all the throw
ing events, after winning only
one last year," said Johnson.
"And we're elated about Dave
Thomson's double victory."
Thomson won both the ham
mer and discus competitions,
throwing 191' 10"and 53.58
meters respectively. Brian
Holloway was a surprise winner
in the shot, leading a one-two
Stanford finish with football
teammate Craig Awbrey. Gary
Bruner and Dave Stone gave the
Cards first and third place per
formances in the javelin as well.
Despite the setback, Johnson
saw a lot of bright spots. "I feel
good about the fact that we had
good performances in places
where we didn't have last
year," the second-year coach
said. "They have a better team
than we do, but we have closed
the gap."
The Stanford women, mean
while, did much better at the
San Francisco Games at the
Cow Palace Saturday night.
The 1600-meter relay team of
Pam Donald, Lynnae Warren,
Shelly Poerio, and Marcia
Martin won the event in 3:57.1, a
school, meet, and Cow Palace
record.
Martin was also third in the
800 and Donald placed fourth in
the 60-meter dash behind
Evelyn Ashford. America's top
woman sprinter.
