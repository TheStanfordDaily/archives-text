## Jones keys upset 
### Steve Odell 
Keith Jones sat in his
shorts, slumped on the bench
in front of his locker with a
dazed look on his face. The
freshman guard simply was
incredulous at what had just
happened, and he wanted to
savor every moment of it.
What had happened, of
course, was Stanford had
just upset the sixth-ranked
UCLA Bruins, 74-72 in front
of 7000 fans in the fairlyand
of Maples Pavilion. "This is
unbelievable," said Jones.
"I've had this dream for
years. And now it's a dream
fulfilled."
Fittingly, Jones played the
main role in his dream
come-true, coming up with a
team and career-high 23
points on 9-10 shooting from
the floor and 5-6 accuracy
from the line. The fleet
backcourt man from Arizona
also picked up four assists
and three steals, before foul
ing out on a controversial
charging call with 2:59 re
maining.
As a result, Jones had to
miss the final, frantic
minutes of the game — liter
ally. "I didn't see it,"he
said. "I covered my eyes
with a towel."
On a night that belonged to
the freshmen, no one more
than Jones exemplified the
progress they have made this

year, and the result was a su
preme effort by the rookie
class. They showed Saturday
what they could do if and
when they put it together In
deed. Jones, John Revelli (16
points), and Hans Wichary
(11 points), were the three
top scorers for the Cards.
"I had heard about their
super quick players," Jones
said, ' but I felt I could take it
to the hole almost anytime I
wanted to. I just tried to
create some things — either
a shot or a pass."
Jones was a master of
creation, and time and time
again he took the ball into the
middle of the Bruin defense,
making the Card offense
click. To do this, he had to
drive past the fast UCLA
backcourt of Michael Holton
and Rod "Rocket" Foster,
reputedly the quickest man
in college basketball today.
Jones' confidence rubbed
off on the rest of the Stanford
team, and he began to sense
that an upset was in the mak
ing "in the second half when
we started taking it in."
"I could see it in the UCLA
players' eyes," Jones said.
"Rod Foster started to get a
scared look in his eyes."
Was the game Jones' best
ever? "Hey, we just beat
UCLA," he exclaimed. "This
is the best game I ever
played in my whole life. This
is great!"
