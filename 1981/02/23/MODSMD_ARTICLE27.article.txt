# Cardinals seek revenge against USF

The last time the Stanford
Cardinals women's basketball
team played the University of
San Fransisco Lady Dons, na
tionally acclaimed Mary Hile
sparked the Dons to a 70-54 win.
But this is a different Cardinal
team going into Tuesday night's
game. The Cards just beat first
place California 73-72, surpris
ing the entire league and giving
Stanford a chance to tie for third

place in the conference, and fin
ish with a winning season.
"If we can finish with a win
ning season, I'll be satisified,"
Cards' head coach Dotty
McCrea said. "We lost a lot of
girls this year, and this has been
a crazy league. There were a
few close games I wish we could
have back."
There were several con
ference games the Cards should
have won. and these will make

the difference in qualifying for
the regionals. At this point, even
if the Cards win all their re
maining games, the chance of
this league receiving a third re
gional berth is highly unlikely.
The regionals are not the
Cards' main concern now, but
beating USF, Santa Clara, and
Cal is. "If we expect to beat
USF. Meg Metzger and Anne
Miller have to play great

games, and the rest of the team
have to play with the same con
fidence they had against Cal last
week," McCrea said.
The Cardinals' overall record
is 14-14, and their NorCal con
ference record is 4-5. The Cards
face USF Tuesday night at
Maples Pavilion at 7:30 PM,
Santa Clara on the road Friday
night, and return home to finish
the season March 2 against Cal.
