# Tennis team in search of national title
## Women netters to have 'fresh'look in '81 
### Steve Odell 
Frank Brennan reminds you of a little
kid on Christmas morning when talking
about his team for the upcoming season.
The Stanford women's tennis coach has
tfot a pretty good idea of what he's got,
ind he can hardly wait to find out if his
expectations will be met.
He has reason to be excited. He's got
five new recruits "under the tree'' that
just might be the finest group of
tre.shmen on campus, including the
men's basketball quartet.
"I'm really looking forward to the sea
son.'' Brennan said. "We should
•hallenge USC for the national cham
pionship We're infinitely better than
last year."
Last year, the Cards ended up ninth in
'he AJAW Championships, after being
ranked between two and five for most of
hev -aj The Trojans took the title, beat
ing Miami 9-0 They almost could have
beaten an All-Star team," Brennan
praised.
But 1981 proves to be anything but a
Southern Cal runaway, looking more like
a "three-horse" race, according to Bren
nan — between USC, Stanford, and
UCLA.
"I'm an optimist, but a realist," Stan
ford's second-year coach said. "Last
year, we really didn't have a hope, but
this year we can do it (win the national
title), as long as everyone stays healthy.
We ve got some real thoroughbreds."
Here's a rundown of the new faces to
be found playing women's tennis on the

Farm in 1981:
• Elise Burgin — "She's an intense
player, very lively, with lots of talent,"
said Brennan. "She's very versatile and
has a good all-around game. She has to be
not so creative, and play a little more
pattern tennis, though." Burgin, a lef
thander from Baltimore, was on the 1980
Junior Wightman Cup Team, and was
ranked 10th among U.S. 18-year-olds last
year.
• Susy Jaeger — Also a member of the
1980 U.S. Junior Wightman Cup Team,
she is ranked no. 76 in the world and no. 4
among U.S. amateurs. "She probably
has the most finished game," said Bren
nan of Jaeger, who is the older sister of
professional Andrea Jaeger. "Her game
is really uncomplicated She plays the
net well, but doesn't choose to go up
there very much. She's a tough kid. I like
her style." Jaeger will team up with
Burgin to play number two doubles for
the Cards, and will be a mainstay in the
middle of the singles line-up.
• Michelle Weiss — "She's got a good
all-around game, with an excellent
serve, and she is one of our better vol
leyers," said Brennan of Weiss, who
should see action at number six or seven
singles as well as number three doubles
for the Cards "She's one of our best
doubles players," he added. "And she
fits right in with the other freshmen
She's a fighter It really helps to have
somebody like that around
• Alison Hardey - Ranked third in
1980 Southern California Tennis Associa

tion Girls 18's, Hardey is just starting to
scratch the surface of her potential in
tennis. "She is a great athlete with tre
mendous potential." verified Brennan.
"She has all of the physical attributes
you need to be a star athlete. Her tennis
game is getting better by the day. And
when she gets it together, she is going to
have one helluva tennis game."
• Joanna Girard — Girard was one of
the top age-group players in the nation,
ranking as high as number five at age 14,
and ranked no. two on the Southern Cali
fornia Tennis Association Girls 18 Sin
gles list last year. "She came out of jun
iors with one of the best records," said
Brennan. "But her game did not mature
as she matured. But she is working hard
on trying to hit the ball harder and with
better placement. She's a good com
petitor."
Brennan's talent does not stop with his
first year players by any means. Leading
the Cards this year will be Alycia
Moulton, who was the runner-up in the
AIAW singles last year, and who took the
doubles title with current pro Kathy Jor
dan in 1979. "She's inspired by the
freshmen," Brennan said. "She's really
working hard. She's our leader out
there."
Moulton. an All-Ameican the past two
seasons, possesses one of the most pow
erful serves in women's tennis, and
racked up a 29-10 singles mark last year.
The junior from Carmichael will play
number one for the Cards in both singles
and doubles, and is currentlly ranked

110 th in the world by the WTA.
Also sure to play major roles in the
Cards' fortunes this season are team
captain Donna Rubin, junior Sue
Rasmussen, and sophomore Caryn
Copeland.
Rubin, the only senior on the team,
gained All-America kudos also last year,
advancing to the final eight at the AIAW
Singles Championships. She piled up a
22-8 record at number two singles last
year for the Cards, and should alternate
with Jaeger and Burgin at that spot again
this season. Brennan calls her "the
George Brett of our team."
Copeland, from Scottsdale, Arizona,
went 15-15 a year ago, mostly at number
three, and will start out playing number
five for Brennan inl9Bl. A potential All-
America according to Brennan, she will
also team up to play number one doubles
with Moulton.
Rasmussen went 22-12 last year at
number four for the Cards, and looks to
play at number six or seven in 1981. A
member of Stanford's AIAW Cham
pionship team in 1978, her strength is in
her powerful ground strokes.
Stanford, which opened their 1981 sea
son with a 9-0 shutout win over Santa
Clara last week, will have a much-im
proved Cal squad on hand this Tuesday.
"They are really considerably
stronger," Brennan said of the Bears,
who finished 11th in the AlAW's last sea
son. "The Cal match is going to give us a
nice test They're a darn good team."
