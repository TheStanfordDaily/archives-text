# Ruggers beaten
## 
### Stephen Korn 
With forty-minute halves, no
time-outs, constant running and
hard, brusing hitting, some
rugby players consider the
game to last an eternity.
Stanford's game Saturday,
however, couldn't have ended
more quickly as the Cards, de
spite a late flurry, dropped their
second consecutive game 20-15.
The loss came at the hands of
another visiting Canadian club,
the University of Victoria Vik
ings. at Maloney Field.
The beginning of the game
was marred with penalty kicks
as Viking Pat Trelawany drilled
two 20-yarders and Stanford's
Jamie Turner countered with
one for the Ca'rds. In between
these kicks, each club had nice
long runs, but as usually occurs
in a hard-fought game, the ball
popped out of the players's
hands at the wrong times.
The first real explosion came
when Turner, after receiving a
long boot, wheeled, and raced 20
yards downfield. where he make
a brilliant pass to a streaking
Frank Hicks. Hicks then
galloped the final 30 yards for
Stanford's first try.
This was Stanford's only
bright spot for much of the first
half, as Victoria added yet an
other penalty kick, coupled with
a superb pop-kick and run by
Trelawany to put them up at
halftime by a score of 13-9

The second half continued to
be disappointing for the Cards
as the Vikings scored early in
the period. On a set scrum deep
in Stanford territory, the Cana
dians seemingly lifted the
Cardinals' whole scrum and
drove the ball in the end zone for
a 20-9 lead.
Throughout the second peri
od, Stanford just couldn't crack
the Vikings' back line. Both Rob
Romine and Keith Donald had
long runs, only to slip on the
grass or find no Cardinal sup
port.
It was only in the final
minutes when Stanford started
to play at a level with the Vikes.
After a set scrum in Viking ter
ritory, the Cards got the ball to
Milt McColl, and he proceeded
to run 20 yards for a score while
knocking over any would-be
tacklers in his pursuit.
With little time left and a
hollering crowd in support,
Stanford's fired-up players got
the ball back and promptly ran
the ball upfield. But as the
Cardinals were about to make a
line-out, the referee blew his
whistle, signaling the end of the
contest.
Stanford's next outing will be
against Hastings this Saturday
at 1 p.m at Maloney Field; Sun
day. the Cards will face Lincoln
College of New Zealand in an
other home game.
