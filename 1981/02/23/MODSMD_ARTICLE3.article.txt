# Cuba warned on El Salvador
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The United States has warned that it in
tends to "go to the source" with whatever means are nec
essary to shut off the flow of arms from Cuba to guerrillas
in El Salvador, informed official sources said Saturday.
The Reagan administration, in conveying the warnings
last week via meetings with Latin American ambassadors
and other diplomatic channels, did not specify what action
is being contemplated in case Cuban support continues for
the Salvadorean insurgency.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig and other senior of
ficials made it plain, however, that various contingency
plans, including military contingencies, are under active
study.
There is some possibility, under close review here Sat
urday, that the public and private alarms from Washing
ton are already having an effect. U.S. intelligence has
failed to detect new signs of insurgent arms shipments into
Salvador since Washington's drive was unveiled a week
ago.
There is "certainly a lull" in reports about shipments to
El Salvador, sources said, but it is too early to tell how sig
nificant or long-lasting it will be. Senior intelligence of
ficials said it will take another two weeks, at a minimum,
to reach a firm conclusion that the arms flow has stopped.
The United States has been putting heavy pressure on
Nicaragua's leftist-dominated government to choke off
the munitions supply the administration says became
clearly detectable in December. To spur Nicaragua into
acting, the Reagan administration has threatened a total
cutoff of U.S. economic aid, which is helping to keep that
country afloat financially.
According to sources, the Nicaraguans have given
Washington a private pledge that they will stop the traffic
through their country and have shown signs of trying to
comply. But given Nicaragua's limited police resources
and the fact that some powerful elements in the govern
ment there are avowed Marxists in sympathy with the
Salvadorean guerrillas, the degree to which U.S. pressure
will succeed is not yet clear.
While the immediate zone of conflict is Central Ameri
ca, the steamy isthmus connecting Mexico with South
America, the arms supply for the insurgency is believed to
come in substantial part through Fidel Castro's Cuba sev
eral hundred miles across the water to the east. This,
along with the animus toward Cuba that has long been ex
pressed by President Ronald Reagan and his backers on
the Republican right, has made Cuba a major target in
these first weeks of the new administration.
The Soviet reaction to the Reagan administration's hard

line on Cuba remains unknown, although the Kremlin has
been harshly critical of Reagan in public statements. It
was noted in Washington that Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov,
chief of staff of the Soviet military forces, visited Cuba
shortly after the Reagan administration came to power.
"The timing (of the visit) was interesting, but we don't
know what it means," said an official U.S. source.
The U.S. warnings to Cuba about the arms supply to El
Salvador surfaced last Tuesday in a briefing given by Haig
for Washington ambassadors of North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization allies plus Australia, New Zealand, Japan and
Spain. Haig described Cuba then as "the immediate
source of the problem" of outside support for the
Salvadorean insurgency.
Haig went on to tell the diplomats that "1 wish to assure
you that we do not intend to have another Vietnam and en
gage ourselves in another bloody conflict where the source
rests outside the target area."
In a briefing for Latin American diplomats the same
day, William Clark, who has been designated to be deputy
secretary of state, repeated Haig's reference to intended
U.S. avoidance of a Vietnam-like situation in which arms
and aid continue to flow to communist forces from outside
El Salvador.
Clark went on to say, "We do intend to go to the source
with whatever means may become reasonably necessary"
in order to stop the arms flow, according to informed
sources. Virtually the same language was used on other
occasions during the week by Haig and other high officials,
the sources said. It was unclear whether the message has
been delivered directly to Havana as well as broached in
conversations with third-country diplomats.
The substance of the contingencies being discussed as
potential actions against Cuba has not been revealed. Past
U.S. efforts to impose international restrictions on trade
with Cuba were unsuccessful, and have been largely aban
doned in recent years by nearly everyone except the Unit
ed States.
As a presidential candidate, Reagan suggested a U.S.
naval blockade of Cuba as a "hypothetical" counteraction
to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He declared in justi
fication that "the Soviet Union owns Cuba, lock, stock and
barrel." He said such a blockade would be "a grave
logistical problem" for the Soviets and Cubans.
"I'm quite sure they (the Soviets) would not come sail
ing over with a navy and start shooting," Reagan said in an
interview with The Wall Street Journal in May 1980. His
aides and official spokesmen were unable to specify the
source of Reagan's confidence that the Soviets would not
challenge a U.S. action against their ally.

U.S. avoidance of a Vietnam-like situation in which arms
and aid continue to flow to communist forces from outside
El Salvador.
Clark went on to say, "We do intend to go to the source
with whatever means may become reasonably necessary"
in order to stop the arms flow, according to informed
sources. Virtually the same language was used on other
occasions during the week by Haig and other high officials,
the sources said. It was unclear whether the message has
been delivered directly to Havana as well as broached in
conversations with third-country diplomats.
The substance of the contingencies being discussed as
potential actions against Cuba has not been revealed. Past
U.S. efforts to impose international restrictions on trade
with Cuba were unsuccessful, and have been largely aban
doned in recent years by nearly everyone except the Unit
ed States.
As a presidential candidate, Reagan suggested a U.S.
naval blockade of Cuba as a "hypothetical" counteraction
to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He declared in justi
fication that "the Soviet Union owns Cuba, lock, stock and
barrel." He said such a blockade would be "a grave
logistical problem" for the Soviets and Cubans.
"I'm quite sure they (the Soviets) would not come sail
ing over with a navy and start shooting," Reagan said in an
interview with The Wall Street Journal in May 1980. His
aides and official spokesmen were unable to specify the
source of Reagan's confidence that the Soviets would not
challenge a U.S. action against their ally.
Washington — The United States has warned that it in
tends to "go to the source" with whatever means are nec
essary to shut off the flow of arms from Cuba to guerrillas
in El Salvador, informed official sources said Saturday.
The Reagan administration, in conveying the warnings
last week via meetings with Latin American ambassadors
and other diplomatic channels, did not specify what action
is being contemplated in case Cuban support continues for
the Salvadorean insurgency.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig and other senior of
ficials made it plain, however, that various contingency
plans, including military contingencies, are under active
study.
There is some possibility, under close review here Sat
urday, that the public and private alarms from Washing
ton are already having an effect. U.S. intelligence has
failed to detect new signs of insurgent arms shipments into
Salvador since Washington's drive was unveiled a week
ago.
There is "certainly a lull" in reports about shipments to
El Salvador, sources said, but it is too early to tell how sig
nificant or long-lasting it will be. Senior intelligence of
ficials said it will take another two weeks, at a minimum,
to reach a firm conclusion that the arms flow has stopped.
The United States has been putting heavy pressure on
Nicaragua's leftist-dominated government to choke off
the munitions supply the administration says became
clearly detectable in December. To spur Nicaragua into
acting, the Reagan administration has threatened a total
cutoff of U.S. economic aid, which is helping to keep that
country afloat financially.
According to sources, the Nicaraguans have given
Washington a private pledge that they will stop the traffic
through their country and have shown signs of trying to
comply. But given Nicaragua's limited police resources
and the fact that some powerful elements in the govern
ment there are avowed Marxists in sympathy with the
Salvadorean guerrillas, the degree to which U.S. pressure
will succeed is not yet clear.
While the immediate zone of conflict is Central Ameri
ca, the steamy isthmus connecting Mexico with South
America, the arms supply for the insurgency is believed to
come in substantial part through Fidel Castro's Cuba sev
eral hundred miles across the water to the east. This,
along with the animus toward Cuba that has long been ex
pressed by President Ronald Reagan and his backers on
the Republican right, has made Cuba a major target in
these first weeks of the new administration.
The Soviet reaction to the Reagan administration's hard

line on Cuba remains unknown, although the Kremlin has
been harshly critical of Reagan in public statements. It
was noted in Washington that Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov,
chief of staff of the Soviet military forces, visited Cuba
shortly after the Reagan administration came to power.
"The timing (of the visit) was interesting, but we don't
know what it means," said an official U.S. source.
The U.S. warnings to Cuba about the arms supply to El
Salvador surfaced last Tuesday in a briefing given by Haig
for Washington ambassadors of North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization allies plus Australia, New Zealand, Japan and
Spain. Haig described Cuba then as "the immediate
source of the problem" of outside support for the
Salvadorean insurgency.
Haig went on to tell the diplomats that "1 wish to assure
you that we do not intend to have another Vietnam and en
gage ourselves in another bloody conflict where the source
rests outside the target area."
