# Men's tennis team wins, loses on weekend
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
It became apparent this weekend that the only col
legiate men's tennis team that can beat Stanford is
Stanford And that might happen yet.
One sign was a good one, in that the Cardinals
dominated the NorCal Intercollegiates, easily win
ning the event and filling both spots in both the sin
gles and doubles finals. No. 3 seed Jim Gurfein upset
Tim Mayotte, the top seed and his doubles partner,
in singles 6-4, 2-6,6-4 Then the two teamed up to beat
teammates Scott Davis and Scott Bondurant in the
doubles final, 6-2, 5-7, 7-5.
The other sign, however, dealt a severe blow to
Stanford's standing as the team to beat in NCAA ten
nis this season.
After a full day of conferences and soul-searching,
sophomore David Siegler, one of five returning
starters from the defending NCAA national cham
pion, decided Saturday not to come back to school
spring quarter.
The 19-year-old said he could not devote enough
time to both school and tennis to measure to his stan
dards for either. Something had to give, and the
campus life lost out to the court life.
"I want to take a rest from the pressures of school
and doing well in tennis," Siegler said, "I couldn't
handle the conflict well. I was retrogressing in ten
nis."
Trying to excel in both was affecting him off the
court as well. "After four quarters of school, my
personality had changed," the slender six-footer
said. Siegler took off in December to play a pro
fessional tour in Australia and New Zealand, and
evidently decided he liked the life of tennis-without
books well enough to try it.
Siegler's decision came after meeting Saturday
morning with Athletic Director Andy Geiger, and
that night with tennis coach Dick Gould. The meet
ings came at Siegler's request, and they served to
verify in his own mind that what he was doing was

best for David Siegler.
Geiger refused comment, except to say "I thought
it was a private conversation. I don't wish him any
thing but the best. If he wants to disclose a private
conversation, that's his problem."
It is known that the men's tennis team receives
only five full scholarships, and Siegler had one of
them. By dropping out, Siegler makes that scholar
ship worthless, because the NCAA does not allow
changing recipients in the middle of the year. Thus
Siegler deprives the team of effective use of that
scholarhip, either by him or someone else.
It also hurts because that someone else could be a
high-school senior. Gould has done no recruiting up
until now, because he did not think he would have a
scholarship opening. Now Siegler's gone, and Gould
is four months behind in the recruiting game.
But the coach is used to these problems. This is
the 10th defection from his teams in the last 12
years. Though it is also the second in one month
(freshman Mike Falberg, who would have started,
left school for personal reasons last month and is not
expected back), one gets the feeling that Gould has
been down this road before.
"We're gonna miss him. He was in the top four
and he was the highest-ranking amateur in the world
in doubles," Gould said. "But you see guys like Jim
my Gurfein continually getting better, and that
helps to pick up the slack."
Gurfein was anything but slack in his play this
weekend. The New York sophomore blitzed second
seeded Mike Bauer in the semifinals 6-3, 6-3 before
upsetting his teammate. Having to play your team
mates in real competition is the paradox of college
tennis, but Gurfein was able to rationalize it.
"We won the team championship Friday. That
part is already accomplished. I think about getting
on the Junior Davis Cup team at the end of the year -
- make it more of a personal thing," Gurfein said.
"Tim is the best player in college tennis. It's not as

big a match for him as it is for me. Besides, I hate to
lose at anything, even in practice."
The other big performances for Stanford came in
the doubles. Andy Chase and John Corse, who with
Siegler out are beginning to look more and more like
the No. 3 doubles team, did a lot to help their cause
Friday by beating Cal's Yair Wertheimer and Bauer
6-1,5-7,6-4.
Considering the upheaval of the weekend, Gould
was already, as he always is, looking ahead. "That
was a great win for Jimmy and it didn't hurt Tim.
What it shows me is that I have three guys who can
play at No. 1 (Mayotte, Davis and Gurfein) and at
least two outstanding doubles teams.
"With those two guys (Siegler and Falberg) we
had, on paper, a great team," Gould said. "If, bar
ring injury because we're a little thinner, everyone
continues to improve, I see no problems. A little bit
of adversity pulls guys together. It's happened here
in the past."
Siegler's ex-teammates accepted his departure
without much argument, if only because they know
both the rigors of tennis and college and the kind of
person Siegler is.
"I'd like to have him back. We need him," May
otte said. "But I don't want him to feel like he's
doing us a favor; if he wants to, he should go play
tennis. We've dealt with this before."
Siegler's had nothing but praise for what he left
behind. "Dick Gould is a great guy," Siegler said un
abashedly. "He understood everything that I said.
Obviously, it was tough for him. But he knew it was
right for me and he understood that. If I had to do it
over again, I'd come here."
So now it is on to the real world of tennis. Siegler
said he was not going to turn professional right
away. "I want to see how I do on the pro circuit as an
amateur, just to keep my options open,'" Siegler
said. "I'll try it for a year-and-a-half or two years
just to give myself a chance."
