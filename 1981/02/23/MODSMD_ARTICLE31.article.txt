# USC, Bears fall prey to gymnasts

Berkeley — Several Bay Area
collegiate sports teams had an
upsetting weekend, but most of
the coaches involved wouldn't
trade this feeling for anything in
the world. Not anger or the re
sult of eating too much rich
food, this kind of upset meant
beating the odds, which is what
Stanford's men's gymnastics
team accomplished against
USC Friday night.
The Cardinal women lived up
to their pre-meet expectations
in beating California Saturday
night, but the assault on the
school and personal records in
what was perhaps Stanford's
finest overall performance
came as an added bonus.
Sadao Hamada's charges de
feated their Southern California
hosts by a 253.80 to 242.95 point
margin and took the top four
places in all-around competi
tion. Mike Lee anchored the
clean sweep with a 54.15 per
formance for first place, a new
personal record. Chris Smith
was runner-up with 48.65 points,
followed by Kirk Druey at 48.00
and Jeff Chung with 47.75.
"Mike, as usual, was very
consistent and pretty soon he'll
hit 55," Hamada said. "The oth
er all-around men made good
progress, almost all hitting 48
points-plus."
Event-by-event, Stanford's
top showings included Bob
Maganini's 9.05 floor exercise
routine, good for second place.
Lee's 9.00 score earned him
third place. In rings, Lee and
Craig Goldman tied for first
with 8.85 efforts while Bob
Daniel took third with 8.65.
Smith led all competitors with a
9.45 vault while Daniel's 9.25
gave him a third-place finish.
Lee's 8.70 parallel bars rou
tine placed him third and his
9.15 high bar showing was sec
ond only to Brian Nelson's 9.30
performance.
The victory raises Stanford's
overall record to 4-3 and the
Cards are now 1-3 in conference
comnpetiton. Those those
marks will be put on the line
against Arizona this Friday.
After the USC meet Hamada
said, "Arizona is pretty tough —
we'll need a little more con
sistency to beat them. I hope
Rich (Rosen, out most of this
season with a wrist injury) will
be able to compete soon. Also I
hope to have Brian Nelson in all
around. That will help us pick up
a few more points."

Across the bay, Jackie Walk
er's squad had a tough act to fol
low — another of the upsets by
local teams, this one being Cal
over USC in overtime 73-71. The
women's meet lacked the dra
matic flair displayed by the
hoopsters, as the Cards ran off
to a 138.95 to 126.10 victory, but
the small gathering in Harmon
Gym was treated to some fine
individual dramatics.
Stanford's team score was
the second highest on record,
only 1.65 points shy of the stan
dard established last season
against UC-Davis and demon
strated the potential of a rela
tively complete squad. Karen
Hall, competing in all-around
for the first time this year com
piled a very respectable 34.95 to
tal, earning her fourth place.
Tied for the runner-up spot at
35.35 were Anne Smith and Cal's
Karen Kelsall, a former Canadi
an national champion. Merilyn
Chapman topped the all-aroun
ders with a 36.50 tally.
"It was obviously our best
meet of the year, not just in

terms of scores, but also be
cause of the good spirit and at
titude of the team — I was very
pleased" Walker said. "The
meet format, with competitors
from the two teams alternating,
displayed our composure and
showmanship, especially on bal
ance beam. That showed the dif
ference between a seasoned per
formed and an amateur.
"That was our second highest
team score, but it was actually
the best Stanford performance
— our score was lower because
of new judging rules," Walker
added.
Among the reasons for Stan
ford's "best" showing were
Hall's personal best floor rou
tine, judged a 9.30 for third
place, Smith's beam score of
9.10. earning her second and her
9.00 floor that placed fourth.
While the other three events
were impressive, Cal and Stan
ford saved the best for last and
"floored" each other and the
fans.
Besides celebrating her re
turn to all-around competition,
Hall also turned 21 the night of

the meet and a Eastern Onion
singing telegram was delivered,
monkey percussionist and all, to
Harmon Gym. After this enter
taining interlude to break the
tension came a crescendo of
floor routines begining with
Smith's 9.00. That was followed
by Hall's 9.30, Kelsall's 9.40 and
Chapman's 9.50, the latter being
another personal best. The Card
event score also set a school rec
ord.
Other top Stanford scores in
cluded Hall and Smith tying for
second in vaulting with 8.60 and
Chapman's 8.75 for first. In un
even parallel bars. Smith placed
third with 8.65, Hall finished
second with 8.80 and Chapman
took top honors with 9.40. On
beam. Hall scored 8.25 for
fourth place while Chapman's
8.85 was good for third and
Smith's 9.10 earned her second.
Three other gymnasts came
up with personal bests in the
meet: Julie Bledsoe in the floor
exercise, Caryn Lucido in the
floor and bars, and Jeanette
Lacoste in the vault.
