# Winter IM round-up
## 
### Drew Edwards 
As the long winter quarter
draws to a conclusion, so too are
the activities of intramural
sports winding down to a finish.
All those interested in com
peting in weight-lifting should
note that the intramural meet
will be held February 25, with
the weigh-in beginning at 6.30
p.m., and the competition to fol
low.
Competition in gymnastics
will be a one-day meet which
will be held Wednesday, March 4
at 6 p.m. at Encina Gym. The in
tramural office would like to
stress that those competing in
elimination tournament sports
(darts, foosball, squash, and
table tennis), should meet their
deadlines to insure that all

matches be played before quar
ter's end.
This year in intramurals
there are 126 soccer teams com
peting and over 200 basketball
teams in the various leagues.
Competition has been fierce in
both sports, but in basketball in
particular, this year has fea
tured an increased parity
among all of the teams compet
ing.
In "B" league basketball it
appears that any one of the top
ranked teams is capable of win
ning the title, while there are
also a few unranked teams who
could be sleepers. Atop the "B"
league rankings are the Fellas,
a team which has the best
chance to capture the title. The

Fellas are winning by an aver
age of more than 30 points a
game and possess as much tal
ent as most "A" league clubs.
Equally impressive is the
team Well Hung, a squad which
won one of its games by the
score of 106 to 14. Either of these
two teams is a good bet for the
title but a dark horse could be
the Seedy Gourmets.
In "A" league play, last
year's runners-up Sleep and
breams appear to be the odds
on favorite to win the title. Any
of the play-off bound clubs have
a legitimate shot, however, so
there could be a few upsets
along the way. Competition in
the play-offs begins Monday,
February 23.
