Reagan seeks NATO aid
Munich — In a strong pitch to the Atlantic allies, the
Reagan administration Saturday called on its partners to
increase their contribution to the Western defense effort in
Europe and to do more to protect Western interests in con
flict zones outside Europe.
Frank Carlucci, deputy secretary of defense, bluntly
told a conference of Western officials here that the sharing
of the Allied defense burden would be a primary concern of
the new U.S. administration.
He said America would live up to its responsibilities of
increased consultatation with members of the North At
lantic Treaty Organization and would demonstrate
greater consistency than in the past in policy-making.
But in return, he said. Europe should recognize its re
sponsibilities.
"Like the East-West balance, the relationship between
the United States and Western Europe also has shifted dra
matically over 30 years. The United States no longer pro
duces and consumes 50 percent of the world's GNP. Eu
rope is no longer shattered, impoverished and disunited.
Indeed. Western Europe's total GNP exceeds that of the
United States.
"In this situation, the United States cannot be expected
to improve and strengthen U.S. forces in Europe, unless
other allies increase their own contributions to the com
bined defense effort. Nor can the United States, unaided,
bear the burden of promoting Western interests beyond
Europe."
Soviets accuse U.S. of hostilities
Moscow — Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov
launched a wide-ranging attack on the United States and
its Western allies Saturday, accusing them of plotting to
renew the Cold War and preparing for hostilities with the
Soviet Union.
In the most authoritative response thus far to President
Reagan's tough anti-Soviet rhetoric. Ustinov dismissed
charges of complicity with terrorists as an "evil-minded"
American ploy, rejected any renegotiation of the Soviet-
American strategic arms limitation treaty (SALT II). and
accused Washington of preparing to achieve its global
goals through a "pre-emptive nuclear" strike against the
Warsaw Pact nations.
Soviet armed forces must "tirelessly perfect combat
readiness" to meet Western challenge, Ustinov said.
The tough statement by the marshal who is also a mem
ber of the 14-man ruling Politburo is seen here as setting
the tone for the Soviet Communist Party's 26th congress,
which convenes today, to set foreign policy and economic
goals for the country for the next five years.
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev is expected to make
similar tough statements in his keynote address to the con
gress Monday. Soviet sources here indicate.
Ustinov offered no new suggestions or ideas on how the
United States and the Soviet Union can improve their rela
tions. The address is an annual ritual but takes on added
significance because of the bitter atmosphere now grip
ping Moscow-Washington relations since the Reagan ad
ministration took office a month ago. Soviet propaganda
have assailed Reagan and Secretary of State Alexander
Haig for charging that Moscow supports international ter
rorism.
Ustinov accused communist arch-rival China of joining
the United States in mounting "provocations" against
Moscow's Indochinese allies — Vietnam. Laos and Kam
puchea (Cambodia). He also said imperialism is taking

"subversive actions" to "destabilize the atmosphere" in
Poland with efforts to'discredit socialist power and
weaken socialist solidarity."
It seems likely that Warsaw Pact leaders will meet be
hind the scenes for their first discussion of Poland since
last December's emergency gathering in Moscow shortly
after Stanislaw Kania came to power in Warsaw. Kania's
speech to the congress will be intently scrutinized by for
eign observers for signs as to how he intends to respond to
likely Kremlin pressures to roll back the concessions to in
dependent trade unions and private farmers made by the
party through the months of crisis in Poland.
Ustinov said the Soviet Union does not seek strategic su
periority and called the SALT II pact, which Reagan says
must be renegotiated, an effective barrier against the
arms race. Renegotiation, he said, "quite obviously radi
cally contradicts the interests both of Americans and Sovi
et peoples, as well as the interests of all mankind."
The speech is a measure of how far relations between
the two superpowers have deteriorated since the last party
congress in 1976. Then. Brezhnev pledged to pursue de
tente with "redoubled energy." The Kremlin had scored
impressive diplomatic gains, chiefly in the 1975 European
security agreement that recognized Soviet postwar
hegemony over Eastern Europe and accepted the status of
East Germany. The SALT I treaty, now lapsed but still ob
served by both countries, was the centerpiece of
Brezhnev's policy of negotiating major dangers with the
United States.
Ambassador to UK appointed
Washington — John Jeffry Louis, 54, an Illinois com
munications executive and scion of the Johnson's Wax for
tune. has been selected to be President Reagan's am
bassador to Great Britain, according to informed sources.
White House press aide Kama Small said she could
neither confirm nor deny the appointment until an official
announcement had been made. This is among the first am
bassadorial appointments of the new administration and,
after rhetorical homage to a merit system concept by the
Carter administration, it reinforces the tradition in which
presidents award political backers with diplomatic posts.
Louis, chairman of the Phoenix-based Combined Com
munications Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Gan
nett communications empire, has been a heavy con
tributor to Republican candidates, though he was not "in
ordinately active" in Reagan's 1980 campaign, according
to an aide to the president.
Louis' background in international relations consists
largely of a stint in international marketing for his moth
er's family's wax business, based in Racine, Wis., in the
late 19505, according to his longtime friend and associate
Karl Eller of Phoenix, former head of Combined Com
munications,
Eller, now owner of Swenson's Ice Cream and president
of Columbia Pictures Communications, acknowledged
that he is a substantial financial backer of the Reagan
campaign.
Eller said he was consulted about the ambassadorship
for Louis but did not play a direct role in securing the post
for his friend.
The record of Louis' contributions to the Reagan 1980
campaign was not immediately available. But according
to campaign records of 1972, Louis was the fifth largest
contributor to President Nixon's re-election campaign,
when he was listed for $286,726 (including $20,000 given by
his mother, Henrietta Johnson, and two brothers).
Eller and Louis were partners in an advertising business

in the early 19605, and in 1968 founded Combined Com
munications. The company owned the Oakland Tribune
and the Cincinnati Enquirer. In 1979, in the largest media
merger in history, it was taken over by Gannett. Louis
serves on the Gannett board of directors.
Louis has served as an investor of his family's money,
Eller said, and also has considerable background in "help
ing to run schools." He has been a trustee for North
western University since 1967 and also has served Deer
field Academy, Foxcroft School and Williams College in a
similar capacity.
Louis also was one of three owners and directors of the
Atlanta Braves baseball team who, in 1969 were ordered
by the baseball commissioner to get rid of stock ties to Las
Vegas gambling casinos. Louis was then on the board of
the Parvin-Dohrmann Co., owner of three Las Vegas ho
tels and casinos. ,
Polish debt deferred
Washington — The Reagan administration has taken a
first step toward aiding the hard-pressed government of
Poland by deciding to let that country defer repayment of
more than $80 million owed to the United States, State De
partment sources said yesterday.
The U.S. contribution to the easing of Poland's severe
debt problem is to be made known officially in Paris meet
ings, beginning today, of representatives of Poland's
western creditors.
A senior U.S. official familiar with administration
thinking portrayed the current debt deferral, which in
volves Commodity Credit Corp. funds, as "bridging as
sistance" for the Warsaw government, which faces an eco
nomic crisis.
The Reagan administration's decision, while limited in
scope and economic scale, is one of the first indications of
how it will deal with the thorny problems of U.S. relations
with Eastern European nations on the Soviet periphery. It
was taken in the light of strong and continuing western
concern about a possible Soviet invasion of Poland, which
would bring on an East-West crisis of major dimensions.
A longer-term and more imposing plan of assistance to
Poland is under study within the administration, sources
said. Such a program would be considerably more com
plicated in its political and economic ramifications, both
here and abroad.
A major aid problem is likely to require much greater
confidence than currently exists that the Polish regime
will survive the combination of internal instability and So
viet external pressure. It probably also would require ex
plicit commitments by the Warsaw government to imple
ment economic reforms so that the aid would not be
wasted.
Seven die in weekend fire
Fire took the lives of seven Southern Californians before
the weekend was half over, including four children alone in
their East Los Angeles home and three adults in separate
incidents in downtown Los Angeles, Hermosa Beach and
the Westlake area.
Authorities said the children were overcome by smoke
after a blaze broke out about 4 a.m. Saturday while their
parents were having an early breakfast with friends. The
dead children of Ramon Fernandez and his wife Delia
were identified as 1-year-old Ira; 2-year-old Jaine; eleven
year-old Denise; and 13-year-old Salvador.
Sheriff's Deputy Ralph Martin said Fernandez reported
leaving the home in an unincorporated area of the county

to go to breakfast with friends after waking Salvador to
have him watch the other children.
"It appeared the fire broke out in the front of the house
where the older youngsters had been sleeping," said Coun
ty Fire Department spokesman Dick Friend "They ap
parently were awakened by the noise or the heavy smoke
and made their way to the back, apparently in an attempt
to rescue their brother and sister, and they just didn't
make it."
In the downtown Los Angeles fire, a blaze in an aban
doned three-story hotel was reported shortly before 6a.m.
A man s badly burned body was found at the rear of the
second floor about 9:25 a.m.
The fire caused about $800,000 damage to the building,
which had been closed about two years, but was occupied
by transients who broke in to sleep there.
Six people were hurt, including a man about 40, who
jumped from the third floor and suffered a possible broken
foot, some cuts and singed hair. Four other men were
treated at the scene for smoke inhalation and a firefighter
suffered a minor leg injury, said Fire Department spokes
man Ray Walker.
Arsenic discovered in well water
Hudson, N.H. — Federal health officials yesterday
strongly urged testing of more private wells, as potential
ly dangerous levels of arsenic continued to be found in
drinking water in southern New Hampshire and in two
Massachusetts towns.
Signs of arsenic poisoning in young John Constantian
sparked initial tests in Hudson. The symptoms disap
peared as soon as the infant was switched from well water
to bottled water. Three adults also have reported arsenic
poisoning symptoms, city officials said.
By early yesterday, 611 wells had been tested, mostly in
Hudson and in Bow in central New Hampshire. More than
13 percent showed arsenic levels above the 50 parts per
billion limit considered safe by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, officials said. Several showed read
ings classified as dangerous by some health experts.
Today's weather
Fair and warm through today. Lows in the 40s to low 50s.
Highs in the mid-60s to mid-70s. Winds variable to 15 mph.
