# Trustees to consider repair plans for fire-damaged Storey House
## 
### Cathy Janus 
A $1.7 million project to rebuild
Storey House will be presented for
final approval to the Board of Trustees
next month.
The plans are the result of extensive
studies made after a fire damaged the
house last March.
According to Ed Scoles, director of
Housing and Food Services, engineers
discovered that the foundation, the or
iginal laid when the house was built in
1900, is deficient; too old and weak to
support the planned reconstruction.
"Along with reinforcing and im
proving the foundation, the house will
be modernized and made more com
fortable," said Norman Robinson as
sociate dean of Residential Educa
tion.
There are quite a few changes
planned for the house, according to
Scoles. Remodeling will add five more
rooms to accomodate handicapped
students, and two bathrooms will be
installed on every floor to make co-ed

living possible.
"We hope to retain the character of
the building while making it a better
house,"said Robinson.
Two source of funds will be used to
finance the reconstruction. The Uni
versity will use money from their self
insurance reserves and will borrow
money through the sale of bonds.
Of the reserves, which total $1 mil
lion, about $700,000 will be used for re
building Storey House, Scoles said.
The remainder of the cost will be fi
nanced by diverting some of the mon
ey the University is raising through
the sale of bonds for the construction
9f new dormitories, according to Rob
inson.
Construction on the top two floors
and part of the first floor will begin af
ter the Trustees approve the final
plans. The house will probably reopen
during the spring of 1982, according to
Robinson.
Officials never determined the ex
act cause of last year's blaze. "There

is no conclusive cause for the fire, al
though there is some speculation that
the fire started in or around a per
manently installed electric heater,"
said Scoles.
A student who attempted to put out
the fire could not find an extinguisher
on the floor where it broke out, and al
though one was found after the fire,
Santa Clara County Fire Marshall
Cliff Johnson said he doubted the blaze
could have been doused with only one
extinguisher.
No one was hurt in the three-alarm
fire last year which started in a second
floor corner room and almost resulted
in a total loss of the building. The stu
dents living in the house at the time
lost much of their coursework and
books for the quarter but the ASSU
note-taking service provided some
lecture notes and the Bookstore lent
needed textbooks.
Storey House residents scattered to
a variety of on-campus resi
dences.Twelve of them moved into
fraternities.
