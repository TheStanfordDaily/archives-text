## Stockman to veto changes in tax reduction program 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Budget Direc
tor David Stockman said Satur
day that he would recommend a
veto of any tax bill passed by
Congress that gave greater ben
efits to low-income and middle
income Americans than it did to
upper-income groups.
He accused Democratic con
gressional leaders of trying to
reduce the size and duration of
President Ronald Reagan's
three-year. $118 billion, across
the-board tax cut proposal so
they would not have to make
deep spending cuts in federal
programs as Reagan has urged.
Stockman, director of the Of
fice of Management and
Budget, also dismissed as a
"red herring" the argument by
leading Democrats that the tax
reduction plan is inflationary.
In unusually strong terms, he
rejected other contentions by
Democrats that tax reductions
should provide greater tax sav
ings at the low end of the income
scale — a feature of most recent
tax bills.
"That would be totally unac
ceptable." Stockman said in an
interview with the Los Angeles
Times. "I would recommend a
veto of any tax bill premised on
redistributing the tax burden.
That will achieve nothing in
terms of the kind of economic
expansion that the country
needs."
Asked if he would take the
same view toward a tax reduc
tion program of less than three
years, Stockman replied: "I
would look very skeptically on
that, too."
While declining to predict
whether Reagan would veto any
tax bill that varied from his pro
posal for a three-year, across
the-board reduction. Stockman
warned: "If it were simply a

1975-80 era vintage tax bill,
which simply redistributed the
tax burden, that is a clear line
that you can't cross."
Throughout the interview.
Stockman often took aim at
leading Democrats in Congress
who attacked the president's
tax proposals as inequitable and
inflationary during a formal re
ply to Reagan's state-of-the
economv speech to Congress
last Wednesday.
"Their (Democratic)
strategy is to say. Oh, we're all
for spending control, but this
tax program is horrendous.'
Then they come back with a
much more modest reduction in
taxes, and. ipso facto, you don't
have to do much on spending be
cause inflation drives up the
revenues," he said."Then
they're off the hook on spending.
That's precisely what they're
after."
Later. Stockman acknowl
edged that the proposed Reagan
administration tax cut would
substantially reduce govern
ment revenues.
"And to have any kind of fi
nancial and fiscal stability
along that path is going to re
quire large rescission of policy
commitments and entitlements
built into the budget today.'' he
said.
"And Democrats don't want
to do that because they created
those and their constituencies
are tied to those. So they have to
find some pretext or excuse for
the downward shift in the tax
share of gross national product
that we are proposing, and
that's to make up this red her
ring that it's inflationary."
But he said the Democratic
leadership was in "total disar
ray" concerning which spend
ing reductions to endorse.
"There's nothing they can

agree on on spending," he said.
"There are Eastern liberals
who would like to cut the water
projects. Pork barrel commit
tee Democrats will never go for
the kind of cuts there.
"The ideological liberals
would like to cut back on de
fense. Defense moderates will
never permit that to happen.
Some of the middle-of-the-road
to-conservative Democrats
would not mind cutting some of
the programs we've proposed —
food stamps and some others.
But the ideological liberals will
never go along.
Stockman scoffed at reports
that he may not survive long be
cause Cabinet members re
sented his invasion of their trad
itional turf on setting budget
priorities.
"I don't think that's the case
because people were picked for
this administration on the basis
of their commitment to the
president's agenda, not on the
basis of their commitment to
the departments, their clien
tele. programs and baggage of
the past. And if someone resists
the program, he's going to be in
trouble, not me," Stockman
said.

The above chart, based on information released by the White House, details spending reductions for
the next three years as proposed by the Reagan administration.
Washington — Budget Direc
tor David Stockman said Satur
day that he would recommend a
veto of any tax bill passed by
Congress that gave greater ben
efits to low-income and middle
income Americans than it did to
upper-income groups.
He accused Democratic con
gressional leaders of trying to
reduce the size and duration of
President Ronald Reagan's
three-year. $118 billion, across
the-board tax cut proposal so
they would not have to make
deep spending cuts in federal
programs as Reagan has urged.
Stockman, director of the Of
fice of Management and
Budget, also dismissed as a
"red herring" the argument by
leading Democrats that the tax
reduction plan is inflationary.
In unusually strong terms, he
rejected other contentions by
Democrats that tax reductions
should provide greater tax sav
ings at the low end of the income
scale — a feature of most recent
tax bills.
"That would be totally unac
ceptable." Stockman said in an
interview with the Los Angeles
Times. "I would recommend a
veto of any tax bill premised on
redistributing the tax burden.
That will achieve nothing in
terms of the kind of economic
expansion that the country
needs."
Asked if he would take the
same view toward a tax reduc
tion program of less than three
years, Stockman replied: "I
would look very skeptically on
that, too."
While declining to predict
whether Reagan would veto any
tax bill that varied from his pro
posal for a three-year, across
the-board reduction. Stockman
warned: "If it were simply a

1975-80 era vintage tax bill,
which simply redistributed the
tax burden, that is a clear line
that you can't cross."
Throughout the interview.
Stockman often took aim at
leading Democrats in Congress
who attacked the president's
tax proposals as inequitable and
inflationary during a formal re
ply to Reagan's state-of-the
economv speech to Congress
last Wednesday.
"Their (Democratic)
strategy is to say. Oh, we're all
for spending control, but this
tax program is horrendous.'
Then they come back with a
much more modest reduction in
taxes, and. ipso facto, you don't
have to do much on spending be
cause inflation drives up the
revenues," he said."Then
they're off the hook on spending.
That's precisely what they're
after."
Later. Stockman acknowl
edged that the proposed Reagan
administration tax cut would
substantially reduce govern
ment revenues.
"And to have any kind of fi
nancial and fiscal stability
along that path is going to re
quire large rescission of policy
commitments and entitlements
built into the budget today.'' he
said.
"And Democrats don't want
to do that because they created
those and their constituencies
are tied to those. So they have to
find some pretext or excuse for
the downward shift in the tax
share of gross national product
that we are proposing, and
that's to make up this red her
ring that it's inflationary."
But he said the Democratic
leadership was in "total disar
ray" concerning which spend
ing reductions to endorse.
"There's nothing they can

agree on on spending," he said.
"There are Eastern liberals
who would like to cut the water
projects. Pork barrel commit
tee Democrats will never go for
the kind of cuts there.
"The ideological liberals
would like to cut back on de
fense. Defense moderates will
never permit that to happen.
Some of the middle-of-the-road
to-conservative Democrats
would not mind cutting some of
the programs we've proposed —
food stamps and some others.
But the ideological liberals will
never go along.
Stockman scoffed at reports
that he may not survive long be
cause Cabinet members re
sented his invasion of their trad
itional turf on setting budget
priorities.
"I don't think that's the case
because people were picked for
this administration on the basis
of their commitment to the
president's agenda, not on the
basis of their commitment to
the departments, their clien
tele. programs and baggage of
the past. And if someone resists
the program, he's going to be in
trouble, not me," Stockman
said.
