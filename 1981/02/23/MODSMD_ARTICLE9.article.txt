# Strike hampers successful shuttle test

Cape Canaveral, Fla. (AP) â€”
As Machinists union members
walked the picket line at Ken
nedy Space Center on Saturday,
scientists went over data from a
test-firing of the space shuttle
Columbia's main engines and
reported "a very clean test."
About 800 Boeing Services In
ternational employees walked
off the job Friday in a contract
dispute over pay. The walkout
followed the 20-second suc
cessful test firing of the shut
tle's main engines.
Scientists said the test, which
spewed flames and steam over
launch area, did little dam

age to the shuttle.
"They've done the damage
assessments and found very lit
tle," said space center spokes
man Hugh Harris. "It was a
very clean test ... we didn't see
any damage to any of the tile on
the vehicle. But there was some
gap filler that came loose and
we still have to evaluate that.
But other than some scorched
paint, it looks really good."
Harris said the National
Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration still was shooting for
an April 7 launch of the space
shuttle. He noted that a new

schedule would be released
soon, because of repairs or
changes which "could stretch
the launch date out."
Harris said Boeing has prom
ised to send in personnel to sub
stitute for the striking support
worker!. The walkout initially
jeopardized some post-firing op
erations, such as purging Co
lumbia's fuel tanks, but man
agement personnel were able to
fill in, officials said.
Space agency officials said
the strike could cause other de
lays.
The workers' old contract ex

pired in January. Federal medi
ator Richard Deem said little
progress had been made in
bringing the two sides closer to
an agreement and that money
matters were the biggest
stumbling block. A negotiating
session was scheduled for to
day.
The Columbia's launch has
been delayed for more than two
years by a variety of technical
problems. The fleet of reusable
shuttles is slated to grow in the
next three years to four, and
perhaps five. The space ships
will be used for civilian, scien
tific and military missions.
