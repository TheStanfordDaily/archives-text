A blind man goes into a china shop and
starts walking down the isles knocking all the
china oft the shelves with his cane The man

counter and says frantically

No thanks, just looking
A drunk sitting at a bar bets the bartender
$10 he can lick his left eye-ball The bartender
accepts, and so the drunk takes out his false
eye and licks it
"I'll tell you what, 111 bet you $201 can bite my
right eye
No way, says the Bartender, as the drunk
lakes out his false teeth and bites his eye By
now the bartender is furious
Ok, one more chance, it you line-up five
shot glasses on the bar and spin me around on
the stool. I'll bet you $50 that I can piss and fill
up every glass without spilling a drop
"You're on," says the barman, setting up the
glasses He spins the stool, and the drunk
starts spraying everyone in the bar
The bartender, dripping wet, is laughing his
head off As the drunk hands over a sodden
$50 bill Bill the Bartender notices a guy pound
ing his head on the end of the bar
What's wrong? The bartender asks, still
laughing
That drunk bastard |ust bet me $1000 that
he could piss all over you and you d be laugh
