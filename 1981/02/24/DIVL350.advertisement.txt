LOOKING FOR A
RESPONSIBLE
POSITION?
A lot of companies will offer you
an important sounding title â€”
but how many offer you a really
important job? In the Navy and
Marine Corps, you get one as
soon s you earn your commis
sion. A job with responsibility
that requires skill and leader
ship. A job with adventure.
Navy ROTC has two ways col
lege sophomores can receive
an officer commission. The
Two Year Scholarship Program
pays full tuition during your
junior and senior years, books
and fees and $ 100/ month living
expenses for ten months each
year. The Two Year College
Program pays for uniforms and
$100/ month living expenses.
To qualify, you must have aC +

1981 for the College Program.
