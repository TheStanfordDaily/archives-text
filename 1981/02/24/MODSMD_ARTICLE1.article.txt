# Warren Christopher to speak at commencement exercises
## 
### Brad Crystal 
Former Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, who emerged as
America's 53rd hero in the crucial
final days of hostage negotiations, will
be the featured speaker at commence
ment exercises June 14.
"Who could be a more perfect
choice?," said President Donald Ken
nedy when he learned yesterday that
Christopher, a 1949 Stanford Law
School graduate, had accepted the
senior class offer.
Christopher, 55, called the invita
tion "a great honor. Stanford has a
special place in my memories. I am in
debted to the Law 5ch001.... I have a
great deal of admiration for President
Kennedy and for the Stanford educa
tional program," he said.
Christopher, the first editor-in
chief of the Stanford Law Review, was
the chief architect of the last-minute
settlement that freed the 52 hostages
held in Iran. His calm, tenacious
diplomacy throughout the round-the
clock bargaining in Algiers bore out
his State Department nickname,"Mr.
Cool."
Former President Jimmy Carter
paid tribute to his talents when he
awarded Christopher the Medal of
Freedom:
"Warren Christopher has the tact of
a true diplomat, the tactical skills of a
great soldier, the analytical ability of
a fine lawyer and the selfless dedi
cation of a citizen-statesman."
Christopher's Stanford connections
go beyond his law degree.
From 1972 until his State Depart
ment appointment in 1979, he was a
Stanford trustee.
Two of Christopher's four children,
Kristin, a freshman, and Thomas, a
senior, are students here.
Christopher told the Daily that
"having two children at Stanford
caused me some ambivalence (about
speaking here). I didn't want to em

barrass them, but they told me not to
worry, they could bear it."
As editor of the Law Review, Christ
opher forged a close friendship with
classmate Shirley Mount, now Shirley
Hufstedler, who became U.S. secre
tary of education in the Carter admin
istration.
Christopher is remembered by his
peers as an unflappable workaholic.
Hufstedler's husband, Seth, a Los An
geles attorney who also worked on the
Law Review, recalls that "... after
staying up all night to meet the re
view's quarterly deadlines, Chris
looked like he'd just stepped out of the
shower. We called him 'Mr. Neat.'"
Classmate Fred Dutton, a Washing
ton attorney, lauded Christopher as
the kind of diplomat who "can take a

complicated situation, reduce it to es
sentials and turn it into a neat little
package. He never quits until he's
mastered it."
J. Keith Mann, associate dean of the
Law School, commented that Christ
opher "is one of those people who has
the capacity to do almost anything he
sets his mind to."
Christopher has spent the last 30
years alternating between law prac
tice and government jobs.
He arrived in Washington in 1949 as
a law clerk to the late U.S. Supreme
Court Justice William O. Douglas.
Christopher went on to practice law
with the Los Angeles firm of
O'Melveny and Myers starting in 1950,
becoming a partner in 1958. He served
as special counsel to former Demo
cratic Gov. Edmund (Pat) Brown and
in 1965 was vice-chairman of the Mc-
Cone Commission that investigated
the Watts riots.
A native of Scranton, N.D., Christ
opher graduated from USC in 1945
magna cum laude while on active duty
with the Navy.
From 1963-65 he headed the Califor
nia Coordinating Council for Higher
Education and from 1967-69 he was
deputy U.S. Attorney General to Pres
ident Lyndon Johnson.
In 1973 he was one of four men sug
gested by Attorney General Elliot
Richardson to be Watergate prose
cutor. He declined the position, ques
tioning whether it would have the nec
essary independence from the At
torney General.
A member of the Trilateral Com
mission, he has served on the Law
School Board of Visitors and as a
trustee of Occidental College.
Christopher recently returned from
a two week vacation on the island of
Kauai, where he said he had his first
chance to unwind in months. He said
he intends to return to private law
practice.
