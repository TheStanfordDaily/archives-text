# Silence marks shift for Chinese leaders
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — Reading a short ac
count of an interview that Deng
Xiaoping, China's powerful
Communist Party vice-chair
man, had given reporters with a
delegation of French Socialists,
the Chinese people learned that
their country's top leadership
had been going through a major
political crisis — the re
placement of Hua Guofeng as
party chairman — and that it
had now been resolved.
And that was about all there
was on the open record. What
were the issues? Who sided with
whom? How did it begin, what
compromise brought it to an
end? There were numerous
clues, but no official informa
tion in the Chinese news media
to answer these questions.
"This was like watching ef
forts to impeach Richard Nixon
by monitoring his appearances
in the White House rose
garden," said a Chinese-Ameri
can physicist, who is teaching
here.
Many thousands of Chinese
were involved, in fact, in the
major policy debates — they
were more than just a Deng-ver
sus-Hua power struggle — that
went on here in a series of con
ferences through November,

December and January, and an
even larger group is now being
informed through party, gov
ernment and army briefings of
the leadership's decisions, in
cluding the replacement of Hua
by Hu Yaobang, the party's gen
eral secretary and Deng's chief
lieutenant.
Deng ironically found the
changes working against him
last month. When the leader
ship's decisions to replace Hua
and to abandon Maoism were
formally circulated in party
documents and related na
tionwide at "transmission
meetings," there was re
sistance to both, according to in
formed Chinese sources.
Two years ago, when .critical
new posters went up daily on
Beijing's Democracy Wall and
underground political journals
questioned everything, China's
political system seemed in the
throes of tremendous transition
— whether China would remain
Communist was frequently dis
cussed — but the strict limits on
dissent and the renewed in
sistence on the party's leader
ship appeared to end that proc
ess.
The transition is still continu
ing, many Chinese insist, but at
a slower and more easily man
aged pace.
