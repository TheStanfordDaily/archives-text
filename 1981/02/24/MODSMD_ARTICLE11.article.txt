# Advising Associates help frosh

"Oh ... if only I had known
that when I was a freshman!"
"The only time I ever saw my
freshman advisor was to get
him to sign my study list!"
These and similar complaints
about the freshman advising
system at Stanford gave two
students the idea to set up a
peer-advising experiment in
Trancos three years ago
The "experiment" has since
steadily grown into a program
that will serve approximately
630 frosh or nearly one half of
next year's entering class
The Advising Associate (AA)
is an upperclass student that
works with a freshman advisor
in their field of interest to pro
vide frosh with a broader range
of information, ideas and per
spectives about the academic
opportunities at Stanford. All
prospective Advising As
sociates take a two unit training
course Spring Quarter designed
to teach them fundamental peer
counseling skills, approaches to
philosophies of education, and
the academic workings of the
University. Advising Associates
also go through a selection proc
ess which involves a written ap
plication and an interview, all
coordinated through the Aca
demic Information Center.
Dean of Undergraduate Stud
ies Herant Katchadourian said
the Advising Associate program
was developed to try to solve
three major problems which
have plagued the undergraduate
advising systems.
First, Katchadourian said
that "different students have
different needs at different
times." Freshman students
have a wide range of expecta
tions for their advisors, making
it difficult for the advisor to
both fully understand and fulfill
all of these expectations. The
matches between frosh and ad
visors are often necessarily ar
bitrary because of a lack of fac
ulty/staff advisors in a particu
lar field
Katchadourian said that the
second major problem for facul
ty/staff advisors is "time." The
faculty and staff members who
volunteer their time to advise
freshmen undoubtedly have nu
merous other obligations. They
often find it difficult to devote

enough time to their advisees
and subsequently, the frosh feel
neglected
The third and most crucial
problem of the advising system,
according to Katchadourian, is
a simple lack of communica
tion. Freshmen often feel un
easy about taking the initiative
to seek out their advisors for
guidance. This can be either out
of shyness or ignorance of the
potential benefits to be derived
from those "wizened veterans

of academia." If the student is
reluctant to approach his/her
advisor for help, the advisor will
feel that he/she is not needed
and consequently, "no one does
any advising."
The AA program has suc
cessfully alleviated some of
these problems of the under
graduate advising system. It
has helped to define better the
role of the faculty/staff advisor
as a type of "mentor" rather
than purely an information
source. The AA acts not only as
a source of current information
regarding classes, professors
and requirements, but also as a
sort of "communication link"
between the frosh and their ad
visors.
Student co-coordinators Eliz
abeth Budd and Mike Browning
emphasized that an AA's role is
supplementary. " We don't an
ticipate or want AA's to replace
faculty/staff advisors. The
AA's are there to make it easier
for the advisors by answering
nuts-and-bolts' questions about
classes, professors, and re
quirements. This frees the ad
visor to talk to the frosh about
the more general direction their
education will take. We feel the
sooner freshpeople begin to
think in long range terms, the
better: AA's can help facilitate
this kind ofthinking," Budd said

Branner, is very enthusiastic
about the program. He said, "I
don't think advising can work
optimally without AA's. They
take much of the work load off
the advisors. The AA can not,
however, be a substitute for
competent faculty/staff in
volvement in undergraduate ad
vising." Jackson hopes that
potential faculty/staff advisors
will see the benefits provided to
them by the Advising Associate
program. The AA can make
their job not only more relaxing
and comfortable, but also less
time consuming.

of academia." If the student is
reluctant to approach his/her
advisor for help, the advisor will
feel that he/she is not needed
and consequently, "no one does
any advising."
The AA program has suc
cessfully alleviated some of
these problems of the under
graduate advising system. It
has helped to define better the
role of the faculty/staff advisor
as a type of "mentor" rather
than purely an information
source. The AA acts not only as
a source of current information
regarding classes, professors
and requirements, but also as a
sort of "communication link"
between the frosh and their ad
visors.
Student co-coordinators Eliz
abeth Budd and Mike Browning
emphasized that an AA's role is
supplementary. " We don't an
ticipate or want AA's to replace
faculty/staff advisors. The
AA's are there to make it easier
for the advisors by answering
nuts-and-bolts' questions about
classes, professors, and re
quirements. This frees the ad
visor to talk to the frosh about
the more general direction their
education will take. We feel the
sooner freshpeople begin to
think in long range terms, the
better: AA's can help facilitate
this kind ofthinking," Budd said

Branner, is very enthusiastic
about the program. He said, "I
don't think advising can work
optimally without AA's. They
take much of the work load off
the advisors. The AA can not,
however, be a substitute for
competent faculty/staff in
volvement in undergraduate ad
vising." Jackson hopes that
potential faculty/staff advisors
will see the benefits provided to
them by the Advising Associate
program. The AA can make
their job not only more relaxing
and comfortable, but also less
time consuming.

"Oh ... if only I had known
that when I was a freshman!"
"The only time I ever saw my
freshman advisor was to get
him to sign my study list!"
These and similar complaints
about the freshman advising
system at Stanford gave two
students the idea to set up a
peer-advising experiment in
Trancos three years ago
The "experiment" has since
steadily grown into a program
that will serve approximately
630 frosh or nearly one half of
next year's entering class
The Advising Associate (AA)
is an upperclass student that
works with a freshman advisor
in their field of interest to pro
vide frosh with a broader range
of information, ideas and per
spectives about the academic
opportunities at Stanford. All
prospective Advising As
sociates take a two unit training
course Spring Quarter designed
to teach them fundamental peer
counseling skills, approaches to
philosophies of education, and
the academic workings of the
University. Advising Associates
also go through a selection proc
ess which involves a written ap
plication and an interview, all
coordinated through the Aca
demic Information Center.
Dean of Undergraduate Stud
ies Herant Katchadourian said
the Advising Associate program
was developed to try to solve
three major problems which
have plagued the undergraduate
advising systems.
First, Katchadourian said
that "different students have
different needs at different
times." Freshman students
have a wide range of expecta
tions for their advisors, making
it difficult for the advisor to
both fully understand and fulfill
all of these expectations. The
matches between frosh and ad
visors are often necessarily ar
bitrary because of a lack of fac
ulty/staff advisors in a particu
lar field
Katchadourian said that the
second major problem for facul
ty/staff advisors is "time." The
faculty and staff members who
volunteer their time to advise
freshmen undoubtedly have nu
merous other obligations. They
often find it difficult to devote

enough time to their advisees
and subsequently, the frosh feel
neglected
The third and most crucial
problem of the advising system,
according to Katchadourian, is
a simple lack of communica
tion. Freshmen often feel un
easy about taking the initiative
to seek out their advisors for
guidance. This can be either out
of shyness or ignorance of the
potential benefits to be derived
from those "wizened veterans
