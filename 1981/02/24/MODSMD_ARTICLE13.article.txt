# Encina Station senior pub night turns punk
## 
### Karen Springen 
By day many seniors are aspi
ring businessmen, doctors and
lawyers. But by night, they can
become aspiring new wavers.
About 200 punks attended sen
ior new wave night at Encina
Station last Thursday — the
"pub"-licitv was all there.
Picture yourself as a timid,
aspiring new waver. You're
feeling energetic and are will
ing to learn. The computer ter
minals at LOTS just have no ap
peal tonight. You've had a few
too many pizzas at Mountain
. Mike's and are ready for some

thing new.
Some posters put up by the
senior class presidents and core
committee say that a live band.
"Sparkletones," will be
playing. The fast, loud music
(?!) will call for some exhaust
ing dancing — but this will make
up for that day you didn't go run
ning to the Dish last week.
You slick back your hair, don
dark sunglasses (despite the
fact it's 10 p.m.). and cut off a t
shirt that had been destroyed by
the Wilbur dryer anyway. You
even come fashionably (if the
word is appropriate under the

circumstances) late at 10 p.m.
(Rumor has it that 10 p.m. to
11.30 is the peak of pub night.
Since the event has been
billed as a new wave ex
travaganza. you are not prep"-
ared to see so many people with
a warped perception of new
wave — fairisle and Shetland
sweaters outnumbered the cut
off t-shirts. Maybe some people
mistakenly thought the theme
was 19505.
After dancing with wild aban
don. you ask the other new
wavers what they think of the
night at Encina Station Senior

Jaime Romo commented, "This
(Encina i is a pretty good new
wave center. But while Romo
verbally favored the punk
theme, he was not dressed up.
"They stole my glasses and
that's pretty much the essence
of new wave." he claimed.
Many others also shunned
new wave chic. When asked why
she wore a Shetland sweater
rather than a ripped t-shirt. sen
ior Sue Woolev replied. "I only
come to look for boys.''
An enthusiastic punk rocker,
senior Mark McGowan, claimed
to "live for pub night." He

called pub night "yet another
escape trom reality."
Of "Coors," many unin
formed students just came for
beer ($1.50 a pitcher).
According to senior class
president Jamie Halper, "a few
stealthy underclassmen" also
attend pub night each Thursday.
Presidents Halper. Bill Kem
meries. Ina Coleman and Mary
Kllen Rielly started pub night
this year. A few theme nights
are added each quarter.
Regular pub nights do not
have dancing — but all pub
