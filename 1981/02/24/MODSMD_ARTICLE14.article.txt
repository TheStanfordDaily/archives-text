Question: Where's the Overseas Resource Cen
ter (0.R.C.)? Answer: In the Bechtel Interna
tional Center. Next question: Where's the Bechtel
International Center?
That elusive building which many students
know is "over near Tresidder somewhere' is in
fact right in Tresidder parking lot, across from
the Faculty Club. It is a charming ivy-colored
building, easily mistaken for an extension of the
Faculty Club
The O.R.C. is located on the second floor of the
building in a new wing. It is run by Cathy Gamon
and Marcia Makino, both recent Stanford gradu
ates. Their dedication to reaching out and helping
students indicates that this is much more than
just a job to them. Assisting them is the student
travel advisor, Lonn Johnston. He is there Mon
day and Wednesday. 1 to 5 p.m., this quarter.
The O.R.C. has information on work, study, and
travel abroad. Many students are referred there
by the Stanford Overseas Studies office. The Re
source Center processes International Student
I.D. cards, which are good for discounts all over
the world (but predominantly in Western Eu
rope). Often students use the center when plan
ning summer trips. Those going overseas with
Mom and Dad usually don't do their own advance
planning, but when travelling sans parents and on
a budget it is nice to know where one can fulfill

basic needs like eating and sleeping. The O.R.C.
can tell you about youth hostels, railpasses, camp
ing and other inexpensive modes of life.
The O.R.C. has information for students apply
ing for a Rhodes, Churchill. Fulbright, Rotary,
Lurcy or Marshall scholarship. It also has advice
for students considering enrolling in a foreign uni
versity directly, as opposed to a Stanford Over
seas campus. This immerses one in a foreign aca
demic and social life and, in addition, the tuition is
generally a fraction of Stanford's. However, all
paper-work must be handled by the student, in
cluding applications, visas and study permits.
In addition to this information on foreign coun
tries. the O.R.C. has a section dealing with travel
in the U.S. This is there as a service to foreign stu
dents (remember "we" are overseas to them!)
but it is also one that all students may find useful,
from planning a trip to Boston to browsing
through one of their excellent books on San Fran
cisco.
The O.R.C. is open Monday through Friday, 8-12
and 1-5. For students thinking about a trip abroad
or within the U.S., a visit to the O.R.C. should be
high on your agenda. F'or all sedentary types re
maining, it is an interesting way to spend some
time - but a word of warning: faced with pictures
and brochures from exotic places, the travel bug
may bite vou badlv.
