## Oil lease shortsighted 
### 
In his first major action since taking of
fice, Secretary of the Interior James Watt
may have confirmed the fears of environ
mentalists and others that his call for a
balance" between protection and ex
ploitation of natural resources was a code
word for increased deference to business
concerns. Watt recently proposed grant
ing of oil leases over large areas off the
Pacific coast. Despite Watt's formal de
nials. this action is both a significant step
towards increased drilling and explora
tion activity and a strong statement of
government support for the drilling.
The size of the area alone — 1600 miles
and spanning from southern California to
Alaska, off Half Moon Bay and Big Sur —
would compel serious reservations from
all but the most incautious. The most un
settling aspect of Watt's action is that it
advances the timetable of approval of the
leases. There is serious doubt that Interior
itself or its Bureau of Land Management
will be able to conduct an adequate en
vironmental analysis in the time before a
final decision is to be made.
The chance of the proposal's success is
further increased by the disadvantage to
which intervenor organizations have been
put by the sudden announcement and
shortened timetable. Sincere public in
terest organizations, environmental as
sociations, and concerned officials fre
quently contribute much of the data
needed to make sound judgments on such
major and complex administrative ac
tions. By shortening the period of time
that such groups will have to prepare their
opposition. Interior shows its low regard
for precise ecological information and the

role of public participation in the decision
making process. The call for public com
ment is an empty one when, as in this case,
it severely limits or impairs the presenta
tion of complete information or an effec
tive opposition to the announced course of
action.
The ecological disruptions that ex
tended drilling would cause are uncertain
but potentially enormous. Foremost in
most people's minds is the possibility of a
major oil spill like the 1969 Santa Barbara
disaster that covered thirty miles of beach
with more than a million gallons of oil.
There are also the unknown effects of
chronic low level spills and the physical
and chemical disturbances attendant on
the exploration and drilling alone.
The targeted areas were originally ex
cluded from oil company activity because
of a strong imbalance between ecological
vulnerability and the likelihood of actually
finding oil. They include some particular
ly unique and fragile areas of the coast, re
quiring the greatest study and precaution.
Watt's announcement disregards
ecological susceptibility and fails to dem
onstrate a concern for actually discover
ing oil.
Proponents of the extended leases say
they are necessary to reduce dependence
on foreign energy supplies. It seems short
sighted to further pursue what is probably
a minimal quantity of a finite resource
and to call that preparation for future
needs. Interior should eschew risking se
vere environmental damage for so limited
and vacuous an end in favor of plans that
create energy for today while preserving
both energy sources and the natural state
of the seas and beaches for tomorrow.
