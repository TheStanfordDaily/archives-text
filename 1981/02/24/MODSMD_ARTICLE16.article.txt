# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Harold Montgomery Students undergo 'major' decision 
### 
Surely, one of the toughest de
cisions facing the under
graduate today is the inevitable
choice of a major. How even to
begin the process remains a se
cret. Most students wake up one
day. finding themselves warmly
enshrouded in the pre-planned
curriculum of this or that ma
jor. Those with a lot of time and
money on their hands claim that
such a decision is best made
through an empirical process of
smorgasbord course selection
during freshman year. The un
derlying assumption is that any
one will find something
of interest. If not, you can at
least design your own in
terdisciplinary major. The fire
of history, the romance of
chemistry, or the mysticism of
macro-economics will each in
their turn entrance the open
minded student who will then
pursue one of them further.
While I do not wish to dis
credit the eclectic method of
choosing a major, I do wish to
offer a somewhat more prac
tical, simpler, and less time
consuming alternative. After
all, if one could decide on a ma
jor right away, one could save a

lot of time usually spent failing
pre-med courses, and walk
away with a degree in three
years, thereby saving lots of tui
tion money.
Why not choose a major based
on tangible observations about
the prospective department?
Most importantly, what kind of
building has your department
got? How comfortable is it? Af
ter all, if the average human
spends one-third of his time
sleeping, then the average stu
dent must spend at least that
much time in class. Are the
chairs comfortable? Is the Dai
ly delivered there? (Well, I had
better not go too far). One really
should consider these salient
points. I am all for getting ex
cited about classes, but it is so
much easier to do while recum
bent in the oak-paneled splendor
of the history corner. Instantly,
several majors pop into mind.
Economics. You can not be an
economics major. I know that
statement will bring in a lot of
mail, but economics is not a pos
sible choice. The reason is
simple: you will not be able to
find the department. I took
Econ. 1 freshman vear, and I

have spent the last two years
trying to find the office to pick
up my exam. I still have not de
cided whether or not to declare
pass/fail.
Chemistry. Someone pulled a
funny here. They put this pretty
nice chemistry building way
away from anywhere. They ru
ined a perfectly good major. I
cannot figure out why people
still take chemistry. You have
to go way out of your way to get
there, and the building is not
that great when you arrive. Per
haps University planners knew
that anyone who wants to get
rich has to take chemistry. As
suming the above, why crowd
the quad with an unnecessary
chemistry building? This major
ruins my selection process.
History. This choice is the ob
vious one. The History corner
has to be the greatest classroom
environment east of the psy
chology building. The rooms are
spacious, the chairs com
fortable, and the blackboards
new. Not only that, but there is
always soap in the bathrooms.
What more could you want? It
continually shocks me that not
everyone is a history major. Un
doubtedly, though, the most out
standing attribute of the History

corner is the carpet. This mag
nificent floor-covering spans
the expanse of four floors; its
engaging geometric pattern
leading the eye quickly, yet
hesitantly, toward the oak-pan
eled walls. Its remarkably
sprightly color pattern leaps
forward from the intricate knot
ting, worthy of the finest hand
weavers of ancient Persia. Yes,
the History corner is a re
markable edifice.
Interdisciplinary. Having
trouble deciding? Do what I did
— don't decide. Take Interna
tional Relations or design your
own interdisciplinary major.
That way, you can have ev
erything. You can talk about the
Byzantine, dismal English De
partment, while reclining in the
comfort of the political science
lounge.
Choosing a major can be dif
ficult and time consuming. But
when you are experiencing the
hostility of a straight-backed
wooden chair, you will agree
there is something to be said for
taking in all the variables.

through an empirical process of
smorgasbord course selection
during freshman year. The un
derlying assumption is that any
one will find something
of interest. If not, you can at
least design your own in
terdisciplinary major. The fire
of history, the romance of
chemistry, or the mysticism of
macro-economics will each in
their turn entrance the open
minded student who will then
pursue one of them further.
While I do not wish to dis
credit the eclectic method of
choosing a major, I do wish to
offer a somewhat more prac
tical, simpler, and less time
consuming alternative. After
all, if one could decide on a ma
jor right away, one could save a

lot of time usually spent failing
pre-med courses, and walk
away with a degree in three
years, thereby saving lots of tui
tion money.
Why not choose a major based
on tangible observations about
the prospective department?
Most importantly, what kind of
building has your department
got? How comfortable is it? Af
ter all, if the average human
spends one-third of his time
sleeping, then the average stu
dent must spend at least that
much time in class. Are the
chairs comfortable? Is the Dai
ly delivered there? (Well, I had
better not go too far). One really
should consider these salient
points. I am all for getting ex
cited about classes, but it is so
much easier to do while recum
bent in the oak-paneled splendor
of the history corner. Instantly,
several majors pop into mind.
Economics. You can not be an
economics major. I know that
statement will bring in a lot of
mail, but economics is not a pos
sible choice. The reason is
simple: you will not be able to
find the department. I took
Econ. 1 freshman vear, and I

have spent the last two years
trying to find the office to pick
up my exam. I still have not de
cided whether or not to declare
pass/fail.
Chemistry. Someone pulled a
funny here. They put this pretty
nice chemistry building way
away from anywhere. They ru
ined a perfectly good major. I
cannot figure out why people
still take chemistry. You have
to go way out of your way to get
there, and the building is not
that great when you arrive. Per
haps University planners knew
that anyone who wants to get
rich has to take chemistry. As
suming the above, why crowd
the quad with an unnecessary
chemistry building? This major
ruins my selection process.
History. This choice is the ob
vious one. The History corner
has to be the greatest classroom
environment east of the psy
chology building. The rooms are
spacious, the chairs com
fortable, and the blackboards
new. Not only that, but there is
always soap in the bathrooms.
What more could you want? It
continually shocks me that not
everyone is a history major. Un
doubtedly, though, the most out
standing attribute of the History

corner is the carpet. This mag
nificent floor-covering spans
the expanse of four floors; its
engaging geometric pattern
leading the eye quickly, yet
hesitantly, toward the oak-pan
eled walls. Its remarkably
sprightly color pattern leaps
forward from the intricate knot
ting, worthy of the finest hand
weavers of ancient Persia. Yes,
the History corner is a re
markable edifice.
Interdisciplinary. Having
trouble deciding? Do what I did
— don't decide. Take Interna
tional Relations or design your
own interdisciplinary major.
That way, you can have ev
erything. You can talk about the
Byzantine, dismal English De
partment, while reclining in the
comfort of the political science
lounge.
Choosing a major can be dif
ficult and time consuming. But
when you are experiencing the
hostility of a straight-backed
wooden chair, you will agree
there is something to be said for
taking in all the variables.

Surely, one of the toughest de
cisions facing the under
graduate today is the inevitable
choice of a major. How even to
begin the process remains a se
cret. Most students wake up one
day. finding themselves warmly
enshrouded in the pre-planned
curriculum of this or that ma
jor. Those with a lot of time and
money on their hands claim that
such a decision is best made
through an empirical process of
smorgasbord course selection
during freshman year. The un
derlying assumption is that any
one will find something
of interest. If not, you can at
least design your own in
terdisciplinary major. The fire
