## U.S. foreign policy traditionally anti-human rights 
### 
Recent accounts from Am
nesty International and person
al accounts from American
journalists abroad (Harper's
magazine, March 1981) have
well documented the brutal and
murderous policies of the right
wing government in El Salvador
now receiving military as
sistance from the United States.
The "civilian-military junta,"
as called by the State Depart

ment, is accountable to no one in
the country. The civilian author
ity is merely a front for the ex
treme right wing military es
tablishment.
Most importantly, the pres
ent government has demon
strated an unyielding willing
ness to brutally suppress all
voices of dissent regardless of
political orientation. Moderate
and pacifist forces such as the

clergy, Christian Democrats,
and peasant groups have been
brutally suppressed and ter
rorized throughout the country.
(The murders of the Arch
bishop of El Salvador, three
American nuns and literally
thousands of defenseless
peasants are the most striking
examples of this practice.) The
radical left in El Salvador, the
only group initially committed
to violent struggle, is gaining
prestige among the moderates
because of these brutal prac
tices.
What can be the only result of
this radicalization of moderate
forces in El Salvador? More vio
lence, death and destruction.
The irony is that, contrary to
U.S. claims of Soviet and Cuban
backed insurgent forces in
filtrating the country to subvert
the will of the Salvadorean peo
ple, the United States has radi
calized the moderate forces in
that country through its mili
tary support of the vastly un
popular right wing regime.
Yet the El Salvador case is
not in any sense a new departure
for U.S. foreign policy. The
tradition of militarily assisting
unpopular right wing regimes in
the Third World extends back
over a half of a century. Numer
ous examples include Carter in
Nicaragua in the late 70s, Nix
on in Chile in the early '70s,
Johnson in the Dominican Re
public in the '60s, Eisenhower in
Guatemala in the '50s, Herbert
Hoover in Nicaragua in the '30s
installing the Somoza dynasty,
and the Vietnam War. There is
no need to belabor the obvious;
the central question is why?
The traditional justification
used to defend U.S. traditional
support of oppressive right wing
dictatorships is the threat of
communism. Allegedly, without
such military support, com
munist-led insurgents backed
by the Soviet Union would in
filtrate these "defenseless"

countries and institute a reign of
left wing terrorism, thereby
subverting the entire free
world. This argument is as old
as the Soviet state itself, even
before that state was theo
retically powerful enough to in
stitute its "reign of terror."
This narrow-minded and sim
plistic view of the world con
sistently fails to recognize two
very salient aspects of the
geopolitical reality of the in
ternational environment in gen
eral and the internal political in
vironment of many third world
countries.
First, it fails to acknowledge
the increasingly limited power
of the United States and the So
viet Union to dominate the
evolution of third world popu
lar, egalitarian movements. If
there is one lesson to be learned
from the disastrous U.S. ex
perience in Vietnam, it is that a
superpower such as the U.S. can
succeed only in escalating the
severity and*brutality, but not
the nature of any internal con
flict in a third world country.
Second, it overlooks the fact
that many, if not all, of the popu
lar reformist movements in
these countries are not com
munist or Marxist in nature.
Time and time again, impartial
observers have noted that com
munists comprise only a small
portion of very broad based pop
ular movements comprising So
cial Democrats, Pacifists, dis
satisfied peasant groups, and
religious leaders. To assert that
these popular movements
against unnecessary oppression
have the intention of subverting
the entire free world, or even
that they are always "com
munist-led'.' movements is
sheer nonsense, if not deliberate
falsification.
If the traditional justification
of U.S. support of right wing dic
tatorships ignores these two es
sential realities of the complexi

ty of the international environ
ment and the nature of the popu
lar egalitarian movements in
Third World countries, how are
we to judge such contradictory
U.S. stands? Are U.S. leaders
unaware of the facts, or are they
exploiting them to ensure corpo
rate economic interest in the
United States? Shall U.S. policy
be interpreted in terms of the
"misperception" or "concep
tual bias" model? Shall these
same leaders be absolved of re
sponsibility for their actions be
cause they are seen as the vic
tims of ignorance or of a "condi
tioning process? Or shall they
be found guilty of unnecessarily
denying the poor people of the
world the same right to the
basic civil liberties which we
enjoy in our country - all for the
selfish design of ensuring the ef
ficient functioning of the U.S
economy?
Whatever interpretation you
choose, the consequences of
continued U.S. assistance will
always be to radicalize mod
erate forces in those move
ments, to increase the prestige
of the violent factions within
those movements, and thereby
to ensure a violent resolution of
the conflict. Increasing the
forces of oppression, contrary
to popular belief, will not end
the struggle for freedom; it will
just raise the stakes of the out
come.
No superpower, even the
United States with all of its mili
tary capability, can end the
struggle for freedom. Continued
U.S. military assistance to au
thoritarian regimes will, how
ever, as it has in the past, drive
moderate forces of change to
the abyss of violence. It will
cause these reformist elements
to detest U.S. power all the
more and drive them to accept
Soviet assistance even when
there was no initial desire to do
so.
Herein lies the ultimate con

tradiction of traditional U.S.
policy toward Third World coun
tries: it is not only \mmoral
with respect to the poor, but also
counterproductive to long-term
U.S. security interests. Those
popular movements which do
achieve power will inevitably be
hostile to the very country
which callously impeded their
struggle toward freedom. U.S.
leaders have been so blinded by
their own narrow-minded view
of the world that they have
failed to see that morality (de
fense of human rights) and self
interest (U.S. security in
terests) are not necessarily in
compatible.
The Soviet Union has also
demonstrated little concern for
the poor in Third World coun
tries. In this respect it is less a
revolutionary power seeking to
eradicate injustice than a sta
tus-quo power seeking power,
influence, and a secure econom
ic base. Needless to say, all of
the negative comments directed
to the United States apply to the
Soviet leadership as well.
But many of these third world
popular movements are not con
cerned with the ideological
rhetoric of the Soviet Union or
the United States. These popu
lar movements are most con
cerned with significant reform,
freedom of dissent and a more
equal distribution of the limited
economic resources. They will
do whatever is necessary to

achieve the above, peacefully \l
possible, but violently if neces
sary.
The issue today in the Third
World then is not ideology; the
issue is justice. Neither capital
ist nor socialist countries
among the industrialized na
tions have a firm grasp on this
elusive commodity. There are
no perfect models for social or
ganization. In every society,
there must be a trade off be
tween personal liberty (the
right to pursue one's own self in
terest) and justice (what is best
for the society). If U.S. leaders
are really interested in further
ing the causes of freedom and
justice, military assistance to
all Third World dictatorships
should be stopped.
Most human beings, however,
prefer to reform their lives
peacefully. This is as it should
be. But if conditions get bad
enough, even the most ordinary
people will risk their life in the
face of the uncertainty of death
to preserve what little dignity
they have left. This is what the
people of El Salvador are doing
now. In their confused struggle
for freedom against the forces
of oppression lies our only hope
for the future and the nucleus
for a better vision of society.
