# The 						Soviet Union wants normal relations with the United States'
## Haig comments on Brezhnev's speech 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” Secretary of State
Alexander Haig said late yesterday
that the United States is very in
terested in Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev's "remarkable innova
tions" regarding a summit conference
with President Ronald Reagan and
new talks concerning SALT 11.
His statement came after Reagan
also expressed cautious interest in
Brezhnev's remarks to the 26th Com
munist Party Congress in Moscow, ac
cording to White House Press Secre
tary James Brady.
Haig, commenting after a five-hour
meeting with visiting Foreign Min
ister Jean Francois-Poncet of France,
said, "It's clear that we are very in
terested in what Mr. Brezhnev had to
say. There were new and remarkable
innovations in that speech."
Francois-Poncet said that Brezhnev
seemed to be expressing "a willing
ness toward a dialogue which is, I
think, something that ought to be
picked up."
Brezhnev coupled his offer to re
negotiate the moribund second
strategic arms limitation agreement
with a call for negotiations to limit
missile-firing submarines and to ban
work on new missiles for such sub
marines.
This position reflects Moscow's
long-standing concern about the big,
longer-ranged U.S. Trident missile
submarines now being built.
"Brezhnev's price for reopening

SALT 11, as Reagan wants, will ap
parently be to expand its scope to cov
er submarine-launched ballistic mis
siles," one U.S. official said.
Reagan's daily national security
briefing was expanded to include addi
tional officials who discussed
Brezhnev's five-hour address, as well
as events in El Salvador, Brady said.
Reagan will discuss the Brezhnev
speech in detail with his advisers "in
the near future," Brady said, and also
will consult with U.S. allies before
making any decision on a summit con
ference.
Brady suggested that Brezhnev's
summit offer was an effort to appear
conciliatory in the world's eyes after
being stung by Reagan administration
criticism of the Soviet role in support
ing leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.
"The Soviets have a history and pat
tern of good guy-bad guy tactics,"
Brady said.
U.S. analysts said that Brezhnev's
speech appeared to be an attempt to
portray the Soviets as deliberate and
statesmanlike, in contrast to the sharp
attacks against Moscow that Reagan
and Haig have delivered in the past
month.
The analysts said the Soviets want
to appear to the world as the peace
loving champion of detente. Accord
ing to Moscow's reasoning, detente is
in trouble only because what Brezhnev
called the "acutely increased U.S. ag
gressiveness."
Nonetheless, Brezhnev's sugges

tions for a summit and his proposals
concerning SALT II represent a de
parture from past Soviet positions, an
alysts agreed.
Summit meetings usually are held
to formalize agreements already ne
gotiated at lower levels. Brezhnev re
peatedly refused to meet former Pres
ident Jimmy Carter, for example, un
til 1979 when the SALT II agreement
had been prepared for their signa
tures.
Carter withdrew that agreement
from the congressional ratification
process after the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan. Now Reagan has branded
that agreement "fatally flawed" and
has urged its rejection by Congress.
When suggestions of renegotiation
were made, the Soviets at first flatly
refused, then slightly modified their
stand.
But Brezhnev said yesterday that
"the limitation and reduction of
strategic arms is a paramount prob
lem" in international relations. The
Soviet Union, he said, is "prepared to
continue the relevant negotiations
with the United States without delay,
preserving all the positive elements
that so far have been achieved in this
area."
In another passage, Brezhnev said,
"we are prepared to come to terms on
limiting the deployment of new sub
marines ... We could also agree to
banning the modernization of existing,
and the development of new, ballistic
missiles for these submarines."

The first of the Trident submarines,
with 24 missiles that have a larger
range and greater accuracy than their
predecessors, will soon begin sea
trials. The Soviets have launched a 20-
missile version, the Typhoon, but have
encountered serious difficulty in de
veloping a missile for it, analysts said
