# 'California education needs all the help it can get'
## State high schools failing 
### Los Angeles Times 
There is growing evidence of
a serious deterioration of quali
ty in California public high
schools, and officials in both the
state's huge public higher
education system and those at
private institutions say the situ
ation is more serious than they
had realized.
"No matter how you cut it,
the high school youngsters are
not doing as well as they should
do," says state Superintendent
of Public Instruction Wilson
Riles.
Some of the evidence;
— When tested as third
graders, California pupils are
above the national norm, but
12th graders score well below
the national norm. A year ago,
in fact, California high school
seniors ranked in the bottom
third nationally.
— A report now circulating
around the University of Cali
fornia indicates that college ap
titude test scores of entering
freshman have declined on ev
ery UC campus except
Berkeley.
— Large numbers of entering
UC freshmen must take re
medial work in writing or
mathematics or both.
— A College Board study
found that California high
school students generally take
fewer courses in such key aca
demic areas as English, math
and science than the national
average.
— Last fall the proportion of
California applicants who were
accepted at Stanford University
dropped significantly — from 21
percent in fall, 1979, to 17 per
cent a year later.
Other highly selective schools
which, like Stanford, attract na
tional student bodies, also re
ported a decline in the quality of
their California applicants.
Faced with that evidence,
state educators are becoming
alarmed.
"California education needs
all the help it can get," Alice
Cox, UC assistant vice president
lor student academic services,
said in a recent interview. "The
situation is more than serious.
It's almost devastating.
"The economy of this state
has always depended on technol
ogy and new ideas," Cox said.
"If we don't produce the stu
dents to meet those needs we're
going to be in a lot of trouble."
In a speech last fall. Prof.
Michael Kirst of the Stanford
School of Education, until re-

cently president of the State
Board of Education, said, "It's
surprising and alarming to see
students in the world's most ad
vanced technological state tak
ing courses more appropriate
for a relatively backward re
gion."
How did this state of affairs
come about?
During an hour's discussion
with the UC Board of Regents's
educational policy committee
last week, Riles said that he did
not know, but he suggested sev
eral possible causes: too many
one-parent families; too much
television watching; poor teach
er attitudes and poor teacher
preparation; drugs; alcohol
ism, and the host of poverty-re
lated problems that plague in
ner-city schools.
Others believe the decline in
achievement can be traced to
budget cuts, especially to those
brought about since the 1978 pas
sage of Proposition 13, the tax
cutting state constitutional
amendment.
Budget cuts have led to
elimination of sixth period in
many high schools, curtailment
of advanced classes for the
brightest students and dis
missal of college counselors.
Still others blame the steady
erosion of the high school cur
riculum as solid academic sub
jects are replaced by such ac
tivities as driver education,
physical education and "student
leadership."
"We found that in school after
school, the extra-curricular is
forcing out the solid subjects,"
said Fred Hargadon, dean of ad
missions at Stanford, which re
viewed 12,731 applications to fill
about 1500 places in this year's
freshman class.
Hargadon pointed to the high
school transcript of a student
who received a straight "A" av
erage in 10th, 11th and 12th
grades but included were such
courses as driver education,
student leadership, yearbook,
school paper and recreation.
That student was not ac
cepted.
"Another problem is that
each of these areas such as
driver education has its consti
tuency, its lobbyists,"
Hargadon said. "Once one of
these things gets into the cur
riculum, it's awfully hard to get
it out. And there is no lobbyist
for solid academic subjects."
Said Kirst, "As the schools re
spond to new demands for bil
ingual programs, education for

the handicapped and minimum
proficiency tests, the trend
toward fewer and fewer aca
demic courses is accelerating."
The secondary school cur
riculum tends to be a "zero sum
game," he said. "Whenever
something new goes in, some
thing else must go out.
"These days that tends to be
the low enrollment course in ad
vanced math, science or lan
guages. Teachers are being
shifted from these areas to help
students pass basic proficiency
tests, mandated by state law."
The decline in quality is not
limited to schools that enroll
large numbers of low-income
and/or minority students.
"It's not a minority prob
lem," said Sandra Smith, a UC
analyst. "Whatever it is that
has happened, it's happening to
everybody."
Nationally, the decline in high
school quality has prompted for
mation of two special study
groups.
A thorough examination of
American high schools, the first
in 20 years, will be undertaken
by a task force headed by Theo
dore Sizer, former dean of
education at Harvard Univer
sity and now headmaster of
Phillips Academy in Andover,
Mass.
In California, the State Board
of Education is urging local
school districts to review cur
riculum, with an eye to
strengthening academic sub
jects and reducing frills.
Riles suggested that UC
might change from requiring
certain courses to requiring that
a certain level of proficiency be
demonstrated in a given sub
ject.

dents to meet those needs we're
going to be in a lot of trouble."
In a speech last fall. Prof.
Michael Kirst of the Stanford
School of Education, until re-

cently president of the State
Board of Education, said, "It's
surprising and alarming to see
students in the world's most ad
vanced technological state tak
ing courses more appropriate
for a relatively backward re
gion."
How did this state of affairs
come about?
During an hour's discussion
with the UC Board of Regents's
educational policy committee
last week, Riles said that he did
not know, but he suggested sev
eral possible causes: too many
one-parent families; too much
television watching; poor teach
er attitudes and poor teacher
preparation; drugs; alcohol
ism, and the host of poverty-re
lated problems that plague in
ner-city schools.
Others believe the decline in
achievement can be traced to
budget cuts, especially to those
brought about since the 1978 pas
sage of Proposition 13, the tax
cutting state constitutional
amendment.
Budget cuts have led to
elimination of sixth period in
many high schools, curtailment
of advanced classes for the
brightest students and dis
missal of college counselors.
Still others blame the steady
erosion of the high school cur
riculum as solid academic sub
jects are replaced by such ac
tivities as driver education,
physical education and "student
leadership."
"We found that in school after
school, the extra-curricular is
forcing out the solid subjects,"
said Fred Hargadon, dean of ad
missions at Stanford, which re
viewed 12,731 applications to fill
about 1500 places in this year's
freshman class.
Hargadon pointed to the high
school transcript of a student
who received a straight "A" av
erage in 10th, 11th and 12th
grades but included were such
courses as driver education,
student leadership, yearbook,
school paper and recreation.
That student was not ac
cepted.
"Another problem is that
each of these areas such as
driver education has its consti
tuency, its lobbyists,"
Hargadon said. "Once one of
these things gets into the cur
riculum, it's awfully hard to get
it out. And there is no lobbyist
for solid academic subjects."
Said Kirst, "As the schools re
spond to new demands for bil
ingual programs, education for

the handicapped and minimum
proficiency tests, the trend
toward fewer and fewer aca
demic courses is accelerating."
The secondary school cur
riculum tends to be a "zero sum
game," he said. "Whenever
something new goes in, some
thing else must go out.
"These days that tends to be
the low enrollment course in ad
vanced math, science or lan
guages. Teachers are being
shifted from these areas to help
students pass basic proficiency
tests, mandated by state law."
The decline in quality is not
limited to schools that enroll
large numbers of low-income
and/or minority students.
"It's not a minority prob
lem," said Sandra Smith, a UC
analyst. "Whatever it is that
has happened, it's happening to
everybody."
Nationally, the decline in high
school quality has prompted for
mation of two special study
groups.
A thorough examination of
American high schools, the first
in 20 years, will be undertaken
by a task force headed by Theo
dore Sizer, former dean of
education at Harvard Univer
sity and now headmaster of
Phillips Academy in Andover,
Mass.
In California, the State Board
of Education is urging local
school districts to review cur
riculum, with an eye to
strengthening academic sub
jects and reducing frills.
Riles suggested that UC
might change from requiring
certain courses to requiring that
a certain level of proficiency be
demonstrated in a given sub
ject.
There is growing evidence of
a serious deterioration of quali
ty in California public high
schools, and officials in both the
state's huge public higher
education system and those at
private institutions say the situ
ation is more serious than they
had realized.
"No matter how you cut it,
the high school youngsters are
not doing as well as they should
do," says state Superintendent
of Public Instruction Wilson
Riles.
Some of the evidence;
— When tested as third
graders, California pupils are
above the national norm, but
12th graders score well below
the national norm. A year ago,
in fact, California high school
seniors ranked in the bottom
third nationally.
— A report now circulating
around the University of Cali
fornia indicates that college ap
titude test scores of entering
freshman have declined on ev
ery UC campus except
Berkeley.
— Large numbers of entering
UC freshmen must take re
medial work in writing or
mathematics or both.
— A College Board study
found that California high
school students generally take
fewer courses in such key aca
demic areas as English, math
and science than the national
average.
— Last fall the proportion of
California applicants who were
accepted at Stanford University
dropped significantly — from 21
percent in fall, 1979, to 17 per
cent a year later.
Other highly selective schools
which, like Stanford, attract na
tional student bodies, also re
ported a decline in the quality of
their California applicants.
Faced with that evidence,
state educators are becoming
alarmed.
"California education needs
all the help it can get," Alice
Cox, UC assistant vice president
lor student academic services,
said in a recent interview. "The
situation is more than serious.
It's almost devastating.
"The economy of this state
has always depended on technol
ogy and new ideas," Cox said.
"If we don't produce the stu
dents to meet those needs we're
going to be in a lot of trouble."
