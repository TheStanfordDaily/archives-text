# East PA hopes for incorporation
## 
### Richard Ross 
Community leaders in East
Palo Alto claim that San Mateo
county is siphoning off $50 mil
lion a year in taxes from this
predominately black area. And,
they claim, the county is trying
to prevent black leaders from
incorporating East Palo Alto
into a self-governed city, a
move that would put an end to
this alleged subjugation.
East Palo Alto Mayor
Barbara Mounton and
Carmeleit Oaks, convener of the
East Palo Alto Citizen's Com
mittee, said in a forum held last
Thursday that leaders in East
Palo Alto have been trying for
the last several years to develop
a movement to incorporate the
area into a bona fide city.
They claim that the move to
incorporate will give area resi
dents control over internal af
fairs such as police and fire de
partments, zoning, tax collec
tion, sanitation, water works
and other municipal services.
These services are currently ad
ministered by the county of San
Mateo.
Even though the effort to in
corporate is well under way,

Mounton and Oaks report that
the area's residents have met
with stiff resistance from coun
ty officals. According to the
speakers, the San Mateo Coun
ty's Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO), the leg
islative body that handles in
corporation requests, has mis
led and deceived East Palo Alto
residents in favor of incorpora
tion.
Mounton charged that LAF
CO told the citizen's committee
that 25 percent of the registered
voters in East Palo Alto had to
sign petitions in favor of in
corporation before the issue
would even be considered by the
county, when in fact the law pro
vided that only 5 percent are re
quired to sign.
Mounton and Oaks believe
that LAFCO and the county of
San Mateo do not want to let
East Palo Alto incorporate be
cause "they do not think that
East Palo Alto is ready, and
able, to govern itself. They do
not think that East Palo Altans
can make the right decisions."
Oaks charges that when the
board of supervisors for San
Mateo county found out that the

East Palo Alto incorporation
drive was gaining momentum,
the board moved ahead with
zoning regulations which would
effectively frustrate the East
Palo Altans' efforts toward self
determination.
According to Oaks, the Board
of Supervisors is trying to zone
parts of EPA for "big com
panies that will come in and
build expensive plants and bring
along with those plants high
priced housing primarily for
professional whites."
Oaks continued, saying that
"when you talk about urban re
newal in the United States,
you're talking about urban re
moval."
Oaks said that the supervisors
are moving quickly on the de
velopments, and that time is be
coming a factor in the in
corporation battle.
Even if the citizen's commit
tee manages to get the signa
tures neccesary to bring the in
corporation issue to bear on
LAFCO and the Board of Super
visors, Mounton and Oaks are
fearful that the county will
"change the rules to keep us
beat" and lengthy delays would

be necessary before incorpora
tion efforts could resume.
Already LAFCO has de
veloped a feasibility study for
the proposal plan which claims
that, from a logistical stand
point, incorporation is neither
feasible nor practical.
Mounton and Oaks say they
can disprove LAFCO's findings,
and that their evidence comes
from an environmental impact
report prepared for the citizen's
committee for incorporation by
SRI International in Menlo
Park.
This report finds that almost
all of the "unavoidable negative
impacts listed in the LAFCO re
port on incorporation are either
incorrect, unsubstantiated or
purely subjective." The report
concludes that, "it is our opin
ion that incorporation is, in fact,
feasible and justifiable for the
East Palo Alto area.''
The disparity between SRI
and LAFCO's reports are not
surprising to Mounton and Oaks,
who claim, "there must be
something that the county
wants and they don't want to let
go of it."

velopments, and that time is be
coming a factor in the in
corporation battle.
Even if the citizen's commit
tee manages to get the signa
tures neccesary to bring the in
corporation issue to bear on
LAFCO and the Board of Super
visors, Mounton and Oaks are
fearful that the county will
"change the rules to keep us
beat" and lengthy delays would

be necessary before incorpora
tion efforts could resume.
Already LAFCO has de
veloped a feasibility study for
the proposal plan which claims
that, from a logistical stand
point, incorporation is neither
feasible nor practical.
Mounton and Oaks say they
can disprove LAFCO's findings,
and that their evidence comes
from an environmental impact
report prepared for the citizen's
committee for incorporation by
SRI International in Menlo
Park.
This report finds that almost
all of the "unavoidable negative
impacts listed in the LAFCO re
port on incorporation are either
incorrect, unsubstantiated or
purely subjective." The report
concludes that, "it is our opin
ion that incorporation is, in fact,
feasible and justifiable for the
East Palo Alto area.''
The disparity between SRI
and LAFCO's reports are not
surprising to Mounton and Oaks,
who claim, "there must be
something that the county
wants and they don't want to let
go of it."
Community leaders in East
Palo Alto claim that San Mateo
county is siphoning off $50 mil
lion a year in taxes from this
predominately black area. And,
they claim, the county is trying
to prevent black leaders from
incorporating East Palo Alto
into a self-governed city, a
move that would put an end to
this alleged subjugation.
East Palo Alto Mayor
Barbara Mounton and
Carmeleit Oaks, convener of the
East Palo Alto Citizen's Com
mittee, said in a forum held last
Thursday that leaders in East
Palo Alto have been trying for
the last several years to develop
a movement to incorporate the
area into a bona fide city.
They claim that the move to
incorporate will give area resi
dents control over internal af
fairs such as police and fire de
partments, zoning, tax collec
tion, sanitation, water works
and other municipal services.
These services are currently ad
ministered by the county of San
Mateo.
Even though the effort to in
corporate is well under way,

Mounton and Oaks report that
the area's residents have met
with stiff resistance from coun
ty officals. According to the
speakers, the San Mateo Coun
ty's Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO), the leg
islative body that handles in
corporation requests, has mis
led and deceived East Palo Alto
residents in favor of incorpora
tion.
Mounton charged that LAF
CO told the citizen's committee
that 25 percent of the registered
voters in East Palo Alto had to
sign petitions in favor of in
corporation before the issue
would even be considered by the
county, when in fact the law pro
vided that only 5 percent are re
quired to sign.
Mounton and Oaks believe
that LAFCO and the county of
San Mateo do not want to let
East Palo Alto incorporate be
cause "they do not think that
East Palo Alto is ready, and
able, to govern itself. They do
not think that East Palo Altans
can make the right decisions."
Oaks charges that when the
board of supervisors for San
Mateo county found out that the

East Palo Alto incorporation
drive was gaining momentum,
the board moved ahead with
zoning regulations which would
effectively frustrate the East
Palo Altans' efforts toward self
determination.
According to Oaks, the Board
of Supervisors is trying to zone
parts of EPA for "big com
panies that will come in and
build expensive plants and bring
along with those plants high
priced housing primarily for
professional whites."
Oaks continued, saying that
"when you talk about urban re
newal in the United States,
you're talking about urban re
moval."
Oaks said that the supervisors
are moving quickly on the de
velopments, and that time is be
coming a factor in the in
corporation battle.
Even if the citizen's commit
tee manages to get the signa
tures neccesary to bring the in
corporation issue to bear on
LAFCO and the Board of Super
visors, Mounton and Oaks are
fearful that the county will
