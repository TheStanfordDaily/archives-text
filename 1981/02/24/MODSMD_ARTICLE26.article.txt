## So sorry, Mr. Chan: you're a real dog 
### Steve Vineberg 
When the credits appear at
the beginning of Charlie Chan
and the Curse of the Dragon
Queen, two editors are listed —
a bad sign. Unless a film is an
epic like Tess or a complex tech
nical achievement like The Em
pire Strikes Hack, the acknowl
edgement of more than one su
pervising editor usually means
that the movie was in trouble
and more than one attempt was
made to bail it out — and by that
time it's already too late. A
brigade of cutters couldn't have
saved Charlie Chan: this pic
ture was beyond the pale the day
shooting began.
The Charlie Chan series in the
'30s and '40s was stodgy, and the
scripts were hammered togeth

er with an offhand clutziness.
Audiences enjoyed them as one
might enjoy an episode of a mys
tery anthology program on TV
or a pedestrian thriller picked
up in an airport or train station.
The threadbare quality of the
movies, which looked like they
had been made for the amount
of money it would have taken to
buy the cast and crew breakfast
at Howard Johnson's probably
appealed to filmgoers, too. as
well as the energetic terrible ac
ting of the familiar Fox contract
players.
You'd have to have an amaz
ingly deft hand to parody some
thing as slight as the Charlie
Chan pictures, and even then
I'm not sure it would be worth
the bother. (They might have

provided material for a good
five minutes on 77u- Carol
Burnett Show.) To put it as
kindly as possible, the writers of
Charlie Chan and the Curse of
the Dragon Queen, Stan Burns
and David Axelrod, and the di
rector, Clive Donner, are
egregious bumblers. In a pair of
black and white flashbacks, we
are shown the resolution of a
case Chan (Peter Ustinov) was
involved in some 25 or 30 years
ago; the murderess, the Dragon
Queen (Angie Dickinson, wear
ing a long straight wig and
trying to appear Oriental),
cursed Chan just before making
her final exit. Now she has re
surfaced in San Francisco, just
as a string of bizarre murders
draws Chan back to the city,

where his grandson Lee (Rich
ard Hatch) has begun a detec
tive agency. (Neither Ustinov
nor Dickinson nor Lee Grant,
whose husband was the murder
victim in the old case, seems to
have aged at all. Presumably
this is the joke.) The comedy is
indicated by one scene in which
Lee tries to slice a bagel while
holding it in his crotch, and an
other in which he catches his
belt on a stray wire on his way
into the office and brings the
door down as he tumbles
through it. The gags are embar
rassing, though if someone like
Blake Edwards had taken over
they might at least have been
well staged. Donner is just
hopeless at choreographing
slapstick.

The pacing is off, the camera
placement is incomprehensible
— there isn't a moment that
seems right. The cast screeches
and dashes around like in
ebriated party guests — it's bad
enough to see Lee Grant doing
her Jewish mama number, and
the late Rachel Roberts playing
a neurotic housekeeper who be
haves in a loony fashion not ex
plained in the script, but when
Brian Keith, who usually re
tains his dignity even in the
most hazardous situation,
makes a screaming entrance in
the role of an ulcerous cop, you
want to find the nearest exit. I
did, after almost an hour, sneak
ing past a pair of bubble gum
chewing 12-year-olds whose
eyes were already glazed.
