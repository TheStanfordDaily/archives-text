# 'Dogs of War' is also deeply doggy

Frederick Forsyth's thriller Dogs of
War contains the basic elements of '30s
action adventure picture with some
modern cynicism thrown in — a huge
multinational hires a band of
mercenaries to stage a coup d'etat in a
small African country in order to get at
the country's enormous platinum re
serves. The book doesn't read like a mov
ie script, as Forsyth's Day of the Jackal
did; it's more like a how-to primer for
budding mercenaries. Yet there might
be a movie in the material, if the director
were willing to accept some of the
trashy, vulgarized conventions of the
Robert Ludlum/Ken Follett style of
thriller writing, of which Forsyth is
among the best practicioners.
In the new movie version of Forsyth's
book, director John Irvin can't bring
himself to give the picture the pulpy
thriller feel it needs; instead, the film
plays as if it were an updated version of
Lives of a Bengal Lancer with a script by
Samuel Beckett. Keeping Forsyth's
basic narrative, Irvin reduces the movie
to a study of its hero and his feelings
about his terrible deeds. Irvin directed a
fine version of John Le Carre's Tinker,
Tailor, Soldier, Spy for British tele

vision ; here, he tries to give the Forsyth
material Le Carre's atmosphere of mor
al dread, and the result is an un
fathomable mess.
The mistake is compounded by having
Chistopher Walken in the lead role as the
head mercenary, Shannon. The only time
Walken's body doesn't seem to be mis
shapen is when he's in action scenes; bat
tle galvanizes the characters he plays.
When he's at rest, Walken is a limited if
sometimes effective actor — his inex
pressiveness allows him to play distant,
mysterious men, but when he tries for
more than that, his face betrays him.
Walken's not in action for most of the
movie; he's required to project torment
and uncertainty, but he's lost. His per
formance is excruciating.
If the script (Gary DeVore and George
Malko get the blame) allowed Walken to
move, perhaps he wouldn't seem like
such a deadbeat; he shuffles through the
movie like Beckett's Watt, waiting for
doorbells to ring. In the book Shannon
fights for the money and the enjoyment
of it, and since he has an incurable dis
ease, he turns the tables on his bosses
and puts a moderate in power instead of
the puppet the conglomerate wanted.
Such a device is typical in the genre; the

reader is supposed to end up on the hero's
side even though the latter's actions are
often ugly and abhorrent. Irvin tries for a
"higher'' motivation, and it's a downer.
In the only section of the movie Irvin
seems to care about, Shannon makes a
reconnaissance visit to the targeted
African country. Emphasizing the local
squalor and the regime's barbarism, the
sequence culminates in Shannon's brutal
but short-lived imprisonment. Some of
the images of backwardness and over
population are striking, but Walken only
gives us blank stares — the overall effect
is deadening.
Then (just to make sure you've got the
point) upon returning home, Shannon is
dumped by his lover. Thus Shannon's
complicity in the coup d'etat comes off
as an act of bitter retribution; he's less a
veteran mercenary than an overzealous
missionary seeking to teach the "hea
thens" a lesson. The movie never re
covers from the resulting confusion: the
rest is a pedestrian mishmash. The camp
vitality is squeezed out; at the end,
Walken doesn't even get the chance to
give the book's "I double-crossed you be
cause I wanted to screw imperialism"
speech.
In Day of the Jackal, director Fred

Zinnemann didn't have the troubles Irvin
does; granted, Jackal is a better book,
but Zinnemann kept the narrative
without sacrificing its audience-pleasing
elements. Irvin, who seems to aspire to
Zinnemann's elegant craftsmanship,
first confuses the material and then
cheats us with his climax, directing the
final battle scene like a disinterested
amateur.
Zinnemann, who is dedicated and fair
to the material, is too good for Forsyth's
thrillers — but he'll do a competent job
regardless. Irvin's too good for the mate
rial too, but in all the wrong ways; he
won't dirty his movie. He kills the au
dience's enjoyment with his search for
profundity.
Sopnehow, the very great Jack Cardiff
was persuaded to do the movie's
cinematography. Cardiff isn't helped by
having the dead-weight Walken at the
center of most of his shots, and his clean,
professional camerawork is consistently
sabotaged by the movie's murkiness.
Irvin wants you to feel Shannon's sense
of weary sadness at the end, but I left not
believing my eyes — how could a movie
shot by Jack Cardiff not have a single
pleasurable scene in it?
