# Walt Disney goes to hell and back
## 
### Vince Waldman 
Looks like the world's prob
lems have finally got to Disney
Studios. No more zip-a-dee-do
dah, no more Snow White. In
stead, in recent years, they've
given us a dragon (Pete's) and
The Black Hole. (No wonder
kids have turned paranoid.) And
now they've sunk all the way to
Hell — for The Devil and Max
Devlin. Not only that, but the
Disney view of the world seems
to have changed as well. City
streets are crowded and danger

ous; poor old men pick through
garbage cans; the entertain
ment industry isn't Uncle Walt
and his Mousketeers anymore,
but scheming, ambitious pro
ducers and bikinied groupies in
hot tubs. And the hero of this
film is a heel. Max Devlin (El
liot Gould) is a crooked apart
ment owner who seems to have
no redeeming qualities — he
even evicts an ex-girlfriend for
having a parakeet. Then he's
run over by a bus. His soul
plunges to the center of Hell,

which is run by a bunch of busi
ness-suited bureaucrats, includ
ing Barney Satin (Bill Cosby),
"Manager of Condemned
Souls." To regain his own life,
Max agrees to persuade three
other people to sell their souls: a
bad rock singer trying to be a
star (Julie Budd), a teenage
nerd who wants to be a motor
cycle racer (David Knell), and a
boy who wants a father (Adam
Rich).
It's not Faust, or even Damn
Yankees, but the first part of the
movie is a lot of fun. Gould is
good in the role of a worthless
schnook, and Cosby's slow,
calm delivery provides an
amusing contrast with the fire
and-brimstone surroundings.
The two work well together; the
jokes are good and are directed
at both adults and children. The
early scenes flow rapidly, with a
sense of common purpose.
Unfortunately, Max Devlin
must come back to life, and the
plot slows dramatically. The
jokes come less frequently and
are more predictable; cliche
and schmaltz, Disney
trademarks which were
thankfully absent at the start,
reappear with a vengeance.
Gould, who was terrific when he
was rotten, suddenly become a
much nicer guy — and less en
joyable. Worse are the support
ing actors. Adam Rich's per
formance as the boy who wants
Gould to be his father is indist
inguishable from the role he
plays as the youngest son on
Eight is Enough. Susan
Anspach plays his mother — a
single parent who falls in love
with Gould. She is unbearably
sweet and generous. But the
absolute nadir of the film is

Julie Budd, who has been a ris
ing star longer than most
singers have careers. She sings
well enough, but even after all
those appearances on The
Merve Griffin Show she still
can't act. She looks and talks
like Barbra Streisand, and
even bats her eyelashes the way
Streisand did in What's Up,
Doc?, but unlike Streisand she
has no comic sense at all. When
ever Budd's on screen the movie
drags painfully. She has no help
from the script — her part of the
plot is the least believable, par
ticularly because Marvin
Hamlisch's songs have about as
much to do with rock as The
Jazz Singer. (Does the popular
success of the latter suggest
that Satan has already taken
control of AM radio?)
Still, the movie has some good
moments and funny jokes. Cos
by underplays his role beau
tifully — until the very end,
when he delivers a short but
spectacular tirade dressed in
full Satanic regalia. (Even his
skin turns red in this scene.)
This and the other special ef
fects are very well done. The en
ding is corny, but in a way we
are grateful. We need a happy
ending as reassurance that Dis
ny movies are still optimistic.
Because its early promise is un
fulfilled, The Devil and Max
Devlin can only be rated as
mildly entertaining, but that
still makes it the best Disney
picture in a very long time. This
gives one hope for a real happy
ending — which will come when
Disney can sustain an entire
film with as much good humor
and verve as the best parts of
The Devil and Max Devlin.
Then movie-lovers can all live
happily ever after.

ney's "The Devil and Max Devlin."
