# Student one-acts run tomorrow

### Patricia Rose 
Next week, Wednesday
through Saturday, the Original
Winter One Acts return to cam
pus after an absence of over ten
years due to the temporary de
mise of the entire Ram's Head
organization in the '60s. The One
Acts were (and are again) the
only opportunity for under
graduates to express original
ideas in theatre without having
to scrounge money and per
formance facilities.
The OWOA program begins
with the producer and a budget
from Ram's Head. This year's
project began with John Gold
win (graduate as of December
'80), Todd Harris and $2500.
Goldwin transferred the idea
and possibility with him from
from Bowdoin College, intrigu
ing Todd Harris (producer of
Hair and Just a Kiss Away, di
rector of Jesus Christ Super
star, and castmember in-4 Mid
summer Night's Dream and
West Side Stnrv). Harris took
over the project, soliciting stu
dent compositions, assembling
a staff, arranging credit with
the drama department, getting
$500 from the SCIRE Innovation
Fund for lasting projects, and
finally choosing the scripts and

directors.
When asked about the criteria
involved in making these
choices, Harris stressed the im
portance of a cohesive evening
of theatre. This year's offerings
are "When You Get to Butte
Don't"Send Me Any Postcards"
by Terence Ross and Russell
Leavitt, "Role Call" by Jay
Martel, and "Phelan" by Tom
Casciato. All of the authors are
seniors; two are creative writ
ing majors, one is a drama ma
jor, and one is undeclared. All
three of the plays, according to
Harris, are especially relevant
to the lives of people in their
early twenties. "You will be
able to recognize the charac
ters," he said.
"Butte," which stars Robin
Cooper and Paul King, is the
story of a young man in a public
library who finds himself con
fronted by a mysterious woman
who knows of his past. "Role
Call," which features Randy
Smith and Judy Moreland, deals
with the breakdown of a rela
tionship in which a man and a
woman speak monologues to the
audience, and can only com
municate with each other in the
roles of famous fictional
couples. "Phelan," which stars
Anthony Grumbach, Tony Kel

ly, Lianne Klapper, Barbara >
Smith, and Linda Greer, is a "*
comedy about a recently-fired
cab driver who learns about life
from a social misfit with a gift vj
for non sequiturs and a penchant
for baked potatoes.

The plays' directors
Steven Fuller, (senior, and as- (
sistant director of Little Eyolf), >
Marc Fajer, (junior, director
Midsu mm er Nigh t's Drea m),
and freshman John McDonough,
(castmember of "Mid
summer"). All three directors
filled out application question
naries and then had interviews
with the producer. Together,
then, they set about casting the
shows and, by the beginning of
winter quarter, the Original
Winter One Acts were ready to
begin rehearsals.
The One Acts will run five
performances in the Little
Theatre (in back of
Memorial Auditorium) at 8
p.m. Wednesday, Thursday, and
Saturday, and at 7 and 10 p.m. on
Friday. If you know any of these
people, surprise them by show
ing up to see their work. If you
don't know any of them, sur--
prise yourself by seeing that,
even as an undergraduate your
ideas count.
