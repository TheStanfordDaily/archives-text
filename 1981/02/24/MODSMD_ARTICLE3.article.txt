# Feasibility study questioned
## ASSU Senate meets on entertainment 
### Richard Klingler 
The ASSU Senate Finance Commit
tee voted overwhelmingly last night to
recommend to the full senate that
. . further pursuit of the Bluegrass
Festival, which requires student in
volvement and a project structure, is
no longer possible."

The latest decision on the Bluegrass
Festival, a 4-0 vote with two absten
tions, followed a 5-1 vote to stop in
vestigating the feasibility of produc
ing concerts through the ASSU. A mo
tion to endorse the most recent
feasibility study of an ASSU-backed
concert production group failed by a
vote of 0-4, with two abstentions.
The recommendations to stop sup
port for the Bluegrass Festival and
ASSU involvement in concerts in gen
eral were founded on the committee's
vote to reject the feasibility study.
The senate will make a final decision
whether to accept the study at tomor
row night's meeting.
Student Financial Manager Steve
Davis, entrusted to examine the possi
bilities for the May concert, concluded
that the festival could not be produced
without an acceptable plan for princi
pal aspects of student organization.
Gary Reiff, chair of the finance
committee and a fervent opponent of

the concert plans, explained part of
his opposition to the ASSU's involve
ment in concerts: "No matter what
feasibility study they give us, it's not
going to work."
Dick Butterfield. an ex-officio
member of the finance committee and
Council of Presidents (COP) member,
said that he regretted that so much
energy had been wasted on the concert
issue that could have been directed
toward other ASSU projects.
Acceptance of the task force's
feasibility study would provide the
structure for the necessary student in
volvement in the Bluegrass Festival,
but the study was not recommended
because of senators' reservations
about possible monetary loss, the pro
posed quarterly fee assessment, au
thority of the project manager, scarci
ty of necessary expertise, problems of
co-production, the lack of a tentative
office budget, and the paucity of ex-
penditure estimates.
Dayna Goldfine, COP member and chair of the task
force of 25 people working during the past month, defended
the study before aggressive questioning during the 3-hour
examination of the task force study.
Goldfine defended the feasibility of the task force's or
ganizational suggestions by comparing the proposed board
of supervisors to the board that manages the Coffee House
and the controversial division of authority between a
project manager and an accountant to the internal struc
ture of The Stanford Daily.
She said that the project posed only a very slight risk to
the ASSU funds because the concert-promoting organiza
tion would initially be funded by a proposed fee
assessment.
Goldfine outlined four goals the task force's recommen
dations were designed to achieve: providing entertain
ment for the campus, producing student job opportunities,
creating a financially stable organization, and enhancing
the ASSU.
Throughout the tense questioning, Goldfine and other
task force members, predominantly not members of the
ASSU, countered the Senators' objections and suggested
that the finance committee members' requests for detail
could only be provided once the proposed concert or
ganization was in operation.
