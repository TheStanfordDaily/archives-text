Arts and Entertainment is looking for a few
good writers willing to act as Stanford's Bay
Area cultural ambassadors. In particular, we
need reviewers of the fine arts (i.e., drawing,
painting, sculpture and performance art). and
of classical music and jazz. Writers are either
paid or given complimentary tickets, and in
variably get to mix with the Bay Area's most
shi-shi artists at wine and cheese parties. Pre

vious experience is not necessary, but good
writing ability and a knowledge of the subject
at hand are. Although some sort of transporta
tional means to San Francisco is an advan
tage, it is not essential as there are also a
great many events to be covered locally. If in
terested, call the Daily (497-4632), or leave a
message in the Arts and Entertainment
mailbox.
