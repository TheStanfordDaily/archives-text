Reagan claims Soviets in El Salvador
Washington— The Reagan administration took the un
usual step today of releasing captured documents and oth
er materials to support its claim that Soviet-bloc nations
have sent tons of weapons to leftist guerrillas in El
Salvador.
The 178 pages of evidence depict what appears to be a
major effort last year by communist countries on four con
tinents to convert El Salvador into the first unambiguously
communist state on the American continent.
The release of the document, entitled "Communist In
terference in El Salvador," is an attempt by the adminis
tration to lay the groundwork for unspecified retaliatory
action by the United States to counter the Soviet bloc ef
fort.
The documents outline the huge quantities of assistance
pledged by Vietnam, Ethiopia, and other communist coun
tries for shipment to El Salvador through Cuba and
Nicaragua.
On Nov. 1,1980, a Salvadoran logistics representative in
Nicaragua, identified only as "Vladimir." describes the
magnitude of the operation in a letter to his comrades in El
Salvador.
"Here, as regards the shipments, they have been pack
ing the bundles day and night," the letter said. "It's a
backlog because more shipments will be arriving this
week in Esmeralda reaching between 300 and 400 tons.
At another point, Vladimir said it was impressive "how
all countries in the socialist bloc fully committed them
selves to meet our every request and some have even
doubled their promised aid."
Ford wary about tax cut, El Salvador
Rancho Mirage, Ca. — Former President Ford says
President Ronald Reagan is "naive" if he thinks budget
cuts will be easier than tax cuts to sell to Congress.
Because of that. Reagan should hold off on the last two
years of his three-year, 30 percent tax cut program until
there is "visible evidence" Congress will reduce the
growth of federal spending, Ford says.
In an interview at his home, Ford said efforts to reduce
federal spending always tend to generate formidable
coalitions which ban together to protect their own ap
propriations.
Ford also voiced support for the Reagan adminis
tration's refusal not to rule out any options in strife-torn
Central America, including the use of American ground
combat forces.
"The minute you rule out any option, including a mili
tary option, it makes the Soviet Union and the Cubans
more likely to increase their military forces in those areas
of this hemisphere," Ford said. "The United States has a
vital interest in all of Latin America, the Caribbean, the
South American area as a whole."
He added. "What worries me is that Nicaragua,
Guatemala. El Salvador are relatively small but they are
a part of Latin America. And if the Soviet Union and Cuba
get a toehold in that area in Latin America, it does or will
undoubtedly have an impact on some of the larger nations
down in South America — Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Mexi
co."
U.S. to sell Mexico 'unneeded' arms
Mexico City— The United States has approved a Mexi
can request to purchase at least a dozen American super
sonic jet fighters as part of new effort to modernize the
Mexican armed forces, qualified Mexican sources re

ported yesterday.
Besides the new aircraft. Mexico has announced plans
to use its growing oil earnings to buy armored vehicles,
amphibious craft, and heavy antitank guns The purchases
go well beyond military needs for keeping internal order,
the main role of the Mexican army up to now.
Defense analysts in Washington have privately said that
supersonic fighter planes are an extravagance for this
country. With the U.S. military might to the north and tiny
Guatemala to the south, "Mexico can make no strategic
argument that it needs such planes," one U.S. analyst
said.
"Even if they buy twice as many planes, Mexico cannot
defend the oil fields against sophisticated attack," he said.
"All they can do with them is fly them too fast over their
own country or show them off with visits in Central Ameri
ca."
Michigan autoworkers in tax fraud
Flint, Mi.— About 3500 autoworkers staging one of the
nation's biggest income-tax revolts could face criminal
prosecution if they persist in such dodges as claiming up to
99 dependents, the Internal Revenue Service warned yes
terday.
The revolt began last year when word swept down an as
sembly line at a General Motors Corp. plant in Flint about
a tax-fighting organization called We the People ACT.
which urges changing deduction information on the W-4
forms which employers use to compute witholdings from
employees' paychecks.
Since the information on the W-4 forms is false, the
workers could face civil penalties and criminal prose
cution for filing false documents, Walter Dunnigan, an IRS
public information spokesman, said yesterday in Detroit.
The IRS is giving the employees two weeks to correct
the forms.
The IRS got wind of the protest last fall when GM re
ported that a number of workers were making drastic
changes on W-4 forms. There were so many changes, Dun
nagan said, that GM is now making weekly reports to the
IRS.
"This is the biggest, or at least one of the biggest, tax
protest movements in the country." said Dunnigan.
EPA presses for Calif, car inspection
Washington— The Supreme Court today allowed the En
vironmental Protection Agency to withhold federal money
and construction permits from California in a bid to make
the state adopt an auto inspection program, and refused to
consider an attempt to stop the EPA actions.
California had failed to win EPA approval of an air pol
lution program for areas of the state which did not meet
clean air standards by July 1,1979, the deadline set by Con
gress.
Without approved auto inspection plans, the state was
required by the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments to impose
a moratorium on major construction in the non-attain
ment areas. When the state did not do so, the EPA moved
in and said it would enforce the moratorium by withhold
ing necessary federal construction permits and $850 mil
lion in federal transportation and sewage-treatment
grants.
The federal government has stated that it is only apply
ing to California the incentives provided by Congress for
encouraging state cooperation in carrying out the Clean
Air Act.

Non-white population up sharply
Washington— In one of the sharpest population shifts in
U.S. history, non-white groups significantly increased
their proportion of the American population during the
19705, the government reported yesterday.
The Census Bureau said that the nation's white majority
decreased from 87.5 percent to 83.2 percent between the
1970 and 1980 census counts, while the minority racial pop
ulation grew from 12.5 percent to 16.8 percent.
All major racial minorities showed a much sharper rate
of growth than did whites, whose number increased by 6
percent from 177.7 million to 188.3 million. The total popu
lation grew from 203.2 million to 226.5 million.
"It's one of the most significant changes in the racial
composition of the U.S. population in any 10-year period,"
Nampeo McKenney, chief of the bureau's ethnic and racial
division, told a reporter.
Blue chips, mergers rally stocks
New York— The stock market turned upward yesterday
in a rally spearheaded by blue-chip issues and stocks of
several companies involved in takeover developments.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than
11 points at its mid-afternoon peak, finished with a 9.14
gain at 945.23, while volume continued to set a relatively
sluggish pace, totaling 39.59 million shares.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today and tonight with a chance of show
ers. Clearing tomorrow, and a little cooler. Daytime highs
in the upper 50s, with lows in the 30s tonight. West to

northwest winds 10 to 20 mph increasing throughout the
day.

On Nov. 1,1980, a Salvadoran logistics representative in
Nicaragua, identified only as "Vladimir." describes the
magnitude of the operation in a letter to his comrades in El
Salvador.
"Here, as regards the shipments, they have been pack
ing the bundles day and night," the letter said. "It's a
backlog because more shipments will be arriving this

At another point, Vladimir said it was impressive "how
all countries in the socialist bloc fully committed them

doubled their promised aid."
Ford wary about tax cut, El Salvador
Rancho Mirage, Ca. — Former President Ford says
President Ronald Reagan is "naive" if he thinks budget
cuts will be easier than tax cuts to sell to Congress.
Because of that. Reagan should hold off on the last two
years of his three-year, 30 percent tax cut program until
there is "visible evidence" Congress will reduce the
growth of federal spending, Ford says.
In an interview at his home, Ford said efforts to reduce
federal spending always tend to generate formidable
coalitions which ban together to protect their own ap
propriations.
Ford also voiced support for the Reagan adminis
tration's refusal not to rule out any options in strife-torn
Central America, including the use of American ground
combat forces.
"The minute you rule out any option, including a mili
tary option, it makes the Soviet Union and the Cubans
more likely to increase their military forces in those areas
of this hemisphere," Ford said. "The United States has a
vital interest in all of Latin America, the Caribbean, the
South American area as a whole."
He added. "What worries me is that Nicaragua,
Guatemala. El Salvador are relatively small but they are
a part of Latin America. And if the Soviet Union and Cuba
get a toehold in that area in Latin America, it does or will
undoubtedly have an impact on some of the larger nations
down in South America — Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Mexi
co."
U.S. to sell Mexico 'unneeded' arms
Mexico City— The United States has approved a Mexi
can request to purchase at least a dozen American super
sonic jet fighters as part of new effort to modernize the
Mexican armed forces, qualified Mexican sources re

ported yesterday.
Besides the new aircraft. Mexico has announced plans
to use its growing oil earnings to buy armored vehicles,
amphibious craft, and heavy antitank guns The purchases
go well beyond military needs for keeping internal order,
the main role of the Mexican army up to now.
Defense analysts in Washington have privately said that
supersonic fighter planes are an extravagance for this
country. With the U.S. military might to the north and tiny
Guatemala to the south, "Mexico can make no strategic
argument that it needs such planes," one U.S. analyst
said.
"Even if they buy twice as many planes, Mexico cannot
defend the oil fields against sophisticated attack," he said.
"All they can do with them is fly them too fast over their
own country or show them off with visits in Central Ameri
ca."
Michigan autoworkers in tax fraud
Flint, Mi.— About 3500 autoworkers staging one of the
nation's biggest income-tax revolts could face criminal
prosecution if they persist in such dodges as claiming up to
99 dependents, the Internal Revenue Service warned yes
terday.
The revolt began last year when word swept down an as
sembly line at a General Motors Corp. plant in Flint about
a tax-fighting organization called We the People ACT.
which urges changing deduction information on the W-4
forms which employers use to compute witholdings from
employees' paychecks.
Since the information on the W-4 forms is false, the
workers could face civil penalties and criminal prose
cution for filing false documents, Walter Dunnigan, an IRS
public information spokesman, said yesterday in Detroit.
The IRS is giving the employees two weeks to correct
the forms.
The IRS got wind of the protest last fall when GM re
ported that a number of workers were making drastic
changes on W-4 forms. There were so many changes, Dun
nagan said, that GM is now making weekly reports to the
IRS.
"This is the biggest, or at least one of the biggest, tax
protest movements in the country." said Dunnigan.
EPA presses for Calif, car inspection
Washington— The Supreme Court today allowed the En
vironmental Protection Agency to withhold federal money
and construction permits from California in a bid to make
the state adopt an auto inspection program, and refused to
consider an attempt to stop the EPA actions.
California had failed to win EPA approval of an air pol
lution program for areas of the state which did not meet
clean air standards by July 1,1979, the deadline set by Con
gress.
Without approved auto inspection plans, the state was
required by the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments to impose
a moratorium on major construction in the non-attain
ment areas. When the state did not do so, the EPA moved
in and said it would enforce the moratorium by withhold
ing necessary federal construction permits and $850 mil
lion in federal transportation and sewage-treatment
grants.
The federal government has stated that it is only apply
ing to California the incentives provided by Congress for
encouraging state cooperation in carrying out the Clean
Air Act.

Non-white population up sharply
Washington— In one of the sharpest population shifts in
U.S. history, non-white groups significantly increased
their proportion of the American population during the
19705, the government reported yesterday.
The Census Bureau said that the nation's white majority
decreased from 87.5 percent to 83.2 percent between the
1970 and 1980 census counts, while the minority racial pop
ulation grew from 12.5 percent to 16.8 percent.
All major racial minorities showed a much sharper rate
of growth than did whites, whose number increased by 6
percent from 177.7 million to 188.3 million. The total popu
lation grew from 203.2 million to 226.5 million.
"It's one of the most significant changes in the racial
composition of the U.S. population in any 10-year period,"
Nampeo McKenney, chief of the bureau's ethnic and racial
division, told a reporter.

Reagan claims Soviets in El Salvador
Washington— The Reagan administration took the un
usual step today of releasing captured documents and oth
er materials to support its claim that Soviet-bloc nations
have sent tons of weapons to leftist guerrillas in El
Salvador.
The 178 pages of evidence depict what appears to be a
major effort last year by communist countries on four con
tinents to convert El Salvador into the first unambiguously
communist state on the American continent.
The release of the document, entitled "Communist In
terference in El Salvador," is an attempt by the adminis
tration to lay the groundwork for unspecified retaliatory
action by the United States to counter the Soviet bloc ef
fort.
The documents outline the huge quantities of assistance
pledged by Vietnam, Ethiopia, and other communist coun
tries for shipment to El Salvador through Cuba and
Nicaragua.

there is "visible evidence" Congress will reduce the
growth of federal spending, Ford says.
In an interview at his home, Ford said efforts to reduce
federal spending always tend to generate formidable
coalitions which ban together to protect their own ap
propriations.
Ford also voiced support for the Reagan adminis
tration's refusal not to rule out any options in strife-torn
Central America, including the use of American ground
combat forces.
"The minute you rule out any option, including a mili
tary option, it makes the Soviet Union and the Cubans
more likely to increase their military forces in those areas
of this hemisphere," Ford said. "The United States has a
vital interest in all of Latin America, the Caribbean, the
South American area as a whole."
He added. "What worries me is that Nicaragua,
Guatemala. El Salvador are relatively small but they are
a part of Latin America. And if the Soviet Union and Cuba
get a toehold in that area in Latin America, it does or will
undoubtedly have an impact on some of the larger nations
down in South America — Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Mexi
co."
U.S. to sell Mexico 'unneeded' arms
Mexico City— The United States has approved a Mexi
can request to purchase at least a dozen American super
sonic jet fighters as part of new effort to modernize the
Mexican armed forces, qualified Mexican sources re

ported yesterday.
Besides the new aircraft. Mexico has announced plans
to use its growing oil earnings to buy armored vehicles,
amphibious craft, and heavy antitank guns The purchases
go well beyond military needs for keeping internal order,
the main role of the Mexican army up to now.
Defense analysts in Washington have privately said that
supersonic fighter planes are an extravagance for this
country. With the U.S. military might to the north and tiny
Guatemala to the south, "Mexico can make no strategic
argument that it needs such planes," one U.S. analyst
said.
"Even if they buy twice as many planes, Mexico cannot
defend the oil fields against sophisticated attack," he said.
"All they can do with them is fly them too fast over their
own country or show them off with visits in Central Ameri
ca."
Michigan autoworkers in tax fraud
Flint, Mi.— About 3500 autoworkers staging one of the
nation's biggest income-tax revolts could face criminal
prosecution if they persist in such dodges as claiming up to
99 dependents, the Internal Revenue Service warned yes
terday.
The revolt began last year when word swept down an as
sembly line at a General Motors Corp. plant in Flint about
a tax-fighting organization called We the People ACT.
which urges changing deduction information on the W-4
forms which employers use to compute witholdings from
employees' paychecks.
Since the information on the W-4 forms is false, the
workers could face civil penalties and criminal prose
cution for filing false documents, Walter Dunnigan, an IRS
public information spokesman, said yesterday in Detroit.
The IRS is giving the employees two weeks to correct
the forms.
The IRS got wind of the protest last fall when GM re
ported that a number of workers were making drastic
changes on W-4 forms. There were so many changes, Dun
nagan said, that GM is now making weekly reports to the
IRS.
"This is the biggest, or at least one of the biggest, tax
protest movements in the country." said Dunnigan.
EPA presses for Calif, car inspection
Washington— The Supreme Court today allowed the En
vironmental Protection Agency to withhold federal money
and construction permits from California in a bid to make
the state adopt an auto inspection program, and refused to
consider an attempt to stop the EPA actions.
California had failed to win EPA approval of an air pol
lution program for areas of the state which did not meet
clean air standards by July 1,1979, the deadline set by Con
gress.
Without approved auto inspection plans, the state was
required by the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments to impose
a moratorium on major construction in the non-attain
ment areas. When the state did not do so, the EPA moved
in and said it would enforce the moratorium by withhold
ing necessary federal construction permits and $850 mil
lion in federal transportation and sewage-treatment
grants.
The federal government has stated that it is only apply
ing to California the incentives provided by Congress for
encouraging state cooperation in carrying out the Clean
Air Act.

Non-white population up sharply
Washington— In one of the sharpest population shifts in
U.S. history, non-white groups significantly increased
their proportion of the American population during the
19705, the government reported yesterday.
The Census Bureau said that the nation's white majority
decreased from 87.5 percent to 83.2 percent between the
1970 and 1980 census counts, while the minority racial pop
ulation grew from 12.5 percent to 16.8 percent.
All major racial minorities showed a much sharper rate
of growth than did whites, whose number increased by 6
percent from 177.7 million to 188.3 million. The total popu
lation grew from 203.2 million to 226.5 million.
"It's one of the most significant changes in the racial
composition of the U.S. population in any 10-year period,"
Nampeo McKenney, chief of the bureau's ethnic and racial
division, told a reporter.
