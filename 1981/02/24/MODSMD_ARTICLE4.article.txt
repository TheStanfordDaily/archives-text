# Spain's legislature held captive
## 
### Washington Post 
Madrid — A detachment of Spain's
paramilitary Civil Guards stormed
into the Spanish parliament and took
the Cabinet and assembly hostage yes
terday in an attempted coup d'etat
against the nation's still fragile post-
Franco democracy.
Amid uncertainty over the inten
tions of the country's 320.000-member
armed forces, King Juan Carlos went
on national television early this morn
ing wearing the uniform of a captain
general in the Spanish armed forces
and declared that the military is back
ing him against the rebel paramilitary
Civil Guards who were holding more
than 300 legislators at gunpoint.
The attempted coup marked Spain's
most serious crisis since the death in
1975 of Generalissimo Francisco
Franco. It was touched off by a dis
graced Civil Guard colonel who broke
into the parliament chamber early
yesterday evening, firing shots from

his pistol, at the start of a vote to con
firm a new prime minister.
The colonel, Antonio Tejero Molina,
leveled his pistol at the house speaker
presiding over the vote and ordered all
the deputies to lie on the ground face
down and await further instructions.
The colonel, waving the pistol in his
right hand and gesticulating with his
left, was backed by about 200 Civil
Guardsmen brandishing submachine
guns.
At the same time, a state of emer
gency was declared by the chief mili
tary officer of the eastern Valencia re
gion in seeming coordination with the
Civil Guard rebels inside parliament,
with whom he reportedly was in tele
phone contact.
Immediately following the king's
speech, however, he ordered his
troops back to their barracks in an ap
parent decision to remain loyal to the
monarch.
Tejero told a Spanish journalist who

managed to reach him by telephone in
side the building that the negotiator
the king had sent to deal with him had
offered him a plane to leave the coun
try but that he had refused. The colo
nel said that he was demanding the
dissolution of parliament, the estab
lishment of a military junta to rule the
country and a campaign to "eradicate
terrorism."
Looking tense, the king said in a
three-minute address delivered three
hours later than originally scheduled:
"The crown cannot tolerate any action
against the constitutional order of the
Spanish people. "
He said he had ordered authorities
throughout the country to maintain or
restore order.
The standoff at the parliament
building continued into the early hours
this morning. Civil Guards holding the
deputies inside appeared increasingly
isolated. As each hour passed, more
contingents of other police moved in to
reinforce the outer ring of units oppos
ing the rebels. Those forces included a
number of other Civil Guardsmen
obeying the king's orders.
There were indications at about 4
a.m. Madrid time that the rebels
might be preparing to give in. Some
soldiers were seen moving from the
outer ring of forces into the courtyard
of the parliament building.
The main worry as the morning
wore on seemed to be how to get the
350 members of the lower house out
safely. A major complication seemed
to be that a number of top political
leaders such as outgoing moderate
premier Adolfo Suarez (who resigned
last month in a political quarrel linked
to the government's inability to con
trol terrorists), Socialist leader
Felipe Gonzalez, Communist Party
leader Santiago Carrillo and others
were being held in separate rooms so
that any move against the main parlia
mentary chamber might endanger
those leaders.
Shortly before his speech was
broadcast, the king had sent his most
trusted and loyal general, Alfonso

Armada, from the royal palace to the
parliament to negotiate. The talks
continued early this morning.
Socialist and communist labor
unions in the Madrid area appealed to
workers for calm, saying that this was
"an isolated incident that was ap
parently not supported by the armed
forces."
Tejero, the would-be coup leader,
was indicted for sedition after an
earlier coup plot in 1978 that never
moved into the operational stage. Last
spring, a court-martial sentenced him
to seven months in prison for his part
in what was known as the Galaxy plot.
He was released immediately upon
sentencing, since he had spent that
long awaiting trial.
But the commanders of the Civil
Guard and Spain's other national po
lice force both denied last night that
their organizations had any official
part in the coup attempt in par
liament. A ring of national and Madrid
city police surrounded the gray-uni
formed Civil Guard unit of about 200
who were holding the parliament
building.
The Civil Guard, a paramilitary na
tional police force with a reputation as

a bastion of rightist sentiment, faced
the other police forces with automatic
weapons at the ready. But there were
no reports of fighting.
The Army chiefs, in an apparent in
dication of loyalty to the king, issued a
communique calling the coup attempt
an "attack on the constitution" and
pledging that "all necessary methods
have been taken" to restore order.

"The crown cannot tolerate any action
against the constitutional order of the
Spanish people. "
He said he had ordered authorities
throughout the country to maintain or
restore order.
The standoff at the parliament
building continued into the early hours
this morning. Civil Guards holding the
deputies inside appeared increasingly
isolated. As each hour passed, more
contingents of other police moved in to
reinforce the outer ring of units oppos
ing the rebels. Those forces included a
number of other Civil Guardsmen
obeying the king's orders.
There were indications at about 4
a.m. Madrid time that the rebels
might be preparing to give in. Some
soldiers were seen moving from the
outer ring of forces into the courtyard
of the parliament building.
The main worry as the morning
wore on seemed to be how to get the
350 members of the lower house out
safely. A major complication seemed
to be that a number of top political
leaders such as outgoing moderate
premier Adolfo Suarez (who resigned
last month in a political quarrel linked
to the government's inability to con
trol terrorists), Socialist leader
Felipe Gonzalez, Communist Party
leader Santiago Carrillo and others
were being held in separate rooms so
that any move against the main parlia
mentary chamber might endanger
those leaders.
Shortly before his speech was
broadcast, the king had sent his most
trusted and loyal general, Alfonso

Armada, from the royal palace to the
parliament to negotiate. The talks
continued early this morning.
Socialist and communist labor
unions in the Madrid area appealed to
workers for calm, saying that this was
"an isolated incident that was ap
parently not supported by the armed
forces."
Tejero, the would-be coup leader,
was indicted for sedition after an
earlier coup plot in 1978 that never
moved into the operational stage. Last
spring, a court-martial sentenced him
to seven months in prison for his part
in what was known as the Galaxy plot.
He was released immediately upon
sentencing, since he had spent that
long awaiting trial.
But the commanders of the Civil
Guard and Spain's other national po
lice force both denied last night that
their organizations had any official
part in the coup attempt in par
liament. A ring of national and Madrid
city police surrounded the gray-uni
formed Civil Guard unit of about 200
who were holding the parliament
building.
The Civil Guard, a paramilitary na
tional police force with a reputation as

a bastion of rightist sentiment, faced
the other police forces with automatic
weapons at the ready. But there were
no reports of fighting.
The Army chiefs, in an apparent in
dication of loyalty to the king, issued a
communique calling the coup attempt
an "attack on the constitution" and
pledging that "all necessary methods
have been taken" to restore order.
Madrid — A detachment of Spain's
paramilitary Civil Guards stormed
into the Spanish parliament and took
the Cabinet and assembly hostage yes
terday in an attempted coup d'etat
against the nation's still fragile post-
Franco democracy.
Amid uncertainty over the inten
tions of the country's 320.000-member
armed forces, King Juan Carlos went
on national television early this morn
ing wearing the uniform of a captain
general in the Spanish armed forces
and declared that the military is back
ing him against the rebel paramilitary
Civil Guards who were holding more
than 300 legislators at gunpoint.
The attempted coup marked Spain's
most serious crisis since the death in
1975 of Generalissimo Francisco
Franco. It was touched off by a dis
graced Civil Guard colonel who broke
into the parliament chamber early
yesterday evening, firing shots from

his pistol, at the start of a vote to con
firm a new prime minister.
The colonel, Antonio Tejero Molina,
leveled his pistol at the house speaker
presiding over the vote and ordered all
the deputies to lie on the ground face
down and await further instructions.
The colonel, waving the pistol in his
right hand and gesticulating with his
left, was backed by about 200 Civil
Guardsmen brandishing submachine
guns.
At the same time, a state of emer
gency was declared by the chief mili
tary officer of the eastern Valencia re
gion in seeming coordination with the
Civil Guard rebels inside parliament,
with whom he reportedly was in tele
phone contact.
Immediately following the king's
speech, however, he ordered his
troops back to their barracks in an ap
parent decision to remain loyal to the
monarch.
Tejero told a Spanish journalist who

managed to reach him by telephone in
side the building that the negotiator
the king had sent to deal with him had
offered him a plane to leave the coun
try but that he had refused. The colo
nel said that he was demanding the
dissolution of parliament, the estab
lishment of a military junta to rule the
country and a campaign to "eradicate
terrorism."
Looking tense, the king said in a
three-minute address delivered three
