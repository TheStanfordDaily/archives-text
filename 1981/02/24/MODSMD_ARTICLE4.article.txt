# Spain's legislature held captive

### Washington Post 
Madrid â€” A detachment of Spain's
paramilitary Civil Guards stormed
into the Spanish parliament and took
the Cabinet and assembly hostage yes
terday in an attempted coup d'etat
against the nation's still fragile post-
Franco democracy.
Amid uncertainty over the inten
tions of the country's 320.000-member
armed forces, King Juan Carlos went
on national television early this morn
ing wearing the uniform of a captain
general in the Spanish armed forces
and declared that the military is back
ing him against the rebel paramilitary
Civil Guards who were holding more
than 300 legislators at gunpoint.
The attempted coup marked Spain's
most serious crisis since the death in
1975 of Generalissimo Francisco
Franco. It was touched off by a dis
graced Civil Guard colonel who broke
into the parliament chamber early
yesterday evening, firing shots from

his pistol, at the start of a vote to con
firm a new prime minister.
The colonel, Antonio Tejero Molina,
leveled his pistol at the house speaker
presiding over the vote and ordered all
the deputies to lie on the ground face
down and await further instructions.
The colonel, waving the pistol in his
right hand and gesticulating with his
left, was backed by about 200 Civil
Guardsmen brandishing submachine
guns.
At the same time, a state of emer
gency was declared by the chief mili
tary officer of the eastern Valencia re
gion in seeming coordination with the
Civil Guard rebels inside parliament,
with whom he reportedly was in tele
phone contact.
Immediately following the king's
speech, however, he ordered his
troops back to their barracks in an ap
parent decision to remain loyal to the
monarch.
Tejero told a Spanish journalist who

managed to reach him by telephone in
side the building that the negotiator
the king had sent to deal with him had
offered him a plane to leave the coun
try but that he had refused. The colo
nel said that he was demanding the
dissolution of parliament, the estab
lishment of a military junta to rule the
country and a campaign to "eradicate
terrorism."
Looking tense, the king said in a
three-minute address delivered three
hours later than originally scheduled:
"The crown cannot tolerate any action
against the constitutional order of the
Spanish people. "
He said he had ordered authorities
throughout the country to maintain or
restore order.
The standoff at the parliament
building continued into the early hours
this morning. Civil Guards holding the
deputies inside appeared increasingly
isolated. As each hour passed, more
