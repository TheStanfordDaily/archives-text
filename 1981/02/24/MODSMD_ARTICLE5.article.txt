The spirit (in music) is very, very strong.
When you evoke this spirit. . . it does something
to the body. It's like releasing adrenalin. This is
what the music does; it's like a stimulant. . . .
— Leroy Mattis
In the hands of the uninitiated, a drum is sim
ply ... a drum. But in the hands of a musician
like Leroy Mattis, a drum becomes an un
inhibited, dynamic expression of vitality.
Mattis, the National Jamaican Drumming
Champion since 1974 and vocalist/congo drum
mer for the reggae group "Mabrak." held the
first of two lecture-participation classes in
African and Afro-Caribbean Drumming Feb. 11
here, as part of Black Liberation Month.
From Kingston. Jamaica, Mattis has con
ducted drum master classes at such institutions
as the Jamaica School of Music and the Oakland
Auditorium. Mattis also co-hosted the "Roots,
Rock and Reggae" format on KZSU in 1979-80.
Accompanying various reggae groups such as
Umoja and Ras Karbi, his own album Drum

Talk, released in 1975, has been called a "land
mark in the Jamaican Musical Experience."
In African music, the use of rhythm is fore
most in emphasis and complexity, in comparison
to the harmony and melody. In Western music,
this sensibility is almost reversed That is the
reason why, Mattis said, "the drum has not re
ceived the respectability it deserves as a per
cussive instrument; it is used more as a filler' in
contemporary music."
Shaped like an hour glass with skins over both
ends and laced together with leather strings,
Mattis s drum is a complex instrument, produc
ing tones ranging more than an octave. The
"squeezing technique" used to manipulate the
resonant tonal quality of the drum, together with
the complicated rhythms employed, is probably
best appreciated as a spontaneous and emotional
creation.
Here, the drum is made to be the principal
voice, followed by other instruments such as the

harp, bells, xylophone and flute. "And when the
hands can pluck the (drum) strings like a harp."
Mattis added, "That's really music!"
Starting with the historical development of
drum patterns — from the "homophonic" or one
basic melodic line to the more common
"polyphonic" arrangement of two or more inde
pendent melodic lines — Mattis sought to show
music as one basis for a portrait of evolving
African culture. From the "talking drums,"
which were used to "send messages from hilltop
to hilltop," came many traditional African drum
pieces, surprisingly beautiful in their subjective
complexity.
One such piece demonstrated by Mattis was
the "Agbaja," originally played at social dances
on Ghana When played at a slower tempo, how
ever. "Agbafa" also worked to show the evolving
nature of the art, as it became recognizable as
jazz-pianist Dave Brubeck's piece "Take Five. "
And. if you can imagine Roberta Flack singing
"Killing Me Softly" with a reggae beat, you know
that anything is possible.
