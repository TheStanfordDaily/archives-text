## Soviet congress features relations with West, Afghanistan, Poland 
### 
Moscow!AP) — The Soviet Communist
Party, already proclaiming "major" for
eign policy successes over the past five
years, is expected to focus its 26th Com
munist Party Congress, which opened here
yesterday, on relations with the West.
The two-week-long congress is being
viewed by many analysts as a barometer of
long-term Soviet strategy plans. President
Leonid Brezhnev's speech to the opening
session is considered his most important
policy address since the last Soviet congress
in 1976.
The plans could include laying the
groundwork for an improved dialogue with
the United States despite current problems,
leading to an eventual meeting between
Brezhnev and President Ronald Reagan or
other Western leaders, which Brezhnev
called for yesterday. Some observers antic
ipated a slightly more flexible approach by
Brezhnev to resolving the controversy over
Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan,
but no change in basic policy toward the cen
tral Asian nation was expected.
Some 4000 Soviet party members and
nearly 100 foreign Communist delegations
are attending the 26th session in the mod
ernistic Kremlin Palace of Congresses.
Moscow has been awash with banners and
decorations for a week in preparation for
the congress, and legions of extra police
have been patrolling the streets.
Most of the policy matters to be approved
at the session have already been cleared by-
Brezhnev, 74. and other leaders. The con
gress is designed mainly for announcing and
endorsing policy, rather than making it.and

delegates are expected to vote unanimously
in favor of whatever the leaders propose.
Western analysts will be looking for these
elements in the congress:
— East-West issues: How Brezhnev and
other leaders will explain the decline of de
tente, with which the Brezhnev leadership is
closely identified At the 1976 congress,
when detente was blooming. Brezhnev cited
with satisfaction "an improvement of the
international climate " This year, he will
have to defend Moscow's approach to de
tente in the light of new East-West tension;
— The Reagan administration: In recent
weeks, the Soviet press has sharply de
nounced Reagan for his hard-line policies on
the Soviet Union But many Soviet sources
expect Brezhnev to take a conciliatory ap
proach to Reagan, with the Soviet leader
presenting himself as a man of peace exten
ding the Kremlin's hand in friendship.
— Poland and Afghanistan: The congress
is expected to stoutly defend Soviet military
involvement in Afghanistan, but to take a
relatively mild line toward Poland, where
strikes were settled in recent days; and
— Brezhnev's health: Foreign and Soviet
observers alike will be looking for clues to
Brezhnev's health during his address. The
Soviet leader is believed to suffer regular
bouts of illness, but has usually risen to the
occasion when an important speech is
planned. His speech this time, however, is
expected to be shorter than his marathon
five-hour. 10-minute performance in 1976.
In a front-page editorial on the congress,
the Soviet Communist Party daily /Vnrdn
said Sunday there had been "major suc
cesses" in Soviet foreign policy since the

1976 congress. It mentioned no failures. It
also said the country had moved forward ec
onomically. technically, spiritually and in
its "defensive might "
Since 1976. the Soviet Union has gained
strong allies in Ethiopia and South Yemen,
strengthened ties with Syria and improved
its positions in Indochina, while watching
the United States lose ground in Iran.
Nicaragua and other nations
But the Soviet Union also faces a difficult
guerrilla war in Afghanistan, sees NATO
and the Common Market gaining new mem
bers, is beset by trouble in Poland and is
confronted by U.S. plans for new military
expenditures.
The United States also has strengthened
its position in Somalia, possibly offsetting
Soviet gains in Ethiopia, and masterminded
the Camp David peace treaty between
Egypt and Israel, essentially cutting the So
viet Union out of Middle East diplomacy.
Perhaps foreshadowing comments by
Brezhnev at the congress, First Deputy De
fense Minister Sergei Sokolov wrote Sunday
in the military newspaper Red Star that
Moscow will continue to pursue "a policy of
preserving peace" despite what he called
attempts by the United States and its allies
to step up world tension.
The congress also will review the nation's
economic situation. There is no indication
whether Brezhnev will attempt to put the
best possible light on Soviet economic
progress, or will pointedly attack economic
inefficiencies and planning failures, as he
has in some previous speeches. He is also
expected to stress the need to improve food
supplies, a major national problem.
