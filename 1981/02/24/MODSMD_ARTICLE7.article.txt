China's official Xinhua News
Agency released this photo in
Beijing last week, calling it a
mummy of a young woman who
lived about 6470 years ago. The
body, wrapped in felt and
leather, was unearthed from a
tomb filled with sand by a group
of Chinese scientists probing
into the ancient city of Loulan,
about 400 km southwest of
Urumchi in northwest China.
