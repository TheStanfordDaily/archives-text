# Zim babwe will recognize USSR — with concessions
## 
### Washington Post 
Salisbury, Zimbabwe — More than 10
months after Zimbabwe achieved its in
dependence, the government has finally
agreed to establish diplomatic relations
with the Soviet Union.
The agreement announced Saturday,
however, contained unusual conditions
that Western diplomats called "embar
rassing and humiliating" for the Soviet
Union.
Under the terms, the Soviets have
been forced to cut all ties with the minor
ity Patriotic Front party of Joshua
Nkomo, the organization Moscow heav
ily supported during the seven-year guer
rilla war for black-majority rule.
The agreement was reached after two
weeks of negotiations, the third Soviet
effort since last April, between the For
eign Ministry and a delegation led by the
Soviet ambassador to Mozambique,
Valentin Vdovin.
"The two delegations emphasized that

diplomatic relations will be on a govern
ment-to-government basis only," the
agreement said, "and that the two gov
ernments will not enter into any agree
ments, arrangements or negotiations
with any organization without prior con
sultation and explicit approval of each
government."
Moscow had sought to maintain ties
with the Patriotic Front, which had an
office in the Soviet capital until recently.
During the war, the Soviets recognized
Nkomo's organization as the sole Zim
babwean liberation group and did not
deal with Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe
African National Union, which received
much of its support from China and Yu
goslavia.
Mugabe is now prime minister. He has
a nominal coalition with Nkomo but the
Patriotic Front has been given little
power or trust by Mugabe's group. This
is partly because of clashes between the
front's Soviet-equipped former guer

rillas and forces loyal to Mugabe.
The signing comes only one week after
serious clashes in the southwestern part
of the country between the two sides. The
government seemed sensitive about the
announcement, apparently because of
the internal political feud rather than
diplomatic reasons. The agreement was
signed Wednesday but the announcement
was delayed until one minute after mid
night Saturday. A similar agreement
was signed with Poland, Wednesday.
When Mugabe registered a landslide
victory in last February's elections the
Soviets were stunned. Most surprised of
all was Vassily Solodovnikov, the Soviet
ambassador to Zambia, who has close
ties with Nkomo.
Solodovnikov, reputed to be the top So
viet diplomat in black Africa, made two
fruitless visits to Salisbury to negotiate
recognition last year before the Soviets
switched to their ambassador in Mozam
bique, Zimbabwe's closest ally.

Vdovin succeeded after two weeks of
negotiations, during which the Soviets
reportedly had to drop their request to
maintain ties with the Patriotic Front.
Western diplomats noted that it is
highly unusual for governments to nego
tiate or impose conditions on establish
ing diplomatic relations with a new na
tion. Recognition is usually pro forma,
accomplished by an exchange of notes
rather than by a formal written accord
with conditions stipulated.
The agreement "is embarrassing and
humiliating for the Soviets since it sin
gles them out," one Western am
bassador said. Another diplomat said,
"It is not terribly polite in its implica
tions."
Foreign Minister Witness Man
gwende, in remarks at the signing,
pointed out that this was the third Soviet
delegation to come here for the nego
tiations, which "involved a wide-ranging
review of past relations."
