# Shaky economy plagues Syria

### Washington Post 
Damascus, Syria — For the second time in a
decade, Syria is discovering the cost of relying
on Arab oil countries' largesse tor economic
development in this era of "no war. no peace"
in the Mideast.
Foreign exchange problems, balance of
payments deficits and 30 percent inflation are
forcing President Hafez Assad's government
to cut back on imports and investments, raise
controlled prices and generally tighten belts.
Baghdad summit
Although the Baghdad summit consecrated
Syria's role as the major state confronting Is
rael, today's problems are beginning to look
like a rerun of Syria's troubles in the
mid-19705.
Some Arab allies never honored their Bagh
dad pledges, at least not in full. No official
statistics are published on this score.
Iraq, the only regular "on the barrel head"
contributor, paid up in 1979 and during most of
1980, despite a steady deterioration of relations
with Damascus. But Iraq's payments are
thought to have stopped after the outbreak of
its war with Iran, as punishment for Syrian
backing of the Tehran regime.
Despite Assad's proclaimed union with Lib
ya last year, even optimists doubt the Libyans
have contributed more than $100 million since
the Baghdad summit, which set their contribu
tion at a much higher level.
Indeed, Syrians and foreign diplomats alike
have a favorite guessing game: estimating the
size and frequency of the Arab oil state con
tributions, generally thought to have netted
Syria about $1.6 billion in 1980. Analysts are
convinced that Syria will get less this year.
Soviet demands for cash payment on new
arms deliveries are believed to represent the
major strain on Syria's foreign exchange re
serves, variously estimated at $200 million or

almost nil And about 50 percent of this year's
state expenditure is allotted to go to defense.
No statistics are published on weapons pro
curement costs, but businessmen's complaints
about difficulties in obtaining foreign ex
change for officially approved contracts tend
to prove untrue the central bank's assurances
about its plentiful reserves and balance of
payments situation.
Economists privately estimate Syria's bal
ance of payments deficit last year to have been
between $300 million and $500 million — even
after taking into account $1 billion of remit
tances from Syrians working abroad.
Pessimists suggest that about $50 million
worth of banknotes were printed to fill the gap
between that deficit and central bank re
serves.
Hard currency
With little or no hard currency to spare — or
in the offing — Syria has scaled back govern
ment imports, budgets and investment pro
grams.
Cutting the cloth to fit the means is part of
Syrian management tradition, which eschews
the borrowing from commercial banks that in
recent years landed Egypt and Turkey in dire
financial straits. Government imports, which
increased from $3.5 billion in 1979 to $5 billion
in 1980, are expected to be cut back drastically.
Even so, analysts see little reason to be op
timistic.
After a real increase in gross domestic prod
uct of 10 to 12 percent last year, fueled in part
by heavy salary raises in the large public sec
tor. the government seems condemned to tak
ing the price lids off items from telephone
charges to diesel fuel, which now sells at a
third of cost.
No changes are thought likely in subsidies
for such politically sensitive staples as bread,
cooking oil and rice.
