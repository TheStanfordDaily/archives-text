# Coup fails in Spain as leader surrenders
## 
### Washington Post 
Madrid — Eighteen hours after it
started with the hostage-taking of ev
ery major elected political figure in
Spain, a military coup attempt ended
yesterday with the surrender of the
chief plotter and the release un
harmed of all his captives.
Shortly after noon, coup leader An
tonio Tejero Molina, 49, a lieutenant
colonel in the paramilitary Civil
Guard, was taken to the Guard's na
tional headquarters to surrender to his
own commander-in-chief. His ex
pressed wish to surrender at the El
Pardo palace, Generalissimo Francis
co Franco's old residence, was denied.
Tejero's dramatic gesture — he
burst in shooting a pistol and kid
napped the lower house of Parliament
— fell apart when the support he ap
parently was banking on from the
Spanish armed forces failed to materi
alize.
"You can all leave," he said to the
350-member Parliament when the ne
gotiations were over. "Nothing has
happened. All I know is that this will
cost me 30 to 40 years in jail."
Parliamentary speaker Landelino
Lavicla, who was presiding over the
chamber when Tejero burst in at the
head of the first force of 20 rebel Civil
Guardsmen at about 6:30 p.m. Monday
and forced him off the dais at pistol
point, immediately announced the re
sumption of business as usual today.
The main point on the agenda will be
the vote that Tejero interrupted for
the investiture of Leopoldo Calvo
Sotelo to succeed Adolfo Suarez as
prime minister at the head of a center
right Cabinet.
Emotional statements
In their often emotional statements
after their release, the deputies never
theless seemed to share a consensus
that things could never be as before
among them. They appeared to ex
press a yearning to overcome the hu
miliation that had been heaped upon
the country's entire political leader
ship, in and out of opposition and gov
ernment, by huddling together in a
broader coalition embracing the so
cialists as well as the moderate ma
jority that has steered Spain through a
five-year transition from dictatorship
to democracy.
This was all the more true as many
of the hostages believed during the
night that dictatorship had returned to
Spain.
"I was convinced that we would be
moved from Parliament to a concen
tration camp," a Socialist member of
Parliament admitted after his re
lease.
Strain of the kidnapping
The strain of the kidnapping showed
as the rumpled hostages emerged free
from the Parliament building yester
day. Rafael Calvo Sotelo, the nor
mally taciturn secretary general of
the ruling Centrist Party, burst into
tears. A common theme in their first
statements was of the fear they had
for their own lives and for the future of
representative government here.
The only institution to have

emerged from the testing with its
prestige enhanced was the constitu
tional monarchy headed by King Juan
Carlos, who worked through the night
to prevent the armed forces from fol
lowing Tejero's lead
In addition to a solemn three
minute televised appeal for respect of
the constitutional order, the king per
sonally called each of Spain's nine ma
jor regional military commanders to
head off any temptation to rally to the
coup. The calls even included one to
Capt.-Gen. Jaime Milans del Bosch of
the Valencia region, who had called
out his forces in apparent support of
the coup.
That general's decision to rescind
the state of emergency proclaimed in
