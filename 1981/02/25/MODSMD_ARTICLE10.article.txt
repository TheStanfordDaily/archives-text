# Lasers help measure pollution
## 
### Matt Herron 
In the past two decades pow
erful new tools have been de
veloped for use in
meteorological and at
mospheric research. One such
tool is light detection and Rang
ing (lidar), which is finding
many new applications in the
areas of air pollution monitor
ing and detection.
In principal, lidar works
much like radar, but instead of
bouncing radio waves a very
short, powerful burst of laser
light is reflected off gases or
dust particles in the air, and re
ceived by a sensitive light detec
tor. The signals are then proc
essed by a computer.
SRI International (formerly
Stanford Research Institute)
near the Stanford campus, has
been a leader in lidar research
since mid-1860s and has just
completed a hybrid lidar system
called the Differential Absorp
tion Lidar (DIAL). This SRI
project is sponsored by the utili
ty industry's Electric Power
and Research Institute (EPRI)
in Palo Alto.

According to Jim Hawley,
leader for the DIAL system at
SRI. the system is being con
sidered for use in predicting
smog alerts in the Los Angeles
oasin High altitude remote sen
sing of some of the more serious
pollutatns such as ozone could
provide early warning of period
of heavy pollution. Present
monitoring methods do not have
this capability
Robert Byer, a professor of
aplied physics at Stanford who
has developed similar lidar sys
tem for research use, hints at
the possibility of using lidar to
help locate oil fields by measur
ing methane gas that escapes
from oil and gas deposits in the
ground, or to detect leaks in
pipeline flanges and valves in
refineries.
Lidar has been used this year
to study the movement of vol
canic ash spewed into the upper
stratosphere by Mount St.
Helens as well as to probe be
neath the surface of the ocean to
make temperature meas
urements.
Although the technology be
hind SRl's DIAL system is be

coming increasingly complex,
the underlying concept remains
basically unchanged.
Each gas has light-absorption
characteristics as unique as hu
man fingerprints. The SRI
DIAL system uses two separate
lasers, each tuned to the "firv
gerprints," or absorption fre
quencies, of the particular gas
being monitered. During
monitoring, both lasers send out
very short, intense pulses of
light, part of which are scat
tered by particles and
molecules in the air.
A small amount of this laser
light is scattered back to the
system's receiving telescope;
the amount and intensity of this
backscatter determines the
characteristics and behavior of
the gas being monitored.
According to SRl's Hawley,
future plans may include in
stallation in the space shuttle of
a global meterorological lidar
which would be able to detect
temperatures wind and gas con
stituants on a world-wide bases,
thereby facilitating accurate
weather predictions weeks in
advance.
