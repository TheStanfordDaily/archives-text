## Kennedy's letter appropriate statement of opinion on union 
### 
Recently, President Donald Kennedy
sent a letter to all faculty, staff and em
ployees of the University making clear his
stand against the present unionization ef
forts of clerical and office support staff.
The Daily supports this action as an un
equivocal statement of personal opinion
and expression of management views. As
such, it was appropriate both that the let
ter bore Kennedy 's name and title and that
it was addressed to all 8000 faculty and
staff.
In his Jan. 27 letter, Kennedy said he be
lieved "it would be a mistake to unionize."
Wholly apart irom the merits of the
unionization issue, Kennedy's forth
rightness in making clear his position on
the issue instead of hiding behind bureau
cratic channels is to be applauded. The
tone of the letter, addressed to "friends,"
seemed an honest attempt by Kennedy to
include all members of the University
community in discussion of the question.
I, This greeting was not condescending, but
'* placed all University employees on the
- same level.
By circulating the letter to all employ

ees rather than only those 2000 clerical
and office workers affected by the
unionization effort, Kennedy effectively
and openly made public both his stance
and his concept of the university as a com
munity. In the letter, he cited the "real
problems involving salaries, leaves, bene
fits, career opportunities and working
conditions for office and library staff."
Although his priorities as president of a
University lie with the humanities and ac
ademic related matters, Kennedy clearly
stated his concern for clerical discontent.
Rather than adopting an unclear or am
biguous position, he emphasized that "ul
timately the University has to deal with
these issues." Despite suspicions that the
letter was an improper attempt by Ken
nedy to thwart the unionization move
ment, the circulation of a statement of the
University's point of view was ethical and
legal.
Ultimately, the wide distribution of a
clear view on such an important subject
reflects favorably on the credibility of
both Kennedy and the University. Ken
nedy's candor is to be commended.
