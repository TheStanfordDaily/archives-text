t The issue here is not President Donald
Kennedy's right to free speech, but that in
. the face of an initiative by clerical work
ers to unionize, Kennedy's letter is an in
appropriate response.
The movement to unionize, the ultimate
success of which hinges on the outcome of
a referendum among office staff to be held
May 7,, will undoubtedly be a source of
much University-clerical debate in the
coming months. However, it is poor prac
tice by the University to open its cam
paign against unionization with a
statement from the office of the Presi
dent, rather than one from those divisions
_ of the administration properly concerned
with the question of unionization â€” the
Personnel or University Counsel's offices.
In addition, the letter was sent through
University channels to all faculty and
staff, and clericals who support
unionization were required to distribute it
even though they felt it was against their

best interests. Such ready staff power is
not available to the Office Staff Organiz
ing Committee.
It is clear that the University adminis
tration opposes a clerical workers union;
it is only in this light that Kennedy's letter
can be seen. Kennedy has attempted to use
his prestige to stop the union from form
ing, and the full import of his letter cannot
be reduced to that of a mere'' statement of
personal opinion." This type of action by
the president, which poses at mere dis
semination of information, is but a thinly
disguised attempt at coercion.
Without passing judgment on the merits
of unionization, we hope that fairer tactics
than the malconceived Kennedy letter will
be employed by the University in its up
coming communications with the
clercical staff.

board members Vic Goetz, Clay Moltz
and Seth Zuckerman.
