## Eliminate Social Security program 
### 
President Ronald Reagan's
economic program appears to
be an excellent first step toward
revitalization of the American
economy. However, the $41
billion budget cut will come
from the 25 percent of the Fed
eral budget which provides for
public works projects, gov
ernmental loan guarantees, fed
eral income sharing with the
states, and departmental oper
ating funds. These cuts com
prise only six percent of former
President Jimmy Carter's 1982
budget but 25 percent in the
areas mentioned. Further, Rea
gan's budget still includes a $45
billion deficit.
Deficit spending must stop if
the nation is not to face econom
ic disaster. Continued double
digit inflation makes any notion
of financial security ludicrous
and shatters the universal
dream of a better future. In in
flationary times, we spend for
today as we know that our future
dollar (ten years from now) will

be worth nine cents, further
fueling the inflationary inferno.
Inflation is the direct result of
the government printing dollars
without a proportional increase
in the real wealth of the nation;
more simply, it is the result of
the Congress having legislated
budget deficits. Congress could
fund the deficits through in
creased taxes or with paper
dollars. No one likes increased
taxes, and so inflation is the re
sult of the dilemma.
It is extremely unlikely that
Reagan will get all of the budget
cuts he asked for. More cuts
must be made, but they will not
come from the areas men
tioned. These are the pork-bar
rel programs which will be the
most vigorously defended by
jealous Congressmen and lob
byists from special interest
groups.
Reagan is increasing the de
fense budget; a prudent move as

the world is a more dangerous
place due to increasingly ag
gressive behavior by the Soviets
and their Libyan and Cuban
lackeys. To go back to Hobbes,
defense is the fundamental role
of a government. Thus, cuts are
going to have to be made in the
so-called "safety-net" pro
grams, more specifically Social
Security. These programs pro
tected from the axe of Office of
Management and Budget Direc
tor David Stockman will com
prise 41 percent of the budget in
1984, and higher percentages in
the years ahead.
Social Security is supposed to
serve a dual purpose. First, it is
conceived as a source of min
imum income support for the
elderly and survivors. This
amounts to a socialization of in
come transfer between gener
ations. Most civilized nations
revere the elderly; leaving
them without any means of sup
port is unthinkable. However,
Social Security benefits leave
recipiants doubly poor as their
income is not as great as that in
working years, and if real
growth continues
payments do not increase at a
proportional rate.
Second, Social Security is
supposed to serve as annuity in
come, much like life insurance.
That Social Security serves in
vestors as well in this regard is a
figment of New Deal imagina
tion. The return on a savings
bond which takes years to
mature is less than what one can
get from a passbook account at
a savings bank. It might be use
ful to speculate how many peo
ple would invest in Social Secur
ity instead of money market
funds or gold if given the choice.
Given that the rates of return on
the latter are much greater, not
many would opt for Social Se
curity.
Social Security is not funded
as an annuity account. Current
Social Security benefits are
funded from current Social Se
curity receipts. For example,
one does not pay into one's own
account to be drawn on later,
but transfers his money to cur
rent recipiants. Thus, Social Se
curity is in everything but name
an income redistribution mech
anism, or more negatively con
noted, a welfare program.
It is a welfare program in
very serious trouble. Currently
budgeted outlays (liabilities)
exceed currently budgeted tax
es (assets) by $800 billion, an
amount twice that of the
privately held debt of the na
tion. With the birth rate declin

ing and average longevity in
creasing, under the current sys
tem workers are going to have
to pay more tax as the ratio of
retirees to workers increases.
Professor Michael Boskin of
the Stanford Economics De
partment predicts that FICA
tax rates will have to increase 20
percent of income below the
ceiling after which one is no
longer taxed for Social Security.
It is incredible to think of the
rate that would have to be paid
to maintain current benefits in
the nineties as well as to retire
the debt of the program.
The Social Security system as
presently constituted should be
abolished. Assets and liabilities
of the system should be as
sumed by the Federal Govern
ment. The Federal Government
would provide a monthly
payment of $200 per month
which is 164 percent of the cur
rent minimun payment and 75
percent of the average
payment.
Keeping benefits propor
tional to real growth would
force the millions dependent on
these payments to vigorously
oppose deficit spending the
printing of paper money. No one
wants the elderly and the sur
vivors to suffer, but by keeping
federal transfer payments fix
ed, there would be an enormous
lobby for balancing the budget
and seeing that no more deficits
are authorized.
Public recognition that
payments to the elderly and sur
vivors are essentially welfare
payments instead of annuities,
would make workers more
amenable to saving for retire
ment as no one likes to be con
sidered as being on something
called welfare, especially in old
age. Further, if these groups are
truly in a desperate position,
their families should be more
willing to help out as no one likes
to see those dearest to them
solely supported by welfare.
Most importantly, as workers
realize that in order to have a re
tirement above subsistance
levels they will have to save
more. Their savings and invest
ment would provide the capital
base upon which future real
growth can be generated. This,
in concert with the elimination
of deficit spending should pro
vide the basis for sound econom
ic growth in America's third
century which will be brighter
than the first two.

President Ronald Reagan's
economic program appears to
be an excellent first step toward
revitalization of the American
economy. However, the $41
billion budget cut will come
from the 25 percent of the Fed
eral budget which provides for
public works projects, gov
ernmental loan guarantees, fed
eral income sharing with the
states, and departmental oper
ating funds. These cuts com
prise only six percent of former
President Jimmy Carter's 1982
budget but 25 percent in the
areas mentioned. Further, Rea
gan's budget still includes a $45
billion deficit.
Deficit spending must stop if
the nation is not to face econom
ic disaster. Continued double
digit inflation makes any notion
of financial security ludicrous
and shatters the universal
dream of a better future. In in
flationary times, we spend for
today as we know that our future
dollar (ten years from now) will

be worth nine cents, further
fueling the inflationary inferno.
Inflation is the direct result of
the government printing dollars
without a proportional increase
in the real wealth of the nation;
more simply, it is the result of
the Congress having legislated
budget deficits. Congress could
fund the deficits through in
creased taxes or with paper
dollars. No one likes increased
taxes, and so inflation is the re
sult of the dilemma.
It is extremely unlikely that
Reagan will get all of the budget
cuts he asked for. More cuts
must be made, but they will not
come from the areas men
tioned. These are the pork-bar
rel programs which will be the
most vigorously defended by
jealous Congressmen and lob
byists from special interest
groups.
Reagan is increasing the de
fense budget; a prudent move as

the world is a more dangerous
place due to increasingly ag
gressive behavior by the Soviets
and their Libyan and Cuban
lackeys. To go back to Hobbes,
defense is the fundamental role
of a government. Thus, cuts are
going to have to be made in the
so-called "safety-net" pro
grams, more specifically Social
Security. These programs pro
tected from the axe of Office of
Management and Budget Direc
tor David Stockman will com
prise 41 percent of the budget in
1984, and higher percentages in
the years ahead.
Social Security is supposed to
serve a dual purpose. First, it is
conceived as a source of min
imum income support for the
elderly and survivors. This
amounts to a socialization of in
come transfer between gener
ations. Most civilized nations
revere the elderly; leaving
them without any means of sup
port is unthinkable. However,
Social Security benefits leave
recipiants doubly poor as their
income is not as great as that in
working years, and if real
growth continues
payments do not increase at a
proportional rate.
Second, Social Security is
supposed to serve as annuity in
come, much like life insurance.
That Social Security serves in
vestors as well in this regard is a
figment of New Deal imagina
tion. The return on a savings
bond which takes years to
mature is less than what one can
get from a passbook account at
a savings bank. It might be use
ful to speculate how many peo
ple would invest in Social Secur
ity instead of money market
funds or gold if given the choice.
Given that the rates of return on
the latter are much greater, not
many would opt for Social Se
curity.
Social Security is not funded
as an annuity account. Current
Social Security benefits are
funded from current Social Se
curity receipts. For example,
one does not pay into one's own
account to be drawn on later,
but transfers his money to cur
rent recipiants. Thus, Social Se
curity is in everything but name
an income redistribution mech
anism, or more negatively con
noted, a welfare program.
It is a welfare program in
very serious trouble. Currently
budgeted outlays (liabilities)
exceed currently budgeted tax
es (assets) by $800 billion, an
amount twice that of the
privately held debt of the na
tion. With the birth rate declin

ing and average longevity in
creasing, under the current sys
tem workers are going to have
to pay more tax as the ratio of
retirees to workers increases.
Professor Michael Boskin of
the Stanford Economics De
partment predicts that FICA
tax rates will have to increase 20
percent of income below the
ceiling after which one is no
longer taxed for Social Security.
It is incredible to think of the
rate that would have to be paid
to maintain current benefits in
the nineties as well as to retire
the debt of the program.
The Social Security system as
presently constituted should be
abolished. Assets and liabilities
of the system should be as
sumed by the Federal Govern
ment. The Federal Government
would provide a monthly
payment of $200 per month
which is 164 percent of the cur
rent minimun payment and 75
percent of the average
payment.
Keeping benefits propor
tional to real growth would
force the millions dependent on
these payments to vigorously
oppose deficit spending the
printing of paper money. No one
wants the elderly and the sur
vivors to suffer, but by keeping
federal transfer payments fix
ed, there would be an enormous
lobby for balancing the budget
and seeing that no more deficits
are authorized.
Public recognition that
payments to the elderly and sur
vivors are essentially welfare
payments instead of annuities,
would make workers more
amenable to saving for retire
ment as no one likes to be con
sidered as being on something
called welfare, especially in old
age. Further, if these groups are
truly in a desperate position,
their families should be more
willing to help out as no one likes
to see those dearest to them
solely supported by welfare.
Most importantly, as workers
realize that in order to have a re
tirement above subsistance
levels they will have to save
more. Their savings and invest
ment would provide the capital
base upon which future real
growth can be generated. This,
in concert with the elimination
of deficit spending should pro
vide the basis for sound econom
ic growth in America's third
century which will be brighter
than the first two.
