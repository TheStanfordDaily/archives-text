## Poland faces its 'hour of decision' 
### 
No other communist state
has ever seen anything like the
open dissent and defiance that
has racked Poland since last Au
gust, and it probably represents
a momentous turning point for
the Soviet bloc and the world
communist movement. The re
sult is still undecided, but two
outcomes seem likely: that the
Polish workers may successful
ly defend and enlarge their
rights, turning Poland into a re
ally pluralistic state; or that the
Soviet Union may by forcible ac
tion crush the insurgency and
make Poland a conformist sat
ellite like Czechoslovakia.

Either of these outcomes would
promise fundamental change in
the communist world.
The Polish workers have al
ready smashed the myth that
the communist state is omnipo
tent over its own people and in
vulnerable to organized opposi
tion, and that the masses may
be unhappy but are apathetic
and incapable of action. Com
munist cohesion and discipline
rest on this myth and on the
dogma that the victory of the
communist system is preor
dained and foregone.
The Polish demonstration of
the incompetence and weakness
of Communist Party rulership
makes nonsense of these ideas
as no previous even has done. If
the Polish authorities are driven
to recognize the legitimacy of
the independent workers' move
ment, reinforced by the free
Church and perhaps a free
peasantry, they can hardly con
tinue to live by the doctrines of
monolithic Leninism. Poland
will have effectively ceased to
be a communist state.
If Poland is thus semi-liber
ated in defiance of Soviet
hegemony, the rulers of other
states of Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union itself cannot
prevent winds of freedom enter
ing their realms, fanning forces
for change. Poland is an exam
ple of national self-assertion in
a region where nationalistic
feelings are everywhere pres
ent but mostly repressed. If the
Poles can be free and can defy
the Soviet big brother, who has
done much more barking than
against Czechoslovakia in 1968
without thus far biting, why
should not Hungarians, Czechs,
Lithuanians, even Ukrainians
and others held down by Soviet
power do as much? Na
tionalistic discontent was al
ready rising; it may become un
controllable.
Similarly, the truly Marxist
role of the Polish proletariat,
far more effectively organized
by Solidarity than ever by the
Communist Party, will in
evitably stir workers all over
eastern Europe. They have been
showing many signs in recent
years of weariness of the par
ty's tutelage. Now they will

know that it is possible to shake
it off. If the Poles succeed, they
will amplify the disintegrative
forces eroding the pseudo
monolithic Communist sys
tems. These will doubtless
evolve more rapidly from mili
tary-revolutionary, more or less
totalistic systems to more re
laxed and ordinary states.
If, on the other hand, the Sovi
et Union somehow crushes the
independence movement, the
results will be quite contrary
and much more dangerous. So
viet intervention, especially if
accompanied by considerable
bloodshed, would end thoughts
of self-assertion for many
years. But it would have to be an
act of outright Russian im
perialism, a reassertion of do
minion over the Poles like that
held by the tsarist empire. It
would seal, in effect, the ripen
ing of Lenin's once idealistic
Communism into National
Bolshevism, the right of the
strongest to rule totally by ruth
less power.
The Soviet bloc would become
simply a huge multinational
empire that the Russians were
determined to keep by armed
might in an age of the dissolu
tion of empires. Apart from the
tragedy that this would be for
the two hundred million re
pressed, it would be a grave
menace for the world. The em
pire would be an increasingly
hollow and brittle despotism,

unable to govern efficiently and
fearful of any concessions. It
would inevitably show signs of
cracking, and the Russian
rulers might then by expected to
lash out against the supposed
foreign instigators of their trou
bles with their only means of ac
tion, military force. The nuclear
stockpiles built up since 1945
would have their apocalyptic
day.
There may be numerous vari
ants of these basic scenarios or
possibly others, such as the
Polish government repressing
the dissidence by violence. But
Poland, with much of the rest of
the communist world likely to
follow sooner or later, faces a
fundamental and fateful choice,
the communist state can adapt
pragmatically and bend with
forces for change, or the ruling
elites can rigidly resist by ruth
less violence. Previously, the
Soviets and their allies had usu
ally insisted on conformity at
whatever cost, but recent
events in Poland give some
hopes of flexibility — if the Sovi
ets will allow it. The choice may
be between progress toward a
more peaceful, less divided, and
more orderly world, or stumbl
ing toward the ultimate holo
caust.

peasantry, they can hardly con
tinue to live by the doctrines of
monolithic Leninism. Poland
will have effectively ceased to
be a communist state.
If Poland is thus semi-liber
ated in defiance of Soviet
hegemony, the rulers of other
states of Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union itself cannot
prevent winds of freedom enter
ing their realms, fanning forces
for change. Poland is an exam
ple of national self-assertion in
a region where nationalistic
feelings are everywhere pres
ent but mostly repressed. If the
Poles can be free and can defy
the Soviet big brother, who has
done much more barking than
against Czechoslovakia in 1968
without thus far biting, why
should not Hungarians, Czechs,
Lithuanians, even Ukrainians
and others held down by Soviet
power do as much? Na
tionalistic discontent was al
ready rising; it may become un
controllable.
Similarly, the truly Marxist
role of the Polish proletariat,
far more effectively organized
by Solidarity than ever by the
Communist Party, will in
evitably stir workers all over
eastern Europe. They have been
showing many signs in recent
years of weariness of the par
ty's tutelage. Now they will

know that it is possible to shake
it off. If the Poles succeed, they
will amplify the disintegrative
forces eroding the pseudo
monolithic Communist sys
tems. These will doubtless
evolve more rapidly from mili
tary-revolutionary, more or less
totalistic systems to more re
laxed and ordinary states.
If, on the other hand, the Sovi
et Union somehow crushes the
independence movement, the
results will be quite contrary
and much more dangerous. So
viet intervention, especially if
accompanied by considerable
bloodshed, would end thoughts
of self-assertion for many
years. But it would have to be an
act of outright Russian im
perialism, a reassertion of do
minion over the Poles like that
held by the tsarist empire. It
would seal, in effect, the ripen
ing of Lenin's once idealistic
Communism into National
Bolshevism, the right of the
strongest to rule totally by ruth
less power.
The Soviet bloc would become
simply a huge multinational
empire that the Russians were
determined to keep by armed
might in an age of the dissolu
tion of empires. Apart from the
tragedy that this would be for
the two hundred million re
pressed, it would be a grave
menace for the world. The em
pire would be an increasingly
hollow and brittle despotism,

unable to govern efficiently and
fearful of any concessions. It
would inevitably show signs of
cracking, and the Russian
rulers might then by expected to
lash out against the supposed
foreign instigators of their trou
bles with their only means of ac
tion, military force. The nuclear
stockpiles built up since 1945
would have their apocalyptic
day.
There may be numerous vari
ants of these basic scenarios or
possibly others, such as the
Polish government repressing
the dissidence by violence. But
Poland, with much of the rest of
the communist world likely to
follow sooner or later, faces a
fundamental and fateful choice,
the communist state can adapt
pragmatically and bend with
forces for change, or the ruling
elites can rigidly resist by ruth
less violence. Previously, the
Soviets and their allies had usu
ally insisted on conformity at
whatever cost, but recent
events in Poland give some
hopes of flexibility — if the Sovi
ets will allow it. The choice may
be between progress toward a
more peaceful, less divided, and
more orderly world, or stumbl
ing toward the ultimate holo
caust.

No other communist state
has ever seen anything like the
open dissent and defiance that
has racked Poland since last Au
gust, and it probably represents
a momentous turning point for
the Soviet bloc and the world
communist movement. The re
sult is still undecided, but two
outcomes seem likely: that the
Polish workers may successful
ly defend and enlarge their
rights, turning Poland into a re
ally pluralistic state; or that the
Soviet Union may by forcible ac
tion crush the insurgency and
make Poland a conformist sat
ellite like Czechoslovakia.

Either of these outcomes would
promise fundamental change in
the communist world.
The Polish workers have al
ready smashed the myth that
the communist state is omnipo
tent over its own people and in
vulnerable to organized opposi
tion, and that the masses may
be unhappy but are apathetic
and incapable of action. Com
munist cohesion and discipline
rest on this myth and on the
dogma that the victory of the
communist system is preor
dained and foregone.
The Polish demonstration of
the incompetence and weakness
of Communist Party rulership
makes nonsense of these ideas
as no previous even has done. If
the Polish authorities are driven
to recognize the legitimacy of
the independent workers' move
ment, reinforced by the free
Church and perhaps a free
peasantry, they can hardly con
tinue to live by the doctrines of
monolithic Leninism. Poland
will have effectively ceased to
