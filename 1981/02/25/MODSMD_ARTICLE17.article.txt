'Draconian' cut
backs
President Ronald Reagan, in
formulating his "program for
economic recovery," promised
that the burden of budget cuts
would be shared equally by all.
But in fact, several important
programs have been singled out
for particularly draconian cut
backs. These include the al
ready poorly-funded National
Endowment for the Humanities
(NEH) and the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting.
Reagan is optomistic that
wealthy patrons will step in and
make the shortfalls, but he ig
nores the potential conse
quences if they do not, Consider
for example the impact of these
cuts on the Bay Area alone: the
San Francisco Opera, Ballet,
and Symphony, as well as many
theatres and museums all re
ceive major funding from NEH
and would face severe hardships
in the wake of the proposed cuts.
Seasons might have to be
curtailed, and ticket prices
would surely rise substantially.
(Then indeed only the wealthy
could afford to patronize the
arts.)
Reagan is sadly mistaken if

he believes that the problems of
our society are due entirely to
government; ours is a society
which is increasingly domi
nated by the values of material
ism and self-gratification, often
at the expense of others. Under
the circumstances, we can ill af
ford to neglect the humanizing
potential of the arts. Any reduc
tion in support now can only lead
to greater problems in the
future.

Preprofessionals
Having been involved in pre
professional advising, I enjoyed
reading Chip Sandground's
thoughts about preprofessional
education (Daily, Feb. 18).
While I agree fundamentally,
it's important to remember sev
eral things.
1) The requirements with
which premedical students
must contend are imposed by
the medical schools, not in any
way by undergraduate institu
tions.
2) The requirements are nu
merous, but no more so than for
those students selecting other

fields (e.g., engineering), and
despite the problems tne stu
dent does know what he or she is
getting into.
3) The number of students ap
plying to medical schools (and
law schools, too, for that mat
ter) is not increasing, but has
begun the last few years to de
crease.
4) Refreshingly, many, many
committees on admissions in
medical schools are interested
in the student with activities,
courses and majors outside the
scientific areas, and most evi
dence indicates that students
are well advised to select their
major on criteria of intellectual
fulfillment and how well they
like it rather than how it might
affect their applications to pro
fessional schools.
It's good to see that many pre
professional students are con
sidering these issues, and I urge
any who would like to discuss
them to do so with their own ad
visors, with the people at the Ac
ademic Information Center, and
with others who are interested
