## Democrats belittle economic projections 
### 
Washington (AP) — Democratic tax writ
ers in the House today dismissed as "jelly
bean talk" and "hallucinogenic" claims by
President Ronald Reagan's chief economic
advisers that a 30 percent personal income
tax cut over three years will dramatically
improve the economy.
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan
bristled at the Democratic assault on the
president's economic program during a
hearing of the House Ways and Means Com
mittee. Regan held his ground, insisting
that tax cuts would stimulate the economy
by encouraging savings and investment.
The Senate, meanwhile, is beginning the
task of turning Reagan's budget-cutting
proposals into reality.
Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker
of Tennessee, after a meeting with the pres
ident, said he hoped the Senate could com
plete floor action on Reagan's proposed
budget cuts by mid-April, and predicted
"good bipartisan cooperation."
After his White House meeting with GOP
congressional leaders, Reagan said the leg

islative campaign "is now fully under
way."
The president told reporters that the na
tion's governors, whom he met Monday,
recognize that his program will require
some belt-tightening, but "they also agreed
that only if our government grows less will
our economy grow more."
The governors yesterday gave bipartisn
endorsement to the administration's eco
nomic revovery fight.
At the Ways and Means hearing, the
treasury secretary said the plan to cut taxes
and federal spending represented a "break
from traditional econometric models" on
the theory that it was best to "put money in
the family budget rather than the federal
budget."
He said tax cuts enacted in previous ad
ministrations proved that the Reagan plan
would work.

Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) the com
mittee chairman, interrupted Regan to pro
test that "we're talking about big dollars."
Rep. J.J. Pickle (D-Texas) characterized
the administration's projections as "jelly
bean talk," in a reference to the president's
favorite candy.
Rep. Thomas J. Downey (D-N.Y.) said
Regan was basing his conclusions on
"threadbare evidence" that was "hallu
cinogenic."
"I resent that," Regan shot back angrily.
Budget director David Stockman told the
panel the package of targets for budget cuts
was carefully compiled and was "not some
kind of random hit list."
Before the hearing, Rostenkowski made
clear the committee would fashion its own
tax-cut plan for House consideration, and
that changes in Reagan's proposals were
certain to be made.
