# Lowenstein assailant judged innocent by reason of insanity
## 
### Newsday 
New York — The 38-year-old killer of former
Rep. Allard K. Lowenstein (D-N.Y.) was found
innocent Monday by reason of insanity and will
be sent to a state institution for treatment.
Acting State Supreme Court Justice Brenda
Soloff found Dennis Sweeney "not responsible
by reason of mental disease or defect." Her
ruling, which under a new state law does not
require a trial, was based on unanimous find
ings by psychiatrists for both the prosecution
and defense. They agreed that Sweeney is —
and was at the time of the act — suffering from
"severely debilitating mental disease."
The ruling comes less than a year after
Sweeney walked into Lowenstein's Rock
efeller Plaza offices, fatally wounded him with
a pistol he had bought near his Connecticut
home and then sat down to smoke a cigarette
while office workers summoned police.
Sweeney's attorney, Jesse Zaslav, said Mon
day that Sweeney thinks that Lowenstein is
still alive. He added that Sweeney believes
Lowenstein "controlled his thought patterns"
and was responsible for the assassination of
President John Kennedy and the plane crash
death of New York Yankee catcher Thurman
Munson.

Assistant District Attorney John Rieck
agreed with Zaslav on the judge's ruling. The
March 14 murder, said the prosecutor, was a
"horrendous, brutal, anti-social act" but "our
complete inability to prove criminal responsi
bility ... forecloses the possibility of a trial in
this case. "
Said Justice Soloff: "There is really is no
other sensible disposition of this case."
The slim, bearded defendant sat quietly dur
ing the proceedings, at times resting his head
on his hand. He spoke haltingly and softly,
saying that he understood the charge, the plea
and the consequences.
Justice Soloff said she will sign an order on
March 23 turning Sweeney over to the state
Mental Health Department.
Under the law, if Sweeney someday is found
to be cured, he could be freed and would not
have to stand trial for the crime.
"I have no quarrel with the verdict," said
Lowenstein's brother, Lawrence, Monday
night. "We appreciate Sweeney's mental state
and know that no other motive could be estab
lished.
