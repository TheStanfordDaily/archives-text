# Sun Devils, Wildcats on menu
## Cards head for desert

Defeating sixth-ranked teams
such as UCLA, which Stanford's
men's basketball squad ac
complished Saturday, entitles
the victor to certain privileges
— fame, fortune, and the chance
to play the nation's fifth-ranked
team.
Arizona State, rated No. 5 in
this week's AP poll, serves as
the Cardinals' opposition tomor
row evening in Tempe. Stanford
also plays Arizona Saturday af
ternoon at Tucson in a regional
ly-televised game (KRON-TV,
Ch. 4. 3 p.m.).
Don't expect the Cards (4-11
in the Pacific-10 Conference,
8-16 overall) to suffer a letdown
following the intoxicating
UCLA victory, because they
can't afford to.
ASU, 12-2 in conference and
20-3 overall, boasts what may be
the league's best combination of
quickness and size. The Sun
Devils' quickness is embodied
in guards Lafayette Lever and
Byron Scott (who, at 6-foot-5,
has fine size for his position).
Lever and Scott teamed up for

36 points and five steals, and
helped force Stanford into 22
turnovers in ASU's 84-66 victory
here last month.
As for ASU's size, 6-foot-8 for
wards Johnny Nash and Sam
Williams and 7-foot center Alton
Lister ought to give the Cards'
front line their most severe test
of the season. Lister has been
particularly effective this sea
son, averaging 15.2 points and
9.7 rebounds each outing.
Beating the Sun Devils, or
even playing them close, re
quires no great strategy.
"There are a lot of things we're
going to have to do right," Stan
ford head coach Dick Dißiaso
said.
The Cards did a few things
right the first time they played
Arizona — they scored 81 points,
for example. However, that was
the evening Wildcat forwards
Ron Davis and Robbie Dosty did
excellent Bill Sharman imita
tions, scoring 32 points apiece to
highlight the 91-81 triumph over
Stanford. Arizona owns a 6-8
Pac-10 record and is 11-12 over

all.
After reviewing the films of
that loss, Dißiaso said that ex
traordinary shooting rather
than bad Card defense, ac
counted for Davis' and Dosty's
destruction.
"We were in their faces when
they shot; they just made
them," the coach said. "We just
have to hope they don't shoot as
well (on Saturday) as they did
up here. They were possessed
that evening."
One could say that the Cards
must have been possessed to
beat UCLA. Dißiaso, however,
offered a simple explanation.
"Everybody played well — all
five starters. The four guys off
the bench, although they didn't
contribute statistically, came in
and helped us also."
Contrast this with other
games, about which Dißiaso
said, "four of the five starters
might play well, and we won't
get that big a boost from the
bench. . .or maybe all five
starters will play well, but we'll
make a couple of mistakes."
