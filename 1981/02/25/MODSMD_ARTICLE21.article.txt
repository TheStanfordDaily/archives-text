## Cards, rain kill Fresno Bulldogs 
### Ralph Walker 
Thanks to the timely hitting
of Phil Wilson and Dave Meier
and the cooperation of some
clouds, the fifth-ranked Stan
ford baseball team improved its
record to 12-3 yesterday by de
feating the Fresno State Bull
dogs, 3-2.
The game, which began at
Sunken Diamond under rela
tively clear but ominous skies,
was called after two hours by
umpire Jim Cuneo.
Stanford took an early lead in
the second inning, initiated by
Darryl Stephens' lead-off sin
gle. Stephens moved to third on
an errant pick-off attempt by
FSU pitcher Mike Evans and
stole home two outs later, giv
ing the Cards a 1-0 advantage.
The Bulldogs retaliated with
two runs in the fifth, culminated
by leftfielder Ray O'Eauto's
two-out double.
A 15 minute downpour in Stan
ford's half of the fifth subsided
just long enough to allow the
Cards to regain the lead before
the mandatory five innings were
completed.
With one out and the bases
empty, Mike Dotterer singled
and was promptly doubled home
by Phil Wilson to tie the score at
two-all. Shortstop Dave Meier
then gave Stanford the lead,
driving in Wilson with a two-out
single.
Fresno State failed to score in
the sixth after a second 15
minute delay, and when a
steady rain appeared for the

third time in the bottom of the
inning, the game was finally
called.
Pitchers Brian Mignano and
Brian Myers combined for a
five-hitter with Myers getting
the win. Mignano allowed only
one hit in three innings while
walking and striking out one
each.
The win had to please Stan
ford head coach Mark Mar
quess, whose club was only able
to pick up one victory against
two defeats at the hands of San
Jose State last weekend.
In the first game, played last
Friday, the Spartans took the
Cardinals apart, exploding for a
13-run fifth inning en route to a
convincing 15-4 win. The first
game of Saturday's twinbill
again belonged to San Jose State
as they scored six runs in the
first four innings against Paul
Grame and coasted to a 7-3 vic
tory. Stanford gained revenge in
the nightcap, however, receiv
ing a strong pitching per
formance from Steve Cottrell.
The freshman from Northridge
went the distance against tne
Sparts, giving up only six hits on
his way to 4-2 win. Dotterer pro
vided some offensive punch,
going two-for-four with a
double.
The Cards will now travel to
Fullerton for a three-game
series against second-ranked
Fullerton State, with the first
contest slated for Friday night
and then a doubleheader on Sat
urday.
