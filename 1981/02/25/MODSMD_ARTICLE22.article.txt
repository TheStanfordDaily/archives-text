# Double OT heartbreaker
## Cagers fall to USF 
### Bill Beyda 
Four . . . three . . . it's up, it's
good . . . two . . . one . . . it's
over. The USF Lady Dons de
feated the Stanford women's
basketball team 79-78 in double
overtime with a shot in the clos
ing seconds Dotty McCrea sig
naled in vain for a time out, but
the officials seemed anxious to
get home. The clock ran out, and
so did the refs, not even allowing
argument.
"The referees were awful,"
said Dons head coach Jan
Ternyik. Stanford head coach
Dotty McCrea was especially
critical of the refer
ees performance in the closing
seconds, when a steal from Debi
Gore gave USF the ball."That
should have been a foul, but
their were 49 minutes of basket
ball before that; the difference
was our free throw shooting,"
McCrea said.
McCrea was referring to two
clutch free throw opportunities
the Cards missed, one to send
them into the second overtime,
and the second to provide the
victory margin for USF.
"Both teams performed their
hearts out,"McCrea said. The
Cards made an amazing come
back to send the game to over
time. Down 63-55 with 1:20 left
in regulation time, the Cards
scored eight unanswered points.
Referees have been a prob
lem in the NorCal Conference
this year, and this is not the first
time they have been a major

topic of post-game conversa
tion Ternyik said, "Every week
I write another complaint let
ter, and I'll have to do it again
this week. "
The Cards were led by Kim
Kupferer, who scored 26 points
and rebounded 14, followed by
Ann Miller with 17 points.
"I told them there's no place
to go but up," McCrea said.
"This team has arrived."
The Cards' overall record in
now 14-15, and their NorCal Con
ference record drops to 4-6. The
Cards face Santa Clara on the
road Friday night, and finish up
the season at Maples Pavilion
against first place Cal next
Monday, March 7 at 7:30 p.m.
