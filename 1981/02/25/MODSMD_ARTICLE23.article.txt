Hayward (AP) — John

defensive lineman who drew a
$1000 fine for Super Bowl week

He was cited for possession of
a loaded weapon, a ,44-caliber
Magnum revolver, as well as

according to the Hayward po
lice report.
Matuszak's car was stopped

by police shortly before 11 p.m.,
and the report said the car had
been weaving back and forth
along Hesperian Boulevard. A

Sportfolio

woman passenger in the car was
not cited.
Matuszak was arrested after
refusing several times to sub
mit to a sobriety test, the police

report said, and four officers
were called to back up the ar
resting officer after the six-foot
seven, 260-pound football player
became abusive.
Last month in New Orleans,
Matuszak made a tour of French
Quarter bars until at least 3
a.m. four nights before the Su
per Bowl game and was fined
$1000 by Coach Tom Flores for
breaking the Raiders' 11 p.m.

a 27-10 victory over the Phila
delphia Eagles.

Tampa, Fla. (AP> — The Ma

meets here Wednesday to con
sider the next step in an esca
lating war between baseball
owners and the union over free
agent compensation.
Every indication is that the
players will set a strike date in
response to the move last week
by the owners to alter the free
agent reserve system.
Management wants clubs los
ing what it terms a "premier"
free agent to be compensated
with a professional player from
the free agent's new team. The
union claims that will place un

reasonable restriction on the
bargaining power of free
agents.
