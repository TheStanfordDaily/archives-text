# Netters rained out
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
One can only guess how many
home runs Hank Aaron didn't
hit in his 23 years as a major
league baseball player because
of rainouts. But it's safe to say
none was as big as the grand
slam Stanford's No. 1 tennis
star Tim Mayotte lost yester
day, when the Stanford-Univer
sity of San Diego match here
was rained out.
Mayotte devastated fellow
All-America Scott Lipton 6-0,6-0
in about an hour, on a cold and
blustery day that was not meant
for tennis.
The overall match was de
layed an hour after it began by a
downpour. San Diego could not
stay because of schedule prob
lems; the match will not be
made up.
It looked like it would have
been Stanford's third win in

three tries. Only one other
match was completed, No. 5
Andy Chase taking care of Pat
Rost in 45 minutes, 6-3, 6-3. The
Cardinals won the first sets of
the four remaining matches
before play was called off.
It was very clear that Lipton
was rusty, still recovering from
a pulled hip muscle. He hit few
shots that made it past the ser
vice court, and had little luck
with his first serve. "I had no
feeling. Everything was coming
up short," Lipton said. "It was
cruel and unusual punishment.
But I'll be back."
NOTES . . Yesterday's
scheduled women's match be
tween Cal and Stanford has been
reset for March 12 . . . Men's
starter Scott Bondurant tore a
penny-sized hole in his right
(playing) hand in a one-bike ac
cident Monday. It's not serious,
but he is sidelined for now.
