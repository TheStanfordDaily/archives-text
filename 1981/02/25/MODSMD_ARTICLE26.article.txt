If waxing your skis at 5 a.m.,
•tuffing the necessary woolens
tato your car, and packing in the
»kis with the vital six packs and
bottles of wine is usual prepara
tion for a weekend trip to Tahoe.
maybe you should consider a
more exciting alternative; The
Stanford Ski Club.
The club was created to or
ganize students and University
community members in the
hopes of promoting skiing in
general. The results have been
what anyone might expect given
the energy of 100 skiers.
Sponsoring excursions three
times a year during Thanksgiv
ing, Christmas and spring
breaks, the club experiences en
thusiastic downhill and hotdog
antics of students in places like
Colorado and Wyoming

The most recent trip was to
Utah in which 90 students took
part over the Thanksgiving
break. A spring break trip is
planned to include skiing at Sun
Valley. Idaho. All the action the
club deals with is not on the
slopes, however.
Open to interested students
anytime, the ub conducts
meetings tv month during
fall and wu uarters. Along
with busines> skiing movie is
usually showr. A $10 member
ship fee is required to join the
club for a year.
Some of the advantages of
membership in the ski club in
clude discounts on equipment at
local stores and reduced ski ren
tal fees.
When the club gets down to
business, seminars are offered

on new products, ski main
tenance and equipment tune
ups.
The trips to distant states are
not the only skiing trips which
club members enjoy. A ski
cabin is often rented by club
members during winter quar
ter. Extra space in the cabin is
then made available to Stanford
students for a nominal fee. The
club acts as a go-between in ren
ting the cabin and locating stu
dents who would enjoy staying
there over various winter week
ends.
So if you'd like to have a casu
al relationship with (and keep
up on the most recent ideas of)
I S. ski resorts, 100 enthusiastic
skiers, local ski shops and the
slopes of Tahoe. you ought to
look into the Stanford Ski Club
