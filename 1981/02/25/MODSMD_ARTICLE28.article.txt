## New boots, skis set the pace 
### Sarah Carrel 
This year, as every year,
the skiing industry has pro
duced several new items of
equipment that attest to con
stant technological improve
ments in the sport. A major
innovation, and a new "must
for the dedicated and fashion
conscious downhiller," is the
knee-high boot.
New on the market this
year, the boot serves several
purposes. First, it provides
extra power to the skier. This
results in sharper, more ac
curate turns, much like the
power steering of a car.
Secondly, the boot re
distributes the pressure that
the low boot concentrates
into a small area. The "sore
shin" syndrome that is often
synonymous with skiing is no
longer a problem with these
boots.
The one drawback to boot
is the extra time that must be
taken before the skier can be
come proficient with them.
In general, the recent inven
tion makes for a happier,
more skillful skier.
The only other major reno
vation of the seasion is the in
creasing manufacture of dif
ferent pieces of equipment
made especially to go togeth
er. For instance, the
Solomon boot is made specif
ically to be used with the
Solomon binding.
This "harmony of brands"
can make the skier more con
fident that his equipment
will work smoothly together,
producing in the end a more
harmonious and well-bal
anced skier.
Although the new inven
tions of the season may be
few. the advancement of
technology is constant as
usual. Most pronounced in
this area is the improvement
in custom-made boots. For
instance. Mike Mclnnis of
Ski Specialist, a shop in
Redwood City, speaks of
their staff as "ski doctors"
because in their fitting of
custom boots they make the
skier's comfort of primary
importance. The better the
boot fits, the happier the
"patient," the more profi
cient the skier, is their gen
eral philosophy.
Not to be forgotten, and
very much in the limelight
this year, is cross-country
skiing. At North Face, a Palo
Alto shop exclusively for the
sport, sales are steadily ris
ing.

"Ski mountaineering, " or
touring rugged areas for sev
eral days at a time, is show
ing explosive popularity.
This could be resulting from
the high expense of downhill
skiing when lift-ticket, motel
fees, and other varied ex
penses are combined. But
mountaineering, like any
sport, has its share of new of
improving equipment. Heav
ier boots and shoes are a ne
cessity for travelling for long
periods of time. Plate bind
ings also facilitate skiing
longer journeys.
The skis, though, are un
dergoing the greatest
changes. Many are being
made with an acrylic foam
core, such as the popular
Trucker Cross Country Ski.
Not only does this result in
lighter, more easily operated
skis, but it has brought the
price of skis down with the
the utilization of a cheaper
material.
In skiing, more so than
many sports, passing "fads"
are always evident. For in
stance, Vuarnet sunglasses
are the "in" brand at $60 per
pair. Among so-called "ski
bunnies" who frequent the
slopes, Hexcel skis are the
only correct brand.
In the apparel depart
ment, even underwear is sub
ject to improvement and
fads. Water-proof
polypropylene long-johns are
popular with the cross-coun
try skiers. With the downhill
set, angora long underwear
that can be folded to fit the
wallet seems a definite fad at
$100 per pair.
Fads and quality dif
ferences also surface in the
"battle of the brands," as
different ski manufacturers
struggle to be at the top of the
market. K-2s and Rossignols
seem to be dominating cur
rently, but those positions
are being threatened by the
rise of Yamahas and the old
favorites, Fishers.
The latest word as far as
style is concerned is that
long skis are back. Short skis
have been popular for the
past few years since they fa
cilitate skiing. But lately
skiers are realizing the
greater versatility, speed,
and power of long skis if
enough time is put into mas
tering them.
The recent "long ski"
trend seems to show that
skiers are taking their sport

more seriously, are willing
to put more time into it, and
as a result are becoming bet
ter skiers in general.
It seems that the lack of
snow this year would result
in less ski equipment sold,
yet this has not been the
case. Rhinehart Boost, an
employee at the Stanford
Shop, says that he can still
refer to his line of work as an
"explosive industry." Even
the number of equipment
rentals has been very prom
ising this year.
Pam Knightlinger of the
Palo Alto branch of Os
hman's admits that "the
sales do go by the snow," but
it doesn't take much snow for
enthusiastic skiers to quickly

escalate those sales. Greg
Olson Of Skis N' Such, a Los
Altos-based shop, notes that
cross country skiing is grow
ing in popularity, but he went
on to say that sales show that
this in no way takes away
from the national infatuation
with downhill. Many down
hill skiers are turning to
cross-country, but not giving
up downhill. As Olson puts it,
"Downhill will never die."
Mike Mclnnis of Ski Special
ists can sum up the ski equip
ment business with one line.
"As long there's snow, we're
going to sell stuff." Since the
future existence of snow
looks very bright, we can
certainly say the same for
the ski equipment business.

Not to be forgotten, and
very much in the limelight
this year, is cross-country
skiing. At North Face, a Palo
Alto shop exclusively for the
sport, sales are steadily ris
ing.

"Ski mountaineering, " or
touring rugged areas for sev
eral days at a time, is show
ing explosive popularity.
This could be resulting from
the high expense of downhill
skiing when lift-ticket, motel
fees, and other varied ex
penses are combined. But
mountaineering, like any
sport, has its share of new of
improving equipment. Heav
ier boots and shoes are a ne
cessity for travelling for long
periods of time. Plate bind
ings also facilitate skiing
longer journeys.
The skis, though, are un
dergoing the greatest
changes. Many are being
made with an acrylic foam
core, such as the popular
Trucker Cross Country Ski.
Not only does this result in
lighter, more easily operated
skis, but it has brought the
price of skis down with the
the utilization of a cheaper
material.
In skiing, more so than
many sports, passing "fads"
are always evident. For in
stance, Vuarnet sunglasses
are the "in" brand at $60 per
pair. Among so-called "ski
bunnies" who frequent the
slopes, Hexcel skis are the
only correct brand.
In the apparel depart
ment, even underwear is sub
ject to improvement and
fads. Water-proof
polypropylene long-johns are
popular with the cross-coun
try skiers. With the downhill
set, angora long underwear
that can be folded to fit the
wallet seems a definite fad at
$100 per pair.
Fads and quality dif
ferences also surface in the
"battle of the brands," as
different ski manufacturers
struggle to be at the top of the
market. K-2s and Rossignols
seem to be dominating cur
rently, but those positions
are being threatened by the
rise of Yamahas and the old
favorites, Fishers.
The latest word as far as
style is concerned is that
long skis are back. Short skis
have been popular for the
past few years since they fa
cilitate skiing. But lately
skiers are realizing the
greater versatility, speed,
and power of long skis if
enough time is put into mas
tering them.
The recent "long ski"
trend seems to show that
skiers are taking their sport

more seriously, are willing
to put more time into it, and
as a result are becoming bet
ter skiers in general.
It seems that the lack of
snow this year would result
in less ski equipment sold,
yet this has not been the
case. Rhinehart Boost, an
employee at the Stanford
Shop, says that he can still
refer to his line of work as an
"explosive industry." Even
the number of equipment
rentals has been very prom
ising this year.
Pam Knightlinger of the
Palo Alto branch of Os
hman's admits that "the
sales do go by the snow," but
it doesn't take much snow for
enthusiastic skiers to quickly

escalate those sales. Greg
Olson Of Skis N' Such, a Los
Altos-based shop, notes that
cross country skiing is grow
ing in popularity, but he went
on to say that sales show that
this in no way takes away
from the national infatuation
with downhill. Many down
hill skiers are turning to
cross-country, but not giving
up downhill. As Olson puts it,
"Downhill will never die."
Mike Mclnnis of Ski Special
ists can sum up the ski equip
ment business with one line.
"As long there's snow, we're
going to sell stuff." Since the
future existence of snow
looks very bright, we can
certainly say the same for
the ski equipment business.

A wide variety of ski equipment is available to suit the varied
tastes and poeketbooks of every ski enthusiast.
This year, as every year,
the skiing industry has pro
duced several new items of
equipment that attest to con
stant technological improve
ments in the sport. A major
innovation, and a new "must
for the dedicated and fashion
conscious downhiller," is the
knee-high boot.
New on the market this
year, the boot serves several
purposes. First, it provides
extra power to the skier. This
results in sharper, more ac
curate turns, much like the
power steering of a car.
Secondly, the boot re
distributes the pressure that
the low boot concentrates
into a small area. The "sore
shin" syndrome that is often
synonymous with skiing is no
longer a problem with these
boots.
The one drawback to boot
is the extra time that must be
taken before the skier can be
come proficient with them.
In general, the recent inven
tion makes for a happier,
more skillful skier.
The only other major reno
vation of the seasion is the in
creasing manufacture of dif
ferent pieces of equipment
made especially to go togeth
er. For instance, the
Solomon boot is made specif
ically to be used with the
Solomon binding.
This "harmony of brands"
can make the skier more con
fident that his equipment
will work smoothly together,
producing in the end a more
harmonious and well-bal
anced skier.
Although the new inven
tions of the season may be
few. the advancement of
technology is constant as
usual. Most pronounced in
this area is the improvement
in custom-made boots. For
instance. Mike Mclnnis of
Ski Specialist, a shop in
Redwood City, speaks of
their staff as "ski doctors"
because in their fitting of
custom boots they make the
skier's comfort of primary
importance. The better the
boot fits, the happier the
"patient," the more profi
cient the skier, is their gen
eral philosophy.
Not to be forgotten, and
very much in the limelight
this year, is cross-country
skiing. At North Face, a Palo
