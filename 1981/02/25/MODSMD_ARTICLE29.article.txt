# Ski team hits the slopes

Recent snows in the Sierras
have boosted the morale of Stan
ford Ski Team members. Train
ing and competition have
started and the team is looking
forward to a sucessful, although
somewhat shortened ski season.
This year participation and
enthusiasm have been "really
great," said coach Richy Ross,
a senior. "This is my first year
coaching the team, but com
pared to what I've heard, this
seems to be a more broadly
based team with lots of new
faces than in years past.
Members of the ski team have
been able to obtain "awesome
equipment deals" this year.
"The manufacturers give us
these deals because they feel
that the exposure is good for
their images," said Ross. Ex
tensive coaching and access to
the team's rental cabin in North
Lake Tahoe are two other bene
fits which team members enjoy.
The lack of snow in the
Sierras this year, however, has
caused problems for team
members. The team had sched
uled a training camp to be held
during Christmas break. But be
cause there was no snow at the
Tahoe Ski Bowl, the area where

the camp was to have been held,
the camp had to be cancelled.
"We (Mike Cuncan, a
sophomore and co-coach) had to
call 60 people up all over the
U.S. on Christmas Day to tell
them that the camp was can
celled. We just didn't anticipate
anything like this happening,"
said Ross. "We didn't reach ev
eryone on time. This one girl
was one her way back from Eng
land, literally in the air, before
we could get hold of her pa
rents."
Since December, the team's
morale has improved, though.
"We lost a lot of momentum
when we had to cancel the
camp. We'd been dry-land train
ing all fall to get in shape for the
camp. It was a real disappoint
ment. But things are back to
normal now," said Ross.
There have been two races
this year and already Stanford
siers are proving themselves.
UC-Davis sponsored a series of
races on the weekend of Febru
ary 7 in which the team partici
pated. In the men's giant slalom
Stanford skiers placed as high
as sth, while in the women's
gian slalom the lone Stanford
finisher, Liz Schermer placed

ninth.
In the cross country races
Stanford racers did "very, very
well," says Ross. Led by philos
ophy/food research major Rob
Lipton, the Stanford men's team
tied for third overall. The wom
en's team, led by Andrea Dew
ery finished second.
"The team has had a good
year so far," said Ross, "and I
think we've reached most of our
objectives." When asked what
those are, he replied, "we want
to foster a healthy, competitive
atmosphere for Stanford stu
dents to enjoy skiing competi
tion.
"Hell, we get these wide-eyed
freshman and these insouciant
Frenchmen graduate students
together up in our little cabin
and we have a great time. But at
10 p.m. the lights go out. We're
up here for a reason and ev
eryone knows it."
The team is entirely student
run and is supported by yearly
dues of $60 fee assessment mon
ey from the club sports council.
Although $60 dues "seem high''
just to join the 60-member
team, members are entitled to
use of the ski cabin and other
team benefits.


Cross-country skiing has grown in popularity over the past few years. Ski-touring clubs and cross coun
try races have been increasing in numbers as a result.
