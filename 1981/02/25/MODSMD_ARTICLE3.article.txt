fectly normal," according to Robert Hamrdla. as
sistant to the president for trustee affairs. Hamrdla
explained that it is common for trustees to serve
their maximum 10 year term and after stepping
down for at least one year to be reappointed. "It's
not unusual to have the board bring someone back
in." said Hamrdla.
Both Kennedy and Joel Smith, vice-president of
the Office of Development, commented on the
trustees' emphatic commitment to consideration of
women and minority candidates for these positions.
"We're anxious to improve representation of
women and minorities on the board," said Kennedy
explaining that a "variety of needs" are considered
in selecting new members.
Both new trustees will serve five-year terms.
Their selection brings the total membership of the
board to 32. Its maximum size is 35.
