# Atty. general sees rise in ski thefts
## 
### Kevin Jones 
The California Attorney General's Office
has announced that it expects a rise of as
much as 20 percent in ski equipment thefts
this season from the state's more than two
dozen fully equipped ski resorts.
The estimate is based on recent survey
results of local law enforcement agencies in
California's major ski areas. During peak
periods of the season, more than 100,000 per
sons commonly share the slopes of the High
Sierras.
A report issued by George Deukmejian.
the state attorney general, said ski theft re
covery rates are expected to rise very little
above the current rate of zero to 1 percent.
The report attributes this low rate in large
part, to the failure of skiers to anticipate
thefts and take the necessary precautions.
This failure is quite costly. Theft losses in
the western United States alone are esti

matd at $2.18 million, while replacement
costs run at least 25 percent higher. In order
to deter such thefts, the Attorney General
suggests the follow Ski Theft Prevention
Practices:
Record you ski manufacturer's serial
numbers and save your purchase receipts;
Engrave all skis and ski equipment with
your driver's license number;
Never leave skis or ski equipment unat
tended, even for a moment;
Always use ski lockers and racks;
Purchase and use ski locks when lockers
and racks are not available.
Invest in a good lock for your automobile
ski rack;
Help protect your fellow skiers by report
ing suspicious persons around ski racks,
lockers, and unattended skis; and
Remove skis from racks on parked vehi
cles and from inside the car.
To further help reduce ski thefts, the De

partment of Justice and the Sierra Ski Areas *
Association recently began California Ski
Watch, part of the State's Crime Watch pro- ,J
gram. A primary component of the program
is a reward of $100 to be paid to anyone pro
viding reliable information leading to the
arrest and conviction of any ski equipment
thief in the state.
The program also calls for the distribu- *
tion of Ski Watch file cards, on which one
may register ski equipment for fast and ac
curate identification in case of theft. The**
cards are available through individual
members of the Sierra Ski Areas Associa-'.'
tion.
By increasing skier awareness of the o
Eroblem of ski and ski equipment theft, the
•epartment of Justice hopes to prompt the
eventual reduction of these crimes, making
ski holidays less costly and much more en
joyable.
