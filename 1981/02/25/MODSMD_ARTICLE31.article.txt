Reagan asserts limited U.S. role
Washington — President Ronald Reagan said yesterday
that he has "no intention" of getting the United States in
volved in El Salvador as it was in Vietnam.
Reagan spoke as the Department of Defense disclosed
that the administration is considering a proposal by Pen
tagon planners to send more U.S. military advisers to El
Salvador to help train that tiny Central American nation's
army.
The president, speaking at an impromptu news con
ference, said he realized there was "great concern" that
the United States might become embroiled in El Salvador
if U.S. advisers were sent there in great numbers.
There now are 19 U.S. Army specialists in El Salvador,
most of them training Salvadorans to maintain and fly six
U.S.-supplied helicopters, the Department of Defense
said.
There was one report yesterday that the United States
may send up to 50 advisers to El Salvador, but a Pentagon
spokesman said no figure had been decided upon and. in
any case, the Americans would not be assigned to field
duty with Salvadoran units fighting leftist insurgents
Reagan also reacted publicly for the first time to Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev's proposal Monday for a sum
mit conference. He linked any favorable U.S. response, in
part, to an end to arms shipments by the Soviets to the
Salvadoran guerrillas.
Poland seeks 'independent' solution
Moscow — Polish Communist leader Stanislaw Kania
told the Soviet Union's 26th Communist Party Congress
yesterday that his country could solve its political and eco
nomic problems "independently." European Comfriunist
sources said.
Kania. who heard Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev
on Monday bluntly invoke the possibility of intervention.

reaffirmed Poland's ties to the Soviet Union but appeared
in veiled terms to warn against the use of force in extend
ing "fraternal assistance'' to Warsaw
Kama was said to have "thanked the Soviet people for
their confidence that Poland will be able to solve its prob
lems independently" and to have assured the Congress
that the Polish Communist Party possesses the
"willpower and the strength to prevent counter-revolu
tion."
On Monday, using language that Western diplomats said
would be considered alarming and even inflammatory by
Soviet allies. Brezhnev warned that the "pillers of the so
cialist state in Poland are in jeopardy." He conspicuously
avoided praising the Polish party or mentioning Kania by
name
"We will not abandon fraternal socialist Poland in its
hour of need, we will stick up for it." Brezhnev said
Kania. in turn, appeared to suggest that there were limits
to the fraternal help that Poland wanted
In other respects. Kania's remarks were consistent with
Moscow's conception of Poland's problems. Communism.
Kania was reported to have said, was not at the root of Po
land's continuing difficulties
Rather, sources reported him as saying, the trouble
arose from a failure to abide by the norms of socialist gov
ernment. which brought about a "crisis within the party"
and a subsequent "wave of criticism being exploited by
people hostile to socialism. "
California sues over quarantine
Washington — California filed suit at the Supreme Court
yesterday, seeking to head off efforts by Texas to impose a
quarantine on California fruits and vegetables in an effort
to keep the Mediterranean fruit fly from crossing its
borders.
In papers filed with the court. California officials said
Texas's quarantine would impose a "severe burden" upon
California's $12 billion-a-year agricultural economy and
would have a "broad, adverse national impact."
California formally asked the justices to issue an injunc
tion preventing Texas from adopting the quarantine,
which is scheduled to take effect on Sunday.
The justices could act upon California's request when
they meet in their regular weekly conference on Friday.
The proposed quarantine, announced last week by Texas
Commissioner of Agriculture Reagan Brown, would bar
all produce from California that has not been either
treated by cold storage or fumigated with the chemicals
ethyl dibromide or methyl bromide.
The so-called "Medflv" infested parts of two counties in
Northern California last June. The fly can destroy crops,
causing infested fruits or vegetables to become mushy and
discolored.
California officials estimate that the Medfly has been
contained within a 50-square-mile core area. Together
with federal officials, they have quarantined a 500-square
mile area surrounding the region of infestation.
California contended in its lawsuit yesterday that Tex
as s quarantine program would amount to an unconstitu
tional burden on interstate commerce. The program "un
reasonably restricts the free flow of fruits and vegetables
from California that originate in areas beyond the quaran
tine areas established by California and the U. 5.," the
state argued.
Larger role for FBI in antidrug effort
Washington — FBI Director William Webster says U.S.
narcotics traffic is so large and violent that the FBI must

take a bigger role in attacking it, an idea that J Edgar
Hoover resisted tooth and nail.
"The federal government has to take a hard look at its
effectiveness in drug enforcement," Webster said in an in
terview on his third anniversary as FBI director. "Vast
amounts of drugs are coming in from outside the country,
overwhelming the resources of Customs and the Drug En
forcement Administration "
"I'm coming to believe that the problem is so large the
FBI must take a heavier role in it," Webster said
Hoover, who ran the bureau from 1924 to 1972, continual
ly beat back congressional efforts to thrust drug enforce
ment on his agents.
Privately, FBI officials in the Hoover era said they
lacked the undercover experience necessary for narcotics
work And the huge sums of cash involved in the trade
lured even some federal drug agents into corruption,
which Hoover had managed to avoid among his agents.
But in the last five years, the FBI has developed an ex
pertise in undercover work seen most recently in its
Abscam investigation of congressional corruption and its
nationwide probe of organized crime control over porno
graphy. "We came late to the field, but we caught up
quickly," said Assistant FBI Director Charles Monroe in a
recent interview.
Prince Charles announces wedding
London — Prince Charles, heir to Britain's throne, will
end his bachelorhood this summer, marrying "girl next
door" Lady Diana Spencer — 12 years his junior and whose
older sister was one of his girlfriends.
The Buckingham Palace announcement of the couple's
engagement was issued through the Press Association.
Britain's domestic news agency, yesterday.
It ended months of speculation that the discreet and de
mure 19-year-old kindergarten teacher — his 16th cousin
once removed and herself of royal descent — had captured
the 32-vear-old prince's heart and would eventually be
come the Princess of Wales.
The couple made their first appearance after the an
nouncement in the palace gardens, laughing, strolling
arm-in-arm. Prince Charles hugged Lady Diana as she
showed off her engagement ring to photographers.

Lady Diana, dubbed "Shy Di" by the popular press, first
caught Charles' eye as "a splendid 16-year-old," in 1977,
Press Association reporter Grania Forbes quoted him as
saying during a palace interview yesterday with the cou
ple
Although Lady Diana grew up on the Spencer family es
tate in Norfolk county next to the royal family's Sand
ringham residence, neither she or Charles remembered
really meeting until 1977, Ms. Forbes said she was told.
"Charles came for a pheasant shoot He was really a
friend of my sister, Lady Sarah, then," the bride-to-be was
quoted saying.
"I remember thinking what fun she was," Prince
Charles was reported to have added of Lady Diana.
In 1979. Lady Sarah Spencer announced she did not love
the prince, a statement considered somewhat of a gaffe
but not as shocking to the British public as some of the can
did statements his previous ladies made. That romance
quickly cooled and the prince saw increasingly more of
Lady Diana.
By last July, the prince said, "we began to realize there
was something in it," Ms. Forbes quoted the prince
saying.

Washington — President Ronald Reagan said yesterday
that he has "no intention" of getting the United States in
volved in El Salvador as it was in Vietnam.
Reagan spoke as the Department of Defense disclosed
that the administration is considering a proposal by Pen
tagon planners to send more U.S. military advisers to El
Salvador to help train that tiny Central American nation's
army.
The president, speaking at an impromptu news con
ference, said he realized there was "great concern" that
the United States might become embroiled in El Salvador
if U.S. advisers were sent there in great numbers.
There now are 19 U.S. Army specialists in El Salvador,
most of them training Salvadorans to maintain and fly six
U.S.-supplied helicopters, the Department of Defense
said.
There was one report yesterday that the United States
may send up to 50 advisers to El Salvador, but a Pentagon
spokesman said no figure had been decided upon and. in
any case, the Americans would not be assigned to field
duty with Salvadoran units fighting leftist insurgents
Reagan also reacted publicly for the first time to Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev's proposal Monday for a sum
mit conference. He linked any favorable U.S. response, in
part, to an end to arms shipments by the Soviets to the
Salvadoran guerrillas.
Poland seeks 'independent' solution
Moscow — Polish Communist leader Stanislaw Kania
told the Soviet Union's 26th Communist Party Congress
yesterday that his country could solve its political and eco
nomic problems "independently." European Comfriunist
sources said.
Kania. who heard Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev
on Monday bluntly invoke the possibility of intervention.

reaffirmed Poland's ties to the Soviet Union but appeared
in veiled terms to warn against the use of force in extend
ing "fraternal assistance'' to Warsaw
Kama was said to have "thanked the Soviet people for
their confidence that Poland will be able to solve its prob
lems independently" and to have assured the Congress
that the Polish Communist Party possesses the
"willpower and the strength to prevent counter-revolu
tion."
On Monday, using language that Western diplomats said
would be considered alarming and even inflammatory by
Soviet allies. Brezhnev warned that the "pillers of the so
cialist state in Poland are in jeopardy." He conspicuously
avoided praising the Polish party or mentioning Kania by
name
"We will not abandon fraternal socialist Poland in its
hour of need, we will stick up for it." Brezhnev said
Kania. in turn, appeared to suggest that there were limits
to the fraternal help that Poland wanted
In other respects. Kania's remarks were consistent with
Moscow's conception of Poland's problems. Communism.
Kania was reported to have said, was not at the root of Po
land's continuing difficulties
Rather, sources reported him as saying, the trouble
arose from a failure to abide by the norms of socialist gov
ernment. which brought about a "crisis within the party"
and a subsequent "wave of criticism being exploited by
people hostile to socialism. "
California sues over quarantine
Washington — California filed suit at the Supreme Court
yesterday, seeking to head off efforts by Texas to impose a
quarantine on California fruits and vegetables in an effort
to keep the Mediterranean fruit fly from crossing its
borders.
In papers filed with the court. California officials said
Texas's quarantine would impose a "severe burden" upon
California's $12 billion-a-year agricultural economy and
would have a "broad, adverse national impact."
California formally asked the justices to issue an injunc
tion preventing Texas from adopting the quarantine,
which is scheduled to take effect on Sunday.
The justices could act upon California's request when
they meet in their regular weekly conference on Friday.
The proposed quarantine, announced last week by Texas
Commissioner of Agriculture Reagan Brown, would bar
all produce from California that has not been either
treated by cold storage or fumigated with the chemicals
ethyl dibromide or methyl bromide.
The so-called "Medflv" infested parts of two counties in
Northern California last June. The fly can destroy crops,
causing infested fruits or vegetables to become mushy and
discolored.
California officials estimate that the Medfly has been
contained within a 50-square-mile core area. Together
with federal officials, they have quarantined a 500-square
mile area surrounding the region of infestation.
California contended in its lawsuit yesterday that Tex
as s quarantine program would amount to an unconstitu
tional burden on interstate commerce. The program "un
reasonably restricts the free flow of fruits and vegetables
from California that originate in areas beyond the quaran
tine areas established by California and the U. 5.," the
state argued.
Larger role for FBI in antidrug effort
Washington — FBI Director William Webster says U.S.
narcotics traffic is so large and violent that the FBI must

take a bigger role in attacking it, an idea that J Edgar
Hoover resisted tooth and nail.
"The federal government has to take a hard look at its
effectiveness in drug enforcement," Webster said in an in
terview on his third anniversary as FBI director. "Vast
amounts of drugs are coming in from outside the country,
overwhelming the resources of Customs and the Drug En
forcement Administration "
"I'm coming to believe that the problem is so large the
FBI must take a heavier role in it," Webster said
Hoover, who ran the bureau from 1924 to 1972, continual
ly beat back congressional efforts to thrust drug enforce
ment on his agents.
Privately, FBI officials in the Hoover era said they
lacked the undercover experience necessary for narcotics
work And the huge sums of cash involved in the trade
lured even some federal drug agents into corruption,
which Hoover had managed to avoid among his agents.
But in the last five years, the FBI has developed an ex
pertise in undercover work seen most recently in its
Abscam investigation of congressional corruption and its
nationwide probe of organized crime control over porno
graphy. "We came late to the field, but we caught up
quickly," said Assistant FBI Director Charles Monroe in a
recent interview.

door" Lady Diana Spencer — 12 years his junior and whose
older sister was one of his girlfriends.

come the Princess of Wales.

nouncement in the palace gardens, laughing, strolling

caught Charles' eye as "a splendid 16-year-old," in 1977,
Press Association reporter Grania Forbes quoted him as
saying during a palace interview yesterday with the cou
ple
Although Lady Diana grew up on the Spencer family es
tate in Norfolk county next to the royal family's Sand
ringham residence, neither she or Charles remembered
really meeting until 1977, Ms. Forbes said she was told.

did statements his previous ladies made. That romance
quickly cooled and the prince saw increasingly more of
Lady Diana.
By last July, the prince said, "we began to realize there
was something in it," Ms. Forbes quoted the prince
saying.

California sues over quarantine
Washington — California filed suit at the Supreme Court
yesterday, seeking to head off efforts by Texas to impose a
quarantine on California fruits and vegetables in an effort
to keep the Mediterranean fruit fly from crossing its
borders.
In papers filed with the court. California officials said
Texas's quarantine would impose a "severe burden" upon
California's $12 billion-a-year agricultural economy and
would have a "broad, adverse national impact."
California formally asked the justices to issue an injunc
tion preventing Texas from adopting the quarantine,
which is scheduled to take effect on Sunday.
The justices could act upon California's request when
they meet in their regular weekly conference on Friday.
The proposed quarantine, announced last week by Texas
Commissioner of Agriculture Reagan Brown, would bar
all produce from California that has not been either
treated by cold storage or fumigated with the chemicals
ethyl dibromide or methyl bromide.
The so-called "Medflv" infested parts of two counties in
Northern California last June. The fly can destroy crops,
causing infested fruits or vegetables to become mushy and
discolored.
California officials estimate that the Medfly has been
contained within a 50-square-mile core area. Together
with federal officials, they have quarantined a 500-square
mile area surrounding the region of infestation.
California contended in its lawsuit yesterday that Tex
as s quarantine program would amount to an unconstitu
tional burden on interstate commerce. The program "un
reasonably restricts the free flow of fruits and vegetables
from California that originate in areas beyond the quaran
tine areas established by California and the U. 5.," the
state argued.
Larger role for FBI in antidrug effort
Washington — FBI Director William Webster says U.S.
narcotics traffic is so large and violent that the FBI must

take a bigger role in attacking it, an idea that J Edgar
Hoover resisted tooth and nail.
"The federal government has to take a hard look at its
effectiveness in drug enforcement," Webster said in an in
terview on his third anniversary as FBI director. "Vast
amounts of drugs are coming in from outside the country,
overwhelming the resources of Customs and the Drug En
forcement Administration "
"I'm coming to believe that the problem is so large the
FBI must take a heavier role in it," Webster said
Hoover, who ran the bureau from 1924 to 1972, continual
ly beat back congressional efforts to thrust drug enforce
ment on his agents.
Privately, FBI officials in the Hoover era said they
lacked the undercover experience necessary for narcotics
work And the huge sums of cash involved in the trade
lured even some federal drug agents into corruption,
which Hoover had managed to avoid among his agents.
But in the last five years, the FBI has developed an ex
pertise in undercover work seen most recently in its
Abscam investigation of congressional corruption and its
nationwide probe of organized crime control over porno
graphy. "We came late to the field, but we caught up
quickly," said Assistant FBI Director Charles Monroe in a
recent interview.

saying during a palace interview yesterday with the cou
ple
Although Lady Diana grew up on the Spencer family es
tate in Norfolk county next to the royal family's Sand
ringham residence, neither she or Charles remembered
