# British pick Taylor for health education
## 
### Philip Eure 
Dr. Keith Taylor, Barnett Professor
of Medicine at the Medical School, has
been named to head Great Britain's
health education body, the Daily has
learned.
According to Taylor, who will take
over as Director General of the Health
Education Council on July 1, his task
will be to "encourage the people of the
United Kingdom to take better care of
themselves."
The appointment, which was an
nounced in Great Britain last Tues
day, was made by the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Social Ser
vices, which is equivalent to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human
Services.

At a salary of $60,000, Taylor will
oversee an estimated $14 million oper
ating budget.
According to a report printed in the
London Times last week, Taylor's
predecessor, Alastair Mackie, has de
cided to step down "after disagree
ment with some council members."
Mackie held the post for the past eight
years. Reportedly, he launched an un
popular anti-smoking campaign which
depicted nude, pregnant woman and
asked "Is it fair to ask your baby to
smoke?"
Although Taylor, a nutrition expert,
was appointed to the post by the Brit
ish government, the official status of
the council falls into the category of
QUANGO, an acronym meaning
Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmen
tal Organization.
As a semi-independant body, the
council is charged with persuading the
British government to implement its
policy recommendations, and urging
the public to undertake preventive
health care measures, said Taylor.
Taylor pointed out that as a govern
ment appointed body, the Health
Education Body is "politically sensi
tive." Hence, the 56 year-old Taylor,
who has asked the University for a
leave of absence, will assume the Di
rector General position for a two-year
term.
Specifically, the Medical School
professor said he wants the British
public to become more receptive
towards preventive health care. "I
hope to get some movement towards
changing the health habits of the
Britsh population, which in the past,
has resented such advice," Taylor
commented.
Taylor cited statistics which show
that tobacco consumption among
males has increased in Great Britain,
whereas in the United States,
cigarette smoking has begun to level
off. He also pointed out that exercise
and certain aspects of food consump
tion should be a "life-long concern" of
everyone.

behind at the moment," Taylor added.
Taylor also expressed concern for
the plight of Britain's laboring
classes. Because of their low levels of
education, the poor's quality of life is
most adversely affected, he ex
plained Taylor suggested that under
his leadership, the Health Education
Council would make a greater effort to
inform the lower income classes of
preventive health care options open to
them.
Taylor said that he will propose that
"financial carrots" be used to en
courage the British to take better care
of themselves. As an example, Taylor
suggested that the government could
bestow benefits upon a family by low
ering its comprehensive health care
package if that family agreed to at
tend preventive medicine classes.ln
the long-run, this would keep the costs
of therapeutic medicine down, Taylor
noted.
