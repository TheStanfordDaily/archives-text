# Panel discusses Honor Code
## Faculty responsibility related; methods noted for handling problems 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
"The only decent relation between students and teach
ers is one where honesty is preserved," and the Honor
Code is designed to protect this relationship. Ombudsman
John Goheen said yesterday at a panel discussion on the
code.
Panel members Sally Cole, director of research for the
dean of student affairs office. Mark Conroe, graduate stu
dent and chairman of the Honor Code Commission. Roger
Lewis, physics teaching assistant, and Goheen discussed
the Honor Code and its implications for the faculty.
Cole said that at the end of her 1980 Honor Code survey,
students commented on teaching practices they believe
encourage cheating. These include over-crowded exam
rooms, complicated or confusing instructions, and posting
exam answers outside the exam-room door while the test
is going on. "I hope that teaching practices that cause
problems will disappear if it is known that they are prob
lems," she said.
The responsibility of the faculty under the Honor Code
has been questioned in the Honor Code Commission's dis
cussions, but the Stanford community has not yet reached
a consensus. Goheen said President Donald Kennedy in
sists that the faculty is not technically bound by the honor
code, but they are bound by the spirit of it.
Faculty responsible
"There is general recognition that the faculty is respon
sible to the honor code. The faculty senate has never ac
cepted it as legally binding, but has agreed to abide by and
honor it," Goheen said.
Goheen said his interpretation is that "the faculty con
siders the Honor Code an undertaking of the students and
is willing to support them in following the code, but is not
willing to be bound by it."
Thus students have no official recourse under the Honor
Code against faculty members who deliberately proctor
exams, Goheen said.
Lack of faculty compliance
A lack of faculty compliance with the Honor Code may
be due in part to the fact that Stanford has many transient
professors who come from other schools and are not famil
iar with the honor code, Goheen said.
There is no systematic procedure to instruct the faculty
about the honor code, he said.
However, "the information is there and easy to find,"

Cole added.
Another disputed section of the Honor Code is the third
party responsibility clause. "Nowhere in the code does it
say that students must report other students they see
cheating. It says students must do something,' " Cole said.
Incidents of cheating
She said that in survey, many students indicated they
had heard of incidents of cheating, but few had actually
seem it themselves. "I think there is more adherence to
the spirit of the code than conversation out there would im
ply," Cole said.
In the survey only 20 percent of the students said they
would report cheating to an authority, but 75 percent said
they would "do something." "Often peer control is more
effective than authority control anyhow," Cole added.
Comparing the 1961 and 1980 surveys, Cole said: "There
is surprisingly little change in the number of students who
admitted to having cheated." And a 1961 survey showed
that schools without honor codes have more cheating.
Cheating not non-existant
But this does not mean that cheating at Stanford is non
existent Conroe said that there are 14 to 17 cases each
year of students found violating the Honor Code. He said
the maximum and usual penalty is one-quarter suspension
from the University.
Students in the audience pointed out that parts of the
Honor Code are ambiguous.
One student said that in two cases last quarter, the tests
from past quarters which he used to study for an exam
turned out to be the same tests he was given. He said
he felt guilty, but was unsure of what to do.
Goheen and Cole agreed that he had not violated the
Honor Code in any way but that the issue was the responsi
bility of the professor. Goheen recommended telling the
department chairman and letting him confront the pro
fessor.
Another example of conflicting interest. Lewis pointed
out. is that in his physics class of 200 to 300 there are usual
ly 20 to 30 students who bring up questions during a 50-
minute exam Out of concern for students not using valu
able time to seek out the instructor, Lewis said the
teaching assistants and the professor sit in the front of the
room with their backs to the students and read a book.
That way they are there to answer questions, but are not
proctoring in the sense of watching for cheating.

Another disputed section of the Honor Code is the third
party responsibility clause. "Nowhere in the code does it
say that students must report other students they see
cheating. It says students must do something,' " Cole said.
Incidents of cheating
She said that in survey, many students indicated they
had heard of incidents of cheating, but few had actually
seem it themselves. "I think there is more adherence to
the spirit of the code than conversation out there would im
ply," Cole said.
In the survey only 20 percent of the students said they
would report cheating to an authority, but 75 percent said
they would "do something." "Often peer control is more
effective than authority control anyhow," Cole added.
Comparing the 1961 and 1980 surveys, Cole said: "There
is surprisingly little change in the number of students who
admitted to having cheated." And a 1961 survey showed
that schools without honor codes have more cheating.
Cheating not non-existant
But this does not mean that cheating at Stanford is non
existent Conroe said that there are 14 to 17 cases each
year of students found violating the Honor Code. He said
the maximum and usual penalty is one-quarter suspension
from the University.
Students in the audience pointed out that parts of the
Honor Code are ambiguous.
One student said that in two cases last quarter, the tests
from past quarters which he used to study for an exam
turned out to be the same tests he was given. He said
he felt guilty, but was unsure of what to do.
Goheen and Cole agreed that he had not violated the
Honor Code in any way but that the issue was the responsi
bility of the professor. Goheen recommended telling the
department chairman and letting him confront the pro
fessor.
Another example of conflicting interest. Lewis pointed
out. is that in his physics class of 200 to 300 there are usual
ly 20 to 30 students who bring up questions during a 50-
minute exam Out of concern for students not using valu
able time to seek out the instructor, Lewis said the
teaching assistants and the professor sit in the front of the
room with their backs to the students and read a book.
That way they are there to answer questions, but are not
proctoring in the sense of watching for cheating.
"The only decent relation between students and teach
ers is one where honesty is preserved," and the Honor
Code is designed to protect this relationship. Ombudsman
John Goheen said yesterday at a panel discussion on the
code.
Panel members Sally Cole, director of research for the
dean of student affairs office. Mark Conroe, graduate stu
dent and chairman of the Honor Code Commission. Roger
Lewis, physics teaching assistant, and Goheen discussed
the Honor Code and its implications for the faculty.
Cole said that at the end of her 1980 Honor Code survey,
students commented on teaching practices they believe
encourage cheating. These include over-crowded exam
rooms, complicated or confusing instructions, and posting
exam answers outside the exam-room door while the test
is going on. "I hope that teaching practices that cause
problems will disappear if it is known that they are prob
lems," she said.
The responsibility of the faculty under the Honor Code
has been questioned in the Honor Code Commission's dis
cussions, but the Stanford community has not yet reached
a consensus. Goheen said President Donald Kennedy in
sists that the faculty is not technically bound by the honor
code, but they are bound by the spirit of it.
Faculty responsible
"There is general recognition that the faculty is respon
sible to the honor code. The faculty senate has never ac
cepted it as legally binding, but has agreed to abide by and
honor it," Goheen said.
Goheen said his interpretation is that "the faculty con
siders the Honor Code an undertaking of the students and
is willing to support them in following the code, but is not
willing to be bound by it."
Thus students have no official recourse under the Honor
Code against faculty members who deliberately proctor
exams, Goheen said.
Lack of faculty compliance
A lack of faculty compliance with the Honor Code may
be due in part to the fact that Stanford has many transient
professors who come from other schools and are not famil
iar with the honor code, Goheen said.
There is no systematic procedure to instruct the faculty
about the honor code, he said.
However, "the information is there and easy to find,"

Cole added.
