1 Genetic engineering. For
some the term conjures up im
ages of white-coated scientists
hovering over Frankensteinian
brews, tinkering with the very
basis of life. Others may think of
The Hoys From Brazil or the
creation of a master race by a
mad genius. Right? Wrong.
; Broadly-speaking, genetic en
gineering is simply the prac
tical application of genetics, the
science of heredity. But that
definition includes everything
from genetic counseling of pros
pective parents to fertility con
trol, genetic diagnosis of a fetus
to external fertilization ("test
tube babies"), eugenics (im
proving the quality of a race) to
the environmental factors af
fecting heredity.
* Today the term is most often
associated with the direct ma
nipulation of DNA, the struc
tural molecule containing the
hereditary information in all
living cells. Through a variety
of complex techniques, specific
pieces of DNA from nearly any
organism can be isolated and in
serted into bacterial cells.
The bacteria is fooled into
thinking that the foreign DNA is
part of its own genes, so that
when it reproduces, it makes a
copy of the inserted genes as
well. Such "recombinant" bac
teria can be cultured to produce
a colony of genetically identical
offspring called "clones."
In this way, specific se
quences of DNA from viruses,
other bacteria, plants, and
animals can be magnified and
obtained in relatively large
quantities from easily grown
bacteria. This isolation of a
gene from its original cell per
mits study of that gene's ex
pression, regulation, and
chemical structure.
Genes can also be recom
bined into cells of higher or
ganisms and raised in tissue cul
ture. Geneticists hope that stud

ies using this technique may
eventually lead to an under
standing of why, in cancer cells,
the regulation of genetic ex
pression goes haywire.
But scientists emphasize that
most genetic engineering is still
working at the level of basic re
search. However, one promis
ing medical application in
volves the development of bac
teria able to make large, cheap
quantities of proteins used in the
treatment of some human dis
eases.
Such "bacteria factories" ex
ploit the fact that all living cells
synthesize proteins according to
the information coded in their
DNA. First the gene coding for
the desired protein must be
identified and a workable copy
of it obtained. Then it must be
cloned so that the bacteria's
cellular machinery is tricked
into "reading" the foreign gene
and producing the proper pro
tein.

Recently scientists at
Harvard succeeded in making
bacteria manufacture a pre
cursor to insulin, a hormone
used to treat diabetes, and cur
rently a precursor to insulin, a
hormone used to treat diabetes
and currently extracted from
the tissues of other animals.
Biologists in Switzerland have
persuaded bacteria to produce
human interferon, a molecule
with anti-viral properties which
may be effective against some
cancers. Vaccines against viral
and parasitic infections may
someday be safely made by bac
teria factories, eliminating the
current need to grow the disease
organism in disturbingly large
quantities.
It is a major jump from these

techniques to the introduction of
genes into intact higher or
ganisms. Though genetic in
tervention in an individual to re
place a defect in a single gene
may be possible someday, there
are major theoretical and tech
nical obstacles at present.
And it is an even larger step
from here to making heritable
changes in higher organisms.
Currently, the use of recombi
nant-DNA techniques to modify
plant and animal heredity is
only science fiction. The rather
fuzzy relationship between a
"gene" and a "genetic charac
ter" in higher organisms stands
in the way, as well as technical
problems in altering the genetic
material of germ-line cells.
Of course, applied genetics
without an understanding of the
molecular basis of it is nothing
new. Selective breeding to ob
tain domestic livestock began
as early as 10,000 B.C. in Egypt,
even though the basic rules gov-

t aecines and drugs may someday be made
by bacteria factories

erning the transmission of
heritable traits were not quan
titatively understood until
Mendel published his famous
experiments in 1865.
In the past century the sci
ence of plant and animal breed
ing has become more and more
sophisticated. Breakthroughs
have included improved live
stock strains, hybrid corn and
disease resistant wheat.
However some speculate that
genetic engineering of plants
may lead to important break
throughs. Ideas for introducing
genes to increase photsynthetic
efficiency, improve the
nutritive value of food plants,
and give higher plants the abili
ty to fix nitrogen from the air —
reducing the need for expensive

fertilizers — are all being con
sidered.
Other conceivable applica
tions involve developing micro
organisms to perform all sorts
of tasks, ranging from the effi
cient production of alcohol from
grain to the safe consumption of
industrial sludges, oil spills and
hazardous chemical wastes. But
the eventual benefits of genetic
engineering can only be guessed
at, and much basic research re
mains to be done before its true
potential can be known.
