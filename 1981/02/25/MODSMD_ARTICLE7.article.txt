# Research safety is still an issue

TY\e controversy over the
safety o! genetic engineering
continues in spite of the Su
preme Court decision last
spring that recombinant DNA
organisms can be patented.
Dr. Stanley Cohen, a
biochemist at Stanford Univer
sity, and Dr. Herbert Boyer, his
counterpart at the University of
San Fransico, were granted a
patent for gene-splicing last De
cember.
The controversy over recom
binant DNA research was first
made public when a group of sci
entists at the 1973 Gordon Re
search Conference on Nucleic
Acids published an open letter in
the widely read magazine Sci

ence. They urged the National
\cademv ol Scvence and the Na
tional Institute for Health
(NIH i to set up a study commit
tee to look into the risks and ben
fits of recombinant DNA re
search.
In response, the NIH set up
the Recombinant DNA
Molecular Program Advisory
Committee. Paul Berg, pro
fessor of Biochemistry at Stan
ford, was asked to head the com
mittee. ,
In 1974 this committee pro
prosed a general moratorium on
all recombinant DNA research,
to be vountarily observed by sci
entists until the risks and dan
gers were more fully in
vestigated and until an interna

tional conference on the subject
could he called.
In Febuary of 1975 the
Asilomar Conference was held
in Pacific Grove Califor
nia,after which it was decided
that the voluntary moratorium
would be lifted and guidelines
regulating genetic research
could be established.
Experiments involving toxic
substances such as snake and in
sect venom were banned, and
those in which the benefits out
weighed the risks were
catagorized according to the
risks. For example, recombi
nant DNA research was con
sidered more hazardous with
primate and animal viruses
