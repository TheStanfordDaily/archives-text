# Research safety is still an issue

### Alexi Assmus 
TY\e controversy over the
safety o! genetic engineering
continues in spite of the Su
preme Court decision last
spring that recombinant DNA
organisms can be patented.
Dr. Stanley Cohen, a
biochemist at Stanford Univer
sity, and Dr. Herbert Boyer, his
counterpart at the University of
San Fransico, were granted a
patent for gene-splicing last De
cember.
The controversy over recom
binant DNA research was first
made public when a group of sci
entists at the 1973 Gordon Re
search Conference on Nucleic
Acids published an open letter in
the widely read magazine Sci

ence. They urged the National
\cademv ol Scvence and the Na
tional Institute for Health
(NIH i to set up a study commit
tee to look into the risks and ben
fits of recombinant DNA re
search.
In response, the NIH set up
the Recombinant DNA
Molecular Program Advisory
Committee. Paul Berg, pro
fessor of Biochemistry at Stan
ford, was asked to head the com
mittee. ,
In 1974 this committee pro
prosed a general moratorium on
all recombinant DNA research,
to be vountarily observed by sci
entists until the risks and dan
gers were more fully in
vestigated and until an interna

tional conference on the subject
could he called.
In Febuary of 1975 the
Asilomar Conference was held
in Pacific Grove Califor
nia,after which it was decided
that the voluntary moratorium
would be lifted and guidelines
regulating genetic research
could be established.
Experiments involving toxic
substances such as snake and in
sect venom were banned, and
those in which the benefits out
weighed the risks were
catagorized according to the
risks. For example, recombi
nant DNA research was con
sidered more hazardous with
primate and animal viruses
than with plant viruses.
A system of containment
based on both physical and
biological restrictions was de
veloped. The physical restric
tions on experiments ranged
from those designated for a
standard microbiological labo
ratory to those used in
biological warfare research,
such as airlocks and required
clothing changes. The biological
concern was with the bacterium
E. Coli, a bacteria commonly
found in the human intestine.
Some scientists considered
the introduction of new
plasmids, circular
strands of genetic material, too
dangerous. They feared that the
new genetic material in
troduced into these bacteria
would produce substances

different from what is done in labs around
here.. .'

humans.
As with the physical restric
tions different levels of
biological containment were
dictated. E. Coli was to be used
in its usual form for low risk ex
periments. More hazardous ex
periments were to use of the
strain Kl2 which has an ex
tremely low survival rate in the
natural environment. The two
ways of containment were com
bined in experiments according
to the safety rating required.
Though many scientists said
these guidelines were too harsh,
public furor was aroused by the
Asilomar Conference. With a
few exceptions, Stanford among
them, cities where recombinant
DNA research was going on held
investigations of their own.
Cambridge, where both
Harvard and MIT are very

harmful to humans and, be
cause E.Coli are accepted by
the body, that the antibody sys
tem would not fight them off.
Inspite of the perceived dan
ger E. Coli provided the most
extensively researched or
ganism; its genome had been
mapped out in detail, making it
the natural choice for recombi
nant DNA experiments. It
would take ten to fifteen years
to gather such data on any other
bacteria.
The scientists at Asilomar de
cided that the desirability of us
ing E. Coli outweighed the risks.
A strain of E. Coli had been de
veloped called Kl2 which,
though it has survived in the lab
oratory for approximately 30
years, supposedly cannot live in

much involved in genetic re
search, was the first.
The mayor wanted to forbid
all dangerous research requir
ing the stringent containment
conditions, but the city council
accepted the NIH guidelines
adding restrictions of their own.
The council created a city
biohazards committee to regu
late all recombinant DNA re
search in the city.
Cohen and Berg supported
continued DNA research, but
other scientists were more
wary. They questioned the safe
ty of even the weakened Kl2
strain.
Although this form of E. Coli
could not live in the intestine for
an extended period of time,
some scientists said it would be

possible for the normal E. Coli
to absorb plasmids from the Kl2
strain if it was accidentally in
gested into the human system.
The normal E. Coli would then
reproduce with the potentialy
dangerous genome of the ex
perimental Kl2 strain.
Dr. Halsted Holman of the
Stanford Medical Center was
among those who urged caution.
The 1975 spring edition of Stan
ford M.D. contained an article
by Holman in addition to two
articles by Berg and Cohen that
praised recombinant research.
Holman's article called for
more public involvement in the
regulations of genetic research.
He raised a point that has wor
ried many. Should scientists
who are intensely involved in re
search be the ones to regulate
themselves?
Since Holman's article was

published the quidelines have
been continually relaxed.
Robert Shimke. chairman of
the Biology Department at
Stanford is one of the scientists
who feels that genetic research
is quite safe. He said that scien
tists at Stanford have been fol
lowing the NIH guidelines, even
before they were in effect.
Prof. Dow Woodward, of the
Biology Department
here,disagrees. He feels that
scientists should be very
cautious with any genetic re
search. Woodward warned that
if any accident happens "it will
be once too often."
"Scientist don't get con
cerned over nothing. If they be
lieved that whatthey were doing
was really safe, they wouldn't
have any precautions," he said.
Woodward does not agree
that the use of E. Coli is safe.

and he feels the time should
have been spent to research a
plant bacteria that could not be
a danger to human beings.
Woodward pointed to a con
flict of interest among some
biochemists. Boyer, for exam
ple. is not only a strong sup
porter of recombinant DNA re
search but one of the founders of
Genentech, a genetic engineer
ing corporation.
The companies which use re
combinant DNA research are
not regulated by NIH
guidelines. Although they have
voluntarily offered to follow the
restrictions, they will not dis
close the specific experiments
they are doing because of com
petition. Woodward worries
that" what they do at Genentech
may be very different from
what is done in labs around
here."
