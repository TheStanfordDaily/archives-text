# Business ties could hinder basic research
## 
### Jan Mireles 
The growth in the field of genetic tech
nology has meant closer ties between
universities and business. As in other
fields, patent agreements have been
made between industry and the univer
sities and many faculty members have
become consultants.
Closer ties with industry may threaten
the free exchange of scientific informa
tion which is very important to basic sci
entific research.
In a series of lectures given at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, President
Donald Kennedy discussed the adverse
effect he feels the new research environ
ment may have on traditional exchange
methods. '
"Scientists who once shared pre-publi
cation information freely and exchanged
cell lines without hesitation are now
much more reluctant to do so," said Ken
nedy.
Thomas Kiley, vice-president and gen
eral counsel for Genentech, a South San
Francisco based genetic engineering
firm, disagrees with Kennedy's
statement.
"Our policy at Genentech is in no re
spect different from a university's. We
encourage our scientists to exchange and
publish their findings," said Kiley.
The University's Office of Technology
License currently is working on the
license language of the Boyer-Cohen re
combinant DNA gene splicing patent.
The Boyer-Cohen gene splicing method
involves the manipulation of genes to
create micro-organisms that will pro
duce specific desirable products. The
patent is unique because it covers very
basic gene splicing techniques but it is
unlikely that a company with a valid rea
son will have trouble applying for a pat
ent.
Bill O'Neill, a biotechnology consul
tant here, said that the University is act
ing responsibly in developing the license
language.
"Stanford is asking relatively low roy
alties as far as patents go," said O'Neill.
O'Neill also commented on the recom
binant DNA license the University is pre
paring.
"The University administration has
not firmly decided on what terms the
contract will contain, but it does require
â€¢conformity to the biological and physical

containments of the Natinal Institute of
Health (NIH) guidelines on DNA prac
tices," O'Neill said.
Stanford's system offers incentives
that are created to encourage reassign
ment of patent rights to the University
through individual patent agreements.
The University may then license them.
Harvard is one major research univer
sity that has recently considered making
arrangements to use profits created by
successful lab efforts to generate further
research, but decided against such
moves. Though Harvard ultimately de
cided to abandon such a corporate ven
ture, proponents of the plan said that
profits from such a plan could greatly
ease the pressure on the university's en
dowment income. Kennedy made an
argument for University control of pat
ents in his lecture.
"The financial return is there, and
someone is going to get it; the Univer
sities have after all, sponsored the re
search and nurtured the climate in which
it took place, so a share should go to them
in order to replenish their capacity to do
more," Kennedy said.
The reaction from firms involved in
genetic engineering concerning the re
cent Boyer-Cohen patent is mixed. Kiley
predicts that Genentech will accept the
license, but not necessarily because
Stanford has the power to claim such s
right.
"In the final analysis these decisions
are made on a dollar-and-cents basis. It
becomes unnecessary to ask if Stanford
has the power," said Kiley.
Stanford professor and co-inventor of
the gene splicing method, Dr. Stanley
Cohen, is a consultant for the genetic en
gineering firm CETUS. CETUS is now in
the process of opening sale of stock to the
public and is likely to apply for a Boyer-
Cohen patent despite the fact that Cohen
is already listed as a corporate consul
tant and the patent resulted from his
work.
Genentech, whith director Dr.
Herbert Boyer, a UC-Berkeley professor
and co-inventor, is in the same position
of purchasing a patent developed by one
of its own researchers. Yet Kiley says
that the patent system is "acceptable."
"The patent system is a socially ac
ceptable alternative to the notion of se
crecy (among scientists). Any such rela

tion between a company and consultant
is subordinate to the faculty member's
agreement with his university," said
Kiley.
Kennedy has expressed concern over
the conflict of interest that may develop
as universities through virtue of faculty
members serving as firm consultants be
come more deeply involved in com
mercial ventures.
As policy now operates, faculty mem
bers are free to participate in or form
firms outside the University. According
to Kennedy more and more scientists are
actively seeking "proprietary posi
tions," in firms.
Also, the question of conflict of in
terest may cause the University to have
strong equity committments to one fac
ulty research program and not others.
The committment to proprietary work
might then interfere with free exchange
and accessibility of information. Ken
nedy is curious about the future of what
have been the "traditional elements in
the academic process."
Kiley however, emphasized that he
doubts increased faculty-consultant re
lations would hinder the exchange of in
formation any more than already exists.
He referred again to the patent system
as adequate protection.
"Scientists are just as competitive as
others," said Kiley. ''Science is first;
our policy is open."
Another consequence of this new en
vironment, according to Kennedy, is the
variety of ethical strains scientists must
face. The most important of these is bal
ancing utility while maintaining quality
work.
Kennedy emphasized that much of the
responsibility for making the faculty
firm relationship benefit both the Uni
versity and firm lies with the scientist.
He explained that unless a university
makes radical policy changes and ex
tends its authority, it cannot regulate the
commercial involvement of faculty
members during their "consulting
time."
Kennedy did not rule out the possi
bility of "helping" scientists set up
guidelines to follow 'n commercial deal
ings, but, "in the end the scientists them
selves must direct the effort and be re
sponsible for making the agreements
stick," he said.
