# Senate shoots down May bluegrass festival
## 
### Richard Klingler 
The ASSU Senate last night voted over
whelmingly to stop efforts to sponsor a
spring Bluegrass Festival, and in a sepa
rate 8-7 vote decided it would "not at this
time pursue the establishment of a con
cert producing agent."
In a 12 to nothing vote with three
abstentions, the senate decided that the
Bluegrass Festival is not possible be
cause no structure exists to develop stu
dent participation. Also cited were the
senate's reluctance to assume monetary
risk for the festival and its desire to con
centrate on other ASSU concerns.
The decision followed the vote to end
ASSU participation in concerts for the
present and the approval of the Finance
Committee's Monday night decision to
reject the recommendations of the con
cert feasibility task force.
In a separate action, the ASSU Senate
passed a Student Affairs Committee res
olution to establish an ad hoc committee
on El Salvador. The committee would in-

form students on events concerning that
nation, gauge student opinion about the
civil war and explore positions the ASSU
Senate might assume on the issue.
The ad hoc committee will be an im
partial body chosen through the ASSU
Committee on Committees, and its prin
cipal tasks will be to arrange symposia
and town meetings and to measure stu
dent reaction to both the El Salvadoran
conflict and any possible ASSU response.
The vote to end consideration of the
Bluegrass Festival followed a 15-minute
debate period dominated by questions
about possibilities of concert production
that would not require organizing stu
dents. The senate soundly reversed its
earlier vote to support the festival be
cause. as ASSU Financial Manager Steve
Davis said, there was no way to recruit
or organize the student expertise re
quired by the administration without an
acceptable, detailed feasibility study.
Several senators also cited the lack of
preparation time and their own unwill
ingness to work only for professional pro-

ducers as reasons the Bluegrass Festival
was not possible under ASSU auspices.
Most debate centered on the decision
to discontinue further ASSU efforts to
promote concerts at this time. Senate Fi
nance Committee Chairman Gary Reiff
led the attack on further consideration:
"We don't have the time . . . don't have
the manpower. Right now we have other
things we have to deal with."
Graduate Senator Dave Mendelkern
expressed the sentiments of several sen
ators when he said that concert produc
tion was a "dirty business" filled with
"seedy people" and that, "for the good of
everyone involved, we ought to get out of
the concert business."
Senator Ted Mitchell added that the
concert issue is "a black hole for the
ASSU."
Supporters of continued ASSU in
vestigation of concert promotion said
they thought the senate action was pre
mature. Senator Dave Daleke said that
the ASSU needed further investigation to
answer objections raised to the task

force feasibility study and even to make
any further decisions.
Many senators said that student desire
for concerts and the high visibility of
ASSU participation in concerts con
stitute sufficient reason to continue in
vestigation.
Senator Bobby Lapin responded by
saying, "The role of the senate is not to
give them (the students) what they want,
but what they need."
He suggested that the senate dedicate
itself to establishing its own travel agen
cy and other services.
After the concert issue was decided.
Senator Eve Rodler presented the reso
lution to establish the committee on El
Salvador in order that the ASSU not
avoid "issues that affect a great number
of people on campus."
In other action, the senate approved a
resolution calling for official University
recognition of Dr. Martin Luther King
Day on January 15. The ASSU pledged to
close its offices on January 15 to com
memorate Dr. King's birthday.
