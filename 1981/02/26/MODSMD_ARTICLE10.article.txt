# Stereotyping hurts fraternity recruitment
## 
### Monika Guttman 
When the movie Animal
House appeared in 1977,
a national conscious
ness about fraternities revived.
People started to reexamine the
Greek system, which came to
life again after its demise dur
ing the student protests of the
late '60s and early '70s. Reports
about the atrocities committed
by fraternities increased, and in
early 1979 the faculty at
Dartmouth College voted to ban
fraternities from that campus
altogether.
Negative images about
fraternities seem to have per
sisted through today, and local
fraternity members feel this is
an impediment to drawing stu
dents into the Greek system.
But the consequences of these
stereotypes are great, since
University regulations require
that fraternities recruit a quota
of students at least three out of
every four years. If the fraterni
ty fails to meet this require
ment, their house may be taken
over by the University and be
come part of the overall draw
system.
Some fraternities have come
close to losing their housing. If
Theta Xi does not meet its quota
this spring, the fraternity could
potentially lose its house.
Thus the fraternities here are
constantly trying to increase the
attractiveness of living within
the Greek system. One of the
major hurdles is the old stere
otypes.
"Fraternities have to make a
real concerted effort to over
come these bad images," said
Steven Beck, president of the
Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity. "A
lot of fraternities are bummed
about the publicity they get. And
many freshmen's opinions
about fraternities and rush are
formed by RAs (resident assis

tants) who have negative im
ages because they haven't
joined fraternities them
selves."
"The whole campus seems to
have grown anti-fraternity,"
said Wolf Puckett, president of
Delta Upsilon (DU) Fraternity.
"A lot of it is silly traditions
or rumors or a bad picture in the
press about how violent
fraternities are. If I were a
freshman, I'd question joining a
restricted fraternity, and that
can hurt the draw of pledges to
the system," he said.
According to Diana Con
klin, assistant dean of
residential education and
director of the Row, one of the
major weaknesses of the Uni
versity fraternity system is the
lack of understanding most peo
ple have about the houses.
"It's an area I'd like to see
improve," she said. "The
fraternities suffer from a lack
of positive publicity, and people
have to rely on rumors and old
stereotypes to form opinions of
the fraternities."
Stereotypes tend to lump all
the fraternities into one basket.
Most of the fraternities here be
moan the fact that they are not
considered individually, and
thus many outsiders miss the
uniqueness of each house.
Steve Osgood, president of
Theta Xi, said he felt that the
major problem for his fraterni
ty in terms of past recruitment
is that very few people "really
know about the house."
"People hear rumors and
tend to link all fraternities to
gether," he said. "Theta Xi is
out of the way, so it's even
harder for people to know what
the people are like, what the at
mosphere is."
"This place (the Alpha Delta
house) is as far from the stere
otypes as any place I can think

of," Beck said. "And yet the
problem is that people tend to
group all fraternities together,
to view them all as the same."
According to many, the stere
otypes and lack of individual
knowledge about the houses
have aggravated the problem of
making the quotas.
"It's hard to say why people
aren't reaching their quotas,"
said Steve Mitchell, president of
Kappa Alpha fraternity. "There
are only so many people
rushing, and people tend to

eliminate houses on the basis of
reputation. But you have to
question if the reputations are
justified. . . in many instances
they are several years old."
One of the main reasons
given for the lack of com
munity knowledge about
the individual fraternities is the

difficulty of having such a short
period for Rush in the spring.
"There's the constant prob
lem of how well you can actually
get to know somebody in just
three weeks," said Richard
David, president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council.
"There're so many good peo
ple, how do you select the 50 peo
ple to put in your house? It's
very unfair. There is a lot of
pressure on both the house and
the person rushing to make a
good impression, but so much of

it can only be superficial."
Others mentioned the pres
sure of presenting a good image
to potential pledges while trying
to get to know the people.
"Rush is a weird thing. The
guys know you're checking
them out to see if they 're worthy
of a bid, and you're trying your
best to communicate what the
house is all about. It's a strange
atmosphere to have a party in,"
Beck said.
"Part of the trouble with

Stanford fraternities sponsor the annual spring Aquafollies.
Rush is the structure of the
functions. You have open houses
and parties for a three-week
stretch, and these just aren't the
normal, natural routine of just
living here," said Mitchell. We
don't know people, and ev
erybody feels like they have to
make an impression."
"Rush could use a great deal
more creativity," said Conklin.
"There should be a movement
away from the large parties and
alcohol. . . this is really no way
to get to know people."
Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said. "A lot of peo
ple say boozing is the problem. I
think it's a symptom, not the
cause. It must mean that they
don't have a lot to talk about if
the focus of the activities is the
keg."
Administrators also said they
feel the fraternities have a prob
lem letting the community
know about themselves. The
Committee on Services to Stu
dents (COSS) is currently study
ing the problem and what could
be done to change the public im
age.
"One of the reasons they (the
fraternities) are being studied
is to see how they can do a better
job of informing people of the
positive things they do," said
I Norman Robinson, associate
I dean for residential education.
Michael Jackson, assis
tant director of the
Row, agreed, saying
"The fraternities have made a
number of changes in recent
years, but not many people
know about them. For instance,
many people do not know the
j types of community service
which the fraternities engage
i in ~
/ The lack of positive com- ,
'munication about the individ
uality of each fraternity is only
part of the problem with re
cruiting new pledges. Some
fraternity members said that
the quotas are hard to fulfill be
cause of the manner in whicn
points are assigned.

Each fraternity is given a
number of "points" which they
must attract in order to fulfill
their housing obligation with the
University. Each freshman
pledge is worth one point,
sophomore pledges are worth V2
point, and junior pledges aren't
worth any points.
"Last year, the KAs got 24
brothers, but only 18 points,"
said Mitchell. "So we were ov
ercrowded but three points un
der quota."
"You can fill your house with
good people, but if they're not
frosh, then you miss the quota,"
he continued. "And each year
there are a good amount of
sophomores wno may want to
join where they have a lot of
friends."
At UC-Berkeley,
traternities are not required to
fulfill a quota. According to
Dean of Men Tom Trutner, the
University has a "sponsorship"
agreement with the
fraternities, most of which are
off campus and live in privately
owned houses.
According to Robinson, the
quotas here may be dropped
when the new undergraduate
housing is completed, for at that
point "they may not be neces
sary." But, he added, that was
not in the immediate future, and
since housing is still in high de
mand, the University will re
quire quotas of the fraternities.
Despite the quotas, "a lot of
houses are really strong and will
continue to be strong," accord
ing to David. "Fewer people, I
think, are joining the
fraternities because of a lack of
housing."
David said he felt that some
houses have trouble recruiting
"because they're not using very
creative recruiting."
Thomas Hemple, this
year's rush chairman for
Theta Xi, said that the
fraternity will "have to try
some unconventional channels
this year'' in order to attract the
pledges they need.
"The house has changed this

year. The officers have more
experience, and we are making
a major change in rush tactics,"
he said. Some of these changes
include distributing fliers to all
male freshmen and going into
the freshmen dorms to person
ally recruit people.
"I assume we'll be having
normal rush parties," he said,
and added that activities such as
having people up to the house for
dinner "are better because they
allow potential pledges to see
what the house is really like."
"While we're a fraternity,
we're not into being clones. We
fill a niche for people who want
to join a fraternity but don't
want some of the stereotype at
mosphere," he said.
Other fraternities mentioned
the need to be original and
creative when recruiting.
"Last year, we knew we had
to make it (the quota)," said
Beck. "Everyone put out, and

now we have a blazing house."
He said that besides the usual
open houses, their house plans
an all-day canoe trip. "It's an
all-day thing, and people really
get to know each other," he
said.
Fraternities have also been
under fire for not recruiting
enough minorities, and David
said that the various houses are
working on that this year.
"One of the problems is that
many freshmen just aren't com
ing out for rush," he said. "This
year we are devoting more per
sonal attention to the theme
houses."
Lyons said that while it's
not really possible to gen
eralize, there are a
number of changes which should
be considered by fraternities
during rush.
"There ought to be a high
level of honesty. The fraternity

should really describe life in the
fraternity, the highs and lows,
the expectations, some of the
problems they have had in the
past, and so forth. That way
prospective pledges would know
exactly what they're getting
into," he said.
Also, he said, fraternities
ought to advance some sense of
fraternity, "notions of the
fraternity as an organization
that is not a dormitory."
Many members of the
fraternities said that this is one
of the strongest drawing points
in recruiting members.
"Part of the attraction of liv
ing in a fraternity is having a
sense of continuity. You become
involved, you come back each
year to the same people, and you
feel like you can be a part of ev
erything. Probably more than in
any other situation you become
involved in your own housing,
said Mitchell.
