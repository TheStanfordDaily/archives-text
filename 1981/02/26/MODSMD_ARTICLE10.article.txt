# Stereotyping hurts fraternity recruitment
## 
### Monika Guttman 
When the movie Animal
House appeared in 1977,
a national conscious
ness about fraternities revived.
People started to reexamine the
Greek system, which came to
life again after its demise dur
ing the student protests of the
late '60s and early '70s. Reports
about the atrocities committed
by fraternities increased, and in
early 1979 the faculty at
Dartmouth College voted to ban
fraternities from that campus
altogether.
Negative images about
fraternities seem to have per
sisted through today, and local
fraternity members feel this is
an impediment to drawing stu
dents into the Greek system.
But the consequences of these
stereotypes are great, since
University regulations require
that fraternities recruit a quota
of students at least three out of
every four years. If the fraterni
ty fails to meet this require
ment, their house may be taken
over by the University and be
come part of the overall draw
system.
Some fraternities have come
close to losing their housing. If
Theta Xi does not meet its quota
this spring, the fraternity could
potentially lose its house.
Thus the fraternities here are
constantly trying to increase the
attractiveness of living within
the Greek system. One of the
major hurdles is the old stere
otypes.
"Fraternities have to make a
real concerted effort to over
come these bad images," said
Steven Beck, president of the
Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity. "A
lot of fraternities are bummed
about the publicity they get. And
many freshmen's opinions
about fraternities and rush are
formed by RAs (resident assis

tants) who have negative im
ages because they haven't
joined fraternities them
selves."
"The whole campus seems to
have grown anti-fraternity,"
said Wolf Puckett, president of
Delta Upsilon (DU) Fraternity.
"A lot of it is silly traditions
or rumors or a bad picture in the
press about how violent
fraternities are. If I were a
freshman, I'd question joining a
restricted fraternity, and that
can hurt the draw of pledges to
the system," he said.
According to Diana Con
klin, assistant dean of
residential education and
director of the Row, one of the
major weaknesses of the Uni
versity fraternity system is the
lack of understanding most peo
ple have about the houses.
"It's an area I'd like to see
improve," she said. "The
fraternities suffer from a lack
of positive publicity, and people
have to rely on rumors and old
stereotypes to form opinions of
the fraternities."
Stereotypes tend to lump all
the fraternities into one basket.
Most of the fraternities here be
moan the fact that they are not
considered individually, and
thus many outsiders miss the
uniqueness of each house.
Steve Osgood, president of
Theta Xi, said he felt that the
major problem for his fraterni
ty in terms of past recruitment
is that very few people "really
know about the house."
"People hear rumors and
tend to link all fraternities to
gether," he said. "Theta Xi is
out of the way, so it's even
harder for people to know what
the people are like, what the at
mosphere is."
"This place (the Alpha Delta
house) is as far from the stere
otypes as any place I can think

of," Beck said. "And yet the
problem is that people tend to
group all fraternities together,
to view them all as the same."
According to many, the stere
otypes and lack of individual
knowledge about the houses
have aggravated the problem of
making the quotas.
"It's hard to say why people
aren't reaching their quotas,"
said Steve Mitchell, president of
Kappa Alpha fraternity. "There
are only so many people
rushing, and people tend to

eliminate houses on the basis of
reputation. But you have to
question if the reputations are
justified. . . in many instances
they are several years old."
One of the main reasons
given for the lack of com
munity knowledge about
the individual fraternities is the

difficulty of having such a short
period for Rush in the spring.
"There's the constant prob
lem of how well you can actually
get to know somebody in just
three weeks," said Richard
David, president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council.
"There're so many good peo
ple, how do you select the 50 peo
ple to put in your house? It's
very unfair. There is a lot of
pressure on both the house and
the person rushing to make a
good impression, but so much of

it can only be superficial."
Others mentioned the pres
sure of presenting a good image
to potential pledges while trying
to get to know the people.
"Rush is a weird thing. The
guys know you're checking
them out to see if they 're worthy
of a bid, and you're trying your
best to communicate what the
house is all about. It's a strange
atmosphere to have a party in,"
Beck said.
"Part of the trouble with
