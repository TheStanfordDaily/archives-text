# Couples say studying and matrimony do mix
## Married students: bucking the stereotypes 
### Karen Springen 
Marriage. The word con
jures up the image of an
eight-to-five job and the
drudgery of housework. This
conflicts with another stere
otype — that of the fun-loving
college student.
A significant number of stu
dents here are married — and
they say they are happy with
their choice of lifestyle. Accord
ing to Jackie Parr, graduate as
signment coordinator, of 12,866
students enrolled in 1980, 1887
were married. More graduate
students than undergraduates
are married. They comprise
1719 of the 1887 registered mar
ried students.
A decade ago there were
more married students than to
day. While it appears that mar
ried students will always repre
sent a substantial portion of the
Stanford community, the num
bers are decreasing. Of 12,136
students enrolled in 1973,116 un
dergraduate and 2200 graduate
students were married. And of
12,354 students here in 1977, 86
undergraduate and 1862 gradu
ate students were married.
Graduate student Richard
Putz said he failed to see any
real mystique in being a mar
ried student. No difference ex
ists between being a married
student and being married and
employed, he said.
Other students indicated that
the amount of time involved in
school and office work is com
parable. Several students said
they studied while their em
ployed spouse was at his or her
job.
But unlike a job, school does
not provide a salary. Depending
on the employment status of the
other partner, marriage can be
either a financial sacrifice or
benefit.
Graduate student Gail
Schares said, "I don't know how
I would be here if Tom (her hus
band) weren't working."
The situation does not dis
criminate between the sexes.
Graduate student Eric Peterson
said attending school is finan
cially easier for him than it
would be if he did not have a
working wife.
Students say they choose to
get married, rather than just
live together, mainly for per
sonal reasons.
Schares emphasized that
marriage is more romantic than
living together.
But marriage is also prac
tical because only mar
ried couples (and single
parents) can get housing in
Escondido.
And marriage has practical
geographic advantages as well.
Senior Lee Cline, a member of

the baseball team, said his wife
used to live in Idaho. If they had
not gotten married, "it would
have been a long way to visit
her," he said.
Cline also said he liked the
"settled life" of marriage. "It's
a decision every guy makes
sometime during his life. I just
made mine a little earlier," he
said.
Cline is one of two married
members on the baseball team.
He said he still "takes some kid
ding from the other guys on the
team."
According to Schares, single
students are curious about mar
ried students. "You've found
what everyone else is really
looking for (happiness and a
companion)," she said.
Junior Kelly Hicks noted the
curiosity of other under
graduates. People "sometimes
think it's weird" when they see
a wedding ring, she said.
"Sometimes it's- really
awkward," Hicks said. "People
think you're going to be dif
ferent."
Yet she said she has noticed
that more people come to her
with problems now than when
she was single. "Somehow they
feel like I have more knowledge
or wisdom," Hicks said.
Married life means social
izing with a diverse group. But
married undergraduates said
they generally still socialize
with single undergraduates they
met before they were married.
Senior Sheila Fowler said her
social life has undergone little
change since she and her hus
band lived in the same freshman
dorm. Fowler said, however,
that while they mostly see old
friends, they occasionally eat
dinner with other married
couples in Escondido.
"I'm doing everything I want
to do," she emphasized. "I've
never been that interested in
frat parties."
Many students em
phasized the difficulty
of meeting fellow
Escondido residents. The large
number of married students
who are foreign and who have to
cope with the language barrier
makes communication difficult.
According to Schares, "It's re
ally harder to get to know other
married people." She added,
"The most I've done is say 'hi'
to them in the elevator."
Marriage can also be a limit
ing factor when choosing jobs.
Couples cited the need for geo
graphic flexibility in careers to
accommodate their spouses.
Priority may be given to the
most dependable job.
Sophomore Sheila Newman, an
English major, said that her
husband's career as an engineer

will be more stable than her
own. Because engineering is a
lucrative field, money will not
be a concern, she said.
According to Fowler, her hus
band will take a job in the Pacif
ic Northwest next year to ac
commodate her plans to attend
graduate school in Oregon or
Washington.
Schares said she and her hus
band, who also attends Stan
ford, discussed career conflicts
before they were married. Her
husband agreed to make an ef
fort to follow her. "Marriage
does involve a little bit of com
promise at times," she said.
Marriage and studies do mix,
students agreed. They pointed
to the quiet environment of
Escondido and to the settled
lifestyle as conducive environ
mental factors to studying.
Fowler emphasized that stu
dying conditions improved after
she married because she was
"leading a more settled type of
life."
Cline also said marriage
helps him study. "You're not
out running around," he said.
Junior Kelly Hicks also said
she is a better student than
before she was married. "I used
to leave everything, but now I
have to be really conscious that
it affects my husband, too," she
said.
Her husband, a lawyer, is able
to assume household responsi
bilities when her workload is
large. For example, she said he
did the dishes during finals
week.

Marriage also did not ap
pear to be a major time
constraint on extracur
ricular activities. Newman, fof
example, has continued her in
volvement with contraceptive
and rape counseling.
There are more male than
female graduate students here.
And there are significantly
more married male than female
graduate students here. Of 1719
married graduate students, 1338
are male.
But there are slightly more
female than male married un
dergraduates. Of 68 married un
dergraduates, 43 are female.
Statistics are unavailable,
but there are few two-student
couples.
According to graduate stu
dent Nick Fowler, who is mar
ried to a senior here, wives often
leave school. He said, for exam
ple, that two girls from his
freshman dorm got married and
subsequently did not return to
school.
Carl and Helen Frickman,
both juniors, have opted to re
main students. According to
Carl, marriage simplifies sev
eral aspects of life. For exam
ple, the two no longer need to go
back and forth between each
other's residences. "We also
have at least one class together.
That makes studying easier,"
Carl said.
In addition, the Frickmans
are both members of the Stan
ford crew team, which means
helping each other get up at 5
a.m.

Carl said their social life has
not changed greatly since their
marriage this year. He added
that "it wasn't really a shock to
our friends."
About half of the married stu
dents live on campus in Escon
dido.
Housing pressure is tremen
dous, and the waiting list is long.
Many students recommended
trying to get housing in June
rather than waiting until the
Autumn Quarter crunch.
Residents generally con
sidered rent rates (even
with the 15 percent hike)
reasonable, or at least com
petitive, for the area. Unlike
dormitories, Escondido apart
ments are rented by the month.
Current (without rent hike)
family rates per month range
from $261 for a one-bedroom
apartment to $340 for four
bedrooms.
The bulk of the families
(about 364) live in two-bedroom
apartments. About 127 families
live in three- bedroom apart
ments.
According to Jean
Roodhouse, the assignment sec
retary for Escondido Village,
couples with children generally
live in two and three-bedroom
low-rises while those without
children reside in one-bedroom
high-rises.
Children add an extra ele
ment to the picture (although
less than half of the married stu
dents here have them).

Undergraduates seem partic
ularly hesitant to have children
while in school. Graduate stu
dents are generally taking more
self-paced programs, and it is
also more socially acceptable
for them to have children
According to sophomore
Stacie Newman. "Children re
ally force you to sacrifice a lot
of the relationship." She cited

the way children make a couple
share their affection. "It better
be a very stable relationship to
begin with."
Fowler said that children are
"too much" if both partners are
students. "It's just so stressful
being a full-time student."
According to Dorothea
Almond, co-director of the
childcare resource and referral
center, about 500 families live in

Escondido. And about 600 chil
dren are involved in the child
care program here. About 300
infants, toddlers and pre
schoolers attend Bing Nursery
School alone.
Other childcare programs
include the Children's
Center of the Stanford
Community, Escondido Village
Nursery School, Stanford Lu

theran Toddler Center, Stan
ford's Newest Afterschool Pro
gram (SNAP) and daycare
homes.
The Children's Center is a pa
rent co-op open every day, all
year from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Since the centers receive no
money from the University, the
cooperative system helps keep
rates low. The amount of time
the child spends at the center

determines the wife's time
commitment under the coopera
tive system.
According to Almond, many
of the wives who help are for
eign since their immigration pa
pers prevent them from earning
money.
Daniel Garcia, a teacher at
the Children's Center, said
about 120 families use the ser
vice. One-third of the children
are those of students here.
"People must have a Stanford
affiliation" to use the center, he
added.
Escondido Nursery School is
also a parent cooperative. Vil
lage residents are given priori
ty.
The Lutheran Toddler Center
cooperative gives foreign stu
dent families priority. It can
only accommodate 12 students.
SNAP is an afterschool ser
vice from 2 p.m. t05:30p.m. for
six to 10-year-olds.
According to Phyllis Craig,
co-director of the research and
referral center, interested
members of the Stanford com
munity should contact the cen
ter at 497-2660.
