# Stanford's secluded spaces: little-known but highly valued
## 
### Todd Pickett 
For many of us, the
excitement of our first
emergence onto the
Stanford campus was
accompanied by the ominous
task of finding our way around
the 8300 acres of unfamiliar
territory. In those first few
weeks, we ventured out in
expedition-like groups,
equipped with maps to guide us
through the seemingly
unsolvable maze of pathways,
lawns and buildings.
But by the time visor and
sunglasses gave way to hoods
and umbrellas, we had
discovered the shortest routes
to class, found the most quiet
study rooms, and no longer
searched in bewilderment for
some "UGLY" building
In spite of courses and
activites which take the student
to all corners of the campus,
some Stanford sites still remain

unknown to many University
locals. Of these little-known
places, some hide behind the
protection of towering trees,
some lie in the shadows of
University buildings, and others
remain out of sight from the
travels of bikes and golf carts.
Or, maybe the demands of a
syllabus and the ticking of a
clock has hurried us past these
spots which, though in clear
view, remain unnoticed
Those who take the time to
explore these semi-secluded
spaces may stumble upon a
pleasant way to spend an
afternoon. The discovery of a
green, sunlit lawn, void of sun
seeking bodies and softly
floating frisbees, may offer a
serene setting for reflection,
relaxation or deep sleep. Apart
from the familiar images of
"the claw" and "Mem hoop,"
other, less frequented fountains
entertain their admirers with
resplendent streams of water
woven in a perpetual pattern.

Guarded by the campus's
abundance of greenery
stand sculptures and
monuments like the Mausoleum
whose mysterious majesty is
appreciated only by occasional
visitors, Halloween spirits and a
small group of students who
annually celebrate the birthday
of its inhabitant
Even the stillness of an empty
bench set in the midst of a patch
of colorful flowers, beckons us
to momentarily escape from the
incessant flow of information
which can cloud our
perspective.
For those whose life has
become a merry-go-round of
routine schedules in drab
surroundings, here's a glance at
some sites you may have
missed. But don't settle for
words and pictures, for they are
just a reflection of reality.
Rather, explore for yourself
these little-known places. They
might become familiar friends.
