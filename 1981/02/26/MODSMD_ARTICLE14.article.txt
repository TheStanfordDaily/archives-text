# Overseas Studies challenges and responds
## Centers continually reviewed, improved 
### Fran Miller 
If there is one major
criticism of Stanford's "lib
eral education," it is that it
supplies broad theoretical no
tions which are seemingly un
related to the "real world." A
careful look at the Overseas
Studies program here, however,
will reveal the efforts of admin
istrators, professors and stu
dents who are trying to bridge
the gap between an awareness
of other cultures and an actual
understanding of them.
This is a formidable task, to
be sure, and one which is not so
easily defined People build
bridges in different ways, and
the programs which are offered
in 12 cities around the world
through the Overseas Office are
as varied as the people who par
ticipate in them.
Some of the programs, such
as Berlin and Florence, require
two quarters of language ex
perience. Other programs at
Lima, Paris and Sao Paulo re
quire the equivalent of two
years language experience.
While each year there is room
for only two Stanford students in
the Lima and Nairobi pro
grams, the campuses in
Cliveden and Florence, Stan
ford's largest overseas centers,
hold 60 to 80 students.
Living accommodations also
vary from center to center of
/ fering everything from villas to
dorms, to apartments, to rooms
with native families.
Some programs require stu
dents to stay two quarters or a
full year, while others make no
such requirement.
According to Assistant Over
seas Studies Director Peggy
Blumenthal, approximately 600
students take advantage of one
of these programs each year.
She said that this figure trans
lates into roughly one-third of
every graduating class, and in
the social sciences and human
ities, the percentage is greater.
Stanford's overseas program
is bigger and more flexible than
that at any other major U.S. uni
versity, according to Blumen
thal. "The idea," she said, "is
that every student should have
the opportunity to go overseas
as part of his education." She
cited the new science and engi
neering programs, which will be
available in Germany and Aus
tria next year, as an attempt to
help put this philosophy into
practice.

Mark Mancall, overseas stud
ies director since 1973, shares
the view that the program
should be made available to all
students. He said that although
the academic quality of the pro
grams has been upgraded over
the past eight years, there is
room for improvement in sever
al areas.
Improving relations with lo
cal universities is one of them.
Becoming less "Euro
pocentric" is another, accord
ing to Mancall. "The center of
the world isn't Europe any
more," he said. "It's a scandal
that students can go through
Stanford and graduate into lead
ership positions without man
datory studies, in depth, of an
other culture outside of Western
Europe."
Mancall said that he is
"philosophically op
posed to maintenance"
and that there is no program
which is a "given." He said that
he and his colleagues are con
stantly asking themselves to
justify each center, according
to the "academic and intellec
tual importance of the program
for education at Stanford."
He cited England as a country
"important to American cul
ture given the major role it has
played in our history. Whether
Cliveden is the best place for the
center is a question we are con
stantly asking," said Mancall.
Mexico was mentioned by
Mancall as a likely site for a new
center and, according to the di
rector, overseas administrators
are currently working on the de
velopment of a center there.
Mancall said that the decision to
open a new campus is due to a
combination of factors, finan
cial feasibility being the
greatest limitation. Funds, such
as those which are making the
center at Haifa possible, must
be raised outside the Univer
sity.
In addition to this, adminis
trators overseas think "Ameri
ca is the land of milk and hon
ey," said Mancall. "It's hard to
get people to realize that private
education is in hard times and
that Stanford doesn't have a
boundless source of gold."
Another important considera
tion in opening a center involves
the insight and foresight of
educators, according to Man
call. He said his responsibility is
not only to respond to students
but to challenge them. Mancall

said he judges complaints on the
basis of how well he knows the
center and how consistent the
complaints are.
Students should "never be
less than insatiably curious" as
well as "utterly open to the va
lidity of other cultures," in or
der to get the most out of an ov
erseas center, he said. Mancall
said he does not believe educa
tion is a "process of marching
students through a pre-planned
maze."
Students must "tailor pro
grams to their academic
needs," he said. "We're a very
parochial people," Mancall
said. "Although learning may
not be formal learning, anything
that will get a student overseas
is valid as long as the student is
learning something."
Corb Smith, associate direc
tor of Overseas Studies, advised
against going abroad for "flat
out traveling. Somebody whose
primary motivation is traveling
is wasting his or her parents'
money to put up with the frus
trations of going to school," he

said.
Having gone to Stanford-in-
Florence as a sophomore in
1962, Smith said his expecta
tions were far exceeded, al
though his first overseas center
choice was not Florence. (At
that time, students listed sever
al preferences and were accom
modated according to grade
point average. Today, students
apply only to the specific cam
pus they wish to attend and are
selected on the basis of lan
guage proficiency, course back
ground, scheduling restrictions,
a personal statement, prox
imity to graduation and pro
posed length of stay.)
Smith said he believes that it
is better to stay two quar
ters in order to be able to
"make sense" of the culture. He
said that "family living ar
rangements are given far more
credit than they deserve." Most
of the time students end up
either simply boarding or are
saddled with responsibilities
they haven't been used to for
several years, said Smith:
Although Overseas Studies
provides orientation programs
for students going to most cen

ters, distributes handbooks,
books plane reservations and
lists due dates for materials
needed to go abroad, Smith said
it is very hard to get students to
really think about going to a for
eign country when they are in
the middle of a quarter here.
Mancall said although pres
ent orientation programs are in
adequate, participation is vol
untary and many students
wouldn't go unless attendance
was mandatory.
The office has considered im
plementing a follow-up program
to help people adjust back to
Stanford life â€” a sort of "de
briefing," according to Smith,
but the tight budget has pre
vented an organized effort to do
that at this point.
Smith said his main goal is to
"make the learning better." Al
though he says that learning ov
erseas is "different from trek
king off to UGLY for eight hours
on a Saturday," teachers in oth
er countries must "address
American students at the level
they have and move them quick-

ly from there in order to be real
ly good."
Both Smith and Mancall said
they hoped that courses over
seas would be approved in order
to satisfy some of the new dis
tribution requirements and
mentioned the possibility of im
plementing part of the required
Western Culture series at one or
more of the centers. They said
they feel strongly about the val
ue of having competence in an
other language.
"Teaching in this country,
however," according to Smith,
"aims at literary analysis" and
does not improve one's ability to
communicate effectively.
"We've got to figure out ways to
teach better," Smith said. He
stated his belief that a new lan
guage requirement would not
make people "any more compe
tent linguistically."
Theoretically, any student
who can afford to go to Stanford
can afford to go overseas be
cause there is financial aids,
Mancall said. However, prob
lems arise with students' and
parents' perceptions of what
they can and cannot afford, he
said.
"Students are increasingly
aware that their parents are
getting stretched," commented
Smith.
Although most of the facul
ty who teach overseas are
hired locally, 10 to 15 fac
ulty members go to centers ov
erseas from Stanford each year.
The Academic Planning Com
mittee of Stanford Overseas
Studies, appointed by the prov
ost, is responsible for approving
professors' applications two
years in advance of the time fac
ulty wish to depart. Professors
must submit specific course
outlines which show how a
course can be better taught ov
erseas than at Stanford-in-Cali
fornia. Student evaluations are
also considered in the selection
of overseas faculty, according
to Assistant Director Peggy
Blumenthal.
English Prof, and Human
ities Special Program
Chairman Larry Ryan,
who has taught at the Florence

campus five times, said that
"the committee screens very
carefully" to make sure faculty
"have something relevant to
teach." Ryan, who has taught
courses such as Italian Renais
sance Society and Culture, said,
"for me, Florence is a lab" and
a place to do research.
Ryan said that the Florence
campus is well-run, that there is
a much wider selection of
courses today, and that students
are more self-disciplined and
self-directed than they were 10
years ago when there were
more constraints on them.
Although there is the danger
of the villa becoming a "little is
land" for the less ambitious,
Ryan said that the "energetic
ones" can meet people and
steep themselves in Florentine
culture.
History Prof. Paul Robinson,
who served as director of the
Berlin center during winter 1977
and winter and spring 1978, said
he fought hard to keep the cen
ter afloat when it was in danger
of being closed due to budget

cuts in the late 19705. Robinson
said he argued the merits of
Berlin as "one of the great cities
of the world" due to its "unique
location between two radically
different cultures.
"Berlin is a living education
in the realities of the modem
world," he said. Robinson, like
Mancall, said he believes that
the effect of studying overseas
cannot be measured by one's or
iginal expectations. "Irrespec
tive of the purpose," Robinson
said, "the effect is undoubtedly
beneficial.
"Because Germany is the
center of my scholarly life and
my teaching life, I went to Ber
lin to reinitiate the romance
and to recapture language
skills," Robinson said. He
added that academics there are
"marginally less rigorous and
less demanding" and that Ber
lin is "not a vacation, not a
place where you can do noth
ing."
He said his role as a faculty
member is different overseas in
that there are "no elements of
decorum and formality, and stu
dents' private lives impose upon
you in a more obvious way than
they do at Stanford."
In Berlin, Stanford students
who have an extensive German
language background may
choose to attend the Free Uni
versity instead of taking classes
at the center.
Robinson said he favors a
University language require
ment "from the point of view of
a liberal education which pre
pares students to be civilized,
cultured human beings."
According to English As
soc. Prof. John Bender,
who has taught at
Cliveden three times and in
Tours once, there are four kinds
of students who journey over
seas: those whose academic
area of study corresponds to the
culture they're visiting (about
15 percent), those who are seri
ously interested in the culture
but for whom it is not a central
interest (about 35 percent),
those for whom it is high-quality
recreation (about 40 percent),
and those for whom it is low-

quality recreation (about 10per
cent ).
Bender said he doesn't agree
that the program should be de
signed so that "absolutely ev
eryone can go." He said he feels
that the Stanford programs are
"silly" for people in the fourth
category. Bender said he
travels overseas in order to do
research and because "it's a
change and it's fun." He said he
works harder there than he does
here and has found the courses
to be comparable academically.
"Most students leave out the
academics when they describe
how it was to be there (over
seas)," said Bender. "And there
are enough students who don't
study very much to sustain the
myth, especially science ma
jors and engineers who tend to
be more relaxed because they
are stepping out of their intense
frame." Bender said he thought
it would be better if students
knew they were going to have to
study before they went.
Although "there's no denying
that Cliveden is geographically
isolated," Bender said he feels
that there would probably be no
more "significant interaction"

with English people if the cam
pus were located in London or
Oxford. Bender said he believes
this is due to the formal English
manners and the fact that Eng
lish undergraduates operate on
the same level as American
graduate students.
Bender said he thinks the
purpose of going abroad is "not
to get to know a foreign culture,
but to witness a foreign culture
in the process of doing what it
does." He said he would urge
people to separate academic ex
periences from learning ex
periences.
"The reason those of us who
believe in overseas studies be
lieve in it is because it combines
the academic approach with the
actual experience itself," said
Bender. He said he believes that
the overseas campuses provide
the "framework and the occa
sion" for this combination, and
that a large program such as
Stanford's is justified by the ex
istence of the people for whom
the study of the culture is impor
tant but not central.
A more exclusive program
would leave them out, he said,
and they're the group "for
whom it can be a kind of con
version."
