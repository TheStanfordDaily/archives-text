# Cultural differences discussed
## Students reveal attitudes 
### Fran Miller 
The only thing more dif
ficult than stereotyping
attitudes and expecta
tions of Stanford students is
stereotyping the attitudes and
expectations of Stanford stu
dents who go overseas.
Some are more or less pre
pared, more or less studious,
more or less open and en
thusiastic. Almost all agree,
however, that their experience
changed them in some concrete
way.
For senior Annette Murrell,
spending II months in Nairobi
was both important to her ma
jor — African and Afro-Ameri
can Studies — and to "my own
personal development. I think
you really need to get another
perspective outside the U. 5.,"
she said. "I've never been
enamored of the United States.
We interact with people through
objects, and in Kenya, since ob
jects aren't as accessible, you
concentrate on personal rela
tionships."
Murrell said she has noticed a
qualitative difference in her

own relationships with people
since returning home.
In Nairobi, Murrell lived in an
apartment and attended classes
at the local university — when it
wasn't closed. She said that aca
demics there are very com
petitive, but that she didn't have
the same pressures as the
native people because she knew
she could come back to Stanford
to graduate.
In establishing ties with local
people, Murrell said that "it
wasn't a picture-book 'Roots'
kind of thing," but that the peo
ple were "refreshing value
wise, very open and very won
derful. I learned how to ex
perience something," she said.
Murrell said that although the
Overseas Office was helpful, the
University of California sys
tem, with which Stanford oper
ates in Nairobi, was very dis
organized and could not deal
with a crisis situation.
Murrell said all information
she received was last-minute
and said she believes this re
flects American attitudes in
general. "Anything but Europe
we don't take seriously," she

said, "and I don't take Stanford
so seriously now."
Commenting on what she saw
in Africa, Murrell said that the
two extremes of poverty and ex
cessive wealth "cannot help but
hit you." She said that there is a
difference between borrowing
something from another culture
and having that culture domi
nate you. "The U.S. can rarely
give you something and not
dominate you," she said. "On
the whole, the U.S. role has been
an exploitative one."
The only thing Murrell said
she missed while she was gone
was jazz concerts and "a seri
ous music scene." She said she
would have enjoyed staying
longer and would like to return
there.
Antionette Altamirano, an
English and Spanish ma
jor, had quite a different
view of the United States after
returning from a six-month stay
in Salamanca, Spain. "I'm a lit
tle bit more patriotic," said
Altamirano. "When people start
running down my country I'm
not just going to stand by.
Altamirano said the Salu i an
ca program is not for everybody
and that "you really have to be
outgoing and want to < he
communication barrier a; he
little bit of hostility that Si in sh
students have toward Ameri
cans."
Although Altamirano id
that she has become more fi
dent of herself and that " as
from Salamanca that I W ?d

said she "could have no le
and been just as happy."

Because of the strict res e
