# Cultural differences discussed
## Students reveal attitudes 
### Fran Miller 
The only thing more dif
ficult than stereotyping
attitudes and expecta
tions of Stanford students is
stereotyping the attitudes and
expectations of Stanford stu
dents who go overseas.
Some are more or less pre
pared, more or less studious,
more or less open and en
thusiastic. Almost all agree,
however, that their experience
changed them in some concrete
way.
For senior Annette Murrell,
spending II months in Nairobi
was both important to her ma
jor — African and Afro-Ameri
can Studies — and to "my own
personal development. I think
you really need to get another
perspective outside the U. 5.,"
she said. "I've never been
enamored of the United States.
We interact with people through
objects, and in Kenya, since ob
jects aren't as accessible, you
concentrate on personal rela
tionships."
Murrell said she has noticed a
qualitative difference in her

own relationships with people
since returning home.
In Nairobi, Murrell lived in an
apartment and attended classes
at the local university — when it
wasn't closed. She said that aca
demics there are very com
petitive, but that she didn't have
the same pressures as the
native people because she knew
she could come back to Stanford
to graduate.
In establishing ties with local
people, Murrell said that "it
wasn't a picture-book 'Roots'
kind of thing," but that the peo
ple were "refreshing value
wise, very open and very won
derful. I learned how to ex
perience something," she said.
Murrell said that although the
Overseas Office was helpful, the
University of California sys
tem, with which Stanford oper
ates in Nairobi, was very dis
organized and could not deal
with a crisis situation.
Murrell said all information
she received was last-minute
and said she believes this re
flects American attitudes in
general. "Anything but Europe
we don't take seriously," she

said, "and I don't take Stanford
so seriously now."
Commenting on what she saw
in Africa, Murrell said that the
two extremes of poverty and ex
cessive wealth "cannot help but
hit you." She said that there is a
difference between borrowing
something from another culture
and having that culture domi
nate you. "The U.S. can rarely
give you something and not
dominate you," she said. "On
the whole, the U.S. role has been
an exploitative one."
The only thing Murrell said
she missed while she was gone
was jazz concerts and "a seri
ous music scene." She said she
would have enjoyed staying
longer and would like to return
there.
Antionette Altamirano, an
English and Spanish ma
jor, had quite a different
view of the United States after
returning from a six-month stay
in Salamanca, Spain. "I'm a lit
tle bit more patriotic," said
Altamirano. "When people start
running down my country I'm
not just going to stand by.
Altamirano said the Salu i an

and that "you really have to be

Because of the strict res e

She said that because * d

it took relatively little time to
get used to the accent in Spain.
"You have to know Spanish,"
she advised, "and you have to be
comfortable with the Spanish
that you know."
Altamirano said that al
though she studied "very lit
tle," she acquired a "literary
skill of criticizing that I didn't
get at Stanford. You live the
feeling of the literature while
you're in Spain," she said. "You
realize the big effect history has
on the present."
Too much tradition is rooted
into Spanish culture for the cur
rent speed of technological de
velopment, Altamirano said.
"They need to wait for their at
titudes to catch up," she com
mented.
Altamirano admitted that she
got homesick, but said that "I
did have good times and made
good friends. The director in
Salamanca is excellent, and I
don't think any other program
could immerse you more in the
culture."
Seniors Suzanne Hernandez,
John McCarroll and Paul
Vidano, all engineering majors
who have journeyed to Flor
ence, agreed that "you have to
make an effort to get out of the
villa" in order to experience
Italian culture. Vidano said he
was able to spend his entire
sophomore year in Florence be-

'Never at my time at Stanford have I felt
that I knew as little as I did in Florence.
You're really put in your place.'

cause engineering courses were
available there at that time. He
said that his most valuable ex
perience was living with a fami
ly winter quarter.
Learning the language well
and getting to know an
area from other than a
traveller's viewpoint were his
goals, he said. "I didn't go there
to meet Stanford people."
McCarroll, who was in Flor
ence for only one quarter, said
he was able to come into direct
contact with Italians by
coaching a little league baseball
team there. He said that al
though he learned less "from a
book" than at Stanford, assign
ments were "something you
wanted to do, not something you
put off until midnight."
McCarroll said he was im
pressed by the Italians' ap
preciation of human value. "I
was never on a train," he said,
"where people didn't talk to
each other." Often, he said, the

conversation evolved into an in
tense political discussion.
Vidano said he gained an ap
preciation for aesthetics which
could not have been duplicated
in the United States. "I've lost
an awful lot of what I learned
but I still have part of it,"he
said. Both Vidano and McCar
roll said they wished they could
have attended a local university
overseas.
Although he was only there
for a quarter, McCarroll said he
got "homesick for Florence for
a year afterwards." Having
travelled through Europe until
three days before fall quarter
registration, McCarroll said
that the hardest adjustment at
Stanford was living in Stern —
being "back in a concrete box."
Vidano said he thought the
only serious flaw in the cur
riculum was the omission of an
architecture course. Her
nandez, however, said she was
somewhat bothered by the lack
of structured classes, although
"it was a little more like real
life than turning in problem sets
every week."
She said that her three
months there this past fall were
not sufficient to delve into the
culture and that "never at my
time at Stanford have I felt that
I knew as little as I did in Flor
ence. You're really put in your
place," she said.
The average Florentine is

very aware of his past, Her
nandez said. "I left Florence re
alizing the importance of under
standing a person's background
— including my own. There are
basic people differences and the
hardest part of being overseas is
establishing friendships and
being accepted."
Hernandez said she believes
that situations where one is
thought of as a foreigner are not
limited to being in a foreign
country. "I know I'll see that in
business,'' she stated.
For junior Maureen Schu
macher, going overseas
meant going back to Eu
rope to study. Having attended a
London high school,
Schumacher said that she came
to Stanford because of its over
seas study program. She said
she began planning first quarter
freshman year and was not dis
appointed with her two quarters
in Vienna last year. Schu
macher said that in Vienna "you

tend to get close to the people
and that closeness has stayed."
She said that living in Haus Mit
teleuropa has helped her retain
that closeness at Stanford.
According to Jeff Avina and
David Campbell, the program in
Lima, Peru, will not suit a stu
dent's needs if he is "looking for
a certain comfortableness or for
glamor."
"Lima is the ugliest city I've

some of the things we have and what you
could get here. You can't just hate the
U.S. That's like hating yourself. The
resources we have here can be used to
instigate changes.'

ever seen,"according to Avina,
a senior who spent last year in
Peru.
Unlike Campbell, Avina did
not attend classes, but worked
on a research project about
agrarian reform. He said he
mingled less with people than
Campbell because of the nature
of his work. Nevertheless,
Avina said being in Lima was a
"real cultural shock which af
fected (me) deep inside." De
scribing Lima as 70 percent
slums, Avina said there is a
"difference in reading that
there are no public facilities and
actually not finding them when
you need a bathroom."
Both Avina and Campbell,
who spent time living with a
native family, said getting out
of the city and talking to people
in the more rural areas was an
invaluable experience. Break

ing the barriers with natives
took a lot of time and effort,
they said, because as Ameri
cans, they were immediately
considered upper class and, as a
result, were not as readily ac
cepted by the lower class.
"I had a fairly negative view
of the United States before I left
here," said Avina. "Going to
Lima made me appreciate some
of the things we have and what

you could get here. You can't
just hate the U. 5.," he said.
"That's like hating yourself.
The resources we have here can
be used to instigate changes."
Campbell agreed, citing his
50-person class for which there
was one textbook available as
an example of how much easier
it is to obtain and learn materi
als here.
Avina, who said he would
like to continue work in
international relations,
commented that "Lima de
stroyed all my theories about
politics and people." He said
that his expectations literally
"rolled out of his eyes in tears"
after one of the first ex
periences he had in Lima, that
of being tear-gassed by the mili
tary.
Campbell, who said he hopes

to join the Peace Corps and
work in South America, said he
didn't realize until he returned
from Lima "how superficial
some people were here. The
people I see now I know really
well," he said.
"I had this visual image of
people (at Stanford) living in a
bubble and I hadn't seen that
before," Avina agreed.
"Life down there is full of ex
tremes," added Campbell.
"There were some good days
and some bad days, but it was
definitely worth it."
