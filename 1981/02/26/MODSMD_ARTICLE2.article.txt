# Res ed seeks minority RAs
## 
### Carol Rose 
In an effort to encourage a
greater number and diversity of
resident assistant (RA) applica
tions. the office of residential
education is planning to in
crease the RA stipend by $500
per year, according to Norm
Robinson, dean of residential
education.
"We are interested in getting
more minority students on the
residential staffs in order to re
flect the diversity of the student
body," said Robinson.
Next year a new RA will re
ceive a $2050 stipend, and an ex
perienced RA will receive $2150.
Robinson said.
In addition to the pay in
crease. res ed has written to
various minority student or
ganizations. as well as faculty
members who work with stu
dents of various ethnic back
grounds, asking them to en
courage students to apply for
RA positions, according to Alice
Supton, assistant dean of resi
dential education.
"There is a natural teaching
situation that emerges when
housing staffs are ethnically di

verse," Supton said.
"It helps to raise conscious
ness about racial and class ques
tions in the same way that wom
en RAs can raise consciousness
about sex roles," she said.
Currently about 17 percent of
the RA positions are held by mi
nority students, out of a total of
163 positions.
Administrative changes
There may be minor adminis
trative changes in the selection
process if there is a substantial
increase in the number of can
didates, but the selection proc
ess will remain basically the
same, Supton said.
The selection process has two
rounds. In the first round, the
person who completes an ap
plication is interviewed by a
three person panel.
One change this year is that
the candidate will complete an
essay in the first round process,
Supton said.
"In the e r ,say, we are asking
people to think ahead of time
about what house they want to
work in," she said.
"The Â£ssay is the time for
candidates to identify the rec

ommending qualities in terms
of residential assistantships. It
will also help the resident fel
lows in the second part of the
selection process,"she said.
Based on the interview and
application process, the can
didates may go to round two.
Here, the individual resident
fellows interview the applicants
to work in their houses.
"In order to be an RA, one
must have personal ease of style
and accessibility, but that is not
enough. We are as looking for
job-related strengths such as
program development and or
ganizational skills, and leader
ship ability," Supton said.
It is important to have minor
ity RAs in the non-theme
houses, Damon Caldwell, an RA
at Florence Moore, said.
"There are still a lot of blacks
outside of the theme houses. It is
especially beneficial for
freshmen to have role models,
and a black RA can provide
that," he said.
"Some people come from lim
ited backgrounds and they need
