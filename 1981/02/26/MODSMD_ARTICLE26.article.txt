## Mutants outstrip Sexual Response 
### Don Willenburg 
The double bill at the Old
Waldorf last Friday pre
sented a rare opportunity
to see two major and contrast
ing approaches of underground
new wave to the commercial
success of so much music
labeled as new wave by over
zealous promoters and over-in
clusive critics.
Human Sexual Response, Fri
day's headliner, is a Boston
based band with a new album,
Figure 14, and a frequently cov
ered single finally starting to
get airplay. They are currently
in the middle of a national pro
motional tour. The hometown
Mutants, on the other hand, are
still wading through legal and
creative hassles before getting
so much as close to vinyl. If the
performances given Friday
night are a reasonable indica
tion, it might well be worth
camping outside the record
store door once for the Mutant's
release and forgoing HSR for at
least the time being.
There are enough similarities
in the bands to make the effects
of the different approaches es
pecially pronounced. Both are
unusually large bands, with non
playing singers fronting nons
inging musicians. Both are from
quaint picturesque bay cities on
coasts where the center of cul
tural and anti-cultural activity
is generally presumed to be in
the megalopolis some hundreds
of miles to the south. This latter
fact alone is often enough to pro
duce a certain amount of ori
ginality and iconoclasm as a
way of defiantly asserting re
gional pride. HSR and the Mu
tants each stand in marked con
trast to the trendier bands mak
ing time, money, and press cov
erage in New York and Los An
geles.
The bands differ dramati
cally in their approaches to new
wave. HSR follows the example
of those who have led the move
to prettiness in new wave mu
sic, a more than occasional
flirtation with power pop, and a
willingness to utilize tricks
learned from smooth mid-'6os
music-establishment rock. The
emphasis on highly structured
vocals characteristic of this ap
proach is raised to the level of
high art by HSR. There is an ov
erwhelming suspicion that
these are all design students
who had 12 years of voice les
sons.
The Mutants, however, rely
on more feeling and honest emo
tion than most commercially
successful bands. The creativity
and complexity derives not
from a conscious overweaving
of patterns, like HSR's, but
from a gut level originality that
just told Fritz Mutant or one of
the other Mutants that he should
put this part in at just this time.
Human Sexual Response
opened the show with "Ex
posure," a "meet the band"
tune that came off better than
most. When the four singers, in
cluding a redhaired woman who
just has to be South Boston
Irish, began their concertedly
disconcerted dancing before the
surprisingly full-sounding
three-piece band behind them,
everyone was more than pass
ingly interested.
But before HSR had gotten
through their second song, sev
eral things became apparent.
The late sound check which had
delayed the start of the first set
for more than an hour was ap
parently not completely suc
cessful, particularly un

fortunate for a group whose
sound depends so heavily on vo
cal precision and subtlety.
More significantly, HSR's act
began to seem like just that : an
act. The first two songs were
both about sex, the first playing
on the title s double entendre,
the second having a lyric
fascination with the question of
"what does it mean to me? what
does it mean to society?" but
sung so rhetorically as to lose
any possible real or parodic
meaning.
The band members, however,
were neither threatening nor
youthful "we're not as innocent
as you think" figures. The talk
of sexuality in the songs wasn't

supported by any image the
group members were able to
project singly or together, and
sex was not so much trivialized
(probably an anticipated com
ment for a new wave band) as
made irrelevant to the per
formance.
This, from a band fronting
four singers who dance con
stantly? Their conception of sex
reeks of predisposed nastiness,
like that of 13-year-old who is
educated by his father's "estab
lishment," Playboy-type porno-

graphic magazines.
HSR's vocals are intricate,
smooth and ultimately over
produced. They have the gener
al tenor of the Cowsills, and one
could easily imagine the As
sociation, another group of mid
60s singers who eventually
sounded too sweet for anyone,
doing some of HSR's vocal
parts. But the Association never
played music like this.
HSR's sound features true
acid rock influence, and lots of
chord changes that someone not
committed to a certain formal
nihilism in music would never
come up with, even in their
worst nightmare. Each of the

musicians keeps the sound im
mediate and a force behind the
vocals, but ultimately that isn't
enough to maintain a consistent
level of excitement.
Granted, when HSR's songs
get to the fast breaks, and they
use their voices as instruments
rather than as parts of a chorus,
the result can be quite im
pressive. But as others from
Boston have said of Galliano
and Quaaludes, you can only do
it so often before it gets old.
If the bizarre, if energetic,
Temptations-like dancing really
does stand for the group as
much as they try to make it part
of their image, then maybe the
whole performance is some-

thing set up and then delivered.
HSR plays music that is staged,
not created; performed, but
seldom played.
A good example of the dif
ferences between the two bands
was in their treatment of the
fairly funky (i.e., played with
more than a 4/4 sense of
rhythm) songs. HSR employs
much more of a Philadelphia
"wall of sound" approach. The
only song on Figure 14 they
didn't write is the classic "Cool
Jerk." The Mutants are much

more visceral. The bass line is
back to the jungle, straight from
the heart, although the band
members were obviously per
formers, they also obviously be
lieve in what they are doing and
in encouraging anyone within
hearing range to dance. Music
to listen, yes, but listen first and
foremost with your feet - the
sound will work its way up to
your ears in no time.
If Human Sexual Response
comes off with more
creativity in terms of
thought and care for design, the
Mutants come off with more

brute originality. With three
singers fronting four musicians,
the opening "Love Song" —
"tell me that you love me" —
sets the tone for the relationship
with the audience. Audience
members occasionally dancing
on stage, and no bouncers toss
ing them onto Clay Street from
the second story plaza? A fifth
singer who only waltzes on stage
in something vaguely looking
leopard-like and half unraveled
to deliver, in all sweetness, de
monic bird trills into a new mi
crophone each time the chorus
comes around? Not likely to be
found in anybody's formula for
success. Consequently, it

works, at least in front of an au
dience this serious about their
fun.
Strictly speaking, the Mu
tants are not waiting for their
first record, but for their first
album. The band has released
two singles, and according to
guitarist Bob Mutant, "about a
year and a half ago, had the
number one song in Liechtens
tein." The anomaly is over
whelming — I try to think of the
gentle peasants and
burgemeisters breaking from

their gentle, patterned folk
dances to the episemantics of
dancing to the Mutants.
It's less hearing the music,
semiotically processing the in
formation, and the brain form
ing and transmitting a set of
commands along appropriate
neurons, than it is touching a
galvanic curent to a nerve in the
leg of a freshly dissected frog. I
can't see it in "Sound of Music"
country.
Bob explained that the infre
quency with which the Mutants
have been playing of late is due
to giving their attention to an
album. Still, the band feels a
need to play live dates to keep

their inspiration level high.
When the Mutants perform, he
says, "we pick up the excite
ment, and we take it into the stu
dio with us — we can still feel
what worked with the audience
when we're in the studio."
The Mutants were in com
plete control of this audience,
but their album would not be one
to play to someone listening to
new wave for the first time.
They do not play the com
mercial game of being on the fr
inge of the movement in an ef
fort to achieve a broad-based
following. Rather, they play
music that demands a rather
substantial appreciation of new
wave as precondition of accep
tance.
Bob recognizes this, and re
lates it to difficulties the Mu
tants were having regarding the
album. "The Mutants have been
on the cutting edge of the scene
for the past couple of years. The
scene now is really LA, and the
Mutants just aren't LA. LA is
the Knack and groups like that,
and we're just not like that."
Human Sexual Response,
however, may succeed before
the general public better than
they did before the crowd at the
Old Waldorf precisely because
they are closer to that scene. It
is not hard to conceive of them
as Boston's answer to the
Knack. Their main problem
seems to be material. They have
some good songs, and lyrics like
"I want to be Jackie
Onassis/want to wear dark sun
glasses/ . . . after my trag
edy/Aristotle take care of me"
are a treat to listen to.
On the other hand, there is no
consistent excitement or com
pulsion to dance. There is a fun
damental incongruity, not so
much in the voices and the lyrics
as the voices and the music.
Maybe voices just aren't sup
posed to be that sweet when the
music is that raw. One keeps
wondering why these voices are
singing these songs. Maybe HSR
considers that their gimmick.
The unusual features of the band
— the four front singers, the
barbershop (Mohawks only)
quartet abilities — are a special
medium, and should be treated
as such. There are special possi
bilities for expression: one
wishes HSR would exploit these
and play songs for a band with
their unique talents rather than
songs anyone else can play. It's
like wasting a David Bowie per
formance of a meaningful play
on Broadway audiences.
If evolution really does ad
vance by successive mutations,
then those we call mutants are
only those who have changed
further or faster than we are
willing to accept. They are so
horrible and so intriguing (cf.
Bowie in Elephant Man and
Scary Monsters) because they
represent a forbidden glimpse
at possible futures. The driving
force behind the Mutant's com
position and performance estab
lishes firmly that they are still
at the crest of the wave. What
this means for the success of
their album in a world where
"the scene is LA" is uncertain:
Bob Mutant admits that "the
world isn't going to change for
the Mutants. On the other hand,
there'll always be the Mutants
— a couple of Armageddons,
and maybe we'll all be mu
tants."
Maybe next time their record
will be number one in Luxem
bourg. I hear that's a lot bigger
than Liechtenstein.


Steve Goodman, noted singer, guitarist and com
poser, will perform at the Boarding House in San
Francisco this Friday and Saturday. Goodman's
style is a unique mix of country, bluegrass, jug

band, rural and city blues, and Dixieland, and he
has written such classics as 'City of New Orleans.'
The shows each night are at 8 and 11, and tickets go
for $7.50 apiece. See it and get well.

brute originality. With three
singers fronting four musicians,
the opening "Love Song" —
"tell me that you love me" —
sets the tone for the relationship
with the audience. Audience
members occasionally dancing
on stage, and no bouncers toss
ing them onto Clay Street from
the second story plaza? A fifth
singer who only waltzes on stage
in something vaguely looking
leopard-like and half unraveled
to deliver, in all sweetness, de
monic bird trills into a new mi
crophone each time the chorus
comes around? Not likely to be
found in anybody's formula for
success. Consequently, it

works, at least in front of an au
dience this serious about their
fun.
Strictly speaking, the Mu
tants are not waiting for their
first record, but for their first
album. The band has released
two singles, and according to
guitarist Bob Mutant, "about a
year and a half ago, had the
number one song in Liechtens
tein." The anomaly is over
whelming — I try to think of the
gentle peasants and
burgemeisters breaking from

their gentle, patterned folk
dances to the episemantics of
dancing to the Mutants.
It's less hearing the music,
semiotically processing the in
formation, and the brain form
ing and transmitting a set of
commands along appropriate
neurons, than it is touching a
galvanic curent to a nerve in the
leg of a freshly dissected frog. I
can't see it in "Sound of Music"
country.
Bob explained that the infre
quency with which the Mutants
have been playing of late is due
to giving their attention to an
album. Still, the band feels a
need to play live dates to keep

their inspiration level high.
When the Mutants perform, he
says, "we pick up the excite
ment, and we take it into the stu
dio with us — we can still feel
what worked with the audience
when we're in the studio."
The Mutants were in com
plete control of this audience,
but their album would not be one
to play to someone listening to
new wave for the first time.
They do not play the com
mercial game of being on the fr
inge of the movement in an ef
fort to achieve a broad-based
following. Rather, they play
music that demands a rather
substantial appreciation of new
wave as precondition of accep
tance.
Bob recognizes this, and re
lates it to difficulties the Mu
tants were having regarding the
album. "The Mutants have been
on the cutting edge of the scene
for the past couple of years. The
scene now is really LA, and the
Mutants just aren't LA. LA is
the Knack and groups like that,
and we're just not like that."
Human Sexual Response,
however, may succeed before
the general public better than
they did before the crowd at the
Old Waldorf precisely because
they are closer to that scene. It
is not hard to conceive of them
as Boston's answer to the
Knack. Their main problem
seems to be material. They have
some good songs, and lyrics like
"I want to be Jackie
Onassis/want to wear dark sun
glasses/ . . . after my trag
edy/Aristotle take care of me"
are a treat to listen to.
On the other hand, there is no
consistent excitement or com
pulsion to dance. There is a fun
damental incongruity, not so
much in the voices and the lyrics
as the voices and the music.
Maybe voices just aren't sup
posed to be that sweet when the
music is that raw. One keeps
wondering why these voices are
singing these songs. Maybe HSR
considers that their gimmick.
The unusual features of the band
— the four front singers, the
barbershop (Mohawks only)
quartet abilities — are a special
medium, and should be treated
as such. There are special possi
bilities for expression: one
wishes HSR would exploit these
and play songs for a band with
their unique talents rather than
songs anyone else can play. It's
like wasting a David Bowie per
formance of a meaningful play
on Broadway audiences.
If evolution really does ad
vance by successive mutations,
then those we call mutants are
only those who have changed
further or faster than we are
willing to accept. They are so
horrible and so intriguing (cf.
Bowie in Elephant Man and
Scary Monsters) because they
represent a forbidden glimpse
at possible futures. The driving
force behind the Mutant's com
position and performance estab
lishes firmly that they are still
at the crest of the wave. What
this means for the success of
their album in a world where
"the scene is LA" is uncertain:
Bob Mutant admits that "the
world isn't going to change for
the Mutants. On the other hand,
there'll always be the Mutants
— a couple of Armageddons,
and maybe we'll all be mu
tants."
Maybe next time their record
will be number one in Luxem
bourg. I hear that's a lot bigger
than Liechtenstein.


Steve Goodman, noted singer, guitarist and com
poser, will perform at the Boarding House in San
Francisco this Friday and Saturday. Goodman's
style is a unique mix of country, bluegrass, jug

band, rural and city blues, and Dixieland, and he
has written such classics as 'City of New Orleans.'
The shows each night are at 8 and 11, and tickets go
for $7.50 apiece. See it and get well.
The double bill at the Old
Waldorf last Friday pre
sented a rare opportunity
to see two major and contrast
ing approaches of underground
new wave to the commercial
success of so much music
labeled as new wave by over
zealous promoters and over-in
clusive critics.
Human Sexual Response, Fri
day's headliner, is a Boston
based band with a new album,
Figure 14, and a frequently cov
ered single finally starting to
get airplay. They are currently
in the middle of a national pro
motional tour. The hometown
Mutants, on the other hand, are
still wading through legal and
creative hassles before getting
so much as close to vinyl. If the
performances given Friday
night are a reasonable indica
tion, it might well be worth
camping outside the record
store door once for the Mutant's
release and forgoing HSR for at
least the time being.
There are enough similarities
in the bands to make the effects
of the different approaches es
pecially pronounced. Both are
unusually large bands, with non
playing singers fronting nons
inging musicians. Both are from
quaint picturesque bay cities on
coasts where the center of cul
tural and anti-cultural activity
is generally presumed to be in
the megalopolis some hundreds
of miles to the south. This latter
fact alone is often enough to pro
duce a certain amount of ori
ginality and iconoclasm as a
way of defiantly asserting re
gional pride. HSR and the Mu
tants each stand in marked con
trast to the trendier bands mak
ing time, money, and press cov
erage in New York and Los An
geles.
The bands differ dramati
cally in their approaches to new
wave. HSR follows the example
of those who have led the move
to prettiness in new wave mu
sic, a more than occasional
flirtation with power pop, and a
willingness to utilize tricks
learned from smooth mid-'6os
music-establishment rock. The
emphasis on highly structured
vocals characteristic of this ap
proach is raised to the level of
high art by HSR. There is an ov
erwhelming suspicion that
these are all design students
who had 12 years of voice les
sons.
The Mutants, however, rely
on more feeling and honest emo
tion than most commercially
successful bands. The creativity
and complexity derives not
from a conscious overweaving
of patterns, like HSR's, but
from a gut level originality that
just told Fritz Mutant or one of
the other Mutants that he should
put this part in at just this time.
Human Sexual Response
opened the show with "Ex
posure," a "meet the band"
tune that came off better than
most. When the four singers, in
cluding a redhaired woman who
just has to be South Boston
Irish, began their concertedly
disconcerted dancing before the
surprisingly full-sounding
three-piece band behind them,
everyone was more than pass
ingly interested.
But before HSR had gotten
through their second song, sev
eral things became apparent.
The late sound check which had
delayed the start of the first set
for more than an hour was ap
parently not completely suc
cessful, particularly un

fortunate for a group whose
sound depends so heavily on vo
cal precision and subtlety.
More significantly, HSR's act
began to seem like just that : an
act. The first two songs were
both about sex, the first playing
on the title s double entendre,
the second having a lyric
fascination with the question of
"what does it mean to me? what
does it mean to society?" but
sung so rhetorically as to lose
any possible real or parodic
meaning.
The band members, however,
were neither threatening nor
youthful "we're not as innocent
as you think" figures. The talk
of sexuality in the songs wasn't

supported by any image the
group members were able to
project singly or together, and
sex was not so much trivialized
(probably an anticipated com
ment for a new wave band) as
made irrelevant to the per
formance.
This, from a band fronting
four singers who dance con
stantly? Their conception of sex
reeks of predisposed nastiness,
like that of 13-year-old who is
educated by his father's "estab
lishment," Playboy-type porno-

graphic magazines.
HSR's vocals are intricate,
smooth and ultimately over
produced. They have the gener
al tenor of the Cowsills, and one
could easily imagine the As
sociation, another group of mid
60s singers who eventually
sounded too sweet for anyone,
doing some of HSR's vocal
parts. But the Association never
played music like this.
HSR's sound features true
acid rock influence, and lots of
chord changes that someone not
committed to a certain formal
nihilism in music would never
come up with, even in their
worst nightmare. Each of the

musicians keeps the sound im
mediate and a force behind the
vocals, but ultimately that isn't
enough to maintain a consistent
level of excitement.
Granted, when HSR's songs
get to the fast breaks, and they
use their voices as instruments
rather than as parts of a chorus,
the result can be quite im
pressive. But as others from
Boston have said of Galliano
and Quaaludes, you can only do
it so often before it gets old.
If the bizarre, if energetic,
Temptations-like dancing really
does stand for the group as
much as they try to make it part
of their image, then maybe the
whole performance is some-

thing set up and then delivered.
HSR plays music that is staged,
not created; performed, but
seldom played.
A good example of the dif
ferences between the two bands
was in their treatment of the
fairly funky (i.e., played with
more than a 4/4 sense of
rhythm) songs. HSR employs
much more of a Philadelphia
"wall of sound" approach. The
only song on Figure 14 they
didn't write is the classic "Cool
Jerk." The Mutants are much

more visceral. The bass line is
back to the jungle, straight from
the heart, although the band
members were obviously per
formers, they also obviously be
lieve in what they are doing and
in encouraging anyone within
hearing range to dance. Music
to listen, yes, but listen first and
foremost with your feet - the
sound will work its way up to
your ears in no time.
If Human Sexual Response
comes off with more
creativity in terms of
thought and care for design, the
Mutants come off with more

brute originality. With three
singers fronting four musicians,
the opening "Love Song" —
"tell me that you love me" —
sets the tone for the relationship
with the audience. Audience
members occasionally dancing
on stage, and no bouncers toss
ing them onto Clay Street from
the second story plaza? A fifth
singer who only waltzes on stage
in something vaguely looking
leopard-like and half unraveled
to deliver, in all sweetness, de
monic bird trills into a new mi
crophone each time the chorus
comes around? Not likely to be
found in anybody's formula for
success. Consequently, it

works, at least in front of an au
dience this serious about their
fun.
Strictly speaking, the Mu
tants are not waiting for their
first record, but for their first
album. The band has released
two singles, and according to
guitarist Bob Mutant, "about a

number one song in Liechtens
tein." The anomaly is over
whelming — I try to think of the
gentle peasants and
burgemeisters breaking from

their gentle, patterned folk
dances to the episemantics of
dancing to the Mutants.
It's less hearing the music,
semiotically processing the in
formation, and the brain form
ing and transmitting a set of
commands along appropriate
neurons, than it is touching a
galvanic curent to a nerve in the
leg of a freshly dissected frog. I
can't see it in "Sound of Music"
country.
Bob explained that the infre
quency with which the Mutants
have been playing of late is due
to giving their attention to an

their inspiration level high.

duce a certain amount of ori
ginality and iconoclasm as a
way of defiantly asserting re
gional pride. HSR and the Mu
tants each stand in marked con
trast to the trendier bands mak
ing time, money, and press cov
erage in New York and Los An
geles.
The bands differ dramati
cally in their approaches to new
wave. HSR follows the example
of those who have led the move
to prettiness in new wave mu
sic, a more than occasional
flirtation with power pop, and a
willingness to utilize tricks
learned from smooth mid-'6os
music-establishment rock. The
emphasis on highly structured
vocals characteristic of this ap
proach is raised to the level of
high art by HSR. There is an ov
erwhelming suspicion that
these are all design students
who had 12 years of voice les
sons.
The Mutants, however, rely
on more feeling and honest emo
tion than most commercially
successful bands. The creativity
and complexity derives not
from a conscious overweaving
of patterns, like HSR's, but
from a gut level originality that
just told Fritz Mutant or one of
the other Mutants that he should
put this part in at just this time.
Human Sexual Response
opened the show with "Ex
posure," a "meet the band"
tune that came off better than
most. When the four singers, in
cluding a redhaired woman who
just has to be South Boston
Irish, began their concertedly
disconcerted dancing before the
surprisingly full-sounding
three-piece band behind them,
everyone was more than pass
ingly interested.
But before HSR had gotten
through their second song, sev
eral things became apparent.
The late sound check which had
delayed the start of the first set
for more than an hour was ap
parently not completely suc
cessful, particularly un

fortunate for a group whose
sound depends so heavily on vo
cal precision and subtlety.
More significantly, HSR's act
began to seem like just that : an
act. The first two songs were
both about sex, the first playing
on the title s double entendre,
the second having a lyric
fascination with the question of
"what does it mean to me? what
does it mean to society?" but
sung so rhetorically as to lose
any possible real or parodic
meaning.
The band members, however,
were neither threatening nor
youthful "we're not as innocent
as you think" figures. The talk
of sexuality in the songs wasn't

supported by any image the
group members were able to
project singly or together, and
sex was not so much trivialized
(probably an anticipated com
ment for a new wave band) as
made irrelevant to the per
formance.
This, from a band fronting
four singers who dance con
stantly? Their conception of sex

graphic magazines.
HSR's vocals are intricate,
smooth and ultimately over
produced. They have the gener
al tenor of the Cowsills, and one
could easily imagine the As
sociation, another group of mid
60s singers who eventually
sounded too sweet for anyone,
doing some of HSR's vocal
parts. But the Association never
played music like this.
HSR's sound features true
acid rock influence, and lots of
chord changes that someone not
committed to a certain formal
nihilism in music would never
come up with, even in their
worst nightmare. Each of the

musicians keeps the sound im
mediate and a force behind the
vocals, but ultimately that isn't
enough to maintain a consistent
level of excitement.
Granted, when HSR's songs
get to the fast breaks, and they
use their voices as instruments
rather than as parts of a chorus,
the result can be quite im
pressive. But as others from
Boston have said of Galliano
and Quaaludes, you can only do
it so often before it gets old.
If the bizarre, if energetic,
Temptations-like dancing really
does stand for the group as
much as they try to make it part
of their image, then maybe the
whole performance is some-

thing set up and then delivered.
HSR plays music that is staged,
not created; performed, but
seldom played.
A good example of the dif
ferences between the two bands
was in their treatment of the
fairly funky (i.e., played with
more than a 4/4 sense of
rhythm) songs. HSR employs
much more of a Philadelphia
"wall of sound" approach. The
only song on Figure 14 they
didn't write is the classic "Cool
Jerk." The Mutants are much

more visceral. The bass line is
back to the jungle, straight from
the heart, although the band
members were obviously per
formers, they also obviously be
lieve in what they are doing and
in encouraging anyone within
hearing range to dance. Music
to listen, yes, but listen first and
foremost with your feet - the
sound will work its way up to
your ears in no time.
If Human Sexual Response
comes off with more
creativity in terms of
thought and care for design, the
Mutants come off with more

brute originality. With three
singers fronting four musicians,
the opening "Love Song" —
"tell me that you love me" —
sets the tone for the relationship
with the audience. Audience
members occasionally dancing
on stage, and no bouncers toss
ing them onto Clay Street from
the second story plaza? A fifth
singer who only waltzes on stage
in something vaguely looking
leopard-like and half unraveled
to deliver, in all sweetness, de
monic bird trills into a new mi
crophone each time the chorus
comes around? Not likely to be
found in anybody's formula for
success. Consequently, it

works, at least in front of an au
dience this serious about their
fun.
Strictly speaking, the Mu
tants are not waiting for their
first record, but for their first
album. The band has released
two singles, and according to
guitarist Bob Mutant, "about a
year and a half ago, had the
number one song in Liechtens
tein." The anomaly is over
whelming — I try to think of the
gentle peasants and
burgemeisters breaking from

their gentle, patterned folk
dances to the episemantics of
dancing to the Mutants.
It's less hearing the music,
semiotically processing the in
formation, and the brain form
ing and transmitting a set of
commands along appropriate
neurons, than it is touching a
galvanic curent to a nerve in the
leg of a freshly dissected frog. I
can't see it in "Sound of Music"
country.
Bob explained that the infre
quency with which the Mutants
have been playing of late is due
to giving their attention to an
album. Still, the band feels a
need to play live dates to keep

their inspiration level high.
When the Mutants perform, he
says, "we pick up the excite
ment, and we take it into the stu
dio with us — we can still feel
what worked with the audience
when we're in the studio."
The Mutants were in com
plete control of this audience,
but their album would not be one
to play to someone listening to
new wave for the first time.
They do not play the com
mercial game of being on the fr
inge of the movement in an ef
fort to achieve a broad-based
following. Rather, they play
music that demands a rather
substantial appreciation of new
wave as precondition of accep
tance.
Bob recognizes this, and re
lates it to difficulties the Mu
tants were having regarding the
album. "The Mutants have been
on the cutting edge of the scene
for the past couple of years. The
scene now is really LA, and the
Mutants just aren't LA. LA is
the Knack and groups like that,
and we're just not like that."
Human Sexual Response,
however, may succeed before
the general public better than
they did before the crowd at the
Old Waldorf precisely because
they are closer to that scene. It
is not hard to conceive of them
as Boston's answer to the
Knack. Their main problem
seems to be material. They have
some good songs, and lyrics like
"I want to be Jackie
Onassis/want to wear dark sun
glasses/ . . . after my trag
edy/Aristotle take care of me"
are a treat to listen to.
On the other hand, there is no
consistent excitement or com
pulsion to dance. There is a fun
damental incongruity, not so
much in the voices and the lyrics
as the voices and the music.
Maybe voices just aren't sup
posed to be that sweet when the
music is that raw. One keeps
wondering why these voices are
singing these songs. Maybe HSR
considers that their gimmick.
The unusual features of the band
— the four front singers, the
barbershop (Mohawks only)
quartet abilities — are a special
medium, and should be treated
as such. There are special possi
bilities for expression: one
wishes HSR would exploit these
and play songs for a band with
their unique talents rather than
songs anyone else can play. It's
like wasting a David Bowie per
formance of a meaningful play
on Broadway audiences.
If evolution really does ad
vance by successive mutations,
then those we call mutants are
only those who have changed
further or faster than we are
willing to accept. They are so
horrible and so intriguing (cf.
Bowie in Elephant Man and
Scary Monsters) because they
represent a forbidden glimpse
at possible futures. The driving
force behind the Mutant's com
position and performance estab
lishes firmly that they are still
at the crest of the wave. What
this means for the success of
their album in a world where
"the scene is LA" is uncertain:
Bob Mutant admits that "the
world isn't going to change for
the Mutants. On the other hand,
there'll always be the Mutants
— a couple of Armageddons,
and maybe we'll all be mu
tants."
Maybe next time their record
will be number one in Luxem
bourg. I hear that's a lot bigger
than Liechtenstein.


Steve Goodman, noted singer, guitarist and com
poser, will perform at the Boarding House in San
Francisco this Friday and Saturday. Goodman's
style is a unique mix of country, bluegrass, jug

band, rural and city blues, and Dixieland, and he
has written such classics as 'City of New Orleans.'
The shows each night are at 8 and 11, and tickets go
for $7.50 apiece. See it and get well.
The double bill at the Old
Waldorf last Friday pre
sented a rare opportunity
to see two major and contrast
ing approaches of underground
new wave to the commercial
success of so much music
labeled as new wave by over
zealous promoters and over-in
clusive critics.
Human Sexual Response, Fri
day's headliner, is a Boston
based band with a new album,
Figure 14, and a frequently cov
ered single finally starting to
get airplay. They are currently
in the middle of a national pro
motional tour. The hometown
Mutants, on the other hand, are
still wading through legal and
creative hassles before getting
so much as close to vinyl. If the
performances given Friday
night are a reasonable indica
tion, it might well be worth
camping outside the record
store door once for the Mutant's
release and forgoing HSR for at
least the time being.
There are enough similarities
in the bands to make the effects
of the different approaches es
pecially pronounced. Both are
unusually large bands, with non
playing singers fronting nons
inging musicians. Both are from
quaint picturesque bay cities on
coasts where the center of cul
tural and anti-cultural activity
is generally presumed to be in
the megalopolis some hundreds
of miles to the south. This latter
fact alone is often enough to pro
duce a certain amount of ori
ginality and iconoclasm as a
way of defiantly asserting re
gional pride. HSR and the Mu
tants each stand in marked con
trast to the trendier bands mak
ing time, money, and press cov
erage in New York and Los An
geles.
The bands differ dramati
cally in their approaches to new
wave. HSR follows the example
of those who have led the move
to prettiness in new wave mu
sic, a more than occasional
flirtation with power pop, and a
willingness to utilize tricks
learned from smooth mid-'6os
music-establishment rock. The
emphasis on highly structured
vocals characteristic of this ap
proach is raised to the level of
high art by HSR. There is an ov
erwhelming suspicion that
these are all design students
who had 12 years of voice les

can't see it in "Sound of Music"
country.
Bob explained that the infre
quency with which the Mutants
have been playing of late is due
to giving their attention to an
album. Still, the band feels a
need to play live dates to keep

their inspiration level high.
When the Mutants perform, he
says, "we pick up the excite
ment, and we take it into the stu
dio with us — we can still feel
what worked with the audience
when we're in the studio."
The Mutants were in com
plete control of this audience,
but their album would not be one
to play to someone listening to
new wave for the first time.
They do not play the com
mercial game of being on the fr
inge of the movement in an ef
fort to achieve a broad-based
following. Rather, they play
music that demands a rather
substantial appreciation of new
wave as precondition of accep
tance.
Bob recognizes this, and re
lates it to difficulties the Mu
tants were having regarding the
album. "The Mutants have been
on the cutting edge of the scene
for the past couple of years. The
scene now is really LA, and the
Mutants just aren't LA. LA is
the Knack and groups like that,
and we're just not like that."
Human Sexual Response,
however, may succeed before
the general public better than
they did before the crowd at the
Old Waldorf precisely because
they are closer to that scene. It
is not hard to conceive of them
as Boston's answer to the
Knack. Their main problem
seems to be material. They have
some good songs, and lyrics like
"I want to be Jackie
Onassis/want to wear dark sun
glasses/ . . . after my trag
edy/Aristotle take care of me"
are a treat to listen to.
On the other hand, there is no
consistent excitement or com
pulsion to dance. There is a fun
damental incongruity, not so
much in the voices and the lyrics
as the voices and the music.
Maybe voices just aren't sup
posed to be that sweet when the
music is that raw. One keeps
wondering why these voices are
singing these songs. Maybe HSR
considers that their gimmick.
The unusual features of the band
— the four front singers, the
barbershop (Mohawks only)
quartet abilities — are a special
medium, and should be treated
as such. There are special possi
bilities for expression: one
wishes HSR would exploit these
and play songs for a band with
their unique talents rather than
songs anyone else can play. It's
like wasting a David Bowie per
formance of a meaningful play
on Broadway audiences.
If evolution really does ad
vance by successive mutations,
then those we call mutants are
only those who have changed
further or faster than we are
willing to accept. They are so
horrible and so intriguing (cf.
Bowie in Elephant Man and
Scary Monsters) because they
represent a forbidden glimpse
at possible futures. The driving
force behind the Mutant's com
position and performance estab
lishes firmly that they are still
at the crest of the wave. What
this means for the success of
their album in a world where
"the scene is LA" is uncertain:
Bob Mutant admits that "the
world isn't going to change for
the Mutants. On the other hand,
there'll always be the Mutants
— a couple of Armageddons,
and maybe we'll all be mu
tants."
Maybe next time their record
will be number one in Luxem
bourg. I hear that's a lot bigger
than Liechtenstein.


Steve Goodman, noted singer, guitarist and com
poser, will perform at the Boarding House in San
Francisco this Friday and Saturday. Goodman's
style is a unique mix of country, bluegrass, jug

band, rural and city blues, and Dixieland, and he
has written such classics as 'City of New Orleans.'
The shows each night are at 8 and 11, and tickets go
for $7.50 apiece. See it and get well.
The double bill at the Old
Waldorf last Friday pre
sented a rare opportunity
to see two major and contrast
ing approaches of underground
new wave to the commercial
success of so much music
labeled as new wave by over
zealous promoters and over-in
clusive critics.
Human Sexual Response, Fri
day's headliner, is a Boston
based band with a new album,
Figure 14, and a frequently cov
ered single finally starting to
get airplay. They are currently
in the middle of a national pro
motional tour. The hometown
Mutants, on the other hand, are
still wading through legal and
creative hassles before getting
so much as close to vinyl. If the
performances given Friday
night are a reasonable indica
tion, it might well be worth
camping outside the record
store door once for the Mutant's
release and forgoing HSR for at
least the time being.
There are enough similarities
in the bands to make the effects
of the different approaches es
pecially pronounced. Both are
unusually large bands, with non
playing singers fronting nons
inging musicians. Both are from
quaint picturesque bay cities on
coasts where the center of cul
tural and anti-cultural activity
is generally presumed to be in
the megalopolis some hundreds
of miles to the south. This latter
fact alone is often enough to pro
duce a certain amount of ori
ginality and iconoclasm as a
way of defiantly asserting re
gional pride. HSR and the Mu
tants each stand in marked con
trast to the trendier bands mak
ing time, money, and press cov
erage in New York and Los An
geles.
The bands differ dramati
cally in their approaches to new
wave. HSR follows the example
of those who have led the move
to prettiness in new wave mu
sic, a more than occasional
flirtation with power pop, and a
willingness to utilize tricks
learned from smooth mid-'6os
music-establishment rock. The
emphasis on highly structured
vocals characteristic of this ap
proach is raised to the level of
high art by HSR. There is an ov
erwhelming suspicion that
these are all design students
who had 12 years of voice les
sons.
The Mutants, however, rely
on more feeling and honest emo
tion than most commercially
successful bands. The creativity
and complexity derives not
from a conscious overweaving
of patterns, like HSR's, but
from a gut level originality that
just told Fritz Mutant or one of
the other Mutants that he should
put this part in at just this time.
Human Sexual Response
opened the show with "Ex
posure," a "meet the band"
tune that came off better than
most. When the four singers, in
cluding a redhaired woman who
just has to be South Boston
Irish, began their concertedly
disconcerted dancing before the
surprisingly full-sounding
three-piece band behind them,
everyone was more than pass
ingly interested.
But before HSR had gotten
through their second song, sev
eral things became apparent.
The late sound check which had
delayed the start of the first set
for more than an hour was ap
parently not completely suc
cessful, particularly un

fortunate for a group whose
sound depends so heavily on vo
cal precision and subtlety.
More significantly, HSR's act
began to seem like just that : an
act. The first two songs were
both about sex, the first playing
on the title s double entendre,
the second having a lyric
fascination with the question of
"what does it mean to me? what
does it mean to society?" but
sung so rhetorically as to lose
any possible real or parodic
meaning.
The band members, however,
were neither threatening nor
youthful "we're not as innocent
as you think" figures. The talk
of sexuality in the songs wasn't

supported by any image the
group members were able to
project singly or together, and
sex was not so much trivialized
(probably an anticipated com
ment for a new wave band) as
made irrelevant to the per
formance.
This, from a band fronting
four singers who dance con
stantly? Their conception of sex
reeks of predisposed nastiness,
like that of 13-year-old who is
educated by his father's "estab
lishment," Playboy-type porno-

graphic magazines.
HSR's vocals are intricate,
smooth and ultimately over
produced. They have the gener
al tenor of the Cowsills, and one
could easily imagine the As
sociation, another group of mid
60s singers who eventually
sounded too sweet for anyone,
doing some of HSR's vocal
parts. But the Association never
played music like this.
HSR's sound features true
acid rock influence, and lots of
chord changes that someone not
committed to a certain formal
nihilism in music would never
come up with, even in their
worst nightmare. Each of the

musicians keeps the sound im
mediate and a force behind the
vocals, but ultimately that isn't
enough to maintain a consistent
level of excitement.
Granted, when HSR's songs
get to the fast breaks, and they
use their voices as instruments
rather than as parts of a chorus,
the result can be quite im
pressive. But as others from
Boston have said of Galliano
and Quaaludes, you can only do
it so often before it gets old.
If the bizarre, if energetic,
Temptations-like dancing really
does stand for the group as
much as they try to make it part
of their image, then maybe the
whole performance is some-

thing set up and then delivered.
HSR plays music that is staged,
not created; performed, but
seldom played.
A good example of the dif
ferences between the two bands
was in their treatment of the
fairly funky (i.e., played with
more than a 4/4 sense of
rhythm) songs. HSR employs
much more of a Philadelphia
"wall of sound" approach. The
only song on Figure 14 they
didn't write is the classic "Cool
Jerk." The Mutants are much

more visceral. The bass line is
back to the jungle, straight from
the heart, although the band
members were obviously per
formers, they also obviously be
lieve in what they are doing and
in encouraging anyone within
hearing range to dance. Music
to listen, yes, but listen first and
foremost with your feet - the
sound will work its way up to
your ears in no time.
If Human Sexual Response
comes off with more
creativity in terms of
thought and care for design, the
Mutants come off with more

brute originality. With three
singers fronting four musicians,
the opening "Love Song" —
"tell me that you love me" —
sets the tone for the relationship
with the audience. Audience
members occasionally dancing
on stage, and no bouncers toss
ing them onto Clay Street from
the second story plaza? A fifth
singer who only waltzes on stage
in something vaguely looking
leopard-like and half unraveled
to deliver, in all sweetness, de
monic bird trills into a new mi
crophone each time the chorus
comes around? Not likely to be
found in anybody's formula for
success. Consequently, it

works, at least in front of an au
dience this serious about their
fun.
Strictly speaking, the Mu
tants are not waiting for their
first record, but for their first
album. The band has released
two singles, and according to
guitarist Bob Mutant, "about a
year and a half ago, had the
number one song in Liechtens
tein." The anomaly is over
whelming — I try to think of the
gentle peasants and
burgemeisters breaking from

their gentle, patterned folk
dances to the episemantics of
dancing to the Mutants.
It's less hearing the music,
semiotically processing the in
formation, and the brain form
ing and transmitting a set of
commands along appropriate
neurons, than it is touching a
galvanic curent to a nerve in the
leg of a freshly dissected frog. I
can't see it in "Sound of Music"
country.
Bob explained that the infre
quency with which the Mutants
have been playing of late is due
to giving their attention to an
