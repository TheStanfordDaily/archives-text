# Singin' ain't Steve Cropper's Thang
## 
### David Schmelzer 
Many a successful solo
musician has spent
years learning the
nuances of the business (either
by working his way up doing stu
dio work or by touring with oth
er bands) before finally making
the move to become a major
musical force in his own right.
Jackson Browne, Barry Manil
ow, and Michael McDonald are
three who come quickly to
mind; all honed their skills in
this fashion. But for each of
these there are two Bob
Welches or Randy Meisners
who, although valuable mem
bers of a band, somehow didn't
have the makeup of a solo artist.
Steve Cropper, unless he
makes some changes in his ap
proach on his next album, would
seem to fit into the latter group.
The approach Cropper takes
with his current (and first) solo
album, Plavin' My Thang,
seems to be almost coun
terproductive considering his
experience and talents. Here is
a man who has been playing
guitar for well over a decade
with bands like Booker T. and
the MGs, a top instrumental
group. In addition the MGs hit
"Green Onions," (co-written by
Cropper), was recently remade
by the group for which he is now
most well-known, The Blues
Brothers — an act that may be a
joke in many ways, but is
backed by one of the finest blues
ensembles in recent memory.
Cropper has done almost ev
erything musically — played
guitar for Rod Stewart, worked
percussion on his current
album, produced records for
The Temptations and Tower of
Power among others, and writ
ten music — everything except
sing, which he admits not to
have done seriously since high
school. So when he decides to
not only include, but also to per
form lead vocals on all nine of
the pieces here, it is not surpris
ing that his one area of inex
perience shows glaringly. But
still, no amount of under
standing will make Playin' My
Thang any easier to listen to,
and on this work, listening is
often a painful experience.
It's a shame too, because

Cropper's woeful baritone tends
to overshadow the good things
that he's done with the album.
His arrangements and guitar
playing, particularly on the title
song and on. "Fly" are top
notch, and the six sorgs that he
wrote for the album are, in gen
eral, better at least than those
he didn't write. Although he pro
fesses to write mainstream,
commercial music (a first in an
industry where the norm is to
deny that the tastes of the public
exist and that "artistic sensi
bilities" rule one's judgment),
Cropper shows some variety.
The song "Fly" in particular
is not centered in the main
stream. It's a breezy jazz tune
with a well-orchestrated begin
ning which, if sung by someone
else or left as an instrumental,
could be a great song.
Likewise, a better vocalist
would make "Give 'Em What
They Want" could be an above
average rock number. It has an
intriguing message about keep
ing power in personal rela
tionships and a good, catchy
melody. But with its vocal hand
icap it can't be considered bet
ter than mediocre.
In an interview last week,
Cropper said that he intends to
include some instrumentals on
his next album. But it's ap
parent that whether he ever gets
that chance will depend heavily
on the success of Playin' My
Thang — a prospect that, con
trary to what he contends,
doesn't look too good. Although
he's no newcomer to the musi
cal world, neither his name nor
his work is familiar enough to
sell albums on reputation alone,
so he has to exploit other ave
nues. But, at present, he has no
plans for a promotional tour.
True, a single has been chosen
for release (the title song), but
because of its vocal liability it is
unlikely to catch on without a
major effort by his label, MCA,
to get it heavy airplay: and even
this would only give it an uphill
chance at popularity. So Crop
per is left with chance, happen
stance, and over-the-counter
sales — something MCA has ob
viously not forgotten about by

giving the album a gaudy yellow
jacket. Even here he is at a dis
advantage however: Tower
Records, one of the nation's
largest chains, has refused to
stock any MCA records because
of a contract squabble.
So "The Colonel," as The
Blues Brothers refer to Crop
per, is in a difficult position with
his first album. Someday Amer
ica might be in for some great
music from this unquestionably
talented man, but only if he has
the wisdom to strengthen or
abolish his vocals, and only if
MCA provides his more effort
and money on his next work for
packaging, touring, and other
promotion. Without these ele
ments, Steve Cropper may soon
be back working for other musi
cians.
