# Venez Chez Nous
## 
### 
It's Saturday night and you are contemplating a date with
your new next-door neighbor, but somehow neither the
"Goose" nor the "0" sound too appealing. Or maybe
you've been studying and would like to go somewhere and so
cialize with friends for a while. Or perhaps you're just looking
for a fun place to enjoy good desserts and coffee after a movie
t or the Pizzeria. The place to go is Chez-Nous. Chez-Nous, or
ganized and run by La Maison Francaise (The French House)
every Saturday night, offers you the atmosphere and setting
of a French cafe right here on campus. Candlelit tables and a
! cozy fireplace create an ambience of charm and intimacy. To
add to the mood, there's live entertainment from various lo
cal musicians. And, of course, our French homemade des
serts are guaranteed to impress even the most gourmet
! palate.
Breaking for finals and spring vacation, Chez-Nous will re
sume business on April 4. So stop by Chez-Nous at the French
House, 610 Mayfield, any time between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. on
! Saturday night and discover the quaint setting of a French
cafe.
