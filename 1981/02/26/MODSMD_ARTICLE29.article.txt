# Theater, that is
## Jed Clampett softshoes to Orpheum 
### Andrew Shields 
At the outset there is something innately disturb
ing about seeing a musical you know was pro
duced and co-written by Jed Clampett. Perhaps
Buddy Ebsen should have stuck with bubbling crude;
with a few exceptions, the dialogue in Turn to the Right
is not particularly clever, nor are the songs particular
ly interesting.
But it is a fun musical. It has that kind of innocent
screwball corniness that makes it easy to overlook its
many flaws. Originally written in 1916, Turn to the
Right has been rewritten, updated and set to music by
Buddy Ebsen and Zeke Manners.
The show, now set in the '20s, concerns Joe, a hand
some, clean-cut young man who has just been released
from Sing Sing (bum rap), and Gilly and Muggs. an Ab
bott-and-Costello pair of hardened but lovable crimi
nals who were friends with Joe behind bars ("pen
pals"). Joe returns home ("up the river to the first
bend turn to the right") only to find the family peach
farm, which has been run during Joe's absence by his
mother and two sisters, about to be signed over to the
evil and money-hungry Deacon Tillinger to pay off a
$125 debt.
Gilly and Muggs use previously acquired skills to
come up with the money but Joe is too honest to allow
that and besides, Joe is in love with Deacon Tillinger's
beautiful daughter Elsie but Tillinger will only allow

Elsie to marry a man of wealth and social standing like
Morgan from New York but Morgan won't have any
money until he makes up with his father but meanwhile
Elsie has gone to Paris and a New York detective has
discovered Gilly and Muggs who have fallen in love
with Joe's sisters and Joe's mom still makes the best
peach preserves in the whole state.
It gets more complicated from here.
Its complexity is, in fact, one of the problems with
this musical. There are just too many loose ends to be
following at once, and it takes too long to tie them all
up. More than 2\z hours long, not including in
termission, the play makes it difficult to remember and
concentrate on all the subplots at once.
Turn to the Right drags quite badly in some places,
especially just after the beginning of each act. Betty
i Joe's sister) goes into an effusive "My Mom," which
does little except make you wonder why Mother hasn't
been sainted. Things pick up eventually, and (sur
prise!) everything comes out for the best in the end.
(The finale, a follow-the-bouncing-laser-beam sing
along of the theme song "Turn to the Right" was, how
ever. a bit more than I could take.)
The music, adhering strictly to 1920'5-style idioms,
adds a kind of cute triteness, but becomes very repeti
tive somewhere around the twelfth of the 20 songs.
There are some nice numbers, however. In particular,
"The World is my Private Preserve," sung by Tillinger
(Robert Miller Driscoll) has some very clever lyrics

("I have spent my life doing good deeds ... the sig
nable kind"). "Someone Else's Beau," sung by Jessie
(Joe's other sister), is a beautiful song, made even
more beautiful by the smoothness and purity of soprano
Lisa Cutler's voice. Orchestrations are very good, and
with the exception of an overzealous drummer who on
occasion drowns out the singers, the orchestra is well
balanced and, on the whole well-behaved.
Casting is excellent. Each person is very com
fortable in his or her role, and there are no weak per
formances. Jan Clayton, as Joe's mom, is particularly
strong. She exudes a chicken-soup personality which
wins the hearts of everyone, including the gruff detec
tive from New York; it's even enough to make Gilly and
Muggs go straight.
The greatest weaknesses are in the script and songs.
As both producer and co-writer, Buddy Ebsen has a
clear perspective of neither role. The script needs to be
trimmed, some songs need to be eliminated, and the
plot needs to be simplified. Judging from the scenes
that were eliminated ( appearing in the program but not
on stage) and the rearrangements in song order, the
show is still being worked on. This is encouraging; be
cause Turn to the Right is not that far from being a
great show. It's still a fun evening's entertainment; if
you can bear with some slow moments and some simi
lar-sounding songs, it might just be worth going to see.
Turn to the Right runs through March 1 at the Or
pheum Theatre in San Francisco.
