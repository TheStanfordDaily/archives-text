"If we articulate by our pres
ence natural ways of human
beings relating to one another
... we may be called upon to
solve problems of our com
munities and maybe even the
larger problems of world
peace," said San Francisco Su
pervisor Harry Britt at last
night's forum "Progressive
Analysis and Strategy for the
'80s: The Lesbian and Gay
Movement in America."
Britt was one of four speakers
at the Kresge gathering, spon
sored by Stanford Progressive
Alliance (SPA) and the Stanford
Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE). Other members
of the panel included Amber
Hollibaugh and Jeff Escoffier,
editors of The Socialist Review,
and Gwen Craig, president of
the Harvey Milk Democratic
Club.
Craig and Escoffier spoke on
gay history, and traced the gay
political movement, while
Hollibaugh and Britt addressed
future issues, and possible
trends in existing gay political
organizations.
Craig traced gay political his
tory from its origins in Chicago
in 1924, up to 1969. She quoted
from day American History:
lesbians and day Men in the
USA by Jonathan Katz, and
cited the two main gay political
organizations during those dec
ades, Mattachine, and the
Daughters of Bilitis (DOB). •
According to Craig, Mat
tachine originated in 1950, and
its first convention in 1953 in Los
Angeles drew approximately
500 people. Craig also men
tioned that Mattachine had been
an organization primarily for
gay men. and that because there
was no comparable organiza
tion for lesbians, several wom
en in San Francisco joined to
gether in 1955 and formed DOB.
"The Mattachine and DOB
were very necessary to the or
ganizing that has gotten us
where we are today," stated
Craig.
Escoffier discussed political
organization from 1969 on, and
stressed the importance of the

new tactics during this period.
"Political emancipation
came to be when men and wom
en came out and said, 'I am
queer,' " said Escoffier. "Com
ing out was also a signal to those
that were isolated in their fami
lies, who were alone and thought
that they were the only ones who
felt as they did," explained
Escoffier.
"Gay migration (to major
cities like San Francisco, Los
Angeles and New York) was an
unanticipated result of the com
ing out strategy," stated Escof
fier.
Hollibaugh, a grass roots or
ganizer of the 'No on 6' cam
paign in the 1979 elections,
spoke on her experiences in or
gainzing gay men and women
for the campaign against the
proposition which would have
prohibited gays from teaching
in public schools.
"We were organizing people
who could not leave, for what
ever economic or social rea
sons, the small towns they lived
in," Hollibaugh explained,
"People would often experience
ecomomic and social per
secutions for supporting the
movement, not to mention the
persecution of their children
and even of their friends."
In addressing the future,
Hollibaugh said, "It is not just a
question of whether the right
will attack us, but of how we
choose to live in our own com
munities . . . how we chose to
confront ourselves in our own
sexual identities."
Britt spoke on the broad view
of the gay movement, saying,
"Homophobia is the result of
sexism, anti-'sex'ism. Behind
sexism is the very basic prob
lem for everybody — for women
and for other victims of sex
ism."
"We have to say we don't
want to be treated just like you
treat one another (straight
males), instead, we want you to
change the way you treat us and
each other," stated Britt, "We
must raise basic issues such as
childraising, the breakdown of
the nuclear family, and reinte
grating senior citizens into our
society."
