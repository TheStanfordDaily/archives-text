# Tonight's student one-acts are (gasp) good

### Stephen Nash 
Most plays seen at Stan
ford are imported from
elsewhere; rarely are
plays produced which are fine
tuned to the attitudes of this
campus. For the first time in
more than 10 years. Ram's
Head is producing an evening of
one-act plays by student au
thors.
There is a lot of energy in this
production , there is also a lot of
good writing. The dialogue is re
markably natural and there is a
good feeling for the theatre idi
om — rare in this age of film. It
would be difficult to guess that
none of the authors had ever had
a play produced before.
"When You Get to Butte,

Don't Send Me Any Postcards,"
by Terence Ross and Russell
Leavitt, is a comedy about a
small-town boy from Butte,
Montana trying to make it in the
Big City. While reading in a li
brary, he is approached by a
young woman whose hobby is
Butte.
"Butte" has many echoes of
other writers. Two of the more
obvious ones are Woody Allen
(in his early plays) and Rod
Serling (in "The Twilight
Zone"). Ross and Leavitt have
many original approaches to
comedy, though, particularly in
the early scenes.
The acting is generally well
thought out. Randy Smith (as
Daniel) does a good job at grad
ually becoming aware of his sit

uation. Judy Moreland (as
Lucy) has a more challenging
role. Because of the many plot
twists, she must be credible as
many different characters. She
is usually impressive, but her
nagging scenes lack believ
ability.
"Role Call" by Jay Martel is
about the breakup of a love af
fair. Mark and Allison see their
lives in terms of the roles they
play every day (as professor
and writer/housewife) as well
as by fantasizing themselves
into the roles of well-known Hol
lywood and TV couples. They
have long-since ceased to be
able to talk honestly to each oth
er; they can only act out scenes
with the help of costumes,
songs, and borrowed scripts.

The only direct communication
is with the audience. It is as if
the two characters have no
direct self-image — their lives
make no sense without the ex
ternal roles.
This is easily the most com
plex of the three productions. It
is full of small-scale production
numbers — an Astaire and Rog
ers dance number, a scene from
Star Trek, a cabaret song, etc,
Tom Wood (sets) and Kathryn
Kelsey (lights) have done a
marvelous job in creating an
endless series of situations on
one stage.
The acting in this play was un
even. Robin Cooper (as Allison)
is excellent at managing the
many transitions required. She
is slick during the role-playing
segments, but she is also honest
and direct in her monologues.
Her speeches are full of well
timed pauses which indicate the
uncertainty of a woman trying
to understand why she is no
longer in love. Paul King (as
Mark) is far less successful. He
has an annoying habit of never
looking at the audience.
"Phelan" by Tom Casciato is
a gentle story of mismatched af
fections. Frank (an out-of-work
cab-driver) is madly in love
with Julie (a dancer) who needs

solitude. Vanessa (a waitress
from Oregon) is in love with
Frank, but he wants only to be
friends. Phelan (an eccentric
warm-hearted rich weight
lifter who lives on potatoes and
nuts) loves Kitty (chief busser
at Trader Vic's), but she only
goes out with him for his money.
"Phelan" is about partially
wise people. Each of the charac
ters has a few insights into how
to make a relationship work, but
they seem unable to apply them
to their own lives. It's only when
they listen to each other that
things start to work out.
Some of the best writing of
the evening is in this play. The
dialogues are very natural and
quietly powerful. The cast (par
ticularly Lianne Klapper as
Vanessa) is sensibly low-key.
It is rare that Stanford gets
the chance to see home-grown
theatre; it is also rare to see
performances of such en
thusiasm and quality. Ram's
Head has given us both together.
Let's hope they do it again soon.

Editor's note: The Winter One-
Acts will be performed tonight
and Saturday at Bp.m. and Fri
day at 7and 10p.m. in the Lit
tle Theatre.

quietly powerful. The cast (par
ticularly Lianne Klapper as
Vanessa) is sensibly low-key.
It is rare that Stanford gets
the chance to see home-grown
theatre; it is also rare to see
performances of such en
thusiasm and quality. Ram's
Head has given us both together.
Let's hope they do it again soon.

Editor's note: The Winter One-
Acts will be performed tonight
and Saturday at Bp.m. and Fri
day at 7and 10p.m. in the Lit
tle Theatre.
Most plays seen at Stan
ford are imported from
elsewhere; rarely are
plays produced which are fine
tuned to the attitudes of this
campus. For the first time in
more than 10 years. Ram's
Head is producing an evening of
one-act plays by student au
thors.
There is a lot of energy in this
production , there is also a lot of
good writing. The dialogue is re
markably natural and there is a
good feeling for the theatre idi
om — rare in this age of film. It
would be difficult to guess that
none of the authors had ever had
a play produced before.
"When You Get to Butte,

Don't Send Me Any Postcards,"
by Terence Ross and Russell
Leavitt, is a comedy about a
small-town boy from Butte,
Montana trying to make it in the
Big City. While reading in a li
brary, he is approached by a
young woman whose hobby is
Butte.
"Butte" has many echoes of
other writers. Two of the more
obvious ones are Woody Allen
(in his early plays) and Rod
Serling (in "The Twilight
Zone"). Ross and Leavitt have
many original approaches to
comedy, though, particularly in
the early scenes.
The acting is generally well
thought out. Randy Smith (as
Daniel) does a good job at grad
ually becoming aware of his sit

uation. Judy Moreland (as
Lucy) has a more challenging
role. Because of the many plot
twists, she must be credible as
many different characters. She
is usually impressive, but her
nagging scenes lack believ
ability.
"Role Call" by Jay Martel is
about the breakup of a love af
fair. Mark and Allison see their
lives in terms of the roles they
play every day (as professor
and writer/housewife) as well
as by fantasizing themselves
into the roles of well-known Hol
lywood and TV couples. They
have long-since ceased to be
able to talk honestly to each oth
er; they can only act out scenes
with the help of costumes,
songs, and borrowed scripts.

The only direct communication
is with the audience. It is as if
the two characters have no
direct self-image — their lives
make no sense without the ex
ternal roles.
This is easily the most com
plex of the three productions. It
is full of small-scale production
numbers — an Astaire and Rog
ers dance number, a scene from
Star Trek, a cabaret song, etc,
Tom Wood (sets) and Kathryn
Kelsey (lights) have done a
marvelous job in creating an
endless series of situations on
one stage.
The acting in this play was un
even. Robin Cooper (as Allison)
is excellent at managing the
many transitions required. She
is slick during the role-playing
segments, but she is also honest
and direct in her monologues.
Her speeches are full of well
timed pauses which indicate the
uncertainty of a woman trying
to understand why she is no
longer in love. Paul King (as
Mark) is far less successful. He
has an annoying habit of never
looking at the audience.
"Phelan" by Tom Casciato is
a gentle story of mismatched af
fections. Frank (an out-of-work
cab-driver) is madly in love
with Julie (a dancer) who needs

solitude. Vanessa (a waitress
from Oregon) is in love with
Frank, but he wants only to be
friends. Phelan (an eccentric
warm-hearted rich weight
lifter who lives on potatoes and
nuts) loves Kitty (chief busser
at Trader Vic's), but she only
goes out with him for his money.
"Phelan" is about partially
wise people. Each of the charac
ters has a few insights into how
to make a relationship work, but
they seem unable to apply them
to their own lives. It's only when
they listen to each other that
things start to work out.
Some of the best writing of
the evening is in this play. The
dialogues are very natural and
quietly powerful. The cast (par
ticularly Lianne Klapper as
Vanessa) is sensibly low-key.
It is rare that Stanford gets
