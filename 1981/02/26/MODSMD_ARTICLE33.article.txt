White against aid to El Salvador
Washington — The former U.S. ambassador to
El Salvador said yesterday that the leftist guer
rilla movement is "broken and declining" and
that any attempt to bolster the government
through large-scale U.S. military aid could
backfire with a right-wing coup.
Robert White, a career diplomat currently here
awaiting reassignment, said "I believe the right
is constantly trying to overthrow the government,
as is the left, and it's a beleaguered government in
the middle."
White, ambassador during the last year of the
administration of then-President Jimmy Carter,
testified to a congressional subcommittee that
"The real threat to the stability of the govern
ment comes not from the left, but from the ex
treme right. The left is broken and declining."
President Ronald Reagan fired White as am
bassador to El Salvador soon after taking office
and officials said one reason was White's public
criticism of events there.
Inflation rate falls below 10%
Washington — The nation's inflation rate fell
below double-digit annual levels in January for
the first time since last summer, as declining food
costs held the increase in consumer prices to 0.7
percent, the Department of Labor reported yes
terday.
Last month's rise, which translated into a 9.1
percent annual rate, stemmed largely from
higher gasoline and fuel oil prices, the depart
ment said.
Bigger increases in the fuel category are ex
pected this month, however. President Ronald
Reagan's order removing controls from oil prices
took effect on Jan. 28 and the subsequent price
rises did not affect the January consumer price in
dex.
Reagan orders more cuts
Washington — The Federal Reserve acted yes
terday to further tighten the nation's money
growth, and its chairman embraced President
Ronald Reagan's budget-cutting program "with

all the ardor I can bring to bear." Later, Reagan
ordered his aides to cut $3 billion to $6 billion more
from the 1982 budget.
Paul Volcker's endorsement of the presidential
package cast aside concerns that the chief ex
ecutive and the independent central bank might
clash over anti-inflation strategy. Instead,
Volcker told Congress that any attempt to whittle
Reagan's proposals would only worsen the econo
my.
But Volcker did caution that the administration
risks raising hopes too high by promising to dra
matically lower inflation and interest rates soon
after Congress enacts the proposals.
Reagan favors breeder reactor
Washington — President Ronald Reagan favors
completion of the Clinch River breeder reactor
and the "orderly development of nuclear power in
this country," Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker said yesterday.
Baker (R-Tenn.) and Sen. James McClure (R-
Idaho) met with Reagan on the nuclear power top
ic and spoke to reporters afterwards.
McClure played down reports that Energy Sec
retary James Edwards and David Stockman, di
rector of the Office of Management and Budget,
were locked in a fight over how much money to
spend on the development of nuclear power.
Stocks show third straight gain
New York — A surge of buying just before the
close helped the stock market recover from a mid
day selloff to post its third straight gain yester
day.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off
more than 10 points at 2 p.m., sported an 8.30 gain
at 954.40 by the close. Since the start of the week
the average has risen 18.31 points.
Today's weather
Mostly sunny today after a chance of morning
showers. Variable clouds and a chance of showers
again late tonight and tomorrow. Highs in the 50s
and mid 50s. Lows tonight in the upper 30s and 40s.
Southerly winds to 15 mph. Chance of measurable

ordered his aides to cut $3 billion to $6 billion more
from the 1982 budget.
Paul Volcker's endorsement of the presidential

ecutive and the independent central bank might

Volcker told Congress that any attempt to whittle
Reagan's proposals would only worsen the econo
my.
But Volcker did caution that the administration
risks raising hopes too high by promising to dra
matically lower inflation and interest rates soon
after Congress enacts the proposals.
