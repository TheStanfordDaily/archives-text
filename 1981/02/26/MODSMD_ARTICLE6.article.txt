Financial aids,
fraternities, overseas
studies, housing and married
students. Today's Stanford
Daily Magazine covers a
broad spectrum of university
life.
We have tried to present
more than just the day-to
day news that fills the pages
of most newspapers
nationwide. By devoting
more time, and considerably
more space, to specific
issues that are important
and interesting to the
community that the Daily
serves, we hope to increase
the reader's understanding
of his local environment.
This magazine also
represents a concerted
effort to combine
meaningful issues,
interesting photography and
graphics, and a more
creative layout than can
normally be found in
everyday issues due to time
and space constraints. We
hope you enjoy the pictures
as well as the words. The
photo-feature on little-known
places at Stanford was
created as an attempt at
making journalism more
aesthetic.
Although the stories are
written more with an
undergraduate perspective
on campus life, a handicap
most student-run papers
suffer from, the articles on

financial aids and married
students are also directed at
the general community.
Financial aids draws 5
percent of the University's
operating budget each year
and thus diverts money away
from salary increases or
departmental expansion.
But it also enables students,
rich and poor alike, to mix in
a diverse environment,
thereby enhancing the basic
academic functions of this
campus.
Married students do not
have a high visibility among
undergraduates, although a
good number of
undergraduates are
married. Students of any age
and marital status, however,
face the many pressures of
the competitive academic
environment. Married
students must cope with
these, and the added burdens
of wedlock. Of course, they
also share the benefits of
companionship and devotion,
sought by most people,
whether married or
unmarried.
We have enjoyed
coordinating this magazine
and working with its
contributors, and hope that it
holds something stimulating
or just pleasant, for every
reader.
