# Where do students on other campuses live?
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
Those of you living off cam
pus, not by choice, may
wonder how your situation
compares to that of students at
other universities in the area
and across the country.
Housing is tight at many uni
versities, but some, including
Harvard and Duke, manage to
house almost all of their under
graduates. At others such as
UC-Berkeley, USC and North
western, the demand for hous
ing is greater than the supply.
If you had chosen to attend
UC-Berkeley, chances are you'd
be living off campus two, three
or maybe all four years. Cal
may house The Axe, but it can
only accommodate 8200 of its
30,000 students.
At Cal only 3200 under
graduates live in university-op
erated residence halls, and this
year there were 8000 applica
tions for those spaces. Another
1500 students live in privately
owned co-ops on campus, and
2000 to 2500 live in fraternities
and sororities. Many of the stu
dents are from the the Bay Area
and 15 percent live at home.
The graduate housing there is
equally sparse. For its 9000
graduate students, Cal has only
an International House which
holds 560 and apartments for
families that house 1022 stu
dents.
USC houses only 5000 of its
12,000 undergraduates in univer
sity-operated dorms and apart
ments, and the demand for
these spaces is high. Tony Valle
jo, manager of the housing as
signment and collection offices,
said, "Last semester we had

quite a crunch."
The Greek system is popular
at USC and the 26 fraternities
and 13 sororities provide hous
ing for another 2000 students.
Most graduate students have to
fend for themselves. USC has
one apartment complex with 325
spaces. It houses juniors and
seniors as well as graduate stu
dents. Some graduates students
also live in the university-run
apartments on campus, and are
given priority over under
graduates for housing.
Universities in California do
not have a monopoly on the stu
dent housing shortage. North
western University in
Evanston, Illinois, can accom
modate only half of its 6500 un
dergraduates. Fraternities and
sororities house 1400, and the
rest of the students live off cam
pus or commute from home.
Northwestern's 3200 graduate
students are provided for the
least. There are just two resi
dences for graduates that can
house only 450 students.
But not all schools are in such
bad shape. At Duke University
in Durham, North Carolina,
freshmen are guaranteed four
years of university housing.
Duke has accomplished this by
converting many singles into
doubles and doubles into triples.
Barbara Buschman, student
housing coordinator for under
graduates, said, "We have trou
ble every year squashing them
in."
However there is a catch.
When students move off
campus at Duke they for
feit their guarantees and can
only move back on campus if
there are extra spaces. So it is

virtually impossible to live off
campus one year and then move
back on the next.
Harvard scores higher than
Stanford on housing avail
ability. It houses all but 300 of its
6700 undergraduates. All stu
dents under the age of 20 must
live on campus, and students
must receive university per
mission to move off campus.
Harvard's law and business
schools have residences for
their first-year students, and
the university owns many build
ings in the area which are used
by Harvard affiliates, including

graduate students.
Other schools have had no
luck coming up with a system
for assigning housing better
than Stanford's housing draw.
UC-Berkeley assigns housing
in a lottery similar to Stan
ford's. Students there can list
several housing choices and,
based on their lottery number,
are given as close to their top
preference as possible — until
the number of spaces runs out.
Freshman have a better chance
of getting housing because 65
percent of the rooms are re
served for new students.
USC has a lottery similar to
Stanford's, but priority for
housing is assigned on a dif
ferent basis. Beginning next
fall, housing priority will be
based on students' proximity to
campus. Freshmen and stu
dents outside a 20-mile air-radi
us of campus are given first
priority.
Duke and Northwestern both
have lotteries in which every
student receives a number and
students wishing to live togeth
er can use the best number of
the group. With this system, the
student who gets a good number
may suddenly find he has many
new friends who want to room
with him.
Harvard's lottery works the
same way as Stanford's: stu
dents wishing to room together
receive the same lottery
number.
Room and board rates for stu

dents at other universities are
comparable to those on The
Farm.
Here, students will pay $2577
this year for the average dorm
room and 19 meals per week.
Cal students pay slightly less —
$2240 per year for a room and 20
meals per week.
At USC, room and board in
a typical dorm is $2510
per year, and the univer
sity-owned apartments range
from $144 to $203 per month for
rent alone, not including utili
ties or board.
Students at Duke University
will pay $808 per year for board
this year, and room cost varies
from $2800 per year for a single
to $1336 p&r ysar for a triple
At Harvard, room and board
this year cost $2680. The aver
age room and board charge at
Northwestern for a double plus
lunch and dinner six days a week
is $2255.
Of all these schools, Cal has
the largest number of students
living off campus and, as a re
sult, its off campus housing of
fice is a full-scale operation. As
sistant Director of Housing Ser
vices Peggy Dewell said the
housing office posts 60 new off
campus rental listings daily and
100 students visit the office ev
ery day.
Dewell estimated that Cal
students pay from $125 to $175
per month for shared rents in
the area. This is less than the av

erage $200 paid by Stanford stu
dents for off campus shared liv
ing accommodations. The city
of Berkeley has rent control leg
islation so rental prices are
frozen. As a result, the quality
of rented housing is lower than
in the Stanford area, Dewell
said.
Stanford offers nearly every
possible living arrangement.
Although Cal has both single-sex
and co-ed dorms, almost all the
rooms there are doubles and all
are within four-class dorms
with no quota for each class.
USC has both co-ed and sin
gle-sex dorms and the Univer
sity-owned apartments on cam
pus are all co-ed. Duke also has

both single-sex and co-ed
dorms, as well as all-freshmen
dorms.
"Residential education" is
not unique to Stanford. Most
dormitories at Duke belong to
special organizations called fed
erations. A federation is a .croup
of at least four dorms neai each
other, and each federation has
special academic programs in
cluding classes and lecture
series. Federations vary in size,
but most include about 400 stu
dents and each has a faculty ad
visor.
At Harvard, each of the 13
houses for upper
classmen functions some
what like an autonomous col

lege. Each has its own staff,
masters (who are like dorm pa
rents), tutors and dining hall.
Freshmen there live in all
freshmen dorms on the Harvard
Yard. John Howe, assistant to
the dean of students, said
Harvard's theory is to give
freshmen "the Yard expe
rience. '' The other dorms are lo
cated on the Charles River, the
Quadrangle or on the old
Radcliffe campus.
Northwestern has several
types of living arrangements ac
cording to Director of Housing
William Tempelmeyer. But the
majority of the dorms are co-ed
and most are four-class, he said.
