Rising tuition, possible federal funding cuts and
increasing student applications threaten to put
the squeeze on Stanford's financial aids resources

"The few very rich can get their educations any
where. They will be welcome to this institution if
they come, but the object is more particularly to
reach the multitude: those people who have to
consider the expenditure of every dollar."
.Governor Leland Stanford

When the first entering
class arrived at Stan
ford University nearly
100 years ago, college costs
were farthest from the stu
dents' minds. Tuition was free
then, thanks to the large endow
ment provided by Jane and
Leland Stanford.
Today, in increasing num
bers, Stanford students are
turning to financial aid as a
means to help pay for their
education — which next year
will cost more than $10,000 per
student for tuition, room, board
and expenses.
Stanford officials say that in
the future it may become
tougher for the University to
meet the financial needs of all
students. But for now, the Uni
versity's "need-based" policy is
so important to the quality of
education that it will not be
changed.
During the last 15 years, Stan
ford's financial-aids policy has
been to meet the demonstrated
need — as determined by a com
plicated financial form proc
essed by the College Scholarship
Service * CSS i — for aU stu
dents.
To pay for this commitment,
Stanford has had to dip heavily
into its general operating funds.
Increases in federal and state
aid for students during the last
decade, however, have helped
the University meet students'
needs.
Federally Insured Student
Loans, which helped only 673
Stanford student in 1969-70, now
supply about 3000 students with
money to pay college costs. This
represents an increase from
$786,685 in loans in 1969-70 to
about $6 million in 1979. Other
programs have shown similiar
growth. Basic Educational Op
portunity Grants (BEOG) now
provide about 1500 students with
$1.1 million. The program did
not even exist 10 years ago.
But these increases have also
brought a heightened depen

dence on the federal and state
governments.
"The University is no longer
master of its financial aids pro
gram," Financial Aids Director
Robert Huff said. Increases in
aid have also brought "in
creased involvement of the gov
ernment" in the rules and regu
lations of the financial aids
process, he said.
And in 1982, federal involve
ment in the financial aids proc
ess will increase even more
with the implementation of the
Educational Amendments Act
of 1980, Huff said.
The federal government
will be directly respon
sible for determining stu
dent need throught the "con
gressional-methodology," he
said. It will replace the method
ology currently used by the Col
lege Scholarship Service, Huff
said.
Direct federal involvement in
determining need "is a bad de
velopment,'' according to Vince
De Anda, assistant financial
aids director. The methods used
to determine a family's ability
to help pay for a student's
education will be developed by
congressmen and their staffs,
he said.
As a result, it will be more "a
political analysis rather than a
needs analysis," De Anda said.
More students will probably
be eligible for aid under the new
methodology, but at the same
time the federal government ap
parently is not willing to provide
more funds. De Anda said.
"This could create a prob
lem" for the financial aids pro
gram here, he added.
If the new methodology re
duces the expected family con
tribution, "the University will
be hard pressed to meet the
needs of students," Huff
agreed.
Financial aids officials said
they are concerned about the in
creasing drain on the Univer

sity s operating budget. In addi
tion, these officials said they
are watching the Reagan ad
ministration warily, and expect
cuts in some if not all forms of
federal aid.
Student financial aid has
come a long way from those ear
ly days when "The Farm" was
more a home for prize-winning
race horses than for prize-win
ning scholars. But the goal is the
same today as it was then — to
enable students from less privi
leged backgrounds to get a
private education.
About 44 percent of students
are receiving some form of fi
nancial aid, according to Huff,
In 1959-60, just 27 percent of
students were on some form
of aid, according to Tjeerd
VanAndel, chairman of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(C-UAFA). That figure rose to
34 percent in 1964-65, to 40 per
cent in 1969-70 and to 45 percent
in 1974-75. The percentage has
remained fairly constant during
the past eight years, he said.
After several years in which
there was no real growth in the
number of financial aids ap
plications, "last year there was
an increase in applications for
matriculated students (those al-

ready enrolled), Huff said.
However, the exact size of the
increase has not yet been
documented, he said.
The "psychological effect of
costs rising over the $10,000 bar
rier" may be the reason for the
increase, Huff said.
Many more students are com
ing in seeking aid now than
three years ago, Financial Aids
Counselor Rose Ferri agreed.
Students that used to only ap
ply for guaranteed loans are
now telling the financial-aids
department that they want to
apply for other forms of aid as
well, she said.
Entering freshmen are some
what more concerned about fi
nancing their college education
this year than in 1978, a ques
tionnaire completed by 1262 of
1500 entering freshmen shows.
While the percentage that in
dicated financing college was of
major concern remained steady
at 11.9 percent, the proportion of
students expressing some con
cern has risen from 50.6 percent
to 55 percent.
The survey results also show
that 12 percent of the freshmen
reported receiving state schol
arships or grants worth more
than $2000, and 28 percent re
ceive college grants amounting
to more than $2000
This year Stanford will give
about $13 million in schol
arship aid to under
graduates. Huff said.
Of that, $4 4 million will come
from the general operating
fund. $2 6 million will come in
the form of gift and endowment
money donated to the Univer
sity specifically for student aid.
nearly $2 million will come from
the state in the form of Califor
nia state scholarships, and the
rest will come from the federal
government's Basic Educa
tional Opportunities Grants
(BEOG) and other outside
awards, he said
Financial aid now consumes
about 5 percent of the Univer
sity's general operating budget,

according to Tim Warner of the
University's Office of Man
agement and Budget.
Next year, the general fund's
share will grow to $5 million,
Huff said. This will continue the
upward spiral of recent years.
The general fund commitment
to financial aids jumped 25 per
cent, from $3.5 million in 1979 to
$4.4 million in 1980-81, according
to statistics from the Univer
sity's Office of Management
and Budget.
And during the last 10 years,
the proportion of this general
funding for grant aid has grown

from 24 percent of total aid in
1970-71 to 33 percent for 1980-81.
University gifts and endow
ments, money given specifical
ly for stadent aid, and Cal State
grants have shown significant
decreases as a percentage of
grant aid. Only the Basic
Educational Opportunity
Grants have shown marked in
creases, rising from zero per
cent of the budget in 1970-71 to
the present 8.3 percent.
There is "serious concern"
about this shift toward more
University funding of grant aid
because Stanford is experienc
ing "budget constraints," Huff
said.
The $140 million budget will
be balanced this year, but not
without much scrutiny, he said.
Some departments will not get
all the programs or improve
ments that they would like, he
said.
The growth rate for financial
,need requirements from the
general fund is "of concern" to
budget planners, Warner said.
Grant aid has increased "ex
ponentially" since 1960, Van-
Andel said. In 1959-60, $1.25 mil
lion was given to under
graduates; in 1969-70 $4.1 mil
lion was given; in 1974-75 $7 mil
lion was given; and in 1979-80
$11.9 million was given, he said.
Despite the concern, Stanford
will continue its policy of meet
ing demonstrated need, and aid
will remain a high priority on
the list of expenditures.
Student aid is such "an
absolute priority that it has
never been discussed as
something that would be com
promised," Warner said.
However, "If federal student
aid programs are cut back —
and there appears to be a real
danger of this — then increased
pressure will be placed on the
budget by the requirements of
financial aids," Warner said.
"The University will be lucky
to receive the same amount of
support from the federal gov
ernment this year as last year,"

Huff said. Unless a federal pro
gram is part of the Defense De
partment's budget, it probably
will be cut by the Reagan ad
ministration," he said.
Secretary of Education Ter
rel Bell, in an interview with the
New York Times last month,
said that the primary target in
the Reagan administration's ef
forts to reduce federal spending
in education would be loans and
grants to college students.
"This administration is going to
propose cutting back on both the
Basic Educational Opportunity
Grants and the loan programs,"
he said. "We don't yet know how
we're going to do it, but we're
just going to have to reduce the
dollar demands," Bell said.
"The basic question during
the next few years will be
whether we can keep raising
enough money externally and
keep our internal budget in or
der so that we can continue to
support 44 percent — or more —
of the student population with fi
nancial aid," according to Van-
Andel.
Because education is a "la
bor-intensive" industry, the re
cent "absurd" inflation rate has
had a great effect on costs at
Stanford, he said. There are
very few areas of the budget
that can be cut without lowering
the quality of education, Van-
Andel said.
Inflation tends to hit univer
sities very hard, former C
UAFA chairman and Stanford
Law School Prof. Jack Frieden
thal said. The University is
"helpless in terms of cutting
costs," he said. The only way to
significantly reduce costs would
be to cut programs, Friedenthal
said.
The impact of inflation is not
so much centered on students,
but on the University as a whole,
he said. "It is all well and good
for students to holler aDout
costs," but they must consider
what will have to be cut to re
duce costs, Friedenthal said.
"The pressure for aid will
continue to increase as costs
rise," VanAndel said. And, if
the federal or state govern
ments should cut back financial
aid programs, it could have a se
rious effect on Stanford's ability
to provide aid, he said.
"My greatest fear is that the
state universities will see
private universities as competi
tion and that they will attempt
to lobby away privileges — such
as fellowships and state scholar
ships — that are much needed
for survival," VanAndel said.
If California were to cut state
scholarships, that would
mean that Stanford would
have 30 percent less financial
grant money to operate with,
VanAndel said.
Although there have been cuts
in the Cal Grant program, fund
ing increases have been insuffi
cient to cover the rising costs of
private education.
