# Understanding complex aid procedures is tough
## 
### Mike Vaska 
A student guide to financial
aid published by the Col
lege Scholarship Service
depicts financial aids as a maze
that must be mastered before a
student can get help. Financial
aid has become more complex
and more costly to administer
during the last decade.
With the increases in federal
aid has come more paperwork
for university officials and stu
dents alike.
There is a trend toward grow
ing complexity in student aid
administration and in the ap
plication process itself, Finan
cial Aid Director Robert Huff
said.
In addition, the financial aid
administrator's job is "not be
coming any easier," Assistant
Financial Aid Administrator
Mary Roberts said. The number
of students applying is increas
ing and the cost of education for
these students is "exceeding re
sources available to meet
them." She added that the fed
eral and state governments are
requiring more verification to
day than ever before.
While the number of students
attending Stanford has not in
creased substantially since
1969, the number of employees
in the Financial Aids and the
Bursar's Offices — responsible
for aid disbursement — has
grown by more than 50 percent.
The growth of federal fund
ing, and the related necessity to
keep more records and fill out
more forms, is directly respon
sible for the increases, accord
ing to the 1980-81 University
Budget Operating Guidelines.
So it is no wonder that a stu
dent may be confused about how
financial need is determined,
where aid comes from or why
the next guy gets scholarships
and grants — while he only gets
loans and jobs.
Excluding athletic scholar
ships, Stanford will give aid only
on need-based criteria, Huff
confirmed.
Fifteen years ago, the Uni
versity offered merit scholar
ships for top scholars, and many
schools still offer them today,
he said. However, Stanford does
not have specifically merit
based scholarships and there is
"no serious discussion about re
instating them here", he said.
"Merit-based scholarships,"
which many universities faced
with declining enrollments are
beginning to offer, "continue to
separate the haves from the
have nots," Roberts added.

But although every student's
need is determined using the
same formula, some students —
including those the Admissions
Office determines are most aca
demically qualified — get more
beneficial aid packages from
the University.
This year, the average stu
dent on aid will be expected to
pay $2450 or about 25 percent of
total college costs through
work-study and long term loans,
according to Roberts.
However, because of a fea
ture of the aids packaging pro
cedure, about 200 students in
each entering class are required
to pay less in self-help than the
$2450 figure, depending on their
admission status, Huff said..
These students get more aid in
the form of cash — scholarships
and grants — and they are al
lowed to either work less or take
out smaller loans to help pay for
their college costs, he said.
Students admitted from the
top 5 to 10 percent academ
ically are expected to pro
vide just $1500 in self-help this
year ; and those who are catego
rized as "diverse students" are
expected to pay $2050, Huff said.
Students admitted from the
low-income category, those
whose parents generally can
provide no aid, are expected to
provide only $950 in self-help for
this year.
Students admitted from one
of three minority groups —
black, Chicano and Native
American who meet demon
strated need criteria — get
more favorable treatment.
They are expected to pay 20 per
cent less than non-minority stu
dents in each special self-help
category. In addition, all mem
bers of these minority groups
who have demonstrated need
are placed in one of the three
categories — low income, top
academic achievement and "di
verse" — he said.
The top academic group gets
a break because it represents
the most gifted academic stu
dents in the nation, Huff said.
They are the most sought after
students, and Stanford uses this
formula to recognize their
acheivements and as a tool to at
tract them here.
The admissions office decides
who the top students are and
then tells the financial aids of
fice, Huff said.
The admissions staff decides
who these top students are
"based on experience and past
knowledge of who the most com
petitive students will be," Dean
of Admissions Fred Hargadon
said. The decisions are not

based solely on test or grade
point averages, just as ad
missions are not, he said.
Other schools have merit
scholarships for the most gifted
students not dependent on need,
or they have "national" schol
arships that give a similar self
help requirement break for the
top students, he said.
"Generally, the same people
are given the special status by
several schools,"Hargadon
said.
Harvard has its "national
scholarships" and Dartmouth
has "Webster scholarships"
which require lower self-help
from the top academic students,
Huff said.
Students in the diverse cate
gory are required to provide
less self-help because the Uni
versity feels that it adds to the
general atmosphere of the com
munity to have say — a concert
oboist or other talent — attend
ing, Huff said.
The low-income group gets a
break because the University
feels that it is most difficult for
them to meet the self-help re
quirements, Huff said.
"Low income people have
trouble meeting loans — they
are scared of loans and they
ought to be," Van Andel said.
The University gives mi
norities the additional 20
percent break because it
wants to encourage them to at
tend, Huff said. "Clearly —
coming into a competitive white
university is more difficult for
them (financially) — and there
have to be provisions to help
ensure that they will make it
through," he said.
"Minorities tend to be disad
vantaged — the University
shouldn't ask them to put as
much effort into worrying about
financial matters so that their
chances of success here will be
greater," according to Van-
Andel.
The University recognizes
that even in these modern
times, after we have emerged
from the racial "gloom of the
'605," it still may be more dif
ficult for minorities to get the
summer jobs or for their pa
rents to come up with the extra
cash needed to attend an ex
pensive private university, Jack
Friedenthal, former chairman
of the C-UAFA, said.
All students on financial aid
face increases each year in the
self-help requirement, which
approximately match the infla
tion rate, Roberts said. Next
year, the average student will
be expected to pay $2800 toward
his education, she said.
Although there are many
uncertainties in the finan
cial aids process, there is
a fact upon which all financial
aids administors agree — the
amount of financial aid a stu
dent receives depends solely on
his demonstrated need for aid as
determined by the College
Scholarship Service (CSS).
CSS determines a student's
need based on information pro
vided on parental and personal
income and assets, according to
Vince De Anda, assistant finan
cial aids director for student
employment.
The amount parents are ex
pected to provide for their
child's education is based on two
resources: income and assets,
he said. From the parents' gross
income, non-discretionary ex
penditures such as income tax
and medical costs are deducted.
In addition, a standard main
tainance allowance (which is
set by the government) that al
lows for a basic subsistance al
lowance — rent, food, clothing
- is deducted.

What's left over after the de
ductions is the parents' avail
able income for the student's
education, De Anda said.
A percentage of the parents'
assets — cash in the bank, equi
ty on a home or other real prop
erty — is also added to the pa
rents' available income as re
sources available to help the
student, he said.
This percentage varies from
one to 12 percent of the asset
value, depending on the size of
the asset pool in relation to in
come, De Anda said.
In addition, an "asset protec
tion allowance" is subtracted
which increases with the pa
rents' ages so that the family
will not have to liquidate all its
assets, he said.
The current methodology
may discriminate against
middle-class parents with large
home equities, according to De
Anda.
The skyrocketing value of the
home in many areas of the coun
try has increased equity for
many families, according to
Huff. However, the University
does not adjust for inflated asset
value because families with
large home equity are in a
stronger position financially
than those families with less
home equity, Huff added.
The University tries to help
students whose families do not
qualify for aid, or who qualify

for reduced aid, by offering
loans, Huff said.
Huff said he has proposed a
home equity allowance
for families equal to av
erage regional or state equity.
However, the Educational
Amendments of 1980, which be
come effective in 1982, will
eliminate homeowners equity
from the asset base of families,
Huff said.
The University will not cut
the amount of a student aid just
because, for example, he is a
senior or has bought a car, As
sistant Financial Aids Director
Mary Roberts said. A student's
aid will be adjusted only if his fi
nancial need changes, she said.
Many students visit financial
aids counselors to ask how they
can cope with the increasing
costs of education at Stanford,
according to Rose Ferri, one of
three financial aids counselors
here. Students' aid packages
will continue to increase with
inflation if their need remains
consistent, Ferri said.
"It is important, for students
to realize that we (the financial
aids office) will try to do ev
erything we can to keep them in
school. They should not give up
because they feel they cannot
make it on what they are given
in their financial aids packets,"
Ferri said.
Need analysis is just a place
to start and it doesn't take the
place of financial counseling,

De Anda agreed.
Often, when a student gets
his aid cut, he may simply
assume the reasons, Rob
erts said. She said that probably
a few students leave the Univer
sity each year because they
aren't getting enough aid to af
ford costs, but added that there
were no exact figures available.
"If students don't make a
point to come and see the finan
cial aids department if they
have a complaint, we can't help
them," Roberts said.
There are cases where stu
dents' families don't or can't
give what the University ex
pects, and in these cases the Fi
nancial Aids Department trys to
help the student out by giving
him loans or work study jobs,
Roberts said.
If there has been a drastic
change in the student's financial
status, a complete new need
analysis can be done, but this is
very difficult because the schol
arship money will have already
been assigned, she said.
The University doesn't cut aid
for students unless their pa
rents' financial situation im
proves, Roberts said. Although
it is possible that some colleges
do take such an approach, it
would not "be good public rela
tions to cut the aid for gradu
ating seniors" because the hope
is that they will start giving
money for scholarships when
they graduate, Roberts said.
