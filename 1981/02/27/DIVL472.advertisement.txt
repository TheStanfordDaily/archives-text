THE MOVE
112 luor Mining and Metals is an engineering/const ruction company offering full engineering
services to the mineral industry in the U.S. and abroad.
Our Geological, Mining and Process groups provide an integrated systems approach to
mine and plant design. We currently have permanent and part-time positions available for
Geologists, Applied Mathematicians, Mining Engineers and Metallurgists with a strong
FORTRAN computer background to work on development and implementation of
systems tor geostatistical ore reserve estimation, mine planning using operations research,
and computer aided metallurgical process design
Our recent experience includes:
• Design of two large copper mines in the People's Republic of China. This
involved field geology, geostatistical ore reserve estimation, computerized
mine design and scheduling, computerized metallurgical flowsheet develop
ment and process optimization and economic analysis.
• fX'sign of a uranium mine in the Republic of Niger. This involved work by
our geologists and engineers in France, Netherlands, Niger and the United
States to develop plans for a uranium project in the Sahara Desert. The com
puter was used at every step to optimize the mine and process design, and
perform economic analysis to optimize the production rate.
• Development of a general purpose computerized flowsheet balance system
using interactive graphics.
The recent high price of precious metals and development of synthetic fuels as an energy
alternative means that mining will be a growth industry of the 1980s At Fluor Mining and
Metals, we have developed the integrated systems approach to designing mining and
process complexes. Computers are used to study alternatives and optimize these designs.
We re looking for people who want to use and improve these systems, people with
initiative and imagination, people who want to be on the critical path for
multi-billion dollar project development.
