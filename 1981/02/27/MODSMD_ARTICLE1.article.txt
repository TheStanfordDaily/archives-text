# Forum looks at Soviet human rights
## 
### Clay Moltz 
No actions by individuals or groups
are absolutely "decisive in furthering
human rights, but certain activities
can help, five human rights experts in
cluding a Nobel Laureate, an interna
tionally-known activist and a Soviet
dissident exile agreed last night in a
torum called "Reagan, Russia, and
Human Rights."
Coit Blacker, assistant director of
the Stanford arms control program,
opened the torum with a speech on
"The Current Status of U.S.-Soviet
Relations." Blacker was pessimistic
about the prospects for improved
U.S.-Soviet human rights concern dur
ing the Reagan administration
"Clearly, relations between the
U.S. and the Soviet Union are at their
lowest point since the early 19605." he
said. "My guess is that things will be
come worse, perhaps much worse,
before they get better.
However, Blacker said "I believe
that the Kremlin very much wants to
resume a full dialogue with the United
States." He commented that the con
frontational attitude of the Reagan ad
ministration. along with Afghanistan
and SALT differences, are barriers
between our two countries at present.
Sister Ann Gillen. executive direc
tor of the National Interreligious Task
Force on Soviet Jewry, moved direct
ly to the human rights question, speak
ing on "The Challenge of Eastern Eu
rope to Religious Groups." Gillen
gave a brief history of human rights in
the Soviet Union, and noted that Jews.
Catholics, Moslems, and even Russian
Orthodox believers have suffered.
"Jews are still used as
scapegoats," she said. She rejected,
however, notions that dissidents in the
Eastern bloc (including the Soviet
Union) have given up their struggle
for political and religious freedom
Gillen praised recent efforts by
Polish workers to force changes in the
policies of their government. She
criticized the passivity of many Amer
icans to human rights issues. "We can
see people in this country who are
afraid to put their nameon a petition."
Recently returned from the ongoing
Madrid Conference on human rights,
Gillen spoke of the importance oi
groups working together toward
changing the direction of history.
"Nations are moving closer togeth
er," she said. "The Soviet Union, iron
ically, is isolating itself."
Berkeley Physics Prof. Morris
Pripstein, chairman of Scientists for
Saknarov, Orlov, and Shcharansky,
addressed the topic "Scientists and
Human Rights." He spoke of the
"strong sense of solidarity" Ameri
can scientists feel for their Soviet col
leagues.
Commenting on the impact of pro
test letters from the international sci
entific community against Soviet ar

rests of individual scientists, he said
"What we found in the early 1970s was
that we were having less and less ef
fect — we wanted to do something
more."
Since 1979. his group has organized
7900 scientists worldwide in support of
a boycott of scientific exchanges with
the Soviet Union. He says this effort
receives broad support from Soviet
dissident scientists.
Stanford Prof. Kenneth Arrow.
Nobel Prize winner in economics, dis
cussed "Economic Relations with the
Soviet Union" in the context oi human
rights. "There are great limits to
what we can do in the realm of eco
nomic pressure." he said. Arrow re
ferred to the ability of other world
traders to fill in much of the gap
caused by U.S. boycotts on certain
products
Vet. Arrow said that in areas of sig
nificant U.S. advantage, such as oil
drilling equipment. "We should cer
tainly use the powers we have."
Most economic tools "are not uselul
instruments for human rights," he
said. But such efforts as the present
grain and technology embargoes
should not. in his opinion, be lifted

" unless they are withdrawn through
negotiation."
He pointed out that the Soviet econ
omy is clearly not "fatally vulner
able," but that U.S. economic tools
can bring about what he called an un
comfortable situation in the Soviet
economy.
Leonid Feldman, a Jewish dissident
who left the Soviet Union four years
ago, said that letters to the Soviet gov
ernment and constant American
focusing of attention on the plight of
Soviet human rights activists is "the
most important thing we can do." He
spoke of continued repression of the
Jewish faith in the Soviet Union and
ongoing discrimination
In high school, he said, he was re
quired to take courses in "scientific
atheism." He pointed out that while
there is some discrimination against
Jews in the United States. "When we
talk about anti-semitism in the United
States and anti-semitism in the Soviet
Union we are talking about two dif
ferent things."
The forum at Terman Auditorium
was sponsored by the Stanford Com
mittee on Political Education. Hillel.
and the Stanford Newman Center.

and SALT differences, are barriers
between our two countries at present.
Sister Ann Gillen. executive direc
tor of the National Interreligious Task
Force on Soviet Jewry, moved direct
ly to the human rights question, speak
ing on "The Challenge of Eastern Eu
rope to Religious Groups." Gillen
gave a brief history of human rights in
the Soviet Union, and noted that Jews.
Catholics, Moslems, and even Russian
Orthodox believers have suffered.
"Jews are still used as
scapegoats," she said. She rejected,
however, notions that dissidents in the
Eastern bloc (including the Soviet
Union) have given up their struggle
for political and religious freedom
Gillen praised recent efforts by
Polish workers to force changes in the
policies of their government. She
criticized the passivity of many Amer
icans to human rights issues. "We can
see people in this country who are
afraid to put their nameon a petition."
Recently returned from the ongoing
Madrid Conference on human rights,
Gillen spoke of the importance oi
groups working together toward
changing the direction of history.
"Nations are moving closer togeth
er," she said. "The Soviet Union, iron
ically, is isolating itself."
Berkeley Physics Prof. Morris
Pripstein, chairman of Scientists for
Saknarov, Orlov, and Shcharansky,
addressed the topic "Scientists and
Human Rights." He spoke of the
"strong sense of solidarity" Ameri
can scientists feel for their Soviet col
leagues.
Commenting on the impact of pro
test letters from the international sci
entific community against Soviet ar

rests of individual scientists, he said
"What we found in the early 1970s was
that we were having less and less ef
fect — we wanted to do something
more."
Since 1979. his group has organized
7900 scientists worldwide in support of
a boycott of scientific exchanges with
the Soviet Union. He says this effort
receives broad support from Soviet
dissident scientists.
Stanford Prof. Kenneth Arrow.
Nobel Prize winner in economics, dis
cussed "Economic Relations with the
Soviet Union" in the context oi human
rights. "There are great limits to
what we can do in the realm of eco
nomic pressure." he said. Arrow re
ferred to the ability of other world
traders to fill in much of the gap
caused by U.S. boycotts on certain
products
Vet. Arrow said that in areas of sig
nificant U.S. advantage, such as oil
drilling equipment. "We should cer
tainly use the powers we have."
Most economic tools "are not uselul
instruments for human rights," he
said. But such efforts as the present
grain and technology embargoes
should not. in his opinion, be lifted

" unless they are withdrawn through
negotiation."
He pointed out that the Soviet econ
omy is clearly not "fatally vulner
able," but that U.S. economic tools
can bring about what he called an un
comfortable situation in the Soviet
economy.
Leonid Feldman, a Jewish dissident
who left the Soviet Union four years
ago, said that letters to the Soviet gov
ernment and constant American
focusing of attention on the plight of
Soviet human rights activists is "the
most important thing we can do." He
spoke of continued repression of the
Jewish faith in the Soviet Union and
ongoing discrimination
In high school, he said, he was re
quired to take courses in "scientific
atheism." He pointed out that while
there is some discrimination against
Jews in the United States. "When we
talk about anti-semitism in the United
States and anti-semitism in the Soviet
Union we are talking about two dif
ferent things."
The forum at Terman Auditorium
was sponsored by the Stanford Com
mittee on Political Education. Hillel.
and the Stanford Newman Center.

Dissident Leonid Feldman, Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow, Cal Physics Prof. Morris Pripstein and Sister Ann Gillen
took part in a forum entitled "Reagan. Russia, and Human Rights" held last night in Terman Auditorium. Discussion
focused on the future of human rights in U.S.-Soviet negotiations.
No actions by individuals or groups
are absolutely "decisive in furthering
human rights, but certain activities
can help, five human rights experts in
cluding a Nobel Laureate, an interna
tionally-known activist and a Soviet
dissident exile agreed last night in a
torum called "Reagan, Russia, and
Human Rights."
Coit Blacker, assistant director of
the Stanford arms control program,
opened the torum with a speech on
"The Current Status of U.S.-Soviet
Relations." Blacker was pessimistic
about the prospects for improved
U.S.-Soviet human rights concern dur
ing the Reagan administration
"Clearly, relations between the
U.S. and the Soviet Union are at their
lowest point since the early 19605." he
said. "My guess is that things will be
come worse, perhaps much worse,
before they get better.
However, Blacker said "I believe
that the Kremlin very much wants to
resume a full dialogue with the United
States." He commented that the con
frontational attitude of the Reagan ad
ministration. along with Afghanistan
and SALT differences, are barriers
between our two countries at present.
