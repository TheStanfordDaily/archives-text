# Spain's abortive coup part of long history

Special to The Washington Post
Madrid — The takeover of the Spanish
parliament building by a group of rebellious
Civil Guardsmen and the holding hostage of
the nation's Cabinet and legislature is
without precedent in modern Western Eu
rope, but it also reflects a Spanish tradition
of military involvement in politics.
With a history of 25 coups in the past 150
years, Spain is in a class by itself.
At the center of the dramatic test of
Spain's democratic system is this tradition
and the historic figure of the Spanish officer
who feels impelled to "save Spain.''
"There are people who live in another
age," Socialist Deputy Carmen Garcia
Bloise said of her kidnappers shortly after
her release Tuesday.
The leader of the Civil Guard attack on
the Congress of Deputies, Lt. Col. Antonio
Tejero Molina, is a throwback to the 19th
century Spanish military officers who alter
nately created and deposed governments.
The word "junta" was coined by the
Spaniards during that period, and the mili
tary man meddling in politics, the "man on
horseback," became an enduring Spanish
export to Latin America.
Tejero, who is widely known for his ex
treme right-wing views, acted out a tradi
tional role. In 1874 a tough, no-nonsense of
ficer, Gen. Pavia, toppled a chaotic re
publican experiment by bursting into the
same Cortes building that Tejero attacked,
and dismissing the terrified deputies. Ever
since then. "Pavia's horse" — the general
reportedly rode up the steps — has become a
Spanish code word for military anti-con
stitutional plotting.

But when Tejero tried to repeat the trick,
he was left to act alone and was humiliated.
Lessons
The kidnapping of Congress will go down
in Spanish folklore and history as the "23rd
of-February events." Already two lessons
can clearly be drawn: the continuing ex :
istence of the fanatic officer and the evi
dence that, for the present at least, he is act
ing in a vacuum.
Aside from the fact that the coup attempt
was badly planned and generally bungled,
the main reason that it failed is that the
modern Spanish Army is strongly united
and extremely reluctant to act in any way
that would break that unity. This is the re
sult of the traumatic Spanish Civil War
when the Army split in two. Spanish com
mentators on military affairs stress that the
Army will not follow solitary, and therefore
divisive, adventures.
They say the Army would only act politi
cally as a whole, united institution and only
if an intolerable situation had been reached.
Tejero found himself isolated and unaided
because there is no consensus among the
armed forces that Spain has arrived at such
a point.
Politically. Tejero is a man with no ideol
ogy or program other than an emotional pa
triotic desire to "rescue the fatherland,"
using as a reference point the last suc
cessful coup carried out in Spain — Gen.
Francisco Franco's rebellion that triggered
the Spanish Civil War. Outside the small
number of extreme rightists and others
nostalgic for the days of Franco, few in
Spain would agree that there is any analogy
between the situation before the civil war

and the present moment.
Francoist cliches
However, Tejero, when he spoke to de
puties and journalists during the hostage
drama, repeated the Francoist cliches of a
Spain broken by separatism and Marxism
and in need of patriots who would restore
the nation's honor. Again, Tejero was
playing the part of the historic Spanish coup
leader.
According to the penetrating essay "In
vertebrate Spain" by the 20th centurv
philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset, the coup
leader who brought out troops against the
government «was essentially convinced of
the righteousness of his "idea" and saw lit
tle reason to justify or explain his actions.
Tejero fits into that pattern.
Monday's Congress takeover was Te
jero's second attempt at the classicpronun
ciamiento (literally "pronouncement") of
the 19th century mold. In 1978 he was ar
rested in the midst of a plot, known as Oper
ation Galaxy, which also planned to hold the
Cabinet hostage. A court martial subse
quently freed him after he had spent seven
months in custody. It was generally be
lieved that Tejero was treated leniently be
cause his plotting reflected the Army's mis
givings over Spain's transition to de
mocracy.
Tejero can no longer expect such leniency
nor such tacit support. This time he went too
far. But at a time when historic parallels
are being freely discussed in Spain, many
point to the fact Franco's 1936 coup was
itself preceded by a failure four years
earlier when another general mistimed a
rebellion against the republic.
