# Ocean agreement may be beached

One of the most controversial
issues floating in international
circles today, the Law of the
Seas Treaty, was debated here
last Wednesday as part of the
"World in Crisis: United States
faces the '80s" symposium
series.
The Law of the Seas treaty
sets down seabed rules of con
duct for all countries, consider
ing in particular the issues of
ocean resource mining and the
right of nations to exert sov
ereignty over seaways off their
coasts.
One hundred and fifty two na
tions. meeting annually for the
past 10 years at the "Law of the
Sea Treaty Conference," con
tributed to the final 180 page
draft. The conference hopes to
vote on this draft in March at a
New York meeting.
The topic, "The Oceans and
the Law of the Seas," was ad
dressed in outspoken
statements both in support of
and against the Treaty, to a
large group at CERAS. Francis
co Vicuna of the University of
Chile, who headed the con
ference for 1980 in charge of
writing this treaty, supported
the Treaty. Conrad Wellings,
head of Lockheed's Ocean Sys
tems Division and one-time
State Advisor for the treaty con
ference, and Stephen Turika of
the U.S. Naval Post-graduate
School in Monterey, voiced op

position to the Treaty.
John Barton, Chairman of
Stanford Law School, began dis
cussion by explaining that the
Conference had been for
mulated to realize satisfactory
compromises between the in
terests of advanced nations such
as the U.S. and U.S.S.R. seeking
resource mining rights and open
exploration/navigation privi

"Though there are still some problems to be
considered, the compromises have led to an
international regulation and organization in
which no country can claim victory or
defeat. I am optimistic about the treaty
being ratified.. .
— Francisco Vicuna,
University of Chile
"It's sad to see a treaty accepted which is
based on false assumptions.""
— Conrad Wellings.

leges, and the wishes of under
developed nations such as Chile,
anxious to control waterways
off their coast and participate in
well-regulated resource ex
ploitation.
The treaty offers coastal na
tions a 200-mile jurisdiction
over waters off their edge and a

12-mile fishing moratorium,
while landlocked nations re
ceive certain passage rights. In
addition, International Seabed
Authority would serve as in
ternational regulator and finan
cier of mining operations. This
would allow underdeveloped na
tions to benefit from resource
exploitation rather than be ov
erwhelmed by "high technolo-

gy" nations like the U.S.
Vicuna supported these de
cisions: "Though there are still
some problems to be con
sidered, the compromises have
led to an international regu
lation and organization in which
no country can claim victory or
defeat. I am optimistic about

the treaty being ratified so long
as none of the old arguments are
reintroduced in March."
Seeking to justify the 10-year
duration of the conference,
Vicuna told how the Law of the
Sea Conference had entertained
the social, military, economic
and political concerns of 152
countries, the broadest repre
sentation of countries in all his
tory.
The unique feature of the
compromise treaty, said
Vicuna, is the Parallel Interest
System. This allows private in
terests to explore and mine min
eral resources, while a 36-mem
ber Seabed Council and the
Seabed Authority would regu
late ocean mining, control
navigation, and protect sov
ereignty rights of smaller na
tions.
But Wellings attacked this
concept. "I've had'to deal with
the facts in the mining business
for 35 years and I've found that
— as I think anyone would — a
sobering experience," he said.
Welling heads Lockheed's re
search program on the methods
and funding of attaining needed
minerals through ocean mining.
"It's sad to see a treaty ac
cepted which is based on false
assumptions. They've (the con
ference) assumed that the re
sources of the ocean are easy to
mine, that international mar
kets would be injured by in
creased mineral productions
and that regulating production

would not hurt mining invest
ment," he said.
Welling stated that the metals
oceans offer, particularly
cobalt and nickel, demand at
least ten years and $1.5 billion
for U.S. business to efficiently
mine; that developing these
minerals is critical to U.S. in
dustrial maintenance, and that
investment in such mining
would be "unlikely" under regu
lations of the treaty as written.
Turika then attacked the po
litical and military implications
of the treaty, saying that a
Council of 36 members would be
too large to decisively enforce
the treaty's regulations, partic
ularly in regards to ships' pas
sage through waterways.
"It won't matter that with the
200-mile jurisdiction smaller
nations could close every
seaway there is. If bigger coun
tries need access somewhere,
they'll punch their way
through," he warned.
J. Henry Glazer. NASA's
chief counsel, argued, finally,
that "the simple defect of the
treaty is that no one is going to
follow it." The language is so
ambiguous it would be hard to
follow even for those who
wanted to, he said.
Vicuna responded, saying
that the treaty was meant to be
a device during times of peace
only and was by necessity a
complex piece because of the in
tricate compromises that had to
be made in balancing the wants
of all concerned parties.

lation and organization in which
no country can claim victory or
defeat. I am optimistic about

the treaty being ratified so long
as none of the old arguments are
reintroduced in March."
Seeking to justify the 10-year
duration of the conference,
Vicuna told how the Law of the
Sea Conference had entertained
the social, military, economic
and political concerns of 152
countries, the broadest repre
sentation of countries in all his
tory.
The unique feature of the
compromise treaty, said
Vicuna, is the Parallel Interest
System. This allows private in
terests to explore and mine min
eral resources, while a 36-mem
ber Seabed Council and the
Seabed Authority would regu
late ocean mining, control
navigation, and protect sov
ereignty rights of smaller na
tions.
But Wellings attacked this
concept. "I've had'to deal with
the facts in the mining business
for 35 years and I've found that
— as I think anyone would — a
sobering experience," he said.
Welling heads Lockheed's re
search program on the methods
and funding of attaining needed
minerals through ocean mining.
"It's sad to see a treaty ac
cepted which is based on false
assumptions. They've (the con
ference) assumed that the re
sources of the ocean are easy to
mine, that international mar
kets would be injured by in
creased mineral productions
and that regulating production

would not hurt mining invest
ment," he said.
Welling stated that the metals
oceans offer, particularly
cobalt and nickel, demand at
least ten years and $1.5 billion
for U.S. business to efficiently
mine; that developing these
minerals is critical to U.S. in
dustrial maintenance, and that
investment in such mining
would be "unlikely" under regu
lations of the treaty as written.
Turika then attacked the po
litical and military implications
of the treaty, saying that a
Council of 36 members would be
too large to decisively enforce
the treaty's regulations, partic
ularly in regards to ships' pas
sage through waterways.
"It won't matter that with the
200-mile jurisdiction smaller
nations could close every
seaway there is. If bigger coun
tries need access somewhere,
they'll punch their way
through," he warned.
J. Henry Glazer. NASA's
chief counsel, argued, finally,
that "the simple defect of the
treaty is that no one is going to
follow it." The language is so
ambiguous it would be hard to
follow even for those who
wanted to, he said.
Vicuna responded, saying
that the treaty was meant to be
a device during times of peace
only and was by necessity a
complex piece because of the in
tricate compromises that had to
be made in balancing the wants
of all concerned parties.
One of the most controversial
issues floating in international
circles today, the Law of the
Seas Treaty, was debated here
last Wednesday as part of the
"World in Crisis: United States
faces the '80s" symposium
series.
The Law of the Seas treaty
sets down seabed rules of con
duct for all countries, consider
ing in particular the issues of
ocean resource mining and the
right of nations to exert sov
ereignty over seaways off their
coasts.
One hundred and fifty two na
tions. meeting annually for the
past 10 years at the "Law of the
Sea Treaty Conference," con
tributed to the final 180 page
draft. The conference hopes to
vote on this draft in March at a
New York meeting.
The topic, "The Oceans and
the Law of the Seas," was ad
dressed in outspoken
statements both in support of
and against the Treaty, to a
large group at CERAS. Francis
co Vicuna of the University of
Chile, who headed the con
ference for 1980 in charge of
writing this treaty, supported
the Treaty. Conrad Wellings,
head of Lockheed's Ocean Sys
tems Division and one-time
State Advisor for the treaty con
ference, and Stephen Turika of
the U.S. Naval Post-graduate
School in Monterey, voiced op

position to the Treaty.
John Barton, Chairman of
Stanford Law School, began dis
cussion by explaining that the
Conference had been for
mulated to realize satisfactory
compromises between the in
terests of advanced nations such
as the U.S. and U.S.S.R. seeking
resource mining rights and open
exploration/navigation privi

considered, the compromises have led to an

which no country can claim victory or
defeat. I am optimistic about the treaty

off their coast and participate in
well-regulated resource ex

The treaty offers coastal na
tions a 200-mile jurisdiction
over waters off their edge and a

12-mile fishing moratorium,
while landlocked nations re
ceive certain passage rights. In
addition, International Seabed
Authority would serve as in
ternational regulator and finan
cier of mining operations. This
would allow underdeveloped na
tions to benefit from resource
exploitation rather than be ov
erwhelmed by "high technolo-

gy" nations like the U.S.
Vicuna supported these de
cisions: "Though there are still
