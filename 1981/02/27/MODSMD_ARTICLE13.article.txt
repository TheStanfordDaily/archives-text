# Talent show-case at Tresidder tomorrow
## Faculty's show of formidable feats 
### Cornelius Willis 
The finest — or perhaps the
most daring — in faculty talent
will be featured in a STARTS
produced show "Professors in
Performance" tomorrow night
at 8 p.m. in the Tresidder ball
room. For those who have won
dered if their teachers think of
nothing but French, calculus or
Homer, this show might provide
some answers.
The first act of the evening
will be Medical School Prof.
Alan Sklar accompanied by his
wife Alice playing several
Rumanian folkdances by
Bartok. Sklar relates psy
chiatry (his job) and music (his
hobby) since "they both involve
dissonance and conflict as inte
gral parts of their practice," ac
cording to the show's master of
ceremonies, Marc Ventresca.
Sklar also plays locally in a
group named "the Manzanita
Quartet."
Clio Dorr of the French De
partment will be performing
French folksongs of the 18th and
19th centuries — many of which
will be recognizable to her stu
dents.
Edwin Good, a professor of
theology, will perform Chopin's
"Barcarolle." Good has an un
dergraduate degree as well as a
master's degree in music from
Stanford. Good said he spends
as much time as he can playing
"and a little bit more." He is
also a member of the Manzanita

Quartet.
Jack Winkler, a classics pro
fessor here, will tell a Greek
story "Thelyphron's Tale," that
he heard while travelling in
Greece. Formerly a Benedic
tine monk, Winkler now teaches
a course called: Comedy and
Melodrama: from Euripides to
Shakespeare.
Also performing will be Denis
Phillips from the School of
Education, who will, reportedly
become a "maniacal" conjurer.
Phillips is a native of Australia
and formerly the editor of Aus
tralia's only magic magazine.
Robert McGinn and his ac
companist will play guitar and
mandolin duos by several Ital
ian, Spanish and Greek folk
songs. The ultra-trendy may
have seen them before per
forming in North Beach Cafes.
The final act is a rock and roll
band called "The Dead
Tongues." The "Tongues"
come mainly from the
Linguistics Department. The
members are: Geoff Nunberg
on sax, Ivan Sag on guitar and
organ (formerly of Ivan and the
Terribles), Long Jim Watson on
Bass, and Adam Brown on
drums. They claim they are an
"old wave" band — New Wave
is dead.
According to Ventresca, the
talent show is very important
because there are so many tal
ented members of the faculty

whose only means for self-ex
pression is behind the lectern.
This show gives them a chance
to share their other interests
with the Stanford Community.
STARTS coordinates a varie
ty of cultural activities for the
Stanford community including
lectures, musical per

formances, theater events and
art exhibits. This year the group
is composed of 50 student volun
teers who plan the majority of
the Tresidder-based events.
STARTS is a self-supporting
student group and is "always
looking for new talent" to fill its
schedule.
