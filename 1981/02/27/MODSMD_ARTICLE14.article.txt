# Rights Commission delegates trying to save investigation

Geneva (AP) — Western del
egations on the U.N. Human
Rights Commission currently
meeting here are desperately
trying to salvage a U.N. in
vestigation into thousands of
missing persons — in the face of
violent opposition from Argen
tina and the Soviet Union, and
complete indifference from the
new Reagan administration.
At stake is the future of a five
man U.N. working group that
was established last year and
has since received reports on
between 11,000 and 13.000 disap
pearances in 16 countries.
Human rights activists har
bor high hopes for the group, be
cause disappearance, like tor
ture, is seen as one area where
the U.N. human rights ap
paratus can play a major role —
unlike such stock concerns as Is
raeli settlements, or the Soviet
occupation of Afghanistan.
This year's debate has been
preoccupied by the vigor with
which the working group has fol
lowed up allegations, and also
the freedom with which it has
indicted governments in its re
port.
Last year, it sent off more
than 20 urgent telegrams (one of
which is credited with saving a
group of Argentinian refugees in
Peru); it also has taken evi
dence from individuals who
have seen relatives dragged off
by armed men.
All this is faithfully recorded
in the report, which singles out
Ethiopia. Indonesia and Argen
tina for their failure to cooper
ate.
When asked to investigate the
disappearance of 22 persons in
East Timor between 1977 and
1979, the Indonesian govern
ment replied: "As a matter of
principle, limited resources
must be used tor other
purposes."
Argentina has been the target
of human rights groups for
years, and the group shows a
representative 500 disap
pearances from thousands sub
mitted to it. It concludes that
165 were probably the work of
security forces, and also lists 16
alleged secret detention camps.
The Argentine government
replied by blaming disap
pearances on terrorism, and in
sisting that all communications
to the group should be first
screened and then discussed un
der the commission's special

confidential procedure.
This line has been repeated
here by Gabriel Martinez, Ar
gentina's ambassador to the
United Nations, who has regu
larly tried to intimidate non
governmental organizations
giving evidence at U.N. human
rights meetings, and accused
the U.N. secretariat of political
bias.
All realize that, if Martinez
has his way, the working group
would be swiftly emasculated.
As Viscount Colville, one of the
group' five members pointed
out, it would mean that rela
tives could not be kept abreast
of the group's findings.
It also would come at a time
when disappearances are on the
increase in Guatemala and El
Salvador, and when they con
tinue in Argentina, despite a
diminution of terrorism. Fifty
were reported in 1980.
Last year. Argentina found
itself isolated and forced to
agree to the group's estab
lishment. This year, in addition
to developing countries such as
Brazil. Algeria and the Philip
pines. it has the support of the
two superpowers.
The United States has stayed
silent in the public debate, but
let it be known behind the scenes
that it could well vote against
any simple extension of the
group's mandate.
This has forced other Western
delegations to propose a wa
tered-down resolution calling
for the the group's "renewal for
one more year" in accordance
with recognized practice. Many
fear the Argentinians will in
terpret this to insist on confiden
tiality.
The U.S. approach may be
consistent with the new admin
istration's line toward supposed
friends in L,atin America. tout it
has dismayed and angered hu
man rights activists here.
A spokesman for the In
teramerican Commission on
Human Rights took the Ameri
can delegation to task for a
statement here last week that
"international terrorism will
take the place of human rights
as the main concern of the Rea
gan administration."
The spokesman said, "The vi
olation of basic human rights is
the essence of terrorism, wheth
er practiced by private individ
uals or by governments them
selves."
