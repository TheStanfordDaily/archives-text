## Looking into heart of darkness 
### 
Sunday night I went to see Francis Ford Cop
pola's Apocalypse Voir. When I was younger, a
movie like that would have frightened me ter
ribly. I am older now; I can protect myself from
the raw emotion. But the numb darkness 1 felt
when I left the theater spoke of the effectiveness
of Coppola's message.
Monday afternoon, I went to a slide show at
Palo Alto High School. It was given by Sister
Sandra Price, a nun from San Jose, and showed
what she had seen when she was in El Salvador in
1980. The stories she told, and the pictures she
showed, would have fit perfectly into Coppola's
gruesome epic. I was struck numb as she re
counted with a straight face tales of machine gun
nings, bodies in the streets, the killing of women
and children ...
Twice in 24 hours, and I have to scream.
What is happening to the people in this country' 1
Unable to see past our middle-class aspirations,
we seem to be asking, begging for another war.
Only this time I am old enough to be ordered to
fight. And I don't want to.
Where are the people who have seen war. who
know how terrible war really is? Why do I get the
feeling that hating war more than communism is
something I'm supposed to outgrow" 1 Is everyone
else even more immune to pictures and tales of
death and mutilation than I am?
And now our new administration is unleashing a
torrent of rhetoric that seems designed to con
vince the people that our nation is not responsible
for any of the death and violence in the world. By
claiming that the United States fights only to de
fend freedom and democracy, our government is
perpetuating the illusion that everything the U.S.
does or has done is good, and everything done in
the name of communism is evil.
Cynics might claim that special interests wish
to perpetuate this myth to perpetuate their own
power or profit. But the new administration is not
callously and deliberately lying to us; I can only
conclude that they are truly blind to the truth.
What is this truth 9

For those who have never seen Apocalypse
Xoic. or read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness
(upon which the movie is based), let me para
phrase the plot they have in common: a "good"
man is sent on a mission to find and kill an "evil"
madmar. who has established himself as a god
among the group of natives. The message which
unfolds as the hunter sinks closer and closer is this
truth of which I speak: that we all have within us
the heart of darkness.
We all have within us the heart of darkness. But
the influential forces of society, however ab
stractly or specifically one wishes to define them,
seem to want above all else to deny this. From bla
tant propaganda to the subtle editing of history,
we find ourselves again and again passing over
the sins our nation has committed in an attempt to
blame the evil in the world on forces outside
ourselves. We don't even look to see the blood on
our hands,
It is not only as a nation that we are blind. Con
rad and Coppola were speaking to us as individ
uals. Everyone of us has within the capability to
injure or kill. I could kill a person if I were starv
ing. Even now I can and often do hurt people, if
only with words, simply because I cannot com
pletely control the evil within myself.
But if I know that evil exists within myself. I
also know that every human carries the light as
well as the dark. Capitalist, communist, rightist,
leftist — every person is as human as I am. As in
dividuals and as a nation, we cannot damn our en
emy and glorify ourselves without sinking down to
our enemy's level and dragging him lower still
Each side must learn to see the best, the rational,
the human, in the other.
The voices of those who see the personal and
collective insanity that is gripping the nation and
the world cannot remain silent. It might be easy to
say. "War is inevitable; there's nothing I can do."
But there will be no glory in saying "I told you
so." We must all look at ourselves, look at our na
tion, and then speak out.

Sunday night I went to see Francis Ford Cop
pola's Apocalypse Voir. When I was younger, a
movie like that would have frightened me ter
ribly. I am older now; I can protect myself from
the raw emotion. But the numb darkness 1 felt
when I left the theater spoke of the effectiveness
of Coppola's message.
Monday afternoon, I went to a slide show at
Palo Alto High School. It was given by Sister
Sandra Price, a nun from San Jose, and showed
what she had seen when she was in El Salvador in
1980. The stories she told, and the pictures she
showed, would have fit perfectly into Coppola's
gruesome epic. I was struck numb as she re
counted with a straight face tales of machine gun
nings, bodies in the streets, the killing of women
and children ...
Twice in 24 hours, and I have to scream.
What is happening to the people in this country' 1
Unable to see past our middle-class aspirations,
we seem to be asking, begging for another war.
Only this time I am old enough to be ordered to
fight. And I don't want to.
Where are the people who have seen war. who
know how terrible war really is? Why do I get the
feeling that hating war more than communism is
something I'm supposed to outgrow" 1 Is everyone
else even more immune to pictures and tales of
death and mutilation than I am?
And now our new administration is unleashing a
torrent of rhetoric that seems designed to con
vince the people that our nation is not responsible
for any of the death and violence in the world. By
claiming that the United States fights only to de
fend freedom and democracy, our government is
perpetuating the illusion that everything the U.S.
does or has done is good, and everything done in
the name of communism is evil.
Cynics might claim that special interests wish
to perpetuate this myth to perpetuate their own
power or profit. But the new administration is not
callously and deliberately lying to us; I can only
conclude that they are truly blind to the truth.
What is this truth 9

For those who have never seen Apocalypse
Xoic. or read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness
(upon which the movie is based), let me para
phrase the plot they have in common: a "good"
man is sent on a mission to find and kill an "evil"
madmar. who has established himself as a god
among the group of natives. The message which
unfolds as the hunter sinks closer and closer is this
truth of which I speak: that we all have within us
the heart of darkness.
We all have within us the heart of darkness. But
