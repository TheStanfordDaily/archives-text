# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Michael Weiss When prestige will be enough 
### 
The days are soon going to end
in which students like Mark
Wilsuccesson, a Stanford sen
ior, has to wait six hours at the
Career Placement and Planning
Center for a job interview be
cause he is worried about his
future in the job world.
Similarly, no longer will
Harvard and students like Eric
Medicendo, a chemistry major,
have to worry about getting an
internship in a certain hospital
because that hospital has been
so deluged with potential in
terns.
We, the students of the coun
try's most prestigious colleges
Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Uni
versity of Palookaville, etc. â€”
have joined our intellectual
forces into a union. In order to
distinguish ourselves from stu
dents in lower-class schools, we
will, from this moment on, refer
to ourselves by the unique title,
"People in Good Schools," or
P.I.G.S. for short.
The aim of this union will be
to enable students graduating
from the country's best schools
to receive the red carpet treat
ment that they deserve.
In the past few years, this
country has become increasing
ly more dependent on us
P.I.G.S. In fact, we feel quite
certain that if not for us and our
productive abilities, the United
States would fall on its face
faster than you can say "The
Russians are coming!"
Therefore, we feel that we
are in a position to make de
mands. If our demands are not
met, we will simply withdraw
all P.I.G.S. from the job mar
ket.
This may not seem like such a
serious threat. However, go
ahead, Mr. Banker, Mr Lawyer,
and Mr. Hospital Director, and
fill up your open positions with
people from colleges like Uni
versity of Southern California,
or University of Miami. Just
don't cry on our shoulders when

your buildings empty out be
cause Joe-Jan. Surfin' Man has
run by yelling "surf's up!" Now
with respect to our demands.
We are going to coerce all mem
ber universities into accepting
high school seniors only every
other year. This will obviously
decrease the supply of P.I.G.S.
in the market. Even someone in
a plebeian college like U.C.
Berkeley can tell you (although
one never Knows \n a piace like
Berkeley) that with fewer
P.I.G.S. in the market, their
price, or for our purposes, their
salaries will go up.
We are also going to demand
that all member P.I.G.S. be
able to interview any pros
pective employer before going
to work for him. Therefore, will
be setting up P.P.O.'s (P.I.G.S.
Placement Offices) in all major
cities. It will be a first-come,
first interviewed system, which
could entail long lines. Sorry,
we just could not think of a bet
ter system.
Our union, however, will not
be just concerned with the job
world. There are other aspects
of life in which we do not feel
that P.I.G.S. are being treated
with sufficient respect.
For example, we recently re
ceived a report from Stanford
sophomore, Linda Bemylovis,
in which Miss Bemylovis de
scribed to us a night during
which she went to an off-campus
bar to find some action. Accord
ing to this P.I.G.S.' report, she
was completely ignored by ev
ery guy in the place. She sat at
the bar for five hours, sexily
clad in a blue Stanford jogging
outfit and a pink bookpack on
her back, and nobody ap
proached her. Linda just could
not understand it, and we do not
blame her for her disgust.
who slaves over human biology
books four hours each day
should be able to indulge in
some one-night stands every
now and then.
The union is presently work

ing on a solution to this problem.
Of course, finding a solution to
this problem will be a for
midable project, because re
portedly some of the female
P.I.G.S. lack the womanly qual
ities that seem to be exhibited
by girls in plebian schools. How
ever, P.I.G.S. should not de
spair. We will remedy the situ
ation. even if it involves the use
of plastic surgery.
Fortunately, we have not re
ceived any reports of this type
from male P.I.G.S. In fact, this
is an area in which we have no
complaints about now the world
treat us. We received a report
from Stanford student Steve
Bimachianci (half Italian, half
he-man), in which Steve told of
his inability in fending off the
swarms of girls that attacked
him whenever he left campus.
Surprisingly, Bimachianci did
not mention any exciting ex
periences that he had with
P.I.G.S. while on campus. We
assume this to be an oversight
on his part.
We P.I.G.S. want the world
to know there are going to be
some changes soon. We are no
longer going to settle for a pat
on the back in exchange for the
40-grand we pay to attend our
spective schools. The P.I.G.S.
of the world are soon going to be
recognized for what they really
are!

majoring in economics. His col
umn normally appears every
other Thursday.)
