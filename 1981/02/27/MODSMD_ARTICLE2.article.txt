# Police chief wants press guidelines
## 
### Carol Rose 
Local law enforcement officials are
considering countvwide guidelines for
the release of information by police to
the press following recent disputes be
tween the press and police in the area.
Palo Alto Police Chief James
Zurcher said the arrest last month of a
Peninsula Times Tribune photogra
pher. trying to take pictures at the
scene of an accident, prompted him to
write the guidelines.
I felt we needed some ground rules
for our organization to know the
boundaries for dealing with the
press." he said.
The guidelines would give the press
access to all relevant information
with certain exceptions. These excep
tions are:
— when release is prohibited by le
gal restraints;
— when release would hinder a po
lice investigation;
— when the disclosed information
would reveal police tactics;
— when police sources would be re
vealed; or
— if the safety of a media represent
ative or other citizen is jeopardized.
Legal boundaries
Under California law, any author
ized media representative may enter
an area which has been closed off by
police personnel during emergencies,
unless public order or safety would be

threatened by the crossing of police
lines.
The sheriff has the authority to de
termine the line of safety.
"The penal code is ambiguous in its
definition of police lines' ". Zur'/her
said.
"I don't believe there are any statu
tory considerations that deal with the
exceptions (covered in the
guidelines)."
The proposed guidelines go beyond
the restrictions imposed by California
statutes, according to Zurcher.
He also stressed the need tor a writ
ten policy to assure media access to
police information
"Without a written policy, the peo
ple in the organization may release
the wrong information and damage an
investigation, or they might not re
lease all the information that they
should," he said.
Mixed reactions
Other Santa Clara County police
chiefs who reviewed the proposed
guidelines are unsure if countywide
adoption would be possible or de
sirable.
"I don t see any need for standard
ization of the guidelines. A big plan is
difficult to operate, and most chiefs
feel they do well under the present sys
tem," Los Altos Police Chief Richard
Brannon said

"I doubt that countywide guidelines
are possible due to the tremendous di
vergence of opinion and philosophy
among the police chiefs," Gilroy Po
lice Chief Gregory Cowart said
Most of the other chiefs emphasized
the need for personal interaction and
individual case flexibility in dealing
with the press.
"It is important that mutual trust
and confidence be fostered between
the press and the police. But the prob
lem arises when the press is digging
around and the police must ask where
the legal boundaries are, " Cowart
said.
"I'm not really a zealot on this is
sue," Zurcher said.
"It doesn't have to be countywide. I
thought it was a good policy, so I
wanted to share it. I think that coun
tywide adoption would result in better
understanding of our policies by the
press," he said.
San ■Jose Mercury News metro edi
tor Pat Dillon summed up the opposi
tion to guidelines held by most jour
nalists interviewed.

"I am categorically against policies
per se defining rights as a reporter and
a citizen, except that reporters must
be mindful of the laws," he said.
"The police and the press are natu
ral adversaries. If the guidelines are
merely policy, and the reporter can
better serve the public by breaking
them, we will not be tied to any policy.
But we will not break the law," he
said.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said he believes the specific
guidelines shouldbe left up to the local
police and press.

"Perhaps recent incidents have
Generated the need for guidelines in
'alo Alto, or maybe they were pro
posed for input," he said.
Cowart volunteered to research the
existing laws and policies of various
police departments with regard to the
release of information to the press. He
will bring his findings and recommen
dations before the county police chiefs
within 60 days, at which time the
guidelines will be reconsidered.
"At that time, we can determine if
there is a common thread or if we are
poles apart," he said.

the press and the police. But the prob
lem arises when the press is digging
around and the police must ask where
the legal boundaries are, " Cowart
said.
"I'm not really a zealot on this is
sue," Zurcher said.
"It doesn't have to be countywide. I
thought it was a good policy, so I
wanted to share it. I think that coun
tywide adoption would result in better
understanding of our policies by the
press," he said.
San ■Jose Mercury News metro edi
tor Pat Dillon summed up the opposi
tion to guidelines held by most jour
nalists interviewed.

"I am categorically against policies
per se defining rights as a reporter and
a citizen, except that reporters must
be mindful of the laws," he said.
"The police and the press are natu
ral adversaries. If the guidelines are
merely policy, and the reporter can
better serve the public by breaking
them, we will not be tied to any policy.
But we will not break the law," he
said.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said he believes the specific
guidelines shouldbe left up to the local
police and press.

"Perhaps recent incidents have
Generated the need for guidelines in
'alo Alto, or maybe they were pro
posed for input," he said.
Cowart volunteered to research the
existing laws and policies of various
police departments with regard to the
release of information to the press. He
will bring his findings and recommen
dations before the county police chiefs
within 60 days, at which time the
guidelines will be reconsidered.
"At that time, we can determine if
there is a common thread or if we are
poles apart," he said.
Local law enforcement officials are
considering countvwide guidelines for
the release of information by police to
the press following recent disputes be
tween the press and police in the area.
Palo Alto Police Chief James
Zurcher said the arrest last month of a
Peninsula Times Tribune photogra
pher. trying to take pictures at the
scene of an accident, prompted him to
write the guidelines.
I felt we needed some ground rules
for our organization to know the
boundaries for dealing with the
press." he said.
The guidelines would give the press
access to all relevant information
with certain exceptions. These excep
tions are:
— when release is prohibited by le
gal restraints;
— when release would hinder a po
lice investigation;
— when the disclosed information
would reveal police tactics;
— when police sources would be re
vealed; or
— if the safety of a media represent
ative or other citizen is jeopardized.
Legal boundaries
Under California law, any author
ized media representative may enter
an area which has been closed off by
police personnel during emergencies,
unless public order or safety would be

threatened by the crossing of police
lines.
The sheriff has the authority to de
termine the line of safety.
"The penal code is ambiguous in its
definition of police lines' ". Zur'/her
said.
"I don't believe there are any statu
tory considerations that deal with the
exceptions (covered in the
guidelines)."
The proposed guidelines go beyond
the restrictions imposed by California
statutes, according to Zurcher.
He also stressed the need tor a writ
ten policy to assure media access to
police information
"Without a written policy, the peo
ple in the organization may release
the wrong information and damage an
investigation, or they might not re
lease all the information that they
should," he said.
Mixed reactions
Other Santa Clara County police
chiefs who reviewed the proposed
guidelines are unsure if countywide
adoption would be possible or de
sirable.
"I don t see any need for standard
ization of the guidelines. A big plan is
difficult to operate, and most chiefs
feel they do well under the present sys
tem," Los Altos Police Chief Richard
Brannon said

"I doubt that countywide guidelines
are possible due to the tremendous di
vergence of opinion and philosophy
among the police chiefs," Gilroy Po
lice Chief Gregory Cowart said
Most of the other chiefs emphasized
the need for personal interaction and
individual case flexibility in dealing
with the press.
"It is important that mutual trust
and confidence be fostered between
the press and the police. But the prob
lem arises when the press is digging
around and the police must ask where
the legal boundaries are, " Cowart
said.
"I'm not really a zealot on this is
sue," Zurcher said.
"It doesn't have to be countywide. I
thought it was a good policy, so I
wanted to share it. I think that coun
tywide adoption would result in better
