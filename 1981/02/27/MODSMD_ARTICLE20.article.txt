## Let's try variation on theme houses 
### 
The purpose of a theme house,
specifically the ethnic theme
houses (Okada, Ujamaa,
Zapata) more than cultural
houses, is to introduce students
to a culture and atmosphere
that may not be familiar to
them. The houses are intended
to promote better under
standing and interaction among
people of diverse cultures and
origins.
As one enters the dining hall
of a theme house, a different
picture appears. The dining
room often looks as if an in
visible ethnic line was drawn
through the center of the room.
Integration is rare and separa
ton seems to be the rule.
Not only is the sight a disturb
ing one, but it is quite ironic that
in the dorms specifically de
signed to promote better in
terrelations, the opposite effect
occurs. What is even more strik
ing is that this segregation is
virtually unheard of in other
dorms.
The reasons for this
phenomenon are many, but one
thing is certain. As currently
structured, theme houses are
not working. Several facts sup
port this contention.
Consider first that theme
houses are perennially some of
the lowest draws on campus.
Residents of theme houses com
prise a substantial portion of the
infamous waiting list each quar
ter. It is not unusual to have up
to 50 percent of the residents on
the waiting list for winter quar
ter.
An inordinate number of com

plaints concerning theme
houses arise every year but are
continually ignored. The vast
discontent within these houses
consistently undermines their
basic purpose. Funds and ac
tivities are divided between
those related to the theme and
those which are not, almost like
maintaining two dorms under
one budget.
The division leaves all ac
tivities sparsely funded and
poorly attended. The perverse
policy mandating that the ma
jority of the people in the house
not belong to the culture of the
theme perpetuates the problem.
All this policy ensures is that the
majority of the people do not
want to live in the theme houses.
The facts seem to substan
tiate a need for critical eval
uation of theme houses, an issue
that has been avoided for too
long. It is time for Residential
Education and representatives
of the theme houses to seek
ways of improving theme
houses by making them more at
tractive and harmonious for
their residents.
A survey of the current resi
dents would certainly indicate
the deteriorating situation and a
survey is an essential, although
not a final step.
The fundamental problem
with theme houses is that a ma
jority of the people do not want
to be there and vehemently re
sent their assignments. One rea
son is that the theme houses are
located in what are generally
considered poor complexes and

are tabbed the "worst of the
worst."
This problem might be over
come by moving theme houses
to more attractive complexes
such as the new dorm, where
they will naturally attract stu
dents. Preferably, they would
be to a row house type residence
in which only those who choose
to live there would.
An example of the success of
this latter strategy is the favor
able conditions of the French,
German, and Italian houses on
campus. One can imagine a si
miliar disfavorable situation at
these houses if the majority of
the people failed to speak the
language or did not want to be
there.
The idea of moving the theme
houses requires space, and it
may take a while before it could
be enacted. However, the situ
ation cannot afford delay, and
interim actions must be taken.
One interim action might be a
non-refundable housing fee
assessment in addition to house
dues and required of housed.
The revenue generated could be
divided among the three theme
houses. The assessment could
be a dollar or less and it might
alleviate some of the current
problems. It might counteract
the unattractive settings of the
theme houses. Students might
be more content with their sur
roundings if their house budget
were three times as large as any
other dorm on campus.
Moreover, with this plethora
of funds both theme activities

and non-theme activities would
receive sufficient support. This
would produce less bickering
over monetary resources, and
the house activities would be of
a much higher quality. These
activities might also attract
more students from around
campus to the neglected theme
houses.
The additional money,
though, will not be a complete
solution. Rather, the staffs at
theme houses must, from the
very beginning, work toward a
more harmonious environment.
They must promote, through ac
tivities and rap sessions, better
interrelations among groups
and consciously avoid the segre
gation that frequently occurs.
Let's face it, nobody is fooling
anybody by pretending theme
houses are working. They are
not. Granted, not all theme
houses are in a deteriorating
state and some houses are
worse than others, but the fact
remains that there is con
siderable discontent with theme
houses and there is still no sub
stantial action to alleviate the
situation.
It is only fair to the residents
of theme houses that the situ
ation be improved; any action
would be better than the current
policy of "ignore and forget."
Perhaps the misfortune of the
"4000 and above draw number
club - ' could be eliminated.
