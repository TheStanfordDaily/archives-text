Paternalistic letter
I am writing in answer to
President Donald Kennedy's
letter of January 27, 1981, in
which he stated (regarding the
unionization movement at Stan
ford) that he "believes it would
be a mistake to unionize." He in
dicated in his letter that he is
aware of "real problems involv
ing salary, leaves, benefits, ca
reer opportunities and working
conditions for office and library
staff," and that "ultimately the
University has to deal with
these issues."
I wonder if the University is
only seeing that it has the ul
timate responsibility for deal

ing with problems as long
standing as those mentioned in
his letter. I suspect that the
University has not effectively
addressed these issues because
the University has not until now
faced a unionization movement
by its clerical staff. I find it very
difficult to believe that there is
no relationship between the sud
den interest in our plight ex
pressed by Kennedy's office and
the clerical and library staff's
growing interest in union repre
sentation.
These problems have existed
here at Stanford for years. If
Kennedy's office is as con
cerned as he would have us be
lieve, why were these problems
not formally and effectively
dealt with by past admini
trations? Clearly, the reason is
that the staff had not previously
been "talking union." We had no
power and thus presented no
threat to the administration.
Stanford could do what it liked
with our livelihoods and there
was very little we could do about
it. We have now begun to show
strength, unity and the will to
come together. And (not so sur
prisingly) just at this time,
when the administration prom
ises us that they will act in our
behalf on these matters I think
that Kennedy's credibility is
somewhat lacking!
With union representation, I
am assured by contract rather
than promise of having an ade
quate salary, a just grievance
procedure, and benefits com
parable to those offered by
nearby employers in the private
sector. I am guaranteed to re
ceive comparable wages for
similar tasks. These matters
are important to me both as a
woman and as a worker. For too
long now, I have trusted pater
nal assurances that my welfare
was being locked after. I have
no more trust left. I support the
union because promises such as
Kennedy's are easily broken,
however unhappily; and prom
ises will not feed, clothe,
educate or house my son.

Med-fly folly
As concerned under
graduates, our consciences
have been offended by the re
cent unprovoked assault on one
of God's small peaceful
creatures. The defenseless
Med-fly immigrated to Califor
nia for the equality and civil jus
tice which democracy affords.
Yet, the social, economic and
ecological importance of the
Med-fly has been overlooked by
ignorant local authorities â€” a
classic case of group-think. The
entire ecological pyramid and
food chain of greater Palo Alto
and all of Northern California is
threatened by these ruthless, in
secticide-toting vigilantes. It is
time for all good men and wom
en to understand the dire cir
cumstances of the crisis which
confronts us and to envision the
folly of our blind deeds.
We ask you to join us by tying
yellow ribbons around your fruit
trees as a sign of unity against
these deranged health author
ities. In addition, demonstrate
your dedication to the innocent
Med-fly in a candlelight march,
noon Monday, at White Plaza.
We can no longer stand idly by
as millions of forlorn Med-flies
are slaughtered at our feet.

No mascot
As an individual alumnus and
one who has been painfully close
to the mascot controversy, I ap
plaud Jed Dempsey's "no
mascot" solution (Daily, Feb.
9). Stanford's athletes are men
and women, Stanford men and
women, not funny birds, trees,
buzzards or mythical monsters.
With a band like ours, who needs
mascots anyway?
But there is no need to deride
the use of "Cardinal" or to feel
offended by some poor old
sportswriter's use of "Cards."
His readers will understand who
he is writing about. Stanford

and Cardinal, after all have
been synonymous since 1892.
Cardinal is the color that
symbolizes Stanford to the
whole academic world, not just
to that part of it where in
tercollegiate athletics are im
portant. In all academic cere
monials it is the color that those
who have earned Stanford
degrees are entitled to wear in
their hoods. Cardinal is the iden
tifying color in the University
and School flags. It is also the
color of the President's flag and
the gown that symbolized
Donald Kennedy's investiture
at his inauguration.
When Stanford was some
thing people joined together to
sing about, which wasn't so long
ago, "The Cardinal is Waving"
was one song every student
knew by heart.
The need for more synonyms
or a mascot is new past. I wish
everybody would just "Come
Join the Band" and give a cheer
for Stanford!!!

Tenure denials
As regards your article "Con
troversy results from tenure de
nials" (Daily, Feb. 20), I believe
there are a host of vexing ques
tions and issues about tenure
procedures at Stanford and
elsewhere. But I sorely fear that
the very least effective way to
raise or deal with them is in the
Daily.
If your article is any indica
tion. such reporting is bound to
lack the requisite sophistication
and subtlety that such issues re
quire. A case in point that is per
sonally disturbing: you report
that I claim that the tenure net
has tightened over the past dec
ade. I stand by this claim. But
your next paragraph, with its
transitional "But," suggests
that I do not share Vice Provost
Gerald Lieberman's view that
policies have been applied even
handedly. While I do not have
the requisite data to actually in
form my view, I presume, and
always have presumed, that
Lieberman's view is accurate.
