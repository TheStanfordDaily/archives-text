## Hell's Angels acquitted 
### Los Angeles Times 
San Francisco — After two
mistrials and a cost in the mil
lions, the government gave up
Wednesday trying to convict the
notorious Hell's Angeles motor
cycle gang on conspiracy and
racketeering charges and asked
a federal court here to dismiss
indictments against 11 gang
members and associates.
"There will be no third trial,"
assistant U.S. Attorney Robert
Mueller told U.S. District Judge
William Orrick.
Federal prosecutors had at
tempted to prove that the
maverick and frequently violent
motorcycle gang had become an
organization engaged in full
time criminal activity some
time in the 1960s and was deeply
involved in an extensive drug
and narcotic operation in
Northern California and
elsewhere, using illegal fire
arms, murder, threats and as
sault to further their enterprise.
But a second trial, which
began last October, ended late
Tuesday with the jury of nine
men and three women advising
Orrick that they were hopeless
ly deadlocked. An earlier trial,
which began in 1979 and con
cluded last July, also ended in a
hung jury for most of the defen
dants.
A juror in the latest trial, Wil
liam Aylward of San Jose, told
reporters Wednesday that the
jury vote was 9 to 3 for acquittal
and described the government's
case as "pretty inept." He also
said jurors found the govern

ment's key witnesses, including
a former Angel who admitted
being paid $30,000 in exchange
for his testimony, "despicable
and beneath contempt."
The jury, for instance, heard
214 witnesses in the second trial
and viewed more than 1000 ex
hibits. Testimony from the trial
filled 62 volumes and 13,500
pages.
Disclosure of the $30,000
payment to ex-Angel Thomas
(Red) Bryant became on of the
most controversial elements in
the case, triggering a demand
by the defense for a mistrial on
the grounds that the govern
ment was bribing its own wit
ness and a statement by Orrick
that he was "outraged" by such
a reward for testimony.
But the payment later was
ruled by Orrick to be proper un
der the federal Witness Protec
tion Program, and he refused
either to declare a mistrial or to
have Bryant's testimony
stricken from the trial record.
Charges were brought against
the Hell's Angels almost two
years ago under federal
Racketeer Influenced and Cor
rupt Organization laws that
were passed during the Nixon
administration and originally
intended to be used as a weapon
against the Mafia.
The broadly worded statutes
enable prosecutors to charge
anyone with having undertaken
a pattern of racketeering if,
within a 10-year period, he or
she has participated in any two
of 32 crimes — ranging from ex

tortion to murder.
But Hunter said Wednesday
that the government will be
much more selective before it
attempts another case under the
racketeering statutes.
The initial trial included 18
defendants, several of whom
were convicted on charges such
as possession of drugs or
possessionor use of firearms but
only one on what prosecutors
considered the important'con
spiracy and racketeering counts
that were the heart of their
case.
Between the first and second
trials, cases against some of the
defendants, including gang
leader Ralph (Sonny) Barger,
were dismissed, trimming the
list of defendants for the second
trial to 11.
Despite the dismissal of the
indictments against them
Wednesday, however, only two
of the 11 were able to walk away
free. The rest either are serving
sentences from previous convic
tions or awaiting trial on other
charges.
