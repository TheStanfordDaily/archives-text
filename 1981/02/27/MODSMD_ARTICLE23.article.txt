# Feared dead in Atlanta
## Children found safe 
### 
Atlanta (AP) — Two black
children have been found
safe — one at a friend's
house, the other in a gym
nasium — after they were re
ported missing in this city
where 18 youngsters have
been found slain, police say.
Both boys — 14-year-old
Termal Heard and 10-year
old Dempster Williams —
were back with their fami
lies Wednesday night, police
said.
Heard, reported missing
early Wednesday, was found
in suburban East Point "over
at a friend's house," police
spokesman Roger Harris
said. Williams, whose disap
pearance was reported Tues
day, was found at a gym on
the city's southwest side.
Neither case had been
added to the official police
list of 20 children — 18 dead
and two missing — which is
maintained by a special 35-
member police task force.
When a child is reported
missing, the missing persons

division of the police bureau
conducts an initial investiga
tion and turns a case over to
the task force only if the
child is not a runaway and
fits the profile of the other
missing and dead children.
Meanwhile, in suburban
DeKalb County, detectives
screening videotapes of the
funeral of 11-year-old Pa
trick Baltazar, the latest of
the victims, have picked out
two men who "acted sus
picious," said police spokes
man Chuck Johnson.
Authorities have begun
trying to track down the child
killer or killers by searching
hundreds of feet of videotape
for anyone who has been
showing up repeatedly at
events associated with the
child cases, such as funerals
and prayer vigils.
Johnson said the two men,
one white and one black, will
be brought in for questioning
if a further search of the
tapes reveals that they have
attended the funerals of oth
er victims.
