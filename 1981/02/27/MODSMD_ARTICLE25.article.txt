# Budget plan to slash state’s federal funds
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — California is
expected to lose $5.5 billion to $6
billion in federal funds next year
if Congress approves the federal
budget cuts proposed by the
Reagan administration, accord
ing to an analysis by The Los
Angeles Times based on de
tailed projections by state and
local officials.
Los Angeles could continue to
dredge its harbor, but trains
from Los Angeles to San Diego,
New Orleans and Chicago would
be terminated, and 500,000
needy California children would
lose their free school lunches
under proposed cuts, officials
say.
As the burden for taking care
of the aged, poor and sick shifts
from federal to state and local
programs, California may pay a
proportionately higher price
than other states because its
programs are more generous.
This new burden on California
state, county and city treasur
ies, expected to hit in the federal
fiscal year starting Oct. 1, could
hardly come at a more difficult
time in the view of state of
ficials.
Surplus exhausted
Not only are local govern
ments now feeling the deep im
pacts of the Proposition 13 tax
cut, but the state's bail-out sur
plus is exhausted, and as of
April 1, many of the state's
150,000 Indochinese refugees
will become ineligible for their
special federal assistance pro
gram.

"1 don't think the state will be
able to come up with the money.
Some people will not get served
anymore. Not only does it shift
costs to the community and
states, but it costs potentially
more money because the kinds
of things to be cut are preven
tive health care," Democratic
Rep. Henry Waxman of Los An
geles, chairman of the House
Commerce subcommittee on
health, said.
Waxman and others intend to
fight hardest to reverse the Rea
gan cutback in Medicare, which
will cost California an esti
mated $11 million this year, and
$260 million in 1982, according to
Elizabeth Robbins, a lobbyist
for San Francisco who special
izes in health and welfare is
sues.
Burden shifted
"All we've done is shift the
burden, and in such a way that
we've increased the cost of
care," Robbins said.
"You end up with people in
the hospital because you're not
giving them preventive medi
cine early on," Democratic
Rep. Norman Mineta of San
Jose, a high-ranking member of
the House Budget Committee,
said.
The federal Medicare (Medi-
Cal in California) cuts will hurt
nursing homes, home health
care, preventive health care
programs, health planning
agencies, and health main
tenance organizations, Waxman
said.
The problem will be
amplified by the loss of more
than 45,000 jobs funded in Cali
fornia by the Comprehensive

Employment Training Act pro
gram, which would be
eliminated in the Reagan
budget. Many of the CETA em
ployees, who now fill such jobs
as nurses' aides, clerks and
janitors, will have to seek local
and state welfare assistance, of
ficials believe.
Women's shelter
A shelter for battered women
in San Jose, which depended on
the CETA program to pay its
nine employees, will almost
certainly have to close, Mineta
said. "We have no mechanism
for substitute funding, so here's
a good program that gets
eliminated."
The Reagan proposals would
cost California state and local
governments $61 million in
CETA funds in the state's 1981
fiscal year ending June 30, and

$331 million for the following fis
cal year, according to a report
being prepared this week by the
California Department of Fi
nance.
The California State Depart
ment of Education could lose
$309.2 million next year in ma
jor federal programs, according
to department Superintendent
Don White.
Because of a proposed $50
million Title I budget cut.
"either all disadvantaged chil
dren will receive fewer services
or as many as 130,000 will be de
nied services," White* esti
mated. About 20,000 migrant
children will lose a $10 million
special migrant grant, 17,000
children will lose $7.6 million in
bilingual education programs,
and 500,000 to 600,000 fewer free
school lunches will be served
each day in California if the $105

million lunch program cut is ap
proved, he said.
Highway cuts
Cuts in federal highway
spending are expected to delay
completion of the Century Free
way in Los Angeles, widening of
280 in San Jose and 505 in Riv
erside, and repair of Los Angel
es's deteriorating freeway sys
tem, according to Susanne Elfv
ing, a lobbyist for San Jose and
other California communities.
Endangered by the budget
cuts will be the Los Angeles peo
ple-mover program, the
Wilshire subway, improve
ments in Los Angeles's Union
Station train track, a BART
turnaround in Daly City, and the
port of Oakland airport connec
tor, according to the unfinished
state Department of Finance re
port.

billion in federal funds next year
if Congress approves the federal
budget cuts proposed by the
Reagan administration, accord
ing to an analysis by The Los
Angeles Times based on de
tailed projections by state and
local officials.
Los Angeles could continue to
dredge its harbor, but trains
from Los Angeles to San Diego,
New Orleans and Chicago would
be terminated, and 500,000
needy California children would
lose their free school lunches
under proposed cuts, officials
say.
As the burden for taking care
of the aged, poor and sick shifts
from federal to state and local
programs, California may pay a
proportionately higher price
than other states because its
programs are more generous.
This new burden on California
state, county and city treasur
ies, expected to hit in the federal
fiscal year starting Oct. 1, could
hardly come at a more difficult
time in the view of state of
ficials.
Surplus exhausted
Not only are local govern
ments now feeling the deep im
pacts of the Proposition 13 tax
cut, but the state's bail-out sur
plus is exhausted, and as of
April 1, many of the state's
150,000 Indochinese refugees
will become ineligible for their
special federal assistance pro
gram.

"1 don't think the state will be
able to come up with the money.
Some people will not get served
anymore. Not only does it shift
costs to the community and
states, but it costs potentially
more money because the kinds
of things to be cut are preven
tive health care," Democratic
Rep. Henry Waxman of Los An
geles, chairman of the House
Commerce subcommittee on
health, said.
Waxman and others intend to
fight hardest to reverse the Rea
gan cutback in Medicare, which
will cost California an esti
mated $11 million this year, and
$260 million in 1982, according to
Elizabeth Robbins, a lobbyist
for San Francisco who special
izes in health and welfare is
sues.
Burden shifted
"All we've done is shift the
burden, and in such a way that
we've increased the cost of
care," Robbins said.
"You end up with people in
the hospital because you're not
giving them preventive medi
cine early on," Democratic
Rep. Norman Mineta of San
Jose, a high-ranking member of
the House Budget Committee,
said.
The federal Medicare (Medi-
Cal in California) cuts will hurt
nursing homes, home health
care, preventive health care
programs, health planning
agencies, and health main
tenance organizations, Waxman
said.
The problem will be
amplified by the loss of more
than 45,000 jobs funded in Cali
fornia by the Comprehensive

Employment Training Act pro
gram, which would be
eliminated in the Reagan
budget. Many of the CETA em
ployees, who now fill such jobs
as nurses' aides, clerks and
janitors, will have to seek local
and state welfare assistance, of
ficials believe.
Women's shelter
A shelter for battered women
in San Jose, which depended on
the CETA program to pay its
nine employees, will almost
certainly have to close, Mineta
said. "We have no mechanism
for substitute funding, so here's
a good program that gets
eliminated."
The Reagan proposals would
cost California state and local
governments $61 million in
CETA funds in the state's 1981
fiscal year ending June 30, and

$331 million for the following fis
cal year, according to a report
being prepared this week by the
California Department of Fi
nance.
The California State Depart
ment of Education could lose
$309.2 million next year in ma
jor federal programs, according
to department Superintendent
Don White.
Because of a proposed $50
million Title I budget cut.
"either all disadvantaged chil
dren will receive fewer services
or as many as 130,000 will be de
nied services," White* esti
mated. About 20,000 migrant
children will lose a $10 million
special migrant grant, 17,000
children will lose $7.6 million in
bilingual education programs,
and 500,000 to 600,000 fewer free
school lunches will be served
each day in California if the $105

million lunch program cut is ap
proved, he said.
Highway cuts
Cuts in federal highway
spending are expected to delay
completion of the Century Free
way in Los Angeles, widening of
280 in San Jose and 505 in Riv
erside, and repair of Los Angel
es's deteriorating freeway sys
tem, according to Susanne Elfv
ing, a lobbyist for San Jose and
other California communities.
Endangered by the budget
cuts will be the Los Angeles peo
ple-mover program, the
Wilshire subway, improve
ments in Los Angeles's Union
Station train track, a BART
turnaround in Daly City, and the
port of Oakland airport connec
tor, according to the unfinished
state Department of Finance re
port.
