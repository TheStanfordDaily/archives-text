New York (AP) — A "very cute" boy, bran
dishing a small silver automatic pistol, robbed the
New York Bank for Savings in Rockefeller Center
of $118 and escaped by darting into the lunch-time
crowd, police said.
At 7 to 10 years old, the boy is the youngest bank
robber of record in a city that has had more than
100 bank robberies so far this year, police said.
He entered the bank at 11:20 a.m. Wednesday
and went into the consumer loan department.
"This is a holdup," he told receptionist Barbara
Grecky, and pointed what appeared to be a .22-
caliber automatic pistol at her.
"This is not a bank," the woman told the boy.
The child then left the consumer loan depart
ment and entered the regular banking section
where he staged the holdup, police said.
Grecky later described the boy as having "big

brown eyes — very cute."
Teller Yvonne Patterson told police she handed
over some bills when he brandished the weapon
and said, "This is a holdup. Don't press any but
tons. Just give me the money in the drawer."
The young bandit stood only about four inches
above the counter, she said.
"He was very calm, like a little man and she
looked at him and thought it was a joke," said Of
ficer Robert McQuade, describing Patterson's re
action.
The boy left the tellers' section through a glass
door leading into an interior lobby and "shook the
bills and jumped up and down" before he fled into
the street, police said.
Grecky notified her superior after the boy left
but he vanished into the midtown Manhattan
crowds by the time police arrived.
