# Women in Israel: a native's view
## 
### Karen Halbo 
"In 1948, it was only natural
that the women fought
alongside the men . . it was our
war of independence," declared
Blanche Kay, an Israeli judge
who spoke on "Women in Israel
Society" to a small group at Col
umbae House on Tuesday after
noon.
Kay, a judge in Tel Aviv,
spoke for an hour addressing
various women's rights issues
including the labor laws, child
care, marriage and divorce
laws, and abortion. Kay, who re
ceived her J.D. from Jerusalem
University, answered questions
from the audience, and told of
her own experiences as a work
ing woman and mother of three
children.
An Israeli law providing
equal pay for essentially equal
work was passed in 1964, said
Kay. But, Kay added, "The
tricky part of this law is the
word essentially."
Israel has a law providing
equal job opportunity for men
and women. Kay remarked,
"There is a catch in this also, for
the law says except if the job is
detrimental to a woman's
health or her ability to bear a
child."
How do some employers cir
cumvent this law? They claim a
certain job would make a wom
an unable to bear a child, Kay
said, citing that employers may
say "it's such a nerve-racking
job."
No woman may work night
shift (midnight to 6 a.m.) unless
she works at an airport or as a
nurse or firefighter, states Is
raeli law. The law also provides
that those women who do work
the night shift must, during tne

course of their shift, "be given
at least one hot drink," Kay ex
plained with a smile.
A feminist went to court
about this law, said Kay, but the
court decided that, "A law
which gives a woman a privilege
is legal so long as it doesn't dis
criminate."
Women who become pregnant

omen and men are equal (except in the
areas of marriage and divorceJ, and every
laiv that discriminates is mill and void.'

or adopt a child are given three
months' salary by the govern
ment. For working women the
salary is 70 percent of their reg
ular wage. Women who aren't
working receive three months
of the national average salary.
Pregnant women are able to
leave their jobs for up to one
year, and if their position re
ceives any pay raises or promo
tions, when they return, they re
ceive the benefits.
Substituting for women who
are on leave from their jobs are
students waiting to be called up
for service, and mothers who
decide to take a temporary job
"for variety," Kay said.
No one can fire a woman until
a year after the birth of her
child, and a woman becomes
eligible for all of these benefits
after she has been employed by
the same employer for more
than 10 months.
"It works both ways," re
marked Kay, "It encourages the
birth rate, and it encourages

women to work '
Child care centers for work
ing women are run by many dif
ferent groups, including the
Ministry of Labor, the city trade
unions, and the women's or
ganizations, said Kay.
"They are run very efficient
ly," Kay asserted, "They teach
the children good manners, and

give them very good food."
Kay has had a nursemaid for
her three children. She remi
nisced about the first nursemaid
she had for her two boys, saying.
"She was a Hungarian woman
She took care of them, took
them out in the sun for at least
two hours a day . . . she taught
them all sorts of superstitions."
In 1953, the women's equal
rights amendment was in
stituted in Israel. "Women and
men are equal, (except in the
areas of marriage and divorce),
and every law that dis
criminates is null and void,"
said Kay, summing up the law.
The exceptions of the law of
equality, in the areas of mar
riage and divorce are based on
the strong religious values of
the Jewish and Moslem faiths.
"Religious norms have become
national norms," said Kay.
The Jewish religion is based
on Mosaic law which, Kay
stated, "discriminates in iavor
of men. Only a man is capable of

dissolving a marriage (divorc
ing his spouse). Marriage (un
der Mosaic law) is between the
man and the Lord The man
promises the Lord that he is tak
ing this woman.
The Moslem religion is based
on Mohammedan law which.
Kay remarked. Is in itself
progressive and pro-woman, but
the interpretation by the Imams
have given Islam a reactional
interpretation."
Men married under Jewish
faith are able to obtain a
divorce, but the woman must
appeal to the Rabbinical court
(which has a limited juris
diction which is specified by
statute). If the woman is not
granted a divorce, she may ap
peal to the High Court, which
will only intervene if her basic
natural rights are being over
looked.
In the Moslem taith, mar
riage is the contract between
the man and the guardian of the
woman. Kay observed. "The
man pays the guardian to be
able to marry the woman The
women have always been
thought of as laborers."
For Moslem men, if a man
says to his wife, "I divorce
thee" three times in front of wit
nesses (two men or four wom
en), he is divorced. Kay men
tioned that Moslem women can
not procure a divorce, and once
divorced,the woman cannot re
marry her husband until she has
gone through another marriage.
In 1971, a law was passed gov
erning the property of married
couples. Said Kay, "the propor
ty is not under Mosaic law (thus
making married couples' prop
erty community property) un

less both parties agree to go to
the Rabbinical court."
Until six months ago, Israeli
law allowed a woman to get an
abortion if she went in front of a
medical committee and re
quested one for health or social
reasons. Six months ago this law
was changed. Kay explained,
"The new government had to

have a coalition with the ultra
orthodox faction, so allowing
women to get abortions tor so
cial reasons was cut.''
Kay worked as a lawyer for a
private firm and as a judge
while her two sons and her
daughter were growing up. On
working and raising children.
"It's hard, but it's possible,"

said Kay.
Commenting on her home
lite, "I feel this is my real place
my chores, I would never
give them up . my career is
something else It is so reward
ing when I talk about a woman
having a career . . . it's to be in
the lifestream ... to be alive
... to stay broadminded."
