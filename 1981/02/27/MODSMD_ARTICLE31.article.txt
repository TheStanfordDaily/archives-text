# Demoralizing defeat
## Sun Devils outshine Cards as reality sets in yet again SPORTS 
### Chris Haft 
Tempe, Ariz. — It was the
working class versus the pow
erful elitists: Stanford's mod
estly-talented hard workers
against Arizona State's physi
cally impeccable natural ath
letes.
And as is usually the case in
real life, the elitists prevailed.
ASU defeated Stanford last
night, 79-54, in a Pacific-10 Con
ference men's basketball game
at the University Activities Cen
ter.
Except for a spirited Cardinal
comeback beginning shortly
before halftime and ending soon
after the break, the game went
as expected, with the fifth
ranked Sun Devils effectively
utilizing their superior height,
quickness, and shooting ability.
"I think we just saw this eve
ning, particularly in the first
nine minutes of the first half,
why they are ranked fifth in the
country," Stanford head coach
Dick Dißiaso said.
During that nine-minute
stretch, the Sun Devils scored
on each of their first 13
possessions, building a 26-9 lead.
"They were much too big,
much too physical, and much
too good," Dißiaso added.
Those three adjectives ap
.plied to the Sun Devil starters,
each scoring in double figures.
•Center Alton Lister dominated
underneath, using every inch of
•his 7-foot frame to collect 18
points, 11 rebounds, and six
blocked shots. He and 6-foot-8
forwards Sam Williams (16
points on 7 for 10 shooting) and
Johnny Nash (12 points, 7 re
bounds ) made life miserable for
Stanford's Tront line.
"They are too big," protested
Card John Revelli. "I'm glad
they're seniors."
What can a player do against
such giants? "Pray," said Hans
Wichary.
Also, ASU guards Byron Scott
and Lafayette Lever con
tributed 16 and 13 points, respec
tively. Scott, who at 6-foot-5 has
an almost unfair height advan
tage over most guards, added
eight rebounds.

Even against all this ex
cellence, Stanford trailed only
43-37 early in the second half.
Twice, however, the Cards
failed to cut the difference to
four — first Wichary traveled,
and then center David
Nussbaum's short tiptoe
jumper went agonizingly in and
out.
ASU responded with six con
secutive points on Lister's lay
in, Williams' slam-dunk on
Nash's alley-oop pass, and
Scott's 18-foot baseline jumper
that made it 45-37 with 13:13 to
go. Stanford, now 4-12 in the
Pac-10 and 8-17 overall, never
seriously threatened thereafter.
Of course, when a team
makes only 35.1 percent of it's
shots (19-for-54) as Stanford did,
it's difficult to mount much of a
challenge. "We didn't show
much poise on offense,"
Dißiaso acknowledged.
The Stanford coach never
theless praised Revelli (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Brian
Welch (14 points) for their ef
forts. Refusing to be in
timidated by ASU's big men,
both Cards determinedly per
sisted in driving tathe basket.
"I was pleased with the way
Revelli and Welch kept coming
back on the inside when they
were getting their shots thrown
back at them," Dißiaso.
What the Cards probably
wanted thrown back at them in
the early going was their air
plane tickets for home.
ASU made every kind of shot
imaginable while building it's
big early lead. Williams not only
rammed through two dunks af
ter descending from the
stratosphere, but also sank a
jumper from the top of the key
while falling down backwards.
Nash scored on a turn-around
one-hander and Scott hit
jumpers short and long. School
was definitely out and the play
ground belonged to the Sun Dev
ils.
The Sun Devils extended their
advantage to 38-17 on Lister's

lay-in 4 :52 before halt time. Af
ter a technical foul on. of all peo
ple, Stanford team manager
Bob Foley, Lever hit a free
throw, giving ASU a 39-21 lead
with 2:44 left.
Then the Cards put their work
ethic to good use, scoring nine
points in a row to slice ASU's
lead to 39-30 by halftime. Roger
Lemons sank an 18-foot jumper,
Revelli followed in a missed
shot and canned two free
throws, Keith Jones added a
free throw and Nussbaum hit
two more 1-pointers.
Stanford's comeback was
aided by the absences of Nash
and Williams, who had com
bined for 16 points on seven-for
seven shooting in the initial 10
minutes of the first half, but sat
out the remainder of the period
while ASU head coach Ned Wulk
experimented with his un
reliable reserves.
ASU maintained a 43-33 lead
early in the second half, but
Welch hit two jumpers in less
than half a minute to make it
43-37 with 16:10 left.
Then reality, in the form of
Sun Devil dominance, set in.
