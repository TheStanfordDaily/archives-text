American sport has become the property of the media. Conse
quently, what better way to resolve the many conflicts that arise
because of lousy officiating than through television?
Football for instance, ought to be called America's favorite
pastime rather than baseball. When a sport grows to such a pro
portion that most of the country not only watches it. but bets on it
as well, we better be awfully sure that the games are called cor
rectly. Instant replay is one badly needed measure that can
ensure just that.
Those who argue that human error is part of the fun forget the
rage that a lousy call can inspire. Rage is not my favorite pas
time. I do, however, love to see a beautiful play without in
terference from officials, whose motives are at times dubious.
Officiating has come to dominate the game so much that one
rotten call can decide the outcome of a game. Even the place
ment of the ball, one little foot, determines whether a team has a
first down or not.
Ex-Oakland Raider head coach John Madden once explained
officiating to work something like this. "It's third down, so you
go up the middle. Ref comes running up waving his hands, and
picks up the ball to place it. If he puts it down in front of his foot
you get the first down, drive for a touchdown, win the game, go to
the playoffs. If he puts it down in back of his foot, you punt, lose
the game, and go home."
Human error is not so fun anymore when one considers the for
tunes that might be riding on the official decision. To pro
fessional athletes who have jobs and a paycheck at stake, and
bettors who have hard-earned money riding, instant replay could
be the best innovation since mayonnaise.
One might even take issue witn the term "human error." Any
time big gambling money becomes part of a sport there is always
the danger that shady practices are involved as well. Most fans
scream in pain implication that "shaving points" (the art
of shaping a game score with relation to the Las Vegas betting
line, and getting paid for it) might go on in professional football.
Quarterbacks, and officials in fact, are in the best position de
termine the game score.
To those who like to defend the integrity of pro sports, sorry if
the thought makes you uncomfortable. But it is something to
think about, and instant replay might be the only way to protect
the athletes and fans.
