Imagine, if you will, the 1982 Super Bowl. Jim Plunkett fakes
to Kenny King up the middle, and unleashes a bomb to Cliff
Branch, who makes a diving grab just inside the corner of the end
zone. Touchdown, Oakland! But wait — the Ham fans are upset
at the call, so the officials decide to let "it" decide
"It" is a computerized instant replay machine, and it enables
the rets to examine the play from 73 :, h different angles. The prob
lem is, three rets think that the cameras show that he was in —
while the other four observe, from their viewing perspective,
that Branch was out. Hold on a minute, the umpire is one of the
trio that think the Raider receiver was in, and therefore he
vetoes the four-to-three vote, and rules the touchdown good. . .
Sound ridiculous? You bet it does. But according to some, the
almighty instant replay machine could save football from the
sins of incompetent officiating. Bull.
Letting a machine decide the calls on the field is almost as ex
citing as watching Star Trek. If computers are going to officiate
games, then why not just play with robots in the first place? Bet
ter yet, why not just let Ted Hendricks and Vince Ferragamo
play Head-to- Head electronic football to decide the outcome for
their respective clubs? Sports are played by people, they're ob
served by people, and they're enjoyed by people — so let's make
sure they're officiated by people.
Besides, who would decide just what plays need to be checked 9
The players? The coaches'' The uproarious hometown fans?
Gosh, we better check every single penalty, or even every sin
gle play to make sure that the refs didn't blow an offsides call, or
miss something. We better let BBIR (Big Brother Instant Re
play ) decide, just to make sure, especially since we humans are
so incompetent.
I'm sorry, but football just cannot afford to use instant replay
machines. Literally. Do you know how much such a system
would cost? I d rather use the money to give the underpaid refs a
raise, luring more competent types in, and diminishing the
chances for temptation for shaving points and such. The extra
cash saved could also be used to hold clinics and improve the fa
cilities for officials.
Having such a system is not infallible at any rate, because the
vision that appears on the screen has to be interpreted.
The same guy that makes a call that you disagree with on Sunday
afternoon (as Tommy Bell would say on the Schlitz showdowns,
"live"), is just as likely to see it differently from you on the tube.
We need the human element in officiating — the instantaneous
decisions made by the men in the striped shirts add a great deal
of excitement and enthusiasm to the game, and it all evens out
pretty much in the end anyway.
I'm not saying that the officials are perfect — by any means —
but just that instant replays are not the answer. (By the way, the
Raiders win Super Bowl XIV, 35-14.)
