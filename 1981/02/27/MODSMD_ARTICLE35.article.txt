The Stanford men's volleyball
team wandered into a game of
blindman's bluff against the
University of Hawaii Wednes
day night, and lost in four
games. .
Cardinal head coach Fred
Sturm had never seen the Ha
waiian team play before, and
consequently could only guess
at the outcome. He was able to
make use of the scores from
USC's encounter with UOH (the
Trojans won two of two

matches), but that was about it.
"I thought we would do fairly
well," he said,
Which is exactly what the
Cardinals did in the first half of
the match. They won a close
game, 15-13, with solid and more
importantly, consistent play.
"We played well enough to
win," Sturm said.
The Cardinals kept it up in the
second game, leaping to a 13-8
lead, but then disaster struck.
UOH scored six points in a row
and the game became a point

trade off, until the Hawaiian
team finally won, 17-15.
The first two games took 90
minutes to complete, but UOH
seized the initiative in the third
and fourth games and wiped the
Cardinals out before they had a
chance to catch their breath,
15-8, 15-5.
UOH took control over a team
that has a long way to go in age
and experience; according to
Sturm the Hawaiian team
seemed to gain consistency as
the Cardinals became more spo

radic. When asked how he
planned to combat that in
consistency in the future Sturm
said, "I guess we will just have
to take our bumps and bruises,
and hopefully become steadier
for it."
"It is beginning to sink in
what our strengths and goals
are. and what they should be,"
he continued. "The people on
the team are disappointed by
the loss, but not discouraged, by
any means."
