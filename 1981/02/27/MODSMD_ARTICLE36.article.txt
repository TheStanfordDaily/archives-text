# Pac-10 track begins
## 
### Paul Brewer 
After a relatively low-key,
non-scoring meet with San Jose
State last Saturday, the track
team will face its first Pac-10
competition of the season in a
double-dual meet with Arizona
and Occidental tomorrow at
Stanford Stadium. This week,
the women will join the men in
what should be an all-around ex
citing meet.
For the men, the event will
combine a new intraconference
contest with an old rivalry, as
the Cardinals haven't faced the
Arizona Wildcats in dual com-
Setition in recent years, while
le Oxy dual meet is a tradition
which has lasted for many sea
sons.
Although Arizona graduated
their two NCAA-meet scorers
from a year ago, the Wildcats
are bolstered by a new group of
Nigerian junior college
transfers, and Card coach
Brooks Johnson feels that "they
could even have a better team
that last year's." In particular,
steeplechaser Harrison Koroso
could push the Cards' young trio
to topping their notable per
formances of last week.
Johnson dubbed Occidental

"giant killers" and pointed out
that "they are always ready for
a good meet." The Division 111
powerhouse has always been
tough for Stanford.
On the individual level,
freshman sprinter Fred Wil
liams, after recovering from a
"small leg injury," will make
his Stanford debut in what
should be a hotly-contested 400-
meter relay.
The women, who battle the
same two schools, will be open
ing their 1981 season with
tomorrow's meet. Stanford's
rapidly developing women's
squad will be vastly strength
ened by an outstanding group of
freshmen. Most notable among
them are: cross-country star
Ellen Lyons, weight-thrower
Carol Cady, and all-arounders
Marcia Martin, Susan Burrus.
and Lynnae Warren. With such a
fine group, it is no wonder that
coach Laurel Treon claims that
"we are very anxious to get
started with the season."
The hammer throw will start
things off at 11:30 at Angell
Field, and the running events
will begin at noon at Stanford
Stadium.
