## Top college basketball teams: an overview 
### 
The nation's number one college basketball team
is undefeated, has a dominating big man. shoots un
consciously. and plays vicious defense If this wasn't
the sixth year A.J.W. (After John Wooden), you'd
swear on your grad school applications that this
team is UCLA.

Commentary

Ah, but how things have changed' These days, the
country's top team is Oregon State — a talented ag
gregation of /ew)j<7i-name ballplayers (anonymity
can only withstand so many media blitzes) whose
only misfortune thus far has been to play its home
games in the boondocks, a.k.a. Corvallis. Oregon
Despite their locale — or perhaps thanks to it (Or
egon State's prowess snuck up on a lot of people) —
coach Ralph Miller's team developed into quite
a steamroller. With burly six-foot-eleven Steve
Johnson tallying at will inside v at a 20 point-per
game clip), with the club's nonpareil backcourt trio
of Lester Conner. Ray Blume. and Mark Radford
creating 31 different varieties of mayhem ev
erywhere else on the court, and with a horde of ter
rific reserves pumpin em in from the pines, Oregon
State has hit upon a versatile — and, to this point,
unbeatable— formula.
And yet, at least on paper, the Beavers are far
from unstoppable. There is not one consistent re
bounder among the bunch, and only Johnson and
freshman Charlie Sitton go to the boards with any
sort of feeling. Having two capable rebounders is
normally an asset, but Johnson and Sitton are so
penalty-prone that both would probably foul out of a
wheelchair game. Since LSU. DePaul, Virginia and
their ilk do not play in four-wheelers, Oregon State

must find a way to keep their big men in the fray or
else face an early chilling in next month's NCAA
Playoffs
Which brings us to the point. The NCAA Playoffs.
One of the few sports spectacles that, as far as the
players are concerned, is contested just for the fun
of it. What kind of fun° Oh you know, the kind of fun
that derived from "just playing the
game". . and. upon playing it well, watching one's
agent the only creature in captivity greedier than
your average undergraduate athletic star ( tack on
some zeroes to that all-important NBA contract.
But pro contracts can wait until June. Right now,
the mind turns to more intellectual questions — such
as (in the immortal parlance of Louisville jumpshot
major Pancho Wright), "Will the 'Ville go to the
Phil?" Translation: Will defending national cham
pion Louisville be on hand for the Final Four in Phil
adelphia (March 28-30). To answer that question —
and hopefully some others — here's a rundown on
the loaded squads just itching to gun down Oregon
State and lay claim to national honors themselves:
L<)l 'ISVILLE (18-8, No. 20 in the AP Poll): Two
months ago. it was fashionable to dump on these
"chumps." Louisville was two-and-seven and col
lapsing. Now, the only ones folding up are Cardinal
opponents. Louisville won 12 straight and ap
pears to be hitting its stride at just the right time.
Keving the surge are flashy freshman guard Lan
caster Gordon — who teamed with steady Jerry
Eaves to solidify the once-shaky backcourt — and
frontcourter Derek Smith (whose 12-for-12 shooting
explosion turned out the lights at Marquette two
weeks ago.)
LSI' (27-1. No 2): What's the best conference in
the country 0 Big-10? ACC? Pac-10? Forget it. This

year the SEC is where it's at. There's Kentucky
(21-4, No. 9). There's Tennessee (19-6. No. 10). and
there's up-and-coming Georgia Most of all, though,
there's LSU. Dale Brown's Bayou Bengals are
quick, deep, and dangerous. They've also won 26
straight Showing the way has been six-foot-seven
Rudy Macklin But this is hardly a one-man show
Ethan Martin and Johnny (Bullet) Jones are wick
edly fast at the point. Howard Carter and super sixth
man Willie Simms are deadly from anywhere, and
Greg Cook and Leonard Mitchell provide the muscle
all championship teams need. And this is a football
school?
VIRGINIA (23-2. No. 3) Ralph Sampson is Ameri
ca's best collegian, but his teammates are a bit
slow. Without taking awav from star gunner Jeff
Lamp or strongman Lee Raker, UVA's title hopes
rest with The Man. The more Sampson handles the
ball, the better the Cavs will do. After back-to-back
losses to Notre Dame and Wake Forest, Virginia
can do a lot better.
I)pPAUL (24-1. No. 4): So much talent and so lit
tle desire. When the Blue Demons come to play,
though, they are the best. Period. Most of the time,
however, DePaul does little more than sleepwalk. A
foolishly weak schedule and the ever-expanding hot
dog tendencies of star forward Mark Agguire (25
points per game) have made the Demons' team dis
cipline an even bigger joke than Agguire's
classroom attendance. If Big Mark — an alleged ac
counting major — can wait a month before accoun
tin* his NBA (sss) worth, DePaul should at least
make it to Philadelphia.
All that said, who's going to win the 48-team jam
boree? Damned if I know.

VIRGINIA (23-2. No. 3) Ralph Sampson is Ameri
ca's best collegian, but his teammates are a bit
slow. Without taking awav from star gunner Jeff
Lamp or strongman Lee Raker, UVA's title hopes
rest with The Man. The more Sampson handles the
ball, the better the Cavs will do. After back-to-back
losses to Notre Dame and Wake Forest, Virginia
can do a lot better.
I)pPAUL (24-1. No. 4): So much talent and so lit
tle desire. When the Blue Demons come to play,
though, they are the best. Period. Most of the time,
however, DePaul does little more than sleepwalk. A
foolishly weak schedule and the ever-expanding hot
dog tendencies of star forward Mark Agguire (25
points per game) have made the Demons' team dis
cipline an even bigger joke than Agguire's
classroom attendance. If Big Mark — an alleged ac
counting major — can wait a month before accoun
tin* his NBA (sss) worth, DePaul should at least
make it to Philadelphia.
All that said, who's going to win the 48-team jam
boree? Damned if I know.
The nation's number one college basketball team
is undefeated, has a dominating big man. shoots un
consciously. and plays vicious defense If this wasn't
the sixth year A.J.W. (After John Wooden), you'd
swear on your grad school applications that this
team is UCLA.

Commentary

Ah, but how things have changed' These days, the
country's top team is Oregon State — a talented ag
gregation of /ew)j<7i-name ballplayers (anonymity
can only withstand so many media blitzes) whose
only misfortune thus far has been to play its home
games in the boondocks, a.k.a. Corvallis. Oregon
Despite their locale — or perhaps thanks to it (Or
egon State's prowess snuck up on a lot of people) —
coach Ralph Miller's team developed into quite
a steamroller. With burly six-foot-eleven Steve
Johnson tallying at will inside v at a 20 point-per
game clip), with the club's nonpareil backcourt trio
of Lester Conner. Ray Blume. and Mark Radford
creating 31 different varieties of mayhem ev
erywhere else on the court, and with a horde of ter
rific reserves pumpin em in from the pines, Oregon
State has hit upon a versatile — and, to this point,
unbeatable— formula.
And yet, at least on paper, the Beavers are far
from unstoppable. There is not one consistent re
bounder among the bunch, and only Johnson and
freshman Charlie Sitton go to the boards with any
sort of feeling. Having two capable rebounders is
normally an asset, but Johnson and Sitton are so
penalty-prone that both would probably foul out of a
wheelchair game. Since LSU. DePaul, Virginia and
their ilk do not play in four-wheelers, Oregon State

must find a way to keep their big men in the fray or
else face an early chilling in next month's NCAA
Playoffs
Which brings us to the point. The NCAA Playoffs.
One of the few sports spectacles that, as far as the
players are concerned, is contested just for the fun
of it. What kind of fun° Oh you know, the kind of fun
that derived from "just playing the
game". . and. upon playing it well, watching one's
agent the only creature in captivity greedier than
your average undergraduate athletic star ( tack on
some zeroes to that all-important NBA contract.
But pro contracts can wait until June. Right now,
the mind turns to more intellectual questions — such
as (in the immortal parlance of Louisville jumpshot
major Pancho Wright), "Will the 'Ville go to the
Phil?" Translation: Will defending national cham
pion Louisville be on hand for the Final Four in Phil
adelphia (March 28-30). To answer that question —
and hopefully some others — here's a rundown on
the loaded squads just itching to gun down Oregon
State and lay claim to national honors themselves:
L<)l 'ISVILLE (18-8, No. 20 in the AP Poll): Two
months ago. it was fashionable to dump on these
"chumps." Louisville was two-and-seven and col
lapsing. Now, the only ones folding up are Cardinal
opponents. Louisville won 12 straight and ap
pears to be hitting its stride at just the right time.
Keving the surge are flashy freshman guard Lan
caster Gordon — who teamed with steady Jerry
Eaves to solidify the once-shaky backcourt — and
frontcourter Derek Smith (whose 12-for-12 shooting
explosion turned out the lights at Marquette two
weeks ago.)
LSI' (27-1. No 2): What's the best conference in
the country 0 Big-10? ACC? Pac-10? Forget it. This

year the SEC is where it's at. There's Kentucky
(21-4, No. 9). There's Tennessee (19-6. No. 10). and
there's up-and-coming Georgia Most of all, though,
there's LSU. Dale Brown's Bayou Bengals are
quick, deep, and dangerous. They've also won 26
straight Showing the way has been six-foot-seven
Rudy Macklin But this is hardly a one-man show
Ethan Martin and Johnny (Bullet) Jones are wick
edly fast at the point. Howard Carter and super sixth
man Willie Simms are deadly from anywhere, and
Greg Cook and Leonard Mitchell provide the muscle
all championship teams need. And this is a football
school?
