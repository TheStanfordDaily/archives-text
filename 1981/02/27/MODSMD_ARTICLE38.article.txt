# Cardinal gymnasts take on Arizona Wildcats
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's gymnastics teams find
themselves in a similar situation to last
week as far as their weekend competi
tion goes — Sadao Hamada's men are
predicted underdogs to the University
of Arizona, while Jackie Walker's
women are clear favorites to beat the
women Wildcats.
The odds may differ for the two
Cardinal squads in their final home ap
pearance this season, a 7:30 p.m. affair
at Maples Pavilion tonight, but they
share a common objective. More im
portant than team finishes are the team
and individual scores, as the averages
of these final meets will determine
post-season competition possibilities.
The Card women will be gambling
for their regional bid. hoping to roll
some high numbers.
"We want to get 140 points or bet-

ter." said Walker. "We almost did it —
we came about as close as you can last
weekend." Against California, Stan
ford compiled its second highest team
score ever. 139.85. the 18th best effort in
the country.
By comparison. Arizona has been
averaging 10 to 13 points less, accord
ing to Walker. "They're averaging
about 127 to 130. about like Washington
State." she said.
Fans can look forward to the same
dynamic performers and routines as
the Berkeley spectators witnessed last
Saturday, as Walker will go with the
same line-up tonight. Merilyn Chap
man. Karen Hall, Anne Smith, Julie
Bledsoe. Jeanette Lacoste and Caryn
Lucido are all slated for all-around
competition.
"I think they'll have basically the
same routines — they're just getting

better at their technique," Walker
said. "We've got to get every tenth of a
point possible on every routine by de
creasing the number of errors in the
routines."
An interesting angle to the Arizona
dual meet is that the Wildcats' first
year head coach, Jim Gault, is the
former coach of Cards Trina Wiggins
and Chapman from their days at the
Diablo Gymnastics Club.
In the men's half of the
doubleheader, the rollercoaster Arizo
na squad has a five-point advantage
over Stanford, according to Hamada.
"They have their ups and downs," he
said. "Last week they scored 263 points
and two weeks ago I saw their score,
about 250 points. I guess if they come up
here with a full team, all their guys
healthy, they are probably five points
better than us. We have a definite home

ground advantage over them, so we
have some chance of beating them.
"Their top all-around man is Frank
Thompson — he's doing about 53.00
points," Hamada added. "They also
have two very good specialists in each
event, guys who can score 9.00 plus. But
after that, I don't know what kind of
depth they have, what level the third or
fourth man would be. Knowing that
they're scoring 263, that would mean
that they have pretty good depth. If
they're healthy, they'll be pretty tough
to beat."
In the Card line-ups, Hamada is rely
ing on Mike Lee and Brian Nelson as his
top two all-arounders, while the next
two spots will probably be filled by
Chris Smith and Jeff Chung. The addi
tion of Nelson should add some valu
able points to the Stanford team total.
Just as the women will be counting

tenths of points for individual and team
marks, the men will be trying to bring
up season averages to improve post
season chances. One of the nationals
hopefuls, Bob Daniel was hurt by a low
er-than-usual judging in his top event,
vaulting, at the USC meet last Friday.
"That was a tough break for Bob,"
Hamada said. "He's got three more
meets to compete in. What they're
(NCAA statisticians) going to do is
eliminate the top and bottom scores
and average all the middle scores to de
termine the gymnasts who go to na
tionals.
"What I told Bob is that he's got to go
all out in every meet," he added. "He's
got to run as fast as he can and push off
(the horse) to get a lot of height and dis
tance. Then he's got to hit the dismount
(landing). He's got a chance for a 9.50,
9.60."
