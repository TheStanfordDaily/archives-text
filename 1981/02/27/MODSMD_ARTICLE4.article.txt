### Richard Klingler 
The ASSU Senate's Wednesday
night meeting tested the unity of the
Council ot Presidents (COP), de
termined areas in which the ASSU will
expend its energies, and tentatively
established the nature of the senate's
response to international political is
sues.
The concert production issue pro
vided occasion for the first major
division within the four-member COP.
according to COP member Davna
Goldfine The issue pitted Goldfine. a
supporter of student concert produc
tions. against her COP colleagues
Marc Venlresca, Nancy Takahashi,
and Dick Butterfield.

\ews analysis

Goldtine supported the rejected
concert feasibility task force report
and the principle of student-produced
concerts After Wednesday night's
meeting, during which both issues
were iinally defeated, Goldfine said
the meeting was "what I expected,
and I hope that sometime in the near
future students will be producing con
certs."
Referring to the COP division over
concert promotion. Goldtine said she
thinks other issues will not be affected
and remarked. "I would hope that we
as a Ki'oup are mature enough ... to
work on the issues together ''
Butteriield. an opponent of ASSU
concert promotion, agreed there had
been a COP split over the concert is
sue and that the disagreement does
not extend beyond the concert produc
tion issue.
"The COP is tar more important
than any single issue," he said But
terfieid said concerts are not an ASSU
priority.
Many senators agreed the concert
issue had engulfed too much senate
energy that could have been more
profitably spent in other areas. At the
Wednesday night meeting, Finance
Committee Chair Gary Reilf said,
"We can continue to try to find a solu
tion, but it's a waste right now."
Butterfield later said he hoped sen
ate and COP el torts will be directed
toward other issues such as the selec
tion of new project managers, writing
the first ASSU annual report, prepara
tion for the evaluation of the ASSU by
an outside committee, and initiation
and consideration of extended
projects.
In addition to defining organiza

tional and student service efforts, the
senate increased its role of responding
to foreign events by forming a com
mittee on issues concerning El
Salvador
Although several senators said the
senate should not address any interna
tional issues on behalf of students, the
committee will explore possibilities
for senate action concerning the El
Salvadoran civil war. in addition to in
forming the Stanford community
about the crisis.
Some senators questioned the com
mittee's focus on El Salvador and sug
gested that other issues such as the
South African and Kampuchean con
troversies be included in any senate
action. Senator Eve Rodler brought
the civil war in El Salvador to the at
tention of the senate, maintaining the
conflict's magnitude is great and stu
dents are particularly concerned
about events in that nation.
Rodler highlighted the attacks on El
Salvadoran universities and cited an
ASSU Student Affairs Committee poll.

The poll's results suggest students
need information and hold con
siderable reservations about U.S. for
eign policy.
In a 100-student telephone poll ap
proved by Sally Cole, director ot re
search tor the dean of student affairs,
the committee found 30 percent ot the
students polled were moderately op
posed to a U.S. policy of giving mili
tary aid to El Salvador wnile 36 per
cent were strongly opposed to this pol
icy Of the graduates and under
graduates contacted. 6 percent mildly
agreed with continuing U.S. military
aid. none strongly supported the poli
cy. and 28 percent said they had no
basis tor judgment.
Rodler justified the need for a com
mittee to inform students by citing the
committee's findings that 8 percent of
those students polled considered
themselves very well informed about
I S foreign policy toward the conflict
in El Salvador, while 57 percent said
they were somewhat informed, and 35
percent said they were not informed.
