Just as the sun eventually
came through the ever-present
clouds hanging over the Varsity
tennis courts yesterday, so did
the Stanford women, as they re
igned over and rained on visit
ing San Diego, 6-1. The match,
which was delayed twice by
short rainfalls, was finally
called because of darkness witn
two doubles matches left in
complete.
Despite the apparent ease of
victory, the Cards had a bit of a
rough time of it — both with the
weather and the stingy San Die
go team. "That team is a good,
strong team," remarked Stan
ford coach Frank Brennan after
the match. "I'm glad we got to
play them."
Stanford's only loss came at
number five singles, where Al
lison Hardey locked horns with
San Diego's Laura Ortega in
what was the most entertaining
match of the afternoon. Hardey
dropped the first set, 6-2, but
battled back and forced a
tiebreaker in the second. Being
down 2-0 in the tiebreak, Hardey
fought her way to a 7-4 win and a
tie in the match.
The third set appeared that it
might go into a tiebreaker also,
as it was 5-all, but Ortega took
the last two games to win the
match. "That girl was tough,"
Brennan said of Ortega. "Al

lison played her best tennis in
the third set, but so did she, un
fortunately."
The easiest time to be had by
any Cardinal was by Sue
Rasmussen, as she rolled over
Maryann Raftis, one and three
Rasmussen consistently hit
deep, powerful volleys to keep
R«ftis off balance throughout
the match It appeared that the
only thing that would stop her
would be the heavens them
selves, when the first rain delay
came with Rasmussen up, 5-2 in
the second. "My forehand was
going well today," she said.
"And when it goes well, I usual
ly do pretty good."
Although the match was not a
big one from a team standpoint,
there were a couple of individ
ual wins that loomed pretty
large for the two women who got
them. Freshmen Elise Burgin
and Michelle Weiss picked up
their first victories of their
Stanford careers.
"It feels pretty good," said
Burgin, the lefthander from
Baltimore. "It's really dif
ferent playing matches like
this. I've played millions of
matches in my life, but none
was quite like this one."
Weiss, who said she "fell
asleep in the second set," came
on strong in the third to claim a
6-1, 4-6, 6-0 win at number three
singles. "That's how I've been
wanting to play now for weeks.
That felt great out there,"
Weiss said in reference to her
overpowering play in the third
set.

this. I've played millions of
matches in my life, but none
was quite like this one."
Weiss, who said she "fell
asleep in the second set," came
on strong in the third to claim a
6-1, 4-6, 6-0 win at number three
singles. "That's how I've been
wanting to play now for weeks.
That felt great out there,"
Weiss said in reference to her
overpowering play in the third
set.

Just as the sun eventually
came through the ever-present
clouds hanging over the Varsity
tennis courts yesterday, so did
the Stanford women, as they re
igned over and rained on visit
ing San Diego, 6-1. The match,
which was delayed twice by
short rainfalls, was finally
called because of darkness witn
two doubles matches left in
complete.
Despite the apparent ease of
victory, the Cards had a bit of a
rough time of it — both with the
weather and the stingy San Die
go team. "That team is a good,
strong team," remarked Stan
ford coach Frank Brennan after
the match. "I'm glad we got to
play them."
Stanford's only loss came at
number five singles, where Al
lison Hardey locked horns with
San Diego's Laura Ortega in
what was the most entertaining
match of the afternoon. Hardey
dropped the first set, 6-2, but
battled back and forced a
tiebreaker in the second. Being
down 2-0 in the tiebreak, Hardey
fought her way to a 7-4 win and a
tie in the match.
The third set appeared that it
might go into a tiebreaker also,
as it was 5-all, but Ortega took
the last two games to win the
match. "That girl was tough,"
Brennan said of Ortega. "Al

lison played her best tennis in
the third set, but so did she, un
fortunately."
The easiest time to be had by
any Cardinal was by Sue
Rasmussen, as she rolled over
Maryann Raftis, one and three
Rasmussen consistently hit
deep, powerful volleys to keep
R«ftis off balance throughout
the match It appeared that the
only thing that would stop her
would be the heavens them
selves, when the first rain delay
came with Rasmussen up, 5-2 in
the second. "My forehand was
going well today," she said.
"And when it goes well, I usual
ly do pretty good."
Although the match was not a
big one from a team standpoint,
there were a couple of individ
ual wins that loomed pretty
large for the two women who got
them. Freshmen Elise Burgin
and Michelle Weiss picked up
their first victories of their
Stanford careers.
"It feels pretty good," said
Burgin, the lefthander from
Baltimore. "It's really dif
ferent playing matches like
this. I've played millions of
matches in my life, but none
was quite like this one."
Weiss, who said she "fell
asleep in the second set," came
on strong in the third to claim a
6-1, 4-6, 6-0 win at number three
singles. "That's how I've been
wanting to play now for weeks.
That felt great out there,"
Weiss said in reference to her
overpowering play in the third
set.
