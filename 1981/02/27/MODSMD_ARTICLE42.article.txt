Paychecks: Who Makes
What?

When I was in New York last
Christmas, I came across a lot
of advertisements for David
Harrop's new book, Paychecks:
Who Makes What?, "the book
that tells you what everybody
earns." Harper & Row ap
parently felt the New York of
fered a strong market for Pay
checks. Strangely, I haven't
seen any ads for it around here.
Could it be that New York, with
its phalanxes of young lawyers
and MBA's buying their first
suits at Brooks Brothers, has
more success-driven people
than Stanford? Impossible.
With over 50 percent of us ma
joring in engineering, econ.
(pre-bus.), poli sci (pre-law)
or bio. (pre-med), many if not
all Stanford students clearly de
sire to get ahead after they
graduate. Are all these pre-pro
fessionals on the right path? To
read Paychecks, the answer
would appear to be a resounding
yes.
Take medicine. It's com

monplace that pre-meds, if they
manage to get admitted to med
school, stand an excellent
chance of earning a good deal of
money. In 1978, Harrop informs
us, doctors earned a median in
come of $68,000, twice that of
lawyers and almost four times
that of other professionals like
educators or technical workers.
But this figure is deceiving be
cause 20 percent of all doctors
earned more than $100,000 after
expenses and, of these, half
made over $125,000, While it
may be crass to suggest that the
pre-meds in our midst are
motivated solelv by money,
they might as well know that not
all specialties pay the same. It's
far more remunerative, gener
ally speaking, to study germs
than brains. Psychiatrists,
"once the symbol of opulence in
popular song and story," are
among the lowest paid doctors,
with a median 1977 income of
$53,790, compared with the
$140,000 average income of hos
pital-based pathologists. Al
though almost all doctors never
have to worry about starving,
there is a caveat: increasingly
costly malpractice suits. One
patiently successfully sued her
doctor for $854,219.61 for the

"extreme suffering and dis
tress" she underwent following
the improper placement of her
belly button.
Careers in law and business
can also be remunerative. Part
ners in the top 50 or so national
law firms had a median salary
of almost $200,000 in 1978, a fig
ure which has undoubtedly risen
with inflation. One firm, the
New York based Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom, can
boast of at least six partners
who earned between $600,000
and $800,000 in 1979. One part
ner, Joseph H. Flom, received
more than $1.1 million for the
year. All lawyers, alas, do not
become Joseph H. Floms. The
salary for a legal aide lawyer in
New York state, for instance, is
between $16,500 and $35,000.
Chief executive officers of
America's largest corporations
make salaries that can make
one reel. David Mahoney's total
compensation in 1978 as Chair
man of Norton Simon was
$2,037,000 â€” that's almost
$40,000 a week, more than most
workers bring home in a year
(the average annual wage for
full-time employees in 1978 was
approximately $12,800). Mr.

Mahoney's salary, though
higher than most CEO's, is not
atypical. Even Fred L. Hartley,
of Union Oil, way down at
number 25 on the list of highest
paid executives, managed to
eke out $804,000 for the year.
Medicine, law and business
can all lead the way to riches.
But what if these fields bore
you? John McEnroe, a one-time
Stanford student, doesn't seem
to have suffered for dropping

out after his freshman year. In
his first full year as a pro
fessional tennis player, he
grossed $585,238, despite never
having taken Econ 51.
If you're spastic and can't tell
the difference between a tennis
ball and a hockey puck, there's
still the possibility that you can
inherit money. As Harrop
writes: "Not everyone in Amer
ica lives by the paycheck. Some

are born lucky and simply cash
their dividend checks, trust
payments and other forms of in
herited income." People like
the Mellons and duPonts have
been doing this tor years
without suffering any major
problems.
But what if your name is Don
Dork of Gary Creek and you
can't muster up any rich rela
tions? How does crime sound 0
Whoever said that it doesn't pay
hasn't read Paychecks. A 1
Capone is reputed to have
grossed $100 million in the Pro
hibition year of 1927, an incon
ceivable figure until today's
spectacle of OPEC-rich sheiks.
Are you inherently a nasty
SOB 9 Don't reform. Become a
hit man! The best professional
murderers can command
$75,000 per job. (The author ad
mits that, due to the nature of
the work, this figure is difficult
to verify.) Do you get a kick out
of Money and Banking but are
afraid banks will bore you to
tears? Give loansharking a try.

The action's swift, your col
leagues hardly dull, and the
pay's great. At interest rates of
20 percent a week, a loan shark
(especially a smart one from
Stanford > can bring in $175,000 a
year. And you don't even have to
wear a pinstripe suit.
Paychecks is a highly read
able, information-packed book.
In our economically shakey
times, the pursuit of a high
paying job acquires greater va
lidity; learning about the
salaries one can earn might pro
vide the impetus to stay in that
obnoxious econ course or chem
lab. If you're not convinced and
decide to major in "fuzzy stud
ies," at least take some prac
tical electives. For starters:
F.con 20(H): Supply and De
mand Curves for the
Lnanshark. Or Hum Bio 9999:
How the Human Body Works,
or. the Best Winv to Kill One It
might be the smartest thing
you'll ever do. As Caiphas says
to Judas in -Jesus Christ Super
star: "Think of the things you
can do with that money."
