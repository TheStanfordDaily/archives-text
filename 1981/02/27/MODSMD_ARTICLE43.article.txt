The Stories of Ray Bradbury
Alfred A. Knopf
$17.95

Ray Bradbury, with his childish grin and his
thin Jimmy Stewart voice, is the last person
on earth you would expect to be a science fic
tion writer. It's not very difficult to picture
someone like Bradbury living next door: a de
voted father and family man with a slightly
eccentric penchant for stuffed animals and
antique toys. He's the kind of man who at
tracts kids like a magnet, and who would be
only too happy to let you play with his favorite
toys.
But Ray Bradbury is also author of some 500
short stories, novels, plays, and poems, nu
merous episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents
and The Twilight Zone, as well as the
screenplay for the movie version of Moby
Dick. His Fahrenheit 451, filmed by Francois
Truffaut, is a science fiction classic; and his
short story collections, including The Il
lustrated Man, R is for Racket, and The Mar
tian Chronicles, are perennial best sellers. Of
the "big four" in science fiction (the others
are Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, and
Arthur C. Clarke), Bradbury is probably the

most literate, and the one who has found it
easiest to cross the line between science fic
tion and mainstream literature. Unlike his
peers, who were all trained as scientists,
Bradbury instills in his works a childlike
fascination with technology; his rockets are
glistening toys, and his characters are simply
men and women caught up in a world they
don't really understand:
It iras a new ship; it had fire in its body and
men in its metal cells, and it moved with a
clean silence, fiery and warm. The men
irithin it had been battered, thrown about,
sickened, made well again, each in his
turn. One man had died, but now the re
maining sixteen, with their eyes clear in
their heads and their faces pressed to the
thick glass ports, watched Mars swing up
under them.
Bradbury's reputation has always rested on
his short stories, and the editors at Alfred
Knopf, sensing a market for a handsome hard
cover collection of Bradbury's stories, recent
ly published a hundred of the author's favor
ites in The Stories of Ray Bradbury. Brad
bury's stories are like a fine souffle — he mix
es in characters and dialogue with the delicate
touch of a master chef, and then sits back to
see what develops. Arranged in chronological

order, the stories span his 35-year career, and
touch upon such diverse subjects as com
mercial time travel, a parrot who speaks with
Hemingway's voice, and Martians who refuse
to convert to Christianity. Less than half of
the stories could be called science fiction, but
all deal with some element of the super
natural, the macabre, or the unknown. As
Bradbury notes in the introduction, his work is
"exactly one-half terror and one-half ex
hilaration."
Bradbury scoffs at the traditional notion of
a writer agonizing over every word he writes,
but is the first to admit that he is possessed by
his ideas:
But, you see, my stories have led me
through my life. They shout, I follow. They
run up and bite me on the leg — I respond
by writing down everything that goes on
during the bite. When I finish, the idea lets
go, and runs off.
In much the same manner, Charles Dickens
used to say that his fiction was mere dictation
— his characters would appear to him unbid
den, and hold long discussions with Dickens
and with each other. Bradbury, whose public
persona is every bit as genial and good-nature
dly eccentric as Dickens' was, has the same
unbridled imagination, both fascinating and

terrifying in its dark intensity. The characters
that appear to Bradbury are not human — they
are vampires, Martians, tyrannosaurs,
werewolves and Illustrated Men.
Bradbury has a special talent for making
the ordinary seem extraordinary, and the
mysterious seem quite mundane. In one of his
earliest stories, "The Night," he invests a
ravine in a small Midwestern town with dark,
supernatural malevolence; and in another
early story, "The Crowd," he describes the
spectators that gather at the scene of an acci
dent as a mob of ghoulish parasites that is able
to move around with preternatural speed.
Conversely, in "The Family," he affec
tionately describes a typical household in
Green Town, Illinois — one that happens to
consist of a vampire, a witch, a telepath, and
Uncle Enoch, who has six-foot green leathery
wings. And in "Mars is Heaven," one of the
stories later incorporated into The Martian
Chronicles, the first glimpse of Mars by an ex
pedition from earth is of a perfectly ordinary
Midwestern town, and a piano playing "Beau
tiful Dreamer."
No Bradbury anthology would be complete
without those horrible little stories that
scared us so much when we first read them in
grade school: "The Veldt," about a mecha

nized playroom where children's fantasies
come true, even the nasty onei:
"Marionettes. Inc.," in which lifelike human
puppets turn the tables on their masters; "A
Sound of Thunder," about a hapless time trav
eller who gets a little too nervous when he
goes tyrannosaur hunting, and, perhaps most
terrifying of all, "Small Assassin," about a
baby who is born fully aware and with a
murderous hatred of his mother for bringing
him into this world. The closing lines of
"Small Assassin" still give me a chill:
Something rustled doten the hall. Some
thing eery small and very quiet.
He took a half a dozen sloiv, sure steps
forward into the hall. He raised his hand
into the sunlight.
"See hahy! Something bright — some
thing pretty!"
scalpel.
Bradbury's style shows a consummate ar
tistry, a strange and gripping blend of Edgar
Allen Poe. Sherwood Anderson, and Kurt Von
negut. This edition of his collected stories is
recognition — at long last — of his remarkable
talent, and the appearance of almost all of his
important short stories in a single volume of
fers a unique and valuable perspective on one
of the best writers of short fiction we have.
