This book is great. I've had a
copy of The Next Whole Earth
Catalog for four months now,
have read in it hundreds of
hours, and it still hasn't worn
out its original appeal.
What could be so interesting?
Take a look at this book some
time (better yet. buy it) and see
for yourself: it contains 608
pages (big ones — 11 by 14 in

ches) jam-packed with reviews
of some of the best books, maga
zines. tools, and ideas of our
day.
The subjects and topics cov
ered by the Next Catalog vary
widely. Many people, when they
hear "Whole Earth," expect the
catalog to be about goats, gran
ola, and communes. True, the
original Whole Earth Catalog
(published 13 years ago) was
made by and for hippies, but the
Next Catalog smells little, if
any, of aging hippies. As Stew
art Brand, the editor of the Next
Catalo,;g, says in the book's pref

ace, "Back-to-Basics certainly
is a major point we make, but so
is Onward-and-Upward (space,
computers, electronic music),
and Outward-in-All Directions-
So Long-As-It-Doesn't Hurt-
Anybody-Probably."
The result is that goats, cheap
and wholesome food, and com
munes still get coverage, but so
do state-of-the-art technology
and the latest advances in sci
ence.
Hundreds of topics are cov
ered, ranging from bees to ver
nacular architecture, new-wave
magazines to outdoor gear,
medical self-care to suicide,
and cybernetics to sewing.
The multiplicity and com
plexity of the Catalog make it a
sort of Rohrshach test: There is
something in here for ev
erybody. I gave away four
copies of the Next Catalog at
Christmas. One friend, in
terested in the evolution of
ideas, discovered Gregory
Bateson in the Catalog. Another
friend, a book lover, termed the
catalog "great—a real li
brary!" My father, the proud
owner of a Stihl 045 chainsaw,
and handy at tree felling, was
surprised to be informed by the
catalog that "contrary to public
belief, the Stihl 045 is not the
best chainsaw going... the Hus
qvarna 480 is." My sister and
her husband, homesteading in
lowa along with their 7-month
old baby, were interested most
in the sections on gardening and
child-care.
All in all, these views cor
respond pretty closely to the
stated purpose of the catalog:
the promoting of tools that help
individuals develop the power
"to conduct their own educa
tion, find their own inspiration,
shape their own environment,
and share the adventures with
whoever is interested."
Reviews of such concrete and

abstract tools, and information
on access to them comprise the
bulk of the Catalog. All reviews
contain an evaluation of the
tool. Evaluations tell what the
item is good for and how it com
pares with others. The item is
also pictured. If it is a catalog or
book or magazine, represent
ative excerpts and/or illustra
tions from it are displayed.
Most evaluations are done by
Stewart Brand. The majority of
the rest of the reviews is done
either by members of the
Catalog staff, or by specialists
(generally from the Bay Area,
since the Catalog is produced in
Sausalito). The rest of the eval
uations are scattered among re
viewers too diverse to classify.
Ken Kesey, for instance, in
troduces Martin Buber's / and
Thou. One of the best (and long
est) evaluations is done by Ju
dith Van Slooten (who worked
for years for Gregory Bateson)
on the book From Sad to Glad.
Almost all of the evaluations
are done by people somehow as
sociated with the Next Catalog
or its staff, or with the CoEuolu
tion Quarterly magazine (a sort
of on-going Catalog that's heav
ier on articles and fiction, and is
smaller). All readers of the

Catalog are invited to improve
upon the Catalog's evaluations
and recommendations, "so that
the next Next Catalog may be
more comprehensively ac
curate in pointing out ex
cellence." Even complaint let
ters are paid for when printed.
This policy on contribution is
typical of the Catalog's in
formality. All of the evaluations
are signed, and most evaluators
feel free (in fact, most make it a
point) to refer to personal ex
periences or tastes in their
criticism. All reviewers, of
course, rely upon personal ex
periences and prejudices, but
the reviewers in the Next
Catalog at least attempt to tell
you outright what some of these
are. This attitude is just part of
the Catalog's self-described
"arch-mission to make all proc
esses transparent."
Equally as informative and
entertaining as the review,, if
not more so, are the occasional
articles, interviews, factual
stories, fiction, and aphorisms.
Notable among these are "The
Four Illusions of Money," (arti
cle), "There ain't no graceful
way: Defecation and urination
at ZeroG" (an interview), "The
Third Wave" (a factual story
which took place in Palo Alto),

"Snake," and "14 True Words
on Health and Malpractice In
surance."
There's even a gossip column
— on every other page, Catalog
production editor Anne Herbert
presents excerpts from her
"Rising Sun Neighborhood
Newsletter" (published in
Sausalito). For the most part,
the "Neighborhood" is wonder
ful, interesting, and always
lively. Just a few times, though,
Herbert is overbearing, or over
ly cute,or fussy.
Some people, when first in
troduced to the Catalog, are ir
ritated by its style. They feel it
is too chatty, or familiar, or con
descending. I am used to this
personalized style, because of
my previous exposure to
CoEvolu tion Quarterly.
When I first started reading CQ,

I especially remember being ir
ritated by the glaring presence
of Stewart Brand's ego. This is a
common complaint. But, as the
people at the Catalog certainly
know, it is this personalized ap
proach that makes their product
unique and gives it its winning
qualities. As the personality be
hind the writing emerged, Ire

alized I liked their informal ap
proach to reviewing and writ
ing.

It was a strange feeling when
I met the Catalog research edi
tor Art Kleiner recently. Be
cause of his writing, and be
cause of all the references to
him in Catalog and CoEvolution
Quarterly gossip, including pic
tures, I recognized him im
mediately and felt as if I al
ready knew him. The Catalog
staff has done such a good job in
making the Catalog a non-mys
tery that I feel I know as much
about it as they do. I came to
this realization after calling
Kleiner to ask him some ques
tions about the Catalog. The an
swers he gave were boring.
Having read as much as I had, I
felt I could have done as good a

job of answering as he did.
In short, The Next Whole
Earth Catalog is such a new,
unique, and varied experience
that I recommend it to all
readers interested in adventure
and discovery — of the universe,
of the world, and of themselves.
I promise you will find some
thing new and worthwhile.
