Notorious ****
Wednesday, Tresidder Large
Lounge
Notorious, directed by Alfred
Hitchcock, is a spy story done with
the wit and grace ot high comedy;
it is among the most beautifully
crafted films of the genre. This is a
film composed of gleaming sur
faces. keys, winebottles, and
teacups take on a glowing sheen of
intrigue Cary Grant plays an
American agent who must dis
cover the secrets of Claude Rains.
The device he uses is Ingrid
Bergman. The film's irony is that
Rains engages our sympathies
more than Grant does — Rains is
the member of the triangle who
knows the least and whose love is
most sincere.
Ted Tetzlaff did the stunning
black-and-white photography;
Ben Hecht wrote the script.
Plays with another Hitchcock
classic:The Birds.

I'icnic at Hanging Hock
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who mysteriously dis
appear during a fieid trip. Theda& ■
is Valentine's Day, 1900, anPI
change is in the air: the girls are
nearing adulthood, and the Vic
torian era is about to be replaced
by the much-less genteel world of
the 20th Century. Weir supplies no
solution to his riddle — the mecha
nisms of this rite of passage ob
scure the subject from view.
Story, photography, and music
combine to create a film which al
ternates between daydream and
nightmare.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with The (letting of Wisdom.

Fort Apache, the Bronx **
Old Mill, Mountain View
There are some interesting per
formers here (Paul Newman, Kew
Wahl, Tito Goya, Miguel Pinero),
and some of the sequences have an
unusual texture, but this film,
which promises to be an ironic ur
ban western comedy with cops as
the cowboys, is disappointing. The
director, Daniel Petrie, and the
screenwriter, Heywood Gould,
pick up and discard ideas so often
and so arbitrarily that you begin to
feel that the daily shooting sched
ule must have arisen out of what
Gould happened to read in the pa
pers the night before. Everything
is given equal weight — and ev
erything is swept away.

The 400 liloivs ★ ★★★
Monday, Kresge
This was Francoise Truffaut's
first film; it is still among his two
or three greatest. He drew from
his own life to create this portrait
of an angiy, intelligent boy who
doesn't fit in. The film is amazing
ly gentle; we empathize with the
boy's flight, but we also see how
locked-in, and helpless, his pa
rents are. The final freeze-frame,
which has since become a cliche in
lesser films, beautifully
crystallizes this heart-felt am
bivalence. Henri Decae did the
cinematography.

Altered States * •
Palo Alto Square
Altered States is the world's
first 70-millimeter, six-track ster
eo Looney Tune. It's brightly col
ored, wonderfully noisy, and utter
ly vacuous.
Ken Russell (Women in Love,
'Tommy) directed; Paddy
Chayefsky (Network) wrote the
story and screenplay. This tale of a
man who turns into an ape
(honest) and does other colorful
things after he takes a rare drug
reflects the worst aspects of both
ot its creators: from Russell it re
ceives pointless visual flam
boyance; from Chayefsky it gains
pointless philosophical dis
cussions ("What is man? When do
we eat?"). Its visuals, however,
are very pretty — the movie prac
tically begs you to stop thinking
long enough to enjoy them — and
the soundtrack ("Megasound") is
loud and creepy. It's amazing what
wonderful things one can do with
no ideas at all.
- J.M.
The Elephant Man ★***
Palo Alto Square
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick,
"The Elephant Man.* Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his illness. Not a horror story, but
a moving tale of human love and
compassion battling
unknown.
— Tom TafflH
Star Trek **
Sunday, Mem Aud
Empty, apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of
greed—Paramount Pictures. De
spite the seeming grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where
one of the Enterprise's crew mem
bers saves the universe by gleeful
ly agreeing to some cosmic sex—is
unintentionally hilarious. Shatner,
Nimoy and the rest were better on
TV; on the large screen they're
almost unbelievably wooden.
— Ron Lillejord
Bye Bye Hrazil ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This Brazilian import, directed
by Carlos Diegues, is a funny, oc
casionally raunchy comedy about
trying to survive in a country
that's "progressing" so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind in a
mire of poverty and lost dreams.
The movie begins when a
carnival, crammed onto a beat-up
flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town in the Brazilian backlands.
The troupe can offer nothing to
anyone: they're neither cyncial
enough to compete with the new
entertainment, TV, nor sincere
enough to bring the miracles that
the TV-less peasants expect from
them. The only thing left to the
troupe, it seems, is prostitution,
and that is what they must turn to
to survive. Director Diegues does
a fine job of highlighting this clash
between dreams and economics.
— Plays tomorrow through
Mondav.

9 to 5 *
Old Mill, Mountain View
One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about the revenge three abused
secretaries take on their
chauvinistic boss are quickly
smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy
with a fake feminist gloss and a
Frank Capracorn ending Lily
Dolly Parton and Dabney
Coleman salvage as much as they
can, but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance: trying to
play a woman of average in
telligence and to be light and funny
at the same time, she telegraphs
appallingly and gives us scenes of
classic female incompetence,
which surely canoot b« what||he
intended.

The Birds ****
Wednesday, Tresidder Large
Alfred uiv
phimaged' 3 verskm of*the
apocalypse, someone in the Uni
versal advertising department
corrected him: "Excuse me, but
don't you mean 'The birds are
coming?" The characters in The,
Birdh are a little like that anony
mous publicity executive—they're
too busy playing with syntax to
ever grasp the semantics. Tippi
Hedren and Rod Taylor, first an
tagonists and then lovers, play
characters who pathetically try to
maintain normalcy in the face of
unfathomable disaster. They nev
er know—and Hitchcock doesn t
tell us—why thfblrds attack. They
respond not with bravery but with
pitiful remnants of good manners
Especially noteworthy is the
film's soundtrack, which uses, in
stead of music, electronically sim
ulated bird noises.

Coal Miner's Daughter
Guild, Menlo Park
A pretty terrific movie, made
that way by some great per
formances and by director
Michael Apted's eye for telling de
tail. Country star Loretta Lynn's
rags-to-riches story is brought to
the screen with warmth and fine
humor. Even when, two-thirds of
the way through, the inevitable
heartbreak comes, the movie
glides through showbiz cliche and
comes out with its good nature in-,
tact.
Sissy Spacek portrays the
singer as if she and Lynn had been
best friends: her performance
suggests shared secrets and late
night soul searching. Tommy Lee
Jones and Beverly D'Angelo (as
Patsy Cline) turn in superb sup
porting performances.

Mon Oncle d'Arnerique #***■
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Mon Oncle d'Amerique is the
latest in a series of exceptional
film essays by director Alain
Resnais (Last Year at Marienbad.
and Fofl) This examination
of human destiny and choice fol
lows the lives of three characters
— a wealthy executive, a devoutly
Catholic superviser in a textile
plant, and an actress who was
raised a Communist — as they
almost accidentally intersect.
Their story is intercut with an in
terview with real-life psychologist
Henri Laborit, changing the film
into something that is not-quite
fiction and not-quite fact. The ten
sion between documentary and
narrative gives Mon Oncle
d'Amerique its resonance; the dis
tance between where the charac
ters are and where they would like
to be gives the film its dry, some
times-bitter humor.

Kagemusha
Aquarius, Palo Alto
At 70, Akira Kurosawa directs
what may be his summit achieve
ment: a samurai epic that sug
gests a fusion of Shakespeare and
Pirandello. A thief is hired as the
'shadow' of a samurai chieftain —
to stand in for him when he is in
jured in battle — and when the
grader dies, the thief must take
over. There's a post—battle se
quence that is reminiscent of the
'Guernica.' A masterpiece.

Cinema 21, San Francisco
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less as it
does in the book, but the soul of the
work is gone.
Tesss centerpiece is Nastassia
Kinski. She is lovely. Looking at
her, one can almost believe that
she could, without in the least in
tending to, drive men to do terrible
deeds. But. and this is a big but,
she has an accent. It is difficult to
concentrate her character's plight
when it sounds as if she spent sum
mers on the banks of the Rhine.
The ultimate responsibility, ot
course, rests with director Roman
Polanski. Unable to render any
real, cinematic interpretation ot
the novel, he contented himself
with dramatizing its "big mo
ments." What he forgot to do, or
what he was afraid to try, was to
offer any reason for seeing the
movie rather than staying home
and rereading the book.

Dona Flor, a widow who mar

citing druggist, manages to get the
best of two worlds when her rakish
first husband returns from the
dead to put romance back into her

Bijou, Palo Alto
The Incredible Shrinking
Woman, which stars Lily Tomlin
as (surprise!) a woman who
shrinks, goes wrong in more ways
than most movies have ways: it is
a small miracle of ineptitude.
A feeling of great things being
missed pervades the movie. Even
the special effects seem tired —
the business of shrinking is treated
more like a chore to be completed
than a possibility for exercising
the imagination. The movie ends
up being a little depressing: it
laughs so loudly at its own, tiny
punchline that it's hard not to feel
that someone along the line forgot
to tell the joke.

Citizen Kane *****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Kw s reputation as being the
greatest movie ever made
shouldn't scare you away from
seeing it. There are few master
pieces to which the term "fun"'
can be applied, but this is one. Or
son Welles, who directed, starred,
and Co wrote, called movies the
greatest toy train set a boy ever
had; his movie is infused with a
sense of pure joy in discovering the
capabllities of the medium.

The Magnificent Ambersons
***★• •*.
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Based on the novel by Booth
Tarkington. Those who think
Agnes Moorehead was a TV-star
should see her in this; her
portrayal of the aging, repressed
spinster Aunt Fanny is among the
most powerful captured in any
film. This was Orson Welles' sec
ond movie, and, if anything, his
technique is even more advanced
than in Citizen Kane Andre Bazin
called this Welles' classic style to
complement the baroqueness of
Kane.
There is, however, a tragedy as
sociated with the "completion" of
this film. An out-of-favor Welles
could do nothing when the studio
cut it by more than a third and
tacked-on an unbelievable happy
ending What remains is superb,
but one can help wonder about the
