the 23-ton capacity trailer just behind the cab of the truck
which was on its way to deliver a load of gravel near San
Francisco's China Basin about 7 a m
"I was making a left-hand turn . and was about half
way into the intersection when I saw the bus coming like a
train and it plowed into me." said Jeff Hayes, the truck
driver.
John McGee, 41, the bus driver, was reported in serious
condition with a fractured leg
Municipal Railway investigators were trying to de
termine what caused the crash at a rain-slicked intersec

It took firefighters two hours to extricate all of the vic
tims from the crumpled bus. Some passengers said they
smashed through windows to escape
"They were trapped and wedged in Limbs were caught
under the seats," said Fire Department Battalion Chief
Gerald Cullen.

Reagan and Thatcher discuss summit
Washington — President Ronald Reagan said yesterday
he and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher agree
that a Soviet proposal for a U.S.-Soviet summit conference
"needs to be carefully studied "
"For our part, we certainly have an interest in pursuing
a serious, constructive dialogue with the Soviets on the is
sues which divide us." Reagan said after a two-hour meet
ing with Thatcher.
Reagan's remarks were his most positive response vet
to the proposal for a summit made Monday by Soviet Pres
ident Leonid Brezhnev. The next day. Reagan called the
proposal "very interesting" but said Soviet involvement in
El Salvador would need to be "straightened out" before he
would agree to a summit.
Indeed. Reagan sounded a cautionary note in welcoming
Thatcher to the White House, saying:
"Our challenge today is to ensure that belligerence is
not attempted again by the false perceptions of weakness.
"So long as our adversaries continue to arm themselves
at a pace far beyond the needs of defense, so the free world
must do whatever is necessary to safeguard its own secur
ity."
He said "a stronger, more vigilant NATO must be the
background of that security and of our effort for equitable
arms control."
Reagan said in a joint appearance with Thatcher after
their meeting, saving the two leaders had "affirmed our
support" for NATO's 1979 decision to deploy medium
range nuclear missiles, and to "pursue arms control ef
forts at the same time, in parallel. "
Several of the United States' European allies have
privately voiced concern that Reagan might be backing
away from the commitment to pursue arms control talks,
while pushing ahead simultaneously with deployment of
the weapons.
Spain communique forthcoming
Madrid — Spain's four major political parties, ranging
from the Communists to the conservative Popular Al
liance, have prepared a joint communique to be issued to
day calling for the uncovering of "those who carried out.

assisted or inspired" the unsuccessful military coup this
week.
But in response to a statement made privately to them
Tuesday by King Juan Carlos, the communique also will
pay tribute to the armed forces as a whole.
As Spain's government worked to put itself back togeth
er yesterday, it became more clear that Juan Carlos has
emerged from the attempted coup in a stronger position,
also reinforced as a proponent of democracy.
There has been a positive response to the king's appeal
to treat the armed forces gently. At the same time, after
the new premier, Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, was sworn in yes
terday.it was announced that the deputy Army chief of
staff dismissed earlier this week for his role 'in the at
tempted coup has been placed under house arrest. Calvo-
Sotelo also announced his Cabinet yesterday.
On the major newsstands of the Spanish capital, two
books are sold side by side whose titles sum up the con
tradictions and ambiguities of post-Franco Spain that led
to this week's unsuccessful coup attempt: Viva Franco
< With Apologies) and a biography of Juan Carlos entitled
Every Inch a King.
The democratic rule that started to emerge in 1976 after
the 40-vear dictatorship of Generalissimo Francisco Fran
co sought no changes in the personnel that made up basic
institutions of the fascist corporate state — the armed
forces, the police, the judiciary, the church, the invest
ment banks and big industry.
Praising the "discipline, patriotism and loyaltv to the
crown'' of the armed forces, Juan Carlos cautioned the po
litical chiefs that the • delicate" situation created by the
failed coup must be treated "with maximum serenity and
moderation."
Reagan chooses ambassador
Washington — President Ronald Reagan has settled on a
personal friend and fellow actor, John Gavin, as his choice
for U.S. ambassador to Mexico, according to the Dallas
Times Herald.
Gavin, a handsome 48-year-old Hollywood veteran, has
had a lifelong interest in Latin American affairs and from
1961 to 1965 he served as an adviser to the Organization of
American States in Washington.
But his expected nomination, which is being held up
pending announcement of other top-level State Depart
ment appointments, could add a new and unpredictable
element to already delicate relations between the United
States and its southern neighbor. The sensitivity of those
relations has been heightened in recent weeks by growing
unrest in Central America and by the Mexican govern
ment's renewed overtures toward Cuba.
"The fact that Gavin is a friend of Reagan's will help
him," said one former diplomat with intimate knowledge
of U.S.-Mexican affairs. "But it is really difficult to say
exactly how they (the Mexican government) will react."
A 1952 graduate of Stanford University with a major in
Latin American economic history, Gavin served in the
Navy and Naval Reserve, retiring with the rank of lieuten
ant colonel. His tour of active duty included service in the
Panama Canal Zone as a member of a task force studying
alternate routes for a future canal.
Doctors grow human skin
Cambridge, Mass. — For the first time, doctors have
grown a living replica of human skin in a test tube that they
believe will permanently cover the wounds of burn vic
tims.
The first experimental human transplant of the materi
al. called "skin-equivalent tissue," was conducted Tues
day at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where it
was developed. A report on earlier animal experiments
with the test tube skin was published in Friday's issue of
the journal .Science.
Unlike artificial skin, which must eventually be re-

placed with real skin from the victim's own body, doctors
say this material will cover the wound permanently and
never have to be removed.
The unique material is grown in a test tube from a tiny
sample of the eventual recipient's own skin, so it will not
be attacked and rejected bv the patient's body
This is the first time that a full-thickness, living skin
has been made in the laboratory and transplanted,"
Eugene Bell, who directed the development, said in an in
terview Bell, an MIT biologist, conducted the work with
doctors from the Shriners Burns Institute in Boston
Bell said that if the current experiment on a healthy vol
unteer is successful, tests of the new skin will begin soon
on patients at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston.
"I think the human prospects are good." Bell said.
It eventually may be possible to grow many other organs
in the test tube, he said.
Currently it takes about one month to grow one square
foot of skin. Bell said. A smaller patch takes about two
weeks.
He said many burn victims may be able to survive with
artificial skin coverings until the "new permanent skin can
be grown in the test tube and implanted on their wounds.
Unlike natural skin, however, the test tube variety lacks
hair or sweat glands.
Reagan to sell Saudis F-15's
Washington — The Reagan administration yesterday
began the delicate task of moving ahead with its planned
sale of sophisticated additional equipment for Saudi Ara
bia's F-15 jet fighters, while reassuring Congress it will
take steps to ensure that Israel's security is not threatened
by the increased Saudi air power.
' Although the State Department continued to insist that
"no decisions have been made" about the Saudi requests,
it now is certain that the administration intends to meet
that vital oil-producing state's demand for extra-large fuel
tanks and bomb racks that will increase the range and fire
power of the 62 F-15s it has ordered from the United States.
At closed meetings yesterday with the Senate and House
Foreign Relations committees, the new undersecretary of
state for security assistance, James Buckley, laid out the
administration's proposals.
Specifically, the administration, in proposals discussed
here earlier this week with Israeli Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, intends to allow Israel to purchase 15
F-15s in addition to the 40 the United States already is com
mitted to sell to the Jewish state.
In addition, the administration is expected to offer Is
rael some help with repayment of loans to ease the pres
sures on the straitened Israeli economy. The United States
also is expected to remove restrictions on using American
made components in Kfir jets that are sold to Third World
r

countries and to give Israel what has been called "en
hanced early-warning capability" to guard against the
possibility that the Saudi jets might be used against it.
It was not immediately clear what this "enhanced"
capability will involve. Even if the United States were
willing to grant them, Israel cannot afford to pav for the
ultra-sophisticated Airborne Warning And Control System
(AWACSi planes, and it is more likely that the United
States will offer more modest help such as increased
ground radar or a greater sharing of U.S. intelligence in
formation.
