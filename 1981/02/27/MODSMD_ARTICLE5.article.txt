(First of two parts i
Secretary ot Interior James Watt's
decision to reopen four ocean basins
off central and northern California
for possible oil development provoked
a vigorous and sharply critical local
reaction
"I think it's a mistake." said As
semblyman Byron Sher iD-Palo
Alto), a former Stanford law pro
fessor "It reverses a decision where a
lot of the weighing of pros and cons
had already been done. "
At a press conference today in Palo
Alto. Sher and Assemblvman Sam
Farr (D-Monterey) kick off a petition
drive against the drilling proposal.
which will run through \pril \ and is
"aimed at showing Watt that ev< ryone
is upset." said Sher.
Sher and Farr also introduced a
joint resolution in the State Assembly
urging Watt to abide by the decision of
his predecessor, former Secretary of
Interior Cecil Andrus. He deleted the
four basins after considering several
years of extensive testimony on the
environmental, economic and social
ramifications ol otfshore drilling in
California.
Representative Tom Lantos of Cali
fornia's eleventh congressional dis
trict, a leader in the previous battle
against leasing the basins, termed
Watt's reversal "an act of ultimate
hypocrisy." Lantos was one of 11 Cali
fornia congressmen to sign a strongly
worded telegram to Watt asking him
to reconsider
The overturning of the earlier de
cision "flies in the face ot clearly
articulated local wishes," and is par
ticularly inappropriate in an adminis
tration pledged to support the opinions
of local and state governments in mat
ters of federal public policy, said Lan
tos.

Lantos said he will "spare no ef
fort" to convince Watt to change his
mind. As a member of the Energy, En
vironment and Natural Resources
subcommittee of the Committee on
Government Operations, he will hold a
field hearing for public comments on
this issue April 4.
James Watt's press secretary,
Andy Baldwin, told the Daily that
while no final decision on leasing the
four basins has been made, "thesecre
tarv wants to be sure in his own mind
that we have taken the necessary
steps to increase the domestic produc
tion ot oil and gas. obviously within the
bounds of necessary and proper en
vironmental protection."
But Micheie PerrauVt, a represent
ative of the Sierra Club and chairman
of the coalition of environmental, fish
ing and coastal groups opposing the
drilling, termed this "bureaucratic
language" and added. "You realize
we're talking about at best an 11-day
supply ot petroleum."
"Of course, we're outraged. We feel
that Watt has gone and stabbed the
public in the back," she said.
Perrault also expressed doubts
about the fairness of tne re-evaluation
process that must now take place.
"Since he's taken this step, and in
view of his calloused remarks on the
environment in general, we are leary
ot what will happen. We do not feel we
can trust any aspect of the govern
ment on this issue."
State and local officials, hoping to
head off the sale, said Wednesday they
will invite Watt to tour proposed oil
lease areas, according to the As
sociated Press
If the visit doesn't persuade Watt to
drop plans to sell oil and gas explora
tion leases off the coast, the officials
said they would file suit to stop the
sales
