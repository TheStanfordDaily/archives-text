# Reagan draft policy undecided

### Nancy Koehn 
In deciding whether to allocate fed
eral funds for draft registration. Pres
ident Ronald Reagan is surrounded by
"a mix of adviser opinions." and
"there is no way of knowing what he
will do on this issue." Senior Hoover
Fellow Thomas Moore told a 40-person
meeting of People Against the Draft
Tuesday night.
"Certain people around Reagan, in
cluding (domestic policy adviser)
Martin Anderson and (Secretary of
Defense) Caspar Weinberger would be

in favor of cutting funds for regis
tration Richard Allen, national secur
ity adviser, favors registration. The
question is, How committed is Rea
gan 0 ' " said Moore. Reagan transi
tion team member.
Moore, who opposes the draft be
cause "it is unjust and a form of
slavery," said many influential gener
als see the draft "as a way of getting
cheap cannon fodder" and thus allow
ing them "to spend more money on
military hardware. Generals also sup
port the draft because they like to be in
command and order people around
"These men will put as much pres
sure as possible" on Reagan to sup
port former President Jimmy
Carter's 1982 budget allocation to
peacetime registration. Moore told
the Palo Alto citizen group
A former senior staff adviser for the
Council of Economic Advisers under
President Lyndon Johnson. Moore
said Reagan cannot immediately im
plement his campaign promise to
abolish peacetime registration "Rea
gan cannot just issue an executive or
der to stop registration because Con
gress has already appropriated the
money in the 1982 budget According to
a Supreme Court decision, the ex
ecutive must spend appropriated mon
ey," said the Hoover Institution direc
tor of domestic studies
Maintaining that Reagan "has
taken more heat on this issue than on
anv other," Moore said the president
will have to make some decision on
registration and the draft by autumn,
introduction time for the next fiscal
budget.
Moore predicted Reagan would im
plement his verbal campaign stance
against registration saying, "His rec

ord to date for doing what lie said he
would do ha: been good."
A spokesman for 144 prominent
economists who issued a statement
against the draft. Moore spent the
greater part of his 40-minute dis
cussion pointing to contended
fallacies in several pro-draft argu
ments.
Proponents of the draft maintain
conscription is fairer than an all-vol
unteer force. Such reasoning is
fallacious, according to Moore "In
any draft there are unlimited pro
visions for 'due process ' The draft
opens up endless opportunities for
bright kids to find exemptions to its
provisions "
"Upper income groups have signifi
cant advantage in avoiding conscrip
tion They are better informed They
can attend meetings like this They
can obtain doctors' excuses." Moore
added
Moore countered a draft sup
porters' contentions ot an excessively
expensive volunteer force. Military
salaries need to be raised, regardless
ot conscription's policy status, ac
cording to Moore "It is unseemly that
sailors and soldiers must use food
stamps "
Conscription would not be necessar
ily more representative than a volun
teer army, noted Moore. "A Pentagon
studv showed, with small exceptions
at either end of the income scale, that
the enlisted force is representative of
the civilian population In any case the
draft won't help since the military will
only be drafting 27.1)00 people a year,
the manpower need not currently met
by the volunteer force This number is
unlikely to have a significant effect on
representation."
