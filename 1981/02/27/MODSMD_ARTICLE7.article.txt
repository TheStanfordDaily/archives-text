## Thatcher-Reagan visit promises conservative mutual admiration 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The challenge
of putting their almost identi
cal, radically conservative eco
nomic philosophies to critical
political tests in the coming
months is expected to override
the uiual summit meeting dis
cussions of world affairs during
British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's visit with
President Ronald Reagan here
this week.
Reagan and Thatcher are ex
pected to give each other plenty
of encouragement during her
three days here. British and
American officials are expect
ing a "love feast" of mutual ad
miration for each other's free
enterprise evangelism at home
and staunch anti-communism
abroad. A senior American
diplomat said Thatcher "can
expect a very sympathetic au
dience for whatever she wants
to say."
The package of budget and
tax cuts announced by Reagan
Wednesday — coupled with his
administration's attack on gov
ernment regulation and the high
interest rates Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker is using
to discourage borrowing, slow
the growth of the money supply

and squeeze down inflation — is
remarkably similar in overall
approach to what Thatcher set
out to do in Britain. In a radical
departure from all previous
postwar governments in Britain
and the United States. Thatcher
and Reagan have renounced the
use of government money and
power to spur economic activity
and bring about social change.
Thatcher is cutting spending
on subsidized housing, educa
tion, local government, un
employment and some welfare
benefits and public works — just
as Reagan wants to do. She also
is reducing the number of gov
ernment employees and.
belatedly, trying to hold down
their pay increases — just as
Reagan intends. Her govern
ment is even experimenting
with "urban enterprise zones"
where red tape would be cut to
attract new enterprises to dying
inner city areas at relatively lit
tle cost to the government —
just as Reagan proposes doing.
Thatcher also sought, like
Reagan, to reduce the income
tax bite on middle-and upper-in
come people, believing it would
provide an incentive for them to
work harder, save and invest
more money to help get the

economy moving again. The re
cession's drain on government
revenue has forced her to post
pone real relief for the majority
of Britons, whose total tax
burden actually has increased
under Thatcher.
The best-paid Britons have
benefited some, but there is no
sign that they have ploughed
their extra money back into the
sagging British economy.
The growing crisis Thatcher
inherited when she became
prime minister nearly two
years ago has only gotten worse.
Britain's manufacturing output
during the last three months of
1980 fell by 14 percent from the
same period in 1979 — the worst
slump since the 19305. Even
counting Britain's North Sea oil
bonanza, total industrial pro
duction dropped 9 percent —
pulling the British economy
back 13 years, to levels of 1967.
Unemployment has
burgeoned to 10 percent of the
British labor force — another
post-Depression record — and is
still rising rapidly.
When asked about this,
Thatcher admits some mis
takes. including moving more
slowly and cautiously than in

tended on government spending
and pay. She also points out that
she began her experiment with a
weaker economy at a worse
time than Reagan. She recently
told a group of American cor
respondents in London that Rea
gan is fortunate not to be con
fronting the beginning of a
world recession, a sharp in
crease in oil prices and the rapid
decline of expensively sub
sidized nationalized industries
as she did nearly two years ago.
Thatcher recently has de
parted from her strategy to ac
commodate reality by giving
more money to slimmed-down.
government-owned auto and
steel industries, and increasing
spending on training and job
creation programs for the grow
ing number of unemployed
young adults.
Explaining these "adjust
ments" to Parliament recently,
Thatcher's new leader of the
House of Commons, Francis
Pym, said, "The simple truth is
that in the light of the de
terioration in the world and
domestic economic framework,
we could neither press ahead re
gardless with our planned
schedule nor avoid some much
needed measures to deal with
some of the distressing ef
fects."
