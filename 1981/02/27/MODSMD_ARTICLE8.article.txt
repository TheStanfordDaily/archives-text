# First-class males enfranchised
## Kuwait's voters go moderate 
### Washington Post 
Kuwait — Bathed in national self-con
gratulation over the very act of voting.
Kuwait's first-class citizens awoke Tuesday to
discover they had elected a moderate National
Assembly free of threatening outside in
fluences both old and new.
This was the upshot of Monday's elections
for citizens of this wealthy oil nation, who until
recently feared the government would invoke
the Persian Gulf war and general Arab world
disarray to postpone the vote. The results in
stead combined rejection of the new bugaboo
embodied by Iran's once-feared or revered Is
lamic revolution and elimination of the faded
pan-Arab leftist heritage of the late President
Gamal A.bdel Nasser of Egypt.
Mere than 440 candidates without formal
party affiliations competed for the votes of
43.000 male, first-class Kuwaiti citizens,
roughly 3 percent of Kuwait's 1.4 million in
habitants. Madison Avenue hoopla mixed with
desert bedouin traditions marked the month
long campaign, which provided a serious de
bating forum and clearing house for competing
ideas on the eve of Kuwait's 25th anniversary
as an independent state.
Surprise
Many expressed surprise that the emir, or
ruling prince — Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber
al-Sabah — had kept his word, albeit with a six
month delay, to hold the elections after all
In terms of influence, if not absolute num
bers, the big winners were the government and
the Moslem fundamentalists of the dominant
Sunni sect who here as elsewhere rode the
crest of resurgent Islam. They won four of the
50 seats by eliminating the previously vocal

Arab nationalist lay left and playing on anti-
Iranian backlash to reduce the Shiite Moslem
representation from 10 to four seats.
Also helping curb a possible pro-Iranian
surge among the local Shiites — who form the
majority sect in Iran and 25 percent of
Kuwait's population — were redrawn voting
districts that effectively ensured their loss of
seats.
Hailed as a test of democracy and a
challenge to the volatile Middle East's author
itarian regimes, the elections in fact pleased
the hereditary ruling sheiks by removing their
harshest critics. Also likely to be pleased were
Kuwait's neighbors fearful of an activist par
liament's potential spillover effect on them.
Younger, better educated merchants and
technocrats — often graduates of American
universities — were also elected in significant
numbers to a National Assembly nevertheless
numerically dominated by more than 20 gener
ally pro-government representatives of the
less sophisticated and recently settled bedouin
tribes.
But the focus was less on who won than on
the pride Kuwaitis felt in voting at all.
Calmer
Even before the moderates' triumph,
Kuwaitis expected the new National Assembly
to be calmer than its predecessor, which
foundered on the shoals of the Lebanese civil
war's local repercussions, general criticism of
the government and the free-swinging press
that is still the Arab world's most outspoken.
The overriding issue then was nationalizing
Kuwait's oil and gas — the reserves are among
the largest in the world — and the leftist op
position got its way eventually.
