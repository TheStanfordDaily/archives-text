# Judge covers sexism in the courts
## 
### Patty Kammerer 
"Most judges want to do what
they are supposed to do that
is. to be fair." There are. how
ever. often clear instances of
sexual discrimination in the
courtroom. Ways of exposing
and eliminating this sexism was
the topic of the speech "Educat
ing Judges About Sexism" given
by the Honorable Judge Marilyn
Patel as part of the Center for
Research on Women (CROW)
noon-hour lecture series on
"Women and Equality — Law
and Justice."
Patel, a graduate of Fordham
University School of Law and
presently a judge for the U.S.
District Court of the Northern
District of California, has
served as a judge for five years.
She came to the profession after
a career in private law practice
and teaching at Hastings School
of Law.
Patel said that "the educa

tional process has to operate
from the premise that most
judges want to be fair There is
nothing more dear than the
sound discretion of the trial
judge." This discretion, how
ever. can be influenced by
forces that the judge is not fully
aware of
Patel said that the primary
problem that women face is in
establishing their "credibility,"
be they witnesses, attorneys or
judges themselves.
For the witness this problem
is most apparent in rape cases.
The judge's perception of the
woman's credibility will ob
viously effect the outcome of
the case An example is the in
troduction of a woman's prior
sexual conduct as "evidence" of
her "guilt."
Patel said that female at
torneys also experience this
"credibility" problem. It has
been manifested in cases where

a male attorney belittles his
female opponent or the judge
simply doubts the female's ca
pacity to defend her client.
For a judge. Patel said, "It is
essential that everyone who
comes into the courtroom be
lieves you are a fair judge." By
choosing a career in the legal
profession, certain commit
ments and sacrifices must be
made Patel said that a judge
must continually examine
his her attitudes and refrain
from taking actions which could
give the impression of being
biased (i.e. belonging to a club
that excludes minorities).
Patel was optimistic about
the prospects for educating
judges about sexism. She said
the greatest remedy is "more
women on the bench." The
sheer impact of greater peer
group pressure can not help but
be influential.
She also explained that educa

tional programs, such as the
mid-career program put on by
the California .Judges College,
have been very successful This
type of seminar examines the is
sue of a woman's credibility in
the legal system The partici
pants discuss the underlying
reasons which influence a
judge s perception of a woman
and the tactics necessary to deal
with the problem of sexism in
the courtroom.
Patel cited one example of an
older man on the witness stand
who kept referring to the wom
an prosecutor as "honey."
When Patel (as the judge) quiet
ly reminded him that this was a
courtroom and it was not proper
to address an attorney as "hon
ey," he immediately apologized
saying. "I'm just used to calling
ali you broads honev!" It is
clear that our judicial system is
not the only place where some
education is needed
