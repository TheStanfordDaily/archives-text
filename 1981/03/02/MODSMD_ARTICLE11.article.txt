# Soviet, U.S. influences examined
## East Asia discussed in symposium 
### Karen Halbo 
Franklin Weinstein, Director of Asian
Studies at Stanford, identified East Asia's
unifying interest as the perception of the So
viet threat and possible responses to that
threat, during the "East Asia and the Pacif
ic: Challenges to Security" symposium at
CERAS last Wednesday.
Weinstein, who chaired the symposium,
emphasized the perception of a threat from
the Soviets in the East Asian area, and the
resulting intensification of bonds between
the U.S. and Japan. He also said that the So
viet threat "adds to the military coopera
tion between China and the U.S."
Andrew Nagorski. former Newsweek bu
reau chief from Hong Kong, said "The U.S.
policy in the area has gone through various
cycles. . . we seem to be going back to look
ing at this area as an extension of East-West
(U.S.-Soviet) tension."
Nagorski asserted that present U.S. poli
cy in the area seems to always be reacting
to Soviet threats. Nargorski said that this
tactic "produces counterproductive poli
cy."
Coit Blacker, Assistant Director of Stan
ford's Arms Control Program, stressed the
Soviet perception of the East Asian situ
ation. "The Soviets perceive themselves as
being surrounded by hostile actors." said
Blacker, citing NATO, Japan. China and the
U.S. as groups and countries the Soviet
Union perceives as hostile.

"The Soviets have a strong incentive to
arrest, if not reverse, the U.S. — Sino rela
tionship. especially the military ties, " said
Blacker. He explained that the Soviets wish
to reduce their vulnerability in the East
Asian area, and claimed the Soviets view it
as"a major and ongoing strategic
challenge."
Presenting the American view of the East
Asian area was John Emerson, Chairman of
Stanford's Program in U.S.-Japan Rela
tions. Emerson spoke after Blacker, and he
targeted five points of concern for Ameri
can policy makers viewing the East Asian
situation: — U.S. alliance with Japan. Em
erson called the area "the lynch pin of our
security in the Pacific." — the stability of
North and South Korea. Emerson said that
the presence of American forces in both
North and South Korea is. "of tremendous
importance." — the People's Republic of
China. Emerson cited the nonrecognition of
China as, "an unfortunate twenty year
lapse." He also said that now, after grant
ing China recognintion. "Our relations are
continuing and expanding in a rapid
manner." — the security of Taiwan. Emer
son stressed American interest in the area,
and stated that, "We would not be uncon
cerned if there were threats to the peace or
stability of Taiwan." — relations with the
Soviet Union. "I do not think that we should
give up a dialogue with the Soviet Union,"
stated Emerson.
Lt. Col. Yoshihisa Nakamura. of Japan's

National Defense Academy, began by citing
a public poll in Japan that showed. "58 per
cent of the people believe the Soviets will in
vade Japan." This apprehension by many
Japanese is based on the present level of
Japanese preparedness, and on the
Japanese perception of the credibility of the
U.S. military commitment to Japan, ac
cording to Nakamura.
Nakamura cited the dismay many
Japanese felt when, during the hostage
crises, the carriers assigned to defend
Japan went to the Indian Ocean "To save 52
Americans, they risk over a million
Japanese," said Nakamura.
Doug Murray, Director of Stanford's
U.S.-China Relations Program said. "We
have become inured to the dramatic ques
tions we face over the years (in that area
Hua Di. of the People's Republic of China,
presented his personal view that the Soviet
leadership has a master plan to conquer the
world. Di discribed this plan as including
plans to restrain the U.S. in the Western
hemisphere (by stirring up the South Amer
ican nations), then to clamp on Europe via
the Persian Gulf.
Di stressed the global imbalance that ex
ists between the Soviets and the U.S., and
said that the although there is a balance con
cerning nuclear weapons, there is "An im
balance of conventional forces (which fa
vors the Soviet Union)."
