# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Bambi Markel Club Med only as a last resort 
### 
The article. "Fulfilling Sum
mer Travel Dreams," by Dinah
Lahnala and Ann Welecka (Daf
fy, Feb. 23). provides travel op
tions for people with much mon
ey ("If your idea of a vacation is
playing native for a few weeks.
Club Med has the perfect
deal"). Some Stanford students
do have extravagant sums to
spare ("$568 to London. $934 to
Rome'') many do not. And if one
is interested in "playing
native." one can discover, for
example, the wonders of three
sided. decrepit tin shacks, con
veniently located within a one
mile radius of the Club Med in
Guadeloupe.
Those who do have the money
should consider the effects of
spending it in exclusive resorts
in "colorful little fishing vil
lages." Having worked my way
through most of the Caribbean
islands last year. I can attest to
the economic and cultural rav
ages of havens like Club Med.
Caneel Bay, the sumptious
Rockefeller resort on St. John in
the U.S. Virgin islands, provides
an example. Caneel swallow up
huge amounts of the island's wa
ter supply, so scarce that West
Indians refer to water as the
"gold of the Caribbean."
Moreover, the incredibly
spacious resort ties up acres of
formerly lush farmland ("Oh,
but what beautiful grounds!")
The resort has taken away the
livelihoods of the natives;
Caneel Bay now has no short
ages of maids.
While excessively absorbing
the natural resources of St.
John, the Caneel Bay man
agement refuses to pump any of
its earnings back into the island,
even when it could easily do so.
In the midst of the fish-laden
Caribbean Sea. along with an
abundant force of local fish

erman. the resort prefers to im
port a more "reliable" flow of
frozen fish from New York
Clubs such as Caneel wreak
havoc upon not only the econo
my but also the culture of their
host islands. Wealthy Ameri
cans lusting for pleasure dangle
their extravagant lifestyles
before the eves of those who
have neither many material
goods, nor the means to gain
more. Carefree vacationers
plant the seeds of desire and of
discontent. Would the tourists
but step outside the boundaries
of their $200-per-night oasis,
they might avail themselves of a
culture brimming with exotic
music and dance, of a friendly
and happy people — at least
before the advent of Americans.
Fancy resorts result in is
landers deprecating their socie
ty. while it is ours which merits
examination.
I do not fault the authors of
"Fulfilling Summer Travel
Dreams" for merely suggesting
the best airplane packages for
those interested in venturing to
Tahiti. After all, this is the ac
cepted American way to relieve
tension. But it is this urge to
spend a week in Club Med in Ta
hiti which warrants scrutiny.
Each dollar spent in such a re
sort has far-ranging effects
which should be ignored no long
er. Cheaper, more exciting, and
less destructive travel plans
abound.
Drawing again from St. John.
I suggest a visit to the glorious
and unusual Mahoe Bay. Here,
for approximately $15 a night,
each vacationing group can stay
in a large, comfortable, se
cluded treehouse. almost in
visible from more than 20 feet
away. Even my own mother, a
traveller of The Old School who
refuses to be caught dead sport

ing a backpack, saw Mahoe and
approved.
One can jump on a train or a
bicycle. One can catch a cargo
ship out of New Bedford. Massa
chusetts. and travel to Europe
free in exchange for work — in
less than two weeks. Even the
wealthy French go camping
during their vacations.
Surely after appreciating the
destructive influence of ex
clusive resorts, we can learn to
vacation in other way. After all.
wouldn't you prefer to ex
perience a culture first-hand
rather than peer at it from be
hind closed doors?
