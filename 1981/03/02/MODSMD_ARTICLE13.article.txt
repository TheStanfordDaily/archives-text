## Politics in the saddle in a one horse town 
### 
Washington is a one horse
town, and that horse is govern
ment. If the Japanese and Ger
mans were producing govern
ments better than ours and ex
porting them to the United
States at prices cheaper than
the federal government. Wash
ington would look a lot like De
troit. No offense. Detroit.
But that is not the case. The
Lone Ranger of government has
ridden into D.C., brandishing
his new kind of crime fighting,
and the mood around here is
high. People talk about change,
expect it to occur, and jump on
the bandwagon to be a part of it.
No one wants to be "left" out.
Congressman Toby Moffet. a
recognized liberal, said while
speaking to a group of interns:
"The Democratic Party is no
longer that Democratic Party of
the past if the biggest complaint
they have about Reagan's
budget cuts is the synfuels pro
gram." He was voicing a recog
nized fact - that the numbers
may seem a bit misleading, but
the place has gone conservative.
The atmosphere is still being

tested. Although the attitude is
as expansive is the California
sky, you can sense its fragility.
At a committee hearing featur
ing testimony from Interior Sec
retary James Watt, one Con
gressman insistently com
mented that he hoped 'the re
ports and the attitudes would be
as good next year." In other
words, it's fun to be conserva
tive until it becomes a major
failure. It is as if people were
waiting the inevitable collapse.
Tension can be sensed in any
one you talk with. It's not a
healthy way to live, although the
pressure doesn't trickle down to
interns too quickly.
Congress is afraid to make
any moves. After the speech the
bail is in their court. They've
only met once since I arrived
more than a month ago. The
"pro forma" sessions - basical
ly an attendance record to flash
back in the district - happen
each day. *
Seeing them in a session,
though, is a trip. It's not like the
orderly debates carried on at
the ASSU Senate. In contrast.

there seems to be a lot of good
jokes on the floor. Republicans
have the market on those; no of
fense.
For outsider, it is time to get
involved in the political process.
Making your voice heard in the
center of the system is the first
order of business for many of
the special interest groups in
town. Office visits? Yes, but
there's one place universally
known for making high level
deals and really laying it on the
line: the bar.
"Bar" in Washington trans
lates to reception. A nicer word
for something of similar means
and ends: Nametags, smiles,
handshakes, conversation.
Three or four of these events
can be found upon the hill in any
given evening. For hungry staf
fers like myself it means not
having to cook dinner. For Con
gressman with an agenda inches
long per evening, it means no
dinner at all.
One man at a reception had an
interesting comment. "I feel
strange doing this kind of stuff.
How can I tell my position to the
Congressman without feeling
guilty?"
"Worst of all," he said, "how
can the Congressman listen
without feeling the same way?"
Politics is on everyone's
mind, but no one has an easy
time dealing with it. Even in
bars politics is the subject. In
stead of talking about the
weather in D C., you talk about
the White House. Local news is
a total washout. The place needs
a crime wave to keep the
citizens from feeling irrelevant.
But then why worry about local
muggings on 14th Street if two
blocks away the most important

man in the Western world is
making a major decision?
We were riding along Wiscon
sin Avenue to Georgetown for a
drink. That's the class place to
get drunk. Copies of The Preppy
Handbook are found in places
where phonebooks should be.
You recognize the crowd: peo
ple seen on the hill, or aspirants
thereof. Seeming prominent is
key. I asked one man" What
makes you so damn important?
No one really is.
We were riding the bus. The
crowd was lively, talking, get
ting ready for a Saturday night.
No John Travoltas.
We stop. Then, we don't start.
About 37 seconds later, after
carefully calculating his re
sponse, the driver turns around
sheepishly to the uninterested
passengers: "Ladies and gen
tlemen, this bus ... I think it's
out of gas."
In a sense. Washington is like
that bus. "Ladies and gen
tlemen, the New Deal, ... I
think it's out of gas." Attitudes
reflect change, old ideas are
spoken of being gone, and antici
pation is in the air. But who
knows? Maybe Ronnie will turn
around some day, take Nancy's
hand, and say "Ladies and gen
tlemen, this nation, I think it's
out of gas. "
What the hell, though. I mean,
we still got to Georgetown. I got
very drunk. And that bus is
probably waiting to run out of
gas somewhere else. Want a
transfer?

that bus. "Ladies and gen
tlemen, the New Deal, ... I
think it's out of gas." Attitudes
reflect change, old ideas are
spoken of being gone, and antici
pation is in the air. But who
knows? Maybe Ronnie will turn
around some day, take Nancy's
hand, and say "Ladies and gen
tlemen, this nation, I think it's
out of gas. "
What the hell, though. I mean,
we still got to Georgetown. I got
very drunk. And that bus is
probably waiting to run out of
gas somewhere else. Want a
transfer?

Washington is a one horse
town, and that horse is govern
ment. If the Japanese and Ger
mans were producing govern
ments better than ours and ex
porting them to the United
States at prices cheaper than
the federal government. Wash
ington would look a lot like De
troit. No offense. Detroit.
But that is not the case. The
Lone Ranger of government has
ridden into D.C., brandishing
his new kind of crime fighting,
and the mood around here is
high. People talk about change,
expect it to occur, and jump on
the bandwagon to be a part of it.
No one wants to be "left" out.
Congressman Toby Moffet. a
recognized liberal, said while
speaking to a group of interns:
"The Democratic Party is no
longer that Democratic Party of
the past if the biggest complaint
they have about Reagan's
budget cuts is the synfuels pro
gram." He was voicing a recog
nized fact - that the numbers
may seem a bit misleading, but
the place has gone conservative.
The atmosphere is still being

tested. Although the attitude is
as expansive is the California
sky, you can sense its fragility.
At a committee hearing featur
ing testimony from Interior Sec
retary James Watt, one Con
gressman insistently com
mented that he hoped 'the re
ports and the attitudes would be
as good next year." In other
words, it's fun to be conserva
tive until it becomes a major
failure. It is as if people were
waiting the inevitable collapse.
Tension can be sensed in any
one you talk with. It's not a
healthy way to live, although the
pressure doesn't trickle down to
interns too quickly.
Congress is afraid to make
any moves. After the speech the
bail is in their court. They've
only met once since I arrived
more than a month ago. The
"pro forma" sessions - basical
ly an attendance record to flash
back in the district - happen
each day. *
Seeing them in a session,
though, is a trip. It's not like the
orderly debates carried on at
the ASSU Senate. In contrast.

there seems to be a lot of good
jokes on the floor. Republicans
have the market on those; no of
fense.
For outsider, it is time to get
involved in the political process.
Making your voice heard in the
center of the system is the first
order of business for many of
the special interest groups in
town. Office visits? Yes, but
there's one place universally
known for making high level
deals and really laying it on the
line: the bar.
"Bar" in Washington trans
lates to reception. A nicer word
for something of similar means
and ends: Nametags, smiles,
handshakes, conversation.
Three or four of these events
can be found upon the hill in any
given evening. For hungry staf
fers like myself it means not
having to cook dinner. For Con
gressman with an agenda inches
long per evening, it means no
dinner at all.
One man at a reception had an
interesting comment. "I feel
strange doing this kind of stuff.
How can I tell my position to the
Congressman without feeling
guilty?"
"Worst of all," he said, "how
can the Congressman listen
without feeling the same way?"
Politics is on everyone's
mind, but no one has an easy
time dealing with it. Even in
bars politics is the subject. In
stead of talking about the
weather in D C., you talk about
the White House. Local news is
a total washout. The place needs
a crime wave to keep the
citizens from feeling irrelevant.
But then why worry about local
muggings on 14th Street if two
blocks away the most important

man in the Western world is
making a major decision?
We were riding along Wiscon
sin Avenue to Georgetown for a
drink. That's the class place to
get drunk. Copies of The Preppy
Handbook are found in places
where phonebooks should be.
You recognize the crowd: peo
ple seen on the hill, or aspirants
thereof. Seeming prominent is
key. I asked one man" What
makes you so damn important?
No one really is.
We were riding the bus. The
crowd was lively, talking, get
ting ready for a Saturday night.
No John Travoltas.
We stop. Then, we don't start.
About 37 seconds later, after
carefully calculating his re
sponse, the driver turns around
sheepishly to the uninterested
passengers: "Ladies and gen
tlemen, this bus ... I think it's
out of gas."
