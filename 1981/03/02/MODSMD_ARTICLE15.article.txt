## Humor is the forgotten weapon of feminism 
### 
"What is man. that thou art
m indf ul of him?" —
Shakespeare
Feminists, as a rule, tend to
be rather humorless about their
pet topic. Not that this is very
surprising — centuries of op
pression have a funny way of
stifling one's sense of humor
about a subject, and revolu
tionaries (with the possible ex
ception of Woody Allen in Love
and Death are notoriously un
willing to see the humorous
sides of their cause.
This is a distinct problem
when writing about feminism:
there are always those who feel
that feminism is too important a
topic to joke about, as well as
those who feel that a male is in
herently incapable of treating
the subject in a sensitive
manner — would you ask Dr.

Shockley to write about apart
heid 9
Feminists, like outspoken ad
vocates of any cause, often have
trouble drawing a distinction
between what's important to
their cause and what's only
marginal. To many feminists,
everything is either black or
white; you believe in the cause
or you don't, and there are no
shades of gray or halfway be
lievers.
This attitude seems to have
taken hold in many of the wom
en at Stanford. For instance, a
woman in one my classes who
clearly feels very strongly
about feminism has interrupted
discussions of Wallace Stevens
to announce that we simply
can't ignore Steven's profound
misogyny any longer. The un
spoken implication is that a poet

who can't portray women sym
pathetically is unable to see
beyond the tip of his own nose,
let along write anything worth
reading.
Professor Nannerl Keohane
had a very valid point when she
complained that the Western
Culture courses at Stanford
focus almost exclusively on
male writers, but the sad fact is
that nine out of ten of the writers
we think of as important are
males. Should we focus on writ
ers of less talent or experience
simply because they are wom
en? This kind of literary af
firmative action would be little
more than tokenism, and would
miss the point of the Western
Culture requirement complete
ly. Tom Jones and The Sun Also
Rises are sexist by anyone's
standards, but does this mean
that they should be banned from
the classroom?
The Stanford Daily style
sheet, given out to all pros
pective writers for the Daily,
has a section on "sexist lan
guage" that was apparently
written by one of these well
meaning but humorless
feminists:
"For words that denote oc
cupations, use constructs that
avoid sex-specific suffices: e.g,
firefighter, not fireman, police
officer, not policeman, business
executive, not businessman.
Also, work-hours, not man
hours, staff a table, not man a
table, mail carrier, not
mailman, coucilmember, not
councilman."
Although this looks fine on pa
per, the more you try to leave
out those suffixes that carry "an
unnecessary assumption of
sex," the more convoluted and
difficult your language be
comes. For example, the White
House staff recently held a
"snowperson" contest, as if the
sexual implications of a snow
man are somehow too much for
men and women to handle. Do
we really want to replace
"doorman" with "doorperson,"
which sounds like someone with
a fetish for portals? For that
matter, does "man a table" re
ally belong in this category of
sexist language? Perhaps all of

this confusion should be
eliminated with an across-the
board substitution of a com
pletely generic term for
''man." For instance,
"Madame Chaircreature, I ob
ject"; "We'll need more
waiters to people the tables";
"I wonder if the postbeing has
come yet"; or "How many hu
man-hours did you put in this
week?"
Still another gripe of the hard
core feminist is the in
discriminate use of the personal
pronoun "he" a generic "he" is
no longer acceptable, since it
carries with it the unwanted as
sumption of male sex. The most
common solution is to use "he or
she." but this often results in
sentences that are confusing
and laborious: e.g., "If heorshe
is undecided, I tell him or her to
wait a year or two before put
ting in his or her application."
An alternative to this might
be the experimental pronoun
"heesh." The problem with
"heesh" is that you sound like a
drunk when you say it out loud,
and it gives rise to some nasty
tongue-twisters: try saying
"Heesh sells seashells by the
seashore" three times fast.
But perhaps the most un
fortunate aspect of this kind of
humorless feminism is the tacit
denial of gender that many
feminists have come to expect.
During my undergraduate years
in Boston, it was implicitly un
derstood that a woman would
pay for her own dinner and mov
ie. and to open a door for her
would have been the most insult
ing act of sexism imaginable.
This brand of "equality or noth
ing!" feminism has become en
trenched in the fertile young
minds of women at Radcliffe,
Vassar and Barnard in a way
that simply has no parallel on
the West Coast.
Perhaps this is because
Eastern feminists have always
used as their role models wom
en like Gloria Steinhem and
Bella Abzug, while out here
there seems to be a surplus of
ersatz movie feminists like
Jane Fonda. Goldie Hawn and
Dolly Parton, who probably
draw more lecherous men than

concerned feminists to the
theatre.
If hard-core, humorless
feminism is one extreme, then
tentative or "chic" feminism is
the other. Hollywood's recent
spate of "feminist" movies is
one result of this trend, which
Boulevards magazine called "a
predigested kind of pablum
feminism." In a review of
Private Benjamin and Nine to
Fjve, they said. "This is
feminism run through a
Cuisinart and pureed to the con
sistency of baby food." Yet both
of tl>pse movies were written
and produced bv (one hopes) se
rious, intelligent women.
These examples of mushy,
peanut-brained feminism
should be the real targets of
feminist criticism, not a film
like Brian DePalma's Dressed
to Kill. While far more brutal,
at least Dressed to Kill shocked
us away from the dangerous no
tion that all women want to be
raped, while films like Nine to
Five simply take legitimate
feminism and dip it in a vat of
harmless molten marshmallow.
When you consider
long neglect at the
hands of an indifferent male so
ciety, it's not hard to under
stand why its supporters have
been so grim and unwavering in
their outlook. But revolutions
are rarely won by brute force
alone. There has to be some
weakening of the existing struc
ture first, and old ideas must be
softened and relaxed before
they can be safely ridiculed and
then swept aside. Humor is
potentially one of the strongest
weapons at the disposal of
feminists, and the movement
must realize that poking fun at a
cause doesn't necessarily mean
cheapening or undermining it.
The final test of any moral
stand, any philosophy, is its
ability to placidly withstand
criticism and to retain its inte
grity even in the face of de
rision; so far, feminism's rec
ord has done it little credit.
