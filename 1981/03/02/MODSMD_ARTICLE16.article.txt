Mime of its time
Cory Foster's critique of
ABT's La Bayadere (Daily,
Feb. 12), demands comment.
According to Foster. La
Bayadere's plot lacks develop
ment and excitement. Perhaps,
but narrative ballet is by nature
a poor vehicle to present sophis
ticated character development
or exciting plot. What kind of
subtleties can mime convey?
She states, "... when the
story of a ballet is dull, the
choreography strives to make
up for it through exciting new
moves and challenges for the
dancers." This ballet is not a
new work by Natalia
Makarova's faithful staging of
Marius Petipa's 1877 choreo
graphy. Foster's criticism here
is about as valid as condemning
a Mozart work for lacking
modern tonalities.
Foster's comment regarding
the "phallus-like arabesque" is
silly. An arabesque is a basic
manifestation of the classical
ballet line. It has no meaning as
such and is only expressive in
the context of the choreography.
Foster's assertion that a female
(the temple dancer) show love
with a phallic symbol is crude
and lacks plausibility.
The mime Foster criticizes as
"unimaginative" is a stylized
vocabulary of theatrical ex
pression dating back centuries.
It reached its peak of develop
ment and use at the Maryinsky

Theatre in the late nineteenth
century. It was a standard in all
ballets from that period. It's
rather pointless to defend
further the nuances of Petipa's
choreography. In the context of
nineteenth century classical
ballet. Petipa's choreography
for La Bayadere is a highly
creative and outstanding
achievement.

As pointed out earlier by a
student in these columns, there
were three mistakes in the edi
torial on South Korea (I)ailv,
Feb. 12).
As a Korean student, I was
surprised at the mistakes rather
than the editorial itself.
Thinking of about one hun
dred Korean students studying
here, the editorial should have
been written more carefully.
These mistakes occured largely
due to the writer's misinforma
tions and misunderstandings
about Korea.
It is true that many criticisms
in newspapers related to some
developing countries' issues
have been written on biased con
cept without enough thoughts or
generous understandings.
We cannot criticize a country
so easily unless we have enough
knowledge about its unique his
torical backgrounds and the re
cent circumstances.

For example, many for
eigners still cannot understand
the U.S.'s no gun-control policy
because they do not know much
about the historical character
istics of the States.
I hope that Korea will develop
into a more desirable democrat
ic country, but simultaneously
that all of us will be more de
sirable balanced critics who are
more helpful advisers for the
country.
