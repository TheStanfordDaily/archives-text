## Congress to debate tax, budget cuts 
### 
Washington (AP) — Argu
ments over taxes and chopping
the federal budget will get a full
airing on Capitol Hill this week
as Congress awaits complete
details of President Ronald
Reagan's economic proposals.
Lane Kirkland, president of
the AFL-CIO, is scheduled to
tell the House Budget Commit
tee Wednesday about organized
labor's view of the adminis
tration plans.
And the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee,

which so far has not given a very
favorable reception to Reagan's
tax cut plans, has called in a
number of economists in addi
tion to Federal Reserve Chair
man Paul Volcker.
Although the president out
lined his plans on Feb. 18, ad
ministration officials have said
Reagan will not submit a de
tailed revision of the 1982 feder
al budget until March 10.
Meantime, Cabinet officials
have been before committees
daily pitching for cuts in spend

ing and taxes in an intensive lob
bying effort that a House Demo
cratic research group dubbed
"Reagan's congressional
squeeze play."
Generally, Republicans have
been pushing for prompt action
on the entire package which
they say is essential to restoring
the nation's economic health.
Democrats, however, are
criticizing the plans as being un
fair, tilted in favor the well-to
do and almost certain to prompt
a new round of inflation.
Reagan has proposed a three
year package of $125.9 billion in
cuts, including reducing the 1982
budget by more than $40 billion
and cutting individual income
taxes across-the-board by an av
erage of 10 percent a year for
three years.
While the Budget Committee
in the Republican-controlled
Senate is pushing forward with
constructing a package of

spending cuts in hopes of pres
suring the House to take similar
quick action, the committees of
the Democrat-conu oiled House
are are holding off until they see
the full Reagan program.
"The House is just too big to
spurt off in one direction all
dressed the same," said a Dem
ocratic staffer.
Another witness scheduled to
appear before the Ways and
Means Committee is economist
Arthur Laffer, whose con
troversial "Laffer Curve" pre
dicts that cuts in tax rates
should increase economic ac
tivity and thus bring higher, not
lower, tax revenue. This as
sumption has been the basis of
administration claims that it is
possible to have cuts in business
and individual taxes as well as
increases in defense spending
coupled with budget cuts in oth
er areas, all while avoiding in
creased inflation.
