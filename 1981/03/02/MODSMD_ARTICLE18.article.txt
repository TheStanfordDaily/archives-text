# Workers prevent chemical waste leak

### 
Epping, N.H. (AP) â€” Federal
environmental emergency ex
perts working in a driving sleet
storm Saturday raised the level
of a retaining wall to prevent a
rain-swollen lagoon filled with
nearly one million gallons of
toxic waste from overflowing.
"I think we've got a chance
now to control this before it ov
erflows," said Carl Eidam,
head of the Environmental Pro
tection Agency's emergency re
sponse team. "We've got to
keep a close watch on the weath
er, but the extra foot of dirt
around the lagoon has given us a
little more time."
The EPA on Friday declared
an environmental emergency at
the man-made lagoon at Keefe
Environmental Services. The
agency ordered cleanup experts
and equipment to the southern
New Hampshire site from as far
away as New Jersey.
"There is clearly an immi
nent hazard of the waste over
topping the walls," said Steve
Novick, EPA's on-scene coordi
nator. "It's too close to the top
now, and the rain expected this
weekend could take it over. We
had to do something quickly."
Workers wore respirators
As helicopters carrying gov

ernment inspectors and tele
vision crews circled the 17-acre
chemical storage site, workers
wearing respirators used
shovels, backhoes and a large
crane to add dirt to the thick, 8-
foot-high walls of the plastic
lined lagoon, which is 120 feet
square.
"It's the largest chemical
storage lagoon in the country,"
said Paul Keefe, owner of the
operation. "When we built it in
1979, it was the state of the art,
and I built it big because EPA
said it was a good way to handle
waste."
Keefe used the lagoon to ex
pose chemical wastes to the sun
so water would evaporate. He
shipped the residue to licensed
disposal or treatment sites
elsewhere in the region.
An EPA analysis of the
lagoon's contents showed the
usual toxic shopping list of
acids, solvents and heavy
metals. Officials said the toxici
ty of the liquids increased great
ly toward the bottom of the
lagoon.
"It's not a healthy situation,"
said Eidam. "We're worried
that if the stuff overflows, it will
go into the groundwater or
through a swamp into the
Piscassic River."
