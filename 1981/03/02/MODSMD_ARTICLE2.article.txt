# Stanford prof to testify
## Evolution debate goes to trial 
### Pate Skene 
Three generations of a San Diego
creationist family will appear in Sac
ramento Superior Court today to
argue that Darwinian evolution Is a rfe
ligious construct, not a scientific theo
ry, and that public schools' teaching of
evolution as an established scientific
principle violates the U.S. Constitu
tion's First Amendment prohibition
against a state "establishment of re
ligion."
Stanford biochemist and Nobel
laureate Arthur Kornberg is among
witnesses to be called to defend the
scientific basis of evolutionary theo
ry.
Kornberg said he expects to be

called later in the trial, "possibly
Wednesday," to testify on the basis of
"my experience and conviction that
this (evolution) is a proven set of oper
ations that Is tantamount to a law of
nature." adding that he considers the
principle of Darwinian evolution
"beyond controversy."
"The question," he said, "is wheth
er evolution is controversial... we do
research and can argue about the
mechanisms, but the basic fact is
beyond question."
Kornberg emphasized that it was
the "visibility and credibility as a
Nobel laureate," not the uniqueness of
his views, which led to his selection as
a defense witness. "All of us

(biochemists) without exception
could say the same thing."
Kelly Segraves, director of the
Creation-Science Research Center
(CSRC) in San Diego, filed suit in Jaru
uary 1979, on behalf of his three sons
against the state Board of Education
and other state agencies. In addition
to the First Amendment argument,
the suit charges that excluding dis
cussions of divine creation from sci
ence textbooks discriminates against
the Segraves children on the basis of
their fundamentalist Christian re
ligious beliefs and is in violation of the
equal protection clause of the Four
teenth Amendment and the federal
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The suit goes to trial today before
Sacramento Superior Court Judge
Irvine Perluss and is expected to last
about a week. Deputy Attorney Gener
al Robert Tyler, who is representing
the Board of Education, said there will
be no jury in the trial, adding, "Thank
God for small favors."
Today's trial is the latest skirmish
in a creationist crusade waged since
1962 by Nell Segraves — mother of
plaintiff Kelly — and Jean Sumrall. In
1970, the two women formalized their
creationist activities by founding the
CSRC. which the center's scientific
cordinator Robert Kofahl said is dedi
cated to promoting "programs for re
gaining the constitutional rights of
Christians in the public arena."
In the 1970s the primary public
arena for CSRC was the Curriculum
Advisory Commission of the state
Board of Education. In 1973. after a
four-year effort, the creationists won
a limited victory when the Curriculum
Commission voted not to include
divine creation in the Science
Framework, the state's curriculum
