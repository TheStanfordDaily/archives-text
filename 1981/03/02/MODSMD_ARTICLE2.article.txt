# Stanford prof to testify
## Evolution debate goes to trial 
### Pate Skene 
Three generations of a San Diego
creationist family will appear in Sac
ramento Superior Court today to
argue that Darwinian evolution Is a rfe
ligious construct, not a scientific theo
ry, and that public schools' teaching of
evolution as an established scientific
principle violates the U.S. Constitu
tion's First Amendment prohibition
against a state "establishment of re
ligion."
Stanford biochemist and Nobel
laureate Arthur Kornberg is among
witnesses to be called to defend the
scientific basis of evolutionary theo
ry.
Kornberg said he expects to be

called later in the trial, "possibly
Wednesday," to testify on the basis of
"my experience and conviction that
this (evolution) is a proven set of oper
ations that Is tantamount to a law of
nature." adding that he considers the
principle of Darwinian evolution
"beyond controversy."
"The question," he said, "is wheth
er evolution is controversial... we do
research and can argue about the
mechanisms, but the basic fact is
beyond question."
Kornberg emphasized that it was
the "visibility and credibility as a
Nobel laureate," not the uniqueness of
his views, which led to his selection as
a defense witness. "All of us

(biochemists) without exception
could say the same thing."
Kelly Segraves, director of the
Creation-Science Research Center
(CSRC) in San Diego, filed suit in Jaru
uary 1979, on behalf of his three sons
against the state Board of Education
and other state agencies. In addition
to the First Amendment argument,
the suit charges that excluding dis
cussions of divine creation from sci
ence textbooks discriminates against
the Segraves children on the basis of
their fundamentalist Christian re
ligious beliefs and is in violation of the
equal protection clause of the Four
teenth Amendment and the federal
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The suit goes to trial today before
Sacramento Superior Court Judge
Irvine Perluss and is expected to last
about a week. Deputy Attorney Gener
al Robert Tyler, who is representing
the Board of Education, said there will
be no jury in the trial, adding, "Thank
God for small favors."
Today's trial is the latest skirmish
in a creationist crusade waged since
1962 by Nell Segraves — mother of
plaintiff Kelly — and Jean Sumrall. In
1970, the two women formalized their
creationist activities by founding the
CSRC. which the center's scientific
cordinator Robert Kofahl said is dedi
cated to promoting "programs for re
gaining the constitutional rights of
Christians in the public arena."
In the 1970s the primary public
arena for CSRC was the Curriculum
Advisory Commission of the state
Board of Education. In 1973. after a
four-year effort, the creationists won
a limited victory when the Curriculum
Commission voted not to include
divine creation in the Science
Framework, the state's curriculum
pressed fear that the sudden turn
around "doesn't give much opportuni
ty for public comment."
The benefits of the oil from these
areas are small relative to the damage
oil spills would do to commerical fish
eries. said Grader, who added he was
doubtful the oil companies would take
sufficient care to eliminate the risk of
spills.
"If they keep having such incredible
insensitivity to local public reaction,
they'll soon be in trouble." he said in
reference to administration.
Opposition to Watt's plan is not uni
versal. When asked if the four basins
should be opened up for oil and gas ex
ploration now, Petroleum Engineer
ing Prof. A. J. Horn said, "Absolute
ly "
. "We have a problem of time," said
Horn, who teaches drilling technology
here. "It takes time to find the de
posits, decide whether they're worth
developing, and build the facilities for
offshore production. In San Mateo
County, we're looking at an un
avoidable seven-to-twelve year lag
time before the first oil comes to the
shore that we can use."
"It is morally irresponsible to sit

back and do nothing with our own off
shore areas while raping Third World
deposits to satisfy our own selfish de
sires," Horn said. While admitting the
possibility of a major oil spill. Horn
said such risks are inevitable and are
"a part of life."
"It is vitally important to this coun
try to develop offshore as soon as pos
sible." he explained.
Sierra Club spokeswoman Michele
Perault commented: "We don't buy
this kind of talk, and we won't until
this admistration shows that they
have pursued an aggressive energy
conservation policy. With programs
such as mass transit being cut. we find
it hard to believe in this pressing need
to jeopardize our natural resources
for the sake of a little more energy "
Reached by telephone at Hopkins
Marine Station. Assoc. Biology Prof.
Jonathan Roughgarden said while
drilling itself may have little short
term effect on marine ecology, a
catastrophic oil spill could produce
widespread death at the bottom of the
food chain and have unpredictable
ecological effects. The cumulative ef
fect of many small spills released in
normal operation could have similar
results.

Kornberg emphasized that it was
the "visibility and credibility as a

his views, which led to his selection as

(biochemists) without exception
could say the same thing."
Kelly Segraves, director of the
Creation-Science Research Center
(CSRC) in San Diego, filed suit in Jaru
uary 1979, on behalf of his three sons
against the state Board of Education
and other state agencies. In addition
to the First Amendment argument,
the suit charges that excluding dis
cussions of divine creation from sci
ence textbooks discriminates against
the Segraves children on the basis of
their fundamentalist Christian re
ligious beliefs and is in violation of the
equal protection clause of the Four
teenth Amendment and the federal
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The suit goes to trial today before
Sacramento Superior Court Judge
Irvine Perluss and is expected to last
about a week. Deputy Attorney Gener
al Robert Tyler, who is representing
the Board of Education, said there will
be no jury in the trial, adding, "Thank
God for small favors."
Today's trial is the latest skirmish
in a creationist crusade waged since
1962 by Nell Segraves — mother of
plaintiff Kelly — and Jean Sumrall. In
1970, the two women formalized their
creationist activities by founding the
CSRC. which the center's scientific
cordinator Robert Kofahl said is dedi
cated to promoting "programs for re
gaining the constitutional rights of
Christians in the public arena."
In the 1970s the primary public
arena for CSRC was the Curriculum
Advisory Commission of the state
Board of Education. In 1973. after a
four-year effort, the creationists won
a limited victory when the Curriculum
Commission voted not to include
divine creation in the Science
Framework, the state's curriculum
pressed fear that the sudden turn
around "doesn't give much opportuni
ty for public comment."
The benefits of the oil from these
areas are small relative to the damage
oil spills would do to commerical fish
eries. said Grader, who added he was
doubtful the oil companies would take
sufficient care to eliminate the risk of
spills.
"If they keep having such incredible
insensitivity to local public reaction,
they'll soon be in trouble." he said in
reference to administration.
Opposition to Watt's plan is not uni
versal. When asked if the four basins
should be opened up for oil and gas ex
ploration now, Petroleum Engineer
ing Prof. A. J. Horn said, "Absolute

. "We have a problem of time," said
Horn, who teaches drilling technology
here. "It takes time to find the de
posits, decide whether they're worth
developing, and build the facilities for
offshore production. In San Mateo
County, we're looking at an un
avoidable seven-to-twelve year lag
time before the first oil comes to the
shore that we can use."
"It is morally irresponsible to sit

back and do nothing with our own off
shore areas while raping Third World
deposits to satisfy our own selfish de
sires," Horn said. While admitting the
possibility of a major oil spill. Horn
said such risks are inevitable and are
"a part of life."
"It is vitally important to this coun
try to develop offshore as soon as pos
sible." he explained.
Sierra Club spokeswoman Michele
Perault commented: "We don't buy
this kind of talk, and we won't until
this admistration shows that they
have pursued an aggressive energy
conservation policy. With programs
such as mass transit being cut. we find
it hard to believe in this pressing need
to jeopardize our natural resources
for the sake of a little more energy "
Reached by telephone at Hopkins
Marine Station. Assoc. Biology Prof.
Jonathan Roughgarden said while
drilling itself may have little short
term effect on marine ecology, a
catastrophic oil spill could produce
widespread death at the bottom of the
food chain and have unpredictable
ecological effects. The cumulative ef
fect of many small spills released in
normal operation could have similar
results.
Three generations of a San Diego
creationist family will appear in Sac
ramento Superior Court today to
argue that Darwinian evolution Is a rfe
ligious construct, not a scientific theo
ry, and that public schools' teaching of
evolution as an established scientific
principle violates the U.S. Constitu
tion's First Amendment prohibition
against a state "establishment of re
ligion."
Stanford biochemist and Nobel
laureate Arthur Kornberg is among
witnesses to be called to defend the
scientific basis of evolutionary theo
ry.
Kornberg said he expects to be

called later in the trial, "possibly
Wednesday," to testify on the basis of
"my experience and conviction that
this (evolution) is a proven set of oper
ations that Is tantamount to a law of
nature." adding that he considers the
principle of Darwinian evolution
"beyond controversy."
"The question," he said, "is wheth
er evolution is controversial... we do
research and can argue about the
mechanisms, but the basic fact is
beyond question."
