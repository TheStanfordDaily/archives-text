# Hunts move toward geothermal energy domination
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The Hunt family of Tex
as. accused in the past of trying to corner
the markets in silver and soybeans, once
again is trying to dominate an important
natural resource.
This time the Hunts are in hot water.
Family members have obtained feder
al leases making them the biggest de
velopers of geothermal energy: the
power of Old Faithful and Mount St.
Helens, hot water, steam and blistering
rock trapped below the earth's surface.
Hunt family members, Hunt trusts
and Hunt corporations have staked
claims on roughly one-sixth of all the fed
eral land that has been leased for
geothermal power exploration, Depart
ment of Interior records show.
The Hunts hold 252 of the 1600
geothermal leases issued by the Bureau
of Land Management, which oversees
development of resources on federal
property. The Hunts' leases give them
control over about 480.000 of the 2.9 mil
lion acres of federally leased geothermal
land, according to BLM records.

And they are trying to get still more,
with applications pending to lease 435.000
additional acres.
A little-publicized source of energy,
geothermal power generates much of the
electricity for San Francisco and heats
homes and offices in Boise. It is used"to
dry onions in Nevada and heat green
houses for growing roses in Utah. The hot
springs in Bath County, Va., use
geothermal energy, and an exploratory
well at Crisfield, Md., has shown
geothermal potential.
Geothermal power someday could
supply 10 percent of the nation's energy
needs, the Department of Energy esti
mates.
Many major oil companies — Phillips
Petroleum, Chevron, Occidental Petro
leum, Atlantic Richfield — are getting
into geothermal energy, but the Hunts'
holdings are already three times as big
as any of theirs.
The Hunts have moved into
geothermal energy with the same tech
niques they used in silver and soybeans.
As with silver, once they decided to in
vest the Hunts went in heavily, quickly

making themselves the biggest in the
business. Their purchase of as much sil
ver as the United States consumes in six
months is still being investigated by
three federal agencies, a congressional
committee and a federal grand jury.
As with soybeans, the Hunts evaded
limits on how much geothermal land an
individual can control by obtaining
leases in a dozen different names. A fed
eral judge ruled that all the Hunts' beans
had to be counted together, but the De
partment of Interior says there is noth
ing illegal about splitting geothermal
leases among several family members.
Geothermal is one of two alternative
energies into which America'srichestoil
family is trying to diversify.
The other is gasohol. the blend of grain
alcohol and gasoline.
Until last week, when they abruptly
withdrew their application, the Hunts
were seeking federal subsidies to build
the third-largest fuel alcohol plant in the
United States.
The Hunts pulled back their applica
tion for gasohol loan guarantees after a
House investigations subcommittee

headed by Rep Benjamin S. Rosenthal
(D-N.Y.) began asking questions about
it.
The heads of the Hunt family tangled
with Rosenthal last year, when the same
Commerce consumer and monetary af
fairs subcommittee investigated their
silver dealings. The committee slapped a
contempt of Congress citation on Nelson
Bunker Hunt and his brother. W
Herbert, and withdrew it only after the
two agreed to testify and turn over rec
ords.
The House panel is still pursuing the
Hugts, and has expanded its probe into
other activities of the billionaire Texas
clan, including both the gasohol project
and the geothermal leases.
The Hunts, who shun publicity, did not
respond to inquiries about their interest
in geothermal energy. Calls to the Dallas
law firm that represents the family were
not returned.
Geothermal is an infant energy in
dustry. just as petroleum was when H.L.
Hunt founded what has become an oil
dvnastv.

And they are trying to get still more,
with applications pending to lease 435.000
additional acres.
A little-publicized source of energy,
geothermal power generates much of the
electricity for San Francisco and heats
homes and offices in Boise. It is used"to
dry onions in Nevada and heat green
houses for growing roses in Utah. The hot
springs in Bath County, Va., use
geothermal energy, and an exploratory
well at Crisfield, Md., has shown
geothermal potential.
Geothermal power someday could
supply 10 percent of the nation's energy
needs, the Department of Energy esti
mates.
Many major oil companies — Phillips
Petroleum, Chevron, Occidental Petro
leum, Atlantic Richfield — are getting
into geothermal energy, but the Hunts'
holdings are already three times as big
as any of theirs.
The Hunts have moved into
geothermal energy with the same tech
niques they used in silver and soybeans.
As with silver, once they decided to in
vest the Hunts went in heavily, quickly

making themselves the biggest in the
business. Their purchase of as much sil
ver as the United States consumes in six
months is still being investigated by
three federal agencies, a congressional
committee and a federal grand jury.
As with soybeans, the Hunts evaded
limits on how much geothermal land an
individual can control by obtaining
leases in a dozen different names. A fed
eral judge ruled that all the Hunts' beans
had to be counted together, but the De
partment of Interior says there is noth
ing illegal about splitting geothermal
leases among several family members.
Geothermal is one of two alternative
energies into which America'srichestoil
family is trying to diversify.
The other is gasohol. the blend of grain
alcohol and gasoline.
Until last week, when they abruptly
withdrew their application, the Hunts
were seeking federal subsidies to build
the third-largest fuel alcohol plant in the
United States.
The Hunts pulled back their applica
tion for gasohol loan guarantees after a
House investigations subcommittee

headed by Rep Benjamin S. Rosenthal
(D-N.Y.) began asking questions about
it.
The heads of the Hunt family tangled
with Rosenthal last year, when the same
Commerce consumer and monetary af
fairs subcommittee investigated their
silver dealings. The committee slapped a
contempt of Congress citation on Nelson
Bunker Hunt and his brother. W
Herbert, and withdrew it only after the
two agreed to testify and turn over rec
ords.
The House panel is still pursuing the
Hugts, and has expanded its probe into
other activities of the billionaire Texas
clan, including both the gasohol project
and the geothermal leases.
The Hunts, who shun publicity, did not
respond to inquiries about their interest
in geothermal energy. Calls to the Dallas
law firm that represents the family were
not returned.
Geothermal is an infant energy in
dustry. just as petroleum was when H.L.
Hunt founded what has become an oil
dvnastv.
