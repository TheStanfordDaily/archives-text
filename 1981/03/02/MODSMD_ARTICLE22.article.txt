# Promoting health education
## 
### Cynthia Santana 
She's new to Stanford, new to
California, and heads the newly
instituted Health Program at
Cowell Student Health Center.
Doryn Zenette Davis, as the
name reads on the degrees dis
played on her office wall, is nov
el in her philosophy, methods
and experiences in teaching
health.
"Health education is just a
part of preventive health." said
Davis. "My approach is to go
into the environment and deal
with the system; to change indi
vidual behavior is not sufficient
without addressing the system
that a person is embedded in. It
seems incongruous to ask stu
dents to come into a health cen
ter for preventive health. I see it
necessary to go into the environ
ment where people live, to take
more of an outreach approach."
One of the objectives of the
Health Promotion Program is
to "teach students how to use a
medical care system." said Dr.
James McClenahan. director of
Cowell. who. according to

Davis, was the "prime mover"
in establishing a health educa
tion program at Stanford.
"We needed someone who
knew more than I did and had
the energy to decide what Cow
ell should do or not do in health
education programming." Mc-
Clenahan said, adding that when
advertising for the position, the
job description was left
purposely ambiguous.
Using the results of the 1979
Student Health survey con
ducted by Cowell, Davis and
McClenahan evaluated stu
dents' needs and concerns and
set priorities for Cowell's par
ticipation in meeting those
needs. And according to Mc-
Clenahan. Davis has been "a
one-man-band" in initiating
projects that are "moving along
in a positive way."
— Information - Davis or
ganized publication of "The Stu
dent Body." a newspaper dis
tributed quarterly with per
tinent health information rang
ing from available Cowell ser
vices to the prevention of athlet

ic injuries to editorials on how
to deal with stress and competi
tion.
— Alcohol Misuse - a recurring
problem for which Davis has co
ordinated a committee that
works with individuals and Res
idential Education on such
projects as fraternities and
rush, and with Residential As
sistants (RA's) in the dorms.
— Fitness - Davis is currently
planning a mobile Fitness Eval
uation Facility, a trailer with
moniters to compile a fitness
profile.
— Diet and Nutrition - Davis has
conducted an intense research
project at Branner Hall, testing
ways of supplying nutritional
information and the effect
of that information on meal
selection.
— First Aid - Davis is oversee
ing a project in which 10-minute
training modules that teach
first-aid skills are being de
veloped. The modules will be an
alternative to conducting hours
of certification training.
