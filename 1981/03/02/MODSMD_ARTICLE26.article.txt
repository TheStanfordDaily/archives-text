# Committee seeks discussion:
## Should Stanford limit pass/fail, tighten campus grading practices? 
### 
Following is an interim report of discussions of the
Stanford grading system from the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA) to the
Faculty Senate:
This is an interim report intended to elicit Senate
reaction to C-AAA's recent deliberations on the Stanford
grading system In our deliberations we have addressed
ourselves to three main issues What follows is a summary of
the present stage of our thinking on these issues
1) Deadline for Choosing Pass/Fail (No Credit)
Option: At present, the deadline is during the seventh week
of the quarter There is a consensus on C-AAA that this
deadline should be moved to the third Friday of the quarter
Our reasoning was as follows There are two different
conceptions of the role of the student elected Pass/Fail
Option On one conception it is a fail safe option, available to
the student who has received a clear indication (eg.
through a mid term grade) that he or she is not doing well in a
course On the second conception it makes it easier for a
student to plan at the beginning of the quarter, to take a
course in a new and/or challenging area of the University
without incurring a serious risk of a low grade On this
second conception the Pass/Fail Option is supposed to
encourage the English ma|or to take a physics course or an
engineering student to take a philosophy course
Different deadlines are appropriate for different con
ceptions If the Pass/Fail Option is to play the first role, the
present deadline of the seventh week would be reasonable
But if it is to play only the second role a considerably earlier
deadline would be called for The time period through the
third week of the quarter is sufficient time for a student to
test a course in order to make an assessment whether or not
to elect Pass/Fail
The consensus of the committee was that only the
second role was appropriate Our main reason was that
allowing the Pass/Fail Option to play the first role is bad
pedagogy it encourages students not to take their course
commitments seriously, it makes it rational for students to
engage in elaborate calculations as to how best to
manipulate the system as the seventh week approaches,
and it encourages students to think that skill in manipulating
the system could compensate for mediocre or uneven
academic performance
In addition to being bad pedagogy, our suspicion was that
it also contributes to the idea that every student should have
a transcript composed entirely of A B" and + grades
The net effect is that it' is difficult for external agencies to
make comparative assessments of our students Ac
cordingly. we want to propose that the deadline for declaring
the Pass/Fail Option be moved to the third Friday of the
quarter
Further, we recognize that in 1975 the Faculty Senate
legislated that the Pass/Fail deadline be centrally ad
ministered through the Registrar's Office when necessary
"technical capacity is provided Provision of that technical
capacity has not been feasible in the existing system sup
porting student records, hence, this specific aspect of the
1975 legislation has not been implemented
Nevertheless, we ask whether the educational benefits of
a central administration of the Pass Option outweigh now, in
1981. what may be the burdens of a substantially manual
administration of such a procedure, those burdens being the
addition of the equivalent of two clerks to the Office of the
Registrar and, even with that the prospect of a one to two
day delay in the posting of grades received as faculty
submissions are reviewed against authorized Pass Option
listings
2) The Drop Deadline and the "Historical" record: At
present a student may formally drop a course up to the final
examination Informally, students seem to think that they can
drop a course, or at least get a No Credit, which amounts to
the same thing, just by not turning in a final examination
This again seems to us bad pedagogy. It seems to teach
students that when you do something badly you can just drop
it without incurring any real penalty
Another less important, but nontrivial, consideration is
that this late drop deadline leads to much duplication of
effort, as students retake courses in the hopes of parlaying
what would have been a lower grade into a higher one
There are probably also considerations of fairness here
for it seems likely that the present deadline unfairly benefits
those who can afford to stay around longer until they have
done well in a particular course
Finally, there is probably a danger of grade inflation, as
the late deadline encourages a strategy of dropping a course
rather than risking a low grade
For these reasons we want to propose an earlier, cen
trally administered deadline lor dropping a course, perhaps
during the seventh week of the quarter The problem is that
this change would have no real significance within the
present grading system A student could still simply not turn
in a final examination, fail the course, and receive a No
Credit which would not appear on his or her transcript
For an earlier drop deadline to be significant we would
need to return to a historical transcript on which failing
grades and unauthorized withdrawals were included (Most
major American research universities continue to have such
historical transcripts ) This would be a maior change in our
grading system, and would require extremely careful and
thorough consideration Does the Senate of the Academic
Council wish to instruct C AAA to pursue this issue 9
3) A—B Grade Distributions: Our main concerns
about the Pass/Fail and Drop Deadlines have focused on

of course, grades and transcripts also serve a serious ex
temal function, for they are used by graduate and
professional schools, and others, to make important
decisions about our students And here is where present
practices in awarding A sand B's are unsettling
Data presented by C AAA in its annual 1979 80 report
suggest that throughout a 10 year period approximately 70
percent of the grades awarded were either A or Band
(even recently during periods of discussion of grading
patterns) more than half of these were A
One result of such a high percentage of A grades is that it
becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish the exceptional
from the good student on the basis of the Iranscript
Prof Ja'ck Friedenthal—who is presently in charge of
admissions in the Law School —provided us with a good
example of this problem Of Stanford students who took
recent Law School Aptitude Tests.-34 percent had a GPA of
3 6 or higher (This GPA is computed by the testing service
Stanford does not presently compute a GPA ) This means
that more than one-third of these Stanford students have
GPA s (hat are bunched in a rather narrow range
Such bunching at the top makes it very difficult for law
schools to make decisions on the basis of the transcript So
there is increasing reliance on scores on the Law School
Aptitude Tests This is unsettling for a variety of reasons
primarily because such reliance on LSAT scores means
greater weight is being placed on a one day test than on four
years of accomplishment reflected by the transcript

This bunching at the top may also have an impact on the
educational atmosphere at Stanford It a student's GPA. is.
say. 3 35 rather than 3 6. it would be in the bottom hall of
GPA s for those Stanford students who took the LSAT during
the past three years, making admission to an excellent law
school very unlikely So a Stanford student who wants to go
to law school will be encouraged to play a careful game,
making correct guesses as to which courses to take
Pass/Fail and which to drop, so as to avoid too many grades
below an A
Our reflections on this problem are still in a preliminary
stage Changing the Pass/Fail and Drop deadlines along the
lines sketched in 1) and 2) probably would have some minor
impact on this problem
Perhaps an upper limit on the number of elective pass
units that a student can count toward the 180 units required
for the AB/BS would be effective
The 1979-80 C-AAA report suggests that faculty b<?
encouraged to apply grades literally, treating A as ex
ceptionai and B as superior" in addition, the Senate
might wish to institute guidelines regarding the distribution of
letter grades in larger undergraduate classes
Wider dissemination to individual faculty members not
merely of quarterly grade distribution information, but of
comparative data regarding their own classes over time
might be useful
Finally. C AAA has asked that the Registrar periodically
remind faculty that " + and grade modifiers can be
used to make finer distinctions regarding student ac
complishment and that these distinctions do affect GPA s as
they are computed by outside agencies

Following is an interim report of discussions of the
Stanford grading system from the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA) to the
Faculty Senate:
This is an interim report intended to elicit Senate
reaction to C-AAA's recent deliberations on the Stanford
grading system In our deliberations we have addressed
ourselves to three main issues What follows is a summary of
the present stage of our thinking on these issues
1) Deadline for Choosing Pass/Fail (No Credit)
Option: At present, the deadline is during the seventh week
of the quarter There is a consensus on C-AAA that this
deadline should be moved to the third Friday of the quarter
Our reasoning was as follows There are two different
conceptions of the role of the student elected Pass/Fail
Option On one conception it is a fail safe option, available to
the student who has received a clear indication (eg.
through a mid term grade) that he or she is not doing well in a
course On the second conception it makes it easier for a
student to plan at the beginning of the quarter, to take a
course in a new and/or challenging area of the University
without incurring a serious risk of a low grade On this
second conception the Pass/Fail Option is supposed to
encourage the English ma|or to take a physics course or an
engineering student to take a philosophy course
Different deadlines are appropriate for different con
ceptions If the Pass/Fail Option is to play the first role, the
present deadline of the seventh week would be reasonable
But if it is to play only the second role a considerably earlier
deadline would be called for The time period through the
third week of the quarter is sufficient time for a student to
test a course in order to make an assessment whether or not
to elect Pass/Fail
The consensus of the committee was that only the
second role was appropriate Our main reason was that
allowing the Pass/Fail Option to play the first role is bad
pedagogy it encourages students not to take their course
commitments seriously, it makes it rational for students to
engage in elaborate calculations as to how best to
manipulate the system as the seventh week approaches,
and it encourages students to think that skill in manipulating
the system could compensate for mediocre or uneven
academic performance
In addition to being bad pedagogy, our suspicion was that
it also contributes to the idea that every student should have
a transcript composed entirely of A B" and + grades
The net effect is that it' is difficult for external agencies to
make comparative assessments of our students Ac
cordingly. we want to propose that the deadline for declaring
the Pass/Fail Option be moved to the third Friday of the
quarter
Further, we recognize that in 1975 the Faculty Senate
legislated that the Pass/Fail deadline be centrally ad
ministered through the Registrar's Office when necessary
"technical capacity is provided Provision of that technical
capacity has not been feasible in the existing system sup
porting student records, hence, this specific aspect of the
1975 legislation has not been implemented
Nevertheless, we ask whether the educational benefits of
a central administration of the Pass Option outweigh now, in
1981. what may be the burdens of a substantially manual
administration of such a procedure, those burdens being the
addition of the equivalent of two clerks to the Office of the
Registrar and, even with that the prospect of a one to two
day delay in the posting of grades received as faculty
submissions are reviewed against authorized Pass Option
listings
2) The Drop Deadline and the "Historical" record: At
present a student may formally drop a course up to the final
examination Informally, students seem to think that they can
drop a course, or at least get a No Credit, which amounts to
the same thing, just by not turning in a final examination
This again seems to us bad pedagogy. It seems to teach
students that when you do something badly you can just drop
it without incurring any real penalty
Another less important, but nontrivial, consideration is
that this late drop deadline leads to much duplication of
effort, as students retake courses in the hopes of parlaying
what would have been a lower grade into a higher one
There are probably also considerations of fairness here
for it seems likely that the present deadline unfairly benefits
those who can afford to stay around longer until they have
done well in a particular course
Finally, there is probably a danger of grade inflation, as
the late deadline encourages a strategy of dropping a course
rather than risking a low grade
For these reasons we want to propose an earlier, cen
trally administered deadline lor dropping a course, perhaps
during the seventh week of the quarter The problem is that
this change would have no real significance within the
present grading system A student could still simply not turn
in a final examination, fail the course, and receive a No
Credit which would not appear on his or her transcript
For an earlier drop deadline to be significant we would
need to return to a historical transcript on which failing
grades and unauthorized withdrawals were included (Most
major American research universities continue to have such
historical transcripts ) This would be a maior change in our
grading system, and would require extremely careful and
thorough consideration Does the Senate of the Academic
Council wish to instruct C AAA to pursue this issue 9
3) A—B Grade Distributions: Our main concerns
about the Pass/Fail and Drop Deadlines have focused on

of course, grades and transcripts also serve a serious ex
temal function, for they are used by graduate and
professional schools, and others, to make important
decisions about our students And here is where present
practices in awarding A sand B's are unsettling
Data presented by C AAA in its annual 1979 80 report
suggest that throughout a 10 year period approximately 70
percent of the grades awarded were either A or Band
(even recently during periods of discussion of grading
patterns) more than half of these were A
One result of such a high percentage of A grades is that it
becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish the exceptional
from the good student on the basis of the Iranscript
Prof Ja'ck Friedenthal—who is presently in charge of
admissions in the Law School —provided us with a good
example of this problem Of Stanford students who took
recent Law School Aptitude Tests.-34 percent had a GPA of
3 6 or higher (This GPA is computed by the testing service
Stanford does not presently compute a GPA ) This means
that more than one-third of these Stanford students have
GPA s (hat are bunched in a rather narrow range
Such bunching at the top makes it very difficult for law
schools to make decisions on the basis of the transcript So
there is increasing reliance on scores on the Law School
Aptitude Tests This is unsettling for a variety of reasons
primarily because such reliance on LSAT scores means
greater weight is being placed on a one day test than on four
years of accomplishment reflected by the transcript

Following is an interim report of discussions of the
Stanford grading system from the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA) to the
Faculty Senate:
This is an interim report intended to elicit Senate
reaction to C-AAA's recent deliberations on the Stanford
grading system In our deliberations we have addressed
ourselves to three main issues What follows is a summary of
the present stage of our thinking on these issues
1) Deadline for Choosing Pass/Fail (No Credit)
Option: At present, the deadline is during the seventh week
of the quarter There is a consensus on C-AAA that this
deadline should be moved to the third Friday of the quarter
Our reasoning was as follows There are two different
conceptions of the role of the student elected Pass/Fail
Option On one conception it is a fail safe option, available to
the student who has received a clear indication (eg.
through a mid term grade) that he or she is not doing well in a
course On the second conception it makes it easier for a
student to plan at the beginning of the quarter, to take a
course in a new and/or challenging area of the University
without incurring a serious risk of a low grade On this
second conception the Pass/Fail Option is supposed to
encourage the English ma|or to take a physics course or an
engineering student to take a philosophy course
Different deadlines are appropriate for different con
ceptions If the Pass/Fail Option is to play the first role, the
present deadline of the seventh week would be reasonable
But if it is to play only the second role a considerably earlier
deadline would be called for The time period through the
third week of the quarter is sufficient time for a student to
test a course in order to make an assessment whether or not
to elect Pass/Fail
The consensus of the committee was that only the
second role was appropriate Our main reason was that
allowing the Pass/Fail Option to play the first role is bad
pedagogy it encourages students not to take their course
commitments seriously, it makes it rational for students to
engage in elaborate calculations as to how best to
manipulate the system as the seventh week approaches,
and it encourages students to think that skill in manipulating
the system could compensate for mediocre or uneven
academic performance
In addition to being bad pedagogy, our suspicion was that
it also contributes to the idea that every student should have
a transcript composed entirely of A B" and + grades
The net effect is that it' is difficult for external agencies to
make comparative assessments of our students Ac
cordingly. we want to propose that the deadline for declaring
the Pass/Fail Option be moved to the third Friday of the
quarter
Further, we recognize that in 1975 the Faculty Senate
legislated that the Pass/Fail deadline be centrally ad
ministered through the Registrar's Office when necessary
"technical capacity is provided Provision of that technical
capacity has not been feasible in the existing system sup
porting student records, hence, this specific aspect of the
1975 legislation has not been implemented
Nevertheless, we ask whether the educational benefits of
a central administration of the Pass Option outweigh now, in
1981. what may be the burdens of a substantially manual
administration of such a procedure, those burdens being the
addition of the equivalent of two clerks to the Office of the
Registrar and, even with that the prospect of a one to two
day delay in the posting of grades received as faculty
submissions are reviewed against authorized Pass Option
listings
2) The Drop Deadline and the "Historical" record: At
present a student may formally drop a course up to the final
examination Informally, students seem to think that they can
drop a course, or at least get a No Credit, which amounts to
the same thing, just by not turning in a final examination
This again seems to us bad pedagogy. It seems to teach
students that when you do something badly you can just drop
it without incurring any real penalty
Another less important, but nontrivial, consideration is
that this late drop deadline leads to much duplication of
effort, as students retake courses in the hopes of parlaying
what would have been a lower grade into a higher one
There are probably also considerations of fairness here
for it seems likely that the present deadline unfairly benefits
those who can afford to stay around longer until they have
done well in a particular course
Finally, there is probably a danger of grade inflation, as
the late deadline encourages a strategy of dropping a course
rather than risking a low grade
For these reasons we want to propose an earlier, cen
trally administered deadline lor dropping a course, perhaps
during the seventh week of the quarter The problem is that
this change would have no real significance within the
present grading system A student could still simply not turn
in a final examination, fail the course, and receive a No
Credit which would not appear on his or her transcript
For an earlier drop deadline to be significant we would
need to return to a historical transcript on which failing
grades and unauthorized withdrawals were included (Most
major American research universities continue to have such
historical transcripts ) This would be a maior change in our
grading system, and would require extremely careful and
thorough consideration Does the Senate of the Academic
Council wish to instruct C AAA to pursue this issue 9
