Tonight, the Stanford women's basketball
team finishes the season against California
Win or lose, the Cards are losing a lot. It will
be senior forward Kathv Murphy's last game
Five years ago, Stanford hired Dotty
MeCrea as head coach. One year later. MeCrea
started a recruiting program for women's
basketball For the next three years Stanford
qualified for the WAI AW regionals There is no
doubt in anyone's mind that McCrea's recruit
ing made Stanford a regional contender.
Murphy was the beginning of that recruiting
program.
"Kathv was the first women's basketball
player to receive an athletic scholarship," said
MeCrea. "She is the foundation upon which to
day's team is built."
As the first recruit, Murphy felt awkward.
"I felt I had to put out 100 percent and
more every game. I was the only one receiving
a scholarship, and I felt I had to prove myself ."
Murphy's performances as a freshman
amazed everyone, and they included a career
high against UC-Davis of 30 points. She fol
lowed this with an amazing 20 rebounds against
Cal Poly-Pomona the following year. As
McCrea's recruiting efforts became more and
more successful. Murphy was no longer the
team superstar: rather she became an integral
part of a well-balanced organization. This
year. Murphy didn't contribute with high
games of 30 points, but by being "a leader on
the court." according to MeCrea. "She's a
strong, intense, and intelligent player, as well
as being a fine individual."
Murphy sees her strengths as being."My de

fensive game — I've been working on that as
lot lately. Also. I've been improving my re
bounding and my inside play."
"Scholarships definitely improve the
caliber of player that Stanford can attract."
Murphy said. "You have to pay people to come
here, because every place else is offering to."
Murphy's athletic scholarship covered tuition
as long as she continued to try out for the team.
Basketball takes up about three hours a day,
according to Murphy. Keeping up in her
classes has not been a problem, except "when
we take road trips in winter quarter and you
miss a week of class — it takes you another
week just to catch up."
So has Stanford found the perfect balance be
tween academic and extra-curricular life?
Murphy seems to think so. "I can't imagine
what people that weren't involoved in some ac
tivity very heavily would do with their free
time." she said.
Murphy thinks she'll stay in basketball, by
"playing in a rec league or may be even
coaching I don't think I'd like coaching as my
career, but it would be fun to try."
Murphy is a biology major, and is hoping to
be accepted into veterinary school."lf I'm not
accepted. I'll probably work towards a Mas
ters degree in pharmacology," she said." If af
ter re-applying to vet school I don't get in, I
might work in the pharmaceutics industry."
No matter what the vet schools think.
Murphy is loved by her teammates and
coaches. MeCrea said,"Kathy has been a very
important part of this team to all of us, and
we'll miss her."
