# Comeback bid thwarted
## Stanford cagers bitten by Wildcats 
### Chris Haft 
Tucson, Ariz. — In the
penultimate game of their
men's basketball season, it was
sickening but fitting that the
Stanford Cardinals experienced
close to the ultimate in frustra
tion.
Wildcat guard John Smith's
steal and last-second layin ru
ined Stanford's bid to force an
overtime and ended the agony
for the Cards, who lost. 73-69,
before 8829 fans at McKale Cen
ter and a regional television au
dience Saturday afternoon.
The Cards, who end their sea
son this Saturday against Cali
fornia at Maples Pavilion, suf
fered disappointment after dis
appointment in dropping their
18th game in 26 tries.
Aborted comeback
Stanford's frantic but insuffi
cient last-minute comeback was
particularly excruciating.
Trailing 71-65 following Rus
sell Brown's two free throws
with 42 seconds left. Stanford's
inconceivable hopes to at least
tie the Wildcats by the end of
regulation soared briefly. After
John Revelli scored with 20 sec
onds left to make it 71-67. Roger

Lemons and Doug Marty
trapped Smith in the backcourt.
Smith tried to bounce the ball
out of bounds off Lemons — a
tricky but usually effective tac
tic that all self-respecting
basketball players learn on the
playgrounds — but it instead ri
cocheted out off Smith himself,
giving possession back to Stan
ford with 17 seconds to go.
Marty sank a 15-footer five
seconds later, bringing the
Cards within two. With 11 sec
onds left Lemons fouled Brown,
who missed the first of a one
and-one. Peter Lallas re
bounded the miss for Stanford
and headed upcourt. Near half
court he tried to pass, but Brown
deflected the ball to Smith, who
romped away from everybody
and-scored as the final horn
sounded.
Decisive turnovers
Yet Card head coach Dick
Dißiaso labeled not Stanford's
final turnover but an earlier
series of giveaways as the de
cisive factor.
After Brian Welch's foul-line
jumper with 18:34 to go put
Stanford down by one. 43-42. the
Cards committed turnovers on

five of their next six possessions
and missed the only shot they
took.
Meanwhile, Arizona extended
its advantage to 49-42 on a Smith
basket, Robbie Dosty's alley
oop layup off Brown's pass and
freshman guard Jeff Collins'
steal and slam-dunk.
More than 16 minutes re
mained by the time the Cards
righted themselves, but their
chances had already been seri
ously damaged, said Dißiaso.
' 'The major point of the game
was not catching up, it was get
ting behind," the sixth-year
coach stated. "We said at half
time that one of the two teams
would make a run. . .from there
on in we had to play catch-up."
The Cards played catch-up
quite well, reducing a 57-49 defi
cit to 64-62 in six minutes. Marty
sank two free throws with 4:44
to go to climax Stanford's surge.
Elusive rebounds
But soon Stanford endured
more frustration. Twice they
failed to rebound missed free
throws, thus losing both time
and scoring opportunities.
With Arizona leading 66-64

and 2:00 left. Welch fouled
Smith, who made his first free
throw but missed the second.
The rebound, however, went
past the Cards stationed under
neath the basket and was
grabbed by Wildcat center
Frank Smith.
Marty immediately fouled
Brown. Brown missed the first
of a one-and-one, but again the
long rebound eluded all Cards,
falling instead into Dosty's
grasp.
"We did what we wanted to —
we got the man to the line," said
Dißiaso, who couldn't count on
the ball's fickle bounces.
Jones sits out
Unfortunately for the Cards,
they also couldn't count on the
contributions of freshman
guard Keith Jones. The Phoe
nix, Ariz, native had an un
pleasant homecoming, suffer
ing a badly bruised right toe
Thursday night when Arizona
State's 7-foot, 240-lb. Alton
Lister landed on it. Jones
watched Saturday's game in his
streetclothes. to the relief of at
least one Wildcat.
"Jones is tough," John Smith
nsaid. "He would have made us
play harder."
Dißiaso said Jones' foot had

been X-rayed and that the 6-
foot-2 flash would probably be
able to practice again Wednes
day.
Welch also received an in
jury, hurting the fingers on his
right hand when he collided with
Ron Davis and fell to the floor.
Like Jones, Welch ought to be
ready for the Cal game.
Impressive efforts
Several Cards distinguished
themselves in defeat. Revelli
scored 12 points to become the
school's all-time leader for
points scored as a freshman,
surpassing Kimberly Belton's
1976-77 mark. Revelli's total of
348 exceeds Belton's 337.
Welch, who had scored 26, 25
and 24 points in his last three
games against Arizona, notched
22 more thanks mostly to 9-
for-14 shooting.
Marty, probably trying to
compensate for Jones' absence,
fired in a collegiate career-high
17 points.
Wichary also established a
career high by grabbing 12 re
bounds. In addition, the 6-foot-9
forward hit all of his five shots
from the floor. Wichary has
netted 35 of his last 53 shots (66
percent) over the last seven
games.

final turnover but an earlier
series of giveaways as the de
cisive factor.
After Brian Welch's foul-line
jumper with 18:34 to go put
Stanford down by one. 43-42. the
Cards committed turnovers on

five of their next six possessions
and missed the only shot they
took.
Meanwhile, Arizona extended
its advantage to 49-42 on a Smith
basket, Robbie Dosty's alley
oop layup off Brown's pass and
freshman guard Jeff Collins'
steal and slam-dunk.
More than 16 minutes re
mained by the time the Cards
righted themselves, but their
chances had already been seri
ously damaged, said Dißiaso.
' 'The major point of the game
was not catching up, it was get
ting behind," the sixth-year
coach stated. "We said at half
time that one of the two teams
would make a run. . .from there
on in we had to play catch-up."
The Cards played catch-up
quite well, reducing a 57-49 defi
cit to 64-62 in six minutes. Marty
sank two free throws with 4:44
to go to climax Stanford's surge.
Elusive rebounds
But soon Stanford endured
more frustration. Twice they
failed to rebound missed free
throws, thus losing both time
and scoring opportunities.
With Arizona leading 66-64

and 2:00 left. Welch fouled
Smith, who made his first free
throw but missed the second.
The rebound, however, went
past the Cards stationed under
neath the basket and was
grabbed by Wildcat center
Frank Smith.
Marty immediately fouled
Brown. Brown missed the first
of a one-and-one, but again the
long rebound eluded all Cards,
falling instead into Dosty's
grasp.
"We did what we wanted to —
we got the man to the line," said
Dißiaso, who couldn't count on
the ball's fickle bounces.
Jones sits out
Unfortunately for the Cards,
they also couldn't count on the
contributions of freshman
guard Keith Jones. The Phoe
nix, Ariz, native had an un
pleasant homecoming, suffer
ing a badly bruised right toe
Thursday night when Arizona
State's 7-foot, 240-lb. Alton
Lister landed on it. Jones
watched Saturday's game in his
streetclothes. to the relief of at
least one Wildcat.
"Jones is tough," John Smith
nsaid. "He would have made us
play harder."
Dißiaso said Jones' foot had

been X-rayed and that the 6-
foot-2 flash would probably be
able to practice again Wednes
day.
Welch also received an in
jury, hurting the fingers on his
right hand when he collided with
Ron Davis and fell to the floor.
Like Jones, Welch ought to be
ready for the Cal game.
Impressive efforts
Several Cards distinguished
themselves in defeat. Revelli
scored 12 points to become the
school's all-time leader for
points scored as a freshman,
surpassing Kimberly Belton's
1976-77 mark. Revelli's total of
348 exceeds Belton's 337.
Welch, who had scored 26, 25
and 24 points in his last three
games against Arizona, notched
22 more thanks mostly to 9-
for-14 shooting.
Marty, probably trying to
compensate for Jones' absence,
fired in a collegiate career-high
17 points.
Wichary also established a
career high by grabbing 12 re
bounds. In addition, the 6-foot-9
forward hit all of his five shots
from the floor. Wichary has
netted 35 of his last 53 shots (66
percent) over the last seven
games.
Tucson, Ariz. — In the
penultimate game of their
men's basketball season, it was
sickening but fitting that the
Stanford Cardinals experienced
close to the ultimate in frustra
tion.
Wildcat guard John Smith's
steal and last-second layin ru
ined Stanford's bid to force an
overtime and ended the agony
for the Cards, who lost. 73-69,
before 8829 fans at McKale Cen
ter and a regional television au
dience Saturday afternoon.
The Cards, who end their sea
son this Saturday against Cali
fornia at Maples Pavilion, suf
fered disappointment after dis
appointment in dropping their
18th game in 26 tries.
Aborted comeback
Stanford's frantic but insuffi
cient last-minute comeback was
particularly excruciating.
Trailing 71-65 following Rus
sell Brown's two free throws
with 42 seconds left. Stanford's
inconceivable hopes to at least
tie the Wildcats by the end of
regulation soared briefly. After
John Revelli scored with 20 sec
onds left to make it 71-67. Roger

Lemons and Doug Marty
trapped Smith in the backcourt.
Smith tried to bounce the ball
out of bounds off Lemons — a
tricky but usually effective tac
tic that all self-respecting
basketball players learn on the
playgrounds — but it instead ri
cocheted out off Smith himself,
giving possession back to Stan
ford with 17 seconds to go.
Marty sank a 15-footer five
seconds later, bringing the
Cards within two. With 11 sec
onds left Lemons fouled Brown,
who missed the first of a one
and-one. Peter Lallas re
bounded the miss for Stanford
and headed upcourt. Near half
court he tried to pass, but Brown
deflected the ball to Smith, who
romped away from everybody
and-scored as the final horn
sounded.
