## Cards whip Broncs 
### Bill Beyda 
The Stanford women's
basketball team defeated the
Santa Clara Broncos 61-58 Fri
day night, after being down by
eleven points twice in the sec
ond half. This is the second
game in a row the Cards have
shown the ability to come from
behind; they were down by eight
points with 1:20 left against
USF Tuesday night and forced
the game to two overtimes
before losing at the buzzer.
"The ability to come from be
hind is the mark of a good
team," Stanford assistant
coach Mike Kehoe said, "We've
been concentrating on our de
fense. and putting pressure on
the ball, and it's been working."
Stanford was down by seven
points at the start of the second
half. Santa Clara scored the
first two baskets, increasing the
margin to 11 points. After pull
ing within three points, the
Cards once again fell behind by
11 points.
Mounting another comeback
attempt, the Cards tied the
game with a little under four
minutes to go. Denise McGuire
sank two free throws with a
minute to go to give the Cards a
60-58 lead, and Siobhan Hathorn
sank an insurance free throw in
the final seconds, to give the
team a 61-58 lead.
"The difference in the game
was our free throw shooting,'
Kehoe said. "We outscored

them by ten points in the second
half, and scored 13 out of 16 from
the line." Poor free throw shoot
ing lost the double overtime
game against USF for the
Cards.
"Against USF. we made a
dramatic comeback effort, but
fell just short." Kehoe said.
"But against Santa Clara, we
stayed in there until the very
end."
The Cards were led by Kim
Kupferer with 21 points, and
Louise Smith with 15 points.
They have always been able to
score points; it's their improved
defense that is winning games.
The Cardinals finish the sea
son against NorCal Conference
leader UC-Berkeley tonight at
Maples Pavilion at 7:30 PM. The
Golden Bears have an overall
record of 20-7. and a conference
record of 9-2. One of those two
losses was to Stanford two
weeks ago. when the Cardinals
out-hustled, out-defensed, and
outscored the Bears for a 73-72
win.
Will the Cards be able to pull
out another upset victory over
highly touted Cal? "We're going
to stick with our pressure de
fense," Kehoe said, "The game
is going to be won in the
trenches; it will be a classic Cal-
Stanford meeting."
The Santa Clara win evens up
the Cards overall record at
15-15, and ups their NorCal Con
ference record to 5-6.
