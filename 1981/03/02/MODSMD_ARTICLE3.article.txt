# Berkeley considers return to semesters

UC-Berkeley. currently on a quarter system, will return to a semester calen
dar in the autumn of 1983 if the university board of regents approves finalized
plans for the new system, according to that campus's Public Information Of
ficer Rav Colzig. UC-Berkelev abandoned the semester calendar in the late
19605.
The UC-Berkeley Academic Senate there voted to return to the semester
calender before, but it wasn't until this year that the president of University of
California, David Saxon notified the Berkeley Campus that he wouldn't object
to reinstating the semester system and would in fact make recommendations
for this plan to the board of regents, said Colvig.
"Although plans to convert to the semester calendar are very active, the
final decision has not been made." said Colvig. He said first the academic sen
ate must approve the plan and submit their ideas for converting the courses to
fit the new calendar. The board of regents must then give their vote of approval.
According to Colvig. Chancellor Michael Hey man. favors the schedule
change. Heyman thinks it is "a wise move at this time." said Colvig.
Colvig said the reasons behind the scheduling change are related to education
and economics. He said the main reason for the change is the faculty contention
that ten weeks isn't sufficient time in which to teach a course. He said the style
and format of education at Berkeley is better suited to semesters.
The other major reason behind the schedule change according to Colvig is the
savings in manpower and academic work which results from a semester calen
dar. With two instead of three finals and registration periods, one-third of the
paper work would be cut down. With over 30,000 students there is an "enormous
amount of paperwork," and the savings would be "considerable," he said.
Under the new schedule class credits will have to be revised, new syllabi de
signed, and catalogs and course descriptions made, said Colvig.
Colvig said a poll is being taken by the Associated Students at UC-Berkeley in
order to measure student reaction When the poll was taken a few years ago, the
student reaction to a Semester calendar was mixed.
Berkeley once operated under the semester system. Colvig said external rea
sons in the '60s impelled the university to switch to a quarter system. The public
institutions in California include universities, colleges and community col
leges California system officials decided to adopt a uniform calendar which
would provide year-round education Interested students could thus attend
school year round and complete their education in three years, while staff and
buildings would be used more fully, said Colvig.
Colvig said Berkeley is the only state campus actively planning to return to
the semester system. Others may decide to follow. Some schools are looking
to the pros and cons of the change, Colvig said.
Stanford has also discussed returning to the semester calendar, which they
used before the 19205, said Robert Houghton, associate registrar.
Houghton said the question regarding the desirability of quarters and semes
ters comes up every ten years. "There is a big discussion. The administration
has decided that quarters are best." said Houghton.
He said the question of semesters involves whether the first semester should
begin in August and finish before Christmas, or continue to use the present
calendar and finish the semester after Christmas vacation.
Houghton said students object to finishing after Christmas. Many others are
opposed to returning to school before Labor Day as they have commitments to
summer employment, he said
Among the faculty the question is also split, he said. "There is a faculty break
between scientists, who like quarters, and the humanists who prefer two se
mesters," said Houghton.
