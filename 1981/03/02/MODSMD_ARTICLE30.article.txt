The Stanford men's golf team
showed what they have in the
way of potential, but also in ex
perience, at the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate tournament this
weekend, held in Ontario. Cali
fornia. Though they eventually
finished ninth of 14 teams, the
Cardinals were in second place
after the first round.
Fresno State led the tour
nament after the first day of
play, with Stanford only one
shot back, holding seven and 10
stroke advantages over third
place ASU, and fourth place
USC, respectively. But what
head coach David Yates de
scribed as a "very, very medi
ocre second round" virtually de
stroyed Stanford's chances of
winning the team cham
pionship.
Second or third place was not
impossible however, going into
the the third day. The young
Cardinal team was unable to

handle the pressure, though, ex
hibiting an overall lack of con
centration throughout the
round. "It was like walking up a
greased hill," Yates said. "For
every step forward we took
three backwards."
Stanford finished with a team
score of 1129. David Games shot
the low individual mark with a
54 hole total of 225, followed bv
Neil Robinson and Doug Thomp
son with 226, Lew Dickey with
228, and Tad Buchanan with 229.
Team captain Jack Skilling shot
a total of 237.
Inexperience marked the
Cardinals' play after the first
day. Members of the team set
scores that they planned to
shoot the night before the sec
ond round, and then seemed un
able to recover when things
didn't go as planned. "They got
caught up with picking num
bers," Yates said. "One guy
was going to shoot 68, ano'ther
69. and vou can't do that."
