## 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's gymnastics squads
are in the homestretch of their
seasons and had hoped to
emerge from Friday night's
meet neck-and-neck with the
competition — the men in the
Pac-10 Derby and the women in
the WAIAW Regional
Sweepstakes. While performing
well against the visiting Arizona
Wildcats, the Cardinals found
themselves still a nose behind
their respective front-runners.
In the men's half of the meet,
Stanford evened its record at 4-4
overall, and dropped to 1-4 in
conference match-ups, out
scored 260.75 to 256.20.
"We beat them in floor ex
ercise. rings and parallel bars
and were very close to them in
vaulting and high bar." said
Cardinal head coach Sadao
Hamada. "We were just killed
on pommel horse — a team
score of only 37 points, almost
four points worse than they did.

That pretty much determined
the meet."
Scores among the top fin
ishers were quite close, includ
ing several ties. In floor ex
ercise, only two tenths of a point
separated first and third place,
with Arizona's Andy Pacho
claiming top honors (9.20),
while Cards Bob Maganini and
Jeff Chung were second (9.10)
and third (9.00) respectively.
Still closer were the vaulters,
as a mere tenth spelled the dif
ference between first and third.
Kim Bird of Arizona was tops
with 9.55, followed by Stanford's
Bob Daniel (9.50) and Wildcats
Bob Jensen and Pacho tying for
third with 9.45. In high bar, only
Mike Lee's third-place tie (9.25 )
prevented an Arizona sweep of
the top spots.
Daniel won the rings event for
the Cards with a 9.25 routine,
finishing ahead of Arizona's
Gino Del Frate (9.00), while

Stanford's rings specialist
Craig Goldman tied with Doug
Thompson in third place with
8.90. Stanford fared well in par
allel bars, not usually one of the
Cards' stronger events, with
Brian Nelson copping first
(9.10), Thompson second at 8.95
and Lee with 8.75. As with high
bar. Lee was the Card's lone fin
isher in the top four of pommel
horse competition, tying with
Thompson for second at 9.20.
Bylin captured first with 9.40
and George Herget was fourth
with 8.25.
In the all-around standings,
Lee's 53.65 total was good for
first, ahead of Thompson (52.15)
and Bylin (50.75).
As expected, Jackie Walker's
women defeated their guests to
raise their season record to 6-5.
Stanford 0 recorded a clean
sweep of all-around in the 139.45
to 129.80 victory, paced by
Merilyn Chapman's 36.40 show

ing. Julie Bledsoe was runner
up with 34.70 and Karen Hall
was third with 34.40.
"Overall. I was pleased."
Walker said, "but we've got to
get close to 140 if we're going to
get close to nationals — we need
more of a 'cushion.' Julie had
her best meet of the year and so
did Caryn Lucido. including her
highest bar score and one of her
best beam and floor exercise
routines. She (Lucido) also had
her highest all-around score,
32.70."
In addition to dominating the
all-around totals. Stanford out
scored Arizona in all four events
and swept the top three places in
three of them. Bledsoe won the
vaulting event with a 9.20 aver
age. followed by Anne Smith
(9.05) and Chapman (8.95). Oa
balance beam, Chapman took
top honors with 9.20 while
1 ncido was runner-up (8 35) and
H;'' finished third (8.25).
