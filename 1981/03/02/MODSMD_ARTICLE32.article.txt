### Steve Odell 
The Stanford men's baseball team traveled to Fullerton
this weekend, expecting some Southern California sunshine, a
three-game series, and a chance to improve their ranking and
prepare for the Pac-10 season with a good performance
against number two-rated Fullerton
Instead, they only got the latter of the three, as they beat
Fullerton on Friday. 6-3 Their doubleheader scheduled for
Saturday was cancelled due to heavy rainfall.
"I was very pleased with the game," remarked head coach
Mark Marquess. "Especially considering the fact that we
were playing them down there."
Senior righthander Paul Grame picked up the victory, up
ping his record to 5-1 as he went six innings, allowing eight
hits and walking two. "It' was a pretty big win for me,"
Grame said "It showed that I could beat a pretty good team,
even though I did not have tremendous stuff."
Rookie Gregg Lomnicky picked up the save, shutting out
Fullerton over the final three frames.
CSF got a quick 2-0 lead in the first inning, but the Cards
battled back, tying it at 3-all. Stanford got the lead for good in
the seventh when John Elway walked in the winning run with
the bases loaded.
The Cardinals added a couple of insurance runs in the
eighth to make the final three-run margin.
Offensively, Stanford outhit Fullerton 11-to-nine, and it
was a familiar name doing most of the work, with Mike Tooth
man going three-for-four and picking up two RBI'S. "He and
Dotterer have really been carrying us offensively," said Mar
quess.
"Both have been super. Without their performances, we
would not have the record that we do," he added. "Some of
the guys got off to slow starts, and we really needed somebody
to pick up the slack."
Tuesday, the Cards host Sonoma State, and then this week
end. the defending national champion Arizona Wildcats
travel to Sunken Diamond for a three-game series beginning
Friday.
