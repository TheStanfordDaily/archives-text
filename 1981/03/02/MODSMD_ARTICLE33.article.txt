The Stanford men's lacrosse
team won its third game of the
season Saturday, defeating the
Sacramento Lacrosse Club 15-11
in a steady rain at Davis. Mid
fielder Chris Romper and at
tacker Kirk "AMC" Phelps
teamed up for a score in the
opening moments of the game,
and the two seemed inseparable
for the rest of the afternoon.
Romer registered five assists,
and Phelps scored seven goals.

Both teams seemed to score
at will early in the game until
middieT.J Hey man picked up a
loose ball in front of the crease
and slipped it past the Sacra
mento goalie. Goals bv Dave
Gardner and Freddie Benz gave
the Cardinals a 6-5 lead at the
end of the first quarter
The Cardinals increased that
lead to three goals, but Sacra
mento battled back late in the
third period, capi* lizing on two
Stanford penalties At 7:58 in
the fourth quarter, attacker

Dickie Taylor bounced a shot
into the nets and scored four
minutes later to quell a Sacra
mento threat Goals by Gardner
and Phelps "iced" the game.
Coach Sam Sadtler was
pleased with the team's per
formance. "We need to shoot
50-60 times a game to win," he
said, "and we have been doing
that this season. We outshot
Sacramento 47-39, and really
controlled that pivotal fourth
quarter."
