Few die-hard spectators braved Satur
day's weather to watch the Stanford-Arizo
na track meet, but they were repaid for
their hardship with a number of fine per
formances and exciting races.Both rain and
records fell at Stanford Stadium though the
men and women Cardinals lost to the Wild
cats, 55-96. and 59-84 respectively.
Kim Schnurpfeil, Dave Thomson, and
Dennis Arriola led the show for Stanford.
Schnurpfeil opened her season with a stellar
16:07.3 clocking for 5000 meters. The time
tops her personal best by 16 seconds, and is
good enough to have placed her in last year's
Olympic Trials. The sophomore opened up a
40 meter lead after only two laps, and ran

the entire remaining distance uncontested.
Thomson wasted no time in establishing
himself as a Pacific-10 favorite in the ham
mer throw. He twice bested his personal
record, with throws of 209 feet. 8 inches, and
209 feet, 11 inches. He later added a victory
in the discus to make himself the only men's
double winner of the day.
Sophomore steeplechaser Arriola upset
Kenyan Harrison Koroso of Arizona, in
what was probably the most exciting race of
the day. After trailing by 30 meters with
only one lap to go. the Wildcat runner pulled
up to Arriola's shoulder at the final turn.
The Stanford runner held him off down the
stretch and won in 8:59.4. a personal best.
There were quite a few other notable

Stanford marks in the men's half of the
meet. Shotputters Brian Holloway and
Craig Awbrey finished first and second re
spectively in that event. Darrin Nelson fin
ished second to Arizona's Nigerian Olym
pian Peter Okodogbe in the 100 meter race,
and also anchored the 400 meter relay team,
which won after the Wildcat team was dis
qualified for passing the baton outside of the
zone.
The women's effort was strongly sup
ported by freshmen Carol Cady and Marcia
Martin, and sophomore Pam Donald, who
together scored more than one half of the
team points. Cady finished second in all
three of the throwing events. Her discus
throw of 158 feet, 5 inches was good enough
to set a new school record.
