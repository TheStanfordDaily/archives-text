Reagan boosts military budget
Washington. D.C. — The Reagan administration
will flesh out its goal of "peace through strength"
this week with specific proposals for rebuilding U.S.
defenses that will call for the most lavish peacetime
military spending ever by a new administration.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger is ex
pected to ask Congress for a net boost of about $33
billion over the military budget authority totals rec
ommended by former President Jimmy Carter for
this year and next.
These proposals would raise defense budget au
thority to $177.7 billion in fiscal 1981. which ends
Sept. 30. and to $222.8 billion in fiscal 1982. Only a
small fraction of this would actually be spent in
those two years. Most of the new authority, per
mitting the Pentagon to make contract commit
ments. would be "spent out" in future years as new
ships, planes and other equipment are produced.
The new administration's unprecedented peace
time generosity to the armed services is in line with

President Ronald Reagan's assertion that one of his
top priorities is to "rebuild the nation's inadequate
defense capabilities." Reagan contends the Soviet
Union has outspent the United States by $300 billion
for defense since the late 19605.

"national save the youth walkathon" on March 15 in
Atlanta.
The Rev. David Smith, president of the associa
tion. said the march was "to signify how our chil
dren have met their deaths, one by one."
Another prayer vigil lasting 24 hours ended Satur

for God's help to solve the baffling crimes.
