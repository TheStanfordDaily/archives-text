# Trustees get fire safety report
## $3 million in fire damage noted; Renovation proposals made 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
Fire has never taken the life of a
University resident but property dam
age from fires in the last 13 years has
amounted to nearly $3 million, accord
ing to a special report to the Board of
Trustees.
The report, Fire Safety at Stanford
University, stated that "trade-offs
must be made" as both funds and fire
codes tighten.
Within the next three years the Uni
versity plans three series of safety
modifications on various buildings.
First, to comply with new fire and
seismic codes, the University will
spend $599,000 to modify 140 campus
elevators.
Second. Hoover Tower needs anoth
er exit, according to Peter Irish, depu
ty fire marshall for the University.
Stanford has been cited for a code vio
lation at Hoover Tower, which now
has only one fire exit. Although mod
ifications are scheduled for this year,
the cost of building the second exit has
not been determined.
Third, the University will install
fire sprinklers in eight older Row
Houses at a cost of $500,000.
Although 45 percent of the academic
buildings on campus have had full fire
sprinkler systems installed, only 11
percent of campus residences have
been "sprinklered." as the report
calls installation of the systems.
"But dorm residences have other
protective devices." noted Debbie
Walker, who compiled the report's in
formation.
Student dorms are equipped with
smoke detectors, alarms and other
notification systems, she said.
Though she added that "Fire
sprinklers would be preferable ev
erywhere," the University has
sprinklered academic buildings first
because those buildings have "large
groupa of poo pie and fewer ways out."
The same is true of the older Row
Houses, three of which — Phi Psi, Del

ta Tau Delta and Synergy — were
sprinklered last summer
Of the 48 fires that have happened at
Stanford since September 1967. nearly
half took place in residential areas. As
the report indicates, many of the aca
demic buildings struck bv fire in the
late '60s and early '70s were victims of
arson.
The fire safety report noted that the
University uses a "wide spectrum of
facilities, equipment and services" to
protect people and property on cam
pus.
The Palo Alto Fire Department
( PAFD) provides the University with
fire suppression services. In October
1976, when the University merged its
private fire department into the
PAFD, the PAFD took control of the
two fire stations on campus. (One of
these is at Campus Drive and Serra
Street, the other is at SLAC.)
By merging with the PAFD the Uni
versity saved "roughly" $170,000 the
first year, said Bill Korff, former
PAFD fire chief. Staff attrition since
then has helped save much more, he
said.
Of course, a fire department would
not be very effective without water
supplies. Stanford uses two water svs

terns to supply nearly 400 fire hydrants
around campus. A test of the water
distribution system in 1978 showed
that it was operating well, the report
noted
Fire prevention extends to campus
buildings via fire alarms, sprinklers
and extinguishers. Since 1970. the Uni
versity has installed sprinkler sys
tems in all new buildings and in major
renovations as a matter of policy.
Many campus buildings are at least
partially sprinklered but the cost of
sprinklering existing buildings is $4 to
$5 per square foot.
Stanford has installed more than
7000 portable fire extinguishers in
campus buildings and some 8000 fire
alarm devices have been placed
throughout the University. The report
called the fire alarm system here "su
perior to that of a well-protected
small town."
Should a fire break out, the Univer
sity pays up to $1 million of the subse
quent damage costs. Although the Uni
versity maintains this arrangement
with eight insurance companies, it has
also set up a "self-insurance" fund to
protect itself.

Fire prevention extends to campus
buildings via fire alarms, sprinklers
and extinguishers. Since 1970. the Uni
versity has installed sprinkler sys
tems in all new buildings and in major
renovations as a matter of policy.
Many campus buildings are at least
partially sprinklered but the cost of
sprinklering existing buildings is $4 to
$5 per square foot.
Stanford has installed more than
7000 portable fire extinguishers in
campus buildings and some 8000 fire
alarm devices have been placed
throughout the University. The report
called the fire alarm system here "su
perior to that of a well-protected
small town."
Should a fire break out, the Univer
sity pays up to $1 million of the subse
quent damage costs. Although the Uni
versity maintains this arrangement
with eight insurance companies, it has
also set up a "self-insurance" fund to
protect itself.
Fire has never taken the life of a
University resident but property dam
age from fires in the last 13 years has
amounted to nearly $3 million, accord
ing to a special report to the Board of
Trustees.
The report, Fire Safety at Stanford
University, stated that "trade-offs
must be made" as both funds and fire
codes tighten.
Within the next three years the Uni
versity plans three series of safety
modifications on various buildings.
First, to comply with new fire and
seismic codes, the University will
spend $599,000 to modify 140 campus
elevators.
Second. Hoover Tower needs anoth
er exit, according to Peter Irish, depu
ty fire marshall for the University.
Stanford has been cited for a code vio
lation at Hoover Tower, which now
has only one fire exit. Although mod
ifications are scheduled for this year,
the cost of building the second exit has
not been determined.
Third, the University will install
fire sprinklers in eight older Row
Houses at a cost of $500,000.
Although 45 percent of the academic
buildings on campus have had full fire
sprinkler systems installed, only 11
percent of campus residences have
been "sprinklered." as the report
calls installation of the systems.
"But dorm residences have other
protective devices." noted Debbie
Walker, who compiled the report's in
formation.
Student dorms are equipped with
smoke detectors, alarms and other
notification systems, she said.
Though she added that "Fire
sprinklers would be preferable ev
erywhere," the University has
sprinklered academic buildings first
because those buildings have "large
groupa of poo pie and fewer ways out."
The same is true of the older Row
Houses, three of which — Phi Psi, Del

ta Tau Delta and Synergy — were
sprinklered last summer
Of the 48 fires that have happened at
Stanford since September 1967. nearly
half took place in residential areas. As
the report indicates, many of the aca
demic buildings struck bv fire in the
late '60s and early '70s were victims of
arson.
The fire safety report noted that the
University uses a "wide spectrum of
facilities, equipment and services" to
protect people and property on cam
pus.
The Palo Alto Fire Department
( PAFD) provides the University with
fire suppression services. In October
1976, when the University merged its
private fire department into the
PAFD, the PAFD took control of the
two fire stations on campus. (One of
these is at Campus Drive and Serra
Street, the other is at SLAC.)
By merging with the PAFD the Uni
versity saved "roughly" $170,000 the
first year, said Bill Korff, former
PAFD fire chief. Staff attrition since
then has helped save much more, he
said.
Of course, a fire department would
not be very effective without water
supplies. Stanford uses two water svs

terns to supply nearly 400 fire hydrants
around campus. A test of the water
distribution system in 1978 showed
that it was operating well, the report
noted
