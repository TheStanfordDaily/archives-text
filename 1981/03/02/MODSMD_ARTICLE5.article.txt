# Oil drilling plan receives mixed opinion
## 
### Gale Warner 
Bay Area experts expressed mixed
reactions to Secretary of the Interior
James Watt's decision to reopen four
ocean basins off central and northern
California for possible oil develop
ment.
Connie Parrish, California repre
sentative of Friends of the Earth,
spoke of the fear that many small
coastal communities have of the ef
fect of offshore drilling on their wav of
life.
"The accompanying industrial de
velopment would certainly change the
character of their towns,'' she said.
Several hundred small businesses in
these communities signed a petition
protesting offshore development last
summer, she said. "They are con
cerned about its effect on wildlife, oil
and air pollution, and the harm in
flicted on the main parts of their econ
omy â€” tourism and commercial fish
ing."
Zeke Grader, general manager of
the Pacific Coast Federation of Fish
ermen's Associations, termed Watt's
decision "inappropriate" and ex
guide, but to downplay the relevance
of scientific theories to questions of
the "ultimate origins" of man and the
universe. Further, the commission
voted to include discussion of crea
tionism in the social science
framework.
The creationists, however, were
disappointed that creationism re
mained outside the schools' science
curricula, and they continued the
crusade.
"It's our position that a debate be
tween creationists and evolutionists is
immaterial," Kofahl continued, "but
if they (the state) are going to put
them (scientists) on to say that evolu
tion is a fact, they'd better be pre
pared to prove it under cross-ex
amination . . . we're going to make it
just as hard as we can."

Tyler said the primary issue in the
case is whether "we are being
dogmatic and indoctrinating" in
teaching evolution.
Tyler said he expects the state to
call 15 to 20 witnesses, including "the
ologians and philosophers to speak in
terms of what's science, what's re
ligion" and to address the question.
"Can you indoctrinate science?"
Tyler said religious leaders sched
uled to testify for the defense include
Julian Bartlett, retired Episcopal
archbishop of the Grace Cathedral in
San Francisco.
Other defense witnesses, Tyler
said, will include public school teach
ers. who will explain how evolution is
taught in California schools, and sci
entists. including Kornberg. who will
"explain the validity of evolutionary
theory."
