# Mystery fire's ruins remain at Encina

Walk into the east wing of Encina Hall and you'll find the usual array of
administrative offices complete with busy secretaries and filing clerks.
But step up one flight of stairs and the scene changes dramatically —
there you will find barren offices, walls with holes and cracks in them'and
ceiJihas losing their plaster. The carpeting is rolled up and stacked in the
corner of what used to be a high level administration office.
In fact, the top two stories of Encina Hall's east wing have been in that
condition since the night of June 7. 1972 when a fire swept through the
building. Although the center wing of the E-shaped building was even
tually renovated at a cost of $979,000, the water-damaged east wing was
left untouched. The University Personnel Department it once housed
moved into Old Pavilion across the street the day after the fire.
Estimates of how much it would cost the University to renovate En
cina's east wing range from five to ten million dollars.
"To renovate (Encina), the whole building interior would have to be
gutted and the University does not have $10 million." said Bob Beth, direc
tor of risk management.
Ed Scoles. director of housing and food services, said renovating the
building has "been on the list of things we'd like to do, but funds are un
available."
The first floor, which houses the Development Office, and the basement
of the east wing are still in use. Persons working there said the only new
development regarding the floors above them took place six months ago —
when the Univeristy further sealed off those floors to keep pigeons from
entering the building
The cause of the fire there was never determined but many people re
call the event as something spectacular.
Frank Jurian, Stanford's fire chief at the time the blaze occured said,
"It was certainly one of the most major fires fought at the University.
Jurian said the fire began in the attic of the center wing where employ
ees had stored payroll and personnel records.
Deficiencies in a concrete wall separating the center wing from the east
wing allowed the fire to creep through to the wood-paneled offices of the
Personnel Office and the Health Physics Department.
Jurian said the size and cost of the fire was the worst to hit the Univer
sity before last March's Storey House blaze made it spectacular. Jurian
said the Encina fire "sticks out in my mind" because about 250 fire
fighters "from all over the Bay Area" helped fight the fire and there was
not a single injury.
Encina Hall which still houses administration offices, became a favor
ite target of anti-administration demonstrators in the late '60s and early
'70s. The building was occupied once by angry protestors and was battered
by rocks. Given the frequency of arson at that time, many of the fire in
spectors suspected foul play. However, no direct evidence of arson was
ever discovered and the cause of the Encina fire remains as much a mys
tery today as it was nine years ago. j
