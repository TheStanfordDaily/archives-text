### Karen Halbo 
"I will always be in politics," Cali
fornia Sen. Marz Garcia (R-Menlo
Park) told a small group assembled in
Meyer Forum room Friday night.
Garcia called politics, "a very excit
ing, fascinating business" and said he
hopes to remain in politics as either an
elected official or a consultant.
Garcia, a lawyer who specialized in
tax law before being elected, declared
his support for President Ronald Rea
gan's proposed budget cuts, saying, "I
think he (Reagan) is on the right
track." Garcia noted, however, " A lot
of people will be dissatisfied, and a lot
of people will be hurt by it. "
Garcia spoke for an hour, describ
ing his educational background, his le
gal career, and his campaign. He then
answered questions from the au
dience
Garcia went to law school at Hast
ing's College of Law in San Francisco
and he said found law school "very de
pressing. reading of all the injustice

that was going on."
"I spoke up a lot in class, however,
and that stood me in good training. "
said Garcia. "I really think that if you
have a question, you should ask it.
There is no such thing as a stupid ques
tion — there are just a lot of intolerant
people," Garcia added.
In his last year of law school. Garcia
picked up an interest in tax law When
he was graduated from Hastings, he
attended New York University Law
School (NYU). Garcia remarked. "I
did much better at graduate law
school at NYU then I did at Hastings.
It was the best educational experience
I had (at NYU), and I've got four
degrees."
After getting his degree from NYU,
Garcia went to work in the tax depart
ment of Bank of America. Said Gar
cia, "I found the practice of tax law
much easier and more fun than study
ing it. I worked on pension plans, and
lending laws. There were some very
complex laws to be dealt with."

Garcia stayed with Bank of Ameri
ca for six years, and assumed a vice
presidential position with the com
pany. Garcia compared business and
politics saying. "The politics in poli
tics is much more honest than that in
the bank world. When two politicians
talk to one another, all you have to sell
is your word. If a politician breaks his
word, it gets around The people in pol
itics are at least straightforward. At
least, that's the way it is in California.
I think things are better here than
back east."
Garcia said he knew very little
about politics when he decided to run
for the senatorial seat of this district
"If I knew how formidable that task
i of running against incumbent Arlen
Gregorio) was. I don't think I would
have run."
In answer to a question about the
value of his law school training. Gar
cia replied, "It's been of tremendous
assistance. There is a logical training
that goes on, that's a great benefit,

even if you don't go into the practice of
law."
Asked his estimate as to the number
of lawyers in the California legisla
ture. Garcia said. "I think about 30 to
40 percent of the legislature are law
yers And I would say that the lawyers
are better communicators They ap
pear to think more clearly than the
rest."
Garcia described himself as "a fis
cal conservative."
Describing the current economic
situation Garcia said. "I think there's
plenty of money around to take care of
the problems of those who need help."
When asked if that included pro
grams for women, blacks. Chicanos
and other minorities. Garica said the
only people he sees as needing help are
"the black people in our society. I
think we owe these people some extra
help The answer to those people is to
equal their opportunity in education
and to equal their opportunity to par
ticipate in the economy "

ing his educational background, his le
gal career, and his campaign. He then
answered questions from the au
dience
Garcia went to law school at Hast
ing's College of Law in San Francisco
and he said found law school "very de
pressing. reading of all the injustice

that was going on."
"I spoke up a lot in class, however,
and that stood me in good training. "
said Garcia. "I really think that if you
have a question, you should ask it.
There is no such thing as a stupid ques
tion — there are just a lot of intolerant
people," Garcia added.
In his last year of law school. Garcia
picked up an interest in tax law When
he was graduated from Hastings, he
attended New York University Law
School (NYU). Garcia remarked. "I
did much better at graduate law
school at NYU then I did at Hastings.
It was the best educational experience
I had (at NYU), and I've got four
degrees."
After getting his degree from NYU,
Garcia went to work in the tax depart
ment of Bank of America. Said Gar
cia, "I found the practice of tax law
much easier and more fun than study
ing it. I worked on pension plans, and
lending laws. There were some very
complex laws to be dealt with."

Garcia stayed with Bank of Ameri
ca for six years, and assumed a vice
presidential position with the com
pany. Garcia compared business and
politics saying. "The politics in poli
tics is much more honest than that in
the bank world. When two politicians
talk to one another, all you have to sell
is your word. If a politician breaks his
word, it gets around The people in pol
itics are at least straightforward. At
least, that's the way it is in California.
I think things are better here than
back east."
Garcia said he knew very little
about politics when he decided to run
for the senatorial seat of this district
"If I knew how formidable that task
i of running against incumbent Arlen
Gregorio) was. I don't think I would
have run."
In answer to a question about the
value of his law school training. Gar
cia replied, "It's been of tremendous
assistance. There is a logical training
that goes on, that's a great benefit,

even if you don't go into the practice of
law."
Asked his estimate as to the number
of lawyers in the California legisla
ture. Garcia said. "I think about 30 to
40 percent of the legislature are law
yers And I would say that the lawyers
are better communicators They ap
pear to think more clearly than the
rest."
Garcia described himself as "a fis
cal conservative."
Describing the current economic
situation Garcia said. "I think there's
plenty of money around to take care of
the problems of those who need help."
When asked if that included pro
grams for women, blacks. Chicanos
and other minorities. Garica said the
only people he sees as needing help are
"the black people in our society. I
think we owe these people some extra
help The answer to those people is to
equal their opportunity in education
and to equal their opportunity to par
ticipate in the economy "
