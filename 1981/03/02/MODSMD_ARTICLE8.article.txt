## El Salvador: Coalition pocked by failures of right and left 
### Washington Post 
The government in El
Salvador that the Reagan ad
ministration has chosen to pro
vide with extensive military aid
and political backing is an un
stable compromise coalition
that has not been able to demon
strate much popular support
Members of the ruling civil
ian-military coalition, which
has undergone several changes
since it came to power in Octo
ber 1979. often have admitted
that without U.S. support to
fight off the leftist opposition,
twist the arm of the extreme
right and shore up the faltering
economy they could not have re
mained in power.
"The purpose of this regime
is not to be popular." said one of
its promoters in the U.S. Em
bassy during the Carter admin
istration. "It is to serve as a
transition toward a more demo
cratic government."
However, the continuing po
litical violence, the recent fail
ure of an all-out leftist offensive
and steady accumulation of
power by the more conservative
members of the governing coali
tion suggest that such a transi
tion may be a long way off.
Two months ago. a senior
U.S. official in El Salvador said
he believed that then-president

Ye its analysis

Jimmy Carter would not want to
leave office remembered as the
supporter of a "genocidal. nun
killing regime" and President
Ronald Reagan would not want
to come in that way either.
Support
But as intelligence reports
mounted at the end of last year
showing large-scale Cuban and
Soviet Bloc support for leitist
guerrillas in El Salvador, first
Carter and now Reagan have
thrown the weight of the United
States behind the Salvadoran
government, despite continuing
reports that its armed forces
are involved in killings of civil
ians suspected of ties to the left
The arms and the economic
aid that Washington sends to the
Salvadoran government may
see it through the current crisis
and counteract whatever for

eign threat exists, but it prom
ises little for the long-range sta
bility of El Salvador or the re
gion
In the 16 months since its sev
eral colonels came to power in a
military coup, the current
Salvadoran government has re
mained an unstable com
promise coalition conjured up
by Salvadoran officers and
North American diplomats to
forestall what seemed in 1979 to
be a widely supported leftist
push for power
The compromise was built in
the aftermath of the
Nicaraguan revolution as a
shortcut to reforms that might
avert a similar leftist takeover
in El Salvador. The government
was founded on promises of lib
eral initiatives, some of which
were promoted and even de
signed by the U.S. Embassy —
and manv of which remain to be
fulfilled
Moderate socialists
There were some hopeful mo
ments in the first months of the
government when the military
brought in civilian politicians
from a wide spectrum of
parties. Many were moderate
socialists described by U.S. of
ficials as "some of the most
capable men in the country."
But after less than three months
in the government they were
forced out. and many joined the
cause of the guerrillas under the
banner of the Democratic Revo
lutionary Front.
While every civilian minister
in the October 1979 government
has resigned or been replaced,
the minister of defense. Col.
Jose Guillermo Garcia, has re
tained his post despite repeated
abuses and atrocities by his
troops.
The most liberal colonel in
the original government . Adolfo
Arnoldo Majano. was forced out
last December and went into
hiding. It was announced Friday
that Majano had been arrested
Christian Democrat Jose
Napoleon Duarte. whose party
entered the government a year
ago. was recently appointed
president. But Col. Jaime Abdul
Gutierrez, a close political ally
of Garcia, retained the position
of commander-in-chief of the

armed forces, an indication that
the military has lost none of its
power.
The practice of the U.S.-
backed government, although
not its announced policy, is a
combination of tactics de
scribed by Archbishop Oscar
Romero, assassinated last
March, as "reform with repres
sion."
Land redistribution
Large amounts of land have
been redistributed in an attempt
to break up the near-feudal eco
nomic system that for half a
century placed almost all the
wealth of the country in the
hands of a small group of fami
lies known as "the oligarchy."
Such initiatives are credited
by President Duarte and U.S.
officials with weakening the
popular support of the revolu

tionary left and causing the fail
ure of its January attempt to
mount a popular insurrection.
Government repression, how
ever. remains a concrete reality
in El Salvador, and most ana
lysts believe no single fact of
Salvadoran life plays more cer
tainly into the hands of the re
bels over the long run.
Last year brought un
precedented terror for the
Salvadoran people as a shadow
war of assassination and re
taliation swept the country.
More than 10.000 people died,
and many reliable sources
blamed government forces for
most of the deaths. All this was
happening despite constant em
phasis on human rights by the
Carter administration.
Leftist rebels regularly
murdered soldiers, their fami

lies and friends and even those
merely suspected of sympathy
to the government The armed
forces, accustomed to complete
license under a half-century of
military rule, moved to ex
terminate the oppositon Right
wing death squads were equally
active. According to the most
recent State Department hu
man rights report, many of the
right-wing groups have close
ties with retired and active
members of the armed forces.
Their victims most often
were kidnapped, tortured and
killed as slowly as possible.
No prisoners
Guerrillas are virtually never
taken prisoner after clashes
with the armed forces. It is
common to find the bodies of re
bels who supposedly died in fire
fights but who actually had been

strangled.
None of these practices, al
though officially deplored, has
ended.
Part of the rationale behind
U.S. military aid to El Salvador,
even before the Cuban threat
was emphasized, was to help
bring the Salvadoran military
under control.
The idea was to provide train
ing and equipment to give incen
tives to the Salvadoran armed
forces to abandon their connec
tions with and dependence on
the traditional economic in
terests that run the country.
Through training programs
such as one begun for
Salvadorans last summer at the
U.S. military schools in Pan
ama. it was hoped a respect for
human rights and more subtle
ways of winning the hearts and

minds of the people could be in
stilled.
While such objectives have
not been abandoned, neither
have they shown any con
spicuous success, and they may
soon be forgotten as the
Salvadoran military con
solidates its forces and breaks
out its new American guns for
an all-out counteroffensive
against the guerrillas.
The civilians in the
Salvadoran government say
they want to negotiate a "proc
ess" but will not negotiate away
the government itself. The
Salvadoran Army, with its of
ficers beginning to believe that
their license to kill is restored
by the Reagan administration,
has begun looking forward to a
return to business as usual.

There were some hopeful mo

government when the military
brought in civilian politicians
from a wide spectrum of
parties. Many were moderate
socialists described by U.S. of
ficials as "some of the most
capable men in the country."
But after less than three months
in the government they were
forced out. and many joined the
cause of the guerrillas under the
banner of the Democratic Revo
lutionary Front.
While every civilian minister
in the October 1979 government
has resigned or been replaced,
the minister of defense. Col.
Jose Guillermo Garcia, has re

abuses and atrocities by his

Gutierrez, a close political ally

the military has lost none of its
power.
The practice of the U.S.-
backed government, although
not its announced policy, is a
combination of tactics de

Romero, assassinated last

Land redistribution
Large amounts of land have
been redistributed in an attempt
to break up the near-feudal eco
nomic system that for half a
century placed almost all the
wealth of the country in the
hands of a small group of fami
lies known as "the oligarchy."
Such initiatives are credited
by President Duarte and U.S.
officials with weakening the
popular support of the revolu

tionary left and causing the fail
ure of its January attempt to
mount a popular insurrection.
Government repression, how

precedented terror for the
Salvadoran people as a shadow
war of assassination and re

More than 10.000 people died,

happening despite constant em
phasis on human rights by the
Carter administration.

recent State Department hu
man rights report, many of the
right-wing groups have close
ties with retired and active
members of the armed forces.
Their victims most often
were kidnapped, tortured and
killed as slowly as possible.
No prisoners
Guerrillas are virtually never
taken prisoner after clashes
with the armed forces. It is
common to find the bodies of re
bels who supposedly died in fire
fights but who actually had been

strangled.
None of these practices, al
though officially deplored, has

Part of the rationale behind
U.S. military aid to El Salvador,

under control.
The idea was to provide train

forces to abandon their connec
tions with and dependence on
the traditional economic in
terests that run the country.
Through training programs
such as one begun for
Salvadorans last summer at the
U.S. military schools in Pan
ama. it was hoped a respect for
human rights and more subtle
ways of winning the hearts and

minds of the people could be in
stilled.
While such objectives have
not been abandoned, neither
have they shown any con
spicuous success, and they may
soon be forgotten as the
Salvadoran military con
solidates its forces and breaks
out its new American guns for
an all-out counteroffensive
against the guerrillas.
The civilians in the
Salvadoran government say
they want to negotiate a "proc

the government itself. The
Salvadoran Army, with its of

their license to kill is restored
by the Reagan administration,
has begun looking forward to a
return to business as usual.
The government in El
Salvador that the Reagan ad
ministration has chosen to pro

Members of the ruling civil
ian-military coalition, which
has undergone several changes
since it came to power in Octo
ber 1979. often have admitted
that without U.S. support to
fight off the leftist opposition,
twist the arm of the extreme
right and shore up the faltering
economy they could not have re
mained in power.
"The purpose of this regime
is not to be popular." said one of

However, the continuing po

tainly into the hands of the re
bels over the long run.
Last year brought un
precedented terror for the
Salvadoran people as a shadow
war of assassination and re
taliation swept the country.
More than 10.000 people died,
and many reliable sources
blamed government forces for
most of the deaths. All this was
happening despite constant em
phasis on human rights by the
Carter administration.
Leftist rebels regularly
murdered soldiers, their fami

lies and friends and even those
merely suspected of sympathy
to the government The armed
forces, accustomed to complete
license under a half-century of
military rule, moved to ex
terminate the oppositon Right
wing death squads were equally
active. According to the most
recent State Department hu
man rights report, many of the
right-wing groups have close
ties with retired and active
members of the armed forces.
Their victims most often
were kidnapped, tortured and
killed as slowly as possible.
No prisoners
Guerrillas are virtually never
taken prisoner after clashes
with the armed forces. It is
common to find the bodies of re
bels who supposedly died in fire
fights but who actually had been

strangled.
None of these practices, al
though officially deplored, has
ended.
Part of the rationale behind
U.S. military aid to El Salvador,
even before the Cuban threat
was emphasized, was to help
bring the Salvadoran military
under control.
The idea was to provide train
ing and equipment to give incen
tives to the Salvadoran armed
forces to abandon their connec
tions with and dependence on
the traditional economic in
terests that run the country.
Through training programs
such as one begun for
Salvadorans last summer at the
U.S. military schools in Pan
ama. it was hoped a respect for
human rights and more subtle
ways of winning the hearts and

minds of the people could be in
stilled.
While such objectives have
not been abandoned, neither
have they shown any con
spicuous success, and they may
soon be forgotten as the
Salvadoran military con
solidates its forces and breaks
out its new American guns for
an all-out counteroffensive
against the guerrillas.
The civilians in the
Salvadoran government say
they want to negotiate a "proc
ess" but will not negotiate away
the government itself. The
Salvadoran Army, with its of
ficers beginning to believe that
their license to kill is restored
by the Reagan administration,
has begun looking forward to a
return to business as usual.
