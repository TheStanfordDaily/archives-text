# W. Germany responds to US policy on El Salvador
## 
### 
By The Washington Post
West Germany has become the first major American
ally to openly set itself apart from Reagan adminis
tration efforts to isolate the Salvadoran left interna
tionally, endorsing an effort by German political
parties to establish contacts between El Salvador's
government and opposition.
The West German initiative, disclosed last week, is
only one of several signs that the U.S. diplomatic drive
in Western Europe and Latin America has fallen short
of winning the kind of unqualified backing from influen
tial countries in both regions that the administration is
seeking
Britain, France, Italy and even West Germany pub
licly labeled as "convincing" documents presented by
special envoy Lawrence Eagleburger designed to dem
onstrate widespread communist arms support for lef
tist revolutionaries. The Europeans condemned the
communist support "unacceptable interference" in the
affairs of the violence-torn Central American country.
Behind the scenes, however, leading policy-makers
in France and West Germany have gone out of their
way to stress that their public statements should not
imply support for either side to settle the Salvadoran
conflict by military means. Their stress on the need for
a political solution and for social reforms stands in
sharp contrast to the posture of the Reagan adminis
tration. which calls for pouring in increased amounts of
military hardware and "technical advisers to assist the
government in San Salvador.
The administration's special envoy to Latin Ameri
ca, Gen. Vernon Walters, so far appears to have been
even less successful in winning public support for the
administration's first major diplomatic drive. In Mexi
co. officials responded to the drive by issuing a string of
comments praising Cuba and questioning U.S. policy
while Walters was making his rounds in the region.

Leading officials in Brazil, while greeting Walters
warmly, repeated their opposition to any type of in
tervention in El Salvador, a measure of the distance
traveled since 1965 when Brazil was the only major
Latin American country to send troops to assist the
U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic as part ot
a short-lived "inter-American" peacekeeping force.
Similar sentiments have been expressed publicly and
privately by officials in Venezuela and Argentina, two
countries generally sympathetic to the government in
San Salvador.
In Buenos Aires. Walters stressed that he was mak
ing no "request" of the Argentine government, and that
he certainly was not seeking a possible blockade of
Cuba. Argentine officials, nevertheless, were touchy at
the mere suggestion that they might follow the U.S.
lead just because Washington beckoned.
"The era of collective decision-making in the OAS
(Organization of American States) has ended," said
one irritated Foreign Ministry official after Walters
left.
The most significant Latin response, and the one
which most fully indicates the difficulty the Reagan ad
ministration will have in pressing its case, came from
Mexico.
In the days since Walters brought his evidence of out
side interference to the attention of Mexican officials.
Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo has:
— publicly embraced Cuba as the country in Latin
America "most dear" to Mexico;
— warned against the "unscrupulous arrogance of
military power" while lamenting that Central America
"has unfortunately become elevated to the undesirable
rank of strategic frontier";
— and, if the earlier, statement might have been
vague as to whom he was referring, the Mexican leader

on Tuesday flatly warned against U.S. intervention in
El Salvador, saying it is neither "natural nor reason
able" tor powerful outsiders to'' fight over our conflicts
as though they were the owners."
The West German initiative appears to reflect both
strains within the governing Social Democratic Party
of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and a West German
tradition of trying to mediate sharp differences be
tween leftists and rightists.
In a public statement Wednesday, government
spokesman Kurt Becker said Bonn "expressed its un
derstanding for the American worry over the develop
ments in El Salvador and over the influence of Com
munist states on the inner conditions of the country."
Becker went on to say, however, that the Bonn gov
ernment "opposes all use of violence in El Salvador,
whether from the right or the left."
Specifically, Becker said efforts were under way to
get representatives of the government junta and the
Democratic Revolutionary Front, the left's umbrella
grouping, to accept invitations from the West German
Christian Democratic and Social Democratic parties,
respectively, perhaps early in March. The State De
partment has labeled the FDR, as it is called after the
Spanish, a front organization for Marxist-dominated
leftist guerrillas.
Sources close to Chancellor Schmidt said Thursday
that while Bonn fully understands U.S. concern over El
Salvador, it believes the solution to the country's prob
lems, and the issue of outside interference, must be po
litical, and not military. French Foreign Minister Jean
Francois-Poncet voiced similar sentiments earlier this
week when he said at a press conference in Washington
that France believes military means will not solve El
Salvador's civil strife and that economic and social re
forms are required.
