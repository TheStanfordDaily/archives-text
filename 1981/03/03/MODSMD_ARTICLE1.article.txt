# U.S. to send $25M in arms to El Salvador
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” The Reagan adminis
tration announced yesterday that it
would send $25 million worth of arms
and equipment, along with another 20
American military advisers, to aid the
government of El Salvador in its bat
tle against leftist guerillas.
Announcement of the stepped-up as
sistance came just hours after Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig disclosed
that the United States would stop all
aid to neighboring Nicaragua unless it
took steps within the next few weeks
to cut off the flow of arms going
through Nicaragua to the insurgents in
El Salvador.
Officials at the Department of State
spent much of the day yesterday brief
ing members of the House and Senate
on the new hardware and technical as
sistance to be sent to strife-torn El
Salvador.
William Dyess, a State Dept.
spokesman, said that the military
equipment would include additional
helicopters, small arms, radar and
surveillance equipment, and trans
port vehicles.
The addition of the 20 advisers will
bring the total number of American
military personnel involved in assist
ing and training Salvadoran govern
ment forces to 54. This includes six
Navy technicians who, the State Dept.
announced two days ago, are being
sent to supervise maintenance on
Salvadoran patrol boats in an effort to
help stem the flow of outside arms into
that country.
"The insurgents are regrouping,"
Dyess said, "and massive quantities
of arms remain either inside El
Salvador or. . . waiting to be smug
gled in. We want to improve as much

as possible the government's ability to
deal with this problem."
Dyess emphasized that the Ameri
can personnel already in El Salvador,
and those who will be sent as a result
of the decision announced yesterday,
will not be involved in combat opera
tions. Though they will carry side
arms, he said, they will remain in gar
rison areas acting in an advisory ca
pacity only.
Yesterday's announcement said
that the 20 new advisers will be
divided into four five-man training
teams specializing in assistance to
Salvadoran forces in helicopter opera
tions and maintenance; operations
and communications; naval opera
tions; and small-unit combat training.
Dyess said it is the administration's
view that the additional assistance
will not require the approval of Con
gress, and that it does not fall within
the provisions of the 1972 War Powers
Act, which requires congressional ap
proval for committing U.S. personnel
to combat areas.
Dyess also indicated yesterday that
the administration might increase the
United States's non-military as
sistance, $63 million in the present fis
cal year, going to El Salvador.
The additional steps to assist the
military government in El Salvador
fueled the growing debate over the
U.S. role in the fighting, the first ma
jor foreign policy decision of the Rea
gan administration.
Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) a mem
ber of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said that U.S. military ad
visers "go down there as prime
target" of the anti-government
guerillas. But Sen. Jesse Helms (R-
N.C.) a staunch supporter of aid to El

Salvador, repeated his long-held posi
tion that the Reagan administration
"should do whatever is necessary to
keep Central America and South
America from being taken over by the
Marxists."
Meeting with a small group of re
porters at breakfast yesterday, Haig
outlined further steps that the United
States is prepared to take in order to
control the flow of weapons from
Nicaragua into El Salvador.
"We told them they would have 30
days to clean it up," Haig told a small
group of reporters at a breakfast
meeting. "It is in their power to clean
it up, and we've had certain as
surances from them."
Nicaragua has been warned that, if
arms shipments continue, the United
States will not only impose a formal
aid cutoff but will also demand that
about $60 million in aid already de

livered be returned, reporters were
told. "They know what they've been
doing, and they know what our condi
tions are," Haig said.
Haig said that the warning was giv
en to the Nicaraguan government
about two weeks ago. That would
leave just over two weeks for
Nicaragua to shut down the arms flow,
which U.S. intelligence reports say is
coordinated by Cuba and the Soviet
Union.
Congress gave the Carter adminis
tration grudging approval last year
for a $75 million aid program to
Nicaragua for the present fiscal year.
The aid was temporarily suspended in
January after delivery of $60 million,
while U.S. officials tried to verify that
the money was being delivered to the
Nicaraguan private sector, as Con
gress had demanded.
