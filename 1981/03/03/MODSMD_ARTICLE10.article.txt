# If Women lawyers relate experiences
## 
### Karen Halbo 
What is it like to be a woman
in law? That question was dis
cussed Saturday morning at the
Law School lounge by four wom
en lawyers.
The four speakers repre
sented a variety of jobs within
the law field: one was a govern*
ment lawyer, one a corporate
lawyer, one a public defender
and one a municipal court
judge.
Judy Ford, director of the re
gional office of the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC),
graduated from Boalt Law
School in 1974. She obtained her
undergraduate degree from
Berkeley seventeen years
earlier in 1957, and returned to
school after having a family.
"I went to law school late in
life," said Ford. "Although I'm
not sure I was the first grand
mother to graduate from the
law school, I know I was the first
black grandmother to graduate
from the law school," she
chuckled.
During her break between un
dergraduate and graduate
work, Ford worked as a com
puter programmer. However,
she was dissatisfied with pro
gramming, and decided that
she, "wanted to do things that
were more relevant and more
interesting. . . I felt I could do
that with law."
Jessica Pers. also a graduate
of Boalt, related her ex
periences as a corporate law
yer.
Pers was an undergraduate at
Yale University, and after grad

uating from Boalt in 1977.
worked in legal research and as
a litigation associate. Pers also
worked on a project that ex
amined the foster children child
care system in California, and
wrote a book about her findings.
Said Pers on working as a cor
porate lawyer,"l have a lot of
responsibility on cases, and it's
very rewarding, both financial
ly and growth-wise."
The Hon. Judge Nancy Hoff
man of the Santa Clara munici
pal court, said she enjoyed the
office because of the complete
control each attorney has over
his own cases.
Talking about her present
position on the bench, Hoffman
said, "I feel my work on the
bench is exhilarating. I'm very
comfortable in the municipal
court."
One of Hoffman's duties as a
municipal court judge includes
doing wedding ceremonies.
Hoffman had to leave the meet
ing early to go officiate at sever
al weddings.
Commenting on what it is like
to be a woman judge, Hoffman
said, "The men don't know what
to call me. They end up calling
me Ma'am or Sir, and I have to
suggest to them that they call
me judge."
Citing the problems women
encounter in the practice of law,
Hoffman noted that women
often internalize the problems
they face in court. She cited in
stances where a woman lawyer
who has lost her case will ask

herself, what did I do wrong?
She said the male lawyer in the
same situation is more likely to
complain about what a bad deal
the judge gave him.
Hoffman also noted that
women are more skilled in help
ing settle cases out of court. She
said, "Women don't get so hung
up on being an advocate, and
being an adversary."
Discussing the skills young
women lawyers should be focus
ing on, Hoffman cited trial
skills, activities in the com
munity, activities in the bar,
civil and criminal law and get
ting a municipal court appoint
ment first and then working up
from there.
After Hoffman spoke, Angela
Blackwell, a managing attorney
with Public Advocates, who also
attended law school at Boalt,
was introduced. Blackwell has a
very diverse background, in
cluding experience as a com
munity organizer, work in
educational research, and a
year of living in Tanzania.
Said Blackwell of her law
education, "I enjoyed it im
mensely. Once you got down the
reasoning process you can apply
it all over the place, and just do
the same thing over and over
again."
Blackwell got started with
Public Advocates when she was
asked to work with them on a
short-term basis. "I've been
there ever since," she said.
"I feel I am working to help
oppressed people," said

Blackwell of her job with Public
Advocates. She added that she
doesn't do just litigation, but
also helps community groups
with administrative petitions,
meetings and organizing, along
with education within the com
munity.
In a general question and an
swer session after each of the
women were introduced, the
problems involved in having a
career in law and a family were

discussed.
Said Blackwell, "I think it's a
mistake when a woman dis
misses the idea of having a fam
ily."
Ford agreed, but. added that
she thinks it's very important
for women to hire household
help. She said. "Once you have
enough money to eat, you need
to get someone to help around
the house â€” it makes that much
of a difference."
