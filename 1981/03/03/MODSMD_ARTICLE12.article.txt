## Jerry Russell Medieval minority hold court 
### 
In the medieval period of Eu
ropean history, the dominant
modes of thought were unques
tioning faith, belief in miracles,
and blind acceptance of the au
thority of "revealed scripture"
and the intertwined,
aristocratic hierarchies of
church and state. Today, it
seems as though millions of
Americans have noi yet heard of
the Renaissance, let alone the
scientific revolution of Darwin,
or the philosophical en
lightenment of Voltaire and
Rousseau. Militant medi
evalism is becoming more and
more dominant on the Ameri
can political scene.
One of the most visible signs
of medievalism in America is
the popularity of evangelical
Christianity. All evangelicals
profess the belief that the Bible
is the ultimate authority on
moral questions, that it repre
sents a direct pipeline of in
formation and guidance from
"god." and that human reason
and understanding cannot hope
to equal it. nor can anyone legit
imately disagree with it. In
view of all the evidence which
has accumulated showing that
the Bible is, in fact, a self-con
tradictory collection of ancient
tribal myths, the fundamen
talists' trust in the Bible can
only be characterized as a medi
eval throwback.
Speaking here recently,
former Senator George Mc-
Govern expressed dismay at the
extremism of many fundamen
talists, saying that the kind of
god they believe in is not the
same as the god his father
taught him about. Unfortunate
ly, the reactionary views of
many fundamentalists, such as
Jerry Falwell and his "moral
majority," are very well sup
ported by "the scriptures."
The Bible is, by and large, a
racist, sexist, militaristic,
elitist, and intolerant book,
filled with stories of blood
curdling military atrocities,
tales of kings and tyrants ruling
by divine right, and sermons
about the inherently inferior
status of women. It is per
meated by the smug conviction
that "god's chosen people" are
superior to all other races and

creeds.
This is not to say that there
aren't also some very liberal,
even modern, sentiments in the
Bible. It is a book of many con
tradictions. so people like Mc-
Govern aren't entirely ground
less when they argue that the
Bible supports their liberal
ideas. Even so. there is nothing
more intellectually painful than
listening to a modernist Chris
tian trying to explain away the
parts of the Bible he doesn't
like. The point is. both the re
ligious conservatives and the re
ligious liberals are guilty of me
dieval styles of thought. Rather
than relying on their own rea
son, they think that "the truth"
has been handed down from on
high.
It is no surprise that medieval
thinking often leads to medieval
conclusions. For many of these
people, the concept of the sepa
ration of church and state is an
incomprehensible abstraction.
John Anderson, for example,
once sought to amend the U.S.
Constitution to affirm "the
lordship of Jesus Christ." Even
freedom, as a practical matter,
is beyond their understanding.
They would like to require
couples to submit identi
fication, including proof of mar
riage, before checking into
motels. It often seems as if they
will be truly happy only when all
the gays of San Francisco have
been driven into the Bay.
As for foreign policy, Ameri
ca is to be thought of as a medi
eval castle, armed to the teeth
and exacting tributes in the
form of strategic minerals, and
coffee beans from the surround
ing countryside. Safe in
Fortress America, the medi
evalists await the coming
millennium. In the aftermath of
nuclear holocaust, Jesus will
save their souls. It's all foreseen
in the Book of Revelation, in
gruesome detail. Meanwhile,
St. Francis McGovern goes
about giving alms to the poor,
and decrying the worldliness of
the men in the castle.
Many people feel that medi
eva\ thinking, per se, is not a se
rious problem. "If someone
wants to believe in Yahweh or
Jesus, or, for that matter, if

they want to believe in Allah,
Krishna, or the Easter Bunny,
it's none of my business," they
reason However, when the an
cient myths are invoked as a
major determinant of public
policy by all three major presi
dential candidates, it's time for
concern that our democracy
may soon be a theocracy.
Americans must let the medi
evalists know, in no uncertain
terms, that the real issue is the
unacceptability of the tribal god
Yahweh as an arbiter of public
policy and public morality in
modern times.
