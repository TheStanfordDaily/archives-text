## Clark and other nice, bright students need geography 
### 
William Clark, former Stan
ford student, has been con
firmed as Deputy Secretary of
State. Because of his ignorance
of geography, history and con
temporary affairs he has be
come the laughing stock of the
world press. He is a nice, bright
man.
The series of symposia en
titled "A World in Crisis: the
United States Faces the 80s"
will end on March 11. The 21
symposia — a total of 45 meet
ings — have been a remarkable
success. Even though many ex
plosive issues were discussed,
there was never an unpleasant
moment. The meetings were
held in a spirit of informed and
rational discourse, with a wide
variety of views freely ex
pressed. This is what univer
sities should be all about.
In connection with this sym
posia I have given two semi
nars. The students are nice and
bright. Early in the Autumn
quarter it became apparent
that, because of their lack of
background in geography, his
tory and contemporary affairs,
they were having difficulty fol
lowing the discussions. I there
fore gave them a series of rath
er elementary tests to check on
their background.

The results were startling. In
stead of the 60 percent to 100
percent which one could expect,
the range was from about 5 per
cent to 40 percent. Answers such
as 'The Amazon is in Africa"
were quite frequent.
The seminars went through a
crisis. Most students were de
pressed, but they learned their
lesson and have made re
markable progress. However,
some were less pleasant. There
were the usual groans: "I have
to have an A to get into Law
School." "I won't take the semi
nar next quarter unless I get an
A." Some students, after learn
ing that they had received a B,
told me that they would not take
the next seminar unless I
changed their grade.
I was told that in one class
with 550 students, 500 get As.
The instructions tell us that A
means outstanding and B supe
rior. I checked with the admin
istration and was told that 39
percent of students receive As.
One official said that grades
don't mean anything any more.
The general pattern is that
students take courses required
tor their major and then shop
around for electives in which
they can receive an A without
too much work. They are vic

tims of the system. I have
watched the assessment of fac
ulty by students since it began in
Berkeley in 1937, and it is ob
vious that there is a correlation
between the grades students re
ceive and their assessment of
the instructor.
But back to more substantive
issues. Discussions of interna
tional affairs on our campuses
are often little more than
diatribes in which the passion
displayed is in inverse propor
tion to the speaker's knowledge.
I have watched with disgust
loutish attacks on some of our
most respected specialists.
The Stanford Geography De
partment was abolished in 1963.
It had been established when a
grant to create language and
area programs was made cont
ingent on the provision of
courses in geography. Its de
mise came when, with an influx
of Ford Foundation funds, the
behavioral sciences and the
quantitative method swept the
universities of the United States
and of those countries where
Ford money was doing its thing.
Geography was dismissed as de
scriptive and unworthy of a uni
versity which boasted that it
was on the cutting edge, and cut
ting is much easier than creat

ing.
The crusade was led by a hu
manities professor who had
achieved some fame by his stud
ies of an author he pulled out of
the garbage can of history; the
poor man had no understanding
of the contemporary world. A
voice crying in the wilderness, I
protested, but the wilderness
was silent, except for nasty
growls from the Adminis
tration. Even the History de
partment, which should have
fought for the discipline without
which history makes no sense,
was deaf to appeals; history
was busy transforming itself
into a behavioral science.
Things are changing.
Fernand Braudel, whose The
Mediterranean Under Philip II
is a classic of pandisciplinary
humanistic history, listened to
the golden trumpets of the be
havioral sciences, and joined
the marching soldiers. Now, in
his latest book, On History, he
expresses his dismay at the de
struction of the old order in
which Marc Bloch's geographi
cal basis of history reflected the
tradition of great geographers
like Vidal de la Blache. Alas, in
France as in England, the
triumph of Marxists and struc
turalists like Louis Althusser
had ended the happy marriage
of two great disciplines, geo
graphy and history.
A change is coming. Scholars
are realizing that geography is
much more than a high-school
memorization of names. It is
the understanding of the space
relationship, which for contem
porary studies is more impor
tant than the understanding of
time relationship in the field of
history.
Historians feel uneasy about
the study of the present, for
which their traditional tools
were not made. Political scien
tists have almost lost their
sense of geography, and in only
a few institutions like Cal Tech
has a chair in political geogra
phy survived.
How can we resurrect geog
raphy? A refusal to admit mis
takes is alleged to be the sign of
a good administrator, but Stan
ford President Kennedy and his
group did not make the mistake.
Being warm, open-minded peo
ple, they could consider the
whole question anew. However,
Stanford has gone crazy about
replacing simple organizational
labels with baroque ones, so
"geography" would be too
simple a term. Moreover, a plan

to restore the geography depart
ment would have no sex appeal
for foundations.
How about "geopolitics?" An
excellent term, better than "po
litical geography," but tainted
by Nazi ideologists. So let us set
tle for "strategic studies,"
which means geography with all
its ramifications as applied to
our national needs. It is a fash
ionable term, although as a
simple soul I would prefer "ge
ography." At least "strategic
studies" would ensure that our
discussions of international
problems take into account hard
realities and our national needs.
Then our bright and nice stu
dents would be better equipped
for these discussions. Let us
stop dismissing geography as a
high-school subject. It is an es
sential component of studies
which are at least as com
plicated as cancer research or
nuclear physics. I am convinced
that our students would wel
come this new, or rather old,
dimension.
The "World in Crisis" sym
posia have shown that many stu
dents are eager for the kind of
information thus provided,
always with an array of maps on
the stage to stress the link be
tween geography and contem
porary affairs.
Another good sign is the
change in the Stanford Daily.
Years ago it was just another
college rag. Now it provides ex
cellent reporting on interna
tional affairs. The influx of the
students responsible for this
into the media may do much to
reverse the trend which has
brought us such superficial re
porting of the world's recent
crisis.
The appointment of Elie Abel
to the Communications Depart
ment provides Stanford with a
direct link to top-level journal
ism. Many problems remain,
but there are good reasons for
encouragement.
The ASSU can invite William
Clark back to Stanford as a visit

William Clark, former Stan
ford student, has been con
firmed as Deputy Secretary of
State. Because of his ignorance
of geography, history and con
temporary affairs he has be
come the laughing stock of the
world press. He is a nice, bright
man.
The series of symposia en
titled "A World in Crisis: the
United States Faces the 80s"
will end on March 11. The 21
symposia — a total of 45 meet
ings — have been a remarkable
success. Even though many ex
plosive issues were discussed,
there was never an unpleasant
moment. The meetings were
held in a spirit of informed and
rational discourse, with a wide
variety of views freely ex
pressed. This is what univer
sities should be all about.
In connection with this sym
posia I have given two semi
nars. The students are nice and
bright. Early in the Autumn
quarter it became apparent
that, because of their lack of
background in geography, his
tory and contemporary affairs,
they were having difficulty fol
lowing the discussions. I there
fore gave them a series of rath
er elementary tests to check on
their background.

The results were startling. In
stead of the 60 percent to 100
percent which one could expect,
the range was from about 5 per
cent to 40 percent. Answers such
as 'The Amazon is in Africa"
were quite frequent.
The seminars went through a
crisis. Most students were de
pressed, but they learned their
lesson and have made re
markable progress. However,
some were less pleasant. There
were the usual groans: "I have
to have an A to get into Law
School." "I won't take the semi
nar next quarter unless I get an
A." Some students, after learn
ing that they had received a B,
told me that they would not take
the next seminar unless I
changed their grade.
I was told that in one class
with 550 students, 500 get As.
The instructions tell us that A
means outstanding and B supe
rior. I checked with the admin
istration and was told that 39
percent of students receive As.
One official said that grades
don't mean anything any more.
The general pattern is that
students take courses required
tor their major and then shop
around for electives in which
they can receive an A without
too much work. They are vic

tims of the system. I have
watched the assessment of fac
ulty by students since it began in
Berkeley in 1937, and it is ob
vious that there is a correlation
between the grades students re
ceive and their assessment of
the instructor.
But back to more substantive
issues. Discussions of interna
tional affairs on our campuses
are often little more than
diatribes in which the passion
displayed is in inverse propor
tion to the speaker's knowledge.
I have watched with disgust
loutish attacks on some of our
most respected specialists.
The Stanford Geography De
partment was abolished in 1963.
It had been established when a
grant to create language and
area programs was made cont
ingent on the provision of
courses in geography. Its de
mise came when, with an influx
of Ford Foundation funds, the
behavioral sciences and the
quantitative method swept the
universities of the United States
and of those countries where
Ford money was doing its thing.
Geography was dismissed as de
scriptive and unworthy of a uni
versity which boasted that it
was on the cutting edge, and cut
ting is much easier than creat

ing.
The crusade was led by a hu
manities professor who had
achieved some fame by his stud
ies of an author he pulled out of
the garbage can of history; the
poor man had no understanding
of the contemporary world. A
voice crying in the wilderness, I
protested, but the wilderness
was silent, except for nasty
growls from the Adminis
tration. Even the History de
partment, which should have
fought for the discipline without
which history makes no sense,
was deaf to appeals; history
was busy transforming itself
into a behavioral science.
Things are changing.
Fernand Braudel, whose The
Mediterranean Under Philip II
is a classic of pandisciplinary
humanistic history, listened to
the golden trumpets of the be
havioral sciences, and joined
the marching soldiers. Now, in
his latest book, On History, he
expresses his dismay at the de
struction of the old order in
which Marc Bloch's geographi
cal basis of history reflected the
tradition of great geographers
like Vidal de la Blache. Alas, in
France as in England, the
triumph of Marxists and struc
turalists like Louis Althusser
had ended the happy marriage
of two great disciplines, geo
graphy and history.
A change is coming. Scholars
are realizing that geography is
much more than a high-school
memorization of names. It is
the understanding of the space
relationship, which for contem
porary studies is more impor
tant than the understanding of
time relationship in the field of
history.
Historians feel uneasy about
the study of the present, for
which their traditional tools
were not made. Political scien
tists have almost lost their
sense of geography, and in only
a few institutions like Cal Tech
has a chair in political geogra
phy survived.
How can we resurrect geog
raphy? A refusal to admit mis
takes is alleged to be the sign of
a good administrator, but Stan
ford President Kennedy and his
group did not make the mistake.
Being warm, open-minded peo
ple, they could consider the
whole question anew. However,
Stanford has gone crazy about
replacing simple organizational
labels with baroque ones, so
"geography" would be too
simple a term. Moreover, a plan

to restore the geography depart
ment would have no sex appeal
for foundations.
How about "geopolitics?" An
excellent term, better than "po
litical geography," but tainted
by Nazi ideologists. So let us set
tle for "strategic studies,"
which means geography with all
its ramifications as applied to
our national needs. It is a fash
ionable term, although as a
simple soul I would prefer "ge
ography." At least "strategic
studies" would ensure that our
discussions of international
problems take into account hard
realities and our national needs.
Then our bright and nice stu
dents would be better equipped
for these discussions. Let us
stop dismissing geography as a
high-school subject. It is an es
sential component of studies
which are at least as com
plicated as cancer research or
nuclear physics. I am convinced
that our students would wel
come this new, or rather old,
dimension.
The "World in Crisis" sym
posia have shown that many stu
dents are eager for the kind of
information thus provided,
always with an array of maps on
the stage to stress the link be
tween geography and contem
porary affairs.
Another good sign is the
change in the Stanford Daily.
Years ago it was just another
college rag. Now it provides ex
cellent reporting on interna
tional affairs. The influx of the
students responsible for this
into the media may do much to
reverse the trend which has
brought us such superficial re
porting of the world's recent
crisis.
The appointment of Elie Abel
to the Communications Depart
ment provides Stanford with a
direct link to top-level journal
ism. Many problems remain,
but there are good reasons for
encouragement.

completed his on-the-job train
ing.

William Clark, former Stan
ford student, has been con
firmed as Deputy Secretary of
State. Because of his ignorance
of geography, history and con
temporary affairs he has be
come the laughing stock of the
world press. He is a nice, bright
man.
The series of symposia en
titled "A World in Crisis: the
United States Faces the 80s"
will end on March 11. The 21
symposia — a total of 45 meet
ings — have been a remarkable
success. Even though many ex
plosive issues were discussed,
there was never an unpleasant
moment. The meetings were
held in a spirit of informed and
rational discourse, with a wide
variety of views freely ex
pressed. This is what univer
sities should be all about.
In connection with this sym
posia I have given two semi
nars. The students are nice and
bright. Early in the Autumn
quarter it became apparent
that, because of their lack of
background in geography, his
tory and contemporary affairs,
they were having difficulty fol
lowing the discussions. I there
fore gave them a series of rath
er elementary tests to check on
their background.

The results were startling. In
stead of the 60 percent to 100
percent which one could expect,
the range was from about 5 per
cent to 40 percent. Answers such
as 'The Amazon is in Africa"
were quite frequent.
The seminars went through a
crisis. Most students were de
pressed, but they learned their
lesson and have made re
markable progress. However,
some were less pleasant. There
were the usual groans: "I have
to have an A to get into Law
School." "I won't take the semi
nar next quarter unless I get an
A." Some students, after learn
ing that they had received a B,
told me that they would not take
the next seminar unless I
changed their grade.
I was told that in one class
with 550 students, 500 get As.
The instructions tell us that A
means outstanding and B supe
rior. I checked with the admin
istration and was told that 39
percent of students receive As.
One official said that grades
don't mean anything any more.
The general pattern is that
students take courses required
tor their major and then shop
around for electives in which
they can receive an A without
too much work. They are vic

tims of the system. I have
watched the assessment of fac
ulty by students since it began in
Berkeley in 1937, and it is ob
vious that there is a correlation
between the grades students re
ceive and their assessment of
the instructor.
But back to more substantive
issues. Discussions of interna
tional affairs on our campuses
are often little more than
diatribes in which the passion
displayed is in inverse propor
tion to the speaker's knowledge.
I have watched with disgust
loutish attacks on some of our
most respected specialists.
The Stanford Geography De
partment was abolished in 1963.
It had been established when a
grant to create language and
area programs was made cont
ingent on the provision of
courses in geography. Its de
mise came when, with an influx
of Ford Foundation funds, the
behavioral sciences and the
quantitative method swept the
universities of the United States
and of those countries where
Ford money was doing its thing.
Geography was dismissed as de
scriptive and unworthy of a uni
versity which boasted that it
was on the cutting edge, and cut
ting is much easier than creat

ing.
The crusade was led by a hu
manities professor who had
achieved some fame by his stud
ies of an author he pulled out of
the garbage can of history; the
poor man had no understanding
of the contemporary world. A
voice crying in the wilderness, I
protested, but the wilderness
was silent, except for nasty
growls from the Adminis
tration. Even the History de
partment, which should have
fought for the discipline without
which history makes no sense,
was deaf to appeals; history
was busy transforming itself
into a behavioral science.
Things are changing.
Fernand Braudel, whose The
Mediterranean Under Philip II
is a classic of pandisciplinary
humanistic history, listened to
the golden trumpets of the be
havioral sciences, and joined
the marching soldiers. Now, in
his latest book, On History, he
expresses his dismay at the de
struction of the old order in
which Marc Bloch's geographi
cal basis of history reflected the
tradition of great geographers
like Vidal de la Blache. Alas, in
France as in England, the
triumph of Marxists and struc
turalists like Louis Althusser
had ended the happy marriage
of two great disciplines, geo
graphy and history.
A change is coming. Scholars
are realizing that geography is
much more than a high-school
memorization of names. It is
the understanding of the space
relationship, which for contem
porary studies is more impor
tant than the understanding of
time relationship in the field of
history.
Historians feel uneasy about
the study of the present, for
which their traditional tools
were not made. Political scien
tists have almost lost their
sense of geography, and in only
a few institutions like Cal Tech
has a chair in political geogra
phy survived.
How can we resurrect geog
raphy? A refusal to admit mis
takes is alleged to be the sign of
a good administrator, but Stan
ford President Kennedy and his
group did not make the mistake.
Being warm, open-minded peo
ple, they could consider the
whole question anew. However,
Stanford has gone crazy about
replacing simple organizational
labels with baroque ones, so
"geography" would be too
simple a term. Moreover, a plan

to restore the geography depart
ment would have no sex appeal
for foundations.
How about "geopolitics?" An
excellent term, better than "po
litical geography," but tainted
by Nazi ideologists. So let us set
tle for "strategic studies,"
which means geography with all
its ramifications as applied to
our national needs. It is a fash
ionable term, although as a
simple soul I would prefer "ge
ography." At least "strategic
studies" would ensure that our
discussions of international
problems take into account hard
realities and our national needs.
Then our bright and nice stu
dents would be better equipped
for these discussions. Let us
stop dismissing geography as a
high-school subject. It is an es
sential component of studies
which are at least as com
plicated as cancer research or
nuclear physics. I am convinced
that our students would wel
come this new, or rather old,
dimension.
The "World in Crisis" sym
posia have shown that many stu
dents are eager for the kind of
information thus provided,
always with an array of maps on
the stage to stress the link be
tween geography and contem
porary affairs.
Another good sign is the
change in the Stanford Daily.
Years ago it was just another
college rag. Now it provides ex
cellent reporting on interna
tional affairs. The influx of the
students responsible for this
into the media may do much to
reverse the trend which has
brought us such superficial re
porting of the world's recent
crisis.

but there are good reasons for
