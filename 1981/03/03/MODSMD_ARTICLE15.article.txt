## Interventionists distort facts, ignore reason 
### 
In my last column, (Daily,
Feb. 12), I strongly criticized
the currently widespread desire
in this nation for foreign mili
tary intervention. I suggested
that, in many cases, the itch for
interventionism seems to rest
not on any rational arguments
but only on a childish inclination
to demonstrate machismo.
Since then, readers of the
Daily have been offered two at
tempts to refute this thesis.
These attempts are interesting
because they reveal so clearly
the way that interventionists
think.
Joyce Lucas Clark's response
(Daily, Feb. 19) to my earlier

column present some interest
ing perspectives on history.
For example, Clark refers to
"the plans that Hitler had for
the invasion of the U.S." In fact,
there is no real evidence that
Hitler had any serious plans for
an invasion of America. Stories
such as FDR's tale of imminent
Nazi assaults against Omaha
and St. Louis were simply prop
aganda myths promoted by the
Roosevelt administration to
whip up war fever among the
populace: Hitler wasn't the only
wartime ruler who knew how to
use the Big Lie!
Nor did the Nazis, as Clark
claims, come close to building

an atomic bomb: After the Ger
man defeat, Allied physicists
were amazed to discover what
miniscule progress the Nazis
had actually made in developing
the bomb.
Clark offers us Japan. Mexi
co, and Britain as examples of
foreign devils who have threat
ened the U.S. in the past. But a
reasoned analysis reveals that
the outbreak of war between
America and Japan during
World War II was the primary
fault not of the Japanese but of
the U.S. government.
Clark's implication that the
Mexican War resulted from
Mexico's desire to invade or
conquer the U.S. is ludicrous.
The Mexican War resulted from
the "Manifest Destiny" dreams
of American imperialists. Anti
imperialists of the era, such as
Daniel Webster and Abraham
Lincoln, opposed the war for
that reason. The purpose served
by that war was not the defense
of America but rather the
American conquest and annexa
tion of half of the territory of
Mexico.
Similarly, the Anglo-Ameri
can War of 1812 did not result, as
Clark implies, from English de
signs to destroy American free
dom. Rather, that war resulted
partly from an accident of poor
communications (the British
acceded to the central Ameri
can demand, but news of that
event reached America too late
to prevent war) and partly from
the desire of American ex
pansionists to conquer British
territory in Canada. For in
stance, Andrew Jackson called
for "the conquest of all the Brit
ish dominions upon the conti
nent of North America."
In short, none of Clark's his
torical examples stand up under
examination. Her claim that
America has, throughout its his
tory, constantly been threat
ened by foreign aggressors is re
futed by the facts.
Apparently, Clark's distor
tions of history stem from a
misconception shared by most
Americans — the conviction
that, at least before Vietnam,
America was in its dealings
with other nations an innocent

angel, an untouched virgin often
threatened but never threaten
ing others.
That common belief is a co
lossal myth sustained only by
Americans' determined refusal
to learn about or face up to their
own history.
The response of Bill Wray
(Daily, Feb. 17), who was the
particular subject of my earlier
criticism, acknowledges an "es
sential veracity" in my column
criticizing his advocacy of the
draft and foreign intervention,
but he complains that criticism
of his "playing soldier" was
mere derisory name-calling un
connected with my main argu
ment.
I'm sorry that he, and possi
bly other readers, missed my
point. If, as I argued, the exist
ing military establishment is
not devoted to defending Ameri
can freedom and is far larger
than is required to protect this
country, then perhaps Wray is,
as a matter of simple fact,
playing soldier for no good rea
son at taxpayers' expense.
Instead of presenting any
argument for interventionism,
the interventionists have been
content to repeat over and over
again the incontestable fact that
there are many evil and despot
ic regimes on this planet. How
ever, only "a puerile would-be
John Wayne" (to use Wray's
words) would believe that this
fact trivially implies that Amer
ican military intervention
abroad is either necessary or
beneficial.
Clark, Wray, and I all wish
America to be a great and free
nation. I, like Clark and Wray,
believe that America should
maintain an adequate defense,
that Americans have a moral
duty to aid in defending this
country should that ever prove
necessary, and that we owe a
debt of gratitude to all who
make serious sacrifices in de
fense of our freedom.
But unlike Clark and Wray, I
do not believe that these senti
ments justify ignorance or re
fusal to think. Wray's fantasies
of current threats by foreigners

to American freedom and
Clark's historical fantasies of
past foreign devils both dissolve
under serious and informed con
sideration.
The issues of war and peace
are too important to be left to
those who treat the historical
record like silly putty or to those
who substitute emotionalism
for reasoned argument. Until
the interventionists offer some
thing besides angry rhetoric and
incorrect history to back up
their position and until they re
spond to the detailed history to
back up their position and until
they respond to the detailed
arguments of opponents of in
terventionism, no sensible per

territory in Canada. For in
stance, Andrew Jackson called
for "the conquest of all the Brit
ish dominions upon the conti
nent of North America."
In short, none of Clark's his
torical examples stand up under
examination. Her claim that
America has, throughout its his
tory, constantly been threat
ened by foreign aggressors is re
futed by the facts.
Apparently, Clark's distor
tions of history stem from a
misconception shared by most
Americans — the conviction
that, at least before Vietnam,
America was in its dealings
with other nations an innocent

angel, an untouched virgin often
threatened but never threaten
ing others.
That common belief is a co
lossal myth sustained only by
Americans' determined refusal
to learn about or face up to their
own history.
The response of Bill Wray
(Daily, Feb. 17), who was the
particular subject of my earlier
criticism, acknowledges an "es
sential veracity" in my column
criticizing his advocacy of the
draft and foreign intervention,
but he complains that criticism
of his "playing soldier" was
mere derisory name-calling un
connected with my main argu
ment.
I'm sorry that he, and possi
bly other readers, missed my
point. If, as I argued, the exist
ing military establishment is
not devoted to defending Ameri
can freedom and is far larger
than is required to protect this
country, then perhaps Wray is,
as a matter of simple fact,
playing soldier for no good rea
son at taxpayers' expense.
Instead of presenting any
argument for interventionism,
the interventionists have been
content to repeat over and over
again the incontestable fact that
there are many evil and despot
ic regimes on this planet. How
ever, only "a puerile would-be
John Wayne" (to use Wray's
words) would believe that this
fact trivially implies that Amer
ican military intervention
abroad is either necessary or
beneficial.
Clark, Wray, and I all wish
America to be a great and free
nation. I, like Clark and Wray,
believe that America should
maintain an adequate defense,
that Americans have a moral
duty to aid in defending this
country should that ever prove
necessary, and that we owe a
debt of gratitude to all who
make serious sacrifices in de
fense of our freedom.
But unlike Clark and Wray, I
do not believe that these senti
ments justify ignorance or re
fusal to think. Wray's fantasies
of current threats by foreigners

to American freedom and
Clark's historical fantasies of
past foreign devils both dissolve
under serious and informed con
sideration.
The issues of war and peace
are too important to be left to
those who treat the historical
record like silly putty or to those
who substitute emotionalism
for reasoned argument. Until
the interventionists offer some
thing besides angry rhetoric and
incorrect history to back up
their position and until they re
spond to the detailed history to
back up their position and until
they respond to the detailed
arguments of opponents of in
terventionism, no sensible per
son can take their views serious

In my last column, (Daily,
Feb. 12), I strongly criticized
the currently widespread desire
in this nation for foreign mili
tary intervention. I suggested
that, in many cases, the itch for
interventionism seems to rest
not on any rational arguments
but only on a childish inclination
to demonstrate machismo.
Since then, readers of the
Daily have been offered two at
tempts to refute this thesis.
These attempts are interesting
because they reveal so clearly
the way that interventionists
think.
Joyce Lucas Clark's response
(Daily, Feb. 19) to my earlier

column present some interest
ing perspectives on history.
For example, Clark refers to
"the plans that Hitler had for
the invasion of the U.S." In fact,
there is no real evidence that
Hitler had any serious plans for
an invasion of America. Stories
such as FDR's tale of imminent
Nazi assaults against Omaha
and St. Louis were simply prop
aganda myths promoted by the
Roosevelt administration to
whip up war fever among the
populace: Hitler wasn't the only
wartime ruler who knew how to
use the Big Lie!
Nor did the Nazis, as Clark
claims, come close to building

an atomic bomb: After the Ger
man defeat, Allied physicists
were amazed to discover what
miniscule progress the Nazis
had actually made in developing
the bomb.
Clark offers us Japan. Mexi
co, and Britain as examples of
foreign devils who have threat
ened the U.S. in the past. But a
reasoned analysis reveals that
the outbreak of war between
America and Japan during
World War II was the primary
fault not of the Japanese but of
the U.S. government.
Clark's implication that the
Mexican War resulted from
Mexico's desire to invade or
conquer the U.S. is ludicrous.
The Mexican War resulted from
the "Manifest Destiny" dreams
of American imperialists. Anti
imperialists of the era, such as
Daniel Webster and Abraham
Lincoln, opposed the war for
that reason. The purpose served
by that war was not the defense
of America but rather the
American conquest and annexa
tion of half of the territory of
Mexico.
Similarly, the Anglo-Ameri
can War of 1812 did not result, as
Clark implies, from English de
signs to destroy American free
dom. Rather, that war resulted
partly from an accident of poor
communications (the British
acceded to the central Ameri
can demand, but news of that
event reached America too late
to prevent war) and partly from
the desire of American ex
pansionists to conquer British
territory in Canada. For in
stance, Andrew Jackson called
for "the conquest of all the Brit
ish dominions upon the conti
nent of North America."
In short, none of Clark's his
