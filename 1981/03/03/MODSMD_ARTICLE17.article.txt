Double standard?
After reading John Kosner's
commentary, "Freshman the
Key to Season" (Daily, Feb. 13),
I am compelled to question the
validity of two assertions made
in the final paragraph. First,
Kosner states emphatically that
"assorted athletic/academic
double standards that exist at
other top-echelon universities
like UCLA, Virginia, and
Georgetown will simply not
play here."
While I can offer no comment
on either UCLA or
Georgetown, I challenge
Kosner to produce his evidence
(if there is any) that such is the
state of affairs at the University
of Virginia. Undoubtedly,
Kosner feels that any team that
is ranked number one in the
country in college basketball
cannot possibly be maintaining
any degree of arademir ex
cellence among its members.
His belief probably stems from
the fact that the most prominent
member of Virginia's top
ranked team is seven feet four
inches tall, and as everyone

knows, a basketball player's In
telligence Quotient is indirectly
proportional to his height.
I hasten to remind Kosner
that Virginia was suffering
through its own "rebuilding"
years not so long ago. Well, they
just happened to achieve some
thing that the Stanford program
has not yet been able to do —
they 'rebuilt', carefully, slowly,
and successfully, with a great
deal of hard work — both on the
court and in the classroom.
The quality of the stu
dent/athlete at the University
of Virginia was, is, and always
will be above reproach from ill
informed and narrow-minded
upstarts who attempt to
cheapen the rewards for which
they (the student/athletes)
have worked so hard in order
that their own inefficiencies
might somehow be disguised.
Secondly, Kosner goes one
step further in stating that "the
kind of ballplayer who could
turn Stanford's program around
would much rather study NBA
green than study in Green."
That's a really witty comment.

It also demonstrates Kosner's
hopeless attitude about Stan
ford basketball. He degrades
not only the entire concept of
striving for excellence in sports,
but also each and every stu
dent/athlete at Stanford. The
notion that academic and athlet
ic excellence cannot possibly be
obtained simultaneously by any
individual or group of individ
uals is not only demoralizing but
insulting as well.
It is a fact that double stan
dards regarding athletics and
academics exists at many uni
versities throughout the United
States, and Kosner has the right
to explore and analyze publicly
any one of them he desires.
However, in the future, he
should simply keep to making
comments about those things
which he has some knowledge or
evidence. If he did, the rest of us
would be much better off, for
there in turn would not be very
much of his commentary to
read.
