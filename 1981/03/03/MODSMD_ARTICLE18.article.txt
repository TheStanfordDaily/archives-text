# 'It's a drinking town; it's a drinking culture'
## Alcohol on Capitol Hill 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — "What can I get you to drink,
Congressman? So glad you could come by. Please
come over and meet some of my good friends. We
need to discuss a little business with you for just a
minute."
It is a typical late afternoon for the harried
member of Congress, a veteran representative
from a Sunbelt state. He has not yet left the
marble halls of the Rayburn House Office Build
ing, but he is plunging into his third reception —
this one a lavish spread sponsored by a trade as
sociation with important ties with his district.
A gin and tonic appears, the fifth drink he has
been offered this day. The congressman takes a
deep sip and moves toward the group of busi
nessmen. Later, looking back on the afternoon, he
says:
"You're just a piece of meat in this business.
People are always pulling, pulling at you to do
something for them. A man needs to get off this
treadmill, and alcohol is often the easiest way to
escape."
The Sunbelt congressman is being unusually
candid about heavy congressional drinking, a sub
ject many prefer to avoid. Yet alcoholism, a ma
jor medical and social problem, is particularly se
rious among members of Congress. The relentless
and conflicting pressures of their jobs combine
with the Capitol Hill tradition of continual "so
cial" drinking to create an atmosphere that is un
usually conducive to alcoholism.
And excessive drinking among members of the
House and Senate can be particularly serious be
cause their actions affect the lives of so many peo
ple.
"I'm surprised we don't have more alcoholics
in Congress," Rep. Tom Coelho (D-Calif.) said re
cently. "There are so many opportunities for
booze around here."
Former Rep. Tom Rees (D-Calif.) agrees: "It
takes a lot of willpower to be in Congress. People
are always handing you a glass."
As in other occupations, it is impossible to de
termine the exact percentage of alcoholics among
the nation's lawmakers. Informed estimates by
alcoholism specialists and by congressmen them
selves, however, put the minimum at the national
average — about 7 percent of the population — and
range to a maximum of more than 20 percent.
One measure of the problem is the increasing
frequency with which members of Congress, and
their wives, have been driven to admit their ad
diction to alcohol, and to announce that they are
seeking treatment.
"And those congressional alcoholics you learn
about through the press are only a small per
centage of the total," William Terwilliger, a long
time counsellor of Washington alcoholics, said.
In recent years, former Rep. Wilbur Mills (D-
Ark.)'and former Sen. Herman Talmadge (D-
Ga.) were two prominent lawmakers who sought
medical help for alcoholism. Other congressmen

recently have blamed alcohol abuse for their in
volvements in homosexual acts and in bribe-tak
ing in the Abscam scandal.
Contributing to the problem for congressmen is
the fact that liquor is so close at hand. Whereas 20
years ago members of the House and Senate had
to travel to a downtown hotel or a Georgetown
suite for a cocktail party, they now have opened
up their reception rooms and other facilities on
Capitol Hill to party-throwing lobbyists.
"It used to be that these lobbies had to hire their
own hall," Rep. Thomas Ashley (D-Ohio) said.
Ashley, who served in the House from 1955 until
this year, added "Now they get rooms right in the
Rayburn House Office Building. They give you
only the finest in food, smoked Irish salmon and
caviar, and they're not serving cheap Scotch, it's
all Chivas Regal and better."
Whatever the proportion of alcoholics on
Capitol Hill, few say that congressional alcohol
ism is a trivial health problem.
"The difference is that if you have an alcoholic
in Congress, the results of that disease are trans
mitted to more people than in any other capacity I
can think of. . said Harold Hughes, a former
Democratic senator from lowa. "Congressional
alcoholism needs more attention because their
decisions have far more effect on peoples' lives
and their safety than decisions elsewhere."
Ten years ago, largely through the forceful in
itiative of Hughes, a nondrinking alcoholic, Con
gress passed legislation requiring every federal
agency to establish an alcohol counseling and re
habilitation program for its employees. The na
tion's lawmakers, however, did not include them
selves.
"Congressmen still don't have an alcoholism
program, and they certainly need one," said
Hughes, who also is concerned about alcoholism
and the lack of an aid program for the thousands of
congressional staff members.
In this capital, the cocktail party is an extension
of the business day that is often large, tense and
anonymous. In that situation, many people drink
more than they usually would, to anesthetize per
sonal unease, experts say.
Also, the congressman rarely has the restrain
ing discipline of having to buy his own drinks.
"Nine out of 10 Congressmen drink. ... I can
tick off the guys in the House who don't," former
Rep. Ashley said.
The great majority of these drinkers, of course,
are not alcoholics. On the national level, 70 per
cent ot Americans 18 years and over reported that
they drink alcohol, up from 55 percent in 1958, ac
cording to a recent Gallup Poll. The survey re
ported that 75 percent of men drink, and 81 per
cent of Americans who have a college background
drink.
Experts point out that alcoholism is common in
many sectors of Washington life — in the military,
in the top levels of the executive branch, on Em
bassy Row among foreign service officers.
