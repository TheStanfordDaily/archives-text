# Human guinea pig tests regulated
## 
### Alex Locke 
Before surgeons at the Medical Cen
ter got the. go-ahead recently for their
first human heart-lung transplant,
they had to win approval from the
University Committee for the Protec
tion of Human Subjects in Research, a
watchdog organization which eval
uates risks and benefits of experi
ments involving human beings.
At Stanford, as well as nearly every
U.S. medical research institution, hu
man experimentation is subject to
close scrutiny. The goal is to protect
human subjects in experiments where
the side effects of a new drug or sur
gical procedure are unknown.
Human experimentation was not
always as regulated as it is today.
Not long ago, doctors were free to
try anything they felt would be useful.
But in the aftermath of World War 11,
the research climate changed. The
world was outraged when the Nuren
berg Nazi war criminal trials exposed
widespread physical abuse of Nazi
concentration camp victims used as
human guinea pigs.
The publicity of the Nurenberg
Trials led to the Declaration of Helsin
ki (1961), which, according to Medical
Center Chaplain Ernie Young,
marked the first step toward legal
protection of human subjects.
Although many medical institutions
established review boards in the '60s,
they were not required by law until
1974. In 1973 an experiment in
Tuskegee, Ala., shocked the nation.
Begun in the '30s, the study involved
long-term observation of a group of
black men with syphilis, who did not
receive treatment. At that time, peni
cillin was not yet available, but the
study was continued long after the
drug was proven safe and effective.
Public outcry over the senseless
suffering and death of these men re
sulted in the National Research Act of
1974, requiring all research in federal
ly-funded institutions to be considered
by an "institutional review board."
"Stanford is an important medical
center in developing new treatments
for people," says Dr. Philip Berger,
chairman of Stanford's Committee for
the Protection of Human Subjects in
Research. With 70 research proposals
considered a month, the "Human Sub
jects committee'' plays a significant
role in the professionals direction of
medical research. The committee,
made up of scientific, legal and public
service backgrounds, attempts to
"make sure human subjects are pro
tected while making sure nobody is de
nied potentially beneficial treatment.
The second consideration applies in
this case," Berger said, referring to
the heart-lung transplant.
The human subjects eligible for the
heart-lung transplant "have no treat
ment left. They will die without the op
eration," in the words of Dr. Keith
Marton, coordinator of a weekly semi
nar entitled' 'Controversies in Current
Medical Practice'' at the Med Center.
Central to the issue of human ex
perimentation is the concept of "in
formed consent." All experimental

subjects must sign a form describing
the study, its risks and benefits, alter
native procedures, and informing
them of their right to witndraw trom
the study at any time, without "any
element of force, fraud, deceit,
duress, coercion or undue influence on
the subject's decision."
Prisoners, mental incompetents
and children present especially dif
ficult problems in obtaining "in
formed consent."
In the past, prisoners were used ex
tensively, particularly in drug studies.
Elaborate safeguards now exist to
ensure that the prisoners who partici
pate do so voluntarily. As a result, few
medical studies now involve prisoners
as subjects.
"Informed consent" poses a
challeging problem in psychiatric
studies, according to Young, because
"the mentally disturbed are by defini
tion incompetent to decide. It's a real
'Catch 22.' "
When the physician is well ac
quainted with the patient's value sys
tem, the doctor does what he thinks is
in the patient's best interest. Doctors
sometimes attempt reasonable ex
perimental approaches, without per
mission, but according to Young, any
thing involving surgery requires the
patient's consent.
Children sometimes have unique
medical problems which require them
to be subjects of experimental treat
ment. Until age seven, according to
Young, parent consent alone suffices,
but after seven, the child must be con
sulted as well.
Often parents "insist on treatment
after it no longer makes sense," com
mented Young, though he noted a gain
of one or two years in the life of a child
can be very significant.
Dr. Marton, whose research mostly
involves questionnaires, asserted that
informed consent hampers research.
"Sometimes 'informed consent' is so
laborious it deters useful studies."
He claimed the form's legalistic
language, especially the compensa
tion clause holding the hospital liable
for study-related injuries, frightens
subjects away from riskless studies.
Verifying safety poses a significant
problem for researchers because no
model system exactly duplicates hu
man physiological mechanisms.
A study must make "scientific
sense," according to Marton. It "must
have justification of significant bene
fit to society." The belief that the pro
cedure will be beneficial must have
"proven statistical grounds," accord
ing to chaplain Young, although some
risks are not easily detected.
Risk/benefit analyses are a major
consideration of "human subjects"
committees. In addition to physical in
jury, psychological injury and the
potential for violation of a patient's
rights must be considered.
Lying to the subject, as often oc
curred in studies involving
"placebos," constitutes psychological
injury. Placebos are procedures or
drugs which have no physiological im
pact but may have a psychological ef

feet if the patient is convinced they
are effective (e.g. sugar pills). The
"placebo effect" accounts for a per
ceived lessening ul symptoms in one
third of all patients tested, from head
aches to heart-attacks, according to
Dr. Marton.
Under "informed consent" require
ments, subjects are told there is a 50
percent chance of receiving a placebo.
In cases where an effective standard
procedure exists, "placebos" are not
permitted and patients receiving stan
dard treatment form the basis for
comparison.
As the "patient's advocate," human
subjects committees must ensure the
subject's right to privacy, a sensitive
issue in studies involving surveys and
chart reviews. At Stanford, chart re
views are permitted, provided the pa
tient remains anonymous.
Human Subjects Committees, ac
cording to Young, "have no monitor
ing mechanism. In theory there is no
way to be sure that researchers are
doing what they said they'd do" with
regard to informed consent.
At Stanford, "peer review" keeps
researchers honest and "abuses are
rare," Young said. A 1978 Science
Magazine study entitled Research In
volving Human Subjects supports his
observations and advocates training
researchers in communication skills
to minimize such misunderstandings.
"There is no doubt that the human
subjects committee stands in the way
of scientific progress," Marton said.
"But it should."
Overzealous scientists cannot be
eliminated "but regulations help
make it clear that such behavior won't
be tolerated," Marton said.

medical studies now involve prisoners
as subjects.
"Informed consent" poses a
challeging problem in psychiatric
studies, according to Young, because
"the mentally disturbed are by defini
tion incompetent to decide. It's a real
'Catch 22.' "
When the physician is well ac
quainted with the patient's value sys
tem, the doctor does what he thinks is
in the patient's best interest. Doctors
sometimes attempt reasonable ex
perimental approaches, without per
mission, but according to Young, any
thing involving surgery requires the
patient's consent.
Children sometimes have unique
medical problems which require them
to be subjects of experimental treat
ment. Until age seven, according to
Young, parent consent alone suffices,
but after seven, the child must be con
sulted as well.
Often parents "insist on treatment
after it no longer makes sense," com
mented Young, though he noted a gain
of one or two years in the life of a child
can be very significant.
Dr. Marton, whose research mostly
involves questionnaires, asserted that
informed consent hampers research.
"Sometimes 'informed consent' is so
laborious it deters useful studies."
He claimed the form's legalistic
language, especially the compensa
tion clause holding the hospital liable
for study-related injuries, frightens
subjects away from riskless studies.
Verifying safety poses a significant
problem for researchers because no
model system exactly duplicates hu
man physiological mechanisms.
A study must make "scientific
sense," according to Marton. It "must
have justification of significant bene
fit to society." The belief that the pro
cedure will be beneficial must have
"proven statistical grounds," accord
ing to chaplain Young, although some
risks are not easily detected.
Risk/benefit analyses are a major
consideration of "human subjects"
committees. In addition to physical in
jury, psychological injury and the
potential for violation of a patient's
rights must be considered.
Lying to the subject, as often oc
curred in studies involving
"placebos," constitutes psychological
injury. Placebos are procedures or
drugs which have no physiological im
pact but may have a psychological ef

feet if the patient is convinced they
are effective (e.g. sugar pills). The
"placebo effect" accounts for a per
ceived lessening ul symptoms in one
third of all patients tested, from head
aches to heart-attacks, according to
Dr. Marton.
Under "informed consent" require
ments, subjects are told there is a 50
percent chance of receiving a placebo.
In cases where an effective standard
procedure exists, "placebos" are not
permitted and patients receiving stan
dard treatment form the basis for
comparison.
As the "patient's advocate," human
subjects committees must ensure the
subject's right to privacy, a sensitive
issue in studies involving surveys and
chart reviews. At Stanford, chart re
views are permitted, provided the pa
tient remains anonymous.
Human Subjects Committees, ac
cording to Young, "have no monitor
ing mechanism. In theory there is no
way to be sure that researchers are
doing what they said they'd do" with
regard to informed consent.
At Stanford, "peer review" keeps
researchers honest and "abuses are
rare," Young said. A 1978 Science
Magazine study entitled Research In
volving Human Subjects supports his
observations and advocates training
researchers in communication skills
to minimize such misunderstandings.
"There is no doubt that the human
subjects committee stands in the way
of scientific progress," Marton said.
"But it should."
Overzealous scientists cannot be
eliminated "but regulations help
make it clear that such behavior won't
be tolerated," Marton said.
Before surgeons at the Medical Cen
ter got the. go-ahead recently for their
first human heart-lung transplant,
they had to win approval from the
University Committee for the Protec
tion of Human Subjects in Research, a
watchdog organization which eval
uates risks and benefits of experi
ments involving human beings.
At Stanford, as well as nearly every
U.S. medical research institution, hu
man experimentation is subject to
close scrutiny. The goal is to protect
human subjects in experiments where
the side effects of a new drug or sur
gical procedure are unknown.
Human experimentation was not
always as regulated as it is today.
Not long ago, doctors were free to
try anything they felt would be useful.
But in the aftermath of World War 11,
the research climate changed. The
world was outraged when the Nuren
berg Nazi war criminal trials exposed
widespread physical abuse of Nazi
concentration camp victims used as
human guinea pigs.
The publicity of the Nurenberg
Trials led to the Declaration of Helsin
ki (1961), which, according to Medical
Center Chaplain Ernie Young,
marked the first step toward legal
protection of human subjects.
Although many medical institutions
established review boards in the '60s,
they were not required by law until
1974. In 1973 an experiment in
Tuskegee, Ala., shocked the nation.
Begun in the '30s, the study involved
long-term observation of a group of
black men with syphilis, who did not
receive treatment. At that time, peni
cillin was not yet available, but the
study was continued long after the
drug was proven safe and effective.
Public outcry over the senseless
suffering and death of these men re
sulted in the National Research Act of
1974, requiring all research in federal
ly-funded institutions to be considered
by an "institutional review board."
"Stanford is an important medical
center in developing new treatments
for people," says Dr. Philip Berger,
chairman of Stanford's Committee for
the Protection of Human Subjects in
Research. With 70 research proposals
considered a month, the "Human Sub
jects committee'' plays a significant
role in the professionals direction of
medical research. The committee,
made up of scientific, legal and public
service backgrounds, attempts to
"make sure human subjects are pro
tected while making sure nobody is de
nied potentially beneficial treatment.
The second consideration applies in
this case," Berger said, referring to
the heart-lung transplant.
The human subjects eligible for the
heart-lung transplant "have no treat
ment left. They will die without the op
eration," in the words of Dr. Keith
Marton, coordinator of a weekly semi
nar entitled' 'Controversies in Current
Medical Practice'' at the Med Center.
Central to the issue of human ex
perimentation is the concept of "in
formed consent." All experimental

subjects must sign a form describing
the study, its risks and benefits, alter
native procedures, and informing
them of their right to witndraw trom
the study at any time, without "any
element of force, fraud, deceit,
duress, coercion or undue influence on
the subject's decision."
Prisoners, mental incompetents
and children present especially dif
ficult problems in obtaining "in
formed consent."
In the past, prisoners were used ex
tensively, particularly in drug studies.
Elaborate safeguards now exist to
ensure that the prisoners who partici
