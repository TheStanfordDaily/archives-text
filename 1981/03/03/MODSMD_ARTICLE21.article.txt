# Black history in medicine subject of talk

### J. Raymond Mills 
In a lecture presenting a
black historical perspective on
medicine, Dr. Richard King,
president of the California
chapter of Black Psychiatrists
of America asserted that "to
break the barriers of mental
slavery today, those of African
descent must learn the truth of
our past great scientific
achievements.''

4 A frican science is in many fundamental
ways different than Western science — it
emphasizes a holistic approach, a
combination of feelings and logic, material
and ideal, and the scientific and religious.'

King, addressing an audience
made up primarily of black
medical and pre-med students
in Ujamaa on Friday, related in
formation indicating that early
African man was the origin of
many so-called "Western scien
tific advances". His program
was a presentation of the Black
Community Services Center's
"Black Liberation Month" ac
tivities.
"Don't be led astray by il
lusions of modern technology
presented as if they were a final
word." he warned. "One must
explore a historical background
to find the true origins of such
knowledge."
King's presentation, entitled
"Melanin, the Pineal Gland,

Mental Illness and African Peo
ple,'' centered around research
he has done which reveals "a
profound, advanced, ancient
and African scientific knowl
edge of pineal gland anatomy,
which has a dramatic rela
tionship to sunlight and
darkness, the unconscious,
ascension and melanin or skin
color. 5 '
King blamed the misin

terpretation of symbols found
on ancient artifacts for creating
a "vast stolen legacy" which
hides the fact that "the parame
ters of today's so-called
Western science are actually
African."
Scientists of an "ancient
African empire" who stayed in
training for up to 40 years and
accumulated knowledge
equivalent to several Ph.D.s
were well versed in physiology,
anatomy, drug use and many
other medical skills, King said.
He cited papyrus journals of
Egyptian medicine dating back
to 1600 B.C. in support of his the
ory.
"African science is in many
fundamental ways different

than Western science," King
said. "It emphasizes a holistte
approach, a combination of feel
ings and logic, material and ide
al, and the scientific and re
ligious."
"It is clearly evident that
Africans were fully aware of
pineal anatomy," he said, "for
they depicted the pineal as a ser
pent, Uraeus, in the middle of
the forehead, the anatomical
site of the pineal gland."
King pointed out that the
same Uraeus symbol appears on
the famed gold mask of the an
cient African King
Tutankhamen Tut that recently
toured the country.
Throughout his two-hour
presentation King encouraged
his audience to seek out their
own answers to questions of
black medical history. "Librar
ies are the key to unlock mental
slavery," he said.
"The idea that one can't find a
top-notch article confirming
what I've just said in a major

American medical journal is a
complete illusion," King com
mented as he continuously
quoted his data sources. "Un
fortunately much of this poign
ant information is hidden away
in rare book sections of univer
sity libraries."
"True freedom has not been
achieved today because African
people and their descendants
are virtually excommunicated
from their cultures; their
"souls," he said.
King rejected the idea that
anger about the "stolen legacy"
of African science must turn to
bitterness. "One can't help but
get angry after learning about
the exploitation of black sci
ence," King said, "but anger
should move you to a point of re
sponsible action."
"The test is whether you will
take this knowledge into your
own hands. The dream is real,
the failure to make it manifest
is the unreality," King con
cluded.

4 A frican science is in many fundamental
ways different than Western science — it
emphasizes a holistic approach, a
combination of feelings and logic, material
and ideal, and the scientific and religious.'

King, addressing an audience
made up primarily of black
medical and pre-med students
in Ujamaa on Friday, related in
formation indicating that early
African man was the origin of
many so-called "Western scien
tific advances". His program
was a presentation of the Black
Community Services Center's
"Black Liberation Month" ac
tivities.
"Don't be led astray by il
lusions of modern technology
presented as if they were a final
word." he warned. "One must
explore a historical background
to find the true origins of such
knowledge."
King's presentation, entitled
"Melanin, the Pineal Gland,

Mental Illness and African Peo
ple,'' centered around research
he has done which reveals "a
profound, advanced, ancient
and African scientific knowl
edge of pineal gland anatomy,
which has a dramatic rela
tionship to sunlight and
darkness, the unconscious,
ascension and melanin or skin
color. 5 '
King blamed the misin

terpretation of symbols found
on ancient artifacts for creating
a "vast stolen legacy" which
hides the fact that "the parame
ters of today's so-called
Western science are actually
African."
Scientists of an "ancient
African empire" who stayed in
training for up to 40 years and
accumulated knowledge
equivalent to several Ph.D.s
were well versed in physiology,
anatomy, drug use and many
other medical skills, King said.
He cited papyrus journals of
Egyptian medicine dating back
to 1600 B.C. in support of his the
ory.
"African science is in many
fundamental ways different

than Western science," King
said. "It emphasizes a holistte
approach, a combination of feel
ings and logic, material and ide
al, and the scientific and re
ligious."
"It is clearly evident that
Africans were fully aware of
pineal anatomy," he said, "for
they depicted the pineal as a ser
pent, Uraeus, in the middle of
the forehead, the anatomical
site of the pineal gland."
King pointed out that the
same Uraeus symbol appears on
the famed gold mask of the an
cient African King
Tutankhamen Tut that recently
toured the country.
Throughout his two-hour
presentation King encouraged
his audience to seek out their
own answers to questions of
black medical history. "Librar
ies are the key to unlock mental
slavery," he said.
"The idea that one can't find a
top-notch article confirming
what I've just said in a major

American medical journal is a
complete illusion," King com
mented as he continuously
quoted his data sources. "Un
fortunately much of this poign
ant information is hidden away
in rare book sections of univer
sity libraries."
"True freedom has not been
achieved today because African
people and their descendants
are virtually excommunicated
from their cultures; their
"souls," he said.
King rejected the idea that
anger about the "stolen legacy"
of African science must turn to
bitterness. "One can't help but
get angry after learning about
the exploitation of black sci
ence," King said, "but anger
should move you to a point of re
sponsible action."
"The test is whether you will
take this knowledge into your
own hands. The dream is real,
the failure to make it manifest
is the unreality," King con
cluded.
