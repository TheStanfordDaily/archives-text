## Lillian Hellman goes a-crusading in 'The Forest' 
### Jiri Weiss 
American Conservatory
Theatre's production of Lillian
Hellman's play Another Part of
the Forest is not memorable.
This is not ACT's fault ; the fault
lies with Hellman's one
dimensional characters.
Another Part of the Forest is
a sequel to the very successful
Little Foxes, also featured in
ACT's program this season.
Like most sequels it does not
live up to its predecessor.
Set in Alabama in 1880, the
play deals with the intrigues of
the Hubbard family —the same
family portrayed in Little Foxes
— as they lived twenty years
prior to the time of Little Foxes.
Hellman contrasts the Hub
bards, the self-professed wave
of the future for the South, with
the Bagtry family, im

poverished old Southern
aristocrats who have to come
begging for a loan. Here we
have the old idealistic South, un
able to function in the new age,
versus the new and ruthless
pragmatists. Cotton is out,
greed is in.
Underneath the cultured
Southern veneer, however, the
Hubbards are no better then
brutes. Family members are
pitted against one another: son
against son, son against daugh
ter, and everyone against
Marcus Hubbard, the tyrannical
father. There are hints of patri
cide, matricide and even some
incest.
Greed is rampant. Marcus
Hubbard rules his family with
his wallet: everyone in the Hub
bard family (except for his wife
who does not know what is going

on most of the time) is after his
money. Old Hubbard has plenty
of it, too, little of it gotten legal
ly; as it turns out, his fortune
was made by profiteering dur
ing the Civil War.
Marcus Hubbard controls ev
erything around him; he con
trols his family and, by a stroke
of luck, has the local old
aristocracy eating out of his
hand. The only thing that Hub
bard does not have is a good rep
utation.
Family conflict comes to a
head when Hubbard plans to
kick both his sons out of the
house because they have been
deceiving him. The tables turn
when Ben discovers incriminat
ing evidence about his father's
crimes and blackmails him into
turning over the family fortune.
The play is a deeply moral

one, and borders on the cliche
and the banal. Evil is evil and
good is good: there are no
shades in between. In spite of
his sense of humor, Marcus
Hubbard is purely evil; in con
trast, his wife Lavinia is a com
pletely innocent creature. In
Hellman's clumsy hands. Hub
bard becomes a callous nouveau
rich, full of greed and com
pletely devoid of remorse or
compassion, As a Nnr York
Times critic wrote of the play
when it first opened on Broad
way in 1946, "The Hubbards
work so hard to illustrate Miss
Hellman's point that they defeat
it."
There are, nevertheless,
some very fine performances in
ACT's production. Julia
Fletcher is warm and charming
as the innocent young Birdie

Bagtry, the young aristocrat
who is forced to swallow her
pride and beg for a loan to pay
her workers and send her ideal
istic brother, Captain John
Bagtry (played by John Hut
ton i, to Brazil.
Lauren Klein plays a wonder
fully comic whore who is sincer
ely loved by the younger of the
Hubbard sons, Marcus, and
Anne Lawder does a superb job
as the guilt-ridden, repentant
wife of Marcus Hubbard.
Lavinia Regina Hubbard was
not as well-casted: Hellman
meant Regina to be a young girl
of 20. something which Barbara
Dirickson definitely is not.
The sets by Ralph Funicello
are. as always, professional —
as is everything else in the pro
duction.

the Forest is not memorable.
This is not ACT's fault ; the fault
lies with Hellman's one
dimensional characters.
Another Part of the Forest is
a sequel to the very successful
Little Foxes, also featured in
ACT's program this season.
Like most sequels it does not
live up to its predecessor.
Set in Alabama in 1880, the
play deals with the intrigues of
the Hubbard family —the same
family portrayed in Little Foxes
— as they lived twenty years
prior to the time of Little Foxes.
Hellman contrasts the Hub
bards, the self-professed wave
of the future for the South, with
the Bagtry family, im

poverished old Southern
aristocrats who have to come
begging for a loan. Here we
have the old idealistic South, un
able to function in the new age,
versus the new and ruthless
pragmatists. Cotton is out,
greed is in.
Underneath the cultured
Southern veneer, however, the
Hubbards are no better then
brutes. Family members are
pitted against one another: son
against son, son against daugh
ter, and everyone against
Marcus Hubbard, the tyrannical
father. There are hints of patri
cide, matricide and even some
incest.
Greed is rampant. Marcus
Hubbard rules his family with
his wallet: everyone in the Hub
bard family (except for his wife
who does not know what is going

on most of the time) is after his
money. Old Hubbard has plenty
of it, too, little of it gotten legal
ly; as it turns out, his fortune
was made by profiteering dur
ing the Civil War.
Marcus Hubbard controls ev
erything around him; he con
trols his family and, by a stroke
of luck, has the local old
aristocracy eating out of his
hand. The only thing that Hub
bard does not have is a good rep
utation.
Family conflict comes to a
head when Hubbard plans to
kick both his sons out of the
house because they have been
deceiving him. The tables turn
when Ben discovers incriminat
ing evidence about his father's
crimes and blackmails him into
turning over the family fortune.
The play is a deeply moral

one, and borders on the cliche
and the banal. Evil is evil and
good is good: there are no
shades in between. In spite of
his sense of humor, Marcus
Hubbard is purely evil; in con
trast, his wife Lavinia is a com
pletely innocent creature. In
Hellman's clumsy hands. Hub
bard becomes a callous nouveau
rich, full of greed and com
pletely devoid of remorse or
compassion, As a Nnr York
Times critic wrote of the play
when it first opened on Broad
way in 1946, "The Hubbards
work so hard to illustrate Miss
Hellman's point that they defeat
it."
There are, nevertheless,
some very fine performances in
ACT's production. Julia
Fletcher is warm and charming
as the innocent young Birdie

Bagtry, the young aristocrat
who is forced to swallow her
pride and beg for a loan to pay
her workers and send her ideal
istic brother, Captain John
Bagtry (played by John Hut
ton i, to Brazil.
Lauren Klein plays a wonder
fully comic whore who is sincer
ely loved by the younger of the
Hubbard sons, Marcus, and
Anne Lawder does a superb job
as the guilt-ridden, repentant
wife of Marcus Hubbard.
Lavinia Regina Hubbard was
not as well-casted: Hellman
meant Regina to be a young girl
of 20. something which Barbara
Dirickson definitely is not.
The sets by Ralph Funicello
are. as always, professional —
as is everything else in the pro
duction.
