# 'At the Savoy' it ain't Ain't Misbehavin',' but it still swings
## 
### Geoffrey Mandel 
Despite the intriguing title,
Stompin' at the Savoy, a new
revue at the On Broad
*way Theatre in San Francisco,
. turns out to be a sort of second
rate Ain't Misbehavin' — and
it's really too bad, when you
consider how many good things
this production has going for it.
The best thing about the show is
clearly the music: sixteen
nightclub blues numbers by
Gershwin, Ellington, Nat
"King" Cole, Dorothy Fields
and others, all friendly and fa
miliar. Equally successful is the
atmosphere — the Club Savoy
that set designer Steven Fischer
has created at the On Broadway
fairly bursts with art deco
palms and the glitter of sequins,
and Jeffrey N. Palmer's cos
tumes, (low-cut gowns in bright
primary colors and dazzling
white suits that seem to lend a
grotesque, puppetlike quality to
the actors) are perfect for this
fictional 1930s nightspot. And
then there's Harold Nicholas,
the star of the show and veteran
of such screen musicals as
Stormy Weather and The
Pirate, and co-star with the
likes of Lena Home, Bojangles,
Gene Kelly and Judy Garland.
As the quick-stepping, wise
cracking Hal Wilson, headliner
at the Club Savoy, Nicholas
projects the same lovable
burlesque sexuality that Mickey
Rooney did in Sugar Babies.
Like Rooney, his age, small
stature and apparent lack of ac
ting ability seem to strengthen
rather than detract from his ap
peal — there is something so jol
ly about these good-natured dir
ty old men who are threatening
neither to men nor to women.

Nicholas plays his role for all
it's worth, panting wildly after
all the female characters, as
they undulate about the stage in
their sparkling silk wrappers.
Another of the show's strong
points is Ron Stacker Thomp
son's innovative direction and
choreography. Thompson also
plays the role of Rick, the glib
and vaguely satanic Master of
Ceremonies, and from this dual
position seems to control the
festivities with the omniscience
of a diabolical ringmaster: it's
hard to imagine anything going
on at the Club Savoy that the
mocking, self-satisfied Rick
doesn't know about. Thompson
is well aware that the show,
billed as "a Musical Reminis
cence" (in some press handouts
as a Musical Reminisence), is
really nothing more than a
flimsy excuse to present the mu
sical numbers; and as long as
someone on stage is singing or
dancing, Thompson remains
very much in command. With
his ringmaster shrewdness, he
knows exactly how long it will
take the audience to get bored
with a particular musical style,
tempo or performer, and is
careful to alternate fast num
bers with slow ones, group num
bers with solos, dance numbers
with nightclub songs, and just
when interest starts to lag again
. . . wham! Another comic
number.
The first three numbers of the
second act are a good example
of Thompson's almost
Vaudeville-like technique.
Thompson himself, as a white
suited Rick, starts off with a
seductively slow bump-and
grind version of "On the Good
Ship Lollipop," and gives new

meaning to the line "hop on and
take a ride on my chocolate
bar." Then we have an ex
cruciating performance of
Billie Holiday's "It's the Mood
That I'm In," played for laughs
in a tuneless, screeching voice
by supposedly drunken society
matron (Biance Thornton). The
showman in Thompsan knows
damn well that he better follow
up such frippery with a real
show-stopper, and he gives us
Harold Nicholas singing

Gershwin's "Lady Be Good"
like an Ella Fitzgerald record
played at 78 rpm. Nicholas
skims over about two-thirds of
the lyrics, and his "lady be
good" comes out more like
"laybeguh" — but we can't help
feeling that if our ears could
keep up with his voice, we'd be
able to hear every word. Un
fortunately, Nicholas then goes
into a self-indulgent scat ex
change with the drummer
(Gaylord Birch), while the bass

continues to play along at three
times normal tempo. Although
the audience chuckles good-na
turedly at Nicholas' imitations
of drum rolls and cymbals
(glub-glub-glub and binka-binka
respectively), it's one of those
routines where you feel you're
required to laugh only because
the performer is making such a
fool of himself on stage.
Yet Harold Nicholas, for all
his faults, is the unchallenged
star of the show. T. Baomi Butts

(what a name!) as Sal, Nich
olas' long-time main squeeze, is
at least tolerable, but Mwanza
Furaha and Cle Thompson (a
token white), as visiting
singers, are absolutely awful,
screeching and pawing the air
like Macbethian witches. Also
quite bad are Michael L.
Brown and Biance Thornston as
a mismatched couple spending
an evening out at the club.
Brown simply has no acting or
singing talent, and Thornton's
idea of acting is to affect an an
noying unintelligible Eleanor
Roosevelt voice all through the
first act. It's a nice surprise,
however, to find that Thornton
has a voice after all when she
launches into "My Man" near
the end of the show. Hardly
worth mentioning are the two
young ladies billed as The Choc
olate Kisses (Linda Goodrich
and Paula McCullum): as
Thompson explains, they are
"sweet, brown, and well
wrapped."
This seems to be Thompson's
main problem. His ring
master's instincts are good, and
he knows when it's time to bring
in something new, but his circus
is only as good as the per
formers and their material.
Just as Nicholas rises far above
most of the other performers,
the musical numbers simply put
to shame the flimsy, unfunny
stuff that passes for dialogue.
Like the Broadway musical
■12nd Street, no one is credited
with the show's book, and for
good reasons: who would admit
to writing the embarrassing
one-liners and blatant sexual in
nuendo that, rather than filling
the dead space between musical

numbers, seem to contribute to
the vacuum?
But if you can survive the
wasteland between production
numbers, many of them are
worth the wait. Director
Thompson's forte is clearly ap
proaching the music, stuff that
is familiar to most of the au
dience, from new directions,
and taking liberties with the
tempo, lyrics, and in some
cases, the context in which it is
performed. For example,
Gershwin's "Someone to Watch
over Me" is mouthed by Madge,
but is really sung by Sal at her
table (get it? Sal is the only who
is really pining for Hal); and
when Sal does a slow version of
Ella Fitzgerald's "A-Tisket, A-
Tasket." she throws in a line
about her "sweet brown
basket," just so we'll know that
she really means Hal. An ex
treme example is Madge and
Gloria's 1940s version of "I
Need a Little Sugar in My
Bowl." which is already fairly
explicit without the emphasis
placed on lines like, "I need a
little hot dog . . . between my
rolls."
The fun part of the show is
waiting to see what new
wrinkles Thompson will give to
the next number, and although
you may be slightly appalled at
some of his twists (blues purists
will certainly be aghast at some
of the carryings-on), they re
almost always entertaining. Af
ter all, one never knows, do one?
The show plays Tuesday
through Friday at 8 p.m., and
Saturday at 8 and 10 p.m. For

The cast of 'Stompin' at the Savoy.'
Despite the intriguing title,
Stompin' at the Savoy, a new
revue at the On Broad
*way Theatre in San Francisco,
. turns out to be a sort of second
rate Ain't Misbehavin' — and
it's really too bad, when you
consider how many good things
this production has going for it.
The best thing about the show is
clearly the music: sixteen
nightclub blues numbers by
Gershwin, Ellington, Nat
"King" Cole, Dorothy Fields
and others, all friendly and fa
miliar. Equally successful is the
atmosphere — the Club Savoy
that set designer Steven Fischer
has created at the On Broadway
fairly bursts with art deco
palms and the glitter of sequins,
and Jeffrey N. Palmer's cos
tumes, (low-cut gowns in bright
primary colors and dazzling
white suits that seem to lend a
grotesque, puppetlike quality to
the actors) are perfect for this
fictional 1930s nightspot. And
then there's Harold Nicholas,
the star of the show and veteran
of such screen musicals as
Stormy Weather and The
Pirate, and co-star with the
likes of Lena Home, Bojangles,
Gene Kelly and Judy Garland.
As the quick-stepping, wise
cracking Hal Wilson, headliner
at the Club Savoy, Nicholas
projects the same lovable
burlesque sexuality that Mickey
Rooney did in Sugar Babies.
Like Rooney, his age, small
stature and apparent lack of ac
ting ability seem to strengthen
rather than detract from his ap
peal — there is something so jol
ly about these good-natured dir
ty old men who are threatening
neither to men nor to women.

Nicholas plays his role for all
it's worth, panting wildly after
all the female characters, as
they undulate about the stage in
their sparkling silk wrappers.
Another of the show's strong
points is Ron Stacker Thomp
son's innovative direction and
choreography. Thompson also
plays the role of Rick, the glib
and vaguely satanic Master of
Ceremonies, and from this dual
position seems to control the
festivities with the omniscience
of a diabolical ringmaster: it's
hard to imagine anything going
on at the Club Savoy that the
mocking, self-satisfied Rick
doesn't know about. Thompson
is well aware that the show,
billed as "a Musical Reminis
cence" (in some press handouts
as a Musical Reminisence), is
really nothing more than a
flimsy excuse to present the mu
sical numbers; and as long as
someone on stage is singing or
dancing, Thompson remains
very much in command. With
his ringmaster shrewdness, he
knows exactly how long it will
take the audience to get bored
with a particular musical style,
tempo or performer, and is
careful to alternate fast num
bers with slow ones, group num
bers with solos, dance numbers
with nightclub songs, and just
when interest starts to lag again
. . . wham! Another comic
number.
The first three numbers of the
second act are a good example
of Thompson's almost
Vaudeville-like technique.
Thompson himself, as a white
suited Rick, starts off with a
seductively slow bump-and
grind version of "On the Good
Ship Lollipop," and gives new

meaning to the line "hop on and
take a ride on my chocolate
bar." Then we have an ex
cruciating performance of
Billie Holiday's "It's the Mood
That I'm In," played for laughs
in a tuneless, screeching voice
by supposedly drunken society
matron (Biance Thornton). The
showman in Thompsan knows
damn well that he better follow
up such frippery with a real
show-stopper, and he gives us
Harold Nicholas singing

Gershwin's "Lady Be Good"
like an Ella Fitzgerald record
played at 78 rpm. Nicholas
skims over about two-thirds of
the lyrics, and his "lady be
good" comes out more like
"laybeguh" — but we can't help
feeling that if our ears could
keep up with his voice, we'd be
able to hear every word. Un
fortunately, Nicholas then goes
into a self-indulgent scat ex
change with the drummer
(Gaylord Birch), while the bass

continues to play along at three
times normal tempo. Although
the audience chuckles good-na
turedly at Nicholas' imitations
of drum rolls and cymbals
(glub-glub-glub and binka-binka
respectively), it's one of those
routines where you feel you're
required to laugh only because
the performer is making such a
fool of himself on stage.
Yet Harold Nicholas, for all
his faults, is the unchallenged
star of the show. T. Baomi Butts

(what a name!) as Sal, Nich
olas' long-time main squeeze, is
at least tolerable, but Mwanza
Furaha and Cle Thompson (a
token white), as visiting
singers, are absolutely awful,
screeching and pawing the air
like Macbethian witches. Also
quite bad are Michael L.
Brown and Biance Thornston as
a mismatched couple spending
an evening out at the club.
Brown simply has no acting or
singing talent, and Thornton's
idea of acting is to affect an an
noying unintelligible Eleanor
Roosevelt voice all through the
first act. It's a nice surprise,
however, to find that Thornton
has a voice after all when she
launches into "My Man" near
the end of the show. Hardly
worth mentioning are the two
young ladies billed as The Choc
olate Kisses (Linda Goodrich
and Paula McCullum): as
Thompson explains, they are
"sweet, brown, and well
wrapped."
This seems to be Thompson's
main problem. His ring
master's instincts are good, and
he knows when it's time to bring
in something new, but his circus
is only as good as the per
formers and their material.
Just as Nicholas rises far above
most of the other performers,
the musical numbers simply put
to shame the flimsy, unfunny
stuff that passes for dialogue.
Like the Broadway musical
■12nd Street, no one is credited
with the show's book, and for
good reasons: who would admit
to writing the embarrassing
one-liners and blatant sexual in
nuendo that, rather than filling
the dead space between musical

numbers, seem to contribute to
the vacuum?
But if you can survive the
wasteland between production
numbers, many of them are
worth the wait. Director
Thompson's forte is clearly ap
proaching the music, stuff that
is familiar to most of the au
dience, from new directions,
and taking liberties with the
tempo, lyrics, and in some
cases, the context in which it is
performed. For example,
Gershwin's "Someone to Watch
over Me" is mouthed by Madge,
but is really sung by Sal at her
table (get it? Sal is the only who
is really pining for Hal); and
when Sal does a slow version of
Ella Fitzgerald's "A-Tisket, A-
Tasket." she throws in a line
about her "sweet brown
basket," just so we'll know that
she really means Hal. An ex
treme example is Madge and
Gloria's 1940s version of "I
Need a Little Sugar in My
Bowl." which is already fairly
explicit without the emphasis
placed on lines like, "I need a
little hot dog . . . between my
rolls."
The fun part of the show is
waiting to see what new
wrinkles Thompson will give to
the next number, and although
you may be slightly appalled at
some of his twists (blues purists
will certainly be aghast at some
of the carryings-on), they re
almost always entertaining. Af

but is really sung by Sal at her
table (get it? Sal is the only who
is really pining for Hal); and
when Sal does a slow version of
Ella Fitzgerald's "A-Tisket, A-
Tasket." she throws in a line
about her "sweet brown
basket," just so we'll know that
she really means Hal. An ex
treme example is Madge and
Gloria's 1940s version of "I
Need a Little Sugar in My
Bowl." which is already fairly
explicit without the emphasis
placed on lines like, "I need a
little hot dog . . . between my
rolls."
The fun part of the show is

The cast of 'Stompin' at the Savoy.'
Despite the intriguing title,
Stompin' at the Savoy, a new
revue at the On Broad
*way Theatre in San Francisco,
. turns out to be a sort of second
rate Ain't Misbehavin' — and
it's really too bad, when you
consider how many good things
this production has going for it.
The best thing about the show is
clearly the music: sixteen
nightclub blues numbers by
Gershwin, Ellington, Nat
"King" Cole, Dorothy Fields
and others, all friendly and fa
miliar. Equally successful is the
atmosphere — the Club Savoy
that set designer Steven Fischer
has created at the On Broadway
fairly bursts with art deco
palms and the glitter of sequins,
and Jeffrey N. Palmer's cos
tumes, (low-cut gowns in bright
primary colors and dazzling
white suits that seem to lend a
grotesque, puppetlike quality to
the actors) are perfect for this
fictional 1930s nightspot. And
then there's Harold Nicholas,
the star of the show and veteran
of such screen musicals as
Stormy Weather and The
Pirate, and co-star with the
likes of Lena Home, Bojangles,
Gene Kelly and Judy Garland.
As the quick-stepping, wise
cracking Hal Wilson, headliner
at the Club Savoy, Nicholas
projects the same lovable
burlesque sexuality that Mickey
Rooney did in Sugar Babies.
Like Rooney, his age, small
stature and apparent lack of ac
ting ability seem to strengthen
rather than detract from his ap
peal — there is something so jol
ly about these good-natured dir
ty old men who are threatening
neither to men nor to women.

Nicholas plays his role for all
it's worth, panting wildly after
all the female characters, as
they undulate about the stage in
their sparkling silk wrappers.
Another of the show's strong
points is Ron Stacker Thomp
son's innovative direction and
choreography. Thompson also
plays the role of Rick, the glib
and vaguely satanic Master of
Ceremonies, and from this dual
position seems to control the
festivities with the omniscience
of a diabolical ringmaster: it's
hard to imagine anything going
on at the Club Savoy that the
mocking, self-satisfied Rick
doesn't know about. Thompson
is well aware that the show,
billed as "a Musical Reminis
cence" (in some press handouts
as a Musical Reminisence), is
really nothing more than a
flimsy excuse to present the mu
sical numbers; and as long as
someone on stage is singing or
dancing, Thompson remains
very much in command. With
his ringmaster shrewdness, he
knows exactly how long it will
take the audience to get bored
with a particular musical style,
tempo or performer, and is
careful to alternate fast num
bers with slow ones, group num
bers with solos, dance numbers
with nightclub songs, and just
when interest starts to lag again
. . . wham! Another comic
number.
The first three numbers of the
second act are a good example
of Thompson's almost
Vaudeville-like technique.
Thompson himself, as a white
suited Rick, starts off with a
seductively slow bump-and
grind version of "On the Good
Ship Lollipop," and gives new

meaning to the line "hop on and
take a ride on my chocolate
bar." Then we have an ex
cruciating performance of
Billie Holiday's "It's the Mood
That I'm In," played for laughs
in a tuneless, screeching voice
by supposedly drunken society
matron (Biance Thornton). The
showman in Thompsan knows
damn well that he better follow
up such frippery with a real
show-stopper, and he gives us
Harold Nicholas singing

Gershwin's "Lady Be Good"
like an Ella Fitzgerald record
played at 78 rpm. Nicholas
skims over about two-thirds of
the lyrics, and his "lady be
good" comes out more like
"laybeguh" — but we can't help
feeling that if our ears could
keep up with his voice, we'd be
able to hear every word. Un
fortunately, Nicholas then goes
into a self-indulgent scat ex
change with the drummer
(Gaylord Birch), while the bass

continues to play along at three
times normal tempo. Although
the audience chuckles good-na
turedly at Nicholas' imitations
of drum rolls and cymbals
(glub-glub-glub and binka-binka
respectively), it's one of those
routines where you feel you're
required to laugh only because
the performer is making such a
fool of himself on stage.
Yet Harold Nicholas, for all
his faults, is the unchallenged
star of the show. T. Baomi Butts

(what a name!) as Sal, Nich
olas' long-time main squeeze, is
at least tolerable, but Mwanza
Furaha and Cle Thompson (a
token white), as visiting
singers, are absolutely awful,
screeching and pawing the air
like Macbethian witches. Also
quite bad are Michael L.
Brown and Biance Thornston as
a mismatched couple spending
an evening out at the club.
Brown simply has no acting or
singing talent, and Thornton's
idea of acting is to affect an an
noying unintelligible Eleanor
Roosevelt voice all through the
first act. It's a nice surprise,
however, to find that Thornton
has a voice after all when she
launches into "My Man" near
the end of the show. Hardly
worth mentioning are the two
young ladies billed as The Choc
olate Kisses (Linda Goodrich
and Paula McCullum): as
Thompson explains, they are
"sweet, brown, and well
wrapped."
This seems to be Thompson's
main problem. His ring
master's instincts are good, and
he knows when it's time to bring
in something new, but his circus
is only as good as the per
formers and their material.
Just as Nicholas rises far above
most of the other performers,
the musical numbers simply put
to shame the flimsy, unfunny
stuff that passes for dialogue.
Like the Broadway musical
■12nd Street, no one is credited
with the show's book, and for
good reasons: who would admit
to writing the embarrassing
one-liners and blatant sexual in
nuendo that, rather than filling
the dead space between musical

numbers, seem to contribute to
the vacuum?
But if you can survive the
wasteland between production
numbers, many of them are
worth the wait. Director
Thompson's forte is clearly ap
proaching the music, stuff that
is familiar to most of the au
dience, from new directions,
and taking liberties with the
tempo, lyrics, and in some
cases, the context in which it is
performed. For example,
Gershwin's "Someone to Watch
over Me" is mouthed by Madge,
but is really sung by Sal at her
table (get it? Sal is the only who
is really pining for Hal); and
when Sal does a slow version of
Ella Fitzgerald's "A-Tisket, A-
Tasket." she throws in a line
about her "sweet brown
basket," just so we'll know that
she really means Hal. An ex
treme example is Madge and
Gloria's 1940s version of "I
Need a Little Sugar in My
Bowl." which is already fairly
explicit without the emphasis
placed on lines like, "I need a
little hot dog . . . between my
rolls."
The fun part of the show is
waiting to see what new
wrinkles Thompson will give to
the next number, and although
you may be slightly appalled at
some of his twists (blues purists
will certainly be aghast at some
of the carryings-on), they re
almost always entertaining. Af
ter all, one never knows, do one?
The show plays Tuesday
through Friday at 8 p.m., and
Saturday at 8 and 10 p.m. For
ticket information call 398-0800.
