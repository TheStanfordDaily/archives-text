# 'Harry's War': the New Right finds a cinematic voice
## 
### Vince Waldman 
If Frank Capra is the sen
timental champion of
grassroots democracy, and
Stanley Kramer the epitome of
New Frontier liberalism, Keith
Merill may well become the
cinematic voice of the New
Right. After winning an Oscar
for his documentary celebration
of The Great American Cow
boy, Merrill has maintained a
cowboy-like independence from
the Hollywood Establishment.
He still lives here on the Penin
sula, and is said to have had
problems with the Internal Rev
,<enue Service — which may ex
plain the passion with which he
.has written, co-produced, and
directed Harry 's War.
Harry's War is a fantasy
about an average man's revolt
against the taxman. and it has a
definite conservative view
point. With the victory of the
Reagan majority, the times
■ could not be more auspicious for
the release of the film; indeed it
would be easy to dismiss it as a
right-wing polemic if it were not

for the inconvenient fact that
Harry 's War is a very funny
movie.
Edward Herrmann plays
Harry, the mailman-turned
commando who resorts to vio
lence in order to bring public at
tention to his struggle with the
IRS. Herrmann was a brilliant
casting choice and is undoub
tedly the mam reason for the
movie's succo s. He has the
face and demeanor of the
archetypal common man:
friendly, fun-loving, a bit
awkward His transformation
from a meek civil servant
(whose wife is divorcing him be
cause of his non-assertiveness)
into a flak-jacketed rebel pro
vides most of the film's humor,
and Herrmann bring off the
change with great success.
When he commits his first act of
hand-to-hand violence — he
chains an IRS agent to a door —
his face shows a wondrous mix
ture of confusion, shame, and
pride. Later, he asks quietly.
"How do you say you're sorry
for a war?" Even in his angriest

moments. Harry maintains an
element of calm: Herrmann
adds a new emotion to the ac
tor's repetoire, an emotion
which can only be called mild
mannered rage.
Herrmann's quintessential
common man plays against a
rather loony supporting cast.
Geraldine Page plays the old
lady who gives Harry a salvage
yard in southern Utah, where
she's collected an extraordinary
array of obsolete weaponry
("half of World War Two," says
one character). She's un
mistakably dotty — she's con
vinced that the Russians are
going to use a weapon called
"thermoblooming" to fuse the
desert sand into glass — but she
has a generous side as well: she
runs a sort of mission, and gives
food to anyone who asks.
David Ogden Stiers (Dr.
Winchester on M*A*S*H) is the
imperious IRS official who
claims that Page's charitable
acts are not tax-deductible be
cause she spouts her crazy poli
tics while she serves up the

food. Stiers is the ultimate bu
reaucrat — his life's ambition is
to become a district manager,
and he's self-righteous enough
to declare that taxes are the
basis of the Republic. But when
his authority is challenged, he
cracks up.
Elisha Cook gives a bizarre
portrayal of an old veteran who
joins Harry's war, but more,
one suspects, out of a yearn for
combat gear — she gasps, "You
look terrific," and joins him in
his bunker under the junkyard.
Surrounded with a bunch like
this, it's not surprising that
Harry goes to war, and becomes
the symbolic defender of rugged
individualism. Merrill obvious
ly sympathizes with the eccen
trics and loners, and is con
temptuous of the strait-laced
government agents.
The salvage yard too becomes
a visual symbol of individ
ualism. It stands high in the
Utah mountains like a medieval
fortress, surounded by tanks,
guns, jeeps and land mines. (Ac

cording to the credits, the weap
ons come from the York Arms
and Armor Museum of Hur
ricane, Utah; it must be quite a
museum.) Merrill seems quite
proud of this memorable set, es
pecially since the whole film
cost less than $2 million. When
the plot takes us outside Harry 's
fortress, the movie becomes pe
destrian: Merrill spends far too
much time on mush family
scenes and TV-quality car
chases. But as long as we're on
the main battlefield, the film
sparkles with originality.
Merrill's politics seems to be
more libertarian than conserva
tive. While Geraldine Page's
nutty commie-hater is
portrayed with a great deal of
sympathy, her views are clearly
meant to be a source of laughs —
no one else in the movie takes
her seriously. Merrill is con
cerned less with specific liberal
policies than with the way cen
tralized government is un
responsive to the people it gov
erns. Harry goes to war not to

bring down the tax system, but
merely to secure a trial by jury:
this is hardly an extremist no
tion. Many legal scholars who
consider the jury trial obsolete
in civil cases nevertheless think
the jury is essential in cases
where the government sues an
individual — in order to protect
people from the sort of over
weening coercion that Harry
confronts in the IRS bureau
cracy.
Around this core argument,
however, Merrill has built a
penumbra of less defensible at
titudes. The film is permeated
with subtle sexism and an un
warranted faith in the military.
The Army troops called in to
capture Harry are depicted as
sensible and humane, while the
IRS agents are humorless total
itarians. The film's worst mo
ment comes when Harry pro
claims, "Hitler would have
loved the IRS." This is the same
attitude, of course, that leads to
a federal budget that will slash
spending everywhere except in

the military.
Merrill tries to undermine
some of the more offensive
dogma uttered by his charac
ters, but this subtlety was ap
parently missed by the au
dience, which cheered at even
the most embarassing lines.
Judging from audience reac
tion, Merrill has struck a vis
ceral chord.
Harry 's War may become the
sleeper hit of 1981. It certainly
deserves success; the film has
nerve and style and is great fun,
even for liberals. Still, one
leaves the theater worried, in
deed scared, by the audience re
action and its apparent testi
mony to the way in which a less
tolerant filmmaker might ma
nipulate the general sense of
e frustration felt by the average
American. The same feelings
that produce a good comedy in
Harry's War could, in other
hands, become a force destruc
tive to the individual freedom
that Merrill celebrates.

ricane, Utah; it must be quite a
museum.) Merrill seems quite
proud of this memorable set, es
pecially since the whole film
cost less than $2 million. When
the plot takes us outside Harry 's
fortress, the movie becomes pe
destrian: Merrill spends far too
much time on mush family
scenes and TV-quality car
chases. But as long as we're on
the main battlefield, the film
sparkles with originality.
Merrill's politics seems to be
more libertarian than conserva
tive. While Geraldine Page's
nutty commie-hater is
portrayed with a great deal of
sympathy, her views are clearly
meant to be a source of laughs —
no one else in the movie takes
her seriously. Merrill is con
cerned less with specific liberal
policies than with the way cen
tralized government is un
responsive to the people it gov
erns. Harry goes to war not to

bring down the tax system, but
merely to secure a trial by jury:
this is hardly an extremist no
tion. Many legal scholars who
consider the jury trial obsolete
in civil cases nevertheless think
the jury is essential in cases
where the government sues an
individual — in order to protect
people from the sort of over
weening coercion that Harry
confronts in the IRS bureau
cracy.
Around this core argument,
however, Merrill has built a
penumbra of less defensible at
titudes. The film is permeated
with subtle sexism and an un
warranted faith in the military.
The Army troops called in to
capture Harry are depicted as
sensible and humane, while the
IRS agents are humorless total
itarians. The film's worst mo
ment comes when Harry pro
claims, "Hitler would have
loved the IRS." This is the same
attitude, of course, that leads to
a federal budget that will slash
spending everywhere except in

the military.
Merrill tries to undermine
some of the more offensive
dogma uttered by his charac
ters, but this subtlety was ap
parently missed by the au
dience, which cheered at even
the most embarassing lines.
Judging from audience reac
tion, Merrill has struck a vis
ceral chord.
Harry 's War may become the
sleeper hit of 1981. It certainly
deserves success; the film has
nerve and style and is great fun,
even for liberals. Still, one
leaves the theater worried, in
deed scared, by the audience re
action and its apparent testi
mony to the way in which a less
tolerant filmmaker might ma
nipulate the general sense of
e frustration felt by the average
American. The same feelings
that produce a good comedy in
Harry's War could, in other
hands, become a force destruc
tive to the individual freedom
that Merrill celebrates.
If Frank Capra is the sen
timental champion of
grassroots democracy, and
Stanley Kramer the epitome of
New Frontier liberalism, Keith
Merill may well become the
cinematic voice of the New
Right. After winning an Oscar
for his documentary celebration
of The Great American Cow
boy, Merrill has maintained a
cowboy-like independence from
the Hollywood Establishment.
He still lives here on the Penin
sula, and is said to have had
problems with the Internal Rev
,<enue Service — which may ex
plain the passion with which he
.has written, co-produced, and
directed Harry 's War.
Harry's War is a fantasy
about an average man's revolt
against the taxman. and it has a
definite conservative view
point. With the victory of the
Reagan majority, the times
■ could not be more auspicious for
the release of the film; indeed it
would be easy to dismiss it as a
right-wing polemic if it were not

for the inconvenient fact that
Harry 's War is a very funny
movie.
Edward Herrmann plays
Harry, the mailman-turned
commando who resorts to vio
lence in order to bring public at
tention to his struggle with the
IRS. Herrmann was a brilliant
casting choice and is undoub
tedly the mam reason for the
movie's succo s. He has the
face and demeanor of the
archetypal common man:
friendly, fun-loving, a bit
awkward His transformation
from a meek civil servant
(whose wife is divorcing him be
cause of his non-assertiveness)
into a flak-jacketed rebel pro
vides most of the film's humor,
and Herrmann bring off the
change with great success.
When he commits his first act of
hand-to-hand violence — he
chains an IRS agent to a door —
his face shows a wondrous mix
ture of confusion, shame, and
pride. Later, he asks quietly.
"How do you say you're sorry
for a war?" Even in his angriest

moments. Harry maintains an
element of calm: Herrmann
adds a new emotion to the ac
tor's repetoire, an emotion
which can only be called mild
mannered rage.
Herrmann's quintessential
common man plays against a
rather loony supporting cast.
Geraldine Page plays the old
lady who gives Harry a salvage
yard in southern Utah, where
she's collected an extraordinary
array of obsolete weaponry
("half of World War Two," says
one character). She's un
mistakably dotty — she's con
vinced that the Russians are
going to use a weapon called
"thermoblooming" to fuse the
desert sand into glass — but she
has a generous side as well: she
runs a sort of mission, and gives
food to anyone who asks.
David Ogden Stiers (Dr.
Winchester on M*A*S*H) is the
imperious IRS official who
claims that Page's charitable
acts are not tax-deductible be
cause she spouts her crazy poli
tics while she serves up the

food. Stiers is the ultimate bu
reaucrat — his life's ambition is
to become a district manager,
and he's self-righteous enough
to declare that taxes are the
basis of the Republic. But when
his authority is challenged, he
cracks up.
Elisha Cook gives a bizarre
portrayal of an old veteran who
joins Harry's war, but more,
one suspects, out of a yearn for
combat gear — she gasps, "You
look terrific," and joins him in
his bunker under the junkyard.
Surrounded with a bunch like
this, it's not surprising that
Harry goes to war, and becomes
the symbolic defender of rugged
individualism. Merrill obvious
ly sympathizes with the eccen
trics and loners, and is con
temptuous of the strait-laced
government agents.
The salvage yard too becomes
a visual symbol of individ
ualism. It stands high in the
Utah mountains like a medieval
fortress, surounded by tanks,
guns, jeeps and land mines. (Ac

cording to the credits, the weap
ons come from the York Arms

ricane, Utah; it must be quite a
