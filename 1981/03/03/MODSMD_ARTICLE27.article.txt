Brahms the ivay we like it:
The Manzanita String Quartet will perform Brahms' concerto in G minor, opus 25, for piano
and strings, this Tuesday evening at Wilbur Hall. Each of the quartet's members follows a
profession other than music. They are, from left to right: Stanley Evans, violist and Superior
Court Judge; Edwin Good, pianist and Stanford religious studies professor; Alan Sklar, vio
linist and psychiatrist; and Tita McCall, cellist and real estate broker. Evans and McCall are
the principal violist and cellist, respectively, with the Master Sinfonia. The performance will
take place at 7 p.m. in the Madera House Lounge. There is no admission charge.
