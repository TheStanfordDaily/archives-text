# Santana rocks crowd with mission
## 
### Charles Nathaniel Charnas 
Maybe I am getting old and my sensitivity
to modern music's wide range of styles has
become tarnished. There are currently only
several rock musicians whose concerts I
will attend, and Carlos Santana is one of
them.
He shares with few others the ability to
render a distinct tone — one that is both
melancholy and hard-edged. His music re
sounds lugubriously, then bites down hard
into the heart. It wrenches without fore
warning.
Lee Oskar, who played harmonica for
many years with "War," has the same ef
fect. So do Marvin Gaye and Boz Scaggs, at
their best. Neil Young can make a contented
man cry. In contrast, Grover Washington,
Jr., and Jackson Browne wallow and drone,
and the Stones, as a whole, and Chryssie
Hynde only bristle and seethe.
Santana's phrasing brings out the force of
his tone. In "Song of the Wind," for exam
ple, whether picking cleanly in the upper
registers or slashing through lower power
chords, he thinks while he plays. Each
sound is potent because he places it in its
most meaningful context. He arches sky
ward with temerity, almost stealing into a
confrontation with his "divine Being," and
later blasts recklessly, as if he were trying

to unjam the background clutter of Latin
rhythms.
The effect is startling. The gentle tone be
gins to disenchant those who have escaped
or forgotten the perils of a difficult world.
Then, as the pace of the music quickens, the
tone delicately unifies all the members of
the audience into a regenerated, im
passioned body. Now the hectic Latin
rhythms appear to be teeming with life.
Santana bends and cuts across the strings of
his guitar to drive home the point: finally he
resolves the disparate moods he has created
in a refrain from the opening, showing their
common origin in the same single, gentle
tone.
Santana became a student of Sri Chimnoy
in 1973. The guru's teachings heightened the
guitarist's awareness of the effect he has on
his listeners. Santana's tone and attitude
are now clearly meant to be inspirational.
The design of all his music, including such
rock anthems as "Black Magic Woman"
and "She's So Fine," is to uplift. It is as if
Santana has a mission.
Last Wednesday he brought the latest
version of his travelling Gospel Show to the
San Jose Civic Auditorium. This concert
was the last in the brief "Zebop" tour,
which started at the beginning of February
in San Francisco and extended to Denver

and Salt Lake City before returning to the
Bay Area.
The band rocked hard for more than two
hours. Although Santana's musical in
terests have diversified in the past few
years and he has recorded and performed
with Herbie Hancock, the band played little
jazz or fusion in San Jose. Instead, Santana
and his rhythm section blasted songs from
throughout the guitarist's career, and the
audience went wild.
The strictly rock format undermined the
missionary intent of the show. Power rock
does not equate well with the spiritual
teachings of Sri Chimnoy, which were sum
marized in a pamphlet distributed at the
concert. In fact, at times during the per
formance Santana seemed like just another
rock star turned religious, diminishing the
importance of his unique message. The new
lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist also dis
tracted from the spirit of the event. He
sounded like a rejected Doobie Brother and
had no Latin swing.
Nevertheless, the concert succeeded in
bringing the audience together. If the band's
pyrotechnics kept some listeners from feel
ing the full zeal of Santana's religious devo
tion, all who attended were at least devoted
to the music.

concert. In fact, at times during the per
formance Santana seemed like just another
rock star turned religious, diminishing the
importance of his unique message. The new
lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist also dis
tracted from the spirit of the event. He
sounded like a rejected Doobie Brother and
had no Latin swing.
Nevertheless, the concert succeeded in
bringing the audience together. If the band's
pyrotechnics kept some listeners from feel
ing the full zeal of Santana's religious devo
tion, all who attended were at least devoted
to the music.
