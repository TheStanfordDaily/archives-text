# Years in Escondido could be limited

University housing administrators
are considering a proposal to limit the
amount of time single graduate stu
dents are allowed to reside in Escon
dido Village, according to James
Lyons, Dean of Student Affairs.
Lyons, who favors a time limit, said
that a more frequent turnover in
Escondido Village residents would al
low the University to house "at least a
third more graduate students," at
sometime during their stay at Stan
ford.
Currently, once a graduate student
is alloted space in Escondido, he can
stay there until he completes his stud
ies.
"Putting a limit on housing is rela
tively a new idea. Essentially, once
you are in, you are guaranteed housing
as long as you are there," said Lyons.
"The need for housing has never
been greater, (yet) at present we are
housing a minority of graduate stu
dents. The ease of finding off-campus
housing has never been less; we want
to provide housing when they need it
most," Lyons explained.
If the new proposal is implemented,
it would favor graduate students com
ing into the area. More housing would
be available to new students to allow
them time to adjust to the community,
find good housing and to look for peo
ple they could possibly room with.
Roger Whitney, Director of the
Housing Center, admits meetings con
cerning length of stay in Escondido
Village are being held but said, "noth
ing hardcore has been discussed."
"All sorts of ideas are floating
around; some say there should be a
time limit, others say not. It's all very
premature at this point," said

Whitney.
Whitney stessed that implementing
such a proposal would constitute a
"very big policy change and won't be
something that's jumped into quick
ly." Both Lyons and Whitney men
tioned that a decision would depend on
a variety of factors and feedback re
ceived from adminstrators and gradu
ate student groups.
Current discussions do not include
the possibility of subsidizing off-cam
pus housing for graduate students.
Jonathon Siegel, a Ph D student in
Political Science and Escondido Vil
lage resident, said he believes the Uni
versity is "only in the talking stages,"
and doesn't think a plan limiting resi
dency would be implemented for "at
least a year," for several reasons.
"We are mindful of escalating costs
for houses. Rents in Escondido by
comparison are much lower than mar
ket rents; there is no thought on spe
cial subsidies," said Lyons.
Lyons also stressed that there are
no plans to change the policy regard
ing married students with children be
cause "children are discriminated
against in the rental market."
"The University just doesn't have
enough information to decide yet what
should be done because they don't
know the extent of the problem," said
Siegel.
The University is investigating two
alleged abuses of the graduate housing
system, he said. One involves the sus
pected abuse of Terminal Graduate
Registration, and the other involves
University concern that access to
housing is not being distributed
throughout the graduate students.
