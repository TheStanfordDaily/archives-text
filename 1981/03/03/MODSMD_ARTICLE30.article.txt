# Mary Barnes theatre of schizophrenia:
## Eureka journeys through madness 
### Stephen Nash 
No group of people in our soci
ety is as invisible or as fright
ening as the insane. Differences
of skin color and religion have
reached some partial measure
of acceptance. Even the physi
cally disabled are beginning to
make an appearance in our day
to-day lives. The mentally ill,
however, remain terrifying. It
could be that we consider our
minds to be the most essential
part of our self-image. Hence,
when our minds break down, we
lose our identity. Mental illness
is thus dreaded as a form of psy
chological death.
This is not the only way to
view insanity. Mental illness
can be caused by physical prob
lems in the brain, or by
chemical imbalances in the
body. More intriguingly, it can
represent an atypical set of val
ues, or a very original and pro
found self-image. Perceived in
this way, a condition such as
schizophrenia should not be con
sidered as a disease to be cured,
but as a viewpoint to be en
couraged in the hope that the in
dividual will reach a new level
of self-understanding.
This was the view of R.D.
Laing and a few of his col

leagues back in the sixties. To
explore this idea, they set ud
Kingsley Hall, a place where pa
tients and doctors could live to
gether in a communal, sup
portive way. Patients were en
couraged to explore their
thoughts and feelings, without
coercion and without the use of
drugs or shock treatment. As a
result of this experience, Mary
Barnes, together with her psy
chiatrist Joseph Berke, wrote
the book Mary Harries: Two Ac
counts of Journey Through
Madness.
The Eureka Theatre is cur
rently presenting David
Edgar's play Mary Barnes,
which is a loose adaptation of
the book. It is an attempt not
only to describe what happened
to Mary Barnes, but also to rec
reate the experience of living at
Kingsley Hall.
Beiore coming to Kingsley
Hall, Mary Barnes had had a
long history of mental illness.
The causes were varied, but cer
tainly her breach birth, her
Catholic upbringing, and an ex
perience of incest with her
brother were of major signifi
cance. In the past, she had been
exposed to traditional forms of
treatment, but with little suc

cess. It was in desperation that
she found her way to Laing's ex
perimental clinic.
Barnes believed that the
problems in her life stemmed
from having been born
backwards; she believed that
she had to try and go back to the
womb in order to be born again,
this time the right way. It was a
frightening journey, since she
had to relive many of the
traumatic experiences in her
life. The most frightening
aspect, though, was that it was a
journey she had to make by
herself, since no one else could
possibly understand it. Her psy
chiatrist (named Eddie in the
play) encouraged her to act on
her feelings and to trust in her
instincts. He was also there to
comfort her when she was
frightened, and to watch over
her, for example, when she re
fused to eat.
Because Mary Barnes is pri
marily about Barnes and Eddie,
and only peripherally about
Kingsley Hall, the other charac
ters in the large cast are not
fully developed. In many re
spects. they might be con
sidered as extensions of the
sets. They do more to establish
mood than they do to advance
the story of Barnes' self-devised

treatment.
The play is based on the as
sumption that schizophrenia is
an unusual style of self-per
ception. With this assumption,
the labels 'sane' and insane'
lose much of their meaning
David Edgar has emphasized
this idea by making it difficult
to distinguish the doctors from
the patients in the early part of
the play. In fact, it is not until
the second act that the two
groups of characters become
absolutely distinct.
Edgar has blurred the doc
tor/patient identities in a varie
ty of ways. First of all, no one
wears a uniform (except
Barnes, who is dressed as a
nurse). Second, in the first few
scenes the idiosyncracies of the
characters — staff and patients
alike — are emphasized. For ex
ample, Hugo, the chief psy
chiatrist, obsessively carries
around a candlabra.
Most importantly, all the
characters are seen from
Barnes' point of view. They
speak in incomplete sentences,
sometimes incoherently, and
pause frequently as if struggling
to put ideas into words. Much of
each character's personality
comes from Barnes. The topics
which come up in her self-ex
ploration (such as her obsession
with Catholic imagery) also ap
pear in the speeches of other
people.
It is not surprising that the
success of this play depends
largely on the performance of
Linda Hoy in the role of Barnes.
Hoy is magnificent. It is dif
ficult to forget her wide-eyed
joy at receiving a set of crayons,
and her rambunctiousness when
playing hide-and-seek, to name
just two examples.
Dana Kelly as Eddie also
gives a marvelously energetic
performance. He is thoroughly
convincing as he moves through
frustration, anger, amazement,
excitement, and many other
emotions. The rest of the cast
must also be complimented for
their many evocative charac
terizations.
Mary Barnes is a play of great
warmth. The mood changes fre
quently. but the love and mutual
respect which was so much a
part of Kingsley Hall can be felt
throughout the numerous
scenes. It offers not only a dis
tinctive view of mental illness,
but also a very sensitive view of
a very remarkable woman.

Barnes believed that the
problems in her life stemmed
from having been born
backwards; she believed that
she had to try and go back to the
womb in order to be born again,
this time the right way. It was a
frightening journey, since she
had to relive many of the
traumatic experiences in her
life. The most frightening
aspect, though, was that it was a
journey she had to make by
herself, since no one else could
possibly understand it. Her psy
chiatrist (named Eddie in the
play) encouraged her to act on
her feelings and to trust in her
instincts. He was also there to
comfort her when she was
frightened, and to watch over
her, for example, when she re
fused to eat.
Because Mary Barnes is pri
marily about Barnes and Eddie,
and only peripherally about
Kingsley Hall, the other charac
ters in the large cast are not
fully developed. In many re
spects. they might be con
sidered as extensions of the
sets. They do more to establish
mood than they do to advance
the story of Barnes' self-devised

treatment.
The play is based on the as
sumption that schizophrenia is
an unusual style of self-per
ception. With this assumption,
the labels 'sane' and insane'
lose much of their meaning
David Edgar has emphasized
this idea by making it difficult
to distinguish the doctors from
the patients in the early part of
the play. In fact, it is not until
the second act that the two
groups of characters become
absolutely distinct.
Edgar has blurred the doc
tor/patient identities in a varie
ty of ways. First of all, no one
wears a uniform (except
Barnes, who is dressed as a
nurse). Second, in the first few
scenes the idiosyncracies of the
characters — staff and patients
alike — are emphasized. For ex
ample, Hugo, the chief psy
chiatrist, obsessively carries
around a candlabra.
Most importantly, all the
characters are seen from
Barnes' point of view. They
speak in incomplete sentences,
sometimes incoherently, and
pause frequently as if struggling
to put ideas into words. Much of
each character's personality
comes from Barnes. The topics
which come up in her self-ex
ploration (such as her obsession
with Catholic imagery) also ap
pear in the speeches of other
people.
It is not surprising that the
success of this play depends
largely on the performance of
Linda Hoy in the role of Barnes.
Hoy is magnificent. It is dif
ficult to forget her wide-eyed
joy at receiving a set of crayons,
and her rambunctiousness when
playing hide-and-seek, to name
just two examples.
Dana Kelly as Eddie also
gives a marvelously energetic
performance. He is thoroughly
convincing as he moves through
frustration, anger, amazement,
excitement, and many other
emotions. The rest of the cast
must also be complimented for
their many evocative charac
terizations.
Mary Barnes is a play of great
warmth. The mood changes fre
quently. but the love and mutual
respect which was so much a
part of Kingsley Hall can be felt
throughout the numerous
scenes. It offers not only a dis
tinctive view of mental illness,
but also a very sensitive view of
a very remarkable woman.

Barnes.'
No group of people in our soci
ety is as invisible or as fright
ening as the insane. Differences
of skin color and religion have
reached some partial measure
of acceptance. Even the physi
cally disabled are beginning to
make an appearance in our day
to-day lives. The mentally ill,
however, remain terrifying. It
could be that we consider our
minds to be the most essential
part of our self-image. Hence,
when our minds break down, we
lose our identity. Mental illness
is thus dreaded as a form of psy
chological death.
This is not the only way to
view insanity. Mental illness
can be caused by physical prob
lems in the brain, or by
chemical imbalances in the
body. More intriguingly, it can
represent an atypical set of val
ues, or a very original and pro
found self-image. Perceived in
this way, a condition such as
schizophrenia should not be con
sidered as a disease to be cured,
but as a viewpoint to be en
couraged in the hope that the in
dividual will reach a new level
of self-understanding.
This was the view of R.D.
Laing and a few of his col

leagues back in the sixties. To
explore this idea, they set ud
Kingsley Hall, a place where pa
tients and doctors could live to
gether in a communal, sup
portive way. Patients were en
couraged to explore their
thoughts and feelings, without
coercion and without the use of
drugs or shock treatment. As a
result of this experience, Mary
Barnes, together with her psy
chiatrist Joseph Berke, wrote
the book Mary Harries: Two Ac
counts of Journey Through
Madness.
The Eureka Theatre is cur

Edgar's play Mary Barnes,
which is a loose adaptation of
the book. It is an attempt not

to Mary Barnes, but also to rec

Kingsley Hall.
Beiore coming to Kingsley
Hall, Mary Barnes had had a
long history of mental illness.
The causes were varied, but cer
tainly her breach birth, her
Catholic upbringing, and an ex
perience of incest with her
brother were of major signifi
cance. In the past, she had been
exposed to traditional forms of
treatment, but with little suc

cess. It was in desperation that
she found her way to Laing's ex
perimental clinic.
