# The
						Jam is too bloody English
## 
### Tony Kelly 
Anyone who tells you that the
U.S. record-buying public is too
dependent on English bands for
new rock music has obviously
never heard of the Jam. These
guys have been around the top of
the British music scene for a
few years now, and every rec
ord they release is almost a
guaranteed hit. Overseas.
Which isn't worth a shilling
here. Neither are the Jam's rec
ords, according to their record
sales. Their fifth (!) album,
Sound Affects, probably will go
the same way as the others in
sales — down And that's a
shame, because Sound Affects
shows a kind of maturation in
the Jam that should establish
them as simply a very talented
rock band. Period.
The Jam's main problem has
always been labeling. After
being caught up in the punk
movement of 1976-77 (a move
ment they didn't really fit in
with), the Jam became "the
next Who," and spearheaded the
Mod revival in England. Need
less to say, there were enough
comparisons with the Who to fill
up a teenage wasteland, not all
of them unwarranted — Paul
Weller's guitar work did sound a
lot like Pete Townshend's at
times. Now, the Jam are con
sidered "too English" (what
ever that means) to make it
over here. This doesn't seem too
fair either. Sure, there are ref
erences to tellies, holidays and
MPs, but the Clash didn't do so
bad with those, right? And while
the Clash seem to have wavered
schizophrenically between
Sellout City and total inac
cessibility, the Jam have
matured over the years, and
their sound reaches a new high
on Sound Affects.
OK, that's taken care of. Now
about the round black thing with
the little hole in the center. . . .
Side one begins (cleverly
enough) with "Start!," a
number one single in Britain
that is pretty much a blatant
theft of the Beatles' "Taxman."
But where the Beatles carried a
political message, the song's
chorus "What you give is what
you get" is more of a social
statement; evidently the Brit
ish working-class politics the
Jam sang about before has been
replaced by a more personal
more affecting appraisal of hu
man relations. Musically, the
emphasis has also shifted, this
time away from
singer/guitarist Weller to
Bruce Foxton's bass — a wise
move, since he is an excellent
musician.

The mood of the album gets
pretty well established with
"Pretty Green" (a tune with a
strong rhythm section), a light
ballad called "Monday" and a
'60s throwback, "But I'm Dif
ferent Now" ("and I'm glad
that you're my girl"). So far, so
good — better than a lot of stuff
that you hear all the time. But
still nothing spectacular The
next track, "Set the House
Ablaze," provides the specta
cle. The music sounds as though
it could have come off the last
Jam album. Setting Sons. It has
all of the Jam trademarks — a
solid, but slightly jagged beat,
melodic bass and a guitar ma
neuvering up and down various
chord progressions But the lyr
ics are different — they reject
the old punk movement ("Yeah
the leather belt looks manly
/the black boots butch /but oh

what a bastard to get off") in fa
vor of a new determination. The
song builds beautifully, and acts
as a lead-in to an encapsulized
description of songwriter
Weller's frustration, called
"That's Entertainment." A
soft, acoustic guitar and a
faraway voice sing of the trap of
everyday life, with brief bursts
of a military beat hinting at ten
sion. The depressing picture
contrasted with the title and
chorus shows a spot of humor
previously hidden in the Jam.
E.asily the best-produced song
on the album, it symbolizes a
revolution about to burst.
Side two starts a little below
the standard established on the
first side. "Dream Time." a
story of a man who sells out
without realizing it, is good
enough — it has enough musical
material for three or four songs

in it (like many Jam tunes) But
the next few tracks, especially a
disaffecting instrumental ex
ercise called "Music for the
Last Couple." just don't seem to
generate any special interest.
Then, suddenly, the record be
comes great. "Scrape Away"
has most of the classic Jam song
connections already described,
but it comes together different
ly. The chorus is nothing less
than brilliant — Rick Buckler's
drumming purposely just a lit
tle out of sync. Foxton's bass
running up and down the scale,
Weller playing a psychedelic
tinged guitar riff and singing
some of his best lyrics ("You
reckon I'm dreaming when I say
1 still feel real /You say you
work for yourself and it's the
only way /But I look at you talk
ing and to me /'You just scrape
a&ay">. All the complaints the

Jam have against society be
come personified — and the per
son is not as far away from re
ality as we would hope.
This is the main thrust behind
the Jam's message: we are dan
gerously close to condoning so
cial fascism, and it's time to
turn back. Sound Affects puts
across that message in a way
that no one else has quite man
aged yet. And it still won't be ac
cepted in America — Polydor
has even thrown in a bonus sin
gle "Going Underground" — an
other No. 1 hit in Britain) to
boost sales, but that won't help.
It may sound like sour grapes to
say it isn't fair, but with the
Jam's message and ability to
play energetic, meaningful
rock, sometimes you've got to
wonder what the people really
want.
