Pentagon may save $4 billion
Washington — The outgoing comptroller general of the
United States has sent a letter to Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger declaring that mismanagement and
waste are now adding "several billion dollars a year" to
the Pentagon budget, which the Reagan administration
proposes to increase dramatically.
The letter, sent to Weinberger on his first day in office
by Elmer Staats, head of the General Accounting Office,
listed 15 major areas where large amounts of money could
be fairly readily saved. Staats called them "some of the
most apparent high pay-off opportunities" in the defense
budget.
GAO has 1000 accountants and other professionals con
tinuously studying Pentagon programs. Staats' letter was
based on repeated audits they have made. Weinberger has
yet to respond to the letter in any detail. Reagan vowed to
root out mismanagement and waste all across the govern
ment in his campaign last year.
Just the 15 areas he cited have the potential to save an
"absolute minimum" of $4 billion a year by the end of
President Reagan's term in 1985, Staats said in a lengthy
interview at the GAO last week. If implemented, other De
partment of Defense (DOD ) economies urged by the GAO
would increase annual savings by 1985 to "substantially
more" than $10 billion, Staats said.
Clean Air Act restrictions may be
limited
Washington — The National Commission on Air Quality
recommended yesterday that two key deadlines be
dropped from the Clean Air Act and that industry be given
a freer hand to develop pollution-free areas.
The majority of the 13-member commission said in a
final report to Congress that air pollution controls can be
streamlined and made less restrictive without unduly
jeopardizing health. But dissenting members complained
the proposals "go beyond compromise."
The report foreshadows what likely will be a long and
bitter debate over rewriting the clean air law. which was
last revised in 1977 and expires this year.
By proposing to drop the progressively tougher 1982 and
1987 standards for air quality and loosening other restric
tions — such as the carbon monoxide limit for auto exhaust
— the panel seeks to reverse some "of the most basic pro
grams of the Clean Air Act," said Richard Avres. Avres
and two other members filed the dissent.
The commission, whose members include state and fed
eral legislators as well as industry, health, labor and en
vironmental representatives, submitted its report after
two and a half years of study.
The report was received at a joint session of the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee and the House

Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the
environment.
Amnesty includes American in jail
Seoul, South Korea — Nearly 3400 prisoners will be re
leased today and the sentences of another 1836 will be re
duced in what the South Korean government said yester
day will be the largest amnesty in Korean history.
Among those affected will be American Stephen
Bauerman of Parkdale. Ore., a 23-year-old U.S. Air Force
enlisted man serving a 20-vear prison term for a 1979
murder Bauerman's sentence was cut in half but he still
has more than eight years to serve.
The amnesty, which is to start taking effect when Chun
Doo Hwan is inaugurated Tuesday for a seven-year term
as president of South Korea, did not mention South Korea's
best-known prisoner. He is Kim Dae Jung, the 1971 presi
dential opponent of the late President Park Chung Hee
Kim was convicted last year on what the Carter admin
istration described as far-fetched charges of rebellion. His
death sentence was commuted to an indefinite term in
prison one day after President Reagan announced in Janu
ary that he was inviting Chun to visit the United States.
The South Korean amnesty announcement came on the
same day that Amnesty International in London an
nounced that it was launching a worldwide campaign
against what it called political imprisonment and torture
in South Korea. It called upon Chun to release some 500 po
litical prisoners, including Kim Dae Jung.
Reagan attacks 'interest groups*
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, going on the
attack yesterday for the first time on behalf of his econom
ic package, denounced the "political gauntlet of interest
groups" that are fighting his government spending cuts.
"I'm finding it increasingly difficult not to call some of
(them) selfish interest groups,"' the president said.
Reagan took to the offensive in a speech to 2000 local
government officials attending a convention of the Na
tional League of Cities here. His comments came three
days after a labor-led coalition of 157 organizations was
tormed to battle his proposed spending reductions, esti
mated to total around $46 billion for the 1982 fiscal year
starting Oct. 1.
Reagan's speech to the local government officials
marked the first time that he has spoken out publicly for
his economic plan since unveiling it Feb. 18 in an address
to a joint session of Congress. Since then, the president
largely has been preoccupied with foreign policy and left it
to his top aides to lobby publicly for his package of spend
ing cuts, tax reductions and regulatory reform.

Patrol force in Sinai is expected
Cairo, Egypt — The United States has concluded five
days of preliminary talks with Israel and Egypt that are
expected to lead to formation of a multinational border
force to guarantee their peace treaty, now almost two
years old.
The American negotiator, Michael Sterner, deputy as
sistant secretary of state, said that no serious obstacles re
main "We can be reasonably confident that we will man
age to form the multinational force," he said.
The United States pledged when the treaty was signed
on March 26,1979, that it would seek a U.N. or other multi
national military force to patrol the most sensitive area of
the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula along the Israeli border and
the Gulf of Aqaba when Israel withdraws from its last Si
nai positions on April 25,1982. (Israel occupied the Sinai in
1967 but has partially withdrawn.)
Since the United Nations has never recognized the
Egyptian-Israeli treaty and the Soviet Union warned that
it would veto any plan to send a U.N.-sponsored buffer
zone force, the United States now bears the responsibility
of organizing within a year a multinational force that is ac

ceptable to both Israel and Egypt.
If such problems as recruiting should delay formation of
the force, Israel may refuse to make its final withdrawal
from the Sinai in April, 1982, as called for in the treaty
timetable.
Stocks show sixth straight gain
A final-hour rally pushed stock prices higher yesterday,
giving the market its sixth straight advance.

since the opening bell and off more than 5 points shortly
after noon, reversed its course late in the session to finish
with a gain of 3.41 to 977.99 in active trading.
Today's weather

chance of rain tomorrow. Lows in the 40s. Highs in the 60s
