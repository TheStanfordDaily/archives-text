# Academic organizations lose funding
## 
### Cynthia Santana 
A moratorium on the funding func
tion of the Academic Organization
Board (AOB) has been declared by the
ASSU Senate until the academic ob
jectives of the board are met.
The AOB is comprised of elected
representatives from 23 of the regis
tered academic organizations on cam
pus, including departmental and pre
professional groups. The groups do not
receive fee assessments. As stated in
the ASSU by-laws, the purpose of the
board is to coordinate and represent
all these organizations, and to develop
groups in areas of student interest.
Three weeks ago the senate ap
proved a recommendation to delete
the Standing Committee of the AOB. It
was the function of the committee to
review all funding requests and al
locate them to any organizations,
members or not.
Senator Dave Phelps, a represent
ative of the ASSU Finance Committee
serving as an ex-officio board mem
ber, said the AOB was only serving its
financial function without fulfilling its
academic obligations.
"Funding was taken away to see if
AOB could stand on its own two feet
academically," Phelps said.
According to Phelps, the organiza
tion of the AOB precluded efficient al
location of funds.
"There was a lack of continuity
from year to year. The chairman was
elected quarterly. Funds from the pre
vious spring quarter were mis
allocated," Phelps said.
The board now elects a chairman,
and a deputy chairman who serves as
an apprentice to assume the chair

manship the subsequent quarter,
Phelps explained.
In the past, a committee of seven
AOB members was elected to allocate
funds quarterly. The recommendation
passed by the senate requires AOB to
submit an annual budget three weeks
into spring quarter for evaluation by
the ASSU finance committee. If met
with approval, the finance committee
will recommend to the senate the al
location of board funds which will
most likely be passed.
Phelps outlined the reasons the sen
ate "decided to take a look at the AOB
rather than just disband it."
First, according to Phelps, the AOB
is the only academic outlet the senate
has.
Second, it is more efficient to al
locate money to a board rather than
individual groups. Doing so would be
"a potential overload on the fee
assessment committee," he said.
Third, the senate wanted the AOB to
"stay up to the academic purposes
stated in the by-laws,"
Phelps said if the AOB fails to serve
its purpose, "it will be necessary to
find an alternative or to dissolve the
AOB."
Keith Naylor, an ex-officio member
to the board from the Office of Student
Activities (OSA), views the change fa
vorably.
"I see it more of a positive thing
rather than a negative thing," he said.
"It will help the groups to come to
gether and to strengthen relations
within their respective departments
by strengthening relations with one
another."
"From my perspective, I see a lot of

student organizations with ways to co
operate, help and support one another,
whereas the organizations tend to see
themselves being distinct from one
another," Naylor said.
Bryan Boghosian, current chair
man of the AOB, said the "impact on
individual groups was really mixed."
He said submitting a funding proposal
for the year was frowned upon by
many of the groups, but he felt it would
become easier for them after they got
used to doing it.
According to Boghosian, the han
dling of allocations could easily be
done by the AOB as the senate, "but
the senate had some doubts about
members of groups making alloca
tions for themselves," he said.
Without a funding function, the AOB
will be inspired to do other things and
prove itself as a viable organization,
Boghosian said.
"I think the AOB will continue to ex
ist, but we're in a bad position," he
said. "The AOB did do a lot of funding
over the past four years. Now there
are a whole bunch of other groups,
such as OS A, who have taken up the
slack in helping student organizations.
It will be difficult to find some
purpose. There is a lack of enthusiasm
because there were organizations
which were only involved for money.
But this quarter we're concentrating
on finding some purposes and getting
started rolling," he said.
Currently, the AOB is working to
put together a directory of all the or
ganizations to permit "greater ease of
communication groups," Boghosian
said.

locate them to any organizations,
members or not.
Senator Dave Phelps, a represent
ative of the ASSU Finance Committee
serving as an ex-officio board mem
ber, said the AOB was only serving its
financial function without fulfilling its
academic obligations.
"Funding was taken away to see if
AOB could stand on its own two feet
academically," Phelps said.
According to Phelps, the organiza
tion of the AOB precluded efficient al
location of funds.
"There was a lack of continuity
from year to year. The chairman was
elected quarterly. Funds from the pre
vious spring quarter were mis
allocated," Phelps said.
The board now elects a chairman,
and a deputy chairman who serves as
an apprentice to assume the chair

manship the subsequent quarter,
Phelps explained.
In the past, a committee of seven
AOB members was elected to allocate
funds quarterly. The recommendation
passed by the senate requires AOB to
submit an annual budget three weeks
into spring quarter for evaluation by
the ASSU finance committee. If met
with approval, the finance committee
will recommend to the senate the al
location of board funds which will
most likely be passed.
Phelps outlined the reasons the sen
ate "decided to take a look at the AOB
rather than just disband it."
First, according to Phelps, the AOB
is the only academic outlet the senate
has.
Second, it is more efficient to al
locate money to a board rather than
individual groups. Doing so would be
"a potential overload on the fee
assessment committee," he said.
Third, the senate wanted the AOB to
"stay up to the academic purposes
stated in the by-laws,"
Phelps said if the AOB fails to serve
its purpose, "it will be necessary to
find an alternative or to dissolve the
AOB."
Keith Naylor, an ex-officio member
to the board from the Office of Student
Activities (OSA), views the change fa
vorably.
"I see it more of a positive thing
rather than a negative thing," he said.
"It will help the groups to come to
gether and to strengthen relations
within their respective departments
by strengthening relations with one
another."
"From my perspective, I see a lot of

student organizations with ways to co
operate, help and support one another,
whereas the organizations tend to see
themselves being distinct from one
another," Naylor said.
Bryan Boghosian, current chair
man of the AOB, said the "impact on
individual groups was really mixed."
He said submitting a funding proposal
for the year was frowned upon by
many of the groups, but he felt it would
become easier for them after they got
used to doing it.
According to Boghosian, the han
dling of allocations could easily be
done by the AOB as the senate, "but
the senate had some doubts about
members of groups making alloca
tions for themselves," he said.
Without a funding function, the AOB
will be inspired to do other things and
prove itself as a viable organization,
Boghosian said.
"I think the AOB will continue to ex
ist, but we're in a bad position," he
said. "The AOB did do a lot of funding
over the past four years. Now there
are a whole bunch of other groups,
such as OS A, who have taken up the
slack in helping student organizations.
It will be difficult to find some
purpose. There is a lack of enthusiasm
because there were organizations
which were only involved for money.
But this quarter we're concentrating
on finding some purposes and getting
started rolling," he said.
Currently, the AOB is working to
put together a directory of all the or
ganizations to permit "greater ease of
communication groups," Boghosian
said.
A moratorium on the funding func
tion of the Academic Organization
Board (AOB) has been declared by the
ASSU Senate until the academic ob
jectives of the board are met.
The AOB is comprised of elected
representatives from 23 of the regis
tered academic organizations on cam
pus, including departmental and pre
professional groups. The groups do not
receive fee assessments. As stated in
the ASSU by-laws, the purpose of the
board is to coordinate and represent
all these organizations, and to develop
groups in areas of student interest.
Three weeks ago the senate ap
proved a recommendation to delete
the Standing Committee of the AOB. It
was the function of the committee to
review all funding requests and al
locate them to any organizations,
members or not.
