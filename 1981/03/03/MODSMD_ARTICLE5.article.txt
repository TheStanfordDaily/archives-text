# Professor fired during '71 campus unrest
## Franklin reinstatement case goes to court 
### Helen Casabona 
After a decade of battles with the University,
former Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin's
case seeking reinstatement returns to the Santa
Clara County Courthouse in San Jose, for a legal
showdown on March 13.
Franklin was fired from the faculty in 1971 for in
citing disruption and violence on campus in a five
minute White Plaza speech. Next week's hearing,
with Judge John Flaherty presiding, will be the final
round before the case moves to the higher courts.
In his speech, Franklin denounced the Univer
sity's cooperation with the government in Vietnam,
and urged students to shut down the computer cen
ter, where war tactics applicable to the fighting in
Indo-China were being simulated.
Represented by the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), Franklin, an avowed Maoist, is
challenging the University on the issues of freedom
of speech and the severity of his punishment.
Last year, the Faculty Advisory Board
ruled for the second time that dismissing Franklin
was the proper action to take. Since then, Stanford
has filed a legal motion that this decision be af
firmed by the court.
Margaret Crosby, Franklin's lawyer and ACLU
representative, filed a cross motion that Franklin's
punishment be lessened.
Now the combatants go back to the courts, and af
ter nine years of battles, the ACLU estimates that
Stanford has spent approximately $400,000 on the
case.
If Flaherty rules against Franklin in this hearing,
Crosby says that "there is a 100 percent chance"

that she will file an appeal in the First District Court
of Appeals in California. In any case, she continues,
it will be at least five years before all the litigations
are resolved.
The University originally charged Franklin with
three offenses: inciting disruption at the computer
center in a White Plaza speech, urging students to
disobey police orders to disperse and inciting vio
lence in an Old Union speech.
In a hearing last year, Flaherty ruled that the first
two charges were legitimate complaints, but that
Franklin's Old Union speech was protected under
the First Amendment.
Crosby asks, "Can the University fire him for this
or should a lesser sanction be approved?"
Also, because lesser sanctions have been issued to
faculty members in the past who have committed
acts of violence, while Franklin was charged with
only inciting violence, Crosby says that "it is ob
vious that he is being punished for his political be
liefs. And that is unconstitutional."
Concerning the claim that freedom of speech and
Franklin's Maoist convictions are issues in this
case, Stanford attorney David Heilbron says,
"There is not a single shred of evidence on which
that argument can be made."
These offenses are not protected by freedom of
speech because they are charges of incitement, he
explained.
Stanford claims the right to handle University-re
lated matters on its own. Stresses Heilbron. "What
we are talking about is the University's right to dis
cipline the incitation of campus disruptions, and we
are not discussing freedom of speech. "
While Crosby concedes that the courts should not

interfere in day-to-day university issues, she said,
"This is light years from a day-to-day university
matter. It's a landmark academic freedom case."
As to the possible impact of this case, Crosby said
that a victory will "broadcast that public dissent is
tolerable" and encourage faculties nation wide to
watch how university resources are being used.
She pointed out that if tomorrow Harvard were to
program its computer to devise offensive tactics for
El Salvador, "we would want someone to stand up
against them."
If Franklin loses, Crosby continued, "It will be a
green light to all administrations to stifle dissent."
In response to the question of whether the passage
of 10 years may have changed the court's attitude
towards Franklin's case, Crosby said, "The per
ception of the government's role in Vietnam, and the
faculty's perception of this role has matured. They
can tolerate more now. "
Also, since campus dissension is much tamer
now, there is "less of a terror" of faculty protest,
she added.
But according to Heilbron, there is no way to pre
dict how time has affected this case. "I don't want to
speculate on the court's attitude," he says.
Franklin is now an English professor at Rutgers
University in New Jersey where he has just received
tenure. Since being ousted from Stanford, he has
taught at Yale University and Wesleyan University.
But during the three years after his dismissal, he
was on welfare because no other university would
hire him. "People pictured him mashing com
puters. He was a casualty of the Vietnam war," said
Crosby.
