## Reagan watches Europe explore Mideast options 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The Reagan
administration appears to be
less antagonistic than was the
Carter administration to the
continuing effort by western
Europe to search independently
in the Middle East for new ap
proaches to the Palestinian
problem.
Detailed discussion of the Eu
ropean initiative in the Middle
East by British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and Foreign
Minister Lord Carrington in
their talks with President
Ronald Reagan and Secretary of
State Alexander Haig last week
calmed official concern here
that the European effort could
conflict with what Reagan even
tually decides to do about the
deadlocked American-spon
sored Egyptian-Israeli nego
tiations on Palestinian auton
omy, according to both British
and American officials.
"The talks cleared away a
certain amount of misun
derstanding," said a well-in
formed British official. Report
ing that Haig said he recognized
there was a role for Europe to
play in the search for peace in
the Middle East, the official
added that the British found "a
little more openness" on this
question in their talks with the
Reagan administration.
Changed perceptions
A senior State Department of
ficial said that by the end of the
discussion of the Middle East by
British and American officials
"perceptions on both sides had
changed somewhat" and it ap
peared that the European and
American efforts in the Middle
East were "manageable and in
tegra table."
"Both sides have a better un
derstanding now," the State De
partment official said. "The
U.S. realizes that the (Europe
an) Common Market countries
have a vital interest in peace in
the Middle East and the British
now understand that we are con
cerned that what they do should
be complementary and not cut
across" what the United States
decides to do next.
Haig told British reporters
traveling with Thatcher that
their talks "clearly indicated
that the objectives of European
involvement in (the Mideast)
coincide with our own objec
tives in the broad sense of the
term."
Thatcher and other European
officials said they do not expect
the Reagan administration to do
much about the Arab-Israeli im
passe until after the Israeli elec
tions in June. Meanwhile. Dutch
Foreign Minister Christophe
van der Klaauw, representing
the 10 European Common Mar
ket nations, will be touring the
Middle East seeking reaction to
a 30-page western Europe draft
of optional approaches to the
Arab-Israeli and Palestinian
problems.
Among these options, which
have stirred increased opposi
tion to the European effort by
Israel and some strongly pro-Is
raeli advisers to the Reagan ad
ministration, are withdrawal of
Israeli troops and settlements

from all Arab territory oc
cupied since 1967, dividing Jeru
salem betwen Israel and Jordan
or putting east Jerusalem under
some form of international con
trol. and having all of the
former Arab inhabitants of
Palestine vote in a referendum
on whether they want an inde
pendent Palestinian state out
side Israel's 1967 borders or be
federated with either Israel or
Jordan.
Common Market summits
After van der Klaauw com
pletes his consultations with
Middle East leaders, he will re
port back to the leaders of the
Common Market countries who
could then take further action at
one of their regularly scheduled
summit meetings this summer.
In a declaration on the Middle
East at a summit last year in
Venice, the western European
leaders laid down two principles
they believed essential for a
peace settlement: recognition
of the Palestinian right to self
determination in some form and
the recognition by the Palesti
nians. including the Palestine
Liberation Organization, of Is
rael's right to exist within se
cure broders. The European
leaders also said it was neces
sary for the PLO to be involved,
along with other represent
atives of the Palestinians, in ne
gotiations on the Palestinians'
future.
Carrington. who said recently
that he would not rule out meet
ing personally with PLO leader
Yassar Arafat, repeated during
his vist here that no matter how
distasteful PLO terrorist acts
may be, "it isn't any good ignor
ing the facts of life," such as the
PLO's representation of a large
number of Palestinians. He
pointed out that if Britain had
ignored Third World
leaders like Jomo Kenyatta in
Kenya, Makarios in Cyprus or
Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, it
would have been unable to make
progress in solving those coloni
al problems.
American diplomats see the
European initiative as primari
ly an effort to curry favor with
oil-rich Arab countries in the
Middle East who provide
western Europe much of its
energy and one of its major ex
port markets. European
diplomats say their effort is
necessary to prevent total
estrangement from the West of
moderate Arab leaders who be
lieve the Carter adminis
tration's Camp David peace
process has reached a dead end
and the U.S. remains insensitive
to the rights of the Palestinians.
Low expectations
Neither American nor Eu
ropean diplomats expect the
European effort to produce any
dramatic results before the Is
raeli elections or the Reagan ad
ministration's formulation of
its policy on the Arab-Israeli im
passe and the Palestinian prob
lem. French sources, who stress
the unusual European "con
vergence" and close coopera
tion inside the Common Market
on this issue, speculate that the
Reagan administration may
eventually be persuaded to

move U.S. policy closer to the
European perception that any
comprehensive peace plan for
the Middle East requires satis
faction of Palestinian self-de
termination.
Noting the Reagan adminis
tration's recently announced
shift of priorities in the Middle
East from former President
Jimmy Carter's Camp David
negotiations between Egypt and
Israel on Palestinian autonomy
to "the deteriorating position of
the west vis-a-vis the Soviet
Union" in that region, one sen
ior French official said "our
very strong view is that there is
only one way we can stop Soviet
penetration in that part of the
world, and that is by solving the
Palestinian problem."
Asked about official Ameri
can skepticism that the Europe
ans can ever accomplish much
with their initiative, particular
ly so long as it is strongly op
posed by Israel, French foreign
minister Jean Francois-Poncet
said at the end of his consulta
tions with the Reagan adminis
tration here last week that "I
don't think the countries of the
Middle East can ignore the posi
tion of a united Europe."

leaders like Jomo Kenyatta in
Kenya, Makarios in Cyprus or

would have been unable to make
progress in solving those coloni
al problems.
American diplomats see the
European initiative as primari
ly an effort to curry favor with
oil-rich Arab countries in the
Middle East who provide
western Europe much of its
energy and one of its major ex
port markets. European
diplomats say their effort is
necessary to prevent total
estrangement from the West of
moderate Arab leaders who be
lieve the Carter adminis
tration's Camp David peace
process has reached a dead end
and the U.S. remains insensitive
to the rights of the Palestinians.
Low expectations
Neither American nor Eu
ropean diplomats expect the
European effort to produce any
dramatic results before the Is
raeli elections or the Reagan ad
ministration's formulation of
its policy on the Arab-Israeli im
passe and the Palestinian prob
lem. French sources, who stress
the unusual European "con
vergence" and close coopera
tion inside the Common Market
on this issue, speculate that the
Reagan administration may
eventually be persuaded to

move U.S. policy closer to the
European perception that any
comprehensive peace plan for
the Middle East requires satis
faction of Palestinian self-de
termination.
Noting the Reagan adminis
tration's recently announced
shift of priorities in the Middle
East from former President
Jimmy Carter's Camp David
negotiations between Egypt and
Israel on Palestinian autonomy
to "the deteriorating position of
the west vis-a-vis the Soviet
Union" in that region, one sen

very strong view is that there is
only one way we can stop Soviet
penetration in that part of the
world, and that is by solving the
Palestinian problem."
Asked about official Ameri
can skepticism that the Europe
ans can ever accomplish much
with their initiative, particular
ly so long as it is strongly op
posed by Israel, French foreign
minister Jean Francois-Poncet
said at the end of his consulta

tration here last week that "I
don't think the countries of the
Middle East can ignore the posi
tion of a united Europe."

Washington — The Reagan
administration appears to be
less antagonistic than was the
Carter administration to the
continuing effort by western
Europe to search independently
in the Middle East for new ap
proaches to the Palestinian
problem.
Detailed discussion of the Eu
ropean initiative in the Middle
East by British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and Foreign
Minister Lord Carrington in
their talks with President
Ronald Reagan and Secretary of
State Alexander Haig last week
calmed official concern here
that the European effort could
conflict with what Reagan even
tually decides to do about the
deadlocked American-spon
sored Egyptian-Israeli nego
tiations on Palestinian auton
omy, according to both British
and American officials.
"The talks cleared away a
certain amount of misun
derstanding," said a well-in
formed British official. Report
ing that Haig said he recognized
there was a role for Europe to
play in the search for peace in
the Middle East, the official
added that the British found "a
little more openness" on this
question in their talks with the
Reagan administration.
Changed perceptions
A senior State Department of
ficial said that by the end of the
discussion of the Middle East by
British and American officials
"perceptions on both sides had
changed somewhat" and it ap
peared that the European and
American efforts in the Middle
East were "manageable and in
tegra table."
"Both sides have a better un
derstanding now," the State De
partment official said. "The
U.S. realizes that the (Europe
an) Common Market countries
have a vital interest in peace in
the Middle East and the British
now understand that we are con
cerned that what they do should
be complementary and not cut
across" what the United States
decides to do next.
Haig told British reporters
traveling with Thatcher that
their talks "clearly indicated
that the objectives of European
involvement in (the Mideast)
coincide with our own objec
tives in the broad sense of the
term."
Thatcher and other European
officials said they do not expect
the Reagan administration to do
much about the Arab-Israeli im
passe until after the Israeli elec
tions in June. Meanwhile. Dutch
Foreign Minister Christophe
van der Klaauw, representing
the 10 European Common Mar
ket nations, will be touring the
Middle East seeking reaction to
a 30-page western Europe draft
of optional approaches to the
Arab-Israeli and Palestinian
problems.
Among these options, which
have stirred increased opposi
tion to the European effort by
Israel and some strongly pro-Is
raeli advisers to the Reagan ad
ministration, are withdrawal of
Israeli troops and settlements

from all Arab territory oc
cupied since 1967, dividing Jeru
salem betwen Israel and Jordan
or putting east Jerusalem under
some form of international con
trol. and having all of the
former Arab inhabitants of
Palestine vote in a referendum
on whether they want an inde
pendent Palestinian state out
side Israel's 1967 borders or be
federated with either Israel or
Jordan.
Common Market summits
After van der Klaauw com
pletes his consultations with
Middle East leaders, he will re
port back to the leaders of the
Common Market countries who
could then take further action at
one of their regularly scheduled
summit meetings this summer.
In a declaration on the Middle
East at a summit last year in
Venice, the western European
leaders laid down two principles
they believed essential for a
peace settlement: recognition
of the Palestinian right to self
determination in some form and
the recognition by the Palesti
nians. including the Palestine
Liberation Organization, of Is
rael's right to exist within se
cure broders. The European
leaders also said it was neces
sary for the PLO to be involved,
along with other represent
atives of the Palestinians, in ne
gotiations on the Palestinians'
future.
Carrington. who said recently
that he would not rule out meet
ing personally with PLO leader
Yassar Arafat, repeated during
his vist here that no matter how
distasteful PLO terrorist acts
may be, "it isn't any good ignor
ing the facts of life," such as the
PLO's representation of a large
number of Palestinians. He
pointed out that if Britain had
ignored Third World
leaders like Jomo Kenyatta in
Kenya, Makarios in Cyprus or
Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, it
would have been unable to make
progress in solving those coloni
