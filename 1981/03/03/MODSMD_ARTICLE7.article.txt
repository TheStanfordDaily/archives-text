# Sihanouk's proposed alliance jeopardizes Khmer Rouge plan for anti- Vietnam front

From the Daily wire services
Bangkok — Prince Norodom Sihanouk's
announcement this mopth that he is ready to
head a provisional coalition government
with the Khmer Rouge and other Cambo
dian opposition groups appears to have
jeopardized plans by the Khmer Rouge and
the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front (FNLPK) to form their own anti-
Vietnamese alliance.
Son Sann, former prime minister to
Sihanouk when the latter was Cambodian
"head of state and now chief of the FNLPK,
said at his jungle headquarters in western
Cambodia last week that ongoing nego
tiations between his front and the ousted
Khmer Rouge government had been out
distanced by the nine-point coalition pro
gram announced by Sihanouk on Feb. 8 from
his headquarters in Pyong Yang, the North
Korean capital.
According to observers here, it is precise
ly because the prince felt the rapproche
ment between the front and the Khmer
Rouge might leave him out in the cold that
he decided to step in and seize the initiative.
Consolidates position
Since the end of last year the FNLPK had
been seeking to reunite Cambodian opposi
tion groups by consolidating the Khmer
Rouge hold on Kampuchea's (Cambodia's)
seat in the United Nations and improving its
image internationally by getting the Khmer
Rouge leadership to phase out its least ac
ceptable members.
At the end of December Son Sann went to
Beijing with FNPLK Vice President Chea
Vam and the front's military commander.
General Dien Dell. Early last month Son
Sann met in Bangkok with Singapore Vice
Premier Sinnathamby Rajaratnam and
Thai Foreign Minister Sithi Sawetasila. And
shortly afterwards the FNPLK chief met

with Khmer Rouge Prime Minister Khieu
Samphan, though both sides subsequently
indicated the meeting yielded no immediate
result.
The FNLPK, fully aware of the hostility
Cambodians feel towards the Khmer Rouge
regime that decimated the population dur
ing its four years in power, has been much
more demanding than Sihanouk toward the
Khmer Rouge. Although the prince sees
Khieu Samphan as a potential prime min
ister in his projected new government, the
FNPLK will have no dealings with a coali
tion that includes Khmer Rouge ministers.
The Khmer Rouge, meanwhile, declined
to put their forces, estimated to be 30,000
strong, under FNLPK command. However,
this obstacle may have been sidestepped by
an agreement in principle to maintain two
separate armies — a communist Khmer
Rouge force and a non-communist Cambo
dian force, both receiving equal aid from
China.
Talks continue
Although the talks between the FNLPK
and the Khmer Rouge have yielded no result
so far, they are expected to continue. At the
same time, Sihanouk s project has now put
everything back into the melting pot, while
giving encouragement to the Khmer Rouge.
Khieu Samphan is one of the "leading fig
ures" the prince has in mind for the pre
miership of his coalition, along with his
former prime ministers Penn Nouth and
Son Sann.
Although the FNPLK has so far received
no formal approach from the prince, Son
Sann indicated Thursday that he would
"turn down no initiative that could make the
Vietnamese leave Cambodia."
The FNLPK has found it strange that the
prince has chosen to entrust Penn Nouth,
who lives in France, with the task of convey

ing an invitation to Son Sann to attend the
meeting that has been arranged in
Pyong Yang early next month with Khieu
Samphan. The prince, in fact, already has a
, permanent liaison officer with the FNPLK
here in Bangkok.
Some of Sihanouk's own followers seem
even less abreast of his plans than the
FNPLK. Contacted at his outpost in west
Cambodia Thursday, Nhem Sophon, leader
of the tiny Sihanoukist Kampuchean Na
tional Liberation Movement (Moulinaka),
said he was unaware of the prince's
statement earlier this month in Pyongyang.
It is improbable that Son Sann would be
prepared to attend the Pyongyang meeting,
even if he were to receive an invitaiton at
this late date.
The FNLPK can be expected to bide their
time and see how the Sihanouk's project
shapes up. It is certainly intent on prevent
ing the Vietnamese-backed Heng Samrin re
gime in Phnom Penh from taking over Cam
bodian representation at the United Na
tions, still retained by the ousted Khmer
Rouge regime.
According to observers here, one of the
projects the prince will find most difficult to
persuade his future coalition partners to ac
cept is to dispense with the "Democratic
Kampuchea" label, as the Khmer Rouge re
gime still styles itself, and resume the term
"Cambodia."
For two years the United Nations has
wrangled over the incumbency of the Cam
bodian seat in the General Assembly. In set
ting up a third Cambodian regime under yet
another name, legitimate entitlement to the
U.N. seat would be compromised, the new
"Cambodia" having in the eyes of some
countries as little claim to it as the usurpers
from Phnom Penh, who have the advantage
of controlling the country.
