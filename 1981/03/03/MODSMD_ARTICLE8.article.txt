# Beijing protests sub sale

### 
Beijing (AP) — China sent a
clear signal to the United States
last week when it protested the
sale of Dutch submarines to
Taiwan by demanding recall of
the Dutch ambassador and
downgrading of diplomatic ties:
the United States can expect the
same if it continues to sell weap
ons to the rival government on
Taiwan.
China's action — taken after
three months of urging, warning
and threats — was meant to
show that China's opposition to
the arms sales is real, not
rhetorical.
It also demonstrated that af
ter more than 30 years, the is
land of Taiwan remains main
land China's crown territorial
jewel, and reunification with
the mainland is still a fixture of
Chinese foreign policy.

News analysis

"The American people will
understand the implications of
the Dutch sale," a high govern
ment official told The As
sociated Press.
On Friday, China demanded
the recall of the Dutch am
bassador to China and recalled
its own ambassador from the
Hague. It demanded that diplo
matic relations between the two
nations be reduced from the em
bassy level to that of an office
staffed by a charge d'affaires.
China took the step after the
Dutch Parliament refused to re
scind its decision allowing a
private firm to sell two sub
marines to Taiwan — the first
such arms sale by the Dutch.
China contended that the sale
inteferes in its internal affairs
because what it refers to as
"Taiwan province" is an inte
gral part of China.
The case of the Netherlands
bears a striking resemblance to
that of the United States.
Last year, the United States
sold millions of dollars worth of
military equipment to Taiwan.
Last summer, the State Depart
ment said it would permit U.S.
companies to discuss the sale of
advanced warplanes to Taiwan.
Beijing has said such sales vi
olate the Jan. 1, 1979 Com
munique on Establishment of
Diplomatic Relations between
China and the United States.
The two nations agreed Taiwan
is an inalienable part of China
and that the sole legal govern
ment of China is in Beijing.
But the Reagan adminis
tration points to the Taiwan Re
lations Act, which was passed
by Congress not long after the
communique was issued and
which expresses "concern" for
Taiwan's security — a clause
approved over China's strong
objection.
For its part, China refuses to
recognize the act, saying it is
merely a domestic law. "It is
valid only in the United States
and has no effect on us in Chi
na," the Chinese official said.
"How would the United
States feel," he asked, "if China
expressed concern about the se
curity of Hawaii and passed a
Hawaii Relations Act?"
