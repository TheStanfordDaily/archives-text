# 'A Scream From Silence'
## Rape film angers students 
### Simran Singh 
"I would not recommend this
film being shown again," said
Patricia Brandt in a discussion
that followed a showing of
"Scream from Silence," Anne-
Claire Poirier's film about rape,
Thursday in Arroyo House.
Brandt, Assistant Director of
the Office of Student Activities,
said "We have had enough said
about women as victims."
About half the audience seemed
to agree with her.
In any case, hardly anyone
was indifferent to the film and
most reacted very personally.

'I would not recommend this film being
shown again — we have had enough said
about women as victims.' — Patricia
Brandt, Assistant Director of the Office of
Student Activities

The film, presented by Resi
dential Education and the Rape
Education Project, was ad
vertised as beginning with a
very explicit rape scene, which
one of the coordinators later
said "might attract the
weirdos to what they think will
be pornography. But let them
come anyway, dammit."
The film is indeed very
brutally honest about rape. The
act itself is shown step by step.
But unlike most Hollywood
films this film shows rape from
the woman's point of view —
that is, not of man as attacker
but of woman as attacked.

The film then follows the af
termath of the rape victim This
includes police formalities of
photographing the naked wom
an for court records
But what this woman,
Suzanne, has lost is not only her
dignity and self respect but also
her ability to love at all.
Two months after the rape, in
a scene that closely parallels
the first time she comes home
after being attacked, she kills
herself.
For a film called "Scream
from Silence," the film mostly
shows the silence. But what it

urges is the scream.
Most of the other raped wom
en in the film say they suffered
from guilt and shame, they felt
like the accused and most spent
their lives silently dying within.

Analysis

Part of the effect comes from
the montage that cuts scenes
from Suzanne's life with
documentary film about war
raped women in Vietnam and
Bangladesh — a way of making
past and present, one. Of mak
ing all women victims silent
ones.

'Rape always stays with you. The film was
very realistic that way.' — a member of the
audience

Gail Price, who is part of a
women's self-defense collective
said, "This is not a film that
should be shown without a fol
low up discussion."
Most of the women watching
the film were upset by the end
ing. They felt women need to be
inspired, to be persuaded that
they are strong, that they can

fight back. Not as the film ends,
with a defeated woman commit
ting suicide.
A man responded differently.
In tears, he said, "My girlfriend
is abroad and I've often felt the
rape instinct when I look at pret
ty girls here. This film made me
feel very guilty. I needed it."
Some of the women in the au
dience had been attacked and
they thought the film was good
because it showed that the ef
fects of rape never leave you.
"It always stays with you," they
said, "the film was very re
alistic that way."
One of the men walked out af
ter the rape scene because
"This film is nothing but porno
graphy," he said.
Which was unfortunate be
cause many of the questions,
doubts, and suspicions raised in
the first half an hour were an
swered in the latter part of the
film.
The film tried to show why
men rape and what the effects of
rape are on women.
What the film does not offer is
a solution. The ending is a
negative one — Suzanne, the vic
tim, unable to wean herself back
to life commits suicide.
Of course, the film's ending
may be strategic itself. Perhaps
the director ends purposely on
this negative note to arouse a vi
olent protest from women, in
short, to make them scream
from silence.
Suzanne's story is told to us in
an interesting form. It is a film
within a film — Suzanne's film
is made by two women directors
who show parts of the rape, then
stop the screening to discuss
how that would go off with the
audience.

So we get different points of
view within the film itself. More
questions are raised.
For instance, while editing
the rape scene, we are shown
the directors discussing wheth
er the scene might sexually
arouse male viewers. So they
have to be very careful to be ex

plicit but not sexually exciting.
The rape is never shown with
the man and woman together
because, as the director says.
"Rape does not form a couple."
The film is cut from man to
woman, but not to both at the
same time.
If it can be called that, it is a
beautiful film about rape. Beau
tifully done, that is.
What it gives us is awareness,

depth, and response.
It is not a film where you can
sit back and relax.
Many of the women watched
the film in tears and so did some
of the men. And although many
felt very violently against the
woman-as-victim aspect of the
film it was impossible not to
have a personal response.
It was presented by Residen
tial Education and the Rape
Education Project.
