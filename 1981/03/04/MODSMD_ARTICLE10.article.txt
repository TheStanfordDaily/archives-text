## DNA research: Where should science end and regulation begin? 
### Andreas Becker 
At the onset of the debate over
regulating recombinant DNA
research, it was scientists who
first expressed concern over the
potential effects of their re
search on the public. They were
concerned that molecules and
organisms of their experiments
might bear some yet-unknown
hazards to coworkers or the
public.
Their concerns have become,
however, exclusively confined
to the problem of risk
assessment and prevention.
At the Conference of
Asilomar on recombinant DNA
and potential hazards, a
statement was agreed upon
which stressed the ignorance of
the scientific community about
the potential risk probabilities,
but also the intention to con
tinue work under prinicples of
physical and biological contain
ment.
As a result, the assembled

scientists presented regulation
guidelines to the National In
stitute of Health.
However, this was achieved
only with extensive pressure
from non-scientists who em
phasized possible lawsuits that
could be brought against re
searchers if their experiments
caused an accident, as in an un
controllable epidemic.
A.nd once the scientific com
munity dealing with molecular
genetics had accustomed itself
to the new development, they
started to take over its man
agement. Risk assessment and
"worst case" probabilities have
become technical, scientific
and thus familiar problems.
Gradually, the level of re
striction has steadily been low
ered. Proponents of the re
search justify this, arguing that
while working under the
guidelines set by the Asilomar
Conference no serious accidents
occurred.

This is negative proof, how
ever. and does not add informa
tion for the assignment of risk
probabilities.
As long as no accident has oc
curred. and new experiments
with different risks are con
ducted regularly, all risk
assessments are necessarily ar
bitrary. There are no guaran
tees for the "best" case.
Ethical and philosophical
problems can also be raised.
There are those who question
not only the "harmlessness" of
genetic engineering, but also
contemporary man's com
petence and knowledge as a
whole. Are we ready to cross
borders that have developed in
evolution through mechanisms
we do not even fully under
stand?
Yet many scientists do not
concern themselves with
philosophical and ethical im
plications of their work. They
regard their results as value
free and deny any responsibility

for their application.
Philosophical or metaphysical
considerations are disregarded
as "nonscientific."
Another question being dis
cussed is the interaction of sci
ence and society. Most scien
tists accept the notion that this
relation is two-fold: their re
search is funded by the public,
and their work affects society
not only in its hazards, but also
in its implications.
Genetic researchers regard
this argument as valid as re
gards hazards and agree to pub
lic control over procedures. But
they don't consent to the pub
lic's right to choose the content
and objective of scientific re
search. I believe these choices
should not be left to individuals,
but should be subject to public,
democratic decisions.
A final point is related to an
application of genetic engineer
ing that is usually stressed by
proponents of this technology.

It is the "hope" that E. coli
will produce organic substances
like hormones or enzymes that
are known to help to cure human
diseases, such as Insulin, a
growth hormone and Interferon.
But some diseases result
from several causes. Tradi
tional medicine relies on
diagnosis and prescription,
while in recent years new ap
proaches have also developed.
Preventative medicine and
holistic medicine are two ex
amples.
These take into account en
vironmental, psychological and
personal-history factors in
analyzing sickness.
The cheap production of new.
effective, body-own drugs will
provide strong support for tradi
tional prescriptions.
For this approach ignores the
multifactorial causes of dis
eases. so that efforts to change
the social and cultural condi
tions affecting health are de
nied.

At the onset of the debate over
regulating recombinant DNA
research, it was scientists who
first expressed concern over the
potential effects of their re
search on the public. They were
concerned that molecules and
organisms of their experiments
might bear some yet-unknown
hazards to coworkers or the
public.
Their concerns have become,
however, exclusively confined
to the problem of risk
assessment and prevention.
At the Conference of
Asilomar on recombinant DNA
and potential hazards, a
statement was agreed upon
which stressed the ignorance of
the scientific community about
the potential risk probabilities,
but also the intention to con
tinue work under prinicples of
physical and biological contain
ment.
As a result, the assembled

scientists presented regulation
guidelines to the National In
stitute of Health.
However, this was achieved
only with extensive pressure
from non-scientists who em
phasized possible lawsuits that
could be brought against re
searchers if their experiments
caused an accident, as in an un
controllable epidemic.
A.nd once the scientific com
munity dealing with molecular
genetics had accustomed itself
to the new development, they
started to take over its man
agement. Risk assessment and
"worst case" probabilities have
become technical, scientific
and thus familiar problems.
Gradually, the level of re
striction has steadily been low
ered. Proponents of the re
search justify this, arguing that
while working under the
guidelines set by the Asilomar
Conference no serious accidents
occurred.

This is negative proof, how
ever. and does not add informa
tion for the assignment of risk
probabilities.
As long as no accident has oc
curred. and new experiments
with different risks are con
ducted regularly, all risk
assessments are necessarily ar
bitrary. There are no guaran
tees for the "best" case.
Ethical and philosophical
problems can also be raised.
There are those who question
not only the "harmlessness" of
genetic engineering, but also
contemporary man's com
petence and knowledge as a
whole. Are we ready to cross
borders that have developed in
evolution through mechanisms
we do not even fully under
stand?
Yet many scientists do not
concern themselves with
philosophical and ethical im
plications of their work. They
regard their results as value
free and deny any responsibility

for their application.
Philosophical or metaphysical
considerations are disregarded
as "nonscientific."
Another question being dis
cussed is the interaction of sci
ence and society. Most scien
tists accept the notion that this
relation is two-fold: their re
search is funded by the public,
and their work affects society
not only in its hazards, but also
in its implications.
Genetic researchers regard
this argument as valid as re
gards hazards and agree to pub
lic control over procedures. But
they don't consent to the pub
lic's right to choose the content
and objective of scientific re
search. I believe these choices
should not be left to individuals,
but should be subject to public,
democratic decisions.
A final point is related to an
application of genetic engineer
ing that is usually stressed by
proponents of this technology.

It is the "hope" that E. coli
will produce organic substances
like hormones or enzymes that
are known to help to cure human
diseases, such as Insulin, a
growth hormone and Interferon.
But some diseases result
from several causes. Tradi
tional medicine relies on
diagnosis and prescription,
while in recent years new ap
proaches have also developed.
Preventative medicine and
holistic medicine are two ex
amples.
These take into account en
vironmental, psychological and
personal-history factors in
analyzing sickness.
The cheap production of new.
effective, body-own drugs will
provide strong support for tradi
tional prescriptions.
For this approach ignores the
multifactorial causes of dis
eases. so that efforts to change
the social and cultural condi
tions affecting health are de
nied.
