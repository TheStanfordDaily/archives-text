Recombinant DNA research
has become the victim of many
superstitious proclamations,
with the unfortunate result that
simple facts are being over
looked. The costs of such ig
norance may be far greater than
the supposed dangers.
Adversaries to research em
phasize the philosophical im
plications of "tinkering with
life" and the potential hazard of
generating epidemics by creat
ing a new, uncontrollable virus.
But, as Clifford Grobstein
says in his A Double Image of a
Double Helix, "We must keep in
mind that many genetic recom
ninations occur normally in na
ture. Recombination is unlikely
to bedangerousjust because it is
performed artificially." Re
combining genes is a natural
process which goes on con
tinually. It is the basis of evolu
tion.

In fact, as Stanford pre
medical and physics student
Roger Lewis points out. re
searchers work under much
more constrained circum
stances than nature does. While
nature judges creations on sur
vival (such as more resistant vi
ruses and mutations), scientists
judge on usefulness and safety.
Furthermore, researchers
utilize DNA in E. Coli bacteria,
which does not grow well in peo
ple and has usually been in the
lab so long it is inert. Epidemic
spread from laboratory experi
ments has never happened.
We can not call the controlled
development of DNA for the
production of such hormones as
insulin "tinkering with life."
Even nature does a lot more
"tinkering" than that.
Genetic research has also giv
en rise to stories of rampant
cloning. And indeed, recently
scientists were able to "clone"
an embryonic mammalian cell.
