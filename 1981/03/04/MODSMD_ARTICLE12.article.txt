# Scholars from China meet the Occident at Stanford
## 
### Richard Ross 
There are over 100 scholars
from the People's Republic of
China (PRC) at Stanford. Last
'Thursday four of them met with
Daily reporter Richard Ross to
discuss their experiences at
Stanford, Sino-U.S. relations,
the U.S. educational systems
and life in California.
The four scholars, Fu Feng
gui of the State Planning Com
mission of the PRC, Hua I)i of
the Institute of Space Technol
ogy, Zhon Yan of the Chinese
People's Institute of Foreign Af
fairs, and Wang Yingjie of the
Peking Normal University are
members of the U.S.-China Re
lations frogram here at Stan
ford. Fu and Zhon are doing re
search on foreign policy issues.
Hua is involved in strategic sys
tems analysis. Wang is study
ing the U.S. educational sys
tem.
The four scholars say that
they are happy to be at Stanford.
Wang Yingjie said he chose
Stanford over other graduate in
stitutions in the U.S. because a
Columbia professor told him
that "Stanford has the best
school of education in the nation
and less crime than New York."
Wang also said the good weather
in California influenced his de
cision. His compatriot, Fu
Fenggui, suggested that Wang
had also heard about the quality
of California wine.
Zhon Yan commented that
many of her fellow nationals did
not come to Stanford just to
study.
"If we were interested only in
books we could have stayed in
China," Fu said."We have bene
fited from contact with Ameri
cans. It has been mutually bene
ficial."
The scholars said they are in
terested in being involved in
many aspects of campus life.
Hua Di mentioned that he lec
tured in the symposium on
Southeast Asian Security last
Tuesday. Fu said that he has at
tended "brown bag lunches"
and has found them very in
teresting.
"The academic atmosphere
is very good here," Fu said.
"People make very good use of
their time."
Hua has found that the pres
ence of Japanese scholars has
made his study here very valu
able. He said tripartite dis
cussions between Japanese,

Chinese, and American sholars
have been extremely useful. He
noted that the overall feeling be
tween the U. S., China and Japan
is "pretty good," adding that
"the fourth actor, the Soviet
Union, can't be reached." Fu
mentioned that Hua had been
trained in the USSR. Both Hua
and Fu referred to current an
tagonism between the two coun
tries.
In the arena of foreign af
fairs, in which all but Wang are
expert, the overriding concern
among the scholars was the So
viet Union. Each felt that the
United States and China must
band together to level the
strategic balance between
Russia and the rest of the world.
"The United States and China
have parallel interests," Fu
said; the Russians pose a world
threat. Zhon reiterated Fu's
statement, saying "the primary
thing (in foreign affairs) is the
threat of Soviet hegemony."
Zhon added that she
felt"Americans are not ap
preciative of how dangerous the
world is." In the Middle East,
Zhon said, "the Soviets are fish
ing in troubled waters." Partic
ularly in Afghanistan and Cam
bodia, Zhon said, "the Soviets
must be stopped."
"If we do nothing, they (the
Soviets) will go farther,"Zhon
said."All countries that do not
want to see the world dominated
by one country must join
forces."
Fu admonished the U.S. for
not paying heed to Chairman
Mao Ze Dong's 1972 statement
to then President Richard Nixon
which stated that all nations
should join together to form a
"chain of links" to "contain"
the Soviet threat. Zhon con
tended that "the U.S. is always
worried about how to not over
react." Wang added that
"words alone cannot stop the
Soviet Union."
So as not to give the im
pression that they advised a mil
itaristic "cold war" attack on
the Soviets, which they dis
missed as "jargon anyway," Fu
said:"l don't advocate over
reaction. The U.S. must do what
it deems appropriate for each
situation."
Regarding President Ronald
Reagan's new administration
and its stance toward the PRC,
Fu noted that "it is too early to
tell what the new adminis
tration will do." Fu added that it

seemed that the U.S. would
abide by the Shanghai com
munique which was "a good
thing" in his opinion.
It appeared that the scholars
want to promote cooperation be
tween the two countries for rea
sons other than just to counter
Soviet threats.
"We would like to see long
lasting friendship develop be
tween the U.S. and China,"Zhon
said.
"The Americans and the Chi
nese are both great people,"Fu
added. Fu also praised Ameri
cans for being "outspoken and
friendly," and for "turning a
wilderness into the strongest ec
onomic and military power in
just 200 years."
Turning to the educational
system in America, the four
scholars observed that Ameri
ca's system of higher education
is better developed than Chi
na's. The scholars agreed that
the great strengths of the Amer
ican educational system are its
"flexibility and breadth." They
also praised higher education
here for its "give and take."
"I am happy to see students
challenge their professors," Fu
said. It helps to stimulate fresh
ideas, he explained.
In China "professors might
think their students haughty if
they challenged them," Wang
noted. "China's educational
system is too rigid, teaching
methods and even textbooks are
unified by the state. . .China
needs to experiment more."
The scholars' praise for our
educational system was not un
qualified, however.
"Too much flexibility de
creases the quality of the educa
tional standard," Wang said.
''In general," Hua
added,"pre-university educa
tion here is not good, worse than
in China." He observed that this
was a bad omen for the future.
Fu also took university educa
tion in the U.S. to task on ac
count of its great expense, "es
pecially at elite institutions like
Stanford."
"High costs make an educa
tion here very difficult except
for the very rich,"Fu said.
He said that in China, univer
sity education and rent are free.
According to Fu, board costs $10
a month, a figure he compared
unfavorably to the price of a
haircut in the U.S.. The fact that
university education in China is
free, Fu said, is its great re

deeming quality.
In general, the scholars' reac
tions to America's system of
higher education and Stanford
was overwhelmingly positive.
Hua said that he has found Stan
ford students to be "hard work
ing. vivacious, intelligent and
friendly .* *
Zhon, on the other hand, has

found students here to be "well
rounded." She said that the Uni
versity is doing a good job in
turning out students who are
good not only in academics.
"Physical activities, social
activities and the arts help pro-
Rividonls w\t.Y\ better or
ganizing abilities (than if they

just studied)," Zhon said.
Zhon and Hua have also been
auditing undergraduate courses
as part of their study here. Zhon
said that she had attended His
tory Prof. Barton Bernstein's
course "America Since 1945."
"The course," she said, "gives
us » RoneruV thread of what V\as
happened here since 1945, things

we wanted to understand." She
praised Bernstein's course for
giving her "different views on
events since 1945." Zhon also
praised Political Science Profs.
Alexander George and Robert
Keohane for "informal advice"
and for giving her book lists th?t
were "very he\piu\." ProlOßaor
George is "very kind," she said.

There are over 100 scholars
from the People's Republic of
China (PRC) at Stanford. Last
'Thursday four of them met with
Daily reporter Richard Ross to
discuss their experiences at
Stanford, Sino-U.S. relations,
the U.S. educational systems
and life in California.
The four scholars, Fu Feng
gui of the State Planning Com
mission of the PRC, Hua I)i of
the Institute of Space Technol
ogy, Zhon Yan of the Chinese
People's Institute of Foreign Af
fairs, and Wang Yingjie of the
Peking Normal University are
members of the U.S.-China Re
lations frogram here at Stan
ford. Fu and Zhon are doing re
search on foreign policy issues.
Hua is involved in strategic sys
tems analysis. Wang is study
ing the U.S. educational sys
tem.
The four scholars say that
they are happy to be at Stanford.
Wang Yingjie said he chose
Stanford over other graduate in
stitutions in the U.S. because a
Columbia professor told him
that "Stanford has the best
school of education in the nation
and less crime than New York."
Wang also said the good weather
in California influenced his de
cision. His compatriot, Fu
Fenggui, suggested that Wang
had also heard about the quality
of California wine.
Zhon Yan commented that
many of her fellow nationals did
not come to Stanford just to
study.
"If we were interested only in
books we could have stayed in
China," Fu said."We have bene
fited from contact with Ameri
cans. It has been mutually bene
ficial."
The scholars said they are in
terested in being involved in
many aspects of campus life.
Hua Di mentioned that he lec
tured in the symposium on
Southeast Asian Security last
Tuesday. Fu said that he has at
tended "brown bag lunches"
and has found them very in
teresting.
"The academic atmosphere
is very good here," Fu said.
"People make very good use of
their time."
Hua has found that the pres
ence of Japanese scholars has
made his study here very valu
able. He said tripartite dis
cussions between Japanese,

Chinese, and American sholars
have been extremely useful. He
noted that the overall feeling be
tween the U. S., China and Japan
is "pretty good," adding that
"the fourth actor, the Soviet
Union, can't be reached." Fu
mentioned that Hua had been
trained in the USSR. Both Hua
and Fu referred to current an
tagonism between the two coun
tries.
In the arena of foreign af
fairs, in which all but Wang are
expert, the overriding concern
among the scholars was the So
viet Union. Each felt that the
United States and China must
band together to level the
strategic balance between
Russia and the rest of the world.
"The United States and China
have parallel interests," Fu
said; the Russians pose a world
threat. Zhon reiterated Fu's
statement, saying "the primary
thing (in foreign affairs) is the
threat of Soviet hegemony."
Zhon added that she
felt"Americans are not ap
preciative of how dangerous the
world is." In the Middle East,
Zhon said, "the Soviets are fish
ing in troubled waters." Partic
ularly in Afghanistan and Cam
bodia, Zhon said, "the Soviets
must be stopped."
"If we do nothing, they (the
Soviets) will go farther,"Zhon
said."All countries that do not
want to see the world dominated
by one country must join
forces."
Fu admonished the U.S. for
not paying heed to Chairman
Mao Ze Dong's 1972 statement
to then President Richard Nixon
which stated that all nations
should join together to form a
"chain of links" to "contain"
the Soviet threat. Zhon con
tended that "the U.S. is always
worried about how to not over
react." Wang added that
"words alone cannot stop the
Soviet Union."
So as not to give the im
pression that they advised a mil
itaristic "cold war" attack on
the Soviets, which they dis
missed as "jargon anyway," Fu
said:"l don't advocate over
reaction. The U.S. must do what
it deems appropriate for each
situation."
Regarding President Ronald
Reagan's new administration
and its stance toward the PRC,
Fu noted that "it is too early to
tell what the new adminis
tration will do." Fu added that it

seemed that the U.S. would
abide by the Shanghai com
munique which was "a good
thing" in his opinion.
It appeared that the scholars
want to promote cooperation be
tween the two countries for rea
sons other than just to counter
Soviet threats.
"We would like to see long
lasting friendship develop be
tween the U.S. and China,"Zhon
said.
"The Americans and the Chi
nese are both great people,"Fu
added. Fu also praised Ameri
cans for being "outspoken and
friendly," and for "turning a
wilderness into the strongest ec
onomic and military power in
just 200 years."
Turning to the educational
system in America, the four
scholars observed that Ameri
ca's system of higher education
is better developed than Chi
na's. The scholars agreed that
the great strengths of the Amer
ican educational system are its
"flexibility and breadth." They
also praised higher education
here for its "give and take."
"I am happy to see students
challenge their professors," Fu
said. It helps to stimulate fresh
ideas, he explained.
In China "professors might
think their students haughty if
they challenged them," Wang
noted. "China's educational
system is too rigid, teaching
methods and even textbooks are
unified by the state. . .China
needs to experiment more."
The scholars' praise for our
educational system was not un
qualified, however.
"Too much flexibility de
creases the quality of the educa
tional standard," Wang said.
''In general," Hua
added,"pre-university educa

was a bad omen for the future.

count of its great expense, "es

"High costs make an educa

unfavorably to the price of a

world is." In the Middle East,
Zhon said, "the Soviets are fish
ing in troubled waters." Partic
ularly in Afghanistan and Cam
bodia, Zhon said, "the Soviets
must be stopped."
"If we do nothing, they (the
Soviets) will go farther,"Zhon
said."All countries that do not
want to see the world dominated
by one country must join
forces."
Fu admonished the U.S. for
not paying heed to Chairman
Mao Ze Dong's 1972 statement
to then President Richard Nixon
which stated that all nations
should join together to form a
"chain of links" to "contain"
the Soviet threat. Zhon con
tended that "the U.S. is always
worried about how to not over
react." Wang added that
"words alone cannot stop the
Soviet Union."
So as not to give the im
pression that they advised a mil
itaristic "cold war" attack on
the Soviets, which they dis
missed as "jargon anyway," Fu
said:"l don't advocate over
reaction. The U.S. must do what
it deems appropriate for each
situation."
Regarding President Ronald
Reagan's new administration
and its stance toward the PRC,
Fu noted that "it is too early to
tell what the new adminis
tration will do." Fu added that it

seemed that the U.S. would
abide by the Shanghai com
munique which was "a good
thing" in his opinion.
It appeared that the scholars
want to promote cooperation be
tween the two countries for rea
sons other than just to counter
Soviet threats.
"We would like to see long
lasting friendship develop be
tween the U.S. and China,"Zhon
said.
"The Americans and the Chi
nese are both great people,"Fu
added. Fu also praised Ameri
cans for being "outspoken and
friendly," and for "turning a
wilderness into the strongest ec
onomic and military power in
just 200 years."
Turning to the educational
system in America, the four
scholars observed that Ameri
ca's system of higher education
is better developed than Chi
na's. The scholars agreed that
the great strengths of the Amer
ican educational system are its
"flexibility and breadth." They
also praised higher education
here for its "give and take."
"I am happy to see students
challenge their professors," Fu
said. It helps to stimulate fresh
ideas, he explained.
In China "professors might
think their students haughty if
they challenged them," Wang
noted. "China's educational
system is too rigid, teaching
methods and even textbooks are
unified by the state. . .China
needs to experiment more."
The scholars' praise for our
educational system was not un
qualified, however.
"Too much flexibility de
creases the quality of the educa
tional standard," Wang said.
''In general," Hua
added,"pre-university educa
tion here is not good, worse than
in China." He observed that this
was a bad omen for the future.
Fu also took university educa
tion in the U.S. to task on ac
count of its great expense, "es
pecially at elite institutions like
Stanford."
"High costs make an educa
tion here very difficult except
for the very rich,"Fu said.
He said that in China, univer
sity education and rent are free.
According to Fu, board costs $10
a month, a figure he compared
unfavorably to the price of a
haircut in the U.S.. The fact that
university education in China is
free, Fu said, is its great re

deeming quality.
In general, the scholars' reac
tions to America's system of
higher education and Stanford
was overwhelmingly positive.
Hua said that he has found Stan
ford students to be "hard work
ing. vivacious, intelligent and
friendly .* *
Zhon, on the other hand, has

found students here to be "well
rounded." She said that the Uni
versity is doing a good job in
turning out students who are
good not only in academics.
"Physical activities, social
activities and the arts help pro-
Rividonls w\t.Y\ better or
ganizing abilities (than if they

just studied)," Zhon said.
Zhon and Hua have also been
auditing undergraduate courses
as part of their study here. Zhon
said that she had attended His
tory Prof. Barton Bernstein's
course "America Since 1945."
"The course," she said, "gives
us » RoneruV thread of what V\as
happened here since 1945, things

we wanted to understand." She
praised Bernstein's course for
giving her "different views on
events since 1945." Zhon also
praised Political Science Profs.
Alexander George and Robert
Keohane for "informal advice"
and for giving her book lists th?t
were "very he\piu\." ProlOßaor
George is "very kind," she said.

There are over 100 scholars
from the People's Republic of
China (PRC) at Stanford. Last
'Thursday four of them met with
Daily reporter Richard Ross to
discuss their experiences at
Stanford, Sino-U.S. relations,
the U.S. educational systems
and life in California.
The four scholars, Fu Feng
gui of the State Planning Com
mission of the PRC, Hua I)i of
the Institute of Space Technol
ogy, Zhon Yan of the Chinese
People's Institute of Foreign Af
fairs, and Wang Yingjie of the
Peking Normal University are
members of the U.S.-China Re
lations frogram here at Stan
ford. Fu and Zhon are doing re
search on foreign policy issues.
Hua is involved in strategic sys
tems analysis. Wang is study
ing the U.S. educational sys
tem.
The four scholars say that
they are happy to be at Stanford.
Wang Yingjie said he chose
Stanford over other graduate in
stitutions in the U.S. because a
Columbia professor told him
that "Stanford has the best
school of education in the nation
and less crime than New York."
Wang also said the good weather
in California influenced his de
cision. His compatriot, Fu
Fenggui, suggested that Wang
had also heard about the quality
of California wine.
Zhon Yan commented that
many of her fellow nationals did
not come to Stanford just to
study.
"If we were interested only in
books we could have stayed in
China," Fu said."We have bene
fited from contact with Ameri
cans. It has been mutually bene
ficial."
The scholars said they are in
terested in being involved in
many aspects of campus life.
Hua Di mentioned that he lec
tured in the symposium on
Southeast Asian Security last
Tuesday. Fu said that he has at
tended "brown bag lunches"
and has found them very in
teresting.
"The academic atmosphere
is very good here," Fu said.
"People make very good use of
their time."
Hua has found that the pres
ence of Japanese scholars has
made his study here very valu
able. He said tripartite dis
cussions between Japanese,

Chinese, and American sholars
have been extremely useful. He
noted that the overall feeling be
tween the U. S., China and Japan
is "pretty good," adding that
"the fourth actor, the Soviet
Union, can't be reached." Fu
mentioned that Hua had been
trained in the USSR. Both Hua
and Fu referred to current an
tagonism between the two coun
tries.
In the arena of foreign af
fairs, in which all but Wang are
expert, the overriding concern
among the scholars was the So
viet Union. Each felt that the
United States and China must
band together to level the
strategic balance between
Russia and the rest of the world.
"The United States and China
have parallel interests," Fu
said; the Russians pose a world
threat. Zhon reiterated Fu's
statement, saying "the primary
thing (in foreign affairs) is the
threat of Soviet hegemony."
Zhon added that she
felt"Americans are not ap
preciative of how dangerous the
world is." In the Middle East,
Zhon said, "the Soviets are fish
ing in troubled waters." Partic
ularly in Afghanistan and Cam
bodia, Zhon said, "the Soviets
must be stopped."
"If we do nothing, they (the
Soviets) will go farther,"Zhon
said."All countries that do not
want to see the world dominated
by one country must join
forces."
Fu admonished the U.S. for
not paying heed to Chairman
Mao Ze Dong's 1972 statement
to then President Richard Nixon
which stated that all nations
should join together to form a
"chain of links" to "contain"
the Soviet threat. Zhon con
tended that "the U.S. is always

"words alone cannot stop the
Soviet Union."
So as not to give the im
pression that they advised a mil
itaristic "cold war" attack on
the Soviets, which they dis
missed as "jargon anyway," Fu
said:"l don't advocate over
reaction. The U.S. must do what
it deems appropriate for each
situation."

and its stance toward the PRC,
