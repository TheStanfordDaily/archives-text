# Sister Rose: gamble if you must
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Oakland, Calif. — When sen
ior citizens, fraternal organiza
tions, Masons and others in the
San Francisco Bay Area plan
trips to Nevada to gamble, they
often call on a Catholic nun for
help.
Sister Madeleine Rose Ashton
does not pray for them. She tells
them how to place their bets.
One of the most popular pro
fessors at Holy Names College
here. Sister Madeleine Rose —
or "Mad Rose" as her students
call her — is a math and proba
bility expert.
She received her Ph.D in
mathematics from Stanford
University. She has been a nun

for 50 years.
Holy Names College loans her
out on the local speaking circuit
as part of the school's policy to
share its resources with the
community. The sister's speech
is titled:
"How To Gamble — If You
Must."
"Know the game. Know the
odds. Know money man
agement," she suggests.
"The best game to play is
craps," says Sister Madeleine
Rose. "The house advantage is
only 51 percent to the player's 49
percent. In craps there are only
a certain number of good bets.
"Play the pass line and take
full odds. Or play come or don't

come. Don't play the field. It's a
bad bet. No one-roll bet is ever a
good bet."
Keno is the worst game for
gamblers; slot machines aren't
much better, she says.
"Of course it's wrong if
you're gambling your grocery
money. But gambling is old as
the hills.
"Dice were found in the pyra
mids. The Great Wall of China
and Columbia University were
built with lottery money."
Sister Madeleine Rose says
she is not a gambling nun.
"Math and probability are my
bag. That's the reason for my in
terest."
