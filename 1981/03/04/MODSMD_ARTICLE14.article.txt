## El Salvador Raymond Giraud Speak out against intervention 
### 
Next Monday a group of Uni
versity faculty will meet to
form a Committee for Con
cerned Faculty on Central
America, which we hope many
of our colleagues will join. It is
important for there to be a fac
ulty voice concerned with U.S.
intervention not only in El
Salvador, but in other areas of
the isthmus where political de
velopments have taken a simi
lar course. It is imperative that
faculty inform themselves on
this issue and participate with
students and community groups
in mobilizing public opinion
against U.S. military interven
tion throughout the Caribbean
area.
Public attention is now —
rightly — concentrated on
events in El Salvador, given the
accelerated flow of weapons
and military advisers to the rul
ing junta and the growing re
semblance of our country's role
in civil conflict there to our ill
fated attempt to control the des
tiny of the Vietnamese people.
Despite the government's de
nial of plans to send American
troops, President Jimmy Carter
set up a Caribbean Rapid
Deployment Task Force in Key
West, and his adviser,
Zbigniew Brzezinski, had
threatened (to prevent "a new
Nicaragua"): "If all else fails,
we'll send in the Marines." Can
we expect less of President Rea
gan and General Haig if all else
does indeed fail and American
weapons and advisers prove in
adequate to maintain the junta
in power in the face of increas
ingly wide-spread popular op
position?
But the threat of U.S. in
tervention is not limited to El
Salvador. There has clearly
been considerable resentment
in Washington over the suc
cessful Nicaraguan revolution
and the ousting of the brutal and
corrupt Somoza regime, as well
as apprehension over the future
of General Fernando Romeo
Lucas Garcia's regime in
Guatemala, where over 20,000
people are estimated to have

been killed in the last decade,
most of them by rightist death
squads. Honduras, too. ruled by
a military junta and, like
Guatemala, sharing a common
frontier with El Salvador, is
part of a regional situation in
which the same pattern of vast
inequalities of wealth, cruel ex
ploitation of the poor, intimida
tion and armed violence recurs
with appalling regularity.
In any case, informed dis
cussion of a kind that seldom
reaches the daily press and tele
vision must take place: the
facts and history of the situation
and the question of whether it is
really in the interest of the peo
ple of this country to contribute
to the defeat of movements for
economic justice and de
mocracy in Central America.
Although it would be ignoble
to declare solidarity only with
"one's own kind." we might re
member that, in addition to the
many thousands of peasants and
workers tortured and killed in
Central America in recent
years, a significant nu.nber of
university people (as well as
journalists and other intellec
tuals) have also met with vi
olent treatment.
In 1980. Salvadorean police
beat officials of the National
University, bayoneted students
and raped dozens of co-eds.
TTiey also smashed offices,
classrooms, laboratories and
even blackboards. Since then. 40
professors, 78 school teachers
and hundreds of students have
been killed. The rector of the
University has also been killed,
the University closed and its
governing board arrested. The
fact that the political and mili
tary leaders our government
supports, arms, and legitimizes
have such fear and hatred for
the centers of learning and en
lightenment in their country is
troubling.
Surely a great university like
Stanford should not be per
ceived uniquely as the Y\ome
base for the ideologues from the

Hoover Institution who are now
establishing public policy in
Washington. It is essential for
many voices from among the
University faculty (and its stu
dents and staff as well) to
articulate publicly their support
for popular self-determination
in Central America and their op
position to U.S. intervention in
the affairs of other peoples.
