## U.S. engaged in self-fulfilling prophecy 
### 
The U.S. should not expect El
Salvador to become "another
Vietnam." The Reagan admin
istration won't have to send a
half a million U.S. soldiers to
subdue a nation of only four mil
lion people, and opposition
within the United States is not
likely to reach the intensity of
anti-Vietnam War protests.
Nevertheless, the same blind
and self-defeating policies that
led us to war in Vietnam are now
determining our approach to El
Salvador. Once more the U.S.
government engaged in a self
fulfilling prophecy — we are
creating our own enemy.
In 1945 Ho Chi Minh, com
munist leader of the Vietnam
ese nationalists who had pro
vided support for the U.S
against Japan in World War 11,
wrote repeatedly to President
Truman asking for recognition
of an independent Vietnam. No
one answered his letters. Five
years later we justified our sup
port of continued French rule in
Indochina on grounds that Ho
was a puppet of the Chinese and
the Soviet Union.
.ifter the war ended in 1975,
and with their country in ruins,
the Vietnamese made repeated
efforts to establish normal rela
tions vvith the United States in
an attempt to avoid dependence
on the Russians. Again we re
fused. and U.S. officials now
point to Vietnam as an area of
Soviet "penetration" that justi
fies increased military spend
ing.
In a similar process, during
the early 1970s we supported
Portuguese colonialists in their
last stand against Angolan inde
pendence, sponsored covert CIA
operations against Angolans,
and backed the invasion by
South Africa that compelled the
new Angolan government to call
for the help of Cuban troops.
Angola insists the Cubans will
leave whenever South Africa
stops its continuing raids. The
government has fervently
sought U.S. recognition and in
vestment. But we have refused
Angola's overtures and continue
to point to the presence of Cuban
troops (which guard Gulf Oil in
stallations) as evidence of Com
munist aggression.
Having virtually forced Viet
nam and Angola to become de

pendent on the Communist bloc,
we are reenacting this process
in El Salvador. The Reagan ad
ministration is making a
strenuous effort, at home and
abroad, to portray the situation
in El Salvador as a struggle be
tween communists and centrist
reformers. But Archbishop
Romero, who strongly opposed
U.S. aid for the ruling junta, was
not a communist. Nor were the
three American nuns and other
church leaders who have been
assassinated, or the six opposi
tion leaders who were kid
napped, tortured, and murdered
last December, or the scores of
teachers and thousands of
peasants, whose brutal deaths
have all been linked to govern
ment troops.
In a country where 14 families
own most of the wealth and a
third of the children suffer from
severe malnutrition, it doesn't
take outside manipulation to
cause rebellion. Undoubtedly
the Salvadorean rebels will wel
come aid from wherever they
can get it, and undoubtedly Cuba
and the U.S.S R. will gladly pro
vide it. So once again the world
will witness a lineup of Com
munist nations supporting a
movement that represents the
poor and oppressed, while we
arm their oppressors.
The U.S. has repeatedly
turned down opportunities to en
courage moderate forces in El
Salvador at the expense of the
far right. The State Department
recently refused a request by
Guillermo Ungo, leader of the
Social Democrats, to help nego
tiate a compromise political
settlement in order to avoid
further bloodshed. Instead we
will send more arms to the jun
ta While Ungo is being ignored
it is interesting to recall that
last summer several of Presi
dent Reagan's Congressional
supporters arranged a secret
visit to Washington by Maj.
Robert D'Aubuisson, head of the
right-wing Broad National
Front in El Salvador and a re
puted terrorist.
We may "win" in El
Salvador, as we did in
Guatemala in 1954. in the Do
minican Republic in 1965, and in
Chile in 1973 In that case a mi

nority will continue to enjoy
vast privileges while millions go
hungry. Smouldering discontent
will breed terrorism, which the
government will have to sup
press. and the United States will
have yet another ally that must
rely on torture and assassina
tion in order to rule.
On the other hand, if we force
the rebels to depend on Cuban
and Soviet support, and if they

win a drawn-out struggle that
destroys the moderate oppo
nents of the junta, we will have
suffered another "loss" to the
Communist bloc. Whatever the
outcome, our policy of siding
with a hated regime that
slaughters its own poor will
have proved to be both immoral
and self-defeating.

leave whenever South Africa
stops its continuing raids. The
government has fervently
sought U.S. recognition and in
vestment. But we have refused
Angola's overtures and continue
to point to the presence of Cuban
troops (which guard Gulf Oil in
stallations) as evidence of Com
munist aggression.
Having virtually forced Viet
nam and Angola to become de

pendent on the Communist bloc,
we are reenacting this process
in El Salvador. The Reagan ad
ministration is making a
strenuous effort, at home and
abroad, to portray the situation
in El Salvador as a struggle be
tween communists and centrist
reformers. But Archbishop
Romero, who strongly opposed
U.S. aid for the ruling junta, was
not a communist. Nor were the
three American nuns and other
church leaders who have been
assassinated, or the six opposi
tion leaders who were kid
napped, tortured, and murdered
last December, or the scores of
teachers and thousands of
peasants, whose brutal deaths
have all been linked to govern
ment troops.
In a country where 14 families
own most of the wealth and a
third of the children suffer from
severe malnutrition, it doesn't
take outside manipulation to
cause rebellion. Undoubtedly
the Salvadorean rebels will wel
come aid from wherever they
can get it, and undoubtedly Cuba
and the U.S.S R. will gladly pro
vide it. So once again the world
will witness a lineup of Com
munist nations supporting a
movement that represents the
poor and oppressed, while we
arm their oppressors.
The U.S. has repeatedly
turned down opportunities to en
courage moderate forces in El
Salvador at the expense of the
far right. The State Department
recently refused a request by
Guillermo Ungo, leader of the
Social Democrats, to help nego
tiate a compromise political
settlement in order to avoid
further bloodshed. Instead we
will send more arms to the jun
ta While Ungo is being ignored
it is interesting to recall that
last summer several of Presi
dent Reagan's Congressional
supporters arranged a secret
visit to Washington by Maj.
Robert D'Aubuisson, head of the
right-wing Broad National
Front in El Salvador and a re
puted terrorist.
We may "win" in El
Salvador, as we did in
Guatemala in 1954. in the Do
minican Republic in 1965, and in
Chile in 1973 In that case a mi

nority will continue to enjoy
vast privileges while millions go
hungry. Smouldering discontent
will breed terrorism, which the
government will have to sup
press. and the United States will
have yet another ally that must
rely on torture and assassina
tion in order to rule.
On the other hand, if we force
the rebels to depend on Cuban
and Soviet support, and if they

win a drawn-out struggle that
destroys the moderate oppo
nents of the junta, we will have
suffered another "loss" to the
Communist bloc. Whatever the
outcome, our policy of siding
with a hated regime that
slaughters its own poor will
have proved to be both immoral
and self-defeating.

The U.S. should not expect El
Salvador to become "another
Vietnam." The Reagan admin
istration won't have to send a
half a million U.S. soldiers to
subdue a nation of only four mil
lion people, and opposition
within the United States is not
likely to reach the intensity of
anti-Vietnam War protests.
Nevertheless, the same blind
and self-defeating policies that
led us to war in Vietnam are now
determining our approach to El
Salvador. Once more the U.S.
government engaged in a self
fulfilling prophecy — we are
creating our own enemy.
In 1945 Ho Chi Minh, com
munist leader of the Vietnam
ese nationalists who had pro
vided support for the U.S
against Japan in World War 11,
wrote repeatedly to President
Truman asking for recognition
of an independent Vietnam. No
one answered his letters. Five
years later we justified our sup
port of continued French rule in
Indochina on grounds that Ho
was a puppet of the Chinese and
the Soviet Union.
.ifter the war ended in 1975,
and with their country in ruins,
the Vietnamese made repeated
efforts to establish normal rela
tions vvith the United States in
an attempt to avoid dependence
on the Russians. Again we re
fused. and U.S. officials now
point to Vietnam as an area of
Soviet "penetration" that justi
fies increased military spend
ing.
In a similar process, during
the early 1970s we supported
Portuguese colonialists in their
last stand against Angolan inde
pendence, sponsored covert CIA
operations against Angolans,
and backed the invasion by
South Africa that compelled the
new Angolan government to call
for the help of Cuban troops.
