## Implications of wealth ignored 
### 
It has been a sad, but probably predictable fact
that much of the news coverage and the debate of
the El Salvadorean issue has been conducted in
terms of the validity of the use of U.S. citizens'
wealth for the purpose of exerting power over the
citizens of foreign countries.
The State Department claims the U.S. support
for the unpopular dictatorship's stand against
popular/socialist/communist opposition is a valid
expression of power, whilst other nations and dis
senting individuals at home decry such usage of
power, as is expressed in the statement of Mexi
co's president that it is neither "reasonable nor
natural" for powerful outsiders "to fight over our
conflicts as though they were the owners."
The fundamental dualism is seen as the ex
pression of self-interests by using domestic
wealth as an economic and political tool vis-a-vis
a policy in which non-intervention is espoused.
The ownership of wealth should not be seen in
terms solely of a means of economic and political
power but also as a responsibility to its "owners."
Cannot the decision to provide aid or to withdraw
aid also be seen as positions implying our respon
siblity for the continuation or probable downfall
of the dictatorship?
When we take these factors into account the
present debate should take into account both the
domestic benefits of using wealth as an economic
tool and the attendant responsiblities of these ac
tions. Such an approach would encourage news
coverage not of the decline in European relations
as a result of intervention, but of the living stan
dards of a representative El Salvadorean peasant
under the present conditions and his hopes, if any,
for the future.
On reflection two factors, geographical and so
cial separation. and the rise of the laissez-faire ec
onomic system over the last two centuries in the
West, seem to be partly responsible for this fail
ure to bear the moral consequences of wealth. On
the one hand El Salvador, like most Third World
nations, is sufficiently removed from our daily
lives that we identify little with their struggles â€”
those who have seen either "El Salvador: Another
Vietnam?" or "Revolution or Death" will recall
the horror of the situation portrayed, yet even this

shock is soon smoothed away in the middle-class
day-to-day life we lead here at Stanford.
The other factor mentioned is the market sys
tem, which many would claim has placed a veil
over transactions which may yield "mutual bene
fit" and lead to a "pareto superior outcome," but
which seen in their essence would be morally
abhorrent. Is it any coincidence that the nine
teenth century, during which fortunes were held
by more than an elite few. when locational mobili
ty was still low and hence social ties strong, and
when the moral burden of wealth still weighed
heavy, that private philanthropy was most com -
mon?
To take the view that our foreign policy de
cisions are to be inevitably determined on a calcu
lus of power would be overly pessimistic though.
Those who feel such fatalism ebbing in can reflect
on the fact that the U.S. is losing the lack of op
position necessary for its domination of Latin
American politics: as it becomes dependent upon
Mexican goodwill and upon other dissenting Eu
ropean allies who have experienced the economic
system from its shabbier side, it may have to de
fer to some of their views on the positive benefits
from a more socially responsible use of wealth.
Secondly, the U.S. political system does not in
fact respond on a one-for-one basis, but responds
directly to its contacts with vociferous dissident
citizens and to the media coverage their energies
attract. This combined with the natural fact that
those with any knowledge of the actual situation
are more motivated towards redirecting our for
eign policy provides some hope.
In a practical way then we should bear the re
sponsiblity of our current world position and not
allow excessive power seeking and the following
withdrawal and guilt which seemed to follow the
previous debacle in Vietnam. The essence for now
and the future is to express our feelings to our
Congressional representatives, the press, and
anyone else who will listen, and to encourge any
developments, on or off campus, aimed at a
broader, more humane direction for our foreign
policy towards those less well placed in the sys
tem.
