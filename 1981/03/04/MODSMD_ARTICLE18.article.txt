## Superpowers confront amidst internal strife 
### 
Recent events in El Salvador
and Washington have demon
strated that there remains a
profound uncertainty in the
United States about the proper
exercise of American power and
the maintenance of that power
in the face of Soviet challenges.
From the American standpoint,
the conflict in El Salvador is a
superpower confrontation laid
over a domestic class conflict.
Questions include: How did the
United States become involved
in the conflict? What is the sta
tus of the conflict now? What set
of policy actions is most in ac
cord with U.S. interests in El
Salvador?
During the Carter presiden
cy, U.S. concerns in El Salvador
revolved around quiet inquiries
into reported human rights vio
lations by the military govern
ment we supported with aid and
weapons. Upon the discovery,
late in 1980, of the murders of
four American nuns, the issue of
continued aid to the military
junta was brought to public at
tention and the Carter Adminis
tration took action it should
have taken a lot sooner: a ban on
weapons shipments to the junta.
The United States has sup
ported the junta since shortly

after it rose to power late in
1979. even in light of extreme hu
man rights violations. Since the
beginning of 1980, more than
13.000 people have been killed by
either government "security"
forces or by paramilitary
groups closely connected to the
government, acording to the El
Salvador Human Rights Com
mission. (The Commission is a
private organization and is typi
cal of the human rights monitor
ing groups which have
flourished throughout the world
as a result of the Carter admin
istration's human rights em
phasis. )
Why would the U.S. support a
human-rights-violating mili
tary junta in El Salvador?
Though human rights was un
arguably a valuable part of the
Carter administration's foreign
policy program, if only for its
impact on the environment of
international affairs, one would
be deceiving oneself to believe
that by 1980, human rights
played a large role in the policy
determination process on what
was then the low-importance is
sue area of El Salvador.
U.S. interests in El Salvador
lie in stability. There is a domi
no theory mentality at work

here. Political instability and
especially leftist political in
stability spreads easily in Latin
America, the traditional argu
ment goes. We could soon have
the whole continent "south of
the border" so hot that it would
be sending up smoke signals
telling the Soviets where to
land. Regardless of whether or
not one accepts this con
spiratorial view of Soviet-sup
ported insurrection, it is clear
that even one more Soviet-sup
ported government so close to
home (in addition to Cuba) is
contrary to basic American in
terest.
In traditional State Depart
ment thinking on Latin Ameri
ca, stability in government
means moderation in politics.
Consistent with our interests,
given the foregoing presupposi
tions about stability and the na
ture of the Soviet threat, the
junta is politically moderate,
appearing in policy papers to fa
vor a degree of land reform and
income redistribution which
class tensions seem to call for.
The road to political stability
is not paved with murder. Put
another way, governments do
not establish political legit
imacy by killing their oppo
nents.
Through their imprudent ex
ercise of military force, the gov
ernment of El Salvador has lost
any hope of governing the small
nation in stability. Through our
imprudent aid to the military
government, the U S. has en
couraged the rebels to seek So
viet aid and is thereby respon
sible for the internationaliza
tion of the El Salvador Civil
War.
The introduction of Soviet
military support has profoundly
changed the nature of the con
flict. I accept the Reagan ad
ministration's contention that
the Soviets are supplying arms
to the revolutionaries. Fabri

eating such charges for a rela
tively minor foreign policy gain
barely a month into his presi
dency is a risk I do not think
Ronald Reagan would allow,
though Alexander Haig's past
record on veracity makes me
question that assumption. In ad
dition, Soviet aid to groups like
the FMLN and the FDR is not at
all out of character with recent
Soviet adventurism. In any
case, the conflict has been
raised to the level of the super
powers and those peasants who

were formerly fighting for their
acre of land are now sadly in
consequential, except insofar as
they decide to pick up a rifle
marked with either some stars
and some stripes or a hammer
and a sickle.
At this point, we must realize
that our interest in stability
does not exclude, and in fact ne
cessitates a government of the
left. It is the leftists in this con
flict whose ideals are parallel to
our own. Any hope which we
ever entertained that the junta
could produce stability has been
dashed.
We should recognize that sta
bility will require the support of
the left with its land reforms
and more equitable income dis
tribution. Given time, this ma
jority, as most majorities, will
succeed in seeing their demands
fulfilled, regardless of to whom
we offer our support.
We are now at an important
juncture in the struggle of the
Salvadorean majority. From
the statements made by several
leaders of the revolutionary
movement and reported in
American newspapers, it seems
that they are willing to nego
tiate, and are even eager to ac
cept the U.S. as mediator. Most
important, the rebels have not
reached that point so often

reached in similar conflicts in
the past, at which they see the
Soviets as their ticket to success
and the Americans as im
perialistic war-mongers.
The United States ought to
take this opportunity to learn to
use a different facet of its power
than strictly the military â€” the
integrity and sheer intellectual
power of the ideals we stand
for: liberty, democracy and
equality. The rebels who are
fighting in El Salvador are fight
ing for the same things we be-

lieve in. In asking the United
States to mediate negotiations,
the people of El Salvador are
finding appeal in the strength of
our principles. They are asking
for peaceful intervention by the
United States.
The lesson this country
learned from Vietnam was in
complete. We came away from
the war believing that power
and idealism cannot always be
combined to forge the creation
of an ideal. But sometimes they
can. Through careful nego
tiation, Reagan can be the
architect of a new international
conception of U.S. power, a syn
thesis of power and idealism.
In El Salvador, that means
accepting the overtures to me
diate which are being offered by
the rebels who speak for the ma
jority. It is this majority who
are clearly in the right in El
Salvador and experience has
shown that in the long run, they
will win their war. If we accept
their offer to mediate, we will
be siding with the moral and
winning side. If one believes the
opinion polls and news commen
tators, that is what the Ameri
can people elected Reagan to
do.

Why would the U.S. support a
human-rights-violating mili
tary junta in El Salvador?
Though human rights was un
arguably a valuable part of the
Carter administration's foreign
policy program, if only for its
impact on the environment of
international affairs, one would
be deceiving oneself to believe
that by 1980, human rights
played a large role in the policy
determination process on what
was then the low-importance is
sue area of El Salvador.
U.S. interests in El Salvador
lie in stability. There is a domi
no theory mentality at work

here. Political instability and
especially leftist political in
stability spreads easily in Latin
America, the traditional argu
ment goes. We could soon have
the whole continent "south of
the border" so hot that it would
be sending up smoke signals
telling the Soviets where to
land. Regardless of whether or
not one accepts this con
spiratorial view of Soviet-sup
ported insurrection, it is clear
that even one more Soviet-sup
ported government so close to
home (in addition to Cuba) is
contrary to basic American in
terest.
In traditional State Depart
ment thinking on Latin Ameri
ca, stability in government
means moderation in politics.
Consistent with our interests,
given the foregoing presupposi
tions about stability and the na
ture of the Soviet threat, the
junta is politically moderate,
appearing in policy papers to fa
vor a degree of land reform and
income redistribution which
class tensions seem to call for.
The road to political stability
is not paved with murder. Put
another way, governments do
not establish political legit
imacy by killing their oppo
nents.
Through their imprudent ex
ercise of military force, the gov
ernment of El Salvador has lost
any hope of governing the small
nation in stability. Through our
imprudent aid to the military
government, the U S. has en
couraged the rebels to seek So
viet aid and is thereby respon
sible for the internationaliza
tion of the El Salvador Civil
War.
The introduction of Soviet
military support has profoundly
changed the nature of the con
flict. I accept the Reagan ad
ministration's contention that
the Soviets are supplying arms
to the revolutionaries. Fabri

eating such charges for a rela

Ronald Reagan would allow,
though Alexander Haig's past
record on veracity makes me
question that assumption. In ad
dition, Soviet aid to groups like
the FMLN and the FDR is not at
all out of character with recent
Soviet adventurism. In any
case, the conflict has been
raised to the level of the super
powers and those peasants who

acre of land are now sadly in
consequential, except insofar as
they decide to pick up a rifle
marked with either some stars
and some stripes or a hammer
and a sickle.
At this point, we must realize
that our interest in stability
does not exclude, and in fact ne
cessitates a government of the
left. It is the leftists in this con
flict whose ideals are parallel to
our own. Any hope which we
ever entertained that the junta
could produce stability has been
dashed.
We should recognize that sta
bility will require the support of
the left with its land reforms
and more equitable income dis
tribution. Given time, this ma
jority, as most majorities, will
succeed in seeing their demands
fulfilled, regardless of to whom
we offer our support.
We are now at an important
juncture in the struggle of the
Salvadorean majority. From
the statements made by several
leaders of the revolutionary
movement and reported in
American newspapers, it seems
that they are willing to nego
tiate, and are even eager to ac
cept the U.S. as mediator. Most
important, the rebels have not
reached that point so often

reached in similar conflicts in
the past, at which they see the
Soviets as their ticket to success
and the Americans as im
perialistic war-mongers.
The United States ought to
take this opportunity to learn to
use a different facet of its power
than strictly the military â€” the
integrity and sheer intellectual
power of the ideals we stand
for: liberty, democracy and
equality. The rebels who are
fighting in El Salvador are fight
ing for the same things we be-

lieve in. In asking the United
States to mediate negotiations,
the people of El Salvador are
finding appeal in the strength of
our principles. They are asking
for peaceful intervention by the
United States.
The lesson this country
learned from Vietnam was in
complete. We came away from
the war believing that power
and idealism cannot always be
combined to forge the creation
of an ideal. But sometimes they
can. Through careful nego
tiation, Reagan can be the
architect of a new international
conception of U.S. power, a syn
thesis of power and idealism.
In El Salvador, that means
accepting the overtures to me
diate which are being offered by
the rebels who speak for the ma
jority. It is this majority who
are clearly in the right in El
Salvador and experience has
shown that in the long run, they
will win their war. If we accept
their offer to mediate, we will
be siding with the moral and
winning side. If one believes the
opinion polls and news commen
tators, that is what the Ameri
can people elected Reagan to
do.

Recent events in El Salvador
and Washington have demon
strated that there remains a
profound uncertainty in the
United States about the proper
exercise of American power and
the maintenance of that power
in the face of Soviet challenges.
From the American standpoint,
the conflict in El Salvador is a
superpower confrontation laid
over a domestic class conflict.
Questions include: How did the
United States become involved
in the conflict? What is the sta
tus of the conflict now? What set
of policy actions is most in ac
cord with U.S. interests in El
Salvador?
During the Carter presiden
cy, U.S. concerns in El Salvador
revolved around quiet inquiries
into reported human rights vio
lations by the military govern
ment we supported with aid and
weapons. Upon the discovery,
late in 1980, of the murders of
four American nuns, the issue of
continued aid to the military
junta was brought to public at
tention and the Carter Adminis
tration took action it should
have taken a lot sooner: a ban on
weapons shipments to the junta.
The United States has sup
ported the junta since shortly

after it rose to power late in
1979. even in light of extreme hu
man rights violations. Since the
beginning of 1980, more than
13.000 people have been killed by
either government "security"
forces or by paramilitary
groups closely connected to the
government, acording to the El

ture of the Soviet threat, the
junta is politically moderate,
appearing in policy papers to fa
vor a degree of land reform and
income redistribution which
class tensions seem to call for.
The road to political stability
is not paved with murder. Put
another way, governments do
not establish political legit
imacy by killing their oppo
nents.
Through their imprudent ex
ercise of military force, the gov
ernment of El Salvador has lost
any hope of governing the small
nation in stability. Through our
imprudent aid to the military
government, the U S. has en
couraged the rebels to seek So
viet aid and is thereby respon
sible for the internationaliza
tion of the El Salvador Civil
War.
The introduction of Soviet
military support has profoundly
changed the nature of the con
flict. I accept the Reagan ad
ministration's contention that
the Soviets are supplying arms
to the revolutionaries. Fabri

eating such charges for a rela
tively minor foreign policy gain
barely a month into his presi

Ronald Reagan would allow,
though Alexander Haig's past
record on veracity makes me
question that assumption. In ad
dition, Soviet aid to groups like
the FMLN and the FDR is not at
all out of character with recent
Soviet adventurism. In any
case, the conflict has been
raised to the level of the super
powers and those peasants who

were formerly fighting for their
acre of land are now sadly in
consequential, except insofar as
they decide to pick up a rifle
marked with either some stars
and some stripes or a hammer
and a sickle.
At this point, we must realize
that our interest in stability
does not exclude, and in fact ne
cessitates a government of the
left. It is the leftists in this con
flict whose ideals are parallel to
our own. Any hope which we
ever entertained that the junta
could produce stability has been
dashed.
We should recognize that sta
bility will require the support of
the left with its land reforms
and more equitable income dis
tribution. Given time, this ma
jority, as most majorities, will
succeed in seeing their demands
fulfilled, regardless of to whom
we offer our support.
We are now at an important
juncture in the struggle of the
Salvadorean majority. From
the statements made by several
leaders of the revolutionary
movement and reported in
American newspapers, it seems
that they are willing to nego
tiate, and are even eager to ac
cept the U.S. as mediator. Most
important, the rebels have not
reached that point so often

reached in similar conflicts in
the past, at which they see the
Soviets as their ticket to success
and the Americans as im
perialistic war-mongers.
The United States ought to
take this opportunity to learn to
use a different facet of its power
than strictly the military â€” the
integrity and sheer intellectual
power of the ideals we stand
for: liberty, democracy and
equality. The rebels who are
fighting in El Salvador are fight
ing for the same things we be-

lieve in. In asking the United
States to mediate negotiations,
the people of El Salvador are
finding appeal in the strength of
our principles. They are asking
for peaceful intervention by the
United States.
The lesson this country
learned from Vietnam was in
complete. We came away from
the war believing that power
and idealism cannot always be
combined to forge the creation
of an ideal. But sometimes they
can. Through careful nego
tiation, Reagan can be the
architect of a new international
conception of U.S. power, a syn
thesis of power and idealism.
In El Salvador, that means
accepting the overtures to me
diate which are being offered by
the rebels who speak for the ma
jority. It is this majority who
are clearly in the right in El
Salvador and experience has
shown that in the long run, they
will win their war. If we accept
their offer to mediate, we will
be siding with the moral and
winning side. If one believes the
opinion polls and news commen
tators, that is what the Ameri
can people elected Reagan to
do.
