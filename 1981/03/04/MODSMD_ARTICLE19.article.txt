Union salaries
The decision of whether or not
the University's clerical staff
should unionize is a complex is
sue involving many precon
ceived notions and intangible
considerations. However, the
observation that the issue is in
flammatory and complex does
not change the fact that one
must still attempt to make a ra
tional decision about it. To this
end the following suggestion,
replete with caveats, if offered.
It can not be assumed that
non-monetary grievances are
mitigated at the same rate as
salary is increased. Nor can it
be assumed that these concerns
are secondary to one's salary
level. Nonetheless, salary in
creases are, for most people, an
important consideration. For
tunately, it also happens to be
one which can be alalyzed fairly
objectively.
I suggest that the Daily print
a comparison of Stanford's
unionized and non-unionized
(e.g. clerical) employees by
plotting their rates of salary in
crease over time. Another in
teresting, though more con
troversial, comparison would
involve adjusting the entry level
salary of Stanford's union em
ployees by subtracting union
dues and then contrast it with
entry level salaries for Stan
ford's clerical personnel.
I am certain that if this is

done the paper will be com
mended by Donald Kennedy for
helping "provide accurate in
formation." In addition, it
would be in the best tradition of
a University which is dedicated
to enhancing the process of
learning (i.e. the ability to use
past experience to profit in the
future).

It appears from the recent
article (Daily, Feb. 13) that
Margaret Crosby like many oth
ers who support "pro-choice" in
the abortion issue has missed
the issue.
The issue is not whether or
not a woman has the right to
chose to terminate a pregnancy
or not. The issue is one of the
rights of the unborn.
Those of us who opposed to
abortion are not against it be
cause we feel that women
should suffer, or have their
rights trampled upon, but rath
er because we are concerned
about the right of the defense
less, un-born human being who
is murdered. That is the sub
stance of the real issue.
