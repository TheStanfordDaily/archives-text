# LOTS seeks solutions to system overload
## 
### Debbie Walker 
Student and faculty complaints
about the inadequacies of the LOTS
campus computer facility are intensi
fying because coursework is being de
layed and two-hour waits for termi
nals and system "crashes" when the
computer is overloaded are becoming
common place.
LOTS, or the Low Overhead Time
Sharing system, has gone through a
series of ups and downs marked by
technical upgrades and overloads, ac
cording to LOTS director Ralph Gorin.
Technical improvements of the
computer in the past have been fol
lowed by a slow growth in use which
eventually builds to the point where a
new improvement is needed. Gorin
said. In the past, more terminals have
been added and the system's memory
expanded, he said. Following these
improvements, user demands were
temporarily satisfied, and then de
mand began building again, Gorin
said.
The situation this quarter is unique
from those overloaded periods in the
past because the previous inade
quacies of the system could be reme
died by expanding the computer's
capabilities or size, he said.
"Now we have LOTS at full capaci
ty," Gorin said. "You could say we
have the gas pedal pushed all the way
to the floor on this system."
The LOTS computer, a Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC) 2060,
has been overloaded this quarter by an
unusually high user population, Gorin
said. Since 1977 more departments
have included work at the facility as
part of their coursework, he said.
LOTS was established to provide
computing facilities for teaching, un
sponsored research, faculty and stu
dents, with an emphasis on teaching.

The system is supported by specially
allocated general funds.
"Right now, academic requests for
computer time are automatically
granted," Gorin said.
"We are unwilling to review re
quests and try to decide who is most
deserving of computer access. If a
course is worthwhile enough to pay the
instructor to teach the course, it is
presumed valid to give the class ac
cess to the computer," he said.
Contributing to the increased de
mand this quarter is the fact that in
troductory computer science courses
previously limited to a class size of 360
were enlarged to accommodate 420
students
Computer Prof Donni«
Brown said this was probably a mis
take. He said the department was un
der a lot of pressure from students and
advisors at the beginning of the quar
ter to admit more students.
"We felt maybe it would be better
not to be so conservative and let the
students in," Brown said.
"A 10 percent growth in the size of
the classes does not seem that large.
But on the other hand, it is a big deal
when you're waiting for a terminal,"
Brown added.
Brown said that a FORTRAN com
puter language class, which no one
had ever had to worry about limiting
before, suddenly attracted an un
precedented 200 students.
The increase in the number of stu
dents using LOTS also resulted from
the decision to prohibit computer stu
dents from doing coursework on the
SCORE computer system in the com
puter science department building.
Prof. Jeffrey Ullman. chairman of
the computer science department, ex
plained that the SCORE system is
funded heavily by the government and

is supposed to be used for research.
"Toward the end of last quarter, we
estimate that one-fifth of the work
being done on SCORE was for
coursework," Ullman said
Ullman said that there was also an
ethical question involved because not
all students had access to SCORE.
"We feel that everyone or no one
should be able to use SCORE for
coursework, because the students us
ing SCORE were able to get work done
more quickly than students forced to
use LOTS and thus were at a substan
tial advantage," Ullman said. "It is
definitely against University policy to
allow this inequality of service," he
said.

To alleviate the load on LOTS, both
Ullman and Brown said they have
asked other professors to "go light"
on final exam projects. Ullman has
asked professors in the beginning
computer science courses to give stu
dents one week off.
Brown said he is investigating alter
native teaching methods such as video
instruction, which would allow stu

dents to take a self-paced computer in
troductory course.
"Of course all of this is very em
bryonic," Brown said.
"This mode of instruction has
proven very effective, and the student
would still maintain individual con
tact with teaching assistants," he
added
"The obvious next step seems to be
to purchase another computer identi
cal to the DEC 2060, but this is a bad
time in the lifetime of the product to
buy another*" Gorin said.
"We can see the writing on the wall,
and a newer, better system, a DEC
2080, will be out in about two years,"
he said.
system, the University is hesitant to
plow funds into an inferior machine,
Gorin said.
"The administration is in tune with
the idea that something needs to be
done about LOTS — it is nobody's plan
to keep students up until 4 a.m. doing
homework — but we are just trying to
figure out how University money can
be best spent," Gorin said.
The University may decide it is nec
essary to buy a new machine im-
mediately, but the possibility of other
University resources being used to re
duce the load on LOTS is now being in
vestigated, Gorin said.
Stanford has decided to install some
new terminals, but this is not a solu
tion to the problem, according to
Gorin.
He said that CIT. which provides
computing services on campus for a
price, is already heavily used during
the day, but it might be possible to
purchase time at night which students
could use.
"CIT is also planning to purchase a
new machine which is very similar to
the LOTS system," Gorin said. "Per
haps LOTS can buy some block time on
this new machine."
There are other computer systems

on campus that may be able to accom
modate part of LOTS's overload,
Gorin added.
Patricia Devaney, associate dean of
graduate studies, said the University
is in the midst of the decision phase.
" We are aware of the long queues at
LOTS," Devaney said. "We are now
looking at the iong-term and short
term solutions to this problem," she
added.
Until action is taken, Gorin offered
advice for students who need to use
LOTS.
"Come in early in the morning. Be
lieve me, very few people at Stanford
get up early," Gorin said. "When you
come in, make sure you are prepared.
The computer does not think for you,
and sitting in front of it or being in its
proximity will not help you think. If
you prepare well, you succeed."
