# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Michael Lighty/Phil Ansell Kennedy's letter to clericals condemned 
### 
On Jan. 27, President Donald
Kennedy sent a letter to all Uni
versity facility and staff ex
pressing his opposition to the
current unionization drive
among Stanford's clerical work
ers and library support staff.
Last week, the majority of the
Daily editorial board declared,
"The Daily supports this action
as an unequivocal statement of

personal opinion and expression
of management views" (Daily,
Feb. 25). In contrast, we con
tend that Kennedy's letter war
rants unequivocal condemna
tion.
The central problem with the
Daily's position is its implicit
acceptance of two basic tenets
of the liberal ideology which
prevails in our society: all con

tracts including those between
workers are free and voluntary;
and communication takes place
in a free marketplace of ideas
where all participants have an
equal opportunity to express
their views. The current rela
tionship between the University
and its clerical employees ex
emplifies the utter falsity of
these two premises.
In a formal sense, all workers
do choose their place of em
ployment. In actuality, workers
are forced to work if they are to
survive. Particularly with the
high level of unemployment to
day, workers find themselves in
a tremendously subordinate
position. Without a collectively
bargained contract and griev
ance procedure, an aggrieved
Stanford clerical has, in the
words of librarian Lise Giraud,
two options: "bite the bullet or
quit" (Daily, Feb. 11). Essen
tially, management can afford
to lose a worker. A worker, how
ever, cannot afford to lose her
job.
Seen in this context, Ken
nedy's letter takes on a new sig
nificance. What might other
wise be an acceptable ex
pression of opinion becomes a
not-so-subtle attempt at coer
cion. A fundamental inequality
of power characterizes the rela
tion between the University and
its clericals. In the absence of
the collective power inherent of
unionization, clericals are at the
mercy of management. Hence,
the potential for intimidation in
a letter such as Kennedy's is
very high. Furthermore, as
Giraud pointed out, "There is no
question that (Kennedy's)
statement constitutes a pow
erful manifesto of support for
all lower-level supervisors who
wish ... to dissuade, discourage
or intimidate employees from
joining a union." (Daily, Feb.
11).

Our second point concerns ac
cess to the means of com
munication. Liberal ideology
posits a market place of ideas in
which all participants have an
equal opportunity to express
their views. These ideas, in
turn, supposedly gain influence
on the basis of their instrinstic
merit. The way in which Ken
nedy's letter was distributed de
mystifies this conception, and
demonstrates the bias of this
marketplace.
Eight thousand copies of a let
ter whose central sentence was,
"I believe it would be a mistake
to unionize," were distributed
through the clerical workers
themselves. The Office Staff Or
ganizing Committee (OSOC)
possesses no similar means of
communication. OSOC cannot
broadcast its views with any
where" near the efficiency en
joyed by President Kennedy.
Given this situation, the Daily's
characterization of Kennedy's
letter as "an honest attempt to
include all members of the Uni
versity community in dis
cussion of the question" is
absurd (Daily, Feb. 25). It is in
fact an exploitation of the Uni
versity's unequal opportunity to
make its voice heard.
Despite the prevalent ideol
ogy of egalitarianism and equal
opportunity, domination per
meates our society. In relations
between women and men, labor
and capital, blacks and whites,
inequalities of power per
sistently assert themselves. If
we are to move toward a just so
ciety, we must wage a frontal
attack on domination in all its
aspects. The clerical workers'
organizing drive is one step in
this direction; we await its suc
cess.
