Bellicose attitude
Mexico, Brazil and West Ger
many have publicly and point
edly objected to U.S. interven
tion in El Salvador. West Ger
many has gone so far as to offer
to mediate the conflict in El
Salvador by proposing nego
tiations between the govern
ment and the popular opposition
forces represented by the FDR.
Only the United States con
tinues to maintain a bellicose
and clOse-minded position on
the civil war in El Salvador.
President Ronald Reagan
claims to support, not the right
wing in El Salvador, but the so
called "centrist junta." Yet, the
president of that junta, Jose
Napoleon Duarte, has publicly
opposed further U.S. military
aid to his country. Saturday, I
read in the Christian Science
Monitor that Haig is sending
more military aid at the request
of the government. "Govern
ment' ' must be a euphemism for
right-wing Col. Jose Guillermo
Garcia, since Duarte clearly
doesn't want it. Every civilian
member of the October 1979
"centrist" junta has either re
signed and joined the opposition
forces or has been replaced. The
one liberal military member of
the junta, Adolfo Arnoldo Ma
jano, who supported the
agrarian reforms the U S. State
Department keeps pointing to
as a sign of progress, now sits in
jail.
The U.S. position toward our
Latin American neighbors has
not shifted since the Monroe
Doctrine. We still see the Amer

icas as our hemisphere. We
carry big sticks, but we do not
walk softly. Instead we flood the
ground of El Salvador with the
blood of refugees, most of whom
are women and children — and
even our own missionaries. We
are responsible because we
have the power to stop the civil
war. If we made our economic
assistance conditional upon a
political settlement, the war
could stop tomorrow. Why
doesn't this great nation of ours
lend a helping hand to poor na
tions like El Salvador instead of
being a mill-stone around their
necks?

Nix Charlie Chan
Recently, the Asian Ameri
can Students Association en
dorsed the Coalition of Asians to
Nix Charlie Chan, an organiza
tion active in Los Angeles and
the Bay Area, in its effort to or
ganize broad public education
and protest of the demeaning
character of the film, Charlie
Chan and the Curse of the
Dragon Queen. At this time, we
would like to share with the
Stanford community our feel
ings about the film. The
portrayal of Chinese people in
this recent movie is both ugly
and misleading. We believe tht
such stereotypes can only add to
misunderstandings between
Chinese and non-Chinese peo
ple, particularly in these con
servative times. We hope that
people will consider this if they

are thinking about seeing the
movie or when deciding on what
movie to see next.

New fee assessment
It has come to my attention
that attending Stanford is get
ting rather expensive. Many of
our students are also aware of
this problem. With 10,000 plus
students paying $10,000 plus, we
have an obvious situation point
ing towards a lottery. I hereby
propose a "free-ride fee
assessment" applicable each
quarter and treated similarly to
the other fee assessments. A $1
non-refundable fee should be
tacked on at registration for all
students (graduates and under
graduates). This appropriate
sum of money would then be raf
fled off by random selection of
student ID number. Only one
winner should be chosen each
quarter so as to make it truly a
free-ride prize. For this meager
lee, students can subsidize their
fellow students and rid part of
the Stanford problem for a lucky
few. Think of how your parents
would react if you won. Think of
not telling them and buying a
small boat or European import
instead. A free-ride fee
assessment should seriously be
considered by the folks who
print up the PTR's.

New fee assessment
It has come to my attention
that attending Stanford is get
ting rather expensive. Many of
our students are also aware of
this problem. With 10,000 plus
students paying $10,000 plus, we
have an obvious situation point
ing towards a lottery. I hereby
propose a "free-ride fee
assessment" applicable each
quarter and treated similarly to
the other fee assessments. A $1
non-refundable fee should be
tacked on at registration for all
students (graduates and under
graduates). This appropriate
sum of money would then be raf
fled off by random selection of
student ID number. Only one
winner should be chosen each
quarter so as to make it truly a
free-ride prize. For this meager
lee, students can subsidize their
fellow students and rid part of
the Stanford problem for a lucky
few. Think of how your parents
would react if you won. Think of
not telling them and buying a
small boat or European import
instead. A free-ride fee
assessment should seriously be
considered by the folks who
print up the PTR's.

Bellicose attitude
Mexico, Brazil and West Ger
many have publicly and point
edly objected to U.S. interven
tion in El Salvador. West Ger
many has gone so far as to offer
to mediate the conflict in El
Salvador by proposing nego
tiations between the govern
ment and the popular opposition
forces represented by the FDR.
Only the United States con
tinues to maintain a bellicose
and clOse-minded position on
the civil war in El Salvador.
President Ronald Reagan
claims to support, not the right
wing in El Salvador, but the so
called "centrist junta." Yet, the
president of that junta, Jose
Napoleon Duarte, has publicly
opposed further U.S. military
aid to his country. Saturday, I
read in the Christian Science
Monitor that Haig is sending
more military aid at the request
of the government. "Govern
ment' ' must be a euphemism for
right-wing Col. Jose Guillermo
Garcia, since Duarte clearly
doesn't want it. Every civilian
member of the October 1979
"centrist" junta has either re
signed and joined the opposition
forces or has been replaced. The
one liberal military member of
the junta, Adolfo Arnoldo Ma
jano, who supported the
agrarian reforms the U S. State
Department keeps pointing to
as a sign of progress, now sits in
jail.
The U.S. position toward our
Latin American neighbors has
not shifted since the Monroe
Doctrine. We still see the Amer

icas as our hemisphere. We
carry big sticks, but we do not
walk softly. Instead we flood the
ground of El Salvador with the
blood of refugees, most of whom
are women and children — and
even our own missionaries. We
are responsible because we
have the power to stop the civil
war. If we made our economic
assistance conditional upon a
political settlement, the war
could stop tomorrow. Why
doesn't this great nation of ours
lend a helping hand to poor na
tions like El Salvador instead of
being a mill-stone around their
necks?

Nix Charlie Chan
Recently, the Asian Ameri
can Students Association en
dorsed the Coalition of Asians to
Nix Charlie Chan, an organiza
tion active in Los Angeles and
the Bay Area, in its effort to or
ganize broad public education
and protest of the demeaning
character of the film, Charlie
Chan and the Curse of the
Dragon Queen. At this time, we
would like to share with the
Stanford community our feel
ings about the film. The
portrayal of Chinese people in
this recent movie is both ugly
and misleading. We believe tht
such stereotypes can only add to
misunderstandings between
Chinese and non-Chinese peo
ple, particularly in these con
servative times. We hope that
people will consider this if they

are thinking about seeing the
movie or when deciding on what
movie to see next.
