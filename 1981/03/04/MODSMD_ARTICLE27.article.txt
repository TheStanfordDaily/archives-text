## Urban leaders protest budget cuts 
### 
Washington(AP) â€” Urban
leaders, insisting President
Ronald Reagan must have
someone else in mind when he
refers to "selfish interest
groups" sniping at his economic
recovery plan, are refusing to
hold their fire to drive home the
impact of proposed budget cuts.
The board of the National
League of Cities reacted to the
president's speech to the group
Monday by adopting a critique
which agrees to a few of the con
cessions Reagan asked of the
cities but balks at far more.
"What he was concerned

about was 'selfish' self-interest
groups," said Mayor William
Hudnut of Indianapolis, the
league's president. "I do not
view us as a selfish, knee-jerk,
self-interest group."
Mayor William Schafer of
Baltimore said he won't let
himself be cast "in that de
fensive position, that if we sug
gest certain things we are self
ish."
"I'm going to let everybody
know the impact on the city (of
Reagan's planned budget cuts)
and if they're satisfied, I will
have done everything I possibly

can," Schafer said.
Mayor Charles Royer of Seat
tle said: "Of course, we are sup
portive of means to fight infla
tion. We just don't want it to be
done at the expense of people
who are helpless or who are at
or near the survival level al
ready."
Newark Councilman Donald
Tucker, chairman of the city of
ficials' black caucus, said: "It
means that the disadvantaged
and the poor are going to be
dumped directly on the cities,
and I don't believe we should
stand by and let that happen,
whether it's the president of the
United States or anyone else."
Reagan told the urban leaders
they should view his election

last fall as a signal to shake up
the economy and wind down
government at all levels "be
cause it is a mandate for us all."
"We are all in the same boat,
and we have to get the engines
started before the ship goes
over the falls," Reagan said.
"The real threat to recovery
comes from those who will op
pose only a small part of the ov
erall program while supporting
the overall effort."
"The small portion these pa
rochial groups oppose always
deals with cuts that affect them
directly. Those cuts they op
pose. They favor cutting some
body else's subsidy. The ac
cumulative effect of this short
sightedness can be damaging."
