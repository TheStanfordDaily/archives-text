Greensboro, N.C. (AP) â€” Six American Nazis and supporters
were arrested Monday on charges of conspiring to stage a series of
terrorist attacks in the event that a group of Ku Klux Klansmen and
Nazis was found guilty of murdering five leftist demonstrators.
A federal indictment charged the six with conspiring to blow up a
large petroleum storage facility, a chemical fertilizer plant, a shop
ping mall and part of downtown Greensboro with dynamite and a
napalm-type material.
Among the targets of the alleged conspiracy was the Guilford
County Courthouse and a large gasoline tank farm on Interstate 40
west of Greensboro, said a courthouse source who asked not to be
identified
The indictment, returned Monday by a federal grand jury in
Asheville, accused the six of planning to put the napalm-type gelatin
explosives in 55-gallon barrels "in crowded areas of the city and re
motely ... (detonate them) at 4 p.m. so as to maximize the destruc
tive effect."
Those charged with one count of conspiracy were Frank Lee
Braswell, 49, of Penland, and his wife, Patsy, 32; and four Winston-
Salem men, Raeford Melano Caudle, 38, Joseph Gorrell Pierce, 28,
Roger Allen Pierce, 25, and James Christopher Talbert, 30.
A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office said after an ap
pearance before a U.S. magistrate in Asheville that Braswell was
held in lieu of $50,000 secured bond and his wife was released on
$50,000 unsecured bond.
The others, except for Talbert, were taken to Greensboro to ap
pear before U.S. District Judge Herman Smith, who set bond at
$50,000 each. Talbert made arrangements to surrender Tuesday in
Greensboro, authorities said.
The arrests stemmed from an investigation by agents of the Bu
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the indictment said.
The grand jury charged that the attacks, which never were car
ried out, were planned "in response to and in retaliation for an an
ticipated guilty verdict in the Greensboro murder trial" of six
Klansmen and Nazis.
Those men were acquitted last November of first-degree murder
and rioting charges stemming from the deaths of five Communist
Workers Party members who were shot to death while staging a
"Death to the Klan" rally in Greensboro on Nov. 3,1979.
