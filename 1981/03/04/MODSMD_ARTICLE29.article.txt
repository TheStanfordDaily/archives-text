# Mardi Gras ends with revelry
## 
### 
New Orleans (AP) — A million partygoers
greeted Fat Tuesday yesterday with costumed
revelry and plenty of spirit as the Mardi Gras
festival ended with the traditionally ornate pa
rades that foreshadow an Ash Wednesday
hangover of headaches and littered streets.
Twenty-three of the former American
hostages in Iran were in town for the festivities
and a French Quarter hotel balcony was re
served so that nine ex-hostage Marines could
watch today's parades above the throng
But as the celebration wound down the city's
streets, police were investigating the shooting
of two young men.
Ray Johnson, 17, shot through the cheek and
neck as he led the St. Augustine High School
band in the Krewe of Bacchus parade Sunday
night, was in good condition at a hospital. A
bystander, John Barker, 20, of Plaquemines,
was also in good condition with a gunshot
wound to the groin.
City police detective John Walters, 30, was
suspended without pay Monday, accused of dis
charging his weapon in violation of department
rules. No criminal charges were filed in the in
cident.
The most prestigious of today's parades, the
last of five dozen to roll through New Orleans

and its suburbs, was sponsored by the Kreweof
Rex, whose king was to raise his goblet six
times along the parade route to toast various
celebrities, including the former hostages and
Mayor Ernest Morial More than a million peo
ple were expected to line the parade route
Rex follows the Krewe of Zulu, a black group
that was formed to ridicule the white Carnival
krewes and now has as splashy and expensive a
parade as any Also on tap was a parade by the
Mardi Gras Indians, who don headdresses and
warpaint.
At least eight other parades were rolling in
the suburbs
In between, there are flashy costumes and
overindulgence, and tension in the crowds is
not uncommon. One band this year wound up
with half of its brass horns battered and bent
after an altercation with spectators who said
they were jabbed by trombone slides.
"It gets worse every year," said Johnson.
"They throw beer on you. They throw
doubloons and beads down our instruments."
The shooting followed a scuffle on the pa
rade route, some distance behind the floats
carrying Sgt. John McKeel and eight other
Marines who had been held hostage in Iran
