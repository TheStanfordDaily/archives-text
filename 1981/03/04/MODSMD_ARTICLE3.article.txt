# Creation suit continues
## 
### Pate Skene 
"Seems to me it's a long road to a
little house," Judge Irving Perluss
said yesterday after the issues were
narrowed drastically in a Sacramento
Superior Court trial pitting Crea
tionists against the state Board of
Education.
Robert Turner, attorney for crea
tionist Kelly Segraves and his sons,
formally withdrew the creationists'
complaint that the state's curriculum
guidelines for teaching evolution
"constitute . . . establishment of the
religion of secular humanism in vio
lation of the First and Fourteenth
Amendments."
Turner also assured the court re
peatedly that the defendants would not
ask the court to direct that crea
tionism be taught in public schools,
leaving at issue only the plaintiffs' as
sertion that curriculum guidelines
mandate a "dogmatic . . . indoctri
nating" presentation of evolution, in
hibiting creationists' "free exercise"
of their religious beliefs, also in vio
lation of the First Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution.
Deputy Attorney General Robert
Tyler said he "absolutely" will move
for dismissal of the case as soon as the
plaintiffs rest their case.
Plaintiffs' attorney Turner said he
had expected to rest his case yester
day, but was prevented from doing so
by Tyler's three-hour cross-examina
tion of Segraves. Turner indicated the
creationists will finish presenting
their case some time today.
Segraves took the witness stand yes
terday to testify that: "I believe God
created man as man and put him on
this earth," and that the evolutionary

theory of a common ancestry for men,
plants and animals conflicts with his
religious beliefs.
Segraves testified under cross-ex
amination that his complaint focuses
on two sentences in the Board of
Education's 1978 Science Framework,
a curriculum guide for the state's
teachers.
At one point Perluss interrupted
Deputy Attorney General Robert
Tyler's cross-examination and said:
"I'm concerned that this lawsuit,
which I thought was about great Con
stitutional questions . . . jas evolved
â€” forgive me for the use of the word,
has become a question of semantics."
The debate involved a sentence in
the 1978 Framework which reads:
"This process (evolution) has been
going on so long that it has produced
all plants and animals now living, as
well as others which have become ex
tinct." and a preceding sentence in
troducing the principle of evolution.
Segraves argued that some quali
fying statement is required if the cited
sentence is not to be "dogmatic" or
"indoctrinating."
'Tyler argued that the offensive pas
sage was already adequately qualified
by an earlier section in the framework
discussing the nature and limitations
of scientific theories, and by a later
statement that "religious or
philosophical assumptions" regarding
"origins of life" are not suitable sub
ject matter for science.
The latter section assigns dis
cussions of religious interpretations to
the Social Science curriculum, and
creationism is discussed in the state's
Social Science Framework.
Turner insisted that the existing
qualifying statements are insuffi
cient.
Referring to the Framework pas
sage excluding "religious and
philosophical" interpretation of ori
gins from the science curriculum,
Perluss said, "This paragraph quali
fies the whole section (including the
statements on evolution). That's my
opinion."
Tyler yesterday confirmed rumors
that he had rejected a settlement offer
by the creationists "about a year
ago." He refused to discuss the settle
ment offer further.
Turner, asked why he had chosen to
withdraw his "establishment of re
ligion" argument during the trial,
when he would not do so in settlement
talks, replied, "Some night I woke up
and it struck me as a good thing to do."
