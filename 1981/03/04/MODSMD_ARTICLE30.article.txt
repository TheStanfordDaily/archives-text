# Political fundraisers foresee successful year

By The Washington Post
Washington — In the strange world of
political fund raising, liberal and conser
vative groups are gearing up for a boom
year at the mailbox and the bank. Both —
for entirely different reasons — think
that President Reagan and the conserva
tives elected with him will be good for
business.

News analysis

The election gave liberals something
that they badly needed to raise money: a
crisis and an easily perceived evil to rail
against in the form of Reagan and the
New Right. Donations to civil rights,
women's and environmental groups sud
denly surged. Their constituencies feel
threatened.
In the fund-raising business, it is
always easier to raise money when a de
mon can be identified, according to
direct mail experts.
"People don't give money in church to
go to heaven; they give to stay out of
hell," says one fund-raiser for liberal
groups.
"Most money is given out of fear and
anger," says another.
The election gave conservatives, long
lonely voices in the wilderness, some

thing they needed just as badly: victories
to claim and a realistic prospect that
their causes ultimately could triumph
over the dastardly liberals.
Thus, the tom-tom beats coming out of
the liberal and conservative camps this
winter carry entirely different
messages. Take these examples from
the liberal community:
From Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) in a
letter for Independent Action, a new po
litical action committee: "Unless we
start paying attention right now, a right
wing onslaught can take over the House
of Representatives in 1982! Yes, unless
we start to act now, we can face an un
paralleled tragedy next year — the total
control of our Congress by forces de
termined to turn back the clock on all we
have won in the past 20 years."
From former senator George McGov
ern, in a letter for the American Civil
Liberties Union: "Not since Mc-
Carthyism in the 1950s has such a move
ment (the New Right) been so vocal, so
well organized and so well financed. So
zealous. ... The danger is clear. The dan
ger is present. The time to act is now."
From the Sierra Club:"The onslaught
against conservation and environmen
talism will begin in earnest in early 1981.
Please heed this alert: Environmen
talists will face their toughest challenge

in more than a decade. ... We must meet
the Reagan administration's anti-en
vironmental juggernaut and stop it in its
tracks."
The election caused an abrupt turn
around in memberships and donations to
liberal, women's, environmental and
civil rights groups. The American Civil
Liberties Union raised $500,000 in De
cember 1980 - $200,000 more than the
previous December. Contributions to
Common Cause, the self-described
citizens' lobby, and the National As
sociation for the Advancement of Col
ored People (NAACP) jumped 33 per
cent in December and November.
The National Organization for Women
(NOW) picked up 12,000 new members in
the same period; the National Abortion
Rights Action League, a pro-abortion
group, added 10,000 new members. Dona
tions to the handgun control lobby sky
rocketed 150 percent, due largely to the
assasination of John Lennon. Environ
mentalists, hard pressed in their fund
raising efforts during the last years of
the Carter administration, suddenly
found themselves a hot property again.
"Reagan is good for business," ex
plains Roger Craver, of Craver,
Mathews, Smith & Co., a direct-mail

firm that raised $50 million for 30 liberal
groups and candidates last year. "Peo
ple give money in times of adversity
more than in times of tranquility."
Normally, Craver's firm would expect
a drop-off in business of about $10 million
the year after a presidential election.
But this year the firm projects no such
decline.
Conservatives, too, are looking toward
a banner year. Richard Viguerie, the
New Right mail expert, plans to double
the size of his 275-member firm within
the next 15 months, and start five or six
new newsletters and a book club.
Viguerie concedes he was worried that
Reagan's election would hurt his multi
million-dollar business, but claims his
fears proved unfounded.
"Everyone's (conservatives') mail
ings have gone through the roof since No
vember. Our mailings at the Viguerie
Company are doing better than ever
before," he says. "Conservatives, in our
lifetime, have never had any victories
before, and they are excited and en
thusiastic."
Conservatives are approaching Rea
gan from a direction that is opposite to
that of the liberals.
