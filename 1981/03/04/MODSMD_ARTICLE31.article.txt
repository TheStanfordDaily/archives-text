# Mayotte suffers suprise loss
## Racketeers beat Foothill 
### Ivan Maisel 
There are a lot of sports in
which junior colleges cannot
compete with their big sisters in
the University division, but
Foothill College proved yester
day that men's tennis isn't one
of them.
Though there was no surprise
in the final score, Stanford
almost had more than they
bargained for in yesterday's 6-3
win over Foothill yesterday at
Stanford Stadium.
It wasn't a win, but Foothill
coach Tom Chivington was
pleased Chivington replaced
boyhood friend Dick Gould in
1966 when Gould came to Stan
ford, and his teams have won six
state junior college cham
pionships. This year's squad is
equally talented.
"I'm pleased with the kids,"
Chivington said. "We're ob
viously underdogs, but we
played on our own level. We
didn't try to reach for the stars.
Now they can say Maybe we're
good enough the way we are."
Definitely good enough was
sophomore Brad Gilbert, who
upset Tim Mayotte 6-3,1-6,6-3 in
the No. 1 singles match. Both
players admitted they were not
in top form, but Gilbert, a fre

quent practice partner of May
otte's, turned on the juice when
needed.
Gilbert, who began as a
freshman at Arizona State two
years ago before leaving be
cause of personality conflicts
with the coach, consistently at
tacked Mayotte's backhand
with success. However, he
didn't seal the win until he cor
raled his erratic first serve,
connecting on 18-of-26 (69 per
cent) in the final set.
"Every time we play in prac
tice it's pretty close," Gilbert
said. "I just wanted to out
steady him. I wanted him to stay
back. He's got great volleys, but
I thought I could rally with him,
counter-punch him."
Mayotte is learning that ev
ery match at No. 1 is tough, and
that takes some getting used to.
"Last year there were a lot of
easy matches, especially at No.
3. I'm not psychologically pre
pared to play No. 1 in general.
It's much easier to come up in
the ranks where nothing is ex
pected.
"I'm not as mentally tough as
I'd like to be. I have to learn to
get up for every match," May
otte added. "I'm reaching a new
echelon where I need the same
abilities day in and day out. If

I'm not playing good, than I
have to play smart."
Leading the charge for a
patchwork Stanford lineup were
Jim Gurfein and Scott Bond
urant, both of whom were
straight-set winners in singles
and doubles.
Gould did without three of his
top men in singles. Scott Davis
was playing in a pro tournament
in Denver, where he lost a first
round match 6-3, 6-3 to 57th
ranked Andrew Pattison. John
Corse had an early afternoon
class, and Andy Chase stayed
behind for some extra practice
when the team came home from
the rained-out Pacific Coast
Doubles match in La Jolla.
Chase and Corse did get in
some doubles, but lost to Benson
and Joe Russell in a third-set
tiebreaker 6-7, 7-5, 7-6 (5-1).
Stanford's other loss was in No.
3 singles, where Jeff Arons
played his first match since a
bout with mononucleosis.

Foothill's Brad Gilbert upset Stanford's Tim Mayotte at number
one singles yesterday in three sets. The Cardinals took the team
competition, though, 6-3.
There are a lot of sports in
which junior colleges cannot
compete with their big sisters in
the University division, but
Foothill College proved yester
day that men's tennis isn't one
of them.
Though there was no surprise
in the final score, Stanford
almost had more than they
bargained for in yesterday's 6-3
win over Foothill yesterday at
Stanford Stadium.
It wasn't a win, but Foothill
coach Tom Chivington was
pleased Chivington replaced
boyhood friend Dick Gould in
1966 when Gould came to Stan
ford, and his teams have won six
state junior college cham
pionships. This year's squad is
equally talented.
"I'm pleased with the kids,"
Chivington said. "We're ob
viously underdogs, but we
played on our own level. We
didn't try to reach for the stars.
Now they can say Maybe we're
good enough the way we are."
Definitely good enough was
sophomore Brad Gilbert, who
upset Tim Mayotte 6-3,1-6,6-3 in
the No. 1 singles match. Both
players admitted they were not
in top form, but Gilbert, a fre

quent practice partner of May
otte's, turned on the juice when
needed.
Gilbert, who began as a
freshman at Arizona State two
years ago before leaving be
cause of personality conflicts
with the coach, consistently at
tacked Mayotte's backhand
with success. However, he
didn't seal the win until he cor
raled his erratic first serve,
connecting on 18-of-26 (69 per
cent) in the final set.
"Every time we play in prac
tice it's pretty close," Gilbert
said. "I just wanted to out
steady him. I wanted him to stay
back. He's got great volleys, but
I thought I could rally with him,
counter-punch him."
Mayotte is learning that ev
ery match at No. 1 is tough, and
that takes some getting used to.
"Last year there were a lot of
easy matches, especially at No.
3. I'm not psychologically pre
pared to play No. 1 in general.
It's much easier to come up in
the ranks where nothing is ex
pected.
"I'm not as mentally tough as
I'd like to be. I have to learn to
get up for every match," May
otte added. "I'm reaching a new
echelon where I need the same
abilities day in and day out. If

I'm not playing good, than I
have to play smart."
Leading the charge for a
patchwork Stanford lineup were
Jim Gurfein and Scott Bond
urant, both of whom were
straight-set winners in singles
and doubles.
Gould did without three of his
top men in singles. Scott Davis
was playing in a pro tournament
in Denver, where he lost a first
round match 6-3, 6-3 to 57th
ranked Andrew Pattison. John
Corse had an early afternoon
class, and Andy Chase stayed
behind for some extra practice
when the team came home from
the rained-out Pacific Coast
Doubles match in La Jolla.
Chase and Corse did get in
some doubles, but lost to Benson
