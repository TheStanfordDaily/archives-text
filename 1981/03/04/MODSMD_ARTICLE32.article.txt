### Ralph Walker 
Five Stanford pitchers com
bined for a one-hit shutout, and
first baseman Loring Davies
ripped four singles as the Card
baseball team whipped lack
adaisical Sonoma State 9-0 yes
terday.
Stanford, which improved its
record to 14-3, will open Pacif
ic-10 conference play this week
end at Sunken Diamond against
the defending NCAA champion
Arizona Wildcats.
Brian Mignano, Steve Cot
trell, Lee Cline, Brian Myers
and Gregg Lomnicky teamed up
for Stanford's fifth shutout of
the season. Centerfielder Matt
Allison got Sonoma's only hit
when he slapped a fifth-inning
single into left field off Cottrell.
Sonoma was denied two runs
and a second hit on the next play
when centerfielder Darryl Ste
phens robbed Brad Chane of a
homerun with a spectacular
leaping grab against the outfield

wall.
Mignano walked only one and
struck out two en route to his
third victory of the season.
Freshman Cottrell was equally
impressive, striking out three
and walking one in three in
nings.
"I'm always optimistic,"
said pitching coach Tom Dun
ton, when asked to asses his
corps, "but our pitching staff is
a lot deeper this year. We're
getting superb relief help in the
later innings."
Stanford's 11-hit attack was
led by Davies (4-for-5, 2 RBI),
shortstop Bob DeCosta (2-for-2,
home run), and second baseman
Phil Wilson (2-for-2, double and
2 RBI).
Stanford scored all the runs it
needed in the second inning. Ste
phens led off with a single and
was moved to second on Mike
Aldrete's walk. Davies followed
by collecting his first hit, driv
ing in Stephens and moving

Aldrete to third. Wilson then
cleared the bases with a two-run
double down the right field line.
The Cardinals then added two
more runs to make the score 5-0.
The Cardinals added one
more run in the fourth, when
rightfielder Mike Toothman
drove in Davies with his second
sacrifice fly of the game. In the
sixth inning DeCosta hit a solo
home run, his second of the sea
son. The Cards finished their
scoring for the day with two un
earned runs in the seventh.
The rumor that some Sonoma
State players sprayed ball re
pellant on their gloves before
the game was apparently well
founded, as the infielders aided
Stanford's offensive attack with
five errors.
Stanford assistant coach
Dean Stotz was not elated over
the victory. "Sonoma just began
its baseball program, and we
were playing them as a favor to
help them improve it.
