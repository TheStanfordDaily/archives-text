# Cardinal club sports weekly round-up
## 
### Susan Fischer 
The women's softbail club opened their 1981 sea
son with a nine inning game against Santa Clara. Be
ginning only their second season, the young
Cardinals fell 10-2 to their veteran NorCal oppo
nents. Freshman Kathy McClenahan went the dis
tance at pitcher, giving up those 10 runs on 9 hits and
4 walks. She received little support however, as the
Cards three errors led directly to Santa Clara
scores. Offensively, the Cards managed only two
hits. The team remains optomistic despite the loss.

The Stanford badminton team will host a double
match this Saturday against San Francisco State,
and the NorCal league's toughest member, Fresno
State. The Cardinals have not been able to defeat
Fresno State in eight matches, and are 2-1 for the
1981 season thus far. They handily defeated Hay
ward State and UC-Davis, and just narrowly lost to

San Francisco State in a previous match.
Junior sensation Rahul Naidu looks forward to
competing against the two teams in all three events:
singles, doubles with Tom Proulx, and mixed
doubles with Susan Fischer.
Karen Ditzer should be a Cardinal standout in
women's singles, while Alma Perez and Karen
Haubrich hope to prove a winning combination in
women's doubles. The match will begin at 8:00 a.m.
in Roble Gym.
Winter quarter was a busy one for the Stanford ice
hockey club. The Gryphons travelled to UC-Stockton
February 7, and defeated the Colts 3-2. They hosted
San Jose State the next day at Belmont Iceland, and
won 5-1. The Fresno State Suns came to town the fol
lowing week and surprised the Gryphons by rallying
to a 4-4 tie. Stanford hosted the Colts on February 22,

and tied them 3-3 after falling behind 1-3.
To top off the month, Stanford visited L.A. last
Saturday to face UC-Irvine. Bill Mulroy's four goal
performance led the Gryphons to a 7-2 victory. The
game was closer than the score indicates, as goalie
Paul Estey was outstanding, stopping six break
aways. Sunday, Stanford spotted Cal-State North
ridge a 2-0 lead before exploding with 11 unanswered
goals. Bill Mulroy led the Stanford scorers once
again, with a hat trick.
March will be another busy month. The squad
travels to Berkely this weekend, and will host Santa
Rosa at Belmont Iceland in two weeks. During
spring break they will head off to Seattle Washing
ton to compete in the West Coast Intercollegiate
Championships. Unbeaten since November, the
Gryphons boast a 10-3-2 record for the season, with
15 games still remaining through April.
