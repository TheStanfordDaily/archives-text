# Cards sting Sparts

### Steve Odell 
San Jose — Like a finely-tuned machine, the Stanford women's
tennis team rolled over San Jose State in high gear yesterday, 9-0.
The win was as easy as it sounds, and it keeps the Cards in precision
form as they prepare for their more powerful opponents.
"I'm happy with the win," said coach Frank Brennan, who has
still not been able to use his full line-up. "It served its purpose — we
got a little more experience, and everybody played pretty well. It
was a good team effort."
That it was. The Cards dominated at every position in both singles
and doubles, and did not drop a set on the afternoon. Indeed, they
have only dropped one individual match all year, and their team
record now stands at 3-0 on the season.
At No. 1 for Stanford was Susy Jaeger, who was playing in her first
intercollegiate singles match. Her rookie debut was no disappoint
ment as she quickly disposed of San Jose's Julie Rose, 6-2, 6-0. "It's
totally different," Jaeger said, in reference to team match play.
"You're always interested in how everyone else is doing. I really
enjoyed it."
Jaeger took advantage of a quick lead to work on her serve and
volley, and her on-the-job training was more than adequate. "I tried
to be a little more aggressive after the first set," the freshman from
Lincolnshire, 111., verified, "and I think I was. It's nice to get a
chance to do that under pressure."
It was the same story at the other end of the ladder where Joanna
Girard, another freshman, fared well, picking up three love sets
against the Sparts. At number six singles, she destroyed Jennifer
Johnson, zero and zero in about forty-five minutes. At number three
doubles, she teamed up with Sue Rasmussen to whip Polly Moore
and Johnson, 6-0, 6-2.
Also knowing the way to San Jose, and once there, picking up both
singles and doubles victories for the Cardinals, were Rasmussen,
Gayle Chan, and Alison Hardey.
Besides gaining some experience for his players and padding his
victory percentage, there was another reason Brennan wanted to
play the Spartans in San Jose. It is the site of the WAIAW Regionals,
and the coach wanted to familiarize his team with the surroundings.
"I wanted to come down here to take a look at the facilities," Bren
nan said. "I wanted them to get used to the courts a little bit — as
well as the highway noises. '' (The tennis stadium is located within a
quarter-mile of Interstate 280.)
If the Cards can perform as well in San Jose State's stadium in
May as they did yesterday, then Brennan hasn't got a thing to worry
about.
Stanford's next match will be this Friday against the University
of Pacific. Competiton will get under way at 1:30 at the Varsity
Courts.
