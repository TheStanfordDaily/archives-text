## Women cagers lose to Bears in OT 
### Bill Beyda 
The Stanford Cardinals wom
en's basketball team finished
their season with a loss to the
California Golden Bears in over
time. 87-93, Monday night at
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinals
forced first place Cal into the
overtime with outstanding play
by Louise Smith, who led the
Cardinals with 34 points, which
matches the career high she
reached earlier this year.

Smith's performance in
cluded clutch free throws in the
second half that helped the
Cards force the overtime. These
included sinking two technical
fouls called on Cal Coach Gooch
Foster, who was under
standably upset at some of the
worst refereeing ever seen by
this reporter. Stanford coach
Dotty McCrea was also penal
ized one technical foul.
Smith also led the Cards in re

bounds with 12, followed by
Metzger with 21 points and 6 re
bounds. and Kim Kupferer with
17 points and 8 rebounds.
Cal led most of the first half,
and appeared to be running
away with the game, when Stan
ford began to apply its pressure
defense. The defense slowed
down Cal. and the Cards led at
the end of the first half, 38-36. on
a basket by Smith. Cal almost
tied the game at the halftime
buzzer with a shot from ha\f
court that bounded off the
backboard and bounced off the
rim.
Stanford led the entire second
half, until Cal tied the score,
79-79, with 46 seconds left. Stan
ford was unable to score, and
the game went into overtime.
Cal then took an 87-82 lead,
which proved insurmountable.
Clutch free throw shooting by
Meg Metzger brought the Cards
to within three points with 1:11
left, but Cal pulled farther
ahead again and the season
ended for Stanford with the
scoreboard showing a Cal vie

tory.
When the final buzzer
sounded, the ball was in senior
starter Kathy Murphy's hands.
It is fitting that she ended her
four year Stanford career on the
court in the middle of the action.
Murphy was the first Stanford
women to receive a basketball
scholarship, and it is on her that
today's team was built.
The loss gives the Cardinals a
15-16 record, that concerns
neither NVcCrea nor tYve team.
They are a different squad than
the one that started the con
ference season in January. They
are communicating, and
playing tight defense. They
have exhibited the ability to
come from behind, and beat
first place Cal in their last meet
ing. 73-72. a feat that only one
other team in the conference
has accomplished this year.
Next year, the entire team
will be returning except for
Murphy, and former star
Jeanne Ruark Hoff will also be
back, to add even more
dimension to the team.
