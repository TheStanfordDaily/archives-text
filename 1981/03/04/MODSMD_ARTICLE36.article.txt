Reagan enacts CETA hiring freeze
Washington — The Reagan administration invoked
Monday a freeze on hiring of public service workers under
the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act.
The administration wants to phase out some 340,000 fed
erally subsidized jobs in state and local government by the
end of the current fiscal year. It notified regional adminis
trators of the Labor Department's Employment and
Training Administration that no new jobs be filled under
two programs authorized by CETA — the Title 11-D and Ti
tle VI programs.
Some city officials seemed taken aback by the hiring
freeze because President Ronald Reagan had said in his
Feb. 18 message to Congress and the nation that the two
CETA jobs programs would be phased out in Fiscal 1982,
beginning Oct. 1.
Jack Hashian. a spokesman for the department's Em
ployment Training Administration, confirmed, however,
that an order carrying out the freeze went out late last
week.
In his budget message to Congress last month. Reagan
indicated that as much as $635 million could be saved by
phasing out CETA jobs under the public service categories
bv the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30.
AFL-CIO joins women's movement
Washington — One of the largest labor unions linked
arms yesterday with the women's movement to launch an
organizing campaign aimed at the nation's 20 million sec
retaries and clerical workers.
Taking a cue from a recent movie, the organizers will
campaign under the banner of newly created District 925
— as in Nine-to-Five — of the AFL-CIO Service Employ
ees International Union.
"Office workers are among the most underpaid and
abused members of the work force." John Sweeney, in
ternational union president, said.
District 925, half of whose members are female, is join
ing with Working Women-The National Organization of Of
fice Workers, to organize one of the largest and fastest
growing segments of the American work force.
Sweeney said the campaign would be aimed at the mil
lions of Americans who suffer the "special indignities of
office work," and whose low wages "have replaced
janitors and other service employees as the country's low
est-paid workers."
Soviet Politburo reinstated in full
Moscow — The entire Soviet Politburo was reinstalled
intact yesterday for new five-year terms, a dramatic con
firmation of Leonid Brezhnev's aversion to any change at
the rigidly balanced pinnacle of Soviet power that could
open the way for a younger succession after he is gone.
Despite serious economic challenges and foreign policy
problems that already seem certain to tax the ruling
gerontocracy's resourcefulness and stamina to the limit
this decade, not a single new face was added to the leader

ship, nor an old one dropped.
From the oldest member of the inner circle. 82-year-old
Latvian party chief Arvid Pelshe, to the newest and
youngest, 50-year-old agricultural expert Mikhail
Gorbachov. the faces will stay the same through the next
five years barring death or disgrace. According to veteran
observers, this is the first time since the 1917 revolution
brought the party to power that the communists have
emerged from a party congress without making a single
change to the leadership roster
Med fly may lower fruit prices
San Francisco — California consumers could reap a
windfall in low-cost fruits and vegetables because of Tex
as' ban on unfumigated California produce, agriculture of
ficials say.
The ban went into effect Sunday after Texas officials
said they were worried about fruit infested with the Medi
terranean fruit fly contaminating their state's crops. But
Clark Biggs, spokesman for the California Farm Bureau
Federation, said it has created a "logistical nightmare"
for growers, packers and distributors.
Until the problem of where and how the produce will be
fumigated, the shipments of produce to Texas are at a
standstill, he said.
Govt to recall $1 million
Washington — The government is taking back $1 million
of the $4 million given to four national charities to help
poor people pay their heating bills.
In return, the Reagan administration is dropping efforts
to get all the money back and will let the charities resume
handing out the other $3 million.
Paul Bloom, the lame-duck Carter administration of
ficial who started the furor by handing out the money on
his last day in office, said Reagan officials decided to set
tle in order to get out of the embarrassing position of
"shooting at Santa Claus."
