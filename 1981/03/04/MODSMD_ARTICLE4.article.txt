# Aid plan draws mixed reaction
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
University reaction to the an
nouncement Monday that the United
States would send 20 additional ad
visers and $25 million in military aid
to El Salvador was mixed yesterday
as several Latin America specialists
voiced first impressions to the latest
U.S. move in Central America.
America's newest intervention in
El Salvador is lamentable, according
to Director of Latin American Stud
ies, John Wirth. The problems in that
country are social and economic in na
ture and not military, he said. Sending
American advisers into the country is
being done as a signal to the Russians,
Wirth said. As such, the U.S. is in
ternationalizing the question in El
Salvador by linking it with the Soviets,
he said.
Food Research Institute Prof. Clark
Reynolds noted the diplomatic
ramifications of increasing monetary
and military aid and adding 20 ad
visers to the 25 Americans already in
El Salvador. "There is a hardening of
the U.S. position evident in the admin
istration's announcement. This move
could make U.S. negotiation in Cen
tral America much more difficult and
could lead to polarization in the area,

as well as increased military involve
ment in the area," he said
Reynolds said he questioned the
feasibility of a stepped-up U.S. mili
tary involvement in the Latin Ameri
can country "The case is that we
don't have sufficient logistical and in
ternational support for a full scale
Central American involvement and at
the same time, to support and defend
U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf," he
said.
Visiting Political Science Prof.
Francisco Orrego expressed less
pessimistic reactions to increased
American assistance to the govern

ment of El Salvador in its battle
against leftist guerrillas.
"My first impression is that the sit
uation in El Salvador is becoming a se
rious one. This U.S. move seems un
related to a general Latin American
policy. There doesn't seem to be a
clearly defined policy toward this re
gion.
"It is difficult to say if increased
American assistance is bad since we
don't know what role (U.S.) advisers
there will actually play." added Or
rego, the director of international
studies at the University of Chile.
State Dept. spokesman William
Dvess said Monday American per
sonnel in El Salvador and those sent as
a result of the latest administration
decision will not be involved in combat
activities.
Hoover Institution Senior Fellow
Seymour Martin Lipset, called the ad
ministration decision "expected."
"The United States is committed to
stopping the communist movement in
Latin America and around the world,"
he said.
Noting that he is no expert on U.S.
involvement in El Salvador. Lipset
said, "There is evidence of the Haig-
Nixon policy of stopping communist
expansion" in American involvement
in the Latin American nation.
Lipset denied the viability of nu
merous similarities between U.S. in
volvement in Vietnam and American
assistance in El Salvador. "There is
an obvious parallelism (between Viet
nam and El Salvador), but I don't
think this situation will develop into a
situation like Vietnam. The logistics
in El Salvador are very different. It is
very close to the United States, and
the Soviets are very far away. The
Cubans are close, but we are telling
them to lay off El Salvador or they will
be in big trouble. If Cuba does not lay

off, the Vietnam issue comes up
again,"
Wirth expressed similar senti
ments. "The situation in El Salvador
will not come to a point like that in
Vietnam. I don't think we are going in
seriously there The centrist junta
there now has the upper hand They
don't need more military support."
Reynolds called Vietnam-El
Salvador comparisons "simplistic."
"El Salvador could become a
dynamically destabilizing situation in
which we commit more men and mon
ey there and lose other countries' sup
port like Mexico who want a demo
cratic socialist regime in power in El
Salvador.
"El Salvador is not the place to
fight. It is a two-bit country full of poor
people and an unprogressive elite. It is
the worst place one can imagine for
the United States to say, 'Let's show
the flag.'
"We seem to be developing the ide
ology that where ideologies crop up
with which we don't agree we will
fight these countries, not with ideas,
but with weapons," Reynolds said.
The Food Research Institute pro
fessor said he expected significant
American reaction to the adminis
tration's latest El Salvador move.
"We are going to see significant na

tional protest. You can bet there will
be campus reaction and protest, but
such reaction may be misinterpreted
by the administration
"The Reagan administration may
react like the Nixon administration
did and say, 'It's international com
munism poisoning the minds of our
youth.' But Reagan's administration
will be a hell of a lot more expert at re
pressing student protest because they
have had 10 years of experience since
the '60s at repressing protest.

ment of El Salvador in its battle
against leftist guerrillas.
"My first impression is that the sit
uation in El Salvador is becoming a se
rious one. This U.S. move seems un
related to a general Latin American
policy. There doesn't seem to be a
clearly defined policy toward this re
gion.
"It is difficult to say if increased
American assistance is bad since we
don't know what role (U.S.) advisers
there will actually play." added Or
rego, the director of international
studies at the University of Chile.
State Dept. spokesman William
Dvess said Monday American per
sonnel in El Salvador and those sent as
a result of the latest administration
decision will not be involved in combat
activities.
Hoover Institution Senior Fellow
Seymour Martin Lipset, called the ad
ministration decision "expected."
"The United States is committed to
stopping the communist movement in
Latin America and around the world,"
he said.
Noting that he is no expert on U.S.
involvement in El Salvador. Lipset
said, "There is evidence of the Haig-
Nixon policy of stopping communist
expansion" in American involvement
in the Latin American nation.
Lipset denied the viability of nu
merous similarities between U.S. in
volvement in Vietnam and American
assistance in El Salvador. "There is
an obvious parallelism (between Viet
nam and El Salvador), but I don't
think this situation will develop into a
situation like Vietnam. The logistics
in El Salvador are very different. It is
very close to the United States, and
the Soviets are very far away. The
Cubans are close, but we are telling
them to lay off El Salvador or they will
be in big trouble. If Cuba does not lay

off, the Vietnam issue comes up
again,"
Wirth expressed similar senti
ments. "The situation in El Salvador
will not come to a point like that in
Vietnam. I don't think we are going in
seriously there The centrist junta
there now has the upper hand They
don't need more military support."
Reynolds called Vietnam-El
Salvador comparisons "simplistic."
"El Salvador could become a
dynamically destabilizing situation in
which we commit more men and mon
ey there and lose other countries' sup
port like Mexico who want a demo
cratic socialist regime in power in El
Salvador.
"El Salvador is not the place to
fight. It is a two-bit country full of poor
people and an unprogressive elite. It is
the worst place one can imagine for
the United States to say, 'Let's show
the flag.'
"We seem to be developing the ide
ology that where ideologies crop up
with which we don't agree we will
fight these countries, not with ideas,
but with weapons," Reynolds said.
The Food Research Institute pro
fessor said he expected significant
American reaction to the adminis
tration's latest El Salvador move.
"We are going to see significant na

tional protest. You can bet there will
be campus reaction and protest, but
such reaction may be misinterpreted
by the administration
"The Reagan administration may
react like the Nixon administration
did and say, 'It's international com
munism poisoning the minds of our
youth.' But Reagan's administration
will be a hell of a lot more expert at re
pressing student protest because they
have had 10 years of experience since
the '60s at repressing protest.
University reaction to the an
nouncement Monday that the United
States would send 20 additional ad
visers and $25 million in military aid
to El Salvador was mixed yesterday
as several Latin America specialists
voiced first impressions to the latest
U.S. move in Central America.
America's newest intervention in
El Salvador is lamentable, according
to Director of Latin American Stud
ies, John Wirth. The problems in that
country are social and economic in na
ture and not military, he said. Sending
American advisers into the country is
being done as a signal to the Russians,
Wirth said. As such, the U.S. is in
ternationalizing the question in El
Salvador by linking it with the Soviets,
he said.
Food Research Institute Prof. Clark
Reynolds noted the diplomatic
ramifications of increasing monetary
and military aid and adding 20 ad
visers to the 25 Americans already in
El Salvador. "There is a hardening of
the U.S. position evident in the admin
istration's announcement. This move
could make U.S. negotiation in Cen
tral America much more difficult and
could lead to polarization in the area,

as well as increased military involve
ment in the area," he said
Reynolds said he questioned the
feasibility of a stepped-up U.S. mili
tary involvement in the Latin Ameri
can country "The case is that we
don't have sufficient logistical and in
ternational support for a full scale
Central American involvement and at
the same time, to support and defend
U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf," he
said.
Visiting Political Science Prof.
Francisco Orrego expressed less
pessimistic reactions to increased
American assistance to the govern

ment of El Salvador in its battle
against leftist guerrillas.

uation in El Salvador is becoming a se
