# Aid plan draws mixed reaction

University reaction to the an
nouncement Monday that the United
States would send 20 additional ad
visers and $25 million in military aid
to El Salvador was mixed yesterday
as several Latin America specialists
voiced first impressions to the latest
U.S. move in Central America.
America's newest intervention in
El Salvador is lamentable, according
to Director of Latin American Stud
ies, John Wirth. The problems in that
country are social and economic in na
ture and not military, he said. Sending
American advisers into the country is
being done as a signal to the Russians,
Wirth said. As such, the U.S. is in
ternationalizing the question in El
Salvador by linking it with the Soviets,
he said.
Food Research Institute Prof. Clark
Reynolds noted the diplomatic
ramifications of increasing monetary
and military aid and adding 20 ad
visers to the 25 Americans already in
El Salvador. "There is a hardening of
the U.S. position evident in the admin
istration's announcement. This move
could make U.S. negotiation in Cen
tral America much more difficult and
could lead to polarization in the area,

as well as increased military involve
ment in the area," he said
Reynolds said he questioned the
feasibility of a stepped-up U.S. mili
tary involvement in the Latin Ameri
can country "The case is that we
don't have sufficient logistical and in
ternational support for a full scale
Central American involvement and at
the same time, to support and defend
U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf," he
said.
Visiting Political Science Prof.
Francisco Orrego expressed less
pessimistic reactions to increased
American assistance to the govern

ment of El Salvador in its battle
against leftist guerrillas.
"My first impression is that the sit
uation in El Salvador is becoming a se
rious one. This U.S. move seems un
related to a general Latin American
policy. There doesn't seem to be a
clearly defined policy toward this re
gion.
"It is difficult to say if increased
American assistance is bad since we
don't know what role (U.S.) advisers
there will actually play." added Or
rego, the director of international
studies at the University of Chile.
