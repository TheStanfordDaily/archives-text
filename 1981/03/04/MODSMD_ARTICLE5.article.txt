# Battles wax in Salvador
## 
### Associated Press 
San Salvador — Soldiers and anti
junta guerrillas were locked in gun
battles in the northeast yesterday in
what the military claimed was a
"cleanup" of leftist strongholds.
And in Washington, the Reagan ad
ministration waged a closed-door
campaign for congressional support
for tripling military aid to the con
vulsed Central American nation.
"The Salvadoran army has suc
ceeded in its objective of bringing
peace to the nation with only the help
of the people," proclaimed Defense
Minister Jose Guillermo Garcia He
said the left had been "smothered"
and "every day the situation tends to
improve."
Military commanders gave no casu
alty figures, but said there was fight
ing in Zacatecoluca and San Esteban
Caterina. some 35 miles north of here,
and farther north at Arcatao. National
police said 16 people were found dead
in the capital.
Garcia refused comment on junta

nouncement Monday that he would
meet with the Socialist International,
an international group espousing non
violent revolution that has offered to
be an intermediary in attempts at n
"These are political matters in
which the military will not in
tervene," Garcia said.
Duarte, a Christian Democrat who
depends on support of the armed
forces, did not indicate when or where
such negotiations might take place.
Secretary General Bernt Carlsson
of the Socialist International, repre
senting non-communist socialist
parties around the world, said partici
pation of the United States is essential
if mediation of the conflict is to suc-

ceed.
But a State Department spokesman
brushed aside the proposal even
before it was advanced.
The spokesman. William Dyess,
said he foresees no such role for the
United States
"As to whether or not the govern
ment of El Salvador wishes to pursue
negotiations at this time, and in what
channels, is a matter for the govern
ment of El Salvador to decide," Dyess
said. "I don't see now such a role for
us."
Dyess said the United States is not a
party to the dispute in El Salvador and
added: "El Salvador is not a client of
the United States. El Salvador is a sov
ereign independent country. We will
not tell them what to do."
Without such participation, "the
mediation couldn't even start," said
Carlsson. who met with key State De
partment officials.
Carlsson said that on Monday he
presented to U.S. Ambler Moss, the
U.S. ambassador to Panama, his
group's proposal that Willy Brandt,
former chancellor of West Germany,
be the chief mediator in talks aimed at
finding a political solution to the crisis
in El Salvador.
