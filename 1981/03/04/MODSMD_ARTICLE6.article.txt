# Reagan urges funds for new naval forces

### Washington Post 
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan will ask Congress today to ap
prove and finance a new naval
strategy that calls for the creation of
15 task forces powerful enough to take
on the Soviets in their home waters
and to attack targets far inland with
cruise missiles launched from de
mothballed battleships.
Navy Secretary John Lehman
called the Reagan blueprint "a major
change in naval strategy" and "a very
marked departure from the low
threat, pulled-back Navy strategy of
the Carter administration."
He acknowledged it would cost
many extra billions. A down payment
of $4.2 billion will be requested from
Congress today in the form of an addi
tion to the existing Carter shipbuilding
budget of $6.6 billion. The extra money
would finance the start of another
Nimitz-class nuclear-powered air
craft carrier, a cruiser, two frigates
and a submarine, and would also pay
to pull the battleships lowa and New
Jersey and the aircraft carrier
Oriskany out of mothballs.
Lehman said the Carter adminis
tration opted for a more modest ship
building program in the belief that
"taking on high-threat challenges of
the Soviets was too expensive and not
necessary."
Bolder battle groups
But the Reagan administration,
Lehman said in a breakfast meeting
with reporters, has decided to be
bolder and prepare hattle groups that
could go into waters where the Soviet
navy is strongest, such as the oceans
north of the gap between Britain,
Greenland and Iceland.
The shipbuilding additions would be
part of a request for about $33 billion
beyond the Carter administration de
fense budgets for fiscal 1981 and 1982.
About $6.5 billion would be added to
the $171.2 billion fiscal 1981 request
and $26 4 billion to the fiscal 1982
budget of $196.4 billion.
Other officials said that the Navy
will get the lion's share of the total de
fense budget, about 38 percent The
Army's share is 29 percent, and the
gap has caused some internal squabbl
ing within the Pentagon.
Lehman said that the Navy should

have a fleet of 600 ships, up from 456
now. He argued that enough naval
forces to threaten the Soviets in such
strongholds as the Kola Peninsula
would help deter them from attacking
the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion's central front in Europe.
15 task forces
He mentioned 15 task forces; the
Navy has 12 carrier task forces now.
"You size your Navy for war-fight
ing," said Lehman in faulting what he
contends was an overly cautious
stance of the Carter administration.
The plan to reactivate the two 38-
vear-old battleships is the most radi
cal part of the effort to expand the
fleet and boost its offensive firepower
quickly in remote regions.
According to administration of
ficials, the plan involves loading up to
320 new 1500-mile-range Tomahawk

cruise missiles — with some 60-mile
range Harpoon missiles possibly mix
ed in — on each battlewagon. The mis
siles would be used against fixed
targets on enemy territory that would
otherwise have to be hit by warplanes
from carriers.
Cuts down on Navy jet loss
Since fixed targets are frequently
the most heavily defended, the new
strategy would presumably cut down
the loss of Navy jets to anti-aircraft
fire while allowing the carrier planes
to go after mobile targets or others
that the cruise missiles might not be
able to find or reach.
The idea of bringing back the bat
tleships is not new. A group of con
gressmen championed the idea last
year but it was eventually voted down.
Administration officials believe, how
ever, that there will be a big dif

ference this year.
Last year, the plan was portrayed
mostly as a way to bring heavy gunfire
to bear from offshore to support
Marine-style amphibious landings.
The Navy, officials said, was enjoined
from stressing the cruise missile pos
sibilities because the administration
was concerned about various arms
control implications and about the
risk that a push for sea-based cruise
missiles could derail a key decision by
allies in Europe to accept nuclear
tipped cruise missiles based on their
soil
Yesterday Lehman said he person
ally did not feel the United States
should be constrained any longer by
either the first or second strategic
arms agreement with Moscow in
building up its own arsenal to meet the
Soviet threat.
