# Court okays program patents

### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” In a ruling that could
prove of considerable practical and fi
nancial importance to the computer
software and other research-and-de
velopment industries, the Supreme
Court decided yesterday that proc
esses making use of computer pro
grams may sometimes be patented.
By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that
two scientists for the Federal-Mogul
Corp. in Detroit had made a legit
imate claim for a patent for devising a
process that uses a computer to cure
synthetic rubber.
In earlier cases, the court has made
clear that computer programs and
mathematical formulas are not them
selves entitled to patent protection.
The law has been unsettled, however,
on the question of whether inventions
or processes that employ computers
may be patented
In yesterday's ruling, the court held
that computer programs and formulas
may be patented when they are ap
plied to "a structure or process which,
when considered as a whole, is per
forming a function which the patent
laws were designed to protect (e.g..
transforming or reducing an article to

a different state or thing)."
The decision (Diamond vs. Diehr.
79-1112) was a setback for the U.S.
Patent Office and the Department of
Justice, which had pleaded with the
Supreme Court not to open the door for
patenting of computer proceesses
The decision also appeared to un
dercut a 1978 ruling, Parker vs. Flook,
in which the Supreme Court had ap
peared to indicate that processes
which do not involve any technological
breakthroughs other than the use of a
computer may not be patented
The U.S. Court of Customs and Pat
ent Appeals had interpreted this
earlier ruling in a narrow fashion and
had continued to grant patents to proc
esses using computers. In the new Su
preme Court decision yesterday, writ
ten by Justice William Rehnquist, a
majority of the justices agreed with
the logic of the special patent court.
The key point in Rehnquist's de
cision was that processes or inven
tions which use computers "must be
considered as a whole."
In the 1978 case, the high court had
suggested that, in judging whether a
process using a computer should be
given a patent, authorities should de

cide whether the process included
some new invention or whether it
merely added a computer to existing
technology.
This time, however, the justices
abandoned this approach. "A new
combination of steps in a process may
be patentable, even though all the con
stituents of the combination were
well-known and in common use before
the combination was made," Rehn
quist wrote.
In dissent. Justice John Paul
Stevens, the author of the earlier rul
ing. said the court was merely causing
confusion and failing to help patent
lawyers understand what sorts of
computer processes are patentable.

Did you get off to a shaky start yes
terday? Well, you weren't alone. An

Following the first shock an after
shock measured at 2.7 hit, according
to seismologists at Berkeley.
