## This week's page presents different ideas on how the brain functions Neurochemistry linked to mental disease 
### Mary Ellen Foley 
Stanford's Jack Barchas, pro
fessor of psychiatry and behav
ioral sciences and director of
the tfancy Friend Pritzker Lab
oratory of Behavioral Neu
rochemistry, is currently head
ing research which may greatly
change our understanding and
treatment of mental disorders.
In simplest terms, the re
search at the Pritzker lab is ex
amining how a subject's behav
ior affects his neurochemistry,
and how his neurochemistry af
fects later behavior. These stud
ies focus on the biochemical
aspects of depression and
schizophrenia.
Neurochemistry, a fairly new
field, has experienced a tremen
dous information explosion in
the past 20 years, says Barchas.
But current research is still
based on simpler interactions
between chemicals and neurons
(nerve cells). Information
passes between neurons in the
brain across gaps called
synapses, and these are bridged
by chemicals known as neu
rotransmitters. It is these
chemicals, neurotransmitters,
that are being studied here at
Stanford.
Opportunities from Stan
ford's behavioral neu
rochemistry studies are unique.
Barchas' biochemical labora
tory is complimented by the
Stanford Mental Health Clinical
Research Center (CRC),

headed by Dr. Phillip Berger,
professor of psychiatry here.
The CRC staff members have
been working very successfully
with psychotic patients on a
non-medication basis, while
Barchas and his associates ex
amine fluids of patients, who
participate voluntarily, to look
for metabolic abnormalities
linked with severe mental dis
orders. Thus, all groups benefit
from the results of these tests.
Most researchers at Stanford
refute the "a twisted thought, a
twisted molecule'' notion.
Barchas disagrees that treating
a mentally ill patient with drugs
is merely doing away with
symptoms without solving prob
lems, but he also denies the op
posite extreme, that medication
is the only real treatment, and
psychoanalysis is useless.
The best way to treat a pa
tient, according to Barchas, is
to use medication when useful,
but also to help the patient un
derstand the illness.
In focusing on depression and
schizophrenia, Barchas's re
search at Pritzker lab reveals
these disorders are linked to the
imperfect functioning of neu
rotransmitters.
"The remarkable thing about
them (neurotransmitters),"
says Barchas, "is that they are
so diverse." Some are small,
brain-produced molecules while
others, such as morphine-like
peptides, are more complex.

Others, as yet undiscernable,
may be a natural Valium or
anti-Valium of the brain. Re
search suggests as many as thir
ty of these neurochemicals
which affect behavior may gen
erate mental disorders.
Clinical depression symp
toms include changes in eating
habits, sexual habits, self
esteem, thought patterns and
patterns of movement. Patients
may feel unreasonable guilt or
sadness and may even attempt
suicide.
Barchas' researchers sug
gest chemical origins for such
symptoms: two neu
rotransmitters, serotonin and
norepinephrine (nor
adrenaline), are involved in de
pression. They exist in many
parts of the brain but are heav
ily concentrated in areas con
trolling emotions and moods. It
is thought depression is as
sociated with too small an
amount of the transmitters
available; mania, with too great
an amount.
Tricyclic antidepressants
(Elavil*and Nopramin) are the
drugs frequently prescribed for
depression. These prohibit "up
take," the natural absorption of
some neurotransmitters. This
inhibition causes more of the
neurochemicals to be available
in the synaptic cleft.
Researchers in the Pritzker
lab are trying to determine how
norepinephrine is formed. So

far, they have isolated and stud
ied the most important controll
ing enzyme, proven that the
enzymes involved are under ge
netic control, and studied the ef
fects of stress on enzyme activi
ty-
They are also interested in en
dorphins, which seem to be as
sociated with depression. These
are morphine-like drugs which
affect the body's response to
pain. Barchas and his cowork
ers study the effects of stress on
endorphins and the distribution
of these compounds throughout
the brain.
Schizophrenia, which is re
sponsible for one-fourth of those
in U.S. hospital beds, is also as
sociated with an imbalance of
neurotransmitters, Barchas ex
plains.
Past research produced two
biochemical hypotheses to ex
plain the cause of this disorder,
both of which involve an in
herited predisposition to ab
normal activity in areas of the
brain governing judgment and
reason.
However, the endorphin sys
tem, recently studied here, has
been implicated in
schizophrenia. Other explana
tions considered are excess
phenylethylamine, decreased
gamma aminobutyric acid and
an imbalance between
dopamine and acetylcholine, a
possibility actively studied
here.

tient, according to Barchas, is
to use medication when useful,
but also to help the patient un
derstand the illness.
In focusing on depression and
schizophrenia, Barchas's re
search at Pritzker lab reveals
these disorders are linked to the
imperfect functioning of neu
rotransmitters.
"The remarkable thing about
them (neurotransmitters),"
says Barchas, "is that they are
so diverse." Some are small,
brain-produced molecules while
others, such as morphine-like
peptides, are more complex.

Others, as yet undiscernable,
may be a natural Valium or
anti-Valium of the brain. Re
search suggests as many as thir
ty of these neurochemicals
which affect behavior may gen
erate mental disorders.
Clinical depression symp
toms include changes in eating
habits, sexual habits, self
esteem, thought patterns and
patterns of movement. Patients
may feel unreasonable guilt or
sadness and may even attempt
suicide.
Barchas' researchers sug
gest chemical origins for such
symptoms: two neu
rotransmitters, serotonin and
norepinephrine (nor
adrenaline), are involved in de
pression. They exist in many
parts of the brain but are heav
ily concentrated in areas con
trolling emotions and moods. It
is thought depression is as
sociated with too small an
amount of the transmitters
available; mania, with too great
an amount.
Tricyclic antidepressants
(Elavil*and Nopramin) are the
drugs frequently prescribed for
depression. These prohibit "up
take," the natural absorption of
some neurotransmitters. This
inhibition causes more of the
neurochemicals to be available
in the synaptic cleft.
Researchers in the Pritzker
lab are trying to determine how
norepinephrine is formed. So

far, they have isolated and stud
ied the most important controll
ing enzyme, proven that the
enzymes involved are under ge
netic control, and studied the ef
fects of stress on enzyme activi
ty-
They are also interested in en
dorphins, which seem to be as
sociated with depression. These
are morphine-like drugs which
affect the body's response to
pain. Barchas and his cowork
ers study the effects of stress on
endorphins and the distribution
of these compounds throughout
the brain.
Schizophrenia, which is re
sponsible for one-fourth of those
in U.S. hospital beds, is also as
sociated with an imbalance of
neurotransmitters, Barchas ex
plains.
Past research produced two
biochemical hypotheses to ex
plain the cause of this disorder,
both of which involve an in
herited predisposition to ab
normal activity in areas of the
brain governing judgment and
reason.
However, the endorphin sys
tem, recently studied here, has
been implicated in
schizophrenia. Other explana
tions considered are excess
phenylethylamine, decreased
gamma aminobutyric acid and
an imbalance between
dopamine and acetylcholine, a
possibility actively studied
here.
Stanford's Jack Barchas, pro
fessor of psychiatry and behav
ioral sciences and director of
the tfancy Friend Pritzker Lab
oratory of Behavioral Neu
rochemistry, is currently head
ing research which may greatly
change our understanding and
treatment of mental disorders.
In simplest terms, the re
search at the Pritzker lab is ex
amining how a subject's behav
ior affects his neurochemistry,
and how his neurochemistry af
fects later behavior. These stud
ies focus on the biochemical
aspects of depression and
schizophrenia.
Neurochemistry, a fairly new
field, has experienced a tremen
dous information explosion in
the past 20 years, says Barchas.
But current research is still
based on simpler interactions
between chemicals and neurons
(nerve cells). Information
passes between neurons in the
brain across gaps called
synapses, and these are bridged
by chemicals known as neu
rotransmitters. It is these
chemicals, neurotransmitters,
that are being studied here at
Stanford.
Opportunities from Stan
ford's behavioral neu
rochemistry studies are unique.
Barchas' biochemical labora
tory is complimented by the
Stanford Mental Health Clinical
Research Center (CRC),

headed by Dr. Phillip Berger,
professor of psychiatry here.
The CRC staff members have
been working very successfully
with psychotic patients on a
non-medication basis, while
Barchas and his associates ex
amine fluids of patients, who
participate voluntarily, to look
for metabolic abnormalities
linked with severe mental dis
orders. Thus, all groups benefit
from the results of these tests.
Most researchers at Stanford
refute the "a twisted thought, a
twisted molecule'' notion.
Barchas disagrees that treating
a mentally ill patient with drugs
is merely doing away with
symptoms without solving prob
lems, but he also denies the op
posite extreme, that medication
is the only real treatment, and
psychoanalysis is useless.
