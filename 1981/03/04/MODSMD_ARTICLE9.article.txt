# Pribram and Little offer new explanation of brain
## 
### Mitchell Sklar 
By constructing a
mathematical model of the
brain that can be analyzed and
interpreted, Stanford Pro
fessors Bill Little and Karl
Pribram hope they have pro
vided a new perspective of that
highly complex organ.
Their approach to the subject
analyzes the brain as a whole
instead of studying particular
neurons and their connections
(Neurons are nerve cells in the
brain).
"We talked to some neu
rophysiologists and realized we
were on totally different
wavelengths. What they are
doing is working with the indi
vidual neurons to a large extent.
What we are trying to do is work
with the collection of neurons,"
Little said.
The network of neurons is in
credibly intricate. There are
billions of cells in the human
brain, and each neuron is in
terconnected with thousands of
others. Thus, in its normal func
tioning by electrical stimu
lation, each neuron influences
many others.
In his model, Little considers
a "snapshot" of the brain at any
given instant. In that instant ev
ery neuron can be characterized
as either firing and stimulating
other cells, or not firing
"You map the pattern of ac
tivity in the brain onto a prob
lem in statistical mechanics,
which you know something
about from physics," explained
Little.
Little's model assumes that
each cell's firing has a certain

probability of causing a con
nected cell to fire also. There is
also a factor of "noise" in the
system, much like the random
static heard on a radio.
By treating this noise like any
other random noise in a physical
system, Little has found that
certain patterns persist if the
noise is below a critical level.
"This is the condition for your
being able to sustain a thought
in your head for as much as a
second," he said.
Pribram likens this notion of
memory being spread out over
the brain to a hologram, or
three-dimensional photograph
made with light from a laser.
"Mathematically, the con
cepts are very similar. In each
case the information stored is
delocalized, or spread out," he
said.
Pribram describes the opera
tion of memory in terms of a
Fourier transform, a
mathematical operation that
can also be applied to holo
graphic images. In both cases,
what results is that stimulating
only part of the stored image
will reconstruct the whole.
Pribram believes that this is
s the basis of association in the
human brain.
According to Pribram, once
an image is stored in this way, it
is always there. "Forgetting is
a process of faulty recall-mech
anism, not a result of losing any
stored information."
Little's model also suggests
that few models tend to persist,
though other patterns must be
built from these. Short-term
memory is accomplished from

these building-blocks and as
sociations.
"What you are trying to do
(when remembering some
thing) is to get an association of
the things, so you can re
member what they are," said
Little.
Little's work provides a basis
for long-term memory as well.
Little explained, "the long-term
memory is the latent ability of
the network to recreate the pat
tern that was there beforehand.
That is, it's pot the actual pat
tern but the capability of pro
ducing that pattern."
Pribram noted that long-term
memory does not seem to be lo
calized on one area of the brain,
but spread throughout it.
"Animals with localized
brain lesions may lose certain
functions, but they retain their
memory."
Little and Pribram make the
assumption that the synapses,
or connections between neu
rons, are strengthened as they
are used more often.
This aspect of Little's theory
explains the large role of as
sociation on long-term memory,
as well as the ability to recreate
a thought from parts of it.
Little constructed a simple
model of a four-celled brain to
test this theory. Computer sim
ulation showed that some pat
terns could indeed be re
constructed by stimulation with
only part of the pattern.
Little is currently working on
a model of approximately 100
nuerons which he hopes will suc
ceed in associating complex
patterns such as written sym
bols.
