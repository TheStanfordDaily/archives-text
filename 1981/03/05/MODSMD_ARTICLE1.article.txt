# $7.5 million pledged for circuits research center
## 
### 
Ten corporations, including Hon
eywell, General Electric, Hewlett-
Packard, IBM and Xerox, have
pledged $7.5 million to help build the
University's new Center for Inte
grated Systems, President Donald
Kennedy announced yesterday.
The University and the corporate
sponsors look to the Center to ac
celerate the electronics technology
revolution and to secure United States
leadership in the field, according to
Kennedy.
The Center will be used to increase
the complexity of miniature computer
circuitry, to design the software
needed to program the new circuits
and to turn out graduates able to de
sign radically new communications
and computational systems using the
circuitry, he said.
He identified the other five com
panies that pledged money as Fair
child, Northrup, Tektronix, TRW and
Texas Instruments.
First phase
The $7.5 million raised to date will
go to build the first phase of the cen
ter's laboratories and offices and to
buy capital equipment, Kennedy
added.
The Center will include a computer
managed "fast turnaround facility"
that will enable computer and in
formation systems theorists to feed

broad concepts into computers, using
terminals at their desks, and to have
integrated circuit specialists trans
late those concepts into designs by au
tomation. The actual silicon devices
will then be fabricated for testing, re
fining and spinning off into new com
munication and computation systems.
Policy
The Center's policy is established
by the Dean's Committee for the Cen
ter for Integrated Systems, which will
report to the provost.
The Center's director, John Linvill,
newly named professor of integrated
systems, calls the operation "a new
coupling of integrated circuit people
and computer systems people, which
should produce systems that could not
have been conceived by one or the oth
er alone."
Technology diffusion
He also said the industrial support
of the Center, and its diffusion of new
technology to industry mainly through
its graduates, "will represent a new
relationship between universities and
industry, comparable in importance
to that which developed between uni
versities and the federal government
following World War II."
The Center began formal operations
in temporary quarters last month.
