# U.N. commission probes disappearances

From the Daily wire services
Geneva — Western delegations on the
U.N. Human Rights Commission currently
meeting here are desperately trying to
salvage a U.N. investigation into thousands
ot missing persons — in the face of virulent
opposition from Argentina and the Soviet
Union, and complete indifference from the
new Reagan administration.
At stake is the future of a five-man U.N.
working group that was established last
year and has since received reports on be
tween 11,000 and 13,000 disappearances in 16
countries.
Human rights activists harbor high hopes
for the group, because disappearances, like
torture, are seen as one area where the U.N.
human rights apparatus can play a major
role — unlike such stock concerns as Israeli
settlements, or the Soviet occupation of Af
ghanistan.
Cooperation
The report singles out Ethiopia, Indo
nesia and Argentina for their failure to co
operate.
When asked to investigate the disap

pearance of 22 persons in East Timor be
tween 1977 and 1979, the Indonesian govern
ment replied, "As a matter of principle,
limited resources must be used for other
purposes."
Argentina has been the target of human
rights groups for years, and the group chose
a representative 500 disappearances from
thousands submitted to it. It concludes that
165 were probably the work of security
forces, and also lists 16 alleged secret deten
tion camps.
The Argentine government replied by
blaming disappearances on terrorism, and
insisting that all communications to the
group should be first screened and then dis
cussed under the commission's special con
fidential procedure.
This insistence comes at a time when dis
appearances are on the increase in
Guatemala and El Salvador, and when they
continue in Argentina, despite a diminution
of terrorism. Fifty were reported in 1980.
Last year, Argentina found itself isolated
and forced to agree to the group's estab
lishment. This year, in addition to develop

ing countries such as Brazil, Algeria and the
Philippines, it has the support of the two su
perpowers.
U.S. silence
The United States has stayed silent in the
public debate, but let it be known behind the
scenes that it could well vote against any
simple extension of the group's mandate.
This has forced other Western delega
tions to propose a watered-down resolution
calling for the the group's "renewal for one
more year" in accordance with recognized
practice. Many fear the Argentinians will
interpret this to insist on confidentiality.
The U.S. approach may be consistent with
the new administration's line toward sup
posed friends in Latin America, but it has
dismayed and angered human rights ac
tivists here.
A spokesman for the Interamerican Com
mission on Human Rights took the Ameri
can delegation to task for a statement here
last week that "international terrorism will
take the place of human rights" as the main
concern of the Reagan administration."
