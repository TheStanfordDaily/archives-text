# Slavic seminar calls for economic rebirth
## 
### Karen Springen 
"The Polish working class
has transformed itself from a
class in itself to a class for
itself," claimed renowned ana
lyst of Soviet affairs Seweryn
Bialer, professor of political
science and director of the Re
search Institute on Interna
tional Change at Columbia Uni
versity.
Bialer presented "Poland:
the Present Crisis" via closed
circuit television from UC-
Berkeley last Thursday. A two
way audio in Skilling
Auditorium accommodated
questions from the Stanford au
dience of about 40 people.
The lecture was the first of a
series of jointly sponsored
Slavic seminars by the centers
for Russian and East European
studies at Berkeley and Stan
ford.
Lecture topics included the
causes of the strike last August,
the reasons the workers have
"won" as of now, the possibility
of invasion by the Russians, and
domestic power and party con
flicts.
According to Bialer, a crisis
of authority, a feeling of in
justice. total bankruptcy of the
economic system, and price
rises contributed to the strikes.
Price rises were the immediate
cause, but borrowing money
from abroad instead of reform
ing also harmed the economic
system.
Structure rather than policies
caused Poland's bankruptcy, he
added.
The Poles' loss of respect for
the party government led to a
crisis of authority.
A feeling of injustice also
sparked the strike, Bialer said.
For example, workers felt a
lack of social mobility.
In addition, government has
failed to "digest" the new work
ing class. "It is no more a work

ing class that comes from the
peasantry," said Bialer.
The new working class has
"won" as of now, he said.
Crucial reasons include the suc
cessful use of sit-in strikes rath
er than violence, the discipline
ot the workers, the overall disin
tegration of authority and the
neutrality of the military.
Fear of invasion
According to Bialer, the gov
ernment and party leadership
rather than the workers fear in
vasion. He emphasized the un
known factors in forecasting the
threat of Russian invasion. "As
in all revolutionary periods, it's
almost impossible to predict
what the next events will be,"
he said "We really do not
know."
But the result of the Polish
crisis will be "one of the major

turning points in the history of
the Soviet Union itself," hesaid.
The Soviets max not tolerate
the Polish example since sur
vival might be contagious for
other parts of the Soviet empire.
The Soviets also consider the
Poles "ingrates" who forgot the
blood shed to save Poland from
the Nazis.
But the Soviets are facing
domestic problems such as
stagnation and worsening work
ing conditions. In addition, the
Russians have not entered Po
land because they know the
Poles will fight, said Bialer.
"Poles always fight when they
are invaded," he said.
"The workers have arms hid
den and waiting not for celebra
tion but for fighting," he added.
He further cited the deep na
tionalism and strong character

of the Polish people. Thirty-five
years of communist rule "did
not destroy the separate identi
ty of the Poles," he said.
Because of the country's
enormous tradition of struggle,
"the Poles are very indigestible
tor foreign invaders," he added.
Several Soviet costs of in
vasion include the end of detente
with Europe; a less benign U.S.
course; and the installation of
new U.S. missiles. (European
objections would dissolve if
Russian troops invaded Po
land.)
Three 'parties'
According to Bialer, the com
munists, the workers and the
church are three "parties"
which exist in Poland today. He
called the Solidarity movement,
which also performs the role of
a trade union, a competing par

ty-
The future of Solidarity, he
said, depends on its ability to
centralize. The working class is
fragmented now.
Bialer predicts the mod
erates will unify with the re
formists and oust the reac
tionary leadership. But despite
political differences, all parties
are tor economic reform, he
said.
Radical change is both neces
sary and impossible, said
Bialer. He cited the need for an
"economic rebirth" of Poland.
Otherwise, workers' demands
will remain on paper
"They need to incur a major
economic miracle," he said.
According to Bialer, "It's in
our interests to help Poland."
U.S. attitude should be one of
sympathy and waiting, he said.

Bialer. He cited the need for an
"economic rebirth" of Poland.
Otherwise, workers' demands
will remain on paper
"They need to incur a major
economic miracle," he said.
According to Bialer, "It's in
our interests to help Poland."
U.S. attitude should be one of
sympathy and waiting, he said.
"The Polish working class
has transformed itself from a
class in itself to a class for
itself," claimed renowned ana
lyst of Soviet affairs Seweryn
Bialer, professor of political
science and director of the Re
search Institute on Interna
tional Change at Columbia Uni
versity.
Bialer presented "Poland:
the Present Crisis" via closed
circuit television from UC-
Berkeley last Thursday. A two
way audio in Skilling
Auditorium accommodated
questions from the Stanford au
dience of about 40 people.
The lecture was the first of a
series of jointly sponsored
Slavic seminars by the centers
for Russian and East European
studies at Berkeley and Stan
ford.
Lecture topics included the
causes of the strike last August,
the reasons the workers have
"won" as of now, the possibility
of invasion by the Russians, and
domestic power and party con
flicts.
According to Bialer, a crisis
of authority, a feeling of in
justice. total bankruptcy of the
economic system, and price
rises contributed to the strikes.
Price rises were the immediate
cause, but borrowing money
from abroad instead of reform
ing also harmed the economic
system.
Structure rather than policies
caused Poland's bankruptcy, he
added.
The Poles' loss of respect for
the party government led to a
crisis of authority.
A feeling of injustice also
sparked the strike, Bialer said.
For example, workers felt a
lack of social mobility.
In addition, government has
failed to "digest" the new work
ing class. "It is no more a work

ing class that comes from the
peasantry," said Bialer.
The new working class has
"won" as of now, he said.
Crucial reasons include the suc
cessful use of sit-in strikes rath
er than violence, the discipline
ot the workers, the overall disin
tegration of authority and the
neutrality of the military.
Fear of invasion
According to Bialer, the gov
ernment and party leadership
rather than the workers fear in
vasion. He emphasized the un
known factors in forecasting the
threat of Russian invasion. "As
in all revolutionary periods, it's
almost impossible to predict
what the next events will be,"
he said "We really do not
know."
But the result of the Polish
crisis will be "one of the major

turning points in the history of
the Soviet Union itself," hesaid.
The Soviets max not tolerate
the Polish example since sur
vival might be contagious for
other parts of the Soviet empire.
The Soviets also consider the
Poles "ingrates" who forgot the
blood shed to save Poland from
the Nazis.
But the Soviets are facing
domestic problems such as
stagnation and worsening work
ing conditions. In addition, the
Russians have not entered Po
land because they know the
Poles will fight, said Bialer.
"Poles always fight when they
are invaded," he said.
"The workers have arms hid
den and waiting not for celebra
tion but for fighting," he added.
He further cited the deep na
tionalism and strong character

of the Polish people. Thirty-five
years of communist rule "did
not destroy the separate identi
ty of the Poles," he said.
Because of the country's
enormous tradition of struggle,
"the Poles are very indigestible
tor foreign invaders," he added.
Several Soviet costs of in
vasion include the end of detente
with Europe; a less benign U.S.
course; and the installation of
new U.S. missiles. (European
objections would dissolve if
Russian troops invaded Po
land.)
Three 'parties'
According to Bialer, the com
munists, the workers and the
church are three "parties"
which exist in Poland today. He
called the Solidarity movement,
which also performs the role of
a trade union, a competing par

ty-
The future of Solidarity, he
said, depends on its ability to
centralize. The working class is
fragmented now.
Bialer predicts the mod
erates will unify with the re
formists and oust the reac
tionary leadership. But despite
political differences, all parties
are tor economic reform, he
said.
Radical change is both neces
sary and impossible, said
Bialer. He cited the need for an
