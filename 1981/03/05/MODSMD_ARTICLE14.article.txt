# Co-op life offers unique experience

"Ree\clinn' s for your benefit
rind for the future generations "
Written boldly above the re
cycling bins in the Synergy din
ing room, this motto reinforces
the conservationist theme in
one of Stanford s six co-ops.
Terra, Hammarskjold, Theta
Chi and Columbae are clustered
in the area between Cowell and
Maytield Both Synergy and Phi
Psi are way up on the hill that
divides student and faculty
housing areas.
For some students the idea of
co-op living conjures up images
of granola, drugs and radical
ideas. But what really attracts
people to the co-op lifestyle goes
far beyond the stereotype.
Co-op residents are enjoying
an opportunity to experience an
alternative lifestyle, and are se
rious about making it work
While cutting a slice of home
made bread in the spacious
Synergy kitchen, Stephen Saxe
nian, a resident there, ex
plained: "Other people think

that Synergy is weird, ex
tremist, radical But living in
Synergy "gives you a chance to
grow and take on responsi
bilities," he said
As in all the co-ops. Synergy 's
43 residents share the responsi
bilities of cooking, cleaning,
managing finances and endless
other tasks required in the run
ning of a large house.
According to Monica Menco,
a resident associate < RA i of Phi
Psi on San Juan St., co-op living
is "a unique experience," and a
lifestyle "where you share and
work with people."
Phi Psi's 40 residents, as in
most of the co-ops, use a "work
wheel" system. Each resident's
name is written outside the
wheel containing the various job
assignments, and the wheel ro
tates weekly. One week a stu
dent might vacuum the hall and
the next scrub the toilets.
Each house uses a slightly dif
ferent system for assigning
work duties, but there seem to
be no major problems in getting

people to do their assigned jobs.
Connie Wolt R A in Theta Chi on
Alvarado Row. said there is a
system of checks and balances
where residents confront some
one who has skipped his or her
job.
Residents join forces to cook
dinner (also a rotating job)
from five to six nights weekly.
After the meal, a clean-up crew
goes to work And during the
week, other residents are as
signed to make "extras" such
as granola. bread and yogurt.
No residents are excused
from these responsibilities, and
all the co-ops try to stay clear of
ranks and hierarchies.
"The house is a team of peo
ple. In a co-op you're a house
member as well as an RA. My
role is as a liaison with the Uni
versity," Wolt said.
Because there is no maid or
food service, the cost of living in
a co-op can be as low as about
$550 for room and board for a
Quarter That is about $250 less
than the cost in a university
dormitory.
All six co-op houses were
fraternities in the past Theta
Chi, one of the six. is independ
ent from the university because
five of its 27 residents are
fraternity members. The other
co-ops are owned by the univer
sity, taken over when the
fraternities moved. Students
who were interested in coopera
tive living petitioned for hous
ing. and the former fraternity
houses became co-ops. Most
have been co-ops for five to 10
years
Some co-ops were established
with particular house themes in
mind, such as Synergy's con
servationist ethic. In keeping
with the house theme. Synergy
now has a large vegetable
garden, a compost heap and a
chicken coop. The house is also
only partially heated. Both Col
umbae and Synergy are entirely
vegetarian, and the other co-ops
usually serve a meatless alter
native with the main dish.

Fifty percent of Hammarsk
jold's 26 residents are foreign
students, and the co-op has an
"international ' theme Accord
ing to Nancy Hart. RA in Ham
marskjold. an important part of
the success of the theme is that
the house is a co-op. "So much of
it (the theme I is personal in
teraction," Hart said.
Non-violence is the theme at
Columbae. The house originated
as a reaction to the violent pro
tests against the Vietnam war
ten years ago To ensure a lack
of hierarchy or ranking in this
co-op. Columbae makes every
house member a manager ot
something, ranging from the
compost heap to mail distribu
tion
"The fact that it is a co-op de
fines day-to-day living," Nick
Burbules. RA at Terra, located
in the Cowell cluster, said He
added that "the co-op defines
the pattern of other interac
tions. People are always talking
in the kitchen while they cook or
eat lunch, and there's lots ot
talk about the running of the
house." For Terra. Burbules
said, "the theme is increasingly
one of being a co-op."
Though Theta Chi has no es
tablished theme, residents like
their relative independence
from the university.
"The people in the co-op run
the house, as opposed to having
outsiders tell us how to run
things," Miguel Perez, Theta
Chi resident, said.
Complaints of problems in the
co-ops or disadvantages to the
lifestyle were few. Several RAs
feared the possible formation of
cliques in the house which, they
said, would hurt the family at
mosphere most feel is so impor
tant in the co-ops.
One Terra resident who was
assigned mid-vear after return
ing from overseas complained:
"I don't like to scrub anyone's
toilet ... I want butter instead
of margarine, and Oreos instead
ot granola."
