## Editorial Link rent hikes, new housing 
### 
Last quarter, the University announced
its proposed tuition and rent increases for
the next academic year. Along with a gen
eral tuition hike of 12.2 percent, the Uni
versity announced that it would increase
room and rent charges for University
owned housing by some 14 or 15 percent
In addition to the usual litany of rising
costs, the administration attributed the
rent increases to expenses associated with
the new 800-unit dormitory to be built near
Lake Lagunita.
This action raised opposition from many
residents of Escondido Village, who felt it
was inequitable for the University to raise
Escondido rents to pay for undergraduate
housing. While they said they were willing
to help pay for the new dorm with their
rent hikes, they rightly asked the Univer
sity to make a commitment to new. per
manent graduate student housing.
The University plans to move graduate
students into Manzanita Park, while un
dergraduates move into the new dorm.
But this is an inadequate, stopgap solu
tion. The trailers, erected in 1969 to last
five years, could last another decade, but
cannot take the place of real buildings. At
issue is not the deteriorating condition of
Manzanita Park, but the University's

long-term policy on housing graduate stu
dents.
In discussing new graduate housing with
the Daily. Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons mentioned various alternatives.
The University is considering setting
aside part of the proposed 46-acre Willow
Road development for graduate students,
softening the boundaries that now exclude
most graduate students from under
graduate residences, and expanding
Escondido Village off Bowdoin Street
He also suggested that graduate stu
dents be accommodated in the new dorm
â€” a major stride toward integrating un
dergraduates with graduate students.
This is a proposal the Daily strongly sup
ports. It could enhance the residential
education experience for both groups, and
would allow graduate students to share
the benefits of new housing sooner than
any of the other proposals.
It must be a high priority for the Univer
sity to examine these options, especially
providing room for graduate students in
the new dorm, and formulate specific pro
posals. Only if real steps are taken to al
leviate the graduate student housing
crunch will the rent hikes be justifiable.
