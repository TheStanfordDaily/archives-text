## No hot tubs? Something is missing here 
### 
I have been in California for
about six months, and I want to
go home.
This is a nice place, with nice
people, nice scenery and nice
recreational opportunities, but
something is missing.
I have to admit that the im
ages I had ot California before I
came to Stanford were a little
unrealistic, garnered as they
were trom Beach Boys' album
covers, television news cov
erage of Berkeley riots (I have
since realized that Berkeley is a
country unto itself which would
cause no more problems if its in
habitants were not allowed to
emigrate), and movies such as
The (iraduate and Annie Hall.
While driving out here along
the interminable Mid-western
s\reVc\ie4 ot RouVe WW, \ had
plenty ot time to further develop
my fantasies concerning Cali
fornia in general and Palo Alto
in particular. I imagined a
mellow university town in
which blond men and women < or
men and men, or women and
women, or various other com
binations and permutations
thereof) sat in redwood hot tubs
discussing Carlos Castaneda
and the theory of general rela
tivity in the same breath; on the
tray beside the tub is a plate (re
cyclable paper, of course) of
raw bean sprouts, avocadoes,
and hallucinogenic drugs; tresh
out of the adobe oven is a dish of
hash brownies and computer
microchips; through the balmy
air drift the sounds ot sitar mu
sic from the solar powered ster
eo and the smoke from burning
incense somewhat akin to that
which inspired Coleridge to
dream up Xanadu.
As I said, slightly unrealistic,
but when one drives one's car
through four hundred miles of
cornfields at a stretch, one's
mind tends to wax imaginative,

it not downright delirious.
Upon finally reaching Palo
Alto my fears (and hopes) that I
would be entering a thoroughly
hedonistic society were some
what diminished by the sight ot
a McDonald's as garishly col
ored as any tast-food joint oft
the Jersey Turnpike. Rapid ad
justments to other significant
cultural changes, such as radio
stations with "K" tor a prefix to
their callsign. and Monday
Night Football at 6 instead of 9
p.m. were not to difticult to
meet. I soon learned to interpret
Mellow-speak (the native
dialect).
In fact, the only real jolt was
the discovery that the local real
estate prices irere being ex
pressed in U.S. dollars. I had
vmVuraWy asaumed XhaV the \vÂ»U\-
crously high rental rates were
for some local currency worth
about 40 percent of an Eastern
dollar.
I have finally become reason
ably adjusted (read: "found my
space'') to California. but some
thing is still missing.
It's very hard to be healthily
depressed here. Yes. it rains
now and then, and there are aca
demic pressures But there is no
winter wind to whistle wildly
through bare oak branches with
sifted snow drifting softly into
the ice-torn river as you stand
on the shore, hands deep in over
coat pockets, heart torn with
pain yet soul filled with the
cathartic solace of existential
despair.
See what I mean? It is dif
ficult to attain a state ot existen
tial despair when wearing an or
ange sleeveless down jacket, es
pecially when you can drive to
LA or Tahoe for the weekend.
The West Coast seems to be in
a condition of permanent tran
sience and fixed instability. Ev
erything is too easy here. There

is a lot of style but not enough
substance.
The difference between the
East Coast and the West Coast is
the difference between Thomas
Wolfe and Tom Wolfe; between
Bruce Springsteen and Boz
Scaggs. I.i>nk Homeward Angel
could not have been set in the
Silicon Valley, nor could "Born
to Run'' have been written
about Sunnyvale.

I do enjoy living here, but I
still feel that I am just visiting.
There is a greater gulf between
the East and West than the three
thousand miles of distance and
the three hours of time.
It's been real nice, but I want
to go home.
