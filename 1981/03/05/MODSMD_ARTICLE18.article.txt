## Becoming a princess takes years and years 
### 
I watched the silver Camaro
roll through the stop sign The
elbow patch ot an expensive
tweed jacket protruded out of
the window and I caught a glint
of light reflected off the Vaurnet
sunglasses perched on the
driver's perfectly proportioned
nose. "There goes another su
preme J.A.P.," I commented to
my friend
"A what?" my friend asked
"A J.A.P.," I repeated, as
suming the statement needed no
further elaboration, especially
in this particular instance.
My Midwestern friend, ex
claimed. "But she wasn't
Japanese."
I looked at her incredulously,
amazed that anyone could be
that clueless. "J A P. stands for
Jewish American Princess. I
replied, and told my friend I'd
explain it some other time.
As it turns out. many Stanford
students have no idea what a
Jewish American Princess is,
so I figured it was my duty as an
expert (after all. it takes one to
know one) to enlighten the
masses by explaining the origin
ot these creatures.
First of all. one does not have
to be Jewish to be a princess
(but it helps). All one needs is
the proper set ot parents â€” a
mother dedicated to raising a
JAP. (usually 2nd or 3rd gener
ation ) and a father with money.
The training process begins
soon after birth, although the in
fant princess does not differ sig
nificantly from the average

baby It is true that her toddler
outfits are all from Saks, as are
her Steiff stuffed animals and
designer crib sheets. However,
the real initiation begins around
age four
The first of numerous sum
mers spent at day camp begins
Each morning the child is sent
to frolic with other P.I.T.s
(princess-in-training), as Mom
makes sure she associates with
members ot her species. The
child returns to this camp year
after year, until she is too old. at
which time she is sent to sleep
away-camp. "Y" camps, ot
course, are not acceptable. Only
expensive camps with private
lakes, counselors from Ivy
League schools, and excellent
horseback riding, tennis and
sailing facilities are proper tor
maturing P.I.T.s.
When camp concludes, her
mother informs her as to which
lessons she will be taking. One
type is not sufficient, the very
young princess must engage in a
variety of lessons. Dancing
(either modern or ballet), gym
nastics, piano, horseback riding
and tennis are the most common
after-school pursuits. A mas
tery of tennis is extremely de
sirable, as the adult princess
will be called upon to play at
"The Club"; piano lessons, for
some inexplicable reason, are
seen as providing culture. The
princess also goes sailing and
skiing, but these less utilitarian
activities are reserved for vaca
tions (in the Caribbean or Aspen
respectively).
The PIT. proceeds in this
manner for a few years, spend
ing summers at camp and
school years obtaining a variety
ot skills. Along the way she gets
her ears pierced and begins ac
quiring a collection of gold that
will, in time, rival the treasur
ies of some Third World coun
tries. But for the time being the
young princess merely uses the
gold for identification. This con
sists of having her first initial,
or, for the less subtle P.I.T , her
entire first name dangling from
a gold chain.
Clad in boys' Lacoste and

Polo shirts, she receives her
first token of official princess
status For her thirteenth birth
day Daddy (it was Mom's idea)
presents her with her very own
phone, with her very own
number Needless to say. it's a
"Princess Phone." named by
Ma Bell in honor of just such a
client.
After junior high and through
out high school the budding
J.A.P. (no longer a P I T ) be
gins amassing a wardrobe and
continues purchasing large
amounts ot gold jewelry. Vaca
tions are spent visiting Grand
ma at her condominium in Mi
ami. The lookout for eligible
men is initiated The dates with
family friends aren't that fun,
but the princess finds getting
the boys to really like her and
then ignoring them to be kind of
exciting
The ones that buy her pres
ents are the ones that Mom real
ly likes, and her mother says
that in a tew years she will ap
preciate them more. By the
time she is sixteen, she has well
learned the value of money.
Mom's credit cards become in
dispensable and many hours are
spent in the Junior departments
ot Saks. Bloomingdale's (East
Coast) and Magnin's (West
Coast). Daddy plays his part,
and supplies the princess with
diamond earrings for her six
teenth birthday. Around this
stage, the fashion conscious
teenager becomes extremely
concerned with her physical ap
pearance. She blowdries her
hair every morning, does her
nails (both finger and toe) in
matching shades of red, and ap
plies the Clinique makeup each
morning, but she still doesn't
feel quite attractive enough to
entice the really desirable
young men.
Somewhere around this time
her mother convinces her father
that his daughter's nose needs to
get fixed. All young princesses
must have a nose job, as Mom
says that men only like tiny but
ton noses. Her tennis game dete
riorates, as she is under instruc
tions trom her plastic surgeon
not to let any moving object, un
der any circumstances, near
her face. However, it is a small
price to pay. as the new nose
gets good results on the real
field.
This sixteenth summer the
princess finally becomes too old
for camp, and receives her cul
tural enlightenment spending

the summer travelling abroad.
After traipsing around Europe
she returns lor the remainder of
high school. At seventeen Mom
informs Daddy that their daugh
ter needs a car. as once she has
her license she will need to drive
herself to Saks and"The Club."
The official princess cars are
Camaros, Firebirds, and Trans
Ams (BMW's are the prin
cesses' cars of the new gener
ation!. The princess is present
ed with the keys to one of these
mobiles on her birthday. If a
particular princess has been
somewhat difficult to identify,
her car (complete with cassette
deck and stereo, as the princess
deserves nothing but the best)
broadcasts her JAPness.
The car is invaluable to the
princess as it not only allows her
to shop without her mother (but
still with the credit cards in
Daddy's name), but enables her
to drive down the shore (to the
beach tor the California breed)
during the summer. Going down
the shore serves two functions.
It makes her tanned and it gives
her hair highlights, as designer
sunglasses worn on top of her
head look much better against
blonde streaks.
She uses her charm and tan
(maintained over the long win
ter by going to the Caribbean
over Christmas break) to se
cure the best-looking guy for the
senior prom. The princess fin
ished her high-school education
and Daddy sends her on a cruise
to commend her.
This cruise marks not only the
high-school graduation, but the
completion of the princess'
training program. Her parents
portion is completed and it is up
to the princess herself to main
tain her image. For the first
time the princess will be on her
own. partially (Daddy can't to
tally abandon her) separated
from the steady cash flow.
When she gets to college, it
will be up to her to find a man to
take her father's place. In
search ot her prince charming
she cruises the streeets of col
lege campuses. Thus we see her,
the Jewish American Princess,
trained trom birth tor her quest,
as she propels her silver
Camaro through the intersec
tion.
