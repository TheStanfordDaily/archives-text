## Kennedy letter coercive 
### 
The editorial on President
Kennedy's letter (Daily, Feb.
25) was quite an eye-opener. It
\iaO never occurred to me before
to give brownie points for can
dor to a management that op
poses unionization. I shall make
silent amends to J. P. Stevens,
as forthright an organization as
you can find, and to Gallo which
made no bones for years about
thwarting a union to end the ex
ploitation of its farmworkers.
I was a little surprised,
though, that "candor" was the
word you should have chosen.
When a selt-avowed "lifelong
Democrat" — that is. a sup
porter ot the party that has trad
itionally been on the side of la
bor and collective bargaining —
makes an about-face when it
comes to the institution which
he heads, "candor" is not the
word that comes uppermost to
my mind.
Actually, candor in the work
place is a luxury not freely
available to everyone, even
though Stanford's promulgated
policy reads "Because the right
of free speech ... (is) fun
damental to the democratic
process, Stanford firmly sup
ports the rights of all members
of the University community to
express their views or to protest
against actions and opinions
with which they disagree." In
deed, you may get up in White
Plaza and call the President of
the United States incompetent,
lazy and repressive, his policies
benighted, born of stupidity and
ignorance, and nothing will hap
pen to you.
But just try the same thing on
your boss. No matter how richly
applicable and deserved such
comments, nor how delicately
paraphrased, the measure of
your freedom of speech and
Stanford's firm support thereof,
may not be long in coming.
Should you last to the advent of
the next fiscal year, your salary
might no longer, if it ever did,
reflect your talents or years of
faithful service. Comes the time
for promotion, the rank or job
your qualifications would seem
to put you in line for is apt to go
to someone less insistent upon
the exercise of constitutional
rights.
In some areas of the Univer
sity, criticism of one's superiors
can lead to instant departmen
tal reorganization, whereby the
position of the critic is phased
out — together with the critic —
only to be reinstituted when the
coast is clear.
Since most people don't work
merely to relieve the tedium of
clipping coupons, such econom
ic reprisal is a mighty deterrent
to the exercise of candor, no
matter how tempting or how

badly needed it may be in some
quarters. I doubt that was a haz
ard Kennedy had to contend
with.
I am surprised that the Daily
was not more sensitive to the
tenor of Kennedy's letter. A lot
of people on the work force
were. It's patronizing "we will
do what's good for you" tone
struck a raw nerve in many men
and, of course, women, tradi
tionally the chief objects of this
attitude.
Seventeen years after the
passage of the Civil Rights Act,
Stanford, like most universities,
is still a bastion of sexism and
racism Count the number of
women and minorities in posi
tions of real power. Where you
do find them, they are, over
whelmingly and through no ac
cident, so like their male white
counterparts in attitude and ac
tion that they are significant
chiefly tor statistical purposes.
While women at Stanford are
struggling to achieve at long
last some recognition of their
worth, we still have an en
trenched regimen of men who
administer by what might best
be termed the divine right of
kings. There is often little other
visible justification for the lofty
positions they hold and the very
hefty salaries they pull down.
A prime example of the very
unequal distribution of merit,
and reward — and sex and
power — is the Libraries, which
include several hundred em
ployees. Of their eleven direc
tors (including those of the
graduate schools, Hoover and
SLAC), ten are men. The pre
dominant femaleness of the pro
fession is reflected only in the
two lowest ranks of librarians,
of whom 76 percent are women.
Hierarchically below the li
brarians are the clerical sup
port staff, the vast majority of
whom are women Many of
them have advanced degrees,
extensive subject and linguistic
expertise, and perform techni
cal work of a complex nature
with impressive competence
and unimpressive pay.
Last year, when a reclass
ification was imposed on them
that struck them as unfair, over
forty of them got together and
signed a protest, published in
Campus Report. The adminis
tration never even sent them a
response. You don't have to be
Norma Rae to figure out why
they might want to form a
union.
Perhaps the saddest part of
the Daily's editorial was that
even the holders of the minority
position refused to come to
grips with the question of peo
ple's right to organize. For
thousands of people this is

where they make their living,
and how they can deal effective
ly with problems of equity and
justice in their workplace
should be of concern to students
too. And given the candor of the
administration, the office staff
can use all the support that it
can get.
