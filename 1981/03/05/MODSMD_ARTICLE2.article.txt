# U.S. embassy in San Salvador fired upon
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
San Salvador — The U.S. Embassy
was sprayed with bullets yesterday
morning in an incident that acting Am
bassador Frederic Chapin said had
"all the hallmarks" of right-wing ter
rorism directed by Salvadoran ex-
Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson.
There were no injuries and minimal
damage but as public (ears of a right
ist coup attempt mounted, Chapin
used the occasion to make his first un
equivocal public statement of support
for the current coalition government
headed by Christian Democrat Jose
Napoleon Duarte.
Duarte, meanwhile, ruled out a trip
to Europe to meet with leftist leaders,
welcomed promises of U.S. military
as well as economic aid, and declared
that the government sought the arrest
of d'Aubuisson.
"The people on the extreme right
are always there trying to pull a coup
d'etat — permanently — and we are
fighting against them," he said. Reac
ting to criticisms Tuesday by
d'Aubuisson, Duarte added, "If we
can find him, we will arrest him" for
incitement to a coup.
The president denied d'Aubuisson's
charge that the Christian Democrats,
whom he had called the right wing of
the Communist Party, would sell out
the country to the communists.
D'Aubuisson also said he believed the
Reagan administration would "fa
vor" the ouster of the Christian Demo
crats.
No report
Meanwhile, Secretary of State
Alexander Haig yesterday denied
vehemently that the Reagan adminis
tration would support a right-wing
military coup in El Salvador, and
warned that such a move could have
serious consequences for continued
U.S. support of the government there.
Haig's comments were part of a
strong and concerted administration
effort to deny statements made Tues
day in El Salvador by D'Aubisson, who
said his contacts with Reagan admin
istration officials had convinced him
that they would not object to a coup.
After a foreign policy briefing for
the Senate, Haig told reporters:
"I want to emphasize that this does
not represent U.S. policy in any way.

It is counter to the policy we have been
implementing and pursuing in El
Salvador, and such an outcome would
have serious consequences for our
ability to continue to pursue those poli
cies."
Among Reagan administration of
ficials with whom D'Aubisson said he
had unspecified meetings was Roger
Fontaine, now Latin \morioan affairs
specialist on the National Security
Council staff.
Pure fiction
At the White House, press secretary
James Brady said, "Roger Fontaine
has authorized us to say the
statements made by the major re
garding his views on the Salvadoran
government are pure fiction. He said
that he never stated or implied any
thing of the sort to anyone, anywhere,
at any time, categorically denying the
major's claim."
Yet another denial came from State
Department spokesman William
Dyess, who said, "There is nothing the
president has said, the secretary of
state has said, publicly or privately, or
any official of this government has
said that would warrant reaching that
(D'Aubisson's) conclusion."
Dyess did raise eyebrows among re
porters at the State Department daily
briefing when he refused to reply
directly to questions about whether
the United States would oppose a coup.
While saying that the United States is
opposed in principle to military
takeovers, he insisted that his answer
should not be applied to "any particu
lar situation."
The administration has become in
creasingly sensitive to suggestions
that it views the Salvadoran civil war
primarily in terms of the East-West
conflict and that its zeal in combating
communist-bloc support -for
Salvadoran leftist insurgents is
greater than its concern about the ex
cesses of the extreme rightist factions
in that conflict.
Reforms supported
During recent days, the adminis
tration has increased significantly its
efforts to assure Congress, the Ameri
can public and foreign governments
that it supports democratic reform in
El Salvador.

San Salvador — The U.S. Embassy
was sprayed with bullets yesterday
morning in an incident that acting Am
bassador Frederic Chapin said had
"all the hallmarks" of right-wing ter
rorism directed by Salvadoran ex-
Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson.
There were no injuries and minimal
damage but as public (ears of a right
ist coup attempt mounted, Chapin
used the occasion to make his first un
equivocal public statement of support
for the current coalition government
headed by Christian Democrat Jose
Napoleon Duarte.
Duarte, meanwhile, ruled out a trip
to Europe to meet with leftist leaders,
welcomed promises of U.S. military
as well as economic aid, and declared
that the government sought the arrest
of d'Aubuisson.
"The people on the extreme right
are always there trying to pull a coup
d'etat — permanently — and we are
fighting against them," he said. Reac
ting to criticisms Tuesday by
d'Aubuisson, Duarte added, "If we
can find him, we will arrest him" for
incitement to a coup.
The president denied d'Aubuisson's
charge that the Christian Democrats,
whom he had called the right wing of
the Communist Party, would sell out
the country to the communists.
D'Aubuisson also said he believed the
Reagan administration would "fa
vor" the ouster of the Christian Demo
crats.
No report
Meanwhile, Secretary of State
Alexander Haig yesterday denied
vehemently that the Reagan adminis
tration would support a right-wing
military coup in El Salvador, and
warned that such a move could have
serious consequences for continued
U.S. support of the government there.
Haig's comments were part of a
strong and concerted administration
effort to deny statements made Tues
day in El Salvador by D'Aubisson, who
said his contacts with Reagan admin
istration officials had convinced him
that they would not object to a coup.
After a foreign policy briefing for
the Senate, Haig told reporters:
"I want to emphasize that this does
not represent U.S. policy in any way.

It is counter to the policy we have been
implementing and pursuing in El
Salvador, and such an outcome would
have serious consequences for our
ability to continue to pursue those poli
cies."
Among Reagan administration of
ficials with whom D'Aubisson said he
had unspecified meetings was Roger
Fontaine, now Latin \morioan affairs
specialist on the National Security
Council staff.
Pure fiction
At the White House, press secretary
James Brady said, "Roger Fontaine
has authorized us to say the
statements made by the major re
garding his views on the Salvadoran
government are pure fiction. He said
that he never stated or implied any
thing of the sort to anyone, anywhere,
at any time, categorically denying the
major's claim."
Yet another denial came from State
Department spokesman William
Dyess, who said, "There is nothing the
president has said, the secretary of
state has said, publicly or privately, or
any official of this government has
said that would warrant reaching that
(D'Aubisson's) conclusion."
Dyess did raise eyebrows among re
porters at the State Department daily
briefing when he refused to reply
directly to questions about whether
the United States would oppose a coup.
While saying that the United States is
opposed in principle to military
takeovers, he insisted that his answer
should not be applied to "any particu
lar situation."
The administration has become in
creasingly sensitive to suggestions
that it views the Salvadoran civil war
primarily in terms of the East-West
conflict and that its zeal in combating
communist-bloc support -for
Salvadoran leftist insurgents is
greater than its concern about the ex
cesses of the extreme rightist factions
in that conflict.
Reforms supported
During recent days, the adminis
tration has increased significantly its
efforts to assure Congress, the Ameri
can public and foreign governments
that it supports democratic reform in
El Salvador.
