Reagan sacrifice
It seems terribly inconsistent
to me that the Reagan adminis
tration sees fit to promote, on
the domestic level, a policy of
individual sacrifice for the gen
eral welfare while blindly
disregarding world welfare if it
is in American or Western in
terests to do so.
How can Reagan on the one
hand call for special interest
groups at home to tighten their
belts and accept individual
budget cuts for the good of the
people as a whole, while choos
ing to ignore violations of fun
damental human rights abroad
if it serves America's purposes?
If one truly holds a humanistic
philosophy, one does not feel
free to pursue self-seeking in
terests at the expense of others
just because a territorial bound
ary has been crossed.
A policy of collective self-sac
rifice for the common good is a
noble one, and politically
courageous as well. But why
forsake this insightful thinking
when the issues are of interna
tional scope? Indeed,the bigger
the problem, the greater the
need for broad-minded reason
ing as opposed to egocentric am
bition.
We may like to think of our
president as a world leader, but
on the global scale, I'm afraid
we have to admit he is proving
himself to be merely another
stick-waving lobbyist throwing
his weight around for the sake of
yet another of the multitude of
noisy special interest groups.

We had our annual Mardi
Gras party a couple of weekends
ago, at one of the Row houses,
and a number of rather un
precedented things happened.
First, a light organ — a large
white globe with colored lights
one of us made — disappeared
from our living room. Next, a
fellow drove his motorcycle up
the steps, through the front
door, and parked it in the living
room where people were danc
ing. After that, one of our cars
was stolen We discovered one

of our kegs was gone. too. That's
not much fun at all.
We would appreciate if the
people who took the stuff kindly
return it, that's all. We don't
know why you picked our house.
People planning parties should
perhaps be extra careful tor a
while.

Don't malign Miami
I realize that Michael Weiss'
"Prestige" article (Daily, Feb.
27) was written with tongue in
cheek, but I feel obliged to com
ment on one small aspect of it
which I know about (and Weiss
apparently doesn't!).
The University of Miami in
Florida was my undergraduate
alma mater, and I hate to see it
maligned unnecessarily. More
importantly (as any of you could
understand), I am very upset to
see it put in the same category
as USC. Just because Miami is
warm and sunny don't assume
that a school situated there will
be academically inferior, or
that a school in a cold climate
will be superior.
Miami has excellent pro
grams in business, law, and
medicine all of which are highly
ranked nationally. The Marine
Sciences School at Miami is one
of the top five in the country,
ranked just after Scripps and
Woods Hole in stature. The De
partment of Geology is one of a
few in the country to allow
(much less encourage) basic re
search in such advanced earth
science fields as isotopic
geochronology and isotopic
paleotemperatures at the un
dergraduate level.
In other words, the Univer
sity of Miami is no slouch aca
demically, even without such
high-powered courses as Stan
ford's Frisbee 04, Modern Phys
ics through Science Fiction, and
Population Biology of the But
terflies. And by the way, the
comment "surf's up" would get
a laugh, if any reaction at all
from a Miami student since
waves average less than a foot
in height year round (surfing
isn't really bin in southern Flor
ida. you see).
Enough of this, you've wasted
enough of my precious time

here at Stanford - I've got' a lot of
studying to do for my Advanced
Badminton final!

Union a 'tool'
John Grant's point is well
taken (Daily, Feb. 20), but his
conclusions are not necessarily
true. Unions are a form of par
ticipatory democracy, and the
key word is participatory,
which means the members
must participate. Unions are as
active and as honest as their
members.
Currently there is a deep
wellspring of clerical discontent
on this campus, and the union
movement is just one of the
more obvious and constructive
symptoms. Unionization is by
no means the be-all and end-all
of the problems clerical work
ers have with the University.
Even with higher wages (more
in line with the surrounding
communities) and a clearly de
fined, impartial grievance sys
tem within which to convey our
problems, we will still have to
contend with heavy workloads
and the condescending attitude
of the Administration and facul
ty-
The union will give us a tool
with which to dig away at the
deep-rooted foundations of prej
udice against working women.
It's a reasonable alternative to
the not-so-benevolent tyranny
we labor under now.

Don't malign Miami
I realize that Michael Weiss'
"Prestige" article (Daily, Feb.
27) was written with tongue in
cheek, but I feel obliged to com
ment on one small aspect of it
which I know about (and Weiss
apparently doesn't!).
The University of Miami in
Florida was my undergraduate
alma mater, and I hate to see it
maligned unnecessarily. More
importantly (as any of you could
understand), I am very upset to
see it put in the same category
as USC. Just because Miami is
warm and sunny don't assume
that a school situated there will
be academically inferior, or
that a school in a cold climate
will be superior.
Miami has excellent pro
grams in business, law, and
medicine all of which are highly
ranked nationally. The Marine
Sciences School at Miami is one
of the top five in the country,
ranked just after Scripps and
Woods Hole in stature. The De
partment of Geology is one of a
few in the country to allow
(much less encourage) basic re
search in such advanced earth
science fields as isotopic
geochronology and isotopic
paleotemperatures at the un
dergraduate level.
In other words, the Univer
sity of Miami is no slouch aca
demically, even without such
high-powered courses as Stan
ford's Frisbee 04, Modern Phys
ics through Science Fiction, and
Population Biology of the But
terflies. And by the way, the
comment "surf's up" would get
a laugh, if any reaction at all
from a Miami student since
waves average less than a foot
in height year round (surfing
isn't really bin in southern Flor
ida. you see).
Enough of this, you've wasted
enough of my precious time

here at Stanford - I've got' a lot of
studying to do for my Advanced
Badminton final!

Union a 'tool'
John Grant's point is well
taken (Daily, Feb. 20), but his
conclusions are not necessarily
true. Unions are a form of par
ticipatory democracy, and the
key word is participatory,
which means the members
must participate. Unions are as
active and as honest as their
members.
Currently there is a deep
wellspring of clerical discontent
on this campus, and the union
movement is just one of the
more obvious and constructive
symptoms. Unionization is by
no means the be-all and end-all
of the problems clerical work
ers have with the University.
Even with higher wages (more
in line with the surrounding
communities) and a clearly de
fined, impartial grievance sys
tem within which to convey our
problems, we will still have to
contend with heavy workloads
and the condescending attitude
of the Administration and facul
ty-
The union will give us a tool
with which to dig away at the
deep-rooted foundations of prej
udice against working women.
It's a reasonable alternative to
the not-so-benevolent tyranny
we labor under now.

Reagan sacrifice
It seems terribly inconsistent
to me that the Reagan adminis
tration sees fit to promote, on
the domestic level, a policy of
individual sacrifice for the gen
eral welfare while blindly
disregarding world welfare if it
is in American or Western in
terests to do so.
How can Reagan on the one
hand call for special interest
groups at home to tighten their
belts and accept individual
budget cuts for the good of the
people as a whole, while choos
ing to ignore violations of fun
damental human rights abroad
if it serves America's purposes?
If one truly holds a humanistic
philosophy, one does not feel
free to pursue self-seeking in
terests at the expense of others
just because a territorial bound
ary has been crossed.
A policy of collective self-sac
rifice for the common good is a
noble one, and politically
courageous as well. But why
forsake this insightful thinking
when the issues are of interna
tional scope? Indeed,the bigger
the problem, the greater the
need for broad-minded reason
ing as opposed to egocentric am
bition.
We may like to think of our
president as a world leader, but
on the global scale, I'm afraid
we have to admit he is proving
himself to be merely another
stick-waving lobbyist throwing
his weight around for the sake of
yet another of the multitude of
noisy special interest groups.
