## New Styx more than just singles 
### David Schmelzer 
Finally a commercially suc
cessful pop-rock band has taken
a chance and made an album,
rather than just a collection of
singles. This is as exciting as it
is commendable. Styx's Dennis
DeYoung began with an idea of
an album centered around the
life and destruction of a sup
posedly immortal theatre in
Chicago; his group ended up
creating a two-act musical that
comments on the changing
moods and aspirations of Amer
ican society between 1928 and
1958.
The album-as-play structure
is initially established by their
expert packaging. The front and
back jacket covers provide a
quick summation ot the plot,
and it opens up to reveal a mar
quis showing the "players'" and
some background information
— the record itself serves as a
playbill, listing the songs of
each "act'' and their com
posers. The structure of the
"play"' is such that it even in
cludes an overture and a finale;
the plot consists of a gradual,
abstract study ot the American
Dream
The pivotal metaphor of this
loose development centers
around the name ot the theatre,
the Paradise — a dream of an
idealistic people. The play's ov
erture reflects the perceived op
timism of 1928 when the theatre

was opened with the belief that
it would surely last forever.
"Tonight's the night we'll make
history as sure as dogs can fly,"
the group proclaims just before
ripping into a rallying call tor
the country's maligned youth.
They cry that with unity they
can triumph over both Para
dises.
But then the Depression
comes. Optimism is dampened
as these young men with ability
find no outlet for their contribu
tion ; those who do make it, even
in something as exciting as rock
music, find only loneliness. The
first act closes with an acknowl
edgement that things are look
ing bad, but also with a plea for
two lovers to stick it out togeth
er until better times come.
Act (and side) two begins in a
rainstorm as a person is denied
shelter. The theatre is being
torn down and the narrator de
spairs about both its destruction
and his lonely existence. ("Oh
my God, well, we both are emp
ty. Paradise and me.")
But then Styx presents a dif
ferent view. Here a woman per
sists in caring for a man who has
failed both as a soldier and as a
companion. But this briet
glimpse of hope is dashed by the
last two lull numbers, as the vi
sions ot Paradise are called a
trick and nothing more. The
American Way. rather than a
path to Paradise, is now seen as

a corrupt system run by those
with wealth.
Their closing reprise, how
ever, suggests that the dream
will exist as long as memories ot
it are kept alive. A brief piano
rag cements the value of re
membering the better times.
Even more impressive than
the album's concept is that, de
spite its constraint. Styx still
has made some terrific music.
Not just one but three songs
here are as good as any they've
done before.
Their celebration of Ameri
ca's youth. Rockin the Para
dise," is the best opening
number they've ever done —
better even than their last three
openers. "The Grand Illusion,"
"The Great White Hope," and
"Lights," which were all good.
"Paradise" is also a happier
rocker than they've done
before. In recognition of the
times they're discussing,
DeYoung, Tommy Shaw, and
James Young have written a
goodtime number that adds a
more up-beat tempo and some
old-fashioned jamming piano
music to their usual contingent
ot pedal-steel guitars.
Shaw has written his finest
song here as well, which, again,
is high praise considering his
earlier "Fooling Yourself."
"Sing For the Day,"and "Rene
gade."' "She Cares," the op

timistic number ot the second
act. is not typical Styx music.
When was the last time they
used an acoustic guitar,
castanets, and a saxaphone. as
well as a bouncy "woh woh
woh" chorus?
But the album's masterpiece
is its theme song, which com
prises the overture, the reprise,
and the last number of side one
"The Best ot Times" as an
isolated unit is a beautiful song
about lovers staying together
through difficult times; as a
part ot a whole, it serves as a
portrait of optimistic theatre
operators, ot the times, and of
the lovers, it also serves as a
skillfully structured close to an
act.
The other songs, while not in a
league with this trio, still will
not disappoint: indeed, those
Styx tans that most enjoy their
harder style might like these
numbers more. On "Too Much
TimeOn My Hands," Shaw even
dabbles in new wave.
Styx will be appearing at the
Cow Palace next Monday night
on their promotional tour tor
this album. If they put as much
imagination into the concert as
they did into the record, it will
be an event worth seeing. Para
dise Theatre may well live up to
the headline that the building
for which it was named could
not: "Not for Today — But tor
All Time."


Murphy's Lawyers will be playing at Encina Station from 9:30 to 12:30 tomorrow evening. They are, from left to right:
DaveCremin, Barry Greenhut, Martin Chenovert, Ted Jardetzky, Doug Hansen, Cran Cowen, Malcolm Bertoni and Dave
Schneider.
