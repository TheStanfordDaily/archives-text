# Muffins not unlike review
## 
### Bruce Handy 
With a modification in the
Muffins, and missing one of the
original two Marthas, Martha
and the Muffins managed to
move the crowd at the Keystone
Palo Alto last Friday night
without having to resort to the
overexertion that mars many a
rock and roll outing.
"Wait!" you say. "OK:
sarcasm is easy enough — I
want a clever review that says
something as well." Exactly.
One could call Martha and the
Muffins the rock and roll
equivalent of the snide sarcastic
review — which is not to accuse
Martha and the Muffins of
snideness, cynicism, or, most
importantly, a lack of talent.
It's just that they got their point
across with the least effort pos
sible.
The band, led by Martha
Johnson, plays and writes very
well, and their records are bet
ter than most. But the live Muf
fins lacked both the stage pres
ence and the fire to transform
their songs into the excruciat
ingly danceable. It's like ham
burgers: all you need is a bun,
meat, catsup, and you know
what you're getting and that
you'll always like it. But of
course there are infinite ways of
combining these ingredients,

some good, some exquisite.
Martha and the Muffins were a
good solid Gooseburger — not a
bad thing — but they could have
been a Hamburger Mary's Chili
Side..
With a typical New Wave line
up (lead guitar, bass, drums,
electric keyboards) the real
force behind the Muffins is the
sax playing of Andy Haas. Cut
ting in and out of the usual syn
thesizer licks and the tepid lyr
ical alienation (although the
word "television"' was sung not
once the entire evening), Haas'
sax makes the music come
alive. But unfortunately he was
by far the coolest of the Muffins,
hiding behind shades and mean
dering around at the back of the
stage when not standing rigidly
still with his horn. Lead singer
Johnson ptayed some eye games
with the audience, and, through
no fault of her own, posesses one
of the wildest mouths in com
temporary music (Mick Jag
ger's lips fused on Joey
Ramone's overbite). She sang
well enough, but without either
passion or the style of someone
like Gary Neuman — she was
the focal point of the band to be
sure, but more through her role
as lead singer than through any
particular personal dynamism
Keeping pretty much to them
selves, the rest of the Muffins

did what they had to, lacking
personality and not even ugly
enough to be visually interest
ing.
The key phrase, though, is
"did what they had to." They
did. They didn't bust their buns,
but the Muffins did get the au
dience to shake theirs, quite an
accomplishment for California
Avenue, and past 9:30 at that.
You liked it.it was over, and you
didn't need a napkin.
