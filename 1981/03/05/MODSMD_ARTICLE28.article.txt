# 'Candles': six on a scale of 10
## 
### David Schmelzer 
What do the songs "Rock
With You." "Always and Forev
er." "Give Me the Night,"
"Love Times Love," "Off the
Wall." and "Boogie Nights"
have in common? They were all
relatively recent hits for black
singers, but more importantly,
they were also all written by
Rod Temperton. who is white.
This isn't Temperton's only
contradiction. First, his music
cannot by pigeonholed; his cred
its have spanned jazz, disco,
funk, and mellow pop. Second,
tor two years he was a member
ot a predominantly black band
and the writer and arranger of
all its music. Now, after os
tensibly "quitting" the band to
branch out. he still creates most
of what they do.
The group. Heatwave, has
some contradictions of its own.

Primarily because of Tem
perton. Heatwave, too, cannot
be readily labeled. Where the
band straight-out discoed on its
first hit. "Boogie Nights." it
pleaded sensitively on its next.
"Always and Forever." And.
unlike almost any other popular
black band, Heatwave ori
ginated outside of the United
States, in London.
What cannot be contradicted
in either case is that both Heat
wave and Temperton have some
talent Temperton, in particu
lar. must be considered one of
the great unsung forces in con
temporary music after having
given a needed push to the ca
reers ot such major artists as
Michael Jackson and George
Benson The band and its writer
are certainly capable of misfir
ing. as they proved on the last
Heatwave album. Hut /Vopcr
t\. a mediocre effort at best on

which Temperton wrote nine of
10 songs, but they are also
capable of firing: with their cur
rent Candles LP they once
again show promise.
For Heatwave. Candles is the
beginning of a move away from
any true disco or funk to a
mellower style. Even songs
with titles such as "Gangsters
of the Groove." "Jitterbug
gin," and "Party Suite," have a
more subdued, polished sound
than did the taster music ot the
band's past, a trend which, de
pending upon one's taste, will
likely be seen as an improve
ment. This element, along with
better songs, gives the album a
continuity that their last lacked,
and lead singer Johnnie Wilder
Jr., a Benson sound-alike, is too
skillful a crooner for the band to
avoid utilizing this strength as
often as possible.
The gem of the album is pre

dictably one ot Temperton's ef
forts. "Dreamin' You is a
light, bouncy piece that belongs
in the same league with his
more familiar works It is not a
brilliant song; it's lyrics are no
better than pedestrian ("You
and 1 were made lor lovin ")
and its orchestration has noth
ing unusual to recommend it
But Temperton is an unpreten
tious writer who is not trying to
be brilliant, but rather to create
pleasant, catchy songs, and
"Dreamin' You" is nothing if
not that.
About as deep as he gets on
the album is in "Posin' Till
Closin," his comment on those
who live only to present an im
age. Considering this, it's amaz
ing that his songs could ever be
come anyone's favorites, but
they do, and there's something
insidious about that
On an arbitrary scale of 10,
( andles would rate about a six.
It's not an exceptional work and
its messages go little beyond
lovin' and groovin'. But it is en
joyable and easy to listen to and
has at least four songs that are
quite good, while only one is no
ticeably bad. One hopes that
their next album won't be a
move backward from their
gains made here.



Guys and Dolls: "Call it hell, call it heaven, it's a probable 12 to seven, that the guy's only doing it for
some doll. . Lay your bets on the Burbank Players production of "Guys and Dolls" tonight, Friday
and Saturday nights'in the Burbank Dining Hall at 8 p.m. With imaginative sets, a six-piece orchestra
directed by LSJUMB member Gene Davis, and a psyched-up cast, "Guys and Dolls" promises to be a
great time. Directed by Bill Deverell, assisted by Jeff Rusch, and choreographed by Bambi Haggins,
the show is overseen by a good mixture of rookies and professionals. Cool out in the streets of New York
with the "oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York," the sexy Hot Box dolls, the
debonair Sky Masterson, and the ingenue Miss Sarah Brown. Bring your pillows — the show is free —
and come ready for fun. (Pictured is Bambi Haggins, backed by Michael Weiss and Alonzo Wong.)

"Dreamin' You" is nothing if

About as deep as he gets on
the album is in "Posin' Till

they do, and there's something

It's not an exceptional work and
its messages go little beyond

their next album won't be a
move backward from their
gains made here.



Guys and Dolls: "Call it hell, call it heaven, it's a probable 12 to seven, that the guy's only doing it for
some doll. . Lay your bets on the Burbank Players production of "Guys and Dolls" tonight, Friday
and Saturday nights'in the Burbank Dining Hall at 8 p.m. With imaginative sets, a six-piece orchestra
directed by LSJUMB member Gene Davis, and a psyched-up cast, "Guys and Dolls" promises to be a
great time. Directed by Bill Deverell, assisted by Jeff Rusch, and choreographed by Bambi Haggins,
the show is overseen by a good mixture of rookies and professionals. Cool out in the streets of New York
with the "oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York," the sexy Hot Box dolls, the
debonair Sky Masterson, and the ingenue Miss Sarah Brown. Bring your pillows — the show is free —
and come ready for fun. (Pictured is Bambi Haggins, backed by Michael Weiss and Alonzo Wong.)
What do the songs "Rock
With You." "Always and Forev
er." "Give Me the Night,"
"Love Times Love," "Off the
Wall." and "Boogie Nights"
have in common? They were all
relatively recent hits for black
singers, but more importantly,
they were also all written by
Rod Temperton. who is white.
This isn't Temperton's only
contradiction. First, his music
cannot by pigeonholed; his cred
its have spanned jazz, disco,
funk, and mellow pop. Second,
tor two years he was a member
ot a predominantly black band
and the writer and arranger of
all its music. Now, after os
tensibly "quitting" the band to
branch out. he still creates most
of what they do.
The group. Heatwave, has
some contradictions of its own.

Primarily because of Tem
perton. Heatwave, too, cannot
be readily labeled. Where the
band straight-out discoed on its
first hit. "Boogie Nights." it
pleaded sensitively on its next.
"Always and Forever." And.
unlike almost any other popular
black band, Heatwave ori
ginated outside of the United
States, in London.
What cannot be contradicted
in either case is that both Heat
wave and Temperton have some
talent Temperton, in particu
lar. must be considered one of
the great unsung forces in con
temporary music after having
given a needed push to the ca
reers ot such major artists as
Michael Jackson and George
Benson The band and its writer
are certainly capable of misfir
ing. as they proved on the last
Heatwave album. Hut /Vopcr
t\. a mediocre effort at best on

which Temperton wrote nine of
10 songs, but they are also
capable of firing: with their cur
rent Candles LP they once
again show promise.
For Heatwave. Candles is the
beginning of a move away from
any true disco or funk to a
mellower style. Even songs
with titles such as "Gangsters
of the Groove." "Jitterbug
gin," and "Party Suite," have a
more subdued, polished sound
than did the taster music ot the
band's past, a trend which, de
pending upon one's taste, will
likely be seen as an improve
ment. This element, along with
better songs, gives the album a
continuity that their last lacked,
and lead singer Johnnie Wilder
Jr., a Benson sound-alike, is too
skillful a crooner for the band to
avoid utilizing this strength as
often as possible.
The gem of the album is pre

dictably one ot Temperton's ef
forts. "Dreamin' You is a
light, bouncy piece that belongs
in the same league with his
more familiar works It is not a
brilliant song; it's lyrics are no
better than pedestrian ("You
and 1 were made lor lovin ")
