# Falwell: the movies can stay
## 
### 
The Rev. Jerry Falwell, lead
er of the Moral Majority, has
said that "I am not personally
for the abolition of the movie in
dustry."
Falwell did say, however, in
an interview published recently
in The Los Angeles Times, that
"the X-rated. and R-rated mov
ies of today, 1 think, are very
dangerous to the moral values
of the country."
The conservative leader, ad
mitting that he hadn't been to
the movies in 29 years, was
asked how he knew that some of
today's movies were a bad in
fluence when he had never seen
them.
He replied, "I don't think you
have to take the cap off the
sewer to know it stinks."
