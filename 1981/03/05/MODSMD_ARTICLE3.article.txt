The ASSU guest professorship board will sponsor three
guest professors spring quarter, including a prominent en
vironmentalist and a student's rights lobbyist, as well as
presidential candididate John Anderson.
David Brower, ex-president of the Sierra Club and
founder and current chair of Friends of the Earth, will
teach a course called "Earth Island: Getting From Here
to 2001." According to Brower, the course will examine
"alternatives that can bring Earth to 2001 in better shape
than the Global 2000 Report predicted." The Global 2000
report was an interdisciplinary study of the future pre
sented to then-President Jimmy Carter last summer.
Brower's course is crosslisted under Human Biology 182
and VTSIS3. It meets Tuesday and Thursday from 3:30 to 5
p.m. Enrollment is limited to 85.
Andre Burnett, a lobbyist for the U.S. Student Associa
tion, who has testified in support of federal student loans,
will offer a SWOPSI course "Minority Issues in Higher
Education." The course will cover such issues as af
firmative action admissions policies, minority faculty and
community relations. According to guest professorship
board member Pete Escabado, Burnett's course may be

accredited by the School of Education. Burnett has testi
fied before Senate committees on the subject of minority
education.
John Anderson's much-publicized decision to teach at
Stanford next quarter brings two new political science
courses to the campus â€” a five-unit seminar on American
politics limited to five graduate students and 10 under
grads, and a three-unit lecture course, "The Legislative
Process," open to all students, but with enrollment lim
ited to 400. A sign in Old Union warned yesterday that the
lecture course would not be offered pass/fail, would have a
mandatory section on Fridays and would have a term pa
per and a final. The lecture course will meet Monday.
Wednesday and Friday at 2:15.
Brower's and Anderson's courses are the first ASSU
Guest Professorship Board courses to be accredited by
regular University departments. The Guest Board courses
traditionally have been sponsored by SWOPSI.
Brower will quite likely be living in University housing,
possibly Zapata house, according to ASSU board member
Dick Butterfield.
Anderson 's lectures will be broadcast in the evenings on
KZSU.
