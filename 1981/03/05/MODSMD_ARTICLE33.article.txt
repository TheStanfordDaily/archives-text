# Phil Collins goes home again
## 
### Don Willenburg 
The passage of time and the commercial
success of their most recent recordings
have eroded Genesis' reputation as a
progressive band. This is perhaps unfair:
like another one-time British avant garde
group, Pink Floyd, it is at least arguable
that success after so many years of putting
out albums with at best a cult audience was
less a matter of the band selling out than of
the market finally catching up.
Still, neither band is immune from
charges that, once they attained success,
the experimental approach which marked
them as somehow different trom the vast
majority of recording acts was discarded in
favor of formula songs and albums pat
terned after their more successful en
deavors.
In his new album, Face Value, Phil Col
lins demonstrates that you can go home
again. Longtime Genesis drummer and lead
singer after the departure of Peter Gabriel,
Collins has attempted to shed the cloak ot
formula commercialism and return to ex
ploring the sources of music by releasing an
album which attempts to bridge the broad
gap between Western rock and African
tribal percussionism.
While the result is not always successful,
it is another example ot a growing trend of
restlessness within the ranks of progressive
rock with the limitations imposed by con
ventional standards of sound and construc
tion.
There are striking similarities between
Collins' effort and the recent Talking Heads
album Remain in Light. Both albums em
ploy the considerable talents of established
commercially successful black musicians.
The Heads' new lineup includes several
members of the Par
liament/Funkadelic/Bootsy amalgam of
musicians performing music far more
authentically African than most of what

they are accustomed to putting on vinyl.
Collins imports the horn section from
Earth. Wind and Fire from Chicago's South
Side to augment an impressive array ot
white establishment rockers, including
Eric Clapton and Stephen Bishop
More important than the musicians is the
influence on both albums by former Roxy
Music creative spirit Brian Eno. Eno has
spent considerable time lately working on a
fusion ot his futuristic electronism and
primitive African music.
Aside from producing Remain in Light,
Eno and Talking Heads leader David Byrne
have scheduled the release of their long
awaited joint effort, (ihnst Stories, for later
this month. His association with Genesis
goes back to the days when Peter Gabriel
would lock himself in a room for a week to
write yet another part of the epic The Lam h
Lies Don n < >n Broadway.
Somehow, the synthesized syncretism
works. Eno's tape loops are both the pat
terned spontaneity of African percussion, as
much melody as rhythm, and something
more. There is a haunting tone to many of
the songs, much as a certain degree of fear
or apprehension attends to exploration or
the confrontation of two vastly different
aural cultures.
Nowhere is this more successful than on
the first song on Face Value, "In the Air To
night.'' Collins' habitual tracking ot his
voice through an echo chamber is less the
crass gimmick it often is than just the cor
rect touch of urban intrusion into primeval
mystery. The lyrics allude to Gabriel's per
sona on Lamb, Rael, and assert Collins'
creative independence from Gabriel at the
same time they signal his intention to return
to the impressionistic approach of the band
during Gabriel's tenure. "Drowning I would
not take your hand," Collins sings to
Gabriel/Rael: but as tor the value of subse
quent commercial success and the supposed
creative superiority of Gabriel to the rest of

the band, "it's all been a pack of lies."
Collins has often been the victim of unfair
comparisons with Gabriel, much as the rep
utation of the band has declined as they have
become more successful since Gabriel's de
parture three years ago. His refusal to be
buried under this conventional wisdom is an
admirable display of spirit, but fortunately
Collins is not prima donna enough to let this
dominate either the song or the album (as
Gabriel might well have done) or limit the
appreciation of his work to those who are fa
miliar enough to catch the "inside story" to
his lyrics.
Where the experimentation fails, how
ever, it fails miserably Sometimes Collins
seems content to recite tired cliches about
black music. "Behind the Lines," on the
first side, goes past being a neo-Crusaders
song to sounding all too much like the Jack
son Five. At other times, he indulges in the
overblown instrumentalism and arrange
ments Genesis is famous tor. Several of the
songs use a chorus that sounds like a cross
between the Electric Light Orchestra and
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir patched
through the vox humana key on a Wurlitzer
color-keyed home organ.
Likewise, his successes are not limited to
his synthesis of the aboriginal and modern
pop "You Know What I Mean" has a beau
tiful, 96th floor nightclub-inspired piano ac
companiment with a telling and familiar
"so why did you come back now" story. In
"The Roof is Leaking," Collins sings of ag
ing with empathy if discouragingly. It is an
other perfect piano composition, with banjo
rolls that lend an appropriately antique col
or to a chorus where the singer tries to con
vince himself that he isn't old â€” yet. It is a
revealing song by an artist who has tasted
both acclaim as a member of a progressive
unit and commercial success extending as
far as AM radio. Collins refuses to be con
signed to either role, and the listener is the
better for his decision.

group, Pink Floyd, it is at least arguable
that success after so many years of putting
out albums with at best a cult audience was
less a matter of the band selling out than of
the market finally catching up.
Still, neither band is immune from
charges that, once they attained success,
the experimental approach which marked
them as somehow different trom the vast
majority of recording acts was discarded in
favor of formula songs and albums pat
terned after their more successful en
deavors.
In his new album, Face Value, Phil Col
lins demonstrates that you can go home
again. Longtime Genesis drummer and lead
singer after the departure of Peter Gabriel,
Collins has attempted to shed the cloak ot
formula commercialism and return to ex
ploring the sources of music by releasing an
album which attempts to bridge the broad
gap between Western rock and African
tribal percussionism.
While the result is not always successful,
it is another example ot a growing trend of
restlessness within the ranks of progressive
rock with the limitations imposed by con
ventional standards of sound and construc
tion.
There are striking similarities between
Collins' effort and the recent Talking Heads
album Remain in Light. Both albums em
ploy the considerable talents of established
commercially successful black musicians.
The Heads' new lineup includes several
members of the Par
liament/Funkadelic/Bootsy amalgam of
musicians performing music far more
authentically African than most of what

they are accustomed to putting on vinyl.
Collins imports the horn section from
Earth. Wind and Fire from Chicago's South
Side to augment an impressive array ot
white establishment rockers, including
Eric Clapton and Stephen Bishop
More important than the musicians is the
influence on both albums by former Roxy
Music creative spirit Brian Eno. Eno has
spent considerable time lately working on a
fusion ot his futuristic electronism and
primitive African music.
Aside from producing Remain in Light,
Eno and Talking Heads leader David Byrne
have scheduled the release of their long
awaited joint effort, (ihnst Stories, for later
this month. His association with Genesis
goes back to the days when Peter Gabriel
would lock himself in a room for a week to
write yet another part of the epic The Lam h
Lies Don n < >n Broadway.
Somehow, the synthesized syncretism
works. Eno's tape loops are both the pat
terned spontaneity of African percussion, as
much melody as rhythm, and something
more. There is a haunting tone to many of
the songs, much as a certain degree of fear
or apprehension attends to exploration or
the confrontation of two vastly different
aural cultures.
Nowhere is this more successful than on
the first song on Face Value, "In the Air To
night.'' Collins' habitual tracking ot his
voice through an echo chamber is less the
crass gimmick it often is than just the cor
rect touch of urban intrusion into primeval
mystery. The lyrics allude to Gabriel's per
sona on Lamb, Rael, and assert Collins'
creative independence from Gabriel at the
same time they signal his intention to return
to the impressionistic approach of the band
during Gabriel's tenure. "Drowning I would
not take your hand," Collins sings to
Gabriel/Rael: but as tor the value of subse
quent commercial success and the supposed
creative superiority of Gabriel to the rest of

the band, "it's all been a pack of lies."
Collins has often been the victim of unfair
comparisons with Gabriel, much as the rep
utation of the band has declined as they have
become more successful since Gabriel's de
parture three years ago. His refusal to be
buried under this conventional wisdom is an
admirable display of spirit, but fortunately
Collins is not prima donna enough to let this
dominate either the song or the album (as
Gabriel might well have done) or limit the
appreciation of his work to those who are fa
miliar enough to catch the "inside story" to
his lyrics.
Where the experimentation fails, how
ever, it fails miserably Sometimes Collins
seems content to recite tired cliches about
black music. "Behind the Lines," on the
first side, goes past being a neo-Crusaders
song to sounding all too much like the Jack
son Five. At other times, he indulges in the
overblown instrumentalism and arrange
ments Genesis is famous tor. Several of the
songs use a chorus that sounds like a cross
between the Electric Light Orchestra and
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir patched
through the vox humana key on a Wurlitzer
color-keyed home organ.
Likewise, his successes are not limited to
his synthesis of the aboriginal and modern
pop "You Know What I Mean" has a beau
tiful, 96th floor nightclub-inspired piano ac
companiment with a telling and familiar
"so why did you come back now" story. In
"The Roof is Leaking," Collins sings of ag
ing with empathy if discouragingly. It is an
other perfect piano composition, with banjo
rolls that lend an appropriately antique col
or to a chorus where the singer tries to con
vince himself that he isn't old â€” yet. It is a
revealing song by an artist who has tasted
both acclaim as a member of a progressive
unit and commercial success extending as
far as AM radio. Collins refuses to be con
signed to either role, and the listener is the
better for his decision.
The passage of time and the commercial
success of their most recent recordings
have eroded Genesis' reputation as a
progressive band. This is perhaps unfair:

group, Pink Floyd, it is at least arguable
