Evolution trial settlement collapses
Sacramento — Negotiations to settle a suit by religious fun
damentalists over the teaching of evolution in California schools
apparently collapsed yesterday, and the trial turned into a line
by-line study of an eighth-grade science text
The suit by a San Diego group that espouses the biblical account
of creation as scientific truth contends the state violates religious
rights in the way evolution is taught in science classes.
Both sides appeared to be close to a settlement Tuesday, as the
dispute narrowed to the wording of a few sentences on the de
velopment of life forms in the state's guidelines for science books
that schools can buy with state funds.
But an hour-long, closed-door meeting yesterday morning in
the chambers of Superior Court Judge Irving Perluss ended
without an agreement.
Neither side would discuss details, but Richard Turner, lawyer
for the creationists, told reporters. "We're not going to settle this
case. We're going to go all the way to judgment."
The Creation-Science Research Center, which brought the suit,
says it doesn't object to the teaching of evolution, only to its pres
entation as absolute fact The center has withdrawn its request
for equal treatment of the biblical account
Justice Dept. opposes Texas on Medflies
Washington — The U.S government became an ally with Cali
fornia yesterday when the Justice Department joined the state in
opposing before the Supreme Court Texas' quarantine on Califor
nia-grown fruit and vegetables.
Texas has barred entry of all California produce unless it is
fumigated or chilled to kill eggs and larvae of the Mediterranean
fruit fly, or "Medfly," a highly destructive crop pest.
California itself quarantined a 500-square-mile area in Santa
Clara and Alameda counties, where it has waged a $14 million
campaign to stamp out a Medfly infestation.
But it says no quarantine is needed against the other 99 percent
of the state's fruit and vegetable production.
Last Feb. 24. California asked the Supreme Court to block the
Texas quarantine and the Justice Department joined the effort
for an injunction yesterday.
So far, the high court has not acted on the case and Texas put its
program into effect at the start of this month.
Reagan gains Senate budget victory
Washington — The Senate Agriculture Committee handed
President Ronald Reagan his first budget-cutting victory yester
day by endorsing his call for eliminating the scheduled April I in
crease in milk price supports.
Eliminating the semi-annual adjustment would save the gov
ernment an estimated $147 million this fiscal year. If the increase
were implemented, consumers likely would have had to pay l x 'z
cents more for a gallon of milk and a dime more for a pound of
butter or cheese.
The committee's 14-2 vote sent the proposal to the full Senate

■j From the Associated Press and the 1 us Angeles Times Washington Post N'eus Seriiiv[.

tor action The measure has been introduced in the House but no
hearings have yet been held.
After the vote. White House press secretary James Brady said
the president was "gratified our package moves forward ""
The support price is scheduled to automatically rise to $13 68
per 100 pounds on April 1 for the class of milk used to make butter,
cheese and non-fat dry milk That would be an increase of 88 cents
above the Oct 1 level
To maintain the support prices, the government buys butter,
cheese and powdered milk at rates which allow the processor
enough profit to pay the farmer at least the support-level price for
the raw product.
Republicans on the Agriculture Committee urged approval of
the measure eliminating the price support increase as a way to
show the American people Congress intends to work to solve the
nation's economic ills.
Thailand's ruling party resigns
Bangkok. Thailand — Thailand's ruling coalition government
came unstuck yesterday but Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda
was expected to survive because of his personal popularity and
army support
The biggest of Thailand's quarrelsome political parties, the So
cial Action Party, resigned from the government, taking with it a
team of economic experts headed by Deputy Prime Minister
Boonchu Rojanastien. Thailand's top banker.
Despite crisis headlines in the Bangkok press, the resignations
were not expected to have more than a passing effect on the sta
bility of Gen. Prem's government. Some analysts went so far as to
say that the government might even be better off without
Boonchu and his economic team since, in the view of his critics,
they have accomplished very litle anyway.
The mass resignations — Thailand was temporarily without
three Cabinet ministers — left Prem no choice but to go about re
shaping his government.
Stiffer punishments may increase crime
Washington — A black psychologist whose work was cited in the
Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation ruling predicted yesterday
that violent crime will grow worse if the nation imposes stiffer
punishment on violators.
Kenneth Clark told a House Judiciary subcommittee on crimi
nal justice that violent crimes are committed by "individuals
who have given up on any possibility of a quality of life that is
positive."
"They operate on the assumption that they don't have a damn
thing to lose," Clark told the congressmen, most of whom ap
peared taken aback by his remarks. "In some cases, they have a
moment in the sun in the case of being caught."
Clark's testimony came as the subcommittee, headed by Rep.
John Conyers (D-Mich.), renewed its inquiry into violence
against minorities.
Contending that penalties and punishment are irrelevant to
criminals. Clark said that countering the surge in violent crime

"is not as easy as (providing for) severe punishment, building
more jails, having tougher police who shoot first and ask ques
tions later.
"All these things do is increase the adversary relationship be
tween the underclass and (the rest of) society." Clark said. "In
fact, we're perpetuating a kind of guerrilla warfare

Stanislaw Kania

Sihanouk softens stance on Khmer Rouge
Pyongyang, North Korea — Prince Norodom Sihanouk an
nounced here yesterday he was ready to compromise in an effort
to set up an anti-Vietnamese coalition with the Kampuchean
Khmer Rouge but asked for Chinese and American aid to create
an independent army.
The former Kampuchean head of state said he would stick to his
demand for a neutral Kampuchea but would drop a precondition
that would have led to the vacating of the Kampuchean seat at the
United Nations. Sihanouk will meet here soon with his former en
emy in Kampuchea, the communist Khmer Rouge and its ally,
China. The groups are seeking to drive Vietnamese forces from
Kampuchean territory.
The prince told this correspondent that he hoped to sign "a mili
tary agreement" with China aimed at developing an army of his
own, totally independent of the Khmer Rouge.
"We will have the soldiers and necessary framework, but it will
be necessary for China and the United States to give us material
aid," the prince said, adding that he could set up an army "with as
many as 100,000 men."
