Washington — Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) mobilized liberal op
position yesterday to President
Ronald Reagan's government spend
ing cuts, staging a hearing where wit
nesses predicted budget reductions
would torce up to 750,000 students to
drop out of college, deprive sick elder
ly people of health care, and banish
drug addicts from treatment centers.
Although no longer a committee
chairman, since Republicans won con
trol of the Senate, Kennedy displayed
potent media drawing power as re
porters and television cameramen
jammed a small hearing room for the
first in a series of anti-Reagan "policy
forums" by him and other Democratic
senators. Their goal is to slow the na
tional wave of opinion favoring the
president's tax cuts and spending re
ductions by offering examples of their
impact on some groups.
Meanwhile, the political maneu
vering in the budget wars also
heightened on the Republican side as
William Brock, the GOP's former na
tional chairman, predicted that the
president will use "raw power, if nec
essary" — the veto — to win con
gressional approval of his tax- and
budget-cutting programs.
'Ultimate weapon'
Brock, now the administration's
special trade representative, told a
group of reporters that the president is
willing to make frequent use of his
"ultimate weapon," if that is what it
takes to get his program through Con
gress.
Reagan has proposed a budget of
$695.5 billion, which represents a cut
of $46 billion from the budget proposed
by former President Jimmy Carter
for the fiscal year starting next Oct. 1.
Appearing at the Kennedy hearing
were representatives of educational,
health and labor organizations, as well

laual «jU Vucim.
Cutbacks in grants and loans to stu
dents would force 500,000 to 750,000
men and women to drop out of college,
said E.K. Fretwell, chairman of the
American Council on Education, an
organization representing colleges
and universities. The family income
eligibility ceiling for aid-to-education
grants would be rolled back by Rea
gan's proposals to $19,000 a year from
the present $25,000, making thousands
of students ineligible for aid, said
Fretwell, who is chancellor of the Uni
versity of North Carolina at Charlotte.
In addition to reducing grant and
loan programs, the administration
also wants to eliminate scholarship
money given to children of a person
covered under the Social Security pro
gram who died before retirement age.
The administration takes the position
that help is available under other fed
eral programs.
"If Chrysler Corp. can get a huge
loan, children should be able to get a
loan to go to school," said Elinor
Nemanich of Plainfield, 111., a widow
whose daughter is attending college
with aid received under the Social Se
curity survivors program. If the mon
ey is cut off, "we're out of luck," said
Nemanich, who said she earns $18,800
a year as a schoolteacher, and is
paying about half her daughter's col
lege costs of $9,000 a year.
Actually, Chrysler did not get a gov

ment has guaranteed payment on
notes Chrysler is selling to the public
it such payment should be necessary.
Addict
"Amy," a 20-year-old former heroin
addict, said she needs Project Return
in New York because "it it were taken
away from me. it would mean death."
Amy, who was stealing to feed a $200-
a-day drug habit, is a resident at the
project, a rehabilitation center in New
York.
The administration plan to reduce
certain types ot health spending by 25
percent would torce the center to send
!00 of its 400 young residents back into
the streets, said Ed Menken, a former
addict who is president ot Project Re
turn.
"Who will decide who is going to
live and to die?" he said.
At the White House yesterday, there
was an example ot the kind of problem
Reagan faces in getting his spending
cuts through Congress.
Fifty-two Republican freshmen
congressmen met with the president
for breakfast and told him they stand
tirmly behind his economic program,
and later adopted a resolution sup
porting it. But under questioning,
some acknowledged that they might
not support cuts that affected their
home districts.
