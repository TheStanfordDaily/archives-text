# Reagan: more spending on armed forces
## 
### 
F'rom the Daily wire services
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan asked Congress yesterday to
increase defense spending by 16 per
cent between this fiscal year and next
as part ot a $1.3 trillion buildup in the
nation's defenses over the next five
years.
Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger, presenting the request to a
supportive Senate Armed Services
Committee, said: "Our proposed in
creases would significantly and quick
ly strengthen our ability to respond to
the Soviet threat at all levels of con
flict and in all areas of the world vital
to our national interest."
He conceded under questioning by
Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) that Rea
gan's revision of former President
Jimmy Carter's defense budgets for
fiscal 1982 and beyond assumes a low
er rate ot inflation than Carter
projected.
But Weinberger insisted this as
sumption is a good bet and promised,
if the administration is incorrect, to
ask Congress for extra money to buy
the missiles, ships, planes and tanks
included in Reagan's five-year plan.
The Reagan administration vir
tually took the Carter shopping list
and ordered more of the same weap
ons rather than place a different kind
of order with the nation's defense con
tractors. An exception was the addi
tion ot $2.5 billion to finance a new
manned bomber to penetrate Soviet
defenses.
Bomber purchase
What kind of bomber should be
purchased is a question the Pentagon
will study until June. An update of the
B-l bomber, which Carter rejected in
favor of cruise missiles and the
"Stealth" designed to be invisible to
enemy radar, are the leading can
didates.
Because of additions to Carter's fis
cal 1981 and 1982 defense budgets, it is
now estimated that military spending
will jump from $158.6 billion to $184.8
billion between those years, an in
ol .*» porcmtV, V»v.YV«v«Oi VA» V»V IX
record hike between two peacetime
budget years.
Slow increase
An Office of Management and
Budget spokesman said yesterday
night that the spending increase under
the Reagan defense budget would be
slow, amounting to only $4.8 billion
more for fiscal 1982 than would have
been the case under the Carter budget.
He asserted that the military spending
hike is not disproportionate to cuts
proposed by Reagan in several
domestic programs.
Because money set aside in one
year's Pentagon budget is not actually
spent for several years, the amount
shown as the total obligational author
ity is substantially larger than the
spending figure.
Reagan seeks Congressional ap
proval to obligate $178 billion in fiscal
1981 and $222.2 billion in fiscal 1982, an
increase of 24 percent. Those totals
represent net increases of $6.8 billion
and $25.8 billion in the Carter budgets
for fiscal 1981 and 1982.
In fiscal 1982 through 1986, Reagan
would spend $1,289 trillion and ob
ligate $1,460 trillion.
Higher goal
From fiscal 1983 onward, Reagan is
striving for an annual after-inflation
growth of about 7 percent compared to
5 percent set as an objective by the
credit to help offset Social Security
tax increases and a targeted business
tax cut to help what he called the "tru
ly deserving needy'-' of the business
world.
In addition to the criticism from
Democrat Jones, Kirkland drew some
heavy fire from Republicans on the
Budget Committee. Rep. Delbert Lat
ta of Ohio, its ranking minority mem
ber, noted polls showing that 50 per
cent of union members voted for Rea
gan and questioned whether "you
speak for the rank-and-file members
of your unions.'' One could even
"come to the conclusion that you do
not believe in the free enterprise sys
tem, which has given your members
the highest standard of living of any in
dustrialized nation on earth and
which, incidentally, has made your
job possible," added Latta.

F'rom the Daily wire services
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan asked Congress yesterday to
increase defense spending by 16 per
cent between this fiscal year and next
as part ot a $1.3 trillion buildup in the
nation's defenses over the next five
years.
Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger, presenting the request to a
supportive Senate Armed Services
Committee, said: "Our proposed in
creases would significantly and quick
ly strengthen our ability to respond to
the Soviet threat at all levels of con
flict and in all areas of the world vital
to our national interest."
He conceded under questioning by
Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) that Rea
gan's revision of former President
Jimmy Carter's defense budgets for
fiscal 1982 and beyond assumes a low
er rate ot inflation than Carter
projected.
But Weinberger insisted this as
sumption is a good bet and promised,
if the administration is incorrect, to
ask Congress for extra money to buy
the missiles, ships, planes and tanks
included in Reagan's five-year plan.
The Reagan administration vir
tually took the Carter shopping list
and ordered more of the same weap
ons rather than place a different kind
of order with the nation's defense con
tractors. An exception was the addi
tion ot $2.5 billion to finance a new
manned bomber to penetrate Soviet
defenses.
Bomber purchase
What kind of bomber should be
purchased is a question the Pentagon
will study until June. An update of the
B-l bomber, which Carter rejected in
favor of cruise missiles and the
"Stealth" designed to be invisible to
enemy radar, are the leading can
didates.
Because of additions to Carter's fis
cal 1981 and 1982 defense budgets, it is
now estimated that military spending
will jump from $158.6 billion to $184.8
billion between those years, an in
ol .*» porcmtV, V»v.YV«v«Oi VA» V»V IX
record hike between two peacetime
budget years.
Slow increase
An Office of Management and
Budget spokesman said yesterday
night that the spending increase under
the Reagan defense budget would be
slow, amounting to only $4.8 billion
more for fiscal 1982 than would have
been the case under the Carter budget.
He asserted that the military spending
hike is not disproportionate to cuts
proposed by Reagan in several
domestic programs.
Because money set aside in one
year's Pentagon budget is not actually
spent for several years, the amount
shown as the total obligational author
ity is substantially larger than the
spending figure.
Reagan seeks Congressional ap
proval to obligate $178 billion in fiscal
1981 and $222.2 billion in fiscal 1982, an
increase of 24 percent. Those totals
represent net increases of $6.8 billion
and $25.8 billion in the Carter budgets
for fiscal 1981 and 1982.
In fiscal 1982 through 1986, Reagan
would spend $1,289 trillion and ob
ligate $1,460 trillion.
Higher goal
From fiscal 1983 onward, Reagan is
striving for an annual after-inflation
growth of about 7 percent compared to
5 percent set as an objective by the
credit to help offset Social Security
tax increases and a targeted business
tax cut to help what he called the "tru
ly deserving needy'-' of the business
world.
