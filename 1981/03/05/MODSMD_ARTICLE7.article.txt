# Kirkland criticizes Reagan budget

From the Daily wire services
Washington â€” AFL-CIO President
Lane Kirkland delivered a scathing at
tack on President Ronald Reagan's
economic program on Capitol Hill yes
terday as congressional Democrats
continued to send contradictory sig
nals about their response to Reagan's
initiatives.
"The Reagan budget constitutes the
most costly roll of the dice ever pro
posed for this nation by economic poli
cy-makers,'' Kirkland told the House
Budget Committee in the harshest
criticism that the administration's
spending and tax reduction plans have
drawn so far in congressional testi
mony by a major public figure.
"The administration is gambling
with the well-being of those who can ill
afford to gamble, in order to provide a
sure winner for the wealthy who are
not asked to take any of the risk,"
Kirkland said.
Responding that he was "troubled"
by the tenor of Kirkland s testimony,
Budget Committee Chairman James
Jones (D-Okla.) said it was "180
degrees different from what is being
recommended to this committee ' and
contrary to what he called a "man
date" to cut government spending.
Meanwhile, House Democrats
mounted what was advertised in ad
vance as the opening shot of a Demo

cratic response to the Reagan eco
nomic program, a "testing of the wa
ters" to see how tar the party should
go in criticizing Reagan economic pol
icies. But only half the designated
speakers turned up for what amounted
to desultory complaints about interest
rates.
Asked in advance of the effort
whether it meant that the "honey
moon" between Reagan and House
Democrats was over. House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) re
sponded, "We're not ready to play
hardball yet. . . . We're not obstruct
ing. We're going along We're giving
them plenty of room."
Total rejection
Kirkland, however, clearly did not
advocate a give-'em-enough-rope ap
proach as he called for virtually total
rejection of Reagan's program as "in
equitable, unfair and shortsighted."
Asked at one point whether Congress
should give Reagan what he wants on
the theory that this is the only way to
prove his plan won't work, Kirkland
said it would amount to "giving hypoc
risy a bad name."
Kirkland, a prime mover in a coali
tion of 157 groups that are fighting
Reagan's economic program,
challenged the basic premise of Rea
gan's budget-cutting drive: that
spending and deficits cause inflation.

In fact, he said, spending retrench
ment and inflation have gone hand-in
hand in recent years.
Kirkland was especially critical of
the administration's plan to cut trade
adjustment assistance for workers
whose jobs are jeopardized by im
ports, restrict money available for
Medicaid, eliminate the minimum So
cial Security benefit and cut out public
service jobs. "The cuts do not cut the
cost of social programs," he said
"They defer some and shift others to
the budgets of the states, localities
and the poor."
Least benefit
As for Reagan's proposed tax cut of
30 percent over three years, he said:
"Those families who have suffered
the sharpest declines in living stan
dards due to inflation get the least ben
efit from the tax cut proposal." The
administration's business tax cuts, he
added, would help "finance
speculative ventures, corporate
takeovers, industrial flight or foreign
expansion at the expense of U.S.
jobs."
If Congress wants to cut costs,
Kirkland said, it should consider end
ing deferral of taxes on overseas prof
its, the oil depletion allowance, for
eign tax credits and investment tax
credits. Kirkland also advocated a tax
