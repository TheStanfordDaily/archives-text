## American anti-inflation moves add to strain on West German economy 
### Washington Post 
Bonn — In a fresh show ot ir
ritation with the United States
— this time with U.S. economic
policy — West German Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt twice
publicly let slip remarks that
were critical of high U.S in
terest rates, calling the current
levels "destructive" and
"absolutely unacceptable'' tor
Western Europe's economies.
Schmidt was promptly
scolded by his own country's
press for voicing such dis
gruntlement. Across a broad
spectrum ot political opinion the
West German press warned
against pinning the blame for
West Germany's economic dif
ficulties on outside bogeymen.
American or otherwise
But Schmidt's comment
merely echoed a widespread
dissatisfaction with tight U.S.
credit policies in political and
business circles here This feel
ing is part of an ambivalent at
titude toward the Reagan ad
ministration's economic pro
gram: while applauding the new
president's tough attack on in
flation. West Germans worry
that it will add to burdens here
and frustrate hopes for a modest
economic recovery this year.
News analysis
Such uneasiness is under
standable in view of what hap
pened to the relationship be
tween the dollar and the West
German mark since Reagan's
election. The mark was worth 53
cents in November; by mid-
February it was worth only 44
cents.
Higher returns
Part of the reason for this was
indeed the pegging of U.S. in
terest rates at roughly twice the
West German rates. Because in
vestors can earn higher returns
from dollar assets, they sold
mark holdings and thus de
pressed the value of the West
German currency.
As the world's second reserve
currency, the mark auto
matically reacts more sharply
to dollar fluctuations than other
currencies inciuded in the Eu

ropean monetary system In re
cent weeks, the dollar's
strength has forced the West
German Federal Bank to spend
billions of dollars in currency
markets to shore up the mark —
and that costly intervention led
some analysts to predict a de
valuation of the mark inside the
European monetary system.
Instead. West German cen
tral bankers recently took addi
tional steps to discourage
speculation against the mark
and effectively raised West Ger
many's own interest rates to try
to narrow the difference with
U.S. rates. But such wrenching
upward ot interest rates threat
ens West Germany's already
weakened economy.
Much of the blame tor the
mark's struggle lies right here
in West Germany. Continued
heavy dependence on costly im
ported oil resulted last year in a
current-accounts deficit of $14
billion, the largest in the
Western world, and this dam
aged international confidence in
West Germany's currency. Re
lated doubts about Bonn's com
mitment to develop nuclear
energy have only worsened mat
ters. Friday's disclosure that
January had produced the worst
West German trade deficit
since 1950 was one more indica
tion.
Political tensions
On top of these economic wor
ries, political tensions in
Eastern Europe and the Middle
East — regions in which West
Germany has extensive invest
ments — have chipped away
faith in the mark.
Ironically, what Washington
is doing now to choke inflation is
what Schmidt and other West
German experts had advised for
months. International con
fidence in Reagan's leadership
has been one factor reflected in
the rise of the dollar against the
mark — the so-called "Reagan
bonus."
The problem for Bonn at the
moment is that the domestic
economy is less able to sustain
the strain resulting from Ameri
can ant\-vni\at\on moves.

A combination chiefly ot ex
pensive imported oil and intense
business competition with West
German products in both
domestic and foreign markets
has brought on a recession, with
Bonn predicting a loss of up to 1
percent in West Germany's
gross national product this year.
Unemployment has already
passed by several hundred
thousand what last year had
been the psychological hurdle of
1 million jobless.
Scenario
The scenario most Bonn of
ficials favor for a recovery is
this. West Germany's his
torically low inflation rate (it
was still only 5.5 percent in 19801
and the basic competitiveness
of West German industry will,
by later this year, spark an up
swing in the economy and re
store international confidence
in the mark.
This seems, in fact, to be the
only scenario. Schmidt's ad
visers appear to hold no view
more imaginative, nor does this
one appear to be grounded in
anything more than hope.
In the long run, West Germa
ny's economic health will de
pend on some fundamental —
and politically torturous — ad
justments. It will depend on fin
ding other energy sources to re
place expensive imported oil. It
will depend on spurring lagging
productivity to keep com
petitive what is now one of the
highest-paid work forces in the
industrialized world. It will also
depend on Bonn's ability to pay
for the extensive network of so
cial supports it has constructed,
or alternatively, do away with
some of them.
But the Bonn coalition gov
ernment, beset now by bicker
ing within and between the So
cial Democratic and Free Dem
ocratic parties, is hardly in posi
tion to reach consensus on these
highly controversial issues.
Consequently, high U.S. interest
rates have become a convenient
target — and an outlet for airing
the general distress felt here.

Schmidt recently said in a ra
dio interview with the Sud
deutscher Rundfunk: "We still
need detailed talks with our
American friends on the fact
that we here in Europe cannot
endure American interest rates
remaining at the 20 percent
level. That forces us to keep our
interest rates at a level inap
propriate to our economic and
cyclical situation."
The conservative daily Die
Welt charged Schmidt with
"boorish defamation," while
the independent Frankfurter Al-
Ifivmeine said that any hopes
that a U.S.-led drop in interest
rates would help West Germany
out of its troubles were un
realistic.
The paper noted further that
Karl Otto Pohl, the chief of the.
central bank, had also pointed to
the painful impact on the West
German economy of high U.S.
interest rates during a visit last
week to the United States. But it
said the banker had wisely re
frained from criticizing U.S.
policy.

The conservative daily Die
Welt charged Schmidt with
"boorish defamation," while
the independent Frankfurter Al-
Ifivmeine said that any hopes
that a U.S.-led drop in interest
rates would help West Germany
out of its troubles were un
realistic.
The paper noted further that
Karl Otto Pohl, the chief of the.
central bank, had also pointed to
the painful impact on the West
German economy of high U.S.

Bonn — In a fresh show ot ir
ritation with the United States
— this time with U.S. economic
policy — West German Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt twice
publicly let slip remarks that
were critical of high U.S in
terest rates, calling the current
levels "destructive" and
"absolutely unacceptable'' tor
Western Europe's economies.
Schmidt was promptly
scolded by his own country's
press for voicing such dis
gruntlement. Across a broad
spectrum ot political opinion the
West German press warned
against pinning the blame for
West Germany's economic dif
ficulties on outside bogeymen.
American or otherwise
But Schmidt's comment
merely echoed a widespread
dissatisfaction with tight U.S.
credit policies in political and
business circles here This feel
ing is part of an ambivalent at
titude toward the Reagan ad
ministration's economic pro
gram: while applauding the new
president's tough attack on in
flation. West Germans worry
that it will add to burdens here
and frustrate hopes for a modest
economic recovery this year.
News analysis
Such uneasiness is under
standable in view of what hap
pened to the relationship be
tween the dollar and the West
German mark since Reagan's
election. The mark was worth 53
cents in November; by mid-
February it was worth only 44
cents.
Higher returns
Part of the reason for this was
indeed the pegging of U.S. in
terest rates at roughly twice the
West German rates. Because in
vestors can earn higher returns
from dollar assets, they sold
mark holdings and thus de
pressed the value of the West
German currency.
As the world's second reserve
currency, the mark auto
matically reacts more sharply
to dollar fluctuations than other
currencies inciuded in the Eu

ropean monetary system In re
cent weeks, the dollar's
strength has forced the West
German Federal Bank to spend
billions of dollars in currency
markets to shore up the mark —
and that costly intervention led
some analysts to predict a de
valuation of the mark inside the
European monetary system.
Instead. West German cen
tral bankers recently took addi
tional steps to discourage
speculation against the mark
and effectively raised West Ger
many's own interest rates to try
to narrow the difference with
U.S. rates. But such wrenching
upward ot interest rates threat
ens West Germany's already
weakened economy.
Much of the blame tor the
mark's struggle lies right here
in West Germany. Continued
heavy dependence on costly im
ported oil resulted last year in a
current-accounts deficit of $14
billion, the largest in the
Western world, and this dam
aged international confidence in
West Germany's currency. Re
lated doubts about Bonn's com
mitment to develop nuclear
energy have only worsened mat
ters. Friday's disclosure that
January had produced the worst
West German trade deficit
since 1950 was one more indica
tion.
Political tensions
On top of these economic wor
ries, political tensions in
Eastern Europe and the Middle
East — regions in which West
Germany has extensive invest
ments — have chipped away
faith in the mark.
Ironically, what Washington
is doing now to choke inflation is
what Schmidt and other West
German experts had advised for
months. International con
fidence in Reagan's leadership
has been one factor reflected in
the rise of the dollar against the
mark — the so-called "Reagan
bonus."
The problem for Bonn at the
moment is that the domestic
economy is less able to sustain
the strain resulting from Ameri
can ant\-vni\at\on moves.

A combination chiefly ot ex
pensive imported oil and intense
business competition with West
German products in both
domestic and foreign markets
has brought on a recession, with
Bonn predicting a loss of up to 1
percent in West Germany's
gross national product this year.
Unemployment has already
passed by several hundred
thousand what last year had
been the psychological hurdle of
1 million jobless.
Scenario
The scenario most Bonn of
ficials favor for a recovery is
this. West Germany's his
torically low inflation rate (it
was still only 5.5 percent in 19801
and the basic competitiveness
of West German industry will,
by later this year, spark an up
swing in the economy and re
store international confidence
in the mark.
This seems, in fact, to be the
only scenario. Schmidt's ad
visers appear to hold no view
more imaginative, nor does this
one appear to be grounded in
anything more than hope.
In the long run, West Germa
ny's economic health will de
pend on some fundamental —
and politically torturous — ad
justments. It will depend on fin
ding other energy sources to re
place expensive imported oil. It
will depend on spurring lagging
productivity to keep com
petitive what is now one of the
highest-paid work forces in the
industrialized world. It will also
depend on Bonn's ability to pay
for the extensive network of so
cial supports it has constructed,
or alternatively, do away with
some of them.
But the Bonn coalition gov
ernment, beset now by bicker
ing within and between the So
cial Democratic and Free Dem
ocratic parties, is hardly in posi
tion to reach consensus on these
highly controversial issues.
Consequently, high U.S. interest
rates have become a convenient
target — and an outlet for airing
the general distress felt here.

Schmidt recently said in a ra
dio interview with the Sud
deutscher Rundfunk: "We still
need detailed talks with our
American friends on the fact
that we here in Europe cannot
endure American interest rates
remaining at the 20 percent
level. That forces us to keep our
interest rates at a level inap
