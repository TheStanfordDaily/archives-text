# Zimbabwe reforms economy
## 
### Washington Post 
Salisbury. Zimbabwe â€” The Zimbabwe gov
ernment last week announced a long-term eco
nomic policy designed to establish a socialist
society, but the statement appeared to present
little threat to the newly independent country's
white-dominated capitalist structure.
Bernard Chidzero, minister ot economic
planning and development, said at a news con
ference that the government intended "to es
tablish an egalitarian and socialist society un
der democratic conditions."
The 19-page policy statement was sharply
critical of the white-oriented economy estab
lished under nine decades of white-minority
government before blacks gained power last
year. It was clear, however, that the changes
envisaged are designed to modify the present
system rather than to carry out any wholesale
transformation.
The long-awaited policy declaration was one
more indication that despite maintaining the
rhetoric ot socialism. Prime Minister Robert
Mugabe, a Marxist, has no intention of rushing
toward his goal.
Socialism redefined
In some cases the government statement
seemed to be redefining socialism to mean
joint ventures involving the government and
domestic or foreign businesses.
"We want to see how the public and private
sectors can cross-fertilize and grow in harmo
ny," Chidzero said.
Chidzero said the rural economy would be a

key area tor implementation ot socialist poli
cies, citing plans to develop cooperatives and
state farms.
The statement declared that "no one should
enjoy absolute ownership' of land, but under
questioning Chidzero was careful to say this
did not mean the current system of privately
owned land would be changed.
Chidzero said government plans for com
munal resettlement were mainly aimed at
abandoned and under utilized property.
The investment section of the document con
tained this unsocialist sounding statement:
"Government will encourage and welcome the
participation of private enterprise in produc
tive activities which create employment op
portunities tor Zimbabweans and which make
a net contribution to the economy."
He has estimated that the three-year plan
will require about $6.4 billion in funds, about
halt ot which is expected to come from the
private sector.
The government says it expects to obtain
about 60 percent of the remainder from grants
and loans generated by a donor's conference to
be held later this month.
Citing past pledges of aid for a black-majori
ty government once independence was
achieved. Chidzero said last month that the
$300 million in assistance pledged "so far has
been very disappointing."
"Zimbabwe," he said, "needs a short,
sharp, massive injection of aid to solve its im
mediate problems."
