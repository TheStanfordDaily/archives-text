# University utility costs may double
## 
### J. Raymond Mills 
Costs for electricity and natural gas
may double by the 1984-85 school year,
according to University adminis
trators who are attempting to cut
long-term energy costs through per
manent changes in Stanford's energy
production and consumption.
Figures released recently by the
Stanford Energy Program, which
were consistent with estimates made
by the Department of Energy, the Cal
ifornia Energy Commission and the
California Public Utilities Com
mission, indicate that University
energy costs will reach $22.2 million
by 1984-85, compared to the $9.3 mil
lion expected to be paid this year.
These costs affect students directly,
as they are one of the major factors in
fluencing tuition increases.
Between fiscal years 1978-79 and
1980-81 purchased energy costs from
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) will
have increased by 73 percent, accord
ing to Energy Program Manager Lyn
da Weisberg.
"If electricity and natural gas
prices continue to escalate as they
have in the past, energy costs will
place an enormous drain on the Uni
versity's operating budget,"
Weisberg said.
University Energy Conservation
Center and Energy Program officials
are currently collaborating on an
"Energy Action Plan" that covers
projects intended to install permanent
technical modifications at the Central
Energy Facility (Stanford's gener
ator), as well as modifying the more
energy-intensive facilities on campus.
The plan also proposes an "extensive
monitoring and involvement in regu
latory proceedings governing price,
availability and restrictions on energy
supplies and production facilities,"
according to Weisberg.
Long-range forecasts predict that

most of the increase will come in the
next two years, due to the Reagan ad
ministration's early action to de
regulate oil prices, its announced in
tention to deregulate natural gas
before 1985, and an expectation that
Saudi Arabia will reduce oil produc
tion by as much as 50 percent in the
near future.
Furthermore, the forecast assumes
that inflation will continue at 10 per
cent annually and that Stanford's
energy consumption will remain
stable, with conservation offsetting
higher demand for newly-constructed
buildings and increased service to ex
isting structures.
The accuracy of the Energy Pro
gram's predictions depend a great
deal upon whether PG&E is successful
in a "highly experimental" effort to
encourage conservation rather than
increasing energy capacity, according
to Weisberg.
"Virtually no other public utility in
the country is basing its future ability
to meet demand so heavily on con
servation," Weisberg said. "If the
goals should not be met, PG&E will
have to increase its prices to reduce
demand and our costs will be even
more than currently anticipated."
Weisberg pointed out that PG&E
obtained permission from the Public
Utilities Commission to offer its cus
tomers interest-free loans to finance
the installation of insulation and other
energy-stingy devices designed to re
duce demand,
John Eaton, director of Stanford's
Energy Conservation Center (ECC)
said he is optimistic that a loan for $1.2
million that is forthcoming from the
Department of Housing and Urban De
velopment will enable the ECC to im
plement a number of energy-saving
projects expected to save the Univer
sity $250,000 annually. Since the ECC's
founding three years ago, energy use

in campus residences has been re
duced about 25 percent annually, as
compared to the 1976 "base year."
"Since Stanford is classified as an
'industrial user,' it pays more for utili
ties than residential customers,"
Eaton said, "The University must pay
an 'electrical demand charge' for
electricity use during peak usage' pe
riods, this accounts for about 25 per
cent of our total electrical costs."
Long range plans by the University
intended to reduce energy dependence
include an "ongoing study to examin
ing the feasibility of building a
cogeneration facility within the next
three to five years," Weisberg said.
Such a facility would provide two
forms of energy from one source by
using the steam produced when water
is heated for heating University build
ings.

the country is basing its future ability
to meet demand so heavily on con
servation," Weisberg said. "If the
goals should not be met, PG&E will
have to increase its prices to reduce
demand and our costs will be even
more than currently anticipated."
Weisberg pointed out that PG&E
obtained permission from the Public
Utilities Commission to offer its cus
tomers interest-free loans to finance
the installation of insulation and other
energy-stingy devices designed to re
duce demand,
John Eaton, director of Stanford's
Energy Conservation Center (ECC)
said he is optimistic that a loan for $1.2
million that is forthcoming from the
Department of Housing and Urban De
velopment will enable the ECC to im
plement a number of energy-saving
projects expected to save the Univer
sity $250,000 annually. Since the ECC's
founding three years ago, energy use

in campus residences has been re
duced about 25 percent annually, as
compared to the 1976 "base year."
"Since Stanford is classified as an
'industrial user,' it pays more for utili
ties than residential customers,"
Eaton said, "The University must pay
an 'electrical demand charge' for
electricity use during peak usage' pe
riods, this accounts for about 25 per
cent of our total electrical costs."
Long range plans by the University
intended to reduce energy dependence
include an "ongoing study to examin
ing the feasibility of building a
cogeneration facility within the next
three to five years," Weisberg said.
Such a facility would provide two
forms of energy from one source by
using the steam produced when water
is heated for heating University build
ings.

Costs for electricity and natural gas
may double by the 1984-85 school year,
according to University adminis
trators who are attempting to cut
long-term energy costs through per
manent changes in Stanford's energy
production and consumption.
Figures released recently by the
Stanford Energy Program, which
were consistent with estimates made
by the Department of Energy, the Cal
ifornia Energy Commission and the
California Public Utilities Com
mission, indicate that University
energy costs will reach $22.2 million
by 1984-85, compared to the $9.3 mil
lion expected to be paid this year.
These costs affect students directly,
as they are one of the major factors in
fluencing tuition increases.
Between fiscal years 1978-79 and
1980-81 purchased energy costs from
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) will
have increased by 73 percent, accord
ing to Energy Program Manager Lyn
da Weisberg.
"If electricity and natural gas
prices continue to escalate as they
have in the past, energy costs will
place an enormous drain on the Uni
versity's operating budget,"
Weisberg said.
University Energy Conservation
Center and Energy Program officials
are currently collaborating on an
"Energy Action Plan" that covers
projects intended to install permanent
technical modifications at the Central
Energy Facility (Stanford's gener
ator), as well as modifying the more
energy-intensive facilities on campus.
The plan also proposes an "extensive
monitoring and involvement in regu
latory proceedings governing price,
availability and restrictions on energy
supplies and production facilities,"
according to Weisberg.
Long-range forecasts predict that

most of the increase will come in the
next two years, due to the Reagan ad
ministration's early action to de
regulate oil prices, its announced in
tention to deregulate natural gas
before 1985, and an expectation that
Saudi Arabia will reduce oil produc
tion by as much as 50 percent in the
near future.
Furthermore, the forecast assumes
that inflation will continue at 10 per
cent annually and that Stanford's
energy consumption will remain
stable, with conservation offsetting
higher demand for newly-constructed
buildings and increased service to ex
isting structures.
The accuracy of the Energy Pro
gram's predictions depend a great
deal upon whether PG&E is successful
in a "highly experimental" effort to
encourage conservation rather than
increasing energy capacity, according
to Weisberg.
"Virtually no other public utility in
the country is basing its future ability
to meet demand so heavily on con
servation," Weisberg said. "If the
goals should not be met, PG&E will
have to increase its prices to reduce
demand and our costs will be even
more than currently anticipated."
