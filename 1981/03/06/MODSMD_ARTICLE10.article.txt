## 'Vietnam syndrome' forgotten too easily 
### 
President Ronald Reagan im
plores Americans to leave the
"Vietnam Syndrome" behind
us. Unfortunately, not only the
syndrome, but crucial lessons
from past conflicts are being
selectively forgotten. One such
lesson is that it is just plain bad
strategy for the U.S.to approach
every conflict overseas as a
struggle between Soviet ex
pansionism and U.S. resolve.
Another is mistaking friendly
rulers we prop up with the in
terests of the people they rule.
The people will ultimately pre
vail. And when they do, they
won't align with the blind bully
who opposed their struggle for
self-determination.
Yet the Domino School pre
dominates. Take El Salvador.
Instead of dealing with that
country based on its peculiar
history, culture and political
circumstances, our new macho
administration is posturing to
employ this embattled banana

republic as a staging area for a
"clear message" that the U.S.
can be counted on to defend any
regime willing to say it is anti-
Communist, however repres
sive.
Secretary of State Alexander
Haig assures us the issue is
black and white (and allegedly
red all over). The Soviet Com
mies are supplying arms via
their Cuban Commie surrogates
and their Sandinista Commie
clones. The jingoistic news
weeklies dutifully report the re
bellious villagers are "Marxist
guerrillas." Images of gun-tot
ing, red-hair baboons quoting
Lenin spring to mind. Mexico
might be next and Texans are
terrified Fidel's ambition is to
ride the mechanical bull at
Gilley's.
Of course the world is not so
simple. Even the press is grow
ing skeptical of State Depart
ment press releases. Harper's
Magazine, the nation's oldest

but far from most liberal maga
zine, sent one of its editors to El
Salvador for a first-hand ac
count. Harper's March cover
article, highly critical of U.S.
support of the murderous mili
tary government, began: "If
Christ landed at El Salvador's
new international airport. He
would be arrested before He
reached Aguilares. If inquiries
on the disappearance of the
Messiah were made ... a mem
ber of the ruling junta would ex
plain (Christ) had no doubt used
a false passport to enter the
country illegally, along with the
other Communists, Jesuits and
Sandinistas who were out to
destabilize progress in El
Salvador, thus imperiling U.S.
strategic interests in Central
America and subverting the en
tire free world."
The American editor asked
the "guerrillas" — poor, or
dinary villagers who had seen
loved ones beaten, raped and
murdered by state security
troops since the U.S.-sanctioned
military coup in 1979 — if they
had forsaken Christ to embrace
Marx.
"I do not know what Marx
did," one villager replied. "I
know Our Lord and Saviour
drove the Pharisees from the
temple when they desecrated
it."
The people knew nothing of
Marx or Cuba, but they all un
derstood what it meant to be a
revolutionary. "To be a revolu
tionary," one man explained,
"is to fight against the soldiers
who kill people who have com
mitted no crime."
Somehow the Carter State
Department was able to sustain
the image, bought by the media,
of a moderate, centrist junta
beseiged by terrorist forces of
the extreme left and right.
The fiction that El Salvador
was being ruled by moderate
centrists has been so successful
that the Reaganites dropped
criticisms of the right-wing en
tirely, dubbed the entire left and
center majority as Communist
puppets and pledged a virtually
unlimited commitment behind
preserving the military govern
ment. Should we call this con
servative reflex the "Iranian
syndrome," the courageous an
tithesis of guilt-induced moral
ism?
A government "dissent pa
per," written in November by
National Security Council and
CIA analysts and leaked to the
Boston Globe, suggested the

U.S. pressure the junta to ac
cept a Rhodesian-style solution,
turning power over to a respon
sible left-center left coalition.
As two experts sourly com
mented in the summer issue of
Foreign Affairs, "The centrists
are no longer in the center ...
The recently unified Left and
Center Left opposition includes
everyone but the government
and the far right," including the
Catholic Church, workers,
peasants and students.
Unfortunately, seeing the
world through red-tinted,
bipolar lenses tends to create
that reality. When the U.S. re
sponds as if every attempt to
change the status quo is a front
for monolithic Communism, the
only choice we leave alternative
claimants is Communist aid.
This stubborn division of the
world into Us and Them
deprives policy-makers of the
morally and strategically supe
rior option of embracing the
popular front in a revolutionary
society.
After our crippling of a mod
erate, middle-class alternative
to the Shah, it's a wonder that
the Ayatollah's Iran is not firm
ly tied to the Soviet camp. Ex
cept for the peculiar prejudices
of that mad medievalist, Iran
would have gone the way of
America's flawed loyalty to
Batista in Cuba, Chiang Kai
shek in China and Somoza in
Nicaragua — and it may yet.
A new instance of making
complex problems more dan
gerous by recasting them into a
simple Us vs. Them framework
is occurring in the Middle East.
Reagan has decided he does
not like the PLOand so, ipso fac
to, they must be communist
puppets. In fact, the PLO is in a
position similar to Israel itself
just prior to winning independ
ence in 1948. When the U.S. op
posed the creation of a Jewish
state, the Jews turned to Mos
cow for military and economic
aid.

By far the gravest strategic
blunder on the horizon is the at
tempt to win a long term ideol
ogical war with Soviets through
the chaos of superior military
deployment and bluster. His
torically, America's most pre
cious strategic asset is a robust,
self-sufficient economy.
Billions would be better in
vested in an Operation Energy
Independence, stressing con
servation and creating decen
tralized sources, than in Per
sian Gulf military bases and
Rapid Deployment Forces.
The gr-jatest weapon against
Soviet-style totalitarianism is
the U.S. model of general pros
perity and personal freedom.
American revolutionary ideals,
forgotten at home, have long
been a source of inspiration for
democratic revolutionary
movements. But today we
censure those progressive im
pulses around the world instead
of nurturing them, avoiding vio
lence and teaching by example.
Back at the ranch, Reagan in
sists: "The true lesson of the
Vietnam War (is): certainty of
purpose and ruthlessness of ex
ecution win wars."
But as Cowboy Ron saddles up
to lead the troops into one last
episode of Death Valley Days,
he might keep in mind the chill
ing prophecy of Mao Zedong, a
politician who produced a Com
munist nation of 900 million:
"The First World War was fol
lowed by the birth of the Soviet
Union with a population of 200
million. The Second World War
was followed by the emergence
of the socialist camp with a
combined population of 900 mil
lion. If the imperialists insist on
launching a third world war, it
is certain that several hundred
million more will turn to social
ism, and then there will not be
much room left on earth for the
imperialists."
