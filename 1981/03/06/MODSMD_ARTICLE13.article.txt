# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Dick Butterfield Need for understanding of ASSU 
### 
In the Daily article of Fri.,
Feb. 27. the headline talked of
the ASSU setting a new course.
Down go concerts, up comes El
Salvador. The ASSU — the poli
tics of student government and
the practicalities of student ser
vices are more complex and de
serve more explanation than
has been offered to date. The
two questions I am most fre
quently asked are, "Why can't
you provide me with concerts
(i.e. a bluegrass festival)?"
and, "Why don't you get in
volved in politics?" I would like
to answer these questions in the
context of my view of student
government; in other words.

from an ASSU perspective.
The ASSU is a political, stu
dent representative organiza
tion which also operates numer
ous student service projects. We
provide for and represent stu
dents by addressing their politi
cal concerns and by making life
a little easier through student
services. Specifically, the As
sociation is an elected Senate (a
political body), responsible for
appointing students to Univer
sity committees. We operate
numerous service projects:
Sunday Flicks, Guest Pro
fessorship Board, Lecture
Notes, the Coffee House and a
banking service for student or

ganizations. A Council of Presi
dents (a political body) over
sees and ensures the effective
and responsive operation of this
entire organization.
Student government at the
University can and should bal
ance the tension that exists be
tween being a political or
ganization and being a student
service organization. But today,
the balance is much different
than it was in the more active
years of Vietnam politics. In
those days, student government
was judged most responsive by
knowing where the political
crowd was going, and by waiting
there to lead the battle cry; peo
ple threw rocks at Tresidder
Union. They didn't care who
provided lecture notes or who
ran the food services (unless, of
course, the company invested in
South Africa).
Today, how different the
direction and the call of the
crowd is! The successful stu
dent government anticipates
and provides a completely dif
ferent type of leadership. The
successful leader waits with op
portunities for management
training, leadership develop
ment, and other practical, ca
reer-oriented avenues of partic
ipation. Students would rather
run advertising campaigns for
good music and cheap food than
for political rallies and sit-ins.
Students want more experience
and more service — cheaper
and faster. They are pressing
their way through the Univer
sity at $10,000 a shot and need all
the experience and resume
building they can get. Stopping
in White Plaza to listen about
South Africa, El Salvador or
clerical workers' unions is, to
some, a waste of precious time.
I'm all for student services:
such things as the Coffee House,
Recycling, T-Shirts, and the
Typing Service. The training
and experience students receive
in these is excellent. But, at the
same time, the Council of Presi
dents and the Senate are respon
sible as leaders of the ASSU for
identifying and asking us to con
sider political issues which are
important to us as world
citizens, U.S. citizens, Palo Alto
community members, Stanford
community members, dorm
mates, and housemates. To
move the democratic process,
we must join together.
We must belong to the student
coalition. It takes little memory
to recall how effective students
have been when united behind a
cause. The student today tends
to be offended when others en
croach on her or his personal
space and ask for participation
in the democratic process. We
are forgetting our responsibility
to democracy, to society, and to
each other as students.
The ASSU needs to provide a
political education, as well as to
foster opinions and actions con
cerning political issues both
close to home and far away.
Unionization of clerical work
ers, minority admissions, the
effect of federal budget cuts on
financial aid, rent control in
Palo Alto, and even El Salvador,
where the fate of our nation may
be decided by our actions, are
crucial issues. Allowing these
issues to be decided without us
is a crime against ourselves and

the very democratic process we
all cherish.
Why no bluegrass festival?
Besides the tact that ASSU was
in the business for ten years and
got burned nine out of ten years
(last year for $92,000), that we
do not have the professionalism
in house or potential for de
veloping it quickly, that the con
cert business is unsavory and
the pressures make student pro
moters twitch, it is not an ASSU
priority. We have only so much
time and energy to pursue both
student services and political |
enlightenment and activism. *
Concerts have dominated too
much of our time and energy. I
sincerely hope that some other
campus organization picks up
the concert business.
The ASSU is involved in the
development of an association
which has never before run a
Coffee House with gross reven
ues close to $700,000 per year
(more than the Transition). We
are improving the budgeting
processes for all student service
projects, hiring and training
new project managers, and
laying the groundwork for the
next group of students who will
run this association. They can
pursue projects like 1 reopening
the travel service, running a co
op store, providing for outdoor
equipment rental, household
goods exchange and the renova
tion and expansion of the Coffee
House and of Tresidder. We are
rejuvenating the Speakers' Bu
reau by featuring George Mc-
Govern and Bella Abzug. Plans
include a Spring series on Un
dergraduate Education in
America. Guest professors will
include Andre Burnett, David
Brower, and John Anderson.
The Senate and COP have
agreed to use some of their time
and resources to consider El
Salvador. The ASSU should reg
ularly facilitate discussions of
similar issues through Town
Hall forums similar to the one
put on about the draft and regis
tration last year. We are now
moving on matters close
to home: cost and availability of
housing, especially for graduate
students on campus, and minor
ity admissions and financial aid,
about which a coalition is in full
swing. If the student voice — the
student opinion — should shine
clear and true on any of these is
sues, we will push hard with the
legitimacy of student support.
This may mean press releases
and letters to representatives
stating a student position. It
may mean sit-ins in the Resi
dential Education office over
graduate students or theme
houses in the new dorms, or in
the Admissions Office over mi
nority admissions policies. But
to do this we need all individuals
to realize that they play an ac
tive role in shaping their future
here and that of future gener
ations of Stanford students.
The ASSU is an exciting and
dynamic organization which of
fers services and opportunities
for involvement and demands
that we take an active role in
considering and shaping our
future. Join it, acknowledge it,
at least try to understand it.

building they can get. Stopping
in White Plaza to listen about
South Africa, El Salvador or
clerical workers' unions is, to
some, a waste of precious time.
I'm all for student services:
such things as the Coffee House,
Recycling, T-Shirts, and the
Typing Service. The training
and experience students receive
in these is excellent. But, at the
same time, the Council of Presi
dents and the Senate are respon
sible as leaders of the ASSU for
identifying and asking us to con
sider political issues which are
important to us as world
citizens, U.S. citizens, Palo Alto
community members, Stanford
community members, dorm
mates, and housemates. To
move the democratic process,
we must join together.
We must belong to the student
coalition. It takes little memory
to recall how effective students
have been when united behind a
cause. The student today tends
to be offended when others en
croach on her or his personal
space and ask for participation
in the democratic process. We
are forgetting our responsibility
to democracy, to society, and to
each other as students.
The ASSU needs to provide a
political education, as well as to
foster opinions and actions con
cerning political issues both
close to home and far away.
Unionization of clerical work
ers, minority admissions, the
effect of federal budget cuts on
financial aid, rent control in
Palo Alto, and even El Salvador,
where the fate of our nation may
be decided by our actions, are
crucial issues. Allowing these
issues to be decided without us
is a crime against ourselves and

the very democratic process we
all cherish.
Why no bluegrass festival?
Besides the tact that ASSU was
in the business for ten years and
got burned nine out of ten years
(last year for $92,000), that we
do not have the professionalism
in house or potential for de
veloping it quickly, that the con
cert business is unsavory and
the pressures make student pro
moters twitch, it is not an ASSU
priority. We have only so much
time and energy to pursue both
student services and political |
enlightenment and activism. *
Concerts have dominated too
much of our time and energy. I
sincerely hope that some other
campus organization picks up
the concert business.
The ASSU is involved in the
development of an association
which has never before run a
Coffee House with gross reven
ues close to $700,000 per year
(more than the Transition). We
are improving the budgeting
processes for all student service
projects, hiring and training
new project managers, and
laying the groundwork for the
next group of students who will
run this association. They can
pursue projects like 1 reopening
the travel service, running a co
op store, providing for outdoor
equipment rental, household
goods exchange and the renova
tion and expansion of the Coffee
House and of Tresidder. We are
rejuvenating the Speakers' Bu
reau by featuring George Mc-
Govern and Bella Abzug. Plans
include a Spring series on Un
dergraduate Education in
America. Guest professors will
include Andre Burnett, David
Brower, and John Anderson.
The Senate and COP have
agreed to use some of their time
and resources to consider El
Salvador. The ASSU should reg
ularly facilitate discussions of
similar issues through Town
Hall forums similar to the one
put on about the draft and regis
tration last year. We are now
moving on matters close
to home: cost and availability of
housing, especially for graduate
students on campus, and minor
ity admissions and financial aid,
about which a coalition is in full
swing. If the student voice — the
student opinion — should shine
clear and true on any of these is
sues, we will push hard with the
legitimacy of student support.
This may mean press releases
and letters to representatives
stating a student position. It
may mean sit-ins in the Resi
dential Education office over
graduate students or theme
houses in the new dorms, or in
the Admissions Office over mi
nority admissions policies. But
to do this we need all individuals
to realize that they play an ac
tive role in shaping their future
here and that of future gener
ations of Stanford students.
The ASSU is an exciting and
dynamic organization which of
fers services and opportunities
for involvement and demands
that we take an active role in
considering and shaping our
future. Join it, acknowledge it,
at least try to understand it.

In the Daily article of Fri.,
Feb. 27. the headline talked of
the ASSU setting a new course.
Down go concerts, up comes El
Salvador. The ASSU — the poli
tics of student government and
the practicalities of student ser
vices are more complex and de
serve more explanation than
has been offered to date. The
two questions I am most fre
quently asked are, "Why can't
you provide me with concerts
(i.e. a bluegrass festival)?"
and, "Why don't you get in
volved in politics?" I would like
to answer these questions in the
context of my view of student
government; in other words.

from an ASSU perspective.
The ASSU is a political, stu
dent representative organiza
tion which also operates numer
ous student service projects. We
provide for and represent stu
dents by addressing their politi
cal concerns and by making life
a little easier through student
services. Specifically, the As
sociation is an elected Senate (a
political body), responsible for
appointing students to Univer
sity committees. We operate
numerous service projects:
Sunday Flicks, Guest Pro
fessorship Board, Lecture
Notes, the Coffee House and a
banking service for student or

ganizations. A Council of Presi
dents (a political body) over
sees and ensures the effective
and responsive operation of this
entire organization.
Student government at the
University can and should bal
ance the tension that exists be
tween being a political or
ganization and being a student
service organization. But today,
the balance is much different
than it was in the more active
years of Vietnam politics. In
those days, student government
was judged most responsive by
knowing where the political
crowd was going, and by waiting
there to lead the battle cry; peo
ple threw rocks at Tresidder
Union. They didn't care who
provided lecture notes or who
ran the food services (unless, of
course, the company invested in
South Africa).
Today, how different the
direction and the call of the
crowd is! The successful stu
dent government anticipates
and provides a completely dif
ferent type of leadership. The
successful leader waits with op
portunities for management
training, leadership develop
ment, and other practical, ca
reer-oriented avenues of partic
ipation. Students would rather
run advertising campaigns for
good music and cheap food than
for political rallies and sit-ins.
Students want more experience
and more service — cheaper
and faster. They are pressing
their way through the Univer
sity at $10,000 a shot and need all
the experience and resume
building they can get. Stopping

South Africa, El Salvador or

next group of students who will
run this association. They can
pursue projects like 1 reopening
the travel service, running a co
op store, providing for outdoor
equipment rental, household
goods exchange and the renova
tion and expansion of the Coffee
House and of Tresidder. We are
rejuvenating the Speakers' Bu
reau by featuring George Mc-
Govern and Bella Abzug. Plans
include a Spring series on Un
dergraduate Education in
America. Guest professors will
include Andre Burnett, David
Brower, and John Anderson.
The Senate and COP have
agreed to use some of their time
and resources to consider El
Salvador. The ASSU should reg
ularly facilitate discussions of
similar issues through Town
Hall forums similar to the one
put on about the draft and regis
tration last year. We are now
moving on matters close
to home: cost and availability of
housing, especially for graduate
students on campus, and minor
ity admissions and financial aid,
about which a coalition is in full
swing. If the student voice — the
student opinion — should shine
clear and true on any of these is
sues, we will push hard with the
legitimacy of student support.
This may mean press releases
and letters to representatives
stating a student position. It
may mean sit-ins in the Resi
dential Education office over
graduate students or theme
houses in the new dorms, or in
the Admissions Office over mi
nority admissions policies. But
to do this we need all individuals
to realize that they play an ac
tive role in shaping their future
here and that of future gener
ations of Stanford students.
The ASSU is an exciting and
dynamic organization which of
fers services and opportunities
for involvement and demands
that we take an active role in
considering and shaping our
future. Join it, acknowledge it,
at least try to understand it.
