## Leaders lobby for car import limits 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” Eight Re
publican governors, joined by
the Reagan administration's
secretary of transportation, are
to ask President Reagan today
to move immediately to nego
tiate a voluntary trade agree
ment with the Japanese that
would limit automobile imports
significantly.
Well-placed White House
sources said Reagan has made
no decision on the issue, which
has provoked one of the sharpest
internal battles of his young ad
ministration.
One source said the weight of
the internal argument appeared
to tilt toward those who favor an
import limitation to help the
hard-hit domestic auto in
dustry, but that the strong op
position of Office and Man
agement Budget Director David
Stockman has left the issue in
doubt.
Known to favor such an
agreement are Transportation
Secretary Drew Lewis, who
heads a task force that is to
make a formal recommenda
tion on the issue next week,
Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige and Labor Secretary

Raymond Donovan
The "free trade" oppositio.i,
led by Stockman. i.:c ides
Treasury Secretary Donald Re
gan and Murray
chairman of the Council of Eco
nomic Advisers.
Somewhere in *h' middle is
Bill Brock, the president's spe
cial trade representative, and
Secretary of State Alexander
Haig, who, in the words ot one
White House official, "has yet
to show his hand. '
Reagan has held one meeting
on the issue where both sides
strongly expressed their views.
A decision is considered likely
next week, al\er another White
House meeting presided over by
Reagan.
The governors are to press for
the import agreement in their
White House meeting today.
They also are to seek a new 10
percent tax credit, one year de
preciation of hand tools instead
of the two years now allowed,
and a 20 percent tax credit for
research and development.
The group is chaired by Gov.
William Milliken of Michigan,
the state where the impact of
Japanese automobile imports
has been felt most strongly.

t-ie governors are expected
out to Reagan that Eu
ropean countries have limited
the import of Japanese cars and
argue that the U.S. industry de
serves similiar protection
Historically. Reagan has
been a free-trader. But during
the election campaign, while in
Michigan, he promised to help
the auto industry, and aides in
dicated he favored a voluntary
agreement
There is some feeling in the
White House that the Japanese
are more receptive to such an
agreement than they have ever
been
While no specific numbers
have been agreed upon, the bet
ting in the White House is that
the target would be between 1.4
million and 1.6 million Japanese
cars a vear. Currently, the im

port level is 1.9 million cars a
year.
In this week's Cabinet-level
meeting. Regan argued that
there was no need for an import
agreement because the U.S.
auto industry was expected to
make between $3 billion and $4
billion in profits this year
This figure was derided by ad
vocates of the agreement, and
Treasury officials subsequently
acknowledged that their num
bers were wrong and that the in
dustry stands to have profits of
no more than $1 billion, if that.
There is growing protec
tionist sentiment in Congress
for some sort of limitation on
auto imports, but it is con
sidered unlikely that legislation
on mandatory quotas would
pass if the president opts to seek
a voluntary agreement.
