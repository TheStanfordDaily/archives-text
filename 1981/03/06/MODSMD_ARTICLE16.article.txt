# Treasury to assist troubled savings industry
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — A contingency
aid package for the troubled
savings and loan industry is
being prepared by the Reagan
administration and will be
ready within a couple of weeks,
Secretary of the Treasury
Donald Regan said Wednesday.
"We're going to be standing
on the dock with a life pre
server," Regan said in an in
terview. "Whether or not we
have to throw it remains to be
seen ... but they're not drown
ing at this point. We know
they're in troubled times and we

stand ready to help il they get
into dire straits."
Surging interest rates in re
cent months have created a fi
nancial squeeze at many sav
ings and loan associations, rais
ing fears of bankruptcies, par
ticularly among some ot the
smaller institutions in the East.
The savings associations have
had to pay as much as 15 percent
interest on savings to obtain an
adequate flow of deposits, as
savers have turned in droves to
competing, high-yield invest
ments such as money-market
mutual tunds.
But many of the older mort

gages held by savings and loans
carry interest rates far below
the current rates tor home
loans, which average 14 percent
nationally. As a result of that
squeeze, earnings at savings
and loans have plummeted, and
some have been losing money.
"You can't go on forever
paying 15 percent interest rates
(on savings) with 9 percent or 10
percent mortgages," said Den
nis Jacoby. an economist for the
U.S. League ot Savings Associa
tions. "That's squeezing a lot ot
small institutions."
Regan said that estab
lishment of reserve require

ments for money market funds
— requiring them to set aside a
portion of the money deposited
with them the way banks and
savings associations must do
and thus closing the gap on
yields somewhat — was being
considered as one possible way
of easing the competitive pres
sures.
"We're in discussions with
the Federal Reserve and we're
studying that," Regan said.
Reward for thrift
The Treasury also is examin
ing a proposal to exempt the
first $1000 of savings in a thrift
institution from federal income
tax, Regan said. He questioned,
however, whether such a tax
break would actually increase
savings or just provide a wind
fall for those who already had
money in such deposits.
Regan also said he doubted
that creation of tax-exempt sav
ings certificates — another pro
posed remedy for the savings
and loan industry — would be a
good solution because it would
set a precedent for other groups
to demand similar tax breaks.
As for another industry pro
posal to swap older mortgages
with relatively low interest
rates for government secur
ities, Regan was aghast at the
possible cost of many billion
dollars.
"That boggles the mind . . .
there's no way that can be
done," he said. "Whether there
is some way that we could infuse
funds into a thrift institution
that really needs an injection of
capital of some type — that is
the type of thing we can con

sider."
Mortgage interest ceiling
On a related housing issue,
Regan said that the Treasury
was studying a variety of pro
posals to place a ceiling on the
amount of mortgage interest
that can be deducted on federal
income tax returns by owners of
"mansions" or homes in addi
tion to a primary residence.
"It's usually called the man
sion cap,' " Regan said. "Some
one buys a home worth $1 mil
lion in Beverly Hills and bor
rows $900,000 on it. Should the
whole interest on that $900,000
be tax-exempt?
"A person buys a second
home, for pleasure, at a beach,
in the mountains, in the desert.
Should the interest on that
(mortgage) be tax-exempt?"
Regan emphasized that the
Treasury was "not considering
this, we are just studying it
out."
He said the tax deduction for
mortgage interest should not be
tampered with lightly because
of the number of workers em
ployed in construction and the
demand for new homes.
Denies 'conventional wisdom'
Regan said he did not agree
with the "conventional wis
dom" in Washington that Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's proposal
for a three-year tax cut of near
ly 30 percent was going to be al
tered considerably by Congress.
"The (tax) bill itself is not at
the Hill," Regan said. "To kiss
something off before it's seen
the light of day is not wisdom.
We haven't had our push against
their shove."
