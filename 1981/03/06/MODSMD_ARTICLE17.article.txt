# Jewish religious feud erupts

New York (AP) â€” A religious war has erupted
in the streets of Brooklyn, pitting Jew against Jew
in a brick-throwing dispute over whether the state
of Israel should exist and when the messiah will
come.
The combatants are unlikely urban warriors:
black-clad ultra-Orthodox members of rival re
ligious sects, the Belz and the Satmar. Each sub
scribes to a Jewish tradition known as Hasidism.
which emphasizes mysticism, ecstasy and a
strong belief in the coming of the messiah.
Even though some of them live there, the Sat
mars refuse to recognize the state of Israel, deny
ing that there can be a Jewish state before the
messiah comes, which Jews believe has not yet
happened. The Belzers recognize Israel, and are
said to feel that the creation of a Jewish state may
even speed the messiah's coming.
The simmering dispute recently became vi
olent, bringing heavy police patrols to the
Brooklyn streets where the Hasidim have carved
out a culturally separate community rooted in
their 19th century Eastern European origins.
Some 400 police officers were dispatched to the

neighborhood Tuesday after threats were made
against the life of the Grand Rabbi of Belz, who is
on a two-week visit from Israel to mark the 30th
anniversary of the founding of Belz institutions in
the United States.
There was no violence as Rabbi Yisucher Dov
Rokeach, guarded by a phalanx of police and se
curity men, met followers at a Brooklyn school.
He is revered as the only surviving heir of the
founder of the 200-year-old sect, which began in
the Polish town of Belz, now in the Soviet Union.
On Sunday night, police responded to a rock
throwing attack on a Belz synagogue by some 500
jeering Hasidim. Witnesses alleged the attackers
were Satmars protesting Rokeach's visit.
"It's like the Hatfields and the McCoys," said
Officer Steve Bonomolo.
The Satmars denied responsibility for the at
tack or threats against Rokeach.
Each sect claims 100.000 adherents worldwide,
a figure observers believe exaggerated in both
cases. The Belz are more numerous than the Sat
mar in Israel; the Satmar have more adherents in
New York.
