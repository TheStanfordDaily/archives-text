# Automobile rebates spur car sales boom
## 
### 
Detroit (AP) — Stimulated by
industry-wide cash rebate pro
grams refunding hundreds of
dollars to each buyer, U.S. auto
makers registered their best
sales period in nearly two years
in late February, the industry
reported Wednesday.
Analysts, however, have ex
pressed concern that sales could
once again plummet when the
rebate programs end in two
weeks. Cash incentive pro
grams have historically been
followed by downturns in sales
because customers are "bor
rowed" from the future by com
panies anxious for a quick up
turn in business.
Domestic sales for the entire
month of February were off
only 4.2 percent from the year
ago period, one of the smallest
year-to-year declines in recent
months. On a seasonally ad
justed annual rate basis, the
domestic industry sales pace
was 7.4 million in February, the
highest level in a year. The sales
rate lor the \O-dav selling period
was 8.9 million, the highest
since March 1979, when the gas
oline shortage began and led to
the industry's worst depression
in 30 years.
"I'm not naive enough to
think that the momentum will
keep going at this same rate
when the program ends," said
Robert Burger, vice president
of marketing at General Mo
tors. "But it will be at a rate
substantially higher than before
the program began."'
GM announced Feb. 18 that it
would pay rebates of $500 to $700
to buyers of some of its most
popular small and mid-sized
cars in hopes of stimulating
sales and pulling the industry
out of its downturn Ford Motor
Company quickly followed with
rebates of 10 percent on most of
its compact and mid-size cars,
and Chrysler Corporation, said

it would extend its own 6 percent
rebate program, which had
begun in December.
Immediate increase
GM officials said that the re
bates led to an immediate in
crease in sales and that the com
pany set a sales record in the
final selling period of February,
with sales up 27.1 percent from
the year-ago period.
However, Ford sales were off
2 percent from a year ago, in
dicating that its dealers were
squeezed by the increased com
petition with GM.
Chrysler sales were up 47 per
cent during the final February
sales period, and analysts sug
gested that the sharp increase
could have been caused by final
approval of the company's fed
eral loan guarantees in late Feb
ruary as well as by the rebate
programs.
Import sales increase
Import dealers sold 217,800
cars in February, an increase of
4.3 percent from a year ago. Im
port sales had been dampened
by record interest rates in pre
vious months, but rebounded in
February as the cost of financ
ing a car began to ease with low
er interest rates. Toyota sales
were up 1.4 percent after a 28.6
percent decline in January, and
Datsun sales were down 3.7 per
cent, compared to a 29.7 percent
decline the previous month.
Analysts said that the robust
sales in the final period of Feb
ruary would have to continue
well into March to keep the mar
ket moving and lead to the long
awaited industry recovery.
"I think the rebates were
working." one Wall Street ana
lyst said. "The real question is
when they come off. do sales go
down below where they would
have been otherwise. Maybe
we're just sucking April car
buyers into February and
March."

Import dealers sold 217,800
cars in February, an increase of
4.3 percent from a year ago. Im
port sales had been dampened
by record interest rates in pre
vious months, but rebounded in
February as the cost of financ
ing a car began to ease with low
er interest rates. Toyota sales
were up 1.4 percent after a 28.6
percent decline in January, and
Datsun sales were down 3.7 per
cent, compared to a 29.7 percent
decline the previous month.
Analysts said that the robust
sales in the final period of Feb
ruary would have to continue
well into March to keep the mar
ket moving and lead to the long
awaited industry recovery.
"I think the rebates were
working." one Wall Street ana
lyst said. "The real question is
when they come off. do sales go
down below where they would
have been otherwise. Maybe
we're just sucking April car
buyers into February and
March."
