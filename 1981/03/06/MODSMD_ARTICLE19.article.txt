## Forum warns of European alliance rift U.S. defense posture worries NATO 
### Washington Post 
Munich — A wide gulf in public opinion
separates the United States from signifi
cant sections of Western Europe on the need
now for massive defense spending increases
and the advisability of renewed arms limi
tation negotiations with the Soviet Union
As President Ronald Reagan appears
ready to squeeze social programs to help
balloon the U.S. defense budget, key West
European politicians say they have no man
date from their voters to do the same, and
consequently show reserve toward the
sharper calls from Washington for boosts in
their own military efforts.
Trying to bridge this Atlantic gap. U.S. of
ficials now speak of the Reagan adminis
tration's intention to "lead by example'' —
to demonstrate first that the United States
is determined to do what is necessary to
fund defense even though doing so hurts, and
then to urge that the European allies do like
wise.

Mews analysis

If public opinion happens to contrast with
that in America, Reagan officials suggest
that European opinion should be changed —
through open discussion and public educa
tion campaigns underlining the more men
acing Soviet threat today not only toward
Western Europe but around the world, espe
cially in view of Western military deficien
cies that have been allowed to develop.
Cool response
This message is just beginning to roll
through West European capitals, and the in
itial European response predictably has
been cool.
Having welcomed Reagan's election last
autumn for the consistency and coherence
that it was hoped the new president would
bring to U.S. foreign policy, West European
officials now are concerned about the poten
tial spillover to this continent of Washing

ton's tougher stance toward Moscow and
heavy emphasis or. military spending four
weeks after the inauguration
Pointing to their own hard-pressed econo
mies. which individually ire much less
shock-resistant than America's — although
together they exceed the gross national
product of the United States — the West Eu
ropeans claim to have ICss economic ma
neuvering room than Washington to in
crease defense expenditures.
While saying they are prepared to take up
a greater share of the existing defense
burden in the European theater, the West
Europeans would prefer to do this by im
proving efficiency — that is. by getting
more for their defense marks or pounds
rather than by spending more of them.
On top of this, answering the Reagan ad
ministration's call for a more realistic ap
proach to East-West relations, the Europe
an allies say they had never been naive, and
the Bonn government in particular con
tinues to argue that cooperative ties with
the Soviet Union are essential for stability
in Europe.
Regarding one of the most central
strategic questions for the Western alliance
— namely, how to restore the East-West
military balance in Europe — the Reagan
administration contends that a buildup of
arms in the West is first necessary in order
to gain bargaining leverage over the Sovi
ets. while the West Europeans, doubtful
about ever catching up with Moscow's mili
tary edge in the European theater, urge that
renewed arms limitation talks get under
way immediately.
Priorities
These differences in political priorities
and public mood were highlighted during a
weekend of honest discussion between high
level officials and defense experts from a
number of Atlantic Alliance countries. This
annual forum, sponsored by a private group
in Munich, has served traditionally as a
bellwether for the themes and tones to come
in alliance relations.
The challenge put to Europe was to get
alongside the United States. But the worry
voiced by some West Europeans is that the
United States will get too far ahead and then

pull hard tor Europe to catch up. failing to
appreciate the contrast in political demands
and economic strengths.
On the one side, Western Europe has been
nudged into considering a more coordinated
— if still informal — effort to extend the
military, diplomatic and economic
bulwarks of the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization beyond Europe to strategic zones
in order to protect sources of important
minerals and oil and to counter instability in
the Third World.
In turn. Washington officials readily ac
knowledge the need for improved consulta
tion and flexibility in dealing with the Eu
ropeans. and have adopted the concept of a
"division of labor" within the alliance that
was pressed on Washington by West Ger
man officials following the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.
To bring Europe into step with Reagan's
priorities will be a more formidable task,
however, requiring more sensitivity to Eu
ropean political sensibilities than the new
U.S. administration has shown and a
greater willingness to sacrifice tlian the
West Europeans have volunteered.
One thing made clear to the U.S. officials
who came to Munich was that it no longer is
enough — in fact, it may be coun
terproductive — for a West European politi
cian to ask his country to do something be
cause it would be pro-American. "We must
tell our voters what we do is in our in
terest," declared Horst Ehmke, a leading
Social Democratic member of the West
German Bundestag.
Ehmke said further that how America be
haves towards Latin America would
critically affect European opinion, warning
that a U.S. military intervention would
bring a wave of anti-Americanism particu
larly among European youth.
The European contrast with the United
States also differs in degree, depending on
the specific country involved. In France,
the public is more inclined toward an in
creased defense budget. In Britain, there is
not the same interest in detente as there is
in West Germany, where perhaps the public
mood is most sharply at odds with the
American attitude.
