# Faculty Senate may move pass/fail deadline, include 'F's on transcripts

### Kathy Bodovitz 
The deadline for choosing to take a
class pass/no credit may be moved up
to the third Friday of the quarter and
the University may go back to "tradi
tional" transcripts on which failing
grades are included, pending approval
by the Faculty Senate.
Mathematics Prof. Mary Sunseri
explained to the Faculty Senate yes
terday that the Committee on Aca
demic Appraisal and Achievement
discussed two different conceptions of
the role of the student-elected
pass/fail option."On one conception it
is a fail-safe option, available to the
student who has received a clear in
dication (through a mid-term grade)
that he or she is not doing well in a
course. On the second conception it
makes it easier for a student to plan at
the beginning of the quarter, to take a
course in a new or challenging area of
the University without incurring a se
rious risk of a low grade. "
The consensus of the committee,
and the senate, was that only the sec
ond role was appropriate. Sunseri said
the first role encourages students not
to take their course commitments se
riously, and contributes to the idea
that every student should have a tran
script composed entirely of "A s" and
"B's."
The committee also disapproves of
the present rule that a student may
drop a class up to the time of the final
exam because "it seems to teach stu
dents that when they do something
badly they can just drop it without in
curring any real penalty," Sunseri
said. Thus they proposed an earlier
deadline, perhaps during the seventh

week of the quarter, for dropping a
course.
To do this, the committee decided
the University would need to return to
a transcript on which failing grades
and courses dropped without proper
authorization would be recorded.
The senate instructed the commit
tee to pursue its proposals and submit
a recommendation to be voted on next
quarter.
While most senate members
seemed to approve of the proposal,
some disagreed. Associate Political
Science Professor David Abernethy
noted, "The merit of the kind of tran
script we have is that it creates a less
fiercely competitive atmosphere here
and is conducive to learning for its
own sake."
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth said he believes the
transcript should help serve the stu
dents, not teach lessons of life. "Pre
venting students from dropping
courses is unnecessarily punitive," he
said.
Another aspect of grading that was
discussed was the "unsettling prac
tice" of awarding so many A sand
B's. The committee report said that
throughout a ten year period approx
imately 70 percent of the grades
awarded at Stanford were either "A"
or "B" and more than half of these
were "A." The report noted "one re
sult of such a high percentage of A
grades is that it becomes increasingly
difficult to distinguish the exceptional
from the good student on the basis of
the transcript."
Professor Jack Friedenthal, who is
in charge of admissions in the Law

School, gave the committee an exam
ple of the problem. Of Stanford stu
dents who took recent Law School Ap
titude Tests, 34 percent had a GPA of
3.6 or higher. This bunching at the top
of the grade spectrum makes it very
difficult for law schools to make de
cisions on the basis of the transcript,
and necessitates an increased reliance
on Law School Aptitude Test scores.
