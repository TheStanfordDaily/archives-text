# Israel claims assurances on Mideast peace initiative
## 
### Washington Post 
Jerusalem — Despite British and French in
terpretations to the contrary. Israel says it has re
ceived assurances in "plain language" from Presi
dent Ronald Reagan that the United States remains
unalterably opposed to a European Middle East
peace initiative outside the Camp David peace ac
cords.
Israel's Foreign Ministry director-general. David
Kimche. said Tuesday in an interview that the Brit
ish foreign secretary. Lord Carrington, and French
Foreign Minister Jean Francois-Poncet, in their re
cent meetings with Reagan administration officials,
appear to have read into U.S. statements what they
wanted to hear.
"We were told in very, very plain language by the
president and other officials that the United States
does not see any alternative to the Camp David
agreements. They hope the agreements can be ex
panded, deepened and added to, but the European in
itiative is not conducive to the continuation of Camp
David. This we were told in the plainest language."
Kimche said.
He said Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir re
ceived such assurances from Reagan and Secretary
of State Alexander Haig during his recent visit to
Washington and that the assurances have been re
peated through other diplomatic channels.
(The White House, queried about Kimche's decla
ration, declined comment.)

Since visits to Washington by Lord Carrington,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
Francois-Poncet, reports from London and Paris
have indicated a shift in the Reagan administration
position to the point where U.S. hostility toward an
independent European initiative in the Middle East
— strong under the Carter administration — has
diminished. Reagan also was reported to have in
dicated that the United States intends to move slow
ly on Camp David, thereby giving the Common Mar
ket countries an opening to pursue their own peace
plan at least until Israeli elections scheduled for
June 30.
Israeli fears of such a move were fueled by dis
closure of a secret Common Market working paper
that raises a number of options comprising a call for
Israel to withdraw from all Arab territory occupied
since 1967. including East Jerusalem, to make room
tor Palestinian self-determination. Israeli officials
also have been concerned by intensified European
pressure on the United States to approve such an in
itiative.
But Kimche said Reagan and Haig's assurances
alleviated most of these fears.
So far, the Reagan administration's main pro
nouncements on the Middle East have been observa
tions that regional disputes, such as the Arab-Israeli
conflict, demand less urgent attention than the
broader East-West, confrontation. Moreover, the
Reagan administration has indicated it is not in
terested in resuming the stalled negotiations on

West Bank and Gaza autonomy until after the Israeli
general elections.
Reagan, Kimche noted, is primarily interested in
preventing any expansion of Soviet influence in the
Middle East. Since the European initiative could
bring the Soviets into the peace process, he added, it
is unlikely to curry favor with Reagan. Moreover, he
said. British and French suggestions of dealing with
the Palestine Liberation Organization, which has
close ties to the Soviet Union, would probably dis
courage Reagan interest in the European initiative.
The Common Market working paper does not spe
cifically mention the PLO, but prescribes conditions
that could result in a PLO-led Palestinian state.
Kimche conceded that the European effort to
work outside the Camp David framework will prob
ably intensify in July, when Britain takes charge of
diplomacy for the European Economic Community.
But he said Israel will remain unmoved.
"The Europeans can shout from morning to night
that we have to withdraw, and if we don't withdraw,
their shouting won't make any difference, will it?"
Kimche said.
He noted that Britian and France are the most ag
gressive advocates of the European initiative, and
that it was not surprising to him that a "senior
French Foreign Ministry source," in a briefing Mon
day with Paris-based Israeli journalists, said that
France would not contribute troops to a proposed Si
nai peacekeeping force because that would suggest
French support for Camp David.
