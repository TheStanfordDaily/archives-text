# Saudi Arabia—rising star of Gulf
## 
### Washington Post 
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia —
Buoyed by its enhanced leader
ship role in the Islamic nations'
organization, Saudi Arabia is
reaching out to assert power in
the Persian Gulf where the de
bilitating Iranian-Iraqi war has
deepened the sense of a power
vacuum.
The foreign ministers of six
Arab sheikdoms and kingdoms
— Saudi Arabia, Kuwait. Qatar,
Bahrain, Oman and the United
Arab Emirates — met here last
month and laid plans for a Gulf
Cooperation Council that some
hope will lead to a pact aimed at

protecting the vital oil-export
ing region and keeping out for
eign powers.
The meeting came only days
after Saudi Arabia hosted lead
ers of 38 Moslem nations who
unanimously asserted that the
security, peace and stability of
the gulf is the "exclusive re
sponsibility" of the nations in
the region.
But conflicting notions among
participants about the ultimate
objectives of the embryonic
council, plus the absence from
the meeting of Iraq — militarily
the most powerful Arab gulf
state — have already raised se
rious questions about the ability
of the sheikdoms and kingdoms
alone to shoulder such a burden.
Furthermore, none of the six
countries has more than a sym
bolic navy or a small air and
land force, casting grave doubts
on even their combined military
ability to play the role of guard
ian over the Western world's vi
tal oil lanes through the gulf.
Experts from the six nations
plan to meet again in Muscat
next month to work out the de
tails of their council and pre
pare for a subsequent summit to
formally launch the program.
By that time, it may become
clearer whether the scheme
holds any potential for estab
lishing a credible gulf security
system or will simply limit
itself to the coordination of eco
nomic and other policies.
Defense pact
For the moment, the six con
stituent members of the council
are playing down the idea of a
gulf defense pact, reportedly
partly out of fear of provoking
Iran. Another reason, however,
is their obvious differences
about what military ties, if any,
they should maintain with the
Western powers.

Two of the six, Oman and
Bahrain, already are providing
the United States military with
facilities, the former having
signed an access agreement for
the Rapid Deployment Force
and the latter a commercial
port accord for the Navy's
Middle East Force.
The other four, however, have
eschewed such public ties. Sev
eral, including Saudi Arabia,
have repeatedly denounced the
idea of providing bases, or facil
ities, in the gulf to U.S. or any
other outside forces. The Saudi 1
foreign minister, Prince Saud,
describes Western, particularly
American, bases and facilities
as "lightning rods" serving only
to provoke the Soviets into ob-'
taining equivalent rights in the
region and thus accelerating the'
two superpowers' race for in
fluence in the gulf.
Ambiguities
Saudi Arabia reflects amply
all the ambiguities of policy and
attitudes shared by the other
Arab gulf states outside Iraq.
The oil and financial pow
erhouse of the region, it has,
nonetheless, found itself just as
vulnerable as the smaller
sheikdoms to the new pressures
generated throughout the region
by the Iranian fundamentalist
Moslem revolution, the Soviet
occupation in nearby Afghan
istan and the U.S. Rapid Deploy
ment Force.
Under pressure as well from
Iraq, which wants to eliminate
all superpower influence from
the gulf, the kingdom has sought
to reaffirm its security by tak
ing its distance — particularly
in public — from the United
States while casting about for
some Islamic or regional group
ing capable of offering protec
tion from the renewed Soviet-
American cold war closing in on
the region.

Defense pact
For the moment, the six con
stituent members of the council
are playing down the idea of a
gulf defense pact, reportedly
partly out of fear of provoking
Iran. Another reason, however,
is their obvious differences
about what military ties, if any,
they should maintain with the
Western powers.

Two of the six, Oman and
Bahrain, already are providing
the United States military with
facilities, the former having
signed an access agreement for
the Rapid Deployment Force
and the latter a commercial
port accord for the Navy's
Middle East Force.
The other four, however, have
eschewed such public ties. Sev
eral, including Saudi Arabia,
have repeatedly denounced the
idea of providing bases, or facil
ities, in the gulf to U.S. or any
other outside forces. The Saudi 1
foreign minister, Prince Saud,
describes Western, particularly
American, bases and facilities
as "lightning rods" serving only
to provoke the Soviets into ob-'
taining equivalent rights in the
region and thus accelerating the'
two superpowers' race for in
fluence in the gulf.
Ambiguities
Saudi Arabia reflects amply
all the ambiguities of policy and
attitudes shared by the other
Arab gulf states outside Iraq.
The oil and financial pow
erhouse of the region, it has,
nonetheless, found itself just as
vulnerable as the smaller
sheikdoms to the new pressures
generated throughout the region
by the Iranian fundamentalist
Moslem revolution, the Soviet
occupation in nearby Afghan
istan and the U.S. Rapid Deploy
ment Force.
Under pressure as well from
Iraq, which wants to eliminate
all superpower influence from
the gulf, the kingdom has sought
to reaffirm its security by tak
ing its distance — particularly
in public — from the United
States while casting about for
some Islamic or regional group
ing capable of offering protec
tion from the renewed Soviet-
American cold war closing in on
the region.
