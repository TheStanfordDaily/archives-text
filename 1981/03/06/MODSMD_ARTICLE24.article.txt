tion. Next, he might be covering
a speech in some auditorium on

this man is. or where this walk

ing source of information about
Stanford University can be
found
As director of the Stanford
University News Service. Bob
Beyers has something ol an un
usual job He controls the in
formation that will be given out
to important newspapers, na
tion-wide magazines and local
television stations in the form of
Stanford news releases.

The News Service has re
ceived its share of publicity off
campus. Among others, the
Wall Street ■Journal. the Lon
don Times Higher Education
Supplement, the < hronivle of
Higher Education and ' hanfie
magazine have published what
Beyers described as "quite
complimentary" articles on
him and the organization he
directs.
Calmly and with the slightest
tinge of pride. Beyers narrates
the many stories he has about
the accomplishments of the
News Service.
"Milliscent Dillon, a staff
member, was the first to write
about the research being done
on the Holocaust and the first to
cover born again Christians
Both of these subjects later
gained national attention
through the news releases on
them "
"Our coverage of a state
grant to the Gay People's Union
on campus in the late '60s
spurred The Men York Times to
bring national attention to gays
on college campuses."
Linus Pauling's research on
vitamin C was first covered by
the news releases. Beyers said
Beyers's tone of voice
changes, however, when he
talks about the times the re
leases have been ignored.
A microscope based on sound
waves was developed here at
Stanford and was covered by the
News Service. However, Beyers
said, "no American companies
showed interest in the idea. The

Japanese and the Germans
picked it up off a magazine arti
cle based on our release and are
now developing the micro
scope
"1 cannot stress enough the
importance oi a nuclear fuel re
cycling system developed by
faculty members and patented
by the University.'' Beyers
said Yet this idea bas been
"virtually ignored despite the
coverage made by the releases
Beyers, in addition to selling
articles to the major media,
also determines which stories,
based on news releases, will ap
pear in such campus publica
tions as The Stanford < Ibserrrr
and the Campus Report The
Daily and KZSU rely to some ex
tent on the news releases as
sources tor stories
Beyers' small otfice. located
in the News and Publications
building, consists ot a large
desk, a couple of chairs, and a
smaller desk with a typewriter
— all surrounded by walls lined
with shelves
A computer terminal sits
beside the typewriter, and clut
tered stacks of papers, maga
zines and newspapers cover the
main desk. The man behind the
desk must somehow deal with
large amounts of information
Asked whether he worries
about not being recognized by
the thousands who read either
his material or the material he
has organized, Beyers is quick
to reply: "What is tar more im
portant than recognition is the
freedom we have to report wide
ly"
"Our purpose is to bring out
ideas. Nevertheless, we need
the freedom to deal with all sub
jects and to support or talk
about whoever we want to. The
constrictions are. in fact, few.
Now. whether the ideas or opin
ions get accepted or not is of lit
tle relevance, though we cer
tainly hope the public will un
derstand them and react in
some way."
Beyers' job is unique. A lot of
energy must be put into organiz
ing and directing the trans
mission of news as well as deal
ing with news media. Beyers
says he believes in being out of
the otfice as much as possible.
But it's that unexpected call or
message about some new occur
rence that keeps his job varied.

Bob Beyers, director of the Stanford University News Service, controls the news given to newspapers,
nationwide magazines, and local television stations. Beyers, somewhat of a Stanford institution in
himself, is literally a "walking source of information."
