# Daily financial statement
## 
### 
As has been the practice of
the Daily for the past several
years, we are publishing a
statement of our finances for
the community's information.
In 1974-75, when the Daily
first became independent of the
University and the ASSU, it
almost experienced
bankruptcy. To ensure the Dai
ly's continued survival, it was
decided that the Daily ac
cumulate a cash reserve fund
equal to one-third of its annual
operating budget to cushion it
against economic instability. It
was to this end that the Daily set
aside its surpluses during the
years when it showed a profit,
from 1975-76 to 1979-80.
But despite the fact that we
have made $192,800 during the
past five years, the Daily's fi
nancial outlook is mitigated by a
major capital investment we
made in typesetting equipment.
The typesetters in use last year
had proven to be in need of re
placement; the production fa
cilities we were using were no
longer reliable enough for a dai
ly newspaper.
Of the alternatives before the
Daily, the Daily Board of Direc
tors chose a video display termi

nal (VDT) system that enables
reporters' stories and wire ser
vice copy to be typeset without
having to be retyped into type
setting machines. This entailed
an expenditure of some
$200,000; part of this was fi
nanced from our reserve fund,
and part of it with a $130,000
three-year loan from the Uni
versity.
The capital investment we
made, while it was necessary
and is expected to cut the Dai
ly 's typesetting costs some
what, has put us in a weaker
position tor the coming three
years while we pay back the
loan at a rate ot $52,000 per year.
While we could have taken out
a smaller loan, the nature of the
Daily's business — immediate
payment for expenses incurred,
but deferred income from ad
vertisers billed — makes a re
serve fund on paper less useful
than ready cash. Autumn Quar
ter in particular is a difficult
time for the Daily, because we
publish very large papers, have
to pay our production costs
within a few weeks, but often do
not receive payment for the ad
vertisements until winter.
Nonetheless, the Daily is in

an adequate position financial
ly. We have been running a
slightly more austere operation
this year. We are publishing pa
pers that have a slightly higher
percentage of advertising, to
the extent that we can do so
without compromising the news
coverage the Stanford com
munity deserves. We have ex
panded our circulation into Palo
Alto, first on University Avenue
and possibly elsewhere off-cam
pus in an attempt to increase
our readership and the paper's
attractiveness to advertisers.
The Daily's main concern is
to provide its readers with thor
ough coverage of the Stanford
community — an objective
predicated on our financial
well-being. To be able to afford
to send a reporter to sports
games away from campus, for
instance, to run color pictures,
or to increase the size of the pa
per when breaking news events
demand it — is the sine qua nan
of publishing a good newspaper,
and is still within our grasp.
