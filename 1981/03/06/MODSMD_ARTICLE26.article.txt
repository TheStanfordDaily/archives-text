## Equal pay for equal worth 
### Louise Solomon 
Sex-hased pay discrimination is pervasive in
the job market and the best solution to this prob
lem may be a new national law, according to a law
professor here Speaking to an audience of about
75 in Terman Auditorium yesterday. Professor
Victoria Diaz, an assistant dean at Stanford Law-
School. proposed a law aimed at guaranteeing
equal pay for "comparable worth '
As outlined by Diaz, the law would include spe
cific guidelines for determining what jobs are of
comparable value although not necessarily simi
lar. She noted that women's contribution to the
working world has been consistently undervalued
During the sixth lecture ot the ongoing Center
for Research on Women (CROWi series. Diaz
said that the lull cost of women's work has not
been recognized by the market and that women
have had to bear the result of this disparity. She
went on to say. "If Congress finds the market im
pure. then it ought to interfere.''
Diaz herself hinted at the vast ramifications of
the law she proposed, and said that it would re
quire a "new approach to how we value different
skills. She cited the different skills involved in

heavy lifting and those of secretarial work as an
example of this conflict. When asked about the
proposed law's affect on unemployed housewives.
Diaz indicated that they might conceivably be
considered under the law. but not in the near
future
Explaining the "comparable worth'' theory.
Diaz said that jobs which require similar effort,
and have comparable responsibilities and de
mands. should have the same value She main
tained. however, that a low value has traditionally
been placed on ' female jobs ''
"Women are concentrated in the low-paving,
low-status positions." Diaz said, noting that 56
percent of working women have incomes of less
than $4000 while only 21 percent of the men do. As
a whole. Diaz said, women are only earning 50 per
cent ot what men are earning She warned that the
gap is widening, not narrowing
"We're in a period ot laying the groundwork
(for wage parity)." Diaz said "We need to
educate the legislators, the employers and other
employees." she concluded "Women in positions
ol influence should be promoting change."
