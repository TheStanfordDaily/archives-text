# Funding uncertain for latest SLAC particle beam collider
## 
### Mike Vaska 
Scientists at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) an
nounced last week their plans to build
a pioneering $90 million atomic parti
cle smasher that they hope will enable
the study ot the basic building blocks
ot matter and of the fundamental
forces in the universe.
However, because of the tight
budgets required by the Reagan ad
ministration for next year, it is not
clear when the federal government
will provide the necessary funds for
the project.
The Stanford Linear Collider (SLC).
which will be built at the end of the ex
isting two-mile linear accelerator,
will produce three to four times the
energy of particle machines currently
in use and will do so with lower energy
requirements.
Sub-atomic particles, positrons and
electrons, will be smashed together in
the linear collider creating 100 billion
electron volts and, it is hoped, mys
terious Z-zero particles that may help
scientists prove a unifying theory for
the basic forces operating in the uni
verse.
In addition, the linear collider will
help "maintain a vigorous program"
so that the United States will lead in
the high energy physics world, SLAC
Deputy Director Sidney Drell told the
Daily.
Planners hope the Department of
Energy (DOE) will fund the linear col
lider project over a three-year period
beginning in 1983, according to SLAC
Director Dr. Wolfgang Panofsky.
Federal funding uncertain
However, because of the Reagan
budget cutting and the existence of
competing proposed particle colliders
there is no certainty that the federal
government will be willing to pay for
the project.
The Stanford Linear Collider "of
fers exciting possibilities — but so do

other projects," according to James
Leiss, director of high energy and nu
clear physics at the Department of
Energy.
Whether or not the project will be
built depends on budget constraints
and how the High Energy Physics Ad
visory Panel (HEPAP), which ad
vises the DOE on scientific matters,
decides to set priorities for funding in
the next few years. Leiss said
The advisory panel reviewed the
linear collider last year and recom
mended that no new facilities, includ
ing SLC, be built because of budget
constraints, he said.
Although the facilities subcommit
tee of HEPAP did not recommend the
collider for funding, it told SLAC to
continue intensive research and de
sign, Panofsky said.
Advance design contract awarded
SLAC was awarded a $500,000 ad
vance design contract to continue
working on the linear collider, Pan
ofsky said. "You might say we have
our foot in the door," he said.
It is difficult to project an ap
preciable federal budget increase for
high energy research in the next few
years — and in that context it might be
very difficult to start a new project
such as the proposed SLC. Leiss said.
However, the federal funding situ
ation is always changing, he said.
"We don't see any evidence that the
new administration is against basic
science. I think they do understand
that basic research is very important
for productivity and technological
growth." Leiss said.
"We must also understand that the
administration is trying to contend
with serious economic problems as
well," he said.
Competing proposals
In addition, there will be competing
proposals from other research groups
for major funding of beam colliders,
he said.

Cornell University, lor example,
expressed interest in building an elec
tron-positron collider beam machine
with the same energy output as the
proposed SLC, although that proposed
project would be a great deal more ex
pensive than the linear collider, Leiss
said
Drell. who also chairs HEPAP, said
the national plan tor high energy phys
ics research that was adopted in 1978
is below its projected budget spending
floor by $30 million, which is having
serious consequences in the efficiency
of the research being conducted.
By asking the Congress for more
construction money for projects such
as the linear collider, the high energy
physics research community will be
asking for a "recommitment to the na
tional plan," Drell said.
When, not whether
"The idea of SLC is so good, so im
portant for the future that the question
is one of when — rather than whether
— we will get rolling on the project,"
Drell said.
If the budget for high energy phys
ics erodes in this country, the "whole
lield may whither," Drell said. Then
the United States would be "dead in
the water" in high energy physics de
velopment and would be stuck
"wallowing in the wake of European
programs." he said. The U.S. present
ly spends, in terms of the fraction of
the gross national product, one-half of
that spent by the combined European
countries working on high energy
physics, Drell added
Ultimately, funding will depend on
the budget climate in Washington and
the lunding requirements of other
DOE projects. Panofsky said. "To get
funding for a project such as SLC
wedged into the budget we must be pa
tient and wait until a budgetary gap
develops," he said
SLAC's most successful project, the
Stanford Positron-Electron Ac
celerating Ring (SPEAR), which
began operating in 1972, was not ap
proved until five years after it had ori
ginally been proposed, Panofsky said.
If the linear collider project is
funded and built, and if it works as
planned, positrons and electrons will
be fired and accelerated down the two
mile-long linear accelerator at SLAC
into the the linear collider — the elec
trons into one side of the loop and the
positrons into the other.
They will be focused into a beam
narrower than a human hair and will
collide, generating 100 billion electron
volts and, it is hoped, theZ-zero parti
cles. The Z-zero particles will decay
almost instantly into quarks, leptons
and perhaps other particles. Observ
ing this decay should provide informa
tion about basic physical properties
including the number of elementary
building blocks which make up our
world, the relationship between weak
and electromagnetic forces and the
conditions in the universe when it was
only a few seconds old.
The Linear Collider is a pioneering
project in a new class of electron
positron colliding beam devices de
signed to reach higher energies at low
er costs, according to Panofsky.
Current technology, such as that

used in the PF>P ring at SLAC. is less
efficient than the proposed SLC ring
because it directs a continuous flow of
particles in opposite directions with
wide dispersion — a process which
wastes energy through dissipation.
Panofsky said.
The linear collider will operate on a
"one-shot" basis and thus will not lose
energy as does PEP, Panofsky said.
Thus higher energy levels can be
reached without vastly expanding the
amount of power required, he said.
The collider itself will consist of an
underground tunnel svstem at the end

of the linear accelerator of approx
imately a mile and a half in length and
an above-ground research building at
the point where the particles will col
lide.
In addition to the purely abstract in
formation about the nature of the uni
verse for which the SLC is designed to
search, there are other reasons for
projects such as SLC and high-energy
physics research in general, Drell
said
Basic research such as high energy
physics is also the "hallmark of civ
ilization." hesaid.
