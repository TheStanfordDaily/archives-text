New York (AP) — Walter Cronkite leaves
CBS' Evening News after tonight's broad
cast, with the rival networks eagerly await
ing a tug-of-war for viewers no longer bound
by loyalty to the anchorman recognized as
one of the most trusted men in America.
Both ABC and NBC are mounting print
and on-air campaigns promoting their own
news programs. But no one would forecast
an early end to CBS' 13-year reign as the No.
1 network in news after Dan Rather, a 60
Minutes correspondent since 1975, replaces
Cronkite on Monday night.
"I don't see any immediate change,'said
William Small, president of NBC News and
a former CBS News executive. "If it does
come, it will be a matter of months."
The stakes are enormous, and both ABC
and NBC — who have run almost neck-and
neck in second place since late in 1979 — are
anxious to increase their evening news rat

ings at CBS' expense. A single rating point
for the news can mean as much as $7 million
a year in advertising income.
Cronkite, who is 64, will remain with CBS
News as a correspondent and anchorman
for the network's new I Universe science
magazine.
CBS, certainly mindful of the competition
for viewers about to ensue, emphasized in
its own promotional campaign the 49-year
old Rather's experience and its own record
of success.
In fact, painters were ready to move onto
the Evening News set Saturday to paint
over Cronkite's beige background with a
blue-gray deemed more suitable to Rather.
Rather himself insisted that whatever
changes are made, they will be in sub
stance, not superficial.
One thing is certain; Cronkite is leaving
the Evening News as the pre-eminent figure

in television journalism. A former United
Press correspondent, he joined CBS News in
July 1950 and took over as Evening News an
chorman from Douglas Edwards on April
16. 1962. with the broadcast still 15 minutes
long.
"Walter has been a symbol of authority
and responsibility, and all of us are grateful
to him for that," said Frank Reynolds, an
chorman for ABC's World News Tonight.
"He helped set standards for television
news at a time when the business was vul
nerable. A different person might have led
us in a different direction."
As for Cronkite, whose closing line, "And
that's the way it is," became a signal of as
surance for nearly 19 million viewers each
weeknight, the long-anticipated change will
not be easy.
"I don't doubt that I am going to miss this
a great, great deal," he said.
