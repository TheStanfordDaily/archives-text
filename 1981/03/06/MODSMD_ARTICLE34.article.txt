# Gymnasts finish year on the road
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's gymnasts close out
their regular seasons this week
end in a pair of away meets. The
women's squad leaves at mid
day for a dual meet with Fresno
State tonight, while the men's
team travels to Berkeley for a 8
p.m. four-way meet with San
Jose State and Long Beach City
College, hosted by California.
In the match-up with the Bull
dogs. the Cardinals are once
again odds-on favorites with a
10-point advantage based on re
cent meet scores. A Stanford

victory tonight will break the
first-place deadlock (both
teams are 2-0) in Nor Cal com
petition and give Jackie Walk
er's gymnasts their second con
secutive conference title.
"Fresno has scored 126 and
128 points before." Walker said.
"I think they also had a 129. It'll
be like our meet with Arizona
where we were not just going in
with the goal of beating the oth
er team — in addition we're also
trying for 140-plus points. Ac
tually. we're going for as much
over 140 points as possible."

The same situation regarding
post-season meet possibilities
that has haunted the Cards all
year remains as a big 'if.' This
final regular season meet, the
Nor Cal Championships two
weeks away and the March 27-28
regionals all will provide more
clues, but the complete answer
won't be known until all the
competitors' scores are in as
well.
"If we don't do it soon, we're
not going to make it — but that's
not news." Walker explained.
"We're either going to make na
tionals by just a little bit or miss

by a little bit. Even if we do well
in those next two meets, there's
no way of knowing until after re
gional by comparing scores
from across the country.
"Our team score of 139.85 is
still 18th in the country. If we
can use that and our 139.45 as
our two low scores of our four
that we average for the season,
then we'll be looking good. But I
think we may need even more
than 140 — maybe 141 or 142 to
help assure that spot.
"It's very difficult because a
lot of teams are peaking and it's
