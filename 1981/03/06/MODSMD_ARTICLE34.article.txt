# Gymnasts finish year on the road
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's gymnasts close out
their regular seasons this week
end in a pair of away meets. The
women's squad leaves at mid
day for a dual meet with Fresno
State tonight, while the men's
team travels to Berkeley for a 8
p.m. four-way meet with San
Jose State and Long Beach City
College, hosted by California.
In the match-up with the Bull
dogs. the Cardinals are once
again odds-on favorites with a
10-point advantage based on re
cent meet scores. A Stanford

victory tonight will break the
first-place deadlock (both
teams are 2-0) in Nor Cal com
petition and give Jackie Walk
er's gymnasts their second con
secutive conference title.
"Fresno has scored 126 and
128 points before." Walker said.
"I think they also had a 129. It'll
be like our meet with Arizona
where we were not just going in
with the goal of beating the oth
er team — in addition we're also
trying for 140-plus points. Ac
tually. we're going for as much
over 140 points as possible."

The same situation regarding
post-season meet possibilities
that has haunted the Cards all
year remains as a big 'if.' This
final regular season meet, the
Nor Cal Championships two
weeks away and the March 27-28
regionals all will provide more
clues, but the complete answer
won't be known until all the
competitors' scores are in as
well.
"If we don't do it soon, we're
not going to make it — but that's
not news." Walker explained.
"We're either going to make na
tionals by just a little bit or miss

by a little bit. Even if we do well
in those next two meets, there's
no way of knowing until after re
gional by comparing scores
from across the country.
"Our team score of 139.85 is
still 18th in the country. If we
can use that and our 139.45 as
our two low scores of our four
that we average for the season,
then we'll be looking good. But I
think we may need even more
than 140 — maybe 141 or 142 to
help assure that spot.
"It's very difficult because a
lot of teams are peaking and it's
hard to know what they'll end up
scoring," she added This year
the scoring has been more er
ratic than usual because ot a
brand new international judging
standard "
Besides the team score goal.
Walker is also looking for a good
all-around score from Karen
Hall, who will be entering all
four events for only her third
meet of the season at Fresno,
the result of a variety of injuries
suffered earlier this winter
"I'd like to see Karen break3s
points in all-around." Walker
said "Her average is a 34 60
right now — that would be close,
borderline (for qualifying to na
tionals). I think that scoring
over 35 points would do it, the
most important meet < for a high
scorei being the regional
meet."
An element that might help
Hall and her teammates reach
those goals is the good possi

bility of an enthusiastic turnout
at the Fresno State gymnasium
"Fresno's program is under
review — they don't know if
they'll have women's gym
nastics next year." Walker said
So. they're trying to give the
meet a lot ol publicity Hopeful
ly that w ill give us a good crowd
that helps the girls perform a
little better.
"The conference meet will
also be at Fresno." Walker
added, "so at least the team will
have had experience working
out in that gym and on that
equipment
The scouting report lor Satur
day's meet at Cal has a lot of
first-hand information in it. be
cause Sadao Hamada's team
has already faced two of the
teams already, beating
Spartans and losing to the
Golden Bears.
We met San Jose State al
ready and they aren't that good
a team." Hamada said. "Long

Beach City College beat us last
year because they have so many
good gymnasts. 1 don't know
how good they are this season
though Cal is very strong last
week they scored 277. which is in
the top five in the nation as far
as scores are concerned
"They are not having any in
juries — nobody's out tor the
season or anything like that." he
added "They're getting consis
tent too. that's why their scores
are going up. "
Like their female coun
terparts. Hamada's Cards are
rated around the top 20 in the
country, based on team scores
to date.
"We're in the top 20 — right
about there." the coach said
"We're anywhere from 18th to
22nd. depending upon who com
peted that week
"In the western region, Mike
(Leei is seventh in all-around
and the guy right above him is
not too far away from him — it

.ill pretty much depends on the
next two meets for Mike and
Hob (Daniel), too. Hainada
added Bob is also seventh, in
vaulting They have a chance
for qualifying to nationals."
Hamada's team goal for this
weekend is to get as close to 260
as possible That mark should
be a challenge for the Cards,
though, as much ot the recent
practice hours have been spent
in preparation for the March
20-21 Fac-10 Championships.
Regular season meets use op
tional routines while the post
season competition in
corporates both optionals and
compulsories.
"We really don't have any
time to spend on the optionals
now." Hainada explained. "We
have so much to work on with
the compulsories In the past,
they have spent enough time on
the optionals that I think they
just need Friday to go through
some sequences for the meet.''

first-place deadlock (both
teams are 2-0) in Nor Cal com
petition and give Jackie Walk
er's gymnasts their second con
secutive conference title.
"Fresno has scored 126 and
128 points before." Walker said.
"I think they also had a 129. It'll
be like our meet with Arizona
where we were not just going in
with the goal of beating the oth
er team — in addition we're also
trying for 140-plus points. Ac
tually. we're going for as much
over 140 points as possible."

The same situation regarding
post-season meet possibilities
that has haunted the Cards all
year remains as a big 'if.' This
final regular season meet, the
Nor Cal Championships two
weeks away and the March 27-28
regionals all will provide more
clues, but the complete answer
won't be known until all the
competitors' scores are in as
well.
"If we don't do it soon, we're
not going to make it — but that's
not news." Walker explained.
"We're either going to make na
tionals by just a little bit or miss

by a little bit. Even if we do well
in those next two meets, there's
no way of knowing until after re
gional by comparing scores
from across the country.
"Our team score of 139.85 is
still 18th in the country. If we
can use that and our 139.45 as
our two low scores of our four
that we average for the season,
then we'll be looking good. But I
think we may need even more
than 140 — maybe 141 or 142 to
help assure that spot.
"It's very difficult because a
lot of teams are peaking and it's
hard to know what they'll end up
scoring," she added This year
the scoring has been more er
ratic than usual because ot a
brand new international judging
standard "
Besides the team score goal.
Walker is also looking for a good
all-around score from Karen
Hall, who will be entering all
four events for only her third
meet of the season at Fresno,
the result of a variety of injuries
suffered earlier this winter
"I'd like to see Karen break3s
points in all-around." Walker
said "Her average is a 34 60
right now — that would be close,
borderline (for qualifying to na
tionals). I think that scoring
over 35 points would do it, the
most important meet < for a high
scorei being the regional
meet."
An element that might help
Hall and her teammates reach
those goals is the good possi

bility of an enthusiastic turnout
at the Fresno State gymnasium
"Fresno's program is under
review — they don't know if
they'll have women's gym
nastics next year." Walker said
So. they're trying to give the
meet a lot ol publicity Hopeful
ly that w ill give us a good crowd
that helps the girls perform a
little better.
"The conference meet will
also be at Fresno." Walker
added, "so at least the team will
have had experience working
out in that gym and on that
equipment
The scouting report lor Satur
day's meet at Cal has a lot of
first-hand information in it. be
cause Sadao Hamada's team
has already faced two of the
teams already, beating
Spartans and losing to the
Golden Bears.
We met San Jose State al
ready and they aren't that good
a team." Hamada said. "Long

Beach City College beat us last
year because they have so many
good gymnasts. 1 don't know
how good they are this season
though Cal is very strong last
week they scored 277. which is in
the top five in the nation as far
as scores are concerned
"They are not having any in
juries — nobody's out tor the
season or anything like that." he
added "They're getting consis
tent too. that's why their scores
are going up. "
Like their female coun
terparts. Hamada's Cards are
rated around the top 20 in the
country, based on team scores
to date.
"We're in the top 20 — right
about there." the coach said
"We're anywhere from 18th to
22nd. depending upon who com
peted that week
"In the western region, Mike
(Leei is seventh in all-around
and the guy right above him is
not too far away from him — it

.ill pretty much depends on the
next two meets for Mike and
Hob (Daniel), too. Hainada
added Bob is also seventh, in
vaulting They have a chance
for qualifying to nationals."
Hamada's team goal for this
weekend is to get as close to 260
as possible That mark should
be a challenge for the Cards,
though, as much ot the recent
practice hours have been spent
in preparation for the March
20-21 Fac-10 Championships.
Regular season meets use op
tional routines while the post
season competition in
corporates both optionals and
compulsories.
"We really don't have any
time to spend on the optionals
now." Hainada explained. "We
have so much to work on with
the compulsories In the past,
they have spent enough time on
the optionals that I think they
just need Friday to go through
some sequences for the meet.''
Stanford's gymnasts close out
their regular seasons this week
end in a pair of away meets. The
women's squad leaves at mid
day for a dual meet with Fresno
State tonight, while the men's
team travels to Berkeley for a 8
p.m. four-way meet with San
Jose State and Long Beach City
College, hosted by California.
In the match-up with the Bull
dogs. the Cardinals are once
again odds-on favorites with a
10-point advantage based on re
cent meet scores. A Stanford

victory tonight will break the
first-place deadlock (both
teams are 2-0) in Nor Cal com
petition and give Jackie Walk
