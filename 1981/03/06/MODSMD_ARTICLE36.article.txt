# Baseball team opens Six-Pac season against Arizona
## SPORTS 
### Ralph Walker 
There is no doubt that the na
tion s seventh ranked team is
good-very good There is one
problem though So are the oth
er five teams (Arizona. Arizona
State. USC. UCLA, and Cal)
that comprise collegiate
baseball's most powerful
division the Southern Pacif
ic-10. otherwise known as the
six-pac.
The level of competition
borders on AAA ball; each team
usually has a half-dozen major
league prospects, and according
to Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. the last-place team could
win the NCAA championship.
"It would be nice if our
playoff system was like it is in
basketball, where there is no
limit to the number of teams
that go to the playoffs." he said
"You hate to blow your own
horn, but it's a tact that the
Pac-10 is the strongest con
ference in the land. The last
place team could win the whole
thing."
Only two teams from the
Pac-10 will go to Omaha. Ne
braska this June to play in the
College World Series.
The defending NCAA Cham
pion Arizona Wildcats invade
Sunken Diamond this weekend.
Some believe them to be the
best team in the country. This
year ranked second, the Wild
cats have a solid pitching staff,
great speed, and a team batting

average of .339 Five starters
bat over 385
"We're a young team," com
mented head coach Jerry Ken
dall "We've had a lot of peaks
and valleys this year, but by and
large I'm pleased enough
enough with this ball club. We
could be a contender if youth
doesn't have its way."
Leading the youth movement
for the Cats is All-America can
didate Dwight Taylor, who. ac
cording to Stanford pitcher
Brian Mignano, "has some
wheels."
"Right now he's off to a slow
start," said Marquess of Taylor,
who batted .361 last season.
"That's lucky for us and I hope
it continues. He makes them go
He gets on base and runs like a
deer He'll steal third and he'll
steal home."
"The problem with Taylor is
that you know he'll steal, but he
steals anyway," added
Mignano.
Complementing Taylor is a
type of offensive attack the
Cards have yet to face this year.
Garret Hugo (.453). David Page
(.450). Mike Querry (.397 >, Jack
Daugherty (.391), and Tom Bar
ret (.381) lead the attack.
But hitting, according to Mar
quess. is a less important aspect
than is pitching. "In this league
you don't win it by the bat alone.
The hitting can fluctuate, but if
you get consistent pitching
you're going to be pretty close to

the top of the league." he said
Arizona does have some
hurlers to go along with the
aluminum arsenal. Scheduled to
face the Cardinals are Ed
Vosberg (3-1. 1.87 ERA), Rich
Lucero (4-1, 4.10) and Ron Sis
mundo (3-1. 2.61 >.
Stanford, however, can boast
of some players who will give
the 15-4 Wildcats plenty to han
dle. Leading the Cardinals
ofensivelv are Mike Dotterer
( 438. 20 runs), Loring Davies
(.425), and Mike Toothman
(.407, 19 RBI, 4 HR). "There is
no doubt in my mind that we are
better oft as a team." said Mar
quess. "Our hitting has definite
ly improved."
One of the few obstacles hin
dering the Cardinals this year
has been injuries. Shortstop
Dave Meier and third baseman
John Elway have each missed
several games due to knee in
juries. and utility infielder
Steve Buchelle has been suffer
ing from a separated shoulder.
"They are a bit behind and that
hurts us a little bit as a team,
but I'm still optimistic," com
mented Marquess.
Such optimism was less justi
fied earlier this year, cont
ingent on a suspect pitching
staff. But what threatened to be
Stanford's missing link between
an extended summer vacation
and Omaha has turned into the
Cards strongest suit.
"I'm really optimistic about
the year because the pitching
has improved," said Dotterer.
"Coach Dunton (Tom) has done
a just a great job with the staff,
and it has really rubbed off on
the team. It's improved our at
titude."
Dunton's mound crew, which
has a combined ERA of 2.64, is
headed by Paul Grame (5-1,2.43
ERA), Brian Mignano (3-1,
4.13), and freshman Steve Cot
trell (3-0, 1.33). But the line of
dependable stoppers does not

end there Stanford has enjoyed
solid relief from freshmen
Gregg Lomnickey and Brian
Myers, and senior Lee Cline.
"There's more depth from a
pitching standpoint," said
Grame. "Last week 1 pitched
six innings against Fullerton
and they took me out. 1 was kind
of shocked at first, but then
Lomnickey came in and just
shut them down. The pitchers

don't think Wow, I have to go
nine innings,' because we have
so much depth coming in behind
us."
The talent is obviously there,
the question now is what Stan
ford will do with it.
The three game series at
Sunken Diamond will be played
on Friday, Saturday and Sun
day. Game times are 2 p.m., 1
p.m. and 1 p.m. respectively.

Outfielder Mike Toothman, who is hitting at a .408 clip, raps out one
of his 23 base hits. The rightfielder will be counted on to continue his
heavy hitting when the Cards open up their Six-Pac season with Ari
zona this afternoon at Sunken Diamond at 2 p.m.
