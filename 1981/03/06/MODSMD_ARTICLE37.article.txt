The year is 1920. The place is Wimbledon U.S. Champion Bill
Tilden is on centre court, about to win his first major cham
pionship. He is dressed in long pants and his racket resembles a
meat cleaver made out of plywood
Now welcome to 1981. Tennis has undergone wholesale
changes, most of them within the last decade. And it is thriving.
For example, earnings for both men and women have sky
rocketed from what they once were. Professional tennis tour
naments have penetrated the Iron and Bamboo Curtains, with
big money tourneys in Bulgaria and China. And what about the
everchanging racquet? Indeed, when Howard Head invented the
revolutionary bigger head Prince racquet, there was an uproar.
"It'll ruin the game," some decreed. Has it? Hardly.
What the IMnce, and other innovations in constructions of rac
quets have done, is to give players a choice. People who scream
for standardization and strict regulation of racquets don't seem
to realize that if their same voices would have been listened to 60
years ago, tennis would still be in Bill Tilden's
world.
Not to say that Tilden's world was not great — it was, no ques
tion — but tennis has changed, and I think most would argue, for
the better. It is one sport which has kept up with the changing
times, while still keeping its refined past intact. Tennis still has
strawberries and cream — but it also has graphite and titanium.
And remember, equipment changes in sports do not necessar
ily hurt a game. Still, there are traditionalists who yell every
time an innovation is even hinted at. But can you imagine where
we would be without the evolution of the football uniform to its
present state?
We must leave all options open, and not limit ourselves. If
something new is in fact ridiculous or not in the best interests of
the game, then fine, can it.
This strategy works, and spaghetti stringing is a prime exam
ple; it was promptly outlawed in 1977 by the ITF (International
Tennis Federation.)
And besides, bigger is not always better anyway. Just take a
look at all of the highly successful players using conventional
sized wood racquets in today's game. John McEnroe. Chris Ev
ert-Lloyd. Tracy Austin. To name a few.
Granted, the I*rince racquet does give a player some advan
tages, but not without taking something away. You will find you
have more power and of course, the acclaimed "three and a-half
times" bigger sweet spot.
But you will also lose something on your serve, and you'll find
the racquet more difficut to maneuver, especially at the net. If
the was so awesome, (it has helped some players, for ex
ample, Peter Rennert) then why hasn't everyone made the
change?
A player must make his own decision on choosing his racquet,
and let's continue to allow him
her to have that choice. Tennis is a game which thrives on varie
ty — variety in styles of play, variety in personalities, and varie
ty in racquets. Let's not imitate Soviet Russia in our decisions
regarding these most precious weapons.
