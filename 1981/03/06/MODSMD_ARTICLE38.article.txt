Athletic equipment has gotten so complicated you have to be
an aerospace specialist to figure it all out. Tennis, for example,
used to be a simple sport. All you needed was some wood, string,
and a ball that bounced. Bingo, one sport that you could play any
where, anytime.
These days buying a tennis racket is like buying a car. There's
your basic wood, but you have to deal with graphite, metal, and
all kinds of combinations as well. Then you move on to strings.
Gut, fake gut, nylon, oil-filled nylon. Now they have different
sizes. Give me a break.
Cheat rackets, I call them. Those Prince ultra Edge super pe
rimeter weighted things that look like they belong in a rocket
ship rather than on a tennis court. If you put a couple of racing
stripes on one you could just call it a Ferrari. Stick wings on it
and you could use it as a glider.
Someone should make a racket with legs and arms attached.
Then the competitors could set up little remote control units and
play from the bench.
All of these new oversized rackets are unnecessary, and may
be even downright unfair. First of all. tennis is a game played
with reflexes as much as anything. A larger racket gives one
player an unfair advantage at the net, no matter what the aero
space specialists say.
It's the same thing with the serve, even ground strokes. A larg
er surface area means a larger sweet spot, which means less
room for mistakes.
You don't see John McEnroe or Chris Evert-Lloyd using them.
They stick with the good, old-fashioned, regular-sized wooden
rackets.
A truly excellent player doesn't need an oversized racket, or
even that much equipment. When McEnroe and Bjorn Borg
walked onto the court to play the finals of the 1980 U.S. Open.
Borg carried about 15 rackets under his arm. McEnroe carried
three, one of which was broken, and won the match.
So why not allow larger rackets, if they don't help that much
anyway? Because they mark a trend in tennis today: players are
trying to find something other than their own physical and men
tal effort to win matches. The beauty of the sport is that the real
enemy is often yourself. A larger racket, while not giving a
player the physical advantage so widely acclaimed, might lend a
mental one.
What I object to more than anything else is the price ot those
things. Tennis is finally becoming a game of the masses. Why
sanction a gimmick that threatens to put tennis right back in the
country clubs, where they spell racket with a q?
