# Ahzug severely chastises Reagan budget
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff 
Her scathing criticism called Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's budget inten
tions a "serious problem of lies," last
night as Bella Abzug protested the ad
ministration's economic and foreign
policies in a campus lecture here.
Abzug, a former House represent
ative, is currently the president of
WOMEN-USA, a new national activist
group. In 1977 she was named by then-
President Jimmy Carter as the presid
ing officer of the National Com
mission for the Observance of Interna
tional Women's Year and later served
as cochair of the President's National
Advisory Committee for Women.
Abzug was one of three campus
speakers yesterday in conjunction
with the observance of International
Women's Day on March 8.

"Who knows? If we behave, they
might let us in for good," she said, not
ing that the U.S. is currently celebrat
ing International Women's Decade
from 1975 to 1985.
Other activities around campus in
cluded a noon rally in White Plaza key
noted by Political Science Assoc.
Prof. Nannerl Keohane and Assistant
Provost Cecilia Burciaga, and an af
ternoon discussion in Toyon.
Facing a near-capacity crowd in
Kresge, Abzug delivered an often
emotional appeal asking students to
express their disapproval of current
legislative decisions.
Citing budget cuts for food stamp
programs, aid to dependent children,
student loan programs and public sec
tor jobs most of which are held by
women, Abzug charged that the Rea
gan administration is not cutting the
budget, "they are just cutting the guts
of the poor people in this country: the
women, children, minorities and the
elderly.
"These cuts most affect the people
with the least power in society. What
is the judgment of civilization on a so
ciety that says 'to hell with the women
and children?' " she asked.
After listing the proposed budget
cuts totalling some $41.1 billion,
Abzug mentioned the proposed in
crease in military spending estimated
at $38 billion, saying the figure "ex
poses the lies and distortions" by
claiming the budget cuts will help

curb inflation.
"Government spending contributes
very little to inflation. It is the cost of
energy, food, housing and medicine
that increases inflation. Those are the
places we should control." she said.
Active in the women's movement
for years. Abzug said, "equal rights
for women is a matter of justice.'' She
emphasized that the "feminist move
ment is the humanist movement" and
is concerned with "changing the
priorities" in the country.

Abzug cited the proportion of men to
women in the House of Represent
atives (416:19) and the Senate (98:2)
as examples of distorted representa
tion, saying. "Nothing can possibly
justify a country calling itself a de
mocracy when the majority in a popu
lation is not represented propor
tionately."
She said she deplored the poor voter
turnout of 52 percent in the last elec
tion. "The American people have ab
dicated their rights," she said.
