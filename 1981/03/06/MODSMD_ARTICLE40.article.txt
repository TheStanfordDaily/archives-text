With the balmy temperatures and cloudless
skies, yesterday was a day for relaxing in the sun
and forgetting all your cares That's exactly what
Stanford's men's tennis team did. whipping out
manned Canada College 8-1 at Stanford Stadium
The Cardinals took little more than an hour to
win five of six singles matches, methodically
mowing down their opponents. Ho-hum. toss the
racquet out on the court and let's get it over with I
could be doing something more important, like
hitting the ball against the wall
Coach Dick Gould's Cards, now 4-0, have one
more match (Tuesday at San Jose State) before
they break for 112 inals. Then the real season starts
with a trip to Arizona to face Pacific-10 Con
ference foes Arizona and Arizona State the last
weekend of this month
In the meantime, Stanford will have to make do
with pounding harmless foes into the concrete
surface.
"These matches are hard to get up for," said
Jim Gurfein, a 6-3, 6-1 winner over Mark McNally
in No. 2 singles. "Everyone expects you to win
That's why practices are so good. They're just as
good as the matches because some of these guys
(Canada > don't have the same experience and re
sults."
Scott Davis had no complaints about the quality
of competition. He was just happy to be anywhere
that wasn't an airport after being snowed in in
Denver, where he was playing in the United Bank
Classic.
"It's hard to get psyched after being in an air
port all day," Davis said. "Plus coming outdoors
after playing indoors, I had to deal with thewind. "
Though it sounds like trouble, it was actually
the best poor-mouthing this side of Bear Bryant
Davis whipped Mark Burchett 6-3, 6-2 in No. 1 sin
gles. then teamed up with Scott Bondurant to de
stroy McNally and Mike Olson 6-3. 6-1 in 45
minutes in the top doubles match.
Burchett is a native of France and played like

it. with a strong clay-court accent to his game.
However. Davis moved him all over the faster
hard-court surface, then rushed to the net to put
away point after point
Another good sign for Stanford was Jetf Arons*
win in No. 3 singles, 6-3,6-4 over Dijay Castillon It
was only the junior's second match since he came
back from a mononucleosis-induced layoff He
was rusty, and tired, but also content that he's
coming back
"My legs don't feel as strong and I really get
winded on the long points I try to end them
taster,' Arons said. "I don t feel as flexible, and I
don't have the strength."
His body was not the only casualty of the illness.
"I'm not hitting groundstrokes nearly as well,"
Arons said "I'm not playing consistently, not re
acting to the ball I just have to go slow I've got
three weeks until the season starts. I can't try and
go too fast, or I'll get sick again."
NOTES — No. 1 player Tim Mavotte took the day
off because of schoolwork, but practiced on the
side courts for more than an hour yesterday . . .
Mavotte is now tied for 135 th on the ATP com
puter. Ex-Stanford star Peter Rennert is at No. 59
. Nothing new in the case of Mike Falberg, the
talented freshman who stopped out at the begin
ning of this quarter for personal reasons Though
it is unlikely, Gould said there is still a chance he
will back next quarter for the meat of the Cards'
schedule . . . The Athletic Department is install
ing an electronic scoreboard on the south side of
the courts that will enable those fans in the
bleachers to know what is happening in all
matches at once. It should be ready for the next
home match. April 10 against USC.
