# Women hooters roll past Hayward
## 
### Susan Fischer 
The Stanford women's soccer
team rolled by Havward State
last Sunday with a 4-0 victory
The Cardinals controlled the
game trom the opening
minutes, seldom allowing the
ball to escape Hayward's halt ot
the tield
A series ot passing combina
tions enabled Stanford to con
nect on three goals in the first
half. Ann Sessler punched in the
first goal of the game on a cross

ing pass from tellow freshman
Sally Geisse.
The next two scoring con
tributions of the half came from
well-placed shots by Kim
Gaumer and Sue Moore Becky
Schwartz booted in the final
goal of the game in the opening
minutes of the second half on a
slide past the Havward goalie.
Stanford's teamwork and ball
control were the main sources
for victory in the game.
The Cards opened their sea

son three weeks ago with a con
test against defending league
champions UC-Berkeley. In a
hard-fought game. Berkeley
outlasted Stanford for a 2-0 vic
tory. Cal took advantage of two
Stanford errors to gain the vic
tory. A lack of communication
on the field and an experienced
Berkeley goalie prevented Stan
ford from putting any balls in
the net.
Last week. Stanford's luck
changed with a 3-0 win over UC-

Santa Cruz. The difficulties evi
denced in the Berkeley game
disappeared as Stanford played
a smooth, controlled passing
game. Kim Gaumer led the of
fense by scoring all three goals.
Defenders Pauline McNamara.
Katherine Morris and Ann
Walecka 112 rustrated all offensive
attempts by the Santa Cruz for
ward line.
Stanford travels to UOP next
Saturday for its fourth league
game of the season.
