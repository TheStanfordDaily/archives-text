11:45 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Tuesday through Thursday for dinner

Friday and Saturday dinner until 10:30 p.m.
It's almost like walking into a country farm house
The props are all there: sausages hanging from wooden
beams; large wooden cupboards holding cutlery and
plates; scents of rich sauces and warm breads napping
in the air.
Then the bustle hits you Waiters wearing black ties
and French accents hustle between the nearly 50 tables
that seat those who have sought out La Potiniere. a
comfortably sophisticated French restaurant tucked
off Third Avenue in San Mateo
"The ingredient we use most in the kitchen is im
agination." states Monsieur Roger Nicholas, the pro
prietor. He definitely practices what he preaches.
Nicholas, who tries to accurately represent the
"nouvelle cuisine" that has been "disgracefully repre
sented in big hotel chains." has established an excellent
restaurant. Nicholas is aware that the "magic for
mula" to any restaurant's success is its food Nicholas
has developed his own recipes, recognizing that he is
catering to "99 percent American people" and needs to

be flexible. Judging from appetizers like la mousse de
poissons and escargots at $3 95 each, to dinners that fea
ture both soup and salad, his culinary imagination de
lights the palate
Savory adventure
I started my savory adventure with the classic
French delicacy, escargot. They were the best I've
eaten anywhere. In most restaurants the chef douses
the snails in garlic, drowning their flavor. In contrast,
this escargot was lightly seasoned and tasted quite de
licious. I'd bet those who traditionally wince at the
thought of eating snail would become escargot converts
after sampling La Potiniere's hors d'oeuvres!
My companion, a native of France, testified that the
accents as well as the entrees were genuine, for once.
He began his meal with le bouquet de champignons, an
assortment of fish pates reasonably priced at $2 95.
The soup du jour was vegetable. We both agreed that
it was one of the best cream soups we had sampled
Nicholas is proud that La Potiniere uses only fresh
fish and vegetables and this commitment to the best
food pays off with satisfied, and very full patrons. I was
almost full by the time the salads arrived, but food this
fantastic inspired my fork to continue its roundtrip
from my mouth to our next dish: fresh turbot with
creamed broccoli.
Across the table, la grillade d 'agneau a la provencale
(lamb broiled with thyme and rosemary leaves) also
tempted my tastebuds Both dishes were cooked deli

cately but with seasoning to accentuate the natural
flavor of the foods. The vegetables were indeed very
fresh.
Our dinners were chosen from a selection of filets of
sole and chicken roasted in Dijon mustard at $9 75 and
filet of beef at $13.95 or baby veal at $14.95 Good
French cooking can always be identified by its spices;
our entrees were gently, yet succulently spiced
Like many gourmets, my ultimate test of a restau
rant is its desserts La Potiniere passed with flying col
ors. I knew 1 had gained 10 pounds that evening anyway,
so le vacherin glace marquise was well worth the extra
calories. This amazing concoction of meringue, choco
late sauce and ice cream is the dream of any self-con
fessed or closet sweet tooth. I'm not sure how French it
was. but its flavor brought it the prize — the piece de
resistance!
La.Potiniere can provide "specialties'' for two peo
ple which require 24 hours advance notice. I'll let you
discover those delights for yourself.
La Potiniere is a wonderful restaurant, authentic and
charming It was full of diners when we went, but our
table felt remarkably private.
If you long for a casually elegant atmosphere, ac
companied by courteous waiters who pronounce ' 'Per
rier'' correctly and a menu with variety and really good
food, try La Potiniere. If you can't make it to Tours, it's
a nice interlude in France.

La Potiniere
60 East 3rd Avenue
San Mateo
Monday through Friday for lunch
11:45 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Tuesday through Thursday for dinner
6 to 9:30 p.m.
Friday and Saturday dinner until 10:30 p.m.
It's almost like walking into a country farm house
The props are all there: sausages hanging from wooden
beams; large wooden cupboards holding cutlery and
plates; scents of rich sauces and warm breads napping
in the air.
Then the bustle hits you Waiters wearing black ties
and French accents hustle between the nearly 50 tables
that seat those who have sought out La Potiniere. a
comfortably sophisticated French restaurant tucked
off Third Avenue in San Mateo
"The ingredient we use most in the kitchen is im
agination." states Monsieur Roger Nicholas, the pro
prietor. He definitely practices what he preaches.
Nicholas, who tries to accurately represent the
"nouvelle cuisine" that has been "disgracefully repre
sented in big hotel chains." has established an excellent
restaurant. Nicholas is aware that the "magic for
mula" to any restaurant's success is its food Nicholas
has developed his own recipes, recognizing that he is
catering to "99 percent American people" and needs to

be flexible. Judging from appetizers like la mousse de
poissons and escargots at $3 95 each, to dinners that fea
ture both soup and salad, his culinary imagination de
lights the palate
Savory adventure
I started my savory adventure with the classic
French delicacy, escargot. They were the best I've
eaten anywhere. In most restaurants the chef douses
the snails in garlic, drowning their flavor. In contrast,
this escargot was lightly seasoned and tasted quite de
licious. I'd bet those who traditionally wince at the
thought of eating snail would become escargot converts
after sampling La Potiniere's hors d'oeuvres!
My companion, a native of France, testified that the
accents as well as the entrees were genuine, for once.
He began his meal with le bouquet de champignons, an
assortment of fish pates reasonably priced at $2 95.
The soup du jour was vegetable. We both agreed that
it was one of the best cream soups we had sampled
Nicholas is proud that La Potiniere uses only fresh
fish and vegetables and this commitment to the best
food pays off with satisfied, and very full patrons. I was
almost full by the time the salads arrived, but food this
fantastic inspired my fork to continue its roundtrip
from my mouth to our next dish: fresh turbot with
creamed broccoli.
Across the table, la grillade d 'agneau a la provencale
(lamb broiled with thyme and rosemary leaves) also
