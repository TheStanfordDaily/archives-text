I kept putting oft seeing this
movie — I think I expected it to be
preachy and all about "human
dignity " i Human dignity tends to
make better editorials than mov
ies i When, last week. 1 finally got
around to going. I was immensely
gratified to discover that '/Vic
h'h'lthiinl Man isn't preachy at all
— it's pure magic.
* The film is based on the life of
John Merrick, a victim of a de
forming disease in nineteenth-cen
tury England Director David
Lynch has created a film that's
equal parts Dickens and Marv
Shelley We empathize with this
"monster." and we're appalled at
the cruelty of the society in which
he tinds himself
Lynch s style i§ anything but re
alistic his movie has the look and
feel of a great fairy tale As played
by John Hurt. Merrick is imbued
with sweetness and gentle grace
He's an immensely likeable vic

Director Howard Hawks liked
to tell the story ot how he got the
brilliant idea of taking one of the
characters from The Front fage
(the stage play and 1930 movie
about newspapermen) and turning
him into a woman The switch, not
as startling now as it was then,
seems to have had an energizing
effect on the movie: it's faster,
and sassier, and funnier than just
about any other comedy. Hawks
worked it so the characters
stepped on each other's lines —
one butts in before another's half
finished talking, and the movie
speeds along like it's been
greased Cary Grant and Rosalind
Russell play the reporters. Ralph
Bellamy is. as always, the movie's
biggest joke.

The Huridy Holly Story *★★★
Old Mill, Mountain View
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business. His showing as
Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, and
he's also a marvelouslyidiosyn
cratic actor. When the plot gets
saccharine toward the end, he
holds it all together. The Buddy
Holl\ Story could've been better,
and that's no hooey, but it's hard to
imagine a better hick superstar
than the one we have right now.

One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about the revenge three abused
secretaries take on their
chauvinistic boss are quickly
smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy
with a fake feminist gloss and a
Frank Capracorn ending. Lily
Tomlin. Dolly Parton and Dabney
Coleman salvage as much as they
can. but Jane Fonda gives a dis

graceful performance: trying to
play a woman ot average in
telligence and to be light and funny
at the same time, she telegraphs
appallingly and gives us scenes of
classic female incompetence,
which surely cannot be what she
intended

The ultimate responsibility, of
course, rests with director Roman

what he was afraid to try, was to
