I.os Angeles — The cockpit crew and most of the passen
gers scrambled out doors and windows of a Continental
Airlines jet yesterday morning as an armed hijacker took
over the Arizona-bound plane at Los Angeles International
Airport
But the hijacker, described as a Caucasian. 6 feet tall.
190 pounds. 40 to 45 years old with a European accent,
took seven passengers and four flight attendants hostage
in the first-class section of the plane parked at the Con
tinental terminal
One attendant later was released by the hijacker who
was armed with a pistol and carried a briefcase he
claimed contained explosives
EBI spokesman John Hoos said the hijacker would not
disclose his demands immediately He asked that the
plane be moved from the Continental satellite to a main
tenance area at the west end of the airport
A Fire Department crash truck, ambulances, a heli
copter and swarms of FBI agents and police followed the
airliner as it was towed to the maintenance area.
Reagan attacked on benefit indexing
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's refusal to cut
the $30 billion cost-of-living increases provided for Social
Security retirees and other beneficiaries of federal pro
grams came under unusually heavy fire yesterday on
Capitol Hill
Alan Greenspan, an unofficial adviser to Reagan and
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under
former President Gerald Ford, joined in the criticism
Greenspan agreed with Otto Eckstein, an economic ad
viser to former President Lyndon Johnson, that Reagan's
failure to propose a reduction in the indexing of federal
benefits to keep pace with inflation was a "major error.''
In addition, both the Republican and Democratic
chairmen of the Senate and House Budget committees
have called for revisions that would save the government
billions of dollars a year by reducing the cost-of-living
payments.
Reagan's budget director David Stockman, however,
strongly defended the president's decision, saying that
lower cost-of-living increases would erode the value of
older people's pensions.
The issue is important because at least one-third of all
federal spending is geared to changes in the Consumer
Price Index, including $150 billion a year in Social Security
payments to 32 million Americans.

Grounds narrowed in evolution suit
Sacramento — California fundamentalist Christians fin
ished presenting their case Wednesday after calling only
two witnesses, thus dropping their own broad attack on the
teaching of evolution in public schools, but still hoping that
the judge will give them a victory on far narrower issues of
religious freedom
The plaintiffs left behind the issues of whether crea
tionism should be taught in public schools and whether
evolution is the only scientifically valid theory of creation,
and instead began to pore over textbooks and the state
guidelines for teaching science to determine whether they
were too dogmatic" or insensitive in their wording, and
thus might violate the freedom of fundamentalist Chris
tian children to believe what they want
The defense, now forced to abandon its plans to call
astronomer Carl Sagan and about 20 other scientists and
scholars, instead began to show that the textbooks and
state guidelines, in specific statements and suggestions to
teachers, take care to avoid offending believers in the
biblical story of creation
Reagan may end legal aid to poor
Washington — The Reagan administration will ask Con
gress to cut off all future federal legal aid for the poor,
wiping out a program that now employs 5000 lawyers
across the country, has revolutionized some areas of the
law and has for years beer\a target of conservatives, in
cluding Ronald Reagan as governor of California.
Edwin Dale, spokesman for the Office of Management
and Budget, yesterday confirmed that no further funding
will be requested by Reagan for the Legal Services Corp
which disburses over $300 million a year in legal aid funds.
