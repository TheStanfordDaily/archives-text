During the Row Fair today in White
Plaza students will have an op

Michael Jackson, assistant director
of the Row. with whom the idea for the
Fair originated, said the purpose of
the event is to acquaint under
graduates with housing options on the
Row-
It will be a low-key informational
affair." Jackson said "The idea is to
awaken student interest in housing
before open-houses and the rush of the
Draw-
Diana Conklin, director of the Row.
said the Fair should give students j
chance to ask more in-depth questions
and talk to residents of the houses at
more length than is possible during
open houses and rush parties.
Also, students aren't aware of the
number of houses, according to Con
klin
"Some houses are concealed among
trees or up on a hill, and many people
do not know a thing about them." she
said.
It is not definite how many houses
will be participating in the Row Fair.
Jackson said it is fairly loosely or
ganized. and if students seem to enjoy
it and benefit from it, the Fair will be

expanded and improved in the future
Jackson said although each house
participating will have a table set up
in White Plaza, it has been left up to
them what they will do at the Fair
Ruth Brentari. social director at
Haus Mitteleuropa. the German
theme house on the Row. said that res
idents plan to set up a booth and dress
in Middle European costumes
We rt 1 going to sell apple streudel
and pretzels." Brentari said, "as well
as hand out coupons inviting students
to stop by Haus Mitt tor a tree glass of
beer
Sigma Chi Social Chairman Doug
Norm iv at a said that his fraternity de
cided to participate in the Row Fair
"This will be an opportunity for peo
ple to get true information about what
fraternities and rush is all about from
people who know," Normiyata said,
"not just from RAs and friends who
have never been in a frat."
Normiyata said a group of Sigma
Chi residents will be sitting at one of
the tables in White Plaza
"We re not planning on selling or
handing out anything." Normiyata
said. "We'll be there to talk "
Normiyata said the trats were
notified about the Fair at an Inter-
Fraternity Council meeting. He said
he doubted that 100 percent of the
fraternities would participate, but

added that Sigma Chi is hoping that
many will
Kairos. a self-operating house on
the Row. will not be represented at the
Fair, according to HA Kaia Blasz.
"They (the residents) voted not to
participate because they have no de
sire to bring attention to the house,"
Balsz said Others on the Row want
the exposure."
Blasz added she thought the Fair
would be especially valuable to
freshmen who had little if any interac
tion with houses on the Row-
Doug Nelsen. house manager at
Terra, said the house residents hope to
make their table lively
We'll have music and juggling and
people to talk with anyone who stops
bv," Nelsen said "We'll also be fea
turing famous Terra bread. Hopefully
we'll achieve a kind of street fair at
mosphere."
Nelsen said it is important for peo
ple to know that Terra is a co-op.
"There is also a general trend
within the house to try to be
ecologically and politically aware,"
he said. But this of course depends
totally on the people who are living in
the house "
Although the Row Fair is a new ele
ment in the housing selection process,
(.'onklin said the draw system will re
main essentially unchanged this vear.
