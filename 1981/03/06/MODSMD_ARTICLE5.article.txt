# Proposed budget to balance funds
## 
### Mike Resnick 
Despite the increased pressure applied by both
rising energy costs and inflation, a balanced Op
erating Budget for 1981-82 was presented at yes
terday's Faculty Senate meeting.
Increased 16 percent from last year to a total of
almost $178 million, this year's Operating Budget
accounts for about two-fifths of the $461 million
Consolidated Budget.
(The Operating Budget, comprised of the ex
penses of the schools and departments, libraries,
administration and much of the financial aid
awarded at the University, is one component of
the Consolidated Budget which deals with expen
ditures of the residences and dining halls, SLAC
and a substantial number of research grants and
contracts.)
One difficulty faced in the preparation of both
budgets is the current energy situation. Utility
costs will increase about 40 percent next year and
will account for about 8 percent of the Operating
Budget, according to the budget guidelines.
Acting Provost Albert Hastorf said this in
crease is especially hard to cope with because the
University has already announced a tuition hike
for next year of 13.6 percent. After this increase
was approved administrators unexpectedly
learned of a potential $1 million boost in energy

prices next year, he said
This increase was "really very severe," ac
cording to Tim Warner, assistant provost in the
Office of Management and Budget.
Although always a problem in recent years,
mounting energy costs are putting increased con
straints on the budget. It is not an item that can
be removed from budgetary considerations. As
the 92-page set of budget guidelines indicate
"Energy is one of the basic elements that support
the life of the University." Despite an energy
conservation program implemented in 1974.
costs have risen so quickly that the University's
energy expenditure over the past 10 years has in
creased at an average of 25 percent each year.
One area influenced by these added energy
costs is tuition, which supplies almost one-half of
the Operating Budget income. Included in the
budget presentation were proposals for tuition
hikes for the next several years.
Next year's 13.6 percent increase has been ap
proved, and in the two years after that, tuition
may go up at the rate of inflation (assumed to be
10 percent), plus 6 percent, pending approval of
the Board of Trustees. Then, in 1984-85 and in
1985-86, the proposed tuition increase will be in
flation plus 3 percent.
Administrators are quick to point out that

these increases are lower than those proposed by
many comparable institutions, among them
Harvard with a projected increase of 14.9 percent
and MIT with a boost of 19.4 percent. The Univer
sity will also increase financial aid by 29 percent.
The need for more aid stems in part from the
higher tuition Also, the number and amounts of
state scholarships awarded to Stanford students
have not kept up with costs here, Warner said.
However, the University's long-standing policy
of granting necessary aid to those students with
determined financial need is "absolute,"' accord
ing to Warner. The University will have to supply
60 percent of all student financial aid. according
to the proposed budget.
Another issue discussed by the Office of Man
agement and Budget is salary increases. Al
though faculty salary increases are determined
by the University according to department, the
overall average increase is "at least 12 percent,"
Hastorf said This was achieved by "the deans
with effort and strain."
Staff salaries will be increased by a similar
percentage, determined by inflation plus 2 per
cent, according to the proposed budget. This
raise is part of Stanford s effort to attract and
keep employees who are in extremely short supp-
ly in the Bay Area, according to Keith Smith, assistant
provost in the Office of Management and Budget
Hastorf informed the senate that the University is "los
ing ground to other corporations in the area" and said he
hopes that by raising "our salaries to the medians of our
local competitors." Stanford will be able to catch up "a lit
tle bit on the local market."
Hastorf also told the senate that 1 3 4 percent of the
budget was set aside for consolidation and improvement:
"that is the label for what we should call the real growth"
of the University.
Among some of the budget's recommendations in this
category are more funds to the Overseas Studies Pro
gram to cover costs generated by the higher inflation rates
at foreign campuses, money to the School of Humanities
and Sciences for teaching equipment and supplies and in
creased support for club sports.
The Board of Trustees will vote on the fiscal 1981-82

budget next week. There are still a number of factors
which could influence the budget within the next year. A
postal rate increase, soon to go before Congress, would al
ter the cost of postal service for the University if passed.
Uncertainty about President Ronald Reagan's plans
adds uncertainty to the planners' projections. No one is
quite sure exactly how and when the federal budget will be
cut. but it is possible that portions of Stanford's research
grants and contracts — accounting for almost $52 million
or more than 11 percent of the consolidated budget — will
be cut His policies could also affect the amount of student
aid received, particularly on the undergraduate level.
On the other hand, there may be federal tax deductions
for tuition payments. As Larry Owen, management as
sociate in Management and Financial Planning said, it's
even possible that Reagan might reduce inflation. Or, as
Warner said, "there's a lot hanging on the horizon and we
hope some good will come out of it."

postal rate increase, soon to go before Congress, would al
ter the cost of postal service for the University if passed.
Uncertainty about President Ronald Reagan's plans
adds uncertainty to the planners' projections. No one is
quite sure exactly how and when the federal budget will be
cut. but it is possible that portions of Stanford's research
grants and contracts — accounting for almost $52 million
or more than 11 percent of the consolidated budget — will
be cut His policies could also affect the amount of student
aid received, particularly on the undergraduate level.
On the other hand, there may be federal tax deductions
for tuition payments. As Larry Owen, management as
sociate in Management and Financial Planning said, it's
even possible that Reagan might reduce inflation. Or, as
Warner said, "there's a lot hanging on the horizon and we
hope some good will come out of it."
Despite the increased pressure applied by both
rising energy costs and inflation, a balanced Op
erating Budget for 1981-82 was presented at yes
terday's Faculty Senate meeting.
Increased 16 percent from last year to a total of
almost $178 million, this year's Operating Budget
accounts for about two-fifths of the $461 million
Consolidated Budget.
(The Operating Budget, comprised of the ex
penses of the schools and departments, libraries,
administration and much of the financial aid
awarded at the University, is one component of
the Consolidated Budget which deals with expen
ditures of the residences and dining halls, SLAC
and a substantial number of research grants and
contracts.)
One difficulty faced in the preparation of both
budgets is the current energy situation. Utility
costs will increase about 40 percent next year and
will account for about 8 percent of the Operating
Budget, according to the budget guidelines.
Acting Provost Albert Hastorf said this in
crease is especially hard to cope with because the
University has already announced a tuition hike
for next year of 13.6 percent. After this increase
was approved administrators unexpectedly
learned of a potential $1 million boost in energy

prices next year, he said
This increase was "really very severe," ac
cording to Tim Warner, assistant provost in the
Office of Management and Budget.
Although always a problem in recent years,
mounting energy costs are putting increased con
straints on the budget. It is not an item that can
be removed from budgetary considerations. As
the 92-page set of budget guidelines indicate
"Energy is one of the basic elements that support
the life of the University." Despite an energy
conservation program implemented in 1974.
costs have risen so quickly that the University's
energy expenditure over the past 10 years has in
creased at an average of 25 percent each year.
One area influenced by these added energy
costs is tuition, which supplies almost one-half of
the Operating Budget income. Included in the
budget presentation were proposals for tuition
hikes for the next several years.
Next year's 13.6 percent increase has been ap
proved, and in the two years after that, tuition
may go up at the rate of inflation (assumed to be
10 percent), plus 6 percent, pending approval of
the Board of Trustees. Then, in 1984-85 and in
1985-86, the proposed tuition increase will be in
flation plus 3 percent.
Administrators are quick to point out that

these increases are lower than those proposed by
many comparable institutions, among them
Harvard with a projected increase of 14.9 percent
and MIT with a boost of 19.4 percent. The Univer
sity will also increase financial aid by 29 percent.
The need for more aid stems in part from the
higher tuition Also, the number and amounts of
state scholarships awarded to Stanford students
have not kept up with costs here, Warner said.
However, the University's long-standing policy
of granting necessary aid to those students with
determined financial need is "absolute,"' accord
ing to Warner. The University will have to supply
60 percent of all student financial aid. according
to the proposed budget.
Another issue discussed by the Office of Man
agement and Budget is salary increases. Al
though faculty salary increases are determined
by the University according to department, the
overall average increase is "at least 12 percent,"
Hastorf said This was achieved by "the deans
with effort and strain."
Staff salaries will be increased by a similar
percentage, determined by inflation plus 2 per
cent, according to the proposed budget. This
raise is part of Stanford s effort to attract and
keep employees who are in extremely short supp-
ly in the Bay Area, according to Keith Smith, assistant
provost in the Office of Management and Budget
Hastorf informed the senate that the University is "los
ing ground to other corporations in the area" and said he
hopes that by raising "our salaries to the medians of our
local competitors." Stanford will be able to catch up "a lit
tle bit on the local market."
Hastorf also told the senate that 1 3 4 percent of the
budget was set aside for consolidation and improvement:
"that is the label for what we should call the real growth"
of the University.
Among some of the budget's recommendations in this
category are more funds to the Overseas Studies Pro
gram to cover costs generated by the higher inflation rates
at foreign campuses, money to the School of Humanities
and Sciences for teaching equipment and supplies and in
creased support for club sports.
The Board of Trustees will vote on the fiscal 1981-82

budget next week. There are still a number of factors
which could influence the budget within the next year. A
postal rate increase, soon to go before Congress, would al
