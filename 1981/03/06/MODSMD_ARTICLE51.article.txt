# Cardinals face California at home Saturday night

They've won only eight of 26
games. They need a victory in
their final game to avoid falling
into last place. And even if they
do win that game they'll have
only five conference victories,
matching their total of last sea
son. which was about as fruitful
as 1929 was for the New York
Stock Exchange
Nevertheless, the Stanford
Cardinals' 1980-81 season hasn't
been as gloomy as the records
appear. They upset UCLA,
played respectably twice
against No. 1-ranked Oregon
State and suffered few truly em
barrassing defeats. Perhaps the
best thing about this year's
Cards, who end their season Sat
urday night against California
at Maples Pavilion, is that
they've provided enough en
couragement to make their fol
lowers excited about next year.
Most importantly, the Cards
themselves are eager about the
1981-82 campaign. "There's def
initely a positive attitude,"

head coach Dick Dißiaso said.
"The players are thinking, 'We
took our lumps, and we learned,
but it's going tochange.' " As an
indication of the Cards' en
thusiasm, Dißiaso said that sev
eral players have already asked
him about spring workouts.
As nearly everybody on the
Farm knows by now, Stanford's
four freshmen provide the basis
for the team's optimism. John
Revelli, Keith Jones, Hans
Wichary and Roger Lemons
have accounted for more than
half of the Cards' scoring and
are even more responsible for
their improvement.
The first-year men weren't
instant successes, of course.
Stanford staggered to a 4-5 rec
ord in its pre-Pacific-10 Con
ference schedule while the team
and Dißiaso adjusted to having
three and occasionally all four
freshmen on the floor at once.
"We were exploited early,"
commented Dißiaso. "Teams
forced us to beat them with our
young people."

Pretty soon, the "young peo
ple" began gladly accepting the
challenges. Revelli scored 19
points, featuring an 11-for-12
performance from the foul line,
in an 82-76 victory at Oregon in
January. He added 23 more in
the Cards' 80-79 decision over
the Ducks last month at Maples
Pavilion.
Jones tallied a game-high 22
points in a 62-60 triumph over
Washington State and topped
that with a 23-point effort
against then sixth-ranked UCLA
in Stanford's 74-72 shocker Feb.
21. Revelli added 16 points and
Wichary collected 14 in that
game.
The contributions of the
freshmen haven't been limited
to a few games, however.
Revelli has already broken
Kimberly Belton's school rec
ord for most points scored by a
freshman (348, exceeding
Belton's 337 in 1976-77). The 6-
foot-8 center's 13.4 scoring aver
age ranks second on the team,
