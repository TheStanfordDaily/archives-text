The Cardinals Today has undergone several
changes this season. Basketball issues were
inserted in regular issues of The Stanford
Daily, to increase its availability, for the first
time. The Cardinals Today tried to give equal
time to the women's team, and included them
in the issue that was published the week of one
of their home games. This year, the statistics
have included player number for easy player
identification. Finally, there is a center photo
spread in this issue. I hope these changes have
made the Cardinals Today more enjoyable to
read, and I would like to thank everyone that
helped out this season.
