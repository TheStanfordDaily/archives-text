\4 nuclear attack on a United States city
i could be the final epidemic, a medical
catastrophe for which there could he no
cure/— l)r. Perrin French, Clinical
Assistant Professor in Psychiatry

Two 20 megaton nuclear
bombs detonated over San Fran
cisco would immediately kill 100
percent of the city's population.
The interval between launching
and detonation, assuming the
bombs were Soviet, would per
haps be fifteen minutes These,
and other horrific facts were
presented to the Distinguished
Faculty Forum on Tuesday
night by Dr. Perrin French.
Clinical Assistant Professor in
Psychiatry.
French was reporting on a
symposium he attended con
cerning "The Medical Conse
quences of Nuclear Weapons
and Nuclear War." The sym
posium, which was held in San
Francisco last November, was
organized by the Physicians for
Social Responsibility (PSR).
During the thirty years fol
lowing World War 11, the United
States and the Soviet Union fol
lowed a policy known as MAD —
Mutually Assured Destruction
The assumption that any coun
try initiating a nuclear attack
would be annihilated in return
served as a deterrent to the use
of nuclear weapons.
But development of the MX
Missile, and continued sophisti
cation of nuclear submarines
(which are highly elusive) have
convinced several top-level au
thorities that the U.S. may be
able to acquire preemptive first
strike capabilities. The Rus
sians share similar expecta
tions generated by advances in
their own nuclear technology.

Appalled by such considera
tions. physicians have banded
together "to spread a sobering
dose ot realism about the
scorched horror" that even a
"limited'' nuclear conflagra
tion would bring. Says French.

says that the strategy of the
group is to press for disarma
ment because attempts to sur
vive or recover from a nuclear
exchange are futile. According
to French, speakers at the sym
posium created the following af
termath scenario for the city ot
Boston A 20 megaton bomb det
onated over the city would de
stroy everyone and everything
within a 6-mile radius. Half the
people within a 20-mile radius
would be killed or injured
Winds between 300-400 miles
per hour would create vast fire
storms and tui n fall-out shelters
without independent air sup
plies into crematoria. Fall-out
would kill people hundreds of
miles trom Boston, and severe
burn victims in Boston alone
would number over 10,000 (the
number of intensive burn care
beds in the nation is about 1000).
Deaths from infections,
starvation, dehydration, and ra
diation sickness would continue
indefinitely; food and water
supplies would be permanently
contaminated. The remaining
population, according to the

symposium speakers, "would
be reduced to roving bands com
peting tor food "
Citing the fact that less than 2
percent of the nation's nuclear
weapons are needed to destroy
Russia's major cities (and as
suming that the Soviet Union
has comparable capabilities),
French concluded that "the
ecological, economic, and so
cial fabric upon which man de
pends for survival would be de
stroyed in a nuclear exchange.
He views as extremely dan
gerous the thought of nuclear
war "even as a 'rational' possi
bility." French said, "Medical
disaster planning for a nuclear
war is meaningless; there is no
effective civil defense."
The assumption that a nation
can survive a nuclear war
engenders the belief that a na
tion can uin a nuclear war.
Those who feel that a nuclear
war is "winnable" are more in
clined to initiate one. It is the
seminal assumption of the abili
ty to survive a nuclear war that
PSR is attacking: ' No one can
survive a nuclear war — efforts
at civil preparedness and medi
cal disaster planning represent
dangerous illusions."
French said the problem of
nuclear proliferation is due to
"bad decision-makers making
bad assumptions. I see no need,
however, to be funereal about
trying to save the world. There
can be joy in working with oth
ers, and the opportuinty to in
crease the chance of human sur
vival is unlimited," he said.
On this positive side of af
fairs. French noted that a PSR
letter sent to then-President
Jimmy Carter and Chairman
Leonid Brezhnev outlining the
principal dangers of nuclear
warfare received "encouraging
responses" from both leaders.
"If we can drive home' the
chilling facts concerning nucle
ar weapons, perhaps people will
push harder for disarmament,"
French concluded.

vive or recover from a nuclear
exchange are futile. According
to French, speakers at the sym

termath scenario for the city ot
Boston A 20 megaton bomb det
onated over the city would de
stroy everyone and everything
within a 6-mile radius. Half the
people within a 20-mile radius
would be killed or injured
Winds between 300-400 miles
per hour would create vast fire
storms and tui n fall-out shelters

plies into crematoria. Fall-out
would kill people hundreds of
miles trom Boston, and severe
burn victims in Boston alone
would number over 10,000 (the
number of intensive burn care
beds in the nation is about 1000).
Deaths from infections,
starvation, dehydration, and ra

supplies would be permanently
contaminated. The remaining

The assumption that a nation
can survive a nuclear war
engenders the belief that a na

Those who feel that a nuclear
war is "winnable" are more in

seminal assumption of the abili

PSR is attacking: ' No one can
survive a nuclear war — efforts
at civil preparedness and medi

French said the problem of
nuclear proliferation is due to
"bad decision-makers making
bad assumptions. I see no need,

Assistant Professor in Psychiatry

Two 20 megaton nuclear
bombs detonated over San Fran
cisco would immediately kill 100
percent of the city's population.
The interval between launching
and detonation, assuming the
bombs were Soviet, would per
haps be fifteen minutes These,
and other horrific facts were
presented to the Distinguished
Faculty Forum on Tuesday
night by Dr. Perrin French.
Clinical Assistant Professor in
Psychiatry.
French was reporting on a
symposium he attended con
cerning "The Medical Conse
quences of Nuclear Weapons
and Nuclear War." The sym
posium, which was held in San
Francisco last November, was
organized by the Physicians for
Social Responsibility (PSR).
During the thirty years fol
lowing World War 11, the United
States and the Soviet Union fol
lowed a policy known as MAD —
Mutually Assured Destruction
The assumption that any coun
try initiating a nuclear attack
would be annihilated in return
served as a deterrent to the use
of nuclear weapons.
But development of the MX
Missile, and continued sophisti
cation of nuclear submarines
(which are highly elusive) have
