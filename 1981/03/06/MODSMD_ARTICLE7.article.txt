# SLAC to face hard times, Reagan budget

As federal funding to the sci
ences grows increasingly
threatened, the military budget
storms ahead, boosted by the
new administration.
"They've cut 41 million al
ready, and are looking for an
other three to six," said pro
fessor Sidney Drell at the Politi
cal Science Luncheon Series
last Tuesday. Drell, Deputy Di
rector of Stanford's Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), will
go to Washington this week to
confront these problems. Drell,
who is also Chairman of the U.S.
Department of Energy's High
Energy Physics Advisory
Panel, advisor on National Se

curity Affairs to the Defense
Department, and advisor to the
Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency, will speak before

ening the blow of the Reagan
budget cuts to the sciences.
The Department of Energy
and the National Science Foun
dation now supply funding
for research in 100 universities
across the country, as well as
for the country's three particle
accelerators, including SLAC.
Stanford's accelerator cost $60
million per year to operate part
time.
"We can't pay the power bill
to run it." said Drell.
In response to a question con
cerning the possible elimination
ot the Department of Energy,
Drell added that scientific re
search projects such as that
done at SLAC will continue to
receive government funding,
with or without the DOE.
"The question is not whether
we will support the sciences, but
at what level." Drell pointed out
the expenditure of the U.S. to
the sciences as opposed to other
countries. "Western Europe
spends twice the fraction of
their GNP on advanced re
search and technology," he
said.
Despite the recent surge of
funds to military oriented re
search. there remain serious in
adequacies in the proposed

projects. Drell noted the MX
"race track" system as a major
problem area. The MX is a "stu
pid idea" according to Drell.
who agrees heartily with De
fense Secretary Caspar Wein-

berger's review of the project.
"I'm glad they have an open
mind and are willing to look at
all the options," said Drell.
He explained briefly the three
parts to our strategic defense
which include: bombs loaded
with cruise missiles; nuclear
submarines loaded originally
with Polaris, then Poseidon,
and now Trident missiles; and
Intercontinental Ballistic Mis
siles (ICBM's). including 1000
Minutemen and 53 Titans which
sit underground in hardened
silos.
With the advent of Soviet Mul
tiple Independently Targeted
Reentry Vehicles (MIRV's).
one missile has the power to de
stroy many silos. The MX. said
Dreil, is like a shell game
planned to operate underneath
10,000 square miles of Nevada
and Utah land. One missile and
22 decoys would be transported
along an extensive track system
from one. as Drell termed them,
"pit stop'" to another.
"It's a crazy system, and bad
tor arms control." he said. The
secrecy and deception that it en
tails violates the basis of arms
control. How could we verify

that we have only one real mis
sile on the tracks 9 Submarines,
on the other hand, are verified in
the construction phase.
"We watch their shipyards,
and they watch ours." said
Drell.
Drell added emphatically
that the sole purpose ot nuclear
weapons is to deter war And
once they are used, the world
faces annihilation.
With 50,000 nuclear weapons
between them, the U.S. and the
Soviet Union hold each other
hostage. Many other countries
also have the power to cause in
calculable damage. One bomb,
if detonated, said Drell, would
kill 100 million people instantly,
maim another 100 million, and
leave a deadly radioactive cloud
in its wake.
The increasing proliferation
of these weapons leads many
countries to forget the morality
of causing such a nightmare,
and instead revert to nuclear
statistics.
"Why are they fine tuning
the thunderbolts?" asked
Drell.
Thus far. 35 years since
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the
use ot nuclear weapons has been
avoided But how long can this
last? The U.S. has entered into
several arms agreements which
have all been relatively ineffec
tive.
"SALT has not made nearly
as much progress as I'd hoped.''
said Drell.
"I'm an optimist." Drell con
cluded; "we've got to hope that
the responsible people of the
world realize the catastrophe ot
nuclear war."

In response to a question con
cerning the possible elimination
ot the Department of Energy,
Drell added that scientific re
search projects such as that
done at SLAC will continue to
receive government funding,
with or without the DOE.
"The question is not whether
we will support the sciences, but
at what level." Drell pointed out
the expenditure of the U.S. to
the sciences as opposed to other
countries. "Western Europe
spends twice the fraction of
their GNP on advanced re
search and technology," he
said.
Despite the recent surge of
funds to military oriented re
search. there remain serious in
adequacies in the proposed

projects. Drell noted the MX
"race track" system as a major
problem area. The MX is a "stu
pid idea" according to Drell.
who agrees heartily with De
fense Secretary Caspar Wein-

berger's review of the project.
"I'm glad they have an open
mind and are willing to look at
all the options," said Drell.
He explained briefly the three
parts to our strategic defense
which include: bombs loaded
with cruise missiles; nuclear
submarines loaded originally
with Polaris, then Poseidon,
and now Trident missiles; and
Intercontinental Ballistic Mis
siles (ICBM's). including 1000
Minutemen and 53 Titans which
sit underground in hardened
silos.

tiple Independently Targeted
Reentry Vehicles (MIRV's).
one missile has the power to de
stroy many silos. The MX. said
Dreil, is like a shell game
planned to operate underneath
10,000 square miles of Nevada
and Utah land. One missile and
22 decoys would be transported
along an extensive track system
from one. as Drell termed them,
"pit stop'" to another.
"It's a crazy system, and bad
tor arms control." he said. The
secrecy and deception that it en
tails violates the basis of arms
control. How could we verify

that we have only one real mis
sile on the tracks 9 Submarines,
on the other hand, are verified in
the construction phase.
"We watch their shipyards,
and they watch ours." said
Drell.
Drell added emphatically
that the sole purpose ot nuclear
weapons is to deter war And
once they are used, the world
faces annihilation.
With 50,000 nuclear weapons
between them, the U.S. and the
Soviet Union hold each other
hostage. Many other countries
also have the power to cause in
calculable damage. One bomb,
if detonated, said Drell, would
kill 100 million people instantly,
maim another 100 million, and
leave a deadly radioactive cloud
in its wake.
The increasing proliferation
of these weapons leads many
countries to forget the morality
of causing such a nightmare,
and instead revert to nuclear
statistics.
"Why are they fine tuning
the thunderbolts?" asked
Drell.
Thus far. 35 years since
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the
use ot nuclear weapons has been
avoided But how long can this
last? The U.S. has entered into
several arms agreements which
have all been relatively ineffec
tive.
"SALT has not made nearly
as much progress as I'd hoped.''
said Drell.
"I'm an optimist." Drell con
cluded; "we've got to hope that
the responsible people of the
world realize the catastrophe ot
nuclear war."
As federal funding to the sci
ences grows increasingly
threatened, the military budget
storms ahead, boosted by the
new administration.
"They've cut 41 million al
ready, and are looking for an
other three to six," said pro
fessor Sidney Drell at the Politi
cal Science Luncheon Series
last Tuesday. Drell, Deputy Di
rector of Stanford's Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), will
go to Washington this week to
confront these problems. Drell,
