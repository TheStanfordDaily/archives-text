## Moral majority is a dangerous minority 
### 
Most people apparently are
unaware of what a small but vo
cal special interest group is
doing in American politics. Al
though the Daily supports per
sonal and collective involve
ment in politics, we do not sup
port the extremism and fanat
ical tactics that the Moral Ma
jority is using to further its in
put into the political process.
It would be an unreasonable
overreaction to deny the Moral
Majority input into the political
and decision-making process.
However, the views and goals
the group espouses, with some
apparent success, are not those
held by the general public. Al
lowing the views and beliefs of a
vocal minority to dictate public
policy is an injustice.
By claiming to be a religious

group, the Moral Majority
achieves tax-exempt status.
However, it is a political action
group Its tax exemption gives it
an unfair advantage over other
political action groups — most
of which arc taxable.
Although few actions of this
group have faced successful le
gal challenge, many are highly
distasteful. Notorious examples
include examining the records
of public libraries for the names
of individuals who have bor
rowed material deemed "unac
ceptable" and attempting to
stop libraries from purchasing
materials which conflict with
their conception of morality.
An example ot what this
group wishes to put into law is
Senate Bill 1808. the so-called
"family protection bill," in

troduced in the last Congress by
Senator Paul Laxalt (R-Nev ).
This bill would:
— restore prayer in public
schools
— prohibit federal programs
to fund abortions, contraception
and the treatment of venereal
disease
— prevent state and federal
authorities from "impeding"
private schools through such in
trusions as denying tax sub
sidies to racially segregated
schools.
— end federal programs de
signed to prevent child abuse
— halt federal protection of
the civil rights of those with
"perverse lifestyles" such as
homosexuality.
If the evangelical right is tru
ly concerned with improving the

environment in which Ameri
ca's children grow up. perhaps
it should not eliminate valuable
programs that deal with serious
problems in favor of efforts to
control uncertain influences.
The so-called Moral Majority
is able to effect these changes in
public policy and people's lives
because of to the lack of interest
which the true' majority has in
effecting the political process.
For the rights and lives of many
to be restrained and dictated by
the views of a vocal few seems a
travesty in a democratic sys
tem. Americans have a respon
sibility to reexamine their com
mitment to the American politi
cal process lest majority apathy
lead democracy in this country
further toward minority, spe
cial interest rule.
