## Actor turns into director 
### 
There's another "United States Intervention'
movie out this year: El Salvador Now, from
American Taxpayers Studios. Unfortunately, this
movie's plot is all too similar to that of other mov
ies. In spite of this, people are filling the theaters.
A major problem with El Salvador Now lies in
its screenplay, based like so many other "in
terventionist" films, on The Great Brain Rob
bery. by Joseph McCarthy. While these "red
threat" screenplays seemed fresh when they first
appeared. Alexander Haig's script is just another
tired rehash of 25 year-old material. I hope he and
others will finally give up this overworked theme
some day and move on to some other sort of plot.
President Ronald Reagan turns in a rather
weak performance in his first effort as director,
which also detracts from El Salvador Now. While
Reagan has no problem setting the scenes, most
of the actors seem to have been responsive to his
direction, and the film's editing can only be de
scribed as atrocious. Perhaps he should return to
acting.
There are bright spots, however. Robert White
puts in a stunning performance as the reform-ori
ented ex-ambassador, as does the Catholic Church
in its second supporting role this season (follow
ing the widely acclaimed 9 to 5 with Saturdays
Off. behind Lech Walesa). One can only hope
these rising stars will return in more promising
films in the future. The Sandinistas also play a
credible, if uneven, role throughout the film.
Unfortunately, not all the acting is as wonder
ful. Frederic Chapin is unconvincing at best as the
new ambassador and Jose Napoleon Duarte fares
no better in his role as the dictator. Cuba, while
receiving top billing, puts in only a cameo ap
pearance, and a rather ridiculous and totally su

perfluous one at that. One wonders why it was
written in the first place.
Another major problem with the acting in El
Salvador Nou was that the Lone Star State's role
as the final domino. While Thailand and others
have been able to play this difficult role with some
degree of competency, the Lone Star State is en
tirely unbelievable in its role. The casting direc
tor should never have even considered the Lone
Star State for such a role.
El Salvador .Voir suffers from one other major
problem: special effects. These problems range
from the often inaccurate information provided
by the technical advisor, the Intelligence Com
munity; to the ineptitude of the Rapid Deploy
ment Force in its scenes near the end of the film;
to the Pentagon, as special effects director, and
its inability to provide an effective special effect.
Many of these technical problems are similar to
those in the Pentagon's last effort. The Viet Cong
Strikes Back, and are a mixture of internal and
external problems, many of them stemming from
the script itself. Yet one would have hoped they
would have learned from their previous failures.
In spite of all these problems, people are flock
ing to the theater to see El Salvador Now. One
reason is. no doubt, that admission is free. Some
members of the audience do disappear at random
points through the movie, but this seems to have
deterred very few from going to see it anyway.
Another reason why people want to see El
Salvador Nou may be the special effects: bad as
they are. they do show a lot of violence, which is
always popular. Still, one has to wonder.
