## Gen. Pinochet perpetuates regime in Chile with today's inauguration 
### Los Angeles Times 
Santiago, Chile — There will
not be a jewel-studded crown, or
royal robes, but the inaugura
tion today of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet as president of Chile
has the definite aura of an em
peror's coronation.
In fact, "inauguration" does
not really describe what will
take place when the 61-year-old
general takes the oath of office
— perpetuation may be a better
word.
For the ceremony will really
do nothing more than give paper
legality to the authoritarian
rule that Pinochet established 7
1-2 years ago after the bloody
overthrow of Marxist President
Salvador Allende.
Under a constitution ap
proved in a plebiscite last fall,
Pinochet is assuming the presi
dency for a term lasting until
1989. At that point he can choose
to be reappointed for another
eight years, all without elec
tions.
Military strength
One symbol of Pinochet's
power will be on full display dur
ing the Wednesday ceremones:
the military.
More than 11,000 troops will
parade by El Moneda. former
residence of President Salvador
Allende, many goose-stepping
and wearing the same type
helmets that typified Nazi sol
diers. El Moneda was de
molished by air strikes during
the coup that brought Pinochet
to power.
This military might is more
than the traditional display that
can be seen during national ceie
brations even in full de
mocracies. at least in the minds

of Pinochet's opponents.
Yet, it is obvious that the situ
ation is not all that clear cut.
There are few armed troops
in the city, certainly far fewer
than in such democratic coun
tries as Ecuador and Colombia.
And despite opposition
charges that the October
plebiscite was rigged, foreign
diplomats think that the official
count of 68 percent approval
probably was close to being ac
curate.
Part of this supposed ap
proval no doubt would be based
on the solid and continuing pros
perity that Chile has enjoyed un
der the military rule.
In his years in office,
Pinochet has turned Chile into a
model of a free enterprise,
open-market economy.
Construction is booming and
real-income growth, even after
inflation, is said to average be
tween 4 percent and 6 percent.
Even in the five months since
the plebiscite, economic
progress is clear. There are
fewer beggars and fewer street
vendors.
Anti-government violence
In the last five months, there
have been a series of anti-gov
ernment acts of violence, start
ing with the assassination of a
ranking military officer and
continuing through a series of
bank robberies, attacks on
power stations and other gov
ernment installations, and
against such symbols of upper
middle-class life style as dis
cotheques.
Those attacks generally are
attributed to a hard-line leftist
organization known as the MIR
— leftist revolutionary move

ment — which has promised to
violently oppose Pinochet's in
auguration.
Government spokesmen
seem anxious to blame the MIR
in what appears to be the belief
that the alleged existence of ter
rorist groups can justify
Pinochet's continued political
repression.
Some diplomatic observers,
on the other hand, think the MIR
has been reduced to a tiny group
of no more than 200 without the
resources or popular support to
do more than harass and embar
rass the government.
The issue of terrorism and the
existence of the MIR is a bit of a
quandary for Pinochet. He uses
the threat of terrorism as a jus
tification for the continuation of
a state of emergency, which al
lows him to do nearly anything
he wants by simply issuing
decrees.
Extension
The state of emergency was
to have expired today, but over
the weekend, the general or
dered an extension.
Human rights leaders believe
that the general will use the ex
tension to crack down hard on
dissenters. They cite incidents
of people accused of violating
national security because of
their human rights activities as
examples.
Pinochet has banned all or
ganized partisan activity, in
cluding political parties, and he
has exiled many important op
position leaders.
The regime also continues its
policy of sending into internal
exile (called relegation here),
not just leaders, but any politi
cal opponent who conceivably

might become a leader
Not all of the regime's actions
are so blunt and obvious Since
taking power, Pinochet has
carefully dismembered the
traditional power bases of
potential opponents, such as
unions and labor federations.
Though many people are un
happy about Pinochet's poli
cies, they do not view him as a
bloodthirsty tyrant. After all.
they say, there is a relatively
free press, people come and go
as they please for the most part,
and even in areas where the gov
ernment has been weak, such as
in providing houses, plans are
under way for corrections.
