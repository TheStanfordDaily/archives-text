# Israel's balance of power
## Dayan hopes party maneuvers will sway June election 
### Los Angeles Times 
Jerusalem — Although both major Israeli political
blocs have reason to consider him a deserter, Moshe
Dayan hopes to maneuver into a position that will allow
him to determine the outcome of the June 30 election
and the future of the Middle East peace process.
Dayan, foreign minister in one party's Cabinet and
defense minister in another's, says he will decide in
April if he will enter the June 30 election as the head of a
new political grouping. The smart money says he will.
Public opinion polls indicate that although Dayan has
no chance of becoming prime minister, his slate of can
didates could win enough seats in the 120-member
Knesset to hold the balance of power between the larg
er Likud and Labor blocs.
If that happens, Dayan could barter his support to the
party that offers him the greatest degree of influence,
especially concerning efforts to make peace with the
Arab world.
To be sure, Dayan would have to be extremely lucky
to produce such an outcome. The Labor Party of former
Defense Minister Shimon Peres and its allied groupings
hold a commanding lead at present over Prime Min
ister Menachem Begin s Likud bloc. But many public
opinion polls show that as much as 40 peroent of the
electorate is still undecided, indicating a dissatisfac
tion with both major parties that Dayan hopes to ex
ploit.

Although Dayan appears to be seeking a center posi
tion between Labor and Likud, his effort is based more
on his charismatic personality than on any ideological
dimension.
Since he resigned as foreign minister Oct. 21, 1979,
following a policy dispute with Begin, Dayan has
spoken out on security matters and on his own inten
tionally vague plan for Arab autonomy on the occupied
West Bank of the Jordan River and in the Gaza Strip.
But he has not shown any particular interest in the sort
of economic and social issues that are likely to domi
nate the campaign.
Opinion polls indicate that public dissatisfaction
with Israel's economic ills — the inflation rate is 130
percent a year — is what pushed Labor ahead of Likud.
Begin and his finance minister, Yoram Aridor, have
launched a new economic program featuring tax cuts
that would cut the price of such consumer items as tele
vision sets, automobiles and refrigerators.
Stimulation of consumer demand in an inflationary
economy flies in the face of conventional economic the
ory, but Aridor says the program will dampen infla
tionary expectations and ultimately slow the pace of
rising prices.
The polls show that a Dayan-led slate would pull far
more votes from Labor than from the Likud. So, despite
his pox-on-both-houses stand, a Dayan candidacy would
be much better news for Begin than for Peres.

Nevertheless, the chance of a Dayan candidacy is a
worrisome matter to the Labor Party. Some sort of
deal ultimately may be struck but apparently Dayan's
price is still too high.
By one account, Dayan would stay out of the election
race entirely if Peres would promise to make him a sort
of super-minister authorized to negotiate peace agree
ments with Arab states and to control the adminis
tration of the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
But Dayan's potential for damage to Labor's cause is
not considered particularly funny by the party's lead
ers.
Four years ago, Begin s election victory was aided
by the sudden emergence of the Democratic Movement
for Change. That was a middle-of-the-road party that
appealed to a generally well-educated middle-class
electorate that was weary of both major blocs and un
willing to join any of the small, single-issue parties that
dot Israel's political landscape.
The Democratic Movement won 15 seats in the last
election, joining the government coalition as the sec
ond largest party behind the Likud. But the party began
to fall apart almost at once and it disappeared entirely
early this year with the announcement that its leader,
Deputy Prime Minister Yigael Yadin, would retire
from politics and the other members would join other
parties.
