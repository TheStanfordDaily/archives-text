# Double disaster: flood and drought leave China's people suffering disease, famine
## 
### 
Beijing — Millions of
peasants in the province encom
passing the Chinese capital are
suffering from hunger, serious
malnutrition and infectious dis
eases as result of the worst
drought in 38 years, according to
international relief officials
who recently visited the area.
Ironically, in the southern
province of Hubei, also visited
in recent weeks by two United
Nations relief teams, the most
violent flooding in 26 years is
said to be causing similarly
staggering health and food prob
lems for millions of homeless
peasants in the important rice
growing region.
Relief officials also reported
huge crop losses in waterlogged

Hubei and six parched prov
inces in the north — areas that
normally produce a large por
tion of China's food needs. Grain
production is said to have
dropped 18 million tons last year
in the two stricken regions.
The relief teams' findings
provide the first evidence of
widespread human suffering
and economic loss caused by the
drought and flooding. As in past
cases of natural disaster or ex
amples of extreme poverty, Bei
jing has revealed few details to
the public on the twin
calamities.
U.N. assistance
Last December, Beijing, fi
nancially strapped by a large
budget deficit, quietly departed

from past policy by formally
asking for U.N. assistance to ab
sorb the tremendous costs of
disaster relief that have been
conservatively set at $500 mil
lion.
Relief officials believe that
immediate delivery of medi
cine, clothing and millions of
tons of grain is necessary to help
the Chinese government avert
serious outbreaks of disease and
starvation in rural sections of
Hubei Province and the
northern province of Hebei,
which surrounds Beijing.
The U.N. Disaster Relief
Group quietly has been circulat
ing drafts of its report among
embassies in Beijing, hoping to
solicit financial support from
affluent countries.
Although no official figures
have been released, relief of
ficials say they have been told
that 700 people already have
died and 5000 have fallen ill or
have been injured as result of
the flooding and drought in the
two provinces.
In Hebei Province, the
hardest hit of the six northern
provinces parched by the 20-
month drought, relief officials
said that as much as a third of
Hebei s population is subsisting
on insufficient grain rations and
lack drinking water and cooking
fuel.
Nutrients needed
Although the government pro
vides almost one pound of
course grain a day to each needy
person, relief experts said, the
cereal lacks the vitamins and
protein necessary for proper
nutrition and resistance to in
fectious diseases that are espe
cially prevalent in im
poverished regions.
A large number of the chil
dren in Hebei examined by phy
sicians, according to relief ex
perts, had rickets, bleeding
gums, anemia, hepatitis and vi
tamin deficiencies. Exact per
centages of diseased children

and other specific figures were
unavailable.
In Hebei, which traditionally
produces 5 percent of China's
food crop and a quarter of the
nation's cotton output, the main
reservoirs and numerous rivers
have dried up to half their usual
volume, leaving little water for
irrigation of the once productive
fields, relief officials said.
• In the poor villages, where
many wells have gone dry,
peasants often have to walk sev
eral miles to deep wells to find
drinking water. Some villagers
draw their water from ditches
and unsanitary ponds, the of
ficials added, increasing the
chance of contracting intestinal
diseases.
Visitors to Hubei Province in
the fertile Yangtze River basin
of South China found the op
posite problem experienced by
Hebei — too much water left be
hind by the torrential rains that
dumped 52 inches in three
months from May to August of
last year.
The rains forced breaks in
more than 100 dikes containing
tributaries of the Yangtse,
sweeping away thousands of
homes, bridges, power stations
and schools and leaving more
than six million peasants
without homes, personal
possessions and crops, accord
ing to relief experts.
The relief team was told that
Chinese doctors who conducted
examinations found that 97 per
cent of the children tested had
rickets and 30 percent had
anemia. Forty percent of the
mothers tested had no or insuffi
cient breast milk.
Relief officials said that the
food stocks in stricken areas of
Hubei were almost depleted
now. The food supply is not ex
pected to improve without out
side help, they said, because the
flooding made it impossible for
farmers to start their spring
planting this year.

dumped 52 inches in three
months from May to August of
last year.
The rains forced breaks in
more than 100 dikes containing
tributaries of the Yangtse,
sweeping away thousands of
homes, bridges, power stations
and schools and leaving more
than six million peasants
without homes, personal
possessions and crops, accord
ing to relief experts.
The relief team was told that
Chinese doctors who conducted
examinations found that 97 per
cent of the children tested had
rickets and 30 percent had
anemia. Forty percent of the
mothers tested had no or insuffi
cient breast milk.
Relief officials said that the
food stocks in stricken areas of
Hubei were almost depleted
now. The food supply is not ex
pected to improve without out
side help, they said, because the
flooding made it impossible for
farmers to start their spring
planting this year.
Beijing — Millions of
peasants in the province encom
passing the Chinese capital are
suffering from hunger, serious
malnutrition and infectious dis
eases as result of the worst
drought in 38 years, according to
international relief officials
who recently visited the area.
Ironically, in the southern
province of Hubei, also visited
in recent weeks by two United
Nations relief teams, the most
violent flooding in 26 years is
said to be causing similarly
staggering health and food prob
lems for millions of homeless
peasants in the important rice
growing region.
Relief officials also reported
huge crop losses in waterlogged

Hubei and six parched prov
inces in the north — areas that
normally produce a large por
tion of China's food needs. Grain
production is said to have
dropped 18 million tons last year
in the two stricken regions.
The relief teams' findings
provide the first evidence of
widespread human suffering
and economic loss caused by the
drought and flooding. As in past
cases of natural disaster or ex
amples of extreme poverty, Bei
jing has revealed few details to
the public on the twin
calamities.
U.N. assistance
Last December, Beijing, fi
nancially strapped by a large
budget deficit, quietly departed

from past policy by formally
asking for U.N. assistance to ab
sorb the tremendous costs of
disaster relief that have been
conservatively set at $500 mil
lion.
Relief officials believe that
immediate delivery of medi
cine, clothing and millions of
tons of grain is necessary to help
the Chinese government avert
serious outbreaks of disease and
starvation in rural sections of
Hubei Province and the
northern province of Hebei,
which surrounds Beijing.
The U.N. Disaster Relief
Group quietly has been circulat
ing drafts of its report among
embassies in Beijing, hoping to
solicit financial support from
affluent countries.
Although no official figures
have been released, relief of
ficials say they have been told
that 700 people already have
died and 5000 have fallen ill or
have been injured as result of
the flooding and drought in the
two provinces.
In Hebei Province, the
hardest hit of the six northern
provinces parched by the 20-
month drought, relief officials
said that as much as a third of
Hebei s population is subsisting
on insufficient grain rations and
lack drinking water and cooking
fuel.
Nutrients needed
Although the government pro
vides almost one pound of
course grain a day to each needy
person, relief experts said, the
cereal lacks the vitamins and
protein necessary for proper
nutrition and resistance to in
fectious diseases that are espe
cially prevalent in im
poverished regions.
A large number of the chil
dren in Hebei examined by phy
sicians, according to relief ex
perts, had rickets, bleeding
gums, anemia, hepatitis and vi
tamin deficiencies. Exact per
centages of diseased children

and other specific figures were
unavailable.
In Hebei, which traditionally
produces 5 percent of China's
food crop and a quarter of the
nation's cotton output, the main
reservoirs and numerous rivers
have dried up to half their usual
volume, leaving little water for
irrigation of the once productive
fields, relief officials said.
• In the poor villages, where
many wells have gone dry,
peasants often have to walk sev
eral miles to deep wells to find
drinking water. Some villagers
draw their water from ditches
and unsanitary ponds, the of
ficials added, increasing the
chance of contracting intestinal
diseases.
Visitors to Hubei Province in
the fertile Yangtze River basin
of South China found the op
posite problem experienced by
Hebei — too much water left be
hind by the torrential rains that
dumped 52 inches in three
months from May to August of
last year.
