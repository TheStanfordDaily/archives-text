# Global 2000 predictions show: more people, more shortages
## 
### Laurie Emerson 
Speaking to a large audience
in the Business School's Bishop
Auditorium Friday, fusion
energy physicist Dr. Gerald
Barney discussed the con
clusions and implications of
Global 2000, a report he helped
to prepare for President Jimmy
Carter. One of the world s lead
ing experts on trends in popu
lation, the environment and re
sources, Barney explained that
the Global 2000 report was de
signed to make projections con
cerning the state of these areas
in the year 2000.
The report, based on research
done by people in 14 different
governmental agencies, was in
tended to facilitate long-range
analysis and future planning.
Those compiling Global 2000 had
much information available to
them, and Barney called the re
port "data rich." He noted,
however, the difficulty of weav
ing together the results of re
search performed by people
from different agencies who had
never met each other.
Barney said that Global 2000
contains several assumptions
which should be kept in mind
when examining the report's
findings. These assumptions are
that present public policies will
continue, that technology will
develop consistently, and that
no major wars or economic dis
ruptions will occur. Barney
noted that this last qualification
does not take into account the
war in Iran.
Acknowledging that certain
aspects of the report are er
roneous or contradictory,
Barney stressed that overall
Global 2000 represents the best
professional work of experts.
According to Global 2000
there is no end in sight to popu
lation growth. By the year 2000
the population will have grown
from today's four billion to 6.35
billion, with growth at that time
40 percent faster than it is to
day. These projections, pre
pared by the Bureau of the
Census, say that 90 percent of
this growth will come from less
developed nations and urban
areas in particular. For exam
ple, Barney told a surprised au
dience, Mexico City in the year
2000 will have 30 million people
in it or three times the popu
lation of New York City today.
The report says the economy
will continue to expand rapidly,
but projections prepared by the
World Bank and The CIA in
dicate that the gap between the
richest and poorest nations will
increase dramatically by the
year 2000.
The Department of Agricul
ture predicts that by the year
2000 food production will have
increased by 91 percent. How
ever, food will not be distributed

well, at the expense of less de
veloped nations. In addition, be
cause farmers and other food
producers will have to cope with
diminishing returns and rapidly
increasing energy costs, Barney
warned the audience to expect a
100 percent increase in the real
cost of food by the year 2000.
Barney also addressed
himself to the growing scarcity
of natural resources. According
to Global 2000, the world's for
ests are shrinking rapidly: a 40
percent decrease by the year
2000, concentrated particularly
in less developed nations, is an
ticipated.
Because of overwhelming
population growth Barney said
that water requirements will
more than double by the year
2000, with regional shortages in
creasing and water becoming
more costly.

Development based on the idea of
'making the whole world look like L. A.'
will not work.
— Dr. Gerald Barney

Barney reported that no seri
ous problems are predicted for
non-fuel minerals but explained
that the methodology used to ob
tain this result is unsound be
cause it discounts the impact of
the energy shortage on non-fuel
minerals.
The Department of Energy
oil projects, which extend only
to the year 1995 due to cost bar
riers, indicate that oil produc
tion will peak in the '90s and that
a transition to nuclear and coal
energy sources will be neces
sary.
Barney told the audience that
he would not cover all of the en
vironmental implications of the
Global 2000 report. Instead he
wished to emphasize what he
sees as the two fundamental en
vironmental consequences of
continued global expansion.
First the cited soil de
terioration and erosion which
result from increasingly in
tensive agricultural techniques
as well as from the expanded
grazing due to the growth of
nomad tribes. Barney said that
because of soil deterioration
depleted forests cannot be re
plenished, and stressed the im
portance of developing tech
niques to protect and improve
soil.
Second, Barney expressed
concern over the atmospheric
problems caused by increasing
quantities of carbon dioxide and
ozone-depleting chemicals. He
said that unless some changes
are made in the next 20 years,
carbon dioxide will cause a ma
jor climate change by the year
2050.

Barney directed his closing
remarks specifically to the au
dience of future businessmen
and women by detailing what he
feels are the implications of the
Global 2000 report for those in
volved with business. Prefacing
his remarks with the statement
that "business is clearly depen
dent on a lot of resources,"
Barney said that future busi
nessmen and women will need
to learn to manage the future
period of transition as the world
reaches its maximum carrying
capacity.
Barney said each agency in
volved in Global 2000 main
tained that their sector of the
economy will confront the prob
lem of diminishing returns and
will need to implement a real
price increase. Those in busi
ness need to be aware of the per
sistence and escalation of infla-

tion implied by this fact. Barney
also said that future busi
nessmen and women should re
alize that many companies are
concerned about the viability of
long-term investments and
loans and that the International
Monetary System is troubled
and fragile, resembling a
"house of cards."
In answering questions from
the audience, Barney qualified
the pessimistic findings of the
Global 2000 report by saying
that he believes there are some
encouraging notes. Explaining
that international interest in the
report's findings is crucial,
Barney said that Global 2000 has
been translated into German
and is currently No. 1 on the
bestseller list in Japan. He ex
pressed his hope that more and
more nations will come to re
alize that development based on
the idea of "making the whole
world look like L.A." will not
work.
He also emphasized the im
portance of making contracep
tives available to all who want
them. Beyond that, he said, in
fant mortality rates must be re
duced because people are more
likely to have lots of children if
they fear that not all of them
will survive.
When asked jokingly at what
point he "called in the priest and
the rabbi," Barney replied, "I
keep talking with the priests and
the rabbis all along. If we do
nothing it means the demise of
the human race." He added,
more optimistically, that he
does not foresee the imminent
end of civilization.

in it or three times the popu
lation of New York City today.
The report says the economy
will continue to expand rapidly,
but projections prepared by the
World Bank and The CIA in
dicate that the gap between the
richest and poorest nations will
increase dramatically by the
year 2000.
The Department of Agricul
ture predicts that by the year
2000 food production will have
increased by 91 percent. How
ever, food will not be distributed

well, at the expense of less de
veloped nations. In addition, be
cause farmers and other food
producers will have to cope with
diminishing returns and rapidly
increasing energy costs, Barney
warned the audience to expect a
100 percent increase in the real
cost of food by the year 2000.
Barney also addressed
himself to the growing scarcity
of natural resources. According
to Global 2000, the world's for
ests are shrinking rapidly: a 40
percent decrease by the year
2000, concentrated particularly
in less developed nations, is an
ticipated.
Because of overwhelming
population growth Barney said
that water requirements will
more than double by the year
2000, with regional shortages in
creasing and water becoming
more costly.

Development based on the idea of
'making the whole world look like L. A.'
will not work.
— Dr. Gerald Barney

Barney reported that no seri
ous problems are predicted for
non-fuel minerals but explained
that the methodology used to ob
tain this result is unsound be
cause it discounts the impact of
the energy shortage on non-fuel
minerals.
The Department of Energy
oil projects, which extend only
to the year 1995 due to cost bar
riers, indicate that oil produc
tion will peak in the '90s and that
a transition to nuclear and coal
energy sources will be neces
sary.
Barney told the audience that
he would not cover all of the en
vironmental implications of the
Global 2000 report. Instead he
wished to emphasize what he
sees as the two fundamental en
vironmental consequences of
continued global expansion.
First the cited soil de
terioration and erosion which
result from increasingly in
tensive agricultural techniques
as well as from the expanded
grazing due to the growth of
nomad tribes. Barney said that
because of soil deterioration
depleted forests cannot be re
plenished, and stressed the im
portance of developing tech
niques to protect and improve
soil.
Second, Barney expressed
concern over the atmospheric
problems caused by increasing
quantities of carbon dioxide and
ozone-depleting chemicals. He
said that unless some changes
are made in the next 20 years,
carbon dioxide will cause a ma
jor climate change by the year
2050.

Barney directed his closing
remarks specifically to the au
dience of future businessmen
and women by detailing what he
feels are the implications of the
Global 2000 report for those in
volved with business. Prefacing
his remarks with the statement
that "business is clearly depen
dent on a lot of resources,"
Barney said that future busi
nessmen and women will need
to learn to manage the future
period of transition as the world
reaches its maximum carrying
capacity.
Barney said each agency in
volved in Global 2000 main
tained that their sector of the
economy will confront the prob
lem of diminishing returns and
will need to implement a real
price increase. Those in busi
ness need to be aware of the per
sistence and escalation of infla-

tion implied by this fact. Barney
also said that future busi
nessmen and women should re
alize that many companies are
concerned about the viability of
long-term investments and
loans and that the International
Monetary System is troubled
and fragile, resembling a
"house of cards."
In answering questions from
the audience, Barney qualified
the pessimistic findings of the
Global 2000 report by saying
that he believes there are some
encouraging notes. Explaining
that international interest in the
report's findings is crucial,
Barney said that Global 2000 has
been translated into German
and is currently No. 1 on the
bestseller list in Japan. He ex
pressed his hope that more and
more nations will come to re
alize that development based on
the idea of "making the whole
world look like L.A." will not
work.
He also emphasized the im
portance of making contracep
tives available to all who want
them. Beyond that, he said, in
fant mortality rates must be re
duced because people are more
likely to have lots of children if
they fear that not all of them
will survive.
When asked jokingly at what
point he "called in the priest and
the rabbi," Barney replied, "I
keep talking with the priests and
the rabbis all along. If we do
nothing it means the demise of
the human race." He added,
more optimistically, that he
does not foresee the imminent
end of civilization.

Speaking to a large audience
in the Business School's Bishop
Auditorium Friday, fusion
energy physicist Dr. Gerald
Barney discussed the con
clusions and implications of
Global 2000, a report he helped
to prepare for President Jimmy
Carter. One of the world s lead
ing experts on trends in popu
lation, the environment and re
sources, Barney explained that
the Global 2000 report was de
signed to make projections con
cerning the state of these areas
in the year 2000.
The report, based on research
done by people in 14 different
governmental agencies, was in
tended to facilitate long-range
analysis and future planning.
Those compiling Global 2000 had
much information available to
them, and Barney called the re
port "data rich." He noted,
however, the difficulty of weav
ing together the results of re
search performed by people
from different agencies who had
never met each other.
Barney said that Global 2000
contains several assumptions
which should be kept in mind
when examining the report's
findings. These assumptions are
that present public policies will
continue, that technology will
develop consistently, and that
no major wars or economic dis
ruptions will occur. Barney
noted that this last qualification
does not take into account the
war in Iran.
Acknowledging that certain
aspects of the report are er
roneous or contradictory,
Barney stressed that overall
Global 2000 represents the best
professional work of experts.
According to Global 2000
there is no end in sight to popu
lation growth. By the year 2000
the population will have grown
from today's four billion to 6.35
billion, with growth at that time
40 percent faster than it is to
day. These projections, pre
pared by the Bureau of the
Census, say that 90 percent of
this growth will come from less
developed nations and urban
areas in particular. For exam
ple, Barney told a surprised au
dience, Mexico City in the year
2000 will have 30 million people
in it or three times the popu
lation of New York City today.

continued global expansion.
First the cited soil de
terioration and erosion which
result from increasingly in
tensive agricultural techniques
as well as from the expanded
grazing due to the growth of
nomad tribes. Barney said that
because of soil deterioration
depleted forests cannot be re
plenished, and stressed the im
portance of developing tech
niques to protect and improve
soil.
Second, Barney expressed
concern over the atmospheric
problems caused by increasing
quantities of carbon dioxide and
ozone-depleting chemicals. He
said that unless some changes
are made in the next 20 years,
carbon dioxide will cause a ma
jor climate change by the year
2050.

Barney directed his closing
remarks specifically to the au
dience of future businessmen
and women by detailing what he
feels are the implications of the
Global 2000 report for those in
volved with business. Prefacing
his remarks with the statement
that "business is clearly depen
dent on a lot of resources,"
Barney said that future busi
nessmen and women will need
to learn to manage the future
period of transition as the world
reaches its maximum carrying
capacity.
Barney said each agency in
volved in Global 2000 main
tained that their sector of the
economy will confront the prob
lem of diminishing returns and
will need to implement a real
price increase. Those in busi
ness need to be aware of the per
sistence and escalation of infla-

tion implied by this fact. Barney
also said that future busi
nessmen and women should re
alize that many companies are
concerned about the viability of
long-term investments and
loans and that the International
Monetary System is troubled
and fragile, resembling a
"house of cards."
In answering questions from
the audience, Barney qualified
the pessimistic findings of the
Global 2000 report by saying
that he believes there are some
encouraging notes. Explaining
that international interest in the
report's findings is crucial,
Barney said that Global 2000 has
been translated into German
and is currently No. 1 on the
bestseller list in Japan. He ex
pressed his hope that more and
more nations will come to re
alize that development based on
the idea of "making the whole
world look like L.A." will not
work.
He also emphasized the im
portance of making contracep
tives available to all who want
them. Beyond that, he said, in
fant mortality rates must be re
duced because people are more
likely to have lots of children if
they fear that not all of them
will survive.
When asked jokingly at what
point he "called in the priest and
the rabbi," Barney replied, "I
keep talking with the priests and
the rabbis all along. If we do
nothing it means the demise of
the human race." He added,
more optimistically, that he
does not foresee the imminent
end of civilization.
