# Children's Theatre raises spirits
## 'It really lifts you up' 
### Simran Singh 
A year ago, while doing "Free
to He You and Me" for Man
zanita trailers. Kathryn Kelsey
thought to herself, "Wouldn't it
be great if we could do this for
children?"
And that is how the Stanford
Children's Theater came about.
"Unfortunately not many
people at Stanford know about
us since we perform mainly for
kids and we haven't made pub
licity our big thing," say
Kathryn Kelsey and Dawn
Atkinson.
The two women do everything
from thinking up plays, writing
them, arranging lights, and
flicking through the yellow
pages to see who'd be interested
in watching them
"Basically, the group is just
the two of us," say Kelsey and
Atkinson About fifty other peo
ple have been involved off and
on.
They have done "Free to He
You and Me" and"The Razzle
Dazzle Rainbow Review"
(which was entirely original)
since the group's inception in
January '80. Each play has had
about ten showings.
"As you grow up you don't

have to be a mommy or a house
wife. It's ok to cry if you're a
boy," said Atkinson," 'Free to
He You and Me' fights ster
otypes. Although the kids re
spond mainly to the color and
the music, it's good for them to
hear this along the way."
"The children's favorite
character was Rip the Joker in
Razzle Dazzle' who went
through the show telling knock
knock jokes," said Kelsey.
The two women have an infec
tious energy as they talk about
their theater and about chil
dren "We gear up the play to
suit the age group of children
we're performing for," said
Atkinson
"And we never perform on
stage because we want to in
clude the children," said
Kelsey; "There is so much more
audience response when the
kids are on the floor and we are
on the floor."
She tells of a three year old
who walked right up to their
backdrop during a "Razzle
Dazzle" performance and
started touching the numbers
and asking questions. "A lot of
our acting is improvisation,"
said Atkinson, "The actors re

spond to the audience It real
ly lifts you up," both say en
thusiastically, "It's a real
high "
When they think up a play or
are asked to do one, Atkinson
and Kelsey have to look around
for people to help, act, or do the
music.
"We don't do it for the fame
or the glory," said Atkinson,
'' we have a hard time to get peo
ple to make the commitment, to
see the benefit they'll get out of
it till they actually do it. It is
real therapy for Stanford stu
dents." added Kelsey, "giving
of yourself — being able to
reach out and touch
Reaching out to the communi
ty has been one of their main
goals and the community, they
say, is surprised and very en
thusiastic. "A lady just called
me up this morning to do a show
for the cub scouts," Kelsey tells
Atkinson.
The theater group has per
formed in Palo Alto and Sun
nyvale, in elementary schools
and community libraries, in
three different churches and at
the pediatrics ward at San Fran
cisco hospital.
The group is funded by SCIRE
(Student Center for Innovation
in Research and Education) and
ASSU (Associated Students of
Stanford University). Putting
up a show takes them about a
month of practice and between
$100-$l5O.
"The cast bought their own
costumes and Atkinson's father
made the backdrops," said
Kelsey, explaining how they
managed. Everybody helps ev
erybody in the show, no one is
paid and the performances are
free.
Both have been closely in
volved with children and with
theater. Their next step is into a
sign-mime group, a theater for
deaf children. "Deaf children
are the most theatrical because
their whole life is acting things
out," said Atkinson, "This sign
theater is our main goal."
Sooner, however, is a per
formance of " Androcles and the
Lion" in Spring Quarter. This
time, they say, they are going to
"somehow get Stanford in
volved."

You and Me" and"The Razzle
Dazzle Rainbow Review"
(which was entirely original)
since the group's inception in
January '80. Each play has had
about ten showings.
"As you grow up you don't

have to be a mommy or a house
wife. It's ok to cry if you're a
boy," said Atkinson," 'Free to
He You and Me' fights ster
otypes. Although the kids re
spond mainly to the color and
the music, it's good for them to
hear this along the way."
"The children's favorite
character was Rip the Joker in
Razzle Dazzle' who went
through the show telling knock
knock jokes," said Kelsey.
The two women have an infec
tious energy as they talk about
their theater and about chil
dren "We gear up the play to
suit the age group of children
we're performing for," said
Atkinson
"And we never perform on
stage because we want to in
clude the children," said
Kelsey; "There is so much more
audience response when the
kids are on the floor and we are
on the floor."
She tells of a three year old
who walked right up to their
backdrop during a "Razzle
Dazzle" performance and
started touching the numbers
and asking questions. "A lot of
our acting is improvisation,"
said Atkinson, "The actors re

spond to the audience It real
ly lifts you up," both say en
thusiastically, "It's a real
high "
When they think up a play or
are asked to do one, Atkinson
and Kelsey have to look around
for people to help, act, or do the
music.
"We don't do it for the fame
or the glory," said Atkinson,
'' we have a hard time to get peo
ple to make the commitment, to
see the benefit they'll get out of
it till they actually do it. It is
real therapy for Stanford stu
dents." added Kelsey, "giving
of yourself — being able to
reach out and touch
Reaching out to the communi
ty has been one of their main
goals and the community, they
say, is surprised and very en
thusiastic. "A lady just called
me up this morning to do a show
for the cub scouts," Kelsey tells
Atkinson.
The theater group has per
formed in Palo Alto and Sun
nyvale, in elementary schools
and community libraries, in
three different churches and at
the pediatrics ward at San Fran
cisco hospital.
The group is funded by SCIRE

in Research and Education) and
ASSU (Associated Students of
Stanford University). Putting
up a show takes them about a
month of practice and between
$100-$l5O.
"The cast bought their own
costumes and Atkinson's father
made the backdrops," said
Kelsey, explaining how they
managed. Everybody helps ev
erybody in the show, no one is
paid and the performances are
free.
Both have been closely in
volved with children and with
theater. Their next step is into a
sign-mime group, a theater for
deaf children. "Deaf children
are the most theatrical because
their whole life is acting things
out," said Atkinson, "This sign
theater is our main goal."
Sooner, however, is a per

Lion" in Spring Quarter. This
time, they say, they are going to
"somehow get Stanford in
volved."

A year ago, while doing "Free
to He You and Me" for Man
zanita trailers. Kathryn Kelsey
thought to herself, "Wouldn't it
be great if we could do this for
children?"
And that is how the Stanford
Children's Theater came about.
"Unfortunately not many
people at Stanford know about
us since we perform mainly for
kids and we haven't made pub
licity our big thing," say
Kathryn Kelsey and Dawn
Atkinson.
The two women do everything
from thinking up plays, writing
them, arranging lights, and
flicking through the yellow
pages to see who'd be interested
in watching them
"Basically, the group is just
the two of us," say Kelsey and
Atkinson About fifty other peo
ple have been involved off and
on.
They have done "Free to He
You and Me" and"The Razzle
Dazzle Rainbow Review"
(which was entirely original)
since the group's inception in
January '80. Each play has had
about ten showings.
"As you grow up you don't

have to be a mommy or a house
