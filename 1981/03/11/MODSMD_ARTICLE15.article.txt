# A 						new honor society on campus
## 
### Karen Springen 
The "supply" of good, quali
fied economics majors here has
led to a "demand" for new, in
tense economics activities this
year.

Life as an economics major
can involve more than merely
taking Econ. 1, 51 and 52 — an
honor society and journal now
exist.
Economics honor society
Fraternities are not the only
"Greek" organizationns on
campus. Omicron Delta

Epsilon. an international eco
nomic honor society with about
400 chapters, officially accepted
the University's application for
membership this, year, said jun
ior Bob Bertelson, a member of

the Economic Honor Society or
ganizing committee.
The chapter here still needs to
charter members. Applications
are available at Encina Com
mons, and the deadline is April
17. Both undergraduates and
graduates are eligible for mem
bership but have different re

quirements.
According to sophomore
David Speer, a committee
member, "Our requirements
for undergraduates are much
higher than the national re-

quirements." The nationals set
the GPA needed for entrance at
about a 3.0, he said. But that
standard would result in an in
flated membership.
" It' s noth ing that you' re a uto
matically accepted into." added
Speer.
According to Bertelson,

criteria for undergraduates in
clude a minimum 3.6 GPA in ec
onomics and at least junior sta
tus. Applicants must have com
pleted the economics core and
two courses above the 100 level.
The honor society was
founded at Harvard in 1915.
Princeton and Yale have been
members for about 25 years, ac
cording to Bertelson.
He emphasized three advan
tages to joining Omicron Delta
Epsilon. Reasons include a
"greater opportunity for stu
dents and faculty in economics
to get to know each other," the
recognition of achievement, and
eligibility for national prizes.
The program side will feature

economic sessions and sherry
hours, he added.
Bertelson expects about 150
members.
Journal
Another addition to the eco
nomics program this year is the
Stanford ■Journal of Economics
and Political Science. Senior Is
rael Rodriguez, the editor, said
the publication started this fall
as an economics newsletter.
This evolved into two issues of a
four-page publication, the.Sfrm
ford Economic •Journal.
Further expansion resulted in
a single winter quarter publica
tion. the current issue of Stan
ford •Journal of Economics and
Political Science. The 12-page

newspaper will be published
twice a quarter, said Rodriguez.
The merging of the econom
ics and political science publi
cations also gives the journal
sufficient funds for its increased
size.
In addition to department
money,the journal gets revenue
from advertising. "We had a
mass mailing campaign," said
Rodriguez.
The bi-quarterly newspaper
is designed to publish stories on
diverse topics Essays range
from current events analyses to
academic essays "Nobody else
would publish an intense eco
nomics article," said
Rodriguez.
