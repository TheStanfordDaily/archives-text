# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Historical society: Gertrude Williams Depression years at the University 
### 
Driving to Stanford from
Berkeley in my student days
(perhaps to a spring track
meet), I was conscious of a
gradual change of climate, land
scape. ambience. The air
seemed to take on the som
nolence of the semitropical
compared to the temperate
breezes of Berkeley.
But Stanford was not thinking
of its beneficent environment in
1929 or doting on its tranquility.
It was riding a wave of euphoria
as it found itself participating in
the great affairs of the nation.
The University President's Re
port for 1928-29 reads "The aca
demic year was notable in that
one of the trustees, the Hon
orable Herbert Hoover, was
elected November 6, 1928, and
inaugurated March 4, 1929,
President of the United States."
Soon Ray Lyman Wilbur,
president of the University, took
leave to become Secretary of
the Interior in the Hoover cabi
net.
Stanford history for the next
few years was largely the effort
of the University to cope with
the economic disasters which
assailed society, and for which
Herbert Hoover became the
symbol, probably an ill-de
served fate.
At first these economic
events touched the University
lightly. It is hard to find in the
Daily of the period any mention
of the stock market crash. As
the depression deepened, how
ever, graduating students were
not able to find jobs, and stu
dents who had begun their Uni
versity years with adequate fi
nancing from home found that
their hard-hit families could no
longer support them.
In 1929 two-thirds of the stu
dents enrolled at Stanford were
partially self-supporting, and
this percentage probably in
creased in the ensuing years.
Demand for part-time jobs be
came acute, and the "hasher"
was king — at least he was eat
ing well.
University funds were
pinched to the extreme. Faculty
salaries, already low by eastern
university standards, were cut
10 percent in 1933, but no faculty
members were laid off, and the
year was triumphantly com
pleted with a balance of $2000.
These events pressed the Uni
versity to look to its sources of
income as well as to its ex
penses, and a number of de
cisions were made which were
to affect the future of Stanford.
The "500"' limitation on the
number of women students was

abolished. Urged for academic
and social reasons before this,
the decision, when made, was
defended on unabashedly eco
nomic grounds — "the financial
emergency now faced by the
University."
There was no other pool of
qualified students who wanted
to be admitted. Tuition was
raised from $75 to $100 per quar
ter. and the effort to raise schol
arship funds was increased.
After the development of a re
quired course in Western Civ
ilization and an independent
study pian, the faculty stopped
"tinkering with the lower
division'' to the relief of stu
dents and parents.
But the number of graduate
students continued to increase,
and the University went for
ward with its program of or
ganizing all departments into
schools. Academic disciplines
with common research objec
tives began to merge. One
notable development was the es
tablishment of a "center for a
concentrated atack upon the
mysteries of living pro
toplasm." Professors and grad
uate students from physics,
biology, and chemistry joined in
this research.
It was largely a time of "pa
per and pencil and brain" re
search. There were a few big
sponsored projects, but some
small ones had extensive fruits.
The Varian brothers came to
Stanford as research associates
(without salary) and were given
working space in the Physics
Department basement. There,
they and Bill Hansen developed
the klystron tube which facil
itated radar and revolutionized
microwave research.
Until the "500" became "700"
in 1934, all undergraduate wom
en had lived in Roble Hall and 10
sorority houses. With her regis
tration materials, each woman
student received an Associated
Women Students' Handbook
which carried a foreword by
Dean Yose beginning, "AWS
now enjoy the privilege of self
government."
The Handbook went on to cite
"The Fundamental Standard"
as expressed by Dr. Jordan
("Students are expected to
show, both within and without
the University, such respect for
order, morality, and personal
honor and the rights of others as
is demanded of good citizens").
To make clear what this stan
dard meant in the social sphere,
the Handbook listed women's
regulations relating to hours,
"sign-outs," "late leaves,"

smoking at public events, enter
ing men's residences (forbidden
except with another woman),
dating ("Freshman women
may not motor off campus after
dark unless accompanied by an
other woman"), walking in the
hills (only in parties of at least
four after dark), etc. — a de
tailed set of rules relaxed some
what as the woman progressed
through the University.
Dress codes for the campus
remained conservative through
out the thirties. Sweaters and
skirts, stockings, and (of
course!) shoes were almost a
uniform. Spring quarter
brought out cotton dresses. Only
eccentrics rode bicycles.
Grade averages were pub
lished in those days in the Stan
ford Directory, known as the
"Bawl-Out," and for the most
part grades were taken serious
ly. (Though Stanford was not in
the habit, as was its Berkeley
neighbor, of weeding out a good
fraction of the class of each
freshman year. People went dis
gracefully minus in the Bawl-
Out before they disappeared.)
Social life at Stanford had
traditionally revolved around
living groups and clubs. Visitors
often came to Palo Alto by train
and rode the "Toonerville
Trolley" from Palo Alto to the
campus. Now the automobile
began to change all that.
Swimming, wrestling, box
ing, gymnastics, water polo,
even fly fishing were options in
physical education classes
which were required for two
years.
However, it was the "major
sports" of football, track,
baseball, and basketball that
captured the attention of the
whole campus. After Stanford
had electrified the East by beat
ing Army (their best) 26-0 in
Yankee Stadium, Pop Warner's
double wing system became the
national rage.
In their freshman year they
vowed they would never be
beaten by USC or Cal, and they
never were. "Nowhere in the
annals pf football will you find
anything to equal the exploits of
this small, green, carefree
bunch of Vow Boys," wrote
Dink Templeton, who was
himself coaching great cham
pions of track and field during
those same years.
Some early day traditions
still survived. Everyone said
"hello" on the Quad. There was
no smoking on the Quad or in
classrooms. Students could

leave a pile of books on the win
dow sill and no one would touch
it.
I think of the thirties as a bub
ble of time encapsulating a van
ished way of life that we now re
fer to generally as "pre-war" or
"the years of the great Depres
sion."
Social and technical forces of
the forties began changes which
we cannot yet understand or
assess.
