'Chalk' it up
After reading Philip Chalk's
"cartoon" (Daily, Mar. 3), I had
to write this letter. I've put up
with Chalk's attempts at humor
long enough. I can't remember a
single instance where I have
ever laughed, or even smiled,
after reading one of his car
toons, comics, or whatever they
are. But Chalk 's humor is not at
issue here.
1 could handle the fact that
the whatever was not funny. Af
ter all, that had become the
rule, rather than the exception.
This time, though, Chalk went
too far. In his whatever, he gave
us his vision of the ASSU and its
related organizations; they do

nothing but schedule events that
they later cancel, give concerts
that no one wants to go to, and
relax from all this hard work on
the shores of Lake Lagunita.
It seems to me that the at
titude that Chalk exemplifies is
exactly why the ASSU is having
so many difficulties. The ASSU
is a group of students who care
about what goes on at Stanford
and try to do something to make
it a better place to be. But it's
not an easy job. It is made espe
cially difficult because of peo
ple who look at the failures of
the ASSU and say, "Looks like
they screwed up again, as usu
al." What Chalk doesn't seem to
realize is that they fail primari

ly because of attitudes similar
to his.
The ASSU tries its best to do
things that students want, but
they can't do it alone. They need
student support, not degrada
tion like Chalk's whatever. It's a
thankless job anyway, and it
doesn't have to be made harder
by constant criticism. Sure, it
has its faults, and yes, they do
screw up sometimes, but they
try. What needs to be done is for
students to do something con
structive for the ASSU. What is
not needed is destructive
criticism like Chalk's whatever.
