## Feminists are real women 
### 
I was tempted not to answer Geoffrey Mandel's
commentary on feminism But some ot his re
marks were unfortunate, pointing to the lack of
knowledge he has, or chooses to impart about
feminism and even what it means to him
Individual sisters can speak for themselves. I
can enjoy the empty-headedness of the TV show
"Love Boat," as well as the satirical cartoons of
Nicole Hollander and Bulbul I can flip on the ster
eo to listen to the early sixties wit of Dick
Gregory. But for Mandel to say that feminists
have no sense of humor runs dangerously close to
what detractors of the movement have been in
sisting all along — that feminists do not possess
human characteristics (note his descriptions of
feminists as "grim" and "humorless"), are not
real women — for struggling for what they believe
in.
Mandel maintains that today's young coeds are
catching infectious germs from Gloria Steinhem,
Bella Abzug (are those the only feminists he can
name?) et al., by paying their own way into enter
tainments and insisting on holding their own
doors. Mandel must be living in a time warp. As an
undergrad in the early 70 s, I heard about the
same flack. It's nothing new. Such tidbits, how
ever. are continuously served up by the straight
media for a few giggles. The problem Mandel
should be addressing is the trivializing and belittl
ing of the movement. The image Mandel has prob
ably drunk in hook, line and sinker, is that the
feminist community is composed mainly of white,
middle-class, straight females indulging in
sloganeering and bra-burning: They are seen as a
threat to the nuclear family or single-minded in
their "pet" cause. In my experience, men do the
most laughing, or lashing at the feminist move
ment because it is threatening the bad, old, use
less ways men and women have dealt with one an
other.
Mandel commits another faux-pas when he
tends to put feminists together in one pot. What he
does not say (or seem to know) is that there are
several theoretical groups feminists belong or
adhere to. There are radical feminists, lesbian
separatists, NOW feminists, socialist feminists
of every color and ilk. There are "shades" of be
lief from black to gray to white, arguments right
and left on the so-called correct line of feminism.
Mandel cruises around his argument about
gender and spends a lot of inches nitpicking and
grousing about nonsexist language. Gender
creates a lot of either/or problems for women and
men. If a woman is capable of doing nontradi
tional work like working on the BART rail line,
she. is in for it. Any woman working outside the
"normal" expectations and occupations set aside
for women is labeled dyke, unfeminine, and is sub
ject to possible harassment during her workday.
Then we have the story of the men who want to
wear womens' skirts and who are far from being
outright transvestites. They wanted to be cool,
comfortable and accepted, not put down for being
freaks. People should be capable of making
choices that are good for them, not just for society
at large, in these cases.
What Mandel does not admit is that the idea of
nonsexist language is to create a basis for nonsex

ist thought The English language wasn't put
together in one quantum leap. It is still going
through gestation periods. Mandel should sample
some of the doubletalk used in psychology and in
engineering. It took a lot of negotiating between
the Saxons and the Normans and other groups to
make English what it is today. It is hoped that
similar accomodation and understanding between
men and women will clear up muddled
phraseology.
Finally, as black feminist/poet, I take particu
lar exception to Mandel's remark: "Should we
focus on writers of less talent and experience sim
ply because they are women? This kind of literary
affirmative action would be little more than
tokenism ..." Tokenism already exists in literary
academia. There are "lesser" and "greater"
writers, and time and time again, I have seen the
greater writers as white males. With Marianne
Moore perhaps in tow, the woman who spoke up in
her class about Wallace Stevens' misogyny hit the
nail on the head.
There is no separation in what one writes and
what his/her personal politics are. Let's take for
example, Ezra Pound. He is most famous for his
fascist sympathies. He adhered to the literary pol
itics and elitism still prevalent: that poetry and
criticism was the prime preserve of the educated
upper class intelligentsia (read "white"), and
that they and only they could understand it. While
Pound's portfolio is vast, it is still ponderous to
decipher without footnotes, Greek, or whatever it
takes. It is not accessible to the understanding of
common people. While Pound was in prison after
World War 11, he won the Bollingen Prize. I don't
doubt that the judges felt he was talented, or that
he was unjustly jailed for being a collaborator,
but the kind of cultural elitism all of them
espoused could also be considered in Pound's
achievement.
English students are constantly taught the
works of such writers as Pound and Stevens. They
are presented as the only writers worth reading
and studying. And what does that say for the
readers? Life only imitates art and vice versa.
I can say, "not all women writers and Third
World writers are good," because there are only
those women and Third World writers I can ap
preciate, like June Jordan, Louis Chu, Raymond
Barrio, and Toni Morrison. But why does it take
ten years for Judy Grahn, a white lesbian feminist
poet to publish "A Woman Is Talking To Death" in
the American Poetry Review and win their annual
award? Why is it that Third World literature is
downgraded and accused of being "Whit
manesque" for telling it like it is (Pablo Neruda is
such an example)? Why would Mandel im
mediately jump the gun and assume and take for
granted that he would only be studying women
writers who are bad? Cultural elitism.
Geoffrey Mandel shouldn't spend his time
"watching." He should be out doing something to
prepare himself for the wide world — that in
cludes women and Third World people.
