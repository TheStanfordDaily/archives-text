# Clerical fights for promotion

Rita Mazon is fighting the Univer
sity's decision not to grant her retro
active pay for the job she could have
been performing in the Development
Office since 1978. The nine-year Stan
ford employee claims she has been un
derclassified since that time.
Job classification is a common
source of dissatisfaction among
clerical and office workers here, but
few employees file grievances to have
reclassification decisions reviewed.
With the elections for the
unionization of clerical workers just
two months away, the unions seem
eager to take Mazon's case to the limit
to highlight underclassification and to
prove that the grievance procedure
does not work.
University officials acknowledge
that there is a "fair amount of traffic"
in reclassification requests and say
that the grievance procedure is a good
one.
Betsy Murray, spokesperson for
United Stanford Employees (USE),
said many University clerical work
ers are "improperly and under
classified," and said she feels the
Mazon case shows "why clerical
workers need a contract with a strong
grievance procedure, with an arbi

trator from outside the University."
Mazon continues to fight for back
pay "because I know what I am asking
for is only right."
Feeling that the outcome of her
grievance was unfair, Mazon re
quested that Director of Personnel
Robert Parker review the decision, a
review which began yesterday.
From the day she was hired in 1972,
the University classified Mazon as an
Office Assistant 11-Specialist in gift
processing.
(On the University's classification
scale, which denotes pay range and
skills, a 11-Specialist, or 11-S, is half
way between a II and a 111. In the over
all hierarchy, an Office Assistant II is
equivalent to an Accounting Assistant
I and an Office Assistant 111 is equal to
an Accounting Assistant II and so on.
The complexity of the system is one of
the points of contention for the em
ployees. )
Mazon asked to have her classi
fication reviewed in 1974, 1976, and
again in 1978.
According to a letter from Kay Met
teauer, Mazon's supervisor at the
time, to John Hays, the grievance
hearing officer,"the last request was
shelved " by the Development Office;
it never "got to compensation."

When this final reclassification re
quest was rejected, Mazon accepted
an internal lateral transfer, under the
impression that she would have a bet
ter chance of advancement working as
an Accounting Assistant I in the same
office.
Mazon claims that ivietteauer, and
Gloria Smith, the personnel repre
sentative for the Development office,
both led her to believe that her Office
Assistant job would never be reclass
ified. Mazon contends that both wom
en also told her that the Accounting
Assistant job would be upgraded soon,
but Smith denies having ever en
couraged Mazon in this belief.
Smith said she was never aware
that a "request (for reclassification)
was forthcoming" but Metteauer said
that although "nothing official" had
been done, through conversations
Smith "knew that it was one of the
high priorities in the office."
Ultimately, in July 1980, Shelley
Shaw, the new supervisor in Gift Proc
essing, requested that Mazon s former
job be upgraded to Office Assistant
111, a request the University granted.
Mazon at that point was "angry and
shocked because that's what she had
been trying to do all those years,'' said
