## Women's movement not a laughing matter 
### 
Not very funny, Geoffrey
Mandel. Your column (Daily,
Mar. 2) featured fuzzy claims
and little humor, in an attempt
to ridicule feminism for its lack
of laughs. The conclusion
seemed to be that if women used
giggles as a weapon, the exist
ing establishment would be
weakened (from laughing too
hard?) and feminists could rally
to a triumphant conclusion. But
who were the shots to be
directed at? Themselves?
Wouldn't that be turning the
guns in the wrong direction and
committing mass suicide?
I am not against humor or
laughter. I poke more fun at my
self than most people I have met
at Stanford dare to. I am a wom
an, girl, femme fatale and
feminist, and I certainly enjoy
things that are truly funny. But
most things aren't. Many jokes
are strained attempts to grab
attention at the price of cutting
down someone else. Most
feminist jokes that I have not
enjoyed have been told by men
with little sensitivity and with

even less sense of humor.
Mandel falls in his own pitfalls
throughout his column; the first
one is that his sense of humor
leaves something to be desired.
Postbeing, my ass.
Mandel ignores the fact that
many feminists have taken the
criticism of lacking humor to
heart. He even mentioned some
of the movies that have re
sulted. Claire Bretecher's car
toons are dangerously funny,
and Pulling Our Own Strings
brims over with piercing and
daring humor. More so than in
most Daily columns I have read
over the years. You have per
haps not heard my favorite
feminist joke?
"A famous feminist was
speaking in front of a large
crowd, when a man in the au
dience leapt up and hollered:
'Are you a lesbian?,'thus hoping
to discredit the speaker. The
feminist measured the ruddy
gentleman and answered: "Are
you the alternative?'"
Mandel s most blatant mis
take is to claim that all

feminists see the world as black
and white, with no shades of
gray. Where are his shades of
gray? Not in his column. All
feminists do not fit neatly into a
humorless box.
I have borrowed my defini
tion from Henrik Ibsen, who
claims that the issue of
feminism is rather one of hu
manism. And all humanists are
as different as all feminists. The
question revolves around ev
eryone's right to define their
goals as a person, without the
limitations of gender. It is cer
tainly as much the right of. any
one to open doors for others, or
pay for their dates, but it should
also work the other way around
for those who wish that. There is
no one standard that we all
should have to conform to in re
lations between men and wom
en.
It is all very scary, because
things are not clearly defined,
and it is up to us to carve out our
own definitions. I grew up in
Norway where men very
seldom open doors for women,
or pay for dates. I therefore had
to learn the hard way, once I
travelled abroad, that men ex
pect something in return if they
invite you out and foot the bill.
And the price was too high for
me to pay, so I did a lot of walk
ing home alone on dark, empty
streets. I don't like to feel used,
I don't like to owe, and I want to
meet men on equal footing.
My home country recently
adopted one of the first equal
rights laws in the world. Nor
way also now has the third
female prime minister in Eu
rope. There may not be a direct
link, but one of the objects of the
law was to make people more
aware of their social reality. It
outlawed all sex-specific job
titles, and replaced them with
sex-neutral ones. This caused
some opposition, but generally
has not done much damage —
rather the opposite. It has
opened a lot of people's eyes to
injustices they earlier took for
granted, and change is on the
way. Using both "he and she''
also makes the speaker or writ
er more aware.
Language reflects reality,
and it is indeed a daring venture
to attempt a reversal of the
process. But language is also
very fluid, and calling someone
a mailman today does not mean
we must adhere to that forever.
Much of the controversy may
stem from the abruptness of
change, but our patience is run
ning out.
Most person-endings sound ri
diculous. but there are many

other viable alternatives, like
mailcarrier.
The Equal Rights Com
missioner in Norway, Eva
Kolstad, is now called an Om
bud — perhaps Stanford could
follow the example of the coun
try that coined the term?
Kolstad, by the way, has been
major driving force in de
chauvinising men in Norway.
With careful and detailed ex
planations, she has made even
the most diehard of the bunch
understand why someone carry
ing the mail should not be called
a mailman.
There was also the question of
literary works and movies to
consider. In my view, both
female writers and chauvinist
writers are equally important in
our education. However, the
women should be doubly hon
ored for their efforts, which
have cost them a much greater
struggle. Try to write a book
with five screaming children
and a pile of laundry at your
side. The male writers who hate
women should be read in that
light; criticized for their short
comings and praised for their
genius.
As to movies, we border on a
broader topic: the whole idea of
a revolution. The leaders of so
cial change are always the most
radical part of any movement,
as the rest of the grey masses
dillidally along at a slower and
more conservative pace. Those
we can reach through baby food
movies are part of the grey
mass, who will never under
stand the political rhetoric or
care much for it. But the cause
becomes understandable and
valid in the predigested movies,
and they seldom expose them
selves to other kinds. No longer
is feminism a theoretical bunch
of baloney that has no implica
tions for their own life.
All that feminism, in core,
wants to do is to break down to
day's stereotypes and widen the
spectrum so that we no longer
feel confined by the boxes we
have been placed in for cen
turies. By putting feminists into
one box (read: hairy legs and
sagging boobs), housewives into
another (read: shiny floors and
pregnant), whores into a third
(read: sexually promiscuous
and make-up), etc., we limit our
development. Liberation com
plicates our lives in a world that
is already growing more dif
ficult to deal with by the day —
but it is actually very comical.
