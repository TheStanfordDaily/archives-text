## Nation needs all energy forms 
### 
Governor Jerry Brown re
cently addressed a private
gathering of educators and sci
entists. He pointed out a most
horrible problem — today
almost a billion people are
starving I do not doubt his good
intentions, but, unfortunately,
good intentions are not the same
as good results.
Oil — easily transported, eas
ily distributed, the fuel of most
simple equipment — is particu
larly essential to Third World
development Simple survival
in these nations depends on
energy. The crops of the Green
Revolution increase harvest
yields phenomenally, but they
will not grow without a great
deal of irrigation and nitrogen
based fertilizer, both of which
require energy. Competition
among wealthy nations has
driven oil prices up and main
tains them there. The energy
shortage has produced an in
creasing economic malaise in
developed nations, but suffering
in Third World nations threat
ens life itself.
Political realities increase
the risks of oil dependence. The
oil supply from the Persian Gulf
region, which used to be the
source of 45 percent of the free
world's oil, is vulnerable. Not
only has the area been sur
rounded by Soviet forces, but
also a war between Iran and
Iraq has already curtailed oil
production. Decreased oil con
sumption in the developed na
tions would serve many vital
purposes.
The election of President
Ronald Reagan has improved
the energy picture. In one of his
first actions, he deregulated oil
prices. We never could regulate
OPEC prices. Domestic price
regulation has managed to keep
national consumption of oil un
realistically high and domestic
production low. Deregulation
will bring a nationwide de
crease in oil consumption,
greater efficiency in oil use and
strong incentives for increased
domestic oil production. How
ever, a substantial change in oil
supply is apt to be at least five
years in the future if the oilfield
is on land —10 years away if it is
located offshore.
One may hope the new gov
ernment will make other con
structive changes. Under
former President Jimmy
Carter, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission was reduced to

four members. Two were rea
sonably expert; two were ig
norant political appointees The
resulting deadlock suggests that
two plus two sometimes equals
zero. New starts in reactor con
struction have reached the van
ishing point. Under the current
unstable and complicated regu
lations, construction comple
tion takes 12 to 15 years. The de
lays, while adding nothing to re
actor safety, add a great deal to
consumer electricity costs.
Even under the best circum
stances, it will take five or six
years to build a reactor. There
is no quick, extensive relief for
the energy problem.
A further circumstance com
plicates the hopeful national
scene. The present adminis
tration is apt to respect state
rights. It is not apt to force a
program on any state adminis
tration. Therefore, national
progress in securing energy is
apt to be uneven, and the outlook
for some states is particularly
bleak.
The California Energy Com
mission is composed solely of
opponents to nuclear energy.
The present governor makes no
pretense of impartiality on this
issue. Consequently, almost 60
percent of the electricity used in
the state is generated from oil
and natural gas. California con
sumes more oil than any other
state in the nation. One result of
this policy is that Californians
pay electric rates 30 percent
higher than the national aver
age. This result, while painful,
is a lesser evil. If the Persian
Gulf oil is lost, the whole free
world will suffer, but within the
nation, California will be the
hardest hit.
California's behavior is con
trary to the national interest.
Some of its laws regarding nu
clear energy may even be con
trary to federal law. Brown has
encouraged the delay of nuclear
plants through legislative and
legal proceses. Yet the world,
the nation, and each state needs
all the forms of energy avail
able. About 30 percent of Cali
fornia's electricity comes from
hydropower, but only 20 percent
is generated in California. Some
hydropower is imported from
the Columbia River, which
serves Oregon and Washington.
These states are growing at the
rate of 10 percent a year, so even
without a drought (a real possi
bility), there will be less energy

available from this source in the
future
The governor is right. The
main problem in the world to
day is that there are almost a
billion people starving How
ever, the governor is less well
informed on technical matters
and not very consistent, a prop
erty he shares with his advisers
and the State Energy Com
mission. They have institu
tionalized the overuse of oil in
California, thereby ensuring air
pollution in the state, and there
by ensuring a continuance of an
even worse pollution — pollu
tion by poverty — in developing
nations. The road to the least de
sirable place of all is paved with
good intentions. It seems that
the better the pavement the
higher the speed Let us hope
that Brown will abandon his
course before it is too late.

good intentions are not the same
as good results.
Oil — easily transported, eas
ily distributed, the fuel of most
simple equipment — is particu
larly essential to Third World
development Simple survival
in these nations depends on
energy. The crops of the Green
Revolution increase harvest
yields phenomenally, but they
will not grow without a great
deal of irrigation and nitrogen
based fertilizer, both of which
require energy. Competition
among wealthy nations has
driven oil prices up and main
tains them there. The energy
shortage has produced an in
creasing economic malaise in
developed nations, but suffering
in Third World nations threat
ens life itself.
Political realities increase
the risks of oil dependence. The
oil supply from the Persian Gulf
region, which used to be the
source of 45 percent of the free
world's oil, is vulnerable. Not
only has the area been sur
rounded by Soviet forces, but
also a war between Iran and
Iraq has already curtailed oil
production. Decreased oil con
sumption in the developed na
tions would serve many vital
purposes.
The election of President
Ronald Reagan has improved
the energy picture. In one of his
first actions, he deregulated oil
prices. We never could regulate
OPEC prices. Domestic price
regulation has managed to keep
national consumption of oil un
realistically high and domestic
production low. Deregulation
will bring a nationwide de
crease in oil consumption,
greater efficiency in oil use and
strong incentives for increased
domestic oil production. How
ever, a substantial change in oil
supply is apt to be at least five
years in the future if the oilfield
is on land —10 years away if it is
located offshore.
One may hope the new gov
ernment will make other con
structive changes. Under
former President Jimmy
Carter, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission was reduced to

four members. Two were rea
sonably expert; two were ig
norant political appointees The
resulting deadlock suggests that
two plus two sometimes equals
zero. New starts in reactor con
struction have reached the van
ishing point. Under the current
unstable and complicated regu
lations, construction comple
tion takes 12 to 15 years. The de
lays, while adding nothing to re
actor safety, add a great deal to
consumer electricity costs.
Even under the best circum
stances, it will take five or six
years to build a reactor. There
is no quick, extensive relief for
the energy problem.
A further circumstance com
plicates the hopeful national
scene. The present adminis
tration is apt to respect state
rights. It is not apt to force a
program on any state adminis
tration. Therefore, national
progress in securing energy is
apt to be uneven, and the outlook
for some states is particularly
bleak.
The California Energy Com
mission is composed solely of
opponents to nuclear energy.
The present governor makes no
pretense of impartiality on this
issue. Consequently, almost 60
percent of the electricity used in
the state is generated from oil
and natural gas. California con
sumes more oil than any other
state in the nation. One result of
this policy is that Californians
pay electric rates 30 percent
higher than the national aver
age. This result, while painful,
is a lesser evil. If the Persian
Gulf oil is lost, the whole free
world will suffer, but within the
nation, California will be the
hardest hit.
California's behavior is con
trary to the national interest.
Some of its laws regarding nu
clear energy may even be con
trary to federal law. Brown has
encouraged the delay of nuclear
plants through legislative and
legal proceses. Yet the world,
the nation, and each state needs
all the forms of energy avail
able. About 30 percent of Cali
fornia's electricity comes from
hydropower, but only 20 percent
is generated in California. Some
hydropower is imported from
the Columbia River, which
serves Oregon and Washington.
These states are growing at the
rate of 10 percent a year, so even
without a drought (a real possi
bility), there will be less energy

available from this source in the
future
The governor is right. The
main problem in the world to
day is that there are almost a
billion people starving How
ever, the governor is less well
informed on technical matters
and not very consistent, a prop
erty he shares with his advisers
and the State Energy Com
mission. They have institu
tionalized the overuse of oil in
California, thereby ensuring air
pollution in the state, and there
by ensuring a continuance of an
even worse pollution — pollu
tion by poverty — in developing
nations. The road to the least de
sirable place of all is paved with
good intentions. It seems that
the better the pavement the
higher the speed Let us hope
that Brown will abandon his
course before it is too late.
