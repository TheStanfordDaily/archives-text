## Journalistic style of speculation, guessing 
### 
We in the newspaper busi
ness, as in any profession, try to
keep up on the latest innova
tions. Since my arrival at Stan
ford, a completely new idea in
journalism has astounded me so
thoroughly that it has
galvanized me into fits of jour
nalistic passion.
As regular followers of The
San Francisco Chronicle will
know, there appears regularly
the column entitled "The Ques
tion Mart." I have been follow
ing the Question Man ever since
I discovered the true quality of
the rest of the Chronicle. I fol
lowed him through the emo
tional victory of "Is anyone in
your neighborhood having an af
fair?" to the crashing defeat of
"How do you peel avocados?"
But, Question Man is a
maverick. Those who under
stand his unique position expect
sporadic failures along with
successes, as he treads upon
new ground. After all, he is the
first man to turn journalism on
its head. Journalism is the art of
relating fact and usually fact
that no one wants to hear, in a
way that makes people want to
hear it.
For instance, you are still
reading this column, aren't

you? And I haven't even gotten
to the point yet. Question Man
has invaded this genre based on
fact, and turned it around. His is
the journalism of speculation, of
pure unbridled guessing.
He has made journalism an
art in which all may participate.
From the one-way street of the
usual newspaper rubbish, Ques
tion Man has wrought an
elaborate scheme which ori
ginates and ends with the man
in-the-street. Through random
encounters, he collects the re
sponses of the man-in-the-street
to the question of the day. Each
day brings queries anew, and
the defenseless man-in-the
street faces such interrogation
as "Would you ever wear polka
dot underwear?" or "What
would be your favorite food if
you were Superman?"
As a student of journalistic
creativity, I have long waited
for the day when I could meet
Question Man and question him
for myself. What appears below
is the transcription of my in
terview with the Question Man.
M: First of all let me wel
come you to Stanford.
QM: How long have you been
here?
M: About 10 minutes.

QM: What about Stanford,
how long have vou been at Stan
ford?
M: About two years.
QM: And how do you like it?
M. It is a terrific place, but
shouldn't we . . .
QM: Is there anyone in your
dorm having an affair?
M: Wait a second, this is my
interview, and I live off-campus
besides.
QM: Maybe one of your
housemates is having an affair,
or better yet, how do they peel
avocados?
M: Look, this is my in
terview.
QM: Would you like to be the
Question Man?
M: Yes, if only for the rest of
this column. First, I would like
to ask if you screen your re
sponses. or do you simply take
the first four or five?
QM: What do you think?
M: Well, I don't really know.
QM: Would you like for me to
screen them?
M: I don't know. Why don't
we move on?
QM: Why do you ask that?
M: That was not a question.
QM: Are you sure? Doesn't it
have a question mark?
M: Yes, but that doesn't

count.
QM: Why not?
M; Be quiet, I'm doing the
questioning here.
QM; Oh, really?
M; Do you ever make a
statement?
QM: Why should I 0
M; Why didn't I think of that?
QM: Don't ask me.

M; Why didn't I think of that?
QM: Don't ask me.

We in the newspaper busi
ness, as in any profession, try to
keep up on the latest innova
tions. Since my arrival at Stan
ford, a completely new idea in
journalism has astounded me so
thoroughly that it has
galvanized me into fits of jour
nalistic passion.
As regular followers of The
San Francisco Chronicle will
know, there appears regularly
the column entitled "The Ques
tion Mart." I have been follow
ing the Question Man ever since
I discovered the true quality of
the rest of the Chronicle. I fol
lowed him through the emo
tional victory of "Is anyone in
your neighborhood having an af
fair?" to the crashing defeat of
"How do you peel avocados?"
But, Question Man is a
maverick. Those who under
stand his unique position expect
sporadic failures along with
successes, as he treads upon
new ground. After all, he is the
first man to turn journalism on
its head. Journalism is the art of
relating fact and usually fact
that no one wants to hear, in a
way that makes people want to
hear it.
For instance, you are still
reading this column, aren't

you? And I haven't even gotten
to the point yet. Question Man
has invaded this genre based on
fact, and turned it around. His is
the journalism of speculation, of
pure unbridled guessing.
He has made journalism an
art in which all may participate.
From the one-way street of the
usual newspaper rubbish, Ques
tion Man has wrought an
elaborate scheme which ori
ginates and ends with the man
in-the-street. Through random
encounters, he collects the re
sponses of the man-in-the-street
to the question of the day. Each
day brings queries anew, and
the defenseless man-in-the
street faces such interrogation
as "Would you ever wear polka
dot underwear?" or "What
would be your favorite food if
you were Superman?"
As a student of journalistic
creativity, I have long waited
for the day when I could meet
Question Man and question him
for myself. What appears below
is the transcription of my in
terview with the Question Man.
M: First of all let me wel
come you to Stanford.
QM: How long have you been
here?
M: About 10 minutes.

QM: What about Stanford,
how long have vou been at Stan
ford?
M: About two years.
QM: And how do you like it?
M. It is a terrific place, but
shouldn't we . . .
QM: Is there anyone in your
dorm having an affair?
M: Wait a second, this is my
interview, and I live off-campus
besides.
QM: Maybe one of your
housemates is having an affair,
or better yet, how do they peel
avocados?
M: Look, this is my in
terview.
QM: Would you like to be the
Question Man?
M: Yes, if only for the rest of
this column. First, I would like
to ask if you screen your re
sponses. or do you simply take
the first four or five?
QM: What do you think?
M: Well, I don't really know.
QM: Would you like for me to
screen them?
M: I don't know. Why don't
we move on?
QM: Why do you ask that?
M: That was not a question.
QM: Are you sure? Doesn't it
have a question mark?
M: Yes, but that doesn't

count.
QM: Why not?
M; Be quiet, I'm doing the
questioning here.
QM; Oh, really?
M; Do you ever make a
statement?
QM: Why should I 0
M; Why didn't I think of that?
QM: Don't ask me.
