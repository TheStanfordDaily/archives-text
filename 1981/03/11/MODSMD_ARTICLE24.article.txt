## Survival possible without absolutes? 
### 
At first, I did not know what to
make of Jerry Russell's col
umn, "Medieval minority hold
court" (Daily, Mar. 3), because
I saw in it a veritable
hodgepodge of historical al
lusions (illusions?),
philosophical assertions, and
political accusations. Beyond
the most blatant anti-Christian
rhetoric I have vet seen in the
Daily lies a subtle philosophical
and religious assumption which
needs to be addressed: auton
omous human reason's ability to
arrive at "the truth."
Although Russell claims to
follow in the tradition of the
Renaissance, the En
lightenment, and the Darwinian
"revolution" (not without his
torical precedents of its own,
dating back to the pre-
Socratics), in actuality he is
merely carrying the ball handed
to him by that most eminent Me
dieval theologian, St. Thomas
Aquinas. Although Aquinas
firmly believed in the authority
of Scripture, he was the first to
argue cogently on behalf of au
tonomous human reason since
the Greeks.

Aquinas divided the world
and all knowledge in a Platonic
fashion between "Nature" and
"Grace." Scripture was the au
thoritative source for truth
about the sphere of Grace, but
human reason, being untainted
by the fall of Adam, could func
tion freely and efficiently within
the realm of Nature. This was
the first step in modern history
away from the faith which Rus
sell so loudly deplores.
The Italian Renaissance did
much to enlarge the value and
importance of human reason
Elevating the ancient pagans to
a level equal and sometimes su
perior to the Scriptures, the
Italians resurrected the phrase
"Man: the measure of all
things." Such authors as Pico
asserted that man had the ca
pacity to achieve god-like sta
tus. The realm of nature was
dubbed the sphere of reason and
the realm of Grace was called
the sphere of faith. A sharp
dichotomy developed between
the two. but the Renaissance
men did not give up their faith.
Rather, many remained devout
Christians.

The Reformation, which Rus
sell ignores, represented a
broadly based retorm of the me
dieval church. Although it
would be somewhat
anachronistic to refer to the
Protestants as evangelicals,
they most certainly fit that defi
nition used by Russell and mos
others. Yet it is here, in the trad
ition of the Reformation evan
gelicals, where the seeds of such
concepts as "separation of
church and state" are to be
found. Far from being an "in
comprehensible abstraction,"
separation of church and state
grew out of the teaching of these
reformers; that the Church was
a universal body of believers
and not a hierarchical and tem
poral structure.
Russell would have us believe
that the evangelicals are visible
signs of "the aristocratic hier
archies of church and state."
However, the evangelicals in
modern America, as well as
their historical ancestors, rep
resent a populist, lower-class
movement. Furthermore, it is
the Protestant teaching of the
"universal priesthood of a\l be
lievers" which did the most to
undermine the medieval
"aristocratic hierarchies of
church and state" and which
laid the foundation of the demo
cratic idea
One should think twice before
enlisting the Enlightenment in
one's "liberal" and "mod
ernist" cause. It was the French
enlightenment which spawned
the "benevolent dictatorships"
of Prussia and the anarchy of
the French Revolution. It was
not separation of church and
state which was born of the En
lightenment; instead it was the
attempted eradication of Chris
tianity and its replacement by
the cult of Reason. The chaos

which followed the overthrow of
the ancien regime only led to
terror and tyranny, first of Rob
espierre and ultimately of
Napoleon.
Logic as well as history cries
out that Russell and like-minded
humanists are wrong â€” even, I
dare say, that Christianity is
right. Autonomous human rea
son is inadequate for de
termining and assessing truth
for a number of reasons.
First, apart from claims to
the contrary, all knowledge is
based on faith, that is, upon pre
suppositions A presupposition
is something you assume, not
prove, something you believe.
For example, the highly touted
scientific method takes a
number of highly debated
philosophical positions as its
starting points: empiricism,
which teaches that all knowl
edge is to be ascertained
through the experience of the
senses; materialism, which be
lieves that all reality can be un
derstood in terms of material
substance, natural law. and
strict cause-effect rela
tionships; and naturalism,
which holds that the universe is
a closed system prohibiting the
supernatural and thus that mir
acles are impossible. No matter
how self-evident these positions
appear to be, they are accepted
by faith, not proven. What is de
bated in the Philosophy Depart
ment is commonly assumed in
the marketplace.
Second, it is impossible to be
neutral in determining truth.
Everyone is biased. The ob
server of a given datum cannot
separate himself from his ob
servation. He sees with his eyes
no matter how good or poor they
may be. The person's worldview
determines both his in
vestigative procedure (what ob
servations he chooses to make)

Amd his interpretive principle
(how he evaluates the observa
tions he has made).
Third, revelation is actually
necessary to arrive at truth. The
best way to explain this is by il
lustration: if you want to find
out what water is, do not ask a
fish. For any certainty or mean
ing in human life one must look
beyond humanity. To arrive at
truth one must receive it from
outside the space-time-matter
continuum; otherwise, one is
only continually assuming what
is to be proved.
The most horrendous
atrocities against mankind in
the 20th Century have been com
mitted by anti-Christian groups
who were merely living out the
inevitable conclusions of human
reason. If a blatant evolu
tionary, atheistic viewpoint is
correct, so were the Nazis. If
man is an animal, if man is
merely the product of chance
material causes over time, man
has no dignity at all. It is per
fectly logical to exterminate
men who are deemed unfit or
harmful to the advancement of
the race or species if one has
this sort of woridview. It is per
fectly reasonable to proclaim,
as the communists do. that the
only morality is the good of the
State, since apart from revel
ation. what other basis for mo
rality can there be 9
Man apart from revelation
has no moral anchor to restrain
his behavior He is faced with an
existential "to run the woman
down or not to run the woman
down" dilemma. Either choice
is equally valid. The real issue is'
whether we can continue to sur
vive as a nation without
absolutes.
