In response to Lisa Bernard's
"enlightening'' instructions on
"Becoming a Princess" (Daily,
Mar. 6): Does it really matter
that many Stanford students
lack a concise notion of what the
existence of a WASP or JAP
princess entails? Bernard's hu
mor-tinged account of the frolic
and fun, as well as the trials and
tribulations of the Princess In-
Training accentuates my frus
tration with the desire of partic
ular individuals at this Univer
sity to neatly divide, sort, and
package anyone they encounter.

As a freshman, I have found
myself repeatedly portrayed as
"clueless." Allow me to step
briefly beyond the realm of my
supposedly "wide-eyed"
naivete in scorning such ir
responsible pronouncements. It
does not require a highlighter or
a four-color pen to note the ex
pression of personal biases.
Bernard criticizes an image of
people who narrowly tailor their
experiences to keep up with cur
rent trends. Even if her
statements are introspective,
her point could have been more
effective without the use of ster
eotypical examples or at the ex
pense of specific racial groups
and geographical regions.
Satire may be entertaining,
but it warrants far more judi
cious application than recently
found in the Daily. I am con
cerned at the lack of hesitancy
or consideration behind the em
ployment of blanket general
izations. Viewing all fraternity
brothers as clones or all Camaro
driving Vuarnet wearers as
narcissistic blatantly overlooks
the redeeming qualities of the
individual. No one fits an exact
mold or cruises through life
completely unscathed Amaz
ingly few swim surely in the
vari-colored sea of La Coste al
ligators. A stereotypical image
that strikes one as amusing be
comes dehumanizing as it pro
ceeds to strip away the individ
ual's uniqueness.
Next time you recognize me
toting my tome of Organic
Chemistry notes and flashcards
to class in a gym bag. because
my overstuffed knapsack's zip
per broke, don't consign me to
the ranks of faceless pre-meds.
Don't condemn me as too prep,
too punk, or too anything in par
ticular if you chance to see me
indulgently splashing through

puddles tomorrow morning in
shocking green L.L. Bean rain
galoshes. We fit the spaces we
define for ourselves. Let's not
severely limit that area by
choosing a narrow path that pro
pels us "through the intersec
tion" without more than a fleet
ing glance in the side-view mir
rors to check the blindspot.

Course evaluations
As Stanford students, we have
the opportunity and responsi
bility to assess a course,
critique the teaching of it and
recommend means by which
both the course and the teaching
could be improved.
The current process of Uni
versity-sponsored course eval
uation is the outgrowth of a 1977
Faculty Senate resolution —
passed unanimously — embrac
ing "the principle of universal
course evaluation by students."
The validity and utility of such
assessments, as a teaching aid
and as a factor in tenure de
cisions, was the topic of vigor
ous discussion before the even
tual Senate support of eval
uation by students. Dissemina
tion of the findings via the
A SSI! Course (iuide finds its
roots in the 1969 Study of Educa
tion at Stanford, which recom
mended that . an agency of
the student body should devise,
produce, and widely distribute a
systematic evaluation of
courses and instructors includ
ing valid empirical measures of
student judgements. .
This system is currently un
dergoing a planned scrutiny by
the Senate Subcommittee on
Evaluation and Improvement of

Teaching. As this group per
forms its review, we would en
courage both students and facul
ty to consider their obligations
and participation in this impor
tant procedure.
To faculty members, we urge
you to allot time in one of the
final class meetings for stu
dents to fill out the University
form — a few moments given in
class are a valuable encourage
ment to constructive comments
in those hectic days of Dead
Week We further ask that you
designate a student to return the
completed evaluations to the
Registrar and that you release
the results to the Course (luide.
To students, we ask you to fill
out the evaluation forms with
care and thought Good teaching
skills and practices deserve rec
ognition and suggestions for im
provement; poor teaching de
mands suggestions for improve
ment. both specific and general.
Take the few extra moments —
it will increase the value of this
evaluation for our faculty and to
us.

As a freshman, I have found
myself repeatedly portrayed as
"clueless." Allow me to step
briefly beyond the realm of my
supposedly "wide-eyed"
naivete in scorning such ir
responsible pronouncements. It
does not require a highlighter or
a four-color pen to note the ex
pression of personal biases.
Bernard criticizes an image of
people who narrowly tailor their
experiences to keep up with cur
rent trends. Even if her
statements are introspective,
her point could have been more
effective without the use of ster
eotypical examples or at the ex
pense of specific racial groups
and geographical regions.
Satire may be entertaining,
but it warrants far more judi
cious application than recently
found in the Daily. I am con
cerned at the lack of hesitancy
or consideration behind the em
ployment of blanket general
izations. Viewing all fraternity
brothers as clones or all Camaro
driving Vuarnet wearers as
narcissistic blatantly overlooks
the redeeming qualities of the
individual. No one fits an exact
mold or cruises through life
completely unscathed Amaz
ingly few swim surely in the
vari-colored sea of La Coste al
ligators. A stereotypical image
that strikes one as amusing be
comes dehumanizing as it pro
ceeds to strip away the individ
ual's uniqueness.
Next time you recognize me
toting my tome of Organic
Chemistry notes and flashcards
to class in a gym bag. because
my overstuffed knapsack's zip
per broke, don't consign me to
the ranks of faceless pre-meds.
Don't condemn me as too prep,
too punk, or too anything in par
ticular if you chance to see me
indulgently splashing through

puddles tomorrow morning in
shocking green L.L. Bean rain
galoshes. We fit the spaces we
define for ourselves. Let's not
severely limit that area by
choosing a narrow path that pro
pels us "through the intersec
tion" without more than a fleet
ing glance in the side-view mir
rors to check the blindspot.

Course evaluations
As Stanford students, we have
the opportunity and responsi
bility to assess a course,
critique the teaching of it and
recommend means by which
both the course and the teaching
could be improved.
The current process of Uni
versity-sponsored course eval
uation is the outgrowth of a 1977
Faculty Senate resolution —
passed unanimously — embrac
ing "the principle of universal
course evaluation by students."
The validity and utility of such
assessments, as a teaching aid
and as a factor in tenure de
cisions, was the topic of vigor
ous discussion before the even
tual Senate support of eval
uation by students. Dissemina

systematic evaluation of
courses and instructors includ

student judgements. .
This system is currently un

the Senate Subcommittee on
Evaluation and Improvement of

Teaching. As this group per

To faculty members, we urge
you to allot time in one of the
final class meetings for stu

class are a valuable encourage

designate a student to return the
completed evaluations to the
Registrar and that you release
the results to the Course (luide.
To students, we ask you to fill

Take the few extra moments —
it will increase the value of this
evaluation for our faculty and to

In response to Lisa Bernard's

"Becoming a Princess" (Daily,
