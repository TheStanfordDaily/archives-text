## Reagan proposes revised budget 
### 
Washington (AP) — Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, declaring,
the next steps are up to Con
gress," yesterday proposed
$48.6 billion in spending cuts for
1982 across the breadth of gov
ernment, sparing defense and
little else from the chopping
block.
The $695.3 billion budget for
1982 would leave a deficit of $45
billion. It urges newly an
nounced spending reductions in
more than 200 areas, including
veterans and job programs, wa
ter projects and mortgage in
surance.
"The plan I outlined will stop
runaway inflation and revitalize
our economy if given a chance,"
Reagan said in a statement that
outlined cuts in more nearly 300
programs from food stamps to
space exploration.
In a revamped version of his
1982 spending plans, the presi
dent said he is prepared to rec
ommend still deeper spending
cuts if necessary to keep federal
spending from rising faster. In
relaying his plan to Congress,
Reagan pointedly reminded
lawmakers and special interest
groups that he felt he was acting
on a "mandate for change" de
livered by the voters last fall.
"There is nothing more im

portant than putting America's
economic house in order. The
next steps are up to Congress."
he said.
Reagan submitted his revised
1982 budget in tandem with the
details on his proposal for a
three-year cut in personal in
come tax rates of 10 percent a
year. Top Republicans on Con
gress' tax-writing committees
were to introduce the adminis
tration's tax plan later today.
Deep cuts

cuts in the spending blueprint
President Carter recommended
before leaving office.
The more than 200 newly dis
closed program cuts included:
—a $700 million reduction in
Veterans Administration spend
ing, forcing deferral or can
cellation of hospital construc
tion;
—Cuts in the Comprehensive
Employment and Training Ad
ministration (CETA) in addi
tion to the previously announced
intention to abolish the $3.6
billion public service jobs pro
gram that employs 310,000 peo
ple.
—Sharp reductions in Federal
Housing Administration and
Government National Mortgage
Association mortgage insur

ance and loan guarantee com
mitments.
—Cutbacks of scheduled in
creases in railroad retirement
benefits.
—Reduction of about $180 mil
lion in the Corps of Engineers
water project program, a politi
cally popular item in Congress.
—Reduced federal subsidies
for merchant shipbuilding and a
cutback in credit assistance for
small businesses.
Further cuts
Reagan also announced
further cuts beyond what he
specified on Feb. 18 in numerous
programs, including food and
nutrition, education, scientific
research, the space program
and the Rural Electrification
Administration.
Reagan said his budget rec
ommendations would preserve
the "social safety net" of in
come security programs passed
beginning in the 19305, including
basic Social Security pensions,
unemployment compensation,
welfare for the neediest and
basic veterans' benefits.
In explaining his decision to
call for $4.8 billion in increased
defense spending, he said a
"margin of safety must be
created by rebuilding the na
tion's defense capabilities."
Reagan also targets a small
group of other programs for in
creases over the Carter admin
istration budget, including $400
million in foreign military, se
curity and economic assistance
funds.
He also recommended $222
million for the Clinch River
Breeder Reactor, which Carter
wanted t*> scrap, along with
nearly $500 million increases in

other energy areas, including
the Strategic Petroleum Re
serves.
As a result of the military in
creases and sharp cuts in social
programs, the defense share of
Reagan's budget would rise
from 24 percent in 1981 to 27 per
cent next year and 37 percent by
1986.
More than $8 billion of the
1982 budget cuts proposed by
Reagan were borrowed from
recommendations left by his
Democratic predecessor.
Reagan also asked Congress
to cut $6.4 billion from the 1981
budget. Under his plan, federal
spending would increase $41.6
billion from the 1981 projected
figure of $655 billion — a 6 per
cent rise compared with 13 per
cent between 1980 and 1981.
"These are unprecedented
cuts to meet an unprecedented
situation, " the president said as
he signed the package in the
Rose Garden. "They mark the
end of an old era and the begin
ning of a new one."
Even with the cuts, federal
spending would still rise in fis
cal 1982, which begins Oct. 1, al
though more slowly than in the
past.
The cuts were coupled with
the plan to reduce personal in
come tax rates across the board
by 10 percent a year for three
years. Reagan also wants to
give businesses a tax break in
the form of more rapid depreci
ation.
The president outlined most
of his economic plan in a Feb. 18
message to Congress, but he de
tailed only $34.8 billion of the
1982 budget cuts he wants in
slightly more than 80 programs.

spending would increase $41.6
billion from the 1981 projected
figure of $655 billion — a 6 per
cent rise compared with 13 per
cent between 1980 and 1981.
"These are unprecedented
cuts to meet an unprecedented
situation, " the president said as
he signed the package in the
Rose Garden. "They mark the
end of an old era and the begin
ning of a new one."
Even with the cuts, federal
spending would still rise in fis
cal 1982, which begins Oct. 1, al
though more slowly than in the
past.
The cuts were coupled with
the plan to reduce personal in
come tax rates across the board
by 10 percent a year for three
years. Reagan also wants to
give businesses a tax break in
the form of more rapid depreci
ation.
The president outlined most
of his economic plan in a Feb. 18
message to Congress, but he de
tailed only $34.8 billion of the
1982 budget cuts he wants in
slightly more than 80 programs.
Washington (AP) — Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, declaring,
the next steps are up to Con
gress," yesterday proposed
$48.6 billion in spending cuts for
1982 across the breadth of gov
ernment, sparing defense and
little else from the chopping
block.
The $695.3 billion budget for
1982 would leave a deficit of $45
billion. It urges newly an
nounced spending reductions in
more than 200 areas, including
veterans and job programs, wa
ter projects and mortgage in
surance.
"The plan I outlined will stop
runaway inflation and revitalize
our economy if given a chance,"
Reagan said in a statement that
outlined cuts in more nearly 300
programs from food stamps to
space exploration.
In a revamped version of his
1982 spending plans, the presi
dent said he is prepared to rec
ommend still deeper spending
cuts if necessary to keep federal
spending from rising faster. In
relaying his plan to Congress,
Reagan pointedly reminded
lawmakers and special interest
groups that he felt he was acting
on a "mandate for change" de
livered by the voters last fall.
"There is nothing more im

portant than putting America's
economic house in order. The
next steps are up to Congress."
he said.
Reagan submitted his revised
1982 budget in tandem with the
details on his proposal for a
three-year cut in personal in
come tax rates of 10 percent a
year. Top Republicans on Con
gress' tax-writing committees
were to introduce the adminis
tration's tax plan later today.
Deep cuts
Reagan 's budget makes deep
cuts in the spending blueprint
President Carter recommended
before leaving office.
The more than 200 newly dis
closed program cuts included:
—a $700 million reduction in
Veterans Administration spend
ing, forcing deferral or can
cellation of hospital construc
tion;
—Cuts in the Comprehensive
Employment and Training Ad
ministration (CETA) in addi
tion to the previously announced
intention to abolish the $3.6
billion public service jobs pro
gram that employs 310,000 peo
ple.
—Sharp reductions in Federal
Housing Administration and
Government National Mortgage
Association mortgage insur

ance and loan guarantee com
mitments.
—Cutbacks of scheduled in
creases in railroad retirement
benefits.
—Reduction of about $180 mil
lion in the Corps of Engineers
water project program, a politi
cally popular item in Congress.
—Reduced federal subsidies
for merchant shipbuilding and a
cutback in credit assistance for
small businesses.
Further cuts
Reagan also announced
further cuts beyond what he
specified on Feb. 18 in numerous
programs, including food and
nutrition, education, scientific
research, the space program
and the Rural Electrification
Administration.
Reagan said his budget rec
ommendations would preserve
the "social safety net" of in
come security programs passed
beginning in the 19305, including
basic Social Security pensions,
unemployment compensation,
welfare for the neediest and
basic veterans' benefits.
In explaining his decision to
call for $4.8 billion in increased
defense spending, he said a
"margin of safety must be
created by rebuilding the na
tion's defense capabilities."
Reagan also targets a small
group of other programs for in
creases over the Carter admin
istration budget, including $400
million in foreign military, se
curity and economic assistance
funds.
He also recommended $222
million for the Clinch River
Breeder Reactor, which Carter
wanted t*> scrap, along with
nearly $500 million increases in

other energy areas, including
the Strategic Petroleum Re
serves.
As a result of the military in
creases and sharp cuts in social
programs, the defense share of
Reagan's budget would rise
from 24 percent in 1981 to 27 per
cent next year and 37 percent by
1986.
More than $8 billion of the
1982 budget cuts proposed by
Reagan were borrowed from
recommendations left by his
Democratic predecessor.
Reagan also asked Congress
to cut $6.4 billion from the 1981
budget. Under his plan, federal
spending would increase $41.6
billion from the 1981 projected
figure of $655 billion — a 6 per
