# Fails to confess crimes
## Murderer executed 
### Los Angeles Times 
Michigan City, Ind. — It
was midnight and con
demned killer Steven Judy
was about to take his last six
steps into eternity.
A guard snapped a series
of pictures of Judy s final
moments, spent with his at
torney, Steven Harris, and as
the prisoner inhaled another
Pall Mall cigarette, he joked
that he had decided to quit
smoking. Both men grinned
and then the mood turned se
rious.
Rearching into his waist
band, Judy withdrew a letter
— a letter eagerly awaited by
Indiana law enforcement
people because Judy earlier
promised to leave behind de
tails of a number of unsolved
crimes that he committed.
"Now, don't open this until
I'm dead," a solemn Judy
said. Harris nodded and bid
his client a final farewell.
After Harris witnessed the
execution and the black cur
tain had been pulled around
the electric chair and Judy's
lifeless body, the attorney
reached for the letter — a fat
sheaf of folded writing pa
per.
Blank paper
Instead of a litany of
crimes, however, Harris
found six blank sheets of pa
per and a short note.
"He said he was sorry to

change his mind about con
fessing, but he didn't want to
cause any more problems for
his foster family," said
Harris
So, Judy died without re
solving any outstanding
criminal investigations, and
without expressing remorse
for his brutal murders of an
Indianapolis mother and her
three children.
Judy's stay on death row
and his last days leading up
to the early-morning execu
tion Monday at Indiana State
Prison were marked by wise
cracks, jokes and often
macabre humor.
Taunted warden
He once needled the war
den, an ordained minister,
about whether the former
missionary could pull the
lever on the electric chair
when the time came. Days
before, Judy reportedly
laughed and told him: "You
can't do it."
And he quit biting his fin
gernails, he told his foster
family, so that his hands
would "show better" when
crossed over his chest in the
casket.
He insisted that he wanted
to wear his wristwatch to the
chair "to get it charged up."
although in the end he left it
with a fellow inmate.
