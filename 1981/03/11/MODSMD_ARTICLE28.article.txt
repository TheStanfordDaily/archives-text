# Alien journey
## 
### 
Illegal aliens wait at a train station in Bronx, N.Y. for immigration Service officials to come
for them. Hopeful of starting a new and better life, 85 people travelled 2180 miles from El
Paso, Texas to the South Bronx locked inside a tractor trailer with no daylight or fresh air. The
aliens, all Mexican nationals, were deported.
