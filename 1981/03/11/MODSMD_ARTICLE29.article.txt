# Space shuttle astronauts:'We're ready to go'
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Houston — The two
astronauts who are to fly the
American space shuttle Colum
bia on its maiden flight in space
next month Monday pronounced
both themselves and their space
plane ready, willing and eager
to undertake the mission.
"It's just about ready to go,"
mission commander John
Young, said of the Columbia,
now on a Cape Canaveral Fla.,
launch stand. "And I can sure
guarantee you that Bob and I are
too."
"Bob'' is Navy Capt. Robert
Crippen, 43, the Columbia's pi
lot. Young, a veteran of two
Gemini and two Apollo space
flights, will direct the 2 1 /z day
long. 36-orbit flight that is pres
ently targeted to begin April 7.
Appearing at a press con
ference here, the two men
looked more like executives
than test pilots in their three
piece suits. It was the final
press conference before their
flight.
In discussing the various
"aborts" that have been
planned for the Columbia's as

cent trajectory, in the event of
engine problems, Young said
that the one he and Crippen pre
fer would carry them directly
from Cape Canaveral to a land
ing strip at the U.S. Naval base
at Rota, Spain. They prefer it
because "it doesn't involve the
use of ejection seats or too far a
swim," Young said.
Steer toward Spain
This abort trajectory would
be flown only if the Columbia
lost two of its three liquid-fuel
rocket engines late in its climb.
Unable to make it into space,
Young and Crippen then would
steer their space plane toward
Spain at a top speed of almost
15,000 miles an hour.
The National Aeronautics and
Space Administration has iden
tified 170 major test objectives
for the four test flights to be
staged by the Columbia — rang
ing from the performance of the
space plane's solid-propellant
motors and liquid-fuel rocket
engines to the opening and clos
ing of its 60-foot-long cargo com
partment doors — and that 130
of those tests will be attempted
during the April mission.

"This," said Young, in what
surely was understatement, "is
going to be an interesting
flight."
No scientific or technological
experiments will be aboard the
space plane for the initial 54 "2 -
hour shake-down cruise, and no
dramatic space walks are
planned.
On a more serious note,

Young expressed strong feel
ings about the value of the shut
tle system — a fleet of four, pos
sibly five, is to be built and oper
ated in space through the re
mainder of this century — to the
nation's future
When it is operational, we will
do in five to VO years in space
what it would take 20 to 30 years
to do otherwise."

"There is no question in my
mind that the capability to put
65,000 pounds in a low earth or
bit will absolutely revolutionize
the way we do business here on
earth." Young said of the space
plane's cargo carrying capaci
ties. "It will measurably im
prove the defense capabiUVy oi
the country and it will help de
velop science and technology.
