# Trustees approve more outdoor lighting

The Board of Trustees has approved
a major plan for additional campus
lighting in response to concern from
the Stanford Community for increased
personal safety. Construction of the
1980-81 project, part of a com
prehensive ten-year plan, will begin in
April, according to Max Mazenko,
campus planner.
Approximately $200,000 has been al
located for the project this year, and a
similar sum has been considered for
next year.
Senate Chairman, Doug Mitchell,
said the ASSU endorsed the plan last
Fall. At that time Student Affairs
Chairman Clay Smith met with the
planning office and submitted the of
fice's ten-year lighting plan to the Sen
ate for approval, she said
The Senate was satisfied that the
plan adequately responded to stu
dent's needs, Mitchell added If con

struction is delayed, the ASSU ex
pedite the matter by bringing it up in a
Student Affairs Committee meeting
with Mazenko, he said.
Mazenko identified four considera
tions used in determining the necessi
ty and feasibility of any new lighting
project on campus. They are: security
from theft and personal attack, safety
from accidents, economy (limiting
energy consumption), and aesthetic
compatibility with existing struc
tures. The needs for personal security
and safety are the primary considera
tions, Mazenko added.
In addition, the Stanford Police
have recommended that certain areas

not be lit, to discourage their use. Ac
cording to Captain William
Wullschleger, the police prefer to con
fine traffic to several major routes
along which they can insure an ade
quate patrol.
Though increased lighting con
tributes to people's comfort, it does
not necessarily alleviate the existing
danger of attack.
"We do not want to create a false
sense of security," said Mazenko.
Accordingly, areas of heavy use, es
pecially student residences and main
routes into campus, are priorities for
the 1980-81 project.
Where possible, existing lighting

structures will be improved rather
than replaced. In some cases, this can
be done by switching from incandes
cent lighting to the more efficient
mercury vapor lighting, which has a
longer life and great intensity of il
lumination for the same amount of
electricity.
The 1981-82 plan includes comple
tion of the lighting around the
fraternities; improving the structures
around Wilbur Hall; and lighting the
bicycle paths in Escondido Village,
the parking lot between Branner and
Toyon Halls, Serra Street, in front of
the Quad, the Press Courtyard, and
the front of Old Green Library
Other areas of concern, such as the
inner Quad around Memorial Church,
and the area surrounding the site of
the new Music Building, are scheduled
to receive additional lighting as part
of the larger reconstruction effort.
In all cases the planners must bal
ance the need to expand lighting

against the desire to curtail energy
consumption. The rising cost of
energy is cited as the single factor
causing the greatest increase in Uni
versity expenditures.
A complete description of the ten
year lighting plan can be obtained by
consulting the Master Plan Report
available at the Planning Office.
