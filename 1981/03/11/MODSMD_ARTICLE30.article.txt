Atlanta (AP) — A group of black ministers and
supporters marched to Atlanta's federal building
Monday to ask the Reagan administration to de
clare the city a disaster area, making additional
funds available for the investigation of the
murders of 20 children.
The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, told
about 400 blacks gathered on the steps of the build
ing that their support is "the beginning of a new
movement'' similar to the civil rights movement
of the 19605.
The National Black United Front, a group of
representatives from several black organiza
tions, is planning demonstrations in 20 cities on
April 4 — the date civil rights leader Martin Lu
ther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968 — to protest

the killing of blacks in several cities in the past
two years, spokeswoman Gwenn Kelly said Mon
day.
Mayor Maynard Jackson said Monday the in
vestigation of the 20 slayings and the disap
pearance of one other black child already has cost
the city more than $1 million and continues to
grow at the rate of $200,000 a month.
Although the federal government already has
provided some aid to the city, including a $979,000
grant to cope with the problems the unsolved
crimes have caused, the march Monday was a call
for additional funds to help solve the crimes.
The U.S. Justice Department has offered
$264,000 worth of technical assistance in the in
vestigation, but Jackson has asked for more.
