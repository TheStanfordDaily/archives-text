# Coffee: a perfect '10'?
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
To most people coffee drink
ing provides a way of putting
some life into early morning
blues, when the blood seems to
have the sluggishness of molten
lead, or of staying awake to
cram for exams.
But for Mark Enayati, the
owner of Coffee Affair, a coffee
specialty store in Palo Alto, it is
an art and a hobby next to his job
as math teacher at Menlo-Athe
rton High School.
Coffee is consumed by one
third of the world's population.
The beverage has inspired many
people: Johann Sebastian Bach
wrote a mocking cantata about
the evils of drinking it and Hon
ore de Balzac, the prolific
French novelist, drank 20 cups a
night.
Legend has it that Kaldi, an
Arab goatherd, discovered cof
fee in the 9th century. Kaldi no
ticed the strange behavior of his
flock after feeding on the ber
ries of the bush and after trying
it himself, he proclaimed his
discovery to the world.
Inspite of the prohibition on
the consumption of coffee by or
thodox Muslim priests, its use
spread rapidly and was in
troduced in Europe in the 16th
and 17th centuries.
So, if you are sick and tired of
the bitter coffee which tastes of
mud and prevails in most offices
and homes, Enayati may have

an alternative for you.
Walk past the Lytton Ave.
store, and you are likely to be
overpowered by the smell of
coffee. Inside, surrounded by
burlap bags full of still green
coffee. Enayati roasts his
beans.
The machine hums and hisses
as it swirls the coffee inside its
silvery drum. The aroma per
vades everything as the magic
transformation from tasteless
and odorless beans to shiny
brown coffee takes place inside.
Enayati is a purist. He bought
the $20,000 machine, the first of
its kind in the country, and
fought the county government
to have it approved for six
months. He even had a filter de
signed for it by a Lockheed engi
neer.
Most of the people who come
in here for the first time haven't
seen unroasted coffee. They
think that it grows already
brown," Enayati said, adding
that he used to think the same
thing.
Enayati's love of coffee
began when he worked in a Vien
nese coffee house while he was
studying business there in 1958.
He noticed that most coffee
houses in Vienna roasted their
own coffee, ensuring freshness,
instead of buying it already
roasted from wholesalers as
most coffee stores do here.
Enayati said that there is yet
another reason why his roasting
method is superior. In whole
sale companies the coffee is
roasted by direct exposure to
the gas flame. "That way the
coffee is roasted faster and gets
a shiny color but the process
kills the identity of the bean,"
Enayati said.
Quick roasting is not the only
reason why so much of the run
of-the-mill office coffee has a
bitter taste. It is often burned
while it is roasted or brewed.
Most coffee available in the su
permarket is of inferior quality,
according to Enayati. The large
companies are simply not in
terested in the gourmet quality
beans that shops like Coffee Af
fair carry.
Enayati talks about coffee
with the same delicacy as wine
lovers talk about vintages and
grapes. He talks about bouquet,
body and color, and claims to be
able to tell the difference be
tween two different kinds of
beans from the same country.
The best coffee comes from
the mountainous regions of Ja
maica, Colombia, and Brazil,
Enayati said; "the beans have a

harder shell so they roast more
evenly and they can be roasted
for. longer periods, allowing
more time for the flavor to de
velop."
But Enayati is a relativist
when it comes to taste."l cannot
educate people to change their
taste. People should try to ad
vance themselves through dif
ferent blends to find out what
roasts give them pleasure."
To encourage people to share
in his appreciation of coffee and
choose between the 22 blends in
his store, Enayati offers free
sample cups of coffee as well as
a sniff or two of the freshly
ground coffee.
When you are buying coffee
you should keep several things
in mind "To find out whether
you are getting the right kind of
coffee," said Enayati, "you
should sniff it to detect any kind
of staleness or burned smell."
Enayati advises people to
start with "the Continental
roast." a light coffee bean.
"The lighter a coffee is the
more flavor and aroma it has.
The darker the coffee the
stronger it is but you lose some
flavor. This is where blending
begins. The darker coffee is
added for strength, the lighter
for body and flavor."
What is important in making
the perfect cup of coffee? First,
you start with freshly ground
coffee. The grind has to be fine
and even. The finer it is the
more flavor you get out of it.
You can keep the coffee for a
week in a tight jar or for longer
in a freezer, Enayati said.
Next, you have to put in the
right amount of coffee,"about
one tablespoon for the first
three or four cups, then you can
start decreasing the amount,"
Enayati said.
"Never make coffee with
boiling water or leave it on
direct heat for long periods of
time," Enayati said;"the cof
fee will cook and the flavor will
evaporate from it."
Enayati and his wife opened
their store about a year ago af
ter renovating the bar which
used to be at the location. The
Coffee Affair is one of those rare
family run stores, a place where
you can feel at home. Enayati's
wife Dorothy is the store's man
ager and both of their daughters
work at the store. Coffee is not
the only thing available; the
store has 78 different kinds of
teas as well as all imaginable
implements for the brewing and
grinding of coffee and tea.
