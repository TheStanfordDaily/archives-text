## This week's page presents some of the latest finds in high energy physics Physicists pursue Quarks 
### Eric Cornell 
When we learned about elec
tricity in high school physics,
our teachers told us that the
smallest unit of charge is the
charge on an electron or a pro
ton. But their lectures never
mentioned naked bottomness or
charmed flavor or a fishy-soun
ding machine known as a
SQUID.
This strange terminology ap
plies to a family of subatomic
particles known as quarks. Sci
entists theorize that quarks may
be as near a thing to the fun
damental basis of all matter as
anyone will ever find. What sets
quarks apart from the dozens of
other particles is that quarks
have fractional charge, that is,
each has one-third or two-thirds
of the static electricity that an
electron or a proton has. Quarks
bundle up in packages of three to
make up neutrons and protons,
once thought to be fundamental,
indivisible particles.
Until recently, quarks were
strictly hypothetical — various
theories predicted that they ex
isted, but scientists had never
found one. But Stanford re
searchers in two different
branches of experimental phys
ics — high energy and low tem
perature — are closing in on the
elusive quark.
In the basement of the Varian
building, a metal cylinder simi
lar to an enormous thermos bot
tle clicks happily away, daily
accumulating more evidence
for the existence of fractional
charge. Run by Prof. Bill Fair
bank and graduate students Jim
Phillips and George Laßue the
device is similar to the ap
paratus used by the turn of the
century physicist Millikan to
measure the charge on an oil
drop.
The difference is that in the
modern device, the oildrop is re
placed by a niobium metal
sphere million times larger. Be
cause the sphere is so much
larger, it is much more likely to
contain a fractionally charged
particle.
If there is no fractional
charge on the sphere, it should
be possible to reduce the natural
charge on the sphere to exactly
zero by adding just the right
number of electrons or
positrons to cancel it out. But if
there is a particle with, say, a
one-third charge somewhere in
the sphere, then no matter how
many whole charges one adds to
or takes away form the sphere.

one will never be able to cancel
the charge to exactly zero.
The highly sensitive meas
urements necessary for this ex
periment are made possible by
several newly developed tech
niques. Just as in Millikan's ex
periment, the charge on the
floating sphere is measured by
applying an electric field and
seeing how much the sphere
moves. But whereas Millikan's
oil drops were so tiny that air re
sistance and the electric field
were sufficient to keep them
from falling, the metal spheres
float in a vacuum and are so
massive that they require a
strong and absolutely constant
magnetic field to support them.
This field is supplied by a super
conducting coil of wire.
At the turn of the century, it
was discovered that certain
metals, when cooled to very low
temperatures, (close to -451
degrees fahrenheit) lose all
their resistance to electric cur
rent. They become super
conductive.
If you set a current flowing in
a superconducting loop of wire,
it will flow forever, never slow
ing down, incidentally produc
ing a precisely constant mag
netic field.
The superconductivity effect
is the basis for another impor
tant experimental tool: the su
perconducting quantum in
terferometer device (SQUID).
SQUID measures slight per
turbations in the magnetic field
caused by nearly imperceptible
movements of the sphere.
These measurements allow a
computer to determine the ex
act location of the sphere.
Over the 15 years this experi
ment has been in progress, Fair
bank, Phillips, Laßue, and ex
graduate student Arthur
Hebard have developed pro
cedures for correcting for vari
ous imperfections in their ex
perimental apparatus which
would otherwise have resulted
in spurious charge meas
urements.
They can now measure the
charge on a sphere to an ac
curacy of about one hundredth
the charge on an electron.
This painstaking procedure
has paid off. Of the 15 balls ex
amined, over half of them have
shown fractional charge. While
this does not prove there are ac
tually quarks somewhere in the
spheres, it does show that there
is some sort of fractional charge
around, and current theory

holds that quarks would be the
only sort of particle to hold a
charge less than an electron.
The quarks Fairbank "sees"
may be left over from the "big
bang." Stanford Physics Prof.
Robert Wagoner and others
have suggested that a very few
nuclei, less than one in every
billion, may contain a quark
that has been unable to join with
other quarks after the colossal
"big bang" from which our uni
verse originated .
Quark theory, devised to fill
in a "missing link" in particle
theories of matter, has provided
the science world with some of
its more unusual technical
terms.
When the existence of quarks
was first proposed, an early ob
jection was that the theory al
lowed for two particles to have
exactly the same quantum num
bers, in violation of the Pauli ex
clusion principle, a principle
that states that quantum num
bers, such as charge and spin
are never duplicated exactly by
two particles. Physicists
worked their way around this by
proposing a new quantum
number, "color." Each variety
of quark is subdivided into three
colors. There are six varieties,
or "flavors" of quarks — up,
down, charm, strange, top and
bottom.
Since quarks almost always
come in groups in three, with
one of each color in the bundle,
the colors cancel out, producing
"white." The color of a particle
will appear only when it is
alone, or "naked."
Normally, a quark is never
"naked." Quark pairs or tri
plets are stuck together by par
ticles called, predictably
enough, "gluons." One theory,
known as "confinement," main
tains that quarks can never be
split into single, "naked"
quarks. The gluon bonds are ex
tremely stong, and even if they
could be stretched to breaking
point, according to the theory,
the gluon would, in effect, turn
into two quarks to join with the
two newly freed quarks to form
"white" couplets or triplets
again. The effect is loosely
analogous to a ball of India rub
ber which, when stretched
apart, snaps back again into two
round balls rather than two
hemispheres. By this theory,
the only quarks we will ever see
are those left over from the big
bang.
