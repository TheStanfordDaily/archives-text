# Cartwright links philosophy and physics

### Jim Thomas 
Under what conditions can we reasonably
claim that something exists? The question
may seem purely metaphysical, yet the
modern physicist is frequently faced with
particles that aren't (they're waves), fields
that aren't (they're particles), and, in the
case of the quarks particles that may be un
observable even in theory.
Questions like this fall in the realm of
both physics and philosophy, and Stanford
Philosophy Professor Nancy Cartwright is
trying to answer them.
When the Royal Society of London was
formed in 1660, the natural sciences and phi
losophy began to diverge. But new dis
coveries in physics has continued to lead
back to important philosophical questions,
and still are. For this reason, physicists to
day, particularly in high-energy or theo
retical physics, still need concern them
selves with philosophical questions, accord
ing to Cartwright.
Cartwright, who has an undergraduate

degree in Math-Physics from the University
of Pittsburg and a graduate degree in Phi
losophy from the University of Illinois at
Chicago Circle, is interested in the nature of
scientific laws, as well as the relationships
between them.
Cartwright has especially formed these
considerations on the laws. Are the laws of
physics more fundamental than the laws of
biology? One philosophical viewpoint, re
ductionism, maintains that they are. Reduc
tionists claim that the laws of biology are
just the laws of physics applied in the
biological domain.
For example, the rule "All rubies are red
would be seen as a special case of the rule
"All gemstones are primary colors," by re
ductionists. A reductionist might say that
the more general law is somehow more fun
damental.
Yet even in this simple example, each
rule contains information not in the other.
Because of this, Cartwright is skeptical of
the reductionist ontology. The difficulty in

reductionism is clear if we try to analyze
the economy, mental illness, or even the
growth of a tree from a quantum mechani
cal perspective, she says. Such analyses
may or may not be theoretically possible,
but in practice it cannot be done. Our knowl
edge of the world is not organized reductive
ly.
Cartwright says of reductionism, "I'd be
happier with assuming this metaphysical
picture of the world if more of our knowl
edge fit with it . . . It's a simple and com
pelling picture, but I think that before one
accepts a metaphysical picture, one wants
to have something over than philosophical
argument for thinking it's true."
Cartwright wants to see if there's some way
to construct an alternative metaphysics
with no "second class" laws.
Other philosophers here are studying
philosophical problems in other science-re
lated areas, liie department has a division
on the Philosophy of Statistics and philoso
phy, linguistics, and psychology.
