# SLAC: in search of the elements of matter
## 
### Mary Duenwald 
In 1968, a tiny electron, driven
two miles down Stanford's Line
ar Accelerator (SLAC) to
almost the speed of light
crashed into a proton with an un
precedented impact.
Carrying more than 40,000
times its original weight in
energy, the electron should have
passed through the stationary
proton. But instead it bounced
back off something hard inside.
Dr. Sidney Drell, assistant di
rector of SLAC, said, "In 1968
we learned that the proton
wasn't plum pudding but was
what I call raspberry jam. We
had the first hard evidence that
there were point-like objects in
side this jam, things we now call
quarks."
The scientists who built the
$114 million electron ac
celerator knew the beam would
allow them to refine their un
derstanding of the basic units of
atoms. They had smashed parti
cles in smaller accelators
before — SLAC was simply a
much stronger machine using a
more energetic beam to probe

nuclei by electron bombard
ment.
Electron accelerators had
grown steadily larger and more
powerful since Stanford Pro
fessor William Hansen built the
first yard-long machine in 1947.
A 14-foot machine was built a
year later, and by the early
19505, Stanford physicists made
a 300-foot electron beam.
Professor Robert Hofstadter
used this "Mark III" ac
celerator to examine nucleons
(protons and neutrons) and won
the 1961 Nobel Prize in physics
for his work. This machine still
operates in Stanford's High
Energy Physics Laboratory on
the main campus.
Hofstadter then became the
instigator of SLAC. He said a
machine 10 to 20 times more
powerful than the 300-foot ac
celerator was needed to explore
tinier atomic dimensions.
After President Eisenhower
personally endorsed the idea in
a radio speech, Congress agreed
to pay for the project, under the
direction of the Atomic Energy
Commission (now the Depart
ment of Energy). »
The first SLAC physicists
soon learned that their new ma
chine could create nuclear par
ticles as well as probe nuclei.
The experimenters made secon
dary beams of nuclear particles
and sent them through bubble
chambers.
The highly pressurized liquid
inside the bubble chambers
boils, molecule by molecule,
along the path of the passing
beam, and the scattering pat
terns can be photographed.
Smaller and smaller atomic
partcles were observed and un
derstood by probing and scatter
ing with the electron beam. But
the push for higher power
smashing continued.
A vacuum-tube ring, 70
meters in diameter, was added
to SLAC in 1972 to increase the
impact of particle crashes. The
SPEAR (Stanford Positron-
Electron Assymetric Ring) ma
chine stores two circulating

particle beams, electrons and
positrons (antimatter), which
collide at two detector locations
in the ring.
Drell described the advan
tage of colliding particles over
bombarding stationary targets:
"When our electron comes out
at the end of the accelerator, it
is very heavy, and you have to
think of it as something like an
elephant or a Mack truck.
"If you want to have a col
lision that tells you what's in
side the truck, you need two fast
trucks running into each other
That's what we do with the
storage ring," Drell said.
The positrons and electrons
annihilate on impact and create
a temporary field of pure
energy. Out of this field, sub
nuclear particles materialize in
the same way they are thought
to have been made at the begin
ning of the universe.
By colliding matter and anti
matter at such high energy,
physicists can observe an
artificial re-creation of the Big
Bang phenomenon.
Moving ahead from the suc
cessful collision work in
SPEAR, SLAC scientists built a
larger and more powerful de
vice, the $78 million PEP
(Positron-Electron Project)
ring. As with the SPEAR
project, Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory collaborated with
SLAC to build PEP under the
Department of Energy.
As in SPEAR, particles are
guided around a ring by a series
of magnets.
PEP has six collision detec
tion stations, one on each
straight section. Positrons and
electrons speeding in opposite
directions collide with a com
bined energy of 36 billion elec
tron volts, 50,000 times the
energy of the linear ac
celerator.
PEP was completed in May of
1980, and the physics experi
ments began there just before
Christmas.
One project at PEP is focused
on isolating the elusive quark

particle. Because quarks have
"color," a physical property
that requires their combining
with quarks of neutralizing col
ors, they have never before been
observed standing alone.
Another PEP experiment is
designed to study collisions be
tween two gamma rays, which
are created by positron-electron
annihilation. Scientists from
several California universities
and from the University of Am
sterdam are collaborating in
this project.
In the same experimental sta
tion number two, physicists
from Lawrence Berkeley, Johns
Hopkins University, the Univer
sity of Tokyo, UCLA and Yale
are operating a device that
should identify every particle
produced in the gamma ray col
lisions. This is considered
PEP's most ambitious experi
ment.
As PEP enters its first year of
operation, SLAC is already hop
ing to build a machine for more
powerful particle collisions.
The proposed collider would
take three years to build, how
ever, and SLAC and Lawrence
Berkeley scientists are in a race
with the Europeans for its in
tended z-zero discovery.
Machine advancement has
been SLAC's major contribution
to technology. Because of its
"pure research" orientation,
technological advancements
made at SLAC have so far been
limited to those made by build
ing experimental equipment.
"We have paced the applica
tion of computer control of ma
chines, for example," said
Drell, "and we've developed
large computers for analyzing
vast quantities of data."
Drell said SLAC has also ad
vanced the technology of cold
magnets and vacuum tubes, and
has increased the tolerance of
fine instruments.
Although the subatomic re
search at SLAC is directed at
basic knowledge, Drell said,
"We've been working right at
the technological frontier."

take three years to build, how
ever, and SLAC and Lawrence
Berkeley scientists are in a race
with the Europeans for its in
tended z-zero discovery.
Machine advancement has
been SLAC's major contribution
to technology. Because of its
"pure research" orientation,
technological advancements
made at SLAC have so far been
limited to those made by build
ing experimental equipment.
"We have paced the applica
tion of computer control of ma
chines, for example," said
Drell, "and we've developed
large computers for analyzing
vast quantities of data."
Drell said SLAC has also ad
vanced the technology of cold
magnets and vacuum tubes, and
has increased the tolerance of
fine instruments.
Although the subatomic re
search at SLAC is directed at
basic knowledge, Drell said,
"We've been working right at
the technological frontier."
In 1968, a tiny electron, driven
two miles down Stanford's Line
ar Accelerator (SLAC) to
almost the speed of light
crashed into a proton with an un
precedented impact.
Carrying more than 40,000
times its original weight in
energy, the electron should have
passed through the stationary
proton. But instead it bounced
back off something hard inside.
Dr. Sidney Drell, assistant di
rector of SLAC, said, "In 1968
we learned that the proton
wasn't plum pudding but was
what I call raspberry jam. We
had the first hard evidence that
there were point-like objects in
side this jam, things we now call
quarks."
The scientists who built the
$114 million electron ac
celerator knew the beam would
allow them to refine their un
derstanding of the basic units of
atoms. They had smashed parti
cles in smaller accelators
before — SLAC was simply a
much stronger machine using a
more energetic beam to probe

nuclei by electron bombard
ment.
Electron accelerators had
grown steadily larger and more
powerful since Stanford Pro
fessor William Hansen built the
first yard-long machine in 1947.
A 14-foot machine was built a
year later, and by the early
19505, Stanford physicists made
a 300-foot electron beam.
Professor Robert Hofstadter
used this "Mark III" ac
celerator to examine nucleons
(protons and neutrons) and won
the 1961 Nobel Prize in physics
for his work. This machine still
operates in Stanford's High
Energy Physics Laboratory on
the main campus.
Hofstadter then became the
instigator of SLAC. He said a
machine 10 to 20 times more
powerful than the 300-foot ac
celerator was needed to explore
tinier atomic dimensions.
After President Eisenhower
personally endorsed the idea in
a radio speech, Congress agreed
to pay for the project, under the
direction of the Atomic Energy
Commission (now the Depart
ment of Energy). »
The first SLAC physicists
soon learned that their new ma
chine could create nuclear par
ticles as well as probe nuclei.
The experimenters made secon
dary beams of nuclear particles
and sent them through bubble
chambers.
The highly pressurized liquid
inside the bubble chambers
boils, molecule by molecule,
along the path of the passing
beam, and the scattering pat
terns can be photographed.
Smaller and smaller atomic
partcles were observed and un
derstood by probing and scatter
ing with the electron beam. But
the push for higher power
smashing continued.
A vacuum-tube ring, 70
meters in diameter, was added
to SLAC in 1972 to increase the
impact of particle crashes. The
SPEAR (Stanford Positron-
Electron Assymetric Ring) ma
chine stores two circulating

particle beams, electrons and
positrons (antimatter), which
collide at two detector locations
in the ring.
Drell described the advan
tage of colliding particles over
bombarding stationary targets:
"When our electron comes out
at the end of the accelerator, it
is very heavy, and you have to
think of it as something like an
elephant or a Mack truck.
"If you want to have a col
lision that tells you what's in
side the truck, you need two fast
trucks running into each other
That's what we do with the
storage ring," Drell said.
The positrons and electrons
annihilate on impact and create
a temporary field of pure
energy. Out of this field, sub
nuclear particles materialize in
the same way they are thought
to have been made at the begin
ning of the universe.
By colliding matter and anti
matter at such high energy,
physicists can observe an
artificial re-creation of the Big
Bang phenomenon.
Moving ahead from the suc
cessful collision work in
SPEAR, SLAC scientists built a
larger and more powerful de
vice, the $78 million PEP
(Positron-Electron Project)
ring. As with the SPEAR
project, Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory collaborated with
SLAC to build PEP under the
Department of Energy.
As in SPEAR, particles are
guided around a ring by a series
of magnets.
PEP has six collision detec
tion stations, one on each
straight section. Positrons and
electrons speeding in opposite
directions collide with a com
bined energy of 36 billion elec
tron volts, 50,000 times the
energy of the linear ac
celerator.
PEP was completed in May of
1980, and the physics experi
ments began there just before
Christmas.
One project at PEP is focused
on isolating the elusive quark

particle. Because quarks have
"color," a physical property
that requires their combining
with quarks of neutralizing col
ors, they have never before been
observed standing alone.
Another PEP experiment is
designed to study collisions be
tween two gamma rays, which
are created by positron-electron
annihilation. Scientists from
several California universities
and from the University of Am
sterdam are collaborating in
this project.
In the same experimental sta
tion number two, physicists
from Lawrence Berkeley, Johns
Hopkins University, the Univer
sity of Tokyo, UCLA and Yale
are operating a device that
should identify every particle
produced in the gamma ray col
lisions. This is considered
PEP's most ambitious experi
ment.
As PEP enters its first year of
operation, SLAC is already hop
ing to build a machine for more
powerful particle collisions.
