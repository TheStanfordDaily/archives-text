CIA proposes lessened restraints
Washington— A task force headed by Central In
telligence Agency officials put together a series of pro
posals to enable U.S. intelligence agencies to cast off cur
rent restrictions on spying in the United States.
The recommendations would drop the Carter adminis
tration's standard of using "the least intrusive" means
possible. The regulations are planned for a proposed ex
ecutive order to be issued by President Ronald Reagan.
Formal congressional approval would not be required.
The suggested new rules, sources said, would allow in
filtration of domestic organizations when "necessary" in
stead of ruling out such infiltration unless it is "essential."
The basic change in approach from the Carter adminis
tration was thedevelopment of a 30-page proposal that au
thorizes, instead of restricts, collection of intelligence in
formation and use of "intrusive techniques "
Stamp price hike called insufficient
Washington — The cost of mailng a first-class letter will
go from 15 cents to 18 cents on March 22, the Postal Service
announced yesterday.
The Board of Governors of the service, who had re
quested a 20-cent rate, took sharp issue with the Postal
Rate Commission, which approved the 18-cent rate in
stead.
"To achieve a lower stamp today, the commission has
chosen to ignore over $1 billion in revenue needs that need
to be collected in the near future," the governors said in a
statement released without elaboration
The governors said they would ask the rate commission
to reconsider. If their decision stands, they will soon ask
for another rate hike.
Cal. Congressmen protest oil lease
Washington — Interior Secretary James Watt met with
angry members of the California congressional delegation
yesterday over the issue of oil drilling off the state's
northern coast, but he promised little except to listen.
Cecil Andrus, who was President Carter's interior sec
retary, ruled last year that the fuel that might be produced
was insufficient to justify endangering to the four environ
mentally sensitive areas.
But Watt announced last month a reconsideration of
that decision and invited new comment on the question.
The announcement brought furious protests from all of

California's congressmen and from the office of California
Gov. Jerry Brown
After the meeting, Rep. John Burton described the ses
sion as "a complete waste of time The secretary couldn't
give us one reason to reopen the comment period."
The congressmen told Watt that California was clearly
against the sale, and warned that he would be "up to his
ears in lawsuits'' if he attempted to open the northern
coast to drilling.
Reagan heckled in Canada visit
Ottawa — Jeered by Canadian demonstrators who
burned an American flag and chanted "Yankee Go
Home!", President Ronald Reagan met yesterday with
Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau on problems that
come between two historically friendly and interdepen
dent neighbors.
The two leaders, who had never met, conferred in
Trudeau's oak-paneled office on Parliament Hill, discuss
ing El Salvador, East-West relations, and the potential im
pact of Reagan's economic program on the United States'
closest and largest trading partner.
Reagan s visit, the first to Canada by a U.S. president in
nearly a decade, is seen by Washington officials as a large
ly symbolic display of friendship. Reagan and Trudeau
cautioned against expecting tangible progress on issues
that have stirred strong national feelings here, including
intervention in Central America and an East Coast fish
eries treaty.

ident Reagan submitted his revised 1982 budget-cutting

noon after banks nationwide cut their prime lending rates
