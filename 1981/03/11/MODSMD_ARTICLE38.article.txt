# Panel speaks on El Salvador
## 
### Cindy Santana 
U.S. involvement in El Salvador
evoked a mixture of optimism and
pessimism from a group of four pan
elists yesterday during a symposium
in the series "A World Crisis: TheU.S.
Faces the '80s. "
Panelists included Albert Fishlow,
Yale professor of economics; David
Collier, director of the Center for
Latin American Studies at UC-
Berkeley; Clark Reynolds, economist
at the Stanford Food Research In
stitute; and Prof. Emeritus Ronald
Hilton, founder of Latin America
Studies at Stanford, and now ex
ecutive director of the California In
stitute of International Studies. Prof.
Dudley Kirk of the Food Research In
stitute chaired the symposium.
A major issue, according to Fish
low. is the "cycle of interest and disin
terest" the United States has adopted
toward Latin America. U.S. concern
diminishes when an external threat
diminishes. Fishlow said.
He said he regards U.S. involve
ment in El Salvador as more of a show
to the Soviets rather than a real per
sonal interest in the country.
"The U.S. has an asymmetrical re
lationship with Latin America. They
are not as important to us as we are to
them," Fishlow said. He added that
U.S. decisions have very important
implications in the region, but seldom
are Latin American interests con
sidered.
Fishlow said he does not believe,
however, that the current status of El
Salvador is analogous to Vietnam.

Private relations rather than govern
ment-to-government relations domi
nate, and the U.S. involvement "will
teach us very little about what U.S. un
derlying interests are," he pointed
out.
Collier provided an historical as
well as political overview of military
and elected regimes in Latin America.
According to Collier, established
leftist groups will be making more at
tempts to seize power through in
creased terrorism.
"There is a fascinating mix of mili
tary and political regimes in Latin
America that will be with us for a very
longtime," Collier said.
Reynolds focused his talk around
the "6 D's" in which he outlined fun
damental problems of development in
Latin America.
Debt and deficit are symptomatic
problems that occur with foreign bor
rowing to cover internal deficits,
"which has inflationary results," he
said.
Demographic pressure is the third
Latin American problem, Reynolds
said. According to Reynolds, Latin
America has not experienced the "190
percent population increase" the
United States has, but that it is trying
to cope with an expanding underclass.
Distribution and the demonstration
effect are fundamental problems for
dealing with the resources and capital
in Latin America.
The sixth "D" is "demogoguing,"
which Reynolds said is on the rise in
Latin America. Most political scien
tists have given up on democracy in

Latin America, but that there is still a
need for representative governments,
he said.
"Anything but an attempt at de
mocracy ends up as demogoguery,"
Reynolds said. He stated a need for in
creased mobility of domestic savings,
and increased fiscal responsibility, as
steps leading toward democracy.
Hilton's discussion emphasized a
balance between the "need for social
justice and need to prevent a take
over as part of a Soviet grand design."
He said that although no one person
or country has been successful in
"taking over the world," there is a
need to be concerned about a Soviet
master plan.
