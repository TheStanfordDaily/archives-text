# Students charged in dorm vandalism

Three Stanford freshmen have been
charged with vandalizing Alondra
House of Florence Moore Hall two
weeks ago. The three Donner resi
dents, James Miles, Jonathan Rief,
and Russell Harris, were heard knock
ing over chairs and smashing large
windows in the Alondra dining room,
according to the Stanford Police. On
their way out of the building, the sus-

pects also knocked over bicycles in the
breezeway, the police said.
Several Alondra residents followed
the suspects and confronted them in
White Plaza, and the suspects knocked
them down, police said. No assault
charges have been filed, however. A
Stanford Police officer followed the
suspects and interrogated them. Since
the officer had not seen the damage
done, they were released pending
further investigation.

Late last week the police presented
the Santa Clara County District At
torney with the necessary evidence,
and the three were charged with van
dalism, a misdemeanor. Rather than
arresting the students, the police in
formed them that warrants had been
issued for their arrest, and asked them
to surrender themselves to the author
ities. The students complied, and they
were released on $500 bail.
