# Meeting cancelled
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate meeting sched
uled for tonight has been cancelled.
Correction
In Friday's Daily article about
Sidney Drell, deputy director of SLAC,
Drell should have been quoted as
saying that an all-out nuclear en
counter would kill 100 million instant
ly. The Daily regrets the error.
