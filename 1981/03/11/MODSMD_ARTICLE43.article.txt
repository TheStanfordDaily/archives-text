# Lomnicky, Stephens, Meier lead effort
## Card '9' edges No. 2 Wildcats 
### Ralph Walker 
There was no one at Sunken
Diamond this weekend who devas
tated the opposition in quite the same
fashion as Reggie Jackson (Mr. Octo
ber) did with his World Series power
display a few years ago. But judging
from the clutch play of Gregg Lom
nicky, Daryl Stephens and Dave Meier
in Stanford's 4-9, 5-4, 14-12 series vic
tory over the Arizona Wildcats, they
each merit the title Mr. March.
Meier ammassed eight hits, two
home runs, and six RBI in 11 plate ap
pearances. Lomnicky threw six
brilliant innings of relief, and Ste
phens showed why he is one of the bet
ter centerfielders in the country with
a handful of heart-stopping catches
More important, however, than the
play of these individuals was the way
Stanford rallied as a team to win the
series after an initial, humiliating set
back.
Behind the pitching of Ed Vosberg,
two timely home runs, and five errors
by Meier, the defending NCAA cham
pions had little trouble disposing of the
Cardinals Friday afternoon.
Arizona took the lead in the third in
ning when an errant throw by Meier
with two outs allowed two runs to
score. Meier redeemed himself, how
ever, by slamming Vosberg's first
pitch of the fourth inning over the left
field fence to put the Cardinals within
one. He was immediately followed by
catcher Bill Worden who singled, and
scored one out later on third baseman
John Elway's RBI ground-out.
The Wildcat's bats were held to two
unearned runs on two hits through five
innings by losing pitcher Paul Grame
(5-2). But the Stanford ace slipped in
the sixth when,, with two runs on,
leftfielder Rocky Coyle hammered a
high fastball for a homerun that put
the Cats ahead 5-2.

Arizona added four more runs in the
eighth inning even though their only
hit was a three-run tater by third
baseman David Page. Meier again
helped the Wildcat cause by commit
ting four errors in the inning.
Vosberg had little trouble with the
Cardinal batters The smooth left
hander utilized a well chosen mixture
of pitches that kept Stanford off bal
ance the entire day.
"I was trying to pitch all the batters
in tight," Vosberg said, "because our
scouting reports showed that Stanford
hits the ball well when it's on the out
side or middle part of the plate."
Vosberg went the distance en route to
his fourth victory, scattering eight
hits, walking four, and striking out
five.
The second game marked a change
of momentum to Stanford's side. The
Cards opened by scoring two runs in
the bottom of the first, aided by three
walks and a wild pitch by Rich Lucero.
Stanford upped the margin to four in
the fourth. Daryl Stephens led off with
a single and was doubled home one out
later by by rightfielder Mike Tooth
man, who in turn scored from second
on another wild pitch by Lucero.
Cardinal hurler Brian Mignaro
meanwhile mowed down the Wildcat
lineup through the fourth inning, but
ran into trouble in the fifth. Coyle led
off the inning with a single, and a walk
to Casey Candaelle was sandwiched
between two infield outs that ap
peared to put Mignano out of danger.
The right-hander, however, fell into
serious control problems as he walked
the next two batters, the second of
which forced in Arizona's first run.
Arizona threatened in the sixth
when Mignano again lost control,
walking Coyle and Page on eight
straight pitches. Candaelle then lofted

a soft fly to centerfield that appeared
to be falling for a hit. Stephens, how
ever, raced in and saved perhaps two
runs with a fantastic diving catch.
Mignano described the play from
his standpoint. " A lot of times on a ball
hit like that you can turn around and
tell by the desperate look in the in
fielders' eyes that he's not going to
catch it. Daryl had that look, but at the
last second he dived and somehow
caught the ball. There is nothing in the
world that helps a pitcher more than
that."
But the Wildcat simply would not
quit. After catcher Garet Nago led off
the second inning with a single,
Dwight Taylor slapped a roller to first
baseman Mike Aldrete, whose throw
to second struck the sliding Nago in
the back.
The 1500 spectators then gasped as
second baseman Tommy Barret
smahed a line drive towards left field.
But the partisan crowd's fear turned
to joy as Elway nabbed the liner and
doubled Nago off second.
In the bottom of the seventh, Stan
ford scored what ultimately proved to
be the winning run. With two outs and
and the bases empty, back to back sin
gles by Elway and Bob Hausladen set
Meier's RBI single, that put Stanford
ahead, 5-1.
Mignano and Co. had successfully
stymied three potential Arizona
rallies by stranding 10 runners, but the
fortifications finally gave way in the
eighth.
Coyle led off with a single, but
Mignano bore down once again to re
tire the next two batters. The pesky
Nago, who entered the series hitting
.454., then ripped off his second
straight hit, moving Coyle to third.
