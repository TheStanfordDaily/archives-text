# Poetic victory over Cal
## Cagers end season 
### Chris Haft 
The Cardinals' 81-72 victory over
California Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion represented a culmination
for the men s basketball team in more
ways than one.
It fittingly culminated an arduous
but rewarding period of improvement
for the team that began the Pacific-10
Conference season with a 58-56 loss to
the Golden Bears.
It happily culminated four frustra
tion-filled years of service by seniors
Steve Crandell, Peter Lallas and Jeff
Ryan, who endured a string of losing
seasons but can at least salvage a
sweet final memory. Crandell ended
the game and his career by zealously
diving for a loose ball, and the 6-foot-7
Ryan made the most definitive play of
his Cardinal days when he slam
dunked over 6-foot-10 Mark
McNamara on a fast-break.
It impressively culminated a strong
season for co-captain Brian Welch, the
Cards' floor leader and top scorer,
who ravaged Cal for 25 points and nine
rebounds while playing the entire
game.
As usual, it wasn't an easy victory
for Stanford, which ends 1980-81 with a
9-18 overall record and a 5-13 Pac-10
finish, good for a seventh-place tie
with Cal. The Cards led by only one
point at half time, 35-34, and fell into a
51-51 deadlock with the Bears midway
in the second half.
But Stanford parlayed hustle and
accurate free-throw shooting to pre
vail over the Bears, who were foiled in
their attempt to finish with their first
winning season since 1974-75.
A refreshing, heightened spirit
tinged much of the Cards' heroics. "I
thought that there was a great emo

tional effort by our team," Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso said. "They did
something tonight they had to do —
play with enthusiasm and emotion . . .
and they did that very well."
Mature teams have the ability to
win despite the absences of key
players, and the Cards displayed such
maturity against Cal. Starting guard
Keith Jones, a Pac-10 All-Freshman
team selection and a vital part of Stan
ford's offense, missed his second
straight game with a bruise on the big
toe of his left foot.
Forward Orlando Ward, of course,
has been lost for the entire conference
season due to academic woes, and
guard Terry Smith has agonized
through another pain-wracked cam
paign.
But these players and all of Satur
day's starters will return in 1981-82.
Predictably, much of the talk in Stan
ford's jubilant post-game locker room
focused on next season.
"It's good to win to get things
started for next year. I'm excited
about next season already," Welch
said.
"If we can continue this momentum
with a good recruiting year, I think we
can create a lot more enthusiasm and
excitement in Maples Pavilion in
years to come," Dißiaso said. "We
have every right to expect that this
team is going to improve."
The entire scene made one wish that
next season could begin tomorrow.
The fans in the student section were
unusually aroused, throwing uncooked
hot dogs ("weenies" — get it?) at
Cal's band as it performed its custom
ary pre-game march down midcourt
and through the Stanford players dur
ing warm-ups
Even when it wasn't firing frank
furters. the near-sellout assemblage
of 7429 inspired the Cards as Maples
crowds seldom do "The crowd had a
tremendous impact on the way we
played tonight,'' Welch acknowl
edged
What had a tremendous impact on
the final outcome was Stanford's free
throw shooting The Cards, who in sea
sons past would lose close games due
to their shortcomings from the charity
stripe, capped their season-long ex
cellence at the foul line by making 35
one-pointers — a school single-game
record — in 40 attempts. Cal, by con
trast, tried only 15 free-throws and
made 10.
Stanford also established a new
school single-season mark by making
74.7 percent (484 of 648) of their free
throws, eclipsing the 1957-58 team's
74.3 figure.
"We didn't keep them off the (foul)
line, did we 9 " asked Cal coach Dick
Kuchen rhetorically. "They're the
best free-throw shooting team in the
conference, and they showed it."
The players that have showed their
accuracy most did so again: Doug
Marty (8 for 8), John Revelli (10 for
12) and Welch (7 for 8). This time,
though, they were joined by freshman
Roger Lemons, who made all seven
free throws he shot as Jones re
placement in the starting lineup. "He
showed more poise than at any time
this season." Dißiaso said

Poise - or rather. Cal s lack of it —
made the difference as Stanford wiped
out the 51-51 tie in a little more than a
minute to assume a 59-51 lead
Lallas 18-foot jumper snapped the
tie with 10 01 to go the 6-foot-2 guard
then gathered in the tip from a jump
ball and ted Marty for a fast-break
layin
After Cal's Michael Chavez and
Sam Potter both missed shots. Welch
drove past Kevin Singleton, surged
over Potter and flipped the ball
toward the hoop much as a child would
flick a yo-vo. Welch's lavup initially
appeared to be short, but gifted with
all that spin, it toppled through as ref
eree Charles Range whistled Potter
for a toul.
Potter disputed Range's call too
vehemently and picked up a technical
foul. Welch sank both the bonus and
technical shots to close Stanford's
eight-point outburst with 8 :50 remain
ing
After Welch's "four-point play."
the Bears never came closer than
four, though they never stopped pro
viding excitement With 1:21 to go and
Stanford leading 75-68, Cal reserve
guard Wes Howell received a techni
cal foul for not checking into the game
properly. A livid Kuchen nearly
picked up another "T" protesting the
call, which was at best dubious, since
players often report in at the sound of
the buzzer.
Eventually Howell was properly
waved in. Soon afterward the Cards
waved goodbv until another winter.

Stanford freshman Roger Lemons goes high in the air to prevent a Cal
pass in the Cards' 81-72 victory last Saturday. Stanford's win over the
Bears made them end up 5-13 in the Pac-10 and 9-18 overall for the year.
The Cardinals' 81-72 victory over
California Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion represented a culmination
for the men s basketball team in more
ways than one.
It fittingly culminated an arduous
but rewarding period of improvement
for the team that began the Pacific-10
Conference season with a 58-56 loss to
the Golden Bears.
It happily culminated four frustra
tion-filled years of service by seniors
Steve Crandell, Peter Lallas and Jeff
Ryan, who endured a string of losing
seasons but can at least salvage a
sweet final memory. Crandell ended
the game and his career by zealously
diving for a loose ball, and the 6-foot-7
Ryan made the most definitive play of
his Cardinal days when he slam
dunked over 6-foot-10 Mark
McNamara on a fast-break.
It impressively culminated a strong
season for co-captain Brian Welch, the
Cards' floor leader and top scorer,
who ravaged Cal for 25 points and nine
rebounds while playing the entire
game.
As usual, it wasn't an easy victory
for Stanford, which ends 1980-81 with a
9-18 overall record and a 5-13 Pac-10
finish, good for a seventh-place tie
with Cal. The Cards led by only one
point at half time, 35-34, and fell into a
51-51 deadlock with the Bears midway
in the second half.
But Stanford parlayed hustle and
accurate free-throw shooting to pre
vail over the Bears, who were foiled in
their attempt to finish with their first
winning season since 1974-75.
A refreshing, heightened spirit
tinged much of the Cards' heroics. "I
thought that there was a great emo

tional effort by our team," Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso said. "They did
something tonight they had to do —
play with enthusiasm and emotion . . .
and they did that very well."
Mature teams have the ability to
win despite the absences of key
players, and the Cards displayed such
maturity against Cal. Starting guard
Keith Jones, a Pac-10 All-Freshman
team selection and a vital part of Stan
ford's offense, missed his second
straight game with a bruise on the big
toe of his left foot.
Forward Orlando Ward, of course,
has been lost for the entire conference
season due to academic woes, and
guard Terry Smith has agonized
through another pain-wracked cam
paign.
But these players and all of Satur
day's starters will return in 1981-82.
Predictably, much of the talk in Stan
ford's jubilant post-game locker room
focused on next season.
"It's good to win to get things
started for next year. I'm excited
about next season already," Welch
said.
"If we can continue this momentum
with a good recruiting year, I think we
can create a lot more enthusiasm and
excitement in Maples Pavilion in
years to come," Dißiaso said. "We
have every right to expect that this
team is going to improve."
The entire scene made one wish that
next season could begin tomorrow.
The fans in the student section were
unusually aroused, throwing uncooked
hot dogs ("weenies" — get it?) at
Cal's band as it performed its custom
ary pre-game march down midcourt
and through the Stanford players dur
ing warm-ups
Even when it wasn't firing frank
furters. the near-sellout assemblage
of 7429 inspired the Cards as Maples
crowds seldom do "The crowd had a
tremendous impact on the way we
played tonight,'' Welch acknowl
edged
What had a tremendous impact on
the final outcome was Stanford's free
throw shooting The Cards, who in sea
sons past would lose close games due
to their shortcomings from the charity
stripe, capped their season-long ex
cellence at the foul line by making 35
one-pointers — a school single-game
record — in 40 attempts. Cal, by con
trast, tried only 15 free-throws and
made 10.
Stanford also established a new
school single-season mark by making
74.7 percent (484 of 648) of their free
throws, eclipsing the 1957-58 team's
74.3 figure.
