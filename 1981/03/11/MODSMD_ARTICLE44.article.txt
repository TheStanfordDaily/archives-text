# Poetic victory over Cal
## Cagers end season 
### Chris Haft 
The Cardinals' 81-72 victory over
California Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion represented a culmination
for the men s basketball team in more
ways than one.
It fittingly culminated an arduous
but rewarding period of improvement
for the team that began the Pacific-10
Conference season with a 58-56 loss to
the Golden Bears.
It happily culminated four frustra
tion-filled years of service by seniors
Steve Crandell, Peter Lallas and Jeff
Ryan, who endured a string of losing
seasons but can at least salvage a
sweet final memory. Crandell ended
the game and his career by zealously
diving for a loose ball, and the 6-foot-7
Ryan made the most definitive play of
his Cardinal days when he slam
dunked over 6-foot-10 Mark
McNamara on a fast-break.
It impressively culminated a strong
season for co-captain Brian Welch, the
Cards' floor leader and top scorer,
who ravaged Cal for 25 points and nine
rebounds while playing the entire
game.
As usual, it wasn't an easy victory
for Stanford, which ends 1980-81 with a
9-18 overall record and a 5-13 Pac-10
finish, good for a seventh-place tie
with Cal. The Cards led by only one
point at half time, 35-34, and fell into a
51-51 deadlock with the Bears midway
in the second half.
But Stanford parlayed hustle and
accurate free-throw shooting to pre
vail over the Bears, who were foiled in
their attempt to finish with their first
winning season since 1974-75.
A refreshing, heightened spirit
tinged much of the Cards' heroics. "I
thought that there was a great emo

tional effort by our team," Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso said. "They did
something tonight they had to do —
play with enthusiasm and emotion . . .
and they did that very well."
Mature teams have the ability to
win despite the absences of key
players, and the Cards displayed such
maturity against Cal. Starting guard
Keith Jones, a Pac-10 All-Freshman
team selection and a vital part of Stan
ford's offense, missed his second
straight game with a bruise on the big
toe of his left foot.
Forward Orlando Ward, of course,
has been lost for the entire conference
season due to academic woes, and
guard Terry Smith has agonized
through another pain-wracked cam
paign.
But these players and all of Satur
day's starters will return in 1981-82.
Predictably, much of the talk in Stan
ford's jubilant post-game locker room
focused on next season.
"It's good to win to get things
started for next year. I'm excited
about next season already," Welch
said.
"If we can continue this momentum
with a good recruiting year, I think we
can create a lot more enthusiasm and
excitement in Maples Pavilion in
years to come," Dißiaso said. "We
have every right to expect that this
team is going to improve."
The entire scene made one wish that
next season could begin tomorrow.
The fans in the student section were
unusually aroused, throwing uncooked
hot dogs ("weenies" — get it?) at
Cal's band as it performed its custom
ary pre-game march down midcourt
and through the Stanford players dur
