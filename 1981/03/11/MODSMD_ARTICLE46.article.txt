## Cards return from bittersweet road trip 
### Dean Eyre 
Berkeley — Stanford's gymnastics teams ended
their respective regular seasons with bittersweet
performances on the road last weekend, leaving the
possibilties for regional and/or national meets still
to be determined, but growing dimmer with the
latest scores.
At Fresno State Friday night, the Cardinal women
outpaced a doggedly determined Bulldog squad,
136.80 to 130.00. While the win kept Stanford's Nor-
Cal record unblemished at 3-0, giving Jackie Walk
er's gymnasts sole possession of first place, the vic
tory came with a price tag. Individually, Karen Hall
was forced out of all-around competition with a sore
knee, limiting her to only two events and jeopardiz
ing her hopes for a solo regional spot. Teamwise, the
lower-than-hoped-for total may have had a similar
effect on the Cards' nationals aspirations.
Before the Fresno meet, coach Walker had con
sidered Fresno State to be scoring in the 126 to 128
point range, with a previous season-high of 129

points. The host squad put it all together to make the
dual meet closer than expected. For her own team,
Walker was looking at high 130's scores and was
aiming for a 140-point-plus team performance Fri
day night. The three or more point difference be
tween that goal and Friday's mark could spell the
difference between travelling to Utah for the AIAWs
and staying at home, depending on what the other
teams in contention accomplish in their final meets.
Stanford's Merilyn Chapman paced the competi
tion as she swept all-around with a 35.30 point total.
Julie Bledsoe earned second place with 33.80, fol
lowed by Fresno's Terry Engstrom at 33.00.
Saturday night in Harmon Gym, the overhead
lights were brighter than during the Stanford-Cali
fornia women's meet two weeks ago. The setting
was quite appropriate as the Golden Bears and indi
viduals from Long Beach City College, Stanford and
San Jose State turned on shining performances to
dazzle another small, appreciative turnout of spec
tators.

Cal lived up to its fifth-place rating in the country,
rolling up 276.70 points to dominate team competi
tion. Long Beach gave plenty of credibility to its
very encouraging prospects in the junior college na
tionals, compiling a healthy 261.05 total.
The Cards took third with 255.60 points in a show
ing that capsulized a season of "only ifs" — marked
by physically "minor" injuries that had more than
minor consequences. San Jose State was fourth with
233.30 points.
It was poetic injustice that the concluding meet of
a season marred by the losses of freshman star Jim
Campanelli with a knee injury and outstanding re
turnee Rich Rosen due to a wrist injury should bring
the gymnasts' health back into discussion.
Cal took the top places in all-around competition,
led by Billy Paul (55.45) and Finn Gjertzen (53.90).
Stanford's Mike Lee was right up there, though, with
a 53.65 score despite his injury, and Brian Nelson hit
a season-high 50.75.
