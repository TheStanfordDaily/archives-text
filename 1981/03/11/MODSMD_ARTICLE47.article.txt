# Aquamen head for NCAA Championships
## 
### David Siminoff 
With the NCAA Swimming and Div
ing Championships just three weeks
away, one would think that the Pac-10
Championships, only a prelude to the
big event, would cause little more
than a whit of excitement. Such was
not the case last weekend in East Los
Angeles as swimmers representing
each of the ten universities from the
Pacific Coast Conference "paddled it
out" for the championship.
While the meet was won by Cal's
Golden Bears, the Stanford Card-
Aquamen achieved a victory in their
own right. They finished in third place
upsetting both Arizona and Arizona
State, both of whom had beaten the
Cards during the dual meet season.
Stanford finished with 273 points, Ari-

zona State 270, and Arizona 264. Pow
erhouse Cal scored 351 points with
their victorious effort, to UCLA's 328.
While the main goal for teams en
tering the Pac-10 Championships is to
win, there is a secondary goal as well
which is to qualify as many swimmers
as possible for the infinitely more im
portant NCAA Championships. In this
area Stanford did phenomenally well.
Going into the meet the Cards had
qualified only three swimmers. On the
flight home, fifteen Cardinals had
booked births in Austin, Texas, site of
this year's Championship meet.
Stanford's success was based on
many outstanding individual per
formances, demonstrating the Card's
balance in strength. Stanford's most
exciting achievement was in Team
Captain Monte Brown's meet-record

breaking 15:05.1 performance in the
1650 yd. freestyle. Stanford
backstroker Wade Flemons, con
sistently great, won the 100 yd. back in
50.44, beating some of the nation's
best. Junior Joe Jiminez stroked to
third place in the 100 breaststroke in
55.77 as Freshman Mark Macael
placed fourth in the 100 yd. fly in a life
time best of 49.08 and finished fifth in
the 200 yd. I.M. in 1:51.77. Freshmen
Charlie Johnson and Dan Coran placed
third and fifth respectively in the 200
yd. fly. The positive results go on and
on.
Coach Skip Kenney felt that "we
had a good meet and swam well. Next
year, we'll be in a position to win the
Conference Championship, and with a
good recruiting year we will improve

upon this year's outstanding per
formance and possibly go ail the
way."
Stanford's third place finish was
particularly pleasing to Coach Kenney
as the Cards, who were previously
qualified for the NCAAs, went into the
meet not peaked for a top per
formance. Notably, Bari Weick and
Dave Sims who have swam up to na
tional championship caliber during
the season found it difficult to com
pete with other schools' best distance
freestylers who had peaked for the
meet. Bari and Dave, along with the
rest of the Card-Aquamen will head
for the NCAA Championships March
26-28 where Stanford, with its superb
efforts at the Pac-10 Championships,
is all but guaranteed success.
