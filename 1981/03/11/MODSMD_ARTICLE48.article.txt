# Women netters smash UOP

Stanford men's tennis coach Dick Gould put it best
when he described the 1981 women's team after their
match with UOP last Friday. "Those gals are
dynamite," he said. "Just dynamite."
Indeed, few could argue with him as the Cards had
just exploded past Pacific 8-1 for their fourth straight
victory.
"We had some better scores than last year," com
mented women's coach Frank Brennan, "so it was a
worthwhile match from that standpoint. They all
played pretty well."
Sparking the Cardinals was Susie Barbe, "who
played the best match of her career," according to
Brennan. The sophomore racked up her second win of
the year, bombarding Don O'Rourke at number five
singles. After winning the first set handily, 6-3, Barbe
fell behind in the second, 4-to-5, before regaining her in
tensity and taking the next three games and the match.
"It was fun," said Barbe of her straight set victory.
"I just started laxing off in the second set, but I came
back. I knew I was going to win. It just took awhile."
While Barbe was mowing down O'Rourke, her team
mates were doing likewise. Gayle Chan continued to
show signs of steady improvement, streaking by UOP's
Annette Ward, three and one. "It's a combination of
things," said Chan in reference to her strong and ag
gressive play thus far this season. "The main thing is
confidence. I'm more settled with my stroke. I'm not as
nervous even though I still put pressure on myself to do
my best."

Sophomore Judy Jordan is another Cardinal who is
playing well and she convinced UOP's Karen Hedlund
of the fact, waltzing past her at number six singles,
three and two. "Things are going well," Jordan veri
fied. "I feel faster due to all of the running drills we
have been doing. I think that I've really got the com
petitive edge back. "
Singles weren't the only place where the Cards were
sizzling. Stanford's number one tandem of Rubin and
Michelle Weiss were as hot as the late afternoon sun
that prevailed over the Varsity Courts, teaming up for a
one and zero victory at number one doubles.
"We played real well," said Weiss. We've really got
our act together. I'm really psyched."
The Cardinals had better be psyched when the eighth
ranked California Bears invade Stanford Tennis Stadi
um tomorrow, in a match which will allow Brennan to
employ his full line-up for the first time
The match with the Bears was originally scheduled
for February 24, but was postponed due to heavy rain
fall. Brennan is excited about the possible conse
quences of having his team finally tested against some
top-flight competition. "The girls will be ready," he
said. "They have been looking forward to it. Cal has a
good team." Action will start at 1:30p m
