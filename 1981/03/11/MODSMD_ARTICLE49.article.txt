# John Kosner: a look at the NCAA's
## 
### 
Question What do North
eastern, Mercer, and Long Is
land Universities all have that
Marquette, Syracuse, and Min
nesota do not?
Answer: Invitations to this
month's NCAA basketball
playoffs.
Why is it that the cham
pionship tournament of college
basketball includes such inex
plicable entries as Howard, Ball
State, James (Dolly?) Madison,
and Tennessee-Chattanooga
(not to mention the above three
teams) ? Only the powers that be
in this case — Big Ten Com
missioner Wayne Duke, his
NCAA selection committee, and
the ballyhooed NCAA computer
— can come close to offering a
proper response.
For some reason, Duke et al
have deemed it fit to invite
almost every conference cham
pion (no matter how pathetic

the league) and have all but bent
over backwards in honoring the
results of those idiotic post-sea
son conference tournaments,
(LSU, for instance, won the SEC
title easily with a 17-1 mark, yet
was still forced to play in the
SEC tournament). The end re
sult of the NCAA selection com
mittee's work is a tourney draw
that is long on "regional bal
ance' and representation, and
oh so short on common sense.
"We don't have the best 48
teams in the country," Duke ad
mitted last Sunday. And why
not, Wayne? If the system is stu
pid, then why not change it?
Why schedule the West Re
gional at Pauley Pavillion and
then send UCLA to play in Prov
ldence, R. 1.? Why pick
Charlotte, N.C. as a site for the
East Regionals and then jet
North Carolina off to El Paso?
Why award the ECAC three
precious berths when none of

the top Eastern teams — save
uninvited Old Dominion (the
lone conqueror of DePaul) —
play in the ECAC divisions 9
Why place Kansas State, How
ard, Illinois, Northeastern. Pitt,
and North Carolina in the West
bracket or BYU, UCLA, Notre
Dame, and Houston in the East?
All of which begs the ques
tion, who's going to win the
whole thing? And, for the second
time in three weeks, I must con
fess I'm not sure. Give me an
eight-team field or, better still,
the final four and I can pick the
eventual winner with con
fidence. But with the balance of
power in college basketball
these days (the nation's top five
teams — DePaul, Oregon State,
LSU, Virginia, and Arizona
State — are all just about even),
predicting the NCAA Champion
before the tournament has even
begun borders on the foolish.
Still not satisfied? Okay, if I

had to pick one team it would be
DePaul, but only because that's

Question What do North
eastern, Mercer, and Long Is
land Universities all have that
Marquette, Syracuse, and Min
nesota do not?
Answer: Invitations to this
month's NCAA basketball
playoffs.
Why is it that the cham
pionship tournament of college
basketball includes such inex
plicable entries as Howard, Ball
State, James (Dolly?) Madison,
and Tennessee-Chattanooga
(not to mention the above three
teams) ? Only the powers that be
in this case — Big Ten Com
missioner Wayne Duke, his
NCAA selection committee, and
the ballyhooed NCAA computer
— can come close to offering a
proper response.
For some reason, Duke et al
have deemed it fit to invite
almost every conference cham
pion (no matter how pathetic

the league) and have all but bent
over backwards in honoring the
results of those idiotic post-sea
son conference tournaments,
(LSU, for instance, won the SEC
title easily with a 17-1 mark, yet
was still forced to play in the
SEC tournament). The end re
sult of the NCAA selection com
mittee's work is a tourney draw
that is long on "regional bal
ance' and representation, and
oh so short on common sense.
"We don't have the best 48
teams in the country," Duke ad
mitted last Sunday. And why
not, Wayne? If the system is stu
pid, then why not change it?
Why schedule the West Re
gional at Pauley Pavillion and
then send UCLA to play in Prov
ldence, R. 1.? Why pick
Charlotte, N.C. as a site for the
East Regionals and then jet
North Carolina off to El Paso?
Why award the ECAC three
precious berths when none of

the top Eastern teams — save
uninvited Old Dominion (the
lone conqueror of DePaul) —
play in the ECAC divisions 9
Why place Kansas State, How
ard, Illinois, Northeastern. Pitt,
and North Carolina in the West
bracket or BYU, UCLA, Notre
Dame, and Houston in the East?
All of which begs the ques
tion, who's going to win the
whole thing? And, for the second
time in three weeks, I must con
fess I'm not sure. Give me an
eight-team field or, better still,
the final four and I can pick the
eventual winner with con
fidence. But with the balance of
power in college basketball
these days (the nation's top five
teams — DePaul, Oregon State,

ey or yours: Arizona State (24-3,
No. 5) Important home court
edge: LSU, providing the
Bengals take care of the Lamar-
Missouri winner \otes: ASU's
starting five is solid-pro materi
al and when the Sun Devils play
to form they are frightening
LSU has much better scoring
balance this year and might be
able to take care of Louisville
this time around (the Cards
blasted LSU out of the tour
nament a year ago ) The Cards
better not look past Arkansas
though lowa (21-6, No. 12) is
plenty rugged, but may not be
quick enough to deal with high
flyin' Wichita State If you want
a key to this regional, it's proba
bly ASU seven footer Alton
Lister. If he comes to play you
know who's going to Philly for
the finals.
MIDEAST REGIONAL (Finals
in Bloomington, Ind., March
20-22) "On paper" ( hump: De-
Paul (26-1, No. 1) Itarkhouse:
Wake Forest (22-6, No 14) For

portant home court edpe: Indi
ana, providing the Hoosiers take
care of Maryland.
\otes: This is the best regional
by far DePaul, Kentucky, and
Wake Forest are all loaded,
Maryland is an underdog, and
Bobby Knight's Indiana team is
in the enviable situation of
playing its biggest games at
home (if, of course, IU can get
by the Terps). DePaul is really
going to be put to the test. The
Blue Demons are strong enough
to get by Indiana, but Kentucky
might be a different story. The
Wildcats (led by Sam Bowie
among others) have more talent
than some pro teams and yet
sport an awfully low profile.
That could change very soon. ,
