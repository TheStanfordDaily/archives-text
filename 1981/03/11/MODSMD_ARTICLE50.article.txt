Stanford's men's tennis team closed out its win
ter quarter schedule yesterday with an 8-1 victory
over San Jose State that wasn't as close as it
sounds. Ending their pre-Pacific-10 schedule at
5-0, the Cards will have no more weak sisters and
junior colleges on which to tune up.
The Cards devastated their host in singles, tak
ing all 12 sets. Once again, Jim Gurfein led the
charge. The New York sophomore whitewashed
John Saviano 6-0,6-0 in No. 3 singles. He has yet to
give up more than four games in a dual match.
"Jimmy Gurfein continued to be very im
pressive," coach Dick Gould said. "We blew them
out in singles and I think that affected us a little
bit, because we let up in doubles. "
Did it ever. Stanford even lost a match, by gosh.
Gurfein and Tim Mayotte dropped No. 1 doubles
5-7, 7-5, 7-6 to Rich Carlson and Jeff Everist. How
ever, the other two teams, Scott Bondurant and
Scott Davis and Jeff Arons and Mark McKeen,
won in straight sets.
At the beginning of the season, Gould's biggest
worry was what would become of the doubles. He
was plenty short-handed, or rather short-fore
handed. With David Siegler dropping from the

team, he was also short his best returning tore
hand-court player.
But now, Gould is a bit more confident. "The
first two teams (Mayotte-Gurfein and Davis-
Bondurant) will stay that way, in some order.
Both are pretty solid doubles teams. The things
they are not doing right are mechanical They can
be corrected."
The No. 3 doubles team will have Arons playing
Rhett Butler, while Gould searches from among
several players for his Scarlett. "Jeff Arons will
be in there somewhere, and it's just a question of
who complements him best," Gould said.
"I'm very pleased with our progress. I like the
character of this team," Gould said. With their
next three matches on the road against Arizona,
Arizona State and Cal, they'll need more than
character.
