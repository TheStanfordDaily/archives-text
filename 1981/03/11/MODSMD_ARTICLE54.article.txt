# Golfers take eighth at Murietta
## 
### Marty Yee 
The performance of the Stanford men's golt
team at the Rancho Murietta Invitational in Sac
ramento could easily be miscontrued as " lack
luster," "disappointing." or even typical of Stan
ford golf the last couple of years However, if one
looks beneath the surface at the tournament,
where the Cards finished eighth out of 14 teams, it
is clear that the team's performance indicates
none of these things
Only two of the top five Stanford golfers, David
Games and Jack Skilling, participated in the tour
nament, which included such West Coast pow
erhouses as Fresno State (the winner), San Jose
State. University of Pacific, and Cal-State
Stanislaus.
More than anything else, the tournament was
an example of the philosophy coach David Yates
applies to his team. "We had our top six players
just coming off a major tournament (the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate at Ontario), and if they had
played in this tournament, they would really have
been behind the eight-ball as far as studies are
concerned," says Yates.
Along with providing a chance for some of his
players to concentrate on academics, Rancho
Murietta also helped accomplish another of Yates
objectives, more team participation. "I just want
to give college kids a chance to play collegiate
golf. We may not do as well as we could in some
tournaments, simply because we don't play our

top five day in and day out.
And if the top five were present in Sacramento?
"If we had brought our top players,' says Yates,
"the tournament would have been between
Fresno, SJS, UOP, and us."
Low scorer for Stanford was promising
sophomore Murray Stoltz (230), followed by
steady veteran Doug Clarke (237), Games (238),
Skilling (240), and sophomores Pat English and
John Scanlon. both at 242.
Skilling and Games, normally two of the Cards'
top players, are both trying to sharpen their
strokes before the series of crucial tournaments
coming up in the next several weeks. Skilling is
making major adjustments in his stroke and
Games is coming off a bad hand injury.
If these two players regain their form, and if
freshman sensation Tim Robinson comes back
from serious back problems, the Cards should
have a great season in store.
The Stanford women, meanwhile, will compete
in a NorCal Conference match tomorrow in San
Jose. Two-time U.S. Public Links champion Lori
Castillo, incredible sophomore Joanne Pacillo,
and seasoned veteran Linda Bowman lead the
Cards against Sacramento State, and San Jose
State, which boasts highly regarded Juli Inkster.
The one-day tournament is the last before a much
needed two week break for the talented Cardinal
women.
