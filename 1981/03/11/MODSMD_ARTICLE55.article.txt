# University's shop 'sure beats problem sets'
## Machines, noise and oil 
### Richard Ross 
In the shadow of the Univer
sity's Hoover Tower, where
some of Stanford's great minds
silently absorb, analyze and ap
ply ideas, there is a place of real
industry, of machines, noise and
oil.
For 12 hours a day students
and faculty alike labor with
lathes, saws, grinders, snip
pers, millers and cutters to
make all kinds of tangible
goods. The place is the Stanford
machine shop.
The machine shop, which
smells of high-grade oil and
looks like a picture-perfect dis
play of good old American ma
chinery at a world's fair, is used
primarily by students in the Me
chanical Engineering Dept.
Other students are, however,
welcome to use the facility. Stu
dents are required only to
purchase a $30 machine permit

which entitles them to un
limited use of the equipment.
The scene at the shop is a
study in concentration.
Crouched over their machines,
students intently manipulate
dials and gauges. And since
safety glasses are worn by all,
the shop takes on a certain in
dustrial' character

Students describe Beech as the 'Pied Piper'
of the machine shop because there's always
a trail of puzzled would-be machinists
following him.

There are all kinds of projects
in progress at any given time.
One student is building a light
weight aluminum bike rack
while another is working on a
bright brass dart. In another
area students are casting
bronze goblets and sundials
while someoi.e elsfe fashions a
piece of esoteric sculpture from
the same material. Still another
student toils over a fly-tying de
vice that will help him wind five
threads and colorful feathers
onto tiny hooks for fly fishing.
Next to him works a more utili
ty-minded student making a
computer chasis for the Com
puter Science Dept.
While students snip, drill,
mill and cut, Dave Beech, the
shop's "teaching specialist,"
makes sure everyone stays in
production. Students describe
Beech as the "Pied Piper" of
the machne shop because
there's always a trail of puzzled
would-be machinists following
him, waiting to ask him for ad
vice.
At one point. Beech lined up a
piece of shiny gold metal, ad
justed a cutting blade and said
to his pupil, "this material usu
ally cuts like butter, unless it's

been messed up in the de
gasification process." The stu
dent nodded apreciatively and
set the machine to work One
student said, "Beech makes the
course, he's got more energy
than anybody on campus. "
Most of the student machin
ists in the shop are either veter
ans of, or enrolled in, Mechani-

cal Engineering 103. Said Cheryl
Germany, a junior in the M.E.
department. "I feel like I'm
learning something I can really
use. It also beats the heck out of
problem sets!"
Dave Laybourn, a senior me
chanical engineering major, ex
plained. as he fit drill bits into
what he called a "cullet" on a
machine, that M.E. 103 helped
him in his summer job at Spec
traphysics Corp. Layburn said
that he used skills he acquired in
class when he analyzed com
plicated drawings of equipment
to determine whether they were
feasible for production! Said
Laybourn: "I was able to tell if,
and how (the equipment) could
be made."
Another student working on a
plexiglass form of a bike-hold
ing clamp similar to those used
in bike shops said about the
course, "it's too bad that only
m.e.'s can take it."
So, the non-engineers will
have to be satisfied with store
bought fly-tying devices and
bike racks. Somewhere, even
goblets and sundials of bronze
can be procured — for a price.

At one point. Beech lined up a
piece of shiny gold metal, ad
justed a cutting blade and said
to his pupil, "this material usu
ally cuts like butter, unless it's

been messed up in the de
gasification process." The stu
dent nodded apreciatively and
set the machine to work One
student said, "Beech makes the
course, he's got more energy
than anybody on campus. "
Most of the student machin
ists in the shop are either veter
ans of, or enrolled in, Mechani-

cal Engineering 103. Said Cheryl
Germany, a junior in the M.E.
department. "I feel like I'm
learning something I can really
use. It also beats the heck out of
problem sets!"
Dave Laybourn, a senior me
chanical engineering major, ex
plained. as he fit drill bits into
what he called a "cullet" on a
machine, that M.E. 103 helped
him in his summer job at Spec
traphysics Corp. Layburn said
that he used skills he acquired in
class when he analyzed com
plicated drawings of equipment
to determine whether they were
feasible for production! Said
Laybourn: "I was able to tell if,
and how (the equipment) could
be made."
Another student working on a
plexiglass form of a bike-hold
ing clamp similar to those used
in bike shops said about the
course, "it's too bad that only
m.e.'s can take it."
So, the non-engineers will
have to be satisfied with store
bought fly-tying devices and
bike racks. Somewhere, even
goblets and sundials of bronze
can be procured — for a price.

Vt the machine shop, students work on a variety of projects, under
he direction of Dave Beech, the shop's 'teaching specialist.'
In the shadow of the Univer
sity's Hoover Tower, where
some of Stanford's great minds
silently absorb, analyze and ap
ply ideas, there is a place of real
industry, of machines, noise and
oil.
For 12 hours a day students
and faculty alike labor with
lathes, saws, grinders, snip
pers, millers and cutters to
make all kinds of tangible
goods. The place is the Stanford
machine shop.
The machine shop, which
smells of high-grade oil and
looks like a picture-perfect dis
play of good old American ma
chinery at a world's fair, is used
primarily by students in the Me
chanical Engineering Dept.
Other students are, however,
welcome to use the facility. Stu
dents are required only to
purchase a $30 machine permit

which entitles them to un
limited use of the equipment.
The scene at the shop is a
study in concentration.
Crouched over their machines,
students intently manipulate
dials and gauges. And since
safety glasses are worn by all,
the shop takes on a certain in
dustrial' character

Students describe Beech as the 'Pied Piper'
of the machine shop because there's always
a trail of puzzled would-be machinists
following him.

There are all kinds of projects
in progress at any given time.
One student is building a light
weight aluminum bike rack
while another is working on a
bright brass dart. In another
area students are casting
bronze goblets and sundials
while someoi.e elsfe fashions a
piece of esoteric sculpture from
the same material. Still another
student toils over a fly-tying de
vice that will help him wind five
threads and colorful feathers
onto tiny hooks for fly fishing.
Next to him works a more utili
ty-minded student making a
computer chasis for the Com
puter Science Dept.
While students snip, drill,
mill and cut, Dave Beech, the
shop's "teaching specialist,"
makes sure everyone stays in
production. Students describe
Beech as the "Pied Piper" of
the machne shop because
there's always a trail of puzzled
would-be machinists following
him, waiting to ask him for ad
vice.
At one point. Beech lined up a
piece of shiny gold metal, ad
justed a cutting blade and said

ally cuts like butter, unless it's
