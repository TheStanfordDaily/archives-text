# Analyzing the 'ludicrous'
## 
### Denny Dart 
Is the difference between Art
Buchwald and Doonesbury
more than that between roast
beef and quiche? In Prof. Alan
Pont's sophomore seminar,
"20th Century Humor," stu
dents consider this question and
others.
For instance, what makes a
comedian influential? Why are
some time periods better for hu
mor than others? Can politi
cians get away with being fun
ny? Will the Reagans provide
more material for comedians
than the Carters?
In treating these questions,
Pont divides the course into sev
eral categories of humor: ur
ban, household, political, and
Woody Allen. "Woody Allen is a
whole category in himself,"
Pont explained.
The class reads 10 books dur
ing the quarter, and the read
ings are emphasized rather than
movies or recordings. "The
class reads primary works in
stead of analyses/' said Pont.
"Most analyses aren't that good
— just ludicrous people holding
ludicrous theories about the lu
dicrous."
Pont, who teaches human
physiology, laboratory
diagnosis, and clinical en
docrinology, volunteered to
teach the class because he is es
pecially interested in humor. "I
enjoy this class; I don't teach it
for the money," he said.

There is a lively camaraderie
in the class, and the students ob
viously enjoy the discussions.
One member offered the follow
ing description of Pont: "He's
funny. He smokes a pipe and

i Comedians could joke about Ford because
he wasn't vulnerable — everyone just
figured he was too dumb to get the joke.
— Professor Alan Pont

sometimfes brings his dog to
class."
When asked what he likes
most about the course, the stu
dent said he enjoys the writing
assignments. "We write four
papers which can be our own hu
mor if we want — there have
been some good attempts," he
said.
In a recent class session, par
ticipants discussed political hu
mor and how it has changed.
Pont said, "A lot of humor today
is 'cerebral' — comedians like
Mort Sahl and Woody Allen who
talk with an IQ of more than
100." In contrast, he said, "Will
Rogers was one of the boys."
Pont explained how some pe
riods are better for political hu
mor than others. "The '60s and
early 70s were a good time," he
said. President Richard Nixon
and Vietnam provided good ma
terial, and President Gerald

Ford was easy to joke about
also. According to Pont, "he
couldn't walk and chew gum at
the same time."
In Pont's opinion, the Carter
years were poor years for politi-

cal humor. He said the Carter
family began as great material
— the southern accent, brother
Billy and Miss Lillian, Jimmy's
Playboy interview — but that
Carter was not funny in the end.
He became too vulnerable and
the comedians backed off, Pont
said.
The class considered Rea
gan's humorous potential and
concluded that, "his age will be
a joke." The students agreed
that Nancy provides good mate
rial with her expensive ward
robe, her plans to redecorate,
and her 'socialite' personality.
The coming years' humor will
all depend on how Ronald and
Nancy take it now, concluded
the class. "If they become vul
nerable, the comedians will pull
back," said Pont. "But as long
as Reagan stays strong and pop
ular, we're in for some good po
litical humor."
