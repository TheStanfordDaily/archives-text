# Anthro sends students world-wide
## 
### Diane Johnson 
A special program sponsored by the
Anthropology Dept. allows students to
participate in a self-designed, all-ex
pense-paid summer research project in
any area of the world.
The program, currently in its second
year, is open to students from any de
partment, although they are encouraged
to take some anthropology classes. The
only requirement is that the student
choose an advisor from the Anthropology
Dept. to help structure his or her individ
ual research proposal.
The proposals, which were due in Feb
ruary, are then reviewed by a selection
committee comprised of one student and
three professors. The committee con
siders the academic merit of each topic,
the practicality of each, and the eligibili
; ty of each student as far as anthropology
background.
This year, four students, all juniors,
; have applied and are being reviewed for
this summer. The final grant recipients
will be announced within the next few
days according to Gigi Weix, a member
: of the selection committee and a 1980
summer participant.
Once selected, the student must enroll
in a five-unit spring quarter pre-field
work seminar to learn basic field tech
niques. This seminar covers methods of
observation, notetaking, anthropological
!► theory, casual and in-depth interviewing
and general exercises to help focus the
individual's project.
Also required is a five-unit fall post
. fieldwork seminar in which the student?

analyze and write a 30 to 50 page paper on
their summer experience. Notes, pic
tures, research data, tapes and other col
lected material are put into use during
this seminar.
Last year, four out of seven applicants
were chosen for this project. Their indi
vidual proposals included the following:
study of linguistic patterns on the Isle of
Man; research of a breast-feeding con
troversy in Honduras; examination of
migration patterns and social effects in
Spain; and comparing herbal and
Western medicine practice in Chi
natown.
Weix, 3 senior anthropology major
sees the experience as "a unique op
portunity to design and work on your own
research rather than someone elses. It
trained me to be independent and
strengthened my commitment to doing
research, giving me a feel for the com
plexities and issues of doing an
thropology studies.

"I now plan on going to graduate
school in anthropology, after one year off
— definitely a product of the fieldwork.
"It requires a great deal of maturity to
undergo a project like this. I'd really like
to see more students developing projects
and submitting them for selection. I
learned much more about myself and my
academic goals than I ever could work
ing in my hometown."
Jean Mullenax, a junior human
biology major, studied the interaction
between Spanish villagers and migrants
in relation to the rural migration trend.
After living on a farm in a 400 person vil

lage for 2V2 months, she commented,
"Along with the intellectual experience,
it was a time of great personal growth.
Living with a family as their fourth
daughter forced me to deal with the
same problems they themselves face.
Those people will now be life-long
friends.
"It's such a feeling of accomplishment
to write a proposal and actually carry it
out all on your own. The education we «
often get is a passive thing — it is given to
us and we just take it in. We are handed
results of research without knowing how
it was reached.
"But the anthropology project was a
real active educational experience. I my
self went through the task of doing the re
search and arriving at the conclusions.
"I never felt my education so far here
had been something I was being creative :
with. But this was an opportunity to work
all on my own — and creativity was a ne
cessity."
The project was funded last year by
the Anthropology Dept. and this year by
the William and Flora Hewlett Founda
tion. A search is presently underway to
establish permanent funding.
"Unfortunately," said Assistant Prof.
Gilbert Herdt, "the department can't af
ford to finance the program out of its own
funds. We'd hate to see the program end.
We believe it's terribly worthwhile — a
program like this offers a unique op
portunity which benefits both the depart
ment and students."

it was a time of great personal growth.

"It's such a feeling of accomplishment
to write a proposal and actually carry it
out all on your own. The education we «
often get is a passive thing — it is given to
us and we just take it in. We are handed
results of research without knowing how
it was reached.
"But the anthropology project was a
real active educational experience. I my
self went through the task of doing the re
search and arriving at the conclusions.
"I never felt my education so far here
had been something I was being creative :
with. But this was an opportunity to work
all on my own — and creativity was a ne
cessity."
The project was funded last year by
the Anthropology Dept. and this year by
the William and Flora Hewlett Founda
tion. A search is presently underway to
establish permanent funding.
"Unfortunately," said Assistant Prof.
Gilbert Herdt, "the department can't af
ford to finance the program out of its own
funds. We'd hate to see the program end.
We believe it's terribly worthwhile — a
program like this offers a unique op
portunity which benefits both the depart
ment and students."
A special program sponsored by the
Anthropology Dept. allows students to
participate in a self-designed, all-ex
pense-paid summer research project in
any area of the world.
The program, currently in its second
year, is open to students from any de
partment, although they are encouraged
to take some anthropology classes. The
only requirement is that the student
choose an advisor from the Anthropology
Dept. to help structure his or her individ
ual research proposal.
The proposals, which were due in Feb
ruary, are then reviewed by a selection
committee comprised of one student and
three professors. The committee con
siders the academic merit of each topic,
the practicality of each, and the eligibili
; ty of each student as far as anthropology
background.
This year, four students, all juniors,
; have applied and are being reviewed for
this summer. The final grant recipients
will be announced within the next few
days according to Gigi Weix, a member
: of the selection committee and a 1980
summer participant.
Once selected, the student must enroll
in a five-unit spring quarter pre-field
work seminar to learn basic field tech
niques. This seminar covers methods of
observation, notetaking, anthropological
!► theory, casual and in-depth interviewing
and general exercises to help focus the
individual's project.
Also required is a five-unit fall post
. fieldwork seminar in which the student?

analyze and write a 30 to 50 page paper on
their summer experience. Notes, pic
tures, research data, tapes and other col
lected material are put into use during
this seminar.
Last year, four out of seven applicants
were chosen for this project. Their indi
vidual proposals included the following:
study of linguistic patterns on the Isle of
Man; research of a breast-feeding con
troversy in Honduras; examination of
migration patterns and social effects in
Spain; and comparing herbal and
Western medicine practice in Chi
natown.
Weix, 3 senior anthropology major
sees the experience as "a unique op
portunity to design and work on your own
research rather than someone elses. It
trained me to be independent and
strengthened my commitment to doing
research, giving me a feel for the com
plexities and issues of doing an
thropology studies.
