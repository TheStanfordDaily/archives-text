# Heart-lung transplantee lives
## 
### Jan Mireles 
The first combined heart-lung
transplant patient in 10 years has sur
vived the critical 24-hour period fol
lowing surgery and is now breathing
without the aid of a respirator.
Mary Gohlke. a Mesa, Arizona resi
dent suffering from pulmonary hyper
tension, underwent surgery early
Monday at the University Medical

Center Drs Bruce Reitz and Norman
Shumway led the team of surgeons
who performed the surgery, which
lasted four hours.
Yesterday Gohlke was able to sit up
in bed and visit with her mother, hus
band Karl and eldest son Christopher
She was reported in good spirits, "but
a bit tired."
Gohlke, 45, and her mother, Bea

Martin, flew to Stanford several
weeks ago in order to be close to the
hospital and await a donor
An advertising director with a chain
newspaper in Mesa. Gohlke was first
diagnosed as suffering from
pulmonary hypertension in February,
1980 Her condition deteriorated
rapidly and by March of that year she
worked only four hours a day Without
surgery, doctors gave Gohlke one to
six months to live.
Gohlke became a candidate for
surgery because of the nature of
pulmonary hypertension-the disease
had destroyed her lungs and severely
damaged her heart Shumway said
Gohlke realized the risks involved, but
still wanted the surgery performed
"She was very positive going into
the operation We couldn't have had a
more informed patient,"said
Shumway.
Shumway stressed that Gohlke was
accepted as a patient because there
was "no other medical surgery avail
able.''
After arriving at Stanford, Gohlke
and her mother still had no idea when
a donor might become available Fin
ding a donor who matches a patient's
blood type is difficult, and doctors
must also find a donor whose heart and
lungs have not deteriorated.
"So many donors have been dead for
as much as a week Lung deterioration
ru\es out their being used as a donor.
Condition of the lungs is much more
important than time," Shumway ex
plained.
A donor from San Diego became
available and the operation was per
formed 48 hours later.
The operation is unique because it
involves the use of a new drug called
Cyclosporin A Human heart-lung
transplants received University ap
proval last Jan 23, during the Medical
School's Committee for the Protection
of Human Subjects in Research meet
ing. Following University approval
surgeons had to wait for FDA ap
proval on the use of Cyclosporin A as
recovery treatment.
Previously, success with trans
planted lungs has been slow because of
the time it takes for the windpipe se
vered in surgery to heal. Drugs once
used to combat rejection of the trans
plant slowed the healing process and
increased the risk of infection.
Cyclosporin A inhibits body rejection
of the new tissue, but allows the body
to heal and thus limit the chances of in
fection, air leakage or bleeding in the
tracheal tubes.
