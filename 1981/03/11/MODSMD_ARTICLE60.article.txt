# Mexico's technological future
## 
### Teresa Butzerin 
In Mexico, modern technolo
gy must be assimilated along
with an entire spectrum of so
cial and political change, ac
cording to Amando Flores, Di
rector of Mexico's National
Committee for Science and
Technology (NCST).
Flores, who addressed a
crowd of about 70 in CERAS last
Friday, spoke on American ex
change of technology with Mexi
co and barriers to progress
posed by the Mexican culture.
"Within the developing coun
tries, it is the English-speaking
ones that will develop the
fastest," Flores said. The
Spanish language is still un
adapted to most modem techni
cal lingo, according to Flores,
who called English the "Latin of
the technical age."
As head of NCST, Flores
directs the scholarships
awarded by the organization to
8000 Mexican students enrolled
in foreign universities. About
half of these students are atten
ding schools in the United
States. The rest receive training
in various developed countries
such as Japan and Israel.
The role of the United States
in the technical evolution of
Mexico is crucial, but Flores
said he was wary of becoming
too dependent on a single out
side influence.
Flores stressed the im
portance of diversifying techno
logical resources. Although
much could be gained from un

derstanding and exchanging
U.S. technological know-how,
Flores said, Mexico should keep
an independent perspective.
"We must learn from the U.S.
but also look critically at its so
cialization to decide what may
or may not be the best course for
Mexico," Flores said.
Responsibilities of the NCST
are similar to those of the
American Association for the
Advancement of Sciences and
the National Science Founda
tion. Besides awarding scholar
ships, the council serves as a
means of be
tween the government and sci
entific communities.
The council's formation ten
years ago, Flores said, demon
strates the Mexican govern
ment's relatively recent re

alization of the country's need
for an organized plan for techno
logical modernization.
For 30 years before 1970, only
about 80,000 Mexican students
were able to obtain foreign
education Since the NCST was
formed the number of Mexican
students abroad has more than
doubled.
Flores sees the advantage of a
foreign education as the ability
to adjust to and work in a regi
mented and competitive en
vironment. A more rigorous ac
ademic atmosphere, as well as
more advanced degrees, are
provided at foreign universities.
Such opportunities expose Mexi
can students to scientific
thought and an approach to
technical problem solving.
