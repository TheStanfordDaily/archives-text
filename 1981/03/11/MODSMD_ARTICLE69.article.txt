## 'Cage Aux Folles II': the transvestite follies go thriller 
### Steve Vineberg 
La Cnfjc aux Folles was
phenomenally successful in
France, and in this country it
made more money than any oth
er toreign film ever has, so the
appearance of a sequel — under
the witty title La Cage aux
Folic.s II — is not a surprise.
Michel Serrault (Albin. the star
of the nightclub drag show) and
Ugo Tognazzi i Renato, his lover
and and the nightclub owner)
are such an uproarious
vaudeville act that they could
very likely inspire a series of
modest comedies — they might
almost be a weird Abbott and
Costello for the eighties. (The
tacky direction and plastic look
of the first Caije aux Folles did
not detract from the pleasure
one received from watching it:
one's enjoyment arose from the
quality of the writing and the
performances, particularly Ser
rault's.) But La Catfe aux Folles
II is mostly pedestrian and tedi
ous.
The writers. Francis Veber.
Jean Poiret and Marcello
Danon, have furnished a spy
plot to hang the antics of the two
stars on. In order to prove to Re
nato that he is still seductive.
Albin makes himself up as a
woman and hangs out at a cafe,
sipping creme de menthe and
ogling all the passing men. The
one who finally accosts him.
however, is a secret agent in the
midst of a chase; using Albin as
a blind, he trots him off to a ho
tel, slips a roll of microfilm into
his pocket, and is summarily
dispatched by a cyanide dart.
The rest of the picture is con
cerned with the attempts of a
quartet of French spies (led by
Marcel Bozzufi) to recover the

microfilm and capture the for
eign agents who are also trying
to obtain it — and our heroes,
caught in the middle, first act as
decoys and then escape to Italy,
where they hide out trom both
sets of agents.
It isn't a tresh plot, and it is
full of implausible turns, but the
film would be less ponderous if
the director. Edouard Molinaro,
had a more deft touch for car
chases and shoot-outs (since
they are inevitably present in
this sort ot picture) or if he and
the writers had provided Ser
rault and Tognazzi with a tew
sparkling routines that might
have shoved the dumb story line
into the background But the
good sequences — most of which
involve Albin posing as Re
nato's wife in the Italian village
where his family lives and being
consigned to cooking, sewing,
washing floors and working on
the harvest like the other wom
en — are too brief and appear
only in the last third of the pic
ture. Serrault and Tognazzi are
in good form but they have little
to play and too many obstacles
to play against.
The surprise in La Catfe aux
Folles II is how soft-headed the
movie turns out to be. There is
an embarassing moment in the
first half when Renato, realiz
ing that Albin has placed
himself >n physical danger by
agreeing to be used as a decoy,
sheds a silent tear in an aside to
the camera; we would happily
dismiss it from our minds if this
kind of sentimentality did not
recur in the final moments, in a
reconciliation that, though it
looks like a (terribly clumsy)
parody of reconciliation scenes,

is clearly meant to wrench our
emotions at the same time. Is
this determination to under
score the fact that Albin and Re
nato are a loving couple an at
tempt at Gay Liberation grand
standing? I suggest this because
there are other indications in
the movie that a political point
is intended. In one scene, a
group of straight men hassle the
protagonists and the French
spies, who are all in drag, for
reasons too complicated to ex
plain here.and are beaten up by
the agents and made to look ri
diculous. In another, Tognazzi
plays a reversal on the terrific

scene in the first Cage aux
Foiles in which he instructed
Serrault on how to walk like a
heterosexual: here he teaches
the agents how to walk like
gays, and there is a distinct bit
terness in his voice and a vicious
enjoyment of their discomfort.
It's a painful, sour scene, and re
ally unforgivable In the earlier
movie, Albin, trying to rehearse
looking straight to impress Re
nato's son's future in-laws,
emerged from his room in a
suit, and we felt his agony; it
was the most poignant
statement of how difficult it is
to be a homosexual in a straight
world that I have ever seen or
read. Are Molinaro and the
screenwriters attempting to
belie the evidence of their own
sensitivity?
