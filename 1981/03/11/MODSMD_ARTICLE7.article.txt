# Trustees OK heart research building

The design and funding for a $14 mil
lion Cardiovascular Research Build
ing (CVRB) to be built near the Medi
cal Center was approved by the Uni
versity Board of Trustees yesterday.
Bidding is expected to begin in No
vember, with occupancy scheduled for
August, 1983
The facility is designed to help ease
the "crowded facilities" in which
Cardiology and Cardiovascular
Surgery are currently operating, a re
port to the Board states.
The CVRB will provide facilities in
which to perform medical research
into the cardiovascular svstem. and
will consolidate anu expand the two
existing research programs —
Cardiology and Cardiovascular
Surgery — which are now operating.
In other business, the Board re
viewed operating budget guidelines
for 1981-82 which forecast a likely 16
percent increase — or 6 percent above
the projected inflation rate — in the
1982-83 tuition rate, according to the
Office of Management and Budget.
This increase, last spring projected
to be a 3-percent-plus-inflation hike,
should be thought of as a probable
"floor and not a ceiling" according to
Tim Warner, associate provost for
management and budget. Warner
added that the increase in fact repre
sents 3 percent more than the spring
forecast, necessitated largely by
higher-than-expected increases in
utility costs.
Another forecast that the Board re
viewed was the estimated breakdown
on sources of undergraduate scholar
ships. Across-the-board drops in the

percentage of scholarships funded by
University gifts and endowments, the
State of California, Federal programs
and other sources will prompt an in
crease in the amount of money that the
University must allocate from Gener
al Funds.
Since tuition revenues comprise 53
percent of General Funds, Warner
agreed that students themselves
would, in part, be picking up the slack
created by drops in state and federal
aid, as Stanford continues its commit
ment to "attempt to meet the finan
cial need of every student."
Rumors that the provost search
committee would announce its selec
tion of a candidate to the Board proved
wrong The office has been filled by
Acting Provost Albert Hastorf since
last summer, when Donald Kennedy
left the provost's office to become
president.
Norman Wessels, associate dean of
humanities and sciences, said yester
day the search for Kennedy's re
placement is at a "very delicate stage
right now."
