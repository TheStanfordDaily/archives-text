Scanners gives new meaning
to the word headache. Five
minutes into tho movie, wo see a
man's head blown up; it makes
a sound like that made by a can
taloupe being smashed. Five
minutes into the movie, 10 peo
ple left the theater, muttering
angrily. Those of us who re
mained settled a little deeper
into our seats. There was still an
hour and a half to go.
Scanners, a full-blooded addi
tion to the current meat-and
mayhem cycle, was written and
directed by David Cronenberg,
the man who gave us Rabid, It
Came from Within, and The
Brood. Somewhat surprisingly,
given Cronenberg's past record,
there's evidence here to in
dicate that he might not be a to
tal hack.
Don't get me wrong. Cronen
berg hasn't done anything that
will send away those who are at
tracted by the movie's ad cam
paign: "20 seconds — you ex
plode!". There seem to be large
numbers of people who enjoy
the new pornography of flying
guts and exploding eyeballs, and
it wouldn't do to disappoint a
paying crowd. But the director
has also included sequences that
do more than pander to ghoulish

tastes. Parts — or parts of parts
— of Scanners suggest that its
maker can do more than make a
head expiode on command.
Scanners' story is simple and
stupid (nor is snappy dialogue
one of Cronenberg's gifts). A
scanner is someone with
strange, telepathic powers.
Scanners — clever ones, at least
— can start fires, read minds,
alter heartbeats, and do ev
erything a good boy scout can
do. Bad scanners kill people.
This makes bad scanners very
valuable to power-crazed corpo
rations.
There's more to it, of course,
but you probably get the idea.
Scanners doesn't have the de
pressing, sleazy quality of the
others in its group: Terror
Train, or Bloody Valentine, or
Maniac. This is due partially to
the relative moral purity of
Cronenberg's film. Unlike its
counterparts, it doesn't rely on
exploiting sexual violence
toward women to achieve its ef
fects. It is violent but not misog
ynistic, and that is a victory of
sorts.
And, also unlike the other
members of its peer group,
Scanners shows signs of
possessing a sense of humor.
The movie's element of tongue

in-cheek undercuts some of its
more sadistic intentions.
It's helpful to compare Scan
n<'rs to .SY.v/Vv.v, an early, low
budget film directed by Brian
De Palma (Carrie, Dressed to
Kill). Sisters, like .Scanners, is
not a terribly good movie, but it
hinted at the presence of a real
talent at work. (It also had a nif
ty advertising hook: "what the
devil has joined together, let no
man cut asunder!"). Sisters
was generally simple and stupid
(it was the first in the series of
uncredited. uninspired remakes
of Psycho that De Palma has
made). But it had a few set
pieces that were terrific. The
movie was made bearable be
cause of two or three moments
when the director went into high
gear and transcended his mov
ie's over-all cheapness.
Like De Palma, Cronenberg's
visual sense is sometimes strik
ing. Scanners' best sequence,
the one that might have been the
reason Cronenberg started the
movie in the first place, comes
near the film's gory conclusion
Our hero, a scanner who is pure
of-heart (and a little slow-of
mind. too, but I don't think that
was intentional) must get some
information out of the bad guys'
computer. He goes to the

nearest telephone booth, puts in
a dime, and links up with the
computer telepathically. The
bad guys finally figure out
what's going on: they decide to
scramble the hero's brain by
scrambling the computer's rec
ords.
Cronenberg's staging of the
cross-cut scenes at the phone
booth and at the computer bank
is assured and flashy; for once,
we're reacting with, instead of
against, the movie. The pro
fessionalism of this sequence
goes far beyond the tawdry
butcher-shop effects found
elsewhere in the film.
Scanners marks Cronenberg
as a director with a future. But
those 10 people who left five
minutes into it probably had the
right idea. The commercial suc
cess of an exploitation picture
like this one should ultimately
allow Cronenberg to make mov
ies that don't need to rely on
cheap effects and saturation ad
campaigns to get people into the
theater.
Until that happy day comes,
one would do well to think twice
before venturing into a Cronen
berg film. He has talent but, ap
parently. not much taste. The
genre he's working in is one
that's a lot more fun to talk
about than to watch.
