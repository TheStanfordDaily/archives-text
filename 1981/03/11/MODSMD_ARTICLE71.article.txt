# Breaker Morant: cinematic reprisals for British imperialism
## 
### Vince Waldman 
The Boer War is little remembered today.
The small horrors of that conflict have been
superseded by the larger horrors of the two
World Wars and Vietnam. But the Boer War —
England's effort to subdue the Dutch settlers
in South Africa between 1899 and 1902 — was
an early and important exhibition of the up
coming struggles between imperialism and
nationalism. It was the first modern war to be
dominated by guerilla hit-and-run tactics
("commando" is an Afrikaans word) that
have since been used by colonial peoples
around the world to battle the overwhelming
force of the great powers.
For the Australians who made Breaker
Morant (now showing at the Lumiere, San
Francisco, and opening Friday at the
Aquarius, Palo Alto), the Boer War must be
an especially significant example of im
perialism in action. The war was fought in the
name of England, of course, but many of the
British soldiers came from the colonies —
most notably the Australians who dominated
the Bushveldt Carbineers, a crack squad set
up to combat the Boer commandoes on their
own terms. Thus one set of colonials battled
another while the British looked con
temptuously upon both. And when, in 1901, an
Australian Carbineer named Harry
"Breaker" Morant killed some Boer pris
oners and a missionary who was doubling as a
spy, the British felt no compunction about ex
ecuting him — even though he was following
orders Morant was sacrificed in order to ap
pease the enemy — Britain was trying to nego

tiate an end to its messy war, and had to show
the world it was serious about peace. Morant
and two others were convicted by a kangaroo
court of British officers, and then summarily
shot.
The incident had a great impact in Austral
ia, which became an independent com
monwealth that year. To this day Australian
soldiers must be court-martialed by Austral
ians. even when they are serving in another
army. The callous treatment Morant received
may have been an important force in the
evolution of an Australian nationalism inde
pendent from England.
Subsequently Morant became a folk hero.
As portrayed by by Edward Woodwar, he is a
true Renaissance man: not only is he an ex
pert horse trainer (hence the nickname
"Breaker") and a brave, authoritative of
ficer. but he writes poetry, sings beautifully,
and is deeply romantic. He also has a fierce
temper, and his rampage against the Boers is
provoked when he sees the mutilated body of
his commanding officer Breaker Morant is
an awesome figure — faults and all — who
stands head and shoulders above the petty
English bureaucrats who control the events of
the film. (In a way he is a more believable ver
sion of Apocalypse Now's Col. Kurtz, who also
understood that when the whole country is a
battlefield only the most drastic measures
have hope of succeeding.)
But it is the inconsequential English career
officers who control Morant's fate. They put
him and his accomplices on trial for his re
prisals, and appoint a wholly inexperienced

Australian lawyer to defend them.
Major Thomas (Jack Thompson) has never
gone to trial before: his entire legal career
consists of land conveyancing in New South
Wales. He seems utterly disorganized and
helpless against the expert prosecutor and the
biased court. But what he lacks in experience
he makes up for with wits and passion. Unlike
the English judges. Major Thomas has been
out in the bush, has seen the atrocities per
petrated by both sides in this unprecedented
type of warfare. He comes to sympathize
wholeheartedly with his clients, and his de
fense becomes an emotional defense of his
country as well as his clients. Thomas under
goes a startling transformation as the trial
progresses: the lawyer becomes more as
sured, more convincing, more dedicated to
this justice of his cause. He destroys the
credibility of the prosecution witnesses; he
traps the prosecutor in his own legal theories;
he undermines the authority of the English
court. Like Woodward's Morant, Thompson's
Major Thomas is a powerful character who
seems out of place in a trial determined by
technicality and political expediency rather
than blind justice.
But all Major Thomas' efforts are for
naught. The verdict was decided before the
trial began, and no one listens to his im
passioned pleas for fairness. The trial is held
at a small fort, away from public attention.
The only audience members are the guards
(some of whom end up helping the defense)
and a lone stenographer (who is, incidentally,
one of the very few blacks we see in this film.)
After the trial the lawyer goes indignantly to

see Lord Kitchener, whose elegant head
quarters make a fascinating contrast with the
bare green courtroom where the defendants
are sentenced to death. Kitchener is conve
niently absent: his aide can't understand why
Thomas is so upset. "It's a sideshow of the
war," he says; there will be a peace con
ference and "soon we can all go home. "
All except the defendants, of course.
Morant and one accomplice are executed the
next day. bravely facing the firing squad
without blindfolds. This is an extremely pow
erful scene: the two sit on a barren hill, two
tiny dots of life surrounded by wilderness.
Then they are bowled over by the volley of bul
lets. It could be the end of a Kipling tale: di
rector Bruce Beresford here captures the es
sence of the late Victorian era, when English
grandeur and morality began to be challenged
by modern power and necessity.
Breaker Morant is a taut, traditional
courtroom drama. Its action mirrors
Beresford's direction: both are crisp, clean,
economical. Every event, every frame works
to further the plot. Yet this functional, mat
ter-of-fact style does more than keep the story
moving. Breaker Morant is a morally aware
film, but the deeper meanings arise naturally
out of the action. Through the strength of
character projected by its actors and the in
herent power of the situation the film cap
tures not only the viewer's interest but his
conscience as well.
Much has been made of the analogies be
tween Morant and Lt. Calley. The parallels
are certainly present, and the same argu
ments made about Calley apply to Morant as

well. (The lawyer says it's a question of hor
rors "committed by normal men in abnormal
situations ") But Morant is depicted as far
more of a hero than Calley ever was.
Breaker Morant is not only about wartime
culpability; it ranges more widely and ex
amines the world of imperialism. It is un
abashedly nationalistic; the Australians are
powerful individuals while the English are
hypocritical cogs in a great power machine.
Imperialism is an evil suffocating the free
spirit of the more daring, forthright Aus
trailians (and the Boers as well.)
If this film has a major tlaw it is the way it
panders to Aussie pride, without considering
the extent to which the Australians and Boers
themselves were creatures of the imperialist
system. This mypoia may explain why
Breaker Morant has become the most suc
cessful film in Australian history. But as any
one who has seen more challenging Australian
films (especially The Chant of Jimmie
Blacksmith) can attest, the Australians'
treatment of the aborigines was considerably
crueler than England's treatment of the
Boers. The film also misses the even greater
irony in what has happened in South Africa
since the Boer war we see almost no
Africans, nor are we reminded that the de
scendants of the Boers have perpetuated the
pernicious colonial doctrine of apartheid
Breaker Morant is a fascinating, compelling
drama, but it avoids the fact that Australia, as
much as the rest of us, must come to terms
with its oh m imperialism

and two others were convicted by a kangaroo
court of British officers, and then summarily
shot.
The incident had a great impact in Austral
ia, which became an independent com
monwealth that year. To this day Australian
soldiers must be court-martialed by Austral
ians. even when they are serving in another
army. The callous treatment Morant received
may have been an important force in the
evolution of an Australian nationalism inde
pendent from England.
Subsequently Morant became a folk hero.
As portrayed by by Edward Woodwar, he is a
true Renaissance man: not only is he an ex
pert horse trainer (hence the nickname
"Breaker") and a brave, authoritative of
ficer. but he writes poetry, sings beautifully,
and is deeply romantic. He also has a fierce
temper, and his rampage against the Boers is
provoked when he sees the mutilated body of
his commanding officer Breaker Morant is
an awesome figure — faults and all — who
stands head and shoulders above the petty
English bureaucrats who control the events of
the film. (In a way he is a more believable ver
sion of Apocalypse Now's Col. Kurtz, who also
understood that when the whole country is a
battlefield only the most drastic measures
have hope of succeeding.)
But it is the inconsequential English career
officers who control Morant's fate. They put
him and his accomplices on trial for his re
prisals, and appoint a wholly inexperienced

Australian lawyer to defend them.
Major Thomas (Jack Thompson) has never
gone to trial before: his entire legal career
consists of land conveyancing in New South
Wales. He seems utterly disorganized and
helpless against the expert prosecutor and the
biased court. But what he lacks in experience
he makes up for with wits and passion. Unlike
the English judges. Major Thomas has been
out in the bush, has seen the atrocities per
petrated by both sides in this unprecedented
type of warfare. He comes to sympathize
wholeheartedly with his clients, and his de
fense becomes an emotional defense of his
country as well as his clients. Thomas under
goes a startling transformation as the trial
progresses: the lawyer becomes more as
sured, more convincing, more dedicated to
this justice of his cause. He destroys the
credibility of the prosecution witnesses; he
traps the prosecutor in his own legal theories;
he undermines the authority of the English
court. Like Woodward's Morant, Thompson's
Major Thomas is a powerful character who
seems out of place in a trial determined by
technicality and political expediency rather
than blind justice.
But all Major Thomas' efforts are for
naught. The verdict was decided before the
trial began, and no one listens to his im
passioned pleas for fairness. The trial is held
at a small fort, away from public attention.
The only audience members are the guards
(some of whom end up helping the defense)
and a lone stenographer (who is, incidentally,
one of the very few blacks we see in this film.)
After the trial the lawyer goes indignantly to

see Lord Kitchener, whose elegant head
quarters make a fascinating contrast with the
bare green courtroom where the defendants
are sentenced to death. Kitchener is conve
niently absent: his aide can't understand why
Thomas is so upset. "It's a sideshow of the
war," he says; there will be a peace con
ference and "soon we can all go home. "
All except the defendants, of course.
Morant and one accomplice are executed the
next day. bravely facing the firing squad
without blindfolds. This is an extremely pow
erful scene: the two sit on a barren hill, two
tiny dots of life surrounded by wilderness.
Then they are bowled over by the volley of bul
lets. It could be the end of a Kipling tale: di
rector Bruce Beresford here captures the es
sence of the late Victorian era, when English
grandeur and morality began to be challenged
by modern power and necessity.
Breaker Morant is a taut, traditional
courtroom drama. Its action mirrors
Beresford's direction: both are crisp, clean,
economical. Every event, every frame works
to further the plot. Yet this functional, mat
ter-of-fact style does more than keep the story
moving. Breaker Morant is a morally aware
film, but the deeper meanings arise naturally
out of the action. Through the strength of
character projected by its actors and the in
herent power of the situation the film cap
tures not only the viewer's interest but his
conscience as well.
Much has been made of the analogies be
tween Morant and Lt. Calley. The parallels
are certainly present, and the same argu
ments made about Calley apply to Morant as

well. (The lawyer says it's a question of hor
rors "committed by normal men in abnormal
situations ") But Morant is depicted as far
more of a hero than Calley ever was.
Breaker Morant is not only about wartime
culpability; it ranges more widely and ex
amines the world of imperialism. It is un
abashedly nationalistic; the Australians are
powerful individuals while the English are
hypocritical cogs in a great power machine.
Imperialism is an evil suffocating the free
spirit of the more daring, forthright Aus
trailians (and the Boers as well.)
If this film has a major tlaw it is the way it
panders to Aussie pride, without considering
the extent to which the Australians and Boers
themselves were creatures of the imperialist
system. This mypoia may explain why
Breaker Morant has become the most suc
cessful film in Australian history. But as any
one who has seen more challenging Australian
films (especially The Chant of Jimmie
Blacksmith) can attest, the Australians'
treatment of the aborigines was considerably
crueler than England's treatment of the
Boers. The film also misses the even greater
irony in what has happened in South Africa
since the Boer war we see almost no
Africans, nor are we reminded that the de
scendants of the Boers have perpetuated the
pernicious colonial doctrine of apartheid

The Boer War is little remembered today.
The small horrors of that conflict have been
superseded by the larger horrors of the two
World Wars and Vietnam. But the Boer War —
England's effort to subdue the Dutch settlers
in South Africa between 1899 and 1902 — was
an early and important exhibition of the up
coming struggles between imperialism and
nationalism. It was the first modern war to be
dominated by guerilla hit-and-run tactics
("commando" is an Afrikaans word) that
have since been used by colonial peoples
around the world to battle the overwhelming
force of the great powers.
For the Australians who made Breaker
Morant (now showing at the Lumiere, San
Francisco, and opening Friday at the
Aquarius, Palo Alto), the Boer War must be
an especially significant example of im
perialism in action. The war was fought in the
name of England, of course, but many of the
British soldiers came from the colonies —
most notably the Australians who dominated
the Bushveldt Carbineers, a crack squad set
up to combat the Boer commandoes on their
own terms. Thus one set of colonials battled
another while the British looked con
temptuously upon both. And when, in 1901, an
Australian Carbineer named Harry
"Breaker" Morant killed some Boer pris
oners and a missionary who was doubling as a
spy, the British felt no compunction about ex
ecuting him — even though he was following
orders Morant was sacrificed in order to ap
pease the enemy — Britain was trying to nego

tiate an end to its messy war, and had to show
the world it was serious about peace. Morant

biased court. But what he lacks in experience
he makes up for with wits and passion. Unlike
the English judges. Major Thomas has been
out in the bush, has seen the atrocities per
petrated by both sides in this unprecedented
type of warfare. He comes to sympathize
wholeheartedly with his clients, and his de
fense becomes an emotional defense of his
country as well as his clients. Thomas under
goes a startling transformation as the trial
progresses: the lawyer becomes more as
sured, more convincing, more dedicated to
this justice of his cause. He destroys the
credibility of the prosecution witnesses; he
traps the prosecutor in his own legal theories;
he undermines the authority of the English
court. Like Woodward's Morant, Thompson's
Major Thomas is a powerful character who
seems out of place in a trial determined by
technicality and political expediency rather
than blind justice.
But all Major Thomas' efforts are for
naught. The verdict was decided before the
trial began, and no one listens to his im
passioned pleas for fairness. The trial is held
at a small fort, away from public attention.
The only audience members are the guards
(some of whom end up helping the defense)
and a lone stenographer (who is, incidentally,
one of the very few blacks we see in this film.)
After the trial the lawyer goes indignantly to

see Lord Kitchener, whose elegant head
quarters make a fascinating contrast with the
bare green courtroom where the defendants
are sentenced to death. Kitchener is conve
niently absent: his aide can't understand why
Thomas is so upset. "It's a sideshow of the
war," he says; there will be a peace con
ference and "soon we can all go home. "
All except the defendants, of course.
Morant and one accomplice are executed the
next day. bravely facing the firing squad
without blindfolds. This is an extremely pow
erful scene: the two sit on a barren hill, two
tiny dots of life surrounded by wilderness.
Then they are bowled over by the volley of bul
lets. It could be the end of a Kipling tale: di
rector Bruce Beresford here captures the es
sence of the late Victorian era, when English
grandeur and morality began to be challenged
by modern power and necessity.
Breaker Morant is a taut, traditional
courtroom drama. Its action mirrors
Beresford's direction: both are crisp, clean,
economical. Every event, every frame works
to further the plot. Yet this functional, mat
ter-of-fact style does more than keep the story
moving. Breaker Morant is a morally aware
film, but the deeper meanings arise naturally
out of the action. Through the strength of
character projected by its actors and the in
herent power of the situation the film cap
tures not only the viewer's interest but his
conscience as well.
Much has been made of the analogies be
tween Morant and Lt. Calley. The parallels
are certainly present, and the same argu
ments made about Calley apply to Morant as

well. (The lawyer says it's a question of hor
rors "committed by normal men in abnormal
situations ") But Morant is depicted as far
more of a hero than Calley ever was.
Breaker Morant is not only about wartime
culpability; it ranges more widely and ex
amines the world of imperialism. It is un
abashedly nationalistic; the Australians are
powerful individuals while the English are
hypocritical cogs in a great power machine.
Imperialism is an evil suffocating the free
spirit of the more daring, forthright Aus
trailians (and the Boers as well.)
If this film has a major tlaw it is the way it
panders to Aussie pride, without considering
the extent to which the Australians and Boers
themselves were creatures of the imperialist
system. This mypoia may explain why
Breaker Morant has become the most suc
cessful film in Australian history. But as any
one who has seen more challenging Australian
films (especially The Chant of Jimmie
Blacksmith) can attest, the Australians'
treatment of the aborigines was considerably
crueler than England's treatment of the
Boers. The film also misses the even greater
irony in what has happened in South Africa
since the Boer war we see almost no
Africans, nor are we reminded that the de
scendants of the Boers have perpetuated the
pernicious colonial doctrine of apartheid
Breaker Morant is a fascinating, compelling
drama, but it avoids the fact that Australia, as
much as the rest of us, must come to terms
with its oh m imperialism
