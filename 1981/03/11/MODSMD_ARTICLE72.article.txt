# Justice recalls medieval days
## 
### Stephen Nash 
There is a great deal of in
terest today in the cultures of
previous centuries. In music, it
is possible again to hear Renais
sance motets and dance suites
on original instruments with
authentic choirs and groupings.
In painting, there has been a re
vival of interest in very strict
realism and folk art. These in
vestigations. in addition to
being of historical importance,
enable us once more to under
stand the idioms of other eras,
and thus make old ideas startl
ingly contemporary.
■Justice!. Rick Foster's new
play at the Julian Theatre, rec
reates the style of traveling
theatre that was such a part of
medieval Europe. At that time,
performers would wander from
town to town, putting on enter
tainments wherever there were
enough people to form an au
dience. Costumes were very
simple, often just a piece of
cloth tied over the head. A few
simple props and objets trouves
(such as convenient rocks and
bushes) would make up the set.
The performers may not have
been professionally trained, but
they would try their best with
acrobatics, singing and acting.
Sincerity was made to step in
where talent left off.
Because of the gaps between
the resources of the performers
and the effects that they were
trying to achieve, the audience
members were active partici

pants in the play. They were
forced to use their imaginations
to pretend, for example, that
three people with sticks were a
heavily-armed battalion, or that
the woman dressed as a horse in
one scene could be a princess in
the next.
■Justice! contains many of
these images of medieval
theatre. The set (by Jeremy
Hamm) is surrounded on all
sides by irregular groupings of
seats, and has a tree growing in
the middle of it. It suggests that
the play is being performed in a
field, and that the audience is
sitting on the grass all around.
The actors wear simple cos
tumes and play multiple roles
(22 actors in 50 parts). Finally.
Gunnar Madsen has composed
period-style music to accom
pany the play, and this does
much to evoke a medieval
mood.
Justice! tells the story of
Michael Kohlhaas. a horse
breeder living in Saxony at the
time of the Reformation. One
summer, on his way to Dresden
to sell his horses, he is stopped
by Baron von Tronka and forced
to pay a toll. The Baron further
insists that he needs a travel
permit. Kohlhaas is skeptical,
but he leaves his two finest
horses and his servant with the
Baron and goes on to Dresden to
get the permit.
In Dresden. Kohlhaas dis
covers that the Baron has lied to
him. When he returns to claim

his property, he discovers that
his servant has been beaten and
that his horses are near death
Being a just man. Kohlhaas sues
the Baron for damages. Un
fortunately. the Baron has im
portant relatives, and the suit is
buried in the court bureaucracy.
Burning with anger, Kohlhaas
becomes a rebel in his search
for justice This search, com
plete with battles, a ghost, a
trial and a rutting stallion,
forms the main part of the play.
This valiant story is narrated
by Cynewulf, a Singer of Tales
iplayed by Marjory Panetti).
She appears between scenes to
describe off-stage happenings
and forthcoming events. She is
also at times an audience mem
ber and stage-hand. While
scenes are playing, she watches
the action close-up and hands
props to the actors. Panetti is
exciting to watch, due to the
fervor and directness of her per
formance.
Also impressive are Cab Cov
ay ( as the Prince of Saxony) and
Gail Chugg (as Martin Luther).
Both portray characters torn
between what is expected of
them (Luther because of his
writings, the Prince because of
his office i and what their emo
tions and instincts tell them to
feel. The two actors both give
serious "modern" per
formances. This may be a little
out of character with other
aspects of the play, but these

two roles have considerable
character development, making
this style of acting appropriate
Some of the other acting is
less satisfactory. The small
roles are generally played in an
exaggerated, almost slapstick,
style. Presumably, this is an at
tempt to imitate non-pro
fessional acting There are
many good reasons for using
non-professionals Although
they may be awkward, they can
have a sincerity and directness
which is almost impossible to
imitate. It is this same sincerity
which often makes documen
tary films so exciting to watch
Yet having trained actors at
tempt to reproduce this
awkwardness creates the dis
honest impression of people
playing below their abilities,
rather than striving for the best
possible performance. For
these reasons, the two small
children (David and Theo
Dilworth) were in many ways
the most successful in these
small parts.
Once it gets going. •Justice! is
frequently thrilling and magi
cal. It takes some very talented
people and has them perform
within the constrained idioms of
medieval theatre. This still al
lows them to do evocative and
imaginative work, but it also
lets the audience transform the
simple on-stage images into a
mental recreation of Reforma
tion Saxony.
