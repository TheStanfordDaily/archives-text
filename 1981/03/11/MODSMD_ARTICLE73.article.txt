# Crosby: still going strong
## 
### Tom Casciato 
Today. David Crosby, once
a member of one of the most
popular rock bands in the
world, is almost 40, over
weight, and half-bald He in
sists on wearing his hair
much too long, and his
mustache looks like it hasn't
been trimmed since 1970.
Perhaps by design, but per
haps out of necessity, a man
who could once fill a 60,000-
seat football stadium with
fans whose enthusiasm
bordered on deification, has
been reduced in the last few
years to playing gigs in the
Bay Area at venues the size
of the Palace of Fine Arts in
San Francisco (admittedly,
this was a benefit show), the
Keystone Palo Alto, and last
Saturday night, the 250-seat
Julia Morgan Theater in
Berkeley.
Crosby. Stills, Nash and
Young used to tour with an
entourage of roadies and
sound people, and two or
three top-notch backing mu
sicians. Including both elec
tric acoustic sets, they would
play shows that lasted up to
four hours. At Julia Morgan,
Crosby showed up with his
manager, a few friends, and
a guitar player identified
only as "Carl." Playing only
acoustic music, Crosby
.played for about 45 minutes
by himself, then brought Carl
on for the last four songs.
And it was a great show.
Without the supporting vo
cals of Graham Nash, or the
guitars of Stephen Stills and
Neil Young, many of
Crosby's classic composi
tions — "Deja Vu," "Long
Time Gone," "Wooden
Ships," — were forced to
stand up on their own. And
stand up they did. Crosby's
voice is as strong as ever,
and stripped of their in
strumentation and harmo
nies. most of his melodies
proved nonetheless to be
both powerful and im
aginative.
Whether with CSN,CSNY,
or in tandem with Graham
Nash, Crosby has always
written music less ac
cessible than that of his com
patriots. His chords are not

the simple majors and mi
nors of Neil Young, his
progressions not the blues
patterns of Stephen Stills.
Rather, they are complex,
always original and have
always taken the longest to
get used to; maybe this is
why they seem to have the
most staying power. ' Page
43" and "Song With No
Words (Tree With No
Leaves)" seem particularly
timeless, and the stark ar
rangements of Saturday's
show not only took nothing
away from these songs, but
actually pointed to Crosby's
songwriting prowess.
Lyrically though, some of
the songs are beginning to
show their age. The line in
"Long Time Gone" about
having to cut your hair if you
"get yourself elected"
seems silly in 1981, and the
flight from madness de
picted in "Wooden Ships"
now seems more escapist
than visionary. Still, Crosby
himself would probably be
the first to admit that the lyr
ics aren't perfect; at one
point in the performance he
lampooned both "Wooden
Ships" (singing "Wooden
blips on the radar") and
Nash's "Our House" ("Our
mouse is a very very very
fine mouse/With two cats in
the yard that keep our mouse
on guard").
Perhaps the finest mo
ments of the evening oc
curred with the introduction
of four new songs, one of
which was an a cappella
piece done without a micro
phone, which rang through
the tinv theater with an in

timacy that could never have
been achieved in the stadium
days. Another high point
came during the middle of
"Wooden Ships," when Carl
got a round of applause for a
particularly blistering solo.
But new songs and Carl
aside, it was the Julia
Morgan Theater that made
this a particularly warm per
formance. Once a church
(the audience actually sits in
wooden pews), the Morgan is
one of the finest spots in the
Bay Area to see a show. The
acoustics are more than ade
quate, and the all-wooden in
terior provides an intimacy
not found in most clubs and
halls.
Unfortunately, the thea
ter, and with it the non-profit
group that produces not only
concerts but dance and dra
ma as well, may be shut
down if funds cannot be
raised to install a sprinkler
system; the theater was re
cently forced to cut its ca
pacity from 488 to 250 be
cause of a ten year-old fire
ordinance requiring
sprinklers, and as a result,
events like the Crosby con
cert, which normally would
net enough profit to produce
less popular shows, turn out
to be nearly non-profit propo
sitions themselves.
One would hope that the
Julia Morgan Theater will
survive. After all, David
Crosby has, and he's still
going strong.

been reduced in the last few
years to playing gigs in the
Bay Area at venues the size
of the Palace of Fine Arts in
San Francisco (admittedly,
this was a benefit show), the
Keystone Palo Alto, and last
Saturday night, the 250-seat
Julia Morgan Theater in
Berkeley.
Crosby. Stills, Nash and
Young used to tour with an
entourage of roadies and
sound people, and two or
three top-notch backing mu
sicians. Including both elec
tric acoustic sets, they would
play shows that lasted up to
four hours. At Julia Morgan,
Crosby showed up with his
manager, a few friends, and
a guitar player identified
only as "Carl." Playing only
acoustic music, Crosby
.played for about 45 minutes
by himself, then brought Carl
on for the last four songs.
And it was a great show.
Without the supporting vo
cals of Graham Nash, or the
guitars of Stephen Stills and
Neil Young, many of
Crosby's classic composi
tions — "Deja Vu," "Long
Time Gone," "Wooden
Ships," — were forced to
stand up on their own. And
stand up they did. Crosby's
voice is as strong as ever,
and stripped of their in
strumentation and harmo
nies. most of his melodies
proved nonetheless to be
both powerful and im
aginative.
Whether with CSN,CSNY,
or in tandem with Graham
Nash, Crosby has always
written music less ac
cessible than that of his com
patriots. His chords are not

the simple majors and mi
nors of Neil Young, his
progressions not the blues
patterns of Stephen Stills.
Rather, they are complex,
always original and have
always taken the longest to
get used to; maybe this is
why they seem to have the
most staying power. ' Page
43" and "Song With No
Words (Tree With No
Leaves)" seem particularly
timeless, and the stark ar
rangements of Saturday's
show not only took nothing
away from these songs, but
actually pointed to Crosby's
songwriting prowess.
Lyrically though, some of
the songs are beginning to
show their age. The line in
"Long Time Gone" about
having to cut your hair if you
"get yourself elected"
seems silly in 1981, and the
flight from madness de
picted in "Wooden Ships"
now seems more escapist
than visionary. Still, Crosby
himself would probably be
the first to admit that the lyr
ics aren't perfect; at one
point in the performance he
lampooned both "Wooden
Ships" (singing "Wooden
blips on the radar") and
Nash's "Our House" ("Our
mouse is a very very very
fine mouse/With two cats in
the yard that keep our mouse
on guard").
Perhaps the finest mo
ments of the evening oc
curred with the introduction
of four new songs, one of
which was an a cappella
piece done without a micro
phone, which rang through
the tinv theater with an in

timacy that could never have
been achieved in the stadium
days. Another high point
came during the middle of
"Wooden Ships," when Carl
got a round of applause for a
particularly blistering solo.
But new songs and Carl
aside, it was the Julia
Morgan Theater that made
this a particularly warm per
formance. Once a church
(the audience actually sits in
wooden pews), the Morgan is
one of the finest spots in the
Bay Area to see a show. The
acoustics are more than ade
quate, and the all-wooden in
terior provides an intimacy
not found in most clubs and
halls.
Unfortunately, the thea
ter, and with it the non-profit
group that produces not only
concerts but dance and dra
ma as well, may be shut
down if funds cannot be
raised to install a sprinkler
system; the theater was re
cently forced to cut its ca
pacity from 488 to 250 be
cause of a ten year-old fire
ordinance requiring
sprinklers, and as a result,
events like the Crosby con
cert, which normally would
net enough profit to produce
less popular shows, turn out
to be nearly non-profit propo
sitions themselves.
One would hope that the
Julia Morgan Theater will
survive. After all, David
Crosby has, and he's still
going strong.
(Editor's note: inquiries con
cerning the Julia Morgan
Theater should he directed

Today. David Crosby, once
a member of one of the most
popular rock bands in the
world, is almost 40, over
weight, and half-bald He in
sists on wearing his hair
much too long, and his
mustache looks like it hasn't
been trimmed since 1970.
Perhaps by design, but per
haps out of necessity, a man
who could once fill a 60,000-
seat football stadium with
fans whose enthusiasm
bordered on deification, has
been reduced in the last few
years to playing gigs in the
Bay Area at venues the size
