# Styx proves its critics wrong in a 'paradise theatre'
## 
### Clark Beyer 
As the house lights dimmed and the cur
tain rose, the speakers blared two corny,
'20s style renditions of "Hooray for Holly
wood" and the 20th Century-Fox theme.
Nothing could have been more appropriate;
Styx's appearance last Monday at the Cow
Palace was definitely meant to be a show.
For the most part, the veteran band from
Chicago got away with it. On the heels of
their hugely successful Paradise Theatre
album, which reaffirmed their reputation
for a very accessible and commercial style
of recording, Styx emerged with a tight and
cohesive greatest-hits-style show that
seldom dragged. They interspersed songs
from nearly every stage of their eleven
year professional career, leaning heavily
toward their latest platinum albums and the
just-released, critically acclaimed Para
dise Theatre. The latter, a good lyrical
album (for Styx), and one that wisely did
away with a great deal of those tedious syn
thesizer swells, has finally brought Styx to
terms with the critics — it has shown them
to be maturing in to the realm of a fine con
cept album. (At one point in the show, lead
singer and keyboardist Dennis DeYoung

told the crowd, "Try to take home a little bit
of the Paradise Theatre tonight and think
about it.")
But in spite of that, the show was to be
taken lightly, as evidenced by the behavior
of over 14,000 fans who waited in line for up
to ten hours due to the festival style seating.
Dennis DeYoung opened with "A.D. 1928,"
the introductory cut from Paradise, soloing
in front of a Hollywood backdrop of a thea
tre interior. This was raised at the con
clusion of the song to expose the rest of the
band, consisting of Tommy Shaw on guitars
and vocals, James Young on guitars and vo
cals, Chuck Panozzo on bass guitar, and
John Panozzo on drums, If nothing else,
Young proved that he could manipulate his
Fender Stratocaster right up there with
anyone in the business - the heavy metal
riffs and searing solo work kept the Cow
Palace rocking and made one wonder how
he could sit through DeYoung's "Babe"
with a straight face. Shaw handled his vo
cals well, bringing the house down with an
energetic "Renegade" and the popular
"Blue Collar Man." Likewise, Young's
"Miss America" was shown to be one of the

better received cuts off of (Wand. Illusion,
and DeYoung's handlings of "Lady" and the
saccharine "babe" brought the house
— or at least the pre-pubescent constituency
— to its collective feet. Shaw and Young's
intricate guitar harmonies and lively man
nerism proved that Styx could dispel their
bubblegum image in a second; and the new
album is another step in the right direction.
The two Panozzo brothers seemed quite
content in just laying down the rhythm
track; they left the playing of the crowd to
the flashier singers. As it turned out there
was a good deal of patter from the musi
cians to the audience, but it often came
across as rather contrived. This comment
from DeYoung, for instance: "You know,
we bring the music with us, but it's you peo
ple who bring the magic." No Springsteen
here.
•The group was in error in choosing to
leave out several vintage Styx numbers (in
cluding "Lorelei" and "Mademoiselle"),
and in holding the set to only two hours. But
they wisely kept the KISS flash pots and oth
er theatrics to a tasteful minimum. The
final impression they gave was that Styx
finally has something to say.
