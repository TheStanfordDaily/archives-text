# Human Sexual Response is clever, but that's about all

Clever cover Two kids barely
out ol the mewling-and-puking
stage, eager looks on their
freshly scrubbed mugs, hesitat
ingly sticking their fingers into
a mold of lime Jello, probably
wondering what it's all about.
"Human Sexual Response"
above the picture. "Figure 14"
below. Clever.
Sounds are just as clever too.
Human Sexual Response is
basically 4 singers and three
musicians. The boys in the band
play a kind of psychedelic
tinged power pop, very New
Wave (capitalized, of course).
The singers, led by lyricist
Larry Bangor, all have pretty
voices and harmonize like they
were raised on "Row, Row,
Row, Your Boat." Nice idea of
contrasting raw music and
polished singing Gladys Knight
and the Pips for the 80s. Clever.
OK, so what's wrong? De
pends on which song you talk
about. Side 1 starts off very
promisingly with "Guardian
Angel," a finely crafted pop
song built around Bangor's
voice. Bangor is the only one in
Human Sexual Response with
something resembling a real
voice, and it sounds refreshing.
The same pop mqod continues
through the intro to "Dick and
Jane," but then the hooks sud
denly end. Rich Gilbert's guitar
jumps out of the pop chord mode
and begins to sound like it's self
destructing underwater. There
suit is very much like Keith
Levene's guitar work in Public

Image Ltd., especially with
Chris Machlachlan and
Malcolm Travis providing a
steady rhythm section. In other
words, the music is line — but
I'm beginning to have doubts
about Larry Bangor I mean, it
could start to cool off a song
with some monosyllabic "See
Dick run" blurbs, but the whole
song is like that And his voice
isn't as refreshing anymore . .
"Jackie Onassis" comes
next, with backing vocalist Dini
Lamot taking lead roles with a
pretty, more conventional
voice. But there's Larry, still
mixed prominently in the back
ground. squealing away It just
doesn't seem to fit, I think to
myself as the doubts begin to
settle in
"Cool Jerk" confirms my
doubts. It's a remake of a clas
sic 60s tune, so I'm a sucker for
the music. But the vocal ar
rangement makes the song as a -
hole far from irresistible. The
high-pitched vocals are not a
contrast to the bass-dominated
music anymore, but more if a
distraction. I felt the song was
far too long, and at 2:35. that's
saying something My hopes
were lifted a bit by "Dolls" with
its guitar arpeggioing all over
the place, another sound I can't
get enough of. Considering the
scary tone of the lyrics, how
ever, Bangor's singing (still the
same style, no difference in
emotion) makes it all seem
curiously safe. This one's also
too long and indulgent, making
me hesitate while the record
clicks in the "turn-me-over-as

shole" groove.
Side 2 immediately sounds
like it was a mistake to turn
over the record. None of it is
bad. mind you — except "Unba
Unba," which has "filler"
screaming at you from between
every groove. Why did these
folks print the lyrics on the
sleeve anyway? They're not
even especially clever anymore
— the titles ("What Does Sex
Mean To Me?", "Marone
Moan," "Unba Unba") are, un
like the lad and lass on the cov
er, strictly mewling-and-puking
material In addition, the vocals
overshadow the other music in
the mix, so much that I can't
help but groan as I take notes on
the album. It's as if Human Sex
ual Response wants to show this
idea that it's so proud of, and the
idea's different, but it doesn't
come together. To coin a
phrase, they're wearing their
art on their sleeve, and I don't
like the pattern.
"Anne Frank Story," the last
track on Figure 14, does what it
can to change my mind, but it
isn't much. There's great music
again, surprisingly full for a
three-man band, and more
arpeggio guitar. But the voices
don't say anything different,
though the lyrics might. The
far-from-godlike two-chord
guitar solo doesn't help my opin
ion of anything either. This one
goes too long, too, and I'm sur
prised that only 40-odd minutes
have gone by when Figure 14
checks out.
Human Sexual Response is
clever, and the idea of contrast

ing new wave with old harmony
may still work — there are some
hints of potential on Figure 14.
But all too annoyingly, some

thing is missing in almost all of
the songs — more frustrat
ingly. it's something a little
ditterent that's missing each

time. Overall. Human Sexual
Response seems to be like the
little tolks on the cover; they're
interested, and interesting, but

they're not so good at figuring
out what they're poking their
fingers into.
