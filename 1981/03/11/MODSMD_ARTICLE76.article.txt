# Guest conductor Ormandy stars at Davies
## 
### Andrew Shields 
At 81, Eugene Ormandy is one of the grand old
maestros of music. Last week, as guest conductor of
the San Francisco Symphony he once again proved it to
be a reputation well-deserved. Ormandy was able to
elicit from the orchestra a sound that was powerful yet
controlled, with a clarity, crispness. and excitement of
tone that has been missing all too frequently in recent
concerts under Edo de Waart's baton.
The program opened with Barber's Second Essay for
Orchestra, written in 1942. A fluid, unhurried work, Or
mandy conducted it in just this way. The theme unfolds
easily in the flute, followed by variants of this theme
emerging from other winds. The balance here was
splendid; never overstated, each instrument presented
its theme with self-assurance and sensitivity.
Barber was followed by Beethoven, Symphony No. 7
in A The first movement begins with a moderate (poco
sostenuto) introduction, slowly building up tension and
energy that is only partially released in the first move
ment. Indeed, this energy becomes a propelling force
through the entire symphony, including the slow (al
legretto) movement (which itself is relatlively fast, as
slow movements go). Ormandy tapped this energy,
bringing it to the fore but never letting it get out of

hand. The third movement (presto) was particularly
nice, taken at the perfect tempo — fast enough to be
brimming with sprightly enthusiasm, but slow enough
to allow sufficient spreading of the rich harmonies. A
bit of trouble was encountered in the second movement
as the melody, at one point in the woodwinds, was
drowned out by the strings. (Ormandy seemed to be in
disagreement with the cellos much of the time.) This,
however, was the only moment of trouble out of an ex
ceptionally fine concert.
The highlight of the evening was Moussorgsky's Pic
tures at an Exhibition. Written in 1874 as a set of piano
pieces, it was transcribed for orchestra by Ravel in
1922. This work is a musical "description" of pictures
by Moussorgsky's friend Victor Hartmann.
Moussorgsky uses various compositional devices to
"describe" pictures of a gnome, an old Italian castle,
children playing in a park in Paris, an ox pulling a wag
on, among others. Ravel is very sensitive to the ideas
and imagination of Moussorgsky (much more so than
the many others who have tried transcriptions of Pic
tures at an Exhibition — including Emerson. Lake, and
Palmer), and is himself very facile in orchestrational
devices. Thus, you can hear and almsot see the bustle of
"The market at Limoges," or the dank gloominess of

Parisian catacombs in "Catacombae — Sepulchrum
Romanum."
Again, Ormandy's conducting was right on the mark
as he brought the pictures to life (the audience had to
laugh at the peeping and scurrying of "Ballet of chicks
in their Shells," so life-like was the music). Pictures at
an Exhibition relies heavily on brass, especially tor
"Promenade" (the music that describes the viewer
walking between pictures) and"The Great Gate of
Kiev" (the grandest gate you will ever hear. I assure
you). Here was this orchestra's brass section at its
finest; intonation, articulation, phrasing and blend
were all superb. At the end of the piece Ormandy in
dicated the brass section for a collective bow, which
was certainly well-earned.
The audience gave this performance the longest
standing ovation I have ever seen for a classical con
cert, standing and clapping long after the
house lights had been raised. Even the Davies Sym
phony Hall's roundly (and for the most part justly)
criticized acoustics could not dampen the enthusiasm
of this evening. Eugene Ormandy drew out of the San
Francisco Symphony that what Edo de Waart has been
able to draw only too seldom. Let's hope we hear much
more from Mr. Ormandy for many years to come.

hand. The third movement (presto) was particularly
nice, taken at the perfect tempo — fast enough to be
brimming with sprightly enthusiasm, but slow enough
to allow sufficient spreading of the rich harmonies. A
bit of trouble was encountered in the second movement
as the melody, at one point in the woodwinds, was
drowned out by the strings. (Ormandy seemed to be in
disagreement with the cellos much of the time.) This,
however, was the only moment of trouble out of an ex
ceptionally fine concert.
The highlight of the evening was Moussorgsky's Pic
tures at an Exhibition. Written in 1874 as a set of piano
pieces, it was transcribed for orchestra by Ravel in
1922. This work is a musical "description" of pictures
by Moussorgsky's friend Victor Hartmann.
Moussorgsky uses various compositional devices to
"describe" pictures of a gnome, an old Italian castle,
children playing in a park in Paris, an ox pulling a wag
on, among others. Ravel is very sensitive to the ideas
and imagination of Moussorgsky (much more so than
the many others who have tried transcriptions of Pic
tures at an Exhibition — including Emerson. Lake, and
Palmer), and is himself very facile in orchestrational
devices. Thus, you can hear and almsot see the bustle of
"The market at Limoges," or the dank gloominess of

Parisian catacombs in "Catacombae — Sepulchrum
Romanum."
Again, Ormandy's conducting was right on the mark
as he brought the pictures to life (the audience had to
laugh at the peeping and scurrying of "Ballet of chicks
in their Shells," so life-like was the music). Pictures at
an Exhibition relies heavily on brass, especially tor
"Promenade" (the music that describes the viewer
walking between pictures) and"The Great Gate of
Kiev" (the grandest gate you will ever hear. I assure
you). Here was this orchestra's brass section at its
finest; intonation, articulation, phrasing and blend
were all superb. At the end of the piece Ormandy in
dicated the brass section for a collective bow, which
was certainly well-earned.
The audience gave this performance the longest
standing ovation I have ever seen for a classical con
cert, standing and clapping long after the
house lights had been raised. Even the Davies Sym
phony Hall's roundly (and for the most part justly)
criticized acoustics could not dampen the enthusiasm
of this evening. Eugene Ormandy drew out of the San
Francisco Symphony that what Edo de Waart has been
able to draw only too seldom. Let's hope we hear much
more from Mr. Ormandy for many years to come.
