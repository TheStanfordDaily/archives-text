# Making movies: Zevonand Knopfler play their own personas
## 
### Ron Lillejord 
The bespectacled Warren
Zevon and the balding Mark
Knopfler don't seem to have the
"right stuff" to be rock heroes
They look unremarkable andpo
lite. almost deferent But they
save their swagger and flash for
their music, much as Buddy
Holly did Within their music,
these two singer-songwriters
each play different roles —
Zevon s the hardboiled night
stalker, often disarming you
with his comic absurdity, cap
turing his characters' jagged
and desperate edges.
Knopfler's the sleek guitar
wizard, trying to get inside your
heart
On their new records espe
cially. both Zevon and Knopfler
share an affinity for movies and
the culture ot movies. To be
sure, they tend to explore dif
ferent aspects of this fantasy
world — Knopfler deals with
people's romantic dreams, and
Zevon s preoccupied with their
nightmares — but they share a
passion exhibited by precious
few other rockers these days
Stand in the Fire. Zevon's
new album, is a live recording
from L.A.'s Roxy. It's a trium
phant and bold return to form
for Zevon. who's been trapped in
a personal and artistic decline
since his debut release in 1976
Zevon's lumbering, guitar
pounding style owes much to
English heavy metal, but his
lyrics instantly identify him as
an American Zevon under
stands the American culture of
violence, the media images of
violence. He's not a great writer
though, mostly because much of
his work seems to be at one re
moved from violence itself and

its brutality. As if to make
himself authentic. Zevon s been
through his own battles, most
notably, a recent kicking of al
coholism . his groans and grunts
are those of a veteran comba
tant
The tragedy of Warren Zevon
is that he s been hurt far more
than helped by the enormously
favorable critical reaction he's
received throughout his career
Critics tend to identity with
Zevon. not only because there
are physical resemblances (for
example, if you put Dave Marsh
on stage, you might mistake
him for Zevon i, but because
they respond to the '40s film noir
shadings in his work Zevon's
the Raymond Chandler they've
never had
Paul Nelsons rabidly
positive review of Zevon's 1977
album Fxcitahle Ho\ in Rolling
Stone was an appalling piece of
work from a major critic — it
read like the ravings of teen fan
magazine Not only did the re
view not function as criticism, it
came at a time when being "the
next big thing' was more a
curse than a blessing. A respon
sible critic would have allowed
Zevon to mature normally;
Nelson's coronation ot Zevon
was almost a death wish Zevon
grew out of touch with his au
dience — more accurately,
critics managed to insulate him
from his audience. 1979's Bad
l.uck Streak in Dancing School
was wildly uneven and stuffed
with inflated ideas; Zevon was
self-consciously trying to outdo
himself, and the result was an
overproduced, often over-writ
ten mess with orchestral in
terludes thrown in And. more
tragically. Zevon seemed to

have lost his wicked sense of hu
mor on Had l.uck Streak
With Stand in thi Fire. Zevon
is back to basics Zevon and
band (Zevon. piano and 12-
string guitar: David Landau,
lead guitar; Zeke Zirngiebel.
rhythm and lead guitar; Bob
Harris, keyboards. Roberto
Pinon. bass, and Marty Stinger,
drums) have their killer in
stincts back, and Zevon's re
surgent comic edge keeps things
lively Zevon's music is that of a
tough guy stuck in a wimp's
body — without comedy it grows
stale and offensive
The title track is a reworking
of the ideas in Had l.uck « "Play
It All Night Long." stripped of
that song's rock rebel posturing
and horrible string background
Zevon's yell "I won't put on my
brakes" sets the tone for the
rest ot the performance
Driven by the demands of the
stage. Zevon's music acquires
the desperate, fighting quality
ot his lyrics. Unlike nearly all
other live albums, there are de
finitive. classic performances
here as a result.

And Zevon squeezes so much
pleasure out ot his hoarse yells
in "Lawyers, Guns and Money
that you feel as if you're re
discovering the song
But it's with a new song. "The
Sin." that Zevon takes his talent
to another level In this ma
chine-gun style rocker. Zevon
begins to get to the heart of the
matter; it's a song of betrayal,
and you feel the pure anger in
the singer's voice. "I'm talking
about the time that you were
cruel for cruelty's sake," Zevon
screams, asking "How you gon
na pay for the sin" — his
punctuating, demanding growl
"hunh°!" rips into your heart
If "The Sin" is a climactic
moment, the encore number
"Bo Diddley's a Gunslinger" is
a final reassurance — a sign that
Zevon still has a grin on his face
and a rifle in his hand
Zevon compares rock per
formers to Western outlaws;
Mark Knopfler sees them as
warm-hearted troubadours.
Dire Straits' new record. Mak
ing Mocies. represents the
band's most fully realized work
to date. For the tirst time. Dire
Straits has been given the feel of
a real band — the band is finally
something more than a guitar
genius and his backing musi
cians.
Much of the credit for this
should probably go to Jimmy
lovine. who's creating quite a
reputation for himself with his

work here and with Bruce
Springsteen. Tom Petty and
Graham Parker lovine is the
first producer to create some
tension and drama between
Knopfler and bassist John 11-
Isley and drummer Pick
Withers The big backbeat re
places the convivial folksy
sound of Dire Straits' first two
records, giving the band more of
a true rock sound Also, rhythm
guitarist David Knopfler has
been replaced, at least for this
effort, by E Street Band pianist
Roy Bittan. who gives the rec
ord added color and verve
Where the tirst two Dire
Straits records ambled, this one
prances lovine gives the the
songs crescendos and small mo
ments to be savored; the dulling
sameness of the first two rec
ords is gone.
Knopfler's singing completes
the transformation He
chuckles, roars, sighs, whis
pers. snarls and begs — it's an
astonishing performance from
someone who's natural vocal
abilities are so limited You feel
the heat here — Knopfler
breathes life and fire into his
characters.
The self-consciousness of the
album's title applies both to
Knopfler and the characters he
creates. Knopfler lifts the
scenes and moods for the songs
from Romeo and ■Juliet and
Cabaret, among others; the
characters are continually pos
ing as actors starring in their
own fantasy plays, but the
smallness of their stage gives
them a human, vulnerable qual
itv.
As the singer. Knopfler plays
a host ot different roles. In "Les

Boys' he s a snide essayist, up
dating Cabaret for "disco bars
in Germany " He's also an ob
server in "Skateaway." watch
ing in amusement as a zestful
young girl roller skates through
the city, listening to rock on the
radio and dreaming her own
"movies on location."
But it's when the singer is a
vital participant that the songs
really begin to matter to us. At
the start of the opening number.
"Tunnel of Love." Knopfler is
almost autobiographical, brief
ly recalling his past "singing
about switchblades." etc.
"Take a low ride with me, girl,"
he pleads, trying to interest her
in his gambling ways. Fatal
istically. the singer lets the girl
go in the end. singing "I could
have caught up with her easy
enough But something must
have made me stay." Almost to
console himself. Knopfler then
launches into one of the few
lengthy guitar solos on the rec
ord. beginning softly and ending
in renewed exhilaration, as if
he's ready to go searching for
love again
But Knopfler hasn't quite told
his heartbreaking story yet. In
"Romeo and Juliet," the singer
returns to his lover but finds
that her success has ended their
once-shared dream. In an
aching voice, he asks:
/ dreamed your dream for you
And now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if
I teas just another one of your
deals?
But it's just another scene to
the woman, and she ignores the
singer's torment, leaving
Knopfler to sing, in a hoarse

whisper, accompanied only by
an acoustic guitar:
I can't do the talk
l.ike they talk on the TV
And I can t do a love song
The tray it's meant to be. . .
And all I do is kiss you
Hetu een the bars of a rhyme
Julie, I'd do the stars n ith you
anytime.
"Romeo and Juliet" is an
almost perfect love play in min
iature; it's also the best song
Mark Knopfler has ever writ
ten
The record never quite
reaches the level of passion in
"Romeo and Juliet' again but
there are other special mo
ments. In "Espresso Love" an
exhilarated Knopfler leads Dire
Straits through a rave-up, sing
ing of ecstatic lovers who never
get enough of each other. And in
"Solid Rock, Knopfler de
livers the scattershot, jumbled
lyrics with manic joy.
The warmth and the depth of
feeling in Ma king Movies re
calls John Huston in a romantic
mood Stand in the Fire is more
reminiscent of the dark, yet ec
static vision of Sam Peckinpah
Knopfler's passion is the kind
that breaks your heart; Zevon's
intention is to rip your heart out.
They both could be great mov
iemakers.

launches into one of the few
lengthy guitar solos on the rec

in renewed exhilaration, as if
he's ready to go searching for
love again
But Knopfler hasn't quite told
his heartbreaking story yet. In
"Romeo and Juliet," the singer
returns to his lover but finds
that her success has ended their
once-shared dream. In an
aching voice, he asks:
/ dreamed your dream for you
And now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if
I teas just another one of your
deals?
But it's just another scene to
the woman, and she ignores the
singer's torment, leaving
Knopfler to sing, in a hoarse

whisper, accompanied only by
an acoustic guitar:
I can't do the talk

And I can t do a love song
The tray it's meant to be. . .
And all I do is kiss you

Knopfler don't seem to have the

On their new records espe

share an affinity for movies and

for Zevon. who's been trapped in

lyrics instantly identify him as

But it's with a new song. "The

to another level In this ma

begins to get to the heart of the
matter; it's a song of betrayal,

band's most fully realized work
to date. For the tirst time. Dire

a real band — the band is finally
something more than a guitar
genius and his backing musi
cians.
Much of the credit for this
should probably go to Jimmy
lovine. who's creating quite a
reputation for himself with his

work here and with Bruce

been replaced, at least for this
effort, by E Street Band pianist
Roy Bittan. who gives the rec
ord added color and verve
Where the tirst two Dire

songs crescendos and small mo

sameness of the first two rec

the transformation He
chuckles, roars, sighs, whis
pers. snarls and begs — it's an
astonishing performance from
someone who's natural vocal
abilities are so limited You feel
the heat here — Knopfler
breathes life and fire into his
characters.
The self-consciousness of the
album's title applies both to
Knopfler and the characters he
creates. Knopfler lifts the
scenes and moods for the songs
from Romeo and ■Juliet and
Cabaret, among others; the
characters are continually pos
ing as actors starring in their
own fantasy plays, but the
smallness of their stage gives
them a human, vulnerable qual
itv.

a host ot different roles. In "Les

in Germany " He's also an ob

ing in amusement as a zestful
young girl roller skates through

radio and dreaming her own
"movies on location."
But it's when the singer is a
vital participant that the songs
really begin to matter to us. At
the start of the opening number.
"Tunnel of Love." Knopfler is
almost autobiographical, brief
ly recalling his past "singing
about switchblades." etc.
"Take a low ride with me, girl,"
he pleads, trying to interest her
in his gambling ways. Fatal
istically. the singer lets the girl
go in the end. singing "I could

someone who's natural vocal
abilities are so limited You feel
the heat here — Knopfler
breathes life and fire into his
characters.
The self-consciousness of the
album's title applies both to
Knopfler and the characters he
creates. Knopfler lifts the
scenes and moods for the songs
from Romeo and ■Juliet and
Cabaret, among others; the
characters are continually pos
ing as actors starring in their
own fantasy plays, but the
smallness of their stage gives
them a human, vulnerable qual

young girl roller skates through

radio and dreaming her own
"movies on location."
But it's when the singer is a
vital participant that the songs
really begin to matter to us. At
the start of the opening number.
"Tunnel of Love." Knopfler is
almost autobiographical, brief
ly recalling his past "singing
about switchblades." etc.
"Take a low ride with me, girl,"
he pleads, trying to interest her
in his gambling ways. Fatal
istically. the singer lets the girl
go in the end. singing "I could
have caught up with her easy
enough But something must
have made me stay." Almost to
console himself. Knopfler then
launches into one of the few
lengthy guitar solos on the rec
ord. beginning softly and ending
in renewed exhilaration, as if
he's ready to go searching for
love again
But Knopfler hasn't quite told
his heartbreaking story yet. In
"Romeo and Juliet," the singer
returns to his lover but finds
that her success has ended their
once-shared dream. In an
aching voice, he asks:
/ dreamed your dream for you
And now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if
I teas just another one of your
deals?
But it's just another scene to
the woman, and she ignores the
singer's torment, leaving
Knopfler to sing, in a hoarse

whisper, accompanied only by
an acoustic guitar:
I can't do the talk
l.ike they talk on the TV
And I can t do a love song
The tray it's meant to be. . .
And all I do is kiss you
Hetu een the bars of a rhyme
Julie, I'd do the stars n ith you
anytime.
"Romeo and Juliet" is an
almost perfect love play in min
iature; it's also the best song
Mark Knopfler has ever writ
ten
The record never quite
reaches the level of passion in
"Romeo and Juliet' again but
there are other special mo
ments. In "Espresso Love" an
exhilarated Knopfler leads Dire
Straits through a rave-up, sing
ing of ecstatic lovers who never
get enough of each other. And in

On their new records espe

share an affinity for movies and
the culture ot movies. To be

people's romantic dreams, and
Zevon s preoccupied with their
nightmares — but they share a
passion exhibited by precious

for Zevon. who's been trapped in

lyrics instantly identify him as

The tragedy of Warren Zevon

But it's with a new song. "The
Sin." that Zevon takes his talent
to another level In this ma
chine-gun style rocker. Zevon
begins to get to the heart of the
matter; it's a song of betrayal,
and you feel the pure anger in
the singer's voice. "I'm talking
about the time that you were
cruel for cruelty's sake," Zevon
screams, asking "How you gon

And Zevon squeezes so much
pleasure out ot his hoarse yells
in "Lawyers, Guns and Money
that you feel as if you're re
discovering the song
But it's with a new song. "The
Sin." that Zevon takes his talent
to another level In this ma
chine-gun style rocker. Zevon
begins to get to the heart of the
matter; it's a song of betrayal,
and you feel the pure anger in
the singer's voice. "I'm talking
about the time that you were
cruel for cruelty's sake," Zevon
screams, asking "How you gon
na pay for the sin" — his
punctuating, demanding growl
"hunh°!" rips into your heart
If "The Sin" is a climactic
moment, the encore number
"Bo Diddley's a Gunslinger" is
a final reassurance — a sign that
Zevon still has a grin on his face
and a rifle in his hand
Zevon compares rock per
formers to Western outlaws;
Mark Knopfler sees them as
warm-hearted troubadours.
Dire Straits' new record. Mak
ing Mocies. represents the
band's most fully realized work
to date. For the tirst time. Dire
Straits has been given the feel of
a real band — the band is finally
something more than a guitar
genius and his backing musi
cians.
Much of the credit for this
should probably go to Jimmy
lovine. who's creating quite a
reputation for himself with his

work here and with Bruce
Springsteen. Tom Petty and
Graham Parker lovine is the
first producer to create some
tension and drama between
Knopfler and bassist John 11-
Isley and drummer Pick
Withers The big backbeat re
places the convivial folksy
sound of Dire Straits' first two
records, giving the band more of
a true rock sound Also, rhythm
guitarist David Knopfler has
been replaced, at least for this
effort, by E Street Band pianist
Roy Bittan. who gives the rec
ord added color and verve
Where the tirst two Dire
Straits records ambled, this one
prances lovine gives the the
songs crescendos and small mo
ments to be savored; the dulling
sameness of the first two rec
ords is gone.
Knopfler's singing completes
the transformation He
chuckles, roars, sighs, whis
pers. snarls and begs — it's an
astonishing performance from
someone who's natural vocal
abilities are so limited You feel
the heat here — Knopfler
breathes life and fire into his
characters.
The self-consciousness of the
album's title applies both to
Knopfler and the characters he
creates. Knopfler lifts the
scenes and moods for the songs
from Romeo and ■Juliet and
Cabaret, among others; the
characters are continually pos
ing as actors starring in their
own fantasy plays, but the
smallness of their stage gives
them a human, vulnerable qual
itv.
As the singer. Knopfler plays
a host ot different roles. In "Les

Boys' he s a snide essayist, up
dating Cabaret for "disco bars
in Germany " He's also an ob
server in "Skateaway." watch
ing in amusement as a zestful
young girl roller skates through
the city, listening to rock on the
radio and dreaming her own
"movies on location."
But it's when the singer is a
vital participant that the songs
really begin to matter to us. At
the start of the opening number.
"Tunnel of Love." Knopfler is
almost autobiographical, brief
ly recalling his past "singing
about switchblades." etc.
"Take a low ride with me, girl,"
he pleads, trying to interest her
in his gambling ways. Fatal
istically. the singer lets the girl
go in the end. singing "I could
have caught up with her easy
enough But something must
have made me stay." Almost to
console himself. Knopfler then
launches into one of the few
lengthy guitar solos on the rec
ord. beginning softly and ending
in renewed exhilaration, as if
he's ready to go searching for
love again
But Knopfler hasn't quite told
his heartbreaking story yet. In
"Romeo and Juliet," the singer
returns to his lover but finds
that her success has ended their
once-shared dream. In an
aching voice, he asks:
/ dreamed your dream for you
And now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if
I teas just another one of your
deals?
But it's just another scene to
the woman, and she ignores the
singer's torment, leaving
Knopfler to sing, in a hoarse

whisper, accompanied only by
an acoustic guitar:
I can't do the talk
l.ike they talk on the TV
And I can t do a love song
The tray it's meant to be. . .
And all I do is kiss you
Hetu een the bars of a rhyme
Julie, I'd do the stars n ith you
anytime.
"Romeo and Juliet" is an
almost perfect love play in min
iature; it's also the best song
Mark Knopfler has ever writ
ten
The record never quite
reaches the level of passion in
"Romeo and Juliet' again but
there are other special mo
ments. In "Espresso Love" an
exhilarated Knopfler leads Dire
Straits through a rave-up, sing
ing of ecstatic lovers who never
get enough of each other. And in
"Solid Rock, Knopfler de
livers the scattershot, jumbled
lyrics with manic joy.
The warmth and the depth of
feeling in Ma king Movies re
calls John Huston in a romantic
mood Stand in the Fire is more
reminiscent of the dark, yet ec
static vision of Sam Peckinpah
Knopfler's passion is the kind
that breaks your heart; Zevon's
intention is to rip your heart out.
They both could be great mov
iemakers.
