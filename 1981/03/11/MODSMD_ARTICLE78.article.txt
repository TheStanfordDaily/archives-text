# Underground smorgasbord: S.F.'s new wave mags

"And I looked at the scenery.
She read her magazine
— Paul Simon
Video may have killed the ra
dio stars, but in San Francisco,
at least, underground journal
ism still leads a lively, if pre
carious, existence. Hidden
away, in dilapidated suburban
garages, bedrooms of cheap
downtown studios, or low-rent
offices on noisy thoroughfares,
various magazines throw their
pages out onto a community not
always receptive to alter
native creativity. Spurred by
the success of the now-defunct
Los Angeles Free l*ress in the
late '60s. the West Coast has wit
nessed innumerable odd maga
zines and tabloids come and go.
Some lasted a few years, some
yellowed on the back shelves of
cheap newsstands. Only four
years ago, Francis Ford Cop
pola invested $2 million in City
magazine in San Francisco. You
don't see City on the newsstands
today. Magazine journalism is a
cut-throat business, yet some
diehards still slave away, im
pervious to bad odds and a fickle
reading public. Here is a sample
of some of the most notable al

ternative magazines and
tabloids in and around San Fran
cisco.
Wet
Although Wet magazine pub
lishes out of Santa Monica, this
L A decadent-chic production
finds a receptive audience with
Bay Area jet setters who live in
townhouses on Russian Hill and
woodsy condos in Marin. Wet
wants to shock intelligently.
The March/April issue sports a
cover drawing of two pigs (one
blue, one red) copulating. The
lead story interviews Helmut
Newton, an avant-garde photog
rapher who Time labelled "The
King of Kink." Wet offers us a
selection of Newton's photogra
phy, ranging from a woman in
garters with a horse saddle
strapped on her back, to naked,
sweaty blondes lifting weights,
to close-ups of lesbian foreplay
over a toilet. Newton claims, "I
don't have an exotic fantasy
life," so I presume his daily rou
tine is pretty wild. But what can
you expect from someone who
calls LA. smog "a lovely
mist?" Wet continues with
rather routine analyses of
modern music and architecture.

BOOKS

A story of John Duncan, how
ever, an artist who indulged in
necrophelia and then had a
vasectomy (Wet offers a photo
of the operation) makes the
Newton interview appear fun
loving and innocent. Wet em
ploys reasonably standard lay
out techniques, although they
sometimes use diluted New
Wave, off-center graphics and
photos.
Fallout
Fallout labels itself "a maga
zine of surreal sarcasm." Pub
lished by a cadre of supposedly
militant anarchists in Fairfax,
up in Marin, Fallout takes aim
at the usual radical targets: the
draft, nuclear war, and of
course, Reagan's election.
Fallout interviews the Dead
Kennedy's on their political
radicalism ("Reagan'll proba
bly turn america (sic) into an
Argentina-like police state,")
quotes various revolutionaries
freely ("It's right to rebel,")
and satirically destroys de
mocracy, imperialism, capital
ism, and all concerns of
bourgeoise American culture.
The editors obviously work on
slim funds, since Fallout prints
on cheap paper and uses normal
typewriters instead of type
setter print. The writing may
reflect the editors' anarchistic
sentiments, but the rejection of
linguistic authority results in
some grammatical atrocities
that would provoke insanity in a
Freshman English TA, and in
duces poetry that makes Rich
ard Brautigan sound like Keats:
"Blessed are the credit

slaves/For they shall say
Charge It.' "
Graphically. Fallout looks
like someone went crazy in the
paste-up room. Freely using
punk lettering, adapting an Ed
ward Munch painting for its cov
er, and crucifying Jesus on a
dollar bill, well, shocks and
puzzles. And that's exactly what
Fallout wants to do. Hardly any
thing lies straight or on center in
the tabloid, and the art editor
effectively mixes old '50s photo
graphs with drawings of new po
litical figures to parody the
American cliches of freedom
and happiness. Alas, they give
themselves away. Fallout needs
advertising money. After an is
sue of systematic destruction of
the capitalist myth, Fallout. the
vaunted revolutionary anar
chist magazine, has to ask for
the big green. "Don't just stand
there, do something about it!
Fight Back! Advertise in
Fallout! ($3O/half page.)
REsearch
While Fallout examines the
political concerns of the modern
world, REsearch fuses radical
politics, eastern mysticism, and
the new wave ethic, and takes
off for the stars. The cover
photo of the March issue sets the
stage: a double exposure shot of
a woman's eyes looking sky
ward, with a flowing, contorted
beam of white light meeting her
gaze. REsearch, initially named
Search <£ Destroy, began in the
late '70s, along with a rash of
other magazines responding to
the new punk movement in the
city, centered at the Mabuhav

Gardens Like Wet, which ap
peals to an avant-garde au
dience, and like Fallout, with its
radical politics, REsearch mix
es differing elements of counter
culture with one difference it
does it intelligently REsearch
spends most of its pages in
terviewing progressive English
bands who voice their reactions
to America, international poli
tics, who explain their ideol
ogical and musical roots Tak
ing the obligatory pot-shots at
corporate executives and
mercenary soldiers, REsearch
throws itself firmly in the radi
cal trenches. They voice a new
political philosophy (at least
I've never heard of it) called
"Situationism." a type of neo
anarchism which (or so they
claim) finds its roots in Russian
Formalism and unitarianism
The editors here like "isms."
Throwing out slogans like "Real
Estate is Theft," "The class
War will end All Wars." Guns
Don't Kill, Politicians Do," and
"Socialists Are Sheeps In
Wolves' Clothing," REsearch
tries to provoke non-subjective,
radical thought, because, to the
editors, "individual revolution
breeds revolutionary individ
uals." REsearch, if only by vir
tue of its complicated futurist
political philosophy and often
artistic lay-out. is a big step
ahead of the normal radical rag
sheet These editors don't spend
all their time glorifying them
selves. You have to appreciate
people who label punks "hippies
with amnesia."
Punk Globe
A bunch of New Wave
groupies who sleep on the side
walks of Broadway outside the
Mabuhay Gardens must be re
sponsible for the monthly Funk
Globe A closet production,
I'unk (11 oh e simply acts as a
new wave Fan Club newsletter
The Globe mainly lists concert
dates of little-known local new
wave bands, and gives inside in
formation on band personnel
changes, new albums, and other
matters of interest to afi
cionados. All the photos are
taken bv one Julie Stein, and all
the articles written by John
Balano. I have a sneaking suspi
cion that they do the whole lay
out as well. The (Unhe is no
large-scale production. The
writing really offends: each
page seems to compete with the
next for new types of misspell
ings and destructions of the lan
guage The articles glorify local
bands and punk-radio KUSF (91
FM in the city) and complain

about the fact that not every ra
dio station plays only new wave
The lav-out's not even punk It's
just boring I don't know where
these people get otf charging
one dollar for this throwaway.
but somebody must read it, be
cause the I! lobe's been on the
newsstands tor over a year
Boulevards
The subtitle of Boulevards
used to be "not just another San
Francisco magazine." Two
months ago, the editors changed
the logo and added a new subti
tle: "The San Francisco maga
zine Of all the "alternative''
publications, Boulevards dis
plays the most professional abil
ities, the best writing, and the
most creative lay-out.
Boulevards doesn't tie itself
down to any punk or political
ideology: it's a "general in
terest" work with liberal politi
cal flares, and a chic, diluted
New Wave look The best pages
in Boulevards often are the in
triguing and original ads tor the
fashionable and ultra-expensive
clothing stores in the city.
Boulevards has intelligent and
exhaustive film reviews
fa/most every film playing in
town is given a review) and a
critical analysis of the current

music scene that doesn't rely
only on New Wave bands. Other
monthly sections include fine
arts, television, and occasional
book reviews. Boulevards often
tails into rather precocious
writing, yet on the whole, it en
lists the more notable freelance
journalists in San Francisco.
The real acclaim for
Boulevards. though, comes
from the tact that, unlike its
"underground' compatriots,
the magazine has matured since
its inception in 1979. While the
other magazines stick with one
formula, and flog that formula
mercilessly, issue after issue.
Boulevards has changed its look
and focus, and improved its
graphics and writing in an effort
to reach a wider and more in
telligent audience. Some people
call that selling out, but in
Boulevards' case, its seems
more like the result of sustained
effort to create a magazine that
isn't just a platform for the edi
tors' obscure dogmas.
You can find some of these
magazines at Mac's Smoke Shop
in Palo Alto (near Emerson and
University). For the small ones.
though, try City Lights book-
Store in San Francisco, near the
corner of Columbusand Pacific.



Wet's fashion page features an inflatable Chinese hat ("quick think
ing!") available in red, white or blue at Zoe's in San Francisco.
