Bella Vista is what my family used to call a "plastic"
restaurant. This label isn't intended to be derogatory —
far from it. It only means that you pay with plastic if you
possibly can. because the sight of so much cash floating by
—and away— will move you to tears otherwise.
This almost happened at the Bella Vista the other night.
A dinner for two, covering appetizers, soup, entrees, des
sert and a good wine cost $63 without a tip. Was it worth it?
That depends partly on whose name is on the credit card,
of course, but it also depends on how much time you have
to spend Dinner at the Bella Vista isn't just dinner, it's
something to be lingered over, looked forward to, and
hashed over later — it's an event, and if you like events it'll
probably be worth the price.
First, there is The Drive Bella Vista is perched on the
crest of one of the hills between the Bay and the ocean; the
approach from the Stanford side involves a long, dark,
twisty ascent which seems to host an overabundance of
creepy trees. The road is beautiful, though, and the first
time I drove it I spotted four deer.
Then there's The View. Bella Vista's named for it.and
for good reason — it's spectacular. The foreground of pitch
black — the forest you just drove through — and then the
entire South Bay spreads itself out before you like some
one's gaudy rhinestone belt. It does no good to remind
yourself that all the fragile lights down there are actually
composed of things like the Moffett Drive-In. either—
they're still beautiful.
Then there's The Restaurant, a woodsy lodge of a build
ing that's backed by redwoods and fronted with the famous

vista The inside is divided into two areas — the Forest
Room (good), the View Room (better), and the bar.
To do it right, you really should spend some time in the
bar. It's dark, it's cozy, and it has an open fireplace;
what's more (and I know you're not supposed to mention
things like this in reviews of classy restaurants) it has a
wonderful juke box with a real flair for the eclectic. For
one quarter you can hear Otis Redding. Duke Ellington,
and the Theme from the Pink Panther — all right in the
middle of the Woodside wilderness.
Okay, now The Food. Bella Vista serves Continental
food, meaning French. Italian, and American. Like the
view, it's heavy on the spectacular. Several of the salads

hypocrites: they pretend to be
healthful and light, but once the

another flimsy excuse for a good time.

are prepared at or near your table, and many of the dishes
(for example, crepes suzettes) are flambeed. In fact I
counted no fewer than five flambeeing spectacles during
the evening, each of which inspired the requisite ' oohs"
and "aahs" from the diners. From where I sat — facing
the window reflections — it was like watching Los Altos
erupt into flames five times, only to be quenched each
time by a large copper pan.
Despite the sometimes circus-like effect, the food is
very, very good, and varied to boot. We started with

Crevettes Bordelaise tor two ($8 >. It's a simple dish com
posed of scampi broiled in a thick rich wine, garlic, and
butter sauce. This may have been the highlight of the eve
ning. I'm not sure; all I know is that as soon as the plate
left (bare except for scampi tails, since I had indelicately
mopped up all the extra sauce with my bread) I felt desti
tute Other appetizers include pate, saumon fume, Oysters
Rockefeller, escargots. and two kinds of fettucini.
If you adore garlic, order the Caesar salad for two ($5 >. I
like Caesar salads because they're hypocrites: they pre
tend to be healthful and light, but once the grated Romano,
olive oil, egg yolk, and bread crumbs have been added, the
romaine lettuce becomes just another flimsy excuse tor a
good time. Bella Vista's Caesar Salad is as dishonest as
any; it's rich and powerful, and so filling that it really
should be ordered for three. In addition to the Caesar
Salad, Bella Vista offers a spinach and bacon salad (its
dressing is flambeed briefly) and two other special salads.
All of these are prepared in the dining room where you can
watch.
Most people at this juncture order either soup ($1.25) or
a more standard salad. Bella Vista's standard salad has a
good vinaigrette, but is boring; the seafood bisque, on the
other hand, is fantastic — a rich tomato cream sauce with
sherry and crab meat.
By now, we were reeling with the richness of the cream
sauces, and wondering what ever happened to la cuisine
minceur. Despair. Out of the kitchen rolled our two en
trees: Veal Oscar, and Noisettes d'Agueau Dijonnaise,
each covered with its own rich sauce.
Veal Oscar is so rich that it really ought to be served
only to consenting adults. It's veal — a thin, pink, milk-fed
veal — covered with chunks of crabmeat, covered again
with asparagus, and covered once more with a thick white
creamy sauce. Unfortunately it's one of those dishes that
sounds more exciting than it tastes. The veal was great,
the crabmeat was great, and the asparagus great: for
some reason when it was all put together, it created a con

fusing mess.
The Noisettes d'Agneau Dijonhaise was a little more
modest ; it was plain lamb noisettes cooked in a dark and
delicious mustard sauce. Both dishes came with vegeta
bles that were notable for the fact that they had (gasp > no
sauce.
Bella Vista's other entrees range from Calamari to
Canard a l'Orange with everything in between: prices
range from $7.95 for the Poulet Saute Sec to $27.00 for Veal
Saltimbocca for two, another rich, and highly recom
mended, production involving veal, proscuitto, and
cheese. Judging from the number of dishes offered, veal is
a Bella Vista specialty; certainly, from what we sampled,
it was wonderful.
Stretchers were indicated at this point; unfortunately
we were already committed. Dessert souffles take 45
minutes to cook, and must be ordered at the beginning of
the meal: once started, there is no retraction.
As it turned out, worse things could have happened: next
to the crevettes and the soup, the dessert souffle was the
best part of the meal. Ours was a Grand Marnier souffle
for two ($8) which rose to double the size of its dish and
then sank beneath a blanket of — you guessed it —
custardy rich Grand Marnier sauce. It was fantastic.
Other deserts include Bella Vista's chocolate (and occa
sionally strawberry) souffles, and, for the more spectacle
oriented, their Crepes Suzettes and Cerrises Jubilee, both
flam heed. For the less imaginative, there are Creme
Caramel, Cheesecake, and Chocolate Mousse to choose
from. And then — thank God — there's coffee, to keep you
awake for the long drive home.
If Bella Vista were less sophisticated it would fall into
the category of funky. It's out in the middle of nowhere,
relatively informal, and has a great kitchen. It even has a
good jukebox. But funky it ain't: it's too sophisticated and
too expensive. It is a great place for a blow-out, however,
and one that I recommend highly for when the parents are
in town. Just don't forget the plastic.
