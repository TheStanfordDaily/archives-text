# Facilities and Services to reshuffle personnel
## 
### Richard Klingler 
The turbulent Facilities and Ser
vices department is undergoing
changes in organization, apportion
ment of responsibilities, and man
agement personnel that include the
dispersion of the responsibilities of its
Design and Construction division.
When all the changes are im
plemented, the Design and Construc
tion division will no longer supervise
University project management, ov
ersee the quality of architectural de
sign, administer constructionor con
trol contracts.
The bulk of the Design and Con
struction division s responsibilities —
management of Facilities and Ser
vices projects — will be assumed by
the newly created Project Man
agement Division.
The Facilities and Services Engi
neering division will be responsible
for the quality of architectural design,
and the Procurement Department will
control contracting.
Control of construction adminis
tration has yet to be determined
Amy Blue, who was named last

week the new Director of Project
Management, will assume many of
the duties held by former Design and
Construction Director Peter Hopf,
who said he is now considering posi
tions both within the Engineering
division of the Facilities and Services
Department and outside of the Univer
sity.
Jason Mavis, Facilities and Ser
vices Director, claimed responsibility
for the organizational changes and
said they were intended to create "a
stronger institutional general man
agement" to direct Stanford's Facil
ities and Services
Mavis said that the Design and Con
struction division "served an earlier
Stanford" but that the new structure
is necessary to meet the needs of a
much larger and more complex in
stitution
Both Marvis and Hopf said that it
may take a few months for the or
ganizational changes to take effect
and for — in Hopf's words — "respon
sibilities and divisions to harden "
Disagreements between Hopf and
Mavis prompted the change in Hopf's
