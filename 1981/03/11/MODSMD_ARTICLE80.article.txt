E: YcA don t want to go bach
there, do you?
S: Well . .. yeah
E: What do you find so appeal
ing"'
S: 1 don't know, maybe the at
mosphere. The '70s rustic look
You know, the wood paneling,
the old prints and posters that
were supposed to look quasi-

Gold Rush framed on the walls.
The Ny fan. the antique gas
pump outside, the genuinely
wilted real flowers on the
table. . .
E: In the vase with the fake
fern Do you remember the
food?
S: Ah yes, the seafood platter,
drowning in butter Or the corn
Sort of mushy, with a edge of ov
erripeness to it Tasted sort of
fermented Would have made
good grain alcohol
E: They had a great salad bar.
though The artichoke hearts
were an elegant touch, as was
the old. ice-filled bathtub the
salad bar was in. And although
the food was a little heavy on the
butter, my mahi-mahi was
more than adequate.
S: That is all true. The shrimps
in my seafood platter (not a reg
ular offering) were succulent,
and even if there were only two
of them and the scallops were
somewhat scant, and even if the
platter was a little fishy, on the
whole I did enjoy it.
E: I have, however, seen more
solicitous service. They were a
bit slow We could have memo
rized the menu by the time they
finally took our order.
S: I don't think that's fair. Poor
Jack, our waiter, had half the
tables in the place to wait on —
even if that is only six of them.
And he was pretty conscientious
■ about asking us if "things" were
OK. So what if he was wearing

a Lacoste shirt'.'
E: Actually, the size of the es
tablishment was cozy. And
there are a lot of things we could
try the second time around, like
the chicken terivaki or the stack
of ribs. Maybe this time the
catch of the day won't be red
snapper.

'/ have often seen a strawberry without a
strawberry cheesecake, but never a straw
berry cheesecake without a strawberry."

S: Yeah, and maybe next week
gas will be 30 cents a gallon But
seriously, their meals have lit
tle to offer besides the meat or
fish. The vegetables are very
much second-class food. Yes,
the rice was acceptable, but
with some imagination you can
do more with rice than just put
carrots and celery in
E: Especially considering the
prices they charge. 1 mean,
come on. $5.25 for "Fish and
Fries?" Or $10 tor top sirloin?
S: There were some relative
bargains, though. The $6 mahi
mahi filet, for instance and, uh.
er, well, if you give me a week.
I might think of another one.
What really got me, though, was
the coffee. They said it was
filter coffee by Folger's, but it

could have been instant by San
ka for the way it tasted
E: I've often seen a strawberry
without a strawberry
cheesecake, but never a straw
berry cheesecake without a
strawberry. Like a Cheshire
cat. you know"' It was very rich,
but it bore a remarkable re

semblance to a block of Phila
delphia cream cheese
S: It iras a tad heavy. But so
were the people there — either
rich young Portola Valley types
or balding middle-aged accoun
tants.
E: And even if the Inn is small,
8 o'clock seemed awfully early
tor them to be running out of
things. It's 7:30 already; we bet
ter go somewhere else. And
without reservations at the Inn
(they don't take them), we
might have to wait in the bar for
a while.
S: OK. let's get a sandwich at
the Coffee House. I wonder it
their Sunday champagne brunch
is any better?
