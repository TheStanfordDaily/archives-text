Andes Mexican Restaurant

It's a little farther than you would normally
drive for a taco But those who are tired of ex
pensive. Americanized Mexican food may find
Andes a welcome change.
Andes is a small and unassuming restaurant
situated on "Whiskey Gulch, as the far end of
University Avenue is called No bright neon
signs or large sombreros advertize outside the
quiet establishment. Not surprisingly, the in
side atmosphere is peaceful and relaxing
Baskets of ferns and vases of flowers give a
fresh, open-air charm to the small room
Green cloths cover the tables The owner
seems to have a penchant for art A shelf full of
art books occupies one corner And paintings,
most of which are for sale, are spread over the
plain white walls.
Our waiter, a native of Guadalajara,
brought two round tortilla chips topped with
hot sauce, onions and parsley. This seemed to
substitute for the bowl of nacho chips custom
ary at Mexican restaurants here
We ordered the nacho appetizer and re
ceived an interesting and pleasant variation of
the standard fare — nachos of cheese and
green chiles atop chips. A unique sauce, which
the Mexican owner. Mr. Andes, called mole,
amply covered the chips, cheese and retried
beans. The brown sauce was pungent and rich,
consisting of ground nuts, bitter chocolate,
various chiles, dried peppers and spices The
thick mixture had almost the texture of peanut
butter.
The menu featured about a dozen entrees, in
addition to appetizers, desserts and alcoholic
and nonalcoholic drinks. Prices are extremely
reasonable — the Palo Alto, a combination of a
chile relleno. tamale. taco. rice and beans, is
the most expensive entree at $4.25.
Other entrees ranged from Mexican-style
eggs to chicken tostadas to flautas with
tiuncamolc. We ordered qm'sadillas ($1.45)
and the Whiskey Gulch ($3.401
The Whiskey Gulch was an ample meal con
sisting of an enchilada and a taco. accom
panied by rice and beans. The generous filling
tasted quite good The mole sauce, apparently
something of an Andes trademark, covered the

entree
The quesadillas consisted of five small, flat,
pie-shaped wedges of soft tortilla Each little
envelope contained a small portion of cheese
and was topped with red hot sauce and parsley
Fortunately, rice and beans did not come
with this mini-dish We were ready for des
sert!
The Mango Sunday i guess which day we vis
ited Andes' i and a piece of mango and carrot
cake were our final choices. We were disap
pointed at tinding canned mangos in our des
serts. but mangos of consistently good quality
are hard to find in this area
Hot imported Cuban rum was poured over
both desserts. And the raisins, sprinkled atop
the cake, may even have been marinated in the
drink They were exotic and exciting dishes!
Andes is open for dinner seven days a week
Lunch is served 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. every day but
Saturday. (Owner Andes runs a virtual one
man operation and must take one afternoon
off.)
The restaurant, which has been open for five
years, can hold about 30 people But only two
other diners were present during our Sunday
afternoon meal Reservations are taken but
definitely not needed.
For an authentic Mexican meal tor well
below the going price. Andes is worth driving a
few extra blocks down University Avenue
