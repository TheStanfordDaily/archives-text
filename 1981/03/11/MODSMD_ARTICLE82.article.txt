This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some

you feel that you've really cap

heartbreak comes, the movie
glides through showbiz cliche and

Sissy Spacek portrays the

This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing The characters spend their
time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — they're
practicing catharsis by the num
bers Although it's about a family
in crisis, the movie never makes
you feel that you've really cap
tured the family's heart and soul
— its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master

his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of

searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is especially good With

The characters' names are the

landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less as it
does in the book, but the soul of the
work is gone.
less' centerpiece is Nastassia
Kinski She is lovely. Looking at
her. one can almost believe that
she could, without in the least in
tending to. drive men to do terrible
deeds. But. and this is a big but,
she has an accent. It is difficult to
concentrate her character's plight
when it sounds as if she spent sum
mers on the banks of the Rhine
The ultimate responsibility, of
course, rests with director Roman
Polanski. Unable to render any
real, cinematic interpretation of
the novel, he contented himself
with dramatizing its "big mo
ments." What he forgot to do. or
what he was afraid to try, was to
offer any reason for seeing the
movie rather than staying home
