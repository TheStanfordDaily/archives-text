# Stanford to host DC dinner
## 
### Carl Johnston 
President Donald Kennedy, his
wife Jeanne, and a stellar crowd of
congressmen, top White House ad
visers and other notables will con
verge tonight on the elegant "F"
Street Club in Washington D C. and
discuss a common thread in their
lives â€” Stanford University
The dinner is "a chance for Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
to get to know the people in the ad
ministration who are affiliated
with Stanford," according to Bob
Frelen of Stanford's department of
public affairs.
Officials who have accepted
Stanford's invitation include: Sen
Henry Jackson (D-Washington),
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), and Sen Max Baucus <D-

Montana).
Other invited guests include: Su
preme Court Justice William
Rehnquist, senior domestic affairs
adviser Martin Anderson, and Sen.
Alan Cranston (D-Calif ).
All have at one time or another
been associated with Stanford
Sen. Jackson's Stanford connec
tion goes back 45 years He at
tended Stanford for one quarter in
1935. but never graduated, accord
ing to records at the alumni office
here.
During University President
Richard Lyman's administration,
Stanford sponsored four such
Washington dinners The selecton
of the "F" Street Club for three of
the four previous dinners is an in
dication that the dinner intended to

be a prestigious 'event.'
The dinner plans provide an in
sight into Stanford's subtle pres
ence in the machinery of national
government
"The point is that any university
that has top policy makers in gov
ernment will want to keep track of
them But the best way to get to
know them is in a situation where
there isn't a lot of pressure, where
they're not going to be constantly
button-holed for things,"' said
Frelen
Stanford trustee Phil Taubman,
a correspondent for The Sew York
Times who helped organize the
event, stressed that it i8 a "kind of
goodwill gesture on the part of the
University to bring together Stan
ford-connected people. It's in
teresting to see their common
backgrounds."
"In Washington there are always
lots of Stanford people around, but
you don't know who they are," ex
plained Taubman.
Discussion of politics will be
avoided, according to Frelen.
Although many issues are being
contested in Washington that may
directly affect Stanford (e.g. Pres
ident Ronald Reagan's proposal to
slash $87 million from the National
Science Foundation's budget),

these matters will be left out the
door when the guests come in, ac
cording to organizers.
"Judging from what has gone on
in the past," said Frelen, "there
has always been a hands-off poli
cy in terms of issues."
Frelen said his office began plan
ning the dinner six months ago just
after the Reagan landslide
catapulted a number of Stanford
figures into positions of authority.
At the time, said Frelen, he had no
way of knowing what sorts of posi
tions the Stanford-affiliated of
ficials would hold.
