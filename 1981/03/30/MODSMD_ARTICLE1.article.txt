# Hastorf officially designated as provost
## 
### Samuel Howe 
A search committee which sifted
through some 250 names of candidates
for the job of provost of the University
named its choice late last week. The
new provost didn't take long to move
into the office; he is there already.
Albert Hastorf, professor of psy
chology and human biology, formerly
acting provost, agreed to take over the
position last Thursday. The appoint
ment was announced by President
Donald Kennedy, who praised Hastorf
for his "extraordinary performance"
as acting provost, a position which
Hastorf held since August. In the prov
ost's position, Hastorf serves as pri
mary vice president of the University
and is second only to Kennedy in aca
demic matters.
When Kennedy named Hastorf to
fill the post Kennedy left to take over
the presidency, Hastort, 60, had said
that he wanted to serve for only one
year and then return to other duties at
Stanford.
However, Hastorf said yesterday
that he "found it fun working with
Don" and that he was "deeply con
cerned" about federal funding cuts to
higher education which have put a
squeeze on the Stanford budget, and
that he had decided to stay as provost.

I meant what I said when I came
on,' he added.
Apparently, the relationship be
tween Kennedy and Hastorf is a strong
one, and Hastorf changed his mind
about staying while in the acting prov
ost's job. Both were founders of Stan
ford's program in human biology,
which Kennedy headed, and Hastorf
emphasized that Kennedy was "im
portant' to his original decision to
serve as acting provost.
Hastorf served as chair of the Fac
ulty Senate in 1979-80 and as head of
the Advisory Board, which considers
all proposed tenure appointments, in
1978-79.
He served as chairman of the Psy
chology Dept. from 1961 to 1970 and as
dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences from 1970 to 1974 He also
was the director of the Boys Town
Center for Youth Development at
Stanford from 1975 until last summer.
Hastorf was the first choice of a
search committee headed by Biology
Prof. Norm Wessells. Wessells said
the search was "exceedingly thor
ough, ' with some 100 candidates from
within the University and 150 others.
Political Science Prof. Nan
Keohane. chair of the Faculty Senate
this year, said that Hastorf's appoint

ment was "splendid," and that he had
done a "skillful job" of presenting the
budget to the Senate, his major re
sponsibility relative to that body.
The provost said last night his first
academic priority would be to deal
with the funding squeeze spurred on by
recent cuts in the federal budget Ac
cording to Hastorf, the cuts to aid for
both undergraduates and graduates
are "substantially serious," and that
aid for research, particularly in the
social sciences, is also threatened
As acting provost, Hastorf has re
viewed proposed budget guidelines
with the Faculty Senate and has ad
vanced new guidelines for student ac
ademic grievances and a formal poli

cy on sexual harassment at the Uni
versity. Kennedy named Hastorf head
of the new Cabinet on Undergraduate
Education.
Hastorf is an Amherst graduate
with master's and doctorate degrees
from Princeton University.
Rumors in recent months that
Hastorf was being considered for the
presidency of Tulane University were
"rumors to me also," Hastorf said
yesterday. According to sources at
Tulane, Hastorf was part of a pool of
about 300 candidates but however seri
ously he considered or was considered
for the position, he is not one of three
finalists who are now being con
sidered for that presidency.
