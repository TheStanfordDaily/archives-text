# Bay Area dump sites to shrink by one-third
## State face waste-disposal dangers

. . . the biggest problem, according to
I rumbull, is that of explosive natural gas.
He cited a dump in Los A ngeles with
emissions so high that the air in the area is
comprised of 30percent natural gas.

"I think the economic future
of our country depends on get
ting people to quit throwing
away so much," said Terry
Trumbull, chairman of the State
Solid Waste Management
Board, in an interview with the
Daily.
Trumbull, who was appointed
to the Board by Governor Jerry
Brown, said the Board was set
up in 1972 with the main function
of overseeing all the dumps in
the state. In 1978, the Board
gained the added responsi
bilities of exploring alternative
uses of wastes, and encouraging
recycling.
In overseeing the safety of all
the dumps in the state, the big
gest problem, according to
Trumbull, is that of explosive
natural gas. He cited a dump in
Los Angeles with emissions so
high that the air in the area is

comprised of 30 percent natural
gas.
Explained Trumbull, a level
of natural gas above 15 percent
will not explode, but it will burn.
Once the amount of natural gas
in the air is between 5 and 15 per
cent, an explosion can occur
If there are high winds in the
area that dissipate the gas from
the dump and blow it towards
residential neighborhoods, an
explosion is likely. Said Trum
bull, "If the wind blows the
wrong way, and someone lights
a cigarette, their whole house
goes."
Spot inspections
The Board recently made a
surprise inspection of the 140
dump sites in California, and 31
of the sites inspected had vio
lations of federal health codes.
Trumbull expressed concern
over these results, saying, "And
we are considered to have the
best (wasteresources) program
in the country."
Landfill sites are also a con
cern of the Board, and Trumbull
feels that this is of special in
terest to San Franciscans. The
dump site for San Francisco will
be closed down in two years.
The nearest new dumpsite is 55
miles away, 17 miles further
than the present site, which is 38
miles away.
"It costs money to transport
waste. San Franciscans will be
spending more money on their
garbage when the present dump
site closes," said Trumbull.
Up to one-third of the landfill
sites (dumps) in the Bay Area
will be closed down in the near
future, said Trumbull. This is an

important factor of the Board's
other responsibiliies of en
couraging alternative disposal
of wastes, and recycling. With
existing dump sites closing, and
few new sites proposed for the
future, Californians need to
minimize their waste, and im
prove present recycling and
waste managment programs.
Main concerns
Trumbull cited four areas of
concern for improving waste
management and waste energy
systems:
— Reducing the waste that oc
curs. Trumbull stressed the
need for more efficient pack
aging of products, with manu
facturers keeping in mind the
waste that may be created by
their packaging, and encourag
ing interest in recycling and
saving energy.
— Reusing materials. Several
states presently have 'bottle
bills,' which levy a five-cent
charge on all bottles, and help
ensure their return. According
to Trumbull, such a bill en
courages recycling and re-us
ing, along with helping to min
imize litter. This sort of bill has
been proposed several times in
the California legislature, but
are fiercely opposed by bot
tlemakers. and has only once
made it out of committee. The
Peninsula Conservation Core, a
Palo Alto group concerned with
environmental issues, is pres
ently attempting to place a 'bot
tle bill' on the ballot by the in
itiative process.
— Burning waste to obtain
energy. Trumbull is a strong
supporter of this method of re
source recovery, and even men
tioned a proposal that was made
to the University to burn gar
bage at the campus heating
plant, which presently burns
fossil fuels. Stated Trumbull,
"Waste burns cleaner than oil,
and helps cut down costs."

— Minimizing landfill sites.
"We need to use our waste (by
burning) instead of storing it,"
explained Trumbull. "I think
it's impossible for a landfill to
be managed so that no problems
arise."
Recycling programs
Recycling, according to
Trumbull, "Is something every
single one of us can do." He ad
vocates curbside recycling pro
grams. which produce an ten
fold increase in recycling
Statewide, with a curbside
program, recycling would in
crease from2 to2opercent. "We
estimate that if Californians re
cycled all newspapers, cans and
bottles, we would save 150 mil
lion gallons of oil a year," said
Trumbull. He added "That's 4
percent of California's entire
energy use."
Trumbull was recently ap
pointed by President Jimmy
Carter to the nine-member Na
tional Committee on Resource
Conservation and Recovery.
Said Trumbull of the Commit
tee, "I think we're going to have
a very significant national
voice."
The Committee recommends
various policy measures to the
President and to the Congress,
mainly in the area of hazardous
waste (as opposed to municipal
waste).
Describing the treatment of
hazardous waste Trumbull said,
"The whole country has a sys
tem of treating things after they
go wrong." He continued, "We
desperately need to get focused
on a preventive medicine pro
gram."
Trumbull advocates the sys
tem which requires each county
to keep track of the hazardous
waste produced within it's
borders. At present, stated
Trumbull, "There is no require
ment that a county know what's
happening to its waste."

cern of the Board, and Trumbull
feels that this is of special in
terest to San Franciscans. The
dump site for San Francisco will
be closed down in two years.
The nearest new dumpsite is 55
miles away, 17 miles further
than the present site, which is 38
miles away.
"It costs money to transport
waste. San Franciscans will be
spending more money on their
garbage when the present dump
site closes," said Trumbull.
Up to one-third of the landfill
sites (dumps) in the Bay Area
will be closed down in the near
future, said Trumbull. This is an

important factor of the Board's
other responsibiliies of en
couraging alternative disposal
of wastes, and recycling. With
existing dump sites closing, and
few new sites proposed for the
future, Californians need to
minimize their waste, and im
prove present recycling and
waste managment programs.
Main concerns
Trumbull cited four areas of
concern for improving waste
management and waste energy
systems:
— Reducing the waste that oc
curs. Trumbull stressed the
need for more efficient pack
aging of products, with manu
facturers keeping in mind the
waste that may be created by
their packaging, and encourag
ing interest in recycling and
saving energy.
— Reusing materials. Several
states presently have 'bottle
bills,' which levy a five-cent
charge on all bottles, and help
ensure their return. According
to Trumbull, such a bill en
courages recycling and re-us
ing, along with helping to min
imize litter. This sort of bill has
been proposed several times in
the California legislature, but
are fiercely opposed by bot
tlemakers. and has only once
made it out of committee. The
Peninsula Conservation Core, a
Palo Alto group concerned with
environmental issues, is pres
ently attempting to place a 'bot
tle bill' on the ballot by the in
itiative process.
— Burning waste to obtain
energy. Trumbull is a strong
supporter of this method of re
source recovery, and even men
tioned a proposal that was made
to the University to burn gar
bage at the campus heating
plant, which presently burns
fossil fuels. Stated Trumbull,
"Waste burns cleaner than oil,
and helps cut down costs."

— Minimizing landfill sites.
"We need to use our waste (by
burning) instead of storing it,"
explained Trumbull. "I think
it's impossible for a landfill to
be managed so that no problems
arise."
Recycling programs
Recycling, according to
Trumbull, "Is something every
single one of us can do." He ad
vocates curbside recycling pro
grams. which produce an ten
fold increase in recycling
Statewide, with a curbside
program, recycling would in
crease from2 to2opercent. "We
estimate that if Californians re
cycled all newspapers, cans and
bottles, we would save 150 mil
lion gallons of oil a year," said
Trumbull. He added "That's 4
percent of California's entire
energy use."
Trumbull was recently ap
pointed by President Jimmy
Carter to the nine-member Na
tional Committee on Resource
Conservation and Recovery.
Said Trumbull of the Commit
tee, "I think we're going to have
a very significant national
voice."
The Committee recommends
various policy measures to the
President and to the Congress,
mainly in the area of hazardous
waste (as opposed to municipal
waste).
Describing the treatment of
hazardous waste Trumbull said,
"The whole country has a sys
tem of treating things after they
go wrong." He continued, "We
desperately need to get focused
on a preventive medicine pro
gram."
Trumbull advocates the sys
tem which requires each county
to keep track of the hazardous
waste produced within it's
borders. At present, stated
Trumbull, "There is no require
ment that a county know what's
happening to its waste."
. . . the biggest problem, according to
I rumbull, is that of explosive natural gas.
He cited a dump in Los A ngeles with
emissions so high that the air in the area is
comprised of 30percent natural gas.

"I think the economic future
of our country depends on get
ting people to quit throwing
away so much," said Terry
Trumbull, chairman of the State
Solid Waste Management
Board, in an interview with the
Daily.
Trumbull, who was appointed
to the Board by Governor Jerry
Brown, said the Board was set
up in 1972 with the main function
of overseeing all the dumps in
the state. In 1978, the Board
gained the added responsi
bilities of exploring alternative
uses of wastes, and encouraging
recycling.
In overseeing the safety of all
the dumps in the state, the big
gest problem, according to
Trumbull, is that of explosive
natural gas. He cited a dump in
Los Angeles with emissions so
high that the air in the area is

comprised of 30 percent natural
gas.
Explained Trumbull, a level
of natural gas above 15 percent
will not explode, but it will burn.
Once the amount of natural gas
in the air is between 5 and 15 per
cent, an explosion can occur
If there are high winds in the
area that dissipate the gas from
the dump and blow it towards
residential neighborhoods, an
explosion is likely. Said Trum
bull, "If the wind blows the
wrong way, and someone lights
a cigarette, their whole house
goes."
Spot inspections
The Board recently made a
surprise inspection of the 140
dump sites in California, and 31
of the sites inspected had vio
lations of federal health codes.
Trumbull expressed concern
over these results, saying, "And
we are considered to have the
best (wasteresources) program
in the country."
Landfill sites are also a con
