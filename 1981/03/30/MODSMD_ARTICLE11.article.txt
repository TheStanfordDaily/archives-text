Jerry Russell's recent col
umn on the political clout of the
"medieval minority" (Daily,
March 3) was a funny, interest
ing — and in places even ac
curate — attack on the Moral
Majority, that curious move
ment that has caused such a stir
around the country. Russell
strenuously objects to the
bizarre social and political aims
of the Moral Majority which he
believes include driving all of
the gays of San Francisco into
the Bay and exacting tribute
from America's foreign neigh
bors in the form of minerals and
coffee beans. He points out that
the separation of Church and
State is being threatened
Russell explains all this dan
gerous torn foolery as being the
result of "medieval thinking." a
mode of thought that admits
other sources of guidance along
with human reason as a basis for
ethical and political decisions.
He laments that millions of
Americans have never heard of
the Renaissance, Darwin, Volt
aire, or Rousseau.
What is even worse is that
Christians point to the Bible as
this "other source," and for
Russell it is a poor source in
deed! He describes it as a "self
contradictory collection of an
cient tribal myths" which is
"racist, sexist, militaristic,
smug, bloodcurdling," ad in
finitum . He does not accuse it of
causing inflation, however, an
oversight that may or may not
have been intentional.
Many evangelical Christians,
including myself, are equally
concerned about the political
and social program of the Moral
Majority. It is clear that be
cause of ignorance and
dogmatism many of the leaders
of the Moral Majority do not un
derstand that the separation of
Church and State not only bene
fits that state but also helps re
tain the vitality of Christianity.
A look at history will show that
the wedding of the Church and
State has often been the kiss of

death for the authentic Chris
tian faith, turning it into a nomi
nal religion bearing little or no
resemblance to the real thing
When Russell moves, how
ever, from political analysis to
begin expounding on ethical
thinking and on biblical
criticism he shows himself to be
poorly informed and anything
but a modern thinker. He seems
to call for ethical and political
decisions based on human rea
son alone, an argument that
may have been appropriate in
the 17th and 18th centuries, but
certainly not in the 20th. The
Enlightenment dream of an eth
ical and political order based
solely on human reason has been
exposed as the sham it really is
by 20th century philosophy and
experience. Ethical systems
must begin with axioms (for ex
ample, "dishonesty is wrong")
which do not arise from reason;
reason is then applied to build
coherent and consistent sys
tems springing from these ax
ioms.
Without God, these axioms
are extremely hard to identify
— as Nietzsche and other
modern thinkers have brilliant
ly reminded us — and much of
20th century ethical thought has
been devoted to this problem.
The results have not been prom
ising on either the intellectual
front (where nihilism is often
the conclusion) or on the ex
perimental front (where ethical
systems based on "human rea
son" have produced the most
brutal and savage political sys
tems — witness Maoist China —
in recorded history).
The real question then must
be: "From where do we derive
our ethical axioms?" Russell's
rejection of the Bible as the
source of these axioms is based
on what appears to be an almost
total lack of contact with
modern biblical criticism. His
"collection of tribal myths"
statement and his contention
that any political and ethical
views can be supported from the
Bible would be ridiculed by vir-

a Christian, Jew. or atheist.
Russell's views of the Bible
went out with the early 20th cen
tury; a reading of any of
Joachim Jeremias" works
would help bring him up to date.
The Bible and an ethic based
on God are an easy whipping boy
for those who are dogmatically
secular and those who have not
done their intellectual home
work It is this combination of
dogmatism and ignorance that
we must fight against, whether
it comes in a religious or a secu
lar package.
