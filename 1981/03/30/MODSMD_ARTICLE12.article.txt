## Change 'Western Culture' from survey to education 
### 
After an extra-long summer
vacation, freshmen found them
selves relaxing and enjoy five
days of orientation frolic. But
any ideas History 1 students had
about Stanford being easy-going
ended abruptly when they ob
tained syllabuses. One week
from that day. they were sup
posed to have read Aristotle,
from "Ethics" and "Politics,"
Augustine, from "Confessions"
and "City of God," Aquinas,
from "Summa Theologica,"
and 150 pages from the text
book.
In their spare time, in addi
tion to three lectures and a dis
cussion section each week, His
tory 1 students were also ex
pected to read 14 chapters in a
textbook. The Western Ex
perience, covering over 800
years of European history.
In the same syllabus, it said
that one of the purposes of this
Western culture requirement
was "to introduce students, es
pecially freshmen, to major
works." It was quite an in
troduction. One week, students
would be "introduced" to Plato,
the Protestant Reformation,
More s "Utopia," the Northern
Renaissance, and the Discovery
of the New World. The next
week, they would be "in
troduced" to Richelieu, The
Thirty Year's War, Corneille's
"LeCid," and the crisis of the
seventeenth century. It is hard
to retain, much less understand,
all that information each week.
Usually, while doing the read
ing. students can only think of

how many pages they had left.
Often they end up skimming the
text and get at best a very "dry"
sense of the monumental work
they were supposed to be read
ing.
A common argument made
for the Western culture require
ment is tfcat it was designed es
pecially for the engineer and
pre-med types who would
orinarily miss out on a liberal
arts background and classes
like History 1. However, those
individuals are probably the
ones least likely to gain the full
benefit of such a time-consum
ing class with innumerable
problem sets due in the required
calculus, physics, and
chemistry sequences. It would
be difficult to come up with the
necessary time for history even
with a modest 15-unit schedule
of English, psychology, and cal
culus.
Another feature of the
Western culture sequence de
scribed in the syllabus for His
tory 1 was the discussion semi
nars. Most discussion groups
tend to be like a bunch of lambs
being led around by an intellec
tual master. Most freshman
have never been exposed to such
new and complex ideas or to
sharp teachers who have Ph.D.s
from schools like Princeton,
Stanford, or Oxford.
When one-fifth of the quarter
grade is based on what a student
says in class, he or she is not ex
actly going to be uninhibited.
Even if everyone were third
year law students, it would be
hard for all 17 plus the lecturer
to properly "analyze,"

"criticize," and "intellec
tualize" highly complex and im
portant works like those of
Dante, Cicero, and Descartes
each week in less than two
hours.
Student evaluation is another
aspect of the history sequence in
need of improvement. After
reading (or supposedly reading)
hundreds of pages of great
works of history, a student is
supposed to demonstrate his or
her competence with the mate
rial in one 50-minute midterm
and one three hour final for a to
tal of 60 percent of the quarter
grade; the other 40 percent is
from a three to five page paper
and the discussions mentioned
earlier.This ends up dissatisfy
ing for both the student and
probably for the lecturer who
corrects the tests.
After scribbling what usually
ends up highly ambiguous and
sloppy answers to try and cover
such broad material in such a
short time, the student wonders
why he or she even did 90 per
cent of the reading. (Was it for
enjoyment?) The teacher is
faced with the tough job of de
ciphering and grading these
"essays." If a student asked his
or her "postdoctoral lecturer"
how to improve on essay-writ
ing, the lecturer would probably
reply "experience." Ex
perience is hard to get when stu
dents write two fleeting tests a
quarter.
Despite the many flaws in the
present Western Culture pro
gram, it would be hard to argue
against it if certain changes
were made, especially with all

of the hard work put in by a dedi
cated instructional staff.
First, the course could by or
ganized in a similar fashion to
that of the freshman English in
struction, with small classes
geared to the differing abilities
and interests of students.
Second, more papers could be
required, several smaller essay
exams could be given, and ex
tended discussion sections could
be organized to provide practice
and to better allow a student to
be properly evaluated.
Third, students should be giv
en the option ,or even required,
to switch from track to track
within the Western culture pro
gram each quarter. In this way,
students • would gain an even
more varied liberal arts educa
tion, taking philosophy, history,
humanities, great works, liter
ature, and/or Western Culture
and Technology and no tracks
could be accused of being easier
or more difficult than others.
Fourth, the class could con
centrate on a shorter time peri
od and fewer works, yet still em
phasize the philosophical mas
terpieces of western culture on
the one hand and political, so
cial, and economic develop
ments on the other.'' And even if
the course did not cover 150
works, the effect would general
ly be the same.
Most important, the Western
culture requirement should not
be recommended as strongly as
it is for all first quarter
freshmen. Most students would
benefit much more from such a
"meaty" liberal arts course if
taken during the second quarter
or second year. By second quar

ter, students would have more
experience writing tests, com
municating ideas, and knowing
what to look for in the texts they
read. During the difficult ad
justment period to college life,
students could take carry-over
courses from high school like
math and English that would be
more familiar and comfortable
to them.
If it were to remain a
freshman course, certain skills
necessary to the history student
like text analysis and essay
writing could be introduced,
taught, or reviewed before the
student jumps headfirst into
Aristotle. Augustine, • Aquinas,
and the Middle Ages his or her
first week of school, trudging
blindly through most of the
quarter, missing the full benefit
from many important works.
A line in the "Grades" section
of the Approaching Stanford
book read, "Just remember, the
true measure of the value of a
course is what you get out of it."
Though most students got a
great deal out of their History 1
class first quarter in terms of
experience, enlightenment, and
exposure, some may always
feel they missed out on a great
opportunity. The material came
in such voluminous proportions,
the ideas in such varied and
complex patterns, and the time
to digest it and work with it and
analyze it so briefly, that Plato,
Dante, and Machiavelli passed
them by when they were still un
packing their suitcases. It
would have meant far more six
months later.
