Report errs
We appreciate your coverage
ot our report of the World Con
ference held in Copenhagen
1980. Unfortunately, there were
some glaring errors in the re
port which need to be corrected
First, a distinction needs to
be made between the United Na
tions official conference and the
alternative conference of Non-
Governmental Organizations.
While my remarks concen
trated on the official con
ference, Nilufer Cagaty dis
cussed the NGO forum.
Second, we were all partici
pants in one and/or the other
conference but none of us were
delegates. Delegates are people
who have been officially desig
nated by their governments to
represent their government.
Third, regarding government
delegates, I said, "The most
stark cases of misrepresenta
tion were delegates who were
wives of heads of state such as
Mrs. Sadat of Egypt and Mrs.
Marcos of the Philippines. To be
sure, delegates of governments
that have been exposed for their
repressive policies such as the
Philippines. Chile, El Salvador,
South Africa and others could
not be expectea to do justice to
feminists (or women's) con
cerns'' Here, the mistaken use
of the word "feminine" com
pletely distorts the meaning of
our discussion. I would hope
that by now people realize the
difference between feminine,
which is the description of the
role we have been expected to
play, and feminist, which refers
to a philosophy and strategy of
social transformation.
Fourth, the next sentence in
the following paragraph was
supposed to read: "The dif
ferences, upon closer analysis,
can more appropriately be de
scribed as having between wom
en who represent themselves as
elite or middle class women
against those who identified
with and/or were working class
women, who were more ade
quately represented in the NGO
Forum."
Fifth, the fourth to the last

paragraph is supposed to read:
"For a feminist analysis to do
justice to all women of this
world, it has to deal very seri
ously with imperialism, racism
and classism (under
development as your article
stated is a result and not a cause
of these forms of oppression).
Unless these forms of op
pression are removed, women
can never be equal and free."
Sixth, the last paragraph,
again, was inaccurate, and
could read something like this:
i consider the Program of Ac
tion which came out of the of
ficial conference a very impor
tant document which can be
used as a basis to influence gov
ernments to implement the poli
cies stated therein." And in con
clusion, "I think that women
have potential power which can
with a feminist analysis be used
to bring about necessary social
transformations" (not just in
the Third World).

No to letter
Some weeks ago, Donald Ken
nedy wrote a letter to the Stan
ford faculty and staff indicating
his opposition to efforts by Stan
ford office employees to name
the United Stanford Employees
as their sole representative in
negotiations with the Univer
sity.
In that letter, Kennedy ac
knowledged that there are very
real problems associated with
the working conditions of Stan
ford office employees, ranging
from salary levels, benefits and
working conditions to career op
portunities. What the presi
dent's letter ignored, however,
is that these problems may in
dicate a conflict of interest be
tween Stanford labor and man
agement. Instead of constitut
ing a single community, it may
well be the case that employees
in different positions in the Uni
versity structure have radically
different interests, and, cor
respondingly, that there is a
conflict within the president s

role, as between his capacity as
administrator concerned for a
"happy community," and his
capacity as key representative
of management, concerned with
institutional finance.
It is for these reasons that we,
as Stanford faculty, take objec
tion to the president's letter. We
object first, because any letter
from the University president is
likely to be read by some as the
voice of disinterested wisdom
instead of particular interests,
thus discrediting the union's
arguments. And we object sec
ond, because we believe that
University office workers may
in fact have interests that the
University administration is un
likely to give properly serious
account.
