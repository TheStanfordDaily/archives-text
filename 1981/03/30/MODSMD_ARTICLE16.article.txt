## Final Abscam trial to begin today 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The last and
perhaps the most complicated
of the Abscam bribery trials is
scheduled to begin in a federal
courtroom in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
today when Sen. Harrison Wil
liams (D-N.J.) faces charges
that he sold his office to under
cover FBI agents in return for
future profits from a titanium
mine.
Unlike the previous Abscam
trials, which have resulted in
the conviction of six House
members, there is no allegation
that Williams accepted money
from the undercover agents,
who posed as representatives of
Arab sheiks and recorded their
transactions on videotape.
The indictment says instead
that Williams, the third mem
ber of the Senate in 40 years to
face criminal charges, agreed
to seek government contracts to
benefit a titanium mine in Vir
ginia if the "sheik" would lend
some friends $100 million. A sec
ond bribery count alleges that
the senator later agreed to
share in profits from a planned
sale of the mine.
Alexander Feinberg of
Cherry Hills, N.J., Williams'
longtime attorney, is a co-defen
dant.
Williams, who was the pow
erful chairman of the Senate La

bor and Human Resources Com
mittee until the Republicans
took control of the Senate this
year, has denied the charges.
He and his attorney, George
Koelzer, have found help from
an unexpected source: govern
ment attorneys who felt that un
dercover informer Melvin
Weinberg violated Williams'
constitutional rights by urging
him to boast of his influence at a
meeting with the "sheik" in
June 1979.
Edward Plaza and Robert
Weir, assistant U.S. attorneys
in New Jersey, warned Wein
berg later about his coaching
tactics, but he replied: "If I

don't put words into people's
mouths, we won't make no
cases."
The conduct of Weinberg and
two unwitting middlemen who
introduced congressmen to the
undercover agents has been the
most controversial element of
the Abscam investigation. At
one point in the Williams in
vestigation Weinberg and mid
dleman Angelo Errichetti re
portedly forged a letter.
A federal judge in Philadel
phia threw out the convictions of
two city councilmen convicted
of Abscam charges because he
said the government created the

crime and then entrapped the
targets.
Though the Williams case
wasn't before him, U.S. District
Court Judge John Fullam went
out of his way to attack the gov
ernment's treatment of the sen
ator. He said Williams was
seeking financing for a legit
imate business deal.
Though defense attorney
Koelzer can't use Fullam's
opinion as evidence, he no doubt
will try to make the same points
during the trial. He also is ex
pected to call Plaza and Weir as
witnesses to attack Weinberg's
conduct.
