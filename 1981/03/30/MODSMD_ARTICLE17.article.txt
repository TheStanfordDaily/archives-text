# UMW chief seeks contract approval
## 
### Associated Press 
United Mine Workers President Sam Church made
whirlwind stops in three coal states yesterday in a push for
rank-and-file approval for a contract settlement, and union
officials said the decision was in the hands of a "silent majori
ty"
Church went to Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky to
warn that the U.S. could lose foreign markets if coal produc
tion dropped, saying a long strike by the union's 160,000 mem
bers could hamstring the industry.
UMW officials said miners were studying the proposed
agreement, which goes to a vote tomorrow.
"The silent majority hasn't spoken yet and they're not
going to be heard until Tuesday," said John Darcus, a senior
UMW official in West Virginia, yesterday. "You only hear the
most vocal."
Miners struck Friday when their old contract expired, al
though union leaders had reached a tentative settlement with
coal operators. Two years ago, during a fractious 111-day rec
ord strike, the rank and file rejected two contract settle
ments.
Jerry Miller, a union official in West Virginia, however,
said, "It's probably going be turneci down by 80 percent. I
haven't talked to anyone who will vote for it."
Some UMW officials and miners contend the lagging econo
my and widespread layoffs in the coal industry favor approval
of the contract, which calls for a 36 percent increase in wages
and benefits over three years.
"I have a gut feeling that it will pass nationwide," said
Walt Murray, an Ohio miner. "The economy is bad and people
are afraid and the coal operators know it."
But a miner at a meeting in West Lynn, W.Va., said,
"We're going to vote this contract down and tell Sam Church
to go back and get us another one."
