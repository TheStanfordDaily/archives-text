# Citizens protest budget cuts
## 
### 
Boston (AP) â€” About 20,000
demonstrators, including teach
ers, parents and schoolchildren,
chanted "Save Our State" at a
rally Saturday on Boston Com
mon to protest budget cutbacks
caused by tax-slashing Proposi
tion 2Vz.
The Massachusetts Teachers
Association, sponsor of the ral
ly, says 12,000 teachers could be
laid off statewide and many
school programs will be
eliminated this fall due to the
cut in property tax revenues.

"If Horace Mann could come
down off that statue, he would
truly cry if he could see what
has happened to public educa
tion," association Executive Di
rector William Hebert said
while pointing at a statue of the
"father of American public
education."
Representatives of dozens of
Massachusetts communities
nailed "Proposition 2Vz impact
statements" to the doors of a
replica of the Statehouse that
overlooks the Common to dra
matize the expected cutbacks in
their towns and cities.
However, the teachers rally
was not the only gathering of an
gry Bay State taxpayers Satur
day.

The Americans For Constitu
tional Rights attracted about
300 modern-day "tax rebels" to
the Old South Meeting House to
discuss ways to eliminate in
come taxes and reduce the size
of government.
The rally concluded with a
torchlight parade to Boston
Harbor by about 100 demon
strators. They then dumped cer
emonial boxes of tea into the
water, with income tax forms
pasted to the boxes.
Proposition 2 1 /z, approved by
60 percent of the voters in No
vember, caps property tax val
ues at 2 1 /z percent of full valu
ation and makes other tax and
municipal spending changes.
