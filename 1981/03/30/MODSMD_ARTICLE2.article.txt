# Polish leaders condemn scheduled strike
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw — Poland's Communist
leadership charged yesterday that a
nationwide strike scheduled for
tomorrow represented a "struggle for
power" between the government and
the Solidarity independent trade union
federation, and warned that the strike
could spell economic disaster for the
country.
Meanwhile, the transcontinental
war of words between the United
States and the Soviet Union regarding
the tense situation in Poland heated up
once again with each side warning the
other of potential negative conse
quences from their actions.
"This (strike) is a sinister plan,"
Kalzimierz Barcikowski, a member of
the Politburo, told an emergency
meeting of the party's central com
mittee that was called to discuss the
latest crisis growing out of Poland's
labor unrest.
"This is no longer merely pressure
exerted (by Solidarity) on the author
ities, but an open struggle against our
party, against the state authority,
against socialism," Barcikowski, sec
retary of the central committee, said.

Barcikowski's comments, which
were delivered in the name of the
Politburo, the party's top executive
arm, was a surprisingly hard hitting
attack against Solidarity by a man
who had been considered a moderate.
Observers said that it revealed the
desperation of the Polish leadership in
its efforts to head off tomorrow's
strike, called by the 10-million-mem
ber Solidarity movement to protest an
alleged police attack March 19 in the
city of Bydgosczc that left three union
members seriously injured.
The Solidarity protest has been ex
panded to include what the govern
ment considers political demands, de
spite denials from the union leader
ship that it wus nut seeKing to topple
the government or to force Poland
from communism.
Two Solidarity-government work
ing groups met yesterday in an effort
to hammer out a compromise that
would avert the general strike tomor
row. A Solidarity spokesman said that
"some progress" had been made in
narrowing the gap between the gov
ernment and the union federation's
positions.

The groups are to report their find
ings to government and union nego
tiators today. Deputy Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the chief gov
ernment negotiator, and Lech Walesa,
Solidarity leader, had expressed op
timism following a four-hour meeting
Saturday that a solution would be
found to avert the strike.
But the government was taking no
chances in an effort to convince the en
tire nation of what it considers the dis
astrous consequences of a general
strike. Radio and television — no
newspapers were published yesterday
— were filled with gloomy
assessments by government officials.
Television even showed a film of a
badly burned man who, according tc*
the commentator, had set himself on
fire as a protest against the strike.
$100 million lost
Henryk Kisiel, a deputy premier
and chairman of the state planning
commission, in a lengthy review of the
battering that the Polish economy has
taken since labor unrest erupted last
summer, said that the country sus
tained more than $100 million in lost
production during a four-hour warning
strike Friday that had been called to
prod the government into meeting Sol
idarity's demands.
Kisiel said that a general strike
would cost the country about $285 mil
lion a day in lost production, which is
still down from periods preceeding
last summer's unrest.
Kremlin attacks
The Kremlin and East Germany
have mounted virulent attacks against
Solidarity since the strike threat was
first raised, accusing the union feder
ation of engaging in "anti-socialist"
and "counterrevolutionary" activity.
The Soviet Union, in the most men
acing terms it has used so far, accused
the Solidarity trade-union federation
yesterday of launching an open strug
gle against Poland's communist gov
ernment by preparing for a na
tionwide strike tomorrow,

The official Tass news agency, in a
dispatch from Warsaw, claimed
"antisocialists, subversives, and ex
tremists" had blocked a key provin
cial highway, assaulted post offices
and a television transmitter and
seized food stores in a series of pre
strike provocations — accounts that
were promptly denied by Poland's
state-run television network.
'Mounting anarchy'
The Soviet dispatch portrayed
mounting anarchy in its strategically
located neighbor and singled out KOR,
the Committee for Social Self-De
fense, as ringleader of the alleged at
tempt to challenge the government.
Tass also accused President Ronald
Heagan of attempted '' gross in
terference" in Poland's internal af
fairs and of "instigation of forces op
posed to the government." It said
Reagan, in an interview with The
Washington f'nst published yester
day, "virtually demanded that the
Polish government not take any reso
lute steps in connection with the dan
gerous situation in the country. By
what right are such demands made of
a sovereign state?"
It accused Reagan of "hypocrisy,"
and called on him to "cease in
terference in whatever form in Po
land's internal affairs."
Top-ranking Reagan adminis
tration officials expressed intensified
concern yesterday that the Soviet
Union might invade Poland, and they
repeated warnings that such a step
would have "unforeseen conse
quences" for East-West relations.
'Springboard for an invasion'
Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger said that the extended Warsaw
Pact maneuvers near Poland could be
a possible "springboard for an in
vasion" by the Soviets. And Secretary
of State Alexander Haig warned that
needed economic aid from the West
might be cut off if the Polish govern
ment should use force to suppress that
nation's independent trade union.
