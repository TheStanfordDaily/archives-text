# V.P. Bush emerges into influential new role
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The public learned
something about George Bush last week
that he had hoped to keep secret for a
while: The vice president has become an
influential insider in President Ronald
Reagan's administration.

News analysis

The day after Reagan had faced down
an angry Secretary of State Alexander
Haig and formally confirmed his choice
of Bush as the administration's crisis
manager. Bush sat in his White House of
fice and said .
"What happened yesterday, with my
name cropping up there, is an embar
rassment to me. I'm not competing for
something. I want to do what the presi
dent wants me to do and I want to do it
well ... but I'm not seeking assign
ments. I'm not saying, 'Let me do this or
that.' "
Despite the disclaimer, an examina
tion of Bush's activities over a 10-day pe
riod, climaxing with the announcement
of his role as the president's stand-in on
domestic and foreign policy emer
gencies, left no doubt that he is playing
an increasing role in both the domestic
and national security operations of this

administration.
It was a span of days in which Bush:
— Announced the first substantive
steps in the administration's drive to cut
back cumbersome government regu
lations.
— Delivered federal financial help to
Atlanta's child-murder task force and of
fered his sympathies to the bereaved
families.
— Defended Reagan programs in nine
speeches to audiences as sympathetic as
wealthy Florida Republicans and as
skeptical as black publishers.
— Huddled twice with Republican sen
ators to plot strategy on the Reagan
budget.
— Conferred with government of
ficials from Japan, West Germany and
Argentina, leaders of the Republican Na
tional Committee, the American Jewish
Committee, the North Carolina legisla
ture, the Conservative Political Action
Conference, the Asia Foundation, the As
sociated Builders and Contractors and
the Business-Higher Education Forum,
among others.
— Still managed to spend about three
hours a day with the president.
"I go home tired at night," Bush said,

"but I have a good job and I want to be
effective at it."
It was at Reagan's 70th birthday party
that the president leaned over to
Barbara Bush and said. "I want to ask
you a very personal question. Is George
happy with his job? Does he feel what
he's doing is worthwhile? I just want to
be sure he's doing enough. If the awful
awful should happen, George should
know everything."
That is not how it began. Reagan and
Bush had known each other for 16 years,
but the relationship had never been close
and, at times, it verged on being an
tagonistic.
Bush had bristled when Reagan went
to Texas in 1978 to campaign for a Re
publican opposing Bush's son for a cov
eted congressional nomination. Reagan
and his aides thought Bush was stiff and
sappy in last year's Nashua, N.H., pri
mary debate and unnecessarily savage
in his Pennsylvania primary assault on
Reagan's "voodoo economics."
Reagan balked at pressure from his
advisers to pick Bush as his running
mate and acquiesced only when the
draft-Jerry Ford boom appeared to be

turning into a midnight horror show at
the Detroit national convention. James
Baker, then Bush's campaign manager
and now Reagan's chief of staff, says,
"Everyone knows the president didn't
want to pick Bush. .. . There was
absolutely no understanding between
them of what Bush's role would be."
Bush confirms that as a fact and says,
"I never yet have sat down with him and
defined all this. It has just evolved."
In an interview last Friday with The
Washington Post, Reagan said that
"while we didn't have an opportunity to
get down into details," he had always
wanted Bush "as closely involved in the
administration as . . . possible. . . . It's
working very well."
There is, as Bush acknowledges, a pre
cedent in the partnership between Jim
my Carter and Walter Mondale over the
previous four years. Mondale was the
first vice president to be granted a genu
ine working role in an administration.
Anxious to see his breakthrough in
stitutionalized by his successor, Mondale
and members of his staff were (in the
words of Chase Untermeyer, the former
Houston legislator who is Bush's ex
ecutive assistant) "extraordinarily help
ful" to Bush and his aides during the
transition period.
