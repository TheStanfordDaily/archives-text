# Religious groups band together in 'War on Poverty'
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — Black Baptist
pastor Edward Hill of Los An
geles has gained the support and
opened the wallets of some of
the nation's richest conserva
tive white Christians for a new
privately funded "War on Pov
erty" designed to reach 15 ma
jor cities in the United States.
Jerry Falwell's Moral Ma
jority, the Billy Graham Evan
gelistic Association, Bill
Bright's Campus Crusade for
Christ and at least half a dozen
other large and influential con
servative white religious or
ganizations are behind the
project, which was quietly
launched in Washington, DC.,
last fall.
Hill, pastor of the 1500-mem
ber Mount Zion Missionary Bap
tist church on the edge of Watts
district here, is a fiery
preacher, a well-known Re
publican and a member of Mor
al Majority, the conservative
political-religious group.

for inner-city unemployed.
The private anti-poverty
project, called Foundation for
the Poor, is being funded by
evangelical organizations and
by individuals such as Clint
Murchison, owner of the Dallas
Cowboys professional football
team, and Texas billionaire
Nelson Bunker Hunt, the Los
Angeles Times has learned.
Even with big names and big
money, however, the private
anti-poverty war will not have
an easy time winning where fed
eral programs have stumbled.
Some evangelical leaders with
inner-city experience hold
doubts about cooperation from
ghetto residents and sustained
interest by white evangelicals.

working relationships between
affluent, suburban churches and
inner-city congregations in each

"Evangelicals have become
convinced about their need to

people are involved. A very,
very, very wealthy man from
Texas prayed and cried over the

poor recently."

evangelical poverty program

"meet the legitimate needs of

away with a "society of pro

Hill said that a separate but

also under way: an alliance of

and "about 10 U.S. senators and
35 to 40 congressmen" — led by
Sen. William Armstrong (R-
Colo.) "is pushing (President

Presidential Commission on the
Poor." A source close to the
project said that such a com
mission would be "ably staffed
and privately funded, probably
with Hill as chairman." The
commission would make the
poor a national priority, analyze
existing urban programs, de
velop new resources and recom

As Hill and William Seitz, 25,

on poverty will link suburban
church money, manpower, and

"Our objectives are to coop

to become soul winners and how
to win blocks for Christ through
block workers," said Seitz, a
1978 graduate of Wheaton Col
lege in Illinois, a prominent
evangelical school. "Doc (Hill)
says a saved city is a safe city."
Since 1970, 1317 persons from
120 churches have completed
the World Christian Training
Center's evangelism course.
So far, no evangelical or
ganization has pledged a specif
ic dollar amount to the Founda
tion for the Poor. But Campus
Crusade for Christ has agreed to
underwrite "block worker"
evangelism in target cities, Hill
said.
In addition to Los Angeles,

Hill has been roundly
criticized by fellow black clergy
for his political conservatism
(he headed the Black Clergy for

long association with white

Raised among Texas
sharecroppers during the 19305,
Hill acknowledged that he feels
more at home with evangelists
Falwell, Graham and James
Robison of Texas than he does
with liberals of his own race.
Blacks (he prefers to call
them Negroes) tend to lump the
Reagan administration, white
evangelicals in general and
Moral Majority in particular
with racism, he observed.
But he said he was "en
