# Small blaze at SLAC
## 
### 
A Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter research project searching for a
"free quark" is operating smoothly
now after a small fire Thursday,
March 19 caused $100 in material dam
age, according to SLAC Public In
formation Director Doug Dupen.
The fire in the center of the Interac
tion Region 6 of SLAC's Positron-
Electron Project (PEP) was dis
covered at about 7:45 a.m. and extin
guished 10 minutes later by fire
fighters stationed at SLAC.
While no injuries were reported as a
result of the blaze, firefighters donned
gas masks and oxygen tanks to avoid
inhalation of toxic smoke. The entire
SLAC facility was shut down after the
fire, but it began operation again
Thursday evening.
The fire damaged a plastic cover on
top of a detector used in the experi
ments which are looking for quarks,
but the detector itself was not dam
aged.
Sparks from a welder's torch may
be responsible, but the exact cause of
the blaze has not yet been determined,
Dupen said.

While damage to the facility itself
was minimal, cleanup costs and loss of
two eight-hour shifts at the facility
cost SLAC several thousand dollars,
he said.
Interaction Region 6 is one of five
SLAC buildings where atomic parti
cles are smashed together after being
accelerated around the PEP ring.
A team of scientists from the Na
tional Laboratory at Frascati, Italy;
the University of Hawaii; Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory of the Univer
sity of California; Northwestern Uni
versity and Stanford have been
searching night and day since October
for the "free quark," so named be
cause it doesn't couple with another
quark as most are believed to do.
The "free quark" is theoretical, and
it is "so elusive" that it may never be
seen at all, Dupen said. The team ex
pects to look at more than a million
beam collisions to even have a chance
of detecting one "free quark," he said.
The scientists will continue to run ex
periments looking for the "free
quark" for several months, Dupen
said.


Don't fence me in
This fence marks the beginning of the reconstruction of
Storey House. The house, damaged in a fire last winter.

will be remodeled to accommodate handicapped stu
dents and to make coed living possible.
