# Compete in King Games
## Tracksters busy 
### Paul Brewer 
The Stanford track teams
didn't get much of a rest be
tween academic quarters this
spring, as they hosted the 12th
Annual Martin Luther King
Games last Friday and Satur
day, and a five-way meet with
Cal Poly, Oregon State, Army
and Fresno State the previous
Saturday.
An estimated 12,000 track en
thusiasts sat under sunny skies
for two long hours to watch the
second consecutive Stanford
hosted version of the King
Games, a meet which included
high school, junior college and
invitational events. This year's
meet featured several world
class stars and was highlighted
by a few superb early-season
performances and many Stan
ford Stadium records
USC sprinter James Sanford,
ranked first in the world in 1979,
sped to a slightly wind-aided
10.10 for 100 meters, a time San
ford himself considered to be
"almost too good for this early
in the season.'' Herschel Walk
er, Georgia's powerful running
back, easily defeated Darrin
Nelson in the "football 100
meters."
The crowd thought it had wit
nessed a world record when
USC and Tennessee tied in 55.5
seconds in the shuttle hurdle re
lay but a phone call revealed
that the Philadelphia Pioneers
club had run even faster in a
meet on the East coast earlier
that morning.
Stanford sophomore Kim
Schnurpfeil continued her win
ning ways by breaking both the
school and stadium records for
the 10,000 meters by almost two
minutes with her 34:48.1 clock
ing.
Although the time still isn't in
the same class as her 5000 meter
best, her 10K performance does

bring up the question of what
distance to focus on in the
future. "I did feel comfortable
at the longer distance and I
think I can improve my time
now that I'm more familiar with
the pace," claimed Schnurpfeil.
"But I'm still not sure what
event I'll run at the Nationals."
Other Stanford team high
lights at the King Games in
cluded a fourth place finish and
school record discus throw for
freshman Carol Cady, who
threw 169 feet. Cady has broken
her own school record in every
outing this spring. Sophomore
distanceman Bill Graham quali
fied for the NCAA meet in June
with his fine 29:19.2 for 10,000
meters. Hurdler Garry
Shumway placed third in the
400-meter hurdles with a per
sonal best 51.7.
In the previous meet, staged
at Stanford Stadium on March
21, the men's team beat Fresno
State and Army, tied Oregon
State, and was defeated by a
strong Cal Poly-SLO team;
while the women lost a closely
fought battle with a powerful
Cal Poly squad, 67-60.
The Cal Poly dual meet fea
tured the return of Olympic
javelin thrower Mary Osborne
to the Card roster following a
leg injury. She contributed
greatly to the team effort by
winning her specialty with a
strong throw of 162-1, and plac
ing second in the discus and
third in the shot put. Freshman
Marcia Martin set a school rec
ord of 56.16 for the.4oo meters,
and Schnurpfeil broke her own
school record in the 1500 meters
with a 4:29.9 clocking.
On the men's side, Dave
Thomson won the discus and
placed second in the hammer,
while Garry Shumway won the
400-meter hurdles.
