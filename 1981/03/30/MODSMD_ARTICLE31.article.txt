# Sun Devils burn Cards, sweep 3-game series
## 
### Ralph Walker 
Tempe, Ariz. — There is a
mystical atmosphere in Pack
ard Stadium, home of the Arizo
na State University baseball
team. ASU's home field is like a
minature major league park,
complete with an organ, a so
phisticated scoreboard, two
concession stands, vendors,
ballgirls (Devil's Angels), and a
press box. The fans are all well
informed, wear the ASU colors
of maroon and gold, and usually
number about as many as those
who attend Oakland A s games.
Only one thing is missing: a golf
cart that carries pitchers from
the bullpen to the mound.
The ASU players are adapted
to this environment. Before
each game, they casually put on
little shows for the fans by
playing various and sometimes
comical forms of pepper.
Stanford wasn't laughing
however, as they were swept de
cisively by these Sun Devils this
weekend by the scores of 9-2,
12-7, and 9-6. When asked if the
environment in Tempe had an
adverse effect on his players,
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
flatly said no. "I don't think any
one comes in here antsy or
afraid. On the contrary, I think

we were ready to play, but we
just didn't play well enough."
One thing, however, is cer
tain. After the drubbing that Ar
izona State has given the teams
of the SixPac conference en
route to their unblemished 11-0
record in the strongest col
legiate baseball division in the
country, teams may very well
incur visions of shellshock when
they face the Sun Devils in the
second round of Pac-10 play.
Devils come out hot in the cold
Although Friday night was a
relatively cold 55 degrees, and
there was a chill factor of about
40 degrees due to gusty winds,
the Sun Devils' play was any
thing but frigid.
Junior southpaw Randy New
man was described by ASU head
coach Jim Brock as being his
only dependable starter so far
this year. Newman lived up to
his title, delivering a very "de
pendable" performance, spac
ing out nine hits and allowing
only two runs while going nine
full innings. Offensively, the
Devils collected nine runs on 12
hits, off of Stanford hurlers
Steve Cottrell (now 4-1) and Bob
Boatman.
The Devils also displayed sol
id, errorless defensive play be

hind Newman. "I've never had a
better defensive team playing
behind me," stated Newman,
who only struck out two batters.
"In junior college and high
school, I tried to strike everyone
out, but here, I'm not afraid to
let them hit the ball. Our offense
is also a big asset. Since I can go
out knowing that we'll usually
score eight or nine runs, I'm
more relaxed while pitching."
ASU's offensive attack was
described by Stanford's Cottrell
as one that "scores in bunches,"
and their big inning came in the
fifth. Leading 3-1, rightfielder
Ricky Nelson, a prototype of
former Sun Devil Reggie Jack
son, cracked Cottrell's first
pitch of the inning over the
rightfield wall. Third baseman
Mike Sodders then singled and
was followed by a double by
Alvin Davis before leftfielder
Stan Holmes knocked them both
in with a sharp single up the
middle. Cottrell bore down to
retire the next two hitters, but
catcher Rick Wilson drove in
Holmes with a single to finish
the innings' scoring and give
ASU an 8-1 lead.
The inevitable question in this
situation is why Marquess
didn't pull Cottrell. "I thought

he was the best guy to go with,"
stated Marqess. "On the whole,
he didn't pitch that badlly."
Pitching coach Tom Dunton
was more candid. "It frankly
didn't look like we were going to
score a lot of runs. And we didn't
want to use our top guys in the
bullpen in that situation (being
behind 8-1.)"
Stanford's only scoring oc
curred in the fourth and eighth
innings. In the fourth, Darryl
Stephens ripped a two-out
double down the leftfield line,
scoring Bill Worden, who had
previously singled. In the
eighth, Stanford bunched to
gether three hits, the third being
a blooping RBI single by John
Elway. Elway was the main of
fensive catalyst for the Cards in
the series, going six-for-12 at the
plate with six RBIs.
C-A-R-T-E-R spells relief for
ASU
After facing only four batters
in the first inning, ASU starting
pitcher Bill Koch was yanked by
Brock in favor of relief ace Ken
dall Carter. After Mike Dot
terer's leadolf triple, Elway's
RBI double, and Bob
Hausladen's run-scoring single,
Carter came in and retired the
side, and responded with 5% in

nings of scoreless relief en route
to his ninth victory of the sea
son. Stanford hurler Paul
Grame (6-3) initially appeared
to be throwing well enough to
quiet the thundering bats of ASU
as he easily retired five of the
first six men he faced. With two
outs and a runner on first in the
second inning, however, the
ASU offensive machine came to
life. Highlighted by shortstop
Donnie Hill's grand slam home
run after Grame had rendered
three straight bases on balls,
ASU sent 12 men to the plate in a
seven-run outburst. The Sun
Devils added one more in the
fourth and four unearned runs in
the fifth off Stanford relief ace
Gregg Lomnicky to take what
turned out to be an insurmoun
table 12-1 lead.
The Cards were able to
muster five runs in the top of the
ninth on Hausladen's two-run
roundtripper and Elway's
three-run double, but their ef
fort fell way short.
"We are playing exceptional
ly well now, " commented Brock
after the second game. "The
biggest physical change has
come in the defense, and this
has helped our pitchers psy-
chologically. Our hitting has
been consistent all along but the
fact that we've also gotten a lot
of breaks the past few weeks has
also helped out."
A Devilish sun
The series finale was almost
an instant replay of the second
game with one very important
exception it was played during
the day under a cloudless sunny
sky.
The Cards took a 1-0 lead in
the first inning when their first
three batters greeted Jim Jef
ferson with base hits. Brock, in
the style of Sparky Anderson for
the second straight game, gave
his starter the quick hook.
Behind any shaky starting
pitchers should be a crew of de
pendable relievers. And this
time it was ASU pitcher Kevin
Dukes. With runners on first and
second and no outs, Dukes de
nied Stanford another big in
ning by retiring the side.
Stanford was coasting along
with a 1-0 lead for three innings
behind the one-hit pitching of
freshman Brian Myers (1-1)
before the Sun Devils broke
through for five runs. Although
they were all technically
earned. Myers could and proba
bly should have gotten out of the
inning without surrendering a
single run After consecutive in
field singles by Hill and Nelson.
Sodders and first baseman
Davis lifted back-to-back fly
balls to centertield. where Stan
ford's Stephens lost them both
in the sun.

So instead of there being two
outs with two runners on. the
gate to another one of ASU's
patented rallies was opened
"The sun was brutal." said
rightfielder Mike Toothman af
ter the game. "You can't fault
Darryl for that."
After Arizona State added one
run in the sixth and three in the
seventh. Stanford found them
selves trailing 9-1. but were able
to stage a fierce comeback ef
fort after Dukes had held them
hitless and scoreless through
seven innings.
The Cards tallied two in the
eighth, culminated by second
baseman Bob DeCosta's triple,
and three in the ninth on Tooth
man's two-run double and Dave
Meier's RBI single. Dukes was
replaced by Mark Brewer who
was able to prevent the Cards
from doing any further damage,
and he wrapped up the sweep tor
the Devils.
There is an old axiom in
sports which states that it is bet
ter to get beat than to beat your
self. Judging from the fact that
Stanford didn't play too badly
and that ASU is now 11-0 in the
SixPac and ranked number one
in the nation, there is nothing
for the Cards to be ashamed of.
"You hate to lose." said Mar
quess after the series, "but we
really didn't play that poorly.
The thing I'm most disappointed
with is the hitting, but I'd be
more upset if we had walked in
six or seven batters and made a
bunch of errors. We're still in a
competition for second place."

double down the leftfield line,
scoring Bill Worden, who had
previously singled. In the
eighth, Stanford bunched to
gether three hits, the third being
a blooping RBI single by John
Elway. Elway was the main of
fensive catalyst for the Cards in
the series, going six-for-12 at the
plate with six RBIs.
C-A-R-T-E-R spells relief for
ASU
After facing only four batters
in the first inning, ASU starting
pitcher Bill Koch was yanked by
Brock in favor of relief ace Ken
dall Carter. After Mike Dot
terer's leadolf triple, Elway's
RBI double, and Bob
Hausladen's run-scoring single,
Carter came in and retired the
side, and responded with 5% in

nings of scoreless relief en route
to his ninth victory of the sea
son. Stanford hurler Paul
Grame (6-3) initially appeared
to be throwing well enough to
quiet the thundering bats of ASU
as he easily retired five of the
first six men he faced. With two
outs and a runner on first in the
second inning, however, the
ASU offensive machine came to
life. Highlighted by shortstop
Donnie Hill's grand slam home
run after Grame had rendered
three straight bases on balls,
ASU sent 12 men to the plate in a
seven-run outburst. The Sun
Devils added one more in the
fourth and four unearned runs in
the fifth off Stanford relief ace
Gregg Lomnicky to take what
turned out to be an insurmoun
table 12-1 lead.
The Cards were able to
muster five runs in the top of the
ninth on Hausladen's two-run
roundtripper and Elway's
three-run double, but their ef
fort fell way short.
"We are playing exceptional
ly well now, " commented Brock
after the second game. "The
biggest physical change has
come in the defense, and this
has helped our pitchers psy-
chologically. Our hitting has
been consistent all along but the
fact that we've also gotten a lot
of breaks the past few weeks has
also helped out."
A Devilish sun
The series finale was almost
an instant replay of the second
game with one very important
exception it was played during
the day under a cloudless sunny
sky.
The Cards took a 1-0 lead in
the first inning when their first
three batters greeted Jim Jef
ferson with base hits. Brock, in
the style of Sparky Anderson for
the second straight game, gave
his starter the quick hook.
Behind any shaky starting
pitchers should be a crew of de
pendable relievers. And this
time it was ASU pitcher Kevin
Dukes. With runners on first and
second and no outs, Dukes de
nied Stanford another big in
ning by retiring the side.
Stanford was coasting along
with a 1-0 lead for three innings
behind the one-hit pitching of
freshman Brian Myers (1-1)
before the Sun Devils broke
through for five runs. Although
they were all technically
earned. Myers could and proba
bly should have gotten out of the
inning without surrendering a
single run After consecutive in
field singles by Hill and Nelson.
Sodders and first baseman
Davis lifted back-to-back fly
balls to centertield. where Stan
ford's Stephens lost them both
in the sun.

So instead of there being two
outs with two runners on. the
gate to another one of ASU's
patented rallies was opened
"The sun was brutal." said
rightfielder Mike Toothman af
ter the game. "You can't fault
Darryl for that."
After Arizona State added one
run in the sixth and three in the
seventh. Stanford found them
selves trailing 9-1. but were able
to stage a fierce comeback ef
fort after Dukes had held them
hitless and scoreless through
seven innings.
The Cards tallied two in the
eighth, culminated by second
baseman Bob DeCosta's triple,
and three in the ninth on Tooth
man's two-run double and Dave
Meier's RBI single. Dukes was
replaced by Mark Brewer who
was able to prevent the Cards
from doing any further damage,
and he wrapped up the sweep tor
the Devils.
There is an old axiom in
sports which states that it is bet
ter to get beat than to beat your
self. Judging from the fact that
Stanford didn't play too badly
and that ASU is now 11-0 in the
SixPac and ranked number one
in the nation, there is nothing
for the Cards to be ashamed of.
"You hate to lose." said Mar
quess after the series, "but we
really didn't play that poorly.
The thing I'm most disappointed
with is the hitting, but I'd be
more upset if we had walked in
six or seven batters and made a
bunch of errors. We're still in a
competition for second place."
Tempe, Ariz. — There is a
mystical atmosphere in Pack
ard Stadium, home of the Arizo
na State University baseball
team. ASU's home field is like a
minature major league park,
complete with an organ, a so
phisticated scoreboard, two
concession stands, vendors,
ballgirls (Devil's Angels), and a
press box. The fans are all well
informed, wear the ASU colors
of maroon and gold, and usually
number about as many as those
who attend Oakland A s games.
Only one thing is missing: a golf
cart that carries pitchers from
the bullpen to the mound.
The ASU players are adapted
to this environment. Before
each game, they casually put on
little shows for the fans by
playing various and sometimes
comical forms of pepper.
Stanford wasn't laughing
however, as they were swept de
cisively by these Sun Devils this
weekend by the scores of 9-2,
12-7, and 9-6. When asked if the
environment in Tempe had an
adverse effect on his players,
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
flatly said no. "I don't think any
one comes in here antsy or
afraid. On the contrary, I think

we were ready to play, but we
just didn't play well enough."
One thing, however, is cer
tain. After the drubbing that Ar
izona State has given the teams
of the SixPac conference en
route to their unblemished 11-0
record in the strongest col
legiate baseball division in the
country, teams may very well
incur visions of shellshock when
they face the Sun Devils in the
second round of Pac-10 play.
Devils come out hot in the cold
Although Friday night was a
relatively cold 55 degrees, and
there was a chill factor of about
40 degrees due to gusty winds,
the Sun Devils' play was any
thing but frigid.
Junior southpaw Randy New
man was described by ASU head
coach Jim Brock as being his
only dependable starter so far
this year. Newman lived up to
his title, delivering a very "de
pendable" performance, spac
ing out nine hits and allowing
only two runs while going nine
full innings. Offensively, the
Devils collected nine runs on 12
hits, off of Stanford hurlers
Steve Cottrell (now 4-1) and Bob
Boatman.
The Devils also displayed sol
id, errorless defensive play be

hind Newman. "I've never had a
better defensive team playing
behind me," stated Newman,
who only struck out two batters.
"In junior college and high
school, I tried to strike everyone
out, but here, I'm not afraid to
let them hit the ball. Our offense
is also a big asset. Since I can go
out knowing that we'll usually
score eight or nine runs, I'm
more relaxed while pitching."
ASU's offensive attack was
described by Stanford's Cottrell
as one that "scores in bunches,"
and their big inning came in the
fifth. Leading 3-1, rightfielder
Ricky Nelson, a prototype of
former Sun Devil Reggie Jack
son, cracked Cottrell's first
pitch of the inning over the
rightfield wall. Third baseman
Mike Sodders then singled and
was followed by a double by
Alvin Davis before leftfielder
Stan Holmes knocked them both
in with a sharp single up the
middle. Cottrell bore down to
retire the next two hitters, but
catcher Rick Wilson drove in
Holmes with a single to finish
the innings' scoring and give
ASU an 8-1 lead.
The inevitable question in this
situation is why Marquess
didn't pull Cottrell. "I thought

he was the best guy to go with,"
stated Marqess. "On the whole,
he didn't pitch that badlly."
Pitching coach Tom Dunton
was more candid. "It frankly
didn't look like we were going to
score a lot of runs. And we didn't
want to use our top guys in the
bullpen in that situation (being
behind 8-1.)"
Stanford's only scoring oc
curred in the fourth and eighth
innings. In the fourth, Darryl
Stephens ripped a two-out
double down the leftfield line,
scoring Bill Worden, who had
previously singled. In the
eighth, Stanford bunched to
gether three hits, the third being
a blooping RBI single by John

the Devils.
There is an old axiom in
sports which states that it is bet
ter to get beat than to beat your
self. Judging from the fact that
Stanford didn't play too badly
and that ASU is now 11-0 in the
SixPac and ranked number one
in the nation, there is nothing
for the Cards to be ashamed of.
"You hate to lose." said Mar
quess after the series, "but we
really didn't play that poorly.
The thing I'm most disappointed
with is the hitting, but I'd be
more upset if we had walked in
six or seven batters and made a
bunch of errors. We're still in a
competition for second place."
Tempe, Ariz. — There is a
mystical atmosphere in Pack
ard Stadium, home of the Arizo
na State University baseball
team. ASU's home field is like a
minature major league park,
complete with an organ, a so
phisticated scoreboard, two
concession stands, vendors,
ballgirls (Devil's Angels), and a
press box. The fans are all well
informed, wear the ASU colors
of maroon and gold, and usually
number about as many as those
who attend Oakland A s games.
Only one thing is missing: a golf
cart that carries pitchers from
the bullpen to the mound.
The ASU players are adapted
to this environment. Before
each game, they casually put on
little shows for the fans by
playing various and sometimes
comical forms of pepper.
Stanford wasn't laughing
however, as they were swept de
cisively by these Sun Devils this
weekend by the scores of 9-2,
12-7, and 9-6. When asked if the
environment in Tempe had an
adverse effect on his players,
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
flatly said no. "I don't think any
one comes in here antsy or
afraid. On the contrary, I think

we were ready to play, but we
just didn't play well enough."
One thing, however, is cer
tain. After the drubbing that Ar
izona State has given the teams
of the SixPac conference en
route to their unblemished 11-0
record in the strongest col
legiate baseball division in the
country, teams may very well
incur visions of shellshock when
they face the Sun Devils in the
second round of Pac-10 play.
Devils come out hot in the cold
Although Friday night was a
relatively cold 55 degrees, and
there was a chill factor of about
40 degrees due to gusty winds,
the Sun Devils' play was any
thing but frigid.
Junior southpaw Randy New
man was described by ASU head
coach Jim Brock as being his
only dependable starter so far
this year. Newman lived up to
his title, delivering a very "de
pendable" performance, spac
ing out nine hits and allowing
only two runs while going nine
full innings. Offensively, the
Devils collected nine runs on 12
hits, off of Stanford hurlers
Steve Cottrell (now 4-1) and Bob
Boatman.
The Devils also displayed sol
id, errorless defensive play be

hind Newman. "I've never had a
better defensive team playing
behind me," stated Newman,
who only struck out two batters.
"In junior college and high
school, I tried to strike everyone
out, but here, I'm not afraid to
let them hit the ball. Our offense
is also a big asset. Since I can go
out knowing that we'll usually
score eight or nine runs, I'm
more relaxed while pitching."
ASU's offensive attack was
described by Stanford's Cottrell
as one that "scores in bunches,"
and their big inning came in the
fifth. Leading 3-1, rightfielder
Ricky Nelson, a prototype of
former Sun Devil Reggie Jack
son, cracked Cottrell's first
pitch of the inning over the
rightfield wall. Third baseman
Mike Sodders then singled and
was followed by a double by
Alvin Davis before leftfielder
Stan Holmes knocked them both
in with a sharp single up the
middle. Cottrell bore down to
retire the next two hitters, but
catcher Rick Wilson drove in
Holmes with a single to finish
the innings' scoring and give
ASU an 8-1 lead.
The inevitable question in this
situation is why Marquess
didn't pull Cottrell. "I thought

he was the best guy to go with,"
stated Marqess. "On the whole,
he didn't pitch that badlly."
Pitching coach Tom Dunton
was more candid. "It frankly
didn't look like we were going to
score a lot of runs. And we didn't
want to use our top guys in the
bullpen in that situation (being
behind 8-1.)"
Stanford's only scoring oc
curred in the fourth and eighth
innings. In the fourth, Darryl
Stephens ripped a two-out
double down the leftfield line,
scoring Bill Worden, who had
previously singled. In the
eighth, Stanford bunched to
gether three hits, the third being
a blooping RBI single by John
Elway. Elway was the main of
fensive catalyst for the Cards in
the series, going six-for-12 at the
plate with six RBIs.
C-A-R-T-E-R spells relief for
ASU
After facing only four batters
in the first inning, ASU starting
pitcher Bill Koch was yanked by
Brock in favor of relief ace Ken
dall Carter. After Mike Dot
terer's leadolf triple, Elway's
RBI double, and Bob
Hausladen's run-scoring single,
Carter came in and retired the
side, and responded with 5% in

nings of scoreless relief en route
to his ninth victory of the sea
son. Stanford hurler Paul
Grame (6-3) initially appeared
to be throwing well enough to
quiet the thundering bats of ASU
as he easily retired five of the
first six men he faced. With two
outs and a runner on first in the
second inning, however, the
ASU offensive machine came to
life. Highlighted by shortstop
Donnie Hill's grand slam home
run after Grame had rendered
three straight bases on balls,
ASU sent 12 men to the plate in a
seven-run outburst. The Sun
Devils added one more in the
fourth and four unearned runs in
the fifth off Stanford relief ace
Gregg Lomnicky to take what
turned out to be an insurmoun
table 12-1 lead.
The Cards were able to
muster five runs in the top of the
ninth on Hausladen's two-run
roundtripper and Elway's
three-run double, but their ef
fort fell way short.
"We are playing exceptional
ly well now, " commented Brock
after the second game. "The
biggest physical change has
come in the defense, and this
has helped our pitchers psy-
chologically. Our hitting has
been consistent all along but the
fact that we've also gotten a lot
of breaks the past few weeks has
also helped out."
A Devilish sun
The series finale was almost
an instant replay of the second
game with one very important
exception it was played during
the day under a cloudless sunny
sky.
The Cards took a 1-0 lead in
the first inning when their first
three batters greeted Jim Jef
ferson with base hits. Brock, in
the style of Sparky Anderson for
the second straight game, gave
his starter the quick hook.
Behind any shaky starting
pitchers should be a crew of de
pendable relievers. And this
time it was ASU pitcher Kevin
Dukes. With runners on first and
second and no outs, Dukes de
nied Stanford another big in
ning by retiring the side.
Stanford was coasting along
with a 1-0 lead for three innings
behind the one-hit pitching of
freshman Brian Myers (1-1)
before the Sun Devils broke
through for five runs. Although
they were all technically
earned. Myers could and proba
bly should have gotten out of the
inning without surrendering a
single run After consecutive in
field singles by Hill and Nelson.
Sodders and first baseman
Davis lifted back-to-back fly
balls to centertield. where Stan
ford's Stephens lost them both
in the sun.

So instead of there being two
outs with two runners on. the
gate to another one of ASU's
patented rallies was opened
"The sun was brutal." said
rightfielder Mike Toothman af
ter the game. "You can't fault
Darryl for that."
After Arizona State added one
run in the sixth and three in the
seventh. Stanford found them
selves trailing 9-1. but were able
to stage a fierce comeback ef
fort after Dukes had held them
hitless and scoreless through
seven innings.
The Cards tallied two in the
eighth, culminated by second
baseman Bob DeCosta's triple,
and three in the ninth on Tooth
man's two-run double and Dave
Meier's RBI single. Dukes was
replaced by Mark Brewer who
was able to prevent the Cards
from doing any further damage,
and he wrapped up the sweep tor
the Devils.
There is an old axiom in
