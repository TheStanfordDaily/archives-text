# Women swimmers place second at Nationals

The Stanford women's swimming team, in
an attempt to defend their national title, fell
short, placing second in the AIAW Collegiate
Swimming Championships in South Carolina.
Despite losing narrowly to the Longhorns, the
Cardinals managed to score more points than
last year, when they took the crown.
"I thought they did extremely well," com
mented Stanford coach Holger Dietze. "Wegot
more points than the year before when we won
the thing, so you have to be happy with that."
The meet quickly boiled down to a two-team
affair, with Texas and Stanford battling each
other down to the wire. "It was almost a duel,"
said Dietze.
The Cards were hurt by the absence of two of
their top swimmers, Janet Buchan, who is re
covering from an operation, and Linda Jezek,
who retired from swimming earlier in the sea
son. According to Dietze, the duo was worth
around 130 points.
But just because Stanford was without its
full deck didn't mean it didn't have any aces up
its sleeves. Indeed, the Card swimmers cap
tured two American records and another
AIAW collegiate record, as well as de
molishing several Stanford team marks.
Kim Carlisle led the way and "swam tre
mendous" according to Dietze, and looking at
her performances, few could argue with the
Stanford mentor. Carlisle racked up points in
five events, taking second in four of them: the
50 backstroke, the 100 back, the 200 back, and
the 100 individual medley. She also took third in
the 200IM.
Sherri Hanna swam to school records in two
races, placing second with a time of 4:44 in the

500 freestyle, and obtaining a clocking of
16:11.36 in the 1650
It wasn't only the distances where the Cards
racked up points. Krissie Bush led the Cardinal
sprinters, taking second in the 50 free. She
didn't stop there, swimming a 22 0 split on
Stanford's 200 meter medley reiay team, the
fastest time ever by a woman for that distance.
The time is unofficial, however, because of the
fly start, but it "was a pretty phenomenal ac
complishment," according to Dietze
Two other outstanding sprinters in the five
day meet were Barb Major and Kelly Asplund.
Asplund set two Stanford records in the 50 but
terfly and the 100 free, and both swimmers
loomed large in the success enjoyed by the
Cardinal relay teams.
And the relay teams enjoyed a great deal of
success. It was in the relays where the Cards
chalked up their national records, and grabbed
three impressive first place finishes.
In the 400 free relay, Bush, Major, Asplund,
and Anne Tweedy swam to a national best with
a blistering 3:19.7. In the 200 free, another
American record fell thanks to the efforts of
Bush, Major, Asplund, and Carol Procter â€”
they combined for a 1:31.1. And the record set
ting was not complete until the 800 free relay
team finished; Tweedy, Hanna, Major, and
Asplund hit the wall at 7:17.6, a new AIAW
mark, and just a shade off of the U.S. record.
It was obvious that Dietze was proud of the
way his team had performed at the national
meet. "I thought it was an extremely hard
fought meet," he said. "We went into it at a
disadvantage with two of our top swimmers
out, but the girls did a super job to be in the run
ning in spite of it."
