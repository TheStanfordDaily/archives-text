Wade Flemons, backstroker
par excellence, emerged as
Stanford's latest NCAA swim
ming champion this weekend in
Austin, Texas where the 1981
NCAA Championship Meet was
held.
Flemons became national
champion via his outstanding
performance of 1. 46.3 in the 200
yard backstroke. His swim was
historically the second fastest
time ever swum, behind John
Naber's 1:46.17.
While Flemons was inducted
into the elite circle of NCAA
champions for the first time as a
result of this year's cham
pionship meet, the University of
Texas became the first South
western Conference school to
win a national swimming cham
pionship. Texas accumulated
259 points to second-place
UCLA's 189, sixth-place Cal's
140. and ninth-place Stanford's
84.
For Stanford the meet was a
series of ups and downs, with
more ups than downs. Certainly,
Flemons did an outstanding job,
winning the 200 backstroke;
placing second in the 100 back in
a Cardinal record 49.38; swim
ming to a tenth place finish in
the 200 I.M. in 1:50.3; and help

ing teammates Joe Jimenez,
Mark Michael, and Sam Worden
to a fourth place finish in the
medley relay in 3:16.3 - also a
new Cardinal record.
Dave Sims swam to a tenth
place finish in the 500-yd. free
style in 4:22.3 and blazed to a
15:05 for the 165 yd. free, which
was good for fourth place.
Bari Weick was expected to
be prominent in the distance
events, but, in the words of
teammate Flemons, "was
sicker than a dog for about two
weeks prior to the meet. We
couldn't even lay him down to
give him a rub down before his
events because he couldn't
breathe. It took a lot of guts for
him to have even swum."
Sick as he was, Weick went
4:23.3 in the 500 yd. free (11th
place) and 15:16 in the 1650 (10th
place).-
Stanford's success this year
and ninth place finish at NCAAs
looks like only a prelude of
greater years yet to come. Of
the 15 swimmers who competed
at NCAAs, nine were freshmen
and only one was a senior. Con
gratulations are due to Cardinal
coach Skip Kenney. Another
outstanding recruiting year will
insure Stanford's dominance as
a swimming power.
