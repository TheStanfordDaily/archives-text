# While team takes two in Arizona
## Davis runner-up at Napa 
### Ivan Maisel 
Napa — While his teammates were in Arizona
making mincemeat of their Pacific-10 Conference
hosts, Stanford freshman Scott Davis was making
history here at the plush Silverado Country Club.
Davis was one-half of the first all-amateur final
in the 12-year history of the professional Grand
Prix circuit. Though it didn't end exactly like all
fairy tales — he dropped a 6-3, 5-7, 6-1 decision in
the final to good buddy Sammy Giammalva — the
$50,000 Congoleum Invitational was something out
of a storybook for Davis.
This was not a weak 32-man field. Seeded first
was an ex-Stanford player by the name of Roscoe
Tanner, who happens to be the seventh-ranked
player in the world. But the finalists were un
knowns — even if they had to beat a bunch of
names to reach the finals. John Lloyd, John Hayes
and Hank Pfister were among Giammalva's vic
tims — yet Davis was the only player to win a set
off the Texan
Davis' casualties included Phil Dent (50th on
the ATP computer), Bernie Mitton (78th) and ex-
USC star Bruce Manson (72nd). All three of those
victories went three sets, and that, along with the
matches Davis had to win to qualify for the tour
nament. was the telling difference in yesterday's
final.
"I had three extra matches that Sammy
didn't," Davis said. "It helps in the beginning be
cause it gets you mentally into shape, but it works
against you in the later rounds. Especially today.
I was a little worn."
Davis' lack of sharpness showed particularly in
his service game (he won only six of 14 games he
served). When combined with Giammalva's cons
tant attacking, it meant a long afternoon for
Davis. He double-faulted to lose the match's open
ing game, lost the third game at love, then lost the
set when Giammalva broke again.
But the lanky 18-year-old slowly began to resur
rect. the big serve-and-volley game that pays his
freight. The second set consisted mostly of trad
ing breaks, but Davis began to take command.

Down 30-love in the 11th game, Davis rallied to
break Giammalva, move ahead 6-5 and serve out
the set.
"I thought I had the momentum there," Davis
said. But Giammalva hit two service winners at
deuce to hold the first game, and that seemed to
let the air out of Davis' balloon.
"That was a tough game to lose. I was starting
to get tired. All the tough matches all week caught
up with me. I was a little depressed." Davis
added.
Giammalva announced after the match that he
would turn professional, even though the declara
tion came too late for him to accept the $10,000
first prize offered here. It also meant no col
legiate tennis.
Two of Davis' college teammates also qualified
for the tournament. Tim Mayotte reached the
quarterfinals, by defeating his older brother Chris
6-3, 7-6 in the opening round and then upsetting
35th-ranked Terry Moor 6-4, 6-4. Manson ended
Mayotte's Cinderella bid 5-7, 6-4. 6-1.
Jim Gurfein dropped a tough 7-6, 7-6 opening
round match to Dent, but Stanford coach Dick
Gould was less than heartbroken. At least he had
one of his top three players out of Napa in time to
head south and lead a Congoleum-weakened team
to an 8-1 drubbing of Arizona and a 7-2 decision
over Arizona State. Stanford is now 6-0 going into
Friday's showdown at Cal.
