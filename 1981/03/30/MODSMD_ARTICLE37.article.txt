# Women netters take second at NIKE

San Francisco — The Stan
ford women's tennis team went
up against a Goliath USC Trojan
squad yesterday, but this time
the Cards could not play the role
of David. The Cards were
crushed 7-2 at the NIKE Invita
tional Tournament by the wom
en from Troy, but there was not
a feeling of despair when the
tourney reached its expected
conclusion
Stanford was well prepared
for the match, having already
done some pummeling of their
own, beating three of the top
eight teams in the nation before
falling prey to two-time defend
ing national champion Southern
Cal. The Cards took matches
from South Carolina (8-1), Mi
ami (8-1), and then experienced
an exhilarating 5-4 win over
number-three-ranked UCLA, a
match which came down to the
result of the number three
doubles, where Donna Rubin
and Michelle Weiss pulled out a
great come-from-behind 4-6,
6-2, 6-3 win.
"We've proven what we
wanted to prove when we came
up here." stated Stanford coach
Frank Brennan after the tour
nament. "We came in here
ranked the number two team in
the nation, and we proved that
we were. As for today, we could
use a lot of excuses. But the fact
of the matter is that USC is a
tough team."
The Trojans proved that also,
as they rolled to claim the NIKE
championship and defend their
claim as the outstanding team
in the country. Indeed, they
didn't even make it that excit
ing. winning every singles
match in straight sets, laying
claim to the spoils before the
doubles even began.
The overall tone of the after
noon was frustration for the
Cardinals as every time it
seemed that they would attempt
a comeback in their individual
matches, something would hap
pen to prevent them from doing
so. This was no better ex
emplified than in the number

one, two, and four singles bouts.
The battle at number one was
billed as a classic affair be
tween two extremely tough
serve-and-volleyers — Stan
ford's Alycia Moulton and
Troy's Anne White. It started
off to be as good or better than
expected with both players hold
ing their respective and
dominating serves, until White
broke in the ninth game to go up
5-4. The sophomore from
Charleston, West Virginia held
in the next game to chalk up the
first set in her favor.
The second set looked like a
different story at the outset with
Moulton bouncing back, holding
and breaking in the first two
games to take a 2-0 lead. White,
however, came back hotter than
ever, and blew by Moulton, tak
ing six straight games and the
second set, 6-2.
Elise Burgin also found
herself in a tough match as she
locked horns with the Trojans'
Anna Maria Fernandez. The
first set was deadlocked at 5
games apiece with both players
slamming the stuffing out of the
ball and playing well.
Fernandez held service to take a
6-5 lead, and it came down to
Burgin losing a 3-1 lead (the
tournament featured no-ad
scoring) on her serve in the 12th
game, allowing Fernandez to
eke out a 7-5 win in the first set.
Fernandez jumped off to a
commanding 5-2 advantage in
the second set before an out
standing comeback by Burgin.
The freshman from Baltimore
held in the eighth game, and
then broke through in the ninth
to cut the margin to 5-4. Burgin
was all set to tie the match,
when serving at 3-2, Fernandez
hit a crosscourt backhand that
was apparently wide by some
six inches. But after a 10-minute
argument at the net, in one of
the worst calls this reporter has
seen, the umpire overruled
Burgin's "out" call, and gave
the point to Fernandez, who
promptly took the next point and
the match.
Caryn Copeland lost a heart

breaking 7-5, 7-5 duel with the
Trojan's Nina Voydat at
number tour. also. Copeland
was tied at 5-all in the first set,
and after losing on Voydat's
serve, overcame two set points
in the twelfth game before los
ing on the third when her
backhand volley trickled into
the net. Unlike the first two
matches, the battle at number
four was a study in contrast.
Voydat likes to stay back and
rally from the baseline for days
on end, while Copeland charged
like a teenager with a Master
Charge.
Copeland fell behind 3-0 in the
second, but fought back to a

(what else? > 5-5 tie, fighting off
two match points in the tenth
game. Voydat won the eleventh,
and also broke Copeland in the
twelfth for the win
The Cards were also ham
pered by being without the ser
vices of freshman Susy Jaeger,
who celebrated (? > her birthday
yesterday by being forced out of
the line-up with a painful foot.
So where does their first loss
of the season leave the Cards
with respect to the national ti
tle? "To beat USC, we need our
full line-up, and everybody has
to play well," said Brennan re
alistically. "The Trojans are
tough, but we are within strik

ing distance.''
