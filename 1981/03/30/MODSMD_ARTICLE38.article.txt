# Indiana vs. N. Carolina
## NCAA final tonight 
### 
Philadelphia (AP) — Indiana meets North Carolina tonight at
8:15 p.m. EST for the NCAA basketball championship at the Spec
trum. That's one confrontation.
The other matches the Hoosiers' Bobby Knight against the Tar
Heel's Dean Smith. They're highly regarded coaches with contrast
ing personalities and philosophical concepts about the game
This matchup seems to intrigue the collegiate basketball coaches
gathered here as much as the actual game.
Knight is seeking his second NCAA championship He won here in
1976 with a team that went 32-0. The present team hasn't matured
yet (only one senior starter), Knight says, and could be even better
next season.
Indiana (25-9) was struggling in December with a 7-5 record, in
cluding a 65-56 lost to North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But the
Hoosiers haven't been extended during the tournament They're
winning now the Knight way — crowding man-to-man defense and a
patient, passing game offense.
Smith's teams have made the round of four six times during his
successful 20-year career at Chapel Hill. The Tar Heels have ad
vanced to the final game twice — against UCLA in 1968 and Mar
quette in 1977 — but have yet to win a title.
Multiple defenses — zone, pressure and man-to-man — are
Smith's style. He also substitutes liberally while Knight basically
uses seven or eight regulars.
Knight is a demanding coach, sometimes tempestuous and a per
son who can't seem to avoid controversy. Smith is diplomatic and
controlled and coaches somewhat like the chairman of a board.
Indiana is considered slightly more physical than North Carolina,
but the Tar Heels may be quicker than the Hoosiers.
"Indiana has great mental discipline," said Washington Coach
Marv Harshman. "They don't get upset when something goes
wrong, because they know if they do what Bobby says it will be all
right.
"I wouldn't say that Knight coaches by fear but his players are
afraid to lose. Smith coaches more from love, a father figure. But
North Carolina is disciplined in its own way, too."
Harshman said that North Carolina has better individual talent
than Indiana, but adds: "I thought LSU had much better talent than
Indiana and they lost in the semifinals (67-49)."
Oregon State Coach Ralph Miller, whose Beavers were top
ranked part of the season but lost an opening round tournament
game to Kansas State, says that defense is the key to Monday
night's game.
"I have a gut feeling that Indiana will win," Miller said, "but it's
not a strong opinion. Whenever you get this far in the tournament,
the team that plays the best defense usually wins Both teams are
good defensively, but which philosophy will be the best — Smith's or
Knight's?"
Knight and Smith play down any significance of two. great
coaching minds matching wits. But they will be.
Smith, like Knight, has done an admirable coaching job this sea
son. North Carolina (29-7) has peaked at the right time and got to the
final game by beating Virginia, 78-65, in the third meeting between
the Atlantic Coast Conference schools. The Cavaliers won the first
two games, but not the one that really mattered.
Smith's clogging zone defense bothered Virginia's seven-foot
four center Ralph Sampson, who got only 11 points and nine re
bounds. Knight will, as usual, rely on his man-to-man alignment.
