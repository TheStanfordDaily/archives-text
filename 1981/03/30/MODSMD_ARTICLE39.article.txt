Hostage shot, but flees hijacked jet
Bangkok, Thailand — An American hostage fleeing a hi
jacked Indonesian jetliner parked here was shot and
wounded in the back yesterday in the second confirmed es
cape from armed air pirates demanding the release of 84
"political prisoners" in Indonesia
Two other Americans were reported among the 55
hostages still aboard the Garuda Airlines DC-9. parked at
the Dor, Muang Airport tarmac since five hijackers di
verted it here from a domestic flight over Indonesia on
Saturday.
The wounded American, identified as Carl Schneider, is
in stable condition Earlier a British captive escaped
through an emergency exit and raced to a golf course while
airport workers refueled the craft to keep its generators —
and ventilation system — running
A Thai government spokesman said Indonesia agreed to
meet all the demands of the heavily armed hijackers, but
would only disclose the one demand — freedom for 84 Indo
nesian prisoners
Spokesman Trairong Suwankiri said, however, it was
unclear what country would accept the hijackers and the
prisoners
Speaking to reporters in the airport's makeshift emer
gency center yesterday night. Trairong said Thai and Indo
nesian officials awaited further word from the hijackers,
who took no visible action when the yesterday morning
deadline passed.
He said Sri Lanka turned down requests from the Thai
and Indonesian governments to allow the hijackers to pro
ceed to Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, with the pris
oners Sri Lanka, suggested by the hijackers as a destina
tion, said it "cannot accommodate" them.
Trairong said the other demands were internal affairs
of Indonesia.
Earlier reports said a DC-10. possibly carrying the freed
prisoners, left the Indonesian capital of Jakarta for Bang
kok. but the Thai spokesman would not confirm this.
Europeans disenchanted with nukes
Bonn — A grass-roots movement against nuclear arma
ment is growing in several key Western European coun
tries. leading some Western officials to worry that it could
become a political force strong enough to erode NATO
unity.
The antinuclear activists plan rallies and conferences
for this spring to dramatize their cause, timed to coincide
with a round of political and military strategy sessions by
Western alliance officials.
The demonstrators' specific objective is to prevent
deployment ot new U S -made nuclear missiles in Europe,
now planned to begin at the end of 1983. But their agitation
also reflects broader concern about the dangers of the nu
clear standoff on their continent.
When the decision to deploy the missiles was made in
December 1979 — coupled with an offer to negotiate with
the Soviet Union to limit such weapons — it was hailed as a
momentous political achievement. Officials said then it
was meant to signal the solidarity of the North Atlantic

Treaty Organization and to strengthen the West's position
in arms control talks by balancing off a Soviet buildup of
similar medium-range weapons aimed at Western Eu
rope.
But paradoxically the decision also has fanned the re
vival of the campaign against nuclear weapons in a
number of central and northern European countries.
India opposes US-Pakistan links
New Delhi — India is mounting a major diplomatic cam
paign to persuade the Reagan administration to abandon
plans to make Pakistan a front-line state against Soviet
advances in the Persian Gulf by selling it arms.
In a series of meetings here with Western ambassadors
whose governments are believed to have influence on
Washington. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government
has argued that large-scale U.S.-weapons sales to Paki
stan would destabilize the region, force India into an arms
race and drive it close to its major arms supplier, the Sovi
et Union.
The Indians maintain that arms sold to Pakistan as a
counter to Soviet expansion have twice ended up used
against this country.
Furthermore. Indian diplomats have insisted that re
vitalizing the formerly close defense links between Wash
ington and Islamabad would serve primarily to maintain
President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in power and once more
place the United States in the position of supporting an un
popular military government.
Bani-Sadr: Won't give in to clergy
Beirut, Lebanon — Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, Iran's em
battled president, says he has no intention of "surrender
ing"' to his militant, clergy-backed political opposition. He
also said Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is
"not God" and has "limited means" to deal with Iran's po
litical discord.
In a telephone interview from Tehran Saturday with The
Associated Press here. Bani-Sadr also said an Islamic
peace-seeking mission's proposal for a cease-fire in the
war between Iran and Iraq could be acceptable, depending
upon "clarification" he will seek when the mediators ar
rive in Tehran today.
Bani-Sadr is commander in chief of the Iranian military
as well as president and has come under criticism by the
clergv-dominated hardliners for his conduct of the war.
Hardline extremists have said they would not consider an
end to the war until the Baathist regime of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein is replaced with a "just Islamic govern
ment."
Bani-Sadr said Islamic mediators must determine who
started the 27-week-old Persian Gulf war and suggested
Iraq should pay reparations for war losses by Iran.
Two weeks ago, Khomeini ordered an end to the public
squabbling between Bani-Sadr. a Western-educated mod
erate. and Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Rajai, backed
by the Islamic fundamentalists.
Khomeini has generally supported Bani-Sadr and has
often warned that the clergy's extremism could backfire
into resentment by the masses. At the same time, he has

been seen as trying to strike a balance between the two
sides
San Salvador embassy fired on again
San Salvador — The latest attack on the U.S. Embassy,
a rocket-grenade and bullet salvo, has reminded the 65 un
easy Americans who work in the fortress-like compound of
their vulnerability in this war-torn nation.
"They were really trying to kill us," embassy spokes
woman Carol Doerflein said of the dozen men who poured
rifle fire at the building and blasted a hole in the third floor
with an anti-tank rocket on Wednesday. There were no in
juries.
"It was one of the few places they could hit the building
and not hurt anyone," Doerflein, of Toms River, N.J., said
in an interview in her basement office.
"The mood is tense ... We are afraid. There's no way
we cannot be afraid," she added.
The four-story embassy has been sprayed by gunfire
four times in the last three weeks but Wednesday's as
sault. staged with clockwork precision, was potentially
more deadly than any previous attempt.
The attacks on the embassy are believed to have been
carried out by extremists on the political left and the right.
El Salvador's leftists are trying to replace the U.S.-
backed civilian-military junta with a Marxist govern
ment, while rightists oppose the junta, claiming it has
shifted too far to the left.
Four men in a pick-up truck sprayed the embassy with '
gunfire earlier this month in an operation that one em
bassy official said had the trademarks of a right-wing at
tack. He declined to elaborate or to be identified.
Leftists are believed responsible for Wednesday's raid.
Soviets switch to daylight-saving
Moscow — The Soviet Union is switching to daylight
saving time this week for the first time in 50 years, and
some Soviets are finding the change more than a little per

plexing.
Despite a blitz of official publicity heralding the switch
— "Change Your Clocks On Time, Dear Comrades!" read
the front page of one Moscow newspaper — authorities
have received numerous complaints from confused and
worried citizens.
"People without experience ask questions," says
Vladimir Ilyin, a Bureau of Standards expert helping to ov
ersee the time change, 'I won't be able to go to sleep, I
won't be able to get up' . . . At first, people were thinking
they would have to go to work earlier, but public transport
would stay on the same schedule," he said in an interview.
A Ministry of Health magazine said "many parents are
worried that their children will take the time change bad
ly"
Soviet officialdom has responded to these concerns with
an extensive campaign of television, radio and newspaper
ads saying there is no cause for concern and urging Soviets
citizens to take the time change seriously.
Oscars doled tonight, Carson to MC
Hollywood — The 53rd Academy Awards will be pre
sented tonight, and most of the potential winners will be in
the glittering audience, even such non-enthusiasts as Hen
ry Fonda, Robert Redford and Robert De Niro.
The 75-year-old Fonda, who has long decried the com
petitive aspect of acting awards and who has never won an
Oscar in a 46-year film career, will receive a special
award for "his enduring contributions to the art of motion
pictures."
Redford and De Niro, who detest the hoopla of such af
fairs, have agreed to attend and are favorites to win as
best director and actor, respectively.
Johnny Carson returns as emcee of the telecast. Pres
enters range from 87-year-old King Vidor to 15-year-old
Brooke Shields.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows in the 40s. Highs in the 60s
to low 70s.
