William Kimball, a San Francisco
businessman, will succeed Peter Bing
as president of the University Board
of Trustees pending board approval in
June, the Daily has learned.
The board's nominating committee
recommended the 61-year-old owner
of Kimball & Co., a San Francisco fi
nancial consulting firm, earlier this
month, Robert Harnrdla — assistant
to the president for trustee affairs —
confirmed last week.
The board will vote on that recom
mendation in June — along with rec
ommendations for other board offices
to be filled
Bing, 47, was appointed to a five
year term as the board's chairman in
1976. Bing will leave the board entire
ly, although he hopes to remain on the
Stanford hospital board, according to
Joel Smith, the University's senior of
ficer working as a staff member with
the nominating committee.
Bing was unavailable for comment.
"He faced most things that could
come up in the life of a major univer
sity" including the appointment of a
new f>Jit unci ' 'significant prc>k>-
lems in the Medical Center," Smith
noted of Bing
Smith said Bing had planned to
leave the board last year, but the
board prevailed upon him to stay be
cause of the change in another prima
ry administrative position — the pres
idency — which occured last spring.
Kimball, a 1941 Stanford graduate,
is currently serving his second term as
a trustee. He has occupied top posts on
the board, including national major
gifts chairman of Stanford's volunteer
fundraising organization.
According to several trustees. Kim
ball's experience in fundraising and
development were major considera
tions in his nomination, especially in
light of severe financial challenges the
University will face in the next few
years. The University has already an
nounced its plans to seek more funds
from the private sector, especially in
light of proposed federal budget cuts
which will limit research and educa
tional grants.
Kimball will likely play a key role in
developing "alternative forms of fun
ding" for the University, according to
Trustee John Grey, president of Stan
dard Oil of California.
Kimball has displayed leadership
both in fundraising and development

and he has had very broad experience
on the board. Smith said
"He is extremely able," Grey said.
"As board members move from posi
tion to position on the board they must
display other qualities (besides fun
draising abilities). I think Bill Kim
ball has those other qualities."
All members of the board were
eligible for the chairmanship, accord
ing to Smith. The search was mainly
conducted by trustee John Gardner,
head of Common Cause, who con
tacted each trustee individually and
asked for recommendations. Several
trustees noted that because of the
large time commitment demanded of
the board's president, Kimball's resi
dence in California was also an impor
tant consideration in their recommen
dations.
"I'm just delighted that the
judgment of the committee agrees
with my own," according to Trustee
Peter Haas, chairman of the board of
Levi Strauss & Co. (Kimball also sits
as a director for Levi Strauss).
Haas said Kimball is "able,
thoughtful and unflappable."
TrtMmtmmm Kim
ball's proven "dedication to Stanford"
as particularly important qualities as
well. Smith called finances "fun
damental" considerations of the
board, not because they are a "trustee
fascination" but because they are cen
tral to the running of Stanford.
Melvin Lane, president of Lane
Publishing Company, publishers of
Sunset magazine, was also elected
this month to a five-year term as
trustee Lane is a 1944 graduate of the
University.
