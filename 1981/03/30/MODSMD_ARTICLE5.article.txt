# Democrat groups seek alternative budget cuts
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Ever since President
Ronald Reagan unwrapped his blue
print for dramatic budget cuts, con
gressional Democrats have been
searching for ways to satisfy the popu
lar demand for reduced federal spend
ing, yet spare the social programs so

dear to the hearts of their political
supporters.
The task, by no means easy, has oc
cupied the talents of a diverse array of
groups. There is an 18-member Con
gressional Black Caucus, for instance,
which decries Reagan's proposals as a
"Robin Hood in reverse" scheme to
take from the poor and give to the rich.
There also is the so-called "Gang of
Four," Democratic Young Turks on
the House Budget Committee who
serve as a spending cut think-tank for
Democratic House leaders.
So far. however, the Democrats are
having trouble hatching workable al
ternatives — alternatives that do not
hinge on politically improbable tax
changes or other budgetary gim
micks.
One qf the major obstacles is the
sheer arithmetic in Congress favoring
the president. Republicans command
a 53-47 majority in the Senate and,
when conservative Democrats are
folded into their numbers, hold a
working majority in the 435-member
House.
Steep cuts inevitable
In addition, congressional Demo
crats who consider steep cuts in
evitable are having trouble per
suading some of their traditional al
lies, such as organized labor, to com
promise and accept any of Reagan's
proposals.
And Democrats struggling to design
an alternative budget are confronted
by the skill with which Reagan fash
ioned his own plan. Even the most dis
gruntled Democrats concede that the

president picked his spending targets
with great political shrewdness, beat
ing the opposition to the punch on the
easiest cuts and avoiding cuts that
would antagonize the most powerful of
the nation's voting blocs.
As a result, many Democrats have
been reduced to the unpalatable
choice of accepting a large number of
Reagan's proposals or striking defiant
postures that may hearten their con
stituents back home but are politically
unfeasible on Capitol Hill.
Credible alternative
"The bottom line is you've got to
come very close to Reagan's numbers
to develop any kind of credible alter
native." according to Rep. Leon Pan
etta (D-Calif ), one of the so-called
"Gang of Four." "If you don't, you
will be throwing something up in the
House that will come down in
flames."
Indeed, the gang — whose other
members are Norman Mineta (D-
Calif ), Timothy Wirth (D-Colo ), and
Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), is prepar
ing to go along with many of Reagan's
cutbacks, perhaps as much as $25
billion worth, but it also hopes to
salvage some programs under attack
from the White House by offering sub
stitute cuts.
Largest savings from social programs
The largest dollar savings in Rea
gan's proposal would come from re
ductions in such social programs as
food stamps, unemployment benefits.
Medicaid, subsidized housing, wel
fare, child nutrition programs and

black lung payments.
In contrast, the alternative budgets
being promoted by congressional
Democrats generally would spare
many or all of the social programs
from cutbacks, place greater em
phasis on obtaining savings by
eradicating waste and abuse and raise
additional tax revenues by eliminat
ing certain tax preferences chiefly
benefitting corporations.
The "Gang of Four" proposal, for
example, would cancel Reagan's pro
posed cuts for such items as Medicaid,
nutrition programs and some sub
sidized school lunches. On the other
hand, the four congressmen would ac
cept other proposed cuts in social pro
grams, such as repeal of the $122
monthly minimum Social Security
benefit.
Congressional Black Caucus
The Congressional Black Caucus,
however, refused to compromise on
social programs. The caucus proposal
would retain all social programs, and
it also calls for an additional $25 billion
in spending on them that would be paid
for out of an increase in tax revenues
of $27 billion.
The additional tax revenues would
be generated by eliminating tax pref
erences that traditionally have been
politically sensitive — among them,
deductions for business lunches, de
ferral of certain taxes on international
sales income of U.S. companies and oil
depletion allowances.

the nation's voting blocs.
As a result, many Democrats have
been reduced to the unpalatable
choice of accepting a large number of
Reagan's proposals or striking defiant
postures that may hearten their con
stituents back home but are politically
unfeasible on Capitol Hill.
Credible alternative
"The bottom line is you've got to
come very close to Reagan's numbers
to develop any kind of credible alter
native." according to Rep. Leon Pan
etta (D-Calif ), one of the so-called
"Gang of Four." "If you don't, you
will be throwing something up in the
House that will come down in
flames."
Indeed, the gang — whose other
members are Norman Mineta (D-
Calif ), Timothy Wirth (D-Colo ), and
Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), is prepar
ing to go along with many of Reagan's
cutbacks, perhaps as much as $25
billion worth, but it also hopes to
salvage some programs under attack
from the White House by offering sub
stitute cuts.
Largest savings from social programs
The largest dollar savings in Rea
gan's proposal would come from re
ductions in such social programs as
food stamps, unemployment benefits.
Medicaid, subsidized housing, wel
fare, child nutrition programs and

black lung payments.
In contrast, the alternative budgets
being promoted by congressional
Democrats generally would spare
many or all of the social programs
from cutbacks, place greater em
phasis on obtaining savings by
eradicating waste and abuse and raise
additional tax revenues by eliminat
ing certain tax preferences chiefly
benefitting corporations.
The "Gang of Four" proposal, for
example, would cancel Reagan's pro
posed cuts for such items as Medicaid,
nutrition programs and some sub
sidized school lunches. On the other
hand, the four congressmen would ac
cept other proposed cuts in social pro
grams, such as repeal of the $122
monthly minimum Social Security
benefit.
Congressional Black Caucus
The Congressional Black Caucus,
however, refused to compromise on
social programs. The caucus proposal
would retain all social programs, and
it also calls for an additional $25 billion
in spending on them that would be paid
for out of an increase in tax revenues
of $27 billion.
The additional tax revenues would
be generated by eliminating tax pref
erences that traditionally have been
politically sensitive — among them,
deductions for business lunches, de
ferral of certain taxes on international
sales income of U.S. companies and oil
depletion allowances.
Washington — Ever since President
Ronald Reagan unwrapped his blue
print for dramatic budget cuts, con
gressional Democrats have been
searching for ways to satisfy the popu
lar demand for reduced federal spend
ing, yet spare the social programs so

dear to the hearts of their political
supporters.
The task, by no means easy, has oc
cupied the talents of a diverse array of
groups. There is an 18-member Con
gressional Black Caucus, for instance,
which decries Reagan's proposals as a
"Robin Hood in reverse" scheme to
take from the poor and give to the rich.
There also is the so-called "Gang of
Four," Democratic Young Turks on
the House Budget Committee who
serve as a spending cut think-tank for
Democratic House leaders.
So far. however, the Democrats are
having trouble hatching workable al
ternatives — alternatives that do not
hinge on politically improbable tax
changes or other budgetary gim
micks.
One qf the major obstacles is the
sheer arithmetic in Congress favoring
the president. Republicans command
a 53-47 majority in the Senate and,
when conservative Democrats are
folded into their numbers, hold a
working majority in the 435-member
House.
Steep cuts inevitable
In addition, congressional Demo
crats who consider steep cuts in
evitable are having trouble per
suading some of their traditional al
lies, such as organized labor, to com
promise and accept any of Reagan's
proposals.
And Democrats struggling to design
an alternative budget are confronted
by the skill with which Reagan fash
ioned his own plan. Even the most dis
gruntled Democrats concede that the

president picked his spending targets
with great political shrewdness, beat
ing the opposition to the punch on the
easiest cuts and avoiding cuts that
would antagonize the most powerful of
the nation's voting blocs.
As a result, many Democrats have
been reduced to the unpalatable
choice of accepting a large number of
Reagan's proposals or striking defiant
postures that may hearten their con
stituents back home but are politically
unfeasible on Capitol Hill.
