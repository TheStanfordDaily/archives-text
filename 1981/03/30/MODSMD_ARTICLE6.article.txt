## Pakistan aid offer would help Gulf defense system, create buffer area 
### Los Angeles Times 
Islamabad, Pakistan — The
United States appears to be
ready to improve its troubled
relations with Pakistan as part
of an effort to strengthen de
fenses in the Persian Gulf re
gion.
From the U.S. point of view,
Pakistan, although its govern
ment is unpopular and author
itarian, is the only nation in the
region that is willing and and
able to play the role of buffer
state against any Soviet move
through Afghanistan toward the
Persian Gulf.
Also, an effective Pakistani
army could form part of a broad
security umbrella to protect
U.S. oil sources in the region,
notably Saudi Arabia.
A negative factor, from
Washington's standpoint, would
be that any U.S. move to im
prove relations with Pakistan
would strain Washington's ties
with India.
Defense line
For Pakistan, substantial
military aid would make it pos
sible to strengthen the weak de
fense line along its 1200-mile
border with Soviet-occupied Af
ghanistan.
Afghan and Soviet warplanes
reportedly penetrate Pakistani
air space at will. Noor Hussain.
a retired brigadier who now
heads Pakistan's Institute of
Strategic Studies, said he had
counted 200 violations last year.
U.S. aid would also coun
terbalance the arms acquired
recently by India Pakistan and
India have gone to war three
times since they became inde
pendent nations in 1947.
Yet troubling from the Paki
stani view is what they see as in
consistent U.S. support of Paki
stan.
A year ago, just after the So
viet invasion of Afghanistan, the
Carter administration offered
Pakistan a $400 million aid
package — half for military
purposes and half for economic
development. The government
of Gen Zia ul-Haq turned it
down as "peanuts."
Earlier, the Carter adminis
tration had cut off virtually all
aid to Pakistan because of Paki
stan's insistence on going ahead
with nuclear development. And
in 1965 Washington had sus
pended aid to Pakistan because
it was at war with India. Paki
stanis view these acts as betray
al.
Weapons
Still, unable to get the weap
ons it believes it needs from Chi
na, its most consistent ally, or
from its sister nations in the
Moslem world, Pakistan has
turned again to the United
States.
Pakistan s army, though
poorly equipped, is generally re
garded as the most professional
in the Moslem world. Saudi Ara
bia, site of the holiest Moslem
cities, has relatively small

armed forces, and Zia ul-Haq
has said publicly that if Paki
stan were called on to defend
Saudi Arabia, he would lead the
troops in person.
It is believed that Saudi Ara
bia would help finance a major
share of any Pakistani arms
purchase from the United States
as part of a deal that would
earmark certain Pakistani
army units to bolster Saudi Ara
bia's internal security if neces
sary.
Some sources believe that the
Saudi-Pakistani part of the pact
has already been agreed to and
that as many as 25.000 Pakistani
troops have been sent to Saudi
Arabia Western diplomats in
Jidda say they have no evidence
of any sizable Pakistani force in
the country.
What seems likely is that cer
tain Pakistani units would be
designated as a rapid-deploy
ment force, ready to move at
Saudi request. Troops from a
nonaligned Moslem country like
Pakistan could be deployed in
Saudi Arabia without the politi
cal repercussions that any
direct U.S. involvement would
bring, political analysts here be
lieve.
Nuclear block
A potential stumbling block to
any shipment of U.S. arms to
Pakistan is U.S. legislation that
prohibits aid to countries that
refuse to accept international
inspection of their nuclear pro
grams. Pakistan has consistent
ly refused to open its nuclear de
velopment to inspection.
However, according to people
thought to be close to the Rea
gan administration. President
Reagan might be willing to to
lerate Pakistan's independent
nuclear program in return for
benefits that military as
sistance would bring.
Military experts here agree
with Pakistani assessments
that Pakistan's armed forces
are seriously under-equipped.
Pakistan's air force is said to be
obsolete.
Pakistan's highly pro
fessional but ill-equipped army
is in similar straits.
Most military sources agree
with Pakistani assessments
that modern tanks and anti-tank
missiles as well as improved
air-to-ground, surface-to-air
and air-to-air missile systems
are needed to build a credible
defense on its western frontier
with Afghanistan.
Shahi rejected any possibility
of U.S. military bases in Paki
stan as part of an American ef
fort to protect Persian Gulf oil
lanes, saying that they would
jeopardize Pakistan's status as
a non-aligned nation.
The U.S. aid offer to Pakistan
comes as Zia's regime faces the
rumblings of domestic unrest,
which many observers believed
could easily be channeled
against his fragile rule.
The idea of any major U.S.

commitment to an unpopular
military regime facing confron
tation in the streets is unsettling
to a number of American policy
makers. especially in light of
the recent U.S. experience in
Iran.
American diplomats here,
however, reject any com
parison with Iran, arguing that
Zia's relatively mild martial
law and his austere, religious
personal lifestyle differ
markedly from that of the late
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
Islamic revivalism
The powerful forces of Islam
ic revivalism that brought down
the shah form an integral part of
Zia's policies, they point out.
Both Pakistani and foreign
political observers believe that
if Zia does fall, he would proba
bly be replaced by another gen
eral rather than by a radical po
litical or religious leader.
Zia has ruled the country

since deposing Prime Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in July. 1977.
Many observers believed that
his refusal to stay Bhutto's
April 1979 execution would
quickly precipitate his own
downfall. However, he has con
sistently survived crises and
postponed elections to remain in
power.
A key to Zia's survival has
been a popular view that his mil
itary rule is preferable to Paki
stan's squabbling, ineffectual
politicians, diplomats believe.
Earlier this month, however,
leaders of nine banned political
parties met in Karachi and man
aged to agree on a joint declara
tion demanding that Zia end
martial law and conduct elec
tions within three months.
Among the signers was Bhutto's
widow, Nusrat, now president of
the Pakistan People's Party
(PPP), which her husband
founded.

Both Pakistani and foreign

Zia has ruled the country

since deposing Prime Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in July. 1977.
Many observers believed that
his refusal to stay Bhutto's
April 1979 execution would
quickly precipitate his own
downfall. However, he has con
sistently survived crises and
postponed elections to remain in
power.
A key to Zia's survival has
been a popular view that his mil

politicians, diplomats believe.
Earlier this month, however,
leaders of nine banned political
parties met in Karachi and man
aged to agree on a joint declara

martial law and conduct elec

Islamabad, Pakistan — The
United States appears to be
ready to improve its troubled
relations with Pakistan as part
of an effort to strengthen de
fenses in the Persian Gulf re
gion.
From the U.S. point of view,
Pakistan, although its govern
ment is unpopular and author
itarian, is the only nation in the
region that is willing and and
able to play the role of buffer
state against any Soviet move
through Afghanistan toward the
Persian Gulf.
Also, an effective Pakistani
army could form part of a broad
security umbrella to protect
U.S. oil sources in the region,
notably Saudi Arabia.
A negative factor, from
Washington's standpoint, would
be that any U.S. move to im
prove relations with Pakistan
would strain Washington's ties
with India.
Defense line
For Pakistan, substantial
military aid would make it pos
sible to strengthen the weak de
fense line along its 1200-mile
border with Soviet-occupied Af
ghanistan.
Afghan and Soviet warplanes
reportedly penetrate Pakistani
air space at will. Noor Hussain.
a retired brigadier who now
heads Pakistan's Institute of
Strategic Studies, said he had
counted 200 violations last year.
U.S. aid would also coun
terbalance the arms acquired
recently by India Pakistan and
India have gone to war three
times since they became inde
pendent nations in 1947.
Yet troubling from the Paki
stani view is what they see as in
consistent U.S. support of Paki
stan.
A year ago, just after the So
viet invasion of Afghanistan, the
Carter administration offered
Pakistan a $400 million aid
package — half for military
purposes and half for economic
development. The government
of Gen Zia ul-Haq turned it
down as "peanuts."
Earlier, the Carter adminis
tration had cut off virtually all
aid to Pakistan because of Paki
stan's insistence on going ahead
with nuclear development. And
in 1965 Washington had sus
pended aid to Pakistan because
it was at war with India. Paki
stanis view these acts as betray
al.
Weapons
Still, unable to get the weap
ons it believes it needs from Chi
na, its most consistent ally, or
from its sister nations in the
Moslem world, Pakistan has
turned again to the United
States.
Pakistan s army, though
poorly equipped, is generally re
garded as the most professional
in the Moslem world. Saudi Ara
bia, site of the holiest Moslem
cities, has relatively small

armed forces, and Zia ul-Haq
has said publicly that if Paki
stan were called on to defend
Saudi Arabia, he would lead the
troops in person.
It is believed that Saudi Ara
bia would help finance a major
share of any Pakistani arms
purchase from the United States
as part of a deal that would
earmark certain Pakistani
army units to bolster Saudi Ara
bia's internal security if neces
sary.
Some sources believe that the
Saudi-Pakistani part of the pact
has already been agreed to and
that as many as 25.000 Pakistani
troops have been sent to Saudi
Arabia Western diplomats in
Jidda say they have no evidence
of any sizable Pakistani force in
the country.
What seems likely is that cer
tain Pakistani units would be
designated as a rapid-deploy
ment force, ready to move at
Saudi request. Troops from a
nonaligned Moslem country like
Pakistan could be deployed in
Saudi Arabia without the politi
cal repercussions that any
direct U.S. involvement would
bring, political analysts here be
lieve.
Nuclear block
A potential stumbling block to
any shipment of U.S. arms to
Pakistan is U.S. legislation that
prohibits aid to countries that
refuse to accept international
inspection of their nuclear pro
grams. Pakistan has consistent
ly refused to open its nuclear de
velopment to inspection.
However, according to people
thought to be close to the Rea
gan administration. President
Reagan might be willing to to
lerate Pakistan's independent
nuclear program in return for
benefits that military as
sistance would bring.
