# Mugabe warns U.S.
## Southern Africa balance at stake 
### Washington Post 
Salisbury, Zimbabwe â€”
Prime Minister Robert Mugabe
said Saturday that the Reagan
administration is faced with
choosing between friendship
with black Africa or South
Africa.
The Zimbabwean leader bal
anced his carefully phrased re
marks with praise for the ad
ministration for its "very
positive" approach in pledging
$225 million in aid to the country
over the next three years at an
international donors conference
that ended Friday.
"Our hope is that the Reagan
administration does not move
closer to South Africa," Mugabe
told a press conference. If it did.
he added, "the U.S. adminis
tration would naturally have de
cided to make a choice between
us and South Africa which
choice we shall regret, but we
will continue to work as effec
tively as possible to make the
American administration see
things the way we see them."
South Africa dependence
While urging the United
States against choosing South
Africa, Mugabe's own attitude
toward his southern neighbor is
complicated by Zimbabwe's de
pendence on South Africa that
had intensified during 15 years
of international sanctions under
the former white minority gov
ernment.
Mugabe said Zimbabwe sup
ports the African move to im
pose economic sanctions
against South Africa over its re
fusal to grant Namibian inde
pendence, "but we cannot in
volve ourselves in sanctions"
because of economic links to the
south.

South Africa increased eco
nomic pressure on Zimbabwe
this week by serving one year's
notice that it intends to end the
preferential trade agreement
between the two nations.
Mugabe said the South
African move "was to be ex
pected. The attitude of South
Africa toward us has not been
that favorable."
Polarizing influence
The biggest problem for Zim
babwe's foreign relations is
neither East nor West, but rath
er South Africa. Any American
move in the direction of favor
ing the Pretoria regime could
polarize the region and force
countries like Zimbabwe to
choose between East and West.
A Western analyst here com
menting on Africa's antagonism
toward white-minority-ruled
South Africa noted last week
that Western economic aid, al
though badly needed, would
play a secondary role to the is
sue of South Africa. "There is no
way U.S. aid could ever com
pensate for a wrong position on
South Africa on the racial is
sue."
"It would lose the blacks and
knock U.S. aid out of business"
in the area, he said. Such a de
velopment, he added, would
mean the United States could
not have a negotiating role in
seeking a peaceful alternative
to racial conflict in southern
Africa.
Just as the Reagan adminis
tration seems to be dividing the
world between the friends and
enemies of the Soviet Union,
black Africa regards a nation's
attitude toward South Africa as
a litmus test of friendship.
