# Discontent with U.S. influence growing stronger
## Philippines' opposition awaits election crossroads 
### From the Daily wire services 
Manila, Philippines — Whatever happened to
U.S. clout abroad? According to opposition lead
ers here, it is alive and well — and keeping Presi
dent Ferdinand Marcos in office seven years after
his last elected term expired.
Even human rights advocate Jimmy Carter lob
bied against punitive aid cuts in order to protect
U.S. bases.
Marcos, on the other hand, charges that Ameri
can authorities have looked the other way while
Filipino dissidents channel personnel, funds and
supplies — bombs, even — to terrorists bent on un
dermining his regime.
That is typical of politics in the Philippines:
People agree on very little — except perhaps that
Marcos' 15-year reign has not lived up to the in
itial promise and may be approaching a
crossroads. Some see a violent one.
The Philippines' only living ex-president,
Diosdado Macapagal, does not expect a Com
munist victory — provided Marcos hands over
power before moderates are driven into an al
liance with the Communists. "The people are fed
up," Macapagal, 70, said recently. "The only
thing propping up Marcos is the United States."
American role
The American role is real enough, if not exactly
the kingmaking one many say it is.
Subic Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base —
near Manila on the Bataan Peninsula — con
tribute millions to the Philippine economy and
free the republic's estimable armed forces for
full-time attention to internal security.
American businesses have invested roughly $1
billion in the country. Direct U.S. economic aid
and world bank loans have provided hundreds of
millions more.
And because Subic and Clark harbor the nuclear
clout on which the United States leans to keep
open its seaways through Southeast Asia to the
Mideast, strategic planners have good reason to
cultivate a stable regime in Manila's Malacanang
Palace.
The problem here — as it was in the shah's Iran
— is that feeling against the 65-year-old Marcos
quickly translates into anti-American feeling be
cause of the perceived linkage, so too much atten
tion to Marcos could endanger the bases under the
next regime.
"Yes, the United States is very influential," a
veteran U.S. diplomat noted. "But the United
States doesn't keep Marcos in power. If any one
thing, it's the lack of a real alternative."
Alternative
Whether intentionally or not, Marcos appears
to be preparing an alternative in the person of his
wife, Imelda.
Opposition leaders are convinced that once
Marcos' proposed constitutional amendments win
ratification in a referendum this spring, his wife
will receive the title of prime minister. She's not
without titles already: first lady (since 1965), gov
ernor of the metropolitan Manila province (since
1975), minister of human settlement in the na
tional Cabinet (since 1978). All of her posts are ap
pointive.

'The United States doesn't keep
Marcos in power. If any one thing,
it's the lack of a real alternative,'
said one veteran U.S. diplomat.

Yet Mrs. Marcos' personal achievements are
undeniable — pushing through family planning,
for instance, in a staunchly Roman Catholic coun
try, or galvanizing bureaucrats into action on fa
vorite projects such as the imposing national cul
tural center on Manila Bay, or roving the world,
from Beijing to Washington, as her husband's spe
cial envoy.
Opposition
In the moderate opposition camp, top leaders
charge that Marcos dare not turn over the presi
dency to anyone else.
"They have tremendous wealth," said a famous
leader of the pre-Marcos period. Keeping the
presidency, he said, is "the only way to protect

The leader suggested that, in Marcos' absence,
his wife would rule like Isabel Peron in Argentina.
In that case, he continued. "The military will
have to take over."
With or without martial law, and whether or not
Mrs. Marcos expands her power base, the pros
pect of six more years under the Marcoses has
stirred new talk of violent opposition. The dis
sidence springs not just from the predictable
groups: activist students and hard-core leftists.
Marcos charges that even Roman Catholic priests
have joined forces with the Communist New Peo
ples Army in central Luzon, where promises of
land reform have failed to appease the peasantry.
On the sugarcane-growing island of Negros, mili
tary and civil officials are accused of summarily
executing church lay workers who were organiz
ing the field hands.
Guerrilla operations
There has been no resurgence this year of urban
guerrilla operations. Marcos' highly effective in
ternal intelligence service saw to it that the two
main terrorist groups here were quickly broken
up.
A Moslem separatist movement in Mindanao
and the Sulu archipelago, although pursuing total
ly different aims from the main political opposi
tion and separated by large spans of water from
any collaboration, is causing further trouble for
the Marcos regime.

Marcos' 15-year reign has not
lived up to the initial promise
and may be approaching a
crossroads. Some see a violent
one.

The legitimate opposition, UNIDO — the Unit
ed Democratic Opposition — sees no hope for nor
mal political activity under the legislative and
electoral rules Marcos is setting in place. "If you
control the mass media and the army, you control
everything," observed former Senator Jovita
Salonga, the maimed victim of a pre-martial law
bombing who is now charged with involvement in
the April 6 Movement. He said that control will
force "cheating" on elections.
Slow-paced development
In a genuinely free election, Marcos would have
to answer for the slow pace of rural development
and land reform, increasing destitution among
the urban unemployed, vastly increased foreign
indebtedness, and overconcentration of invest
ment on showy, non-productive projects like re
sorts — not to mention the enrichment of his rela
tives and friends.
The opposition, on the other hand, is burdened
with its own disunity, the lack of a convincing al
ternative to the Marcos economic plan and the un
deniable fact that many anti-Marcos leaders did
no better by the economy when they held office
before him.
Perhaps Marcos will turn out to be completely
sincere in his promises about restored de
mocracy, or perhaps a commanding opponent will
emerge from the spring election despite the re
gime's close control over the ballot boxes.
Perhaps Filipinos' traditionally languid
adherence to bahala na — let the fates decide —
will prevail and Marcos will continue on a middle
road between American-style freedom and Asian
style despotism for lack of an alternative.
Or perhaps leftist revolt will explode among the
peasants and urban workers hit hardest by infla
tion and a pro-Communist regime will replace the
current pro-American one.
A continent might hang on the outcome. The
Philippines is where East met West successfully
— the only Christian nation in Asia, by far the
largest colony nurtured to democracy by the Unit
ed States, now the strategic gateway between the
Pacific and the Mideast.
And for better or worse its destiny pivots right
now on the wit and wisdom of a single man —
Ferdinand Marcos.

ples Army in central Luzon, where promises of
land reform have failed to appease the peasantry.
On the sugarcane-growing island of Negros, mili
tary and civil officials are accused of summarily
executing church lay workers who were organiz

Guerrilla operations
There has been no resurgence this year of urban
guerrilla operations. Marcos' highly effective in
ternal intelligence service saw to it that the two
main terrorist groups here were quickly broken
up.
A Moslem separatist movement in Mindanao
and the Sulu archipelago, although pursuing total
ly different aims from the main political opposi
tion and separated by large spans of water from
any collaboration, is causing further trouble for
the Marcos regime.

Marcos' 15-year reign has not
lived up to the initial promise
and may be approaching a
crossroads. Some see a violent
one.

The legitimate opposition, UNIDO — the Unit
ed Democratic Opposition — sees no hope for nor
mal political activity under the legislative and
electoral rules Marcos is setting in place. "If you
control the mass media and the army, you control
everything," observed former Senator Jovita
Salonga, the maimed victim of a pre-martial law
bombing who is now charged with involvement in
the April 6 Movement. He said that control will
force "cheating" on elections.
Slow-paced development
In a genuinely free election, Marcos would have
to answer for the slow pace of rural development
and land reform, increasing destitution among
the urban unemployed, vastly increased foreign
indebtedness, and overconcentration of invest
ment on showy, non-productive projects like re
sorts — not to mention the enrichment of his rela
tives and friends.
The opposition, on the other hand, is burdened
with its own disunity, the lack of a convincing al
ternative to the Marcos economic plan and the un
deniable fact that many anti-Marcos leaders did
no better by the economy when they held office
before him.
Perhaps Marcos will turn out to be completely
sincere in his promises about restored de
mocracy, or perhaps a commanding opponent will
emerge from the spring election despite the re
gime's close control over the ballot boxes.
Perhaps Filipinos' traditionally languid
adherence to bahala na — let the fates decide —
will prevail and Marcos will continue on a middle
road between American-style freedom and Asian
style despotism for lack of an alternative.
Or perhaps leftist revolt will explode among the
peasants and urban workers hit hardest by infla
tion and a pro-Communist regime will replace the
current pro-American one.
A continent might hang on the outcome. The
Philippines is where East met West successfully
— the only Christian nation in Asia, by far the
largest colony nurtured to democracy by the Unit
ed States, now the strategic gateway between the
Pacific and the Mideast.
And for better or worse its destiny pivots right
now on the wit and wisdom of a single man —
Ferdinand Marcos.
Manila, Philippines — Whatever happened to
U.S. clout abroad? According to opposition lead
ers here, it is alive and well — and keeping Presi
dent Ferdinand Marcos in office seven years after
his last elected term expired.
Even human rights advocate Jimmy Carter lob
bied against punitive aid cuts in order to protect
U.S. bases.
Marcos, on the other hand, charges that Ameri
can authorities have looked the other way while
Filipino dissidents channel personnel, funds and
supplies — bombs, even — to terrorists bent on un
dermining his regime.
That is typical of politics in the Philippines:
People agree on very little — except perhaps that
Marcos' 15-year reign has not lived up to the in
itial promise and may be approaching a
crossroads. Some see a violent one.
The Philippines' only living ex-president,
Diosdado Macapagal, does not expect a Com
munist victory — provided Marcos hands over
power before moderates are driven into an al
liance with the Communists. "The people are fed
up," Macapagal, 70, said recently. "The only
thing propping up Marcos is the United States."
American role
The American role is real enough, if not exactly
the kingmaking one many say it is.
Subic Naval Base and Clark Air Force Base —
near Manila on the Bataan Peninsula — con
tribute millions to the Philippine economy and
free the republic's estimable armed forces for
full-time attention to internal security.
American businesses have invested roughly $1
billion in the country. Direct U.S. economic aid
and world bank loans have provided hundreds of
millions more.
And because Subic and Clark harbor the nuclear
clout on which the United States leans to keep
open its seaways through Southeast Asia to the
Mideast, strategic planners have good reason to
cultivate a stable regime in Manila's Malacanang
Palace.
The problem here — as it was in the shah's Iran
— is that feeling against the 65-year-old Marcos
quickly translates into anti-American feeling be
cause of the perceived linkage, so too much atten
tion to Marcos could endanger the bases under the
next regime.
"Yes, the United States is very influential," a
veteran U.S. diplomat noted. "But the United
States doesn't keep Marcos in power. If any one
thing, it's the lack of a real alternative."
Alternative
Whether intentionally or not, Marcos appears
to be preparing an alternative in the person of his
wife, Imelda.
Opposition leaders are convinced that once
Marcos' proposed constitutional amendments win
ratification in a referendum this spring, his wife
will receive the title of prime minister. She's not
without titles already: first lady (since 1965), gov
ernor of the metropolitan Manila province (since
1975), minister of human settlement in the na
tional Cabinet (since 1978). All of her posts are ap
pointive.

'The United States doesn't keep
Marcos in power. If any one thing,
it's the lack of a real alternative,'
said one veteran U.S. diplomat.

Yet Mrs. Marcos' personal achievements are
undeniable — pushing through family planning,
for instance, in a staunchly Roman Catholic coun
try, or galvanizing bureaucrats into action on fa
vorite projects such as the imposing national cul
tural center on Manila Bay, or roving the world,
from Beijing to Washington, as her husband's spe
cial envoy.
Opposition
In the moderate opposition camp, top leaders
charge that Marcos dare not turn over the presi
dency to anyone else.
"They have tremendous wealth," said a famous
leader of the pre-Marcos period. Keeping the
presidency, he said, is "the only way to protect

The leader suggested that, in Marcos' absence,
his wife would rule like Isabel Peron in Argentina.
In that case, he continued. "The military will
have to take over."
With or without martial law, and whether or not
Mrs. Marcos expands her power base, the pros
pect of six more years under the Marcoses has
stirred new talk of violent opposition. The dis
sidence springs not just from the predictable
groups: activist students and hard-core leftists.
