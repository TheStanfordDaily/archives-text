# Courts questioning privacy rights
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
San Francisco — When the
"right to privacy' amendment
to the California Constitution
was proposed to the voters in
1972, there was hardly any op
position.
The measure simply added
privacy to the list of the
citizen's inalienable rights. It
was designed to thwart in
trusive surveillance and data
gathering by government and
business — in a word, snooping.
The Legislative Analyst said its
fiscal impact would be: "none."
Small wonder the amendment
was approved by nearly two
thirds of the voters.
But since then, the right to
privacy has grown considerably
in California under decisions by
the state Supreme Court. The
justices have invoked the
amendment to strike down ev
erything from undercover po
lice investigations to municipal
"anti-commune" ordinances to
limits on state-paid abortions
for low-income women.
"Traditionally, the right to
privacy was seen as a right to be
secure from unnecessary in
trusion — prying eyes or illegal
searches," observed Scott Bice,
dean of the University of South
ern California law school.

"What's happened in Califor
nia is that the court has ex
panded that right to include the
notion of personal autonomy, or
personal liberty. And it's gone
further under the state Constitu
tion than the U.S. Supreme
Court has under the federal Con
stitution," Bice said.
Now, that sweeping ex
pansion of the right to privacy
has rekindled the long-standing
controversy over how far the
courts should go in enlarging the
intent of the measure at issue.
The debate has crystallized in
the state Supreme Court — most
currently over the justices' de
cision last week invoking the
right to privacy to effectively
guarantee tax-funded abortions
to the poor.
In its ruling, the court in
validated three successive leg
islative acts denying Medi-Cal
(California's version of Medi
care) benefits for abortions un
less the mother's life was in
danger, the pregnancy resulted
from rape or incest or where
tests showed the child might be
born with genetic defects.
The court said that as long as
the state provided medical care
in general, it could not deny ben
efits for abortions Because the
Medi-Cal program is well-estab

lished and not likely to be aban
doned. the effect of the decision
was to establish a constitutional
right to a tax-funded abortion —
something the U.S. Supreme
Court thus far has refused to de
clare.
Justice Mathew Tobriner,
writing the court's lead opinion,
cited the 1972 constitutional
amendment, concluding that
the state's interest in protecting
the non-viable unborn child was
"subordinate to the woman's

right to privacy" in choosing be
tween childbirth and abortion
Justice Frank Richardson,
dissenting in the court's 4 to 2
ruling, ridiculed the idea that
the voters, in passing the
amendment, had any intention
of guaranteeing abortions for
the poor. That notion was "pure
invention" by the court majori
ty, he said.
"Certainly, the people did not
intend to extend 'privacy' to en
