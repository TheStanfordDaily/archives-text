From the Daily wire services
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan wa? shot in the chest yester
day by a youthful gunman who tried to
assassinate him with a blaze of .22-
caliber pistol fire that critically in
jured White House Press Secretary
James Brady and felled two other
men.
Reagan "sailed through surgery."
according to doctors who said he
would be ready to make presidential
decisions by today.
But Brady was said to be fighting
for his life, a bullet through his brain.
A sandy-haired man from suburban
Denver — described as "wandering,
aimless and irresponsible" — was
wrestled into handcuffs moments af
ter the assailant leveled his pistol and

fired six times at Reagan from near
point-blank range. The Secret Service
identified him as John WarnocK
Hinckley, Jr., 25, of Evergreen. Colo.
Near midnight last night, Hinckley
was led into a federal courtroom and
formally charged with attempting to
assassinate the president, and with as
saulting a Secret Service officer. He
also faces a charge of assault with in
tent to kill a policeman.
Reagan's condition stable
Dr Dennis O'Leary said "a really
mangled bullet" was removed from
Reagan's left lung. He said the 70-
year-old president's condition was
stable, the prognosis excellent, and
that he guessed Reagan probably
would be hospitalized for about two
weeks.

Two other persons were seriously
wounded in the assassination at
tempt: a Secret Service agent,
Timothy McCarthy. 31, and a District
of Columbia policeman, Thomas De
lahanty. 45. They were reported in se
rious condition but apparently not in
danger.
There was no known motive, no ex
planation for the savage burst of gun
fire that exploded as the president
stood beside his limousine, ready to
step inside for the one-mile ride back
to the White House.
Former neo-Nazi
Harold Covington, a leader of the
neo-Nazi National Socialist Party of
America, said early today that
Hinckley was a member of the party,
but never active. He said Hinckley
quit the party in 1979.
The gunman fired six shots in rapid
succession at the president as he and
his party left the Washington Hilton
Hotel following a speech to a union
convention. He fired at close range,
from a distance of no more than 10 to
15 feet from the president, witnesses
said.
The assassination attempt touched
off an air of national crisis, with Vice
President George Bush hurriedly
flying back to the capitol from a
speaking engagement in Texas in case
he was called on to assume presiden
tial duties. The Senate adjourned ear
ly and in New York, both the New
York and American stock exchanges
immediately halted all trading.
O'Leary, dean of George Washing
ton University Hospital for Clinical
Affairs, said that the president was in
the operating room for two hours, but
45 minutes of that time was spent
making certain that there was no
bleeding in the abdominal cavity.
The bullet that hit Reagan entered
under his arm pit, ricocheted off his
seventh rib and penetrated the lung.
The lung collapsed, but physicians re

inflated it in the emergency room
before the operation.
The surgery was performed by two
physicians on the hospital staff — Ben
jamin Aaron, a cardiovascular
surgeon, and Joseph Giordano, head of
the hospital trauma team.
Reagan was smiling and walking on
the sidewalk outside the hotel, ap
proaching his limousine, when several
persons in a small crowd nearby
shouted, "Mr. President." He turned
toward the crowd as shots rang out.
The president looked stunned as a
Secret Service agent quickly shoved
him into the waiting limousine. The
car sped off to George Washington
University Hospital.
He walked unassisted into the hospi
tal, holding his right hand to his left
chest, a spot of blood showing on his
shirt. And he remained conscious
before the operation, joking with aides
and friends who visited him.

Reagan said to his wife, "Honey. I
guess I just forgot to duck " And he
told a close friend. Sen Paul Laxalt
(R-Nev), "Don't worry about me I'll
make it."
He winked at James Baker, White
House chief of staff, as he was being
wheeled into the operating room and
told his physicians, "Please tell me
you're Republicans."
Despite the president's joking, the
shooting and the seriousness of the in
jury left Washington and much of the
country in a state of shock
Prayer in Senate
The Senate was reconvened shortly
after 6 p.m. by the majority leader.
Sen. Howard Baker, < R-Tenn), so that
Sen. John Danforth. (R-Mol, an
Episcopal priest, could deliver a
prayer for the president, another for
the other victims and a third one for
the country.
One witness. John Dodson. 30. a

computer programmer, told the Los
A nut'lf* Timfs that he saw Hinkley
several minutes before the shooting
and that the suspect was "real fidg
ety."
Dodson said he was looking out the
window of a building across the street
from the hotel entrance and "saw this
guy standing around for five minutes
before Reagan came out. "
"He was real fidgety," Dodson said,
"walking around in little circles, look
ing into the air Reagan came out and I
heard this pop-pop-pop and three guys
went down. He (the gunman > was only
15 to 17 feet from the president "
Another witness. Adrian Seay, 19,
said that he was standing near the gun
man shortly before the shooting and
that the suspect made a strange com
ment about "it being rainy but too nice
to be out there."
Seay said he backed away from the
