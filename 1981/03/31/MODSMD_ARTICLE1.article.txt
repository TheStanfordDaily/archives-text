## President may assume duties today 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan wa? shot in the chest yester
day by a youthful gunman who tried to
assassinate him with a blaze of .22-
caliber pistol fire that critically in
jured White House Press Secretary
James Brady and felled two other
men.
Reagan "sailed through surgery."
according to doctors who said he
would be ready to make presidential
decisions by today.
But Brady was said to be fighting
for his life, a bullet through his brain.
A sandy-haired man from suburban
Denver — described as "wandering,
aimless and irresponsible" — was
wrestled into handcuffs moments af
ter the assailant leveled his pistol and

fired six times at Reagan from near
point-blank range. The Secret Service
identified him as John WarnocK
Hinckley, Jr., 25, of Evergreen. Colo.
Near midnight last night, Hinckley
was led into a federal courtroom and
formally charged with attempting to
assassinate the president, and with as
saulting a Secret Service officer. He
also faces a charge of assault with in
tent to kill a policeman.
Reagan's condition stable
Dr Dennis O'Leary said "a really
mangled bullet" was removed from
Reagan's left lung. He said the 70-
year-old president's condition was
stable, the prognosis excellent, and
that he guessed Reagan probably
would be hospitalized for about two
weeks.

Two other persons were seriously
wounded in the assassination at
tempt: a Secret Service agent,
Timothy McCarthy. 31, and a District
of Columbia policeman, Thomas De
lahanty. 45. They were reported in se
rious condition but apparently not in
danger.
There was no known motive, no ex
planation for the savage burst of gun
fire that exploded as the president
stood beside his limousine, ready to
step inside for the one-mile ride back
to the White House.
Former neo-Nazi
Harold Covington, a leader of the
neo-Nazi National Socialist Party of
America, said early today that
Hinckley was a member of the party,
but never active. He said Hinckley
quit the party in 1979.
The gunman fired six shots in rapid
succession at the president as he and
his party left the Washington Hilton
Hotel following a speech to a union
convention. He fired at close range,
from a distance of no more than 10 to
15 feet from the president, witnesses
said.
The assassination attempt touched
off an air of national crisis, with Vice
President George Bush hurriedly
flying back to the capitol from a
speaking engagement in Texas in case
he was called on to assume presiden
tial duties. The Senate adjourned ear
ly and in New York, both the New
York and American stock exchanges
immediately halted all trading.
O'Leary, dean of George Washing
ton University Hospital for Clinical
Affairs, said that the president was in
the operating room for two hours, but
45 minutes of that time was spent
making certain that there was no
bleeding in the abdominal cavity.
The bullet that hit Reagan entered
under his arm pit, ricocheted off his
seventh rib and penetrated the lung.
The lung collapsed, but physicians re

inflated it in the emergency room
before the operation.
The surgery was performed by two
physicians on the hospital staff — Ben
jamin Aaron, a cardiovascular
surgeon, and Joseph Giordano, head of
the hospital trauma team.
Reagan was smiling and walking on
the sidewalk outside the hotel, ap
proaching his limousine, when several
persons in a small crowd nearby
shouted, "Mr. President." He turned
toward the crowd as shots rang out.
The president looked stunned as a
Secret Service agent quickly shoved
him into the waiting limousine. The
car sped off to George Washington
University Hospital.
He walked unassisted into the hospi
tal, holding his right hand to his left
chest, a spot of blood showing on his
shirt. And he remained conscious
before the operation, joking with aides
and friends who visited him.

Reagan said to his wife, "Honey. I
guess I just forgot to duck " And he
told a close friend. Sen Paul Laxalt
(R-Nev), "Don't worry about me I'll
make it."
He winked at James Baker, White
House chief of staff, as he was being
wheeled into the operating room and
told his physicians, "Please tell me
you're Republicans."
Despite the president's joking, the
shooting and the seriousness of the in
jury left Washington and much of the
country in a state of shock

The Senate was reconvened shortly
after 6 p.m. by the majority leader.
Sen. Howard Baker, < R-Tenn), so that
Sen. John Danforth. (R-Mol, an
Episcopal priest, could deliver a
prayer for the president, another for
the other victims and a third one for
the country.
One witness. John Dodson. 30. a

computer programmer, told the Los
A nut'lf* Timfs that he saw Hinkley
several minutes before the shooting
and that the suspect was "real fidg

Dodson said he was looking out the
window of a building across the street
from the hotel entrance and "saw this
guy standing around for five minutes
before Reagan came out. "
"He was real fidgety," Dodson said,
"walking around in little circles, look
ing into the air Reagan came out and I
heard this pop-pop-pop and three guys
went down. He (the gunman > was only
15 to 17 feet from the president "
Another witness. Adrian Seay, 19,
said that he was standing near the gun
man shortly before the shooting and
that the suspect made a strange com
ment about "it being rainy but too nice
to be out there."
Seay said he backed away from the

man and said, "I'll see you" and
Hiijkley replied, "You won't see me
any more."
"All of a sudden a gun fired," Seay
said, "and I fell to the ground. And
then the police knocked him down."
Hank Brown, a cameraman for
ABC-TV who filmed the shooting, said
that the suspect did not say anything,
but "just opened up'and continued
squeezing the trigger."
The gunman was among a cluster of
several persons, including reporters
and onlookers, who were standing be
hind a velvet rope used to cordon off
the crowd.
Pandemonium broke out as the
shots were fired. Brady, McCarthy
and Delahanty all slumped to the side
walk.
Brady, pudgy and balding, known
for his affability and sense of humor,
lay face down. He raised his head once
or twice and then was still. Someone
placed a handerchief under his head
but a pool of blood had already formed
on the sidewalk.
A hand gun was lying near his head.
The other victims lay nearby, almost
within reach of Brady, both lying still.
In the Senate, Baker interrupted de
bate on the president's proposed
budget cuts at 2.43 p.m. (EST) to an
nounce the shootings, but before
learning that Reagan had been hit.
Half an hour later, on learning Rea
gan also had been hit, Baker halted
further debate on the budget and re
cessed the Senate.

Following Baker!s first announce
ment, Sen. Edward Kennedy, (D-
Mass), who had been sitting at his
desk in the rear, arose, a tremble in
his voice.
"I am saddened, as I am sure all of
the members of this body are, at the
news of the attack on President Rea
gan," Kennedy said. "My family has
been touched by violence." He re
called the assassinations of his
brothers, John and Robert, and of oth
er political and civil rights leaders.
"Violence and hatred have no place
in our society or in our country," Ken
nedy said. "They know no parti
sanship, they know no party, they
know no rationality. Nonetheless, we
see it continue in our society and in our

country.
"All of us who care about this coun
try and who care about our fellow
citizens bear an important responsi l
bility in whatever way we possibly can
to rid this society and to rid this coun
try of the kind of violence and hatred
that we have seen."
Reagan had just finished addressing
4000 delegates to a national con
ference of the Building and Construc
tion Trades Department of the AFL
CIO. This was not a friendly group for
the president. The organization's
president, Robert Georgine, had ac
tively worked for President Jimmy
Carter during the 1980 election cam
paign and so had many of the leaders
of the various trade unions.

From the Daily wire services
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan wa? shot in the chest yester
day by a youthful gunman who tried to
assassinate him with a blaze of .22-
caliber pistol fire that critically in
jured White House Press Secretary
James Brady and felled two other
men.
Reagan "sailed through surgery."
according to doctors who said he
would be ready to make presidential
decisions by today.
But Brady was said to be fighting
for his life, a bullet through his brain.
A sandy-haired man from suburban
Denver — described as "wandering,
aimless and irresponsible" — was
wrestled into handcuffs moments af
ter the assailant leveled his pistol and

fired six times at Reagan from near
point-blank range. The Secret Service
identified him as John WarnocK
Hinckley, Jr., 25, of Evergreen. Colo.
Near midnight last night, Hinckley
was led into a federal courtroom and
formally charged with attempting to
assassinate the president, and with as
saulting a Secret Service officer. He
also faces a charge of assault with in
tent to kill a policeman.
Reagan's condition stable
Dr Dennis O'Leary said "a really
mangled bullet" was removed from
Reagan's left lung. He said the 70-
year-old president's condition was
stable, the prognosis excellent, and
that he guessed Reagan probably
would be hospitalized for about two
weeks.

Two other persons were seriously
wounded in the assassination at
tempt: a Secret Service agent,
Timothy McCarthy. 31, and a District
of Columbia policeman, Thomas De
lahanty. 45. They were reported in se
rious condition but apparently not in
danger.
There was no known motive, no ex
planation for the savage burst of gun
fire that exploded as the president
stood beside his limousine, ready to
step inside for the one-mile ride back
to the White House.
Former neo-Nazi
Harold Covington, a leader of the
neo-Nazi National Socialist Party of
America, said early today that
Hinckley was a member of the party,
but never active. He said Hinckley
quit the party in 1979.
The gunman fired six shots in rapid
succession at the president as he and
his party left the Washington Hilton
Hotel following a speech to a union
convention. He fired at close range,
from a distance of no more than 10 to
15 feet from the president, witnesses
said.
The assassination attempt touched
off an air of national crisis, with Vice
President George Bush hurriedly
flying back to the capitol from a
speaking engagement in Texas in case
he was called on to assume presiden
tial duties. The Senate adjourned ear
ly and in New York, both the New
York and American stock exchanges
immediately halted all trading.
O'Leary, dean of George Washing
ton University Hospital for Clinical
Affairs, said that the president was in
the operating room for two hours, but
45 minutes of that time was spent
making certain that there was no
bleeding in the abdominal cavity.
The bullet that hit Reagan entered
under his arm pit, ricocheted off his
seventh rib and penetrated the lung.
The lung collapsed, but physicians re

inflated it in the emergency room
before the operation.
The surgery was performed by two
physicians on the hospital staff — Ben
jamin Aaron, a cardiovascular
surgeon, and Joseph Giordano, head of
the hospital trauma team.
Reagan was smiling and walking on
the sidewalk outside the hotel, ap
proaching his limousine, when several
persons in a small crowd nearby
shouted, "Mr. President." He turned
toward the crowd as shots rang out.
The president looked stunned as a
Secret Service agent quickly shoved
him into the waiting limousine. The
car sped off to George Washington
University Hospital.
He walked unassisted into the hospi
tal, holding his right hand to his left
chest, a spot of blood showing on his
shirt. And he remained conscious
before the operation, joking with aides
and friends who visited him.

Reagan said to his wife, "Honey. I
guess I just forgot to duck " And he
told a close friend. Sen Paul Laxalt
(R-Nev), "Don't worry about me I'll
make it."
He winked at James Baker, White
House chief of staff, as he was being
wheeled into the operating room and
told his physicians, "Please tell me
you're Republicans."
Despite the president's joking, the
shooting and the seriousness of the in
jury left Washington and much of the
country in a state of shock

Hinckley was a member of the party,
but never active. He said Hinckley
quit the party in 1979.
The gunman fired six shots in rapid
succession at the president as he and
his party left the Washington Hilton
Hotel following a speech to a union
convention. He fired at close range,
from a distance of no more than 10 to
15 feet from the president, witnesses
said.
The assassination attempt touched
off an air of national crisis, with Vice
President George Bush hurriedly
flying back to the capitol from a
speaking engagement in Texas in case
he was called on to assume presiden
tial duties. The Senate adjourned ear
ly and in New York, both the New
York and American stock exchanges
immediately halted all trading.
O'Leary, dean of George Washing
ton University Hospital for Clinical
Affairs, said that the president was in
the operating room for two hours, but
45 minutes of that time was spent
making certain that there was no
bleeding in the abdominal cavity.
The bullet that hit Reagan entered
under his arm pit, ricocheted off his
seventh rib and penetrated the lung.
The lung collapsed, but physicians re

inflated it in the emergency room
before the operation.
The surgery was performed by two
physicians on the hospital staff — Ben
jamin Aaron, a cardiovascular
surgeon, and Joseph Giordano, head of
the hospital trauma team.
Reagan was smiling and walking on
the sidewalk outside the hotel, ap
proaching his limousine, when several
persons in a small crowd nearby
shouted, "Mr. President." He turned
toward the crowd as shots rang out.
The president looked stunned as a
Secret Service agent quickly shoved
him into the waiting limousine. The
car sped off to George Washington
University Hospital.
He walked unassisted into the hospi
tal, holding his right hand to his left
chest, a spot of blood showing on his
shirt. And he remained conscious
before the operation, joking with aides
and friends who visited him.

Reagan said to his wife, "Honey. I
guess I just forgot to duck " And he
told a close friend. Sen Paul Laxalt
(R-Nev), "Don't worry about me I'll
make it."
He winked at James Baker, White
House chief of staff, as he was being
wheeled into the operating room and
told his physicians, "Please tell me
you're Republicans."
Despite the president's joking, the
shooting and the seriousness of the in
jury left Washington and much of the
country in a state of shock

Hiijkley replied, "You won't see me
any more."
"All of a sudden a gun fired," Seay
said, "and I fell to the ground. And
then the police knocked him down."
Hank Brown, a cameraman for
ABC-TV who filmed the shooting, said
that the suspect did not say anything,
but "just opened up'and continued
squeezing the trigger."
The gunman was among a cluster of
several persons, including reporters
and onlookers, who were standing be
hind a velvet rope used to cordon off
the crowd.
Pandemonium broke out as the
shots were fired. Brady, McCarthy
and Delahanty all slumped to the side
walk.
Brady, pudgy and balding, known
for his affability and sense of humor,
lay face down. He raised his head once
or twice and then was still. Someone
placed a handerchief under his head
but a pool of blood had already formed
on the sidewalk.
A hand gun was lying near his head.
The other victims lay nearby, almost
within reach of Brady, both lying still.
In the Senate, Baker interrupted de
bate on the president's proposed
budget cuts at 2.43 p.m. (EST) to an
nounce the shootings, but before
learning that Reagan had been hit.
Half an hour later, on learning Rea
gan also had been hit, Baker halted
further debate on the budget and re
cessed the Senate.

Following Baker!s first announce
ment, Sen. Edward Kennedy, (D-
Mass), who had been sitting at his
desk in the rear, arose, a tremble in
his voice.
"I am saddened, as I am sure all of
the members of this body are, at the
news of the attack on President Rea
gan," Kennedy said. "My family has
been touched by violence." He re
called the assassinations of his
brothers, John and Robert, and of oth
er political and civil rights leaders.
"Violence and hatred have no place
in our society or in our country," Ken
nedy said. "They know no parti
sanship, they know no party, they
know no rationality. Nonetheless, we
see it continue in our society and in our

country.
"All of us who care about this coun
try and who care about our fellow
citizens bear an important responsi l
bility in whatever way we possibly can
to rid this society and to rid this coun
try of the kind of violence and hatred
that we have seen."
Reagan had just finished addressing
4000 delegates to a national con
ference of the Building and Construc
tion Trades Department of the AFL
CIO. This was not a friendly group for
the president. The organization's
president, Robert Georgine, had ac
tively worked for President Jimmy
Carter during the 1980 election cam

of the various trade unions.
From the Daily wire services
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan wa? shot in the chest yester
day by a youthful gunman who tried to
assassinate him with a blaze of .22-
caliber pistol fire that critically in
jured White House Press Secretary
James Brady and felled two other
men.
Reagan "sailed through surgery."
according to doctors who said he
would be ready to make presidential
decisions by today.
But Brady was said to be fighting
for his life, a bullet through his brain.
A sandy-haired man from suburban
Denver — described as "wandering,
aimless and irresponsible" — was
wrestled into handcuffs moments af
ter the assailant leveled his pistol and

fired six times at Reagan from near
point-blank range. The Secret Service
identified him as John WarnocK
Hinckley, Jr., 25, of Evergreen. Colo.
Near midnight last night, Hinckley
was led into a federal courtroom and
formally charged with attempting to
assassinate the president, and with as
saulting a Secret Service officer. He
also faces a charge of assault with in
tent to kill a policeman.
Reagan's condition stable
Dr Dennis O'Leary said "a really
mangled bullet" was removed from
Reagan's left lung. He said the 70-
year-old president's condition was
stable, the prognosis excellent, and
that he guessed Reagan probably
would be hospitalized for about two
weeks.

Two other persons were seriously
wounded in the assassination at
tempt: a Secret Service agent,
Timothy McCarthy. 31, and a District
of Columbia policeman, Thomas De
lahanty. 45. They were reported in se
rious condition but apparently not in
danger.
There was no known motive, no ex
planation for the savage burst of gun
fire that exploded as the president
stood beside his limousine, ready to
step inside for the one-mile ride back
to the White House.
Former neo-Nazi
Harold Covington, a leader of the
neo-Nazi National Socialist Party of

Hinckley was a member of the party,
