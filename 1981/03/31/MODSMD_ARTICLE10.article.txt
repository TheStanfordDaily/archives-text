# Speaker to discuss space colonies
## 
### Karen Halbo 
T.A Hoppenheimer. author
of Colonies In Space, a book de
scribing future space colonies,
will be speaking at Skilling
Auditorium on Wednesday night
at 8:00 p.m.
In a review by Kay Bradbury
of Colonies in Space, Hop
penheimer was described as
"the opener of the gate, tender
of the gardens we will toss to
space and inhabit "
Hoppenheimer will discuss
the space colony plans present-

Ed in his book In the book, Hop
penheimer describes a nearly
self-sufficient colony of 10,000
people living in a spinning wheel
(a torus i a mile in diameter.
The housing for the colonists
runs terraced along the sides of
the tube, with separate zones set
aside for agriculture, breeding
animals, and industry. The pro
posed colony recycles air and
water, and the residential area
contains streams and parks,
with the vegitation helping re
plenish the oxygen.

According to Hoppenheimer.
the colony would utilize solar
energy, and raw materials
mined from the moon. The co
lony. being not totally self suffi
cient, would purchase certain
materials from Earth, in ex
change trading products that
can only be made in space.
Hoppenheimer s speech is
sponsored by the Stanford
chapter of the Amicitia Interna
tional Institute, an organization
of laymen which believe that
technological barriers of space

colonization can be overcome.
The Stanford chapter, which
is a relatively new organization
on campus, describes itself as
"seeking to wed technology and
human interest in a study of the
science and art of living in
space."
The group is hoping to invite
other speakers in the near
future, along with planning a
SWOPSI course, a symposium,
and a major design study all on
the subject of space co
lonization
