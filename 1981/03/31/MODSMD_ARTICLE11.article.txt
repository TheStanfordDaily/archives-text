# Solar Power: various uses explored, feasibilities tested
## Solar energy and housing 
### Associated Press 
What distinguishes a passive
solar energy house from an ac
tive solar energy house or any
other dwelling referred to in so
lar energy terms?
The passive solar house util
izes solar energy naturally, with
little or no mechanical equip
ment, thus requiring no energy
itself. In some cases, it may not
be as effective as an active solar
energy house, but neither is it as
expensive if included in the ori
ginal building design.
We get a better picture of the
difference between the active
and passive solar systems if we
think of it this way: In the active
system, the reliance is on tech
nology that is somewhat inde
pendent of the building and can
be added on if it isn't there in the
first place. In the passive meth
od, the building itself becomes
the system, which means that if
the ingredients aren't there at
the start, it is difficult to add
them later on
Such things as insulation,
double glazing and weather
stripping are all part of conven
tional energy conservation, but
a truly passive solar energy
house incorporates passive de
sign ideas in its planning, con
struction and use.
There is no employment of so
lar collectors in the ordinary
sense or of fans, pumps, heat
exchange units, controls and so
phisticated equipment.
Instead, the business of col
lecting and storing the heat
from the sun's rays is left to
parts of the building itself, in
cluding such things as windows,
thermal storage walls and site
orientation.
Site orientation simply means
the placement of the structure
to get the best results from what
you are trying to achieve. In the
case of solar energy, the general
objective is to face the main liv

ing areas to the south while, at
the same time, providing suffi
cient glass areas to allow the so
lar radiation a place to enter.
You cannot store heat if you
do not first capture it. Site ori
entation can be tricky at times
and should not be left to some
one who hasn't had professional
training in its mysteries, since
the location of the house must be
a compromise between the
south-facing windows for heat
ing in cold weather and captur
ing breezes for cooling in hot

weather. To protect facades
from cold winds, evergreens,
fences and earth berms should
be located on the north and west
sides of the house.
While the expert at site orien
tation knows all the general
rules for making appropriate
decisions, he must know when to
make exceptions. He must
know, for instance, that near a
body of water, breezes move
from the water to the land dur
ing the day, but flow in reverse
at night. And that, on a south
facing hill, breezes tend to move
up the hill during the day, down
the hill at night.

All the discussions about so
lar energy housing in recent
years have included the matter
of the placement and sizes of
windows. Where they are in re
lation to the sun at different
times ot the day and how large
or small they are can greatly af
fect the inside temperature ot a
house. Yet millions of houses
have been built without the
slightest consideration to this
matter, an indication, perhaps,
of the general lack of knowledge
about windows and energy. Or,
again perhaps, of the indif
ference, until recently, to the
subject of wasted energy.
