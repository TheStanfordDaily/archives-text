# Solar powered irrigation

Coolidge, Ariz. (AP) —
Farmers probably won't want
to have solar energy plants to
power their irrigation systems,
says the manager ot the nation's
only such experimental plant.
The system operated since
late 1979 by the University of Ar
izona works, despite some bugs.
But it is costly and requires
time and skills that would prob
ably cause most farmers to ig
nore thoughts about turning to
solar energy to run their irriga
tion pumps, at least for now.

says Dr. Dennis Larson.
But Larson, an agricultural
engineer and the project's man
ager, said "The solar plant as an
experimental plant has oper
ated about as reliably as one
could expect it to. It's very hard
to have specific expectations for
an experiment."
The $5.7 million federal-state
project on a cotton farm near
Coolidge in south-central Arizo
na, financed principally by the
Department ot Energy, has op
erated 90 to 95 percent of sunlit

hours, Larson said. He termed
its running time "outstanding."
It uses 384 parabolic trough
shaped collectors lying north
south over 23,000 square feet to
absorb solar energy for gener
ating about 150 net kilowatts of
electricity. Shiny aluminum
surfaces reflect sunlight onto
tubes in the troughs, to heat oil
inside to about 550 degrees
Fahrenheit.
That in turn heats a second
fluid, toluene, which is vapor
ized and drives a turbine con
nected to a generator, produc
ing electrical power.
It works. But there are prob
lems.
"The number of hours is lim
ited by sunlight." said Larson.
"We don't have enough collec
tors to operate from sunup to
sundown."
In fact, he said, only about one
hour's worth of generation is
collected on winter days be
cause the sun rests low in the
sky and "not much high-tem
perature heat" is taken in.
Enough energy is collected
during a typical June day to op
erate the turbine for about six
hours, Larson said.
Larson said the plant pro
duced electricity to pump about
1500 gallons of water per
minute from wells about 300 feet
deep, sufficient to cover about
150 acres of cotton. Farmers re
quire about 10 gallons' capacity
per minute per acre to irrigate
cotton fields, he said.
As for its commercial future,
Larson estimated that "the
amount of time and the skills re
quired are probably such that an
individual farmer probably
wouldn't want one."
He said no comparison data
had been gathered yet to de
termine cost-effectiveness, but
that a solar power system used
on a cooperative or interconnec
ting basis by groups ot farmers
tying into utility power grids
might be realistic one day.
