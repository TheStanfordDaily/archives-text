# Stanford and Escondido Village residents : an open exchange
## No plans to reconsider hike 
### 
Dean Lyons and I would be
pleased to meet with you to discuss
your concerns. Please have a rep
resentative from your committee
contact my office to arrange a
mutually convenient time.
There are several points in your
letter which I should like to address
now, since doing so may make our
meeting more profitable. First is
the matter of the rent increase.
Your letter suggests that you be
lieve it to be merely a proposal. It
isn't. The increase was approved
finally by the Trustees in Decem
ber, the time when we customarily
set tuition and room and board fees
for the next academic year. We fol
low that schedule to let students
know as early as possible what the
fees will be for the coming year and
to reduce the temptation to use fees
and tuition as a budgetary "plug
factor" to balance the budget when
detailed budgets are completed
several months later.
We have no plans to reconsider
the December decision, but were
we to do so, the proposed increase
would almost surely be greater
than 15 percent and not smaller, as
you would wish. One major compo
nent of the residential budget, the
cost of energy, will increase much
more than we were able to forecast
in November and December. That
unexpectedly high increase has
pushed our residential budget out
of balance. Even now, housing di
rector Ed Scoles is looking for
means to address that problem
through further reduction of costs
(services) and, if need be, to draw

on reserves.
The matter of reserves leads me
to another point in your letter. You
refer to a "$243,000 profit.'' There
are no profits in our residential
budgets. Revenues are used only to
pay for direct operating costs, a
fair share of the "municipal" costs
of the University, for major re
pairs and improvements, and for
repayment of loans for housing we
already have built over the last ten
years by the entire housing and
iood service system, not merely by
Escondido Village residents.
Since you have had several meet
ings about the proposed rents, you
know that the capital costs (both
old and new) are spread out over
the entire residential system. This
is a matter of deliberate policy
which is not likely to change. The
cost of building new housing has lit
erally outstripped our ability to pay
for it from those rents alone. It is
affordable only because of some
direct or indirect governmental
subsidy which keeps interest costs
below market rates, and by spread
ing the capital costs over all stu
dent rentpayers rather than just
those who are occupying the new
units.
The government subsidies that
made Escondido Village possible
were in the form of federal low in
terest loans percent) from
the Department of Housing and Ur
ban Development (HUD). The gov
ernment subsidies that will make
the new residence complex pos
sible are in the form of legislation
which allows private institutions to

sell tax-free bonds through the Cal
ifornia Educational Facilities Au
thority Even so. the interest rate
on those bonds is presently 9-10 per
cent.
The University is very much
aware of the need for more housing
tor graduate students. The absence
of a concrete plan to build such
housing is not related to any de
liberate decision to overlook that
need. Rather, it is because we do
not have the financial means to do
so. given the present levels of our
rents, which are lower than the pre
vailing rates around us. Put sim
ply, if over time our rents could
move closer to the prevailing rates
in surrounding areas, we can de
velop the capacity to borrow more
and thus finance new construction.
Until we have developed the finan
cial means to pay for new housing,
we will not promise new housing to
anyone.
Rents at other California univer
sities are usually less than those at
Stanford. There is a good reason for
that. Most, if not all, of those
schools are likely to be public in
stitutions where many costs are
subsidized directly and indirectly
by tax payers. On the other hand, I
find the experience of the Univer
sity of Southern California to be in
teresting and relevant. U.S.C. has
pursued an aggressive program for
several years of buying and build
ing apartment houses on the edge
of their campus. Their rents are
competitive with (that is, very

close to) rents for commercial
apartments For U.S.C. apart
ments comparable to Escondido
Village, U.S.C students in a two
bedroom apartment pay $676
monthly.
No discussion of Escondido rents
should exclude the subject of in
come for all graduate students.
Graduate stipends and other forms
of graduate student aid have not
kept pace with rising costs, gener
ally. Indeed, that is a more difficult
problem to address, partly because
graduate student aid is so closely
tied to federal programs and
priorities. NSF fellowships, for ex
ample, have remained virtually un
changed for the past few years. The
present economic climates in
Washington and Sacramento sug
gest to us that matter will not im
prove and may get worse. The level
of University aid to graduate stu
dents has been increased signifi
cantly in the 1981-82 budget, which
was just adopted by the Board of
Trustees. This aid will help all
graduate students.
We trust that these comments
may serve as a useful preface to
our meeting with you. I would pro
pose including in that meeting Rob
in Hamill, director of housing pro
grams, who will share with you the
University's plans for development
of new graduate student housing.

Rents at other California univer
sities are usually less than those at
Stanford. There is a good reason for
that. Most, if not all, of those
schools are likely to be public in
stitutions where many costs are
subsidized directly and indirectly
by tax payers. On the other hand, I
find the experience of the Univer
sity of Southern California to be in
teresting and relevant. U.S.C. has
pursued an aggressive program for
several years of buying and build
ing apartment houses on the edge
of their campus. Their rents are
competitive with (that is, very

close to) rents for commercial
apartments For U.S.C. apart
ments comparable to Escondido
Village, U.S.C students in a two
bedroom apartment pay $676
monthly.
No discussion of Escondido rents
should exclude the subject of in
come for all graduate students.
Graduate stipends and other forms
of graduate student aid have not
kept pace with rising costs, gener
ally. Indeed, that is a more difficult
problem to address, partly because
graduate student aid is so closely
tied to federal programs and
priorities. NSF fellowships, for ex
ample, have remained virtually un
changed for the past few years. The
present economic climates in
Washington and Sacramento sug
gest to us that matter will not im
prove and may get worse. The level
of University aid to graduate stu
dents has been increased signifi
cantly in the 1981-82 budget, which
was just adopted by the Board of
Trustees. This aid will help all
graduate students.
We trust that these comments
may serve as a useful preface to
our meeting with you. I would pro
pose including in that meeting Rob
in Hamill, director of housing pro
grams, who will share with you the
University's plans for development
of new graduate student housing.
(William Massy is Vice President
for Business and Finance.)
Dean Lyons and I would be
pleased to meet with you to discuss
your concerns. Please have a rep
resentative from your committee
contact my office to arrange a
mutually convenient time.
There are several points in your
letter which I should like to address
now, since doing so may make our
meeting more profitable. First is
the matter of the rent increase.
Your letter suggests that you be
lieve it to be merely a proposal. It
isn't. The increase was approved
finally by the Trustees in Decem
ber, the time when we customarily
set tuition and room and board fees
for the next academic year. We fol
low that schedule to let students
know as early as possible what the
fees will be for the coming year and
to reduce the temptation to use fees
and tuition as a budgetary "plug
factor" to balance the budget when
detailed budgets are completed
several months later.
We have no plans to reconsider
the December decision, but were
we to do so, the proposed increase
would almost surely be greater
than 15 percent and not smaller, as
you would wish. One major compo
nent of the residential budget, the
cost of energy, will increase much
more than we were able to forecast
in November and December. That
unexpectedly high increase has
pushed our residential budget out
of balance. Even now, housing di
rector Ed Scoles is looking for
means to address that problem
through further reduction of costs
(services) and, if need be, to draw

on reserves.
The matter of reserves leads me
to another point in your letter. You
refer to a "$243,000 profit.'' There
are no profits in our residential
budgets. Revenues are used only to
pay for direct operating costs, a
fair share of the "municipal" costs
of the University, for major re
pairs and improvements, and for
repayment of loans for housing we
already have built over the last ten
years by the entire housing and
iood service system, not merely by
Escondido Village residents.
Since you have had several meet
ings about the proposed rents, you
know that the capital costs (both
old and new) are spread out over
the entire residential system. This
is a matter of deliberate policy
which is not likely to change. The
cost of building new housing has lit
erally outstripped our ability to pay
for it from those rents alone. It is
affordable only because of some
direct or indirect governmental
subsidy which keeps interest costs
below market rates, and by spread
ing the capital costs over all stu
dent rentpayers rather than just
those who are occupying the new
units.
The government subsidies that
made Escondido Village possible
were in the form of federal low in
terest loans percent) from
the Department of Housing and Ur
ban Development (HUD). The gov
ernment subsidies that will make
the new residence complex pos
sible are in the form of legislation
which allows private institutions to

sell tax-free bonds through the Cal
ifornia Educational Facilities Au
thority Even so. the interest rate
on those bonds is presently 9-10 per
cent.
The University is very much
aware of the need for more housing
tor graduate students. The absence
of a concrete plan to build such
housing is not related to any de
liberate decision to overlook that
need. Rather, it is because we do
not have the financial means to do
so. given the present levels of our
rents, which are lower than the pre
vailing rates around us. Put sim
ply, if over time our rents could
move closer to the prevailing rates
in surrounding areas, we can de
velop the capacity to borrow more
and thus finance new construction.
Until we have developed the finan
cial means to pay for new housing,
we will not promise new housing to
anyone.
