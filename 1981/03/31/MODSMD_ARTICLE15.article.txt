# Rent increase unfair
## 
### 
The Escondido Village Commit
tee for Fair Rents has met numer
ous times during the past two
months to discuss and protest the
impending rent increase of 15 per
cent for residents of Escondido Vil
lage. As representatives of the
graduate student population living
in Escondido Village we must
strongly object to this increase on
the following grounds:
1. The rent increase affects that
part of the Stanford University stu
dent population which can least af
ford it, namely the graduate stu
dents, many with families, living
on fixed incomes.
2. The amount of stipend in
crease to graduate students is not
moving at a rate commensurate
with a rent increase of 15 percent
and indeed, stipend increases vary
widely from discipline to discipline
throughout the University.
3. As a group, the residents of
Escondido Village are opposed to
using 2 percent of the proposed rent
increase to fund new under
graduate student housing when no
new graduate student housing is
planned in the near future.
4. The planned $243,000 profit (as
indicated by Escondido Village's
current operating budget) for the
1980-81 fiscal year is a strong in
dication that this level of rent in
crease is unwarranted.
5. The concept of bringing
Escondido Village rents to mar
ket level would eliminate all but
the wealthiest students from
this housing, forcing more stu
dents into substandard housing.

6 Raising the Escondido Village
rents would cause a ripple effect in
the rent levels of the surrounding
community, thus making it even
more difficult for those not as for
tunate as we to live in Escondido
Village to economically survive
and continue their studies.
7. A 15 percent increase in
Escondido Village rents would
surely cause many graduate stu
dents to decrease their academic
loads in order to take part time
jobs, thus extending the time
toward getting their degrees. This
would be especially difficult for
those foreign students here on a fix
ed term basis.
8. In a survey conducted in Janu
ary, 1981, the committee estab
lished that Escondido Village rents
were substantially higher, some
times as much as $100 per month,
than any other similar University
housing in California.
The residents of Escondido Vil
lage strongly urge that the pro
posed 15 percent rent increase be
reduced and ask that Dean William
Massy, as the representative of the
Stanford University adminis
tration charged with setting new
rents by the Board of Trustees in its
December meeting, meet with Vil
lage residents and members of the
Committee for Fair Rents to dis
cuss a reduction in this proposed in
crease before the decision to raise
the rents is formally enacted at the
March meeting of the Board .
