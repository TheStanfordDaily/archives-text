## R.B. Lynch Newest priorities thwart underprivileged 
### 
Among the priorities of the
present administration, the bat
tle against inflation seems to
have taken on primary signifi
cance. not only for the present
and future stature of the Reagan
presidency but also for the large
segment ol the American popu
lation which stands to lose the
most should the President's new
economic proposals fail —
namely, the poor and the under
priviledged. President Ronald
Reagan was largely elected on a
mandate to redress the econom
ic problems this country has
been plagued with for many
years, and if we are to judge
from his recent budget pro
posals. he is pursuing his "man
date" with unaccustomed vigor.
On Feb. 18th, in the true spirit
of his impassioned battle to curb
inflation by reducing govern
ment spending, Reagan
proposed a budget cut for
fiscal year 1981 and 1982 of 41
billion dollars in government
services, including large cuts in
many social net programs such
as food stamps, social security
and student aid. However one
government department was
spared from the ruthless budget
cutters and that was the De
fense Department. Because of
the perceived necessities of the
international environment, the
Defense Department, in stark

contrast to the other "wasteful"
government agencies, will re
ceive a record peacetime in
crease of some 33 billion dollars
for fiscal years 1981-82.
Government spending, we are
told by the Reagan adminis
tration, is the primary reason
for the phenomenon of inflation.
The explanation seems so
simple that you don't ever have
to have been a graduate of an
Econ 1 course to understand it.
Add to reduced government
spending simple incentive stim
ulating measures such as wide
spread deregulation of the vital
energy industries and an across
the board tax cut to "stimulate
productivity" and you have one
beautiful little productive and
efficient economic package.
(Have it gift wrapped: it makes
a great Mother's Day present!)
Both opponents and sup
porters of the Reagan presiden
cy insist that we give the Rea
gan proposals a chance and see
if they will work or not. Accord
ing to this way of thinking, if
Reagan's economic plan works,
so much the better, and if it
doesn't, then at least we'll have
the proof that it doesn't work
and thereby a basis for political
opposition.
This logic fails to take into ac
count the tremendous stakes in
volved in this gamble. Isn't it

curious that, by and large it is
only those least able to defend
themselves from the vicious
spiral of inflation — the poor —
that are being asked to make the
greatest sacrifice through the
proposed massive cutback in
government services? Isn't it
also curious that those who are
best able to defend themselves
against inflation — the rich —
stand to benefit the most from
the tax cut and the deregulation
of energy and other related in
dustries?
These disturbing facts about
the new Reagan economic pro
posals. in and of themselves are
not enough to prove that the pro
posals will not work. We can
say, however, that at least ac
cording to Reagan's own point
of view, his plan can't work be
cause of one very simple fact:
he does not intend to reduce gov
ernment spending or the rate of
government spending. For ev
ery dollar cut in spending on so
cial services, there will be
almost an effective one dollar
increase in the military budget.
At best, his proposals call for
only a total reduction of 8 billion
dollars in two years.
Since the cost of the new
weapons projects are based on
an inflation rate below former
President Carter's estimates,
we can be sure the military
budget increase will probably
equal or may even surpass the
decrease in government spend
ing in social services. In this
vein, the estimated cost of the
MX missle system was recently
doubled by the General Accoun
ting Office from some 35 billion
to 70 billion dollars.
How can Reagan's plan work
if he is unwilling to be consistent
with his own analysis of the
causes of inflation? Why should
we accept for any reason an eco
nomic plan based on such bla
tant contradictions? Reagan
doesn't intend to cut total gov
ernment spending, he just in
tends to cut spending on social
services — those services which
benefit the poor.
To add insult to injury, Rea
gan's budget proposals seem to
also be based on the assumption
that waste and excess occur
only in those government agen
cies related to social services,
but not in the military. This is a
blatantly false assumption. Im
partial observers have noted
with regularity the widespread
waste and excess in the Defense
Department.
According to a recent
analysis of traditional U.S. de
fense spending (written by a
former Air Force officer who is
now a civilian analyst in the
Pentagon) entitled the Spinney
report, large increases in the
military budget have not only
led to widespread abuses and
excesses in spending, but have
actually diminished U.S. mili
tary capability vis a vis the Sovi
et Union. Because of the tenden

cy of the military planners to in
vest large amounts of money in
exotic military systems and
weapons of high technical so
phistication which are difficult
to maintain, many of these sys
tems are only operational' 50
percent of the time. At any rate,
we can be sure that at least as
much waste and excess occurs
in the defense department as in
other government agencies.
The issue then is not one of
economics, it is one of
priorities. The Reagan adminis
tration has already shown an un
faltering willingness to ignore
the plight of the poor by propo
sing a budget which offers us the
illusion of reduced government
spending in the name of the bat
tle against inflation but which
actually shifts the focus of our
tax dollars to the military in the
name of belligerent anti-com
munism. As the case of El
Salvador demonstrates, our tax
dollars will not even always be
used to enhance our own secur
ity, but will often be used to
meddle in the internal affairs of
Third World countries and prop
up authoritarian regimes who
callously suppress vastly popu
lar movements challenging
their authority.
Those of us who believe
Reagan's economic plan
will not work should not sit com
placently by the side for the two
year in order to gain "proof" for
their opposition, for the proof
will not be forthcoming. No
president easily admits total
fault with his own policies. Even
if inflation were to be 25 percent
and unemployment 15 percent
two years from now, would Rea
gan admit fault? No, he would
blame it on somebody else, or a
"situation beyond his control."
The time to oppose the Reagan
budget is now, not later.
Moreover, a substantial shift
in government spending from
social services to the military
over a number of year would es
tablish an unfortunate prece
dent which would be difficult to
erode in future presidencies.
The challenge proposed by the
Reagan budget is one we must
take seriously because the
stakes for our society are
enormous.
The question is not a matter
of reducing government spend
ing to fight inflation, as Presi
dent Reagan has shown through
his financially inconsistent
budget proposals. The question
is, however, one of priorities,
namely whether this country
will lead the fight for de
mocracy and freedom at home
and abroad through the path of
blind militarism or rather a dif
ficult but consistent policy
based on the democratic values
which this country supposedly
espouses
