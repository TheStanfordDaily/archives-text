## Overpopulation not the villain 
### 
Forecasting has become an international
growth industry, and an impressive array of pub
lic and private organizations are in the business of
telling us what the future will hold.
From times immemorial men have sought re
assurance in the present by trying to peer into the
future. Stone age hunters listened to spirit medi
ums and diviners. Seventeenth century warlords
consulted astrologers. Today, politicians ask aca
demicians trained in economics, sociology, and
demography for advice.
Forecasters, for the most part, are a gloomy
lot. Typical of current works of prediction is a re
port, known as "Global 2000," based on the re
search of fourteen government agencies, and sub
mitted to President Carter before he left office.
"Global 2000," like so many other documents of
its kind, gives a most pessimistic assessment. The
numbers of people in the world are growing fast;
they will be increasingly unable to feed them
selves; natural resources will become depleted at
a catastrophic rate; raw material prices will sky
rocket; insects immune to chemicals will multi
ply. Famine and disease will spread. The plagues
of Egypt were as nothing compared with the
wrath to come!
Who are the villains responsible for these im
pending disasters?The malcreants are, above all,
those mothers and fathers who choose to have
more than two babies per family. Their selfish
proclivity for bringing too many children into this
world will occasion a catastrophic rise in the
world's population, from an estimated 2 billion at
present to something like 6.35 billion in the year
2000 and many more to come.
There will not be enough food to fill all these
hungry mouths; misery will take place of prosper
ity. U.S. government agencies such as the Agency
for International Development, therefore, use
foreign aid as an instrument for imposing the pop
ulation planners' views in this country on the rest
of the world.
But how sound are the planners' underlying as
sumptions? There is in fact no empirical evidence
whatever that a high density of population im
pedes economic development or interferes with
economic prosperity. On the contrary, some of
the most striking economic advances ever made
in the world have been secured over the last thirty
years by densely populated countries such as
Japan, West Germany, and Holland — not to
speak of crowded city states like Hong Kong and
Singapore. These latter communities have
achieved a relatively high degree of prosperity de
spite a total lack of natural resources. Converse
ly, some of the world's least populated countries,
states such as Niger and Mali in Africa — have re
mained among the world's most backward.
A high birth rate no more impedes economic
progress than a high population density. On the
contrary, Colin Clark, one of the world's leading
development economists and a former director of
the Agricultural Institute at Oxford University,
has demonstrated that the overall costs for trans
port and other public utilities decline as popu
lation grows, thereby facilitating an expansion in
the net national income. In fact, countries with a
high rate of population increase often have a high
rate of growth in product per person.
But will human race not starve, if it chooses to
multiply? Do the experts not agree that global
food shortages are inevitable? The facts, as
documented in specialist publications, usually
startle a public accustomed over the years by
doomsday rhetoric concerning world starvation.
Over the last thirty years, the world food output
has outstripped population growth by a significant
margin. The world's per capita food supply is
probably the highest in history — so argues a U.S.
Department of Agriculture report entitled World
Hunger and Malnutrition, Improving the U.S.
Response (1980).
The world — the argument still goes — is but a
tiny space ship. Its resources are strictly limited.
In order to survive in his diminutive craft, man
needs social controls and social planning of a rigid
kind. But the analogy does not hold. Man himself
has constructed his spaceship; its resources are
precisely known But Man has not built the globe
whose resources are but poorly explored, and
whose resources may yet be further enhanced by
science and technology whose future impact no
expert can foresee.

According to Roger Revelle, former director of
the Harvard Center for Population Studies, the
globe may well be able to feed something like ten
times the world's present population; yet this op
eration would require only about one quarter of
the land's surface. We do not, of course, know
whether Revelle is right. We do know, however,
that the prophets of gloom have had a poor record
of forecasting.
Why then are things going so badly in many
parts of the world? Why does hunger afflict count
less millions? The answer does not lie in "over
population" as such. Hunger, more often, is man
made. Hunger derives primarily from the effects
of war and of mistakes public policies.
Deprivation is rife in Uganda, not because
Uganda's land resources are inadequate, but be
cause Uganda's prosperity was shattered by the
terror occasioned by the tyranny of Idi Amin, by
civil war, invasion, and a widespread breakdown
of authority. Somalia's refugee problems are
daunting because an endless throng of hungry and
sickly people — mainly women and children, with
a sprinkling of elderly, infirm men — continue to
make their way across the border from Ethiopia's
Ogaden Province to escape form endless guerilla
war.
Cambodians starve, not because their land can
not yield sufficient rice, but because of the misery
occasioned by endless oppression and war. Com
munist China, once the darling of Western
progressives, the land where hunger had sup
posedly been eliminated and where even mos
quitoes had supposedly disappeared, now faces
wide-spread famine. These famines are man
made; they derive from policies that have per
sistently discouraged and disorganized peasant
enterprises.
Communist China's poor agricultural record
strikingly contrasts with the astonishing ad
vances in agricultural productivity made in
Taiwan, where farming was left to private en
terprise. Similarly, West Germany's agricultural
output is much superior to East Germany's. Den
mark's production is far more efficient than
Estonia's — not because of differences in natural
conditions or national character but because Sovi
et-style agricultural policies are misconceived,
and have led to deep-seated crisis.
Hunger, to sum up, is not inevitable. Hunger is
not the necessary consequence of population
growth. Why then should stereotypes to the con
trary be so popular in academe? The answer de
rives from ideology. Academicians, for the most
part, incline to the liberal end of the political spec
trum. They prefer social planning to the operation
of the free market for ethical, or supposedly ethi
cal, reasons. Academicians have a material stake
in planning policies that concentrate power in the
hands of planners and bureaucrats, because these
men and women almost universally owe their
training to academe.
The "anti-nationalism" widely prevalent
among professors is often linked to the pro
fessors' own life styles. Large families interfere
with a mode of life that stresses self-expression,
sensitivity, and personal growth — the buzz words
of liberal academe. Large families also prevent
women from achieving that equality in pro
fessional life regarded by liberal academicians as
essential for the pursuit of social justice.
There is nothing wrong with choosing such val
ues. Unfortunately, however, too many liberal ac
ademicians then project these value judgments on
Pakistani peasants, Mexican factory workers, or
Zulu herdsmen who are mistakenly censured for
being ill-advised and selfish when they raise large
families.
A libertarian will take a more optimistic point
of view. Parents — whether Pakistanis, Mexi
cans, Zulu, or Americans — are the best judge of
their own interests. They are more capable of
making rational and informed choices than those
Western college professors and bureaucrats who
claim to have superior knowledge concerning the
world's future. The decision whether to have chil
dren or not to have children should be left to the
unfettered private choice of each individual fami
ly, in whatever corner of the globe. The time has
come to take academicians and welfare experts
out of the business of worldwide population plan
