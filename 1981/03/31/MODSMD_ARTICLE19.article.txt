# Billy the Kid's death debated
## 
### 
Fort Sumner, N.M. (Al'l —
Billy the Kid's Tombstone is
back in this southeastern New
Mexico town, recovered after it
had been stolen early in Febru
ary But some people say it's not
Billy who's buried in the grave
here.
They believe he died at a ripe
old age in the 1940s and was not
killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett's
gun in 1881.
The Kid's granite tombstone
was recovered in Huntington
Beach. Calif. The story brought
up memories for some residents
of the Southwest, including C.S.
Holmes of Clovis, N.M , who
had obtained a copy of an old
grand jury indictment in
Seymour. Texas, in the 19605.
The indictment, filed in Har
diman County. Texas, on Dec.
28. 1881, charges a man with the
killing of another. Witnesses
who testified before the grand
jury were listed as W.A.
Tackett, Jack Grishman, Billy
the Kid and Sam Watson.
The Kid's tombstone says he
was killed by Garrett on July 14,
1881, five months earlier.
Either someone used his
name on the court document or
he was not killed. And if the Kid
was not killed, someone else
was buried in his grave at Fort
Sumner in 1881.
Jimmy Ramage, an elemen
tary-school principal in Hico,
Texas, said during a telephone
interview that he remembered
an old man who lived in Hico in
the 1940s and claimed to be Billy
the Kid.
Ramage said the man called
himself "Brushy Billy and was
always talking about his ex

periences. He wore a big hat,
usually a plaid shirt He had a
handlebar mustache and a gray
beard."
Brushy Billy was about 5-
foot-6 or 5-foot-7, of medium
build, and chewed tobacco on
occasion
Folks took his word about
being Billy the Kid with a grain
of salt. Ramage said
A resident of Seymour, Tex
as, Charles L Machen grew up
in Hico and remembered
Brushy Billy. Machen's wife re
lated her husband's story:
" He (Brushy Billy > supposed
ly went to Santa Fe in the 1940s
to get a pardon from the gov
ernor They wouldn't issue a
pardon to him until they found
out if he was reallv Billy the
Kid "
She said they knew of a Mexi
can man who was a good friend
of Billy the Kid's, and got him
together with Brushy Billy in
Santa Fe. She said the man told
authorities Brushy Billy had to
be Billy the Kid, because he
knew secrets only the Kid would
have known.
But she said she didn't believe
Brushy was given the pardon. At
the time. New Mexico got quite
a bit of tourist business from
Billy the Kid.
So Brushy Billy returned to
Hico and died in the mid or late
19405.
It has been suggested Garrett
and the Kid were friends, and
that his death was a ruse to al
low the Kid to escape from the
public eye. And they say a dere
lict was buried in the Kid's
place 100 years ago.
