## 'Sweeney Todd': tryin' to keep the customer mortified 
### Stephen Nash 
Who could ve imagined it? A
Broadway musical about a
murdering barber's love affair
with his razors. And not just any
musical, but one of the best to
have come out of New York in
years.
Set in London 150 years ago,
Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney
Todd is the story of Benjamin
Barker, a barber seeking re
venge for the rape of his wife
and the stealing away of his
daughter, Johanna. The per
petrator of this vile crime was
the lecherous Judge Turpin,
who had sentenced Barber to ex

ile in Australia on a trumped-up
charge. After 15 years in cap
tivity, Barker has managed to
escape with the help of a sailor,

While waiting for Judge Turpin to visit his
shop, Todd exercises his razors by slitting
the throats of his customers.

Anthony Hope, and has found his
way back to London with a new
name — Sweeney Todd.
Todd opens for business again
in his old quarters upstairs from

Mrs. Lovett's pie shop in Fleet
Street. While waiting tor Judge
Turpin to visit his shop, Todd ex
ercises his razors by slitting the

throats of his customers. What
Todd loses in the vyay of repeat
business is more than made up
by the increased sales down
stairs, since Mrs. Lovett uses

the bodies to make fillings for
her meat pies. In a nod to tradi
tion, and to round out the story,
there is a romantic sub-plot in
volving Johanna and the sailor
Anthony.
Although the situation has
changed in recent years, Broad
way musicals still have a repu
tation for being idealistic love
stories punctuated by catchy
tunes and soaring melodies. De
spite the work of Bob Fosse and
others, the memories of Okla
homa and The Sound of Music
linger on. It's hard to imagine
Sweeney Todd as part of this
genre.

It's not just that this tale of
murder and cannibalism is less
than heartwarming. Everything
about the production em
phasizes the surreal and the
macabre. Instead of identifying
with the lovers, humming the
tunes, and wiping tears from
your eyes, you feel like you've
Wandered into a theatre haunted
by some rather vile spirits.
That feeling starts before the
play even begins. The stage is

nearly empty — a black metal
rear wall, catwalks, a tew
props. You can even watch the
movements backstage. It's like
seeing the relics of a previous
play. The sets never become
much more complex.
Stagehands in costume are on
stage much ot the time: moving
metal staircases, watching
scenes, adjusting the sets. Little
attempt is made to disguise the
technical aspects of the produc
tion, or to create realistic set
tings.
The music and lyrics are the
most important aspects of this

play, since there is almost no
spoken dialogue Sondheim has
never been renowned for his
soaring melodies; he is much
more likely to piece songs to
gether out of melodic frag
ments. It's not surprising then
that Sweeney Todd is his most
successful score to date, since it
is put together almost com
pletely in this way. Not just indi
vidual songs, but larger musical
numbers as well are made up ot

distinctive song fragments as
sociated with specific charac
ters. The listener is never trans
ported along by a song; rather,
the music focuses attention on
one character or mood after an
other. Even when the music is
more lyrical, the action on
stage ensures that the de
lightfully unsettling mood isn't
disturbed For instance, the
prettiest song ("Johanna" in
Act II) accompanies a long se
quence of throat-slittings.
Further disturbances come
from the numerous quotes and
near-quotes in the score. These

jog almost unrelated memories,
something like "musical
ghosts ' of other shows. The or
chestra does its part, too, with
its large percussion section.
And who could forget the chill
ing. scream-like factory whistle
which blows every few scenes.
If all this weren't enough, the
Prologue and Epilogue involve
characters rising from the dead
and singing about themselves in
the third person — another re-

minder that all of this isn't
meant to be real And then
there's the macabre make-up.
And the costumes. . . .
The stars of the show are
Angela Lansbury (as Mrs.
Lovett) and George Hearn (as
Todd i. They're super, of course,
as are the other members of the
cast But the real attention-get
ter of this show is Sondheim's
music. It pulls everything into
the maelstrom of horror and
madness, and it transforms the
Golden Gate Theatre into a de
liciously bizarre chamber of
murderous spirits.

Todd opens for business again
in his old quarters upstairs from

Mrs. Lovett's pie shop in Fleet
Street. While waiting tor Judge
Turpin to visit his shop, Todd ex
ercises his razors by slitting the

throats of his customers. What
Todd loses in the vyay of repeat
business is more than made up
by the increased sales down
stairs, since Mrs. Lovett uses

the bodies to make fillings for
her meat pies. In a nod to tradi
tion, and to round out the story,
there is a romantic sub-plot in
volving Johanna and the sailor
Anthony.
Although the situation has
changed in recent years, Broad
way musicals still have a repu
tation for being idealistic love
stories punctuated by catchy
tunes and soaring melodies. De
spite the work of Bob Fosse and
others, the memories of Okla
homa and The Sound of Music
linger on. It's hard to imagine
Sweeney Todd as part of this
genre.

It's not just that this tale of
murder and cannibalism is less
than heartwarming. Everything
about the production em

nearly empty — a black metal
rear wall, catwalks, a tew
props. You can even watch the
movements backstage. It's like
seeing the relics of a previous
play. The sets never become
much more complex.
Stagehands in costume are on
stage much ot the time: moving
metal staircases, watching
scenes, adjusting the sets. Little
attempt is made to disguise the
technical aspects of the produc
tion, or to create realistic set
tings.
The music and lyrics are the
most important aspects of this

play, since there is almost no
spoken dialogue Sondheim has
never been renowned for his
soaring melodies; he is much
more likely to piece songs to
gether out of melodic frag
ments. It's not surprising then
that Sweeney Todd is his most
successful score to date, since it
is put together almost com
pletely in this way. Not just indi
vidual songs, but larger musical
numbers as well are made up ot

distinctive song fragments as
sociated with specific charac
ters. The listener is never trans
ported along by a song; rather,
the music focuses attention on
one character or mood after an
other. Even when the music is
more lyrical, the action on
stage ensures that the de
lightfully unsettling mood isn't
disturbed For instance, the
prettiest song ("Johanna" in
Act II) accompanies a long se
quence of throat-slittings.
Further disturbances come
from the numerous quotes and
near-quotes in the score. These

jog almost unrelated memories,
something like "musical
ghosts ' of other shows. The or
chestra does its part, too, with
its large percussion section.
And who could forget the chill
ing. scream-like factory whistle
which blows every few scenes.
If all this weren't enough, the
Prologue and Epilogue involve
characters rising from the dead
and singing about themselves in
the third person — another re-

minder that all of this isn't
meant to be real And then
there's the macabre make-up.
And the costumes. . . .
The stars of the show are
Angela Lansbury (as Mrs.
Lovett) and George Hearn (as
Todd i. They're super, of course,
as are the other members of the
cast But the real attention-get
ter of this show is Sondheim's
music. It pulls everything into
the maelstrom of horror and
madness, and it transforms the
Golden Gate Theatre into a de
liciously bizarre chamber of
murderous spirits.

Who could ve imagined it? A
Broadway musical about a
murdering barber's love affair
with his razors. And not just any
musical, but one of the best to
have come out of New York in
years.
Set in London 150 years ago,
Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney
Todd is the story of Benjamin
Barker, a barber seeking re
venge for the rape of his wife
and the stealing away of his
daughter, Johanna. The per
petrator of this vile crime was
the lecherous Judge Turpin,
who had sentenced Barber to ex

ile in Australia on a trumped-up
charge. After 15 years in cap
tivity, Barker has managed to
escape with the help of a sailor,
