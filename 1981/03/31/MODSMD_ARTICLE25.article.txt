# 'Eyewitness' not your basic murder flick
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
The opening shots of Eye
witness are handsomely
creepy: set in the boiler room of
an office building at night, with
the sound of lightning and rain
outside, they evoke the at
mosphere of a classic murder
mystery. But we aren't watch
ing a new movie by John
Carpenter; this is a collabora
tion between director Peter
Yates and writer Steve Tesich,
whose initial screen partnership
produced one of the most poign
ant American movies of the past
few years, Breaking A tray. No
one who saw their first film will
be surprised to discover the
depth of characterization, the
muted humor, and the sharp, un
expected twists in the dialogue
that these men have brought to
Eyewitness; the surprise is that
there's a murder mystery in it
at all. It is more of a movie than
the requirements of its genre
call for — and less.
Tesich has really sensitized
Yates, whose movies for a dec
ade had a cash register efficien
cy and coolness to them. A pic
ture like Bullitt is about car
chases and shoot-ups; who can
rertember anything about the
character after seeing it?
Before Breaking Away, no pic
tures Yates had ever made
showed that he had even thought
about the emotional implica
tions of the conflicts in them —
even when his protagonists
were engaged in a romance (as
in John and Mary). But in
Breaking Away, working from a
script that introduced some of
the most recognizably human
characters to populate any film
maker's vision of growing out of
adolescence, Yates showed in
sight and restraint; it was a ma
jor breakthrough.
Now in Eyewitness, the char
acters so far overshadow the
thriller plot that the story line
becomes superfluous. The hero,
Daryll Deever (William Hurt),
is a janitor and a Vietnam veter
an; he lives alone with a beau

tiful dog and a video tape rec
order on which he regularly rec
ords a TV news show featuring a
young woman, Toni Sokolow
(Sigourney Weaver), with
whom he is infatuated. She is
the daughter of Russian Jewish
emigres (Irene Worth and Al
bert Paulsen) and she lives with
a man named Joseph (Christ
opher Plummer) who is active
in the campaign to liberate Sovi
et Jews. Daryll is more or less
engaged to Linda (Pamela
Reed), an effervescent, forth
right girl whom he does not love.
But he has promised her brother
— volatile, irresponsible Aldo
Mercer (James Woods), a fel
low vet and buddy at work until
Aldo is fired for being insulting
to the boss — that he will marry
her. When the boss, an Asian
double agent whose reputation
as a duplicitous mercenary was
formed during the Vietnam
War, is murdered during
Daryll's shift, Aldo is the prime
suspect and Toni, sent to cover
the story, is brought into contact
with the man who has loved her
from his living room seat in
front of a television set for
months. The murder also brings
two unconventional, laid-back
cops to the scene: a pipe-smok
ing black man named Black
(Morgan Freeman), whose
marriage is breaking up, and a
white man named Jacobs
(Steven Hill), who is nearing re
tirement and whose dearest
wish is to extricate himself
from the force without ever hav
ing killed anyone.
This is surely the most unlike
ly roster ever assembled in a
murder picture. Tesich's gifts
for creating engaging charac
ters and writing slightly offbeat
lines for them — lines that reso
nate in the way that the speech
of memorable characters of
one's own acquaintance does —
are in evidence here as they
were in Breaking Away. And
Yates has found a cast of in
triguing camera subjects who

don't look like movie actors —
except for Christopher Plum
mer, who always seems to be us
ing his steely eyes and sug
gestive half-smile to hypnotize
the camera. Sigourney Weaver
is pretty, but in a half-formed,
anachronistic way; with her
hair down, she reminds one of
certain wan actresses of the for
ties (Teresa Wright, Cathy
O'Donnell, Loretta Young). Un
fortunately, her performance is
also rather nebulous.
William Hurt doesn't look like
an actor at all but he can cer
tainly act; that was obvious in
Altered States, even though his
role was patently absurd and the
best he could do with it was to
suggest the craziness of an over
ly committed scientist and to
offer some witty line readings.
In Eyewitness, he gives a
beguiling, unstressed per
formance; he involves us
through Daryll's quiet intensity.
Many of the supporting
players are given the opportuni
ty to demonstrate their gifts,
too: James Woods (he was the
psychotic in The Onion Eield),
Pamela Reed (who is becoming
one of the most versatile come
diennes in movies), Steven Hill,
Morgan Freeman and that fine
character actor Kenneth
McMillan, who plays Darryl's
crippled father, each have one
terrific scene.
Tesich is such an ingenuous
writer that we can accept char
acters in his script that we
would probably reject in other
movies as impossibly cornball.
In Breaking Away, the bicycle
jock hero's attempts to impress
the girl he loved by pretending
to be something he wasn't came
right out of Sherwood An
derson's old I'm a Eool, and in
Eyewitness Darryl woos Toni
with the kind of baldly romantic
lines that we no longer hear in
movies. Tesich gets away with
it because his characters are so
sweetly earnest that their corni
ness seems indigenous. And be

neath his writing is a Horatio Al
ger optimism: the rejected
townies win the race in Break
ing Away and the janitor in Eye
witness gets the rich girl.
(Tesich must also be the first
writer to give us a Vietnam vet
hero who is neither psy
chopathic nor emotionally
blocked.)
The problem with Eyewitness
is that it isn't really a comedy
drama about the interconnected
lives of interesting human
beings; it's a murder mystery.
Yates has amassed enough skill
in his years as a cold water hack
to carry off violent confronta
tions in dark basements with
considerable style, and there is
even one sequence — in which
Darryl and his assailant grapple
for a gun that is beneath the
hooves of a stable full of stam
peding horses — that is a clever
ly worked out variation on the
merry-go-round scene in
Hitchcock's Strangers on a
Train. The impersonal urban
spookiness of movies like The
Conversation and The Parallax
View, with their clean,
geometric designs and im
pressive use of large rec
tangular spaces, informs this
movie, too, particularly in the
first half hour. But the plot is in
every way inferior to the
flourishes Tesich has provided
in the dialogue and the charac
terization. Like Christopher
Plummer's overemphatic pres
ence, it keeps getting in the way
of the movie, and yet it is the
movie — at least, it's what the
movie is supposed to be. Ade
quately plotted as it is, this
thriller is far less exciting than
men with far less talent might
have produced. Yates and
Tesich don't seem committed to
the idea of a murder mystery —
hardly a tragedy — and their
perfunctory attitude toward the
elements in Eyewitness that tie
it to that genre may account for
the peculiarly tepid nature of
the movie.

showed that he had even thought
about the emotional implica
tions of the conflicts in them —
even when his protagonists
were engaged in a romance (as
in John and Mary). But in
Breaking Away, working from a
script that introduced some of
the most recognizably human
characters to populate any film
maker's vision of growing out of
adolescence, Yates showed in
sight and restraint; it was a ma
jor breakthrough.
Now in Eyewitness, the char
acters so far overshadow the
thriller plot that the story line
becomes superfluous. The hero,
Daryll Deever (William Hurt),
is a janitor and a Vietnam veter
an; he lives alone with a beau

tiful dog and a video tape rec
order on which he regularly rec
ords a TV news show featuring a
young woman, Toni Sokolow
(Sigourney Weaver), with
whom he is infatuated. She is
the daughter of Russian Jewish
emigres (Irene Worth and Al
bert Paulsen) and she lives with
a man named Joseph (Christ
opher Plummer) who is active
in the campaign to liberate Sovi
et Jews. Daryll is more or less
engaged to Linda (Pamela
Reed), an effervescent, forth
right girl whom he does not love.
But he has promised her brother
— volatile, irresponsible Aldo
Mercer (James Woods), a fel
low vet and buddy at work until
Aldo is fired for being insulting
to the boss — that he will marry
her. When the boss, an Asian
double agent whose reputation
as a duplicitous mercenary was
formed during the Vietnam
War, is murdered during
Daryll's shift, Aldo is the prime
suspect and Toni, sent to cover
the story, is brought into contact
with the man who has loved her
from his living room seat in
front of a television set for
months. The murder also brings
two unconventional, laid-back
cops to the scene: a pipe-smok
ing black man named Black
(Morgan Freeman), whose
marriage is breaking up, and a
white man named Jacobs
(Steven Hill), who is nearing re
tirement and whose dearest
wish is to extricate himself
from the force without ever hav
ing killed anyone.
This is surely the most unlike
ly roster ever assembled in a
murder picture. Tesich's gifts
for creating engaging charac
ters and writing slightly offbeat
lines for them — lines that reso
nate in the way that the speech
of memorable characters of
one's own acquaintance does —
are in evidence here as they
were in Breaking Away. And
Yates has found a cast of in
triguing camera subjects who

don't look like movie actors —
except for Christopher Plum
mer, who always seems to be us
ing his steely eyes and sug
gestive half-smile to hypnotize
the camera. Sigourney Weaver
is pretty, but in a half-formed,
anachronistic way; with her
hair down, she reminds one of
certain wan actresses of the for
ties (Teresa Wright, Cathy
O'Donnell, Loretta Young). Un
fortunately, her performance is
also rather nebulous.
William Hurt doesn't look like
an actor at all but he can cer
tainly act; that was obvious in
Altered States, even though his
role was patently absurd and the
best he could do with it was to
suggest the craziness of an over
ly committed scientist and to
offer some witty line readings.
In Eyewitness, he gives a
beguiling, unstressed per
formance; he involves us
through Daryll's quiet intensity.
Many of the supporting
players are given the opportuni
ty to demonstrate their gifts,
too: James Woods (he was the
psychotic in The Onion Eield),
Pamela Reed (who is becoming
one of the most versatile come
diennes in movies), Steven Hill,
Morgan Freeman and that fine
character actor Kenneth
McMillan, who plays Darryl's
crippled father, each have one
terrific scene.
Tesich is such an ingenuous
writer that we can accept char
acters in his script that we
would probably reject in other
movies as impossibly cornball.
In Breaking Away, the bicycle
jock hero's attempts to impress
the girl he loved by pretending
to be something he wasn't came
right out of Sherwood An
derson's old I'm a Eool, and in
Eyewitness Darryl woos Toni
with the kind of baldly romantic
lines that we no longer hear in
movies. Tesich gets away with
it because his characters are so
sweetly earnest that their corni
ness seems indigenous. And be

neath his writing is a Horatio Al
ger optimism: the rejected
townies win the race in Break
ing Away and the janitor in Eye
witness gets the rich girl.
(Tesich must also be the first
writer to give us a Vietnam vet
hero who is neither psy
chopathic nor emotionally
blocked.)
The problem with Eyewitness
is that it isn't really a comedy
drama about the interconnected
lives of interesting human
beings; it's a murder mystery.
Yates has amassed enough skill
in his years as a cold water hack
to carry off violent confronta
tions in dark basements with
considerable style, and there is
even one sequence — in which
Darryl and his assailant grapple
for a gun that is beneath the
hooves of a stable full of stam
peding horses — that is a clever
ly worked out variation on the
merry-go-round scene in
Hitchcock's Strangers on a
Train. The impersonal urban
spookiness of movies like The
Conversation and The Parallax
View, with their clean,
geometric designs and im
pressive use of large rec
tangular spaces, informs this
movie, too, particularly in the
first half hour. But the plot is in
every way inferior to the
flourishes Tesich has provided
in the dialogue and the charac
terization. Like Christopher
Plummer's overemphatic pres
ence, it keeps getting in the way
of the movie, and yet it is the
movie — at least, it's what the
movie is supposed to be. Ade
quately plotted as it is, this
thriller is far less exciting than
men with far less talent might
have produced. Yates and
Tesich don't seem committed to
the idea of a murder mystery —
hardly a tragedy — and their
perfunctory attitude toward the
elements in Eyewitness that tie
it to that genre may account for
the peculiarly tepid nature of
the movie.
The opening shots of Eye
witness are handsomely
creepy: set in the boiler room of
an office building at night, with
the sound of lightning and rain
outside, they evoke the at
mosphere of a classic murder
mystery. But we aren't watch
ing a new movie by John
Carpenter; this is a collabora
tion between director Peter
Yates and writer Steve Tesich,
whose initial screen partnership
produced one of the most poign
ant American movies of the past
few years, Breaking A tray. No
one who saw their first film will
be surprised to discover the
depth of characterization, the
muted humor, and the sharp, un
expected twists in the dialogue
that these men have brought to
Eyewitness; the surprise is that
there's a murder mystery in it
at all. It is more of a movie than
the requirements of its genre
call for — and less.
Tesich has really sensitized
Yates, whose movies for a dec
ade had a cash register efficien
cy and coolness to them. A pic
ture like Bullitt is about car
chases and shoot-ups; who can
rertember anything about the
character after seeing it?

But he has promised her brother
— volatile, irresponsible Aldo
Mercer (James Woods), a fel
low vet and buddy at work until
Aldo is fired for being insulting
to the boss — that he will marry
her. When the boss, an Asian
double agent whose reputation
as a duplicitous mercenary was
formed during the Vietnam
War, is murdered during
Daryll's shift, Aldo is the prime
suspect and Toni, sent to cover
the story, is brought into contact
with the man who has loved her
from his living room seat in
front of a television set for
months. The murder also brings
two unconventional, laid-back
cops to the scene: a pipe-smok
ing black man named Black
(Morgan Freeman), whose
marriage is breaking up, and a
white man named Jacobs
(Steven Hill), who is nearing re
tirement and whose dearest
wish is to extricate himself
from the force without ever hav
ing killed anyone.
This is surely the most unlike
ly roster ever assembled in a
murder picture. Tesich's gifts
for creating engaging charac
ters and writing slightly offbeat
lines for them — lines that reso
nate in the way that the speech
of memorable characters of
one's own acquaintance does —
are in evidence here as they
were in Breaking Away. And
Yates has found a cast of in
triguing camera subjects who

don't look like movie actors —
except for Christopher Plum
mer, who always seems to be us
ing his steely eyes and sug
gestive half-smile to hypnotize
the camera. Sigourney Weaver
is pretty, but in a half-formed,
anachronistic way; with her
hair down, she reminds one of
certain wan actresses of the for
ties (Teresa Wright, Cathy
O'Donnell, Loretta Young). Un
fortunately, her performance is
also rather nebulous.
William Hurt doesn't look like
an actor at all but he can cer
tainly act; that was obvious in
Altered States, even though his
role was patently absurd and the
best he could do with it was to
suggest the craziness of an over
ly committed scientist and to
offer some witty line readings.
In Eyewitness, he gives a
beguiling, unstressed per
formance; he involves us
through Daryll's quiet intensity.
Many of the supporting
players are given the opportuni
ty to demonstrate their gifts,
too: James Woods (he was the
psychotic in The Onion Eield),
Pamela Reed (who is becoming
one of the most versatile come
diennes in movies), Steven Hill,
Morgan Freeman and that fine
character actor Kenneth
McMillan, who plays Darryl's
crippled father, each have one
terrific scene.
Tesich is such an ingenuous
writer that we can accept char
acters in his script that we
would probably reject in other
movies as impossibly cornball.
In Breaking Away, the bicycle
jock hero's attempts to impress
the girl he loved by pretending
to be something he wasn't came
right out of Sherwood An
derson's old I'm a Eool, and in
Eyewitness Darryl woos Toni
with the kind of baldly romantic
lines that we no longer hear in
movies. Tesich gets away with
it because his characters are so
sweetly earnest that their corni
ness seems indigenous. And be

neath his writing is a Horatio Al
ger optimism: the rejected
townies win the race in Break
ing Away and the janitor in Eye
witness gets the rich girl.
(Tesich must also be the first
writer to give us a Vietnam vet
hero who is neither psy
chopathic nor emotionally
blocked.)
The problem with Eyewitness
is that it isn't really a comedy
drama about the interconnected
lives of interesting human
beings; it's a murder mystery.
Yates has amassed enough skill
in his years as a cold water hack
to carry off violent confronta
tions in dark basements with
considerable style, and there is
even one sequence — in which
Darryl and his assailant grapple
for a gun that is beneath the
hooves of a stable full of stam
peding horses — that is a clever
ly worked out variation on the
merry-go-round scene in
Hitchcock's Strangers on a
Train. The impersonal urban
spookiness of movies like The
Conversation and The Parallax
View, with their clean,
geometric designs and im
pressive use of large rec
tangular spaces, informs this
movie, too, particularly in the
first half hour. But the plot is in
every way inferior to the
flourishes Tesich has provided
in the dialogue and the charac
terization. Like Christopher
Plummer's overemphatic pres
ence, it keeps getting in the way
of the movie, and yet it is the
movie — at least, it's what the
movie is supposed to be. Ade
quately plotted as it is, this
thriller is far less exciting than
men with far less talent might
have produced. Yates and
Tesich don't seem committed to
the idea of a murder mystery —
hardly a tragedy — and their
perfunctory attitude toward the
elements in Eyewitness that tie
it to that genre may account for
the peculiarly tepid nature of
the movie.
