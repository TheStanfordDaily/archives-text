To have been living in Germa
ny in 1910' To have been a part
of that brave new world of
thinkers, for whom no thought
was irrhoten Schoenberg
tossed out tonality. Kandinskv
gave up realism. Nietzche said
to go beyond good and evil. Not
even monarchs could survive
the upheavals It was called Ex
pressionism
In the theater, it started with
writers such as Frank Wedekind
(Sprinn Auakrninf;. Pandora's
Hox) championing the validity
of sexuality and virility after
the aestheticism of Oscar Wilde
and others. It soon became a
movement, attracting Oskar
Kokoschka. Paul Kornfeld,
Georg Kaiser and many others
They had many goals — the syn
thesis of many art forms in
theatre, the glorification of the
individual, the smashing of
traditional values — but much
of the work had political over
tones. which has tended to date
the plays of the period very
quickly.

Georg Kaiser was. if not the
most important, at least the
most prolific member of this
group Although he wrote in a
variety of styles, he is remem
bered today chiefly as an ex
pressionist. His most famous
plays ' From Mom to Midnight.
the (i'a« trilogy» follow a sym
bolic hero through a sequence of
scenes (stations) on a path of
transformation from a societal
puppet to a proud individual Be
cause the hero as well as the
auxiliary characters are sym
bolic. they usually do not have
names and are labelled by their
function (for example. Cashier.
Billionaire. Engineer). Other
than in the major role, there is
little character development,
and the plays often have the
feeling of a religious rite rather
than a drama
As part of the San Francisco
German Expressionist festival,
the Magic Theatre is currently
putting on Kaiser's play Euro
pa It was written in 1915 (as a
release after finishing From
Morn to Midnight) and owes

much to the pre-expressionist
plays of Wedekind. It was re
cently translated by Stanford
Drama Prof Martin Esslin. for
this, its first English language
performance John Lion has de
signed the New Wave produc
tion. giving the play some con
temporary social relevance
In the Kaiser Lion Esslin
version of the legend. Zeus and
Hermes descend to earth in a
high-tech spaceship. When Zeus
overhears the men of Agenor's
kingdom fantasizing about Eu
ropa. he immediately vows to
win her. even though no man has
yet succeeded in this task.
Hermes discovers that Agenor's
people have lived in peace for
two generations, and have suc
ceeded in suppressing almost all
natural instincts The«men of
the kingdom now dress in flow
ing robes and strive to be
ethereal dancers
Europa. Agenor's daughter,
is a willful woman Her father
wishes her to marry, and he ar
ranges a dance contest, the win

ner of which will be her hus
band Zeus naturally wins the
contest, but Europa just laughs
at him and he runs off in shame
Later, Zeus comes after her in
the torm of a bull, and this un
heard-of virility immediately
wins her over. Meanwhile. Cad
mus (Agenor's son. who ran
away many years earlier) has
sent his army to round up all the
women in Agenor's kingdom
When Europa drags herself
back to the palace, clothes torn
and hair disshevelled. she im
mediately jumps at the chance
to run off with the macho war
riors. and persuades the other
women to follow her example.
Since the play was written in
1915 (the beginning ot the first
World War. the end of both a
peaceful period in Europe, and
the aesthetic movement), the
political interpretation is ob
vious. Although there are coun
terparts to these situations to
day (Marin County mellow, for
example), the ideas are dated.
The characters do not develop,

they merely search for op
portunities to express them
selves. Unfortunately, situ
ational transformation is not as
vibrant on-stage as character
transformation.
All this means that a very Im
aginative production is needed
if Europa '.s five scenes are not
going to be an ordeal. Luckily,
the people at the Magic Theatre
have good imaginations.
Easily the most startling im
ages are the slides used to de
pict people floating in the river
They are projected on a Vene
tian blind, the slates ot which
are gradually rotated. Behind
the blind is a billowing blue
cloth, representing the river. As
the slats rotate and the slides
change, the images travel from
blind to cloth and back again,
sometimes disappearing, The
images slowly shimmer and
tlicker through the water, like a
slow-motion Ondine.
The music chosen for the play
is also very effective. It is made
up of works by Brian Eno (Mu
sic for Airports) and minimalist
Steve Reich. Momentarily, it
can be lulling, but it gradually
grates on the subconscious.
Soon, it becomes much more
disturbing, a reminder of the
surreal nature of the play.
The dancing is less suc
cessful. In the early scenes, it
must be weightless and cloud
like, something not even
Baryshnikov could achieve.
Jack Shearer (as Zeus) tries
very hard with his stylized gym
nastics, but the script raises ex
pectations so high that his task
is hopeless. The play ends with a
long sexual dance involving
most of the company. The
choreography (by Emily
Keeler) of this section is often
dramatic, but could be much
starker as a contrast to the
earlier scenes. Dancers at The
Stud are often much more overt
in their symbolism.
Expressionism was the guid
ing light for much artistic de
velopment in this century. Its
ideas revolutionized painting,
theater, music, politics and
even redrew the map of Europe.
Even though expressionist play
wrights such as Kaiser have not
had the staying power of the fr
inge members of the movement
(such as Wedekind and Brecht),
the heady excitement of the
time comes through in their
plays. They believed that they
could change the world, and
they did.

up of works by Brian Eno (Mu
sic for Airports) and minimalist
Steve Reich. Momentarily, it
can be lulling, but it gradually
grates on the subconscious.
Soon, it becomes much more
disturbing, a reminder of the
surreal nature of the play.
The dancing is less suc
cessful. In the early scenes, it
must be weightless and cloud
like, something not even
Baryshnikov could achieve.
Jack Shearer (as Zeus) tries
very hard with his stylized gym
nastics, but the script raises ex
pectations so high that his task
is hopeless. The play ends with a
long sexual dance involving
most of the company. The
choreography (by Emily
Keeler) of this section is often
dramatic, but could be much
starker as a contrast to the
earlier scenes. Dancers at The
Stud are often much more overt
in their symbolism.
Expressionism was the guid
ing light for much artistic de
velopment in this century. Its
ideas revolutionized painting,
theater, music, politics and
even redrew the map of Europe.
Even though expressionist play
wrights such as Kaiser have not
had the staying power of the fr
inge members of the movement
(such as Wedekind and Brecht),
the heady excitement of the
time comes through in their
plays. They believed that they
could change the world, and
they did.

quickly.

As part of the San Francisco
German Expressionist festival,
the Magic Theatre is currently
putting on Kaiser's play Euro
pa It was written in 1915 (as a
release after finishing From
Morn to Midnight) and owes

much to the pre-expressionist
plays of Wedekind. It was re
cently translated by Stanford
Drama Prof Martin Esslin. for
this, its first English language
performance John Lion has de
signed the New Wave produc
tion. giving the play some con
temporary social relevance
In the Kaiser Lion Esslin
version of the legend. Zeus and
Hermes descend to earth in a
high-tech spaceship. When Zeus
overhears the men of Agenor's
kingdom fantasizing about Eu
ropa. he immediately vows to
win her. even though no man has
yet succeeded in this task.

is a willful woman Her father
wishes her to marry, and he ar
ranges a dance contest, the win

band Zeus naturally wins the
contest, but Europa just laughs
at him and he runs off in shame
Later, Zeus comes after her in
the torm of a bull, and this un

wins her over. Meanwhile. Cad

away many years earlier) has
sent his army to round up all the

When Europa drags herself
back to the palace, clothes torn
and hair disshevelled. she im
mediately jumps at the chance
to run off with the macho war

women to follow her example.
Since the play was written in
1915 (the beginning ot the first
World War. the end of both a
peaceful period in Europe, and
the aesthetic movement), the
political interpretation is ob
vious. Although there are coun
terparts to these situations to
day (Marin County mellow, for
example), the ideas are dated.
The characters do not develop,

they merely search for op
portunities to express them
selves. Unfortunately, situ
ational transformation is not as
vibrant on-stage as character
transformation.
All this means that a very Im
aginative production is needed
if Europa '.s five scenes are not
going to be an ordeal. Luckily,
the people at the Magic Theatre
have good imaginations.
Easily the most startling im
ages are the slides used to de
pict people floating in the river
They are projected on a Vene
tian blind, the slates ot which
are gradually rotated. Behind
the blind is a billowing blue
cloth, representing the river. As
the slats rotate and the slides
change, the images travel from
blind to cloth and back again,
sometimes disappearing, The

slow-motion Ondine.
