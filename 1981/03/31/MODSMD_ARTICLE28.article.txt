# Hepburn memorable in otherwise forgettable play
## 
### Richard Bliss 
- The best thing about The
Vfest Side Waltz, a new comedy
at the Curran Theatre, is
Katharine Hepburn. The play
itself is an unintelligent collec
tion of flat characters and old
jokes but Hepburn's razor sharp
performance is so engaging that
one may forgive everything
else. Hepburn plays Margaret
Mary Elderdice, a retired piano
teacher and widow who lives in
a decaying building on the West
Side of New York. Though
Margaret Mary is physically in
firm and eventually confined to
a wheelchair, she remains all in
dominitable, quick-witted spirit
and stubborn fortitude. The role
appears written with Hepburn's
public image very much in mind

and she plays it to the hilt
West Side Waltz has no plot
to speak of, and instead of end
ing. it stutters to a curtain call.
The playwright. Ernest Thomp
son, creates a static situation
and depends on his actors and
his jokes to carry the evening
Cara (Dorothy Loudon), a naive
and foolish neighbor, worries
about the aged Margaret Mary
and wants to take care of her. In
part to protect herself and in
part because she is lonely,
Margaret Mary eventually
takes in a boarder, the young
and mixed-up Robin, who wants
to be an actress. The play con
sists of Margaret Mary getting
older and weaker as she at
tempts to fend off Cara and
guide Robin. She has little suc
cess at either enterprise.

Both Cara and Robin are
clowns, providing nothing more
than abysmal stupidity to
Margaret Mary 's stoic self-con
trol. If the play was just an occa
sion for jokes, this clownishness
might be acceptable, but we are
also expected to maintain in
terest and sympathy in the char
acters' trite problems. Two oth
ers, a Romanian super who
can't speak English, and Cara's
glib boyfriend, round out the
cast, but both are so one
dimensional as to be trans
parent.
The jokes are uneven as well.
Sometimes Thompson stoops to
low and tired humor with cracks
about fat women, exhibitionists
and immigrants who speak poor
English. At other times he does

better with original and funny
dialogue, but the overall effect
is one of laziness
At all times Thompson is
well-served by his cast and di
rector. The timing, delivery and
pace are all lively and focused.
Hepburn gives dignity and
sparkle to even the lowest joke
and dullest repartee. It is im
possible to underrate the
amount of respectability she
brings to the whole evening She
does not simply command the
stage but possesses it.
Audiences have responded to
this slight play with standing ov
ations. It is clear that they are
not applauding the play but
Katharine Hepburn. Even in
this disappointing vehicle, she
deserves such praise.


Katherine Hepburn and Dorothy Loudon star in Ernest Thompson's
'.'The West Side Waltz" at the Curran Theatre (through April 25).
