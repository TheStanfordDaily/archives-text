# Violinist Itzhak Perlman shines at Stanford
## 
### Jim Edmondson 
Itzhak Perlnfan thrilled his Stanford audience in
Memorial Auditorium last quarter with a fantastic
display of violin virtuosity in the highlight concert of
the Lively Arts season. Perlman was stunning in the
variety and perfection of his technical accomplish
ments, presenting these with seemingly boundless
energy throughout the evening. Each piece was
well-conceived and played with complete con
fidence by the spirited Perlman, who even suc
ceeded in making his few errors musically convinc
ing.
The first half of the program included Mozart's C
major Sonata, KV 296 and Beethoven's t C minor
Sonata, Opus 30, No. 2. Each of these classical
sonatas, though precisely executed, lacked ex
pressiveness. Perlman was not daring in his in
terpretations, so these readings were only clean and
polished, but not exciting. In the Mozart, the deli
cate staccato figures were nearly scratches, as the
tone was not sweet, but rather the fuller sound of a
later period than Mozart's. The intimacy that is ap
propriate for Mozart's music was not apparent in
Perlman's performance.
The Beethoven sonata, written for piano with vio
lin accompaniment, emphasizes the piano as a solo
instrument. Each movement begins with the piano,
which states the theme, followed by the violin,
which answers and elaborates on the piano motifs.

Perlman's excellent accompanist, Janet Gug
genheim, proved herself more than merely a back
ground musician, as the strength of her playing
blended well with Perlman's. In this piece as well.
Perlman substituted exactness for delicacy in many
passages, though this did not detract significantly
from the performance.
The musical highlight of the evening began the
second half of the show. Here, Perlman floated
through Debussy's demanding Sonata in G minor
< 1916/17) with interpretive ease, negotiating the dif
ficult scales and arpeggios as easily as the eighth
notes, while achieving a unified, thoughtful per
formance. Perlman's performance was ebullient as
he smoothly modulated between slower and faster
sections, successfully capturing the diverse nature
of Debussy's work. Showing ideal stage presence,
Perlman shifted between the fast and slow figures
with no excess motion, making Debussy's changeful
piece all the more effective.
The rest of the evening was devoted to the kind of
technical flourish that sets Perlman apart from
most violinists. He relaxed his manner, joking with
the audience and indignantly refusing to play from
the music during Leopold Auer's arrangement of
Paganini's Caprice No. 24. a piece that demands a
dazzling array of unusual right- and left-hand tech
niques. Perlman flawlessly performed left-hand

pizzicato, double-stops, octaves, harmonics and
double-harmonics, as well as more bowings than one
could count. At times the complexity was so stun
ning that it seemed Perlman was plucking notes
from thin air. Similar in nature were the last two
pieces on the program, Malaguena and Introduc
tion and Tarantella by Pablo de Sarasate.
To play all those impossible figures without error
is a magnificent accomplishment in itself, but Per
lman was more than a great technician, he was a
great performer. He exuded an aura almost of mag
ic, and the audience was left in awe of his virtuosity.
When he wasn't playing, he bantered with his ac
companist and with the audience as if he were a
neighbor, and when he began to play, his violin was
another friend, towards whom he extended the same
geniality.
Perlman played two encores. Midnight Bells, a
Viennese melody, and Hora Staccato by Dinicu. a
lively piece arranged by Jascha Heifetz. After each
one he received a standing ovation from the SRO
Memorial Auditorium audience.
Perlman's limitless energy pervaded the entire
evening, and if he was not completely mature in his
interpretation of Mozart and Beethoven, his vir
tuosic mastery of Paganini and Sarasate was a treat
for the ears, and his showpieces were simply pure
enjoyment and happiness to hear.

the Lively Arts season. Perlman was stunning in the
variety and perfection of his technical accomplish
ments, presenting these with seemingly boundless
energy throughout the evening. Each piece was
well-conceived and played with complete con
fidence by the spirited Perlman, who even suc
ceeded in making his few errors musically convinc
ing.
The first half of the program included Mozart's C
major Sonata, KV 296 and Beethoven's t C minor
Sonata, Opus 30, No. 2. Each of these classical
sonatas, though precisely executed, lacked ex
pressiveness. Perlman was not daring in his in
terpretations, so these readings were only clean and
polished, but not exciting. In the Mozart, the deli
cate staccato figures were nearly scratches, as the
tone was not sweet, but rather the fuller sound of a
later period than Mozart's. The intimacy that is ap
propriate for Mozart's music was not apparent in
Perlman's performance.
The Beethoven sonata, written for piano with vio
lin accompaniment, emphasizes the piano as a solo
instrument. Each movement begins with the piano,
which states the theme, followed by the violin,
which answers and elaborates on the piano motifs.

Perlman's excellent accompanist, Janet Gug
genheim, proved herself more than merely a back
ground musician, as the strength of her playing
blended well with Perlman's. In this piece as well.
Perlman substituted exactness for delicacy in many
passages, though this did not detract significantly
from the performance.
The musical highlight of the evening began the
second half of the show. Here, Perlman floated
through Debussy's demanding Sonata in G minor
< 1916/17) with interpretive ease, negotiating the dif
ficult scales and arpeggios as easily as the eighth
notes, while achieving a unified, thoughtful per
formance. Perlman's performance was ebullient as
he smoothly modulated between slower and faster
sections, successfully capturing the diverse nature
of Debussy's work. Showing ideal stage presence,
Perlman shifted between the fast and slow figures
with no excess motion, making Debussy's changeful
piece all the more effective.
The rest of the evening was devoted to the kind of
technical flourish that sets Perlman apart from
most violinists. He relaxed his manner, joking with
the audience and indignantly refusing to play from
the music during Leopold Auer's arrangement of
Paganini's Caprice No. 24. a piece that demands a
dazzling array of unusual right- and left-hand tech
niques. Perlman flawlessly performed left-hand

pizzicato, double-stops, octaves, harmonics and
double-harmonics, as well as more bowings than one
could count. At times the complexity was so stun
ning that it seemed Perlman was plucking notes
from thin air. Similar in nature were the last two
pieces on the program, Malaguena and Introduc
tion and Tarantella by Pablo de Sarasate.
To play all those impossible figures without error
is a magnificent accomplishment in itself, but Per
lman was more than a great technician, he was a
great performer. He exuded an aura almost of mag
ic, and the audience was left in awe of his virtuosity.
When he wasn't playing, he bantered with his ac
companist and with the audience as if he were a
neighbor, and when he began to play, his violin was
another friend, towards whom he extended the same
geniality.
Perlman played two encores. Midnight Bells, a
Viennese melody, and Hora Staccato by Dinicu. a
lively piece arranged by Jascha Heifetz. After each
one he received a standing ovation from the SRO
Memorial Auditorium audience.
Perlman's limitless energy pervaded the entire
evening, and if he was not completely mature in his
interpretation of Mozart and Beethoven, his vir
tuosic mastery of Paganini and Sarasate was a treat
for the ears, and his showpieces were simply pure
enjoyment and happiness to hear.
