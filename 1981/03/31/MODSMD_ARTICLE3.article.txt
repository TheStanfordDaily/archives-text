Three University Food Service em
ployees and two Mountain View resi
dents were arrested in Palo Alto last
Wednesday night for having sold drugs
to Stanford students and local high
school students.
The arrests ended a four month-long
investigation by the Stanford police
that started when the police received
a tip from a former Lagunita Food
Service employee.
"We used an undercover agent at
Lagunita Food Service to infiltrate the
drug ring," Stanford Police Captain
Raoul Niemeyer said.
The undercover agent arranged to
buy a half-ounce of cocaine for $1200,
according to Niemeyer. Stanford,
Palo Alto, and Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Narcotics Task Force of
ficers arrested four suspects with
Stanford police warrants.
The fifth suspect arrested had the
half-ounce of cocaine and may have
been a source for the drug ring, ac
cording to Niemeyer.
Stanford Food Service employees
Frank Luis, 26, Brennan Pang, 26, and
Sarah Bush, 24, were arrested near
their 838 Rorke Street residence in
Palo Alto at about 7:30 Wednesday
night. Also arrested were Catherine
McCabe, 27, and Michael King, 25,
both of 879 El Camino Real, Mountain
View. The suspects were charged with
various counts of possession of drugs
and possession of drugs for sale.
Some of the drugs found on the
scene included marijuana, cocaine,
peyote, psilocybin mushrooms, and
amphetamines Various drug-related
paraphenalia was also found at the
scene, according to Niemeyer, and
marijuana was also found growing in
the yard of the Rorke Street resi
dence.
The arrest, which involved about 15
officers, was nonviolent, according to
the Stanford police. "These people

weren't dealing pounds," Niemeyer
said,"but they were selling small
quantities to a lot of people."
The investigation is "the first to use
an undercover agent" in the six years
Niemeyer has been with the police
force. A Stanford police agent was
specially trained by the County Sher
iff's Narcotic Task Force after the po
lice received their tip four months
ago.
Luis was employed at Lagunita
Food Service since last summer and
used his position to sell drugs to stu
dents. according to Niemeyer.
