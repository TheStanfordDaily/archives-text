Solidarity cancels strike
Warsaw, Poland — Solidarity, Poland's independent
trade union movement, called off a planned nationwide
strike set for today after it won important concessions
from the government in desperate, 11th hour negotiations.
"We are going to work tomorrow, Lech Walesa, leader
of the 10-million member labor federation, said after the
negotiations. "There will be no strike. I am 70 percent sat
isfied with the results of the talks."
The union, according to the communique read over
Polish television, has won a key demand that prompted the
call for the strike: dismissal by mid-April of both officials
responsible for a police beating of three unionists in the
northern city of Bydgoszcz last March 19.
The communique said that the government "expressed
regret" over the beatings that took place after Solidarity
members refused a police order to leave the provincial
council chamber. The unionists charged that the govern
ment officials adjourned the meeting before fulfilling a
promise to hear union grievances. The three victims were
beaten seriously after the police, about 200 of them, includ
ing officers in civilian clothing, herded them into a court
yard.
The communique failed to make any mention of Solidar
ity's demand for an end to prosecution of dissidents, even
if their activities violated the law
The decision to call off the strike, which would have
plunged the nation into economic chaos, snapped the
mounting tension and fears that have gripped Poland for
the past 10 days. It also eased concern throughout the
world of a possible Soviet Poland. Govern
ment leaders had warned of catastrophic consequences if
the strike had gone into effect.
Pope John Paul 11, a native of Poland who had expressed
deep concern over developments here in recent days, re
portedly had been involved in the effort to find a solution.
Hijacking hostages freed
Bangkok, Thailand — Indonesian troops swarmed onto a
parked Indonesian jetliner in early morning darkness yes
terday. killed four of the five hijackers who had held 55
people hostage, and after a three-minute gunbattle set the

captives free, a Thai spokesman said
Indonesian officials said none of the hostages was killed,
denying the Thai government's earlier report that a four
year-old boy had died in the attack
At 2:40 a m local time, about 20 soldiers crossed the air
field, thrust ladders against the plane's fuselage and sev
eral of the men clambered onto the wings, witnesses said
The troops forced open two doors and burst inside. Wit
nesses said machine gun fire was heard.
Spokesman Trairong Suwankiri said one commando and
the chief pilot were wounded. He said all others aboard had
been "saved' but did not say if there were other injuries.
He would not elaborate.
Three of the hijackers were killed outright and a fourth
was mortally wounded, dying later at a local hospital. Thai
and Indonesian officials said.
Two Americans, a Japanese and a Dutchman among the
hostages were reported unhurt Thai officials identified
one American as Ralph Donald Hunt, 28. an engineer from
Louisiana, but did not give a hometown. The Thais did not
identify the other American, but a U.S. Embassy source
said the last name was Heishmann and the age was about
45. Both Americans were "totally unscathed and in our
custody," he said.
The surprise attack came hours after Indonesia was re
ported to have bowed to the hijackers' demands and was
prepared to send 80 political prisoners to exchange for the
hostages.
Another corpse found in Atlanta
Atlanta — The body of a black boy was found yesterday
afternoon in the Chattahoochee River in southwest Fulton
County, the 21st black child to be found dead in the Atlanta
area in the past 20 months, authorities said.
"The only thing we know is we have located a young
black male that meets criteria of those found recently."
Fulton County Police Sgt. Denny Hendrix said.
Residents of south Fulton County found the body about
3:30 p.m. while boating on the river, according to Hendrix.
Dr. Robert Stivers, Fulton County medical examiner,
said the body was "pretty well decomposed" and probably
would not be identified until today at the earliest. He
added the autopsy would start until this morning.

Members of the special police task force that has been
investigating the slayings and disappearances of 22 black
children since July 1979 were called to the scene shortly
after the discovery.
Asked to estimate the age of the victim, Hendrix said he
was "more than 10 years old and less than 20."
The two children whose disappearances have been un
der investigation by the task force are 10-year-old Darron
Glass, who was last seen Sept. 14, and 16-year-old Joseph
Bell, who disappeared March 2.
California death penalty OK'd
Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court gave its author
ization yesterday to the resumption to capital punishment
in California, refusing to hear arguments that the state's
death penalty law is unconstitutional.
The justices voted 7-2 to let stand a death sentence im
posed upon Earl Jackson for the brutal 1977 murders of two
elderly widows in Long Beach, Calif. Jackson's is the first
death sentence to be cleared by both the California Su
preme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court in more than nine
years.
Yesterday's action does not automatically mean that
Jackson or any of the other 52 condemned men on death
row in the state's San Quentin Penitentiary will be put to
death at any time soon. If he chooses, Jackson, 23, could
delay his execution, perhaps several years, by filing a peti
tion for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his conviction,
first in state courts and then in federal court.

in California, refusing to hear arguments that the state's
death penalty law is unconstitutional.
The justices voted 7-2 to let stand a death sentence im
posed upon Earl Jackson for the brutal 1977 murders of two
elderly widows in Long Beach, Calif. Jackson's is the first
death sentence to be cleared by both the California Su
preme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court in more than nine
years.
Yesterday's action does not automatically mean that
Jackson or any of the other 52 condemned men on death
row in the state's San Quentin Penitentiary will be put to
death at any time soon. If he chooses, Jackson, 23, could
delay his execution, perhaps several years, by filing a peti
tion for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his conviction,
first in state courts and then in federal court.

Solidarity cancels strike
Warsaw, Poland — Solidarity, Poland's independent
trade union movement, called off a planned nationwide
strike set for today after it won important concessions
from the government in desperate, 11th hour negotiations.
"We are going to work tomorrow, Lech Walesa, leader
of the 10-million member labor federation, said after the
negotiations. "There will be no strike. I am 70 percent sat
isfied with the results of the talks."
The union, according to the communique read over
Polish television, has won a key demand that prompted the
call for the strike: dismissal by mid-April of both officials
responsible for a police beating of three unionists in the
northern city of Bydgoszcz last March 19.
The communique said that the government "expressed
regret" over the beatings that took place after Solidarity
members refused a police order to leave the provincial
council chamber. The unionists charged that the govern
ment officials adjourned the meeting before fulfilling a
promise to hear union grievances. The three victims were
beaten seriously after the police, about 200 of them, includ
ing officers in civilian clothing, herded them into a court
yard.
The communique failed to make any mention of Solidar
ity's demand for an end to prosecution of dissidents, even
if their activities violated the law
The decision to call off the strike, which would have
plunged the nation into economic chaos, snapped the
mounting tension and fears that have gripped Poland for
the past 10 days. It also eased concern throughout the
world of a possible Soviet Poland. Govern
ment leaders had warned of catastrophic consequences if
the strike had gone into effect.
Pope John Paul 11, a native of Poland who had expressed
deep concern over developments here in recent days, re
portedly had been involved in the effort to find a solution.
