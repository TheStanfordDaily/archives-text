Washington (AP) â€” James Brady,
the White House press secretary
critically wounded yesterday in a
shooting attack on President Ronald
Reagan, is a former Chicago public re
lations man known for his wit in deal
ing with reporters.
Brady was shot as he accompanied
the president from a speech at the
Washington Hilton Hotel. Doctors said
Brady had a "significant brain in
jury" and was in critical condition, al
though, according to television re
ports last night, Brady was out of
surgery and in better condition than
expected. Reagan also was wounded
in the attack and was in stable condi
tion after surgery.
Late bloomer
The 40-year-old Brady was a later
bloomer in Reagan's presidential
campaign, joining the effort after his

mary race.
During the fall campaign, the
rotund Brady was deputy to Lyn

Nofziger, Reagan's chief spokesman.

presidential press secretary and ac
tively campaigned for the.job.
He took the post on an "acting"
basis after Nofziger said he didn't
want it, then waited for a formal ap
pointment while more than a half
dozen journalists reportedly turned
the job down.
Reputation for wit
Brady's reputation for wit was de
veloped during his early days as press
secretary.
Before Reagan took office, Brady
was asked if the then president-elect
had said anything about Cabinet ap
pointments as he visited a meat
locker.
"The president-elect did not con
firm any Cabinet people at the meat
locker. There was a lot at stake," he
replied.
Brady is from Centralia, 111., the
only child of railroad man Harold
Brady and wife. Dorothy. He learned
his Republican politics at home, since

his mother was an active campaign
worker and his grandfather was mem
ber of the Marion County Board of Su
pervisors.
Attended law school
He graduated from the University
of Illinois in 1962, with majors in jour
nalism and political science. He spent
two years at the university's law
school before joining a Chicago ad
vertising firm where he worked for
seven years.
Brady spent a year on the staff of
Senate Republican Leader Everett
Dirksen. He also was director of legis
lative and public affairs for the Illinois
State Medical Society before moving
to Washington in 1968 to be a com
munications consultant to the House.
He later handled press relations for
the Office of Management and Budget
in 1977-79 and for Sen. William Roth, a
Delaware Republican.
Brady's wife, Sarah, is a former di
rector of administration for the Re
publican National Committee.
