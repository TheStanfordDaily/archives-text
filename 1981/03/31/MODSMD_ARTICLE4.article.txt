# Chappie 'RR' story an unhappy fluke
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
A bizarre coincidence added irony
to the first day of distribution for the
Stanford Chaparral yesterday, as the
campus humor magazine featured an
accidental parody on the shooting of
Ronald Reagan.
The Chappie staff produced a mock
section similar to the San Francisco
Chronicle's pink Datebook, featuring
as the cover story an article entitled
"Who Shot RR?" — a fictional ac
count of the shooting of the president
while attending a White House rodeo.
"We intended the story to be a
parody on the television show Dallas',
" explained staff editor Steve Kessler
yesterday. "Most of us are Re
publicans and we're pretty sorry it
happened "
Page 25 of the Chappie shows a
large picture of Reagan with smaller
inset pictures of former President
Jimmy Carter, Mrs. Reagan and a
horse. The caption asks "Who shot
RR?'
Following is a full page story by Jay
Martel recounting a fictional rodeo
where Reagan is shot and falls off his
horse. "Talk is that the guilty party
will be identified on the first show of

the new season, that is to say, Resi
dent Bush's first press conference,"
the story states.
Correct guessers are promised an'
all-expense paid trip to Arlington Na
tional Cemetery and partial clemency
from the Justice Dept.
Also included is a list of possible
suspects including "Welfare Reci
pients," "Poor People — let's face it.
there's always some out of work
schmuck who can't even write an en
tertainment column, and has to waste
somebody better than me." and W
Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoo
ver Institution.
"His pal Reagan ascends to top
banana, but does he give him one lousy
appointment? Are you kidding? Heck
he's old and bitter..." Martel wrote.
Although Kessler expressed sorrow
about the issue's timing, another
Chappie staffer said he wanted it
known that "we had prior knowledge,
but were not involved in the con
spiracy to kill the president. "
According to Hammer & Coffin So
ciety member "A 1 X", "We're going
fo send a copy of the issue to Ron with
our best wishes. "

Kessler denied that the issue would
be mailed to Reagan and added that
the Datebnok section has led to other
problems for Chappie staffers. Mike
Wilkins, editor of Chaparral, is pres
ently in Washington interviewing for a
State Dept. job, Kessler said. He said
that Wilkins included this issue in his
resume.
"I've got it in my resume, too, but
luckily (employers) will have already
read it before today," Kessler said
Despite the ironic timing. Kessler
said there were no plans to pull the
Datebonk section from any of the
12,000 copies of the magazines pro
duced.
When asked about the taste of the
story to begin with. Chappie staffer
Perry Vasquez called it "just one of
those things."
The "RR' refers to a publicity cam
paign last summer by the producers of
CBS' "Dallas" television show, which
included as the mystery element the
identity of character J R Ewing's as
sailant.
This month's issue of the Chaparral
called the shooting of Reagan "the
biggest media mystery since Who
shot J.R ?"
