# Campus horrified, concerned, disgusted
## 
### Karen Springen 
Like people across the nation reac
ting to the news of an assassination at
tempt on President Ronald Reagan's
life, students here abandoned partisan
politics to express horror, concern and
frustration.
Many students had considered the
possibility of Reagan's death in office,
"but usually it was in connection with
his age," as one student said.
Before they had learned that one of '
the shots had hit the president, stu
dents were relatively unconcerned.
Sophomore Libby Keller said that
when she first heard of the shots, she
thought "no problem — that happens
all the time."
But many cited subsequent emo
tions ranging from horror to disgust,
disbelief and confusion. Junior Steven
Soderberg said, "It made my stomach
feel really sick."
Concern for health
The most immediate concern was
for Reagan's health and any effect his
age might have on recovery.
Sophomore Vicky Bfowne was one of
several who were surprised that Rea
gan, despite his good health, did not
have a heart attack or other reaction
to the shock. Others cited further
health factors such as the risk of
surgery.
Junior Jane Siguenza said, "It was
kind of surprising that someone could

get that close to the president." This
belief contributed to the initial in
credulity of most students.
According to senior Eric Jonsson,
Reagan's definite positions may have
made him especially susceptible to at
tack. People have reacted more
strongly to Reagan than Carter, he
said. "He's addressing himself to very
volatile political issues," said
Jonsson.
Inherent risks
But most cited the risks inherent in
the office. Keller said, "We all take
risks and as a president you take more
risks."
Graduate student Mark Martin
said, "Maybe that's just part ol being
president." He added, "It shouldn't be
part of the job. It's independent of pol
itics."
Conflicting reports by the media
helped rumors run rampant. Siguenza
said she heard of the assassination at
tempt over the radio in The Store on
campus. "Rumors started flying,"
she said.
Reality
But students emphasized that tele
vision footage captured the outrage
and reality of the event. Martin said
that because of television filming,
"there was no question who did it."
Despite the early conflicting re
ports, most students were impressed
with media coverage and the manner

in which the cameramen remained un
der control
Gun control
Graduate student Jeff King said the
incident points to a need for handgun
control. "I just don't think that shoot
ing people is the answer to anything,'
he said. "It's pretty disgusting "
Senior Mari Harrison, who saw the
television account at Zots', said ev
eryone there started talking about gun
control.
Sophomore Meg Bowman was dis
turbed by the television coverage.
"They were playing around with the
human torso and I thought that was in
poor taste," she said.
Others felt insufficient attention
had been given to the other victims.

Another common reaction was ' not
again." as students pointed to the
tradition of presidential deaths every
20 years since the time of President
Abraham Lincoln.
Several students pointed to the im
possibility of eliminating danger Har
•ison said. "There isn't anything
luch you can do about a president
ho walks straight to the press every
ime." Junior Meg Miller also em
phasized Reagan's known public ap
pearance patterns.
Senior Dayna Goldfine voiced an
other prevalent sentiment when she
said, "I was surprised how easy it was
for someone to do something like
that."
