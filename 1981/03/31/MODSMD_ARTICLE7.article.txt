## New Argentine president faces same old problems 
### Log Angeles Times 
Buenos Aires, Argentina —
Argentina's military dictators
exchanged one appointed presi
dent for another Sunday when
retired Gen. Roberto Viola took
office The new regime faces a
panic-stricken economy, an un
stable political future and hard
decisions about its human rights
policies.
The three problems have sep
arate roots, but they have be
come so entangled that failure
to solve any one of them could
lead to Viola's downfall. The
most serious at the moment is
the economy.
Following months of shaki
ness. real panic has occurred in
the last two weeks.
As rumors spread that the
peso would be heavily devalued
or that a bank holiday would be
called, people stormed ex
change houses to buy American
dollars.
Still another major sore is in
flation. So far this year, the rate
is back up to 126 percent.
Criticism
The economic situation has
been the focus of most of the
major criticism ot the outgoing
Videla government with de
mands for change coming from
all political and economic sec
tors.
Viola has kept quiet about his
economic plan, but whatever he
does will bring negative reac
tions from one sector or anoth
er.
That will cause political prob
lems, and Viola may not be in a
position to successfully handle a
real challenge.
When the military overthrew
Peron in 1976 there was a feeling
that only the armed forces could
save the nation, but the mili
tary's unity quickly broke down.
Admirals and generals were
concerned with economic and
political issues. These hard
liners also favored continuing
harsh treatment for terrorists.
Opposed to them were more
moderate figures, including
Videla and Viola, who favored
lessening the violent anti-ter
rorist policy and moving, albeit
slowly, toward a civilian gov
ernment.
The moderates dominated
finally, but in recent months the
division has become noticeable
again, with the hard-liners
charging that Viola is too mod
erate and that return to civilian
rule should be delayed.
Predominant view
After much jockeying for
position. Viola's view remains
predominant. His cabinet will
be more civilian than military,
and he has appointed civilian
governors in six of the country 's
23 provinces.
But he has had to pay a price,
including the appointment of
Several hard-liners to such key
departments as the interior
ministry, which controls the po
lice and security agencies.

Further, his cabinet includes
ministers who oppose the eco
nomic policies of the previous
government, which Viola is
pledged to continue.
A key civilian in Videla's
camp who is continuing under
Viola says the coalition govern
ment will make Viola's job dif
ficult "The first battle will be
over economic policy, but in the
long run the more serious issues
will involve the move toward ci
vilian rule and how to handle hu
man rights."
Human rights
As important as the economy
is. and as serious as the political
divisions appear, the human
rights questions may be what
will determine the fate of Vio
la's regime.
The new president was no
soft-liner when it came to deal
ing with radical leftist ter
rorists who plagued Argentina
in the 19705. He supported and
participated in their sup
pression. during which an esti
mated 15.000 persons died and
another 6000 disappeared.
But Viola is believed to think
that such violence is no longer
needed and that it is time to put
an end to the kidnappings, tor
ture and killing of the military's
opponents.
The issue now is the 6000 peo
ple who vanished — allegedly at
the hands of government forces.
There is no real question that
those people are dead. The issue
is whether to acknowledge their
disappearance.
Those arguing for that course

say that issuing a list of the' dis
appeared" will end the prob
lem, that the relatives and
friends of the missing will be
satisfied They also argue that
such action will ease the in
ternational criticism of Argen
tina as a major violator of hu
man rights
However, opponents say that
that will only increase the prob
lems because instead of being
satisfied, relatives will demand
to know who was responsible
and then call for punishment.
There have been signs recent
ly to support that view In the
last several weeks, security
agents have harassed and ar
rested key human rights ac
tivists.
Mothers of missing people
have been arrested when they
tried to seek information about
their children and union ac
tivists have been threatened and
attacked.
Many observers blame the re
currence of government op
pression on hard-liners in the
military who were said to be
warning Viola that they still
have power and will use it if he
is too soft.
Still, many observers think
that Viola will continue moving
the country toward civilian con
trol. They believe that his
strategy at the end of his three
year term will be to appoint an
other moderate general, or even
a civilian, with the aim of allow
ing elections sometime about
1990.
