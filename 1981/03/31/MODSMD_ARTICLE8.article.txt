Moammar Khadafy's govern
ment has announced plans to
complete the state's takeover of
the economy by the end ot this
year by shutting down all
private stores that haven't al
ready been closed.
It also has barred Libyans
from withdrawing more than
500 dinars, or about $1500. in
cash trom their bank accounts
in a single month.
The aim, according to
Mohammed Zaroug Rajab, who
is the equivalent of premier in
Libya's loosely organized "peo
ple's" government, is "the
abolition of private commerce
in 1981."
Khadafy proclaimed four
years ago that "people's con
trol" would eventually reign
throughout the economy of this
oil-rich Sahara desert country.
Since then, the government
has nationalized foreign trade,
putting hundreds of wealthy im
port-export firms out of busi
ness, and completed the
takeover of all factories and oth
er heavy industry.
Khadafy opposes private
property, saying it "robs men of
their freedom and independ
ence." His government is build
ing multi-story glass and steel
supermarkets to replace the
small grocery and clothing
stores that are closing down
along the streets of this port
capital.
