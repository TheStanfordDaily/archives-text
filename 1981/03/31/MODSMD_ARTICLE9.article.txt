# After the famine: Niger defies odds with food production success
## 
### Washington Post 
Niamey, Niger — The devastating
Sahelian drought and pervasive ci
vilian corruption provided the pre
text for the bloody army coup that
brought a military government to
power here seven years ago. Yet,
perhaps uniquely for Africa. Niger's
severe military government has
achieved what it announced it had
taken power to accomplish — self
sutficiency in food and an end to
mass starvation.
Situated in Central Africa'S/Semi
arid Sahelian belt. Niger will always
be at the mercy of the weather's
vagaries, but since 1974 it has
plowed its meager resources and
what foreign aid it has received into
increasing production of staple
grains with such intensity that the
country may achieve a level of pro
duction that exceeds its 2.7 percent
annual population growth rate. That
would be a first for contemporary
Africa.
Officials in African countries,
many of which were self-sufficient
in food before independence, have
become alarmed in recent years by
the ever-increasing amounts of
scarce foreign exchange their coun
tries spend on imported foodstuffs.

Africa's estimated population of
400 million is increasing on a yearly
average of 3 percent while food pro
duction. where it is not declining, is
increasing at a rate far below the
birth rate. Despite huge outlays in
foreign assistance and grandiose ag
ricultural schemes, most African
countries have not been able to re
verse this trend. The one exception
is Niger.
"For the past three years," said
the director for the U.S. Agency for
International Development in Ni
ger, Jay Johnson, "Niger is the only
Sahelian country out of the total of
eight that has not needed any emer
gency food" donations.
"And it appears now that food
production in Niger is exceeding
population growth," Johnson added.
Niger's austere military ruler.
Col. Seyni Kountche, took power
from what many neutral observers
have characterized as a corrupt and
mismanaged elected civilian gov
ernment that had exacerbated the
painful problems the country of 5.5
million suffered during the 1968-1974
Sahelian drought.
"Kountche's government is an au
thoritarian regime that acts arbi
trarily and doesn't follow Western

concepts of judicial procedure, for
example, but his government does
not treat people unfairly," added an
other Western observer.
Uranium
Niger is fortunate in having large
amounts of uranium in its northern
desert regions around the town of
Arlit. Earnings from uranium ex
ports, which doubled to 400.000 tons
a year in the past two years, have, in
part, fueled the country's successful
program of stepping up food produc
tion. The country may face some
tighter economic measures in the
near fhture, however, since the
world market price of uranium
dropped from $46 a pound last year
to the current price of $32 a pound.
The plunge in uranium earnings,
75 percent of Niger's revenue, may
lead to a severe cutback in a number
of expensive development projects
and a money crunch in the mid-1980s
when a number of the large loans
come due.
Although the government refers
to itself officially as provisional,
there have been no signs that
Kountche plans to allow a return to
civilian government in the near
future. His government has recently
appointed a commission to study the

creation of a grass-roots organiza
tion, called Development Society,
that theoretically will allow some
broad-based participation in the for
mation ot government policies.
Modernization
Observers and Nigerians are anx
ioujjlv awaiting the commission's
recommendations, due by January
of next year, as the Development So
ciety is supposed to serve as a vehi
cle for modernization, maintain the
political status quo and not disrupt
the traditional lifestyles and values
of the peasants, who make up 90 per
cent ot the population
"That is a very tall order," said
one observer. "What 1 think it
amounts to is this government is suf
fering from a complex because it
does not have a mandate to rule." he
added. "Kountche is very respected
by the Nigerians but he is not popu
lar."
Asked in an interview why there
has not been a move back toward ci
vilian government if his govern
ment is indeed provisional,
Kountche referred to his country's
poverty and lack of a sense of na
tional identity.
"We cannot make the hungry man
a democrat," said Kountche. "In

Niger, our primary needs are tood,
housing, education, health and being
clothed. Second, we have become a
nation very recently, 20 years ago."
with still divided and possibly dis
ruptive ethnic groups.
The Developmment Society's
"whole consequence would be to
prepare tor final and real de
mocracy in Niger," Kountche said.
"We'll take the necessary meas
ures to avoid becoming the slaves of
the International Monetary Fund,"
said Kountche.
Last year, Niger's peasants pro
duced 1.7 million tons of grain,
mostly sorghum and millet, or
200,000 tons more than the country's
annual needs. "Each year (since the
end of the drought) we're getting in
creases and the farmers are build
ing up their stocks," said AID of
ficial Johnson
"We are a proud people," said
Kountche. "There were many heads
of families who were really humil
iated (during the drought) by this
(tood donation) process because
they had to ask for their day-to-day
tood."
For now, he concluded, "as long
as there is good rainfall in Niger, we
are not going to ask for food."
