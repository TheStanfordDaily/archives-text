Mr Traveler goes on a one week business
trip, leaving his wife at home However, being a I
concerned husband he vows to call home J
every evening to check up on things On the
first night he calls home and asks Is every
thing OK at home 7
Everything s fine, honey his wife replied,
I served chicken tor dinner and the kids are j
watching a Jacques Cousteau special right j
°!such relieved. Mr Traveler bid his wife I
good night, and promised to call again the next I
night Unfortunately, the next night things
didn tgosowell When he asked Mrs Traveler
if everything was OK she said
Everything s not OK, dear, the cat died
Mr Traveler was, ol course, heartbroken, as
ne was very attached to the cat After the lump
in his throat went down he became angry with
the way his wile broke the news
You shouldn t have dropped the bomb all at
once like that You should have staggered it
over several days For instance on the first
night you could have said, The cats on the
roof and we can t get him down, and the sec
ond night you could say The Fire Department
is trying to get the cat down but they re not
having any luck, and then the third night you
could say The cat s still on the root and he
| hasn t eaten in three days and then the fourth
! day you could say The cat finally died, and
then I d be ready tor the news You should
build up to it rather than blurting it all out at
once
I guess you re right, Mrs Traveler admit
ted, I'll try to say it differently next time
So what else is going on at home'' Mr
Traveler continued
"It's your mother Mrs Traveler said.
She s on the roof and we can t get her down
The Pope s assistant entered the Pontiff s
office Excuse me your Holiness, but I must
speak with you tor a moment he said
Yes my son, what is it?"
Well, there s some good news and some
bad news
Go ahead
The good news is that waiting to talk with
you. on line two. is none other than our Lord
Jesus Christ returned to earth in the second
coming
Are you serious 7 This is incredible, astoud
ing! For centuries we have been praying tor
this blessed event and now, in our lifetimes,
God has chosen to return his son to us! How
glorious this is 1 Wait — you said something
about bad news 7
Yes — he s calling from Salt Lake City
