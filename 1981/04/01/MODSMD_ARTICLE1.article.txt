For 20 years ■John Anderson was a
loyal Republican member of the U.S.
House of Representatives. He entered
the race for the WHO Republican pres
idential nomination among a pack of
more than half a dozen other
hopefuls. Then, after failing to win
support in the primaries, Anderson
broke with his party and set a new
course as an independent.
Anderson lost the November elec
tion. getting only 7percent of the pop
ular vote, but he continues to discuss
issues and politics as if he were pre
paring to enter the race once again for
the presidency. Yesterday he was on
campus to begin what will be a 10-
week stint as a guest professor in the
Political Science department.
In an exclusive Daily interview, An
derson discussed the two party sys
tem in America, the attempted as
sassination attempt on Ronald Rea
gan. the role of young people in poli
tics and the potential for the emer
gence of a new political party in Amer
ica — perhaps led by John Anderson.
Daily: As a proponent of handgun
control, how do you view Monday's
tragic shooting which wounded Presi
dent Ronald Reagan and three other
men?
Anderson: I just wonder how many

more incidents of this kind it will re
quire to really shock the American
conscious to the point that we do some
thing about it. We have to accept the
discipline ot controls in this country or
we re not going to do anything about
the problems handguns create.
Daily: Ronald Reagan has been an
opponent of handgun control. Will the
shooting Monday change his mind
about such regulation 9
Anderson: I'm afraid not. He ad
dressed the issue during the campaign
and he has an inflexibility that would
not be altered even by his own brush
with death.
Daily: What kind of job do you think
President Reagan has been doing in
his first three months in office 0
Anderson: I think he has been far
more skillful than Jimmy Carter in
working with the legislative branch.
Even with massive majorities ot his
party in both houses of the Congress,
Carter's energy program was chewed
up. I think it is safe to predict that a lot
of the cuts Reagan has called for will
be adopted His tax cut program is in
more doubt but even that may be
passed in somewhat altered form
When you come to the substance of
his' proposals, there I have profound
differences. I don't think the priorities
he has announced of an unbelievably
huge buildup in our military forces —

inevitably at the expense ot some of
our needs at home — are the right
priorities
Daily: After it became clear that
you could not win the presidency, why
didn't you drop out from the race?
Anderson: Because I thought that it
was important that somebody con
tinue to state the issues that I was talk
ing about. Increasingly, I saw a
hawkish attitude overtaking both ma
jor parties and Reagan and Carter. I
thought the two party candidates be
came indistinguishable on their views
of the possibilities of fighting a nucle
ar war. That one issue alone was suffi
cient and important enough to keep
me in the race — to continue to decry
the false idea that we live in a world
where we can afford to entertain the
concept of building up arms to the
point where we can fight and survive a
nuclear war.
Daily: Did you stay in the race to
get federal matching funds to cover
your substantial campaign debts?
Anderson: It was not an important
consideration. After we had reached
the point where most people had con
signed our campaign to inevitable de
feat, I went out and borrowed $2 mil
lion I wouldn't have had to expose my
self to that additional liability just a
month before the campaign was over
if I just wanted to cut my losses. In

stead of gambling on a very, very
dicey proposition of getting a certain
percentage of the vote I should have
just quit spending money and folded
up the campaign.
Daily: Were you trying to maintain
high visibility and momentum in prep
aration for a 1984 presidential bid?
Anderson: Obviously, I think I
would be a far more viable candidate
in 1984 having stayed on to finish the
race in 1980 than had I just dropped out
when the going got tough. So from that
standpoint, yes, I think that is a factor.
T am not suggesting that I have de
cided to run in 1984, but should I make
that decision, I would be doubly glad
that I did not yield to the fainthearted
advice of some who suggested I simply
get out.
Daily: During your presidential
election bid, many observers charac
terized your support as a narrow polit
ical base of affluent white collar pro
fessionals, suburban liberals, students
and academics, and Jews angry over
the Carter Administration's Middle
East policies Why did you have such a
narrow base of support during the
election and how will you overcome
this problem in 1984°
Anderson: Well, my campaign tried
to get support from blacks and labor —
I visited with the national black and la
