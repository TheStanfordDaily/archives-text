For 20 years ■John Anderson was a
loyal Republican member of the U.S.
House of Representatives. He entered
the race for the WHO Republican pres
idential nomination among a pack of
more than half a dozen other
hopefuls. Then, after failing to win
support in the primaries, Anderson
broke with his party and set a new
course as an independent.
Anderson lost the November elec
tion. getting only 7percent of the pop
ular vote, but he continues to discuss
issues and politics as if he were pre
paring to enter the race once again for
the presidency. Yesterday he was on
campus to begin what will be a 10-
week stint as a guest professor in the
Political Science department.
In an exclusive Daily interview, An
derson discussed the two party sys
tem in America, the attempted as
sassination attempt on Ronald Rea
gan. the role of young people in poli
tics and the potential for the emer
gence of a new political party in Amer
ica — perhaps led by John Anderson.
Daily: As a proponent of handgun
control, how do you view Monday's
tragic shooting which wounded Presi
dent Ronald Reagan and three other
men?
Anderson: I just wonder how many

more incidents of this kind it will re
quire to really shock the American
conscious to the point that we do some
thing about it. We have to accept the
discipline ot controls in this country or
we re not going to do anything about
the problems handguns create.
Daily: Ronald Reagan has been an
opponent of handgun control. Will the
shooting Monday change his mind
about such regulation 9
Anderson: I'm afraid not. He ad
dressed the issue during the campaign
and he has an inflexibility that would
not be altered even by his own brush
with death.
Daily: What kind of job do you think
President Reagan has been doing in
his first three months in office 0
Anderson: I think he has been far
more skillful than Jimmy Carter in
working with the legislative branch.
Even with massive majorities ot his
party in both houses of the Congress,
Carter's energy program was chewed
up. I think it is safe to predict that a lot
of the cuts Reagan has called for will
be adopted His tax cut program is in
more doubt but even that may be
passed in somewhat altered form
When you come to the substance of
his' proposals, there I have profound
differences. I don't think the priorities
he has announced of an unbelievably
huge buildup in our military forces —

inevitably at the expense ot some of
our needs at home — are the right
priorities
Daily: After it became clear that
you could not win the presidency, why
didn't you drop out from the race?
Anderson: Because I thought that it
was important that somebody con
tinue to state the issues that I was talk
ing about. Increasingly, I saw a
hawkish attitude overtaking both ma
jor parties and Reagan and Carter. I
thought the two party candidates be
came indistinguishable on their views
of the possibilities of fighting a nucle
ar war. That one issue alone was suffi
cient and important enough to keep
me in the race — to continue to decry
the false idea that we live in a world
where we can afford to entertain the
concept of building up arms to the
point where we can fight and survive a
nuclear war.
Daily: Did you stay in the race to
get federal matching funds to cover
your substantial campaign debts?
Anderson: It was not an important
consideration. After we had reached
the point where most people had con
signed our campaign to inevitable de
feat, I went out and borrowed $2 mil
lion I wouldn't have had to expose my
self to that additional liability just a
month before the campaign was over
if I just wanted to cut my losses. In

stead of gambling on a very, very
dicey proposition of getting a certain
percentage of the vote I should have
just quit spending money and folded
up the campaign.
Daily: Were you trying to maintain
high visibility and momentum in prep
aration for a 1984 presidential bid?
Anderson: Obviously, I think I
would be a far more viable candidate
in 1984 having stayed on to finish the
race in 1980 than had I just dropped out
when the going got tough. So from that
standpoint, yes, I think that is a factor.
T am not suggesting that I have de
cided to run in 1984, but should I make
that decision, I would be doubly glad
that I did not yield to the fainthearted
advice of some who suggested I simply
get out.
Daily: During your presidential
election bid, many observers charac
terized your support as a narrow polit
ical base of affluent white collar pro
fessionals, suburban liberals, students
and academics, and Jews angry over
the Carter Administration's Middle
East policies Why did you have such a
narrow base of support during the
election and how will you overcome
this problem in 1984°
Anderson: Well, my campaign tried
to get support from blacks and labor —

bor union leaders. But I think they are
so traditionally minded in their ap
proach to politics that they simply
could not capture the vision of what it
would mean to support an independent
candidate and free themselves from
their political bondage to the Demo
crats and Republicans. I accuse both
the black leadership and union leader
ship in this case of being very conser
vative in their thinking. . . very, very
narrow-guaged in their vision and in
their ability to break out of the mold
and to really try something different.
With that kind of leadership it was
hard for the rank and file to peer over
the shoulder of those who were sup
posed to be leading them and see the
possibilites inherent in my candidacy.
I guess next time I would try to a
greater extent to appeal over the
heads of that kind of inbred conserva
tive leadership and appeal more
directly to the people.
Daily: Why did you have such
strong support in the Bay Area?
Anderson: A large percentage of the
population in the Bay Area is highly
educated and very socially conscious.
Those are all features of a profile of an
Anderson voter.
Daily: However, the majority of the
electorate is not well educated nor do
they fit this profile you have sug
gested. How will you attract their sup
port?
Anderson: I think the very future of
democracy hangs on our ability not to
pitch our campaigns to the lowest
common denominator. We must ac
cept the challenge of trying to get a
core group of well educated people to
broaden their influence in society.
Once we abandon that goal and just
say that we are just going to get down
to the lowest common denominator in
the campaign, elections are not going
to provide the kind of leadership that
this country needs to survive.
Daily: What is fundamentally
wrong with the two party system in
America today?
Anderson: The parties are smug —
self-satisfied. Having had
monopolistic control for 125 years
they simply are not as amenable to
new ideas or accessable to people who
do not fit their precise mold or defini
tion of what a loyal party person
should be. They don't encompass the

kind of pluralism and diversity a great
political institution should represent
They are geriatric cases.
Daily: Will the crushing defeat of
the Democratic party in the last elec
tion force it to improve its respon
siveness to the people?
Anderson: I think they have been
pathetic during the last five months. I
listen to their muling in the Senate
about how awful the Reagan budget
proposals are and then they cravenly
fall in line and vote for the resolution.
What kind of credible opposition is
that?
Daily: Is the Great Society dead in
America and will it be replaced by a
more conservative government and
people?
Anderson: I think it is — at least for
the next four years. There is no reason
to doubt that Reagan is completely
sincere in his whole concept to try to
free the federal government of much
of the responsibilities it has claimed
and exercised over the last two or
three decades. He is attempting to
slew off that federal responsibility. It
is an administration that is going to
try to narrow the scope of federal con
cerns and do that efficiently.
Daily: Isn't this what the people
want?
Anderson: I don't think they really
want this. The American people today
are frustrated. They have gone
through a period of high inflation, un
employment and of stagflation. The
traditional ethic of Western society
that mans' life will continue to im
prove — they haven't seen that occur.
Over the last few years things seem to
be going in a downward spiral. We are
not the first country to display this
frustration. Everybody knows that it
was out of the great disillusionment in
the Wiemar Republic — where infla
tion was out of control and the middle
class wiped out — that the seeds of the
dictatorial regime of the Nazis were
sown.
That is an extreme example. I'm
not suggesting that we are teetering
on the verge of dictatorship. But I am
suggesting that the public despair and
disillusionment has nurtured the be
lief that it is the government that is re
sponsible for the present condition and
that the government is the real cul
prit. Sure the people are going to give
the government the back of their hand

and for a time support an adminis
tration that says it will free the people
from the responsibility of paying tax
es to take care of mental health, to
clean up the environment and to make
the workplace more safe. It sounds
good. After the people have quaffed
the cup of that kind of disillusionment
for a while, the taste is going to go bit
ter I think people will realize that col
lectively there are some responsi
bilities that cannot be ignored. Simply
to recite the shibboleth of individual
initiative and individual freedom and
then let everything around you go to
hell is not befitting a great de
mocracy. So I have great optimism
that the collective conscience of the
American people will reassert itself,
but it might be after four years of
Ronald Reagan before that happens
Daily: Do you feel that an independ
ent presidential candidate can have a
chance of winning the election, or do
the lessons learned from your presi
dential bid, that of Eugene McCarthy
and George Wallace suggest that such
a race is pure folly?
Anderson: I think you have to have a
party. I quite recently have come to
believe that an independent candidate
is regarded as being too ephemeral. A
party represents an institution, a kind
of permanence and stability that an in
dependent bid lacks. The independent
bid tends to be too much a lightning
rod down of the protests that would
reign on the other candidates — and
you cannot build simply on that. The
candidate has got to build more
positively and radiate out from a
broader base the notion that he has
ideas, that he has a platform, that he
has an ability to govern. He must dis
pell the notion that he is simply an an
gry man who is defying the present
and promising a future that he cannot
deliver. If I were to run again, I would
do so under the banner of a new party
because I see nothing immutable
about two parties. There are room for
two parties and possibly four in this
country.
Daily: Do you still consider yourself
to be a member of the Republican Par
ty?
Anderson: If nothing else, I am a
pragmatist. I see no place for me in a
party that is espousing the ideas of this
administration which are alien to
what I have come to beleive over the

last two decades. I am an independent.
Daily: Have you started to lay the
groundwork for this new party of
which you speak?
Anderson: No. no. It is just an idea
that is percolating in my mind.
Daily: If you were to begin to form
such a party, when would you start to
bring things together for it?
Anderson: Probably at the end of
this year.
Daily: Why have you decided to re
strict your time committment to Stan
ford to two days a week?
Anderson: Largely because of the
necessities of making a living. I can
not discharge my financial responsi
bilities to my family with the stipend
that I will earn here (Anderson re
ceives $10,000 for his one quarter
teaching commitment). It is very
purely and simply the necessity of
doing some other things that will
enable me to make a living. If I had my
druthers I would dearly love to spend
two entire months doing nothing else.
I don't really have the ability to do that
right now.
Daily: What are your other commit
tments now?

Anderson: I will be making three
appearances a week on a Chicago tele
vision station doing news commen
tary. I also have several speaking
commitments that I made even before
I accepted the position here. I am very
frank, the reason I do it is because it
pays.
Daily: What do you have to gain
from teaching at Stanford 0
Anderson: I want to be able to con
tinue to interact with the minds of this
generation. Contact with university
students is an extremely important
thing for me, not only out of a sense of
gratitude for the enormous contribu
tion they made to my campaign, but I
also just enjoy the opportunity to sit
around and talk to get them to tell me
their concerns and what some of their
ideas are of what we could and should
be doing I think young people provide
that prod to social conscience that is
often missing in other layers of our so
ciety. Young people, fundamentally,
are still idealists They have not been
corroded and rusted over with the
cynicism that otherwise is so per
vasive.
Daily: Will students be an impor

tant and an integral part of your new
political party?
Anderson: I would hope so. If I de
cide to form one I cannot think of any
group that I would want to draw more"
heavily for ideas and for the muscle
power.
Daily: Are you hoping to use Stan--
ford's prestige, the contact you will
have with students and the publicity
you will gain from teaching here to
further your own political interests?
Anderson: Very frankly, there
would be other, better ways, of doing
it. While I do respect Stanford as an
academic institution, it is still a rather
confined area and I have turned down
many engagements already as a results
of my committment here. So I do not~
think that it represents any great po~
litical plus.
Daily: Do you miss being out of poli
tics?
Anderson: No. because I am still in~
it. I have many contacts in politics. l\
don't feel that I have been washed up~
on the beach and left high and dry. H
am out paddling around in
waters.
