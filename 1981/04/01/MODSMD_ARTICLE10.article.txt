# Confused coverage of the assassination attempt
## Trying to distinguish rumor from fact 
### 
From the Daily wire services
The shooting of President
Ronald Reagan was brought to
the country Monday in all its
bloody drama and with stunning
swiftness by the television cam
era. But developments through
out the day were not always as
they appeared on the screen. In
the confusion of trying, to dist
inguish rumor from fact, the
medium often mistook one for
the other.
Nevertheless, in riveting, on
the-spot footage, videotaped
only minutes earlier, the coun
try was exposed once again to
the horror of an attempted as
sassination: the terror of a fa
miliar, presidential outing in-

stantly transformed at the
sound of pistol shots; of men
being shot and falling down; of
other men waving machine guns
and drawing pistols; of people
kicking, struggling and cursing,
and of blood spilling onto a side
walk from a man who had just
received a bullet in the brain.
The cameras of the three tele
vision networks — NBC, ABC
and CBS — caught the scene vir
tually from the gunman's view
point — and except for a few mo
ments when the shots rang out,
seldom wavered. Almost as
though it were a scene directed
for a movie, they showed the ac
cused gunman swarmed over by
police and Reagan being shoved
into a limousine. They closed in
on the bloody head of White
House press secretary James
Brady as he lay face down above
a grating, caught Secret Service
agent Timothy McCarthy doubl
ing over as he was shot, a
wounded police officer
sprawled on the wet pavement,
and, in a single freeze shot, the
gun itself, still in the gunman's
hand, pointed in firing position.
Then the scene, which was
first shown unedited by ABC
News within 20 minutes of the
shooting, was played over and
over again, often in slow mo
tion, and later, with frame-by
frame explanations of the action
by the network anchormen.
CBS and NBC showed the
same scene in videotapes that
ran for about five minutes,
within a minute of each other.
Inevitably, the violent scene
outside the Washington Hilton
recalled similar scenes of past
violence — all captured by the
camera and indelibly thrust into

the consciousness of the country
with the same unblinking re
alism: Jack Ruby shooting Lee
Harvey Oswald, live and on
camera, in a Dallas jail; Robert
F. Kennedy lying on his back in
the kitchen of a Los Angeles ho
tel; Alabama Gov. George
Wallace gunned down in a Mary
land shopping center — the gun
man's hand also poking into
camera range.
As in that past coverage, tele
vision was doing what it is often
said that it does best — bringing
to the public the immediate im
pact of a major news event vir
tually as it occurred. But if the
camera itself never wavered in
its accurate portrayal of horror,

the humans controlling it
proved less reliable in Monday's
drama.
In their breakneck effort to
keep up with the story as it was
developing, the networks — and
to some extent, the wire ser
vices — unwittingly misled the
public and caused themselves
considerable embarrassment.
In the first 45 minutes of the
story, all three networks as
sured viewers that Reagan had
escaped "unscathed," as one
newscaster put it. At 2:50 p.m.,
for example, ABC reported that
he had "gone to the hospital"
but, apparently passing on in
formation from White House
sources, said that he had done so
only to accompany Brady.
When the report came in that
Reagan had in fact suffered a
wound, anchorman Frank Rey
nolds cried: "My God! What we
were telling you was incorrect.
The president has been hit in the
left chest!"
At another point, in an effort
to gain control of the informa
tion pouring in, Reynolds re
fused to give out the name of the
accused gunman, and barked at
an off-camera aide — "I'm not
going to give out this man's
name until we get the source of
the information."
Throughout the day, the
network correspondents com
plained of the lack of informa
tion and the inaccuracy of some
of the reports, official and unof
ficial, that were being passed to
them by their news bureaus and
people on the scene. But they
went on reporting them just the
same. Unidentified White
House sources mainly were
blamed. At one point, NBC's

Marvin Kalb commented:
"When this afternoon of horror
began, the White House said the
president had not been hit. We
want to be sure as we pass on
this information that it is con
firmed."
The. worst journalistic
blunder — and again .White
House sources were blamed by
the networks — occurred when
all three networks reported that
Brady had died as the result of
his head wound. CBS' Dan Rath
er had even narrated a lengthy
visual obituary of his life before
it learned that he was still alive
but in critical condition.
Other conflicting reports,
partly the result of uncertain
verification, partly the result of
the networks' trying to straddle
the line between reckless com
petition and journalistic ac
curacy, continued to occur
throughout the day.
For awhile, Reagan was re
ported in surgery and then inac
curately reported out of it and
doing well; there was conjec
ture over whether his lung had
been punctured, or whether it
had simply collapsed; whether
he was undergoing exploratory
surgery or open-heart surgery.
The report that he had under
gone open-heart surgery was
one of the more ominous of the
afternoon, coming as it did when
the country was under the im
pression that Reagan was in
pretty good shape and that the
bullet had missed his heart. The
"rumor," as the networks
labeled it, apparently was
started by someone who, in the
excitement of the moment, had
not distinguished between open
heart surgery and open-chest
surgery.
NBC even put Dr. Frank Field
on camera to interview a New
York City surgeon about the sig
<nificance of "open-heart
surgery" — "very serious, in
deed," the doctor replied — only

to have to cancel that report
within minutes.
The videotape itself was part
ly the cause of the impression
that Reagan had escaped un
harmed. Examined again and
again on the air by the an
chormen and the viewing pub
lic, it showed Reagan smiling
and waving as he approached
the car. Then his expression
changed to one that might have
been fear or consternation, but
not necessarily pain, before he
was pushed into the car. The
suddenness of the attack, and
the quick reaction of the Secret
Service, led reporters at the
scene to think that the glimpse
they had caught of Reagan in
dicated that he had not been
hurt.
Undeterred, however, the
networks were still passing out
unofficial reports that Reagan
had successfully weathered the
operation 40 minutes before a
medical briefing confirmed it.
