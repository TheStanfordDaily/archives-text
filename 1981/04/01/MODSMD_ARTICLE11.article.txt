## Handgun control needed 
### 
4
Once again, an American public figure
has been gunned down. For the fourth time
in the last twenty years and the third time
in the last six, an American president has
been the victim of an armed assault on his
own soil. Monday's tragedy also involved
the lives and families of three members of
the presidential entourage. Words of con
dolence or sympathy seem hollow when
such attacks are so frequent that they
seem just another news item to the nation.
The assassination attempt will no doubt
spark many tired analyses of the
American soul. Some will see it as an ex
cuse for increased domestic police sur
veillance; others may hint darkly at the
implication of imagined enemies at home
or abroad. The attempt may be a symbol
of the rising culture of violence in the na
tion. As handgun murders reach epidemic

proportions, a renewed national effort to
restrict the availability of handguns is
warranted. Concrete steps should be
taken to relieve the frustration the nation
feels at its inability to protect its citizens
and its leaders.
We take no comfort in the irony that this
president wounded by an attacker's bullet
has long been a vigorous opponent of gun
control and a supporter of the public right
of access to firearms, a right that allowed
his assailant to purchase the weapon easi
ly-
We hope that the nation will respond
with a concerted effort to properly regu
late the sale of handguns to make it con
siderably harder for people to acquire
these inexpensive, easily concealable
weapons, which serve no purpose but to in
jure and kill.
