Left remains
I have read with interest the
debate between Lewis Gann and
his critics. It is worth noting
that historically all sorts of
rightist dictatorships have
fallen (Hitler, Mussolini, Fran
co, Salazar, Peron, the Greek
colonels — to name but a few),
but we are still waiting for a
communist dictatorship to fall.
Until we are able to witness ex
amples of the latter. Gann will
continue to have the better of
the argument. It is the seeming
permanence of communist
tyrannies that makes them
more abhorent than other types.
I am sure that most of us
would not want to live under op
pressive regimes to be found in
many Latin American coun
tries, but it is a challenge to
those who would overthrow
these to demonstrate that there
can be authentic liberation (and
how), and not simply replacing
one tyranny with a more per
manent one.
It cannot be denied that there
are forces struggling to over
throw rightist dictatorships,
and there are ample examples
of past successes, but com
munist dictatorships have been
more successful in their brutal
repression of opposition, real or
imagined. Moreover, in the two
instances (Hungary and Czecho
slovakia) where the Soviet
Union perceived a threat to
those communist regimes, it
sent in its military forces and in
stalled new leaders judged to be
more loyal to Moscow.
Is there a path to authentic
liberation, or are we condemned
to the alternative of a more per
manent tyranny?

Kill med-flies
After reading the letter in de
fense of the Med-fly by Milt Chu.
Brad Thayer, and Ken Breitag.
(Daily, Feb. 27), we are ap
palled to think anyone could sup
port this position. The Med-fly
may be entitled to the equalities
and civil justice of this great
country, but it has no authority
to infringe upon the rights of
other citizens. It must be re
membered that the fruit trees
immigrated here for the same
rights Chu, Thayer, and
Breitage give the Med-fly. How
ever, the Med-fly has not hon
ored the trees' rights. In so
doing, the Med-fly forfeits all its
own privileges.
Furthermore, we believe the

Med-fly is secretly being backed
by the Soviet Union. Their dev
astation of the fruit trees is part
of a communists plot to destroy
the economy of Palo Alto and all
of Northern California. We urge
you to join us in our fight against
communists like Chu. Thayer,
and Breitag by cutting down ev
ery fruit tree with a yellow rib
bon around it. In this way. you
will be helping the patriotic
health officials in their cam
paign to wipe out the Med-fly.
We can no longer stand idly by
as these three ruthless vigi
lantes promote a doctrine re
pugnant to the spirit of de
mocracy.

Cycle disgrace
Once again twenty or more in
considerate bicyclists have
completely blocked access to
Green Library for all people in
wheelchairs. For the past few
weeks I have been enraged to
find a crowd of bicycles parked
in front of the wheelchair access
ramp to the main library on
campus, while the lot built for
bicycles, less than twenty feet
away, has plenty of open space.
Today, I went and talked to
the library staff and called the
Dean of Student Affairs. I
learned that they "are working
on it." Working on getting a
sign, working on raising con
sciousness. ocassionally "tag
ging" the bicycles.
Next time park your bikes
where they belong. Take the
time and thought to be con
siderate of others. Because,
even as the bureaucracy begins
to move at its glacial pace, ev
ery one of us must take respon
sibility for becoming aware of
the needs of others, and chang
ing ourselves. We have to be
come constantly aware of what
this newly won access to public
facilities means to people in
wheelchairs, and guard it dear

Kill game
We are disturbed "by the
growth and widespread popu
larity of that ritual of symbolic
violence called Assassin. We

ask those participating to con
sider the hours they have de
voted to plotting the "murder"
of their dorm-mates, while at
the same time complaining of
having too little time for other
extracurricular activities.
The game's defendants claim
that they are merely playing
with toy guns and rubber darts,
a "harmless" way to relieve
pent-up frustration. Yet, al
though the violence in Assassin
is symbolic rather than real, we
interact with our world and with
each other largely through such
symbols. Such games are symp
tomatic of the competitiveness
of our society.
Assassin demonstrates our
callous disregard of one of the
greatest problems of our socie
ty, that of increasing violence.
If violence appears in the guise
of a child's game, then we are
more likely to perceive violence
in the world as a mere form of
entertainment.
Lastly, as RAs, we are also
dismayed that Assassin is resi
dence-based. for we consider
the dormitory a kind of home or
community, not an arena for
tribal warfare.
