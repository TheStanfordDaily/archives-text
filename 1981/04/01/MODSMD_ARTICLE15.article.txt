# The 						Stanford Daily Opinions
## Dean Kardassakis University should start an etiquette code 
### 
The Stanford Honor Code seems to be
cracking at its seams if not actually gaping
widely open. Rather than doing a Band-Aid
job on these defects, we should concentrate
on behavioral patterns. As a guide to cam
pus mores we suggest the following Eti
quette Code.
1. Students who walk should always yield
to bike riders. When you are in a hurry, you
do not want to worry about some stupid pe
destrian who thinks he owns the sidewalk.
2. Professors should not have affairs with
students — without first assigning their
grade. In like manner students who are get
ting an A should not date their professor:
they should give someone else a chance.
3. Professors should realize students are
paying over six grand per year just to be
here and that they are not paying that kind
of money to get C's. Students are here to get
the best degrees and grades money can buy.
4. Students who act like preppies should
not be socially ostracized. They should be
shot.
5. Professors should never refer in class

to " the last time I was in Rome" — most of
the class will have been there more recent
ly. The others gave up Rome years before.
6. Pre-meds who tear pages out of jour
nals so others cannot use them should mail
the pieces back to the library they were
taken from so the librarians can tape them
back in for the next crop of pre-meds to rip
out.
7. Professors should not refer in a grad
class to a journal article more than a year
old — someone in the class is bound to have
written something much more recent (and
was subsequently quoted in Time).
8. Students at Stanford should not com
pare themselves to those at Harvard — why
should we bring them up to our level?
9. Professors must never get to know any
one by name, after all this is Stanford not
Bryn Mawr.
10. Students from well known states (like
California and New York) should not make
fun of classmates from obscure states that
few people have heard of (like lowa, Kan
sas, or about 45 others).
11. Professors should cultivate interest

ing past times, like knitting, playing the
dulcimer or kite flying. It is cheaper than
skiing or concert going and suggests style.
12. T.A.'s should be selected on the basis
of their minority status, race, and/or sex
but never their ability. Otherwise the pro
fessors will feel threatened.
13. Professors should strive to excel in
their field. It looks so much nicer to have
"Nobel Laureate" or "Pulitzer Prize Win
ner" written beneath the signature on let
ters of recommendation.
14. Students should not be given assign
ments over ski weekends or for other impor
tant events in .the life of a student — such as
Super Bowl Sunday. Thanksgiving, the Ides
of March or the Viennese Ball.
15. No one should take the Etiquette Code
too seriously. Just look at what has hap
pened to the Honor Code.
