## Keep current pass-no credit deadlines 
### 
I was distressed to read that
the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement C
AAA has tentatively decided to
recommend changing the dead
lines for declaring a Pass/No
Credit grade and for dropping a
course. While I certainly ap
preciate the C-AAA's concern
for undergraduate education, a
number of important points
have been overlooked
There already exists an im
plicit disincentive at Stanford
regarding elective Pass/No
Credit grades. It is well known
that most students here even
tually go on to do graduate
work, and, as one professor put
it, "Graduate admission" com
mittees read "plus" and think
"C." While this may be an ex
ageration, the fact remains that
an elective pass grade looks
worse on a transcript than does
a letter grade, and for this rea
son most undergraduates shy
away from pass/NC grading.
The C-AAA asserts that
pass/NC grading encourages
students to "manipulate" the
system, but I am aware of no
studies that back up this asser
tion. How many units does the
"typical" student elect to take
plus/NC, and how many units
does he/she graduate with? It is
the ratio of two numbers
that determines whether stu
dents abuse the pass/NC option.
For example, if "plus" grades
comprise no more than, say,
five percent of a "typical" stu
dent's units, then it would be dif
ficult to regard that as "manip
ulation" of the system.
Moving the Pass/No Credit
deadline to the third week of the
term might well increase the
use of plus/NC grading. As
stated by the C-AAA, this option
<is appropriate for studenls who
wish to explore an area of the
university far removed from
their major, but, as previously
stated, students prefer letter
grades to their pass/NC coun
terparts. Moving up the dead
line would call for many stu
dents to decide whether they
wanted to use the less desirable
pass/NC grading before they
had a firm basis on which to
gauge their performance in a
class (e.g. a midterm or a pa

per). Since it is generally ob
served that those taking a
course for a letter grade study
harder (and therefore, presum
ably, learn more) than do those
hoping for a mere "plus," mov
ing the deadline up would de
crease a student's incentive to
maximize the educational bene
fit of a class.
Moving up the pass/NCdecla
ration deadline would also se
verely limit the flexibility of the
system. Consider the plight of a
student who elects to take a
class for a grade and then suf
fers some type of crisis in mid
quarter that prevents him/her
from putting the necessary ef
fort into a class to maintain that
grade. Such crises might in
clude sickness, family problems
(e.g. divorce, death, etc.), or
even unexpected interview trips
to the east coast for medical
school. It is certainly unfair to
penalize students for involun
tary and unforseeable mis
fortunes, but the proposed
change would, in fact, have such
an effect.
An even bigger problem, how
ever, is that students faced with
a choice between a pass/NC
class outside their field of con
centration and a letter-graded
course within their major would
tend to choose the latter (again,
because a letter looks better on
a transcript than does a
"plus"), and this would lead to
even more academic special
ization than presently occurs.
Tightening up the pass/NC grad
ing then, could well work
against the goal of guaranteeing
a "liberal education" for each
student, a goal the university
purports to value.
To argue that dropping a class
just before the final involves
"no real penalty" is unrealistic
and simplistic. It ignores the
tens of hours of work that a stu
dent has invested and that will
not be acknowledged on the
transcript, the implicit finan
cial penalty thereby involved
,($l4O per unit for a student tak
ing 15 units, assuming that tui
tion goes only for classes), and
the loss of a course that a stu
dent might have taken had
she/he not elected to attempt
the class eventually dropped

Th 6 C-AAA asserts, again
without any support of which I
am aware, that the current drop
deadline leads to the retaking of
classes for the sole purpose of
procuring a better grade. Such
an asserton can only be sup
ported by an analysis analogous
to that above described for de
termining whether students ma
nipulate the plus/NC options.
Even if it were shown that stu
dents retake an inordinate
number of units, it would still
remain to determine their
motivation for this. My own ex
perience leads me to believe
that students retake classes
most often to improve their un
derstanding of the material
(e.g. retaking Chem 33 in order
to better prepare for Chem 35),
rather than to obtain a higher
grade. Quite frankly, retaking
classes is an enormous pain and
most often not worth the bother
just for the sake of a better let
ter on a transcript.
One must ask the question,
"What should an 'A' repre
sent?" There are two compet
ing answers to this question,
both of them consistent with the
C-AAA's definition of "A" as
"exceptional." The first argues
that an "A" students is excep
tional with respect to his/her
classmates (the idea of grading
on a curve), while the second
maintains that the "A" students
is exceptional in regards to
some absolute scale of per
formance set up by the eval
uator. Using the former
criterion, a certain portion of a
class will always receive an
"A," regardless of the quality of
their work, and the remainder
of the students will be unable to
receive this grade even if they
have learned a great deal.
The second outlook is more
desirable, for it places em
phasis on mastering course ma
terial, rather than on competing
with fellow students. On an
absolute scale, a student knows
that he/she alone is responsible
for his/her fate, but in a class
grade. As a result, a student who
has no such control over his/her
grade. As a result, a student who
has received, say, B's on all
mid-quarter assignments has

little incentive to really push
him/herself for the final, for
he/she knows that the chances
of his/her "beating the curve"
are remote.
A system fostering such an at
titude can hardly be conducive
to education, and it is for this
reason that I am distressed to
read the C-AAA's recommenda
tion that "the Senate might wish
to institute guidelines regarding
the distribution of letter grades
in larger undergraduate
classes." Such a "solution"
would only increase competi
tion and academic pressure, in
crease the emphasis on grades
vis a vis learning, and dis
courage those students near the
bottom of the curve (reception
of a "D" or a "NC" hardly in
spires quality work). One must
wonder, "What is the educa
tional benefit of decreasing a
person's grades?"
Is it the University's place to
facilitate the evaluation of its
students by graduate schools?
To answer in the affirmative au
tomatically shifts the focus of
the school from education to
evaluation, a shift that is highly
undesirable. Even if one an
swers "yes," however, the issue
merits more than just a cursory
examination. Consider the ex
ample of Stanford pre-law
CPA's cited by the C-AAA.
While law schools may find it
disconcerting that 34 percent of
Stanford students taking the
LSAT had a CPA of 3.6 or better,
this does not necessarily mean
that that is true of the student
body as a whole. Only a portion

of each class takes the LSAT,
and it is quite possible that his
group of students has a higher
than-average GPA; in other
words, self-selection may well
take place.
Support is lent to this view by
the Phi Beta Kappa Society.
They have a limit of inducting
no more than 12 percent of the
senior class into their society,
but they have difficulty meeting
this limit when they look at only
those students who have an LGI
of 3.7 or higher (LGI means
"Letter Grade Index" and is es
sentially the same as GPA).
Twelve percent of the students
at 3.7 or better is certainly not
the same as 34 percent at 3.6 or
better, and the former figure
considers all students, whereas
the latter does not. So are CPA's
in general really as skewed
toward 4.0 as Jack Friedenthal
seems to intimate? What is the
true extent of the "grade infla
tion problem?"
This is not a thorough dis
cussion of Pass/No Credit grad
ing or the dropping of classes or
even grading in general. But any
revision of the guidelines affect
ing these topics will certainly
have to address these issues.
TheC-AAA should revise its ten
tative recommendations and
recognize that the current dec
laration deadlines, while admit
tedly imperfect, function much
more to the educational benefit
of Stanford students than would
the proposed changes.
