### 
Washington (AP) — An emo
tionless John Hinckley Jr., de
scribed in court as "wandering,
aimless and irresponsible" and
under psychiatric care, was or
dered held without bond yester
day on a charge of attempting to
assassinate President Ronald
Reagan outside a Washington
hotel.
Hinckley, 25, of Evergreen,
Colo., was held at an un
disclosed location and was
scheduled to undergo psy
chiatric testing today to help de
termine his competency to
stand trial, U.S. Attorney
Charles F.C. Ruff said. A pre
liminary hearing was set for 10
a.m. EST Thursday.
There was no immediate in
dication of a motive for Mon
day's shootings.
Hinckley appeared subdued
throughout a 45-minute mid
night hearing Monday at the fed
eral courthouse two blocks from
the Capitol as the U.S. attorney
filed formal charges and a fed
eral magistrate advised the de
fendant of his rights.
In addition to attempting to
assassinate the president,
Hinckley was charged with as
saulting a Secret Service of

ficer.
Attempting to kill the presi
dent carries a maximum sen
tence of life imprisonment,
while the charge of assaulting a
federal officer is punishable by
up to 10 years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.
The sandy-haired Hinckley,
represented by two court-ap
pointed lawyers, often an
swered "Yes, sir" when Magis
trate Arthur L. Burnett asked if
he understood his constitutional
rights.
Ruff told Burnett over de
fense objections that the FBI in
terviewed several people who
knew Hinckley, including his pa
rents, who described their son
as "wandering, aimless and ir
responsible."
According to the prosecutor,
Hinckley has never been em
ployed, has enrolled and
dropped out numerous times
from Texas Tech University and
has been under psyciatric care.
He was arrested last Oct. 9 in
Nashville, Tenn., and charged
with illegal possession of three
weapons, and ended up for
feiting his bond in that case.
"When he was arrested Oct.

9, President Jimmy Carter was
present in that city," Ruff said,
adding that Hinckley purchased
another weapon on Oct. 13.
The Secret Service said
Hinckley was not listed among
the 400 people it considered to be
potential assassins or among
the 25,000 less likely assailants
whose names are stored in a Se
cret Service computer.
Harold Covington, of Raleigh,
N.C., a leader of the National
Socialist Party of America, said
Hinckley was once a member of
the neo-Nazi group but quit in
1979.
Hinckley's two court-ap
pointed lawyers, Stuart Fisk
Johnson and Ed Wilhite, argued
at the hearing that since this
was not. a capital crime,
Hinckley should be released on
bond. They also sought unsuc
cessfully to close the hearing on
grounds it would generate un
fair pre-trial publicity.
Hinckley told Burnett, in re
sponse to questions, he had no
job, no bank accounts, owned no
land, buildings or real estate
and could not pay a lawyer $1000
as a fee.
