President Ronald Reagan yesterday was giv
en the first detailed information on the as
sassination attempt that had occurred as he
left a Washington hotel nearly 24 hours
earlier.
Although he slept from time to time during
the day and received a mild pain-killing drug,
the president also read newspapers and took a
small step toward resuming the duties of of
fice. Just hours after emergency surgery to
remove a ,22-caliber bullet from his left lung.
Reagan signed into law the well-publicized
bill curbing milk price supports that came out
of the administration's first contest with the
Congress over cutting the federal budget.
"I would not be surprised to see him up and
walking around in a couple of days," Dr. Den
nis O'Leary, a spokesman for the George

Washington University Hospital, said.

pened in the melee outside the Washington
Hilton Hotel from Dr. Daniel Ruge, the White
House physician, and from his wife. Nancy,

press secretary, had been shot in the head by
the gunman who lurked in a crowd of re
porters and photographers, the president ex
claimed, "Oh damn. Oh damn." His eyes
welled with tears and he asked whether the
bullet had gone into Brady's brain, and then he
inquired about Brady's chances of survival.
James Baker, the White House chief of staff
who was also in the room with the president,
said that the president had been aware that at
least one other person had been hit in the hail
of bullets because he had gotten a glimpse of a
body lying on the ground as his limousine sped
away.
The president was told Monday night that a

Secret Service agent had indeed been
wounded, Baker said, but he was not told
about Brady because a tube placed in Rea
gan's throat immediately after the operation
would have prevented him from talking.
Brady was reported to have improved yes
terday, but friends and hospital officials said
that it was still impossible to speculate on the
extent to which he will recover The bullet
passed through Brady's brain, causing "fairly
extensive damage" to the right side, a hospi
tal official said.
"We really don't know how he's going to end
up." O'Leary said "We believe he is going to
live We are cautiously optimistic."
Late in the afternoon, Dr. Ruge, who was in
the presidential entourage at the time of the
shooting and who observed the emergency
surgery, issued a formal statement saying
that the president "continues on the road to
recovery."
According to Ruge's statement, Secret Ser

vice Agenv Timothy McCarthy "continues to
improve." Washington police officer Thomas
Delahantv was listed in fair condition.
In the wake of the assassination attempt,
security was noticeably more strict.
Meeting reporters in his White House office
yesterday. Baker explained some of the early
confusion that led to initial reports that the
president had not been hit by gunfire.
As soon as the shots were heafd, the presi
dent was shoved headlong into the back of the
armored limousine by Secret Service agent
Jerry Parr, chief of the White House detail.
At first, Baker said, Reagan thought he had
been injured when he was shoved into the car
At that point, he said. Parr ordered the limou
sine to return to the White House. The order
was changed and the car raced toward the hos
pital. six blocks west of the White House, after
the president complained that he was having
difficulty breathing

Although Reagan walked into the emer
gency room under his own steam. Baker said
that he "sort of passed out there in the emer
gency room."
As Reagan began a recovery process now
estimated to keep him in the hospital for a
week or two. John Warnock Hinckley, who
was charged with the assassination attempt,
was being held in the brig at Quantico Marine
base south of Washington
Larry Speakes, the deputy White House
press secretary, said that activity in the West
Wing offices of the Executive Mansion was re
turning to business as usual, with Bush filling
the routine appointments and staff meetings
on the president's schedule.
Reagan was apparently surprised when he
was told that three others were wounded.
"That means four bullets hit," he said. "Good
Lord."
