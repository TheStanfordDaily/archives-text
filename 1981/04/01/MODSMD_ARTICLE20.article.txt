# U.S. bombers seen as strong signal
## 
### Washington Post 
Minot, N.D. — B-52H bomber crews at the
Strategic Air Command base here near the
Canadian border have a new mission —
being ready to drop bombs in the Persian
Gulf to protect oil supplies.
War plans call for the eight-engined
bombers to strike at night at low level,
either from North Dakota or from bases
abroad, with Egypt's Ras Banas the prime
candidate.
The idea is to be prepared to send a strong
signal to the Soviet Union whenever oil sup
plies or other vital interests are threatened
in distant places like the Persian Gulf or
Africa.
Fourteen long-range B-52Hs here and an
other 14 at nearby Grand Forks, ND. Air
Force Base have been organized into a
quick-response outfit called the Strategic
Projection Force, or SPIF. SPIF's slogan is
'' Anytime Anywhere.'' Training for Persian
Gulf missions has reached the point that a

full-dress exercise will be conducted soon.
"We do have the capability to launch a
strike to the Persian Gulf right out of here in
North Dakota," said Brig Gen. John Shaud.

make that trip from North Dakota to the
Gulf and back with only two mid-air refuel

That two presidents — Jimmy Carter and
Ronald Reagan — have reassigned some of
the B-52s formerly reserved for doomsday

oil dramatizes how priorities have changed

Also, the fact that Washington is once
again casting strategic 852s for tactical
bombing in a distant Third World nation in
dicates a fresh attempt to try to fine-tune
U.S. military responses to world crises.

Many 852s were transformed from their nu
clear role in the 1960s into carriers of the
iron bombs dropped on North and South
Vietnam.
Gen. Curtis LeMay complained back then
that the civilians' tit-for-tat use of air power
in Vietnam amounted to "swatting at flies
rather than hitting the manure pile." To
day, however, Air Force leaders are en
thusiastic about tightly controlled deploy
ment of their B-52s to make a point in a trou
bled area, with the Persian Gulf the focus.
Gen. Richard Ellis, commander of the
Strategic Air Command — a job LeMay held
in the glory days of big bombers — contends,
for example, that sending B-52s rather than
troops to the Gulf would widen the firebreak
between conventional and nuclear war.
"When you talk about Southwest Asia,"
Ellis said in an interview, "our chances of
stopping the Soviets on the land mass are ex
tremely limited. I think everybody under
stands that."
