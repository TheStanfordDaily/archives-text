## Gymnasts compete in conference meets 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's gymnastics teams fared re
spectably in their recent conference and re
gional meets and will be sending at least two
individuals to the upcoming national meets,
beginning Thursday with the NCAAs in Lin
coln, Nebraska.
At the Nor Cal Championships, held
March 20 at Fresno State, Jackie Walker's
Cardinals successfully defended their con
ference title, compiling a 139.20 point total.
Second place went to the host squad with
133.85 points while California and San Jose
State placed third and fourth with 130.80 and
115.55 points respectively.
Stanford's top performer, Merilyn Chap
man, captured the all-around crown with a
school record-setting 36.85 total and took
first in three of the four events. The Golden
Bears' Karen Kelsall, a former Olympic
gymnast for Canada, was the runner up with
34.70 points. Cards Anne Smith and Julie
Bledsoe placed fourth and fifth with 34.40
and 33.90.
In vaulting, Bledsoe earned second place
with an 8.95 average, followed by Chapman
with 8.90. That was the only event that Chap
man didn't dominate, as she won the other
three by healthy margins. On uneven par
allel bars, she earned a 9.35 score from the
judges, followed by teammate Karen Hall,
who tied for second with an 8.70 mark. Stan
ford had another one-two combination on
balance beam, with Chapman's 9.25 setting
the pace and Smith's 8.85 placing her sec
ond.
In floor exercise, Chapman rolled up an
other 9.35 tally. Kelsall took second with
8.90 and Card Caryn Lucido finished third at
8.65, her highest score on floor this season.
Based on a combination of averages from
that meet and the top four regular season
meets, Stanford was seeded sixth going into
the WAIAW regionals at Cal State-Fullerton
last weekend with a composite score of
137.75. The order of the top five seeds was:
UCLA with 148.25, Fullerton (146.60), Arizo
na State (145.50), USC 142.05) and San Diego
State (140.25).
Individually, UCLA's Sharon Shapiro,
last season's all-around champion and win
ner of all four events at the AIAW national

meet a year ago, was the top seed for re
gional with 38 15 points. Chapman was sev
enth with 36.20, followed by Bledsoe (19th,
34.60), Smith (23rd, 34.05), Jeanette Lacoste
(32nd, 32.30) and Lucido (35th, 31.65).
During the regional competition, Bledsoe
finished 12th in beam competition with 8.95
points, and Chapman was 12th on bars, sev
enth on beam and third on floor, earning a
medal for the latter event. In all-around,
Chapman's combined preliminary and final
score average of 36.3708 ranked her sixth
best in the region, leaving "no question of
qualifying for nationals," according to
Walker. Bledsoe's 34.4583 averge was 18th
best in th£ region, giving her a chance for
nationals, while Smith's 34.2458 gave her a
"slim chance."
As a team, Stanford ended up in the same
spot as their regional seeding, sixth in the
region with a 138.1038 average, putting the
Cards in the top 25 in the nation, but with
only 16 teams qualifying for the AIAW meet
at the University of Utah, April 10-11.
At the Pac-10 Championships (actually
Pac-8, since Oregon State and Washington
State do not field gymnastics teams), held
March 20-21 at Arizona State, Sadao
Hamada's squad finished fifth — no small
accomplishment when one realizes that
three of the top four squads are qualifying
for the NCAAs.
"As a team, we came in fifth with 496.20
points, 255.25 in optionals and 240.95 in com
pulsories," Hamada said. "I wasn't sure
whether we could beat Arizona or not. Last
year we came in after Arizona, but this
year, I guess they didn't practice com
pulsories too much, so we came in ahead of
them, finishing one spot higher than we did
last year.
"Our (optional) team score of 255 is about
average — what we have been scoring all
season, and 240.95 is about what I expected,
based on the intersquad meet . Overall,
without Jim (Campanelli) and Rich (Rosen
— both out most of this season with in
juries), I think we did pretty well as a
team," he added.
Although the Cards failed to qualify any
individuals into the Pac-10 finals, they will

be represented at this weekend's NCAAs by
junior Mike Lee on pommel horse Lee fin
ished 10th in all-around with a 105.00 total,
54 10 in optional routines and 50.90 in com
pulsories, earning him an alternate spot for
all-around competition at the Lincoln com
petiton.
"If I had worked harder on my com
pulsories, I would have had a better chance
of making nationals in all-around," Lee
said. "However, I'll have a year's ex
perience under my belt next time.
"I'm looking forward to the nationals — it
gives me a chance to see the top six guys
from every region. But I'm really looking
forward to next year, when we get all our
people healthy. We're losing some valuable
specialists, but if we work hard this sum
mer, we can make up for it,"he added.
Hamada, too, is looking ahead to next sea
son, especially with regards to the con
ference meet.
"I bid to have the Pac-10's here at Stan
ford, but I haven't gotten approval yet from
the Athletic Department," he said. "I think
that would be a very exciting meet — that
would be the weekend of March 11-13 when
school is still in session.
Being able to host the Pac-10 meet would
give the Cards the host-squad edge and
would serve as a springboard for a Stanford
run at the NCAAs.
"There is a home advantage — you're
used to the equipment and the atmosphere,
and that means less mistakes," Hamada ex
plained.
"We came in fifth this year, but next year
I'm hoping Jim and Rich will be back. I lose
some specialists — Craig (Goldman —
rings) and Bob Daniel (vaulting, rings), but
the main all-around men will still be here.
With them, plus my new recruits, I think we
can be in the top three in the Pac-10, so we
can aim for the NCAAs," he added.
The national meet includes ten squads,
with the top team from each region, plus six
at-large teams based on their averaged sea
son scores. This year, the Pac-10 will be rep
resented by UCLA, Oregon and Arizona
State, with California just missing an at
large berth.
