# Icemen take 3rd
## 
### David Wright 
The Stanford ice hockey club
traveled to Seattle over
spring break to play in the
Northwestern Intercollegiate
Hockey Championships and
came home with a third place
finish under their skates.
In their first game the
Gryphons were destroyed by the
tournament's eventual winner,
the University of British Colum
bia Fast Eddies, 11-3.
But after such a dismal start,
the team rebounded with vic
tories over Cal State-North
ridge and the University of
Washington, thus qualifying
them to be one of the finalists. It
was a seesaw battle against
Northridge until the third peri
od when the Gryphons, trailing
4-3 after two periods, exploded
with four goals to win the game
7-5. The line of Mike Militello,
David Grabb, and Mark Winters
accounted for five of the seven
Gryphon goals.
The game against Washing
ton was never in doubt as the
Gryphons got an early 2-0 lead
on goals by David Wright. The
team coasted to a 6-3 victory,
saving themselves for the
playoffs.
In the first semi-final game,
ÜBC beat Western Washington
University, 3-2. The other semi

final game featured Stanford
playing the Portland Col
legiates.
The Gryphons dominated the
game, outshooting Portland by
a 2:1 ratio. But hot goaltending
by the Portland netminder sent
the game into a sudden death ov
ertime with the score tied at
two. Stanford again dominated
in the overtime period, but the
Portland goalie was equal to the
task, stopping three break
aways. Portland s Molloy
scored his second goal of the
game to end the overtime and
Stanford's hopes.
Western Washington was the
next opponent for the Gryphons,
in the consolation final. The
Gryphons led all the way en
route to a 6-4 victory. Portland
went on to lose 11-0 to ÜBC in the
final game. British Columbia's
goalie Bill Jack was the tour
nament MVP while Stanford
players Paul Estey and Les
Landsberger were runners up.
The Gryphons now hold a
14-6-3 overall record and a 7-0-3
mark in the Northern California
Hockey League. The team needs
only a single victory in one of its
three remaining league games
to assure itself of first place.
The first of those games is
this Sunday at 9 p.m., at Bel
mont Iceland against San Jose.
