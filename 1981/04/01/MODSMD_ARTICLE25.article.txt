## Indiana lakes hoop final

Philadelphia (AP) —■ Bobby Knight can be ar
rogant and rude, haughty and unyielding,
scrupulously honest and principled to a fault. He
is also, indisputably, a brilliant basketball coach.
On a day marred by the shock and sadness of the
shooting of President Reagan, when serious con
sideration was given to postponing the game in
deference to the tragedy, Knight guided the Indi
ana Hoosers to the NCAA basketball cham
pionship with a marvelously orchestrated 63-50
victory over North Carolina Monday night.
Isiah Thomas, the Hoosiers' gifted sophomore
point guard, was voted the outstanding player of
the tournament after scoring 19 of his 23 points in
the second half. But although Thomas wore the
ceremonial net around his neck after the game.
Knight was the star of the show.
After North Carolina jumped in front 16-8 in the
first 10 minutes, Knight made the key strategic
move of the game. He switched six-foot-six sw

ingman Randy Wittman from guard to forward to
replace the foul-plagued Ted Kitchel and brought
guard Jim Thomas off the bench, going with a
three-guard offense and putting Jim Thomas on
North Carolina scoring star A 1 Wood.
"We had trouble getting out" game started," ex
plained Knight. "I really thought the crucial point
came when it was 16-8. Carolina had a chance to
take us out of the game, but our kids did a heck of a
job hanging in."
North Carolina led for 19:59 of the first half, but
Indiana regrouped behind its three-guard offense
and finally took the lead 27-26 on Wittman's
jumper from the right corner at the halftime
buzzer.
"I think the most important play of the whole
ballgame was the shot Randy hit at the end of the
half," said Isiah Thomas. "It gave us momentum,
got us on the right track. And we took it from
there."
