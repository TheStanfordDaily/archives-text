# Card nine blanks Oregon
## 
### Steve Odell 
The Stanford men's baseball
team, perhaps seeking revenge
on anybody handy after being
swept by Arizona State last
weekend, picked the Oregon
Ducks to beat up on, rolling to an
easy 12-0 win yesterday at
Sunken Diamond. The Cards
scored all their runs in the first
four innings, and coasted after
that.
"I figure we'd come back and
play well," stated Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess, "and we
did. It was a good effort."
The big guns in the Stanford
arsenal were John Elway, who
had a two-run homer; desig
nated hitter Bob Hausiaden,
who went a perfect three-for
three at the plate; and Mike
Aldrete, who rapped out three
hits in five at bats on the after
noon.
Freshman John Radtke
picked up the win, throwing five
strong innings of scoreless ball.
He was relieved by Steve Cot
trell, who came on in relief and
pitched the next three frames,
and Elway came in from his
rightfield position to throw the
final goose egg in the ninth to
complete the shutout.
Will Elway's presence on the
mound be a regular occurence?
Marquess says no. "We'll only
use him when we need a couple
outs in the ninth, or a situation
similar to that. He's not going to
come in and pitch two or three
innings for us or anything. "
"We just tried it today," the
coach went on, "to see how it
went — and he did well."
The Cards' next game is *his
afternoon against UC-Riv
erside, a tough Division Two
school ranked in the top ten.
"They're a real solid team,"
Marquess praised. "And they'll
be a good test for us. I just hope
it doesn't rain."
