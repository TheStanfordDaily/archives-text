Stanford University hosted its first-ever women's national team
championship last Friday and Saturday when the 1981 AIAW Na
tional Synchronized Swimming Championships were held at de-
Guerre Pool Complex.
Stanford fared about as expected, coming into the championships
ranked fourth, and finishing in that spot, tallying 14 points. Defend
ing co-champion Arizona took the title with 71 markers, while four
time defending team titlist Ohio State came in second with 58
points.
The competition was composed of five categories — solo, duet,
trio, compulsory figure, and team events — and the Buckeyes and
Wildcats dominated, taking at least the top two spots in every one.
The Cards were led by All-America Jane Goeppinger, a former
U.S. National Team member who also particapted in the 1978 World
Games in Berlin. Goeppinger teamed up with Fay Dufner and Robin
Ikeda to capture seventh place in the trio competition with a score
of 51.30.
Sabrina Smith also performed well for Stanford, picking up two
fourth places —one in the solo, and another in the duet, along with
Ikeda. The Cards plugged in at number six in the team category
competition, scoring 55.10, while Ohio State topped the event with a
mark of 60.70.
The championships gave Bay Area fans a chance to see quite a
few familiar faces, having a definite local flavor regarding some of
the outstanding individuals in the competition. All-Americas Tara
Cameron!Ohio State)* Pam Tryon (Arizona), and Goeepinger all
hail from the area — Cameron from San Mateo. Tryon from San
Jose, and Goeppinger from the Santa Clara area.
Cameron, the duet and trio routine national champion last sea
son, ended up in a deadlock for first place in the solo event with
Tryon, with both scoring 58.80. She also came in second in the fig
ures.
A former member of the Santa Clara Swim Club and the defend
ing AIAW solo champion. Tryon also won the trio competition and
was the main component in Arizona's victory.
Alas, besides being the first AIAW national championship held
here at Stanford, it will inevitably be the last, as women's collegiate
sports are being incorporated into the NCAA.
