# Survival record broken in transplant operation
## 
### Jan Mireles 
Heart-lung transplant patient Mary
Gohlke is reported in critical but
stable condition 24 days after the
surgery which gave her a new heart
and lungs.
The longest previous human sur
vival time after heart-lung transplant
surgery was 23 days after an operation
performed 10 years ago.
Despite a setback two weeks after
her March 9 surgery, Gohlke's
progress has been described as
"steady."
On March 10, Gohlke was breathing
without the aid of a respirator and was
able to sit up in bed. Six days later she
was walking for short spells and sit
ting up in a chair briefly. By March 19,
she began eating soft food.
In a press statement issued March
17, Dr. Bruce Reitz expressed op
timism about Gohlke.
"We are pleased with the progress
that Mrs. Gohlke has made ... the re
covery has been a little slow, but it has
been steady," said Reitz.
Doctors then began weekly heart
biopsies to check for any signs of re
jection.
A heart biopsy involves inserting a
wire-like tube with small snips at the
end into the jugular vein and down to
the heart. A small sample is extracted
and tested for possible traces of rejec
tion.
On March 23, Gohlke was put back
on the respirator. A combination of
fluid in her lungs and the very early
stages of rejection were making
breathing difficult.
To control rejection, doctors gave
Gohlke antihuman thymocyte
globulin, and a steroid to suppress re
jection, in addition to Cyclosporin A
and Imuran, the anti-rejection drugs
she had received since surgery.
Two days later, Reitz reported the
episode as "resolving." Much of the
water in the lungs had been eliminated
and a heart biopsy revealed that rejec
tion of the heart and lungs was weak
ened and under control. Treatment re
vertd to the Cyclosporin A and Imuran

originally administered.
Gohlke is back on a liquid diet and
spends most of her time resting. She is
visited regularly by her husband and
mother who is renting an apartment in
Oak Creek.
Because she is the first patient to
survive a transplant for more than 23
days, doctors say it is difficult to esti
mate the length of Gohlke's stay. A
major consideration is the rate at
which the severed windpipe heals.
Gohlke is reported to be healing
steadily, yet she is expected to remain
at the Medical Center for at least two
months.
In the meantime, Charles Walker, a
Binghamton, New York, resident will
arrive today for a series of evaluations
to determine his potential as a second
heart-lung transplant recipient.
