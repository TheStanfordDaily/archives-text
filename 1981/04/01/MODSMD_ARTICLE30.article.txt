Brady progessing, fate unsure
Washington — White House press secretary
James Brady, gravely wounded in an assassina
tion attempt against President Ronald Reagan,
is making "extraordinary progress" and proba
bly will live despite extensive bullet damage to
the right side of his brain, doctors said yester
day.
Brady, 40, the father of a 2-year-old son and a
college-age daughter, was shot Monday after
noon a few feet from President Reagan. A 22-
caliber bullet entered his forehead at the temple
and came to rest in the right rear portion of the
skull, from which it was removed intact.
Brady underwent nearly five hours of surgery
in which surgeons used a microscope to assess
the extent of brain damage and removed ir
reparably damaged bits of tissue and bone, Dr
Dennis O'Leary, chief of clinical affairs at
George Washington University Hospital, said
O'Leary said Brady could move his limbs on
the right side of the body — which is controlled
by the left half of his brain — on command from
his doctors.
Military drills end in Poland
Warsaw, Poland — Soviet bloc military ma
neuvers in and around Poland were reported
winding down yesterday as another labor-gov
ernment confrontation eased. The government
promised to punish those responsible for beating
union leaders and the independent union called
off a general strike threatened for yesterday.
Sources here confirmed reports out of NATO

headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, that the 2-
week-old East bloc exercises were over, al
though the facilities used in the exercises were
still in place. The exercises were watched close
ly in the West for any sign of Soviet intervention
in Poland.
"Common sense and moderation have won,"
said Solidarity leader Lech Walesa after he and
Deputy Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski nego
tiated an agreement Monday. Walesa said he
was satisfied with "70 percent of the agree
ment."
This latest and possibly the most serious dis
pute between Solidarity and Poland's Com
munist Party resulted from the government's
first use of force since the independent labor
movement won legalization during the na
tionwide strike wave last summer.
Allies urge arms control talks
Brussels, Belgium — The United States as
sured its restive NATO allies yesterday that it
would launch a new round of arms control talks
with the Soviet Union, but did not forecast any
dates or timetable.
Lawrence Eagleburger. the U.S. assistant
secretary of state for European affairs, was
chairman of the meeting at NATO head
quarters, which was attended by arms control
experts from most of the NATO members. It
was called at the urging of the Europeans, who
have become increasingly concerned that the
Reagan administration in pushing increases in
defense spending, but so far has paid little atten
tion to arms control.

As the Europeans made clear to Eagleburger
in the day-long meeting, it will be difficult to
maintain public and political support for the
deployment of the new nuclear weapons unless a
realistic effort at arms negotiation with the So
viet Union gets under way soon.
FBI reports higher crime rate
Washington — The national rate of reported
crime increased 10 percent last year, spurred by
a 13 percent jump in violent offenses, the FBI
said yesterday.
FBI Director William Webster said that the
year-to-year increase was the most significant
since 1975, when the incidence of serious crime
also climbed 10 percent.
By coincidence, the annual report was issued
just a day after the attempted assassination of
President Ronald Reagan. It had been made
available to the press several days ago for re
lease in newspapers yesterday.
A large factor in the violent crime increase
was a 20 percent gain in robberies, which was
recorded in both large and small cities and in ur
ban and rurai areas.
'Ordinary People' best picture
Hollywood — Sissy Spacek, Robert DeNiro
and Ordinary People won top honors last night at
the 53rd annual Academy Awards ceremonies.
DeNiro was honored as best actor in a starring
role for his performance in the title role of Rag
inn Bull, Spacek won the Oscar for best actress
for her portrayal of country-western singer

Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner's Daughter.
The awards for best supporting role per
formances went to Mary Steenburgen for her
performance as Melvin Dummar's kooky first
wife in Melvin and Howard, and to Timothy
Hutton as the troubled son in Ordinary People.
"Robert Redford, making his behind-the-cam
era debut, won the Oscar as best director for Or
dinary People, and was called back to the stage
to share producer Ronald Schwary's moment of
glory when the film won the award as best pic
ture.
Johnny Carson, acting as master of ceremo
nies for the third year, opened the show — which
had been postponed 24 hours because of the at
tempted assassination of President Ronald Rea
gan — and drew cheers when he told the au
dience the president was feeling much better.
