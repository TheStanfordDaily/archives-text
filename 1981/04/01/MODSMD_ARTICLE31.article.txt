# Mother of Atlanta victim exposes inconsistencies
## 
### Monika Guttman 
Angela Taylor, the mother of one of
the 22 children murdered in Atlanta,
said she was deeply troubled when she
heard that another child had been
found dead in Atlanta Monday — and
the television news did not even men
tion it.
"And I think that's more important
than the president's successful opera
tion."
An overflow crowd in Terman
Auditorium applauded Taylor's words
at last night's public forum on racist
violence, which was sponsored by the
Black Student's Union (BSU). Taylor
appeared along with Willie Mae
Math is. also a mother of one of the
murdered children. She expressed
frustration and anger at media cov
erage and official response to the ran
dom killing of young children in the
Georgia city since July of 1979.
"Had it been white kids, or rich up
per class blacks, there wouldn't have

been 22 children killed before they
finally did something,'' said Taylor.
"It would have stopped at two."
"There's got to be a leakage within
the police department to the killers,"
she said. "There're four marked po
lice cars missing. . . but you're not
going to read about that in the press."
Taylor said that the press is reluc
tant to print anything "because they
don't want to start anything.
"But it's already started. The me
dia knows about it, but it refuses to
print it."
The press was also not reporting the
fact that nine of the boys found had
mutilated sexual organs surrounded
by needle marks, according to Taylor.
"And in the blood stream of these
boys they found a drug which is only
used for experimental purposes,
which is only obtainable by
pathologists and morticians. Bet you
didn't read about that," she said.
Also a 14-year-old white girl was

found strangled where she lived in a
poorer black neighborhood, Taylor
said.
"But they said that she was just a
runaway, so you don't read (about) it
in the papers," Taylor said.
Mathis said she felt that political
and media reaction have been slow for
various political reasons.
"Atlanta is a convention city. If peo
ple thought it was not safe, then no
conventions would be held there, and
goodby money. Thus the areas where
the children have disappeared have
been portrayed as 'slum areas,' when
in fact they all aren't. Andrew Young
lived three blocks from me," she said.
Both women said that the informa
tion which was being released was not
correct. For instance most of the pa
rents of the kids are portrayed as
being mothers on welfare, Taylor
said.
"But I'm not on welfare, and 13 or 14
of the affected families have two

working parents," she said.
"These children were portrayed as
'street kids'," said Mathis. "Actually,
five of them were academically
gifted. And when my son disappeared,
he was walking one block to buy me a
pack of cigaretts. He was a cub scout,
and very active in the church. That
hardly qualifies him as a 'street kid.' "
Mathis said that Atlanta's black
mayor, Maynard Jackson, was the one
responsible for spreading the stories
about "street kids."
"Jackson is, whether you know it or
not, an oreo cookie. But now the city
government is so ashamed for having
dragged its feet that they're trying to
make up for it," she said.
Both Taylor and Mathis were solic
iting funds for a summer camp fund
for Atlanta children. Their goal is to
be able to send over 2000 young chil
dren out of Atlanta to summer camps
so that "more attention can be focused

on watching the kids that remain.
"When you walk through Atlanta
you wonder, 'where are all the kids?,'
and they're all in the house. But you
can't stay in the house all the time dur
ing the summer. . . it's too hot," Tay
lor said.
Mathis added that hopefully getting
out of Atlanta would reduce some of
the psychological strain the children
suffer.
"My 14-year-old has to undergo psy
chological treatment since my other
son was found (dead) Feb. 13th of this
year. And my nine-year-old daughter
is so scared at night that she can't
sleep unless she's with me," she said.
Both Taylor and Mathis said that
"this is a time to unite and stand up as
a whole. The community has to be
come aware, come together and solve
this problem, which is not just happen
ing in Atlanta, but everywhere across
the nation."

suffer.
"My 14-year-old has to undergo psy
chological treatment since my other
son was found (dead) Feb. 13th of this
year. And my nine-year-old daughter
is so scared at night that she can't
sleep unless she's with me," she said.
Both Taylor and Mathis said that
"this is a time to unite and stand up as
a whole. The community has to be
come aware, come together and solve
this problem, which is not just happen
ing in Atlanta, but everywhere across
the nation."
Angela Taylor, the mother of one of
the 22 children murdered in Atlanta,
said she was deeply troubled when she
heard that another child had been
found dead in Atlanta Monday — and
the television news did not even men
tion it.
"And I think that's more important
than the president's successful opera
tion."
An overflow crowd in Terman
Auditorium applauded Taylor's words
at last night's public forum on racist
violence, which was sponsored by the
Black Student's Union (BSU). Taylor
appeared along with Willie Mae
Math is. also a mother of one of the
murdered children. She expressed
frustration and anger at media cov
erage and official response to the ran
dom killing of young children in the
Georgia city since July of 1979.
"Had it been white kids, or rich up
per class blacks, there wouldn't have

been 22 children killed before they
finally did something,'' said Taylor.
"It would have stopped at two."
"There's got to be a leakage within
the police department to the killers,"
she said. "There're four marked po
lice cars missing. . . but you're not
going to read about that in the press."
Taylor said that the press is reluc
tant to print anything "because they
don't want to start anything.
"But it's already started. The me
dia knows about it, but it refuses to
print it."
The press was also not reporting the
fact that nine of the boys found had
mutilated sexual organs surrounded
by needle marks, according to Taylor.
"And in the blood stream of these
boys they found a drug which is only
used for experimental purposes,
which is only obtainable by
pathologists and morticians. Bet you
didn't read about that," she said.
Also a 14-year-old white girl was

found strangled where she lived in a
poorer black neighborhood, Taylor
said.
"But they said that she was just a
runaway, so you don't read (about) it
in the papers," Taylor said.
Mathis said she felt that political
and media reaction have been slow for
various political reasons.
"Atlanta is a convention city. If peo
ple thought it was not safe, then no
conventions would be held there, and
goodby money. Thus the areas where
the children have disappeared have
been portrayed as 'slum areas,' when
in fact they all aren't. Andrew Young
lived three blocks from me," she said.
Both women said that the informa
tion which was being released was not
correct. For instance most of the pa
rents of the kids are portrayed as
being mothers on welfare, Taylor
said.
"But I'm not on welfare, and 13 or 14
of the affected families have two

working parents," she said.
"These children were portrayed as
'street kids'," said Mathis. "Actually,
five of them were academically
gifted. And when my son disappeared,
he was walking one block to buy me a
pack of cigaretts. He was a cub scout,
and very active in the church. That
hardly qualifies him as a 'street kid.' "
Mathis said that Atlanta's black
mayor, Maynard Jackson, was the one
responsible for spreading the stories
about "street kids."
"Jackson is, whether you know it or
not, an oreo cookie. But now the city
government is so ashamed for having
dragged its feet that they're trying to
make up for it," she said.
Both Taylor and Mathis were solic
iting funds for a summer camp fund
for Atlanta children. Their goal is to
be able to send over 2000 young chil
dren out of Atlanta to summer camps
so that "more attention can be focused

on watching the kids that remain.
"When you walk through Atlanta
you wonder, 'where are all the kids?,'
and they're all in the house. But you
can't stay in the house all the time dur
ing the summer. . . it's too hot," Tay
lor said.
Mathis added that hopefully getting
out of Atlanta would reduce some of
the psychological strain the children
suffer.
