# Anderson asks for social responsibility
## 
### Samuel Howe 
ASSU Guest Professor John An
derson took his own "national agenda
for the '80s" before an overflow crowd
in Kresge Auditorium last night, tell
ing his listeners that the agenda must
be based on twin themes of "sacri
fice'' and "thoughtful, long-term plan
ning which we (have) failed to do in
the past."
The former independent presiden
tial candidate alluded several times to
the national government s obligation
to serve the American people. "Re
form is not the abandonment of the
federal role or responsibility" in such
matters as fair housing laws and mass
transportation, Anderson said. "I do
not think that at the federal level we
can wash our hands of that kind of re
sponsibility."
Anderson said his remarks were in
response to the surge of conservative
ideology on the political scene and the
election of conservatives to office, in
cluding that of Ronald Reagan to the
presidency.
"This administration has adopted

the premise that we can meet prob
lems by shrinking the size of the gov
ernment, and by removing responsi
bilities . . I disagree."
Anderson opened his remarks by
ruing the fact that "as Stanford goes,
so does not go the nation." He was re
ferring to the mock election which he
won here last fall, a week before the
national election in which he received
approximately 7 percent of the vote.
However, he twice joked about the
possibility of a run for the presidency
in 1984. and at one point in response to
a direct request from a listener to at
tempt one, he said, "We'll think about
that.''
The guest professor said that he did
not think his independent candidacy
had been in vain, proclaiming with a
grin that "I have concluded that the
speeches I have made had such a pow
erful impact on the nation that it
would be a shame for me to deny the
speeches to the country today."
Although Anderson said he deeply
regretted Monday's assassination at
tempt on the president and that he was

"relieved that the president has been
spared and will have the health and
strength he will need to guide the des
tiny of the nation," he attacked Rea
gan's "zeal for devolution."
The proposed government funding
cuts "have a far greater significance
than merely budgetary," he said. He
criticized budget director David
Stockman's recent assertion that the
government has "no obligation" to
provide such services as low-cost
housing, psychiatric care and legal
aid
"I submit that there can be great
unifying principles (for) this country,
but they are rarely self-executing,"
Anderson said, calling on the govern
ment to help citizens help themselves
Anderson called also for leadership
from the federal government on
energy issues, saying he doubted the
country can "produce its way out of
the crisis," as Reagan has suggested,
and must follow "a plan, a better plan
than we've constructed so far."
Although Anderson contained
almost all his remarks to domestic is

sues, he did say that in the interna
tional arena, the United States will
"risk losing the support of our allies if
we rely on military might. We won't
do it by simply continuing the arms
race while 150 million people on the
African continent are on the edge of
starvation."
Anderson said that he did not be
lieve the American people could ever
"have it both ways, guns and butter"
as he said President Lyndon Johnson
attempted in the 1960s while trying to
both fight the Vietnam war and launch
the "Great Society" programs at the
same time. He suggested that his
"agenda" placed a higher priority on
social programs and international aid
than on increases in the U.S. military
budget.
The retired 10-term congressman is
on the Stanford campus this spring to
teach two classes in political science
and take part in a number of speaking
engagements His opening address to
the University community was spon
sored by SCOPE, the Stanford Com
mittee on Political Education.

cess in the future.

ASSU Guest Professor John An
derson took his own "national agenda
for the '80s" before an overflow crowd
in Kresge Auditorium last night, tell
ing his listeners that the agenda must
be based on twin themes of "sacri
fice'' and "thoughtful, long-term plan
ning which we (have) failed to do in
the past."
The former independent presiden
tial candidate alluded several times to
the national government s obligation
to serve the American people. "Re
form is not the abandonment of the
federal role or responsibility" in such
matters as fair housing laws and mass
transportation, Anderson said. "I do
not think that at the federal level we
can wash our hands of that kind of re
sponsibility."
Anderson said his remarks were in
response to the surge of conservative
ideology on the political scene and the
election of conservatives to office, in
cluding that of Ronald Reagan to the
presidency.
"This administration has adopted

the premise that we can meet prob
lems by shrinking the size of the gov
ernment, and by removing responsi
bilities . . I disagree."
Anderson opened his remarks by
ruing the fact that "as Stanford goes,
so does not go the nation." He was re
ferring to the mock election which he
won here last fall, a week before the
national election in which he received
approximately 7 percent of the vote.
However, he twice joked about the
possibility of a run for the presidency
in 1984. and at one point in response to
a direct request from a listener to at
tempt one, he said, "We'll think about
that.''
The guest professor said that he did
not think his independent candidacy
had been in vain, proclaiming with a
grin that "I have concluded that the
speeches I have made had such a pow
erful impact on the nation that it
would be a shame for me to deny the
speeches to the country today."

regretted Monday's assassination at
