# Shooting creates confusion
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — For a few
hours, as President Ronald Reagan
lay under the surgeon's knife, there
appeared to be confusion. Who's run
ning the country?
Was it Reagan, because no effort
was made to suspend his authority?
Was it Vice President George Bush,
because Reagan was unconscious in
the operating room and hardly able to
exercise the presidency? Or was it
Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
several heartbeats from authority,
but actually at the White House, pre
siding — as senior Cabinet officer —
over the Cabinet meeting convened
during the crisis of attempted as
sassination.
There was no confusion yesterday,
however. Bush was standing in for
Reagan at meetings with the Cabinet
and congressional leaders and at a
working lunch with the prime minister
of the Netherlands.
Doctors said Reagan, listed in
"stable and good" condition after
surgery to remove a bullet from his
left lung, could resume command of
the nation from his hospital bed.
Asked Monday night who was com
mander in chief, deputy White House
press secretary Larry Speakes re
plied: "The president is the com
mander in chief." but that didn't seem
so clear in the harried hours after the
shooting Monday
Bush was in Texas, trying to sell
Reagan's economic program Secre
tary of State Alexander Haig and most
of the other senior government of
ficials were in Washington
Haig went quickly to the White
House and told reporters: "As of now,
I am in control in the White House
pending the return of the vice presi
dent."
Speakes and David Gergen, the
White House staff director, refused to
be drawn into a discussion of whether
Haig was overreaching his authority
in appearing to take charge at the
White House.
Asked whether there was any dis
cission among top administration of
ficials after the shooting about wheth
er to invoke the presidential disability
provisions of the 25th Amendment to
the Constitution, Speakes answered:
"There was really no need for it.
The information we were getting was
optimistic almost from the first."
He added there had been''no cause''
for the president to turn over any of his
authority to Bush.
In saying that he was in control,
Haig told reporters that "constitu
tionally, you have the president, vice
president and secretary of state, in
that order."
Actually, according to the Constitu
tion, the order of succession is the vice
president, the speaker of the House,
the president pro tem of the Senate
and then the secretary of state.
Just last week, the secretary of
state made it clear he was displeased
with Reagan's decision to place Bush
rather than Haig in charge of crisis
management.
Speakes said Haig, a former White
House chief of staff under Richard
Nixon, was "informally helping to co
ordinate activities" after Reagan was
shot.
"We were all very appreciative that
he was here," Gergen said.
