## Greater computer access seen for future students 
### David Gleba 
Within the next three years.
Stanford's extensive computer
resources will witness signifi
cant change. The hundreds of
computers on campus will be in
terconnected by means of an
electronic network, an aggrega
tion which will greatly enhance
the capabilities of Stanford's
computer resources.
Furthermore, a heavier em
phasis will be placed on com
munications and information
access rather than the tradi
tional purely scientific role of
computers.
The most immediate plans
concern easing overload prob
lems at LOTS, the under
graduate computer facility.
"We will, this spring, make
some portion of the 3033's < Stan
ford s major computer systemÂ»
available in the LOTS service
mode, probably at CERAS." ex
plained Edward Shaw, director

of Stanford's Center tor In
formation Technology iCIT).
The University is also plan
ning to wire each room in the
new dorm complex to facilitate
future computer use. Norm
Robinson, associate dean to res
idential education, predicted
that computers in dorm rooms
are well within the "realm of
possibility," and that the new
dorm complex will be built to
"make sure that we will have
that capability.''
Ralph Gorin. director of
LOTS, noted that "over the
course of the next few years
computers in dorms will be
quite likely."
Stanford is also considering
leasing computer terminals to
students next year. Shaw stated
that, "It would be possible, if
students had their own money,
to essentially put a terminal, at
a student's request, in every
room on the campus.'' Each ter
minal would be connected to a
computer facility via the room's
existing telephone line.
The establishment of a cam
pus-wide computer network will
"provide the capability to have
terminals scattered about cam
pus." according to Gorin
Shaw described the existing
multitude of separate and
diverse computers as a "com
puterized Tower of Babel.' in
which each computer "speaks a
different language.'' Shaw as
serted that connecting all of
these very different systems
poses a "very great challenge."
Shaw stated that networking
will result in "greater and
greater capabilities in the
user's hands." These
capabilities may include an
electronic mail system (already
in effect tor top University ad
ministrators). a text-processing
svstem and access to the library

catalog via computer.
Looking toward the future.
Gorin mentioned that it is rapid
ly "becoming more practical to
store books in a computer rath
er than on a shelf.'
Given these developments, it
is very possible that within the
next three years, a Stanford stu
dent could sit down at a termi
nal in his dorm room, create a
term paper using a text process
ing system, check the library
computer for bibliographic cita
tions. have yet another system
review the paper for spelling er
rors. and finally have the paper
produced on a typewriter-qual
ity printer
Shaw concluded that the
future computer expansion of
Stanford's computer facilities
will be driven by the demands of
the faculty, students and staff.
