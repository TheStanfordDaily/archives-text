An application of digital com
puters that has received con
siderable attention at Stanford
is artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence is the
part of computer science that
uses programming techniques
to produce what is considered
intelligent activity. Re
searchers developing these in
telligent systems work from the
accepted premise that in
telligence can be sufficiently
simulated by processing sym
bols. such as words, sentences
and mathematical formulae.
The artificial intelligence
laboratory at Stanford has
spawned a variety of expert sys
tems that are currently being
used in fields as diverse as med
icine, engineering, and corn

puter science itself.
Generally, an expert system
is a computer program, or col
lection of programs, that "con
verses" with an individual and
gives advice, draws con
clusions, and makes diagnoses.
One such system is the in
teractive MYCIN program, cur
rently in use at the Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine,
which diagnoses infectious dis
eases, prescribes treatment,
and explains its conclusions.
The ability of the system to
explain its reasoning is essen
tial in determining the correct
ness of its conclusions. That
way, the doctor using the sys
tem may ask the computer
questions to determine how it
made its diagnosis.
If he feels that the system has

reached an incorrect con
clusion, the doctor can correct
the system and. in effect, teach
the system a new reasoning
step.
The SACON program, anoth
er system, acts as a consultant
to structural engineersto assist
them in using a complex struc
tural simulation program.
This system was constructed
trom EMYCIN, which is a
skeletal version of MYCIN.
The EMYCIN program con
tains the control structure of an
intelligent system but without
the knowledge base.
* The successful implementa
tion of SACON from this general
program is especially impor
tant because it demonstrates
that the technology of these con
sultation systems may be ex
tended to fields beyond medi

cine and engineering: re
searchers at the artificial in
telligence laboratory have used
this technology to produce a sys
tem that is an expert in creating
expert systems.
This program, called RLL,
enables the user to create a lan
guage that will represent the in
formation in a particular knowl
edge base so that it will be un
derstandable to an intelligent
system.
The majority of expert sys
tems produced to date are rule
based systems. This means they
rely on a large number of "if
then" rules and heuristic pro
gramming techniques to engage
in intelligent activity.
But Michael Genesereth. pro
fessor of computer science at
Stanford, is currently re
searching a divergent tech

nique, that of giving an in
telligent system deep, theo
retical knowledge.
His particular application is
the development of a system
that will be able to "debug," or
detect faults in, a computer.
The system will rely upon the
oretical knowledge of the struc
ture and function of digital com
puters.
Other foci of research include
intelligent robotics, computer
vision and learning.
In the field of learning,
Douglas Lenat, professor of
computer science at Stanford,
has developed a program which
is an exper.t in mathematics.
His program is able to make
conjectures and invent new con
cepts
