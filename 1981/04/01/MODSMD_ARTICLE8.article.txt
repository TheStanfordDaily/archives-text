# NASA offers automated water treatment system
## 
### 
In an experimental waste
water treatment plant in Palo
Alto, NASA has been working
with the Santa Clara Valley Wa
ter District, the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Cali
fornia Department of Water Re
sources using a system of auto
matic water quality monitoring
that is quick, efficient and re
quires almost no human in
tervention.
Although the recycled water
is not piped into homes, it is
clean enough to be returned to
the San Francisco Bay without
harm to sea life. According to
NASA project manager Ken
Nishioka, the water may be
"cleaner than tap water," but
studies still must be done to de
termine the long-term effects, if
any, of drinking it.
Automated water quality
monitoring, defined as the abili
ty to obtain desired water quali
ty data without human interven
tion, offers continuous unat
tended operation of sensors
which analyze a flowing sample
stream. Samples are con
tinuously collected and
analyzed, and immediate re
sults are available.
NASA's automated system
consists of a computer and a
number of instruments de

signed to sense the presense of
bacteria. Operational instru
ments include an automated
twin-column gas chromato
graph developed at NASA's
Ames Research Center, an auto
mated coliform sensor and an
automated biomass detector.
The project began in 1974 at
NASA's Johnson Space Center,
Houston, when NASA, the De
partment of Housing and Urban
Development and the EPA set
out to plan the total use of waste
products from a large apart
ment complex or small city.
A panel of experts de
termined the biological,
chemical and physical qualities
which would have to be meas
ured for purification of waste
water.
Design and assembly of the
automated water quality
monitoring system to meet
these parameters was com
pleted at the Johnson Space Cen
ter. The system was tested in
Houston's Southwest Waste
water Treatment Facility.
When Santa Clara Valley Wa
ter District officials heard
about the system, they asked to
have it transferred to the ex
perimental water reclamation
plant in Palo Alto.
