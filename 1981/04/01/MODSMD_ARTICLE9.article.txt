# Industry grows as home computers become a reality
## 
### Chris Rogers 
Every home should have one .
a computer that is. This is what
the computer industry - manu
facturers and retailers both -
see as the next step in the life
history of the computer.
Even now computer systems
have become smaller, more
compact and comparitively less
expensive than their forebears,
according to the publicity hand
outs of Apple Computers Inc.
and Atari, two major computer
manufacturers.
"These home computers
would be able to work as a rec
ord store or inventory of house
hold items such as clothes, or
maintain a log of recipes or ad
dresses." said a Computerland
employee. They would also un
dertake household accounts and
calculations and even write
those letters you always mean
to get around to. according to
employees. "These systems
would probably operate from a
terminal in each home as part of
a network of iarge computers
with one s personal memory
bank." he explained. According
to Apple, they would operate as
a self-supporting unit with a
central link-up if necessary that
would tap information banks.
Hank Gay of Triad Systems
Corp. agrees with this con
sensus but warns that the home
terminal is a few years away,

perhaps ten. 'The future is
bright." he says. "At the mo
ment there are two areas of
computer development: home
computers - mainly games and
toys - and business computers -
mainly for accounting and
strategic uses."
The current generation of
computers has come into the
cost-effective range of small
businesses, according to Apple
and Atari. Gay believes that this
now means that small busi
nesses have the same strategic
advantage afforded by com
puters as large concerns do.
Apple Computers claim that
they can provide a complete
system from around $2300 up to
$8000, depending on client re
quirements. Atari market a
basic personal computer at
$499.95, according to their retail
price list. That, of course, is
before the necessary ac
cessories or - iii computer
jargon - "peripherals and soft
ware" are added.
The revolution in computers
began in June 1977 when Apple
delivered the first system that
could be "unboxed, plugged in
and used immediately , the Ap
ple II," according to Apple in
formation releases. This sys
tem, "self contained in a single
case, providing color and sound,
and looking like a typewriter
(instead of a laboratory con

sole)" according to Apple,
brought a new class of users into
the personal computer market
place.
This took computers "out of
the hands of enthusiasts and
electricians and into the realm
of people who had limited tech
nical knowledge, says one Com
puterland employee. Computer
manufacturers who had not for
seen this development sank," he
said In the words of Apple, "as
Apple's star rose other com
panies jumped on the
bandwagon."
When people realized that
computers were advantageous
tools for their personal use they
began seeking further means of
using computers to undertake
more tasks. This meant new
"software" tools - the informa
tional and communicative part
of the system, also known as
computer programs.
Gay believes that the in
dustry's ability to look ahead
and the fact that it is moving
forward guarantees its sur
vival. He also believes that the
computer industry "is the first
to feel the effects of recession
because cost justification is dif
ficult."
"When times are good, the
salesmen don't have to justify
cost effect; but when times are
bad, the customers need justifi
cation," he said.

Demand is high, according to
Gay and the employee of Com
puterland. It is mostly in
terpretive systems that are sell
ing at the moment, said the lat
ter. He cited Apple as most pop
ular, followed by TRS 80 and
Atari. He added that most
clients are business men or ex
ecutives from 25 to 55 years who
are looking for personal accoun
ting systems - the "strategic
tools," according to Gay.
Apple claims that their com
puters can be used as word proc
essors, stockbrokers, scientific
research tools, artistic com
posers - for which Todd Rungren
utilizes them - and educational
teachers.
Atari, who are most common
ly known for their video games,
also market software systems
that analyse financial situation,
maintain inventory, prQvide in
formation from larger data
bases, educate the whole family
and will plot your horoscope or
chart your bio-rhythms, accord
ing to their information re
sources.
We encounter computers all
the time, says Gay. When we
make a purchase at the local de
partment store the computer
based cash register processes
the bill; in the library books can
be located by computer search;
the Stanford Daily reporters
and editors utilize the VDT sys

tem. Space Invaders respond to
the circuitry of computerisa
tion; College Admission stores
information on students.
But as the computer does
more the greatest problem be
comes larger, according to Gay.
This is the reduction of jobs for
humans as the computej al
leviates the necessity and cost
effectiveness of human labor.
Gay believes that this is the
single most important problem
facing society and computers.
"10-15 percent of gross sales
goes into research," says Gay.
He believes that some of this
should possibly go toward train
ing people to create work for
themselves and for that work to
be creative. He says, "Humans
without some work or task are
directionless," and hopes that
invention and direction can be
instilled and nurtured in people.
As for the future. Gay be
lieves that computer develop
ment will lead to robotics. "The
potential for robots is
enormous," he says, "notably in
medicine." Already, according
to Gay, the Japanese have de
veloped automated industry.
And in this country General Mo
tors and Ford are investing in
robot systems. This is because
"these systems provide consis
tent quality that cannot be guar
anteed with human labor." ex
plains Gay.
