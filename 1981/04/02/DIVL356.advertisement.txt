ADVENTURE
Some graduates like routine assignments. Others prefer technological
adventuring at, or beyond, the limits of the current state-of-the-art.
We would like to talk to the Adventurers
Here's why. Our basic and applied research is in areas such as:
high-energy laser optics, infrared electro-optical systems, fiber optics,
lasers; materials processing; solid state electronics; energy conversion;
materials technology; gas turbine technology, fluid dynamics, emissions,
combustion, noise, controls; V/STOL technology; manufacturing
technology; ramjet and rocket technology; industrial and military systems
analysis; computer sciences; scientific and commercial programming;
instrument research, design and development; wind tunnels.
Over the past five years. United Technologies spent SI 8 billion on
research and development; during the next five years, there are plans
to spend another $2 5 billion or more
Think about it!
