# Pay hikes spark allegations

Most University staff employees would receive pay
raises under a new wage plan that could go into effect as
early as September.
While the University says these changes are the result of
a study started in 1978, the Office Staff Organizing Com
mittee (OSOC) claims they are a blatant attempt to in
fluence next month's union election.
If OSOC's drive for unionization is successful, these
raises proposed for most of the clerical help would be re
formulated, since they would be dependent upon the col
lective bargaining demands of the new union.
Annually announced at this time, wage increases fall
into two categories: those for mostly clerical help which
the University calls "nonexempt, nonunit staff" members
— that is, those who would be part of the bargaining unit if
the union election is successful — and those for pro
fessional but non-faculty employees, or "exempt staff."
Each position — Office Assistant, for instance — has a
range of salaries that pertains to it. Each employee is
placed at one of six steps of pay within that range, and re
ceives a raise from one to the next about once a year.
After employees reach the sixth step, they enter the
"merit zone" in which raises are determined by their su
pervisors.
These six steps will be pared down to four in the fall.
In the fall, those employees still in the step structure
will receive a minimum 12 percent increase and could re
ceive as much as 22 percent. Those in the merit zone could
receive anywhere from zero to 22 percent more, but they
could not receive less overall salary than those in step six
of the current system. Approximately 2000 nonexempt
staff members are employed by the University.
In addition, the nearly 2500 exempt staff members will
receive increases from zero to 16 percent, based on merit.
These are the highest percentage increases proposed by
the University in recent years.
Rosemary Monroe, assistant manager in Compensa
tion, said the increases stem from a variety of factors, in
cluding "double-digit inflation," which she said has af
fected the local market a great deal in that people seek
rapid advancement and are unwilling to commute as far to
work. The increases, she said, are an attempt to reach a

"better relative position in the local market."
Joyce Tipps-Coates, spokesperson for OSOC, the com
mittee seeking to unionize clerical workers here, said the
higher salaries and structural changes are a "direct result
of the organizing effort.'' Coates said the raises are part of
an attempt of the University to get clerical staff to ask,
"Why do we need a union?"
In the fall, when the six steps in the wage structure will
be reduced to four, each step increase will include a 5 per
cent jump in salary, as opposed to the current 2.5 percent.
Thus employees will be able to enter the merit zone more
rapidly with greater pay increases, a change the Univer
sity says it hopes will increase incentive and allow for
more supervisorial discretion in salary decisions, both
areas in which the University feels it lags behind local in
dustry.
Tipps-Coates said the University has always had trouble
retaining clerical workers and that the argument that they
are seeking a better relative position in the local labor
market is just a front for what amounts to "an unfair labor
practice."
Employee Relations Manager Felix Barthelemy said
this is not an unfair labor practice as the University has
been "reviewing the issue for some time" and has "tradi
tionally" announced pay hikes at this time. He said it is
"coincidental that the announcement came at the same
time" as the union elections.
A spokesman for the National Labor Relations Board
said that under the laws, any organization facing a
unionization drive must follow its timetable from the past
or face a review from the Board. Thus, if the University
had not announced changes at the same time as in the past,
its practices could have been called into question.
Should the OSOC campaign for clerical unionization be
successful, the pay increases proposed by the University
for clerical workers might be changed since wage levels
would be negotiated by the new union.
Tipps-Coates said the University's attempt to prevent
the union from winning the election by offering much
higher salaries and more rapid advancement before the
election will backfire in that people will see through it and
the the newer, higher wage levels will become the baseline
for future union negotiations.
