# Mental health experts frustrated by many of the lockup regulations
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Although psychiatrists are
more skilled at detecting men
tal illness than predicting dan
gerous acts, experts say that a
young man sick enough to have
required psychiatric care would
have given myriad clues to
potentially violent behavior.
But, they add, even if 25-year
old John Warnock Hinckley Jr.,
the "dropout from the world"
charged with shooting Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, had been
deemed dangerous, mental
health professionals would have
been helpless to do much about
it because of recent laws that
prohibit locking up all but the
most immediately dangerous or
disabled.
Hinckley's parents issued a
statement Monday that their
son "had been under recent psy
chiatric care," but added that
"these evaluations did not alert
anyone to the seriousness of his
condition."
Psychiatrists would have
looked for three things as clues
to potentially violent behavior,
said Dr. L. J. West, chairman of
psychiatry at the University of
California at Los Angeles, who
has specialized in the study of
violent patients:
• Behavioral symptoms
pointing to a preoccupation with
violence, such as thoughts about
attacking someone, threats, a
fascination with weapons, a
habit of staking out or stalking
persons with the idea of harm
ing them, or previous abortive
attempts.
• Signs that the person's con
trol system is deteriorating as
his mental disorder advances:
"As the disease worsens, the
thinking of dreams and night
mares, for example, becomes
part of the patient's waking
thought," West said.
"The disease" in this case is
most likely schizophrenia, a se
rious mental disorder whose

victims misinterpret reality. It
affects males and females
equally, and it is thought to af
fect 1 percent of all white males
Hinckley's age. Typically the
first symptoms appear in
middle to late adolescence, with
warning signs such as shyness,
withdrawal, diminished social
activity and moodiness. Almost
all of those who have as
sassinated or attempted to as
sassinate U.S. presidents have

been diagnosed as
schizophrenic.
Assassins tend to choose sym
bolic fathers, like a president,
as their target, ostensibly be
cause of unresolved conflicts
with their own fathers, psy
chiatrists say.
But even assuming that
Hinckley had been flagged as
potentially violent, under Colo
rado law he could not have been

involuntarily hospitalized.
Dr. David Starrett, head of
the University of Colorado psy
chiatric hospital in Denver, said
that no patient can be held
against his will — even for a
brief period — unless he appears
mentally ill and, as a result,
poses an "imminent" danger to
himself or others or is gravely
disabled. But the threat must be
immediate to justify detaining
him.
