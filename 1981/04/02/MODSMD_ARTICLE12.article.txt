# NRA will have its day in court

New York (AP) — The Na
tional Rifle Association, for
years a powerful legislative lob
by of Americans who believe
they have a right to buy, sell and
bear firearms, is training its
sights on the nation's courts.
NRA officials say the shoot
ing of President Ronald Reagan
and renewed demands for gun
control will not affect efforts by
its new Firearms Civil Rights
Legal Defense Fund to fight
laws the NRA failed to shoot
down in Congress or state legis

latures.
But gun control advocates,
who have fought a mostly losing
battle against NRA lobbyists,
say the gun organization is ac
tually defending wrong-doers
who would sell guns to the likes
of Mexican bandits and New
York street gangs.
Caught in the crossfire is the
U.S. Treasury's Bureau of Alco
hol, Tobacco & Firearms: the
NRA says the agency is too zeal
ous in enforcing federal fire
arms laws; anti-gun forces say
it's is not doing enough.
Richard Gardiner, an NRA
staff attorney, said the defense
fund, recently granted tax-ex
empt status by the Internal Rev
enue Service, is a direct re
sponse to BATF's enforcement
efforts.
"We only take the cases of
people who have been entrapped
or enticed or set up," Gardiner
said. "They are stupid cases
brought against people with no
prior offenses. We have not
taken the case of anyone we
didn't think was innocent, al
though they may technically
have violated the law."
Gardiner said the new fund
will finance defense efforts in
about two dozen cases in which
the association is already in
volved, as well as some new

ones.
"The laws we're talking
about don't prohibit misuse of a
firearm. They're all illegal
transfer or possession cases,"
many prosecuted under the Gun
Control Act of 1968, he said.
The BATF has made needless
arrests and prosecutions, Gar
diner said, arguing that was be
cause "they've got to do some
thing. They can't expect Con
gress to give their bureau more
money to do less. Moonshining
isn't the problem it used to be."
Beneficiaries of NRA legal
support include an elderly wom
an from Gary. Indiana who was
denied a gun permit after Mayor
Richard Thatcher ordered a
moratorium on them. In Wash
ington, D C., the NRA is assist
ing a man whose gun was not re
turned by authorities even
though charges on which he was
arrested were dropped.
But anti-gun forces say the
NRA is also helping less deserv
ing defendants. In one case a
dealer sold guns to undercover
agents who said they planned to
sell them to Mexican bandits. In
another, a couple sold guns to
agents who said they were deal
ing with New York street gangs.
The NRA says these are cases
of entrapment. The BATF re
sponds that even where convic

tions were not obtained, evi
dence that was ruled inad
missible at trial justified the
prosecution.
Gun control groups argue the
defense fund will be used to in
timidate an already gun-shy
BATF. The fund's real purpose,
said Sam Field of the National
Coalition to Ban Handguns, is
"to create a political at
mosphere in which people will
believe BATF is crazy and ir
responsible."
Field said the campaign was
having an effect. He charged
that agents are no longer free to
snoop around gun exhibits,
which Field called "super
markets for illegal guns."
As for the complaints of gun
control groups that the agency
is not doing enough, bureau of
ficials say they are restricted by
a limited number of agents and
by the law itself.
"Both (sides) are criticizing
us. One of them has to be
wrong," said Michael La Perch,
acting assistant director for
criminal enforcement.
But, lie noted, "with the cur
rent director, if we have a case
that even appears to be frivo
lous, it's questioned. ... If any
case is marginal, I know I'm
going to get a call."

ing with New York street gangs.
The NRA says these are cases
of entrapment. The BATF re
sponds that even where convic

tions were not obtained, evi
dence that was ruled inad
missible at trial justified the
prosecution.
Gun control groups argue the
defense fund will be used to in
timidate an already gun-shy
BATF. The fund's real purpose,
said Sam Field of the National
Coalition to Ban Handguns, is
"to create a political at
mosphere in which people will
believe BATF is crazy and ir
responsible."
Field said the campaign was
having an effect. He charged
that agents are no longer free to
snoop around gun exhibits,
which Field called "super
markets for illegal guns."
As for the complaints of gun
control groups that the agency
is not doing enough, bureau of
ficials say they are restricted by
a limited number of agents and
by the law itself.
"Both (sides) are criticizing
us. One of them has to be
wrong," said Michael La Perch,
acting assistant director for
criminal enforcement.
But, lie noted, "with the cur
rent director, if we have a case
that even appears to be frivo
lous, it's questioned. ... If any
case is marginal, I know I'm
going to get a call."

New York (AP) — The Na
tional Rifle Association, for
years a powerful legislative lob
by of Americans who believe
they have a right to buy, sell and
bear firearms, is training its
sights on the nation's courts.
NRA officials say the shoot
ing of President Ronald Reagan
and renewed demands for gun
control will not affect efforts by
its new Firearms Civil Rights
Legal Defense Fund to fight
laws the NRA failed to shoot
down in Congress or state legis

latures.
But gun control advocates,
who have fought a mostly losing
battle against NRA lobbyists,
say the gun organization is ac
tually defending wrong-doers
who would sell guns to the likes
of Mexican bandits and New
York street gangs.
Caught in the crossfire is the
U.S. Treasury's Bureau of Alco
hol, Tobacco & Firearms: the
NRA says the agency is too zeal
ous in enforcing federal fire
arms laws; anti-gun forces say
it's is not doing enough.
Richard Gardiner, an NRA
staff attorney, said the defense
fund, recently granted tax-ex
empt status by the Internal Rev
enue Service, is a direct re
sponse to BATF's enforcement
efforts.
"We only take the cases of
people who have been entrapped
or enticed or set up," Gardiner
said. "They are stupid cases
brought against people with no
prior offenses. We have not
taken the case of anyone we
didn't think was innocent, al
though they may technically
have violated the law."
Gardiner said the new fund
will finance defense efforts in
about two dozen cases in which
the association is already in
volved, as well as some new

ones.
"The laws we're talking
about don't prohibit misuse of a
firearm. They're all illegal
transfer or possession cases,"
many prosecuted under the Gun
Control Act of 1968, he said.
The BATF has made needless
arrests and prosecutions, Gar
diner said, arguing that was be
cause "they've got to do some
thing. They can't expect Con
gress to give their bureau more
money to do less. Moonshining
isn't the problem it used to be."
Beneficiaries of NRA legal
support include an elderly wom
an from Gary. Indiana who was
denied a gun permit after Mayor
Richard Thatcher ordered a
moratorium on them. In Wash
ington, D C., the NRA is assist
ing a man whose gun was not re
turned by authorities even
though charges on which he was
arrested were dropped.
But anti-gun forces say the
NRA is also helping less deserv
ing defendants. In one case a
dealer sold guns to undercover
agents who said they planned to
sell them to Mexican bandits. In
another, a couple sold guns to
agents who said they were deal
ing with New York street gangs.
The NRA says these are cases
of entrapment. The BATF re
sponds that even where convic

tions were not obtained, evi
dence that was ruled inad
missible at trial justified the
prosecution.
Gun control groups argue the
