## Farewell to Peter Bing 
### 
The past five years have been years of
quiet change for the University. One per
son who has played a key role in leading it
through these years is outgoing Board of
Trustees President Peter Bing.
Bing has shown throughout his tenure as
board president a refreshing concern for
student interests and input when the Uni
versity has made major policy decisions.
Recently he attended a meeting with resi
dents of Escondido Village about the con
troversial planned rent hikes. During the
South Africa investment flare-ups of 1977.
Bing spent time with members of Stanford
Committee for a Responsible Investment

Policy discussing the trustees' decisions
on various proxy votes. SCRIP members
still recall the time when he lent member
Steve Hansch $50 to get his car out of the
San Francisco Car Pound. Hansch had
parked illegally outside the trustees' San
Francisco office when they were conduct
ing a committee meeting on proxy votes
on South Africa investments.
We wish incoming Board President Wil
liam Kimball the best of luck at the job.
He has a hard act to follow, and we hope he
will carry on many of the practices of his
predecessor that helped increase student
participation in the decision-making proc
esses.
