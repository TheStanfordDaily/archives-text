# Welcome to new provost

### 
The Daily warmly welcomes Prof. Al
bert Hastorf, praised by President Donald
Kennedy for his "extraordinary per
formance" as acting provost, to his ap
pointment to that office on a regular basis.
In his addition to his ample experience
for the job, Hastorf has what Kennedy
calls "extraordinary respect among the
faculty."
Search committee head Norm Wessells,
professor of biology, cited the new prov
ost's display of exceptional personal quali
ties in a difficult job. Hastorf. a psy
chologist, is known for his humor and
strong academic leadership.
Both characteristics will be invaluable
since Hastorf plans to continue meeting

the challenge of funding for academic and
research programs.
The search was thorough, involving
about 100 candidates from within the Uni
versity and 150 from outside. Hastorf was
found most capable. In addition to his post
as acting provost since last August,
Hastorf's experience has included head
ing the Faculty Senate from 1979-80, the
Advisory Board from 1978-79 and the Boys'
Town Center from 1975 until his appoint
ment as acting provost.
His strong personal qualities and ex
tensive administrative experience make
Hastorf the logical choice for the Univer
sity's second ranking academic office.
