## Impulse to touch celebrities 
### 
Sometimes you can explain why a nobody tries
to kill a celebrity: political opposition, personal
malice, revenge. But then there are the so-called
senseless shootings: Sarah Moore taking a shot at
Jerry Ford: David Chapman killing his idol, John
Lennon: John Hinckley wounding Ronald Reagan
Though assassins strike from various motives,
and though Hinckley is the one currently in the
headlines, the most general insight into the as
sassin mentality comes from Chapman.
Nobodies like Chapman shoot celebrities for the
same reason some children misbehave: if Mom
my won't notice me when I'm good, she will when
I'm bad. Sure, I'll be punished, but the attention is
worth the pain.
As we get older we try different ploys to capture
the notice of those we consider important (which
includes the public at large). We toss Pavarotti a
rose, throw paper airplanes at the center fielder,
give the candidate a cowboy hat he'll have to put
on. We pester the teacher with self-serving ques
tions. Look at me, Daddy, look at me! We stand
outside the rock star's hotel, try to engage him in
conversation, play him a song, shake his hand,
take a snapshot, get an autograph.
The objective is to make the celebrity aware of
us, as we are of him, even if only for a moment. He
has touched our life in some direct or indirect
way, and we want that feeling of importance from
having touched his — if not by invitation, then by

carving graffiti on his memory.
If all else fails (and if it is really that important
to us) we can always put a bullet in his body. That
will get his — and Newsweek's — attention. Look
at me. dammit, look at me! We need not want him
to die. necessarily. Nor need we be insane, neces
sarily. We need only have an overpowering desire
to touch his life, even if by ending it.
Chapman's murder of John Lennon typifies this
motive. Hinckley's shots at Reagan may or may
not have sprung from a similar motive. I would
not begin to suggest that this is the only motive
animating the nobodies who shoot celebrities, nor
that it applies in every case. But it does seem to be
one of the threads tangled with others in the minds
of the majority of assassins.
We may be able to reduce the incidence of as
sassinations by taking away more guns, issuing
more bullet-proof vests, hiring more bodyguards,
or locking up more people. But as long as we have
celebrities we will have people wanting to touch
them. Most will throw roses or paper airplanes; a
few will throw bullets.
Though the impulse to touch a celebrity man
ifests itself in reprehensible form in the minds of
assassins, the same root impulse in benign form is
no stranger to any of us.
