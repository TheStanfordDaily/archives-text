Chalk me up for Phil
I am moved by the letter from
Marc Shor (Daily, March 11) to
respond to those who would like
to drain the ink from the pen of
Philip Chalk. Admittedly
Chalk's cartoons often border
on the arrogant and caustic, and
I imagine many of his views are
not shared by the entire Stan
ford community. But why
should they be? Those reading
the Daily undoubtedly have
very diverse political views,
and I should hope that they
would be discerning enough to
develop an intelligent reaction
to a political cartoon while re
alizing that there is certainly
more than one opinion on any

subject.
What is the poirtt ot political
cartooning if not. through the
use of exaggeration, caricature,
and irony, to elicit a response
from the viewer? One does not
expect Walt Disney's Fantasia
from someone who is trying to
suggest political criticism.
Shor's statement that at
titudes like Chalk's are precise
ly those which undermine the
ASSU Senate's reputation shows
a certain naivete about the
purpose of editorial commen
tary.
The point is that they are not
beyond reproach, and their ac
tions can be open to student
criticism by virtue of the fact
that they are supposed to be rep

resenting the students.
Let us never assume that
criticism is always negative, for
as soon as we stop reacting to
the issues around us. we deserve
to be smothered in apathy which
many claim already pervades
campus attitudes. I, for one,
welcome the often con
troversial cartoons of Philip
Chalk, even if I don't always
agree with their content, solely
because they provoke interest
ing reflection.
