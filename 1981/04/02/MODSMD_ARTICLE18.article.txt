## Liberal grading policy in need of change 
### 
The University's current grading policy
is under attack by all sides Graduate
schools complain about grade inflation, the
Faculty-Senate believes the system is not
satisfying its original goals, and students
complain if for no other reason than the sake
of complaining.
The problem is quite simple — everyone
seems to graduate at the top of the class.
Several factors contribute to the excess of
near-perfect transcripts: students drop
classes they are getting below a B in, F's do
not appear on the transcript, and teachers
award too many A s.
On the surface the A. B, or NC system ap
pears to benefit the students, but in reality
no one benefits. Graduate schools are well
aware of the University's grade inflation so
they downplay grades and emphasize test
scores in admissions decisions. Employers
are also aware of the insignificance of Stan
ford's grades.
Although the current system doesn't help
anyone, it hurts students who would attain
good grades under a less inflated system be
cause their grades, although legitimate, are
customarily decreased in value by graduate
schools and employers.
Considering the facts, a change is immi
nent and two alternatives are tightening the
system or eliminating grades altogether.
The latter option is appealing although it
has received little attention. This policy has
been implemented with success at many
other schools and would conform with the
University's educational philosophy.
Without grades, students could experi
ment, take challenging classes, and not
worry about getting the dreadful C.
Moreover, this idea would distinguish Stan
ford from the rest of the "prestigious"' uni
versities, making it a forerunner rather
than a follower.
There are other advantages but there are
also two major problems. First, it lacks
motivation for the students. Under a no
grade policy, many students might feel
there is no longer any reason to go to class.
Students might routinely take tests, pass
with a D, have a good time, and graduate.
Second, graduate schools still have dif
ficulty with innovative transcripts. Ad

missions generally rely on test scores rath
er than the teacher evaluations
In this light, a no-grade system does not
seem to be a viable alternative, and the oth
er option of tightening standards is more ap
propriate.
This is the solution currently being con
sidered by the Facuity-Senate. The proposal
includes making the pass/no credit and
dropping deadlines an earlier date. The ra
tionale is to prevent students from electing
these options after receiving their mid-term
grades.
This is an idea whose time has come as
the liberal grading policy is continually
abused by students. The original purpose of
the liberal pass/no credit and dropping op
tions was to allow students to experiment or
to take difficult but interesting classes
without worrying about grades. The concept
was founded on the same precept as the no
grade policy with its intention being to
downplay the importance of grades.
But the policy is rarely used in this
manner. Rather it is exercised to reserve
the transcript. If there is a chance they will
get a C or below, many students will either
drop the class or take it pass/no credit.
Similarly, the pass/no credit option is
used on required classes rather than elec
tives, an indication that the original inten
tion of the system has been perverted.
Moving the deadlines up may not en
courage students to take difficult classes,
but it will prevent transcript manipulation
and force students to work harder rather
than taking the popular escape routes.
Another idea under consideration is re
turning the F to the transcript. Currently,
students can drop a class by getting an F.
This can be done even through the final.
This was originally a good idea but it has
also been abused. Students often tell the
teacher to give him an F when he would nor
mally receive a D. Again the original inten
tion is lost, grades become a student's sole
concern.
Tightening the grading system will help

correct the problem. But these changes
alone will not solve the problem because the
dilemma of too many A s remains.
This half of the issue centers on teachers
who give a large proportion of unwarranted
A s. An A is supposed to represent "excep
tional performance,'' and professors need
to keep this in mind.
A s should be given for exceptional per
formance. It is as simple as that. If this
means everyone or no one in class gets an A,
that's fine.
The interpretation of exceptional per
formance must be left up to professor
whether it be a percentage or a qualitative
standard, the professor must have a person
al and absolute standard. Drawing a line
through the middle of the scores and giving
the top half A's and the rest B's is not an ade
quate policy.
Curves should not be used. They merely
indicate quantitative performance and fail
to measure qualitative. If one scores 70 per
cent in a class but is in the top 20 percent,
then on a curve that 70 percent might be an
A.
But it hardly seems right that 70 percent
is declared exceptional performance. If the
professor believes it is exceptional, the
class must be much too dificult and should
be re-evaluated.
A final problem is that under the present
grading system when one receives an A one
cannot help wondering whether the A is tru
ly deserved. The pride associated with an A
is easily distorted.
It is unfortunate that grades are neces
sary. Ideally, a no-grade system would be
most desirable, but realistically this is not a
viable alternative. Nevertheless, change is
necessary to remedy the highly criticized
present system.
The University's liberal grading policy
has been abused for too long. The original
purpose of the system has been lost. The end
result is a policy in which no one benefits,
but the truly deserving students are ul
timately penalized.

used on required classes rather than elec
tives, an indication that the original inten
tion of the system has been perverted.
Moving the deadlines up may not en
courage students to take difficult classes,
but it will prevent transcript manipulation
and force students to work harder rather
than taking the popular escape routes.
Another idea under consideration is re
turning the F to the transcript. Currently,
students can drop a class by getting an F.
This can be done even through the final.
This was originally a good idea but it has
also been abused. Students often tell the
teacher to give him an F when he would nor
mally receive a D. Again the original inten
tion is lost, grades become a student's sole
concern.
Tightening the grading system will help

correct the problem. But these changes
alone will not solve the problem because the
dilemma of too many A s remains.
This half of the issue centers on teachers
who give a large proportion of unwarranted
A s. An A is supposed to represent "excep
tional performance,'' and professors need
to keep this in mind.
A s should be given for exceptional per
formance. It is as simple as that. If this
means everyone or no one in class gets an A,
that's fine.
The interpretation of exceptional per
formance must be left up to professor
whether it be a percentage or a qualitative
standard, the professor must have a person
al and absolute standard. Drawing a line
through the middle of the scores and giving
the top half A's and the rest B's is not an ade
quate policy.
Curves should not be used. They merely
indicate quantitative performance and fail
to measure qualitative. If one scores 70 per
cent in a class but is in the top 20 percent,
then on a curve that 70 percent might be an
A.
But it hardly seems right that 70 percent
is declared exceptional performance. If the
professor believes it is exceptional, the
class must be much too dificult and should
be re-evaluated.
A final problem is that under the present
grading system when one receives an A one
cannot help wondering whether the A is tru
ly deserved. The pride associated with an A
is easily distorted.
It is unfortunate that grades are neces
sary. Ideally, a no-grade system would be
most desirable, but realistically this is not a
viable alternative. Nevertheless, change is
necessary to remedy the highly criticized
present system.
The University's liberal grading policy
has been abused for too long. The original
purpose of the system has been lost. The end
result is a policy in which no one benefits,
but the truly deserving students are ul
timately penalized.

The University's current grading policy
is under attack by all sides Graduate
schools complain about grade inflation, the
Faculty-Senate believes the system is not
satisfying its original goals, and students
complain if for no other reason than the sake
of complaining.
The problem is quite simple — everyone
seems to graduate at the top of the class.
Several factors contribute to the excess of
near-perfect transcripts: students drop
classes they are getting below a B in, F's do
not appear on the transcript, and teachers
award too many A s.
On the surface the A. B, or NC system ap
pears to benefit the students, but in reality
no one benefits. Graduate schools are well
aware of the University's grade inflation so
they downplay grades and emphasize test
scores in admissions decisions. Employers
are also aware of the insignificance of Stan
ford's grades.
Although the current system doesn't help
anyone, it hurts students who would attain
good grades under a less inflated system be
cause their grades, although legitimate, are
customarily decreased in value by graduate
schools and employers.
Considering the facts, a change is immi
nent and two alternatives are tightening the
system or eliminating grades altogether.
The latter option is appealing although it
has received little attention. This policy has
been implemented with success at many
other schools and would conform with the
University's educational philosophy.
Without grades, students could experi
ment, take challenging classes, and not
worry about getting the dreadful C.
Moreover, this idea would distinguish Stan
ford from the rest of the "prestigious"' uni
versities, making it a forerunner rather
than a follower.
There are other advantages but there are
also two major problems. First, it lacks
motivation for the students. Under a no
grade policy, many students might feel
there is no longer any reason to go to class.
Students might routinely take tests, pass
with a D, have a good time, and graduate.
Second, graduate schools still have dif
ficulty with innovative transcripts. Ad

missions generally rely on test scores rath
er than the teacher evaluations
In this light, a no-grade system does not
seem to be a viable alternative, and the oth
er option of tightening standards is more ap
propriate.
This is the solution currently being con
sidered by the Facuity-Senate. The proposal
includes making the pass/no credit and
dropping deadlines an earlier date. The ra
tionale is to prevent students from electing
these options after receiving their mid-term
grades.
This is an idea whose time has come as
the liberal grading policy is continually
abused by students. The original purpose of
the liberal pass/no credit and dropping op
tions was to allow students to experiment or
to take difficult but interesting classes
without worrying about grades. The concept
was founded on the same precept as the no
grade policy with its intention being to
downplay the importance of grades.
But the policy is rarely used in this
manner. Rather it is exercised to reserve
the transcript. If there is a chance they will
get a C or below, many students will either
drop the class or take it pass/no credit.
Similarly, the pass/no credit option is
used on required classes rather than elec
tives, an indication that the original inten
tion of the system has been perverted.
