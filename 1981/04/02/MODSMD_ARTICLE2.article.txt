# Brown protests offshore oil drilling
## 
### Gale Warner 
Governor Jerry Brown voiced his
opposition to proposed offshore oil
drilling leases off large portions of the
northern California coast at a hearing
held yesterday by the Congressional
Subcommittee on Energy, Environ
ment and Natural Resources.
Brown was the first witness to testi
fy during the all-day hearing at San
Bruno's Skyline Community College
that included appearances by Con
gressman Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-
Palo Alto), Assemblyman Sam Farr
(D-Monterey), coastal county super
visors, members of the fishing and pe
troleum industries, environmen
talists, scientists and other concerned
parties.
Congressmen Toby Moffett (D-
Conn.), Joel Deckard (R-Ind.) and
Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) listened to a
wide range of opinions regarding Sec
retary of Interior James Watt's Feb
ruary proposal to open all tracts in
Outer Continental Shelf Lease Sale
No. 53 to oil and gas exploration and
development.
Moffett said one of the objectives of
the hearing would be "to determine if
Secretary Watt had an adequate fac
tual and policy basis to make this
critically important decision so swift
ly."
A few weeks after taking office,
Watt reversed the decision of his pred
ecessor, Cecil Andrus, to exclude four
sea-floor basins from the sale because
of economic and environmental con

siderations brought out in several
years of previous testimony.
"I am convinced that the record
shows that both the national interest
and the well-being of the citizens of
California are best served by not leas
ing the northern basins of the Califor
nia coast, the Eel River, Point Arena,
Bodega Basin, Santa Cruz Basin and
the northernmost portion of the Santa
Maria basin," said Brown.
Often interrupted by applause from
the standing-room-only crowd, Brown
said that he has clearly recommended
that the basin leases be deleted and
that, under the provisions of the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act, Watt has
an obligation to accept these recom
mendations after he determines that
they "provide for a reasonable bal
ance between the national interest and
the well-being of the state."
Brown also said that the secretary
seemed "confused" about the re
sponse of the state to the lease sale
proposals, and he advised Watt to
check his files more closely. Opposi
tion to Watt's proposal has been con
sistent and widespread at all levels of
government in California, he said, for
"self-evident" reasons.
If the views of the people of Califor
nia are not respected, warned Brown,
"I can assure Secretary Watt that vig
orous legal action will be taken, all the
way up to the Supreme Court if neces
sary, and those tracts will not be ex
ploited during his tenure."
Because of the litigation involved,
Brown said. Watt's proposal will ac
tually retard appropriate offshore

drilling rather than accelerate it.
Brown spoke of the need to take a
long-term view on this issue, and how
the amount of oil available in these
basins must be put into perspective.
He mentioned more fuel-efficient cars
and an increased commitment to
mass transit as examples of energy
conservation, as well as possibilities
for alternative energy sources such as
geothermal and co-generation to re
duce energy consumption without
harming economic growth.
"We have to recognize that there
are many ways of developing energy
and there are many ways of conserv
ing it. We ought to see the totality," he
said.
Pointing out that only a small per
centage of the lands presently leased
for exploration are actually being
fully utilized at this time. Brown ad
vised that we fully look at those areas
before reaching out to touch other,
more sensitive areas.
"We're not down to our last drop of
oil, and we're not even close. There's
no need to rush blindly ahead and
make these tracts available. There
are many opportunities, and it has to
be a question of priorities," he said.
When asked how increased
domestic production of oil might stave
off a possible military conflict in the
Middle East, Brown replied, "If it
were that easy, and we could provide
peace in the Middle East by drilling
off the coast of northern California,
then I might reconsider my position."

Maria basin," said Brown.
Often interrupted by applause from
the standing-room-only crowd, Brown
said that he has clearly recommended
that the basin leases be deleted and
that, under the provisions of the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act, Watt has
an obligation to accept these recom
mendations after he determines that
they "provide for a reasonable bal
ance between the national interest and
the well-being of the state."
Brown also said that the secretary
seemed "confused" about the re
sponse of the state to the lease sale
proposals, and he advised Watt to
check his files more closely. Opposi
tion to Watt's proposal has been con
sistent and widespread at all levels of
government in California, he said, for
"self-evident" reasons.
If the views of the people of Califor
nia are not respected, warned Brown,
"I can assure Secretary Watt that vig
orous legal action will be taken, all the
way up to the Supreme Court if neces
sary, and those tracts will not be ex
ploited during his tenure."
Because of the litigation involved,
Brown said. Watt's proposal will ac
tually retard appropriate offshore

drilling rather than accelerate it.
Brown spoke of the need to take a
long-term view on this issue, and how
the amount of oil available in these
basins must be put into perspective.
He mentioned more fuel-efficient cars
and an increased commitment to
mass transit as examples of energy
conservation, as well as possibilities
for alternative energy sources such as
geothermal and co-generation to re
duce energy consumption without
harming economic growth.
"We have to recognize that there
are many ways of developing energy
and there are many ways of conserv
ing it. We ought to see the totality," he
said.
Pointing out that only a small per
centage of the lands presently leased
for exploration are actually being
fully utilized at this time. Brown ad
vised that we fully look at those areas
before reaching out to touch other,
more sensitive areas.
"We're not down to our last drop of
oil, and we're not even close. There's
no need to rush blindly ahead and
make these tracts available. There
are many opportunities, and it has to
be a question of priorities," he said.
When asked how increased
domestic production of oil might stave
off a possible military conflict in the
Middle East, Brown replied, "If it
were that easy, and we could provide
peace in the Middle East by drilling
off the coast of northern California,
then I might reconsider my position."

Governor Jerry Brown voiced his
opposition to proposed offshore oil
drilling leases off large portions of the
northern California coast at a hearing
held yesterday by the Congressional
Subcommittee on Energy, Environ
ment and Natural Resources.
Brown was the first witness to testi
fy during the all-day hearing at San
Bruno's Skyline Community College
that included appearances by Con
gressman Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-
Palo Alto), Assemblyman Sam Farr
(D-Monterey), coastal county super
visors, members of the fishing and pe
troleum industries, environmen
talists, scientists and other concerned
parties.
Congressmen Toby Moffett (D-
Conn.), Joel Deckard (R-Ind.) and
Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) listened to a
wide range of opinions regarding Sec
retary of Interior James Watt's Feb
ruary proposal to open all tracts in
Outer Continental Shelf Lease Sale
No. 53 to oil and gas exploration and
development.
Moffett said one of the objectives of
the hearing would be "to determine if
Secretary Watt had an adequate fac
tual and policy basis to make this
critically important decision so swift
ly."
A few weeks after taking office,
Watt reversed the decision of his pred
ecessor, Cecil Andrus, to exclude four
sea-floor basins from the sale because
of economic and environmental con

siderations brought out in several
years of previous testimony.
"I am convinced that the record
shows that both the national interest
and the well-being of the citizens of
California are best served by not leas
ing the northern basins of the Califor
nia coast, the Eel River, Point Arena,
Bodega Basin, Santa Cruz Basin and
the northernmost portion of the Santa
Maria basin," said Brown.
Often interrupted by applause from
the standing-room-only crowd, Brown
said that he has clearly recommended
that the basin leases be deleted and
that, under the provisions of the Outer
Continental Shelf Lands Act, Watt has
an obligation to accept these recom
mendations after he determines that
they "provide for a reasonable bal
ance between the national interest and
the well-being of the state."
