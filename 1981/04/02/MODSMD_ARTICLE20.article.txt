## Increase diversity of student appearances 
### 
Walking over to Lake Lagunita on a sunny spring af
ternoon, one's vision is filled with the sight of tan good
looking, intelligent, well-conditioned Stanford stu
dents. Here, one might see superguy Dave Stanford
studley lounging in the sun. One would probably be
tempted to say to Dave, "Hey, you great Stanfordian
person! What's going on?"
Heading on over to Wilbur Field, one's eyes would
again be filled with visions of well-colored, smart,
handsome and physically attractive Stanford students.
Here, instead of frollicking in the water, these superior
Stanfordistic beings can be seen playing volleyball or
ultimate frisbee. Here, one can run into Dave's room
mate, Joe Stanfordstudish. As with Dave, one's initial
reaction when seeing Joe would be to say, "Ahoy, Joe,
you fantastic guy. How is everything going?" Then on
to DeGuerre Pool, and I will give you three guesses on
what you would find. One would see the same type of
elite Stanfordical organisms. Here, one would be stim
ulated to say no more than, "How are you, Kathy, you
ultimate Stanfordian creation of the heavens."
Certainly, it is a tribute to the University that one can
find so many perfect beings on its grounds While it is
commendable, it is also quite boring and misleading
One of the reasons New York City is such an exciting
city, as well as so easily inhabitable, is that there is
such diversity in the appearances of New Yorkers. Ev
eryone in New York has his own special qualities, and
everyone is eager to show others what these qualities
are.
Walking down Madison Avenue, one can see jewelers
flaunting expensive jewelry, record producers carry
ing around and listening to their stereos, and muggers
displaying their knives. People are not shy about show
ing others who and what they are.
Obviously, everyone at this school has more in his life
than just good looks (which, by the way, is a question
able trait for some), intelligence, a perfect body
(again questionable.) Yet, people here seem reluctant

to display their special qualities. Consequently, one
gets the false impression that everyone on campus is
exactly the same.
In order to make this campus a place where one can
distinguish between different groups of people, people
must start showing some diversity in their ap
pearances.
One of the first groups that would have to become di
verse would be the guys who live in frats, or, as they are
more commonly and affectionately called, the frat
rats.
Presently, it is virtually impossible to differentiate
between the frat-rats and the guys that live at, for ex
ample, the Burbank Palace, which is in the Kingdom of
Stern. This has especially negative consequences for
the freshman going through the rush. This freshman
would probably like to see what the frat-rats look like
away from their holes - I mean their frats. What is a
poor freshman, a guy like Bill Defroshell, and, more
importantly, it would add diversity to the campus.
When seeing a frat-rat, a guy like Gary Rodentberg,
lounging on a raft in the Lake, one would be able to say
more simply a boring, "What's going on, Gary, and how
is the frat?" You can see how diverse appearances
could lead toward much more stimulating conversa
tion.
An added advantage would be for those girls that only
like frat-rats. No longer would there be embarassing
situations like the one I, or rather a close friend of mine
experienced recently.
My friend had spent some time at a party with the
beautiful Susan Bedmaterson. My friend thought he
might be able to gather up enough courage to ask Susan
back to his room for a nightcap.
However, somehow it came out that my friend was
not a member of a frat. Well, Susan dropped this guy as
quickly as a Stanford student sells back his books after
finals Both Susan and my friend were quite disturbed
In fact, my friend was so disturbed that the following

day he ran to the dish twice, wrote six letters to old girl
friends, did all his math homework, and put oil and
vinegar on his salad at dinner instead of the usual Ital
ian dressing.
All this could have been avoided if frat-rats were in
the practice of wearing tails. Susan would have known
to check out my friend's rear end before spending time
with him.
A further method of adding diversity to the ap
pearances of people on campus woi'ld be to have stu
dents somehow make their appearances represent
their majors. For example, econ majors could have
money hanging from their pockets, communication
majors could constantly talk, biology majors could go
around with blood-stained shirts (this would be very in
convenient for any policeman who might be seeking a
murderer on campus), and chemistry majors could
walk around with glazed eyes and unshaven faces.
Imagine the diversity that would exist. Soon, one
would be unable to distinguish between Times Square in
New York City and Campus Drive.
Of course, some complications could arise with this
diversity. For example, some students might lie. I
know many guys who live in dorms who would be will
ing to place tails on their backsides in order to attract
beautiful dolls like Susan Bedmaterson.
In order to prohibit false and misleading ap
pearances. there would have to be an honor code.
Everyone would have to sign his forehead.
If there were some cheaters, people would be ex
pected to report the cheaters to the Ombudsman. I am
sure the Ombudsman would not be too disturbed if a file
for "Appearance Cheaters'' were placed next to his file
for "Test Cheaters."
So c'mon, everyone. Let's do it! There are future
freshmen on campus these days. Let's show them that
this is truly a fantastic place. Let's get diverse.

back to his room for a nightcap.
However, somehow it came out that my friend was
not a member of a frat. Well, Susan dropped this guy as
quickly as a Stanford student sells back his books after
finals Both Susan and my friend were quite disturbed
In fact, my friend was so disturbed that the following

day he ran to the dish twice, wrote six letters to old girl
friends, did all his math homework, and put oil and
vinegar on his salad at dinner instead of the usual Ital
ian dressing.
All this could have been avoided if frat-rats were in
the practice of wearing tails. Susan would have known
to check out my friend's rear end before spending time
with him.
A further method of adding diversity to the ap
pearances of people on campus woi'ld be to have stu
dents somehow make their appearances represent
their majors. For example, econ majors could have
money hanging from their pockets, communication
majors could constantly talk, biology majors could go
around with blood-stained shirts (this would be very in
convenient for any policeman who might be seeking a
murderer on campus), and chemistry majors could
walk around with glazed eyes and unshaven faces.
Imagine the diversity that would exist. Soon, one
would be unable to distinguish between Times Square in
New York City and Campus Drive.
Of course, some complications could arise with this
diversity. For example, some students might lie. I
know many guys who live in dorms who would be will
ing to place tails on their backsides in order to attract
beautiful dolls like Susan Bedmaterson.
In order to prohibit false and misleading ap
pearances. there would have to be an honor code.
Everyone would have to sign his forehead.
If there were some cheaters, people would be ex
pected to report the cheaters to the Ombudsman. I am
sure the Ombudsman would not be too disturbed if a file
for "Appearance Cheaters'' were placed next to his file
for "Test Cheaters."
So c'mon, everyone. Let's do it! There are future
freshmen on campus these days. Let's show them that
this is truly a fantastic place. Let's get diverse.

Walking over to Lake Lagunita on a sunny spring af
ternoon, one's vision is filled with the sight of tan good
looking, intelligent, well-conditioned Stanford stu
dents. Here, one might see superguy Dave Stanford
studley lounging in the sun. One would probably be
tempted to say to Dave, "Hey, you great Stanfordian
person! What's going on?"
Heading on over to Wilbur Field, one's eyes would
again be filled with visions of well-colored, smart,
handsome and physically attractive Stanford students.
Here, instead of frollicking in the water, these superior
Stanfordistic beings can be seen playing volleyball or
ultimate frisbee. Here, one can run into Dave's room
mate, Joe Stanfordstudish. As with Dave, one's initial
reaction when seeing Joe would be to say, "Ahoy, Joe,
you fantastic guy. How is everything going?" Then on
to DeGuerre Pool, and I will give you three guesses on
what you would find. One would see the same type of
elite Stanfordical organisms. Here, one would be stim
ulated to say no more than, "How are you, Kathy, you
ultimate Stanfordian creation of the heavens."
Certainly, it is a tribute to the University that one can
find so many perfect beings on its grounds While it is
commendable, it is also quite boring and misleading
One of the reasons New York City is such an exciting
city, as well as so easily inhabitable, is that there is
such diversity in the appearances of New Yorkers. Ev
eryone in New York has his own special qualities, and
everyone is eager to show others what these qualities
are.
Walking down Madison Avenue, one can see jewelers
flaunting expensive jewelry, record producers carry
ing around and listening to their stereos, and muggers
displaying their knives. People are not shy about show
ing others who and what they are.
Obviously, everyone at this school has more in his life
than just good looks (which, by the way, is a question
able trait for some), intelligence, a perfect body
(again questionable.) Yet, people here seem reluctant

to display their special qualities. Consequently, one
gets the false impression that everyone on campus is
exactly the same.
In order to make this campus a place where one can
distinguish between different groups of people, people
must start showing some diversity in their ap
pearances.
One of the first groups that would have to become di
verse would be the guys who live in frats, or, as they are
more commonly and affectionately called, the frat
rats.
Presently, it is virtually impossible to differentiate
between the frat-rats and the guys that live at, for ex
ample, the Burbank Palace, which is in the Kingdom of
Stern. This has especially negative consequences for
the freshman going through the rush. This freshman
would probably like to see what the frat-rats look like
away from their holes - I mean their frats. What is a
poor freshman, a guy like Bill Defroshell, and, more
importantly, it would add diversity to the campus.
When seeing a frat-rat, a guy like Gary Rodentberg,
lounging on a raft in the Lake, one would be able to say
more simply a boring, "What's going on, Gary, and how
is the frat?" You can see how diverse appearances
could lead toward much more stimulating conversa
tion.
An added advantage would be for those girls that only
like frat-rats. No longer would there be embarassing
situations like the one I, or rather a close friend of mine
experienced recently.
My friend had spent some time at a party with the
beautiful Susan Bedmaterson. My friend thought he
might be able to gather up enough courage to ask Susan
back to his room for a nightcap.
