## American Poop: animation dies in L.A. 
### Jim Mattson 
American Pop, a feature
length cartoon directed by
Ralph Bakshi, is enough to give
the fine art of cynicism a bad
name. Bakshi reveals nothing
but disdain for his characters
and contempt for his audience.
This is a "history" of Ameri
can popular music. It begins in
Russia, immigrates to New
York, dallies in Kansas, and
dies in Los Angeles. Life's like
that.
To tell his tale. Bakshi
creates a series of proto-people.
A proto-Gershwin gives birth to
another, less-talented proto-
Gershwin gives birth to a proto-
Jim Morrison gives birth to a
proto-Tom Petty. In this
manner has the glorious lineage
of American song been begat.
These proto-people write pro
to-tunes which are uncannily
like the real tunes we all know
and cherish. The proto-
Gershwin writes "Our Love is
Here to Stay." The proto-Tom

Petty has evidently not been
able to buy the rights to any real
Tom Petty tune. Instead, he sits
down and sings "Night Moves."
One of the characters tells his
son. "if you can't live my
dreams, then live my life." This
immortal line seems to have
been Bakshi's inspiration. Un
able to capture any of the dream
of a popular art form, he con
tents himself with stealing bits
from its history.
Thus, we are able to ex
perience. in living animation,
all the carnage — set to music,
of course — of World War I,
World War 11. Korea, and Viet
nam. We are able to see a proto-
Janis Joplin die of an overdose.
We are able to see gangsters
massacre each other.
There might be some connec
tion between all of this, but none
is evident here. Bakshi uses vi
olent death as bad writers use
exclamation marks: "And then
ragtime was born!" "And then
World War II spread American

music to foreign lands!!" "And
then the Beat movement in
vented angst!!!"
But American Pop is. after
all. an animated film and not an
essay Good animation should
allow one to overlook some
weaknesses in a movie's con
struction. It grieves me to re
port that American Pop con
tains some of the worst anima
tion I have ever seen.
Animation, in any style, is
fabulously expensive. Hundreds
of thousands of drawings must
be made to produce the illusion
of moving drawings, and this re
quires hundreds of artists and
technicians, all of whom must
be paid.
The most influential anima
tion style in this country is the
one associated with Disney, who
emphasized naturalistic move
ment and lush backgrounds.
This, unfortunately for anima
tion in this country, is also the
most expensive style. (Sleeping
Beauty, for example, cost $6

million in 1959 currency.)
Bakshi emulates the Disney
look. His movies, from his first
feature, Fritz the Cat, through
his last. The Lord of the Hint's,
have become increasingly natu
ralistic. He strives for the look
of the Disney film without hav
ing the budget to achieve it.
Bakshi s main tool is a device
called the rotoscope, whereby
live-action is traced to produce
— kablooie! — "living anima
tion." Even Disney fell back on
the rotoscope on occasion, when
the accomplishment of some
movement (people dancing,
say) evaded him. But Bakshi
uses the rotoscope for every
character.
Bakshi's movies are made up
of live actors who have been
mummified beneath a clumsily
drawn shroud. In his films, we
find none of the exaggeration of
movement associated with clas
sical animation techniques —
exaggeration that, para
doxically, made the characters

seem more alive. Because the
drawing has been tied to a re
lentlessly "real" substructure,
the people in American Pop are
pedestrian even when they're
not walking. Heads move, but
bodies remain stationary. An
arm will trace a spastic arc and
then freeze in animated rigor
mortis. Legs jiggle against
backgrounds in a relentless
parody of St. Vitus' Dance.
It's not clear what motivated
Bakshi to make this film. No
where in it does he reveal any
love of anyone or anything.
There is not one character in
American Pop with whom we
can empathize. There is not one
scene in which the director be
trays any joy in exploiting the
capabilities of an art form.
American Pop is history for a
society that ignores its own
past. It is animation for people
who have never seen any other
animated film. It is moviemak
ing for those who despise mov
ies.

all the carnage — set to music,
of course — of World War I,
World War 11. Korea, and Viet
nam. We are able to see a proto-
Janis Joplin die of an overdose.
We are able to see gangsters
massacre each other.
There might be some connec
tion between all of this, but none
is evident here. Bakshi uses vi
olent death as bad writers use
exclamation marks: "And then
ragtime was born!" "And then
World War II spread American

music to foreign lands!!" "And
then the Beat movement in
vented angst!!!"
But American Pop is. after
all. an animated film and not an
essay Good animation should
allow one to overlook some
weaknesses in a movie's con
struction. It grieves me to re
port that American Pop con
tains some of the worst anima
tion I have ever seen.
Animation, in any style, is
fabulously expensive. Hundreds
of thousands of drawings must
be made to produce the illusion
of moving drawings, and this re
quires hundreds of artists and
technicians, all of whom must
be paid.
The most influential anima
tion style in this country is the
one associated with Disney, who
emphasized naturalistic move
ment and lush backgrounds.
This, unfortunately for anima
tion in this country, is also the
most expensive style. (Sleeping
Beauty, for example, cost $6

million in 1959 currency.)
Bakshi emulates the Disney
look. His movies, from his first
feature, Fritz the Cat, through
his last. The Lord of the Hint's,
have become increasingly natu
ralistic. He strives for the look
of the Disney film without hav
ing the budget to achieve it.
Bakshi s main tool is a device
called the rotoscope, whereby
live-action is traced to produce
— kablooie! — "living anima
tion." Even Disney fell back on
the rotoscope on occasion, when
the accomplishment of some
movement (people dancing,
say) evaded him. But Bakshi
uses the rotoscope for every
character.
Bakshi's movies are made up
of live actors who have been
mummified beneath a clumsily
drawn shroud. In his films, we
find none of the exaggeration of
movement associated with clas
sical animation techniques —
exaggeration that, para
doxically, made the characters

seem more alive. Because the
drawing has been tied to a re
lentlessly "real" substructure,
the people in American Pop are
pedestrian even when they're
not walking. Heads move, but
bodies remain stationary. An
arm will trace a spastic arc and
then freeze in animated rigor
mortis. Legs jiggle against
backgrounds in a relentless
parody of St. Vitus' Dance.
It's not clear what motivated
Bakshi to make this film. No
where in it does he reveal any
love of anyone or anything.
There is not one character in
American Pop with whom we
can empathize. There is not one
scene in which the director be
trays any joy in exploiting the
capabilities of an art form.
American Pop is history for a
society that ignores its own
past. It is animation for people
who have never seen any other
animated film. It is moviemak
ing for those who despise mov
ies.

American Pop, a feature
length cartoon directed by
Ralph Bakshi, is enough to give
the fine art of cynicism a bad
name. Bakshi reveals nothing
but disdain for his characters
and contempt for his audience.
This is a "history" of Ameri
can popular music. It begins in
Russia, immigrates to New
York, dallies in Kansas, and
dies in Los Angeles. Life's like
that.
To tell his tale. Bakshi
creates a series of proto-people.
A proto-Gershwin gives birth to
another, less-talented proto-
Gershwin gives birth to a proto-
Jim Morrison gives birth to a
proto-Tom Petty. In this
manner has the glorious lineage
of American song been begat.
These proto-people write pro
to-tunes which are uncannily
like the real tunes we all know
and cherish. The proto-
Gershwin writes "Our Love is
Here to Stay." The proto-Tom

Petty has evidently not been
able to buy the rights to any real
Tom Petty tune. Instead, he sits
down and sings "Night Moves."
One of the characters tells his
son. "if you can't live my
dreams, then live my life." This
immortal line seems to have
been Bakshi's inspiration. Un
able to capture any of the dream
of a popular art form, he con
tents himself with stealing bits
from its history.
Thus, we are able to ex
perience. in living animation,
all the carnage — set to music,
of course — of World War I,
World War 11. Korea, and Viet
nam. We are able to see a proto-
Janis Joplin die of an overdose.

massacre each other.
