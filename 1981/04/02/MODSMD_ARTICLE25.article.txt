# Hackman and Streisand make comeback in 'All Night Long'
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
It used to be said that the
most elusive virtue in movies
was good writing. Actors and di
rectors have often ridden rough
shod over bad scripts; recently,
however, there seems to be a
renaissance in American movie
writing. There has been more
first-rate dialogue spoken on the
screen in the past year than I
can remember in any 12-month
period since I began to go to the
movies; a credit to Bo Gold
man, W.D. Richter, Steve
Tesich. Robert Zemeckis and
Bob Gale—or the newly arrived
John Sayles and Eleanor Bergs
tein — may now be an assurance
of quality as Robert Towne's or
Alvin Sargent's names were in
the early '70s.
W.D. Richter made his
screenwriting debut about eight
years ago with an oddball com
edy called Slither, in which
James Caan played an ex-con
sent on a search for a large sum
of money by a prison buddy. The
plot was overtly derivative, but
the character Caan played had a
scruffy decency and a wariness
around strangers that amounted
to comic paranoia — a paranoia
fully justiifed by the nutsy col
lection of fellow fortune seekers
he met along the way.
The 1978 remake of Invasion
of the Body Snatchers, which
Richte wrote for Philip Kauf
man. enshrined the suspicious
ness of people who lived uneasi
ly in society, working at jobs
that indicated their distrust of it
(Donald Sutherland and Brooke
Adams played health inspec
tors, Veronica Cartwright and

Jeff Goldblum ran a bath
house): only their eccentricity
and guarded dealings with the
rest of the world kept them from
speedy metamorphosis into veg
etables.
Richter blends warmth and
idiosyncratic humor in con
stantly surprising ways, and he
is amazing at originating speech
rhythms: no two characters in
Bru baker sound the same, and
none of them talks like anyone in
Body Snatchers or Richter's
latest film. All Night Long, a
delightful comedy starring
Gene Hackman and Barbra
Streisand. Hackman plays
George Dupler. a junior ex
ecutive in the Ultra-Save Shop
corporation who. in a fit of fury
over a refused promotion, hurls
his boss's chair through a win
dow and is consequently de
moted to the night management
of one of the company's stores.
He hates his job. and his mar
riage to Helen, a humorless,
slightly pretentious woman
(Diane Ladd. who was the wise
cracking veteran waitress in
Alice Doesn't Live Here Any
more)i, and is as shaky as his re
lationship with his slobby, sen
sual son Freddy (Dennis Quaid
— he played tough-shelled, frus
trated Mike, who dreamt of
football victories in Breaking
Away). When George learns
that Freddy is sleeping with
Cheryl Gibbons (Barbra
Streisand >, the wife of a relative
(Kevin Dobson), he interferes
in their relationship and winds
up involved with Cheryl
himself.
Like most of Richter's char

acters, George is paranoid,
when his son. discovering that
he has been seeing Cheryl, tries
to assault him, at the same time
spilling the news of the fling to
Helen, George delivers a funny
speech in which he accepts re
sponsibility for all that has gone
wrong — including inflation and
the energy crisis and the unrest
in the Middle East. George is a
smart, sane man who lives on
edge because he is aware of the
sharks that are snapping at his
toes. It's a triumph for George
when he kicks those sharks in
the mouth — when he walks out
on his marriage and his job and
rents a loft above a factory to
work as an inventor. (He sup
ports himself by taking em
ployment as a singing waiter in
an Italian restaurant.) His re
bellion is akin to that of the he
roes of Depression comedies
who turned their backs on
wealth to quest for a more
meaningful existence (William
Powell in My Man Godfrey,
Cary Grant in Holiday, Ray
Milland in Easy Living), but
George's rejection of his as
signed role in society is more
convincing because it is final —
no inheritance is about to settle
magically on him, protecting
him and Cheryl for the rest of
their days. In fact, George s af
fair with Cheryl, lovely as it is,
is bound to be impermanent — it
has a gaily fleeting quality
about it.
In the newpaper ads. All
Night Long looks like one of
those tiresome love-hate sexual
farces George Segal usually
gets stuck in. It is actually so un

like them that audiences may
not understand at first what
they're watching. The plot is so
simple and the action so un
forced that it may seem that
nothing is going on in the movie.
Jean-Claude Tramont's direc
tion is graceful and uncluttered;
he often keeps his camera at a
distance, as if refusing to invade
the private space of the charac
ters At other times the camera
placement is so atypical — espe
cially in the store scenes — that
we are puzzled by it until we
catch on that he is offering us a
vantage point that allows us to
see the characters and the set
ting in unthought-of ways. And
without the excess narrative
baggage most romantic come
dies are forced to carry, this
loose-limbed, unfettered movie
takes on the shape of its charac
ters — George, Cheryl. Freddy,
and a wonderful group of
authentic screwballs whom
George encounters at work: a
pair of offhand semi-competent
clerks (Vernee Watson and Ste
phen Peterman), a bellhop
(Hamilton Camp) whose
purchase of a tube of toothpaste
prompts him to deliver a heated
diatribe on teeth and con
spiracy, and a bumbling, image
conscious store cop.
Both Hackman and Streisand
needed this picture, and they
make it pay off. Hackman has
appeared in nothing but turkeys
(and unreleased films) for the
last five or six years. Though he
has never to my knowledge giv
en a discreditable performance,
these movies certainly haven't
allowed him to do the kind of

work he did with remarkable
consistency in the early '70s. In
All Night Long, he is so under
stated that it's difficult to catch
him acting — but he is. He
hasn't been so sympathetic in a
movie since Scarecrow, and he
has never shown such crack
comic timing in a full-length
performance. (His scene as the
blind man in Young Frank
enstein surely evidenced his
ability to play comedy.) His
most charming moments are
the smallest ones: the way he
sits on a water bed, for example,
or his carefree singing at the
restaurant.
Barbra Streisand's career
has been more checkered than
Hackman's. In her first five
years in movies, she gave one
dazzling display of talent after
another, but the last of her pic
tures worth looking at was The
Way We Were — eight years
ago. In the blockbuster musical
soapers Funny Lady and .4 Star
is Horn she was so shrill and
megalomaniacal that it seemed
the worst had happened — she
had turned into a caricature of
herself, the sort of loud, irritat
ing actress her detractors had
always claimed (unfairly) that
she was. I walked out on her last
film, The Main Event, because
she appeared to have lost her
timing altogether, and the
thought of a movie in which
Ryan O'Neal was better than
Streisand was so depressing
that I saw no reason to prolong
the experience. As Cheryl, the
fluffy blonde seductress in All
Night Long, she seems like a
new actress. She is low-key and

delicate, when she walks, her
high heels point her small,
feminine movements, and her
hands parallel them. Cheryl
isn't especially bright (though
she is far from stupid), but she
reads a lot, and she repeats ev
erything she reads as if it were
gospel; Streisand so inhabits
this sweet, lightweight charmer
that we don't laugh at her — we
can feel the conviction in what
she says. It's a cozy, generous
performance — it suggests what
might have happened if
Streisand had played her classic
comic role, Doris the hooker in
The Owl and the l*ussycat, with
the gracious, introspective
softness she brought to Up the

Sandbox.
This movie has one of the
loveliest fade-outs I've ever
seen in a comedy; it also has a
neat scene in which George
shows Cheryl a mirror he has in
vented, one that reverses the
image. There's something
slightly loony about the way in
which Richter and Tramont see
the world: the pinpoint pleas
ures that most people (including
most screenwriters) don't no
tice are brought into sharper
focus, and the big deals — mar
riage, family, the work-a-day
world — are telescoped. In other
words, the image is reversed.
Maybe that's why I loved the
movie.


Lenny Anderson, one-time Stanford grad student turned song
writer and guitarist, will be appearing at INTOTO (1611 Stan
ford Avenue) this Saturday night at 8. Anderson's style shows
Chicago blues and Latin American folk influences, but is gen
erally mainstream American folk — he has studied with
Woody Guthrie and Tom Lehrer, among others. Herb Caen
thinks Anderson's music is "great stuff," so it can't be bad,
right?
