# Third World music fuses with tables and cabinets

### Tony Kelly 
Brian Eno and David Byrne
are dangerous folks to have
around a recording studio. Hav
ing worked in the past with
Roxy Music, 801, Robert Fripp,
David Bowie, Jon Hassell and
countless others on his Ambient
label, Eno — a self proclaimed
amateur musician — seems to
have made a career out of doing
weird things to others' music.
Most recently, he's been pro
ducing records for Talking
Heads, whose lead
er/singer/guitarist/songwriter
Byrne is also known as a
fearless experimenter with mu
sic. In a word, strange. Lately,
the two have shared a fascina
tion with Third World rhythms
and melodies — an interest that
resulted in a collaboration last
summer on some tapes of
African-influenced percussion
rhythms. This work heavily in
fluenced the latest Talking
Heads album, Remain in Linht,
and caused a dramatic shift in
the Heads' music toward a kind
of intellectual funk-rock. Now,
after lengthy legal hassles and
artistic delays, the original
tapes have coalesced into an
album from Eno and Byrne en
titled My Life in the Rush of
Ghosts. And you're wondering
why I had to go through this bit
of rock history before mention
ing the title of the album. The
reason is the same as the feeling
one gets after listening to My
IJfe in the Bush of Ghosts — the
record, amazing in its produc
tion and compelling on half of its
compositions, still sounds more

like a document of experimenta
tion than a rock album.
Of course, experimentation
was the explicit intent of the en
tire project. Eno, a leading rock
theoretician, and Byrne have
long been concerned with ex
ploring the meaning of rock to
unusual depths. On Ghosts, the
search centers around "found
voices'' — vocals taped off radio
broadcasts or Arabic records
and removed from their original
context. Supplementing the
voices are the sounds of hordes
of guitars, synthesizers, sound
effects, African - sounding per
cussion tools, and objects laying
about the studio, like tables,
tape boxes, speaker cabinets,
even the floor of the studio
itself-. I said they were danger
ous.
More importantly, no single
instrument is leading any song;
instead, interlocking riffs come
together to form coherent
grooves — sounds that don't
build, but open up to the lis
tener. The result in My Life in
the Bush of Ghosts is simply a
masterpiece of production and
organization, especially on Side
One.
The album opens with
"America is Waiting," a sort of
introduction to Third World cul
ture in more ways than one. A
radio voice occasionally intones
"Amenca is waiting for an an
swer of some sort or another"
while Byrne's familiar treble
guitar mixes with a throbbing
bass riff to give clues of the
songs to come. "Mea Culpa," a
dialogue between a smooth poli

tician and an angry constituent
during a radio call-in show, is
more of a typical Eno composi
tion, and would be similar to his
earlier "ambient drone'' rec
ords were it not for the crashing
drum pattern pushing the song
forward.
The tone shifts to a more
melodic line in "Regiment,"
with Dunya Yusin, an Arabic
singer, carrying an Eastern
sounding guitar through a basic
funk rhythm. Here, as in the
next track, "Help Me Some
body," the voices seem per
fectly suited to the record. In
fact, the latter, featuring evan
gelist Paul Morton, follows a
rather conventional song struc
ture of verses and choruses. Al
though the chirping birds in the
background still hint at the
Third World influence, Morton's
passionate speech makes the
track the most genuine song on
the album.
The last cut on Side One, "The
Jezebel Spirit," uses voice in a
different manner. It has the
most intriguing vocal — a tape
of an exorcism — but we don't
hear the result of the event. The
music is intended to take over
here; the voices are seemingly
left to convey feeling while lit
erally saying little. It may not
make sense on paper, but it
works on record, and works ter
rifically throughout Side One.
At this point, though, Ghosts
takes a turn for the worse in
terms of strict entertainment
value. "Qu ran," a recording of
a chanting of the Koran, is
slower in tempo than Side One,

with more effects fading in and
out. The sound is still Third
World, but the force of the ex
periment seems to be missing
Unfortunately, the trend con
tinues through "Moonlight in
Glory," "The Carrier" (Also
with Dunya Yusin), and "A Se
cret Life." In all these tracks,
the voices aren't arranged as
much into the structures, but
simply placed in and allowed to
meander along The result,
while still engrossing, starts to
sound awfully familiar Eno and
Byrne do better when they re
turn to English voices in "Come
With Us," but the feeling is still
one of listening to musical ex
perimentation and not ex
perimental music. There is a
difference. "Mountain of
Needles," the last composition,
is much like "The Overload" at
the end of Remain in Linht — a
layered but boring echo of Eno's
"drone" material. No drums —
no interest. A definite bummer
for the end of an album.
Even after Side Two, though,
it's hard not to respect it. Brian
Eno and David Byrne, attempt
ing to redefine the bounds of
rock music, have made an
amazing achievement in pro
duction by creating songs out of
non-musical elements. Getting
right down to the basics of lis
tening, most of it sounds great
too. I still would never trust Eno
or Byrne to make a normal
song, but then no one else even
goes near what they succeed
with on parts of Ghosts. Not bad
at all for an experiment in dan
ceable art.

long been concerned with ex
ploring the meaning of rock to
unusual depths. On Ghosts, the
search centers around "found
voices'' — vocals taped off radio
broadcasts or Arabic records
and removed from their original
context. Supplementing the
voices are the sounds of hordes
of guitars, synthesizers, sound
effects, African - sounding per
cussion tools, and objects laying
about the studio, like tables,
tape boxes, speaker cabinets,
even the floor of the studio
itself-. I said they were danger
ous.
More importantly, no single
instrument is leading any song;
instead, interlocking riffs come
together to form coherent
grooves — sounds that don't
build, but open up to the lis
tener. The result in My Life in
the Bush of Ghosts is simply a
masterpiece of production and
organization, especially on Side
One.
The album opens with
"America is Waiting," a sort of
introduction to Third World cul
ture in more ways than one. A
radio voice occasionally intones
"Amenca is waiting for an an
swer of some sort or another"
while Byrne's familiar treble
guitar mixes with a throbbing
bass riff to give clues of the
songs to come. "Mea Culpa," a
dialogue between a smooth poli

tician and an angry constituent
during a radio call-in show, is
more of a typical Eno composi
tion, and would be similar to his
earlier "ambient drone'' rec
ords were it not for the crashing
drum pattern pushing the song
forward.
The tone shifts to a more
melodic line in "Regiment,"
with Dunya Yusin, an Arabic
singer, carrying an Eastern
sounding guitar through a basic
funk rhythm. Here, as in the
next track, "Help Me Some
body," the voices seem per
fectly suited to the record. In
fact, the latter, featuring evan
gelist Paul Morton, follows a
rather conventional song struc
ture of verses and choruses. Al
though the chirping birds in the
background still hint at the
Third World influence, Morton's
passionate speech makes the
track the most genuine song on
the album.
The last cut on Side One, "The
Jezebel Spirit," uses voice in a
different manner. It has the
most intriguing vocal — a tape
of an exorcism — but we don't
hear the result of the event. The
music is intended to take over
here; the voices are seemingly
left to convey feeling while lit
erally saying little. It may not
make sense on paper, but it
works on record, and works ter
rifically throughout Side One.
At this point, though, Ghosts
takes a turn for the worse in
terms of strict entertainment
value. "Qu ran," a recording of
a chanting of the Koran, is
slower in tempo than Side One,

with more effects fading in and
out. The sound is still Third
World, but the force of the ex
periment seems to be missing
Unfortunately, the trend con
tinues through "Moonlight in
Glory," "The Carrier" (Also
with Dunya Yusin), and "A Se
cret Life." In all these tracks,
the voices aren't arranged as
much into the structures, but
simply placed in and allowed to
meander along The result,
while still engrossing, starts to
sound awfully familiar Eno and
Byrne do better when they re
turn to English voices in "Come
With Us," but the feeling is still
one of listening to musical ex
perimentation and not ex
perimental music. There is a
difference. "Mountain of
Needles," the last composition,
is much like "The Overload" at
the end of Remain in Linht — a
layered but boring echo of Eno's
"drone" material. No drums —
no interest. A definite bummer
for the end of an album.
Even after Side Two, though,
it's hard not to respect it. Brian
Eno and David Byrne, attempt
ing to redefine the bounds of
rock music, have made an
amazing achievement in pro
duction by creating songs out of
non-musical elements. Getting
right down to the basics of lis
tening, most of it sounds great
too. I still would never trust Eno
or Byrne to make a normal
song, but then no one else even
goes near what they succeed
with on parts of Ghosts. Not bad
at all for an experiment in dan
ceable art.

Brian Eno and David Byrne
are dangerous folks to have
around a recording studio. Hav
ing worked in the past with
Roxy Music, 801, Robert Fripp,
David Bowie, Jon Hassell and
countless others on his Ambient
label, Eno — a self proclaimed
amateur musician — seems to
have made a career out of doing
weird things to others' music.
Most recently, he's been pro
ducing records for Talking
Heads, whose lead
er/singer/guitarist/songwriter
Byrne is also known as a
fearless experimenter with mu
sic. In a word, strange. Lately,
the two have shared a fascina
tion with Third World rhythms
and melodies — an interest that
resulted in a collaboration last
summer on some tapes of
African-influenced percussion
rhythms. This work heavily in
fluenced the latest Talking
Heads album, Remain in Linht,
and caused a dramatic shift in
the Heads' music toward a kind
of intellectual funk-rock. Now,
after lengthy legal hassles and
artistic delays, the original
tapes have coalesced into an
album from Eno and Byrne en
titled My Life in the Rush of
Ghosts. And you're wondering
why I had to go through this bit
of rock history before mention
ing the title of the album. The
reason is the same as the feeling
one gets after listening to My
IJfe in the Bush of Ghosts — the
record, amazing in its produc
tion and compelling on half of its
compositions, still sounds more

like a document of experimenta
tion than a rock album.
Of course, experimentation
was the explicit intent of the en
tire project. Eno, a leading rock
theoretician, and Byrne have
