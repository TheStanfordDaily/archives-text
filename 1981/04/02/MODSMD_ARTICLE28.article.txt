# 'The Postman': a potboiler turns ponderous
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
James Cain wrote his taut, mean little potboiler The
Postman Always Rings Twice in 1934. Neatly plotted,
strung together with cheaply effective irony, and boast
ing dialogue that predated the tough exchanges of the
films nairs ("Oh, all right. I'm a hell cat, then. But I
don't think I would be so bad with somebody that wasn't
greasy"), Cain's novella was a natural for the movies,
and it was filmed twice in the '40s — in Italy by Luchino
Visconti (Ossessione, 1942, with Massimo Girotti) and
in America by Tay Garnett (1946, with John Garfield
and Lana Turner). The newest version, with Jack Nich
olson and Jessica Lange, has a convincing period look
— Nicholson wears the third-rate suits and fedoras
Dorothy Jeakins has designed for him with the sleazy
grace of a Depression railroad bum, and the director,
Bob Rafelson, has done a good job of recreating a deso
late, underpopulated patch of rural California — but,
oddly enough, it is weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid, lacking in drive.
Cain's writing has a fundamental trashiness that
works for it. His characters are violent, lustful beasts;
we don't care about them, but we are amused by their
bloody mating ritual, and we care about the rapid-fire
series of consequences to which their tangling leads.
There is so much brutality in the lovemaking of the
drifter, Frank, and the sultry, impatient Cora — the
sexually frustrated wife of the friendly Greek (John
Colicos in this version) who runs the gas station-hash
joint where Frank comes to work — that the murder of
Cora's husband Nick seems inevitable, and so does the
pattern of distrust, deception and jealousy that ensues.
However, Rafelson lingers so long on every scene that
the story loses its punch. Working from a not especially
skillful screenplay by the celebrated playwright David
Mamet (American Buffalo, A Life in the Theater, Sex
ual Perversity in Chicago), he embroiders sequences

that would be better left simple and direct (like the
opening, in which Frank, stopped at this roadside inn
for a meal, sees Cora and accepts Nick's invitation to
stay on), and takes so much time to make points that
the plot becomes difficult to follow. There is a classic
example in the murder scene: after the lovers have
killed Nick, rolled his car into a gulley and roughed
each other up to make the "accident" look authentic,
they have sex near the wreck — but only after a dramat
ic pause that makes nonsense out of the characters'
motivation and provokes laughter from the audience.
This sequence should be so fast that the sexual heat
clearly rises from the violence.
Although his reputation is based entirely on one mov
ie, Five Easy Pieces, which is over a decade old (he
hasn't been prolific, and few people saw either The
King <>112 Marvin Gardens or Stay Hungry), Bob
Rafelson is a "name" director and Postman has the
feel of an important picture. It's beautifully shot, by
Sven Nykvist, and well heeled; it's obvious that Para
mount spent money on it.(The ad campaign must have
cost a fortune.) All this prestige — including the casting
of Jack Nicholson — may account for the curiously ov
erweighted direction, which seems to be telling us to
study carefully what requires no more than a glance.
Rafelson and Mamet seem to think they are making a
character drama, a tragic romance; their efforts to
shape fierce, funny line drawings into full-blown
portraits end up selling out the two stars, who are
framed significantly no matter how insignificnt the ac
tions they perform. Frank and Cora are supposed to be
great creations, but they're not, and by the end of the
picture we've had too much of them. Jack Nicholson's
acting is very mannered here, and he might have had
the right idea; in a slighter, more stylized movie, his
performance might work better. (John Garfield's did.)
Jessica Lange, with her demon-possessed, inviting
eyes and tall, tight body, is more successful. Lange's

talent is inseparable from her sexiness: in King Kong,
she was a luscious screwball comedienne, and in Post
man her acting is tantalizingly physical. She holds
herself in angular postures that accentuate her neck
and breasts and hips, and when she opens her mouth in a
knowing half-smile one waits for the steam to come out
of her nose. Lange conveys such a sharp double edge —
danger and vulnerability co-exist so clearly in her —
that she keeps surprising us in the first half of the mov
ie. If she uses this edge too much and it gets blunted as a
result, the fault is mainly Rafelson's. Even in the sec
ond half, she does some wonderful things, notably a
drunk scene in which her jealous fury at Nicholson is
couched in cool, measured snideness.
Gifted as he was. Cain was a sly old whore who didn't
mind stooping to sentimentality if it moved his plot
along. In Postman, he lets Frank and Cora find marital
bliss — a highly unlikely proposition — just so that he
can break it up with the ironic twist that explains the
meaning of the title. Mamet and Rafelson have trun
cated the ending — in order to make the movie seem
more like a tragedy, a choice that of course doesn't
work anyway — and so it is perfectly reasonable for
filmgoers to leave the theater asking each other what
the hell the picture has to do with mailmen (At the risk
of incurring the wrath that accompanies unsatisfied
curiosity, I'm not going to supply the missing link; I
suggest that you consult the novella or wait to see the
1946 movie version, which the U.C. Theater at Berkeley
will be showing in a few weeks.) By the time the film
ends, it has become so diffuse and baffling (Frank's
brief affair with a wild cat tamer, played by Anjelica
Huston, defies understanding) — and it has travelled so
far from its best sequences (the most interesting sup
porting character, a gamesmanlike lawyer played with
glee by Michael Lerner, disappears quickly) — that
one's final reaction may be tired irritation.


Jack Nicholson, pictured here in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest," stars currently in Bob Rafelson's "The Postman Always
Rings Twice."
