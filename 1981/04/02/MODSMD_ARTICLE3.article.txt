# Zetes will be watched during rush
## 
### Karen Springen 
With rush beginning next week, at
tention will be focused on fraternity
conduct, and particularly on the Zeta
Psi chapter here, because the Zetes
have been under Inter-Fraternity
Council receivership in which the IFC
regulated their activities.
Last May, Row Director Diana Con
klin recommended in a report to Norm
Robinson, associate dean for residen
tial education, that the Zetes' housing
privileges be suspended because of
problems with excessive damages and
debt repayment. During winter quar
ter 1980, for example, damages to the
house were assessed at $2000.
But the Zetes, under former presi
dent Scott Pederson, took positive
steps toward reform. Damages have
been drastically reduced and the
house is "financially secure," IFC
president Richard David said.
"The house really cares," he added.
A main positive measure was a
move toward collective government
and responsibility. "We wanted to es
tablish a system of organization in the
house," David said. "The officers are
taking more of a position. Now the
leadership has means of being effec
tive."
Zete junior Steve Dawson con
firmed that members are more in
volved in the actual running of the
house than they were before this year.
As a significant positive step, Dawson
cited the fact that each member must
be on a committee.
David added that the Zetes set up
guidelines for conduct in in the begin
ning of the school year. Areas of em
phasis included house cleanliness,
government, attitude, pledge training
and rush.
In one case, Dawson said, initiation
practices were changed to eliminate
situations which would encourage
stealing.
The IFC, David said, does not plan
to impose special guidelines on the
Zetes "unless problems occur."
"Everything has to come from
within the house," said David. "Any
more mistakes and the house will not
exist anymore." Because a damaging
incident affects the status of the whole
house, it is regarded more severely
than if the same act occurred in anoth
er house, he added.
The improvement also stems from
the fraternity's desire to avoid the
negative publicity it received last

year, which may have contributed to
its failure to meet its quota of new
members.
"From our standpoint, it (the re
ceivership) is going fine," said Con
klin. "The damages have been really
reduced."
"The IFC has totally done it all,"
she added.
David said that the Zetes have their
own inspections, but the IFC usually
also inspects the house once a week.
Other house regulations include vot
ing to fine members who do not attend
the mandatory house meetings. Mem
bers are also fined for damage de
emed mischievous.
The Zetes had established a longer
history of problems with the row of

fice than the other 13 all-male
fraternities on campus. For example,
in 1978 Robinson placed the house on
probation for up to one year because of
initiation week activities.
"We don't have any fraternity right
now in the position the Zetes are in,"
said Conklin.
As a result, Conklin said she would
"not automatically think of the re
ceivership" if any other fraternity ex
hibits misconduct during rush.
All fraternities will have an IFC
representative at each rush function.
The Zetes will not have stepped-up
regulation, but David said that their
representative "will probably be me
in person."
