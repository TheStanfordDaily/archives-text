Brady continues to improve
Washington — White House press secretary James Brady, who
had a large part of his brain shot away Monday afternoon, was
soon moving one side of his body almost normally, breathing
without the aid of a machine, counting and answering when asked
his name.
How can this be''
The answer is three-fold.
First. The bullet fired by John Hinckley, Jr destroyed some of
Brady's brain cells. It damaged others, by causing swelling,
bruising, bleeding and complicated metabolic and biochemical
inbalances. It also simply shocked the brain cells
No one can predict how severe the permanent damage to
Brady's brain will be. and it appeared yesterday that medical
spokesmen were trying to somewhat modify the White House's
optimistic reports.
But some of the temporary damage and shock have apparently
begun to recede. "When there's a gunshot wound the whole brain
becomes unconscious," one informed neurosurgeon said yester
day. "We now see some return of consciousness "
Second. The right half of the brain exercises most control over
the motor activity — the movement — of the left side of the body.
The left half of the brain mainly controls the right side.
The bullet passed only through the tip of his left frontal lobe. So
Brady is moving his right side "very well, close to normally." one
source said.
But the bullet then did extensive damage to the right frontal
lobe and less damage to other structures as it continued its
course. "So he has some but still very little voluntary movement
of his left side," this source continued. "And it is too early to say
what may happen in future days or months."
Third. It is much too early, as one informed neurosurgeon
points out, to tell what personality changes or abilities Brady will
undergo. He could continue improving, he. uuld stay the same, or
he could suddenly get worse, dangerously worse, especially if in
fection — always a possibility in a "dirty" gunshot wound — sets
in or swelling for some reason resumes, instead of continuing to
subside
Haig to depart for Middle East
Washington — Secretary of State Alexander Haig. who departs
tomorrow for the Middle East, hopes to nail down the framework
of an agreement on stationing American forces as part of a peace
keeping force in the Sinai Desert, informed officials said yester
day.
He also wants to underline for Saudi Arabia the general U.S.
commitment to defend the oil-rich Persian Gulf against Soviet
inspired aggression, said the officials, who asked not to be identi
fied by name.
Haig will visit Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia during
the eight-day trip in addition to scheduled stops in Madrid and
London.

Atlanta police identify victim
Atlanta— The special police task force investigating the miss
ing and murdered children here identified a 22nd victim yester
day afternoon. He was Eddie Lamar Duncan. 21. whose partly
clothed body was pulled from the Chattahoochee River 30 miles
southwest of Atlanta in Douglas County around midnight Tues
day.
Two children remain missing.
Although Duncan, reported missing by his mother March 20.
was older than the 21 children found slain here in less than two
years, police said the circumstances surrounding his death were
too coincidental to dismiss him as a random homicide.
For one thing, he was discovered stuck on a tree limb in the
middle of the river — about two miles from the spot where the 21st
victim. Timothy Hill, was found last Monday. For another, he was
dressed only in boxer shorts. Hill and two other male victims have
been found wearing only underwear.
One factor that discounts Duncan's age is the fact that he was
slightly retarded with a speech impediment, most certainly less
streetwise — and more vulnerable — than younger victims who
ranged in age between 7 and 16.
Aid to Nicaragua cut
Washington — The Reagan administration, saying it lacks
clear evidence that the Sandinista government in Nicaragua has
cut off all arms supplies to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador, has
decided to retaliate by ending all further economic aid to
Nicaragua.
State Dept. officials informed congressional committees yes
terday of the decision to halt aid, which sources said was made
late last week. The action had been under consideration since late
February.
In some respects, the decision is a formality, because the re
maining $15 million of the $75 million in economic aid that
Nicaragua was to receive this year was blocked last January,
pending a review of whether the aid was going to the private sec
tor of the Nicaraguan economy, as directed by Congress.
That temporary cutoff also halted $20 million in food aid. which
reportedly caused hardship in Nicaragua. If it is not lifted, the
permanent halt to aid will block $35 million in economic aid and
$7.4 million in food aid that was scheduled for the fiscal year be
ginning next October.
Social Security cut rejected
Washington — The Senate, marching in virtual lock-step with
President Ronald Reagan on budget priorities, yesterday em
phatically rejected a proposal to scale back the automatic cost-of
living increases for Social Security and other federal benefits.
The proposal from Sen. Ernest Hollings, (D-S.C.), would have
saved $2.6 billion in fiscal 1982 by pegging cost-of-living increases
to a wage index if it rises less than the Consumer Price Index. The
increases are now based on the CPI. and many argue that it over-

states the effect of inflation on actual living costs, especially for
retirees.
Hollings' proposal was defeated. 12-86, with most Democrats as
well as Republicans refusing to go along with Hollings in tamper
ing with Social Security benefits, especially in light of Reagan ad
ministration opposition to any changes in the cost-of-living index
at this time.
Fire erupts at Caesars Palace
Las Vegas, Nev. — A fire broke out on the fifth and sixth floors
of Caesars Palace hotel on Las Vegas' Strip yesterday, but au
thorities said it was quickly extinguished. It was the third hotel

reports of injuries as some guests were evacuated.

Cape Canaveral, Fla. — The space shuttle Columbia, poised on
the launchpad and nearly ready to fly. was given final approval
yesterday to make its maiden voyage shortly after sunrise April
10.
Countdown for the first mission in the $8 billion program, beset
by problems for 2V 2 years, will begin Sunday at 11:30 p.m. EST,
acting NASA Administrator Alan Lovelace said after a 13-hour
Flight Readiness Review Tuesday and yesterday at the Kennedy
Space Center.
Cmdr. John Young and pilot Robert Crippen are to be aboard
the craft, flying it through 36 orbits of the earth over 54 hours, and
guiding the reusable craft back from space onto a dry lake bed.
