# University officials prepare for April earthquake drill
## 
### Bill Beyda 
First of a two-part series
Anyone observing the activities at the Of
fice of Public Safety, Stanford University
Hospital, the Department of Facilities and
Services or at President Donald Kennedy's
office at 10 a.m. on April 21, might think thata
devastating earthquake had struck the Penin
sula.
In reality, one would be seeing the Univer
sity's first earthquake drill.
The drill has been organized by the Earth
quake Preparedness Committee, which was
formed last August at Kennedy's request.
James Gere, a civil engineering professor
and co-director of the John A. Blume Earth
quake Engineering Center, chairs the com
mittee. Gere said the committee examines
the hazards that exist on campus and seeks to
improve Stanford's ability to respond to a ma
jor earthquake.
Police Chief Marv Herrington. who is re
sponsible for preparing the University to re
spond properly to a major earthquake, said

that the drill will involve one academic build
ing and one dormitory — rumored to be Roble
Hall — as sample earthquake sites, so as not
to excessively disrupt University operations.
Most of the student body will not be in
volved in the drill itself, but will be informed
by a public awareness program on earth
quake safety that will be going on simultane
ously.
"We chose 10 a.m. on a weekday specifical
ly as our time, because at this time the most
people are at the University — classes are in
session, and most of the faculty and staff are
present," said Herrington, who also chairs
the Department of Public Safety here. "If we
can deal with this, we can probably deal with
a night or weekend when less people are on
campus."
A drill was not part of the original plan, but
Gere said that when Jan Ehrenwerth of Stan
lord Hospital mentioned that the hospital reg
ularly held disaster exercises, the idea for a
campus-wide earthquake drill was accepted
by the committee and gained Kennedy's ap

proval as well.
Ehrenwerth noted that since earthquakes
occur without warning, advance planning is
essential.
"If we are prepared for an earthquake, it
will be that much easier to cope with some
thing like a hurricane that is predictable," he
said.
During the drill, the Department of Public
Safety will coordinate its activities from its
Serra Street office. The police officers on
duty at the time will determine what "dam
age" had occurred and where medical "help"
was needed.
Herrington said that a policy committee,
consisting of Kennedy and his staff, will de
cide on long-term matters, such as whether
or not to close school and, if classes are con
tinued, how to provide housing for students
displaced by destroyed dorms.
Facilities and Services will attempt to re
store utility service as soon as possible after
the simulated disaster, and the Medical Cen
ter will use student volunteers as "casual

ties" to test its ability to handle the emer
gency.
"You always uncover things you didn't
think of when you try out a new plan,"
Ehrenwerth said. "We hope what we learn in
this drill will help us save lives in an actual
emergency."
"What we are preparing for is a severe
earthquake," Herrington said. "It's what ge
ologists call a' 100 year event.' After an earth
quake of this magnitude, we can expect to be
isolated from outside assistance for any
where from 24 to 72 hours.
"Overpasses on the major freeways would
collapse, because most of them were built
before the 1971 San Fernando Valley earth
quake — that's when it was realized that the
design used at that time for overpasses would
not withstand major earthquakes. Our only
assistance would come via helicopter, and we
would use that only for severe medical emer
gencies because of its limited availability,"
Harrington went on.

Gere, whose expertise in structures and
their earthquake safety gained him an invita
tion to view the devastated Chinese city of
Tangshan last year, is optimistic about Stan
ford's ability to survive an earthquake
without much structural damage.
"The possibility of building collapse exists,
but is definitely remote," Gere said. "The
major danger would probably be from falling
objects such as light fixtures or ceiling tiles."
Gere's comprehensive pamphlet that he
co-authored with Haresh Shah, Earthquakes
— How to Protect Your Life and Property,
has already been distributed to University
employees. It is a major source of Public
Safety's new pamphlet to be distributed to
dorm residents in the near future, Earth
quake — A Guide For Stanford University
Residences, which describes many safety
procedures for dorm residents.

— How to Protect Your Life and Property,
has already been distributed to University
employees. It is a major source of Public
Safety's new pamphlet to be distributed to
dorm residents in the near future, Earth
quake — A Guide For Stanford University
Residences, which describes many safety
procedures for dorm residents.
(Tomorrow:, how a student should prepare
for and respond to an earthquake)
First of a two-part series
Anyone observing the activities at the Of
fice of Public Safety, Stanford University
Hospital, the Department of Facilities and
Services or at President Donald Kennedy's
office at 10 a.m. on April 21, might think thata
devastating earthquake had struck the Penin
sula.
In reality, one would be seeing the Univer
sity's first earthquake drill.
The drill has been organized by the Earth
quake Preparedness Committee, which was
formed last August at Kennedy's request.
James Gere, a civil engineering professor
and co-director of the John A. Blume Earth
quake Engineering Center, chairs the com
mittee. Gere said the committee examines
the hazards that exist on campus and seeks to
improve Stanford's ability to respond to a ma
jor earthquake.
Police Chief Marv Herrington. who is re
sponsible for preparing the University to re
spond properly to a major earthquake, said

that the drill will involve one academic build
ing and one dormitory — rumored to be Roble
Hall — as sample earthquake sites, so as not
to excessively disrupt University operations.
Most of the student body will not be in
volved in the drill itself, but will be informed
by a public awareness program on earth
quake safety that will be going on simultane
ously.
"We chose 10 a.m. on a weekday specifical
ly as our time, because at this time the most
people are at the University — classes are in
session, and most of the faculty and staff are
present," said Herrington, who also chairs
the Department of Public Safety here. "If we
can deal with this, we can probably deal with
a night or weekend when less people are on
campus."
A drill was not part of the original plan, but
Gere said that when Jan Ehrenwerth of Stan
lord Hospital mentioned that the hospital reg
ularly held disaster exercises, the idea for a
campus-wide earthquake drill was accepted
by the committee and gained Kennedy's ap

proval as well.
Ehrenwerth noted that since earthquakes
occur without warning, advance planning is
essential.
"If we are prepared for an earthquake, it
will be that much easier to cope with some
thing like a hurricane that is predictable," he
said.
During the drill, the Department of Public
Safety will coordinate its activities from its
Serra Street office. The police officers on
duty at the time will determine what "dam
age" had occurred and where medical "help"
was needed.
Herrington said that a policy committee,
consisting of Kennedy and his staff, will de
cide on long-term matters, such as whether
or not to close school and, if classes are con
tinued, how to provide housing for students
displaced by destroyed dorms.
Facilities and Services will attempt to re
store utility service as soon as possible after
the simulated disaster, and the Medical Cen
ter will use student volunteers as "casual

ties" to test its ability to handle the emer
gency.
"You always uncover things you didn't
think of when you try out a new plan,"
Ehrenwerth said. "We hope what we learn in
this drill will help us save lives in an actual
emergency."
"What we are preparing for is a severe
earthquake," Herrington said. "It's what ge
ologists call a' 100 year event.' After an earth
quake of this magnitude, we can expect to be
isolated from outside assistance for any
where from 24 to 72 hours.
"Overpasses on the major freeways would
collapse, because most of them were built
before the 1971 San Fernando Valley earth
quake — that's when it was realized that the
design used at that time for overpasses would
not withstand major earthquakes. Our only
assistance would come via helicopter, and we
would use that only for severe medical emer
gencies because of its limited availability,"
Harrington went on.

Gere, whose expertise in structures and
their earthquake safety gained him an invita
tion to view the devastated Chinese city of
Tangshan last year, is optimistic about Stan
ford's ability to survive an earthquake
without much structural damage.
"The possibility of building collapse exists,
but is definitely remote," Gere said. "The
major danger would probably be from falling
objects such as light fixtures or ceiling tiles."
