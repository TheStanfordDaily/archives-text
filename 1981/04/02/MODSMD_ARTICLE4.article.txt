# ASSU Senate approves fee assessment proposals
## 
### Richard Klingler 
The ASSU Senate determined last
night which fee assessment proposals
will appear on the April 15-16 ballot
and approved proposed Program Fee
allocations and Academic organiza
tion Board fundings. Newly selected
project and financial managers were
also approved.
During the two-and-a-half hour
meeting featuring often confused dis
cussions and heated tempers, debate
also focused on whether certain
assessments should have senate en
dorsement.
The Finance Committee proposed
placing 14 of the 16 organizations on
the ballot with the senate's endorse
ment. But the senate removed recom
mendations from all assessment pro
posals and stipulated that positive rea
sons for placing each recommenda
tion on the ballot would be included in
an ASSU pre-election brochure.
The senate also granted the Stan
ford Progressive Alliance (SPA) a
position on the fee assessment ballot
in an 8-4-1 vote, reversing the Finance
Committee's recommendation that
SPA only receive Program Fee funds
from the ASSU.
In extended debate, the senate de
cided not to endorse The Stanford
Daily's fee assessment request
through the Finance Committee, but
let the Daily request remain on the
ballot because enough petition signa

tures were collected to place it there.
The senate placed all fee
assessments proposed by the Finance
Committee on the ballot, then re
moved its endorsement of the Daily
fee assessment request, and then de
emed the petitions submitted by the
Daily to be requests for a referendum.
It subsequently rescinded the referen
dum designation, and finally left the
Daily request on the ballot by virtue of
the submitted petitions.
During this process, many Senators
were clearly confused. After designat
ing the Daily petitions to be a demand
for a referendum. Council of Presi
dents (COP) member Dick But
terfield said, "we might as well figure
out what we've done." Senator Rex
Sharp added. "It sounds like we voted
on something we didn't have a clue
about."
In what he later referred to as "a
moment of frustration," Butterfield
called for a fair fee assessment pro
cedure, saying, "This might be an
achievement of the senate, not that I
can think of one so far." Senator Ted
Mitchell protested and stormed out of
the room, returning in several
minutes accompanied by Butterfield
and COP member Nancy Takahashi.
COP member Marc Ventresca said
that the confusion surrounding the
proposals showed that the fee
assessment proceedure is an "out-
moded system that needs to be re
vamped."
The senate appointed Cynthia
Mathewson to be associate financial
manager. Project managers and as
sistant financial managers were also
approved.
The fee assessment proposals
scheduled to be on the ballot at some
time during 1981-82 are:
Boathouse; Volunteers in Asia (VIA); Program
Fee; Academic Organization Board (AOB), Le
gal Counseling; KZSU; Guest Professorship
Board; Chaparral; Speaker's Bureau; Graduate
Student Association; Creating Opportunities for
Students for Interaction with Alumni (COSIA);
Student Committee on Political Education
(SCOPEI; Publications Board; LSJUMB; The
Stanford Daily; Club Sports; and Stanford
Progressive Alliance (SPA).
