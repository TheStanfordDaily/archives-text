John Hinckley's
psychiatric tests
om the Daily wire services
Washington — John Hinckley Jr.,
his alleged murder attempt upon
President Ronald Reagan reportedly
spawned by infatuation with a teen
age film star, underwent psychiatric
tests yesterday over the objections of
his new attorney, a partner of famed
criminal lawyer Edward Bennett
Williams.
The tests were administered to de
termine whether Hinckley, the son of
a wealthy Denver oilman, is mental
ly competent to face trial on charges
of attempted murder of the president
and assault on a Secret Service
agent.
Justice Department sources say
investigators believe Hinckley was
"infatuated" with teen-age movie
actress Jodie Foster and wanted to
do something that would attract her
attention.
The sources said Hinckley wrote
an unmailed letter to Miss Foster in
which he described his plans to shoot
the president and said "I'm going to
do it for you." The letter was found
by authorities, apparently at the
downtown Washington hotel where
Hinckley stayed the night before the
attempt on Reagan's life.

Foster had portrayed a teen-age
prostitute in the film Taxi Driver, in
which a New York cab driver who is
fascinated by guns plans to as
sassinate a Senate candidate.
Meanwhile, a switch in defense
strategy developed yesterday when
one of Hinckley's new lawyers, Vin
cent Fuller, sought at a court hearing
yesterday to cancel the psychiatric
tests.
However, U.S. Magistrate Arthur
Burnett rejected the request.
Hinckley's original defense at
torneys, who were appointed by the
court, had asked for the mental tests.
Fuller gave no explanation for why
he opposed testing of Hinckley, who
has been under psychiatric care in
the past.
Fuller, a partner in the firm of Wil
liams and Connolly, also told the
magistrate that his client was willing
to waive a preliminary hearing
scheduled for this morning and have
the case go directly to a federal
grand jury.
Burnett, however, said the hearing
should be held as planned with
Hinckley present. At that time, the
magistrate said, the defense could
ask to waive the hearing.
Hinckley faces a maximum penal
ty of life in prison if convicted of at
tempted assassination of a presi
dent.

Position on gun
control may change
Washington — As a result of this
week's shootings, the Reagan admin
istration is backing away from its
previously announced plans to slash
the budget and manpower of the fed
eral unit that keeps track of the na
tionwide traffic in guns.
In the first shift of position by the
administration on a gun control is
sue, Secretary of the Treasury
Donald Regan announced that "be
cause of Monday's events" his de
partment is re-examining a proposal
to cut its firearms regulatory unit
from 87 persons to 29.
The unit, a part of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, han
dles applications from approximate
ly 180,000 gun dealers each year. It
also regulates gun manufacturers
and importers. The firearms in
dustry and the National Rifle As
sociation (NRA) have complained
for years that the unit requires gun
dealers to comply with too many
rules and to provide too much paper
work.
Regan told reporters yesterday he
does not believe the administration
will abandon its general opposition to
new gun control legislation.
Meanwhile, Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.) yesterday announced a
new effort in Congress to ban traffic

in handguns. Kennedy said that if
gun-control legislation he had pro
posed for the past several years had
been enacted, "the alleged attacker
of President Reagan could not have
bought his gun and shot the presi
dent."
Kennedy, in a speech to the Com
munications Workers of America,
said that "for America in 1981, crime
control means gun control."
The plan to scale down the fire
arms regulatory unit was contained
in the administration's budget for
fiscal 1982. The unit is operating with
$3.5 million in federal funds this
year, and the administration had pro
posed spending only $2.1 million next
year.
Appearing before a House Judi
ciary subcommittee yesterday, Re
gan said his department would have
to "rethink" this reduction. He said
it was possible that Treasury of
ficials might shift some money to the
firearms unit from elsewhere in the
department's budget, so that no net
increase in spending would be re
quired
A spokesman for the NRA said yes
terday that the Department of the
Treasury's firearms regulatory unit
is "a typical bureaucracy that tends
to grow and expand."
"If they were cut back severely in
manpower and budget, they might
become more efficient," the NRA
spokesman said. "They might not

send all these agents out on purely
regulatory matters that have nothing
to do with crime."
Reagan's shooting
upped popularity
Washington — The burst of gunfire
that injured President Reagan Mon
day sparked an instantaneous and
sharp rise in his popular standing
with the American people, according
to a new Washington Post-ABC News
poll.
The president was already com
paratively high in popularity, but his
approval rating showed a climb of 11
percentage points from Sunday, the
day before the shooting, to Tuesday,
when the new Post-ABC poll was con
ducted.
While it is common for a presi
dent's popularity rating to increase
at a time of national crisis, the rise
for Reagan appears to be as sharp as
any yet recorded. Reagan's new
surge came at a time when the presi
dent seemed to be on something of a
downward swing in popularity as
measured by previous polls
The attempted assassination also
served to increase the number of
citizens advocating stronger hand
gun controls despite a widespread
conviction that no law could prevent
an assassin from getting a gun and
attempting to take the life of a presi

dent.
In addition, the Post-ABC poll un
covered evidence of public dis
satisfaction with the performance of
Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
whose actions before and after the
shooting have made him a center of
controversy.
Reagan's condition
was downplayed
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan's life may have been in
graver danger after he was shot in
the chest Monday than was evident
from preliminary medical reports.
The president might have died of
blood loss and shock if Secret Service
agents had ordered him transported
to a more distant hospital, such as
Walter Reed Army Medical Center
or Bethesda Naval Hospital, rather
than driving him swiftly to nearby
George Washington University Hos
pital. according to medical sources
familiar with his case
Jerry Parr, the agent who dove on
top of Reagan after pushing him into
the limousine, noticed a trickle of
blood coming from the president's
mouth, the first clue that he had been
shot, moments after the car sped
away from the Washington Hilton,
according to Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan.
A doctor who was present con
firmed Wednesday that about two
quarts of the President's blood — be
tween one-third and one-half of his
total blood volume — flowed "at a
rather brisk rate'' out of the left side
of his chest as soon as the tube was
inserted between the chest wall and
his collapsed lung
Medical sources also said he in
itially showed some heart ir
regularities, and the surgical intern
who treated him. Dr. William
O'Neill, told a New York Times re
porter that the president's blood
pressure was only 78 — low enough to
signal impending shock.
