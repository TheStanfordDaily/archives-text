## Polish crisis may spark a showdown This Week's close call shows gravity of worker rift in Communist Party 
### Washington Post 
Belgrade — Once again, Po
land has pulled back from the
brink.
But as millions of Poles
breathed a sigh of relief at the
last-minute aversion of a gener
al strike planned for Tuesday,
they did so in the knowledge that
this has been their closest shave
so far.
At one point last week, Po
land's communist authorities
apparently came very near to
declaring a national state of
emergency. Had this step been
taken, it would have meant a
final showdown with the inde
pendent Solidarity trade union
federation — triggering a chain
reaction that could easily have
culminated in a Soviet invasion.
Even during the strikes last
summer, which gave birth to
Solidarity, the dangers facing
Poland were not as great as dur
ing the past few days. It is pre
cisely because the union exists,
and because of the national re
surgence that has taken place in
the country, that the stakes are
now higher. So, too, is the in
terest of both East and West in
the outcome of the Polish politi
cal struggle.
Unity
That Poland managed to
avoid a disaster this time was
due above all to the decisiveness
and unity of the country's work
ers. Other factors making for a
sensible compromise were the
tactical sense of Solidarity's
leader. Lech Walesa, some ex
ceptionally smart in-fighting by
reformers in the Polish leader
ship, and the moderating in
fluence of the Roman Catholic
Church.
The crisis is not over yet.
Monday night's provisional
agreement between the govern
ment and Solidarity represent
atives raises almost as many
questions as it settles. The hard
liners in the party leadership
have been blooded by wounding
criticism at a stormy central
committee session, but have not
been entirely defeated. And no
body knows how the Soviet

Union will react to the turn
around by the Polish authorities
in accepting demands that were
previously described as "un
justifiable."
The Polish Communist Party
leader, Stanislaw Kania, is still
in the position of a political
acrobat trying to walk on an in
creasingly shaky tightrope
while being jostled from all
sides.

week have proved is that both he

The Polish Communist Party leader is still in
the position of a political acrobat trying to
walk on an increasingly shaky tightrope
while being jostled from all sides.

Wojciech Jaruzelski, remain as
committeed as ever to solving
all disputes by negotiation rath
er than force. Reports from
Warsaw suggest that Jaruzelski
threatened to resign last week
rather than agree to a state of
emergency. This gesture ap
parently led to the hard-liners in
the ruling Politburo backing
down — and eventually being
forced onto the defensive.
The past week provided the
most formidable demonstration
of workers' power yet witnessed
in Poland. It was evident in Fri
day's nationwide "warning
strike" which, by all accounts,
was a complete success for Soli
darity. But. even more re
markably, it was evident during
Sunday's Central Committee
meeting when one factory dele
gate after another got up to
criticize conservatives in the
Politburo for obstructing
change
Janina Kosorzewska, a work
er in a computer factory, openly
admitted at the plenum that her
party organization had defied
the Politburo's instructions by
taking part in Friday's strike.
"We knew we were breaking
party discipline, but we also

knew that we belong to the
working class and can never act
against that working class," she
said.
Virtually all the workers who
spoke at the meeting accused
party leaders of being out of
touch with the opinions of the
rank-and-file. It was suggested
that the real "antisocialist ele
ments" in Poland are not the
dissidents gathered round Soli
darity, as the authorities insist,
but party apparatchiks in
terested only in hanging on to
their positions and privileges. In
a final resolution, Politburo
members were instructed to
meet with basic party organiza
tions as soon as possible.
The revolt of the workers on

the Central Committee, in re
sponse to pressure from their
own party organizations, helped
turn the tide toward the re
formers. But. despite calls for
new elections to the Politburo, it
proved impossible to evict the
hard-liners from their positions.
The meeting ended by passing a
vote of confidence in the entire
10-member Politburo.
What the meeting did reveal
was an open split between the
moderates led by Kania and the
hard-liners grouped around
Stefan Olszowski, the Politburo
member in charge of ideology
and propaganda. Never before
have the differences between
the two principal currents in the
party been so obvious.
In his speech, Kania em
phasized his commitment to set
tling all strikes by political
means. He talked about the need
to avoid conflicts with society
and the danger of events getting
out of hand. He also mentioned
the great surge of resolutions
from individual party cells
criticizing the Politburo and
calling for changes in the lead
ership
Olszowski, on the other hand,
staked out a hard-line position

as the defender of "real social
ism" — the catchword used by
the Kremlin for its own particu
lar version of communism. He
stressed the need to act in ac
cordance with Soviet policies
and accused some Solidarity
leaders of attempting to seize
state power. By identifying
himself with Soviet interests.
Olszowski made it exceptionally
difficult for the plenum to re
move him even though he is re
ported to have expressed a read
iness to resign.
The balance between the two
factions in the party was re
flected in a vaguely worded res
olution, which criticized Soli
darity but also opened up the
possibility of a compromise by
calling for incidents of alleged
police brutality against union
members to be fully explained
But, in the long run.the most
fateful decision could be to hold
an emergency congress of the
party by July 20. Elections for
delegates will begin immediate
ly — and, under new rules, they
will be held by secret ballot with
a choice of candidates.
The irony is that, if the con
gress goes ahead as planned, up
to two-thirds of the present cen
tral committee could lose their
jobs. Given the present mood of
the party, nearly all the hard
liners would have to go. That
leaves them with just under
three months to regain the in
itiative or face political extinc
tion.

proved impossible to evict the
hard-liners from their positions.
The meeting ended by passing a
vote of confidence in the entire
10-member Politburo.
What the meeting did reveal
was an open split between the
moderates led by Kania and the
hard-liners grouped around
Stefan Olszowski, the Politburo
member in charge of ideology
and propaganda. Never before
have the differences between
the two principal currents in the
party been so obvious.
In his speech, Kania em
phasized his commitment to set
tling all strikes by political
means. He talked about the need
to avoid conflicts with society
and the danger of events getting
out of hand. He also mentioned
the great surge of resolutions
from individual party cells
criticizing the Politburo and
calling for changes in the lead
ership
Olszowski, on the other hand,
staked out a hard-line position

as the defender of "real social
ism" — the catchword used by
the Kremlin for its own particu
lar version of communism. He
stressed the need to act in ac
cordance with Soviet policies
and accused some Solidarity
leaders of attempting to seize
state power. By identifying
himself with Soviet interests.
Olszowski made it exceptionally
difficult for the plenum to re
move him even though he is re
ported to have expressed a read
iness to resign.
The balance between the two
factions in the party was re
flected in a vaguely worded res
olution, which criticized Soli
darity but also opened up the
possibility of a compromise by
calling for incidents of alleged
police brutality against union
members to be fully explained
But, in the long run.the most
fateful decision could be to hold
an emergency congress of the
party by July 20. Elections for
delegates will begin immediate
ly — and, under new rules, they
will be held by secret ballot with
a choice of candidates.
The irony is that, if the con
gress goes ahead as planned, up
to two-thirds of the present cen
tral committee could lose their
jobs. Given the present mood of
the party, nearly all the hard
liners would have to go. That
leaves them with just under
three months to regain the in
itiative or face political extinc
tion.

Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity independent trade union, shown wearing a traditional highlander
folk costume last month while waiting for the Supreme Court ruling on a farmers' union.
Belgrade — Once again, Po
land has pulled back from the
brink.
But as millions of Poles
breathed a sigh of relief at the
last-minute aversion of a gener
al strike planned for Tuesday,
they did so in the knowledge that
this has been their closest shave
so far.
At one point last week, Po
land's communist authorities
apparently came very near to
declaring a national state of
emergency. Had this step been
taken, it would have meant a
final showdown with the inde
pendent Solidarity trade union
federation — triggering a chain
reaction that could easily have
culminated in a Soviet invasion.
Even during the strikes last
summer, which gave birth to
Solidarity, the dangers facing
Poland were not as great as dur
ing the past few days. It is pre
cisely because the union exists,
and because of the national re
surgence that has taken place in
the country, that the stakes are
now higher. So, too, is the in
terest of both East and West in
the outcome of the Polish politi
cal struggle.
Unity
That Poland managed to
avoid a disaster this time was
due above all to the decisiveness
and unity of the country's work
ers. Other factors making for a
sensible compromise were the
tactical sense of Solidarity's
leader. Lech Walesa, some ex
ceptionally smart in-fighting by
reformers in the Polish leader
ship, and the moderating in
fluence of the Roman Catholic
Church.
The crisis is not over yet.
Monday night's provisional
agreement between the govern
ment and Solidarity represent
atives raises almost as many
questions as it settles. The hard
liners in the party leadership
have been blooded by wounding
criticism at a stormy central
committee session, but have not
been entirely defeated. And no
body knows how the Soviet

Union will react to the turn
around by the Polish authorities
in accepting demands that were
previously described as "un
justifiable."
The Polish Communist Party
leader, Stanislaw Kania, is still
in the position of a political
acrobat trying to walk on an in
creasingly shaky tightrope
while being jostled from all
sides.
What the events of the past
week have proved is that both he
and the prime minister, Gen.

The Polish Communist Party leader is still in
the position of a political acrobat trying to
walk on an increasingly shaky tightrope
while being jostled from all sides.

Wojciech Jaruzelski, remain as
committeed as ever to solving
all disputes by negotiation rath
er than force. Reports from
Warsaw suggest that Jaruzelski
threatened to resign last week
rather than agree to a state of
emergency. This gesture ap
parently led to the hard-liners in
the ruling Politburo backing
down — and eventually being
forced onto the defensive.
The past week provided the
most formidable demonstration
of workers' power yet witnessed
in Poland. It was evident in Fri
day's nationwide "warning
strike" which, by all accounts,
was a complete success for Soli
darity. But. even more re
markably, it was evident during
Sunday's Central Committee
meeting when one factory dele
gate after another got up to
criticize conservatives in the
Politburo for obstructing
change
Janina Kosorzewska, a work
er in a computer factory, openly
admitted at the plenum that her
party organization had defied
the Politburo's instructions by
taking part in Friday's strike.
"We knew we were breaking
party discipline, but we also

knew that we belong to the
working class and can never act
against that working class," she
said.
Virtually all the workers who
spoke at the meeting accused
party leaders of being out of
touch with the opinions of the
rank-and-file. It was suggested
that the real "antisocialist ele
ments" in Poland are not the
dissidents gathered round Soli
darity, as the authorities insist,
but party apparatchiks in
terested only in hanging on to
their positions and privileges. In
a final resolution, Politburo
members were instructed to
meet with basic party organiza
tions as soon as possible.
The revolt of the workers on

the Central Committee, in re
sponse to pressure from their
own party organizations, helped
turn the tide toward the re
formers. But. despite calls for
new elections to the Politburo, it
proved impossible to evict the
hard-liners from their positions.
