## 
### 
Moscow (AP) —While the Polish Party Cen
tral Committee was deciding what to do in case
Solidarity called a general strike, the Soviet
Union issued on Sunday its grimmest
assessment of the situation in Poland, portray
ing its Warsaw Pact ally as tottering on the
brink of anarchy.
In a report broadcast throughout the Soviet
Union and overseas, the official Tass news
agency said Polish subversives had blocked
roads and destroyed road signs, had tried to
seize post offices and a television transmitter
and were working to intimidate police and se
curity agents.
A spokesman for Poland's independent
union Solidarity in Warsaw denied the charges,
saying. "Solidarity would never even think of
such things." Polish state radio, without refer
ring directly to the Tass report, said there
were no obstacles on the road the Soviet agen

cy mentioned and that the route was properly
marked.
Warning
Some Western analysts saw the Soviet re
port as a new warning that the Kremlin be
lieves the situation in Poland must be changed.
Western diplomats in Moscow have said re
cently they believe the Soviets are pressuring
the Polish leadership to crack down on dissi
dent and labor activists.
Breaking from its usual practice of quoting
Polish news reports, Tass reported directly
that Solidarity had issued "provocative" in
structions on how to seize factories and offices.
Tass said local Solidarity groups were trying
to discredit police and security bodies and
"lists of persons who are to be isolated" were
being prepared. It claimed the lists were being
drawn up of the home addresses of police, se
curity agents and people who own weapons.
