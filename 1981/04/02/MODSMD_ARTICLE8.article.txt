# Europe awaits U.S. support on Polish aid
## 
### Washington Post 
London â€” Western European govern
ments believe the United States is ready to
join them in supporting a multibillion-dollar
package of financial assistance for Poland
in its struggle to work its way out of eco
nomic and political crisis, officials in sever
al European capitals said Tuesday.
Although American sources stressed that
substantial technical and political problems
still must be overcome by the 15 Western na
tions and more than 100 banks to whom
nearly bankrupt Poland is already deeply in
debt, European officials said they now ex
pected U.S. support for speeded-up nego
tiations to meet Poland's request for a $10.9
billion rescue package.
The current deliberations follow a ten
tative settlement Monday that averted a
showdown between the Polish government
and its independent unions and a U.S. warn
ing that "suppression" of the Polish labor
movement would foreclose any further U.S.
economic aid.
But Western European governments, led
by West Germany and France, have re
portedly been pushing Washington to quick
ly join them in a commitment to help Poland
before it is too late. They appear to have
agreed in return to join the Reagan adminis
tration in emphasizing publicly that this as
sistance was conditional on Poland remain
ing free of violent repression from either
the Soviet Union or the hard-liners inside its
own communist government.
Meeting
A critical date in these deliberations
seems to be next Wednesday. April 4, when
representatives of the 15 Western govern
ments are scheduled to meet in Paris to dis
cuss a package of long-term refinancing and
new export credits for Poland.
A parallel session was scheduled the
same day between representatives of the
Polish State Bank and Western bank of
ficials. Bankers from 12 countries repre

senting 40 banks held a meeting with Polish
State Bank officials here Tuesday and de
cided to continue talks Wednesday. A
spokesman for the bankers said "a satisfac
tory solution can only be achieved through
calm and restrained discussion taking place
on a continuing basis."
Polish Deputy Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw Jagielski is scheduled to begin
talks about the Polish aid request with the
Reagan administration in Washington on
Wednesday after receiving a public promise
from French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing in Paris Tuesday of support for a
package of long-term financial assistance in
addition to immediate European Communi
ty food aid.
West German support
In Bonn Tuesday. West German Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt also gave public as
surances of his government's support for
both immediate emergency help and long
term financial aid for Poland.
Schmidt also reiterated that continued
Western aid to Poland was contingent on a
peaceful solution to its crisis.
"If it comes to the use of force, then it is
not only the credits which would stop, the
world would change," Schmidt told re
porters after a meeting with Irish Prime
Minister Charles Haughey, who was making
a 24-hour visit to Bonn. Both men em
phasized Poland's need for emergency food
and financial assistance. The situation was
so serious, Haughey said, that "food aid is
simply a necessity."
Tons of butter, meat, milk powder,
grains, sugar, edible oil and animal feed are
being supplied by the European Community
to Poland at below world prices with credit
provided by the 10 member nations.
European officials said a majority of
Western nations had reacted "positively" to
Poland's request for the $10.9 billion pack
age of longer-term financial aid. It includes
$3.4 billion in new export credits guaranteed

by Western governments, rescheduling of
payments falling due this year on $4.4 billion
already owed by Poland to Western govern
ments, and a similar rescheduling of $3.1
billion owed this year by Poland on un
guaranteed loans from Western banks.
Deferment
The representatives of the 15 Western na
tions to which Poland now owes an esti
mated $23 billion already decided at a meet
ing in Paris last month to recommend that
their governments give Poland emergency
assistance by deferring loan payments due
during the first quarter of this year. West
Germany, France and Britain are among
the countries now ready to extend it for an
other three months, according to govern
ment sources, while negotiations continue
on a package of longer term refinancing.
American officials and bankers are re
ported by Western European sources to
have been particularly concerned that
further financial assistance to Poland on
such a massive scale be conditional on an
acceptable plan for economic recovery.
Such a plan would be similar to require
ments for emergency reserve loans made
by the International Monetary Fund, of
which Poland is not a member.
In effect, Poland is asking Western gov
ernments and banks to be freed from mak
ing payments on its debts until 1986, when it
hopes to have turned the corner in rescuing
its currently failing economy. It is seeking
to reschedule payment of the debts due this
year over the next 10 years while paying
nothing for the first five years.
Polish officials also have asked Western
banks for an immediate, emergency loan of
$1.1 billion until the financial assistance
package can be approved. The banks' reluc
tance to agree to this has made the need for
speedy negotiatkons more urgent to prevent
a Polish default that could lead to the coun
try's financial collapse and the loss of all the
money loaned to it by the West.
