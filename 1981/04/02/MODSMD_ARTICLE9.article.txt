A brimming Lake Lagunita will host wind
surfers and barefoot waterskiers this Sunday
April 5 in the annual Aquafollies sponsored by the
IFC (Inter-Fraternity Council >.
The follies, expanded and revised from pre
vious years, will begin at 11 a.m. with a rally to
the lake by the LSJUMB and end at sundown in
Frost Amphitheatre with a performance by the
Greg Kihn Band. Activities at the lake include IM
events, a demonstration by the U S Coast Guard

The follies, expanded and
revised from previous years,
will begin at 11 a.m. with a rally
to the lake by the LSJUMB and
end at sundown in Frost
Amphitheatre with a
performance by the Greg Kihn
Hand.

and a showing of windsurfers and waterskiers.
Free beer will be provided at the lake and at the
concert in Frost Amphitheatre.
In the past, Aquafollies was a fundraising event
sponsored by the IFC with proceeds for the Stan
ford Hospital. But when the 1980 Aquafollies re
sulted in a deficit, it was decided to abandon any
attempts to raise money from the follies.
"IFC decided that Aquafollies would be a good
way to kick off spring quarter and fraternity
rush," commented Brian Swanson, coordinator of
the event.
"We're trying to unify the university socially,"
he added.
For these reasons, IFC has shifted the em
phasis of the follies to form fundraising to a cam
pus-wide activity which is free of charge and open
to all students and members of the community.

The event will begin at the lake with extensive
IM competition. Chosen from the preliminaries
which will be held today, IM teams will
compete in canoe races, a tug-of-war, and a new
event, the pole climb In the pole climb partici
pants will swim out to a greased pole in the center
of the lake and try to climb it. For the first time,
IM teams will not have to pay an entry fee.
"I don't think it's right to make people pay in
order to participate," said Swanson.
Following the IM competition will be a ski
show coordinated by Mike Mangiantini and wind
surfing in the wind provided by the U.S. Coast
Guard helicopter. Throughout the lake activities,
Coors will provide over 35 kegs of beer.
A highlight of the day's events, and a part of the
revised Aquafollies, will be a performance by the
Greg Kihn Band at Frost Amphitheatre. The band
will play at 4:30, following a 3:15 performance by
Murphy's Lawyers. More beer will be available
and admission to the concert requires only a Stan
ford ID.
The Greg Kihn Band, originating from
Berkeley, has grown in popularity in recent years,
and Swanson was happy to secure them for a per
formance,
"We contacted them and they were glad to do a
local smaller concert," he said.
The key sponsor and organizer of the
Aquafollies is the IFC, but with the increased fi
nancial burdens of making the event a free cam
pus activity, IFC recruited other funds and spon
sors to help cover the cost of $5900.
The office of Student Activities, the Residential
Education Office, and the ASSU all volunteered
funds to help, but the most support came from the
dorms and residences.
"The response of the dorms was very en
thusiastic," commented Swanson. "They were
really great."
