YOGONUT TREES
REAPPEAR
The Yogonut tree, thought to be extinct,
has bounced back. And it's full of those
special gifts that once made it a legend:
Apples, raspberries, raisins, sunflower
seeds. .. even little cups of yogurt.
Once found everywhere, the Yogonut
tree dropped out of sight due largely to a
public preference for factory food in the
1950'5. This trend has reversed itself,
however. A campus spokesperson announced
that the trees have been brought on to
campus for the good of all.
Now it's easy to protect the Yogonut
tree. And good tasting too. Because all the
natural things from the Yogonut tree are
packed into the Yogonut ' bar. Which is
packed in stores everywhere.
So enjoy the Yogonut bar. And protect
a legend, please.
Remember: Take care off it,
and it'll take care off you.
