# Aid for nonaligned nation in jeopardy
## Social advances buoy Tanzania's teetering economy 
### Washington Post 
Dares-Salaam, Tanzania — 'This country is going to
get a hard look" by the Reagan administration as it re
examines U.S. policy in Africa, an American economist
said at a recent seminar here.
For Tanzania, which receives more international aid
annually than any other African country, the examina
tion may well be crucial. For the world's poorest — and
nonaligned — nations, most of which are in Africa, the
result is likely to be taken as an indicator of President
Ronald Reagan's attitude toward the Third World.
By any standard of measurement, the economy of
this East African nation is in a mess.
The country, more than twice the size of California,
is operating "on a day-to-day basis." a Western
diplomat said. Foreign exchange reserves are suffi
cient for only one month's imports.
The possibility of mass starvation among its 18 mil
lion people increases daily as a severe drought con
tinues into its second year. Unless the rains start soon,
"we will face a serious famine situation." President
Julius Nyerere said last week.
Grumbling
Even though Nyerere retains a high level of popu
larity among his people, there is increasing grumbling
against his socialist policies, which in some quarters
are blamed for many of the country's ills.
African socialist countries are unlikely to be high on
the list of candidates for aid from the Reagan adminis
tration which plans to target aid to countries following
a pro-American policy.
Nyerere is Africa's most prominent proponent of
nonalignment. He has already criticized the United
States for its military buildup in the Indian Ocean and is
bound to escalate the criticism if the Reagan adminis
traton continues to soften U.S. opposition to white
ruled South Africa.
U.S. proposals to slow down $3 billion in grants to the
World Bank's soft loan program could also seriously af
fect Tanzania which last year received $125 million
from that source.
Tanzania — with a per capita income of $230 a year —
received more than $600 million in bilateral and multi
lateral aid last year.
Social improvements
Despite Tanzania's economic woes, the government
has registered impressive achievements in improving
social conditions in the 20 years since gaining independ
ence from Britain. Many of the improvements are the
kind U.S. assistance has sought to foster in the hope

that such progress helps to keep countries in the
Western camp.
Tanzania's educational progress has been re
markable. Adult literacy shot up from 10 percent in 1960
to 73 percent in 1978. one of the highest rates of increase
in the Third World. Neighboring capitalist-oriented
Kenya, often cited as one of Africa's few success
stories, went from 20 percent to 40 percent literacy
over the same period.
Primary school enrollment has increased from 25
percent of the school-age population in 1960 to a current
figure of 95 percent.
Similar advances have been made in the field of
health with life expectancy increasing by a decade to 51
years. Forty percent of villages now have clean tap wa
ter and 35 percent have clinics — both rarities at inde
pendence.
Trade deficit
On the other side of the ledger, however, the country
has been running an annual balance of trade deficit of
more than $600 million annually for the last three years,
causing a $300 million backlog in Tanzania's payments
to creditors.
After months of tough bargaining Tanzania last Sep
tember negotiated a $235 million balance of payments
support loan from the International Monetary Fund but
the IMF has already complained that the government
has not kept a tight enough rain on spending and credit.
In 20 years of independence "one thing we have not
done very well," Nyerere told reporters recently, "is to
change our agriculture." Last year's exports were lit
tle more than half the 1972 totals.
In a country where 90 percent of the population lives
on the land, that is a disaster.
Bureaucracy
Many blame the country's burgeoning socialist-ori
ented bureaucracy.
Finance Minister Amir Jamal calls that argument
"rubbish" and cites three basic factors for the dif
ficulties: the costly 1979-80 war in Uganda that over
threw dictator Idi Amin, the huge increase in oil prices
and the devastating drought.
The war, which at one point involved 40,000 Tanza
nian troops, is estimated to have cost Tanzania $500
million, including $300 million in foreign exchange for
arms.
"Any economy can be stretched." Jamal said, but
with the oil and drought problems, "what are you going
to lean on?"
In 1970. he said, a ton of exported tea bought 60 bar

rels of oil. Today, it buys 4.5 barrels.
Last year the country spent almost 60 percent of its
export earnings just to buy oil despite sharply limiting
consumption by closing all gas stations from Thursday
night to Monday morning and outlawing Sunday driv
ing. A gallon of gas costs more than $4.50.
Inefficiency and corruption
Critics note, however, that despite all the excuses of
fered by officials, government inefficiency and, lately,
corruption have also played major roles in the econom
ic woes.
A two-month-old investigation of corruption has so
far led to the firing of five senior officials, including the
minister of transport and the head of the country's air
line, although no criminal charges have been brought.
The number of government boards that market the
country's products have doubled in the last three years
to about 300 with a consequent escalation of adminis
trative costs which now consume 16 percent of the over
all budget.
The investigation revealed that administrative costs
last year for the Pyrethrum Board, which controls pro
duction and marketing of the flower byproduct used in
insecticides, were higher than the total value of the
crop. Nyerere suspended the board.
Because of the problems with the boards, the govern
ment is considering returning the marketing function
to cooperatives which were abolished several years
ago.
Asked why the cooperatives were abolished, a gov
ernment official said with an ironic smile, "Because
they were becoming too bureaucratic, inefficient and
top-heavy."
Socialist principles
Nyerere, however, holds firmly to his socialist prin
ciples and blames the growing corruption on the failure
to eliminate the capitalist system.
"I believe if we succeed to build a socialist economy
it will be basically uncorrupt," he told reporters. "The
private sector is a source of corruption."
"If we allow a few individuals to accumulate money
they will use the money to tempt others. So basically we
must abolish this," he added.
A Western diplomat, pessimistic about Tanzania's
ability to end its need for foreign aid in this century, ac
knowledged that it was too simplistic to blame all of the
country's problems on its socialist doctrines.
He added, however: "Tanzania is more socialist than
it can afford to be."
