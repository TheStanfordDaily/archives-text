# Numeiri berates Khadafy

### Washington Post 
Khartoum, Sudan — Sudanese
President Gaafar Numeiri said
Tuesday he was "at war" with
Col. Moammar Khadafy of Lib
ya and added "I think all the
world should try to get rid of
him."
Berating the West for toler
ating Khadafy because of Lib
ya's oil, Gen. Numeiri said "we
have to do something together"
to "get this man out of the gov
ernment by any kind of war, by
taking him out, by killing him."
Eschewing "interference by
a superpower," Numeiri also
said "we as Africans should
start first — the neighboring
countries should start first —
and we are a neighboring coun
try."
Numeiri also again expressed
interest in U.S. financing for im
proving rudimentary Sudanese
air and naval facilities, which in
case of Soviet threat against the
Sudan could be made available
to American and other friendly
forces, presumably Egypt's.
But he acknowledged he had
not raised the issue with Ameri
can officials here or in Washing
ton before disclosing publicly
two weeks ago in a series of in
terviews what he now said was
"just an idea."
The president's initial offer
took the diplomatic community
and the Sudanese political elite
here by surprise. The lack so far
of positive response from the
Reagan administration has
raised questions here about
Washington's true interest in
the controversial rapid deploy
ment force to guard Western oil
interests in the Persian Gulf
that originated during the
Carter administration.
Lack of infrastructure in
Africa's largest country — espe
cially in the interior where the
Sudanese would apparently like
to locate an air facility — ap
parently explain the U.S. posi
tion, according to diplomatic
sources here.
The thrust of Numeiri's re
marks reflected a personal
crusade against Khadafy that
has raised fears here of the
power of Libyan petrodollars to
subvert the financially strapped
Sudan, considered a more likely
Libyan tactic than frontal as
sault.
A Libyan-backed coup at
tempt in 1976 all but succeeded
in toppling Numeiri.
He said Khadafy had made
the Sudan his "number one
target" to convince other
African states that they should
not oppose his dream of creating
a Moslem empire.
He also reiterated charges
that some two to three hundred
Soviet, East German and Cuban
advisers were helping the Lib
yans in Chad as were some Syr
ian army officers.
