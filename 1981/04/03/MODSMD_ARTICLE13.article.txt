# Controversial code-making and code-breaking
## Scientists accept research grant 
### Eric Cornell 
Two Stanford electrical engineering pro
fessors. Martin Hellman and John Gill, have
become the first university scientists to ac
cept a National Security Agency research
grant in cryptography â€” the science of de
signing and cracking codes.
The grant may mark a turning point in
scholar-NSA relations, which have tradi
tionally been strained.
NSA, the agency responsible for develop
ing and maintaining the security of the se
cret codes used by the U.S. government, is
in a paradoxical position. It wants to en
courage research into cryptography in this
country, yet it doesn't want the powerful
code-making and code-breaking techniques
being developed to be used by other coun
tries. But the prospect of having research
suppressed is anathema to scientific re
searchers.
The conflict reached a climax last year
when Professor Leonard Adelman of MIT
applied to the National Science Foundation
(NSF) for support in cryptographic re
search and was reportedly told that the NSA
had directed that a portion of the work not
be funded for reasons of national security.

While it later became known that the NSA
had only asked the NSF to allow it to share
support of the work, the impression created
by the misleading information created con
fusion and an air of mistrust, Hellman said.
The "Adelman affair" caused many re
searchers to seriously question whether the
NSA should be accepted as a partner by the
academic research community.
"It was getting so people would be afraid
to read a paper at a convention for fear they
would be arrested under the Munitions
Act," Gill said
In response to the NSA's request for a fo
rum to reconcile the differences beteween it
and the academic community, the Ameri
can Council on Education (A.C.E.) formed
the Public Cryptography Study Group. The
system the group proposed, though it was
strictly voluntary, has stirred a great deal
of controversy.
Under the proposed plan, researchers are
asked to submit their papers to the NSA
before publication. If the NSA asks them not
to publish the work, it would be up to the re
searcher to decide whether to comply.
There would be an arbitration panel to han
dle disagreements.

"The NSA claims jurisdiction over all re
search, whether it has funded it or not. I'm
not sure I agree with that," Gill said "For
one thing, it's impossible to completely sup
press research of this kind All one needs is
a pencil, some paper and a sharp mind.
Even if one person's work is kept secret,
someone else is sure to discover it All they
can do is buy time."
Gill added that if the research in question
could potentially lead to the breaking of a
code in use, buying time could allow the
NSA to change codes.
Hellman said that in his agreement with
the NSA, the NSA was not granted the right
to refuse publication nor even to see the pa
per paper prior to publication. "There are
no more strings than with any other federal
grant." Hellman said.
Hellman's and Gill's research is not re
lated to military or diplomatic matters, Gill
said, but rather to personal and commercial
communications. As more and more data is
being stored and transmitted electronical
ly, "it is becoming easier, not harder, to
steal information," Gill said.
