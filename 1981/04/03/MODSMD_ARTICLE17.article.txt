## The
						tragedy and the pity of Central America 
### 
The focus of today's headlines
is upon both strifetorn El
Salvador, where the junta's land
reform policy constitutes the
heart of all controversy, and
Nicaragua's Sandinista-led
government and the extent of its
involvement with Cuba. The
problems that plague those
countries — declining export
prices, inflated oil bills, conse
quent diminished economic
growth, as well as increased
tension and violence — affect all
of Central America. This writ
er's recent visit to three Central
American countries — Hon
duras, Costa Rica, and
Guatemala — garnered ample
evidence for the proposition
that El Salvador and Nicaragua
are just the tip of the iceberg.
Honduras, the poorest of
American countries in the
northern hemisphere aside
from Haiti, is now formulating a
new constitution with free elec
tions to be held later this year.
But the country is hobbled by a
relative lack of arable land, an
unambitious land reform pro
gram that has carefully avoided
seizure of any Honduran na
tional's property, and an in
frastructure so deficient that it
has thus far deprived the nation
of its export potential for
lumber.
Moreover, the populace is in
creasingly aware of military
corruption and unsettled by the
arbitrary implementation of
conscription. One observer told
me of army "roundups" of
younger people emerging from
movie theaters - a policy made
necessary by the unwillingness
of Hondurans to comply with the
draft law.
As is true throughout Central
America, conversation in
evitably focuses upon the Unit
ed States. "We celebrated with
firecrackers the night Reagan
won," said a well-to-do Hon
duran businessman. But this
view is by no means
representative. A leftist leader
of the Liberal Party (it has a

narrow plurality as the result of
1980 elections) characterized
American intervention in El
Salvador as harmful and de
signed to support the "big. priv
ileged people" and American
business interests which are so
concentrated in that country.
And he spoke critically of the in
volvement of AFL-CIO sup
ported American Institute for
Free Labor Development
(AIFLD) because of its opposi
tion to moderate Christian
Democratic unions in Honduras
on the ground that they have
some Marxist leaders.
An increase in union-spon
sored stoppages during the past
year seems to reflect the tur
moil that has spread throughout
Central America. The same pat
tern has emerged even in demo
cratic and stable Costa Rica,
where inflation hovers at ap
proximately 20 percent (Hon
duras is about the same) and the
external debt has made the na
tion's currency worthless out
side its borders.
The price of oil is the princi
pal culprit. As in Honduras,
where United Brands and Stan
dard Fruit banana workers went
on strike last year for the first
time in a decade, it is im
possible to separate labor-man
agement relations from poli
tics.
Costa Rican industrialists
complain that they are con
fronted with communist union
organizational drives (they re
sist them fiercely) and not those
of the moderate Social Demo
cratic trade union movement.
The Costa Rican banana work
ers union's 48-day stoppage last
summer was triggered by leftist
leaders reportedly inspired by
the Nicaraguan example.
But Costa Rica, once a haven
for the Sandinistas when they
did battle with Samoza, has seen
public opinion turn against the
new Marxist-type government.
Although the Costa Rican Min
ister of Labor stated in an in
terview with this writer that in

dustrial turmoil has declined, a
Social Democratic politician
differed: "The communist-led
unions are restrained because
they don't want to see a
backlash against Nicaragua."
Despite some predictions that
its rate of inflation will double in
1981, Costa Rica's problems
pale into insignificance com
pared with those of Guatemala.
There is no part of that country
which is safe from guerilla on
slaught even though the rebels'
numbers under arms do not ex
ceed 2,000 (the army has 14,000
troops). Excessive pressure on
the land has made for greater
dependency and virtual peonage
for a growing Indian population
which is forced to leave the tem
perate central highlands to
work the coffee and cotton plan
tations on the steaming tropical
Southern Pacific coastal plains.
The right-wing Garcia govern
ment has offered land reform as
an answer. But this means re
settlement to the sea-level ter
rain of the northern province of
Petan — hardly an attractive
prospect for highland people.
Accordingly, the Havana-fi
nanced guerillas are able to
move at will through much of
Guatemala. Awareness of il
literacy and poverty has been
raised by access to the transis
tor radio (Radio Moscow as well

as Voice of America) which,
along with the bicycle and the
lightweight plastic water jug,
has transformed the expecta
tions of the average Indian.
The Indians supported a
farmworkers' strike last year
which resulted in a 180 percent
increase in the minimum wage
(the daily minimum is now
$3.20) — an amount which many
owners have refused to pay.
This has meant an acceleration
of violence in the rural areas,
i.e., guerilla executions of plan
tation administrators repre
senting absentee owners. Indi
ans who work at less than min
imum wage have also been
targeted.
What is particularly re
markable about the new-found
Indian solidarity is that it has
been realized in the teeth of in
creased use of hit squad as
sassinations by the right (and
the left also) against anyone
who speaks out politically. The
favorite tactic is that of two
men riding on a motorcycle, one
with a submachine gun, who
draw up next to the victim's
auto. "They are very efficient,"
says a Guatemala City
diplomat. "They always get the
person they want." Even non
political assassinations have
now become commonplace.
Lawyers and judges who dis

please the relatives of a crimi
nal defendant are the principal
targets.
The pity is that of all the Cen
tral American countries,
Guatemala may have the
grandest opportunity for ex
pansion and reform — unlike ov
erpopulated El Salvador, where
there is simply no more room.
But, regrettably, the lesson that
Guatemala seems to draw from
President Reagan's campaign
speeches is that America will
circle the wagons around its
right wing of friends when con
fronted with a left wing guerilla
threat — and perhaps even tacit
ly support an audacious in
tervention by Guatemala on the
side of the junta over the border
in El Salvador.
The tragedy is that America
is already identified with the
forces of oppression in Central
America — an image which
would be more firmly implanted
if the conflict is interna
tionalized. Defeat for the left in
El Salvador is unlikely to make
this problem disappear. As one
American dipldmat said to me
in Honduras, "The left may well
be stopped in El Salvador by
American military aid. That
only means that they will be
heading this way sooner.
