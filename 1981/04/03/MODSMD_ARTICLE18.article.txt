Peace and human welfare —
surely no one would admit to
being against those ideals. Yet
throughout history there has
been violent disputation about
just what those ideals mean,
and how they can be achieved or
brought nearer. Today, our
country seems to be polarizing
around differing interpreta
tions.
The debate over President
Reagan's budget is a perfect ex
ample.
Liberals find it easy to com
pletely lower the boom on the
Republicans. All prediction of
what Reagan's plan will ac
complish are subject to doubt

and to biased interpretation. As
a result, it is easy to believe that
Reagan's plan (although it is
surely unjust to attribute to
Reagan all the responsibility)
will end up benefiting the haves
at the expense of the have-nots.
But no one can claim to know
this as a fact. It is true that the
combined govern
ment/economic system has
been faltering; productivity has
been falling, unemployment and
inflation rising. Increased gov
ernment spending and govern
ment regulation of business
have no doubt contributed to
those problems. For someone
who wanted to believe so, the
facts could seem to indicate that
the Reagan budget is the best
way out of our problems.
Again, though, there is no way
to tell the future, no certain way
to assert "If A, then B." No one
knows what the state of the
country will be in one year, two
years, or four years. In the
absence of more substantial and
factual evidence, the only argu
ments that remain are emo
tional or drawn from previous
experience.
In the past, business took ad
vantage of abundant labor and
the absence of government in
terference by paying substan
dard wages.
In the past,when there was no
government opposition, hun
dreds of thousands of acres
were strip-mined and left as
waste-land.
In the past, dangerous
chemicals were produced, dis
tributed and disposed of with no
concern for the environment or
the health of those in the en
vironment.
These are just a fraction of
the "offenses" that the govern
ment took as its task to pre
vent. Reagan would remove
such tasks from the duties of
government. It is hard to doubt
that given the chance, many
people would not hesitate to re
peat some of these same of
fenses. Profit, as Reagan well
knows, is a very strong motive.
But who will listen to this kind
of argument? It amounts to a
character judgment of those in
power, and how can one expect
to convince them of their own
dishonesty?

The same problem occurs
with arguments concerning a
military buildup. No one knows
whether increasing our military
will make war more or less like
ly ; again, no one can predict the
future.
Nevertheless, evidence from
the past indicates that the gov
ernment is taking the wrong
tack. Once we were unques
tionably the strongest military
force in the world; once also we
used that force to lay waste to
the nation of Vietnam.
While Vietnam is not the only
example of the misuse of mili
tary power, it is certainly the
most blatant. By arguing that
Vietnam is a reason not to mul
tiply our military spending now,
I am really saying that I don't
trust those who are in power. It
comes down once more to the
simple phrase — "many people
wouldn't hesitate to repeat the
mistakes of the past."
But again, that amounts to an
attack on the integrity of those
in command; and how can one
expect them to listen carefully?
So what happens? At the very
time when there is the greatest
need for calm reasoning about
complex problems, there is the
greatest tendency for emo
tionalism to destroy com
munication. And the higher the
stakes become, the higher emo
tion runs.
The frightening thing is that,
in the end, decisions are made
by sheer weight of numbers.
Anyone who is aware of this, and
who believes firmly enough in
his cause, is almost compelled
to take whatever means are nec
essary to bring the numbers to
his side. This results in esca
lation, just as in wartime; each
side will be damned before it
will let an attack by the other
side go unanswered.
There is no way that the Rea
gan administration will be per
suaded by anything but brute
force. This leaves those who
would oppose it no choice but to
jump into the battle of ideas
with both guns blazing. The bat
tle escalates; the polarization of
the country accelerates. I only
hope that the country survives.
