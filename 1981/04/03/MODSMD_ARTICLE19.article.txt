## We all are victims in trespass of human community 
### 
I wonder if Ronald Reagan
will remain convinced of the
need to increase the military
budget after being on the receiv
ing end of a weapon.
A callous comment, you say?
A bit outraged at this sentence
laced with tasteless opinion?
Permit me to continue.
How can we expect a society
to control the violent crime of
which Reagan was but one vic
tim when our economic
priorities continue to bolster
both domestic and exported
weaponry? How can we begin to
monitor the distribution of tools
created for the sole purpose of
ending life without gun control?
How can we tolerate the daily
publication of statistics con
firming the rampant increase of
violent crime and then express
such shock when that crime is
aimed at the President?
The significance of the as
sassination attempt does not lie
in the determination of who ex
actly fired that gun. Whether

not Hinckley acted alone or as
an agent for another party is not
the issue. The fact remains that
killing has become a solution in
this country. A final answer.
Members of our society wit
ness the intolerable conditions
in urban environments, watch
our foreign policy materialize
as military aid, and sit through
the six o'clock news announcing
that funds cut from education,
food, and housing programs are
being spent on ammunition that
ends human life. The message is
clear: the government, the leg
islators, and the headlines are
investing in weapons.
We are permitting, if not
sanctioning, the use of force as a
solution.
Violence has reached
epidemic proportions. It is a dis
ease that plagues every mem
ber of society, if not directly
then through residual feelings of
fear that accompanies each of
us as we walk a deserted street
past midnight or double bolt the

door.
The type of crime is changing
too. It is no longer rational (as if
it ever is). An irrational tidal
wave of senseless shooting; of
cold-blooded subway stabbing;
of anonymous bodies discovered
in the forests.
We are witnessing an un
precedented trespassing of the
human community, and no one
is immune.
Certainly Reagan's shooting
was an expression of protest,
not an alley mugging, but the
fact remains that violence has
permeated the very skeleton of
our society. And, we are fright
eningly conditioned to its pres
ence.
We numbingly accept the
events of Monday. We wonder
how we can protect ourselves.
Not only as individuals, for that
would entail a karate lesson and
a can of mace, but as a com
munity.
Mace will not eliminate the
source â€” the angry, desperate,

inpoverished character that
pulls the trigger. The poverty,
the drug addiction, the tur
bulence sizzling in the streets
. . . those are the criminals. No
karate kicks or alarm systems
will imprison them.
The shooting of Ronald Rea
gan and the other victims at
tacked last Monday occurs a
desperate time in our history.
We must examine the act with
more vigor than the conse
quences. We must scrutinize the
provocations motivating such a
tragic choice of protest. We
must recognize that this event is
happening as a macabre na
tional past-time.

Our entire country is being as
sassinated. We are all, collec
tively, victims of the bullets
fired at our President. It is time
to arrest the real culprits: the
conditions that foster such vio
lence and the leniency per
mitting such fatal access.
These are not easy steps. Al
leviating our "social problems"
will require decades. But is our
responsibility to ponder over the
gunshots of Monday; to thor
oughly reject Hinckley's action,
and to search for answers that
create life, not destroy it.
