# Intercity conflict delays housing project
## 
### Monika Guttman 
The Stanford West condominium
project, a proposed development of
1300 apartments along Willow Road
between the Oak Creek apartments
and Children's Hospital, has placed
the University in the middle of what
appears to be a fight between two
cities.
Willow Road, which ends in the
parking lot of the Stanford shopping
center, separates the University from
Menlo Park, and yet the road itself is
under the jurisdiction of Palo Alto.
Thus any major improvements along
the road, including a controversial
proposal to extend the road through to
El Camino, must be approved and au
thorized by Palo Alto.
Yet city officials in Menlo Park said
they feel that Menlo Park is the city
adversely affected by the road not
being open at El Camino. And two
weeks ago the Menlo Park City Coun
cil approved a resolution by their
Transportation Commission which
says that the city should express "no
support" for the Stanford West de
velopment unless street improve

ments are made to ease traffic along
Willow Road. Among the improve
ments mentioned is the opening of
Willow to El Camino.

News analysis

"We're caught in the middle," said
Phil Williams, director of planning at
the University. "Menlo Park seems to
be expressing opposition at Palo Alto,
and yet we're the ones affected."
Robin Hamill, director of Univer
sity housing programs, said that the
traffic problem has been the "utmost
priority" in the planning process.
"While Menlo Park has no real ju
risdiction in this matter in terms of
prohibiting the development, we have
definitely taken every concern of
theirs into consideration," she said.
"We are neighbors, and the traffic
problem concerns us also."
The University has held a series of
open planning meetings within the
community to air suggestions and
complaints regarding the Stanford
West project. At those meetings many
people have mentioned the potential

problems created by additional hous
ing without significant road improve
ments.
"We've responded to the communi
ty request not to do any planning until
the open meeting process is complete
. . . thus we have no concrete plans,
nothing on paper."
Menlo Park City Council Member
Peg Gunn cited one study which found
that if Willow Road were extended
through to El Camino, 30 percent of
the traffic on residential streets in
Menlo Park would be diverted.
"The traffic on El Camino through
Menlo Park is the heaviest on all of El
Camino," Gunn added. "Palo Alto has
Alma to help relieve some of the traf
fic, but Alma meets El Camino right
at the beginning of Menlo Park."
"If you look at where the Stanford
West development is planned, you see
it actually has very little impact on the
city of Palo Alto," she said.
Yet many city officials in Palo Alto
said they feel that the road should not
be extended to El Camino. In fact, the
proposal has been considered by the
council on several different occasions,

and in several different forms.
• In 1977, the Menlo Park City Coun
cil approved plans to extend and widen
Willow Road from the Sand Hill Road-
Santa Cruz Ave. intersection through
to El Camino. The plan was rejected
by the Palo Alto City Council.
• In 1979, the Palo Alto City Council
approved tentative plans to make
Willow Road into a four-lane road and
to extend it through to El Camino. The
assessment district plans, however,
were defeated, and the plan died.
• Most recently, last February the
Planning Commission of Palo Alto
moved that plans to extend Willow
Road through to El Camino be taken
out of the city's "comprehensive de
velopment plan." This notion was de
feated by the city council, however, by
a vote of five to two.
Some Palo Alto City Council mem
bers maintain that extending the road
through to El Camino would "draw ex
tra traffic to the road, in addition to
any traffic created by Stanford West."
Palo Alto Councilmember Ellen
Fletcher said she was not willing to
barge ahead with the extension in light
of environmental impact reports.
"There are various projects going
on now, such as the extension of Cam
pus Drive through the University,
which may in fact alleviate some of
the traffic problems which might be
created by new housing," she said.
"Staff reports have shown that a lot of
new traffic would be drawn to the area
if Willow Road went through to El
Camino."
Betsy Bechtel, another Palo Alto
councilmember, said that opening
Willow Road to El Camino might also
encourage more industrial develop
ment out by Sand Hill Road.
According to Andrew Doty, director
of community relations here, both
Palo Alto and Santa Clara County have
a history of favoring housing in
creases.
Doty also said that Stanford is pre
pared to pay into the assessment dis
trict should the Willow Road extension
be considered.
