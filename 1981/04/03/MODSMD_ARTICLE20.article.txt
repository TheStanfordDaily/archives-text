Science needs faith
The Creationists are striking
at culture itself when they con
test the privileged status in our
science classes of evolutionary
theory. Almost no one. including
most scientists, doubts that it is
indeed a theory, since from the
modern viewpoint all we have
are more or less coherent and
persuasive theories. But this
one holds up so well, it's based
on such a massive amount of
consistent evidence, that it is a
sort of blasphemy against re
vealed creation, or nature itself,
to deny its power as
hypothetical truth, its struc
tural beauty.
On the other hand, the defe
cation of man and his constructs
has led to such enormous dam
age in our era that at the same
time that one is repelled by cul
tural blindness of the Crea
tionists one thoroughly under
stands their desire that the "re
ligion'' of science balanced in
some way. Camus, for example,
who was the opposite of ig

norant, believed that only the
sense of the sacred could limit
totalitarian horrors; Einstein
too saw that "science without
religion is lame." T. S. Eliot,
Malraux, Solzhenitzyn likewise
warned of the dangers of run
away secularism.
Carl Sagan, predictably, sees
danger in the new author
itarianism and calls for a conti
nuing "skepticism." As if the
dangers of that position had not
been amply demonstrated by
the Nazis (along with the au
thoritarian; they committed all
the excesses). Of course a skep
tical attitude is useful in inven
tion or creativity, but it ought to
be balanced with the nourishing
belief in our youth generally for
their spiritual health and sur
vival. Some leading scientists of
Christian persuasion ought to
come forward and speak for this
equilibrium (denouncing the ex
cesses of the Creationists too).
In an approximate way, Presi
dent Reagan seems to stand for
it.
A little reasonableness will

solve this one.

With regard to the recent "in
duction notice" created by Stan
ford Against Conscription
(SAC), endorsed by the ASSU,
and mailed to students:
Thank you, SAC and ASSU: -
for ASSuming that I cannot
make decisions on my own
without harassment. - for AS-
Suming I do not keep abreast of
current affairs and therefore
cannot take an effective politi
cal stance. - for displaying your
innate inconsideration for oth
ers opinions by resorting to
emotional "scare tactics." - for
reflecting the true nature of
your stand against conscription
(i.e., the need of a scared group
of children to induce peer sup
port in order to make their own
decisions.)
I hope these few sarcastic
comments serve as a small rep

resentation of my disgust at
your recent attempt to
"educate" the Stanford com
munity. Aside from exhibiting
the subtlety of a charging Rhino
and the taste of Alan Hamil, you
have managed to make an ASS
out of both U-and-ME.

The Administration justifies
our economic and military in
volvement in El Salvador on the
grounds that aid to the El
Salvador government is needed
to prevent further bloodshed
and the takeover of the country
by communist led rebels, and
that such a takeover would ul
timately threaten our national
interest and security.
While both of these argu
ments are open to serious ques
tioning, this is not the most im
portant issue facing Americans.
The most important issue is
this: when my tax money, my
body, and possibly my life are at

stake, who is it who decides my
fate. The answer must be me,
and only me. Not Reagan, not
Haig, and not a majority, even
an overwhelming majority, of
other Americans.
Of course Reagan, the El
Salvador government, and any
one else, has the right to try and
convince me to voluntary sup
port, in whatever manner I
wish, the causes they so fervent
ly expound. Perhaps after doing
this I will feel that it is in my
best interest to take action of
one kind or another. Perhaps I
will not. But no matter what
happens, our government of
ficials have no right whatsoever
to make that decision for me, or
for you. They simply should not
have by force what they cannot
obtain by voluntary persuasion

test the privileged status in our
science classes of evolutionary
theory. Almost no one. including
most scientists, doubts that it is
indeed a theory, since from the
modern viewpoint all we have
are more or less coherent and
persuasive theories. But this
one holds up so well, it's based
on such a massive amount of
consistent evidence, that it is a
sort of blasphemy against re
vealed creation, or nature itself,
to deny its power as
hypothetical truth, its struc
tural beauty.
On the other hand, the defe
cation of man and his constructs
has led to such enormous dam
age in our era that at the same
time that one is repelled by cul
tural blindness of the Crea
tionists one thoroughly under
stands their desire that the "re
ligion'' of science balanced in
some way. Camus, for example,
who was the opposite of ig

norant, believed that only the
sense of the sacred could limit
totalitarian horrors; Einstein
too saw that "science without
religion is lame." T. S. Eliot,
Malraux, Solzhenitzyn likewise
warned of the dangers of run
away secularism.
Carl Sagan, predictably, sees
danger in the new author
itarianism and calls for a conti
nuing "skepticism." As if the
dangers of that position had not
been amply demonstrated by
the Nazis (along with the au
thoritarian; they committed all
the excesses). Of course a skep
tical attitude is useful in inven
tion or creativity, but it ought to
be balanced with the nourishing
belief in our youth generally for
their spiritual health and sur
vival. Some leading scientists of
Christian persuasion ought to
come forward and speak for this
equilibrium (denouncing the ex
cesses of the Creationists too).
In an approximate way, Presi
dent Reagan seems to stand for
it.
A little reasonableness will

solve this one.

ASSUme
With regard to the recent "in
duction notice" created by Stan
ford Against Conscription
(SAC), endorsed by the ASSU,
and mailed to students:
Thank you, SAC and ASSU: -
for ASSuming that I cannot
make decisions on my own
without harassment. - for AS-
Suming I do not keep abreast of
current affairs and therefore
cannot take an effective politi
cal stance. - for displaying your
innate inconsideration for oth
ers opinions by resorting to
emotional "scare tactics." - for
reflecting the true nature of
your stand against conscription
(i.e., the need of a scared group
of children to induce peer sup
port in order to make their own
decisions.)
I hope these few sarcastic
comments serve as a small rep

resentation of my disgust at
your recent attempt to
"educate" the Stanford com
munity. Aside from exhibiting
the subtlety of a charging Rhino
and the taste of Alan Hamil, you
have managed to make an ASS
out of both U-and-ME.

Body tax
The Administration justifies
our economic and military in
volvement in El Salvador on the
grounds that aid to the El
Salvador government is needed
to prevent further bloodshed
and the takeover of the country
by communist led rebels, and
that such a takeover would ul
timately threaten our national
interest and security.
While both of these argu
ments are open to serious ques
tioning, this is not the most im
portant issue facing Americans.
The most important issue is
this: when my tax money, my
body, and possibly my life are at

stake, who is it who decides my
fate. The answer must be me,
and only me. Not Reagan, not
Haig, and not a majority, even
an overwhelming majority, of
other Americans.
Of course Reagan, the El
Salvador government, and any
one else, has the right to try and
convince me to voluntary sup
port, in whatever manner I
wish, the causes they so fervent
ly expound. Perhaps after doing
this I will feel that it is in my
best interest to take action of
one kind or another. Perhaps I
will not. But no matter what
happens, our government of
ficials have no right whatsoever
to make that decision for me, or
for you. They simply should not
have by force what they cannot
obtain by voluntary persuasion
