## Reagan recovery said 'amazing' but painful 
### 
Washington (AP) — Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, his re
covery called "really amazing"
from a wound that doctors say
might have killed him, probably
was struck by a ricocheting bul
let rather than a direct shot,
sources say.
Now in his third day of con
valescence, the president was
making "excellent progress
toward full recovery" but ex
periencing some pain, the White
House said.
White House counselor Edwin
Meese said Reagan may be re
leased from George Washington
University Hospital early next
week. And deputy press secre
tary Larry Speakes said the
president is still planning to
travel to San Diego, Calif., April
27-28 to meet with Mexican
President Jose Lopez-Portillo.
Reagan's accused assailant,
John Hinckley, meanwhile, ap
peared yesterday before a U.S.
magistrate who will hear the re
sults of psychiatric tests and de

termine whether the case
should be sent to a grand jury.
In the most optimistic medi
cal report to date on White
House press secretary James
Brady, doctors said he was
breathing without assistance,
moved both sides of his body and
uttered his first words since suf
fering a gunshot wound through
the brain in Monday's as
sassination attempt. He re
mained in critical condition,
however.
Contradicting earlier decla
rations that Reagan's life was
never in danger, qualified medi
cal sources said Wednesday that
the 70-year-old president lost
almost half his blood after he
was shot and doctors said they
"thought they might lose him"
in the first, anxious moments at
the hospital.
The sources, who insisted on
anonymity, said doctors in the
emergency room could not find
the cause of apparent internal
hemorrhaging and feared the

president was in danger of slip
ping into fatal shock.
White House officials said
they could neither confirm nor
deny the report.
On Tuesday, Dr. Dennis
O'Leary, dean of clinical affairs
at the hospital, said Reagan
"was in no time in any serious
danger. He was alert and awake
with stable, vital signs up until
the time he underwent
anesthesia."
Dr. Soloman Edelstein, the
hospital's director of emer
gency services who arrived sev
eral minutes after the presi
dent, confirmed that Reagan's
blood pressure was low but dis
counted suggestions his life was
in extreme danger.
Once doctors discovered the
small wound under his left
armpit, they inserted a
drainage tube and drew out sub
stantial quantities of blood from
his chest, the sources said.
Then, they began giving the
president five pints of blood by

transfusion and he was soon out
of danger, the sources added.
Authoritative sources also re
vealed that investigators now
believe the president was
wounded by a 22-caliber bullet
that careened off the door of his
limousine rather than by a
direct shot. Two bullets hit the
car — one of them smashing into
the right rear window and the
other hitting the rear door.
Microscopic traces of paint
have been found on the "really
mangled bullet" removed from
the president, sources said, and
the entry wound was more
ragged than if he been struck
directly.
Vice President George Bush
stepped in for the president
Wednesday at a previously
scheduled picture-taking ses
sion with a White House employ
ee marking 40 years of govern
ment service. "The president is
doing so well. . . . It's really
amazing," Bush commented.
Reagan has been spending

most of his time resting, read
ing and watching a wall
mounted television in his $234-a
-day room. The president's hos
pital compound, including four
private rooms and four semi
private rooms ranging in price
up to 5271 a day, has space for
his staff, Secret Service agents,
a communications center and a
sitting room for his wife, Nancy.
White House aides insisted
that Reagan remained in charge
and that no presidential de
cisions were being deferred be
cause of his condition. Any mat
ters requiring his attention will
be summarized and sent to the
hospital for action by Reagan,
but none have gone over since he
was shot Monday, Speakes said
Speakes said Reagan, in his
only official act Wednesday,
signed an executive order grant
ing lower tariffs to developing
countries for some products to
help them move into U.S. mar
kets.
An increasing amount of cor
respondence, including letters
from members of Congress, is
going to the hospital, he said.
