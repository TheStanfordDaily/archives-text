# Coal miners picket after contract fails
## 
### Associated Press 
Union coal miners seeking
to put the muscle on the coal
industry after rejecting a
proposed contract are shut
ting down non-union mines
amid signs that an end to the
United Mine Workers' week
old walkout may be a long
way off.
Roving pickets closed
down non-union operations in
West Virginia and eastern
Kentucky Wednesday, one
day after the rank and file re
jected by a 2-1 margin the
contract proposal endorsed
by their negotiators.
The miners, who struck
for 111 days in 1978, rejected
the proposed agreement
largely because of fear that
some provisions would
weaken the union and lead to
use of more non-union coal,
UMW leaders said.
"If they don't start talking
soon, it could be a long one,"
said Charles Fuller, presi
dent of UMW District 20.
"We don't have any kind of
strike fund or anything like
that."
In some places, efforts al
ready were under way to help
the miners through the
strike. A central food bank

was set up in District 2 in
Pennsylvania.
"Right now we're trying to
help the miners who have
been unemployed for a long
time," said Cheryl Wright,
vice president of the dis
trict's women's auxiliary.
Although the contract pro
vided for a 36 percent boost
in wages and benefits over
three years, miners were
worried about union security
issues.
"There are two things that
killed the contract," said
Cecil Roberts, vice president
of Charleston-based District
17, the UMW's largest. "That
was the first article, the one
permitting companies to
sub-contract out to non-union
operators, and the one re
moving the royalty on non
union coal."
The contract would have
eliminated the $1.90 a ton
royalty companies pay to the
union's benefit funds for non
union coal they process.

negotiated the agreement
with the Bituminous Coal Op
erators Association, could
not be reached for comment
Wednesday.
