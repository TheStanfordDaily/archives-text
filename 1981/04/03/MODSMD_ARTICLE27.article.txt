# Should see action against Cal
## Fallberg back at the Farm 
### Ivan Maisel 
Mike Falberg, the freshman tennis player who
looked as if he would join Mike Ivie, John Lucas
and Clifford Ray in the Bay Area "Should I Play or
Not?" Club, is back at Stanford, this time for
good. Or at least for the quarter.
After quitting the team (and school) twice last
quarter because of personal problems, Falberg
will be in the starting lineup today when the un
defeated Cards (6-0) travel to Berkeley to play the
Cal Bears (9-4) at 1 p.m. The lanky blond will play
at No. 6 singles and No. 3 doubles with Jeff Arons.
Coach Dick Gould was ecstatic about the play of
John Corse, Greg Hing and Mark McKeen last
weekend in Stanford's road wins over Arizona and
Arizona State. Before this week, it looked as if
those three men would fight it out to join Tim
Mayotte, Scott Davis, Jim Gurfein, Jeff Arons
and Scott Bondurant in Stanford's starting six.
But with Falberg back, the trio is relegated to
the bench. All this for an untried freshman? Not
really. Falberg had fought his way up the team's
ladder to No. 3 during last fall's challenge
matches. That proof is enough for Gould, at least
for now.
"He's playing pretty well, but he's not at his
peak yet. We'll start him out at No. 6 and see how
it goes," said Gould, who obviously wanted to say
very little about a delicate subject.
Falberg's teammates welcomed him back, no
questions asked, no grumblings coming forth. Ac
cording to Gould, this togetherness is the key to
the team's success, and why he is as confident
about this season as any in his 15-year career here.

"The guys who are not in the top six have a lot of
respect for those who are, and the guys who are in
the top six have a lot of respect for those who
aren't. Morale-wise, that is great for the team,"
said Gould, who then went on to praise his team's
preparation for today's match.
"We've worked our butts off. This is the best
working team I've ever had. They all want to get
better. They're a coach's delight." Gould said.
"Whoever beats us will have to play pretty well."
Though it is always a big match (as well as the
"Big Match"), Cal will not be that "whoever."
The 1980 NCAA runners-up lost their top three
players from last season (Scott McCain, Marty
Davis, Chris Dunk) to graduation. On the positive
side, four of their top six have started for them in
the last two years, while 1980 state junior college
champion John Sevely is among the other two.
"They're not as strong as last year," Gould
said, "but all their players are experienced." At
No. 1 is junior Mike Bauer, one of the nation's top
collegians and possessor of "the best backhand in
college tennis," according to Mayotte, who will
face him today.
Others returning from last year's starting team
are sophomores Phil Lehnhoff and Randy Nixon.
Though Stanford found him nearly impossible to
beat last season, Lehnhoff has fallen on hard
times this year, and probably will only play at No.
6.
Other starters for the Bears will be Israeli
native Yair Wertheimer and freshman Mark
Wooldridge, who will most likely play at No. 2.
