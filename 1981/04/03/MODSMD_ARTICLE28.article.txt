# Fencers nab 9th in NCAA finals
## 
### 
Stanford sent a full three
man squad to the NCAA na
tional fencing cham
pionships for the first time
since regional qualifying was
introduced in 1978. Though
quite inexperienced, the
Cards surprised many ob
servers by taking 19th place
in a field of 53 schools. It
marked the first time that
Stanford has broken into the
national top 20 since its 14th
place finish in 1976.
The three athletes who
represented Stanford were
senior Tom Brannon in foil,
senior Jeff Gueble in sabre,
and freshman Nick Blevins
in epee. The championships,
held at the University of Wis
consin in Kenosha, required
each fencer to compete
against nine other com
petitors in an attempt to
qualify for a final round of 24.
The qualifiers then fenced
all 23 of their opponents to
determine their final plac
ing, with each team's stand
ings determined by the com
bined point totals of its three
fencers.
"This grueling three-day
tournament is as much a
measure of athletic en
durance as it is of technical
ability, and only a fencer dis
playing a great deal of both
can hope to do well," ob
served head coach Jean

Helliwell. Both Brannon and
Blevins made the final
round, with Blevins finishing
a surprising 11th and Bran
non a respectable 22nd.
"None of our men had any
experience at this type of
tournament prior to
Kenosha," said Helliwell,
"and we would not have been
surprised if no one had made
the final round. Neither
Brannon nor Gueble fenced
before coming to Stanford,
but that is one of the factors
we find most rewarding
about fencing: it is one of the
few varsity sports left that
you can start in a beginning
class in college and be com
mpeting in a national cham
pionship before you gradu
ate."
Coach Helliwell said that
one of the most encouraging
things about this tournament
was that both Blevins and
Gueble will be returning next
year, a fact that could pres
age a considerably higher
finish in 1982.
This year's champion was
the University of Pennsylva
nia, followed closely by
Wayne State University in
second place and Colubmia
University in third. San Jose
State ended up sixth in the
championships, which were
held from March 19 through
the 21st.
