# Offshore drilling sparks controversy

National security and the environ
mental impact of oil development off
northern California were among the
dominant topics at Wednesday's hear
ing on proposed offshore oil drilling
leases, held at San Bruno's Skyline
Community College by the U.S. House
Subcommittee on Energy, Environ
ment and Natural Resources.
Despite Rep. Tom Lantos' (D-San
Mateo) opening caution that "it is
critical . , . to understand that we are
not dealing here with the issue of this
nation's energy resources, but with a
specific discussion related to one of
the most beautiful coastlines in Amer
ica,"the debate often went beyond the
scope of Outer Continental Shelf
(OCS) Lease Sale proposal 53.
(In February, U.S. Secretary of In
terior James Watt proposed to open all
tracts in OCS Lease Sale proposal 53 to
oil and gas exploration and develop
ment. The tracts include areas off the
northern California coast.
Watt's proposal reversed the de
cision of his predecessor, Cecil An
drus, to exclude four sea-floor basins
from the sale because of economic and
environmental considerations.)
"Protecting the coastline is impor
tant, but so is the need to avoid going
to war in the Persian Gulf," said Rep.
Pete McCloskey (R-MenloPark), who

expressed concern that a lack of in
creased domestic oil production would
jeopardize national military security.
Naomi Schwartz, vice chairman of
the California Coastal Commission,
commented that there was little cur
rent basis for an accurate correlation
between developing natural resources
and reducing imports, due to factors
of refinery capacity, drill ship avail
ability, and the type of oil likely to be
found in the basins.
"We are using a lot of very sim
plistic rhetoric to cover up a lot of un
answered questions," Schwartz said.
Rep. Toby Moffett (D-Conn.) also
questioned the relevance of compar
ing oil leases with military conflict,
particularly in view of Reagan admin
istration cutbacks in funding for home
weatherization, appliance-efficiency
standards, and the development of al
ternative energy sources. "If we real
ly want to talk seriously about de
creasing our reliance on OPEC, then
we wouldn't be slashing these pro
grams," he said.
"We are dealing with apples and or
anges," agreed Lantos. "It's absurd to
argue that including these four basins
has any significant impact on the U.S.
energy future. We are dealing with 15
percent of a relatively small offshore
sale."
Lantos was referring to United
States Geological Survey estimates

that only 15 percent of the oil reserves
contained in the OCS Lease Sale pro
posal 53 lie within the four disputed
basins.
R.F. Karshner of the Western Oil
and Gas Association disagreed with
these estimates, saying that "the only
way in which estimated resources can
be determined as reserves is by drill
ing many wells to thoroughly explore
and evaluate any region."
State Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-
Palo Alto), who has co-authored a res
olution urging Secretary Watt to re
verse his proposal to open OCS Lease
Sale 53, also testified at Wednesday's
hearing.
Sher was asked what harm there
