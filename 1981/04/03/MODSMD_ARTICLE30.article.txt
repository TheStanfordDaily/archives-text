# Women cagers net two recruits
## 
### Bill Beyda 
Stanford women's basket
ball coach Dotty McCrea told
the Daily yesterday that the
Cardinals will add two re
cruits to next year's roster.
These recruits, along with
last year's star Jeanne
Ruark-Hoff, may produce
"our best season ever," ac
cording to McCrea.
The first recruit is Noel
Hanrahan, a 5-foot-7Vj, 130-
pound guard from Bar
rington, Rhode Island.
Hanrahan was the Most Val
uable Player in Rhode Is
land, and started all four
years at high school, averag
ing 15 points and nine re
bounds a game. In her senior
year she averaged an amaz
ing 23 points a game.

In addition, Hanrahan was
in the top third of her class
academically. She was being
recruited by Virginia Tech,
Fordham, Rhode Island,
Northeastern, Purdue, Syr
acuse, and others, but opted
for Stanford.
"We first saw her at our
basketball camp," McCrea
said, "and were very im
pressed with her." Her ma
jor function will be "as a sec
ond guard now, and back-up
point guard to Denise
McGuire when Debi Gore
leaves," McCrea said. Gore
and McGuire had outstand
ing seasons at the point
guard position this year, and

the addition of Hanrahan
may make next year's team
unstoppable.
The second recruit is Mary
Bradach, a 6-0 American liv
ing overseas in Frankfurt,
Germany. She was Germa
ny's Class A League Most
Valuable Player last year,
and has averaged 18.5 points
and 11.9 rebounds per
gameat the Frankfurt Amer
ican High School. McCrea
also discovered Bradach at
her camp, and was im
pressed with "her athletic,
as well as academic ability."
McCrea sees Bradach s
main role as a "forward, and
a strong rebounder to help
out Kim Kupferer and Louise
Smith."
The Cardinals finished this
season with a tremendous
series of wins against teams
like first place California,
but were unable to qualify for
the WAIAW Regionals.
Though the Cards are losing
senior Kathy Murphy, they
are regaining Ruark-Hoff.
Ruark-Hoff is the Cardinals
all-time leading scorer and
rebounder, but did not attend
Stanford this year. Her re
turn, along with Hanrahan
and Bradach, makes McCrea
very optimistic about next
season.
"We were hard to beat at
the end of this season; next
year we'll be very strong,"
McCrea said, "It may be our
best season ever."
