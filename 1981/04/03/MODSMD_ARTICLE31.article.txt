## Diamond dwellers dump Riverside 
### Ralph Walker 
The 1927 New York Yankees
were given the name "5 o'clock
lightning" because of their ten
dency to suddenly come from
behind in late innings and win
games with extra base hits.
The Stanford baseball team
doesn't exactly have hitters the
likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig,
and Stan Musial, but it seems to
have developed the habit of
staging similar comebacks.
One example of this was the
Cardinals' 10-8 victory over the
UC-Riverside Highlanders
Wednesday afternoon at Sunken
Diamond.
Down 7-3 in the fifth inning,
the Cardinal batters smacked
four of an eventual five home
runs in a space of three frames
en route to their 22nd victory of
the season.
Riverside took a 2-0 lead in
the first inning aided by two
straight bases of balls by
Cardinal pitcher Paul Grame.
Stanford struck right back in its
half of the inning on shortstop
Dave Meier's three-run homer,
his third of the year. All was
quiet until the fourth inning
when Riverside capitalized on

two errors by Meier to score
five unearned runs, off of Lee
Cline.
Realizing that Riverside was
about to make them April Fools,
the Cardinals closed a 7-3
margin to only two runs when
John Elway hit a two-run homer
in the fifth.
Phil Wilson led off the follow
ing frame with his second home
run of the year. He was followed
by Mike Dotterer, who tripled
and then scored on a wild pitch
two outs later to tie the score.
Catcher Bob Hausladen singled,
and up stepped Meier. He re
deemed the two errors by
smashing his second homer of
the day to put the Cardinals up
9-7.
Ironically, all four of Meier's
home runs this season have
come during or immediately af
ter his worst defensive per
formances.
Both teams finished by scor
ing one run in the seventh. Riv
erside combined a walk, single;
sacrifice, and an infield out to
close the gap to 9-8. Loring
Davies, however, got the run
back in one swing by clouting a
tremendous homer far over the
scoreboard in right-centerfield.
