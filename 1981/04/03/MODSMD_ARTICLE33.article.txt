# Card nine faces Cal in 'Big Series'
## 
### Ralph Walker 
The Stanford baseball team goes into battle with Cal this weekend
in the "Big Series" having had more than its share, it seems, of in
juries. Indeed, the Cards have sustained enough to keep Johnson
and ■Johnson from discontinuing its line of adhesive tape in the near
future.
"I don't think I've ever had a team that has suffered as many in
juries," said coach Mark Marquess.
Among those out of action are infielder Steve Buechele (sepa
rated shoulder) and pitchers Brian Mignano and George Lopez
<sore arms) In addition, every member of the regular infield (Lor
ing Davies. Bob DeCosta. Dave Meier and John Elway) has either
been hurt or is playing hurt. Freshman pitcher Brian Myers had to
leave yesterday's game due to a sore wing
It is thus understandable why the Cards' play this year has been a

bit more erratic than usual. Both the hitting and especially the de
fense has tended to range from being spectacular to appearing im
potent at times.
But the overall picture is far from gloomy. The Cards have al
ready eclipsed their home run total of last year, are hitting .322 as a
team, and are averaging a productive 7.6 runs per game. The
pitching has noticably improved, and the mound corps boasts a
team ERA of 3.94, as compared to last year's 4.52 mark in the same
category.
So despite the rash of injuries. Stanford can enter its series with
California optimistically.
"We're ready to play," stated Marquess.
The Cards had best be. as only one-half game separates the teams
in the Southern Division of the Pac-10 in the race for second place.
Arizona stands at 6-6, while Stanford, Cal, and USC have all won five
out of eleven contests.
