### Sally Jenkins 
The Stanford men's vol
leyball team lost, lost, and
lost again to No. 1 ranked
UCLA Wednesday night at
Maples Pavilion. The Bruins
did everything but jump the
net and physically club the
Cardinals as they won in
three straight games, 15-6,
15-11, 15-6.
Stanford held off UCLA for
all of one hour and 15 minutes
in the three-game sweep.
The less than stalwart
Cardinal defense almost im
mediately found itself at the
mercy of Bruin setter Karch
Kiraly, a three-time All-
America, and hitter Mark
Slevcove, who had over 20
spikes.
The Bruins are now 18-2
overall and 9-1 in California
Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association conference play.
They are the undisputed fa
vorites to win the NCAA
Championship title.
The UCLA squad lived up
to its reputation as a cham
pionship team, but may have
developed another one at the
same time, for cham
pionship caliber un
sportsmanlike conduct. Fans
sitting in Maples Pavilion
heard members of the team
utter niceties like "Coach,
maybe we ought to hit the
ball out for a while," with re
gard to Stanford's per
formance.
