Travel guides. You know em,
right? "Some say the best inex
pensive accommodations in
Rome are found at the Pensione
Bellagucci (42 Via Giovanni
Paolo Due). Signore and
Signora Bellagucci will greet
you smilingly at the front desk,
providing you with a map of the
city and a key to your room. This
is a good chance to practice your
grazie (pronounced grotz-ee
ay). Say, 'Orazie Signore e
Signora Bellagucci.' They will
laugh and gesture a lot; they
don't speak English. But Loret
ta, their young and nubile
daughter, does, and she will in
form you smilingly that showers
cost an extra 800 lira (pro
nounced lear-a). "
Yeah, you know 'em. "Ah
Istanbul! Pearl of the Orient!
Crossroads to Asia! Echoing of
Constantinople! Reeking of
Byzantium! Attababy, At-

taturk!"
Ugly breed, travel guides
Forget em, right?
Wrong. There's a new travel
guide in town, The On-Your-
Own Ouide to Asia It's put out
by Volunteers in Asia, and it's a
good one. Why? First, it covers
places in which even the most
adventurous traveller could use
a reliable guide, and reliable
guides for much of the continent
are hard to find. Second, it con
tains only relevant information,
written in a style that manages
to be colloquial without sound
ing chatty, or cute. And third, it
shows a remarkable concern
and respect for the native as
well as the traveller.
The On-Your-Own Ouide
takes the reader on a tour of
such regular Asian stops as
Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the
Phillipines and Singapore, along
with the more out-of-the-way
Macau, Malaysia, South Korea,
Indonesia, and Thailand.
There's also a tip of the hat to
the People's Republic.
It talks the usual travel book
jive, providing tips on exchange

rates, accommodations, modes
of travel to and within the cities,
hotspots for shopping and eat
ing. nightlife and the rest. It
also contains pocket histories of
each stop on the tour, and even a
little political commentary
("Hong Kong's bustling laissez
faire economy would surely
make Adam Smith proud,
though the price of success has
been paid in low wages, long
hours, and cramped working
conditions for much of the work
force").
This book omits much of the
gratuitous information (shop
keeper's nicknames, how the
writer was feeling the day he
wrote his piece) that fills many
travel guides. Perhaps it
doesn't need the filler com
ments because there are so
many unusual (to the West
erner) things to experience that
the sights and activities speak
for themselves.
For example, a crucial ex
perience for American trav
ellers in Japan is a visit to
Hiroshima's Peace Memorial
Museum, where there is a per-

manent exhibit featuring photo
graphs of the city and its inhabi
tants following devastation by
the atomic bomb. A "brutally
honest" film (in English) about
the bomb and its effects comple
ments the exhibit.
On the lighter side, on Bali,
you can witness any of a myriad
of religious festivals dedicated
to deities as diverse as metal ob
jects, and percussion instru
ments. The Snake Temple, in
Malaysia, features dozens of
vipers who "doze on altars or
crossbars, or loop themselves
across the branches of potted
plants."
But perhaps even more im
portant than the things to do and
see are the ways to do and see
them. On its opening page, the
On-Ynur-Owri (iuide informs
the traveller: "Though you
can't completely avoid making
mistakes, and generally people
will be quite tolerant. . . you do
have some obligation to be min
imally disruptive in the places
you visit." Obligation? Ameri
cans have obligations in other
countries? What a novel con

cept: a travel guide with a sense
of responsibility.
For each major stop on the
tour, there is a section entitled
"Culture and Customs," which
not only tells you what the cul
ture and customs are, but how
not to step all over them while
you are a guest in the country. In
Indonesia, for example, couples
should refrain from overt dis
plays of sexual affection, and
both men and women should
save their bathing suits for the
beach â€” the only place they
won't be thought offensive. It
may sound funny, but it is insult
ing to point to someone with
your foot, and the left hand
(which is considered unclean)
should never be used to receive
something or touch someone.
Concerning religious ceremo
nies in any country, it is impor
tant to make sure you are
wanted before you watch what
may be a private ritual per
formed. Here, the sections on
language (complete with a

viable pronunciation key) will
come in handy. There are com
ments on how to politely accept
or reject offers of kindness or
service.
There's even a section on
items to bring from home as
gifts for the helpful people you
will surely run across. Grat
itude runs deeper than a simple
grotz-ee-ay, and this book won't
let you get away with anything
less than the real thing.
The Volunteers in Asia are
not the four-star motel fans and
opulent backpackers who often
write travel guides. They live
and work within Asian cultures
for a year or two at a time, and
perhaps this is why their book
exhibits such a sensitivity to the
needs of the indigenous peoples.
The ()n-Your-()wn Guide to
Asia just might be the best
travel guide on the market.
Check it out before you go, and
refer to it often as you travel.
