"Brain and brain, what is brain?"
— Kara in Spock's Brain
Robin Cook is that rare entity, a doctor who has
found the time to do something else besides treat
ing influenza patients and operating on adenoids.
Brain is the third novel by Boston surgeon Cook,
and it's a paranoid medical thriller after the
model of Coma, his first hugely successful novel.
Coma, if you recall, made its mark on the
bestseller list about four years ago, and was
quickly transformed into a taut, suspenseful mov
ie by Michael Crichton, another physician-turned
writer and master of the medical thriller (The
Andromeda Strain). Audiences were stunned by
Cook's dark view of the medical profession: at
Coma's fictional Boston Memorial Hospital,
some of the doctors have been quietly slicing up
perfectly healthy patients and selling their spare
parts on the black market. Most of us are terrified
of hospitals and white-coated surgeons under the
best of circumstances, and this kind of grisly
scenario shamelessly plays on our weaknesses:
Cook's medical background lends a ring of authen
ticity that makes it all seem horribly plausible,
despite holes big enough to drive an ambulance
through. For example, just where is this market
for pirated hearts, lungs and kidneys''
Although praised for his imagination, Robin
Cook was not the first writer to come up with the
notion of a black market in human organs. Science
fiction writer Larry Niven first proposed such a

commodity in .4 (lift From Earth, and even sug
gested a name for such unscrupulous dealers in
body parts — organlegfiers. As early as 1969, Niven
was hinting that we should turn our convicted
criminals into spare parts so the rest of us could
live longer lives; but even Niven admits that if the
idea of black market organ transplants was eco
nomically feasible, "The Red Cross would have
been finding its blood donors on Death Row, five
quarts to a donor, since 1940." Fortunately, that
hasn't been happening.

As much as I hate to admit it,
Cook's paranoid views will adapt
marvellously well to the big
screen, and the book's many
discontinuities and red herrings
will all but disappear in
Technicolor and Dolby stereo.

In Brain, Cook once again gives us a glimpse of
sinister goings-on at a fictional hospital, Hobson
Medical Center in New York City — a teaching
hospital that is suspiciously close to Columbia
Presbyterian. Martin Philips, a prominent radio
logist at the hospital, finds to his dismay that a
string of attractive female co-eds have been mys
teriously disappearing after visits to the

gynecology clinic. To complicate matters, these
women had all complained of persistent head
aches and dizzy spells, and Philips soon discovers
that X-rays of their brains (aha!) all show the
same abnormality. When he learns that the brain
has been removed from the corpse of a young
woman, Philips begins to suspect foul play, and
it's soon clear that the hospital staff is engaged in
some sort of ghoulish conspiracy.
This time around, however. Cook's idea is not
even moderately fresh: the notion of brain
snatchers is almost as old as the novel itself. Mary
Shelley used it in Frankenstein, and it has since
become the exclusive property of bad science fic
tion movies like Donovan's Brain and — an all
time classic — They Saved Hitler's Brain.
Cook is very good at evoking the blind, in
stinctive fear that we mortals of mere flesh and
blood experience in hospitals, surrounded by
practitioners of an art we don't really understand.
He also throws in a good sampling of medical
jargon, mostly about CAT scanners, GYN clinics
and that sort of thing. But Cook's familiarity with
the gadgetry and the day-to-day routine of an ur
ban hospital does very little to make up for his
characters, who generally have about as much
depth as microscope slides. It's hard to believe
that characters as humorless and as un
imaginative as these ever made it through grade
school, let alone medical school. Like the four or
five college co-eds who disappear from the
gynecology clinic, all the characters seem in
terchangeable — there are no good guys, no bad
guys, only pitiful little cogs spinning helplessly
within the vast, gleaming machine of the hospital.
Even the characters' names — Martin Philips,

William Michaels — are curiously bland and for
gettable.
Cook's writing style is equally bland and for
gettable. For the first 50 pages or so, his stilted
prose and detached point of view are fairly effec
tive, but then one begins to suspect that neither is
intentional on Cook's part — he is simply a bad
writer.
What's really objectionable about Brain, how
ever, is not the mediocrity of its subject matter or
its writing. The publisher calls it "a natural best
seller,'' and sure enough, it has already hit the No.
2 spot on the fiction bestseller list. As much as I
hate to admit it, Cook's paranoid views will adapt
marvellously well to the big screen, and the
book's many discontinuities and red herrings will
all but disappear in Technicolor and Dolby stereo.
If ever a book was destined to be made into a mov
ie, it is Brain The main character, a neurotic doc
tor in his 40s, was clearly written for a Michael
Caine or a Donald Sutherland; throw in Amy Irv
ing as his young medical student lover, and for the
hospital heavies, just dust off Hal Holbrook and
Lome Greene.
Coma, for all its faults, was at least an interest
ing attempt at linking the clinical detachment of a
physician with the unbridled imagination of a
writer, and the result — in the publisher's words,
"a gleaming nightmare universe of science gone
mad'' — was chilling and effective. But a writer's
imagination is like an organ that must be con
tinuously supplied with fresh blood, and without a
flow of new ideas, it shrivels and dies. Cook should
realize that by sticking so inflexibly to a formula
that's been successful in the past, he's well on his
way to an oblivion of his own creation.
