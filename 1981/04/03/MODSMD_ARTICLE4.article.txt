# Awareness can lessen quake danger
## 
### Bill Beyda Second of two parts 
At 10 a.m. April 21, President
Donald Kennedy, the University Pub
lic Safety and Facilities and Services
Departments, and the Stanford Hospi
tal will pretend that a major earth
quake has just struck the Peninsula.
The earthquake drill, however, will
not involve many students directly. In
stead, students will be informed by a
widespread public-awareness pro
gram, which will include the distribu
tion of a Public Safety brochure,
Earthquake â€” A Guide For Stanford
University Residences.
James Gere, civil engineering pro
fessor, co-director of the John A.
Blume Earthquake Engineering Cen
ter, and chairman of the University's
Earthquake Preparedness Commit
tee, is optimistic about Stanford's
earthquake safety.
"The major danger would probably
be from falling objects such as light
fixtures or ceiling tiles,'' Gere said.
Therefore, students can greatly re
duce their chance of injury by their
preparation for and reaction to an

earthquake.
Preparing for an earthquake in
volves careful planning, including the
cooperation of the entire campus, ac
cording to Marv Herrington, chair
man of the Public Safety Department
and campus police chief. The depart
ment's brochure includes a campus
map that indicates places outside each
residence where students should as
semble following an earthquake.
Students should be aware of these
assembly points, as well as emer
gency exits, placement of fire extin
guishers, the emergency number (911
from regular phones, and 9-911 from
University phones), and any physi
cally limited students who might need
help in emergency evacuation
Common sense in room planning,
such as not placing a stereo on a shelf
overhanging a bed, will help eliminate
some of the dangers from falling ob
jects, according to Gere.
During an earthquake, all author
ities agree that remaining calm is im
portant. If indoors, to avoid being hit
by falling objects, stand under a

doorway or under a desk; if outdoors,
move to an open area away from build
ings and power lines.
The Department of Public Safety
warns that fire alarms and sprinklers
may be activated, and the electricity
may fail. In addition, aftershocks may
occur.
After a major earthquake, the coop
eration of residents is essential, ac
cording to Herrington. "Police of
ficers will be busy relaying informa
tion back to our headquarters, and will
not be able to get involved in most
problems, except where emergency
medical care is needed," he said.
"Residents will have to report to
the assembly points as soon as the
earthquake is over and organize their
own rescue, first aid, and support
teams," Herrington added
The rescue team will help evacuate
trapped or physically limited stu
dents, and notify the Emergency Com
mand Center at Public Safety head
quarters (711 Serra Street) if special
equipment is needed to rescue people.
