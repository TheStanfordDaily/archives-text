# Chappie isn't funny, but it should be

NOW THAT Ronnie is re
cuperating, it's okay to
capitalize on his near as
sassination, right? That's what
Chappie's attitude appeared to
be earlier this week as staff
members sold copy after copy
of the now-famous issue beside
a banner reading "Who Shot
R.R.?" Such stupid flippancy is
a horrifying sight Almost as
bad is the fact that what they
were selling isn't funny — in
fact much of it is downright bor
ing.
This quarter's Chaparral
takes "art, music and generics"
as its theme As is usual with
Chappie, the theme is just a
loose conceptual net thrown
over a lot of diverse material.
There are jokes from Stanford
professors (a nice idea, but none

of them are very funny), bogus
ads ("Beau Godot, the wine
worth waiting for"), several
pieces on inspiration and its un
happy recipients, a long piece of
strung-together financial puns
having to do with a fictional
rock band named the MBA's,
and the famous "Who Shot
R R ?" pink section, to name a
few items.
Nice variety, but there are
two problems. The first is that
most of the material is predic
table; it's recycled college hu
mor that manages to be clever
but rarely inspired. There is the
requisite spoof of superstar pro
fessors (Albert Elsen and Philip
Zimbardo), the requisite tale of
a degenerate student, and the
requisite spaced-out psy
chedelic comics (explained to
me as "random aesthetics" bv

one staff member). We've seen
it before, and back issues are
cheaper.
The second problem is the
one-gag story — material that
obviously started out as "hey
wouldn't it be hilarious to —"
but never got any further. Yes,
it's a funny idea to pose Elsen as
the country's greatest authority
on Rodan, a Japanese science
fiction creature Yes. it's a fun
ny idea to trace the evolution of
an artist's work through a de
tailed description of the road
signs he paints And yes. it's a
funny idea to have Andy Warhol
and Norman Rockwell duke it
out in visuals. These ideas are
all conceptually — and poten
tially — funny, but having to
read them in longhand is anoth
er matter.
Fortunately, Art, Music and

Generics has some good spots.
There's Kennedy Comics, for in
stance Joe Kennedy's youngest
son. Donald grows up knowing
he must become president — but
gets confused as to president of
what. The ending is familiar to
us all Or there's story of Jane
Stanford's fetishistic will and
its responsibility for the various
physical deformities of this
campus — e.g. continuous con
struction, fountain worship, and
bollards. Or there's "new bab
ble from Ivory Tower Rec
ords." the recording company
that brings you the famous Dead
Hoovers, not to mention Bram
Noamchomsky.
And then of course, there are
the graphics: this issue may
have the most sophisticated new
wave style (a la Wot magazine)
graphics yet. But fancy

graphics have a price too: they
detract from the writing, leav
ing you wondering which is
more important — the dialogue
or the cute little dots in the Cam
pus Shell ad (Alas, the dots are
usually more interesting.)
Chaparral has never been
known for its taste. Its prevail
ing philosophy seems to be "if it
makes you laugh, who cares?"
This kind of adolescent bravura
is fine if it does make you laugh
But if it doesn't make you laugh,
it either makes you feel cheap
(Who Shot R.R.?) or bores you
to tears. Chappie is fond of
saying "the real world isn't fun
ny: but it should be." Un
fortunately, much of the real
world of assassinations isn't
funny. Unfortunately — even
though it should be — neither is
much of Chappie.
