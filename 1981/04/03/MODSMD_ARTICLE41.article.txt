Animal Haute ★★★★
Fox Theater, Redwood City
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric and
mindless movie which serves as
one big glorification of white male
fantasies. And because of this, this
story of various forms of frat life
in '62 works; Animal House's ap
proach fits its subject matter very
well.
John Belushi gives an inspired
performance as one of the
"animals" in the "worst frat on
campus." I am never quite sure
what drives Belushi, but whatever
it is, it must be good stuff
John Landis, the director,
directs as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, giving
Animal House a decidedly limited
emotional range. But a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
Plays tonight only with The
Blues Brothers Movie.

Letter from an Unknown
Woman
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The films of Max Ophuls are
among the most visually opulent in
cinema. His camera seems freed
from gravity; it swoops and glides
with utter disregard for the laws of
physics. If the word exquisite can
be applied to any movie, it can be
applied to his. They are cinematic
jewels. Letter from an Unknown
Woman, made in 1948, stars Joan
Fontaine as a girl who falls in love
with a pianist who doesn't know
she's alive — he learns of her ex
istence mainly from a letter she
writes just before her death. It's a
bittersweet, fragile tale, beau
tifully told.
Plays through Wednesday with
Anna Karenina, starring Greta
Garbo.
— Jim Mattson
Bicycle Thieves ★★★★
Wednesday, Bishop Auditorium
Director Vittorio de Sica is one
of the greatest portrayers of the
urban scene on film; this may be
his masterwork. Bicycle Thieves
concerns a man's search through
the streets of post-war Rome for
the bicycle he depends upon for his
livelihood. This easily could have
been a slight, sentimental morali
ty tale, but stunning photography
and the performances of amateur
actors Lamberto Maggiorani (the
man) and Enzo Staiola (his son)
combine to make this film an un
forgettable one. Bicycle Thieves,
a neo-realistic classic, perfectly
demonstrates the romanticism
that underpins all the great neo-re
alistic films.
— Mike Hale
Butch Cassidy and the Sun
dance Kid ★ ★★
Friday, Kresge
This movie now seems a little
dated by the slickness of its love
story and by the inclusion of some
double-yechy Burt Bacharach
tunes. But BCatSK is, above all, a
very entertaining movie. William
Goldman's script gives Paul New
man and Robert Redford some
pretty funny things to say to each
other. Director George Roy Hill
keeps the action moving along
briskly, for once. And the ending,
although certainly not precedent
shattering, is agreeably, almost
heroically, anti-heroic.

Altered State» *
Palo Alto Square
Altered States is the world's
first 70-millimeter, six-track ster
eo Looney Tune. It's brightly col
ored, wonderfully noisy, and utter
ly vacuous.
Ken Russell (Women in Love,
Tommy) directed; Paddy
Chayefsky (Network) wrote the
story and screenplay. This tale of a
man who turns into an ape
(honest) and does other colorful
things after he takes a rare drug
reflects the worst aspects of both
of its creators: from Russell it re
ceives pointless visual flam
boyance; from Chayefsky it gains
pointless philosophical dis
cussions ("What is man? When do
we eat?"). Its visuals, however,
are very pretty — the movie prac
tically begs you to stop thinking
long enough to enjoy them — and
the soundtrack ("Megasound") is
loud and creepy. It's amazing what
wonderful things one can do with
no ideas at all.
Double-billed with American
Pop.
- J.M.
The Shining *
Sunday, Mem Aud
An interesting, infuriating,
bewildering mess of a movie.
Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of
the Stephen King novel supplies
neither the promised shocks
(about the best he can muster is a
cackling corpse in a bathtub) nor
hinted-at depths in character
ization. Jack Nicholson gleefully
overplays his role as mad
man/father to telepathic son
Barry Lloyd; driven to knife
wielding hysteria by it all is moth
er Shelley Duvall. Duvall gives the
film's most interesting per
formance — she has a capacity for
expressing emotional aridness
that a better movie might have
used to stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making, The Shining is a testa
ment to Kubrick's ability to devote
infinite care fashioning a mon
ument to nothing in particular.
- J.M.
The Great Santini **
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
An interesting, often wonderful
movie run aground by an ending
that renders pointless everything
that's come before. Robert Duvall
plays a Marine colonel who ac
cuses his wife of mollycoddling his
sons. He abuses his family in what
he thinks is their best interests,
and risks alienating them all in the
process. So much, so good ... but
then those lousy last five minutes
go and screw everything up. You
might want to consider going out
for another tub of popcorn when it
becomes apparent that the mov
ie's drawing to a close.
Double-billed with Private Ben
jamin.

Raging
Menlo Cinema. Menlo Park
Raging Hull is a great piece of
moviemaking, and it is a pow
erhouse. But on every level direc
tor Martin Scorsese throws ob
stacles in our path that prevent us
from becoming involved with the
film's characters. Scorsese and
star Robert De Niro have done
something very strange: they
have created a hero (based on the
life of famous middleweight Jake
La Motta) who does not respond on
any level to our attempt to locate
him on the human scale: he is im
penetrable. Raging Hull is all
about passion, yet in some ul
timate and important way the pas
sion never reaches us, even when
Jake's blood spatters the spec
tators at the last fight. As much as
I admire the film's technique, I
have to confess I don't like it very
much.
— Steve Vineberg
9 to 5 *
Old Mill, Mountain View
One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about the revenge three abused
secretaries take on their
chauvinistic boss are quickly
smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy
with a fake feminist gloss and a
Frank Capracom ending. Lily
Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Dabney
Coleman salvage as much as they
can, but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance: trying to
play a woman of average in
telligence and to be light and funny
at the same time, she telegraphs
appallingly and gives us scenes of
classic female incompetence,
which surely cannot be what she
intended.
- S.V.

Tess *
Old Mill, Mountain View
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less as it
does in the book, but the soul of the
work is gone.
Tess' centerpiece is Nastassia
Kinski. She is lovely. Looking at
her, one can almost believe that
she could, without in the least in
tending to, drive men to do terrible
deeds. But, and this is a big but,
she has an accent. It is difficult to
concentrate her character's plight
when it sounds as if she spent sum
mers on the banks of the Rhine.
The ultimate responsibility, of
course, rests with director Roman
Polanski. Unable to render any
real, cinematic interpretation of
the novel, he contented himself
with dramatizing its "big mo
ments." What he forgot to do, or
what he was afraid to try, was to
offer any reason for seeing the
movie rather than staying home
and rereading the book.
- J.M.
Private Benjamin **
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
A Goldie Hawn : production of a
Goldie Hawn star vehicle. The
movie is a big-budgeted "Perils of
Goldie:'' Hawn plays a know-noth
ing rich girl who loses her hus
band, meets the reality of the
army, grows up, becomes inde
pendent thinking Hawn's talents
are considerable, but she's lost
much of her perspective here —
many of her best sequences are
pushed beyond the breaking point.
Director Howard Zieff (Hearts of
the West) has a nice comic touch,
but he stumbles badly when the
movie takes a romantic turn.

Tommy
Old Miil, Mountain View
As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Townshend's rock opera about the
corruption of a punk — the "deaf,
dumb, and blind" Tommy — mag
nifies all of director Ken Russell's
strengths and weaknesses. The in
dividual scenes are all huge and
loud; they splatter all over the
place. Some of the resulting frag
ments miss everything while oth
ers are right on the mark. Al
though the Who get the message
across better live (as you realize
when you hear Oliver Reed sing
ing) Russell probably made the
greatest possible movie version of
Tommy, and that's just what the
world's greatest rock band de
serves.
Late show this weekend

Seems I.ike Old Times *
New Varsity. Palo Alto
A movie only a schnauzer could
love. Goldie Hawn, Chevy Chase,
and Charles Grodin share the
screen with six dogs in assorted
sizes; the only really funny scene
comes when the dogs turn up their
noses at Hawn's pepperoni
chicken. Neil Simon's script com
bines a ludicrous storyline with
one-dimensional characters:
Hawn has nothing to do but act
frazzled, while Grodin snivels and
Chase mugs. The "old times" that
Simon would like to evoke are the
screwball comedies of the '30s and
'40s, but Seems Like Old Times
only brings to mind the TV sitcoms
of the '70s.
Plays Saturday with Heaven
Can Wait.

The Poitman ilua y» Hingi
Twice **
Palo Alto Square
The newest version of James M.
Cain's taut, mean little potboiler,
starring Jack Nicholson and
Jessica Lange, has a convincing
period look, and the director, Bob
Rafelson, has done a good job of
recreating a desolate, under
populated patch of rural Califor
nia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige — in
cluding the casting of Jack Nich
olson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direction,
which seems to be telling us to
study carefully what requires no
more than a glance For if you take
away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.
-S.V.
Heaven (.an If ait ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Very wry — like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependent for its
success upon machinations that
come totally out of the blue — if
the movie is to work it must con
tinually outwit its audience. And it
does, for the most part Warren
Beatty has more than a little
Walter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obstinant
persistence and a stubborn sense
that he's been cheated. (Strange
as it sounds, he's good at this, and
his efforts are supported by those
of a well-addled supporting cast.)
Heaven isn't so much a remake
as it is an effort to exhume a kind
of movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off its
inferiority to the original — this is
a thoughtful reintroduction to a far
more intelligent kind of comedy
than that which is currently the
norm. Never again will I confuse
Warren Beatty with Clint East
wood
Plays Saturday.

American Pop JW
Palo Alto Square
This is an animated "history"
of American popular music. To
tell his tale, director Ralph Bakshi
(The Lord of the Rings) creates a
series of proto-people. A proto-
Gershwin gives birth to another,
less-talented proto-Gershwin
gives birth to a proto-Jim Mor
rison gives birth to a proto-Tom
Petty. In this manner has the
glorious lineage of American song
been begat. Unable to capture any
of the dream of a popular art form,
Bakshi contents himself with
stealing bits from its history.
The animation, to put it bluntly,
stinks. The characters are pedes
trian even when they're not walk
ing. Heads move, but bodies re
main stationary. An arm will trace
a spastic arc and then freeze in
animated rigor mortis. Legs jiggle
against backgrounds in a relent
less parody of St. Vitus Dance.
American Pop is animation for
people who have never seen any
other animated film. It is mov
iemaking for those who despise
movies.
