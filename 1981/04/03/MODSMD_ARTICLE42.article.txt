Budget cut passes in Senate
Washington — Yesterday, the Senate overwhelmingly
approved $36.9 billion worth of President Ronald Reagan's
budget cuts for next year. A handful of frustrated Demo
crats, thwarted in attempts to restore money for social
programs, accused the triumphant Republican majority
of "scorched-earth" politics and a "cruel abandonment"
of America's needy.
Voting 88-10, with a big majority of the Democrats going
along with Reagan's program, the Republican-controlled
Senate gave the president all he wanted — and then some
— in the first phase of his massive, unprecedented budget
cutting drive.
Senate passage of the spending retrenchment measure
shifts the budget battle to the Democratic-controlled
House, where Democrats believe they have a better
chance of retaining money for educational, welfare, em
ployment and other programs the Senate is cutting in ac

cord with Reagan's wishes
But the House battle was joined early by Rep. Delbert
Latta, (R-Ohio), ranking minority member of the House
Budget Committee, who told reporters yesterday that he
expects enough Democratic defections for a Reagan vic
tory there.too.
"But the Republican victory may be a costly victory for
the nation." said Minority Whip Alan Cranston (D-Calif.).
He called it a "cruel abandonment of America's commit
ment — indeed America's obligation — to help those most
in need."
Negotiations will reopen in Poland
Warsaw, Poland — The government indicated yester
day that it would agree to the demands of the Solidarity
trade union federation for reopening negotiations on the
agreement that led to cancellation of a nationwide strike
that had been called for Tuesday.

Deputy Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the chief gov
ernment negotiator in the talks with Solidarity, said that if
more demands were added to the agreement, "that would
mean the reopening of a new phase of talks with the Soli
darity delegation."
The union's National Coordinating Committee, its chief
governing body, said that the agreement reached last
Monday would be treated as a preliminary agreement that
required further discussion on the union's demands grow
ing out of a police attack against three union members
March 19 in the city of Bydgoszcz.
The coordinating committee's move was seen as a slap
at Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who headed the union ne
gotiating team in the talks with the government. Walesa
had considered the agreement acceptable and had asked
the committee to ratify it.
Yesterday, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
said the Soviet Union has taken steps in the last 24 to 48
hours to increase its capacity to invade Poland and the
United States is "taking . . . steps" as a result.
Unrest springs up in Yugoslavia
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — Yugoslavia's Communist au
thorities yesterday imposed emergency measures in an at
tempt to quell mounting disturbances among the country's
politically sensitive ethnic Albanian minority
Serious clashes between demonstrators and security
forces in the province of Kosovo, which borders on
Albania, have triggered the first crisis in Yugoslavia since

President Josip Broz Tito's death 11 months ago. The
gathering unrest came to a head two days ago when, ac
cording to official sources, several hundred people were
injured as police firing tear gas broke up a march of at
least 10,000 protesters through the provincial capital of
Pristina.
Kosovo has long been regarded as one of the weak points
in post-Tito Yugoslavia because of its economic
backwardness and rivalry between the province s ethnic
Albanian rfiajority and Serb minority.
Taken together, the latest events reflect the two gravest
problems confronting Tito's successors: ethnic dif
ferences in this complex multinational state and an in
creasingly serious economic crisis. Inflation is running at
over 40 percent, there are 800,000 unemployed in a total
population of 22 million, and Yugoslavia is heavily in debt.
Dow Jones is still above 1000
New York — The stock market turned in a mixed show
ing yesterday ending the rally of the two previous sessions.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up almost 22
points Tuesday and Wednesday, dropped back 5.13 to
1009.01.
Today's weather
Variable clouds today and tonight. Fair tomorrow.
Lows in the 40s. Highs in the 60s except 50s near the coast.
Winds will be from the southeast at 15 to 30 mph.
