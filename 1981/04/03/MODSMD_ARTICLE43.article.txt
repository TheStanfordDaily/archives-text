# Panel discusses nuclear scenarios
## 
### Fred Wainwright 
Ninety percent of the American
people would die within 30 days either
directly or indirectly from a full-scale
nuclear attack.
This is an example of the informa
tion brought forth in an informal dis
cussion Tuesday night at the Law
School on nuclear war and how it can
be avoided.
The speakers concluded that an in
ternational organization should be
created in order to force the U.S. and
Russia toward disarmament.
Sponsored by Humanitas Interna
tional, a human rights organization,
the six speakers, including Prof.
Sidney Drell, deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator; Dave
McFadden, member of the Mid-Penin
sula Conversion Project; Philip
Farley, member of the Stanford Arms
Control and Disarmament Program;
students Mike Shuman and Steve
Ladd; and Dr. Perrin Finch gave vari
ous views of nuclear war and how to

stop It.
Drell took a realistic view of nucle
ar arms. Giving a vivid description of
a supposed nuclear attack on San
Francisco with only one atomic bomb.
Drell concluded that "the definition of
survival in this type of occurrence
would not be a pleasant one."
"We cannot talk of a technical de
fense for a nuclear attack," Drell
said, "but of a deterring war." The
only defense for a nuclear attack is an
other nuclear attack.
McFadden, member of the Mid-
Peninsula Conversion Project, dealt
with the economic aspects of nuclear
armaments and military spending in
general. Santa Clara's economy, he
said, "is one of the country's areas
that is most dependent on military
contracts."
With such expenses as $300 to 600
billion in nuclear arms, McFadden
said, the military causes inflation, un
employment and a depletion of the ci
vilian economy. His solution to this

was an advanced planning of financial
cutbacks to the military.
Farley, a member of the Stanford
Arms Control and Disarmament Pro
gram, Shuman, a Stanford law stu
dent, and Ladd, a member of the War
Resisters League-West, agreed that
an international move toward dis
armament must be made.
Shuman, who won the $5000
Rabinovitch essay competition in the
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists with his
"The Mouse that Roared," said the in
dependence of Third World countries
could help bring disarmament. He
said they and the European countries
could organize themselves and use ec
onomic pressure to force the United
States and the Soviet Union to move
toward disarmament and to boycott
non-proliferation treaties.
Dr. Perrin French explained the
purposes of a society called the Physi
cians for Social Responsibility, of
which he is a member. "It must in
form the layman of the realities of nu
clear war," he said.
