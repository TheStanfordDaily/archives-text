# Res Ed to 'streamline' Draw with new procedural changes
## 
### Sally Newman 
Seeking to alleviate the tension as
sociated with the Spring Housing
Draw, Residential Education's Hous
ing Center has adopted two procedural
modifications.
Beginning with this year's draw,
students may not change their housing
choices between rounds one and two,
and must obtain their priorities before
the first round of the draw.
As in the past, though, choices may
be reworked after the second round
for consideration on the waiting list.
Additionally, everyone who partici
pated in round one of the draw is auto
matically entered into round two un
less a specific request is made to the
contrary.
This latter innovation, remarked
Stern Hall office manager Bill Offutt,
"is helpful, because it will avoid a

great deal of suffering." (in the past,
students often failed to confirm their
first-round assignments by entering
round two Consequently, they would
lose their assignments and be placed
at the bottom of the waiting lists.)
According to Roger Whitney, assis
tant dean of student affairs and direc
tor of the University Housing Center,
the effects of these changes will be to
further "streamline the system, and
make it more responsive to students."
Whitney described the system in
previous years as "sort of a fruit
basket turnover" in which people
were going through the draw twice,
each time making selections too much
on the basis of trying to outwit the sys
tem and not enough based on the de
sire to live in a particular house.
In past years, most students who en
tered round one entered the second
round. Whitney said he would be sur
prised if many students drop out
before round two, noting that students
will still tend to see round two as a
chance to better their round one as
signments.
Though Whitney said he couldn't
predict whether the new draw system
will work as efficiently as the Univer
sity hopes it will, he voiced optimism
for the modifications.

The combination of requiring all
students — guaranteed or not — to
make their selections before the draw
and of assuming the responsibility of
entering them in the second round
will, Whitney hopes, shorten the entire
process — or at least the time students
spend worrying over it.
Whitney said he did not wish the
draw to be such an "intense process."
To have the best chance of obtaining
assignment to first-choice housing,
Offutt offered two suggestions. First,
students should ■ "make intelligent
choices the first time around" — in
other words, should broaden their
selections and formulate contingency
plans early.
Offutt said it would be unwise to fill
a draw card with eight of the tradi
tionally competitive houses, for a poor
draw number would result in the the
006 — or "place me anywhere" — as
signment.
Second, Offutt noted that special
priority houses have in recent years
tended to fill with students who had ob
tained the highest possible priority
they could achieve without being re
turning residents of the house. There
fore, he added, "If you want a special
prioritv house, get the special priori
ty"
