# Grad funds to drop due to budget cuts
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
"lt only took David Stockman 24
hours to make a liar out of me,'' Presi
dent Donald Kennedy complained to
the Faculty Senate yesterday, after
telling senators at their last meeting
that budget cuts in Washington posed
no major threat to Stanford programs.
The next day, Kennedy said. Stock
man announced that this year will be
the last time National Science Foun
dation Fellowships will be awarded.
The loss of these fellowships, awarded
to college seniors to pay for graduate
school, will create a $1 million short
fall for graduate programs at Stan
ford, Kennedy said.
Also troubling, he noted, are the
large amounts of social and behav
ioral sciences funds and guaranteed
student loans targeted for Office of
Management and Budget reductions.
Kennedy said he has been active in
protesting those cuts on behalf of the
University and believes it is both bad
government and bad education policy
to make those proposed cuts. "These
are not the kinds of decisions ap
propriate to make in the executive of
fice of the (U.S.) president," he said.
Kennedy predicted that at Stanford,
the most serious impact of the budget
cuts will be in the area of graduate
education and financial support for
graduate students, especially in the
Ph.D. programs in humanities. The
University, he said, has not yet de
cided what it will do to compensate for

this loss.
Turning to LOTS, the computer sys
tem available to most under
graduates. Provost Albert Hastorf
said, "We have improved things for
this quarter." The best long-term
solution to the overcrowding at LOTS,
he reported, is a new DEC 2080 com
puter, but it will not be available for at
least a year and a naif
To alleviate the present problem,
Hastorf said, 10 computer terminals
have been rented for part-time use.
And thanks to the Business School,
whose DEC 2040 computer is being
hooked into LOTS for spring quarter,
he said the capacity at LOTS will in
crease.
Other computer news from the
provost was Stanford's recent com
mitment to the CONTEXT word-proc
essor system, which will be on line by
May. CONTEXT users will have ac
cess to all computing, text processing
and information systems at Stanford,
but will have to subscribe to the sys
tem, he said. The cost of a private ter
minal and a printer shared with two
other people is under $400 per month.
Reporting to the senate, Religious
Studies Associate Prof. Lee Yearley,
chairman of the subcommittee on dis
tribution requirements, cited critical
issues being considered by the sub
committee.
"What are the areas we should con
vey to students? Are they properly de
fined? Are there too many of them?"
Yearley asked. He explained that
"when looking with care, the areas of
distribution requirements become
less clear."
For example, Yearley noted the
area of Human Development, Behav
ior and Language, includes a class in
the History of the English Language
as well as Psychology 1. The question,
he said, is "Do both do the same
thing?"
Another example Yearley gave was
the area of Philosophic and Religious
Thought, which includes the classes
Chinese Myth, Legend and Folk Tales
and Introduction to Ethics. "These
are the issues that we face," he said.
In an interim report of the Western
Culture Program, Drama Prof.
Charles Lyons explained that sched
uling is one problem facing the pro
gram. Because it involves nearly all
freshmen, Lyons said that Western
Culture encounters scheduling con
flicts with other large University
courses that many freshmen take.
English Prof. Diane Middlebrook
expressed concern that the subcom
mittee address itself to including the
topics of women, minorities and non-
Western cultures in the program
tracks. Lyons said those areas will be
reviewed.

University, he said, has not yet de
cided what it will do to compensate for

this loss.
Turning to LOTS, the computer sys
tem available to most under
graduates. Provost Albert Hastorf
said, "We have improved things for
this quarter." The best long-term
solution to the overcrowding at LOTS,
he reported, is a new DEC 2080 com
puter, but it will not be available for at
least a year and a naif
To alleviate the present problem,
Hastorf said, 10 computer terminals
have been rented for part-time use.
And thanks to the Business School,
whose DEC 2040 computer is being
hooked into LOTS for spring quarter,
he said the capacity at LOTS will in
crease.
Other computer news from the
provost was Stanford's recent com
mitment to the CONTEXT word-proc
essor system, which will be on line by
May. CONTEXT users will have ac
cess to all computing, text processing
and information systems at Stanford,
but will have to subscribe to the sys
tem, he said. The cost of a private ter
minal and a printer shared with two
other people is under $400 per month.
Reporting to the senate, Religious
Studies Associate Prof. Lee Yearley,
chairman of the subcommittee on dis
tribution requirements, cited critical
issues being considered by the sub
committee.
"What are the areas we should con
vey to students? Are they properly de
fined? Are there too many of them?"
Yearley asked. He explained that
"when looking with care, the areas of
distribution requirements become
less clear."
For example, Yearley noted the
area of Human Development, Behav
ior and Language, includes a class in
the History of the English Language
as well as Psychology 1. The question,
he said, is "Do both do the same
thing?"
Another example Yearley gave was
the area of Philosophic and Religious
Thought, which includes the classes
Chinese Myth, Legend and Folk Tales
and Introduction to Ethics. "These
are the issues that we face," he said.
In an interim report of the Western
Culture Program, Drama Prof.
Charles Lyons explained that sched
uling is one problem facing the pro
gram. Because it involves nearly all
freshmen, Lyons said that Western
Culture encounters scheduling con
flicts with other large University
courses that many freshmen take.
English Prof. Diane Middlebrook
expressed concern that the subcom
mittee address itself to including the
topics of women, minorities and non-
Western cultures in the program
tracks. Lyons said those areas will be
reviewed.
