# SAC 'induction notice' draws angry reactions
## 
### Alexi Assmus 
Many students checking their Post
Office boxes on Tuesday were in for
quite a shock.
After opening an official-looking en
velope, they were faced with an "Or
der to report for induction" from the
Santa Clara County Draft Board. On
closer examination, they realized that
the authentic-looking fascimile of a
draft notice was a publicity stunt by

Stanford Against Conscription.
The scene at the Post Office was one
of surpise, fear and anger.
"I was really shocked" was an
almost-unanimous response from stu
dents who received the notice. One
freshman believed the letter long
enough to wonder why he could be
drafted without any warning.
Elizabeth Browning, another
freshman, said, "I thought there was
no way this could happen to women. It
made me want to find out what was
happening." Other students were an
noyed with the SAC for playing what
they felt was an April Fool's joke.
'Not real'
On the bottom half of the bogus
draft notice, students were told:
"This draft notice is not real. The next
one you receive may well be." The
rest of the letter was a call for student
awareness to the possibility of a draft.

The letter spoke of U.S. military
preparedness in El Salvador and the
Middle East, and the Reagan adminis
tration's anti-Soviet stance. It urged
students not to be fooled as a previous
generation had been with the Vietnam
War.
The final paragraph announced a
march for next Wednesday evening
"to highlight the urgency of student
protest."
According to Matt Nicodemus, one
of the students who worked on the
project, the fake draft notice and let
ter were supposed to reach students
next Monday or Tuesday to publicize
this march. He said that he had ex
pected the mail to take much longer
than it did and that the letter was not
meant to be a part of an April Fool's
joke
The publicity stunt was the
brainchild of two SAC members.

freshmen Paul Baer and Sushma Gov
indarajulu. They and three others
worked on the notice and letter over
spring break. Most of the time was
spent in handtyping the 3000 labels
needed for mailing. The notices were
sent out to a random sampling of stu
dents from the directory, taking an
equal number of males and females.
In response to students' fears on
first reading the SAC notice, Nico
demus said the letter was meant to
scare people, but the notice was not
designed just for its shock value. He
said that students were going to have
to confront the draft issue and that the
SAC notice was an effective way to
make them realize this.
After the letter was distributed, a
controversy arose over the use of the
ASSU stamp at the bottom of the let
ter. Because of the stamp many stu
dents believed the ASSU had endorsed
the SAC project.
Bulk mailing
Not so, said Olivia Peterson, secre
tary at the ASSU office. She said that
the SAC had asked to use the ASSU
bulk mailing service, which charges
student organizations 3"a cents per
letter for mailing.
On checking with the Post Office,
Peterson found that the ASSU stamp
must appear somewhere on the out
side or on the inside of the letter for
bulk mailing procedure. The stamp
didn't mean that the ASSU endorsed
the notice, she said.
Marc Ventresca, ASSU council
president, reaffirmed Peterson's
statement. "In no way was the ASSU
stamp any sort of editorial comment.
We have no stand on the matter and we
were not involved in any discussion.''
