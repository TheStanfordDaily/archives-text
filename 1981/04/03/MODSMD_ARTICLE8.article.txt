## Weekend conference with Sadat Haig will face opposition to permanent U.N. forces 
### Los Angeles Times 
Cairo, Egypt â€” Although Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig
has alerted Congress to the pos
sible deployment of 1000 U.S.
troops as part of the multi
national peace force set for duty
in the Sinai next year, he will hit
a stone wall of opposition when
he meets Anwar Sadat here this
weekend, sources close to the
Egyptian president say.
Sadat is unalterably opposed
to the permanent presence in
Egypt of U.S. troops, either as
part of the peacekeeping unit
called for under the terms of the
Egypt-Israel peace treaty, or as
an advance guard of the U.S.
Rapid Deployment Force
formed to counter the Soviet
threat to the Persian Gulf, three
senior sources said.
Under the treaty, if a U.N.
force cannot be formed, the
United States is responsible for
recruiting a multinational unit
to patrol the Egypt-Israel
border upon Israel's final with
drawal from the Sinai April 25.
1982.
Negotiations
Negotiations concerning the
organization and composition of
the force have been under way
between Israel, Egypt and the
United States for the past six
weeks. It has been widely as
sumed that since no other nation
has volunteered to join it. Amer
icans would have to make up a
substantial part of the peace
unit.
When Michael Sterner, a dep
uty assistant secretary of state
and the U.S. negotiator on the is
sue, visited Cairo last weekend,
Egypt's undersecretary for for
eign affairs. Osama el Baz par
ried questions from the press
concerning possible American
units in the peace force by
saying that no country's pos
sible contribution had been
ruled out.
His remark inspired reports
that Egypt had abandoned its
objections to American troops
in the Sinai force, which will be
based at two locations on the
Egyptian side of the border
zone, one near the Mediter
ranean in the north and the other
by the Red Sea in the south.
Some of the reports
speculated that the force, in
cluding American units, would
use as their bases the Israeli air
fields of Eitam and Etzion, due
to be evacuated in the final with
drawal.
Both the interpretation of
Osama's remark and the
speculation about Eitam and
Etzion set off alarms here.
Egypt is sensitive to any sug
gestion of permanently basing
American troops on its soil. Al
though Sadat has offered the

Americans temporary use of fa
cilities if they must come to the
defense of an Islamic state in
the region, he has steadfastly
refused to sign any formal
agreement or even consider the
question of permanent bases.
He is doubly sensitive con
cerning Americans at Eitam
and Etzion. since even a small
U.S. military presence at the
bases, reportedly the most ad
vanced in the Middle East,
would be perceived throughout
the Third World and by the Sovi
ets as an agent for the Rapid
Deployment Force.
The Department of State has
reassured Egypt that if Ameri
cans do join the multinational
peace force, they will have no
connection with the Rapid

Deployment Force, which is
still in the development stage.
But Egypt still remains
adamantly opposed to U.S.
troops in the Sinai unit, the
sources said.
Although several countries
already have refused to join the
multinational force without
U.N. sanction. Egyptian and
American officials remain con
fident that enough can be re
cruited during the coming
months to put the force in place
in time for the Israeli withdraw
al next year.
Israeli Prime Minister Men
achem Begin has indicated that
if the force is not ready by the
April 25 deadline. Israel will
postpone its withdrawal.
