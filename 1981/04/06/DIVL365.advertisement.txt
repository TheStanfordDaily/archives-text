ivir i raveler goes on a one week business
trip, leaving his wife at home However being a
concerned husband he vows to oall home
every evening to check up on things On the
first night he calls home and asks "Is every
thing OK at home?"
Everything s fine, honey, his wife replied.
"I served chicken for dinner, and the kids are
watching a Jacques Cousteau special right
"Tfc,ch relieved, Mr Traveler bid his wife
good night, and promised to call again the next
night Unfortunately, the next night things
didn t go so well When he asked Mrs Traveler
If everything was OK she said
Everything s not OK, dear, the cat died
Mr Traveler was. of course, heartbroken, as
he was very attached to the cat After the lump
in his throat went down ne became angry with
the way his wife broke the news
You shouldn t have dropped the bomb all at
once like that You should have staggered it
over several days For instance, on the first
night you could have said. The cat's on the
roof and we can't get him down, and the sec
ond night you could say The Fire Department
is trying to get the cat down but they're not
having any luck, and then the third night you
could say The cat s still on the roof and he
hasn t eaten in three days, and then the fourth
day you could say The cat finally died, and
then I'd be ready for the news You should
build up to it rather than blurting it all out at
once
"I guess you re right, Mrs Traveler admit
ted. ' I'll try to say it differently next time
"So what else is going on at home?" Mr
Traveler continued
It's your mother. Mrs Traveler said.
She s on the roof and we can t get her down
The Pope s assistant entered the Pontiffs
office Excuse me your Holiness, but I must
speak with you for a moment,' he said
"Yes my son, what is it?"
Well, there s some good news and some
bad news
"Go ahead
The good news is that waiting to talk with
you, on line two, is none other than our Lord
Jesus Christ returned to earth in the second
coming"
"Are you serious' This is incredible, astoud
mg! For centuries we have been praying for
this blessed event and now. in our lifetimes,
God has chosen to return his son to us! How
glorious this is! Wait — you said something
about bad news'
"Yes — he s calling from Salt Lake City
