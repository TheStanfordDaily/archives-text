# Ronald Reagan underestimated and oversold: a media brainchild in search of a 'bully pulpit'
## 
### 
How the California gubernatorial
race against Brown in '66 presaged
the national campaign of '80 and
the making of a President

President Ronald Wilson Reagan is a man
with a mission. His elusive dance with death
outside the Washington DC. Hilton last
week is likely to make the man even more con
fident that history and the Almighty support
his determination to quell government ac
tivism and redirect the cultural revolution
that has transformed America since 1965.
The man, at once shy and vain — as when
he ordered state legislators to look away when
his contact lens popped out, is also un
inhibited and brazen — as when he openly
stared down a crowd of anti-war demonstrat
ors at Berkeley, dodging tomatoes and
epithets alike.
While president of the Screen Actors Guild
in Hollywood, Reagan himself packed a .32
calibre Smith and Wesson revolver for
months, to protect himself against Com
munists trying to take over the union, he
claimed. Yet on the campaign trail last year,
the genial septuagenarian rarely hesitated to
plunge into a friendly crowd.
The overall thrust of Reagan's philosophy
of government — that is, less of it — is clear to
most people. Still a mystery is how this ideol
ogical conservative intends to manage the
government and what methods he will use to
implement his campaign promises. If his
former aides and rivals in Sacramento are
correct, Reagan will write the broad ideol
ogical script while his staff provides the day
to-day direction of the government.
During the primaries last year, Mike
Calabrese, currently a first-year law student,
spent months as a journalist traveling around
California in search of the real Reagan record.
The following leadership profile is the first of
a three-part series. It is a distillation of facts
and anecdotes gleaned from some 80 in
terviews with Reagan's top aides, former
state cabinet secretaries, state legislators and
journalists from his Sacramento days and
since.
As Democrats again discovered to their
dismay this fall, Ronald Reagan is con
sistently underestimated and oversold.
Ham Jordan and Jimmy Carter suffered ul
timate defeat, among other reasons, because
they never understood the roots of Reagan's
peculiarly durable appeal nor did they foresee
a strategic instant-replay of Reagan's 1966
trouncing of incumbent Gov. Edmund G.
(Pat) Brown.
While Carterites put little faith in pre-Wa
tergate political history, the rest of us would
be wise to understand the type of leader Rea
gan was and was not during his Sacramento
sojourn. With 70 years of success behind him,
Reagan is likely to insist the presidency con
form to his leadership profile. As Michael De
aver, Reagan's close friend and chief political
operative since 1966, earnestly confided in me
during the campaign last winter, "I don't
think Ronald Reagan has changed in either
substance or style in the 15 years I've known
him. He is very much an Eagle Scout. He holds
the presidency in great awe."
When Reagan decided in 1965 to give up sell
ing Borax as host of Death Valley Days and
run as the "citizen-politician" for governor of
California, few took him seriously. His pro
ducer, Jack Warner, hearing the news
quipped: "No, Jimmy Stewart for governor.
Ronald Reagan for best friend." Two-term in
cumbent Gov. Pat Brown mocked the actor's
candidacy, comparing him to a "citizen-pi
lot" who would take the plane up and then tell
the passengers "don't worry, I've always had
an active interest in aviation." Even Reagan
joked about his background. When asked if he
considered the motion picture industry ade
quate training for the governorship, he re
plied: "Gee, I don't know. I never played a
governor."
But Reagan's political handlers were de
termined to overcome such doubts. One of the
nation's pioneering political consulting
teams, Spencer-Roberts, was hired to manage
his campaign even before the wealthy Los An
geles businessmen who paid their steep fee
had convinced Reagan to make the race.
Spencer-Roberts equipped a team of
clinical psychologists with computers to iden
tify and weigh "gut issues" that polling data
indicated would sway the electorate. In 1966
the computers determined that the "citizen
politician" should run not only against Pat
Brown's record, but against what Reagan
called the "mad dogs" rioting in the ghettoes,
the purveyors of porno in San Francisco, and
the disorderly demonstrators at Berkeley.
The consultants brought in experts to pre
pare binders briefing the new candidate on the
rudiments of state government. Finally. Bill
Roberts said they implored Reagan to stop
giving his usual lectures about the socialistic
evils inherent in popular programs like Social
Security, medicare, the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the progressive income tax, open hous
ing, American membership in the United Na
tions, and the fluoridation of water, all of
which Reagan had opposed
The Brown people tried unsuccessfully to
portray Reagan as a dangerous right-winger,
publicizing his refusal to repudiate campaign
support from the John Birch Society and the
Ku Klux Klan as the leader of the more mod
erate wing of the California Republican party,
Richard Nixon, had done when he challenged
Brown in 1962. Anticipating by 18 years
Carter's flawed strategy of portraying Rea
gan as a rabid right-winger with an overeager
finger on the nuclear trigger, Brown's
strategy did not convince either the press or
the public to put much stock in such charges.
Other concerns were more pressing.
Reagan came along at a time when people

were looking for simpler answers. Calif orni
ans were tired of costly government programs
that seemed to fail, afraid of ghetto riots and
campus disorder, frustrated by spreading
pornography and ballooning welfare rolls.
White California's image of itself was severe
ly strained. Reagan succeeded in making
Brown's record the central issue, calling him
a "spendthrift" liberal and an "appeaser" of
campus and black radicals. He promised to
cut taxes and spending across the board.
While Brown grew defensive amidst the
swelling white backlash following the 1965
Watts riots, Reagan absorbed and amplified
the discontent, riding it into office. "If it takes
a blood bath, let's get it over with. No more
appeasement," he told a generation of young
people who protested against the war. Their
parents, who voted, loved it. The previously
cocky Brown defeated Richard Nixon easily in
1962, but in 1966 he lost to the actor-turned-pol
itician by nearly one million votes. His tactics
were the same during the 1970 campaign.
The rise of Ronald Reagan, from an aging
movie star to governor and now president of
the United States, seems unlikely, yet he is

Ham Jordan and Jimmy Carter suffered ultimate defeat,
among other reasons, because they never understood the roots
of Reagan's peculiarly durable appeal nor did they foresee a
strategic instant replay of Reagan's 1966 trouncing of
incumbent Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown.

tailored to the times. His career as a com
municator has paralleled the evolution of the
American media. He began as a radio broad
caster in the 19205, became a movie star in the
'30s and '40s, a television host in the '50s and
early '60s, and a political activist after 1963.
As he masters each dominant mode of social
communication, Reagan absorbs feedback
from his audience and his script evolves un
ceasingly in subtle ways to mirror whatever
ideal image middle-America holds of the
country and themselves.
Reagan is the premier political com
municator of our era. He uses television most
effectively to convey simple and inspiring
solutions to complex problems. Unlike typi
cally acquisitive politicians, Reagan does not
seek mere promotion, power or prestige. He
literally seeks the medium of the presidency,
primarily for its use as a "bully pulpit." His
goal, according to his most intimate advisers,
is to alter fundamentally the direction of pub
lic policy and institutionalize a new conserva
tive coalition. This coalition will be en
trenched more firmly in the middle and lower
middle classes than the traditional Re
publican party constituency, even if that
means alienating the Wall Street wing of the
party.
On the 1976 campaign trail, Reagan told
journalist Jules Witcover what spooked peo
ple about then-Sen. Barry Goldwater and how
it set the stage for his ascension. "Barry tried
to tell us a number of things that a number of
years ago we weren't ready to hear. He was
possibly a little ahead of his time. He was John
the Baptist. There had to be a Barry Gold
water."
This perceived sense of mission should not
be overlooked in examining Reagan's prefer
ence for preaching and persuasion over state
craft and policy-making. "I have always
thought myself that the halls of government

ought to be as inviolate and as near to sacred
as a cathedral or a temple or a church. I would
use, as Teddy Roosevelt called it, the bully
pulpit, for whatever good it could do in estab
lishing or maintaining the basic values upon
which I think our civilization and this country
are based," he said during an April interview
aboard his campaign plane before the Penn
sylvania primary.

Reagan aides mention the two Roosevelts
as presidents Reagan would emulate, not in
his policies, but in his style as a mass com
municator. As a young radio broadcaster in
lowa, "Dutch" Reagan admired the hope and
confidence FDR projected in his "fireside
chats" and he plans to use similar methods to
preach his vision of America directly to the
people.
Robert Monagan, the Republican speak
er of the California Assembly from 1968
to 1970, said Reagan had the "ability to
take what people were reacting to (such as
high taxes, racial unrest or welfare fraud) and
amplify and dramatize it." But he added that
while Reagan could enunciate the broad prin
ciples, "for all the rest of the nitty-gritty of
government, he has no interest."
Explained Reagan's longtime press secre
tary Lyn Nofziger in an interview during the
primaries, "What Ronald Reagan is, is a
motivator of the masses. He believes in going
directly to the people. He sits back and makes
the big decisions. He doesn't like to be both
ered with the details of government."
Although several former Reagan adminis
tration higher-ups claim the governor often
disappointed them when he compromised un
der pressure or in fear of total defeat to "ac
cept solutions not really in line with his basic
thinking," as one cabinet member put it, he
always managed to salvage a media victory
which served well his long-run cause. When
fellow conservatives labeled him a "be
trayer" after he broke his campaign promise
and proposed the $1 billion tax hike of 1967, the
largest single increase in California history,
Reagan responded, "I'm willing to take what I
can get." He said the "step at a time" ap
proach made the most sense, or as his cam
paign issues man Peter Hannaford quoted
him: "I'd rather get 70 percent today than go

down gloriously in flames."
Nofziger calls this "Fabian conservatism,"
and William F. Buckley also wrote to defend
Reagan's longterm outlook. "Rhetoric pre
cedes all action. All thoughtful action. Rea
gan's rhetoric is that of someone who is com
mitted, mutatis mutandis, to the ancient
ways. His perspectives are essentially un
doubting."
Lou Cannon, the Washington Post reporter
who has covered Reagan for 15 years, wrote
that this "undoubting quality" allowed Rea
gan to berate "spendthrift legislators" one
day and propose massive tax increases the
next, or sign the nation's most liberal abortion
bill one year (as he did in 1967, permitting
750,000 legal abortions before the Supreme
Court followed California's lead to legalize it
nationally) and call abortion "murder" the
next. Reporters have often caught Reagan de
nying something he had done or said publicly
as recently as the day before. Yet, according
to those who have worked closely with him,
Reagan is absolutely honest and sincere.
"There's no credibility gap between what
he says and what he really believes," said Bill
Roberts, who managed both gubernatorial
campaigns. "What you seeiswhatyouget,"is
a common refrain among Reaganites.
According to Nofziger, now White House
political director, "Sometimes you think he's
a simple man. He is. That is because he sim
plifies issues and repeats the same lines over
and over and over again. He's not tricky or ov
erly clever by nature."
There is a tendency to equate Reagan's
simple slogans, repeated for years and years,
as reflecting a shallow mind. Reagan's critics
may be correct about the shallowness of his
thinking about technical issues, but they un
derestimate his understanding of political
wholesaling that serves policy ends. He
always realized that particular bills and
budgets are small change. What molds move
ments and alters the direction of public policy
is the interplay of ideas, and the ultimate
dominance of a theme persistently and per
suasively sold.
Nofziger, who also served on President Nix
on's White House staff and as deputy director
of communications for the Republican Na
tional Committee before returning to head
Reagan's Citizens for the Republic political
action committee after the 1976 election,
wrote in a 1974 article in California Journal:
"The secret of successful propaganda —
whether selling cigarettes, soda pop or poli
tics — is repetition, saying the same thing
again and again and again.^Republicans need
to learn this lesson and practice it. Democrats
over the years have learned well the Fabian
philosophy of gaining a goal a step at a time."
"Government — alone — is the cause of in
flation. Government is the only business in the
world which can continue to exist while ignor
ing every sensible rule of economics," Rea
gan the candidate frequently fumed. "Gov
ernment does not produce revenue. It con
sumes it." He believed the secret to good gov
ernment was to bring in efficient executives
from the private sector and let them manage
government like a business. His 1966 cam
paign dubbed this the "Creative Society," an
attempt to one-up President Lyndon John
son's Great Society through private sector
solutions.
Though Reagan's "Creative Society" was a
public relations slogan and not a legislative
program, he did bring the new faces into gov
ernment as he promised, mostly successful
young businessmen from Southern California.
Few had any experience in state government,
which is one reason they were chosen.
"We weren't just amateurs," admitted
Nofziger. "We were novice amateurs." The
new governor and his cast of enthusiastic
young conservatives were so green that their
first official act was accidentally swearing
Reagan into office fully two weeks before the
scheduled gala inaugural.
At the official inauguration on Jan. 2, 1967,
Reagan again took the oath of office at an un
usual midnight ceremony. Several commen
tators suggested his insistence that the swear
ing-in take place at precisely 12:10 a.m.
stemmed from his belief in astrology and the
fact the sign of the kings would have its
strongest influence on his birth star at that
moment.
Characteristically, his first words as chief
executive was a one-liner. "Well George, here
we are on the late, late show again," he re
marked to U.S. Sen. George Murphy, a friend
with whom Reagan had co-starred in movies
years before. The two would later face a mini
scandal together when Nixon administration
auditors from the federal Office of Equal Op
portunity revealed in April, 1971, that Rea
gan's state OEO had violated federal rules by
replacing the professional staff with former
FBI and CIA agents recruited from conserva
tive campaign staffs. A separate OEO audit
discovered the state agency, headed by the

former public relations director of the John
Birch Society, had misspent some $233,000 in
poverty funds to conduct "specifically pro
hibited" surveillance and tailing of welfare
recipients and to solicit support for Sen
Murphy's reelection campaign.
Serious again, the new governor told those
assembled, "For many years now, you and I
have been shushed like children and told that
there are no simple solutions to the complex
problems that are beyond our comprehension
Well, the truth is, there are simple answers —
there are just not easy ones." He called on the
Prince of Peace to guide his cause and prom
ised to "squeeze and cut and trim until we re
duce the cost of government "
Reagan's philosophy of government
proved far closer to Dwight D. Eisen
hower's than Nixon's. Reagan is no
creature of the legislature. He was an essen
tially passive executive who found wheeling
and dealing unpleasant. He believed the legis
lature should initiate and the executive should
veto, or sometimes sign, the legislation. "I
look at everything with an open mind before I
vote no," he once joked to a state senator.
"Reagan never tried to do business except
directly with the people. The legislature was a
place he didn't understand, where you get
mired down by the sort of street politics he
wanted no part of," said William Hauck, top
aide to former Democratic Assembly Speaker
Robert Moretti.
Republican Speaker Robert Monagan
echoed Hauck and other legislators, claiming
that even during the two years the Re
publicans had a majority in both the state As
sembly and Senate, "he (Reagan) never
called me or sought to see me."
Monagan and other Republicans claim Rea
gan proved generally inept at using the legis
lature to achieve his ends. "He would never
consult in advance with legislators about what
he was going to do," Monagan added. "There
were a lot of legislators. Republicans of
course, who were dying to help him, and who
were actually rebuffed. He wanted to be as far
removed from people as he possibly could. He
was very bipartisan in this regard."
The one area of government which drew
Reagan's personal and passionate involve
ment was fiscal restraint, but his single
minded determination to save money often
seemed to blind him to larger purposes of gov
ernment. For example, Reagan entered office
in 1967 set to keep his campaign promise to cut
state spending 10 percent. (During the 1980
campaign he said: "Can anyone honestly be
lieve we can't find 12 percent fat in the federal
budget?")
When his department heads reported the in
evitable news that 10 percent in "fat" could
not be found and instead requested huge
budget increases, Reagan chose the mental
health budget for a symbolic last stand on
cost-cutting. Writing in the California Jour-

I nlike typically acquisitive
politicians, Reagan does not
seek mere promotion, power
or prestige. He literally seeks
the medium of the presidency,
primarily for its use as a 'bully
pulpit.'

nal, journalist Lou Cannon described it as
"Reagan's most ill-conceived budget reduc
tion — his psychologically damaging attempt
to apply his 10 percent across the board reduc
tion to state mental hospitals. . .
The ensuing public uproar forced Gov. Rea
gan to abandon the plan, but the incident
helped spark a recall proposition effort which
gathered more than 300.000 signatures during
his first year in office and produced a nasty lit
tle book entitled The Real Ronald Reagan.
Ironically, Reagan finally accepted a
budget that year 25 percent higher than Pat
Brown's last budget, necessitating the $1
billion tax increase he rammed through the
Assembly over the opposition of conservative
Republicans.
Despite the unpopularity of his focusing the
budget-cutting crusade on mental health hos
pitals and higher education during 1967, in 1968
Reagan proposed austerity measures includ
ing a $1 per visit fee on indigent Medi-Cal pa
tients and cutbacks in about 100 areas of ser
vice in the care for crippled children pro
gram. About 5000 children who would have
qualified for treatment under the program
would not receive it under the proposed cut
backs, according to the Los Angeles Times.
In 1969, when the state legislature passed a
$5 million school lunch program. Reagan used
his line-item veto power to cut the appropria
tion by 90 percent, to $500,000. A study later
conducted by a federal examiner appointed by
the Nixon administration confirmed the legis
lature's assertion that thousands of poor
school kids in California were malnourished
because AFDC benefits had not increased
since 1958.
According to several of the governor 's close
associates, Gov. Reagan would often respond
generously to appeals for help from individ
uals who wrote him with a hard-luck story.
But when people were reduced to statistics
and their problems to budget entries, Reagan
became a cold cost-cutter. He persistently re
ferred to government as a business en
terprise, as if major state functions in educa
tion, welfare, mental health, environmental
and worker protection could be measured on a
profit and loss statement.
When President Reagan awakes to the re
alities of a largely non-discretionary federal
budget, watch for him to go after the cost-of
living index as a way to quietly cut Social Se
curity benefits for the elderly, to lop 13 weeks
off unemployment compensation period and
to cancel food stamps
