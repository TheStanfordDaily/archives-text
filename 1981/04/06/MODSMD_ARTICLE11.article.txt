## Martin Ray Focus on population control 
### 
The article entitled "Over
population not the villain., by
L.H. Gann (Daily, March 31)
missed the point of overpopula
tion problems. Focusing on hun
ger. it dismisses studies of
world overpopulation effects as
pessimistic, asserts that over
population is not a serious prob
lem, and implies that world re
sources are unlimited and little
exploited It lashes out at pro
fessors and planners and their
efforts to warn and educate less
informed people.
In fact, overpopulation is a
real problem, resulting in more
serious consequences than
world hunger. As we multiply,
we increase our need for land,
energy and technological activi
ty. We crowd out animals and
plants which form the basis for
ecosystems which support life.
Our growing demand for
elemental requirements like
food and clothes, or perceived
requirements to maintain our
share of land and resources, like
arms, reduces the importance
of cultural, traditional and sci
entific activities.
We are seeing this reduction
currently as the Reagan admin
istration cuts support for sci
ence, arts and humanities in fa
vor of military spending. The
degradation of culture and
knowledge reduces our quality
of life. Quality of life is further
diminished by the reduction in
land, resources and energy
available per person, the crowd
ing of cities and parks, and the
destruction and domestication
of wild lands and organisms.
Inevitable mass suffering and
the threat of extinction of the
human species will be caused by
the snowballing of five major
factors: environmental disrup
tion; the collapse of technolog
ical society due to depleted non
renewable resources;the threat
of thermonuclear war; and in
creasing individual special
ization causing greater depen
dence on society.

The resources of this planet
are inherently finite in their
ability to support life and it is a
grave error to believe them to
be largely unexploited. Human
activities have succeeded in a
virtual rape and pillage of the
fragile ecosystems that provide
us with food energy and oxygen,
the very substance of our bod
ies. Little by little, we are mak
ing a big mistake.
The attitude represented in
Gann's article is one that re
fuses to see the long term ef
fects of many individual self-in
terest activities on a grand
scale. Overpopulation is one re
sult of this attitude, combine the
attitude and overpopulation to
gether and we get energy prob
lems, pollution, and other global
headaches. As population in
creases, the cycle is self-rein
forcing.
Individuals are not necessar
ily the best judges of which indi
vidual actions help or hurt the
human species, since they may
not see the big picture. They
rarely think that the things they
do affect large scale problems.
Nobody enjoys smog — but indi
viduals don't like pollution con
trol devices or giving up driv
ing. When millions of people "do
their own thing" in this manner
the result is a big problem —
smog.
Solutions to problems like pol
lution and the energy crisis may
then be reached because these
are all inherently problems of
overpopulation. The aim of pro
fessors, planners and their re
ports is to educate people and to
encourage these kinds of con
structive solutions.
If we take care of the planet,
it will take care of us. If. on the
other hand, we allow our popu
lation to grow to a point where
our activities permanently up
set this ecosystem we depend
upon, we will go down with the
ship.
We should use our foresight
wisely to protect us from

ourselves. We must allow for
the rights of other organisms on
this planet and realize how
much we owe them and depend
upon them.
The great tragedy would be if
what was lost due to misin
formed, misguided action on
our part was not just the human
species but the entire diversity
of lifeforms which evolved
before us. We have the informa
tion necessary to choose life
over oblivion. Let's change our
course!
