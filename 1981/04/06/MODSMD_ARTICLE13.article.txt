## Peur et Degout (Fear and Loathing) at French House 
### 
The French House, according
to the brochure that sits on a
table in the entranceway, offers
a unique cultural milieu in
which to sample the many joys
of French society and French
cuisine — only a short walk
away from the heart of campus.
The brochure goes on to say (in
somewhat broken English) that
eating associates contribute
greatly to the lively cultural ex
change and international at
mosphere of the house. One can
hardly imagine a more idyllic
arrangement: authentic French
cuisine delivered to your table
for a mere two hundred dollars a
quarter. It seems hard to be
lieve that, in recent years, the
house has been consistently un
able to meet its quota of eating
associates.
Last quarter, I decided that
eating dinner at a culture house
would be an ideal way to counter
the almost inevitable isolation
of a grad student living off cam
pus, and the French House also
offered the chance to bone up on
my French for the English de

partment's foreign language re
quirement. To make things even
more attractive, three people in
similar situations — a recent
graduate and two seniors living
off campus — had also signed up
as eating associates. I looked
forward to an engaging quarter
of good food, brilliant bilingual
conversation, and all the French
culture I could absorb. But as
someone once said of France,
it's much too good for the
French: I soon realized that
same maxim applies to the
French House.
In some past era, the house
was given the improbable name
of Guthrie House, which sounds
like it belongs to a clapboard
farmhouse in Oklahoma instead
of to this ornate but asym
metrical gothic mansion,
painted a fairy-tale chocolate
brown with bright red trim. The
house seems to cry out "Me re
gar dez! Look at me!" as you
walk along Mayfield.
Once inside the heavy wooden
door, this feeling of gleeful
kitsch is, if anything, in

tensified. A French flag hangs
sideway from the door frame, a
large oomputer printout an
nounces "La Maison Fran
caise," maps and framed photo
graphs of Paris hang in the din
ing room, and a chalkboard
menu describes (in French, of
course) the day's meal in such
enigmatic euphemisms as fruits
de mer (fruits of the sea) and
Cotelettes decouuertes (un
covered cutlets).
The dinner bell is rung shortly
after six, and the forty or so res
idents and eating associates file
in to take their places at the long
wooden tables. The first day, we
made the acquaintance of one
house resident sitting at our
table when he threw a wadded
up napkin at one of our plates,
shouting "You! What's your
name?" Thereafter, we were
generally left alone at our table,
the residents sometimes going
to great lengths to crowd them
selves around the other tables.
Not that we minded, especially:
that meant more food for us, al
though other residents had few

qualms about bringing their
plates over to our table and help
ing themselves to a particularly
choice fruit de mer. And al
though we may have been slight
ly paranoid, it seemed that they
always served us last, no matter
where in the room we sat.
Dessert was always a festive
occasion. The two staples —
bulk ice cream in strange new
varieties and orange jello
flavored with St. Joseph's chil
dren's aspirin — occasionally
gave way to baked apples and
gingerbread, both of which (to
our horror and disbelief) were
served with sour cream.
At least once during every
meal, one of the residents would
tap a fork on his or her plate, and
stand up to address the room in
a charming, mellifluous French
accent. It was quite a shock to
later hear these orators speak
ing in a rather undistinguished,
nasal English, and we soon un
derstood why they were rabid
francophiles: if your native lan
guage came out sounding like
that, you'd embrace a more
melodious foreign tongue just as
enthusiastically.
Once or twice, we were sin
gled out during the meal: the
house's business manager, a
well-groomed fellow who
always carried a clipboard, an
nounced that it had come to his
attention that "certain eating
associates" were neglecting to
properly bus their dishes. There
seemed to be an underlying as
sumption that eating associates
were automatically assumed to
be guilty until proven innocent
(a truism under French law),
and to be grouped with ter
rorists, rapists, and other
known criminals. All of a sud
den, we felt that we had become
a despised minority, singled out
in our shame as surely as if we
had been forced to shave our
heads and wear badges marked
"E.A."
Crushed by the unfairness of
this accusation, I approached
the business manager and
argued that we had been busing
our plates with painstaking
care. He looked at me, aghast
that a mere eating associate
would have the temerity to ad
dress a resident, and finally
deigned to reply that he "hadn't
meant us." But then why single
us out? The four of us made up a
clear majority of the eating as
sociates present that night. I
suppose if the JDL had planted a
bomb under one of the tables, he
would have announced that
"certain Jews" were respon
sible.
The next major skirmish oc
curred when the residents neg
lected to inform we eating as
sociates that Monday was
"bring your own sandwich
night," no doubt a French na
tional holiday. When we arrived
at the usual time, the residents

looked at us with shocked recog
nition - "My god, what if the eat
ing associates didn't bring any
thing?" We were finally told
that maybe we could bum a
piece of salami off someone. No
thanks.
My final bone to pick (or as
the French would say in their
own inimitable way, slitch to
unravel) is the system of sign
ing up guests. At the beginning
of the quarter, we were told that
we could bring guests to dinner
at a percentage of the regular
meal cost. However, we had to
plan far enough in advance to
sign up on the little Invitees
sheet. Since it soon became
clear that some of the "regu
lars" were going to be absent on
certain days of the week, we hit
upon the economical idea of
bringing our guests on these
days, when there was plenty of
extra food and many empty
seats. But somehow, the busi
ness manager got wind of this
scheme, and began to hover
over us, clipboard in hand, ac
cusing us of bringing in guests
when, in fact, some hapless vis
iting French student had made
the mistake of sitting down next
to us.
One could hardly mention the
business manager's name
without his scowling face pop
ping up out of nowhere: we soon
began to suspect that the tables
were bugged. We talked only in
hushed whispers and when we
were sure that his attention was
diverted.
We imagined his clipboard to
be something like Santa Claus's
list of good and bad children,
and suspected that every infrac
tion of proper French etti
quette, however small, was duly
recorded on that clipboard, and
totalled up at the end of the
week. Laughing too loud on
Monday, eating too many french
fries on Tuesday, not finishing
his milk on Wednesday . . .
Slowly but surely, the case
against the eating associates
mounted.
Needless to say, when the end
of the quarter rolled around, we
couldn't wait to get out. Three of
us defected to the German
House, some thirty feet to the
south, across a strip of lawn that
is sometimes called Alsace-Lor
raine. Now, as we munch con
tentedly on heaps of starch and
— bliss! — cake without sour
cream, we think back with a
certain fond nostalgia of the
nameless culinary creations of
Michel and Babette. But should
the German House ever follow
the initiative of its namesake by
invading the French House, the
three of us will be out in front,
carrying the Austrian flag and
gaily whistling "Deutschland,
Deutschland, Über Alles."
