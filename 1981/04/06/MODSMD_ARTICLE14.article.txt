## Reagan's vendetta against legal aid for poor 
### 
Finally, a few faint cries are
being raised against hypocrisy
and dangers underlying Ronald
Reagan's ideological war
against the underprivileged in
the name of fighting inflation.
While Reagan chips away at
federal welfare services at $200
million a crack, he simultane
ously vows to protect a new
wave of corporate socialism —
$1 billion more for Chrysler.
$100 million more to the energy
corporations to develop syn
thetic fuel,, and $1.4 trillion
more to defense contractors by
1985 — a total of more than $1000
from every man, woman and
child in America every year.
As The New York Times edi
torialized on Sunday, March 29,
"Increasingly we're dogged by
the suspicion that he also has an
other enemy (besides inflation)
in mind: the philosophy of social
justice this country has evolved
over the last 50 years."

Nowhere are Reagan's true
motives and callousness more
obvious than in his proposal to
discontinue federal legal ser
vices for the poor. Legal Ser
vices attorneys play the same
role in civil law that public de
fenders play in criminal law —
providing a chance for poor
citizens to obtain legal repre
sentation.
Legal Services has enjoyed
broad bipartisan support from
the legal community, including
the American Bar Association.
The ABA champions the pro
gram because of the undeniable
need for it and because it keeps
indigent clients from tres
passing upon the consciences
and waiting rooms of big corpo
rate law firms.
It is precisely because of the
successful representation of
tens of thousands of clients with
a relatively tiny budget that
conservatives seek its termi

nation. What sticks in the Great
Communicator's craw is that
the federal poverty lawyers
have brought a substantial
number of class action and oth
er lawsuits over the years that
have forced state and local gov
ernments to protect the rights of
workers and increase health and
welfare benefits.
Reagan's determination to
eliminate federal legal services
for the poor is no new product of
his cost-cutting program or an
effort to transfer the control of
worth programs to local levels
as he claims. Far from advocat
ing that California operate a le
gal services program of its own.
Governor Reagan made the
abolition of legal services a top
priority. His reasons were
mostly ideological. For exam
ple, landlords and agribusiness
interests did not like federal at
torneys representing tenants or
Chicano fieldhands. More per
sonally, the agency handed Rea
gan one of his most embarassing
defeats, exposing one of the
more blatant abuses of his
power in Sacramento.
Reagan's vendetta dates back
to 1970 when federal poverty
lawyers working for California
Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA)
successfully challenged the"gov
ernor's illegal attempts to cut
welfare benefits by adminis
trative fiat. Reagan packed his
State Office of Equal Opportuni
ty (OEO) with investigators
who manufactured a fraudulent
series of charges to justify Rea
gan's veto of the program. In
1974 Congress created an inde
pendent Legal Services Corpo
ration to administer the pro
gram, specifically to prevent
such political interferences.
In July 1970, Reagan ap
pointed Lewis Uhler as director
of State OEO. The appointment
appeared aimed directly at
CRLA. Within months Uhler
had replaced most of the pro
fessional staff and produced a
mammoth report charging that
federal poverty lawyers were
incompetent, inefficient, en
couraged prison riots, conspired
with Angela Davis and the
Soledad Brothers, and con
ducted other "radical," "revo
lutionary,"' and "illegal acts."
Despite intense pressure
from the Nixon White House to
accommodate Reagan on CRLA
funding, Frank Carlucci, then
federal OEO director and now

Deputy Secretary of Defense,
appointed three retired state su
preme court justices — all Re
publicans — to investigate Rea
gan's allegations and make rec
ommendations.
Reagan demanded that the
justices hold all sessions in se
cret and not admit evidence re
butting the Uhler report. When
they refused, Reagan an
nounced that the state would not
participate in the federal in
quiry.
Reagan's motivation for
trying to halt the investigation
by his fellow Republicans be
came transparent when the
Sacramento Bee published
articles on a harsh report filed
by 15 federal OEO officials who
had been investigating Rea
gan's State OEO.
The report found that Uhler
was using federal funds in an at
tempt to harass and destroy fed
eral poverty programs. It con
cluded that the OEO was "using
a majority of its staff to per
form investigatory functions."
Uhler later testified that among
his "social workers" were in
deed former police, FBI and
CIA agents recruited from vari
ous conservative campaign
staffs. When Uhler's involve
ment with the John Birch socie
ty became public, one Re
publican leader was moved to
quip, "It's like putting arsonists
in charge of the fire depart
ment."
After yet another federal
team of investigators un
covered the misspending of over
$100,000 in poverty funds, in
cluding $2,102 for "soliciting
support for Sen. George
Murphy" in the 1970 election,
Reagan moved to counter the
impact of these unfavorable
revelations. He accused the fed
eral investigators of hindering
his administration, and charged
the panel of justices were en
gaged in mere "fun and
games." Despite contrary as
surances from local police, Rea
gan publicly insisted that CRLA
attorneys had firebombed an
anti-CRLA witness' office in
Salinas. He further charged the
lawyers with a "brazen" and
"dishonorable" scheme to pres
ent false testimony to the three
justice commission.
When the justices released
their report, they could barely

conceal their contempt for Rea
gan's accusations. They con
cluded: "The Uhler Report . . .
has taken evidence out of con
text and misrepresented the
facts to support the charges
against the CRLA . . . has un
fairly and irresponsibly sub
jected many able, energetic,
idealistic and dedicated CRLA
attorneys to totally unjustified
attacks upon their professional
integrity and competence . . .
the Commission finds these
charges totally irresponsible
and without foundation."
Maybe President Reagan and
his Prime Minister Meese real
ly believe that law firms will
step in and represent tenants
against landlords or poor blacks
or women against dis
criminatory employers. Or
maybe they believe in a "free
market" redistribution of
"equal justice." Maybe they
just carry a grudge against the
highly successful CRLA.
Whatever Reagan's motives,
lawyers, students, professors
and citizens alike should oppose
this extravagent example of
New Right selfishness. And
more importantly, students
should become aroused by Rea
gan's ravaging, under cover of
an anti-inflation program, of the
"philosophy of social justice
this country has evolved over
the past 50 years."
