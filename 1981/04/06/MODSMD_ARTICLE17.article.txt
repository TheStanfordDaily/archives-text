## Overcrowded prison Texas inmate kills two 
### 
Huntsville, Texas (AP) â€” A
maximum security inmate ap
parently drowned the warden of
a state prison in a shallow ditch
Saturday after fatally shooting
the manager of the prison's
farm, a Texas Department of
Corrections official said.
The prisoner, a 30-year-old
convicted robber who was serv
ing a 12-year term, was cap
tured within 15 minutes of the
incident, which occurred short
ly after noon Saturday at a farm
area of the Ellis Unit of the Tex
as Department of Corrections.
The body of Wallace Pack,
warden of the 3000-inmate unit,
was found face down in a shal
low ditch in about two feet of
"dark, muddy water," prison
spokesman Rick Hartley said.
He said there was no blood on
Pack's body, but he had ap
parently been beaten and
drowned.
The body of prison farm man

ager Maj. Billy Max Moore was
found about 40 yards away near
his flatbed truck. He had been
shot once in the head, Hartley
said.
"Apparently, after Mr.
Moore was fatally struck," said
Hartley, "the inmate became
involved in an altercation with
the warden. They scuffled from
the original scene, across a
road, down an embankment and
apparently into the water," a
shallow ditch that runs through
the prison farm in an area
known as "the bottom."
Both men were pronounced
dead at the scene. Their bodies
were taken to Houston, about 75
miles south of Huntsville, for
autopsies.
Officials declined to name the
inmate, but said he had per
mission to work outside the pris
on walls and was assigned to the
farm shop.
Hartley said the incident in

volved only one inmate, and said
all was quiet Saturday evening
at the Ellis Unit, which houses
death row inmates and other
maximum security prisoners.
"The inmate had been taken
from the farm shop of the unit to
the garden shop because he had
violated a disciplinary rule,"
Hartley said.
"At the same time, the war
den drove up and apparently,
the inmate bolted out of the
truck and that's when the scuf
fle took place."
Gun recovered
The gun used to kill Moore
was recovered later in the ditch
after authorities drained the
ditch.
The incident came three
months after U.S. District
Judge William Wayne Justice
ruled that the Texas prison sys
tem was vastly overcrowded
and ordered sweeping changes
in health care, housing and in
mate protection.
The state Legislature is cur
rently considering a bill that
would provide $35 million to up
grade prison facilities, but the
proposal is stalled in a joint con
ference committee.
In 1974, an 11-day siege at the
Texas prison left two inmates
and two prison workers dead.
