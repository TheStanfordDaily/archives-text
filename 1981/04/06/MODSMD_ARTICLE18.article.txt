# Pickets determined to win in coal war

Naugatuck, W.Va. (AP) —
The pickets shivered in the
pre-dawn darkness, talking
softly with the line of state
troopers as they watched the
road leading to the besieged
non-union mine.
"We don't care what it
takes — this is war," said a
man who began his stint pick
eting the mine run by Mar
rowbone Development Corp.
about two hours before, at 3
a.m.
At the other end of the
road, a few mine guards
peered back at the pickets,
who have numbered more
than 100 on some days. "They
moved to shut this place
down. And that's what they
accomplished right quick," a
guard said. He did not want
to be identified.
The mine in the heart of
Mingo "County, where the
United Mine Workers was or
ganized amid bloody coal
wars, has become a symbol
of a new battle over the
future of the union and the in
dustry.
The pickets, who went on
strike with 160,000 other
UMW miners when their con
tract expired March 27, see a
trend toward non-union
mines they fear threaten the
union's existence. UMW
miners, who once dominated
the coalfields, now produce
only about half of the na
tion's soft coal.
"This is one of the biggest
mines in West Virginia. And
it's right in the middle of Dis
trict 17 and we can't have
that," said one picket, who
like the others interviewed
Friday and Saturday, re
fused to identify himself.
"We've just got to organize
these mines."
"The operators are getting
money and everything they
want," said another picket.
Coal industry officials,

who also asked not to be iden
tified, say the UMW has out
lived its usefulness and now
impedes production at a time
when demand for coal finally
is reviving.
"All our people want is the
right to go in and out and
work. This is America and
they should have that right,"
said Howard Persinger,
Marrowbone's attorney.
"True it's a non-union mine.
But that's just their right and
choice."
There are actually two
deep mines and a strip mine
on the site run by Mar
rowbone, a subsidiary of
A.T. Massey Co., and the
mine has not produced any
coal since pickets appeared
March 30. About a dozen
mine guards said they had
been bottled up since pick
eting began, and were living
on stored provisions.
Some pickets complained
the UMW has not helped.
"We need some help to show
unity. We need financial sup
port. We're all out of work
and this is costing us," said
one of their leaders.
The other men nodded as
one picket said "Old (UMW
President Sam) Church says
he's going to organize this
outfit (but he's not). . . . Our
organization let us down."
A proposed contract with
the Bituminous Coal Opera
tors Association was de
feated decisively last Tues
day after many miners said
it would weaken the UMW.
Without a union, the pickets
said miners would be de
fenseless.
On Friday, a non-union
miner was fatally shot after»
an apparent argument in a
bar, and a striking UMW
miner has been charged with
his murder — the first fatal
ity seemingly related to the
strike.
