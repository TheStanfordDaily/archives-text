# Weekend symposium
## Women in medicine discuss career goals 
### Brian Sprague 
The problems faced by women in
medicine were the focal point of an all
day conference held at the Center for
Educational Research At Stanford
(CERAS) Saturday.
The seminar, entitled "Designing
your Medical Career," attracted
about 100 female physicians, medical
students and interns from medical
school. Its sponsor, the Katherine Mc-
Cormick Society of the Stanford Medi
cal School, is an organization of wom
en faculty and research staff at Stan
ford's medical school who strive to
eliminate individual and institutional
obstacles that hinder females in the
medical profession.
The conference was the brainchild
of two medical students, Laura Es
serman and Barbara Paul. "Today,
despite the growing participation of
women in all professional fields, wom
en are still dismally represented in
many areas of medicine. It is the
scarcity of women on medical facul
ties that was the impetus behind the
organization of this conference," Es
serman said.
Conference goals
The conference was designed to
gather medical women together for
support, to plan strategies and meth
ods to attain desired goals and to dis
cuss the existing social and individual
problems facing professional women
and methods to overcome them, she
said.
The conference included two panel
discussions with female physicians,
workshops and a film on the historical
perspectives of women in medicine.

"The workshops are specifically to
put into practice the problems we
brought up in the discussions," Es
serman said.
Shared residencies
One panel discussion touched on
shared residencies, job sharing and
the administrative impediments to in
stituting more female positions at
Stanford. Another considered the dif
ficulties women face when they try to
combine the tasks of raising a family
and maintaining a career. Panelists
also discussed the advantages and dis
advantages of private versus academ
ic practice.
"We are trying to encourage more
women (to enter) the academic
field," according to Dr. Joan Kendig,
an associate professor of anesthesia at
the Medical School. One barrier wom
en face is the lack of "role models" for
female medical students to emulate
and look up to, she said.
In addition, women face a time con
straint. "Because there are so few of
us, we get put on every committee and
thus we have less time to spend with
the female students who really need
us," Kendig said.
Lack of female faculty
"Less than 10 percent of medical
school faculty at all ranks are
female," Esserman said. "Also, over
50 percent of American medical
schools do not have female represen
tation in any type of administrative
position."
Themes of the workshops varied
from maintaining femininity in
stressful situations to resume building
and writing. But Esserman em
phasized that the workshops were

more than just large counseling ses
sions.
"I think it's important for women to
think about their future. And it's very
difficult to do it by yourself. It makes
you feel a lot better when you find out
there are many other women out there
in the same position as you," she said.
'Seminar was helpful'
Participants said they felt the semi
nar was helpful. "Not only did it make
you think about the problems (wom
en) will face, but we got to hear about
the personal lives of the doctors,
which you don't get over at the (Medi
cal) Center," one medical student

said.
"It's important to work through in
advance the future problems women
physicians will face," Kendig said.
"These problems usually focus on how
to deal with relationships with col
leagues who inevitably will be
male,"she added.
Women in general need more ex
perience with power and responsi
bility, Kendig said. "We are taught as
children to play the passive role, not to
take responsibility for decisions."
Kendig said she felt this conference
would aid women in overcoming this
obstacle.
