# Reagan briefed fully on European situation
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, running an
intermittent fever and showing
traces of particles in his dam
aged lung, conferred briefly
yesterday with Vice President
George Bush, who described
him as "fully on top of the situ
ation" in Eastern Europe.
The president also met with
Vernon Jordan, the civil rights
leader who also was the target
of an assassination attempt.
The particles discovered in
Reagan's wounded left lung are
"most likely . . . either dried
blood or damaged tissue" that
reflect normal scarring and
debris, said Dr. Dennis
O'Leary. They were found in a
series of chest X-rays taken yes
terday morning.
"We don't believe this is out
of the ordinary," said O'Leary.
But he added: "We'd rather it
was clearing." A White House
medical statement said that the
"persistent lung infiltrates," as
the particles are called, "would
be expected to resolve quite
slowly."
Jordan returns visit
Jordan, president of the Na
tional Urban League, was vis
ited by Reagan in a New York
City hospital last August while
recovering from wounds suf
fered in an assassination at
tempt last May in Fort Wayne,
Ind.
David Fischer, the presi
dent's appointments secretary,
said the meeting in Reagan's
room at the George Washington
University Hospital was "very
warm and personal." He said
the president commented to
Jordan, in a reference to their
earlier hospital meeting, "this
is a switch."
"It sure hurts to get shot."

the president said, echoing a
comment he made earlier in the
week when he told visiting sena
tors, "I found out it hurts to get
shot."
'Hurts like hell'
Jordan, according to Fischer,
replied, "It hurts like hell. It
hurts like hell."
"The secret is, I did ev
erything I was told. I never
fussed." Jordan was quoted as
saying. "I remember so vividly
your visit to me. It meant so
much."
And then he told the presi
dent: "I'll see you at work."
Fischer's account of the
dialogue was relayed by assis
tant White House press secre
tary David Prosperi, who said
Reagan and Jordan met from
11:50 a.m. until 11:57 a.m.
While Jordan visited the pres
ident, first lady Nancy Reagan
attended services at the Na
tional Presbyterian Church.
Prayer for president
There, the Rev. Louis Evans
prayed for the president, the
three others wounded with him,
and for God's help against the
"sickness in the heart of Ameri
ca" that struck Reagan. Mrs.
Reagan was accompanied by
her brother, Dr. Richard Davis.
Meanwhile, a medical bullet
in reported that James Brady,
Reagan's press secretary who
was the most seriously wounded
of the four people shot in last
Monday's assassination at
tempt, was using more sophisti
cated speech and could clearly
recognize his wife, Sarah.
The report said that Brady,
whose brain was pierced by a
bullet, commented Saturday
evening on his injury by remark
ing that, "The bear (his
nickname) was certainly in the

wrong place that time."
The statement said Mrs.
Brady had told her husband
about the president's injury and
that the president was being
treated in the same hospital.
Short visit
Bush spent 10 minutes with
Reagan, arriving in the presi
dent's suite at 9:20 a.m. In addi
tion to "personal matters," the
topics included Secretary of
State Alexander Haig's trip to
the Middle East and an update
on developments in Poland,
Prosperi said.
Bush, declining to go into de
tail, told reporters outside the
hospital that he left Reagan
"some information to .ead."
Asked for the president's re
action to Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev's sudden trip

yesterday to Czechoslovakia for
a Communist Party meeting
likely to focus on Poland's labor
unrest, Bush said:
"He is fully on top of the situ
ation. That's the main point that
I want to make."
O'Leary, dean for clinical af
fairs at the George Washington
University medical school, said
there was "nothing in the cul
tures" taken from the presi
dent's blood or urine or in a
sputum smear examined by an
infectious disease specialist
that would indicate bacteria.
He said there was neither any
sign of active bleeding in the
president's injured left lung or
of pneumonia setting in.
Fever common development
Fever, which the president
has been running at least since

Friday, is sometimes an indica
tion of a bacteria-related infec
tion. But it is also a common de
velopment following surgery
such as the president's, doctors
say.
The president's temperature,
"intermittently elevated to
moderate levels through the
evening," and returned to nor
mal in the morning, the White
House statement said. Body
temperature is generally lower
in the morning than in the later
part of the day.
O'Leary on Saturday de
scribed a "moderate" fever as
being between 101 degrees
Fahrenheit and 103 degrees.
Normal is 98.6 degrees.
Reagan seemed to have a
healthy appetite.

House statement said. Body
temperature is generally lower
in the morning than in the later
part of the day.
O'Leary on Saturday de
scribed a "moderate" fever as
being between 101 degrees
Fahrenheit and 103 degrees.
Normal is 98.6 degrees.
Reagan seemed to have a
healthy appetite.
Washington (AP) — Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, running an
intermittent fever and showing
traces of particles in his dam
aged lung, conferred briefly
yesterday with Vice President
George Bush, who described
him as "fully on top of the situ
ation" in Eastern Europe.
The president also met with
Vernon Jordan, the civil rights
leader who also was the target
of an assassination attempt.
The particles discovered in
Reagan's wounded left lung are
"most likely . . . either dried
blood or damaged tissue" that
reflect normal scarring and
debris, said Dr. Dennis
O'Leary. They were found in a
series of chest X-rays taken yes
terday morning.
"We don't believe this is out
of the ordinary," said O'Leary.
But he added: "We'd rather it
was clearing." A White House
medical statement said that the
"persistent lung infiltrates," as
the particles are called, "would
be expected to resolve quite
slowly."
Jordan returns visit
Jordan, president of the Na
tional Urban League, was vis
ited by Reagan in a New York
City hospital last August while
recovering from wounds suf
fered in an assassination at
tempt last May in Fort Wayne,
Ind.
David Fischer, the presi
dent's appointments secretary,
said the meeting in Reagan's
room at the George Washington
University Hospital was "very
warm and personal." He said
the president commented to
Jordan, in a reference to their
earlier hospital meeting, "this
is a switch."
"It sure hurts to get shot."

the president said, echoing a
comment he made earlier in the
week when he told visiting sena
tors, "I found out it hurts to get
shot."
'Hurts like hell'
Jordan, according to Fischer,
replied, "It hurts like hell. It
hurts like hell."
"The secret is, I did ev
erything I was told. I never
fussed." Jordan was quoted as
saying. "I remember so vividly
your visit to me. It meant so
much."
And then he told the presi
dent: "I'll see you at work."
Fischer's account of the
dialogue was relayed by assis
tant White House press secre
tary David Prosperi, who said
Reagan and Jordan met from
11:50 a.m. until 11:57 a.m.
While Jordan visited the pres
ident, first lady Nancy Reagan
attended services at the Na
tional Presbyterian Church.
Prayer for president
There, the Rev. Louis Evans
prayed for the president, the
three others wounded with him,
and for God's help against the
"sickness in the heart of Ameri
ca" that struck Reagan. Mrs.
Reagan was accompanied by
her brother, Dr. Richard Davis.
Meanwhile, a medical bullet
in reported that James Brady,
Reagan's press secretary who
was the most seriously wounded
of the four people shot in last
Monday's assassination at
tempt, was using more sophisti
cated speech and could clearly
recognize his wife, Sarah.
The report said that Brady,
whose brain was pierced by a
bullet, commented Saturday
evening on his injury by remark
ing that, "The bear (his
nickname) was certainly in the

wrong place that time."
The statement said Mrs.
Brady had told her husband
about the president's injury and
that the president was being
treated in the same hospital.
Short visit
Bush spent 10 minutes with
Reagan, arriving in the presi
dent's suite at 9:20 a.m. In addi
tion to "personal matters," the
topics included Secretary of
State Alexander Haig's trip to
the Middle East and an update
on developments in Poland,
Prosperi said.
Bush, declining to go into de
tail, told reporters outside the
hospital that he left Reagan
"some information to .ead."
Asked for the president's re
action to Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev's sudden trip

yesterday to Czechoslovakia for
a Communist Party meeting
likely to focus on Poland's labor
unrest, Bush said:
"He is fully on top of the situ
ation. That's the main point that
I want to make."
O'Leary, dean for clinical af
fairs at the George Washington
University medical school, said
there was "nothing in the cul
tures" taken from the presi
dent's blood or urine or in a
sputum smear examined by an
infectious disease specialist
that would indicate bacteria.
He said there was neither any
sign of active bleeding in the
president's injured left lung or
of pneumonia setting in.
Fever common development
Fever, which the president
has been running at least since

Friday, is sometimes an indica
tion of a bacteria-related infec
tion. But it is also a common de
velopment following surgery
such as the president's, doctors
say.
The president's temperature,
"intermittently elevated to
moderate levels through the
evening," and returned to nor
mal in the morning, the White
House statement said. Body
temperature is generally lower
