# Atlanta mourns two more

Atlanta (AP) — A city that has buried a score of
young blacks mourned two more victims Satur
day, as 125 searchers fanned out across rugged
terrain seeking clues to the string of killings.
"Oh, Lord, please touch the murderers' hearts
and let them stop these crimes against these chil
dren," said the Rev. Johnny Jones as white-uni
formed nurses, wearing green ribbons symbol
izing concern for Atlanta's dead and missing chil
dren, comforted wailing members of 13-year-old
Timothy Hill's family.
Multi-colored flower arrangements filled the
Mt. Moriah Baptist Church during a double ser
vice for Hill and his 33-year-old cousin, Jimmie
Mattox, who died in a traffic accident Monday,
the day Hill's body was fished from the muddy
Chattahoochee River.
"How long will these attacks go on?" asked
Mayor Maynard Jackson at funeral services
earlier in the day for Eddie "Bubba" Duncan, a
21-year-old retarded black man whose body was
found in the same river last week.

"How long will the families of Atlanta be able
to take it? How long will I, as mayor, be able to
take it? How long will the police, working 24 hours
a day, seven days a week, be able to take it? The
answer is: as long as we have to ... We have no
choice but to endure, to be tougher than those who
would attack us," he said.
A special police task force is investigating the
slayings of 22 blacks — all children except for
Duncan. The task force also is investigating the
disappearance of two black youngsters.
Atlanta police, meanwhile, confirmed Satur
day night that a retarded black man, described as
appearing to be 14 to 15 years old, has been miss
ing since Monday, when he was seen getting into a
vehicle in a northwest Atlanta neighborhood.
Detective R A. Muwakkil of the police missing
persons unit said the man, Larry Rogers, is 20 or
21 years old, but stands only 5-foot-3 and weighs
110 pounds. Muwakkil said Rogers' disappearance
is being investigated by the missing persons unit,
and has not been turned over to the special task
force.
