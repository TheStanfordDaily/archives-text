# Unique course: 'Suntanning 101'
## 
### Diane Johnson 
A new class is now being
offered for those who wish to
perfect their tanning skills in
preparation for the upcom
ing spring months. Suntan
ning 101, coordinated by Rob
in Daus, a senior biology ma
jor, is held daily from
1:15-3:05 on the Roble sun
deck. First meeting during
registration week, the class
is "-5" units because "you
must drop a 5-unit class in or
der to fully benefit from it,"
said Daus.
The course began because
it allowed returning spring
break sun-worshippers an
opportunity to retain their
tans as well as a chance for
"Winter whities" to pick up
on hot suntanning tips. "I had
to go to New York for spring
vacation and must now
make up for lost time," ex
plained Werner Disse, a sen
ior economics major and de
voted sun worshipper.
According to Daus, 30-40
people attend the class daily.
No prerequisites exist
but all enroilees must have
perfect attendance in order
to pass. Disse added that the
final exam will consist of
"three hours of straight sun
ning - any trace of sunburn
results in an automatic fail."
There are no midterms be
cause "we try to keep the
course low-pressure," stated
Daus.
When asked what type of
lotion she recommends for
her class, Daus replied, "Al
though different brands must
be used to suit various skin
types, I advise the natural
look (no lotion)." One things
for sure . . . baby oil is out of
the question!
Suzie Alexander, an un
declared sophomore, is
known to be doing cancer re
search for the class. She has
scheduled no classes be
tween the hours of ten and

two to allow for extensive
cancer studies. She also goes
heavy on the baby oil to ac
celerate and enhance the ef
fects.
The class is carefully de
signed so as to not dis
criminate according to sex
or ability. "We especially en
courage all men because
there never seems to be
enough to go around," ex
plained Daus. Many students
choose the independent study
route because they can't at
tend the one to three o'clock
time slot.
The class has received
popular support from the
rest of the dorm. Posters on
many doors and walls help
publicize the class and 100
dollars was even granted to
purchase class equipment
. . . new lawn chairs for the
deck.
"One problem with the
class," cites Daus, "is that
many of the students get
bored easily. They're often
caught sleeping during the
period!"
No standard course text is
required. "Any trashy read
ing material will do," ex
plained Daus.
Debbie Gustafson, a
freshman, is described as the
class' prize recruit. "Un
fortunately," says Disse,
"we haven't located enough
funds to offer a full scholar
ship." That is one thing
they'll be working on . . .
along with a stereo system
for their listening and sun
tanning enjoyment, accord
ing to Daus.
Extra credit will be of
fered this Sunday at the Lake
Lagunita Aqua Follies. Stu
dents may wear bathing suits
or any other minimal attire
but must be wary of peeling.
"Any peeling during the
quarter results in an auto
matic fail," said Disse.
