# Tax computation program ignored
## 
### Marianne Villanueva 
With less than two weeks to go
before April 15, the Volunteers
for Income-Tax Assistance, a
group which provides free tax
consultation for low-income and
bilingual people in East Palo
Alto, is reporting a disappoint
ing lack of community response
to their program.
V.I.T.A. is part of a na
tionwide program sponsored by
the IRS to answer to the needs of
those people who would nor
mally experience the most dif
ficulties in understanding the
tax forms. It was begun 10 years
ago. Today there are over 200
V.I.T.A. groups in the Bay Area
alone. The Stanford chapter of
V.I.T.A. has been in operation
for six years now. Most of its 40
members are from the Business
School, but there are also quite a
number of Law School students
among them.
The spokesperson for the
group, Marilynn Goo, says that
lack of publicity may be part of
the problem. The group has no
formal offices. Every Saturday
afternoon, members of V.I.T.A.
sit behind desks in the Com
munity Room on the first floor

of the East Palo Alto Municipal
Council Building, tax forms on
the table, ready to field what
ever questions people may have
about filling up the forms. How
ever, business has been slow. In
the first six weeks since the
group began offering its ser
vices, no more than 10 people
showed up to ask for assistance.
Lila Bardellini-Gaetjens, the
Tax-payer Education Coordi
nator for the IRS for Northern
California, says that "the tax
forms are really simple to fill
out, so the most common prob
lems people might face would
be a lack of familiarity with the
procedure, leading to frustra
tion." She adds: "People say,
we don't know anything about
tax returns, and this may stop
them from filling out the forms.
Most people, therefore, who
don't know enough about the
procedure need guidance, and it
was for this reason that the IRS
was eager to sponsor the tax as
sistance program."
For example, says Bardellini-
Gaetjens, "There are several
tax credits that people are not
aware of which could prove
highly beneficial to low-income

families."
One of these is the earned-in
come credit, which stipulates
that if a person's income is less
than $10,000 and the person has a
child, he or she is entitled to a
payment from the government
even if he or she has paid no tax.
Persons eligible for the earned
income credit may find that
they can receive . advance
payments from their employers
throughout the year.
People who have been resi
dents of California since March
1, 1980 and have been renting
homes may also take advantage
of a renter's credit, which would
provide singles with a $60 refund
and married couples with a $137
refund.
On April 4, a young, black
woman who had worked briefly
as a clerk and received a total of
$220 was assisted by a young
graduate student named Peter
Cannon. Her former employer
had withheld $1.88 out of her
salary, and the small amount
made her seem skeptical about
getting it back. However, Can
non told her: "A dollar is a
dollar. Why let the government
have a free dollar?" Another
V.I.T.A. member came up and
said that with an income of less
than $1000, the woman did not
even have to file an income tax
return. After questioning her
further, Cannon determined
that even though she need not
pay any tax, the woman was en
titled to a $23 refund from the
federal government in earned
income credits and a $137 refund
from the state in renter's cred
its.
The woman seemed happy.
She had just stumbled upon the

V.I.T.A. program when she
brought her children to the li
brary, which is right across
from the Community Room
where V.I.T.A. members oper
ate. She had also heard about
the program from friends. An
other woman who had been as
sisted by V.I.T.A. said that she
first learned about the group be
cause they used to hang around
the old Bank of America branch
in East Palo Alto. This year, the
branch was closed down, but the
woman knew that "they would
have to be somewhere nearby."
Now that she has uncovered
V.I.T.A.'s new location, she
says: "This is really great." In
fact, V.I.T.A. is such a good deal
that some smart penny
pinchers who have businesses to
run come to its members to
avail of the free tax consulta
tion. One Filipino woman who
engaged a V.I.T.A. staffer for
more than an hour had a busi
ness-like stack of receipts with
her and her first question was
how to deal with her stocks in
Hewlett-Packard.
The Stanford chapter of
V.I.T.A. has an unusually well
qualified pool of volunteers. One
young woman who gave her
name only as "Libby" used to
own an H&R Block franchise
and had done nearly 3000 tax re
turns. For some, this may be a
good preparation for an upcom
ing job in taxes, but most see it
as a chance to do some com
munity service. Phil Kemp, one
of the four coordinators of the
V.I.T.A. program this year,
says simply: "I feel good
about it." Peter Cannon says:
"It's a good program. It's a good
thing to come over and help out
in the community."

for six years now. Most of its 40
members are from the Business
School, but there are also quite a
number of Law School students
among them.
The spokesperson for the
group, Marilynn Goo, says that
lack of publicity may be part of
the problem. The group has no
formal offices. Every Saturday
afternoon, members of V.I.T.A.
sit behind desks in the Com
munity Room on the first floor

of the East Palo Alto Municipal
Council Building, tax forms on
the table, ready to field what
ever questions people may have
about filling up the forms. How
ever, business has been slow. In
the first six weeks since the
group began offering its ser
vices, no more than 10 people
showed up to ask for assistance.
Lila Bardellini-Gaetjens, the
Tax-payer Education Coordi
nator for the IRS for Northern
California, says that "the tax
forms are really simple to fill
out, so the most common prob
lems people might face would
be a lack of familiarity with the
procedure, leading to frustra
tion." She adds: "People say,
we don't know anything about
tax returns, and this may stop
them from filling out the forms.
Most people, therefore, who
don't know enough about the
procedure need guidance, and it
was for this reason that the IRS
was eager to sponsor the tax as
sistance program."
For example, says Bardellini-
Gaetjens, "There are several
tax credits that people are not
aware of which could prove
highly beneficial to low-income

families."
One of these is the earned-in
come credit, which stipulates
that if a person's income is less
than $10,000 and the person has a
child, he or she is entitled to a
payment from the government
even if he or she has paid no tax.
Persons eligible for the earned
income credit may find that
they can receive . advance
payments from their employers
throughout the year.
People who have been resi
dents of California since March
1, 1980 and have been renting
homes may also take advantage
of a renter's credit, which would
provide singles with a $60 refund
and married couples with a $137
refund.
On April 4, a young, black
woman who had worked briefly
as a clerk and received a total of
$220 was assisted by a young
graduate student named Peter
Cannon. Her former employer
had withheld $1.88 out of her
salary, and the small amount
made her seem skeptical about
getting it back. However, Can
non told her: "A dollar is a
dollar. Why let the government
have a free dollar?" Another
V.I.T.A. member came up and
said that with an income of less
than $1000, the woman did not
even have to file an income tax
return. After questioning her
further, Cannon determined
that even though she need not
pay any tax, the woman was en
titled to a $23 refund from the
federal government in earned
income credits and a $137 refund
from the state in renter's cred
its.
The woman seemed happy.
She had just stumbled upon the

V.I.T.A. program when she
brought her children to the li
brary, which is right across
from the Community Room
where V.I.T.A. members oper
ate. She had also heard about
the program from friends. An
other woman who had been as
sisted by V.I.T.A. said that she
first learned about the group be
cause they used to hang around
the old Bank of America branch
in East Palo Alto. This year, the
branch was closed down, but the
woman knew that "they would
have to be somewhere nearby."
Now that she has uncovered
V.I.T.A.'s new location, she
says: "This is really great." In
fact, V.I.T.A. is such a good deal
that some smart penny
pinchers who have businesses to
run come to its members to
avail of the free tax consulta
tion. One Filipino woman who
engaged a V.I.T.A. staffer for
more than an hour had a busi
ness-like stack of receipts with
her and her first question was
how to deal with her stocks in
Hewlett-Packard.
The Stanford chapter of
V.I.T.A. has an unusually well
qualified pool of volunteers. One
young woman who gave her
name only as "Libby" used to
own an H&R Block franchise
and had done nearly 3000 tax re
turns. For some, this may be a
good preparation for an upcom
ing job in taxes, but most see it
as a chance to do some com
munity service. Phil Kemp, one
of the four coordinators of the
V.I.T.A. program this year,
says simply: "I feel good
about it." Peter Cannon says:
"It's a good program. It's a good
thing to come over and help out
in the community."

With less than two weeks to go
before April 15, the Volunteers
for Income-Tax Assistance, a
group which provides free tax
consultation for low-income and
bilingual people in East Palo
Alto, is reporting a disappoint
ing lack of community response
to their program.
V.I.T.A. is part of a na
tionwide program sponsored by
the IRS to answer to the needs of
those people who would nor
mally experience the most dif
ficulties in understanding the
tax forms. It was begun 10 years
ago. Today there are over 200
V.I.T.A. groups in the Bay Area
alone. The Stanford chapter of
V.I.T.A. has been in operation
for six years now. Most of its 40
members are from the Business
