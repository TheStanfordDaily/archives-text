# Men, women combine to crunch Bears
## Netters hit right mix in win over Cal 
### Steve Odell 
The crunch said Stanford and the flavor
said ease when the men's and women's ten
nis teams ganged up to demolish Cal in a
unique mixed match Saturday night at
Maples Pavilion. The competition featured
rules similar to the ones of the old World
Team Tennis League, with six different sets
played, no-ad scoring, and the winner de
termined by overall games won. The Cards
won every set but one, and lost that in a
tiebreak, in defeating the guys and gals
from Berkeley, 36 games to 20.
Even though the match pitted such bitter
rivals as the Cards and Bears, the overall
purpose of the match, it seemed, from
players' and fans' and coaches' per
spectives alike — was simply to have a good
time.
"First of all, / really enjoyed it," said
Stanford men's coach Dick Gould. "Second
of all, I think the players enjoyed it, and
thirdly, I hope we can do it again "
Women's coach Frank Brennan felt like
wise after the match. "I thought all of the
girls and all of the guys played well," he
said. "It would have been more exciting had
it been a little bit closer, but you can't worry
about those things. It was a lot of fun."
This is not to say that there were not some
intense sets played. Ask Jim Gurfein, who
played in the men's singles for the Cards,
losing the set on a 4-all point in a nine-point
tiebreaker. Gurfein's was decidedly the
most exciting set of the evening, as he faced
Cal's number one, Mike Bauer, who was
coming off of an upset of Tim Mayotte on

Friday.
The first six games both players held
their respective serves, with both also eking
out 3-3 games on their serve to knot the set
at 3-all. Bauer broke through easily in the
seventh game, however, forcing Gurfein
into several errors and winning 4-0.
The sophomore from Great Neck. N.Y.,
showed why he is the third ranked amateur
in the world, breaking right back, getting
the first three points on Bauer's serve, and
winning the eighth game 4-1. Gurfein con
tinued his hot streak, holding in the ninth
with four straight points.
After two more holds each, the players
found themselves deadlocked at six games
apiece, forcing the tiebreaker. Gurfein
served first and nailed a service winner
right off the bat. but Bauer passed him with
a beautiful shot to make it 1-1. Even though
Gurfein eventually got a 4-2 lead, it was in
evitable. it seemed, that this set would
come down to the final point. Bauer served,
and after a rally. Gurfein finally missed a
backhand lob that went long by about an
inch.
"It's hard to have a strategy- against a guy
like Bauer." explained Gurfein. "because
he hits the ball so hard. You just try to see
the ball well and counterattack."
Despite losing, Gurfein felt it was a
positive experience playing in Maples in
front of partisan fans (about 3500 Saturday
night) for the first time. "It was exciting
playing in front of people I know,"he said.
"It was an emotional experience. We had a
good set. and I was pretty satisfied. I played
reasonably well."

In the other singles. Alycia Moulton de
stroyed Canadian former pro Nina Bland
without losing a game. In fact, she lost only
12 points the entire set.
"That was about as good as I've seen her
play," praised Brennan of his star pupil,
who had lost a disappointing three set match
the day before against Pepperdine's
Aschara Moranon. "I was happy to see her
play well, even though it was only one set."
Moulton used her patented ser ve-and-vol
ley to trounce her opponent, and when she
was forced to 3-3 in the fourth game on her
serve, she powered an ace to settle matters
Probably the most entertaining set of the
evening was in the men's doubles where
Scott Bondurant and Jeff Arons teamed up
to dispose of Cal's Mark Wooldridge and
Randy Nixon, 6-4.
The Card duo split the first eight games
with the Bears, and the key point of the
match came with Arons serving at 3-3 in the
ninth. Arons smashed a great serve, which
was put up like a lame duck by Wooldridge
and then quickly shot down on an overhead
by Bondurant.
Arons and Bondurant complemented
each other well, with Bondurant hitting
great angle volleys throughout the set and
Arons having more overheads than a
projector room. x

purpose of the match, it seemed, from
players' and fans' and coaches' per
spectives alike — was simply to have a good
time.
"First of all, / really enjoyed it," said
Stanford men's coach Dick Gould. "Second
of all, I think the players enjoyed it, and
thirdly, I hope we can do it again "
Women's coach Frank Brennan felt like
wise after the match. "I thought all of the
girls and all of the guys played well," he
said. "It would have been more exciting had
it been a little bit closer, but you can't worry
about those things. It was a lot of fun."
This is not to say that there were not some
intense sets played. Ask Jim Gurfein, who
played in the men's singles for the Cards,
losing the set on a 4-all point in a nine-point
tiebreaker. Gurfein's was decidedly the
most exciting set of the evening, as he faced
Cal's number one, Mike Bauer, who was
coming off of an upset of Tim Mayotte on

Friday.
The first six games both players held
their respective serves, with both also eking
out 3-3 games on their serve to knot the set
at 3-all. Bauer broke through easily in the
seventh game, however, forcing Gurfein
into several errors and winning 4-0.
The sophomore from Great Neck. N.Y.,
showed why he is the third ranked amateur
in the world, breaking right back, getting
the first three points on Bauer's serve, and
winning the eighth game 4-1. Gurfein con
tinued his hot streak, holding in the ninth
with four straight points.
After two more holds each, the players
found themselves deadlocked at six games
apiece, forcing the tiebreaker. Gurfein
served first and nailed a service winner
right off the bat. but Bauer passed him with
a beautiful shot to make it 1-1. Even though
Gurfein eventually got a 4-2 lead, it was in
evitable. it seemed, that this set would
come down to the final point. Bauer served,
and after a rally. Gurfein finally missed a
backhand lob that went long by about an
inch.
"It's hard to have a strategy- against a guy
like Bauer." explained Gurfein. "because
he hits the ball so hard. You just try to see
the ball well and counterattack."
Despite losing, Gurfein felt it was a
positive experience playing in Maples in
front of partisan fans (about 3500 Saturday
night) for the first time. "It was exciting
playing in front of people I know,"he said.
"It was an emotional experience. We had a
good set. and I was pretty satisfied. I played
reasonably well."

In the other singles. Alycia Moulton de
stroyed Canadian former pro Nina Bland
without losing a game. In fact, she lost only
12 points the entire set.
"That was about as good as I've seen her
play," praised Brennan of his star pupil,
who had lost a disappointing three set match
the day before against Pepperdine's
Aschara Moranon. "I was happy to see her
play well, even though it was only one set."
Moulton used her patented ser ve-and-vol
ley to trounce her opponent, and when she
was forced to 3-3 in the fourth game on her
serve, she powered an ace to settle matters
Probably the most entertaining set of the
evening was in the men's doubles where
Scott Bondurant and Jeff Arons teamed up
to dispose of Cal's Mark Wooldridge and
Randy Nixon, 6-4.
The Card duo split the first eight games
with the Bears, and the key point of the
match came with Arons serving at 3-3 in the
ninth. Arons smashed a great serve, which
was put up like a lame duck by Wooldridge
and then quickly shot down on an overhead
by Bondurant.
Arons and Bondurant complemented
each other well, with Bondurant hitting
great angle volleys throughout the set and
Arons having more overheads than a
projector room. x

The crunch said Stanford and the flavor
said ease when the men's and women's ten
nis teams ganged up to demolish Cal in a
unique mixed match Saturday night at
Maples Pavilion. The competition featured
rules similar to the ones of the old World
Team Tennis League, with six different sets
played, no-ad scoring, and the winner de
termined by overall games won. The Cards
won every set but one, and lost that in a
tiebreak, in defeating the guys and gals
from Berkeley, 36 games to 20.
