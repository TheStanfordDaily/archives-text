Berkeley — Call it uninspired, workmanlike or
any other of Roget's favorite words for just get
ting the job done. Stanford's 6-3 win over Cal in
men's tennis Friday at Edwards Courts wasn't
pretty, but in the end, the Cards' depth wore down
the overmatched Bears.
The hosts were dominant at the top of the ladder
in both singles and doubles, but Stanford blitzed
through the remainder of the lineup, winning the
bottom two singles and doubles matches without
dropping a set. According to Cal coach Phil
Wright, that was the match.
"The difference was at five and six," Wright
said of the singles play. "We thought we'd have a
better shot there."
Both matches were won by Cards in little more
than an hour. Scott Bondurant continued his win
ning ways at No. 5 with a 6-4, 6-1 shellacking of
1980 California junior college champion John
Sevely. It was sweet revenge for the methodical
Bondurant, who lost to Sevely at the NorCal In
tercollegiates in February.
However, the big news for Stanford came at No.
6 singles, where freshman Mike Falberg made a
Cakewalk of his college debut with a 6-4, 6-4 win
over Phil Lehnhoff.
Falberg's win did more than lift the Cards onto
the high side of a 3-2 margin; it showed the Santa
Barbara native was showing few ill effects from
his self-imposed winter quarter layoff. Tennis
coach Dick Gould inserted Falberg into the No. 6
slot in order to allow him to slowly get reac
quainted with his game. However, all Falberg
proved Friday is that he is a) the best No 6 player
in the country, and b) he won't be at No. 6 for long
The finesse game of Lehnhoff, on the rebound
from a shoulder injury and a head ailment known
as a severe slump, was no match for the cannon
disguised as a Prince racket at the end of
Falberg's right hand.
"It feels good, especially since it was my first
match and everyone else has played a lot more,"
Falberg said. "I've been working real hard to get
in shape the last couple of weeks. I was eager to
play."
Eager to forget his play was Stanford's top dog,
junior Tim Mayotte, who was less top than dog
against Cal's Mike Bauer. Mayotte's unforced er

rors paved the way to a 7-5. 6-4 loss to Bauer. That
defeat was especially hard to swallow, for May
otte lost seven break points over two games in the
first set, when it was still anybody's match.
In doubles, Mayotte's service game deserted
him after an extraordinary first set, and he and
Jim Gurfein lost 0-6, 7-5. 6-3 to Bauer and Yair
Wertheimer.
• 1 That I only got one break is inexcusable,'' said
Mayotte, ever tough on himself. "I'm not coming
through on the big points. I'm confident I'll come
around, but I just don't know when."
The best match of the day was at No. 2 singles,
where Scott Davis outlasted fellow freshman
Mark Wooldridge 7-6 (5-0), 5-7,6-4 in a battle of the
big-hitters. Davis blew two match points at 5-4 in
the second set, and the momentary setback sent
him reeling. By the time he righted himself the set
was over, and it was Wooldridge's turn to fly in the
ozone.
"After winning the second set, I was just re
lieved to get back in the match," the fullback
sized Wooldridge said. "I was just happy to win
the set instead of going in and trying to win every
game."
Davis struck quickly, winning two breaks and
then holding on for the win that put Stanford ahead
4-2. "It was hard for me to get psyched up," said
Davis, who is coming off a second-place finish in a
Grand Prix pro tournament. "I thought I was
before the match, but I was tired out there and a
little sloppy."
The win was Stanford's eighth in eight starts,
while the Bears dropped to 9-5. However, the dif
ference in the two schools' schedules belies the
discrepancy in the two records. Cal was the first
match in which Stanford really had to worry about
losing, while the Bears have played (and lost to)
Texas, Trinity and SMU.
"They've played more tough matches and it
showed," Gould said. "They were tougher on the
big points. We have got to do better on the big
points."
