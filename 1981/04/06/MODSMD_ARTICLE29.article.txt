# Women net set weather Waves

Stanford women's tennis coach Frank Brennan just might con
sider flying out the parents of all the girls on his team after he
looked at the results against Pepperdine last Friday. Although the
Stanford women's tennis team ran into some mighty tough Waves
last Friday, the Cards, led by freshmen Elise Burgin and Michelle
Weiss, who had their guardians on the sidelines, took the breakers in
stride and prevented a tidal-sized upset. The Cardinal women took
apart the gals from Pepperdine 6-3 last Friday at Stanford Tennis
Stadium, but not as rapidly or as easily as Brennan thought they
would.
"It was a lot closer than I expected it to be," he said. "I was im
pressed with their team. They had good depth all down the line."
Burgin was entrenched in a dogfight at number two singles with
the Waves' Debbie Franz in a match that lasted well over two hours.
Burgin fought her way to a hard earned 6-4 win the first set, but then
fell behind in the second, losing the first three games.
The lefthander from Baltimore gradually clawed her way back
into the set, breaking in the fourth and the tenth games to tie it up at
5-all. After losing her serve in the eleveth, Burgin broke right back
forcing the marathon set into a tiebreaker.
It looked as though from there that she would mop up rather
quickly in the best-of-13 point overtime, jumping out to a 6-3 lead,
only to lose all three match points. She got another chance to take
the match, hitting an overhead winner to forge a 7-6 lead, but lost
another match point, and the next two to drop the second set when
her forehand return sailed a foot long.
"I wasn't thinking anything. I was just numb," said Burgin, re
ferring to how she felt after she lost the middle set. "I knew that I
had to get up right away in the third, and try to just forget about it.
And I think I did."
She convinced Franz of the fact, anyway, sweeping to an ag
gressive 6-2 win in the finale. Burgin viewed the match as a learning
experience. "I'm capable of playing much better, but I think this
win was a stepping stone. I conquered a mental battle today."
Also doing her share of conquering for the Cards was Weiss, who
picked up wins at number six singles and number two doubles.
Performing solo, Weiss crunched her Malibu opponent, Marianne
Layland, zero and three. "I'm hitting real well right now," she ex
plained, "just basically playing a baseline game."
The Pepperdine match was only the third time all year that the
Cards have failed to decide the outcome in their favor after the com
pletion of the singles. But Weiss and teammate Donna Rubin quick
ly decided the verdict and spoiled any hopes of a Wave upset, win
ning handily over the doubles team of Valerie Cates and Ellip Com
pton, 6-1, 6-2.
Enough to make any parent proud.
