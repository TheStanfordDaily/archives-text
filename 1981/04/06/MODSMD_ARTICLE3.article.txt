# Researchers lose Boys' Town funds
## 
### David Frank 
The Stanford Boys' Town Center
may lose its primary source of funding
because it is not meeting the legal or
practical requirements of of the
Father Flanagan's Boys' Home of Ne
braska, officials there said.
The loss of the funding would have a
"disastrous" affect on the progress of
on-going research aimed at answering
questions about youth development,
according to Stanford Boys' Town
Center Director Dr. J. Merrill
Carlsmith.
Officials at Flanagan's Boys' Home
— known as Boys' Town — claim that
a 25-year contract the Home signed
with Stanford in 1974 exceeds the
scope of Boys' Town's articles of in
corporation.
Payments from Boys' Town stopped
March 1. On March 17, Stanford filed
suit in Santa Clara County Superior
Court, claiming that the University's
contract was valid and that payments
should be resumed.
Also filing with Stanford was Catho
lic University of America, located in
Washington D C., which has a similar
contract with Boys' Town.
Boys' Town must answer the uni
versities' joint complaint by April 20.
Quoting from the 1974 contract be
tween the University and Boys' Town.
Rodney Johnson of the University
Counsel's office said Stanford is ob
ligated to "perform basic research on
the effects of deprivation and neglect
on the life chances of children.
The Boys' Town articles of in
corporation say it should be organized
and operated exclusively "for chari
table educational and religious
purposes, including such purposes as
the owning, maintaining and operat
ing a home or homes and a school or
schools for homeless, abandoned, in
digent, underprivileged, wayward or
retarded boys, and supporting and
educating such boys and equipping
them to lead useful lives. .

"This language seems to fit logical
ly with the articles of incorporation."
Johnson said.
Boys' Town spokesman Tom
Schuyler refused to comment on the
legal question, saying he preferred
that the matter be settled in court.
However. Schuyler noted another of
Boys' Town's complaints: the re
search performed by the Stanford
Boys' Town Center is "not relevant"
to Boys' Town's needs.
Schuyler cited an example of what
he called "irrelevant" research in a
Stanford Boys' Town Center study of
the transition from childhood to
adolescence among a eastern New
Guinea tribe.
Carlsmith acknowledged that Dr.
Gilbert Herdt, a Stanford an
thropologist, had undertaken the
study. However, only S6OO of Boys'
Town grant money had been used for
the study, Carlsmith said.
"That was the first time Boys'
Town had ever objected to our re
search," Carlsmith said.
Some 30 projects would be hurt by a
loss of funding, Carlsmith said.
Among them is a recently completed
study of the impact of day-care cen
ters on the social development of
young children, he added. Another
project that may suffer is investigat
ing the impact of foster care on abused
and neglected children, Carlsmith
said.
Some 60 Boys' Town Center workers
will be affected by the loss of funds, in
cluding 25 faculty members, 10 re
search staff members, and 20 gradu
ate students, he said.
The $640,000 that Stanford currently
receives each year from Boys' Town
covers the bulk of the campus Boys'
Town Center operating and research
expenses, Carlsmith said.
Some research studies receive addi
tional money from Stanford and from
state and federal sources, but those
sources can't be expected to supplant
the $640,000, Carlsmith added.

search," Carlsmith said.
Some 30 projects would be hurt by a
loss of funding, Carlsmith said.
Among them is a recently completed
study of the impact of day-care cen
ters on the social development of
young children, he added. Another
project that may suffer is investigat
ing the impact of foster care on abused
and neglected children, Carlsmith
said.
Some 60 Boys' Town Center workers
will be affected by the loss of funds, in
cluding 25 faculty members, 10 re
search staff members, and 20 gradu
ate students, he said.
The $640,000 that Stanford currently
receives each year from Boys' Town
covers the bulk of the campus Boys'
Town Center operating and research
expenses, Carlsmith said.
Some research studies receive addi
tional money from Stanford and from
state and federal sources, but those
sources can't be expected to supplant
the $640,000, Carlsmith added.
