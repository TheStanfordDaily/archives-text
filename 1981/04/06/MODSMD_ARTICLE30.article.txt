# Cardinal diamonders stung in 'Big Series'
## 
### Ralph Walker 
Nobody likes walks.
Coaches hate them because
they are free gifts to the op
posing team. Fans hate them
because they tend to slow the
pace and lengthen the game.
Walks played a large role
in the "Big Series" this
weekend, won by Cal (11-10,
12-11, 7-12). Combined with
78 hits, the 46 bases on balls
(19 of them turned into runs)
made for a high scoring, ex
citing, but lengthy (the
shortest game was three
hours and 33 minutes) series.
Trailing 7-4 after seven in
nings, Cal exploded for a
game-winning seven-run ral
ly in the eighth. The
catalysts were two walks, a
hit batter, a home run, and an
untimely error. After having
thrown a solid five-and-one
third inning relief stint, Stan
ford freshman Steve Cottrell
gave up a home run to desig
nated hitter Ken Freer.
A walk and an RBI later
Cottrell was pulled in favor
of another freshman, John
Radtke. He promptly hit and
walked the first two batters
he faced, before shortstop
Dave Meier let what should
have been an inning-ending
double-play ball roll through
his legs. The error allowed
two runs to score annd tied
the game. Cal then added
three more hits to score an
other two runs, taking a 9-7
lead.
"You can't really say that
Meiers' error cost us the
game," coach Mark Mar
quess said. "At that particu
lar point it did, but we could
have broken the game wide
open in the first four or five
innings."
Stanford indeed blew sev
eral opportunities. Although
they scored seven runs in the
first six innings, they also
left eight runners on base.

In the second game Cal en
joyed what Marquess called
a "Christmas present." Sev
en of the twelve runners that
scored for the Bears had
been given free passes.
The Bears scored six runs
in the first inning off of
starter Paul Grame, but
were held scoreless from
that point on until the sev
enth through the sparkling
relief effort of Lee Cline.
Meanwhile Stanford was
pecking away at the lead,
and after seven innings the
score was 7-5 Cal.
Unfortunately, Hauley
was in the game by then. Al
though he wasn't as sharp as
usual, it appeared that the
Cardinals were a lost cause,
especially after he retired
the first two batters in the
eighth inning.
But the Cardinals have a

reputation to live up to, so,
seconds after pushing the
comeback button, they had
runners on first and third.
Second baseman Bob De
costa then slapped a two-run
double to tie the score.
Catcher Bill Worden prompt
ly drove DeCosta in with a
single, and presto, Stanford
leads 8-7.
Cal, however, came back
in their half of the eighth
with two runs and regained
the lead.
To get three runs in an in
ning off of Hauley is a rarity.
To do it twice is almost un
heard of. He retired Mike
Dotterer to lead off the ninth,
gave up a single and a walk,
and forced pinch-hitter Lor
ing Davies to fly deep to right
center for the second out. As
the fans were picking up
their gear ready to leave,

Meier tied the game with a
run-scoring single and
Hauley was given the hook by
Milano.
Pinch-hitter Steve
Buchelle stepped up to the
plate for the first time since
he separated his shoulder,
and smashed Bill Hawkins'
ball to the centerfield fence
for a two-run double.
A two-run lead, however,
is hardly safe, especially
when home plate has shrunk.
Coming into the bottom half
of the ninth inning, Stanford
hurlers had walked eight bat
ters, and the worst was yet to
come.
After Bob Boatman
opened the inning by walking
the first two batters he
faced, Marquess brought in
Cottrell. Whether he was
simply tired, overly con

scious of the inhospitable
crowd, or just not mentally
prepared nobody knows, but
he rendered four bases on
balls, walking in two men, in
cluding the winning run.
Cal had won by scoring
three runs on no hits in the
final frame.
A lapse in control can be
rationalized, but when you
get right down to it there is
no real explanation. "It's
just one of those things,"
said Cardinal pitching coach
Tom Dunton. "We stress
control from the first day of
fall practice."
"I felt that Cottrell would
throw the ball over the
plate," said Marquess, when
asked why he didn't go with
another pitcher. "Ideally,
you want someone like Rollie
Fingers to bring in, but at the
collegiate level you're not
always blessed with that lux
ury. What you have in the
bullpen dictates how you
coach." he concluded.
"It's got to be tough, it's
got to be frustrating," said
Milano after the game.
"They did a hell of a job com
ing back, but sometimes it's
who has the last bat that
wins."
Up to the third game of the
series Stanford had lost five
straight league games, and
Cal had won five.
"You've got to take one
game at a time," said Mike
Dotterer before the third
game. "What happened
before is history. Hopefully
we can learn from our mis
takes, and get better. I fell
confident going into this
game."
Stanford reflected Dot
terers sentiments by jump
ing into a six-run lead in the
first inning, on two three run
homers by Mike Toothman
and John Elway, respective
ly. They added one more run
in the second inning, two
more in the fourth, and never
looked back.
Mike Sullivan picked up
his first win of the season in
relief of Gregg Lomnicky.

game of the "Big Series" at Sunken Diamond. The Bears ended up doubling up the Cards, though, over
the weekend, winning two of three games.
Nobody likes walks.
Coaches hate them because
they are free gifts to the op
posing team. Fans hate them
because they tend to slow the
pace and lengthen the game.
Walks played a large role
in the "Big Series" this
weekend, won by Cal (11-10,
12-11, 7-12). Combined with
78 hits, the 46 bases on balls
(19 of them turned into runs)
made for a high scoring, ex
citing, but lengthy (the
shortest game was three
hours and 33 minutes) series.
Trailing 7-4 after seven in
nings, Cal exploded for a
game-winning seven-run ral
ly in the eighth. The
catalysts were two walks, a
hit batter, a home run, and an
untimely error. After having
thrown a solid five-and-one
third inning relief stint, Stan
ford freshman Steve Cottrell
gave up a home run to desig
nated hitter Ken Freer.
A walk and an RBI later
Cottrell was pulled in favor
of another freshman, John
Radtke. He promptly hit and
walked the first two batters
he faced, before shortstop
Dave Meier let what should
have been an inning-ending
double-play ball roll through
his legs. The error allowed
two runs to score annd tied
the game. Cal then added
three more hits to score an
other two runs, taking a 9-7
lead.
"You can't really say that
Meiers' error cost us the
game," coach Mark Mar
quess said. "At that particu
lar point it did, but we could
have broken the game wide
open in the first four or five
innings."
Stanford indeed blew sev
eral opportunities. Although
they scored seven runs in the
first six innings, they also
left eight runners on base.

In the second game Cal en
joyed what Marquess called
a "Christmas present." Sev
en of the twelve runners that
scored for the Bears had
been given free passes.
The Bears scored six runs
in the first inning off of
starter Paul Grame, but
were held scoreless from
that point on until the sev
enth through the sparkling
relief effort of Lee Cline.
Meanwhile Stanford was
pecking away at the lead,
and after seven innings the
score was 7-5 Cal.
Unfortunately, Hauley
was in the game by then. Al
though he wasn't as sharp as
usual, it appeared that the
Cardinals were a lost cause,
especially after he retired
the first two batters in the
eighth inning.
But the Cardinals have a

reputation to live up to, so,
seconds after pushing the
comeback button, they had
runners on first and third.
Second baseman Bob De
costa then slapped a two-run
double to tie the score.
Catcher Bill Worden prompt
ly drove DeCosta in with a
single, and presto, Stanford
leads 8-7.
Cal, however, came back
in their half of the eighth
with two runs and regained
the lead.
To get three runs in an in
ning off of Hauley is a rarity.
To do it twice is almost un
heard of. He retired Mike
Dotterer to lead off the ninth,
gave up a single and a walk,
and forced pinch-hitter Lor
ing Davies to fly deep to right
center for the second out. As
the fans were picking up
their gear ready to leave,

Meier tied the game with a
run-scoring single and
Hauley was given the hook by
Milano.
Pinch-hitter Steve
Buchelle stepped up to the
plate for the first time since
he separated his shoulder,
and smashed Bill Hawkins'
ball to the centerfield fence
for a two-run double.
A two-run lead, however,
is hardly safe, especially
when home plate has shrunk.
Coming into the bottom half
of the ninth inning, Stanford
hurlers had walked eight bat
ters, and the worst was yet to
come.
After Bob Boatman
opened the inning by walking
the first two batters he
faced, Marquess brought in
Cottrell. Whether he was
simply tired, overly con

scious of the inhospitable
crowd, or just not mentally
prepared nobody knows, but
he rendered four bases on
balls, walking in two men, in
cluding the winning run.
Cal had won by scoring
three runs on no hits in the
final frame.
A lapse in control can be
rationalized, but when you
get right down to it there is
no real explanation. "It's
just one of those things,"
said Cardinal pitching coach
Tom Dunton. "We stress
control from the first day of
fall practice."
"I felt that Cottrell would
throw the ball over the
plate," said Marquess, when
asked why he didn't go with
another pitcher. "Ideally,
you want someone like Rollie
Fingers to bring in, but at the
collegiate level you're not
always blessed with that lux
ury. What you have in the
bullpen dictates how you
coach." he concluded.
"It's got to be tough, it's
got to be frustrating," said
Milano after the game.
"They did a hell of a job com
ing back, but sometimes it's
who has the last bat that
wins."
Up to the third game of the
series Stanford had lost five
straight league games, and
Cal had won five.
"You've got to take one
game at a time," said Mike
Dotterer before the third
game. "What happened
before is history. Hopefully
we can learn from our mis
takes, and get better. I fell
confident going into this
game."
Stanford reflected Dot
terers sentiments by jump
ing into a six-run lead in the
first inning, on two three run
homers by Mike Toothman
and John Elway, respective
ly. They added one more run
in the second inning, two
more in the fourth, and never
looked back.
Mike Sullivan picked up
his first win of the season in
relief of Gregg Lomnicky.
