# Card golfers just par at Houston

The Stanford men's golf team turned in
yet another solid performance this week
end, solid for Stanford that is, at the Hous
ton Ail-American Intercollegiate.
The tournament, the oldest and most
prestigious in collegiate golf, consisted of 72
holes and 29 golfing powerhouses. Stanford
filled out the field at 30 teams. Though the
Cardinals failed to make the 36-hole cut,
coach David Yates maintained that he was
"not really disappointed."
Juniors Jack Skilling (153) and Tad Bu
chanan (153), and freshmen Lew Dickey
(148), Doug Thompson (155), and Tim Rob
inson (154) represented Stanford in the tour
nament. Robinson was low scorer after the
first round with a 73, but shot an 81 in the
second.
The Cardinals were tied for 12th place

with the universities of Texas and Florida
after 18 holes with a total of 301. They had a
36-hole total of 608, which Yates maintained
"wasn't that bad, because we were only 14
strokes out of 6th place." However, the
score placed them 20th in the field, which
was unfortunate in view of the fact that only
the top 18 teams made the cut.
"I'm really not disappointed," Yates re
peated. "The competition at the tour
nament is always tough. A lot of teams that
made the cut played over their heads."
Yates asserted that the use of aggregate
as opposed to daily scoring may have hurt
the Cardinals chances of making the cut.
The daily scoring system allows a team to
ignore its highest score in favor of the four
lowest. Tim Robinson's second round score
of 81 had to be taken into account under the
aggregate scoring system.

Robinson seems to be emerging as the
Cardinals' Great Low Hope. Yates at
tributed Robinson's erratic play this week
end to back trouble. The freshman ap
parently did not pick up a club from Febru
ary 20th to March 20th as a result of his in
jury.
Yates decided tp enter him in his first
tournament since then only two weeks ago.
He took Robinson along to the Morris Wil
liams Intercollegiate at the University of
Texas "on a hunch. He seemed to be swing
ing the club well." Robinson promptly shot
a three under par 213 in the 54 hole tour
nament.
The score was good enough to place him in
a three way tie for the lead. He then birdied
two of the three playoff holes and won the
tournament.
