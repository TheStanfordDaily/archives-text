# Tracksters tripped up at Cal

The Stanford men's track
team lost to USC, 91-62, in the
traditional north-south double
dual meet held at Berkeley's
Edwards Stadium on Saturday.
The other half of the meet fea
tured a battle of two of the na
tion's top dual meet track and
field teams, in which UCLA
came out on top of the Cal
Bears, 87-67.
Despite outscoring the Tro
jans 32-4 in the distances and

-17-10 in the weight events, the
Cards weren't able to handle the
sprint-dominated USC squad.
The speedy Southern Cal sprin
ters won every event shorter
than 800 meters, including the
hurdles and relays.
The Stanford team effort was
sparked by double victories for
both John Schaer (800 meters,
1500 meters), and Bill Graham
(steeplechase, 5000 meters).
Middle-distanceman Schaer
showed similar tactics in both of
his wins, displaying a powerful

kick in passing as many as four
runners in the final 200 meters
of both races. Weightman Dave
Thomson scored a personal best
of 182 feet, five inches, in win
ning the discus.
The women's squad, mean
while, was one of 15 teams
which invaded the same
Berkeley stadium yesterday for
the fourth running of the Cal
women's Invitational. The
Cardinal team wound up with a
strong fourth place finish be

hind Cal, Cal-Poly, and Cal
State-Northridge, three of the
four most powerful squads in
the state.
Leading the Cards with first
place finishes were Kim
Schnurpfeil in the 5000 meters,
freshman Lynnae Warren in the
long jump, and frosh discus
thrower Carol Cady. Warren
topped off an outstanding day
with a third place in the 100
meters and a strong anchor leg
on the fifth-place 1600-meter re
lay team.
