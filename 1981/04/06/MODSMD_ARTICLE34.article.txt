The intercollegiate bicycle
racing season opened March 28
with a race at the University of
Santa Clara, followed by a race
at Foothill College the next day.
First place went to UC-Santa
Barbara both days, while Stan
ford took second place Saturday
and was a close third to Foothill
on Sunday. Twelve schools sent
teams of various sizes to the
events.
The Santa Clara criterium
was a flat, short couse which in
cluded seven right-angle turns
and part of a circle in a one-kilo
meter circuit. The novice men's
pack of 50 riders started the day
in a fast race which immediate
ly strung out all over the course.
Don Hirsh and Brad Melmon
provided the scoring for Stan
ford, placing sixth and twelfth
respectively.
The two Stanford women
turned their race into a joke by
motoring away from the entire
field immediately, and even
tually lapped everyone at least
once. Liz Newberry finished
first, followed by Marsi Bethke.
The Expert men's race was

loaded with some of the top
amateur racers in the state. Lee
Flemins of UC-Davis, national
champion as a junior, domi
nated the race from the start.
Paul Middelstadt of Stanford
placed an impressive sixth in
the final sprint.
Sunday's races around the
Foothill College campus were a
different story. The hilly
course, combined with windy
conditions, provided a test of the
riders' strength and stamina.
Despite the fact that they were
facing much stronger competi
tion than the day before, the
Stanford women were still im
pressive, with Newberry win
ning again and Bethke placing
third.
A brief downpour during the
20-mile Novice race caused

crashes on four
laps, unnerving many rider§.
The five Stanford riders gutted
it out and came through un
scathed, with Hirsh taking
fourth and Medlmon eleventh to
cap off their first weekend qf
racing. g

Although the road was dry for
the 35-mile expert race, the first
15 miles were conservatively
ridden. Then the crowd was ig
nited by a three-man breakaway
including Bruce Hildebrandt <Jf
Foothill and Shin Umeda of Sai
Jose State. Working together ef
ficiently, the three maintained*
30-second lead on the pack fof
miles. The hill and the wind prei
vailed, though, and the pad*
reeled in the three exhausted
riders with nine miles remains
ing, but not before they had cob
lected points for their schools.
