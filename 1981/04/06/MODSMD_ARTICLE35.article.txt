Brezhnev meets Eastern bloc
Prague, Czechoslovakia — Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev flew into Prague yesterday on the eve of a Com
munist Party meeting where Poland's labor turmoil was
expected to be the key topic. He immediately conferred
with Czechoslovak leaders on "international problems."
In Berlin, the East German news agency ADN reported
that fresh military units, including tank, rocket, artillery,
and communications troops, were joining the 2-week-old
Soyuz-81 maneuvers in and around Poland.
"In the concentration and jump-off points, army mem
bers were informed politically and militarily of the up
coming combat mission," ADN said of the war games.
There had been speculation that Brezhnev's presence
was a tipoff to a Warsaw Pact summit on Poland, but a top
Czechoslovak party official, Mikulas Beno, said yesterday
at a news conference the Soviet leader would be the only
foreign party chief at the 16th Czechoslovak Communist
Party Congress, which begins today.
Beno said Poland would be represented by Stefan
Olsowski, a Politburo member considered a hard-liner on
policy toward the independent union Solidarity. Beno said
Poland and three of its neighbors — the Soviet Union. East
Germany and Hungary — would be the only foreign delega
tions to speak before the full congress.
Sources elsewhere in the East bloc refused to rule out
the possibility of a summit in Prague this week to decide
whether to try to crush Poland's independent union move
ment.
U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Satur
day in London that "much more'" material was being air
lifted by Warsaw Pact forces around Poland than the ma
neuvers alone would require.
"There is a lot of activity going on that is not consistent
with a maneuver," Weinberger said. "There is activity
consistent with a move to go into Poland and with an ex
pansion of the exercise."
Haig tours Middle East
Jerusalem — Secretary of State Alexander Haig, seek
ing to calm Israeli fears over the sale of American mili
tary equipment to Saudi Arabia, declared yesterday that
Israel's security and well-being are "central to American
policy in the Middle East."
Haig arrived here on the second stop of his tour of four
key Middle East nations. Earlier, he conferred in Cairo
with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
Haig and American officials traveling with him were in
close touch with Washington during the day on events in
Poland, where continuing labor unrest has raised fears of
possible Soviet intervention.
Haig told reporters the situation in Poland "remains
more tense than it has been. We've been watching Soviet
military steps with growing concern."
Haig noted Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev's trip to
Prague, Czechoslovakia, for that country's Communist
Party meeting and said it "may be an important occasion
with respect to Soviet actions affecting the Polish situ
ation."
The secretary of state said he was here to discuss "the
differences of the parties to the peace process and the cur
rent dangers facing this region."
Israeli officials said they planned to make clear to Haig
their opposition to an as yet unannounced Reagan adminis
tration decision to sell the Saudis sophisticated attack and
reconnaissance aircraft that they believe might be used
against them someday.
Haig plans to discuss with the Israelis proposals for a
multinational peacekeeping force in the Sinai Peninsula.
The force would serve as a buffer between Israeli and
Egyptian forces following Israel's withdrawal from Sinai
next year.

American officials have said they are willing to include
U.S. troops in the force. Israel favors American partici
pation but Sadat told Haig he would prefer a United Na
tions force without Americans.
Egyptian officials have said they would allow the United
States to store military equipment and train forces in
Egypt, but would not do so under a formal agreement.
Shuttle countdown begins
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — The five-day countdown to
launch America's first space shuttle began yesterday
shortly before midnight while space agency technicians
worked to eliminate a short circuit deep inside the ship's
engine.
Officials said the electrical problem would be fixed to
day — time to spare for launch of the Columbia on Friday
from Kennedy Space Center.
Rather than delay the "call to stations" that com
mences countdown, officials decided to bypass the elec
trical short that opened an engine valve without com
mand. Replacing the errant wiring might have taken up to
32 hours.
The problem was in a "pogo suppression valve" in the
main engines of the orbiter that is to carry astronauts John
Young and Robert Crippen into space. The valves reduce
the shaking effect on the spacecraft when super-cool ox
ygen flows at high speed through the fuel lines.
Concern that the vibrations would prevent the crew
from reading their control dials during liftoff, NASA de
veloped valves to slow the fuel flow.
Young and Crippen take part in the countdown only in
the last two hours before flight. They spent the weekend in
Houston, in trainers simulating critical portions of their
journey, intending to fly to the Cape in T-38 trainers tomor
row.
Skiers injured in Tahoe accident
South Lake Tahoe, Calif. — At least 12 persons were in
jured when the cable of a double chairlift slipped off its
pulley yesterday at Heavenly Valley Ski Resort, plunging
some of the riders 10 to 40 feet.
Three persons were listed in serious condition with head
and other injuries while most suffered cuts, bruises and
bumps, hospital spokespersons said.
The cable slipped from the pulley when two teenage
boys began swinging the chairs, according to resort gener
al manager. He said the cable dropped about 10 feet when
it slipped, bouncing some riders out of their seats and
smashing others against the lift's metal chairs.
It was not known how many persons were on the lift at
the time, officials said.
The accident happened on the "Ridge" lift near the peak
of the 10,000-foot Monument Peak, the second highest in
the Tahoe Basin. It involved riders who were between the
second and third support towers, a short distance from a
loading platform.
Wells Fargo arrest by FBI
Los Angeles — Boxing promoter Harold Smith, in seclu
sion since an alleged $21.3 million embezzlement at Wells
Fargo Bank was uncovered in January, was arrested Sat
urday by a score of FBI agents with drawn guns who de
scended on a motor home where Smith had met with bank
lawyers.
Smith, 37, was taken into custody for investigation of
making a false statement on an application for a passport,
said Edgar Best, agent in charge of the FBI bureau here.
Albert Sheppard, one of Smith's lawyers, said the arrest
followed Smith's giving a deposition to the bank's at
torneys in the motor home belonging to Hilton Nicholson, a
close friend of Smith, chairman of Muhammad Ali Pro
fessional Sports (MAPS) Inc.

Smith is among defendants in a $46.3 million civil suit
filed by the bank after the bank's losses were discovered in
January.
The bank's money allegedly was funneied into 13 MAPS
accounts by a bank employee. L. Benjamin Lewis, who
also was a MAPS official.
'Zodiac' may be tied to recent killings
San Francisco — Investigators say the man who has
killed at least five hikers bears a striking resemblance to
descriptions of the Zodiac killer, who terrorized the Bay
area a decade ago.
A man known as the "trailside killer" and described by
authorities as a psychopath is blamed for the killings of
five, and possibly seven, hikers in Marin County and the
death of one more in Santa Cruz County since August 1979.
In the late 19605, a man calling himself the Zodiac killed
six people in random shooting attacks, police say. In let
ters to a San Francisco newspaper signed with a cross in
side a circle, he claimed that he had killed 37 people.
No letters have been received in the most recent kill
ings, and the pattern appears different.
But the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Department said
Saturday that composite drawings of the two show striking
similarities. He said detectives from both counties are
"definitely looking into" the possible connection.
The Marin department cautioned that the team "is not
saying he is the Zodiac."
Simpson said the facial features, glasses, height and
ages of the two killers appear to match. A 1969 description
of the Zodiac described a crew-cut, slightly obese, 5-foot-8
killer aged 35 to 45. The most recent killer is described as
45 to 50 years old with thinning gray hair, hazel eyes,
glasses and 5-foot-9.

Since August 1979, seven hikers have been found dead on
popular hiking trails on Mount Tamalpais and at Point
Reyes National Seashore, the most recent bodies dis
covered last November. Marin detectives say the killer
may have been sexually motivated, and say at least five of
the deaths are the work of one man.
None of the Zodiac victims was raped.
Assassination vision disputed
Las Vegas, Nev. — The host of the television talk show
on which psychic Tamara Rand claims she predicted last
week's attempt on President Reagan's life admitted yes
terday that he had''perpetrated a hoax on the public" in an
attempt to help Rand's career.
However, a spokesman for Rand indicated yesterday in
Los Angeles that the psychic planned to take legal action in
connection with challenges to her claim that she had fore
told last week's shooting of Reagan in Washington, D.C.
Rand appeared to have lost an important ally in her bid
to have her prediction recognized as legitimate when a
copyright article by television talk show host Dick
Maurice appeared yesterday in the Las Vegas Sun, for
which Maurice also writes a column.
"My interview with Tamara Rand in which she pre
dicted the assassination attempt on President Ronald
Reagan is a lie," Maurice wrote in the article.
Today's weather

coastal fog or low clouds. Near normal temperatures with
highs in the mid-50s to low 60s along the coast and mid-60s
to mid-70s inland valleys. Lows in the 40s at lower eleva
