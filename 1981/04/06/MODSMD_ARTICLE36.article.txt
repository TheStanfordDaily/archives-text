# Broken light system runs all day

### Debbie Walker 
For the past six months, street
lights ringing the area bordered by
Herrin Hall and the Roble tennis
courts have been shining 24 hours a
day because of a broken automatic
transformer, according to the Univer
sity's Manager of Electrical Distribu
tion, Robert McKnight.
Locating a replacement trans
former has been difficult because only
one company manufactures the de
vice, McKnight said, but he has now
ordered a new transformer, which
should arrive by the end of May.
In the meantime, though, the Uni
versity has been faced with the option
of leaving the area continually il
luminated or continually unlighted.

Facilities and Services has been re
ceiving calls from members of the
campus community who are con
cerned about the unnecessary lights
left on during the day along Via
Crespi, Via Pueblo, Via Ortega and
parts of Panama and Serra Streets.
"Security at night is more impor
tant than the expenditure of energy for
unnecessary light during the day
time," McKnight said, and "there is
no reasonable way of manually turn
ing the lights on and off every day."
McKnight said that the repair
project has also been delayed because
the University has been considering
phasing out the existing series street
light circuits and introducing a new
street light system.
The new transformer will cost more

than $5000, and installation will cost an
additional $2000 to $3000. The broken
transformer will be repaired and re
tained as a spare.
In the existing system the lights are
all controlled by the automatic trans
former. Energy is constantly supplied
to the system, and the automatic
transformer metes out electricity at
the appropriate times.
Because the transformer controls
have been disabled, the only means of
turning off the lights is to manually
cut off the entire electricity supply,
which McKnight said would be dif
ficult and dangerous to do on a daily
basis.
McKnight said that the normal
lighting schedule will be resumed
once the new transformer is installed.
