# ASSU begins annual committee member search
## 
### Karen Springen 
The annual ASSU selection process
is underway for membership in the
University Committee System. This
system consists of about 50 commit
tees which are involved in virtually all
basic policy-making at the University.
According to junior Blake Jor
gensen, committee staff assistant,
"Everything that goes on in the Uni
versity is discussed in these commit
tees."
The system generates ideas for new
policies and programs, reviews and
revises existing policies, and serves as
an adviser to departments and admin
istrators.
It consists of the academic council,
extradepartmental committees, leg
islative-judicial bodies for student
conduct, and trustee committees.
These broad organizations include the

Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies, the Honor Code Commission,
SCIRE, SWOPSI, and the Guest Pro
fessorship Board.
Past suggestions by subcommittees
of the Committee of Undergraduate
Studies led to both the Western Cul
ture requirement and the Human
Biology program. Presently, commit
tees are reviewing the honor code and
the grading system.
Each committee usually consists of
two or three students, four or five fac
ulty representatives, and several
members of the administration.
According to Jorgensen, about 300
to 400 students apply for about 100
available one- and two-year positions.
Both graduates and undergraduates
serve on committees. But Jorgensen
said graduate interest has been low in
the past.
Applications are available in the

ASSU office and are due April 17. Stu
dents must submit separate applica
tions to each committee they are in
terested in.
The nominations committee in
terviews about half of the applicants.
The decision to interview a candidate
is based solely on the application.
The application itself consists of
four essay questions. These ask stu
dents to provide their specific reasons
for interest, their relevant past ex
periences, the issues they consider im
portant in the upcoming year, and the
role student input should play in com
mittee processes.
"Students should be involved in the
University," said Jorgensen. "Since
they're paying for the University, they
should be part of the decision-making
board."
Jorgensen emphasized that stu

dents are considered full committee
members. They receive a full vote in
all issues.
Committees meet six to eight times
a year.
Jorgensen said this year's major
emphasis is on communication. "We
want to try to get more flow of com
munication between the committees
and the student body," he said.
The five committee staff assistants
plan to personally contact all the stu
dent committee members to channel
information and interest in the sys
tem,
The obligations of a student com
mittee member include reading back
ground materials, attending both reg
ular meetings and once-a-quarter
meetings of all committees, and sub
mitting quarterly reports to the com
mittee staff assistants.
