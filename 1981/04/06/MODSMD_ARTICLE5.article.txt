# Follies Frost a summery spring afternoon
## 
### Eric Cornell 
Murphy's Lawyers strolled on
stage yesterday afternoon to open
the second half of the day-long
Aqua Follies.
The lead singer grabbed the mi
crophone and yelled, "Let's cele
brate the beginning of another

quarter at the Stanford Country
Club." The crowd shouted its ap
proval, with the exception of a few
who resented what they perceived
as a slur on the intellectual
asceticism of Stanford.
The Aqua Follies, sponsored by
the Inter-Fraternity Council,
started at noon on the shores of

Lake Lagunita with music from the
Stanford Marching Band. After a
variety of watery events, featuring
acrobatic waterskiing and wind
surfing, the focus shifted to Frost
Amphitheater where Murphy's
Lawyers and The Greg Kihn Band
played while free beer flowed.
Early in the festivities this re
porter was spotted on the bank of
Lake Lagunita asking passers-by
the obvious question, "Can you tell
me what you found most exciting
about the Aqua Follies today?"
Responses:
• "The best part was watching
my friends from El Quadro win
their tug-of-war match."
• "I thought there should have
been more water-skiers. They
were great."
• "The power boats are going to
be yucching up the water."
• "I thought it was pretty excit
ing watching people trip on the
steep slope by the boathouse
beach."
• "The weather was lousy. The
company was awful, too."
In other Aqua Follies events:
• The Theta Delts used their in
famous "jerk"' technique to attain
a climatic victory in the tug-of-war
competition. Their performance
won them a set of stereo head
phones.
• Lack-luster sailing conditions
were improved when a United
States Coast Guard helicopter set
tled like a proud mother duck in the
middle of the lake while duckling
wind-surfers scooted about in the
maternal downdraft.
• The two-man canoe race was
marred by disqualifications. In one

instance the bowman for a hope
lessly outpaced canoe dove into the
water and swamped the opposing
canoe as it passed on the return leg.
Senior Phil Koman and junior Ken
Radtky stroked ash for the vic
torious Theta Delts.
• Bruce Richardson wowed the
croud with a barefoot waterski per
formance. Richardson mirac
ulously walked on the water, rolled
on the water, danced on the water,
while being towed behind a speed
boat.
• Ross Gordon drifted high over
the lake, attached to a parachute
and towed from a boat by a long
cable. He made several circuits of
the lake, often drifting low enough
to dabble his feet in the water
before swooping up again as the
boat accelerated.
When the aqua part of the Follies
were over, the crowd drifted to
Frost Amphitheatre, attracted by
the promise of hard-rocking beer
provided by the IFC and sudsy
noise from the popular Greg Kihn
band.
Waiting for the concert to start,
the deeply-tanned, highly
mellowed out students sipped im
ported beer and and were over
heard discussing Kant in a desulto
ry fashion. Other students engaged
in that old standby activity for a
sunny day — they played frisbee.
The frisbee jocks continued their
cross-amphitheatre tosses well
into the concert, but they were not
nearly as distracting as the
philosophizers and the poets,
whose drone threatened to drown
out the music until Kihn instructed
his mixer to "crank it."
