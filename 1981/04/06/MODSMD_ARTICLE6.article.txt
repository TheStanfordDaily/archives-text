## Oil is the matchmaker in budding romance between Japan and PLO 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo — The formula for
dealing with Japan is not com
plicated. explains Fathi Hamid,
the Tokyo representative of the
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion.
"We say that if there is no
peace in the Middle East, oil
supplies will naturally be en
dangered," he says."And there
can be no peace in the Middle
East without a Palestinian
state."
For an oil-hungry country
such as Japan, the message is
painfully clear and it has helped
to move this country closer and
closer to the PLO in the past
seven years: Japan wants oil;
the Arab countries have it, and
dealing with them means deal
ing on closer terms with the
PLO.
That relationship may reach
an important new stage this
year if, as widely expected,
PLO leader Yasser Arafat pays
a visit to Tokyo. In all but name,
it would be an official state vis
it. He would come as the private
guest of Japanese parliament
members, but he has been
promised audiences with the
prime minister and foreign min
ister.
PLO coup
If Arafat comes — and one
Japanese official says the odds
are 50-50 — it would be an impor
tant coup for the PLO as, backed
by Arab oil power, it inches

toward international recogni
tion. He has never made even
unofficial visits to the United
States, and of the Western Eu
ropean countries he has been
welcomed only in Austria and
Spain.
A trip to Tokyo thus would be
regarded as a significant step
forward in the noncommunist
world.
The substance of the visit
may be less important than the
simple fact that it occurs.
Arafat is expected to press his
campaign for recognition of the
PLO as the sole representative
of Palestinians and for official
diplomatic status for his small
mission here. The Japanese say
they will not agree and will, in
stead, call on him to renounce
terrorism and recognize the
right of Israel to exist.
U.S. warning
The United States has ob
jected quietly to Arafat's visit,
warning that it will not help the
cause of peace in the Middle
East and may damage Japan's
image in the United States.
But Japanese officials, while
privately acknowledging the
role oil pressures play in their
PLO policy, also insist that
dealing with the organization
has independent merit.
"We think that peace and sta
bility in the Middle East are
very important and to have
them you cannot refuse to have
a dialogue with the PLO,'' said

Koichi Tsutsumi, deputy direc
tor-general of the Foreign Min
istry's Middle East and African
Bureau. You can't ignore
(Arafat). It is wrong to act as if
the PLO is just a group of ter
rorists. They have influence."
Until the great oil shock of
1973-74, Japan did not have
much of a Middle East policy.
That region was and is the
source of much of its oil. But
Japan in those days bought most
of its supplies through Ameri
can oil companies. The oil shock
changed all that.
Policy change
The policy changed swiftly. In
1974, Japan voted to give the
PLO observer status in the Unit
ed Nations and in 1976 agreed to
permit the organization to open
a Tokyo office, without diplo
matic status.
Japan today goes a step
further than West European
countries in dealing with the
PLO. Like Europe, it agrees to
the right of PLO self-de
termination but. unlike Europe
generally, it also asserts that
this gives the PLO the right to
an independent state.
In addition to seeking stable
oil supplies from the Middle
East, he said, Japan also wants
to sell industrial plants and oth
er technologically advanced
goods to wealthy Arab states in
the process of modernization.
So the PLO's first line of con
tact is with the businessmen
who have great political in
fluence in Japan.
His office supplies those busi
nessmen with information and
arranges commercial contacts
for them when they visit Middle
Eastern countries.
"To any business delegation
going to the Middle East, we say
that they should meet Palesti
nians in the normal course of
doing business," he added.
"They recognize the im
portance of the Palestinians and
we arrange contacts for them."
Hamid's. message to busi
nessmen and bureaucrats trav

eling to the Middle East is that
peace and oil supplies are inex
tricably entangled and that to
get along with the Arab coun
tries they must take a favorable
attitude toward the PLO.
"We tell them that they can
satisfy the Arab countries by
taking a realistic view of
Palestine," he said.
That message, he said, is also
made clear to the Japanese gov
ernment by leaders of the oil
rich nations. As an example, he
cited the visit here in November
1979 of Mana Saeed Otaiba, oil
minister of the United Arab
Emirates who had earlier
opened negoatiations with
Japan on the PLO's behalf.
"Otaiba told them that you
cannot speak about guarantees
of oil and supplies of oil without
looking to our political in
terests, which is the Palestinian
question," Hamid said.
That meeting with Otaiba,
Hamid asserts, ended with a
Japanese promise to arrange
audiences for Arafat with the
prime minister and foreign min
ister.
Japan still refuses, however,
to issue Arafat a formal invita
tion for a state visit. The one
outstanding now was issued by a
group of pro-Arab parliament
members headed by a former
foreign minister, Toshio
Kimura.
At first, Arafat seemed in
clined to reject the invitation
since it did not offer the formal
recognition of a state visit. But
he has recently accepted the
principle of coming as an unof
ficial visitor with the promise of
seeing Prime Minister Zenko
Suzuki and Foreign Minister
Masayoshi Ito.
Japanese officials said they
made it clear they would not
promise Arafat they would rec
ognize his organization as the
sole representative of the
Palestinians and that they
would not grant diplomatic sta
tus to the office Hamid heads in
Tokyo.

guest of Japanese parliament
members, but he has been
promised audiences with the
prime minister and foreign min
ister.
PLO coup
If Arafat comes — and one
Japanese official says the odds
are 50-50 — it would be an impor
tant coup for the PLO as, backed
by Arab oil power, it inches

toward international recogni
tion. He has never made even
unofficial visits to the United
States, and of the Western Eu
ropean countries he has been
welcomed only in Austria and
Spain.
A trip to Tokyo thus would be
regarded as a significant step
forward in the noncommunist
world.
The substance of the visit
may be less important than the
simple fact that it occurs.
Arafat is expected to press his
campaign for recognition of the
PLO as the sole representative
of Palestinians and for official
diplomatic status for his small
mission here. The Japanese say
they will not agree and will, in
stead, call on him to renounce
terrorism and recognize the
right of Israel to exist.
U.S. warning
The United States has ob
jected quietly to Arafat's visit,
warning that it will not help the
cause of peace in the Middle
East and may damage Japan's
image in the United States.
But Japanese officials, while
privately acknowledging the
role oil pressures play in their
PLO policy, also insist that
dealing with the organization
has independent merit.
"We think that peace and sta
bility in the Middle East are
very important and to have
them you cannot refuse to have
a dialogue with the PLO,'' said

Koichi Tsutsumi, deputy direc
tor-general of the Foreign Min
istry's Middle East and African
Bureau. You can't ignore
(Arafat). It is wrong to act as if
the PLO is just a group of ter
rorists. They have influence."
Until the great oil shock of
1973-74, Japan did not have
much of a Middle East policy.
That region was and is the
source of much of its oil. But
Japan in those days bought most
of its supplies through Ameri
can oil companies. The oil shock
changed all that.
Policy change
The policy changed swiftly. In
1974, Japan voted to give the
PLO observer status in the Unit
ed Nations and in 1976 agreed to
permit the organization to open
a Tokyo office, without diplo
matic status.
Japan today goes a step
further than West European
countries in dealing with the
PLO. Like Europe, it agrees to
the right of PLO self-de
termination but. unlike Europe
generally, it also asserts that
this gives the PLO the right to
an independent state.
In addition to seeking stable
oil supplies from the Middle
East, he said, Japan also wants
to sell industrial plants and oth
er technologically advanced
goods to wealthy Arab states in
the process of modernization.
So the PLO's first line of con
tact is with the businessmen
who have great political in
fluence in Japan.
His office supplies those busi
nessmen with information and
arranges commercial contacts
for them when they visit Middle
Eastern countries.
"To any business delegation
going to the Middle East, we say
that they should meet Palesti
nians in the normal course of
doing business," he added.
"They recognize the im
portance of the Palestinians and
we arrange contacts for them."
Hamid's. message to busi
nessmen and bureaucrats trav

eling to the Middle East is that
peace and oil supplies are inex
tricably entangled and that to
get along with the Arab coun
tries they must take a favorable
attitude toward the PLO.
"We tell them that they can
satisfy the Arab countries by
taking a realistic view of
Palestine," he said.
That message, he said, is also
made clear to the Japanese gov
ernment by leaders of the oil
rich nations. As an example, he
cited the visit here in November
1979 of Mana Saeed Otaiba, oil
minister of the United Arab
Emirates who had earlier
opened negoatiations with
Japan on the PLO's behalf.
"Otaiba told them that you
cannot speak about guarantees
of oil and supplies of oil without
looking to our political in
terests, which is the Palestinian
question," Hamid said.
That meeting with Otaiba,
Hamid asserts, ended with a
Japanese promise to arrange
audiences for Arafat with the
prime minister and foreign min
ister.
Japan still refuses, however,
to issue Arafat a formal invita
tion for a state visit. The one
outstanding now was issued by a
group of pro-Arab parliament
members headed by a former
foreign minister, Toshio
Kimura.
At first, Arafat seemed in
clined to reject the invitation
since it did not offer the formal
recognition of a state visit. But
he has recently accepted the
principle of coming as an unof
ficial visitor with the promise of
seeing Prime Minister Zenko
Suzuki and Foreign Minister
Masayoshi Ito.
Japanese officials said they
made it clear they would not
promise Arafat they would rec
ognize his organization as the
sole representative of the
Palestinians and that they
would not grant diplomatic sta
tus to the office Hamid heads in
Tokyo.
Tokyo — The formula for
dealing with Japan is not com
plicated. explains Fathi Hamid,
the Tokyo representative of the
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion.
"We say that if there is no
peace in the Middle East, oil
supplies will naturally be en
dangered," he says."And there
can be no peace in the Middle
East without a Palestinian
state."
For an oil-hungry country
such as Japan, the message is
painfully clear and it has helped
to move this country closer and
closer to the PLO in the past
seven years: Japan wants oil;
the Arab countries have it, and
dealing with them means deal
ing on closer terms with the
PLO.
That relationship may reach
an important new stage this
year if, as widely expected,
PLO leader Yasser Arafat pays
a visit to Tokyo. In all but name,
it would be an official state vis
it. He would come as the private
guest of Japanese parliament
members, but he has been
promised audiences with the
prime minister and foreign min
