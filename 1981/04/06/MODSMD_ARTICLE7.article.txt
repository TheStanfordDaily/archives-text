# Liberals may beat Quebec separatists
## 
### 
Montreal (AP) — A victory
by the incumbent Parti Quebec
ois in next week's provincial
elections would boost the
French Canadian secessionist
movement, even though party
leader Rene Levesque has tem
porarily put the issue on the
shelf. But analysts give the op
position Liberal Party an even
chance of unseating the separa
tists.
Advocates of Quebec's politi
cal independence are still reel
ing from their defeat in a refer
endum on separatism last May,
and Liberal leader Claude Ryan
is urging voters to "drive the
last nail into the coffin of the
Parti Quebecois."
The 3 million Quebecois ex
pected to vote April 13 will
choose 122 members of a newly
expanded National Assembly,
the legislature of this province
of 6 million people — 80 percent
of whom speak French.
Dissolution
When Levesque dissolved the
Assembly last month and called
for elections eight months
before the PQ's maximum five
year mandate expired, the rul
ing party held 67 seats in a 110-
seat house. The Liberals had 34,
the conservative Union Na
tional had five and two were
held by independents. Two seats
were vacant.
A recent public opinion poll
showed the PQ with 44 percent

of the popular vote and the Lib
erals with 38 percent. But be
cause analysts believe most of
those who would not state a
preference or said they were un
decided will vote Liberal, the
contest is rated a toss-up.
Liberal strength is concen
trated in relatively few districts
— mostly around Montreal and
in English-speaking pockets.
The 14-year-old PQ won a sub
stantial Assembly majority in
the 1976 elections with 41 per
cent of the popular vote.
But since then it has lost 11
special elections for vacant
seats. The biggest blow came in
last year's referendum, when
Quebecois voted 3-to-2 against
the PQ's proposal to open talks
with the federal government to
establish Quebec's "sovereign
ty-association." The proposal
called for the province's politi
cal independence, but with con
tinued close economic ties to the
rest of Canada.
Although it is the keystone of
the party charter, Levesque and
his followers have played down
the separatist issue, promising
that if they win, they will not
hold another referendum during
a second term.
They say they are confident
French speakers will eventually
realize sovereignty is the only
way to protect their culture in a
predominantly English-speak
ing nation.
