# India's nuclear plants: more power, less control
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bombay, India — Behind the security gates
and barbed-wire fencing that separate a thin
strip of flat coastal land from the rest of this
sprawling metropolitan area lies another In
dia.
It is clean, quiet, businesslike — and highly
controversial. It is the heart of India's nuclear
industry, the Bhabha Atomic Research Center,
known in officialese merely as "BARC."
Nuclear industry sources calculate that the
reactor known as "Cirus" has produced rough
ly 100 kilograms of plutonium during its two
decades of operation, providing India with a
stockpile capable of producing 20 Hiroshima
type bombs if the country's political masters
so decide. A few yards away, a second re
search reactor, more than twice the size, is un
der construction. When completed in 1982, it
will be capable of generating another 30 kilo
grams of plutonium annually, according to nu
clear experts, in addition to its operational
task of producing isotopes and helping further
development of power reactor technology.
There is no form of international safe
guarding of the research reactors nor will
there be controls on spent fuel from India's
self-sufficient power plants.
Because it requires no help with its pro
gram, India must answer to no one. Uranium
ore, mined and concentrated in rural Bihar, is
transformed into fuel elements at fabrication
plants in the southern city of Hyderabad and at
BARC. The highly complicated technology of
producing so-called heavy water, necessary in
India's type of reactor, plus the capability to
build the reactors themselves has also been de
veloped during the last decade.
Reprocessing
A reprocessing facility at Tarapur, in addi
tion to a small plant at BARC, completes In
dia's nuclear fuel capability.
"Although the currently operating nuclear
capacity in India is quite small, India is the
only country to have full control over the nucle
ar fuel cycle apart from the major nuclear
countries like the United States, the U.S.S.R.,
France and Britain," said Dr. H.N. Sethna,
chairman of India's Atomic Energy Com
mission.
To a country that has a national inferiority
complex in much of its relations with the West,
the achievement of nuclear self-sufficiency is
a matter of extreme pride.
Canadian technical aid throughout the 1960s
and early 1970s provided India with basic reac
tor technology, helped develop the country's
first pilot heavy-water plant and fuel fabri
cation complex at Hyderabad.
But since the Canadian pullout in the after
math of India's 1974 test explosion of a nuclear
warhead, it has been India's own scientists
who have moved the country's nuclear energy
program from a modest research effort to the
threshold of large-scale power generation.

While India and the United States are locked
in a bitter dispute over ultimate control of
U.S.-supplied spent fuel for Tarapur, India has
already accepted International Atomic
Energy Agency safeguards on the plant.
Concern
While the additional electricity will help to
ease India's critical electric power shortage,
international observers are deeply concerned
about the addition of something else from
these plants: completely unsafeguarded
plutonium.
Nuclear specialists calculate that the three
plants when operating at full capacity would
provide India roughly 400 kilograms per year
of unsafeguarded plutonium.
So far, India continues publicly to renounce
nuclear weapons development. Indian govern
ment officials are quick to note that India is the
only nation that has not openly embarked on
such a program after developing the technolo
gy
But the extremely high priority placed on at
taining nuclear independence means that that
decision will be India's alone.
India's nuclear scientists at BARC note that
the Cirus research reactor, which turned out
the plutonium for India's nuclear explosion,
also provides isotopes for peaceful purposes.
One of the most important of these potential
applications is food preservation. With only
minimal canning, freezing or refrigerating ca
pacity and an excessively hot climate, irradia
tion of semi-perishable foods could dramati
cally increase the food available for consump
tion, scientists said.
WHO
The World Health Organization, as well as
Western countries including the U.S. and Cana
da, have declared certain irradiated foods, in
cluding onions, potatoes, grains and some
fruits, to be safe for unlimited consumption,
according to BARC officials.
A pamphlet produced by BARC claims that
much of the one third of India's onion crop that
is usually lost during storage and transporta
tion could be saved using this technique.
Regulated doses of gamma radiation de
stroy microorganisms that are responsible for
spoilage. They can also delay the ripening
process. Shelf life of potatoes, for example,
has been tripled from two to six months, BARC
scientists say.
So far, however, only testing has been com
pleted.
Isotopes for agricultural research, medical
treatment and industrial radiography are also
produced at BARC. Some are exported to other
Third World countries, and occasionally to the
West, including the United States.
But for the present India's nuclear program
rarely looks beyond India's shores. It is
focused inward, concentrating on completing
the road to self-sufficiency in all areas of nu
clear development.
