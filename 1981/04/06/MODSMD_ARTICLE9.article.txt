# Saudis cautiously watch U.S., pursue other options
## 
### Washington Post 
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia â€” Saudi Arabia, America's
most important economic and political ally in the Per
sian Gulf region, appears to have reached a critical
point in its already wavering attitude toward the Unit
ed States and to be developing a "European option" to
offset its traditional reliance on America.
As the Reagan administration weighs a Saudi re
quest for additional equipment to "enhance" the fire
power of its 60 American-built F-15s, the Saudis are
keenly watching for signs that the United States recog
nizes a need to repair the badly frayed "special rela
tionship" that has long existed between the two coun
tries.
No hurry
But the Saudi royal family has been sending out
strong signals over the past year of its serious intention
to shift away from its primary dependence on the Unit
ed States for security and arms if the new adminis
tration is not cooperative. It has begun laying the
groundwork for a viable "European option" as a hedge
against a serious deterioration in its traditional Ameri
can one.
At stake are not only billions of dollars in Saudi arms
contracts but possibly similar amounts in related
deals. Already, the kingdom has stunned the State De
partment and Pentagon by awarding a $3.4 billion con

tract to France for the next generation of naval ships
and by asking West Germany to drop its ban on arms
sales to regions of tension and to sell it tanks and other
weapons systems involving another $1 billion.
Litmus test
The F-15 issue has gone far beyond a pure military
matter to assume the proportions of what retiring U.S.
Ambassador John West calls a "litmus test" of the en
tire American attitude toward Saudi Arabia. "Because
the Israelis oppose it and some other factors, it has be
come a cause celebre and a point of honor," he re
marked in an interivew.
One "other" factor, in the view of a non-American
Western diplomat, is a natural process of "decoloniza
tion" in U.S.-Saudi ties. "You had a relationship which
for the past 10 or 20 years was almost colonial. They
(the Saudis) have grown up now and realize they (can)
get things elsewhere."
Another has been the impact of the Iranian-Iraqi
war, which provided the Saudi royal family the proof of
the legitimate military need for a better-equipped F-15
aircraft as well as early warning (AWAC) radar
planes.
Waffling
The United States' waffling over the F-15 issue has
infuriated at least part of the royal family and helped to
generate pressure for the development of much

stronger military ties to Europe. Defense Minister
Prince Sultan is said to be particularly upset by the in
consistency of the past Carter administration, which
assured him last summer through former secretary of
defense Harold Brown that the enhancement items
would be forthcoming only to have that assurance con
tradicted by President Jimmy Carter himself a few
days before the presidential elections.
The issue actually involves five different items as
sociated either with the aircraft itself or with the over
all Saudi air defense capability.They include wing fuel
tanks, air-to-air "head-on" missiles, bomb racks,
transport planes for in-air refueling and the AW AC ear
ly warning planes.
"They are not going to buy a caponized version of the
F15," remarked one American official.
"They are certainly going to finance the (French)
Mirage-4000 and buy the Mirage-2000 if we don't give
them F-155," said another informed source familar
with Saudi military views. "They don't have that much
invested (in the F-15) they couldn't pull out."
While the Saudis have placed their order for the U.S.
aircraft, they are not scheduled to actually take
possession of the first of them in Saudi Arabia until next
year, after completion of training on them in the United
States. So far, they have paid only a portion of the $3.5
billion price.
