Movies move to Terman
Cinematheque has announced that it will move some of its
spring film showings to Terman Auditorium on Tuesday
nights.
The Cinematheque is Stanford's "alternative" film series,
focusing primarily on independent, experimental and
animated films. The selections include both contemporary
Bay Area films and older classics.
The series begins tonight with a survey of "Vintage Car
toons." There will be 13 films in all, including the earliest Su
perman, Popeye, Hollywood and Disney works.
Upcoming evenings feature "Visual films" (April 14), in
cluding the classic Frank Film and "Dada and Surrealist
Films," featuring the original Nosferatu.
A donation of $2 ($1 for students) is requested. All shows
begin at 7:30 p.m.
