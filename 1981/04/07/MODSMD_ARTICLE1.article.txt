# Kennedy says grad stipends will be cut
## 
### 
Stanford's graduate students, who
have been complaining that the Uni
versity's financial assistance is insuf
ficient. will have to accept an even
greater responsibility for funding
their education, according to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
Speaking before the spring quarter
meeting of the Academic Council last
Friday, Kennedy said that "rampant
inflation" and "massive federal with
drawal" from graduate student aid
make it impossible for the University
to grant its Ph.D. candidates com
plete financial support.
Kennedy also told the Faculty Sen
ate last Thursday that the "most seri
ous" group of federal funding cut
backs affects graduate education.
"The expectation that Ph.D. pro
grams are to be fully subsidized, how
ever firmly it may be implanted in the
minds of some, is of recent historical
vintage and was never a full reality for
long," Kennedy told the council.
The University could lose $1.8 mil
lion annually, and individuals $600,000
in aid, should the Reagan adminis
tration phase out the National Science
Foundation fellowships and eliminate
institutional and indirect costs in fed
eral traineeships, as it proposed re
cently.
Already, failure to index NSF fel
lowship stipends and institutional al
lowances to account for the rising cost
of living is one reason why many grad
uate students struggle to meet their
expenses. The University currently
provides nearly $500,000 a year from
general funds to help meet educa
tional costs.
One significant source for financial
assistance has been the guaranteed
student loan program (GSL), from
which University Ph.D. students ob
tain $1.5 to $2 million annually. But the
new administration plans to hike the
effective interest rates on these loans.

making them less attractive.
Faced with the inevitability of re
duced federal funds. Kennedy told the
council that Stanford's goal should be
to give financial assistance at levels
comparable to those of "other first
rate institutions."
Kennedy said that any success the
University might have in maintaining
some of the loan programs would be
limited.
"Our efforts to retain the in-school
interest subsidy in the GSL program,
to save the NSF fellowships, and to
keep the number of natiorui research
service awards at. over 10.000 may
partially succeed," he told the facul
ty. "But we are nonetheless likely to
suffer some significant losses."
Kennedy and members of his staff
have discussed possible solutions.
Among the alternatives the Univer
sity could select are: reallocating gen
eral funds from other areas into grad
uate stipends; offering fellowship aid
for only three years instead ot four;
reducing the number of students ad
mitted to graduate programs; and
granting aid on the basis of need rath
er than merit, an idea which has re
ceived stiff opposition.
At a meeting this Wednesday eve
ning at 7:30 in Tresidder Room 282. in
terested graduate students will be dis
cussing the question of stipends with
Dean of Research and Graduate Stud
ies Gerald Lieberman.
