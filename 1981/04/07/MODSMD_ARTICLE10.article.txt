Bonn, West Germany (AP) â€”
This week's meeting of NATO
ministers, billed as Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger's
European diplomatic debut,
may become another crisis ses
sion on Poland, NATO officials
said Sunday.
The meeting today and
tomorrow is a regularly sched
uled session of the Nuclear
Planning Group, defense min
isters from the 13 North Atlan
tic Treaty Organization nations
who gather twice a year to re
view strategic policy.
But NATO officials preparing
for the session said the esca
lating crisis in Poland was like
ly to replace the usual long-term
defense planning as the domi
nant agenda topic.
The continuation of large
scale military maneuvers by

Warsaw Pact troops in or near
Poland, coupled with denuncia
tions of the Polish labor move
ment by the official Soviet press
have heightened the fears of
possible Soviet intervention in
Poland, according to U.S. of
ficials in Washington.
The meeting will be the first
cabinet-level consultation be
tween the NATO allies since De
cember, when the alliance
warned the Soviet Union that
any moves to intervene in Po
land would have grave conse
quences for East-West rela
tions. It also is the the first
NATO ministers' meeting since
the alliance began working in
secret on a series of responses
to be taken if the Soviet Union
intervened in Poland.
NATO sources who asked not
to be identified said the defense

ministers could reiterate the
December warning or could
fashion a new response to be an
nounced Wednesday at the end
of the meeting.
The White House announced
after telephone discussions be
tween President Ronald Reagan
and key allies last week that
Western financial aid plans for
Poland would be halted if the So
viet Union intervened. A con
sortium of Western nations is
currently trying to help Poland
re-finance its $25 billion foreign
debt.
Weinberger is expected to re
port to the allies on the status of
testing and production of U.S.
Pershing II and Cruise missiles
scheduled for deployment in
five NATO countries beginning
in 1983.
