# Iranians slash financial aid to students in 'fuzzy- study' majors
## Stanford students willing to comply 
### Todd Pickett 
For a few Iranian Stanford
students, repercussions from
the political and economic woes
of their homeland have threat
ened to alter the course of their
academic careers in the United
States In late February, Iran's
Ministry of Higher Education
issued a decree stopping all pub
lic and private financial aid
from Iran to those Iranian stu
dents with majors unrelated to
engineering, medicine, agricul
ture and the basic sciences.
Of the 91 Iranian students en
rolled here, six are pursuing
fields of study such as philoso
phy, business and education
which fall outside of the 125 ma
jors approved by the Iranian

While Iranian students are
the fifth largest contigency of
international students at Stan
ford, nationwide they make-up
the greatest number of foreign
students enrolled in American
schools from any one country,
according to the Institute of In
ternational Education.
The burden of financial cuts is
not new to the Iranian students
at Stanford who weathered the
freezing of Iranian assets dur
ing the hostage crisis, said Hall.
When asked their opinion of
their country's action, many
Iranian Stanford students sup
ported the order. "We should
look at what is best for the coun
try," said one Iranian, a gradu
ate student in philosophy.

U hen asked their opinion of their
country's action, many Iranian
Stanford students supported the
order.

government. Calling the order
"somewhat unusual," interna
tional student advisor Mitchell
Hall says he has received "mix
ed reactions" from a few stu
dents but has not yet been con
tacted by those students direct
ly affected by the move, which
took effect March 20.
According to Hall, the
number of Iranian students en
tering Stanford greatly in
creased during the 19705, proba
bly because of the need for more
skilled workers in the rapidly
developing oil-rich nation.

Other students cited the coun
try's poor economic health as
sufficient reason for cutbacks in
the cultivation of those academ
ic areas deemed less valuable.
"These (approved majors) are
the best investments for Iran,"
commented an Iranian stu
dent, one of 65 majoring in engi
neering.
Whether University funds will
be provided for the Iranians af
fected by the financial embargo
will be largely determined by
the individual schools of gradu
ate study which enroll about 95
percent of the Iranian students

at Stanford

Eleanor Worden, student ser
vices officer at the School of
Education where seven Iranians
are enrolled, said that Iranian
students needing additional
funds because of the cutback
would be considered on an equal
basis with other students in fi
nancial need. However, Worden
added that, at this time of the
year, little financial aid re
mains available for students not
already entitled to it. No Iranian
student in the School of Educa
tion has yet requested a change
of major or additional funds, ac
cording to Worden.
Although Iran's move to
change the majors of its stu
dents studying abroad is un
precedented, many foreign
countries have enacted regu
lations which aim at bridling the
education of their students
abroad, said Hall. Some stu
dents whose interests include
fields not currently in demand
in their own country may never
be allowed to further their
education in another country,
said Hall. In addition, engineer
ing firms in foreign countries
are often the primary exporters
of students for study abroad, ex
cluding those with academic in
terests in unrelated fields from
any educational opportunity,
said Hall.
In many other foreign coun
tries, students majoring in
fields listed by the home coun
try as in high demand must re
turn to that country to work for
at least two years after gradu
ation.
Although the action of the
Iranian government applies
only to a small percentage of
Stanford's Iranian population,
Hall encourages anyone af
fected by the order to contact
him.
