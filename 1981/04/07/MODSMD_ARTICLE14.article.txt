# Doctor 'discovers' a hiccup cure
## 
### Jenny Morgenthaler 
Though our grandmothers may have
told us that a teaspoon of sugar cures hic
cups, it is surprising that Dr. Edgar
Engleman of Stanford Medical Center
has become famous by stating this fact in
the New England -Journal of Medicine.
The-Journal. a highly respected medical
publication, received a letter from
Engleman in 1971 written to inform doc
tors of this simple cure of hiccups.
Engleman arrived at this conclusion in
an unusual way. He had been at a party
when his wife got a case of hiccups that
lasted more than an hour. A friend at the
party suggested the "old wive's tale"
cure of swallowing sugar, and it worked
immediately.
Engleman, an intern at the time, tried
the method on patients at the hospital
and found that it worked often. Then he
began looking for "hiccupers." "You
don't have to look too far," Engleman
said. In 20 months he had a success rate
of 19 out of 20 patients, all cured by the
sugar method.
Engleman ended his letter to the-Jour

nal by pointing out that his study was
very informal and did not constitute
medical proof. "It must be taken with a
grain of salt," Engleman had written.
The -Journal published his letter but de
leted the final sentence.
The New England -Journal of Medi
cine circulates in the East about a week
before it reaches the West coast. There
fore, when reporters knocked on
Engleman's door at 6:30 one morning
asking about his cure, he was quite sur
prised. "I didn't even know the letter had
been published!" Engleman said.
Doctors began sending their patients
with hiccup problems to Engleman, as
suming he was a "hiccup expert." "I dis
couraged it," Engleman said, "because
anyone can take a teaspoon of sugar
They don't need a doctor."
The reason the cure works is simple.
Hiccups are caused by an impulse along
the nerve that runs from the brain to the
diaphragm. When activated, this nerve
jerks the diaphragm and causes a sudden
intake of breath. The granulated sugar
irritates the back of the throat and inter
rupts the impulse.

Some serious ailments can cause hic
cups as a side effect â€” stomach prob
lems, brain tumors and anything else
that stimulates the nerve connecting the
brain and diaphragm. In these cases sug
ar may temporarily help, but the under
lying cause must be eliminated before
the hiccups cease.
There is another cure for hiccups that
works on the same principle.
Anesthesiologists encounter problems
with hiccups often, and they insert a tube
in the mouth of the patient and run it
down the throat, while the patient is un
conscious and the gagging mechanism is
absent.
Every few years Engleman's cure re
cieves public attention again. "It dies
down for a while, but then it starts
again," Engleman said. "I just tell them
the story."
A cure for hiccups may not be an im
portant medical breakthrough, but
Engleman s informal study and the ensu
ing publicity assured that many people
who suffer from hiccups will find relief
in a teaspoon of sugar.
