## Resignation a familiar threat 
### 
Washington — Secretary of
State Alexander Haig threat
ened to resign — details later.
So what else is new 9 What
head ot the State Department
has not threatened resignation
sooner or later? This latest bit
of gossip is not all that exciting
or different. Yet, in how many
national magazines did this
piece of news receive front cov
er space? The interesting thing
is the slant that each journal
took on this particular story.
Time was largely sympa
thetic to Haig's position and re
ported on his side of the story.
National gossip sheets focused
on the love affairs of Haig's sec
retary. The Chronicle high
lighted Haig's horoscope for the
day. Harper's Bazaar gave ex
tensive coverage to Haig's
dress, noting that he dresses
like a gangster. Everybody
knows that you can read the
news exactly as you want to
hear it if you look in the right
place.
But, how does each member
of the community perceive and
analyze this bit of factual in
formation : the bare threat to re
sign? A few guesses: The
number two man in the State
Department probably packed up
his entire office in anticipation
oi moving down the hall to the
"big room " The average com
munist revolutionary predicted
as usual that the time was right
for revolution (again) and that
all dedicated followers should
rise to the occasion, upon which
he was clapped in irons and
carted away to the nearest
pokey. Jeanne Dixon knew
beforehand; no surprises for
her. Senator S. I. Hayakawa has
not yet heard the news.
So much for specifics. How
can we generalize from the
basic observation that different
people perceive things dif
ferently? Suppose that a repre
sentative from each major on
campus had to write a news re
port on Haig's resignation.

Here's how some of them might
see it.
Economics: Haig transferred
all his capital into a single ac
count today by attempting to
cash in his chips by excercising
his option to resign. Haig's
marginal propensity to continue
as secretary is obviously at a
minimum Apparently, he has
perceived that he has been ex
ploited as a worker by the man
agement. This perception has
led to a revision of his
isopreference curve upward,
thereby shifting the equilibrium
point of the supply of Haig's per
sonality well above the demand
tor that personality by either
the public or the president. May
be i What is really meant there
is that everybody's damned
tired of all the crying from the
State Department). Haig has in
vested serious capital in his
position and is anxious to realize
an above average return on in
vestment, thereby yeilding a
profit higher than zero.
English majors: Haig's resig
nation lacked a coherent in
troduction. While the substance
of the resignation was succinct,
the overall clarity of the work
suffered from the distracting
ken that the secretary probably
would not in fact deracinate
himself from his post at any
cost; in short, the reader is left
thinking that the resignation
was all a power play. How dis
illusioning. The sheer brevity of
the piece leaves the reader
stunned and struggling. Un
resolved questions spawned
through insufficient character
development and hazy word
choice force the reader to
speculate: Will Haig really re
sign? Will the president accept?
Will Leonid Brezhnev's hair fall
out? These questions and many
more remain unanswered in the
midst of Haig's use of passive
voice, jargon, and unclear ante
cedents. Besides, he dresses
like a gangster.
Psychology majors: Haig's
resignation attempt raises seri

ous questions about his stability
as an integral human being.
This patently irrational series
of events leads us to conclude
that Haig is still in an adoles
cent stage of development,
demonstrated by what can only
be described as attention-get
ting measures to secure his
tenuous position in life. We be
lieve that he is the sort of person
who would*attempt to gain favor
with the general populace by
holding the front door of Green
Library open.
Haig obviously had an unhap
py childhood, which he is not yet
able to understand. Our collec
tive consciousnesses tell us that
perhaps his mother beat him. or
his dog beat him, or he beat his
dog, or his mother beat the dog.
We are not quite sure. In fact,
we don't even know the game
they were all playing. Perhaps
whist, although that seems un
likely at best. We do, however,
stick by our assertion that he is
the kind of man who opens the
door for Anatoly Dobrynin in an
attempt to stave off a Polish in
vasion.
Music majors: Haig's ill
composed resignation opus has
nothing to do with music, and
shall be gleefully ignored by us.
