## Gun control promises misleading 
### 
I. like many Americans (and
probably like most people at
Stanford), dislike and fear fire
arms. The primary purpose of
guns is to kill living beings.
Emotionally, I find guns fright
ening; intellectually, I am cer
tain they are dangerous. I would
prefer to live in a society in
which guns did not exist.
Especially in the wake of the
recent assassination attempt
against the President, many
people who feel as I do are de
manding stricter, more com
prehensive gun control.
Though I emotionally sympa
thize with such demands, I also
believe that such proposals
must be subjected to rational
examination: how would vari
ous gun control proposals ac
tually work in the real world?
Proposals to outlaw sales
only of cheap firearms (such as
"Saturday Night Specials") are
at best irrelevant to controlling
violence due to firearms.
Neither John Hinckley nor
Sarah Jane Moore nor Lee
Harvey Oswald would have been
deterred by having to pay a bit
more to get a firearm. Neither
professional criminals nor
amateurs intent on murder are
likely to balk at paying a higher

price to obtain a gun.
Indeed. Don Kates, a liberal
civil rights activist and poverty
lawyer, and the editor ot Re
stricting Handguns: The Liber
al Skeptics Speak Out, has
argued that the only result of
outlawing cheap firearms would
be to deny guns to those people
who are both law-abiding and
extremely poor. These are the
people who receive no signifi
cant protection from the police
and who can most plausibly
claim to need guns for their own
self-protection.
Members of the white middle
class, such as Reagan's at
tacker John Hinckley or anti
gay murderer Dan White, would
not be denied guns by anti-Sat
urday Night Special laws — de
spite the fact that the middle
class receives better police pro
tection. lives in better neighbor
hoods, and therefore has less
need of guns for self-protection
than do the extremely poor peo
ple (largely members ot minor
ity groups) who would be dis
armed by such laws.
Kates points out an interest
ing parallel to the policies of the
white-racist regime in Rhode
sia: the white-supremacist gov
ernment "imposed the death

sentence on scores of blacks for
the violation of firearm laws."
Of course, guns were not for
bidden to upper-class whites.
Proposals to register or
license guns or restrict the sale
of guns to those screened by the
police would, it put into prac
tice. also be ineffectual.
There are over fifty million
handguns in circulation in
America. No matter how tightly
we may restrict the original re
tail sale of firearms, it will be
impossible to control resale by
private persons or small busi
nesses. No system of control
can conceivably keep track of
the firearms currently held by
the general public as these guns
circulate from private person to
private person.
Furthermore, effective con
trol or screening by the police of
those who wish to own firearms
would inevitably be dis
criminatory. Dan White was a
former cop, and John Lennon's
murderer had worked as a se
curity officer: both men would
probably have been granted gun
permits even under a highly re
strictive system. Those denied
permits would be those people
whom police stereotype as "de
viant": minorities, gays, drug
users, the poor, etc.
In short, half-way measures
to gun control, such as restric
tive licensing or the outlawing
ot cheap guns, cannot work.
Furthermore, such half-way
measures, are in practice, if not
in intent, racist and dis
criminatory.
What then of outright prohibi
tion of firearms or at least of
handguns?
Assume that by some miracle
we can persuade or coerce most
criminals to hand in their guns.
That still leaves tens of millions
of guns held by generally law
abiding citizens.
Those people are not going to
turn in their guns — even if com
manded to do so by the law.
One may view such behavior
as lamentable, irrational, despi
cable, and inhuman, but the evi
dence indicates that this is how
the major fraction of gun
owners will behave. Both dis
cussions with gun owners and
the actual experience of Ameri
can jurisdictions which have
tried to control handguns in
dicate that gun owners would re
sist prohibition in massive num
bers.
As attorney Kates has pointed
out, the law-enforcement meas
ures required to break such re
sistance would make the pro
hibition of alcohol (or current
narcotics enforcement) look
like a picnic. Handguns are easy
to hide. For the police to effec
tively ferret out handguns, po
lice would have to be released

from current Constitutional Ve
strictions concerning search
warrants, unreasonable search
and seizure, and entrapment.
The only way to effectively
enforce an unpopular law —
whether prohibition of alcohol
or of handguns — on millions of
people who are determined to
resist is to erect a police state.
Our civil liberties and the Bill of
Rights are the price we would
have to pay to obtain an effec
tive prohibition of handguns.
To say this is not to advocate
gun ownership nor to defend the
NRA; it is simply to face some
hard if unpleasant tacts about
the real world.
Whether ownership of a gun
actually increases one's person
al security is irrelevant (I doubt
that it does myself). Millions of
people believe that a gun makes
them safer and will refuse to
give up their guns for that rea
son.
Whether the ownership of
guns increases the number of
homicides is also irrelevant
(careful statistical studies have
suggested that the effect, if any,
is small). Even if prohibition of
handguns were proven to be a
good thing, it could not be done
short of establishing a police
state.
Perhaps the greatest damage
done by proposals for gun con
trol is that discussions of it dis
tract both conservatives and lib
erals from considering work
able, realistic solutions to crime
and violence.
For example, law enforce
ment resources such as police,
courts and prisons, should be
directed solely to real crimes
rather than being wasted on vic
timless "crimes" such as pros
titution. drug use and gam
bling. The insanity defense and
the parole system should be
abolished. Juveniles should be
tried as adults.
And.the underlying social
problems including unemploy
ment, poverty and alienation
which contribute to crime must
be addressed, not by the clumsy
social engineering favored by
liberals nor by the repressive
authoritarianism favored by
conservatives, but by a new ap
proach which respects social di
versity and individual rights.
For many persons, including
myself, fear and hatred of fire
arms are nearly instinctual. But
we must not allow ourselves to
be misled by our feelings into
accepting the false promise of
gun control. Our efforts are
needed to find real solutions, not
false panaceas, to the problems
which confront us.

curity officer: both men would
probably have been granted gun
permits even under a highly re
strictive system. Those denied
permits would be those people
whom police stereotype as "de
viant": minorities, gays, drug
users, the poor, etc.
In short, half-way measures
to gun control, such as restric
tive licensing or the outlawing
ot cheap guns, cannot work.
Furthermore, such half-way
measures, are in practice, if not
in intent, racist and dis
criminatory.
What then of outright prohibi
tion of firearms or at least of
handguns?
Assume that by some miracle
we can persuade or coerce most
criminals to hand in their guns.
That still leaves tens of millions
of guns held by generally law
abiding citizens.
Those people are not going to
turn in their guns — even if com
manded to do so by the law.
One may view such behavior
as lamentable, irrational, despi
cable, and inhuman, but the evi
dence indicates that this is how
the major fraction of gun
owners will behave. Both dis
cussions with gun owners and
the actual experience of Ameri
can jurisdictions which have
tried to control handguns in
dicate that gun owners would re
sist prohibition in massive num
bers.
As attorney Kates has pointed
out, the law-enforcement meas
ures required to break such re
sistance would make the pro
hibition of alcohol (or current
narcotics enforcement) look
like a picnic. Handguns are easy
to hide. For the police to effec
tively ferret out handguns, po
lice would have to be released

from current Constitutional Ve
strictions concerning search
warrants, unreasonable search
and seizure, and entrapment.
The only way to effectively
enforce an unpopular law —
whether prohibition of alcohol
or of handguns — on millions of
people who are determined to
resist is to erect a police state.
Our civil liberties and the Bill of
Rights are the price we would
have to pay to obtain an effec
tive prohibition of handguns.
To say this is not to advocate
gun ownership nor to defend the
NRA; it is simply to face some
hard if unpleasant tacts about
the real world.
Whether ownership of a gun
actually increases one's person
al security is irrelevant (I doubt
that it does myself). Millions of
people believe that a gun makes
them safer and will refuse to
give up their guns for that rea
son.
Whether the ownership of
guns increases the number of
homicides is also irrelevant
(careful statistical studies have
suggested that the effect, if any,
is small). Even if prohibition of
handguns were proven to be a
good thing, it could not be done
short of establishing a police
state.
Perhaps the greatest damage
done by proposals for gun con
trol is that discussions of it dis
tract both conservatives and lib
erals from considering work
able, realistic solutions to crime
and violence.
For example, law enforce
ment resources such as police,
courts and prisons, should be
directed solely to real crimes
rather than being wasted on vic
timless "crimes" such as pros
titution. drug use and gam
bling. The insanity defense and
the parole system should be
abolished. Juveniles should be
tried as adults.
And.the underlying social
problems including unemploy
ment, poverty and alienation
which contribute to crime must
be addressed, not by the clumsy
social engineering favored by
liberals nor by the repressive
authoritarianism favored by
conservatives, but by a new ap
proach which respects social di
versity and individual rights.
For many persons, including
myself, fear and hatred of fire
arms are nearly instinctual. But
we must not allow ourselves to
be misled by our feelings into
accepting the false promise of
gun control. Our efforts are
needed to find real solutions, not
false panaceas, to the problems
which confront us.

I. like many Americans (and
probably like most people at
Stanford), dislike and fear fire
arms. The primary purpose of
guns is to kill living beings.
Emotionally, I find guns fright
ening; intellectually, I am cer
tain they are dangerous. I would
prefer to live in a society in
which guns did not exist.
Especially in the wake of the
recent assassination attempt
against the President, many
people who feel as I do are de
manding stricter, more com
prehensive gun control.
Though I emotionally sympa
thize with such demands, I also
believe that such proposals
must be subjected to rational
examination: how would vari
ous gun control proposals ac
tually work in the real world?
Proposals to outlaw sales
only of cheap firearms (such as
"Saturday Night Specials") are
at best irrelevant to controlling
violence due to firearms.
Neither John Hinckley nor
Sarah Jane Moore nor Lee
Harvey Oswald would have been
deterred by having to pay a bit
more to get a firearm. Neither
professional criminals nor
amateurs intent on murder are
likely to balk at paying a higher

price to obtain a gun.
Indeed. Don Kates, a liberal
civil rights activist and poverty
lawyer, and the editor ot Re
stricting Handguns: The Liber
al Skeptics Speak Out, has
argued that the only result of
outlawing cheap firearms would
be to deny guns to those people
who are both law-abiding and
extremely poor. These are the
people who receive no signifi
cant protection from the police
and who can most plausibly
claim to need guns for their own
self-protection.
Members of the white middle
class, such as Reagan's at
tacker John Hinckley or anti
gay murderer Dan White, would
not be denied guns by anti-Sat
urday Night Special laws — de
spite the fact that the middle
class receives better police pro
tection. lives in better neighbor
hoods, and therefore has less
need of guns for self-protection
than do the extremely poor peo
ple (largely members ot minor
ity groups) who would be dis
armed by such laws.
Kates points out an interest
ing parallel to the policies of the
white-racist regime in Rhode
sia: the white-supremacist gov
ernment "imposed the death

sentence on scores of blacks for
the violation of firearm laws."
Of course, guns were not for
bidden to upper-class whites.
Proposals to register or
license guns or restrict the sale
of guns to those screened by the
police would, it put into prac
tice. also be ineffectual.
There are over fifty million
handguns in circulation in
America. No matter how tightly
we may restrict the original re
tail sale of firearms, it will be
impossible to control resale by
private persons or small busi
nesses. No system of control
can conceivably keep track of
the firearms currently held by
the general public as these guns
circulate from private person to
private person.
Furthermore, effective con
trol or screening by the police of
those who wish to own firearms
would inevitably be dis
criminatory. Dan White was a
former cop, and John Lennon's
murderer had worked as a se
curity officer: both men would
probably have been granted gun
permits even under a highly re

the parole system should be
abolished. Juveniles should be
tried as adults.
And.the underlying social
problems including unemploy
ment, poverty and alienation
which contribute to crime must
be addressed, not by the clumsy

For many persons, including
myself, fear and hatred of fire
arms are nearly instinctual. But
we must not allow ourselves to
be misled by our feelings into
accepting the false promise of
gun control. Our efforts are
needed to find real solutions, not
false panaceas, to the problems
which confront us.
