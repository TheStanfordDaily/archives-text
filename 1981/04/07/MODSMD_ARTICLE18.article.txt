## Douglas Smith Fallacy of protection surrounds handguns 
### 
On December 9 John Lennon
was murdered. Four shots were
fired into his back. Those shots
came from a handgun. Last
week President Ronald Reagan,
his press secretary James
Brady, a Secret Service agent
and a policeman were injured in
an assassination attempt. The
weapon used was a 22-caliber
revolver, more commonly

known as a "Saturday Night
Special."
According to FBI statistics,
10,728 Americans were
murdered with handguns in 1979
and over 250,000 other handgun
crimes were committed: shoot
ings, assaults, robberies and
rapes. Another 2000 people died
in firearm accidents. Let's put
these numbers into perspective.

During the Vietnam War, 46,121
American soldiers were killed
in action while in that same pe
riod twice as many civilians
were murdered with guns here
at home. It is obvious that our
greatest enemy was not the
North Vietnamese, but
ourselves.
If handguns cause so much
murder and mayhem, why have
they not been banned? One an
swer is that many Americans
actually believe that guns pro
tect them from crime and vio
lence. In truth these weapons
are the cause of the crime and
violence that people wish to pro
tect themselves from. This
fallacy of protection is best il
lustrated by the FBI Uniform
Crime Report of 1975 which con
cludes that a person is six times
more likely to kill himself or a
family member with a handgun
kept at home than to stop a bur
glar with it. Many of these un
fortunate deaths can be at
tributed to accidental shoot
ings; most commonly the vic
tim is a child who discovers the
difference between a toy gun
and a real gun after it is too late.
While one-sixth of all handgun
deaths are accidental, it is even
more revealing to look at non
accidental fatalities. Shocking
ly, the typical murderer is not
nameless, faceless intruder, but
a friend or a relative of the vic
tim. The great majority of all
handgun deaths are the result of
"crimes ot passion": murders
committed in the heat of the mo
ment when an argument rages
out of control. Someone picks up
the gun in the nightstand drawer
and in one unthinking moment
pulls the trigger. The result is
irrevocable. "Oh God, what
have I done? I swear I didn't
mean to." This line is cried out
thousands of times each year.
Anyone can be a murderer.
The problem with handguns is
psychological. They are small,
harmless-looking, and toylike,
yet incredibly destructive. In
most "crimes of passion," the
assailant is horrified when he
sees how this harmless-looking
device has expressed his rage
with such lethal finality. How is
a child expected to comprehend
that something that looks like
his cap gun could be powerful
enough to kill him? However,
the criminal knows that a re
volver provides tremendous
power in a small package, and
that is the reason he carries it.
If people were not allowed to
carry handguns ot keep them at
home, accidental and "crime of
passion" shootings, which to
gether are responsible for the
overwhelming majority ot gun
deaths, would be practically
eliminated. This would also
drastically reduce handgun
murders committed by crimi
nals since, according to the Bu
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, 65 percent of all
crimes are carried out with sto
len handguns The major source
of these stolen firearms is
private residences; in fact,
100,000 handguns are stolen
from individuals each year.
Statistically, it is far more like
ly that a burglar will steal a fire
arm than be repelled by it. If
there were no weapons to steal,
there would be fewer guns in
circulation and fewer murders.
Despite these facts, some
people are still against gun con
trol. The National Rifle As
sociation (NRA) is the primary

mouthpiece for pro-gun senti
ment in this country and its
members raise some interest
ing arguments against gun con
trol. Their most common battle
cry is: "When guns are out
lawed. only outlaws will have
guns."
The validity of this claim is
easy to refute. The prepon
derance of gun deaths are the
result ot "crimes of passion"
and accidental shootings; this
is, they are not committed by
outlaws. Most of the remaining
handgun crimes are per
petrated by non-professionals —
thrill-seeking teenagers, small
time burglars — who do not plan
their crimes and use whatever
weapons are close at hand. If
firearms are not available,
many 'casual criminals' would
employ less lethal weapons such
as knives. It is only the pro
fessional who would go to all the
trouble and expense to obtain an
outlawed pistol.
With our present laws allow
ing the private possession of
handguns, it is all too easy for a
citizen to delude himself into
thinking that his weapon will
prevent a professional from
committing a crime. Opposing a
hardened criminal, according to
government studies, drastically
increase.-; one's chances of being
killed.
If you want *o stay alive when
threatened by a gun, it is much
smarter to be cooperative than
combative. And banning hand
guns to private citizens would
discourage such foolish heroics
as trying to outgun a robber, in
the process saving many lives.
Moreover, the major sources of
arms supply for professional
and casual criminals — legal
sales and stolen weapons —
would be almost eliminated,
greatly reducing the chances of
such armed confrontations.
Last year only 300 recorded
cases of crimes were prevented
by armed citizens: in contrast,
254,000 crimes were committed
against citizens by armed as
sailants
The main argument that the
NRA and other gun-control op
ponents bring up is that is is un
constitutional to ban handguns.
This claim is totally false. The
Second Amendment to the Con
stitution declares that the right
to bear arms is guaranteed to "a
well-regulated militia"; no
where does it state that each
and every countryman has his
right. A "well-regulated
militia," according to the Su
preme Court, is represented by
the National Guard. In 1976, the
U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Ap
peals ruled that "there can be no
serious claim to any express
constitutional right by an indi
vidual to possess a firearm." In
the case of the I United States v.
Cruickshank, the Supreme
Court ruled: "The bearing of
arms for a lawful purpose . . is
not a right granted by the Con
stitution." Since 1842, the Su
preme Court has made tour oth
er rulings that reached the same
exact conclusion.
There is one point that is quite
curious about the NRA's posi
tion on handgun control. Why is
this organization opposed to
banning handguns when it is
supposed to be a rifle associa
tion that represents the gaming
and hunting interests of its
members? After all, nobody
goes deerhunting with a Satur
day Night Special. The outlaw

ing of valid sporting guns, such
as rifles and shotguns, is not
even being considered.
The motives of the National
Rifle Association become more
clear when economics is con
sidered. This organization re
ceives the lion's share of its $30
million annual budget in ad
vertising revenue from gun
manufacturers, companies that
make handguns as well as rifles.
As a result of their huge operat
ing budget and extensive gun in
dustry backing, the NRA is one
of the most powerful lobbies in
Washington.
The success of the NRA's
Washington lobby is particular
ly disturbing when one con
siders that in every poll taken in
the past 50 years, the public has
decisively favored handgun con
trol.
It is hard to doubt the logic be
hind the claim that outlawing
pistols and revolvers will re
duce crime, but is there any
real-world proof? There cer
tainly is. In Japan it is almost
impossible for a private citizen
to secure a handgun. Conse
quently, the murder rate there
is 200 times lower than in the
U.S. In England there is a simi
lar civilian handgun ban; their
murder rate is 1 percent that of
the United States.
Mandatory handgun regis
tration has been espoused by
some people as a less drastic al
ternative to an all-out ban. How
ever, in states where strict reg
istration laws have been
enacted — New York being the
latest example — the effects on
crime and violence have been
slight. The reason for the failure
of weapons licensing is simple.
It does not reduce "crimes of
passion" or accidental shoot
ings since guns involved in these
incidents are usually regis
tered.
As for reducing criminal ac
tivity, why would anyone who
commits a crime worry about
whether or not his pistol is regis
tered? The greatest short
coming of gun registration is
that is does not reduce the in
credible number of handguns in
circulation — currently 55 mil
lion — and thus does not lessen
the availability or convenience
of these weapons. Chapman's
38-caliber snub-nose revolver
was legally registered with the
Hawaiian police. He still
murdered John Lennon. The
proof is unmistakable, the only
way to substantially reduce the
violence in our society is to pass
a federal law banning all hand
guns.
Murder is a horrible
phenomenon that is all too real
in our society. In New York
City, when a black male dies,
there is an 11 percent chance
that the death resulted not from
cancer, a heart attack, or a
stroke, but from a handgun
blast. It is high time that these
firearms are eliminated from
our country so that it can be
come a safer, saner place to
live. Until that time, always
keep in the back of your mind
the fact that one in nine Ameri
cans had already come face-to
face with the business end of a
handgun. You could be next.

greatest enemy was not the
North Vietnamese, but
ourselves.
If handguns cause so much
murder and mayhem, why have
they not been banned? One an
swer is that many Americans
actually believe that guns pro
tect them from crime and vio
lence. In truth these weapons
are the cause of the crime and
violence that people wish to pro
tect themselves from. This
fallacy of protection is best il
lustrated by the FBI Uniform
Crime Report of 1975 which con
cludes that a person is six times
more likely to kill himself or a
family member with a handgun
kept at home than to stop a bur
glar with it. Many of these un
fortunate deaths can be at
tributed to accidental shoot
ings; most commonly the vic
tim is a child who discovers the
difference between a toy gun
and a real gun after it is too late.
While one-sixth of all handgun
deaths are accidental, it is even
more revealing to look at non
accidental fatalities. Shocking
ly, the typical murderer is not
nameless, faceless intruder, but
a friend or a relative of the vic
tim. The great majority of all
handgun deaths are the result of
"crimes ot passion": murders
committed in the heat of the mo
ment when an argument rages
out of control. Someone picks up
the gun in the nightstand drawer
and in one unthinking moment
pulls the trigger. The result is
irrevocable. "Oh God, what
have I done? I swear I didn't
mean to." This line is cried out
thousands of times each year.
Anyone can be a murderer.
The problem with handguns is
psychological. They are small,
harmless-looking, and toylike,
yet incredibly destructive. In
most "crimes of passion," the
assailant is horrified when he
sees how this harmless-looking
device has expressed his rage
with such lethal finality. How is
a child expected to comprehend
that something that looks like
his cap gun could be powerful
enough to kill him? However,
the criminal knows that a re
volver provides tremendous
power in a small package, and
that is the reason he carries it.
If people were not allowed to
carry handguns ot keep them at
home, accidental and "crime of
passion" shootings, which to
gether are responsible for the
overwhelming majority ot gun
deaths, would be practically
eliminated. This would also
drastically reduce handgun
murders committed by crimi
nals since, according to the Bu
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, 65 percent of all
crimes are carried out with sto
len handguns The major source
of these stolen firearms is
private residences; in fact,
100,000 handguns are stolen
from individuals each year.
Statistically, it is far more like
ly that a burglar will steal a fire
arm than be repelled by it. If
there were no weapons to steal,
there would be fewer guns in
circulation and fewer murders.
Despite these facts, some
people are still against gun con
trol. The National Rifle As
sociation (NRA) is the primary

mouthpiece for pro-gun senti
ment in this country and its
members raise some interest
ing arguments against gun con
trol. Their most common battle
cry is: "When guns are out
lawed. only outlaws will have
guns."
The validity of this claim is
easy to refute. The prepon
derance of gun deaths are the
result ot "crimes of passion"
and accidental shootings; this
is, they are not committed by
outlaws. Most of the remaining
handgun crimes are per
petrated by non-professionals —
thrill-seeking teenagers, small
time burglars — who do not plan
their crimes and use whatever
weapons are close at hand. If
firearms are not available,
many 'casual criminals' would
employ less lethal weapons such
as knives. It is only the pro
fessional who would go to all the
trouble and expense to obtain an
outlawed pistol.
With our present laws allow
ing the private possession of
handguns, it is all too easy for a
citizen to delude himself into
thinking that his weapon will
prevent a professional from
committing a crime. Opposing a
hardened criminal, according to
government studies, drastically
increase.-; one's chances of being
killed.
If you want *o stay alive when
threatened by a gun, it is much
smarter to be cooperative than
combative. And banning hand
guns to private citizens would
discourage such foolish heroics
as trying to outgun a robber, in
the process saving many lives.
Moreover, the major sources of
arms supply for professional
and casual criminals — legal
sales and stolen weapons —
would be almost eliminated,
greatly reducing the chances of
such armed confrontations.
Last year only 300 recorded
cases of crimes were prevented
by armed citizens: in contrast,
254,000 crimes were committed
against citizens by armed as
sailants
The main argument that the
NRA and other gun-control op
ponents bring up is that is is un
constitutional to ban handguns.
This claim is totally false. The
Second Amendment to the Con
stitution declares that the right
to bear arms is guaranteed to "a
well-regulated militia"; no
where does it state that each
and every countryman has his
right. A "well-regulated
militia," according to the Su
preme Court, is represented by
the National Guard. In 1976, the
U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Ap
peals ruled that "there can be no
serious claim to any express
constitutional right by an indi
vidual to possess a firearm." In
the case of the I United States v.
Cruickshank, the Supreme
Court ruled: "The bearing of
arms for a lawful purpose . . is
not a right granted by the Con
stitution." Since 1842, the Su
preme Court has made tour oth
er rulings that reached the same
exact conclusion.
There is one point that is quite
curious about the NRA's posi
tion on handgun control. Why is
this organization opposed to
banning handguns when it is
supposed to be a rifle associa
tion that represents the gaming
and hunting interests of its
members? After all, nobody
goes deerhunting with a Satur
day Night Special. The outlaw

ing of valid sporting guns, such
as rifles and shotguns, is not
even being considered.
The motives of the National
Rifle Association become more
clear when economics is con
sidered. This organization re
ceives the lion's share of its $30
million annual budget in ad
vertising revenue from gun
manufacturers, companies that
make handguns as well as rifles.
As a result of their huge operat
ing budget and extensive gun in
dustry backing, the NRA is one
of the most powerful lobbies in
Washington.
The success of the NRA's
Washington lobby is particular
ly disturbing when one con
siders that in every poll taken in
the past 50 years, the public has
decisively favored handgun con
trol.
It is hard to doubt the logic be
hind the claim that outlawing
pistols and revolvers will re
duce crime, but is there any
real-world proof? There cer
tainly is. In Japan it is almost
impossible for a private citizen
to secure a handgun. Conse
quently, the murder rate there
is 200 times lower than in the
U.S. In England there is a simi
lar civilian handgun ban; their
murder rate is 1 percent that of
the United States.
Mandatory handgun regis
tration has been espoused by
some people as a less drastic al
ternative to an all-out ban. How
ever, in states where strict reg
istration laws have been
enacted — New York being the
latest example — the effects on
crime and violence have been
slight. The reason for the failure
of weapons licensing is simple.
It does not reduce "crimes of
passion" or accidental shoot
ings since guns involved in these
incidents are usually regis
tered.
As for reducing criminal ac
tivity, why would anyone who
commits a crime worry about
whether or not his pistol is regis
tered? The greatest short
coming of gun registration is
that is does not reduce the in
credible number of handguns in
circulation — currently 55 mil
lion — and thus does not lessen
the availability or convenience
of these weapons. Chapman's
38-caliber snub-nose revolver
was legally registered with the
Hawaiian police. He still
murdered John Lennon. The
proof is unmistakable, the only
way to substantially reduce the
violence in our society is to pass
a federal law banning all hand
guns.
Murder is a horrible
phenomenon that is all too real
in our society. In New York
City, when a black male dies,
there is an 11 percent chance
that the death resulted not from
cancer, a heart attack, or a
stroke, but from a handgun
blast. It is high time that these
firearms are eliminated from
our country so that it can be
come a safer, saner place to
live. Until that time, always
keep in the back of your mind
the fact that one in nine Ameri
cans had already come face-to
face with the business end of a
handgun. You could be next.

On December 9 John Lennon
was murdered. Four shots were
fired into his back. Those shots
came from a handgun. Last
week President Ronald Reagan,
his press secretary James
Brady, a Secret Service agent
and a policeman were injured in
an assassination attempt. The
weapon used was a 22-caliber
revolver, more commonly

known as a "Saturday Night
Special."
According to FBI statistics,
10,728 Americans were
murdered with handguns in 1979
and over 250,000 other handgun
crimes were committed: shoot
ings, assaults, robberies and
rapes. Another 2000 people died
in firearm accidents. Let's put
these numbers into perspective.

During the Vietnam War, 46,121
American soldiers were killed
in action while in that same pe
riod twice as many civilians
were murdered with guns here
at home. It is obvious that our
greatest enemy was not the
North Vietnamese, but

accidental fatalities. Shocking
ly, the typical murderer is not
nameless, faceless intruder, but
a friend or a relative of the vic
tim. The great majority of all
handgun deaths are the result of
"crimes ot passion": murders
committed in the heat of the mo
ment when an argument rages
out of control. Someone picks up
the gun in the nightstand drawer
and in one unthinking moment
pulls the trigger. The result is
irrevocable. "Oh God, what
have I done? I swear I didn't
mean to." This line is cried out
thousands of times each year.
Anyone can be a murderer.
The problem with handguns is
psychological. They are small,
harmless-looking, and toylike,
yet incredibly destructive. In
most "crimes of passion," the
assailant is horrified when he
sees how this harmless-looking
device has expressed his rage
with such lethal finality. How is
a child expected to comprehend
that something that looks like
his cap gun could be powerful
enough to kill him? However,
the criminal knows that a re
volver provides tremendous
power in a small package, and
that is the reason he carries it.
If people were not allowed to
carry handguns ot keep them at
home, accidental and "crime of
passion" shootings, which to
gether are responsible for the
overwhelming majority ot gun
deaths, would be practically
eliminated. This would also
drastically reduce handgun
murders committed by crimi
nals since, according to the Bu
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, 65 percent of all
crimes are carried out with sto
len handguns The major source
of these stolen firearms is
private residences; in fact,
100,000 handguns are stolen
from individuals each year.
Statistically, it is far more like
ly that a burglar will steal a fire
arm than be repelled by it. If
there were no weapons to steal,
there would be fewer guns in
circulation and fewer murders.
Despite these facts, some
people are still against gun con
trol. The National Rifle As
sociation (NRA) is the primary

mouthpiece for pro-gun senti
ment in this country and its
members raise some interest
ing arguments against gun con
trol. Their most common battle
cry is: "When guns are out
lawed. only outlaws will have
guns."
The validity of this claim is
easy to refute. The prepon
derance of gun deaths are the
result ot "crimes of passion"
and accidental shootings; this
is, they are not committed by
outlaws. Most of the remaining
handgun crimes are per
petrated by non-professionals —
thrill-seeking teenagers, small
time burglars — who do not plan
their crimes and use whatever
weapons are close at hand. If
firearms are not available,
many 'casual criminals' would
employ less lethal weapons such
as knives. It is only the pro
fessional who would go to all the
trouble and expense to obtain an
outlawed pistol.
With our present laws allow
ing the private possession of
handguns, it is all too easy for a
citizen to delude himself into
thinking that his weapon will
prevent a professional from
committing a crime. Opposing a
hardened criminal, according to
government studies, drastically
increase.-; one's chances of being
killed.
If you want *o stay alive when
threatened by a gun, it is much
smarter to be cooperative than
combative. And banning hand
guns to private citizens would
discourage such foolish heroics
as trying to outgun a robber, in
the process saving many lives.
Moreover, the major sources of
arms supply for professional
and casual criminals — legal
sales and stolen weapons —
would be almost eliminated,
greatly reducing the chances of
such armed confrontations.
Last year only 300 recorded
cases of crimes were prevented
by armed citizens: in contrast,
254,000 crimes were committed
against citizens by armed as
sailants
The main argument that the
NRA and other gun-control op
ponents bring up is that is is un
constitutional to ban handguns.
This claim is totally false. The
Second Amendment to the Con
stitution declares that the right
to bear arms is guaranteed to "a
well-regulated militia"; no
where does it state that each
and every countryman has his
right. A "well-regulated
militia," according to the Su
preme Court, is represented by
the National Guard. In 1976, the
U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Ap
peals ruled that "there can be no
serious claim to any express
constitutional right by an indi
vidual to possess a firearm." In
the case of the I United States v.
Cruickshank, the Supreme
Court ruled: "The bearing of
arms for a lawful purpose . . is
not a right granted by the Con
stitution." Since 1842, the Su
preme Court has made tour oth
er rulings that reached the same
exact conclusion.
There is one point that is quite
curious about the NRA's posi
tion on handgun control. Why is
this organization opposed to
banning handguns when it is
supposed to be a rifle associa
tion that represents the gaming
and hunting interests of its
members? After all, nobody
goes deerhunting with a Satur
day Night Special. The outlaw

ing of valid sporting guns, such
as rifles and shotguns, is not
even being considered.
The motives of the National
Rifle Association become more
clear when economics is con
sidered. This organization re
ceives the lion's share of its $30
million annual budget in ad
vertising revenue from gun
manufacturers, companies that
make handguns as well as rifles.
As a result of their huge operat
ing budget and extensive gun in
dustry backing, the NRA is one
of the most powerful lobbies in
Washington.
The success of the NRA's
Washington lobby is particular
ly disturbing when one con
siders that in every poll taken in
the past 50 years, the public has
decisively favored handgun con
trol.
It is hard to doubt the logic be
hind the claim that outlawing
pistols and revolvers will re
duce crime, but is there any
real-world proof? There cer
tainly is. In Japan it is almost
impossible for a private citizen
to secure a handgun. Conse
quently, the murder rate there
is 200 times lower than in the
U.S. In England there is a simi
lar civilian handgun ban; their
murder rate is 1 percent that of
the United States.
Mandatory handgun regis
tration has been espoused by
some people as a less drastic al
ternative to an all-out ban. How
ever, in states where strict reg
istration laws have been
enacted — New York being the
latest example — the effects on
crime and violence have been
slight. The reason for the failure
of weapons licensing is simple.
It does not reduce "crimes of
passion" or accidental shoot
ings since guns involved in these
incidents are usually regis
tered.
As for reducing criminal ac
tivity, why would anyone who
commits a crime worry about
whether or not his pistol is regis
tered? The greatest short
coming of gun registration is
that is does not reduce the in
credible number of handguns in
circulation — currently 55 mil
lion — and thus does not lessen
the availability or convenience
of these weapons. Chapman's
38-caliber snub-nose revolver
was legally registered with the
Hawaiian police. He still
murdered John Lennon. The
proof is unmistakable, the only
way to substantially reduce the
violence in our society is to pass
a federal law banning all hand
guns.
Murder is a horrible
phenomenon that is all too real
in our society. In New York
City, when a black male dies,
there is an 11 percent chance
that the death resulted not from
cancer, a heart attack, or a
stroke, but from a handgun
blast. It is high time that these
firearms are eliminated from
our country so that it can be
come a safer, saner place to
live. Until that time, always
keep in the back of your mind
the fact that one in nine Ameri
cans had already come face-to
face with the business end of a
handgun. You could be next.

On December 9 John Lennon
was murdered. Four shots were
fired into his back. Those shots
came from a handgun. Last
week President Ronald Reagan,
his press secretary James
Brady, a Secret Service agent
and a policeman were injured in
an assassination attempt. The
weapon used was a 22-caliber
revolver, more commonly

known as a "Saturday Night
Special."
According to FBI statistics,
10,728 Americans were
murdered with handguns in 1979
and over 250,000 other handgun
crimes were committed: shoot
ings, assaults, robberies and
rapes. Another 2000 people died
in firearm accidents. Let's put
these numbers into perspective.

During the Vietnam War, 46,121
American soldiers were killed
in action while in that same pe
riod twice as many civilians
were murdered with guns here
at home. It is obvious that our
greatest enemy was not the
North Vietnamese, but
ourselves.
If handguns cause so much
murder and mayhem, why have
they not been banned? One an
swer is that many Americans
actually believe that guns pro
tect them from crime and vio
lence. In truth these weapons
are the cause of the crime and
violence that people wish to pro
tect themselves from. This
fallacy of protection is best il
lustrated by the FBI Uniform
Crime Report of 1975 which con
cludes that a person is six times
more likely to kill himself or a
family member with a handgun
kept at home than to stop a bur
glar with it. Many of these un
fortunate deaths can be at
tributed to accidental shoot
ings; most commonly the vic
tim is a child who discovers the
difference between a toy gun
and a real gun after it is too late.
While one-sixth of all handgun
deaths are accidental, it is even
more revealing to look at non
accidental fatalities. Shocking
ly, the typical murderer is not
nameless, faceless intruder, but
a friend or a relative of the vic
tim. The great majority of all
