# 'Tax revolt' grows as deadline approaches
## 
### She Associated Press 
His gray hair was neat, his
smile warm, his three-piece suit
authoritative. When he de
livered his homily with sincer
ity and flashes of humor, his an
gry gospel rang clear to the
small group of disciples
gathered in a Times Square
church for a Sunday meeting.
"You don't owe income tax!"
said the guest speaker, Ed El
lison, who represents a Mary
land-based tax protest group
called the Free State Constitu
tionalists.
"Right on!" shouted back a
man in the audience, wearing a
Revolutionary War style tri
corner hat.
It's a scene being repeated
across the country as the April
15 tax deadline nears — at a
Holiday Inn in Baltimore on
Monday nights, a temple in
Queens, N.Y., a smorgasbord
restaurant in Garden Grove,
Calif., before crowds of 150 or
more five nights a week.
These are America's tax re
bels — most of them white, po

litically conservative, middle
class — who are so enraged by
inflation and a poor economy, so
convinced that the federal gov
ernment is stripping away pre
cious freedoms, that they risk
fines and even prison by refus
ing to pay part or all of their fed
eral income tax.
In the last four years, 2,781
Americans have gone to jail for
tax fraud — and the IRS de
scribes 539 of them as tax pro
testers. The IRS says it has no
idea how much tax the govern
ment loses because of pro
testers.
And the problem is growing,
says the IRS. Spokesman Tony
Bombadere says in 1980 the gov
ernment received 13,390 protest
returns, up from 8,784 the year
before and 5,694 in 1978. •
"They are a stubborn bunch,"
says Vincent Walker of the Man
hattan district office of the IRS.
They don't consider themselves
lawbreakers, and many insist
the IRS has no right to exist,
much less to tax.
"The American people," says

James Wickstrom of Tigerton,
Wis., a member of a group
called Sheriff's Posse Com
itatus which claims chapters in
40 states, "finally are finding
out that the graduated income
tax is destroying them. They've
had enough of this communist
IRS."
In Maryland, there are the
Free State Constitutionalists
and the Committee of Cor
respondence. There's the Thom
as Jefferson Equal Tax Society
in Virginia, the Golden Mean So
ciety in Montana, the Tax Patri
ots in Sumter, S.C., the Commit
tee for the Restoration of the
Constitution in New York and
Americans for Constitutional
Taxation in Frederica, Del.,
among others.
On March 28, some 300 pro
testers led by the Americans for
Constitutional Rights recalled a
1773 anti-tax demonstration —
the Boston Tea Party — and
dumped tax forms in the Boston
harbor.
Walker, of the Manhattan IRS
office, says "all indications are

that the numbers are continuing
up "
In February, a Michigan anti
tax group. We The People ACT,
encouraged 3.500 auto workers
in Flint to declare dozens of ex
emptions to halt tax withholding
by their employers in the larg
est tax protest in memory Most
backed down under IRS pres
sure, and the agency recently
announced a crackdown on that
form of protest.
Anti-tax movement activists
estimate that there are 30 or 40
active tax protest groups scat
tered around the country, with
total active membership any
where from 50,000 to 250,000
Most of the groups have a few
hundred members, but at least
two — Your Heritage Protec
tion Association in Los Angeles,
and the Alaska Patriots in Ac
tion — claim close to 20,000
members each
Nevertheless, Carr
Ferguson, until Jan. 20 the as
sistant U.S. attorney general in
charge of the Justice Depart
ment's tax division, calls the tax

protest movement "a major,
probably the major, challenge
to the (Internal Revenue) Ser
vice today.
"I think it's manageable —
because the number (ot pro
testers ) is not yet big — by using
the traditional civil and crimi
nal sanctions But you have to
realize that the tax system is
one of sell-assessment. If the
tax movement erodes taxpayer
morale, this could have a ripple
effect."
