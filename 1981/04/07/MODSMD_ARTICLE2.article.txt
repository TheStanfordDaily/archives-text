# Reagan loosens auto safety, emission restraints to help car manufacturers
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Reagan
administration yesterday announced
it is relaxing 34 auto pollution and
safety regulations as part of an aid
package intended to help revive the
nation's ailing auto industry.
The regulatory changes would
save the industry nearly $1.4 billion
over the next five years and save
consumers $9.3 billion, the adminis
tration estimated.
Government officials said the
rules changes, combined with help
contained in President Ronald Rea
gan's economic program, are in
tended to restore domestic job®,
sales, productivity and the in
dustry's financial health.
"The American automobile in
dustry is in serious trouble," Reagan
said in a statement released at the
White House. Administration of
ficials said the industry incurred
"unprecedented losses" last year
and 180,000 auto workers are un
employed.
"The industry must solve its own
problems but the government must
not unnecessarily hamper its efforts
through excessive regulation and in
terference," Reagan said
The major component in the pack
age involves changes in regulations
by the Environmental Protection
Agency and the National Highway

Traffic Safety Administration. The
two agencies today submitted no
tices of their plans to rescind, revise
or re-propose the 34 regulations — 18
of them EPA rules and 16 by NHTSA.
Yesterday's actions represent a
shift away from more than a decade
of increasing auto regulation
sparked by Ralph Nader and other
consumer advocates critical of auto
mobile safety and impact on the en
vironment.
Relaxation of regulations had
been promoted heavily by the Ameri
can auto industry, which last year
lost $4.2 billion.
Among the pollution and safety
regulations being eased or postponed
are:
— A requirement for automatic
passenger restraint systems — air
bags or automatic seat belts — to be
mandatory on large cars beginning
this fall. The administration an
nounced a one-year delay for the rule
to take effect, a move estimated to
save the industry $30 million and
consumers $105 million
— A law requiring all cars and
light trucks by 1984 to meet the
stricter emission standards to be in
effect that y£ar for high-altitude
areas such as Denver. The adminis
tration is proposing an amendment
to the Clean Air Act to eliminate this

requirement, an action estimated to
save the industry $38 million and
consumers $1.3 billion.
— A variety of laws setting future
emission standards tor light and
heavy trucks. These rules would be
relaxed.
— A rule requiring automobile
bumpers to withstand collisions at 5
mph would be eased.
— A rule requiring cars to come
equipped with a warning indicator of
low tire pressure would be
eliminated.
The regulatory changes were pro
posed by the Cabinet-level auto task
force that also is urging Reagan to
seek some form of voluntary reduc
tion in the number of Japanese autos
exported to the United States.
A U.S. trade mission is in Tokyo to
brief Japanese officials on the ad
ministration's plans to revitalize the
U.S. auto industry.
Administration officials said the
changes will relieve the industry of
"unnecessarily stringent" regu
lations "that can be relaxed at little
or no cost to worthwhile regulatory
goals."
The auto industry has long com
plained about regulations it claims
cost them billions of dollars while
driving up the cost of cars and
trucks.
