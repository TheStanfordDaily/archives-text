## Expressionists provide exhibition for the indecisive 
### Denny Dart 
If you like anything that is
New Wave, there are plenty of
paintings in the Expressionist
exhibition which have that air of
revolt against artistic standard
(Polite people call it avant
ijnrdc.) If you are someone who
does not like anything that is
New Wave, there are the in
timate watercolors of Emil
Nolde and Kandinsky's beau
tiful pastel-colored oils. And if
you have a taste for satire, you
must not miss the paintings of
George Grosz. (In one painting,
the middle-class becomes a
middle-aged couple with baggy

stockings. An execution takes
place while two disinterested of
ficers eat dinner in another
painting called "Hunger is the
Best Sauce.'') And if none of this
compels you, you should see the
exhibition anyway, if only be
cause it is free on Thursday
nights.
"Expressionism: A German
Intuition (1905-1920)" pre
miered at the Guggenheim
museum in New York, and will
be at San Francisco's Museum
ot Modern Art until April 26 The
title is appropriately general
because, aside from the fact
that all of the works express

something, there is no one uni
fying theme. While Franz Marc
painted nature, Ludwig
Meidner was preoccupied with
the city. While there are
gestures of political satire,
there are also very personal
statements And while some
paintings are disturbingly pro
found. others are silly or even
incompetent There is some
thing to be said for such diver
sity — the exhibition appeals to
many tastes — but in the end I
found myself wondering just
what it is that "expressionism"
expresses.
The paintings and prints of
the 18 young artists represented
belong to the 15 years before and
including World War I. In my
search for some sort of under
lying theme, I could not help
thinking of the poems of T S.
Eliot, also a young artist in the
years before World War I.
Eliot's "yellow fog'' seems to
oppress two lovers in Mueller's
"Pair of Lovers Between
Garden Walls." Emil Nolde's
painting. "Glass of Wine" could
be a portrait of the lady in
Eliot's "Portrait of a Lady."
And painting after painting is a
visual taste of the world of
Eliot's Prufrock — Erich
Heckel painted balding heads
and smoke-filled rooms, George
Grosz painted city streets at
night, and Emile Nolde painted
"pagan rhythm'' in his "Dance
Around the Golden Calf."
Like T.S. Eliot's poems,
many of the paintings and prints
in the show prophesy doom. The
organizers ot the exhibition un
doubtedly had this mood in mind
when they gave the title "Ex
pressionism A German Intui
tion." One gets an eerie sense
that these pre-war artists some
how anticipated the First World
War. But even if some of the

paintings foreshadow doom and,
in Meidner's "Burning City" of
1913, apocalyptic chaos, this is
not characteristic of all ot the
paintings. Vasily Kandinskv
was obviously oblivious to im
pending disaster; his
"Pastorale" (a painting of cows
quietly grazing*, is delightful
enough to be an ad that reads
"Drink milk for breakfast."
Eliot's poetry goes some way
towards giving the exhibition a
sort ot coherence; a still more
convincing theme, however, is
that expressed by Ernst Ludwig
Kirchner. In a wood engraving
for the group Die Brucke (the
core group of the Expressionist
movement), he wrote. "We
want to wrest freedom for our
gestures and for our lives from
the older, comfortably estab
lished forces." One can easily
view Expressionism as the
younger end of a conflict be
tween generations. The Ex
pressionists rejected the ration
al and graceful style of the Im
pressionists and Post-Im
pressionists, like Matisse and
Gauguin, in exchange for a style
which is almost hysterically
emotional and primitively
crude. If you look at Max Pechs
tein's "Dance" of 1910, and re
member at the same time the
dancers of Degas, you will find
the clumsy club legs and dis
torted faces of Pechstein's dan
cers shocking in contrast.
Satirical, prophetic, re
bellious . . . one can grope and
still not find a word which de
fines "Expressionism." Per
haps "anarchistic" is the only
word which can describe this di
verse collection in which every
painter expresses something
different. In any case, because
"expressionism" is so very di
verse, everyone should be able
to find something interesting.


Paula Modersohn-Becker's "Self-Portrait with Camelia Branch,"
circa 1906-07.


"The Lovesick Man (Der Liebeskranke)," painted in 1916 by George Grosz, is one of the more satiric
paintings currently on display at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
