•John Huston's Let There Be Light, a fine, ter
rible, valuable non-fiction film about psy
choneurotic soldiers, has been forbidden civilian
circulation by the War Department. I don't
know what is necessary to reverse this dis
graceful decision, but if dynamite is required,
then dynamite is indicated.
— James Agee in The Nation, May 1946
When John Huston joined the army in 1943 to make
documentaries, he was 27 years old. He had directed
only three movies in Hollywood, the first of which was
The Maltese Falcon in 1941. He joined the ranks of the
more seasoned Frank Capra, who was working on the
Why We Fight propaganda series, and John Ford, but
only Huston's work during this period is remembered:
Report from the Aleutians, filmed in Alaska in 1943,
and San Pietro (1944), a record of a battle in progress,
which may well be the greatest war documentary ever
filmed.
The third film he completed for the army was shot
back in America, immediately after the return of the
troops, at Mason General Hospital, where psy
choneurotic soldiers were being treated with the inten
tion of readying them for rejoining civilian society. It
was planned as an educational document for the Ameri
can public, so that it might better comprehend the situ
ation of these men emerging from close psychiatric
care and accept them as fully regenerated human
beings. But I.et There Be Light, ready for release in
1946, so unseated the upper echelon military who pre
viewed it that, for a series of bogus reasons, it was pro
hibited from public showing — for 35 years. Only in the
last tew months — largely through the persistence of
Jack Valenti. the president of the Motion Picture As
sociation of America — has the film been freed from
the army vaults and permitted general release.
Seeing Let There Re Light now. one can certainly un

derstand why the military brass was so upset by it. Psy
chological distress had not been treated much on
screen, even in fiction films. Though in William
Wyler's 1946 film, The Best Years of Our Lives a home
coming vet relived the horrors of battle in nightmares,
the histrionics of movies like The Snake Pit were still a
couple of years in the future. And what Huston and his
photographer, the great Stanley Cortez (he had shot Or
son Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons) caught on
film was shocking: men who cried in psychiatric ses
sions, men whose stuttering or paralysis was purely
psychosematic. It is not a heroic vision, though the film
itself is heroic. The lean, eloquent narration (spoken by
Huston's father Walter) is a stark denial of the glorious
returning soldier dream America was so anxious to
swallow: "The guns are quiet now. The papers of peace
have been signed . . . men have dreamed of this mo
ment," rings with quiet irony as we watch the blind and
the physically and emotionally crippled being led oft
the ships. Like the obscene sound of body bags beine
zipped up in San Pietro, this image seems 30 years
ahead of its time.
Let There Be Light runs for only an hour, but it con
tains more sequences that engage us emotionally than
most films we are likely to see. A genteel, well
educated black man cries as he tells a psychiatrist
about receiving a photograph of the woman he loves;
then he apologizes for his tears. A soldier with the eyes
of a frightened deer speaks in whispers of his brother,
killed in battle. One man hides his Purple Heart under
his pocket flap. Another, asked by a doctor if he ever
experienced nervous anxiety before the war. replies,
"No, I was a solid man." These interviews predate the
naked emotion of the documentaries Fred Wiseman
made for PBS in the late '60s and early 70s — pictures
like Hospital and Welfare, in which the vulnerability of
human beings under extraordinary stress is presented
with such unembarrassed directness and simplicity

that the camera seems to burn through the shame we
usually feel when we are contronted with these issues.
The most remarkable scenes in the movie record the
process by which the psychiatrists, using sodium
amitol and hypnosis, delve into the causes of the sol
diers' neuroses and, in the three cases Huston shows us.
restore them to wholeness. A boy who must be carried
in by nurses is made able to walk; he circles the room,
woozy and tentative, as if afraid he might be dreaming.
An amnesiac relives a shell attack he has suppressed
and, in a voice almost too low for us to hear, repeats his
name and the name of his mother; he blinks as he is
brought out of hypnosis, as it the light of memory were
too bright for him. The third patient, we learn, began to
stutter through the association of sibilant sounds with
the hissing of grenades. His speech restored, he cries
over and over, "Oh, God, listen, I can speak!"
Let There He Light is a film commissioned by the
army, a piece of propaganda. Despite the highly per
sonal and explosive nature of what it tells us about the
effects of wars on the men who tight them, it is op
timistic; as far as we know, these men are sent home
cured. We do not see the basket cases, the hopelessly
shattered; we do not see the more violent forms of
treatment reserved for more serious cases. (No one in
the movie even mentions shock therapy.) The psy
chiatrists have a fairy tale benevolence — and a
schoolmarmish stodginess. In other words, what
Huston gives us is a far from complete picture. Still,
the film never claims to deal with more than just the
curables, and on its admittedly narrow terms it is noble
and astonishing. It is also powerful; I saw almost all of
it through tears and couldn't find my voice when I left
the theater. It is fortunate that the liberation of Let
There Be Light has come while its director is still alive
and working; he deserves to hear the applause for his
greatest achievement.

have been signed . . . men have dreamed of this mo
ment," rings with quiet irony as we watch the blind and
the physically and emotionally crippled being led oft
the ships. Like the obscene sound of body bags beine
zipped up in San Pietro, this image seems 30 years
ahead of its time.
Let There Be Light runs for only an hour, but it con
tains more sequences that engage us emotionally than
most films we are likely to see. A genteel, well
educated black man cries as he tells a psychiatrist
about receiving a photograph of the woman he loves;
then he apologizes for his tears. A soldier with the eyes
of a frightened deer speaks in whispers of his brother,
killed in battle. One man hides his Purple Heart under
his pocket flap. Another, asked by a doctor if he ever
experienced nervous anxiety before the war. replies,
"No, I was a solid man." These interviews predate the
naked emotion of the documentaries Fred Wiseman
made for PBS in the late '60s and early 70s — pictures
like Hospital and Welfare, in which the vulnerability of
human beings under extraordinary stress is presented
with such unembarrassed directness and simplicity

that the camera seems to burn through the shame we
usually feel when we are contronted with these issues.
The most remarkable scenes in the movie record the
process by which the psychiatrists, using sodium
amitol and hypnosis, delve into the causes of the sol
diers' neuroses and, in the three cases Huston shows us.
restore them to wholeness. A boy who must be carried
in by nurses is made able to walk; he circles the room,
woozy and tentative, as if afraid he might be dreaming.
An amnesiac relives a shell attack he has suppressed
and, in a voice almost too low for us to hear, repeats his
name and the name of his mother; he blinks as he is
brought out of hypnosis, as it the light of memory were
too bright for him. The third patient, we learn, began to
stutter through the association of sibilant sounds with
the hissing of grenades. His speech restored, he cries
over and over, "Oh, God, listen, I can speak!"
Let There He Light is a film commissioned by the
army, a piece of propaganda. Despite the highly per
sonal and explosive nature of what it tells us about the
effects of wars on the men who tight them, it is op
timistic; as far as we know, these men are sent home
cured. We do not see the basket cases, the hopelessly
shattered; we do not see the more violent forms of
treatment reserved for more serious cases. (No one in
the movie even mentions shock therapy.) The psy
chiatrists have a fairy tale benevolence — and a
schoolmarmish stodginess. In other words, what
Huston gives us is a far from complete picture. Still,
the film never claims to deal with more than just the
curables, and on its admittedly narrow terms it is noble
and astonishing. It is also powerful; I saw almost all of
it through tears and couldn't find my voice when I left
the theater. It is fortunate that the liberation of Let
There Be Light has come while its director is still alive
and working; he deserves to hear the applause for his
greatest achievement.
•John Huston's Let There Be Light, a fine, ter
rible, valuable non-fiction film about psy
choneurotic soldiers, has been forbidden civilian
circulation by the War Department. I don't

graceful decision, but if dynamite is required,
then dynamite is indicated.

When John Huston joined the army in 1943 to make
documentaries, he was 27 years old. He had directed
only three movies in Hollywood, the first of which was
The Maltese Falcon in 1941. He joined the ranks of the
more seasoned Frank Capra, who was working on the
Why We Fight propaganda series, and John Ford, but
only Huston's work during this period is remembered:
Report from the Aleutians, filmed in Alaska in 1943,
and San Pietro (1944), a record of a battle in progress,
which may well be the greatest war documentary ever
filmed.
The third film he completed for the army was shot
back in America, immediately after the return of the
troops, at Mason General Hospital, where psy
choneurotic soldiers were being treated with the inten
tion of readying them for rejoining civilian society. It
was planned as an educational document for the Ameri
can public, so that it might better comprehend the situ
ation of these men emerging from close psychiatric
care and accept them as fully regenerated human
beings. But I.et There Be Light, ready for release in
1946, so unseated the upper echelon military who pre
viewed it that, for a series of bogus reasons, it was pro
hibited from public showing — for 35 years. Only in the
last tew months — largely through the persistence of
Jack Valenti. the president of the Motion Picture As
sociation of America — has the film been freed from
the army vaults and permitted general release.
Seeing Let There Re Light now. one can certainly un

derstand why the military brass was so upset by it. Psy
chological distress had not been treated much on
screen, even in fiction films. Though in William
Wyler's 1946 film, The Best Years of Our Lives a home
coming vet relived the horrors of battle in nightmares,
the histrionics of movies like The Snake Pit were still a
couple of years in the future. And what Huston and his
photographer, the great Stanley Cortez (he had shot Or
son Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons) caught on
film was shocking: men who cried in psychiatric ses
sions, men whose stuttering or paralysis was purely
psychosematic. It is not a heroic vision, though the film
itself is heroic. The lean, eloquent narration (spoken by
Huston's father Walter) is a stark denial of the glorious
returning soldier dream America was so anxious to
swallow: "The guns are quiet now. The papers of peace
have been signed . . . men have dreamed of this mo
ment," rings with quiet irony as we watch the blind and
