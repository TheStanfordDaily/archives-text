# 'Thief' is a pulp triumph

### Steve Vineberg 
Film sense is the ability to fit
the jigsaw puzzle pieces of a
scene together so that their se
quence seems inevitable, to
pace so adroitly that no scene
seems inevitable, to pace so
adroitly that no scene seems a
second too long or too short, to
place the camera in the
shrewdest place in every shot. It
is more of an instinct than a
skill. Steven Spielberg has it,
and Walter Hill and Sam
Peckinpah; so does Michael
Mann, who is making his com
mercial film debut with Thief.
Like Spielberg and Peckinpah,
Mann is a refugee from tele
vision (he directed the TV mov
ie The ■Jericho Mile), and like
Hill, he has a feeling for lonely
milieux and a juicy, trashy
energy. '\'hief is a terrific pulp
movie — the most exciting since
The Warriors. It is so fiercely
kinetic (like the score that
Tangerine Dream performs be
hind it) and so unerringly deft
that it seems to have been as
sembled unconsciously.
Mann wrote the script
himself, adapting a book by
Frank Hohimer called The
Home Invaders: and he also
served as his own executive pro
ducer, and has surrounded
himself with talented people
whose names were as un
familiar to me as his. The
crackerjack editing in the neon
lit night scenes has some of the
same hallucinatory quality
Richard Kline created for Brian
De Palma in The Fury and An
drew Laszlo found for Walter
Hill in The Warriors. A car's
headlights flash on suddenly and
so illuminate the rain that they

appear to have turned it on with
a magic switch; the reflection
of hundreds of bulbs dances
across the hoods of cars in a lot.
The action sequences in particu
lar are such a harmonious blend
of direction, photography and
editing that they feel like the
work of one prodigious man
rather than three. This movie
has two of the most exciting —
and most instructive — heist
scenes I've ever encountered; if
Mann's career as a director
ever falters, he could make it as
a safecracker.
Besides James Caan, Tues
day Weld and Willie Nelson (in a
small part with one good scene),
the cast of Thief includes a lot of
unknown actors. Some of them
— especially Robert Prosky as a
creepy underworld czar and
John Santucci as a crooked cop
(his performance is remi
niscent of Allen Garfield in
some of his greasy roles) — are
very good. But the picture
belongs to Caan. Caan is one of
the most talented actors in
American movies, but few of his
performances have displayed
that talent, and his reputation
isn't as strong as it used to be.
Perhaps this is because he
doesn't have a knack for keeping
a low profile when stuck with
bad material; he telegraphs his
discomfort. In Chapter Two, he
was straitjacketed by the dumb
one-liners and suffocating, self
congratulatory sentimentality;
a mediocre performer, Marsha
Mason, actually came off look
ing better because she seemed
blissfully unaware of how ter
rible the picture was. Early in
his career, Caan created so
much good will with his

portrayal of Sonny Corleone in
The Godfather that he became
an immediate audience favor
ite ; but he hasn't had a hit since
Last year, he contributed a
warm, tight portrait of an or
dinary Joe from New Jersey in a
small, satisfying movie entitled
Hide In Plain Sight. Caan
himself directed the film; un
fortunately it obeyed the dic
tates of its title and nobody went
to see it.
The irony of Caan's failure to
achieve the status he deserves is
that he has an uncanny gift for
playing instantly recognizable,
earthy men whom all of us can
relate to. In Thief, his best work
to date, he plays Frank, a
diamond burglar who prides
himself on his expertise and his
independence; he speaks
straight and rejects the efforts
of other men to claim ownership
of his services. (The inevitable
conflict arises when he allows
himself to be seduced into a sub
servient position and has to
fight his way out of it.) But he
dreams of a "normal" lifestyle
— a home and family — and in
his obsessive, methodical way
constructs a plan and ask the
woman he has picked out, Jessie
(Weld) to fit into it. (One of the
irreconcilable problems with
the movie is that we don't be
lieve that she would allow
herself to be so easily manipu
lated in and out of his master
scheme.) Frank was raised by
the state and served time; his
only true parental model was
the man who taught him how to
crack a safe, Okla (Nelson).
Caan shows us Frank's need for
emotional order in his life as
well as his ability to freeze it out
in the wake of danger.
The movie is a set-up of the
most transparent kind. When
Frank and Jessie apply to adopt
kids, his record prevents them
from even being considered,
Mann paints the woman at the
state agency as elitist, narrow
minded and stupid, and Caan de
livers, movingly, a tirade about
the horrors of being brought up
without loving parents. But if
we thought about it, we might
question the wisdom of giving
children to be raised by a man
who is — an active thief. Caan's
Frank is so appealing that we
cheer him when he insults the
cops who want a piece of his
takfe — as if his form of crime
were somehow purer than theirs
— and applaud the absurd urban
western finish. Thief is junk,
but it's highly charged and beau
tifully made.
