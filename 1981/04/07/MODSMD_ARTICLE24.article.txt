# Good and Friends defy gravity
## 
### Bruce Handy 
Personally I think this music
is usually stupid — Larry Good
There's no way Trying tn
Reach the (1 round should work:
Larry Good and his "Friends"
from The Claude Monet Band
(Good's own group), Rooftop
Magic, the Sparkletones, and
seemingly all the rest of Stan
ford's bands, musicians, artists,
and funky creative types get to
gether in what the liner notes
from this album would lead one
to believe was a continuous cir
cle jerk of love and in-jokes and
maybe even a few tunes. This
should be a solipsistic mess with
the whole gang trying to get
their licks in, innumerable
chops in search of melodies in
search of songs.
But fortunately, despite the
misleading packaging, Good
somehow managed to keep it all
under control, producing in the
process a fin, listenable album.
Trying to Reach the Ground
is actually Good's project from
start to finish: he wrote it, per
formed most of it, produced it,
got the thing manufactured on
his own label, and has done a
large part of the salesmanship
himself — disproving the
diehard notion that all salesman
are dullards (Econ majors take
heart). While never descending
to the flacid schlockiness of the
work of James Taylor or Jesse
Collin Young, Good's songs can
aptly be described as
"mellow." But he maintains a
complexity and an energy that
keeps even the most decibal

happy fans listening And, al
though the album is remarkably
slick for an amateur under
taking, there's a rawness in the
production that stops it from
disappearing into the bland
world of the Easy Listening
The two most successful
songs, "Breakfast of Blues"
and the title cut, are also the
least ambitious, straight ahead
tunes where the performances
have been integrated well with
the writing. "Trying to Reach
the Ground" is a pretty folk
number, recorded sparingly,
mostly relying on a single
acoustic guitar to carry its
weight — but with a few punchy
accordion licks to keep it mov
ing. "Breakfast of Blues," con
taining Good's best vocal and a
cool scat by Marty Rapkin, is
jazzier, a bit reminiscent of
Michael Franks, and the kind of
song that elicits, even demands,
relaxation. Elsewhere Good
sometimes tries too hard, over
scoring at times, pushing a song
past its appropriate bedtime
(especially in the case of the
otherwise excellent "Boss
Man") and, most annoyingly.
throwing in a melodramatic
touch where restraint would
have been more powerful —
note the hammering piano in
"Don't Come By." The guest vo
cals by Missy Peabody and
Leslie Moulton are — no sur
prise — superb, although
Peabody's song, "Every Man
for Himself Every Woman on
Her Own," begs for a rave-up in
stead of the ambling, bluesy

back-up that Good and his
cohorts provide.
Yet despite its communal
aspects, despite the ecclec
ticism of Good's writing — de
spite the awful "Steel Band"
with its pseudo-Rasta vocals —
this album works as a whole.
Good is not the best lyricist
around (and this reviewer could
have done without the insert lyr
ic sheet with its insipid "Thanks
to ... " messages) but he
writes a catchy tune — some
times a beautiful tune — and he

knows how to get it all down on
vinyl — again surprising for a
first time enterprise. Whether
or not he's truly trying to touch
the ground, a somewhat ques
tionable undertaking, Good
thankfully stays above it.
(The Claude Monet Band
will be appearing with Rooftop
Magic at the Keystone Palo
Alto tomorrow night. Mersey's
Cadillac will open the H p.m.
show. 'Tickets are $1.49 at the
door.)
