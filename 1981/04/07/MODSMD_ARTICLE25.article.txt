# Philodendron plays lead in new comedy
## 
### Stephen Nash 
George Orwell once wrote an amusing lit
tle novel centered around an aspidistra.
Now, Rick Foster has given free rein to a
philodendron in an amusing little play at
Fort Mason.
Fat's in the Fire, an August Moon produc
tion at the Actor s Ark Theater, is a rather
dark comedy which manages to lampoon
pretty much every cliche about motherly
domination and masculine identity. Lewis
and Louise, a liberated Scandinavian
modern couple, are working their way
toward LA nirvana via jogging and avocado
dip (made, of course, with yogurt in place of
sour cream). They are, that is, until Lewis's
300-pound mother Alma shows up.
Alma hasn't seen her son in 10 years, and
she wants to reestablish their relationship
— and her control over her son's life. Her ef
forts start with a few spits to revive the
philodendron, but before long there are
chickens laying high-cholesterol eggs in the

living room. Pretty soon, Lewis is very
much a little boy again, and Alma and Lou
ise are busy creating their own feminist
back-to-the-land movement.
The fourth character in this California
fantasy is Burk, a wealthy prospector and
one of Lewis's clients. He lives in Utah with
his six wives and 19 children (he's not
Mormon, but he's found that they are pretty
sympathetic to his ideas about marriage)
and he has a hot Fridav-night affair going
with Alma.
August Moon Productions is a recently
formed company which is especially in
terested in new local plays dealing with con
temporary problems. This play is an ap
propriate choice, then, since Rick Foster is
a local writer who has been active in Bay
Area theater for a number of years. His Ref
ormation-era play -Justice was performed
recently at the Julian Theatre (reviewed
here March 11).
Fats in the Fire, once it gets going, just

bounces right along. It's got a lot of verve,
and some very witty writing There are also
striking nostalgic monologues, reminiscent
of Sam Shepard. But, like Justice, the first
act tends to drag. There is little action in the
beginning and a fair amount of repetition.
Deleting the initial speeches of the first act
might get the momentum going faster.
(Since audiences will put up with contusion
for several minutes at the beginning of a
play, this would cause little damage to the
story.)
Ron Blair (as Burk) is a lot of tun to see in
his role as the cowboy polygamist, as is
Priscilla Alden as Alma. John Paul (as Lew
is) and Kasey Arnold-Ince (as Louise) are
good in the early part of the play, but when
the anarchy sets in, they are less successful
at transforming their roles into caricatures.
The direction (by Karl Rawicz) keeps the
show moving along. Everything else may
get metaphorically strangled by the
philodendron, but the comedy keeps coming
through.
