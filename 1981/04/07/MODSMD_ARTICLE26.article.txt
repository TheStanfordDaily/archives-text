mittee. unveiling the package at a news conference, said it
would produce a balanced budget in the 1983 fiscal year, a
year earlier than the administration's own target

urges in order to swiftly pass this budget."

relief in fiscal 1982 had the approval of Rep Daniel

ure in Reagan's budget proposal is more than $54 billion

mous. Rep. Phil Gramm, one of 44 members of a group of
conservative House Democrats, said the changes Jones
had made in the Reagan proposals were "a transformation
I do not support."

Jones presented, " I will oppose it."

191 Republicans.
Reagan cautions Soviets on Poland
Washington— President Ronald Reagan sent Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev a message concerning the
Polish crisis last Friday, administration officials said
Sunday. The message reportedly cautioned against a Sovi
et intervention in strike-torn Poland.
White House spokesman Robert Woolsey confirmed
that Reagan had sent a message to Brezhnev, but refused
to describe it. Administration sources, who asked not to be
named, confirmed that the message did deal with the
Polish-Soviet question, although they declined to be more
specific.
NBC news reported Sunday that the message warned
against a Soviet military intervention in Poland. NBC said
the message cautioned of long and wide-ranging conse
quences. The message was said to be the first from Rea
gan to Brezhnev devoted to the Polish crisis.
Tight-lipped administration officials spent Sunday
keeping a close watch on the Warsaw Pact maneuvers in
and around Poland, and U.N. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick warned that a Soviet intervention "would pro
foundly upset" U.S.-Soviet relations.
Weinberger noted that Brezhnev's appearance at a
Communist Party congress in Prague "shows the seri
ousness ot the situation" in Poland. But he said it was good
the Soviet Union was consulting with other Warsaw Pact
nations.
Vice President George Bush brieted the hospitalized
president on the world situation Bush told reporters out
side the hospital that Reagan "is fully on top ot the situ
ation. That's the main point I want to make. It's not useful
to go into any more detail."

USSR ups military flights to Poland
Washington— The Soviet Union has begun flying a
number of military transport planes into Poland, deep
ening concern among American officials that Moscow is
close to a critical decision on whether to intervene directly
in Poland's continuing turmoil, intelligence officials dis
closed.
"We're not sure what's in them, how much is in them,
and what it means, but there is no assessment that this is a
prelude to an invasion," one senior official said
The planes were being flown to airfields on existing So
viet military bases inside Poland, analysts said The Sovi
et Union has long maintained two divisions inside Poland
Several senior officials said there was no evidence that
Soviet divisions that have been poised near the Polish
border for several months were moving into Poland.
But the flights ot the aircraft into Poland, coupled with
intelligence data showing that the Soviets, according to
one official, have 12 to 15 divisions ready to move into Po
land "at a moment's notice," clearly increased American
concern over the situation in Eastern Europe and brought
forth fresh warnings about the grave consequences of a So
viet invasion.
The heightened level of American concern was reflected
in a State Dept. statement, read to reporters by spokes
man William Dyess, that for the first time since last De
cember openly suggested that an invasion could take place
at any moment.
One worrisome sign was hard evidence that the Kremlin
had recently activated some Soviet reservists, possibly to
replace Warsaw Pact torces that might be sympathetic to
the independent labor movement in Poland, according to
intelligence analysts.
Cities sue over Medfly spraying plan
San Francisco — A government plan to spray up to 80
tons of the pesticide Malathion over fruit fly-infested San
ta Clara County has prompted the county and five of its
cities to seek a court order to stop the program
In a lawsuit filed in federal court yesterday, the county,
along with the cities of Los Gatos. Palo Alto, Sunnyvale,
Mountain View and Saratoga and Citizens for a Better En
vironment argued that the spraying program will have a
"significant detrimental effect on the human and natural
environment."
A multi-million dollar federal and state effort to
eradicate the Medfly has been in progress since June. Pub
lic pressure forced the eradication task force to abandon
earlier plans to use aerial spraying, and most efforts have
involved hand-stripping of trees and ground spraying.
The suit asks that the defendants be ordered to prepare
an environmental impact statement, use "less danger
ous" alternatives to aerial spraying and hold hearings to
brief residents on the affect of spraying.
The suit also urges the spraying be halted until an im
pact statement is prepared or the defendants provide
proof that a sufficient emergency exists to warrant ex
emption from federal and state environmental laws
Haig sees war possible in Middle East
Amman, Jordan — Secretary of State Alexander Haig
yestefday condemned Syrian attacks on Christian
enclaves in Lebanon and said "most serious" conse
quences would result if the attacks continue.
"Great pressure" is building within Israel for Israeli in
tervention in the fighting on the side ot the Lebanese Chris
tians. said a member-of the Haig party, which flew here

from Israel on the third leg of a four-nation Middle East
tour
"We are right on the brink, in my judgment, of a major
outbreak of hostilities." he said.
Before flying here for a meeting with Jordan's King
Hussein. Haig told reporters in Jerusalem, "The conse
quences of a failure of a return to a cease-fire are most,
most serious."
He said the United States viewed the Syrian action "as a
very serious turn of events which is unacceptable by any
measure of appropriate international standards of con
duct."
Asked whether the Soviet Union might be inspiring Syr
ian actions in Lebanon to divert attention from Poland's
labor unrest and the possibility of Soviet military interven
tion, Haig said that could be part of the answer.
He added that his own trip to the Middle East may also
be a cause.
"You cannot discount my presence here." Haig told re
porters shortly before his departure for Jordan. "You can
not discount a number of converging factors which could
contribute to what is a very unacceptable turn of events in
Lebanon." He would not elaborate.
Smith arrest record revealed in trial
Los Angeles— A federal prosecutor dropped a
bombshell yesterday, revealing in court that boxing pro
moter Harold Smith is really a man named Ross Fields de
scribed as "a fugitive bad check and bunco artist" with an
arrest record dating back to the 19605.
The revelation was a bizarre new twist in the case ot
Smith, the colorful boxing figure who had been named as a
key suspect in a $21.3 million fraud suit by Wells Fargo
Bank.
"We have established without a question that Ross
Fields is a longtime fugitive, a bad checks and bunco artist
wanted in at least three jurisdictions," declared Asst. U.S.
Attorney Dean Allison.
Smith himself arose in the packed courtroom where he
was arraigned on a charge of falsifying a passport and de
clared, "My true name is Ross Fields."
He burst into tears and said he hoped that the friends
who had come to support him as Harold Smith also would
stand behind him with his true identity.
"Your honor, I could have been long gone," Smith told
U.S. Magistrate Venetta Tasasopulous, explaining he had
not fled even though he knew he might be arrested.
The magistrate made her bail ruling after Allison also
presented documents from North Carolina showing that

Smith is a fugitive in a case thereon charges of forgery and
false pretenses — offenses allegedly committed in 1975
Smith's attorneys. Robert Michaels and Jennifer King,
appeared surprised by some of the facts in the government
affidavits that were unsealed for the first time at the hear
ing.
Low scores to reduce HS grads
Sacramento — June 1981 will be "the moment of truth"
when nearly a quarter of California's 316,268 high school
seniors may not graduate because of failing scores on new
proficiency tests or because they don't have required
course credits, state schools superintendent Wilson Riles
said yesterday.
Riles, announcing the results of a surve> completed in
December 1980, told a press conference that as many as 12
percent of the state's high school seniors may fqil one or
more of the three required examinations.
Another 8 percent, he added, have not met course re
quirements and have also failed at least one of the tests,
while still another 4 percent have passed the tests but
tailed to get needed course credits.
The results, he said, "starkly highlight" the need to
direct "more emphasis, effort and resources" to the
state's public high schools.
At the same time. Riles said the test failure rate could
be reduced — "to perhaps 5 percent tor those tailing (to
graduate) because of the tests alone" — before June
through intensive instruction and retesting
"Everyone had a three-year warning that this was com
ing," Riles said, but "many of the schools hadn't taken it
very seriously."
Riles' report was based on a survey of 85 of the state's
377 school districts, involving about nearly 81,000 students.

Democrats offer budget proposal
Washington— House Democrats unveiled their long
awaited alternative to President Ronald Reagan's eco
nomic package yesterday, calling for a sharply smaller
budget deficit in 1982. a smaller tax cut. less spending for
defense and more for social programs
It calls for overall spending cuts roughly $4 billion
deeper than Reagan recommended, but not the three-year,
across-the board tax cut of 30 percent that is the center
piece of the administration's economic recovery program
Rep James Jones, chairman of the House Budget Com
mittee. unveiling the package at a news conference, said it
would produce a balanced budget in the 1983 fiscal year, a
year earlier than the administration's own target
"This is a budget which meets the needs of America."
he said, calling on Republicans to "put aside partisan
urges in order to swiftly pass this budget."
As further evidence of a Democratic consensus. Jones
told reporters the $35 billion he left in the budget tor tax
relief in fiscal 1982 had the approval of Rep Daniel
Rostenkowski. (D-Ill.), chairman of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee The comparable tax-cut fig
ure in Reagan's budget proposal is more than $54 billion
Democratic support tor the package was not unani
mous. Rep. Phil Gramm, one of 44 members of a group of
conservative House Democrats, said the changes Jones
had made in the Reagan proposals were "a transformation
I do not support."
Gramm. a member of the Budget Committee, said if the
panel does not make significant changes in the package
Jones presented, " I will oppose it."
He said, however, he could not speak for the other con
servative Democrats, whose support could be critical in
light ot the current House division of 242 Democrats and
191 Republicans.
Reagan cautions Soviets on Poland
Washington— President Ronald Reagan sent Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev a message concerning the
Polish crisis last Friday, administration officials said
Sunday. The message reportedly cautioned against a Sovi
et intervention in strike-torn Poland.
White House spokesman Robert Woolsey confirmed
that Reagan had sent a message to Brezhnev, but refused
to describe it. Administration sources, who asked not to be
named, confirmed that the message did deal with the
Polish-Soviet question, although they declined to be more
specific.
NBC news reported Sunday that the message warned
against a Soviet military intervention in Poland. NBC said
the message cautioned of long and wide-ranging conse
quences. The message was said to be the first from Rea
gan to Brezhnev devoted to the Polish crisis.
Tight-lipped administration officials spent Sunday
keeping a close watch on the Warsaw Pact maneuvers in
and around Poland, and U.N. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick warned that a Soviet intervention "would pro
foundly upset" U.S.-Soviet relations.
Weinberger noted that Brezhnev's appearance at a
Communist Party congress in Prague "shows the seri
ousness ot the situation" in Poland. But he said it was good
the Soviet Union was consulting with other Warsaw Pact
nations.
Vice President George Bush brieted the hospitalized
president on the world situation Bush told reporters out
side the hospital that Reagan "is fully on top ot the situ
ation. That's the main point I want to make. It's not useful
to go into any more detail."

USSR ups military flights to Poland
Washington— The Soviet Union has begun flying a
number of military transport planes into Poland, deep
ening concern among American officials that Moscow is
close to a critical decision on whether to intervene directly
in Poland's continuing turmoil, intelligence officials dis
closed.
"We're not sure what's in them, how much is in them,
and what it means, but there is no assessment that this is a
prelude to an invasion," one senior official said
The planes were being flown to airfields on existing So
viet military bases inside Poland, analysts said The Sovi
et Union has long maintained two divisions inside Poland
Several senior officials said there was no evidence that
Soviet divisions that have been poised near the Polish
border for several months were moving into Poland.
But the flights ot the aircraft into Poland, coupled with
intelligence data showing that the Soviets, according to
one official, have 12 to 15 divisions ready to move into Po
land "at a moment's notice," clearly increased American
concern over the situation in Eastern Europe and brought
forth fresh warnings about the grave consequences of a So
viet invasion.
The heightened level of American concern was reflected
in a State Dept. statement, read to reporters by spokes
man William Dyess, that for the first time since last De
cember openly suggested that an invasion could take place
at any moment.
One worrisome sign was hard evidence that the Kremlin
had recently activated some Soviet reservists, possibly to
replace Warsaw Pact torces that might be sympathetic to
the independent labor movement in Poland, according to
intelligence analysts.
Cities sue over Medfly spraying plan
San Francisco — A government plan to spray up to 80
tons of the pesticide Malathion over fruit fly-infested San
ta Clara County has prompted the county and five of its
cities to seek a court order to stop the program
In a lawsuit filed in federal court yesterday, the county,
along with the cities of Los Gatos. Palo Alto, Sunnyvale,
Mountain View and Saratoga and Citizens for a Better En
vironment argued that the spraying program will have a
"significant detrimental effect on the human and natural
environment."
A multi-million dollar federal and state effort to
eradicate the Medfly has been in progress since June. Pub
lic pressure forced the eradication task force to abandon
earlier plans to use aerial spraying, and most efforts have
involved hand-stripping of trees and ground spraying.
The suit asks that the defendants be ordered to prepare
an environmental impact statement, use "less danger
ous" alternatives to aerial spraying and hold hearings to
brief residents on the affect of spraying.
The suit also urges the spraying be halted until an im
pact statement is prepared or the defendants provide
proof that a sufficient emergency exists to warrant ex
emption from federal and state environmental laws
Haig sees war possible in Middle East
Amman, Jordan — Secretary of State Alexander Haig
yestefday condemned Syrian attacks on Christian
enclaves in Lebanon and said "most serious" conse
quences would result if the attacks continue.
"Great pressure" is building within Israel for Israeli in
tervention in the fighting on the side ot the Lebanese Chris
tians. said a member-of the Haig party, which flew here

from Israel on the third leg of a four-nation Middle East
tour
"We are right on the brink, in my judgment, of a major
outbreak of hostilities." he said.
Before flying here for a meeting with Jordan's King
Hussein. Haig told reporters in Jerusalem, "The conse
quences of a failure of a return to a cease-fire are most,
most serious."
He said the United States viewed the Syrian action "as a
very serious turn of events which is unacceptable by any
measure of appropriate international standards of con
duct."
Asked whether the Soviet Union might be inspiring Syr
ian actions in Lebanon to divert attention from Poland's
labor unrest and the possibility of Soviet military interven
tion, Haig said that could be part of the answer.
He added that his own trip to the Middle East may also
be a cause.
"You cannot discount my presence here." Haig told re
porters shortly before his departure for Jordan. "You can
not discount a number of converging factors which could
contribute to what is a very unacceptable turn of events in
Lebanon." He would not elaborate.
Smith arrest record revealed in trial
Los Angeles— A federal prosecutor dropped a
bombshell yesterday, revealing in court that boxing pro
moter Harold Smith is really a man named Ross Fields de
scribed as "a fugitive bad check and bunco artist" with an
arrest record dating back to the 19605.
The revelation was a bizarre new twist in the case ot
Smith, the colorful boxing figure who had been named as a
key suspect in a $21.3 million fraud suit by Wells Fargo
Bank.
"We have established without a question that Ross
Fields is a longtime fugitive, a bad checks and bunco artist
wanted in at least three jurisdictions," declared Asst. U.S.
Attorney Dean Allison.
Smith himself arose in the packed courtroom where he
was arraigned on a charge of falsifying a passport and de
clared, "My true name is Ross Fields."
He burst into tears and said he hoped that the friends
who had come to support him as Harold Smith also would
stand behind him with his true identity.
"Your honor, I could have been long gone," Smith told
U.S. Magistrate Venetta Tasasopulous, explaining he had
not fled even though he knew he might be arrested.
The magistrate made her bail ruling after Allison also
presented documents from North Carolina showing that

Smith is a fugitive in a case thereon charges of forgery and
false pretenses — offenses allegedly committed in 1975
Smith's attorneys. Robert Michaels and Jennifer King,
appeared surprised by some of the facts in the government
affidavits that were unsealed for the first time at the hear
ing.
Low scores to reduce HS grads
Sacramento — June 1981 will be "the moment of truth"
when nearly a quarter of California's 316,268 high school
seniors may not graduate because of failing scores on new
proficiency tests or because they don't have required
course credits, state schools superintendent Wilson Riles
said yesterday.
Riles, announcing the results of a surve> completed in
December 1980, told a press conference that as many as 12
percent of the state's high school seniors may fqil one or
more of the three required examinations.
Another 8 percent, he added, have not met course re
quirements and have also failed at least one of the tests,
while still another 4 percent have passed the tests but
tailed to get needed course credits.
The results, he said, "starkly highlight" the need to
direct "more emphasis, effort and resources" to the
state's public high schools.
At the same time. Riles said the test failure rate could
be reduced — "to perhaps 5 percent tor those tailing (to
graduate) because of the tests alone" — before June
through intensive instruction and retesting
"Everyone had a three-year warning that this was com
ing," Riles said, but "many of the schools hadn't taken it
very seriously."
Riles' report was based on a survey of 85 of the state's
377 school districts, involving about nearly 81,000 students.

Democrats offer budget proposal
Washington— House Democrats unveiled their long
awaited alternative to President Ronald Reagan's eco
nomic package yesterday, calling for a sharply smaller
budget deficit in 1982. a smaller tax cut. less spending for
defense and more for social programs
It calls for overall spending cuts roughly $4 billion
deeper than Reagan recommended, but not the three-year,
across-the board tax cut of 30 percent that is the center
piece of the administration's economic recovery program
Rep James Jones, chairman of the House Budget Com
mittee. unveiling the package at a news conference, said it
would produce a balanced budget in the 1983 fiscal year, a
year earlier than the administration's own target
"This is a budget which meets the needs of America."
he said, calling on Republicans to "put aside partisan
urges in order to swiftly pass this budget."
As further evidence of a Democratic consensus. Jones
told reporters the $35 billion he left in the budget tor tax
relief in fiscal 1982 had the approval of Rep Daniel
Rostenkowski. (D-Ill.), chairman of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee The comparable tax-cut fig
ure in Reagan's budget proposal is more than $54 billion
Democratic support tor the package was not unani
mous. Rep. Phil Gramm, one of 44 members of a group of
conservative House Democrats, said the changes Jones
had made in the Reagan proposals were "a transformation
I do not support."
Gramm. a member of the Budget Committee, said if the
panel does not make significant changes in the package
Jones presented, " I will oppose it."
He said, however, he could not speak for the other con
servative Democrats, whose support could be critical in
light ot the current House division of 242 Democrats and
191 Republicans.
Reagan cautions Soviets on Poland
Washington— President Ronald Reagan sent Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev a message concerning the
Polish crisis last Friday, administration officials said
Sunday. The message reportedly cautioned against a Sovi
et intervention in strike-torn Poland.
White House spokesman Robert Woolsey confirmed
that Reagan had sent a message to Brezhnev, but refused
to describe it. Administration sources, who asked not to be
named, confirmed that the message did deal with the
Polish-Soviet question, although they declined to be more
specific.
NBC news reported Sunday that the message warned
against a Soviet military intervention in Poland. NBC said
the message cautioned of long and wide-ranging conse
quences. The message was said to be the first from Rea
gan to Brezhnev devoted to the Polish crisis.
Tight-lipped administration officials spent Sunday
keeping a close watch on the Warsaw Pact maneuvers in
and around Poland, and U.N. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick warned that a Soviet intervention "would pro
foundly upset" U.S.-Soviet relations.
Weinberger noted that Brezhnev's appearance at a
Communist Party congress in Prague "shows the seri
ousness ot the situation" in Poland. But he said it was good
the Soviet Union was consulting with other Warsaw Pact
nations.
Vice President George Bush brieted the hospitalized
president on the world situation Bush told reporters out
side the hospital that Reagan "is fully on top ot the situ
ation. That's the main point I want to make. It's not useful
to go into any more detail."

USSR ups military flights to Poland
Washington— The Soviet Union has begun flying a
number of military transport planes into Poland, deep
ening concern among American officials that Moscow is
close to a critical decision on whether to intervene directly
in Poland's continuing turmoil, intelligence officials dis
closed.
"We're not sure what's in them, how much is in them,
and what it means, but there is no assessment that this is a
prelude to an invasion," one senior official said
The planes were being flown to airfields on existing So
viet military bases inside Poland, analysts said The Sovi
et Union has long maintained two divisions inside Poland
Several senior officials said there was no evidence that
Soviet divisions that have been poised near the Polish
border for several months were moving into Poland.
But the flights ot the aircraft into Poland, coupled with
intelligence data showing that the Soviets, according to
one official, have 12 to 15 divisions ready to move into Po
land "at a moment's notice," clearly increased American
concern over the situation in Eastern Europe and brought
forth fresh warnings about the grave consequences of a So
viet invasion.
The heightened level of American concern was reflected
in a State Dept. statement, read to reporters by spokes
man William Dyess, that for the first time since last De
cember openly suggested that an invasion could take place
at any moment.
One worrisome sign was hard evidence that the Kremlin
had recently activated some Soviet reservists, possibly to
replace Warsaw Pact torces that might be sympathetic to
the independent labor movement in Poland, according to
intelligence analysts.
Cities sue over Medfly spraying plan
San Francisco — A government plan to spray up to 80
tons of the pesticide Malathion over fruit fly-infested San
ta Clara County has prompted the county and five of its
cities to seek a court order to stop the program
In a lawsuit filed in federal court yesterday, the county,
along with the cities of Los Gatos. Palo Alto, Sunnyvale,
Mountain View and Saratoga and Citizens for a Better En
vironment argued that the spraying program will have a
"significant detrimental effect on the human and natural
environment."
A multi-million dollar federal and state effort to
eradicate the Medfly has been in progress since June. Pub
lic pressure forced the eradication task force to abandon
earlier plans to use aerial spraying, and most efforts have
involved hand-stripping of trees and ground spraying.
The suit asks that the defendants be ordered to prepare
an environmental impact statement, use "less danger
ous" alternatives to aerial spraying and hold hearings to
brief residents on the affect of spraying.
The suit also urges the spraying be halted until an im
pact statement is prepared or the defendants provide
proof that a sufficient emergency exists to warrant ex
emption from federal and state environmental laws
Haig sees war possible in Middle East
Amman, Jordan — Secretary of State Alexander Haig
yestefday condemned Syrian attacks on Christian
enclaves in Lebanon and said "most serious" conse
quences would result if the attacks continue.
"Great pressure" is building within Israel for Israeli in
tervention in the fighting on the side ot the Lebanese Chris
tians. said a member-of the Haig party, which flew here

from Israel on the third leg of a four-nation Middle East
tour
"We are right on the brink, in my judgment, of a major
outbreak of hostilities." he said.
Before flying here for a meeting with Jordan's King
Hussein. Haig told reporters in Jerusalem, "The conse
quences of a failure of a return to a cease-fire are most,
most serious."
He said the United States viewed the Syrian action "as a
very serious turn of events which is unacceptable by any
measure of appropriate international standards of con
duct."
Asked whether the Soviet Union might be inspiring Syr
ian actions in Lebanon to divert attention from Poland's
labor unrest and the possibility of Soviet military interven
tion, Haig said that could be part of the answer.
He added that his own trip to the Middle East may also
be a cause.
"You cannot discount my presence here." Haig told re
porters shortly before his departure for Jordan. "You can
not discount a number of converging factors which could
contribute to what is a very unacceptable turn of events in
Lebanon." He would not elaborate.
Smith arrest record revealed in trial
Los Angeles— A federal prosecutor dropped a
bombshell yesterday, revealing in court that boxing pro
moter Harold Smith is really a man named Ross Fields de
scribed as "a fugitive bad check and bunco artist" with an
arrest record dating back to the 19605.
The revelation was a bizarre new twist in the case ot
Smith, the colorful boxing figure who had been named as a
key suspect in a $21.3 million fraud suit by Wells Fargo
Bank.
"We have established without a question that Ross
Fields is a longtime fugitive, a bad checks and bunco artist
wanted in at least three jurisdictions," declared Asst. U.S.
Attorney Dean Allison.
Smith himself arose in the packed courtroom where he
was arraigned on a charge of falsifying a passport and de
clared, "My true name is Ross Fields."
He burst into tears and said he hoped that the friends
who had come to support him as Harold Smith also would
stand behind him with his true identity.
"Your honor, I could have been long gone," Smith told
U.S. Magistrate Venetta Tasasopulous, explaining he had
not fled even though he knew he might be arrested.
The magistrate made her bail ruling after Allison also
presented documents from North Carolina showing that

Smith is a fugitive in a case thereon charges of forgery and
false pretenses — offenses allegedly committed in 1975
Smith's attorneys. Robert Michaels and Jennifer King,
appeared surprised by some of the facts in the government
affidavits that were unsealed for the first time at the hear
ing.
Low scores to reduce HS grads
Sacramento — June 1981 will be "the moment of truth"
when nearly a quarter of California's 316,268 high school
seniors may not graduate because of failing scores on new
proficiency tests or because they don't have required
course credits, state schools superintendent Wilson Riles
said yesterday.
Riles, announcing the results of a surve> completed in
December 1980, told a press conference that as many as 12
percent of the state's high school seniors may fqil one or
more of the three required examinations.
Another 8 percent, he added, have not met course re
quirements and have also failed at least one of the tests,
while still another 4 percent have passed the tests but
tailed to get needed course credits.
The results, he said, "starkly highlight" the need to
direct "more emphasis, effort and resources" to the
state's public high schools.
At the same time. Riles said the test failure rate could
be reduced — "to perhaps 5 percent tor those tailing (to
graduate) because of the tests alone" — before June
through intensive instruction and retesting
"Everyone had a three-year warning that this was com
ing," Riles said, but "many of the schools hadn't taken it
very seriously."
Riles' report was based on a survey of 85 of the state's
377 school districts, involving about nearly 81,000 students.
