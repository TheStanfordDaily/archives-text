# Coffee House raises prices, blames costs

The Coffee House raised its prices
last week for the first time since the
restaurant was taken over by the
ASSU almost a year ago.
According to Coffee House manager
Steve Weiss, much of the increase is
due to higher food and labor costs.
"We're also upgrading free enter
tainment," Weiss said. Entertain
ment is funded equally by the Coffee
House and STARTS, the student arts
program.
The only changes Tresidder Union
made in the restaurant's original re
quests for sandwich and coffee in
creases were to limit the cost of liver
wurst and egg salad sandwiches to
$1.85 instead of $2. and to add a new
sandwich to the menu, cotta salami,
also costing $1.85. "Our goal was to
keep three sandwiches under $2,"
Greg Larson, assistant director of
Tresidder Union, said.
Coffee prices were raised from 25
cents to 30 cents per cup.
The most dramatic increase was
the cheese sandwich, which went from
$1.65 to $2.15. " But it you look in the su
permaket you'll see that cheese is
almost as expensive as meat." Larson
said. Beer prices, patrons will be re
lieved to note, however, will not be in
creased.
Another reason for higher prices is
that the bigger the Coffee House gets,
the bigger its losses become, said
Weiss.
"We lose $500 to $600 a month in sto
len china." he explained. "In January
we set up a drive to encourage people
to return their glasses and cups, and
now we have a policy that restricts
people from taking china outside, but
these acts have not helped curb our
losses at all," he said.
"We considered policing people, but
the end result is offending our regular
customers who do bring their china
back inside," he added.
Another costly factor is that the
Coffee House has no cooking facilities
and must buy expensive pre-cooked
meats. Nor can it buy huge quantities
like bigger restaurants can, Weiss
said.
Council of Presidents member Dick
Buttertield said the objectives of the
Coffee House under the ASSU are to
serve top quality food at prices sym
pathetic to students, provide free en
tertainment and provide jobs that stu
dents can handle.
Before it was taken over by the
ASSU last May 1, the Coffee House
was run by Guckenheimer En
terprises (GE) and Tresidder Dining
Services. But the main problem with
that management was that it was a big
corporation trying to run a student or
ganization, Buttertield said. "They
were trying to make a profit at the stu
dents' expense," he added
In July 1979, GE fired the Coffee
House staff, and while the former
staff picketed and boycotted the res
taurant, the ASSU decided to go one
step further and bid tor the contract

itself, explained Buttertield
Working with Business and Law
School students, the ASSU put togeth
er a satisfactory contract proposal for
he Coffee House.
The first thing the Coffee House did
under the new management, con
tinued Butterfield, "was to slash its
prices drastically to tit the student's
pocketbook." Now after a year, and 10
to 15 percent inflation, "we are raising
sandwich and coffee prices back to
where they were then," he added
According to Larson, the Coffee
House's contract states that the Cof
fee House must make all proposals for
price increases to Tresidder Union,
which in turn evaluates and either ap
proves or rejects them
Since the students have been run
ning the Coffee House, the customer
count has increased 63 percent from
the year before. Larson said
As of March 1. Larson added, there
has been a 69 percent increase in the
dollar volume of sales over the year
before "Possibly 10 percent of this
was due to inflation." he said, but the
rest is an indication of how much more
people are buying.
"The prices are a reflection of
where our costs lie," Weiss said.
However, the Coffee House has not
shown any profit since last Septem
ber. "We can pay our bills but we have
no profit," Weiss said "With the price
raise, we hope to register a tew hun
dred dollars gain, and any profit will
be poured back into the Coffee
House."
Larson said that the Coffee House's
goal this year is to break even.
"At the start there are always extra
costs and inefficiencies, and there
have been some losses, but at the end
there should be a break even," he
added.
Concerning the merits and dif
ficulties of a student-run organization,
Weiss said that "having students run

the Coffee House is not a problem but a
challenge "
Currently, there are 110 people on
the staff and only 12 are non-students,
Weiss said Because people work
many different shifts and there are
often new employees coming in, the
training program is continuous, he
added
The employee return rate has in

creased throughout the year. Weiss
said.
After autumn quarter, 60 percent of
the staff returned tor winter quarter
and this quarter 80 percent of the staff
came back, he added
In light of the Coffee House success.
Butterfield said that the ASSL is con
sidering either expanding it or possi
bly procuring other food services to be
run by students.

Patrons such as these will have to pay higher prices for sandwiches and coffee. Ihe price rises are blamed on ris
ing food and labor costs.
