# Carrot cake, Henry's top Coffee House menu
## 
### Helen Casabona 
The Coffee House sells approx
imately 800 pounds of coffee a month,
equalling more than 200 pounds a
week, or about 26 pounds of beans each
day.
But it's not just the coffee that at
tracts the mixture of academic social
ites and intellectuals to the Tresidder
establishment.
The carrot cake is the favorite bak
ery item sold, followed closely by the
cookies, Manager Steve Weiss said.
These delicacies, along with sweets
from the locally renowned Prolific
Oven, are hard to pass up while wait
ing in line for a cup of coffee.
What is the most popular beer sold
at the Coffee House? One of the
cheapest, of course. At 90 cents a shot,
Henry Weinhard's by far outsells its
more expensive competitors.
Although located in the very center
of the University, the Coffee House is
an escape from the rest of the school
The hanging plants, wooden decor,
bean sprouts and Judy Collins music
on the sound system seem farawav

from Green Library or Manzanita
Park.
Not all of its patrons are students.
According to cashier Jeannie
Lusignan. a good number ot the people
who come into the Coffee House are
not connected with the University at
all.
Some people come in at the same
time every day and order the exact
same thing. Lusignan said "One Eng
lish guy comes in every day and orders
a hot chocolate, so one day I bet the
other cashier $20 that I could predict
what he would order," she quipped
Needless to say. Lusignan went home
a little richer that day.
Finally, the Coffee House rivals any
library as the perfect study environ
ment. A lucky student can get a table
set up on the highest split level, the
one enclosed by a bannister. Then he
or she can spread out some papers,
open a book or two and inevitably a
friend will stop and talk, saving the
student from having to do any actual
work.
