# Court won't rule on Texas' California fruit embargo
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Supreme
Court added to California's problems
caused by the infestation of the Medi
terranean fruit fly yesterday, turning
down the state's attempt to sue Texas
over a Texas quarantine on California
grown fruits and vegetables.

In another decision affecting Cali
fornia, the high court refused to re
instate a California law allowing dis
tribution of anonymous political cam
paign literature. The justices, without
comment, left intact a state court rul
ing that struck down the law.

In the fruit fly case, the justices de
nied California's request "without
prejudice" — leaving the state free to
try again if the legal need should arise.
California previously had requested
that the high court postpone until July
1 consideration of its request.
The unusual situation stemmed
from a Texas Agriculture Dept order
last February that barred the import
ing of California crops because of the
highly destructive "Medfly."
California itsell has quarantined
fruit and vegetables grown in a 500-
square-mile area where a vigorous
battle has been waged against the de
structive insect.
California authorities reported that
about 1 percent of the state s fruit and
vegetables comes from the quaran
tined area, which includes some 50
square miles infested with the pest. A
450-square-mile buffer zone embrac
ing parts of Santa Clara and Alameda
counties also was quarantined.
The Supreme Court ordered a tem
porary halt to the Texas quarantine on
March 9. but Texas had voluntarily
lif ted its week-long quarantine March
7 after a tentative agreement between
Texas and avocado growers in Califor
nia was reached.
Regarding the anonymous political
campaign literature, the justices up
held an Imperial County district at
torney's ruling accusing three men
of violating a section of the Califor
nia Election Code that made it a mis
demeanor to reproduce or distribute
literature "having reference to an
election, to any candidate, or to any
measure" without identifying the per
son responsible for it.
The prosecutor's complaint named
Richard Schuster. Robert Simon and
Melvin Lewis.
Lawyer Joseph Daley of El Centro,
who represented the three men. said
the complaint centered on a direct
mail letter circulated during the 1978
campaign for election of a county su

perintendent of schools.
The case has not come to trial, so no
evidence has been formally presented
to determine whether the three men
were connected with the letter, he
said.
But the three successfully asked the
state courts to block prosecution on
grounds that the challenged section of
the election code violated the Con
stitution's free-speech guarantee.
"Since disclosure requirements un
doubtedly tend to restrict the freedom
to distribute and consequently deter
free speech." the state Supreme Court
said, "the latter right (free speech)
encompasses the right to remain
anonymous."
The state attorney general's office
urged the nation's highest court to re
verse the state courts, arguing that
the disclosure statute is justified for
"the prevention and detection of fraud
and corruption in the election proc
ess."
In other action, the court dramati
cally expanded on-the-job religious
freedom, ruling that a worker who
quits because of religious beliefs can
collect unemployment compensation.
By an 8-1 vote, the high court said
the state of Indiana must pay un
employment benefits to a Jehovah's
Witness who quit work rather than
help manufacture parts for military
tanks.
Chief Justice Warren Burger, writ
ing tor the court, warned the nation's
courts that they "should not undertake
to dissect religious beliefs."
Those beliefs "need not be accep
table. logical, consistent or com
prehensible to others" to be constitu
tionally protected. Burger said He
added that the beliefs do not have to be
shared by all the members of a re
ligious sect.
Sincere religious beliefs also do not
lose their protected status "because
the believer admits he is struggling

with his position or because his beliefs
are not articulated with the clarity
and precision that a more sophisti
cated person might employ," the chief
justice said.
The language of Burger's opinion
marked perhaps one of the court's
broadest and most emphatic readings
of the First Amendment guarantee of
religious freedom
In a busy day on the bench before be
ginning a two-week recess, the jus
tices also:
— Left intact rulings that allowed
the previously segregated school dis
trict in Charlotte. N.C., voluntarily to
impose more student busing to pre
vent new racial imbalance.
— Agreed to decide in an Oklahoma
case whether convicted 16-vear-old
murderers can be sentenced to death
The court's eventual ruling, expected
sometime next year, could define a
minimum age for imposition of capi
tal punishment.
— Left intact the 1979 pfrison-escape
conviction of Sara Jane Moore, serv
ing a life sentence for attempting to
assassinate President Gerald Ford in
1975. The escape conviction extended
the date Moore will become eligible
for parole from 1985 to 1986.
— Refused to disturb an Oregon rul
ing that persons facing involuntary
commitment for alleged mental ill
ness have no right to remain silent at
commitment hearings.
— Agreed to decide in a Hawaii case
whether the Defense Dept must de
tail the possible environmental im
pact of storing nuclear weapons at lo
cations where they may be stored Be
cause of security reasons, the Pen
tagon refuses to say where nuclear
weapons actually are stored.
— Determined that it would rule lat
er on whether the federal government
must test two new leasing systems in
future sales of petroleum drilling
rights off the nation's seashores.

Washington (AP) — The Supreme
Court added to California's problems
caused by the infestation of the Medi
terranean fruit fly yesterday, turning
down the state's attempt to sue Texas
over a Texas quarantine on California
grown fruits and vegetables.

In another decision affecting Cali
fornia, the high court refused to re
instate a California law allowing dis
tribution of anonymous political cam
paign literature. The justices, without
comment, left intact a state court rul
ing that struck down the law.

In the fruit fly case, the justices de
nied California's request "without
prejudice" — leaving the state free to
try again if the legal need should arise.
California previously had requested
that the high court postpone until July
1 consideration of its request.
The unusual situation stemmed
from a Texas Agriculture Dept order
last February that barred the import
ing of California crops because of the
highly destructive "Medfly."
California itsell has quarantined
fruit and vegetables grown in a 500-
square-mile area where a vigorous
battle has been waged against the de
structive insect.
California authorities reported that
about 1 percent of the state s fruit and
vegetables comes from the quaran
tined area, which includes some 50
square miles infested with the pest. A
450-square-mile buffer zone embrac
ing parts of Santa Clara and Alameda
counties also was quarantined.
The Supreme Court ordered a tem
porary halt to the Texas quarantine on
March 9. but Texas had voluntarily
lif ted its week-long quarantine March
7 after a tentative agreement between
Texas and avocado growers in Califor
nia was reached.
Regarding the anonymous political
campaign literature, the justices up
held an Imperial County district at
torney's ruling accusing three men
of violating a section of the Califor
nia Election Code that made it a mis
demeanor to reproduce or distribute
literature "having reference to an
election, to any candidate, or to any
measure" without identifying the per
son responsible for it.
The prosecutor's complaint named
Richard Schuster. Robert Simon and
Melvin Lewis.
Lawyer Joseph Daley of El Centro,
who represented the three men. said
the complaint centered on a direct
mail letter circulated during the 1978
campaign for election of a county su

perintendent of schools.
The case has not come to trial, so no
evidence has been formally presented
to determine whether the three men
were connected with the letter, he
said.
But the three successfully asked the
state courts to block prosecution on
grounds that the challenged section of
the election code violated the Con
stitution's free-speech guarantee.
"Since disclosure requirements un
doubtedly tend to restrict the freedom
to distribute and consequently deter
free speech." the state Supreme Court
said, "the latter right (free speech)
encompasses the right to remain
anonymous."
The state attorney general's office
urged the nation's highest court to re
verse the state courts, arguing that
the disclosure statute is justified for
"the prevention and detection of fraud
and corruption in the election proc
ess."
In other action, the court dramati
cally expanded on-the-job religious
freedom, ruling that a worker who
quits because of religious beliefs can
collect unemployment compensation.
By an 8-1 vote, the high court said
the state of Indiana must pay un
employment benefits to a Jehovah's
Witness who quit work rather than
help manufacture parts for military
tanks.
Chief Justice Warren Burger, writ
ing tor the court, warned the nation's
courts that they "should not undertake
to dissect religious beliefs."
Those beliefs "need not be accep
table. logical, consistent or com
prehensible to others" to be constitu
tionally protected. Burger said He
added that the beliefs do not have to be
shared by all the members of a re
ligious sect.
Sincere religious beliefs also do not
lose their protected status "because
the believer admits he is struggling

with his position or because his beliefs
