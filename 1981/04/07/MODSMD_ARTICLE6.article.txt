## Yugoslavian troops quell separatist Albanian riots 
### Washington Post 
Belgrade, Yugoslavia â€” The
Yugoslav government ordered
its armed forces into the south
ern province of Kosovo Friday
following two days of serious na
tionalist disturbances by ethnic
Albanians.
Federal officials said it was
the "worst outbreak of separa
tist demands" in the province,
which is roughly half the size of
Maryland and whose population
numbers 1.7 million. Ethnic
Albanians, who are overwhelm
ingly Moslem, make up three
quarters of Kosovo's inhabi
tants.
The unrest poses the first se
rious challenge to the suc
cessors of Marshal Tito, who
died 11 months ago. Officials
here said they were determined
to suppress Albanian separatist
demands since they would
amount to the first step in dis
membering this complex multi
national state.
Tanks and troops were
deployed after the government
proclaimed a state of emer
gency in the region, which is ad
jacent to Albania, following
clashes in which two demon
strators were killed and scores
of people injured, including a
number of policemen.
Demand unification
The demonstrators are said to
have chanted slogans demand

ing the unification of Kosovo
with Albania, a militantly isola
tionist nation that considers
itself the one true communist
country in the world.
A Yugoslav government
statement charged that the riots
had been organized by groups
outside Yugoslavia "to create
instability and endanger the ter
ritorial integrity of Yugo
slavia."
Eyewitnesses reported that
Thursday, during the second
successive day of rioting, cars
and trucks were overturned and
burned in the center of the pro
vincial capital of Pristina. The
army guarded public buildings
and factories while ambulances
toured the streets to pick up the
injured.
Under the emergency meas
ures, a dusk-to-dawn curfew has
been imposed, all public gather
ings have been banned and
movement into and out of the
province has been restricted.
Several foreign correspondents
visiting the area have been or
dered to leave after being con
fined Thursday night to their ho
tel and prevented from tele
phoning.
Pristina was reported quiet
but extremely tense Friday as
most people kept off the streets
patrolled by army and police.
But officials fear fresh dis
turbances Saturday during the

funeral of the two demonstrat
ors.
Students
The unrest began among stu
dents at the University of
Pristina last month and was
sparked by complaints over
poor food in the university's
cafeteria Since then other
groups reportedly have joined in
the protests, including miners
from the region.
Officials said the security
services had been given strict
orders not to fire on demon
strators. but to use only tear gas
and clubs to break up all illegal
gatherings. Fresh security units
have been sent into the region.
The rioting has triggered con
siderable fears among Kosovo's
Serb minority who are fright
ened of being the target of the
Albanian protests. Several Serb
villages in the province, which
is Yugoslavia's poorest region,
have erected blockades to pro
tect themselves from possible
attack.
Yugoslav officials said it was
impossible to say whether the
unrest was being stirred up
from neighboring Albania
which, in public, has shown
great restraint in reporting the
clashes. The demonstrators are
said to have chanted slogans of
"Long Live Enver Hoxha." the
name of the Albanian leader.
