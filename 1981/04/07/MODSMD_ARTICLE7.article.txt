# Americans flee Ugandan terror campaign

Kampala, Uganda — President Milton
Obote's government has launched a cam
paign of repression and terror that has left
at least 60 people dead in the last two weeks
and led to the arrest of journalists and sus
pected political enemies.
The atmosphere of tension and fear that
has pervaded this country since the time of
dictator Idi Amin has become increasingly
heavy over the last month and has virtually
dispelled whatever hopes for a stable de
mocracy may have accompanied Obote's
election in December.
The government is beset by two dissident
groups, both of them armed and bent on
driving Obote from office. They have at
tacked police stations, a prison, power lines
and a government radio transmitter, and
they have ambushed a convoy of the Tanza
nian troops who have been here since they
drove Amin out. About 20 Tanzanian sol
diers were killed.
The government has been unable to locate
its avowed enemies or to identify its clan
destine enemies. Thus stymied, informed
sources say, the government has activated
its cadres of secret police and military
agents. As a result, 41 bodies, including
those of four school girls in uniform, were
found last week in Namanve Forest near
Kampala — the same forest used by Amin's
police as a dumping ground be its victims.
All 41 bodies bore bullet wounds.
Daily accounting
According to a daily accounting taken
each morning in the streets of Kampala by
local journalists, politicians, embassy of
ficials and others, 20 additional people have
been killed in and around the city in the last
two weeks.
Further, reliable reports indicate that the
government has reopened the State Re
search Bureau, which became notorious un
der Amin as a house of torture and murder
carried out by the State Research Unit.
The U.S. Embassy in Kampala flew out
all American dependents Wednesday The

five wives and four children were flown to
Nairobi, in neighboring Kenya, where they
were to remain "until security conditions in
Kampala improve." «
The State Dept. said in Washington that
there are 12 Americans left in the embassy
and a total of about 200 Americans remain
ing in Uganda.
"The situation here is extremely grave."
an obviously frightened opposition party
leader in Parliament said. "We must be
very careful."
Caution
Caution, in fact, is the watchword for life
in Kampala today, possibly more so than at
any time since the first days after Amin's
ouster by a combination of Ugandan exiles
and Tanzanian army troops on April 11.
1979.
There is no longer a curfew in effect in the
city, but the streets are virtually empty by 5
p.m. Drivers of hired cars and embassy ve
hicles careen through the streets trying to
avoid roadblocks and get home safely
before nightfall.
Talk
In the mornings, on street corners and in
tea houses, there is talk of bodies in the for
est, of people missing and of people ar
rested.
John Magezi. a leading member of the
Democratic Party, which opposed Obote's
Uganda People's Congress in the December
elections, said the member of Parliament
from Iganga Central was being detained
without charges. Five newspapers were
banned a month ago.
Three employees of the leftist-oriented
newspaper Weekly Topic were arrested
Wednesday. According to Evariste
Nnyanzi, a Democratic Party member of
Parliament from the town of Mpigi, the ar
rests could have been carried out by any one
of several security operations being run by
the ruling party.
"There is one unit in Uganda House (the
party headquarters)," he said. "They oper
ate under the umbrella of the party and their

job is to handle political cases and bypass
the courts and the police.
"There is another unit operating in Nile
Mansions," he said, referring to a hotel here
where many government officials live.
"And then there is the State Research Bu
reau, which is back in business, being oper
ated by the special force, which was sup
posed to be an anti-smuggling, anti-corrup
tion unit, but which is doing other things
that do not meet the eye."
Notable
Nnyanzi is notable in Uganda these days
for his willingness to be quoted by name.
But the charges he makes are echoed by oth
ers, who insist on anonymity. Several of
them pinpoint the same room in Nile Man
sions — Suite 211 — where a unit of the se
cret police carries out its work against sus
pected political opponents.
It is impossible to find a government of
ficial who will respond to these charges, but
on Tuesday the government newspaper pub
lished the text of a speech by Obote that was
regarded here as a clear warning to the peo
ple of Buganda, the region where opposition
to Obote is strongest.
Bandits
In the speech, Obote insisted that areas
which help "bandits" will be vulnerable to
attack and receive less development aid.
Many of the Buganda people, who domi
nate the populous region around Kampala,
supported the Democratic Party in the De
cember elections, and most of them feel
that Obote's party rigged the elections. The
Democratic Party has filed court
challenges over 25 seats in Parliament.
It is the charge of rigging that spawned
one of the two groups fighting Obote, the so
called Popular Revolutionary Army. Its
leader, an unsuccessful candidate for presi
dent named Yoweri Museveni, has vowed
that unless new elections are called there
will be "full-scale war against Obote."
The other group calls itself the Uganda
Freedom Movement. Little is known about
it, even the identity of its leaders.
