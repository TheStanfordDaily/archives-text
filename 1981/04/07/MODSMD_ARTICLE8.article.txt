# Disputes may lead to showdown with Israel
## Syria-Lebanon conflict grows 
### 
Beirut, Lebanon (AP) — The
new outbreak of fighting in Leb
anon has raised fears of another
showdown between Syria and Is
rael.
Syria, which has 22.000 troops
in Lebanon, proclaims itself the
defender of the 400,000 Palesti
nians living in the divided
Middle Eastern country as well
as the 1.1 million Lebanese
Moslems. Syrian troops are sta
tioned only in Moslem areas.
Israel has vowed to be the ul
timate protector of the Leba
nese Christians, the other half of
the 3 million population. It arms
and supports the Christian
militia of Maj. Saad Haddad,

the former Lebanese army ma
jor who controls a buffer zone in
southernmost Lebanon between
the Palestinians and Israel.

News analysis

The current crisis exploded
last Wednesday when Syrian
tanks and artillery opened fire
on Zahle, a Roman Catholic city
30 miles east of Beirut. It is con
trolled by the rightist Christian
Phalange Party and its militia.
The fighting spread to the
Green Line dividing the Moslem
and Christian sectors of Beirut.
Syrian troops in the Moslem
West Beirut exchanged fire with
the Lebanese army and Chris
tian militiamen in the Christian
eastern half of the capital.
Haddad's forces opened fire
from their southern enclave on
the Lebanese Moslems and
Palestinians in the coastal
cities of Sidon and Tyre. Haddad
threatened to keep up the bar
rage until the siege of Zahle was
lifted.
"There are two worrisome
aspects to the crisis, " said one
Western diplomat. "The hu
manitarian one, the civilian vic
tims, and the threat that the
fighting could engulf other
parties into the dispute so that it
is no longer a local conflict."

Much may depend on whether
Lebanon's government, a coali
tion of 21 ministers representing
half a dozen Christian and
Moslem sects, is able to
withstand the political fallout
from the fighting.
President Elias Sarkis, a
Christian, and Prime Minister
Shafik Wazzan, a Sunni Moslem,
have been desperately contact
ing leaders of political factions
in an effort to keep the govern
ment from splitting along sec
tarian lines and plunging,the na
tion into a new round of civil
war. Christian ministers have
threatened to walk out if the
Syrians take control of Zahle.
After four days of fighting in
which about 150 people have
been killed and more than 500
have been wounded, "I think
we've never been nearer to
partition than we are today,"
said Ghassan Tueni, Lebanon's
ambassador to the United Na
tions and publisher of the re
spected independent newspaper
An Nahar.
Diplomatic analysts suggest
that if the government col
lapses, Israel might feel it must
make good on its promise to pro
tect the Christians, and Syria
would then have to honor its
pledges to the Lebanese
Moslems and Palestinians.
