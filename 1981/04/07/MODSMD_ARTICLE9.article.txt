# Libya to buy nuke missiles

### 
Rabat, Morocco (AP) — The
Libyan government has signed a
contract with a West German
firm to buy medium-range mis
siles capable of carrying nucle
ar warheads to any target in the
Middle East or southern Eu
rope, official Moroccan sources
said.
In Munich, an official with the
firm said it was merely testing
sub-orbital satellites in the Lib
yan desert under an oral agree
ment with Libya and that re
ports of a contract to provide
Libya a missile system by 1986
were "complete nonsense."
The Moroccan sources
claimed Libya is developing a
nuclear weapon in a separate
program.
They said the first missile
trials were carried out in the
Libyan desert recently by the
West Germany company Or
bital Transport und Raketen Co.
or OTRAG, which was involved
in an East-West controversy
when it conducted similar mis
sile trials in Zaire in 1978.
Moroccan officials are usual
ly well-informed through diplo
matic and intelligence sources
on events in Libya. The report of
the contract was carried by the
official Moroccan news agency.
There was no immediate Lib
yan comment on the Moroccan
account.
In Bonn, OTRAG officials an
nounced that the tests con
ducted in the Libyan oasis of
Sebha, 350 miles south of
Tripoli, on March 1 were of a
missile intended for "launching
communications satellites."
Frank Wukasch, technical di
rector of OTRAG, said in
Munich that reports the com
pany will supply Libya with a
nuclear missile system "is com
plete nonsense ... totally made
up."
"A military use has never
been contemplated and will not
be contemplated," said
Wukasch.
