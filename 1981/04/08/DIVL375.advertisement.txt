n a certain plaza in Florence there is a pair of
statues — a naked man and a naked woman
who are reaching out to each other but are
barely separated One day a good fairy is
taking an art tour and chances upon these
statues What a shame' the fairy thinks,
■ Those statues have been reaching tor each
other for hundreds of years, but can t touch
Deciding to remedy the situation, the fiary
brings tne statues fo life and tells them that
they have one hour to do whatever they want,
at tn4 end of which time they must be back in
their original statue positions
The boy statue, with a mischievous gleam
in his eyes, asks the girl statue. Do you want
to? She says yes, and they run off together
Forty-five minutes later they return with satis
fied smiles Seeing that they still have 15 mi
nutes the girl statue asks the boy statue, "Say
do you want to do it again?' The boy statue
says, I'd love to, only this time you hold the
pigeons and I'll crap on them!"
