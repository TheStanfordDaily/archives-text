When your mom sends her best
and 12
Mom.
God bless her.
What would you do without her love? Her encouragement?
Or her black walnut fudge?
And what would her "care packages" be like
without a tall, cold glass of milk?
Milk makes those "delicious deliveries"
taste even better. So when you open your goodies... open the milk.
And make sure your roommates don't eat your mail.
there's nothing like something
with Milk. v
This seal is your assurance
of a real dairy food.^^^;
