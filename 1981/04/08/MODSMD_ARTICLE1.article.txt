# Brezhnev defuses Polish crisis

From the Daily wire services
Moscow — By giving a new en
dorsement yesterday to the Polish
Communist Party, Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev has defused, at least
temporarily, the crisis that had been
brewing over possible Moscow in
tervention into Poland.
Brezhnev told the Czech Communist
Party Congress meeting in Prague
that attempts to undermine the au
thority of the Polish party were conti
nuing just as similar attempts had
evolved in Czechoslovakia in 1968,
when Soviet troops entered that coun
try and crushed a liberal Communist
regime of Alexander Dubcek.
"But the Polish Communists, with
the support of all genuine patriots of
Poland, will be able, one should be
lieve, to give a fitting rebuff to the de
signs of the enemies of the socialist
system who are at the same time the
enemies of Poland's independence,"
Brezhnev said.
Maneuvers in Poland end
Underscoring the Soviet leader's
comments in Prague, the Soviet news
agency Tass announced last night that
the extended Warsaw Pact maneuvers
that had been held in Poland and just
outside its borders had ended.
Western observers had pointed to the
maneuvers in raising their fears that a
Soviet invasion of Poland was immi
nent.
Tass reported that all troops in
volved in the maneuvers had returned
to their permanent bases.
Responding to the Brezhnev speech,
Undersecretary of State for Political
Affairs Walter Stoessel said the Poles
now "have some more time to put
their house in order, according to Sovi
et lights."
At the State Department, spokes
man William Dyess responded more
cautiously to Brezhnev's speech, de
livered at a Czechoslovak Communist
Party Congress.
'We welcome this'
"If he meant to say that the Poles
should be allowed to solve their own
problems without outside in
terference, we would welcome this,"

Dyess said. "That's been our consis
tent position."
It was just last Friday that the Rea
gan administration seemed to have re
signed itself to an imminent Soviet in
tervention. Despite an easing of ten
sions inside Poland, the Warsaw Pact
troop maneuvers had gone well
beyond what U.S. officials said was re
quired for the annual spring exercises
The Soviets flew a number of mili
tary transport planes into Poland.
Dyess, the State Department spokes
man, said the Soviets were "capable
of moving at any time."
Message from hospital
From his hospital bed, President
Ronald Reagan authorized the sending
of a message to Brezhnev reportedly
warning of grave consequences to
East-West relations if Moscow in
terfered. And in Bonn, West Germany,
Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger declared anew, this time to
NATO defense ministers, that the
United States would entertain no re
newal of arms talks if the Soviets in
tervened in Poland.
Brezhnev's speech was in clear con
trast to one given Monday by Gustav
Husak, the Czechoslovak Communist
Party chief. In that address, Husak
warned that neighboring Communist
states would come to the defense of
the Polish party in its attempts to hold
off on reforms demanded by Solidar
ity, the independent Polish trade union
federation.
Husak's warning was a restatement
of the Brezhnev Doctrine that was
used to justify the invasion of Czecho
slovakia in 1968, bringing Husak to
power.
'Enemies of communism'
In his speech, Brezhnev warned that
the enemies of communism "are us
ing any means, such as economic pres
sure and blackmail, false propaganda,
flattery and demagogy, support and
encouragement of coun
terrevolutionary forces where they
still exist, and many other types of
subversive activities."
He was clearly referring to the
many warnings from Western powers

of the penalties that Moscow would
have to pay for any forceful repression
of the Polish workers and their allies
The Polish section of the speech was
brief and Tass attempted to direct at
tention away from it by emphasizing
Brezhnev's new plea for resumed
East-West negotiations to halt the
deployment of more nuclear weapons
in Europe.
The speech appeared to be aimed at
NATO leaders meeting in Bonn, West
Germany, to discuss nuclear issues,
as well as giving comfort both to party
leaders in Prague and Warsaw.
Speech carried in Moscow
The 31- minute speech was carried
live on Moscow television and showed
the 74-year-old Brezhnev tiring as he
neared the end of his text. He paused
once to cough and wipe his face and
toward the end he was barely under
standable.
The speech also was carried live on
television in East Germany, Hungary,
Bulgaria and Poland — all the East
bloc states except Romania. Stefan
Olszowski, a hard-line member of the
Polish Politburo, represented his
country at the congress.
The specific reference to Poland
yesterday was the first authoratative
Kremlin commentary on the fast
moving events in that country since
Feb. 23.
