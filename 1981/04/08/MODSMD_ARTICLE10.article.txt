# SRI explores the extrasensory

Psychic phenomena, are
they scientific facts that can
be explained by the laws of
physics or merely a bizarre
power experienced by those
who profess the ability to see
the future?
Three physicists at SRI
(Stanford Research In
stitute) have conducted re
search for the past seven
years that suggests it is pos
sible to obtain information
from "psychic" channels.
Drs. Harold Puthoff, Rus
sell Targ and Edwin May
presented a research paper
to the American Association
for the Advancement of Sci
ence in January, 1979, de
scribing their experimenta
tion in this field.
"For the past seven years
we have been investigating
aspects of human perception
that appear to fall outside the
range of well-understood
perceptual/processing
capabilities," states the pa
per. Targ and Puthoff col
laborated on another paper
published in 1975 presenting
the conclusions of more than
50 controlled laboratory ex
periments that attested to
the presence of an ability
they termed "remote view
ing."
A Stanford student who
has participated as a subject
in several experiments but
who perfers not to be identi
fied said that psychic ability
is a "democratic" one. "All
people tested can do experi
ments with statistical signif
icance," said the student.
The experiments con
ducted at SRI involve the dis
cipline of physics to attempt

to measure or define the abil
ity to see things in other
places.
A subject is placed in a
Faraday cage surrounded by
electrical shielding to insure
that no signals reach the sub
ject influencing their per
formance. At the beginning
of a trial, a subject is
closeted with an ex
perimenter at SRI to await
an agreed-upon start time.
At the same time a target
team is sent, without com
munication with either the
subject or the experimenter
both of whom remain at SRI,
to a target location some
where in the San Francisco
Bay Area.
The target is determined
by random number access to
a target pool of sealed trav
elling orders previously pre
pared by an independent ex
perimenter and kept locked
in a secure safe. The target
pool consists of more than
100 target locations chosen.
During a predetermined
viewing period, typically of
15 minutes duration, the sub
ject is asked to sketch and
described into a tape rec
order his impressions of the
target site being visited. The
experimenter with the subjet
is kept ignorant of the target
to insure complete protec
tion.
Both papers contain sever
al examples coupling photo
graphs of the actual site with
the drawings completed by
the subject; in most cases
the correlation is obvious.
"People get better with

practice," commented the
student. She explained that
disbelief in the presence of
psyhic phenomenon stems
from the fact that "we've
been trained our whole lives
not to believe in it. Psychic
phenomenon is just begin
ning to use a perception nev
er used before."
Another anonymous stu
dent familiar with the SRI
research explained the dif
ferences between three cur
rent definitions of psychic
ability: telepathy is the abili
ty to read someone elses'
mind; clairvoyance is the
ability to see something ex
isting somewhere else; pre
cognition is the ability to see
something that hasn't hap
pened yet.
Both students emphasized
that the mechanics of phys
ics which "defines a field as
what happens in the physical
universe" are appropriate
tools to explore psychic per
ception.
Commenting on the use of
physics to explain the remote
viewing ability, one of the
students responded "you can
be sitting in your room and
see Washington, D.C. on tele
vision and that's physics."
The students stressed that
subjects can "see" the loca
tion over any distance and
that interest is the most im
portant factor in the success
of the experiments. People
get better with practice,"
said the student involved in
the study explaining that it is
like any other sense, the
more exposure to its use, the
more refined the ability be
comes.

During a predetermined
viewing period, typically of
15 minutes duration, the sub
ject is asked to sketch and
described into a tape rec
order his impressions of the
target site being visited. The
experimenter with the subjet
is kept ignorant of the target
to insure complete protec
tion.
Both papers contain sever
al examples coupling photo
graphs of the actual site with
the drawings completed by
the subject; in most cases
the correlation is obvious.
"People get better with

practice," commented the
student. She explained that
disbelief in the presence of
psyhic phenomenon stems
from the fact that "we've
been trained our whole lives
not to believe in it. Psychic
phenomenon is just begin
ning to use a perception nev
er used before."
Another anonymous stu
dent familiar with the SRI
research explained the dif
ferences between three cur
rent definitions of psychic
ability: telepathy is the abili
ty to read someone elses'
mind; clairvoyance is the
ability to see something ex
isting somewhere else; pre
cognition is the ability to see
something that hasn't hap
pened yet.
Both students emphasized
that the mechanics of phys
ics which "defines a field as
what happens in the physical
universe" are appropriate
tools to explore psychic per
ception.
Commenting on the use of
physics to explain the remote
viewing ability, one of the
students responded "you can
be sitting in your room and
see Washington, D.C. on tele
vision and that's physics."
The students stressed that
subjects can "see" the loca
tion over any distance and
that interest is the most im
portant factor in the success
of the experiments. People
get better with practice,"
said the student involved in
the study explaining that it is
like any other sense, the
more exposure to its use, the
more refined the ability be
comes.
Psychic phenomena, are
they scientific facts that can
be explained by the laws of
physics or merely a bizarre
power experienced by those
who profess the ability to see
the future?
Three physicists at SRI
(Stanford Research In
stitute) have conducted re
search for the past seven
years that suggests it is pos
sible to obtain information
from "psychic" channels.
Drs. Harold Puthoff, Rus
sell Targ and Edwin May
presented a research paper
to the American Association
for the Advancement of Sci
ence in January, 1979, de
scribing their experimenta
tion in this field.
"For the past seven years
we have been investigating
aspects of human perception
that appear to fall outside the
range of well-understood
perceptual/processing
capabilities," states the pa
per. Targ and Puthoff col
laborated on another paper
published in 1975 presenting
the conclusions of more than
50 controlled laboratory ex
periments that attested to
the presence of an ability
they termed "remote view
ing."
A Stanford student who
has participated as a subject
in several experiments but
who perfers not to be identi
fied said that psychic ability
is a "democratic" one. "All
people tested can do experi
ments with statistical signif
icance," said the student.
The experiments con
ducted at SRI involve the dis
cipline of physics to attempt

to measure or define the abil
ity to see things in other
places.
A subject is placed in a
Faraday cage surrounded by
electrical shielding to insure
that no signals reach the sub
ject influencing their per
formance. At the beginning
of a trial, a subject is
closeted with an ex
perimenter at SRI to await
an agreed-upon start time.
At the same time a target
team is sent, without com
munication with either the
subject or the experimenter
both of whom remain at SRI,
to a target location some
where in the San Francisco
Bay Area.
The target is determined
by random number access to
a target pool of sealed trav
elling orders previously pre
pared by an independent ex
perimenter and kept locked
in a secure safe. The target
pool consists of more than
100 target locations chosen.
During a predetermined
viewing period, typically of
15 minutes duration, the sub
ject is asked to sketch and
described into a tape rec
order his impressions of the
target site being visited. The
experimenter with the subjet
is kept ignorant of the target
to insure complete protec
tion.

al examples coupling photo

the correlation is obvious.
