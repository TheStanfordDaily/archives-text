# Birthday extravaganza to honor Donald Tresidder
## 
### J. Raymond Mills 
Student Arts at Stanford
(STARTS) will sponsor a party
and dance tomorrow night to
commemorate the birthday of
the late Donald Bertrand Tres
idder, Stanford's president
from 1943 to 1948.
The event, scheduled to begin
at 8 p.m. in Tresidder large
lounge, will feature the lively
dance music of the Claude
Monet Band and the country and
bluegrass sounds of the Griffin
Family Band.
STARTS is providing free re
freshments for the affair, in
cluding a colossal specially de
signed birthday cake large
enough to feed several hundred
people.
On July 21,1961, the site of
Tresidder Memorial Union was
dedicated to the memory of
Stanford's fourth president who
is remembered as being very
popular among students.
Donald Tresidder was a man
who, according to an account in
the old San Francisco News,
"loved them (thestudents) as if
they were his children, en
couraged their endeavors, sym
pathized with their problems
and had a rare understanding of
their shortcomings."
"Spontaneously and genuine
ly, we like this rugged, friendly
man," read a Daily editorial
published a few days after Tres
idder took office in 1943. He has
inspired us with complete con
fidence and loyalty — he has es
tablished a common bond of un
derstanding."
An exhibit displaying memo
rabilia from the Tresidder
years at Stanford compiled by
STARTS program director Jean
Martin will be set up outside the
lounge where the party is to take
place.
Organizers of the party are
hoping that it will help to re
verse a trend that has given
Tresidder Union a reputation as
more of a profit motivated com
mercial center than a student
union.
According to STARTS repre
sentative, Hillary Hall, the
Tresidder Birthday party is in
tended to be the forerunner of a
STARTS spring lounge concert
series and calendar of events
that offer little-known and well
known performers a forum for

their talents, while providing a
diverse assortment of low-cost
entertainment opportunities to
members of the Stanford com
munity.
Other events on the STARTS
spring program called "Culture
Down on the Farm" include
A.lex DeGrassi arid Scott Cossu

vvith acoustic guitar and piano
on April 30 and an all-day Jazz
festival on May 15.

STARTS sponsored activities
for spring quarter are available
in the STARTS office, located on
