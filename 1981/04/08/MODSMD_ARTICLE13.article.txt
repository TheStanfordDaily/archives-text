## Real war in desire to fulfill our self-image 
### 
Another El Salvador article?
Oh Lord, spare me. The last
thing I want to read in the Daily
is something about El Salvador.
I mean, it's all a bunch of Viet
nam nostalgia, right? Some peo
ple feel they missed out on
something exciting in the 60s
and so now they find some other
tiny, insignificant country to
pick on.
Then, as if it wasn't blown out
of proportion already it be
comes a campus "issue."
Forget it. Just more Sunday
Flicks airplane material for
me. I'd rather read about real
campus issues that affect me,
like "The Curse of Being an In
tellectual Black Woman Handi
capped Escondido Resident
Fuzzy Studies Grad Student
Clerical Worker at Stanford."
The above is not hyperbole or
stereotype. Like many other
students, I simply did not know
or care about what happened
south of Lake Lagunita. let
alone Central America. I pre
ferred to coast along, hidden
away in the Hills of Academia,
thinking about how the slums
have so much soul. I can't really
say how or why, but then I
started reading a bit about what
was going on. I had to know why
so much was being printed
about this place, at the very
least. I mean, the Daily editors
may look it, but they can't really
be that dumb.
I gave myself a sort of crash
course on El Salvador and final
ly realized why people are con
cerned. What's more, I realized
that our problem in El Salvador
isn't really all that different
from our gripes at Stanford. I
was surprised, and I was
scared.
The main characteristic of
our El Salvador policy seems to
be that we don't care about the
country itself, but about our own
image. (If you already know this
and have been keeping up on the
issue, bear with me — I'm not as
well informed). To this day, I
have no idea of the history be
hind our Central America in
volvement. All I know is that
there's a lot of shooting going
on, and people are getting shot
by both sides, military right and
radical left. For some reason
(or maybe no reason), we feel
compelled to join all this. Why?
To hear the boys in Washing
ton tell it, it's not a question of
El Salvador. It's a question of
Cuba and ultimately the Soviet
Union. Secretary of State Haig
is hinting at direct assault on
Cuba to stop its "influence" on
El Salvador. The only consistent
justification for our presence
there is to stop the world domi
nation plot of the Communists.
Before you start thinking

about how familiar it sounds, let
the Defense folks tell you that
it's not like Vietnam. President
Reagan (I still can't get used to
that) says that El Salvador is
different from Vietnam in that
we won't be out for containment
of Communism in Central
America. Instead, we'll be out
to win. That makes me feel a lot
better.
It's not that I can't under
stand how our government feels
— I'd like to think I do. In the
modern world, life's a matter of
Us vs. Them, and we've got to
fight to win. And maybe if I was
brought up during the Cold War,
I'd think that way too. But it
isn't the Cold War anymore —
why do we feel compelled to
fight? Why must we see the
world as Us vs. Them?
It isn't like that in the Hills of
Academia. Or so we think. In re
ality, the same battleground
mentality exists at Stanford in
ways that we fail to recognize.
When you get to Stanford,
you're not just a student. You
can join any number of special,
isolated groups, all with special,
isolated interests that you
share. Look at Once Around the
Quad and see the proliferation
o{ special groups orv campus.
The implied message of each of
these groups is that people
should stick with their own kind
in order to get ahead.
This is no different in attitude
than the nationalism present in
our saber-rattling foreign poli
cy. Granted, it's hard to see the
Black Pre-law Society going to
war with AIESEC, and these
groups do all claim higher goals
than forming cliques. But as
long as people blindly rely on
groups to give them a sense of
identity, one should consider
whether they're not preparing
for lives of conflict.
More important are the per
ceptions we have ourselves — as
Stanford students, as members
of organizations, as foot soldiers
in the wars of Us vs. Them. For
the truth of the matter is, we
want the dog tags identifying
which "Us" we belong to. The
real war isn't in El Salvador or
anywhere else, but in our own
desires to fulfill images of
ourselves. Because of this re
liance, an examination of in
fluences here is not a subject of
idle curiosity but genuine con
cern.
For a more specific picture of
the University battle zones, look
at the different "images" peo
ple strive for on campus. The
Preppy Handbook is a big seller
at the bookstore. ASSU Senate
meetings are miniature ex
ercises in power politics. An

article ran in the Daily a while
back bemoaning the curse of
being "intellectual." Yet, the
"intellectual" image at this uni
versity, like the "preppy" im
age or the "political" image or
the "jock" image, seems to rely
on one thing above all else — the
neglect of personal values for
the sake of an appearance.
I saw Altered States with a
friend from a class of mine a
few weeks ago. After the film,
we got into a rather extensive
discussion about its themes. By
any standard, it was an intellec
tual discussion. We talked about
the film, Western tradition,
Dante, literary symbolism the
nature of man, the Daily —- all
the thoughtful subjects of ev
eryday life. It was also a frus
trating experience, for I didn't
feel anything was really being
said.
Eventually, the themes we
were discussing lost their at
traction somewhat, and we
began applying some of our re
spective statements to more
personal beliefs. The battle of
philosophical viewpoints be
came a comparison of individ
ual attitudes.
It was at that point that I
finally felt that what we said
was worthwhile. The conversa
tion lasted much longer, and I
left that evening with a feeling
of time well-spent. I remember
that conversation still. It's im
portant to me, not because of
the consideration of big issues,
but because of having really
talked about personal values.
Sometimes the only real use of
being "intellectual" is in deal
ing with non-intellectual things.
If those human values are lost in
pursuit of an image, then the im
age becomes a cipher, useless in
every way.
Thousands of other people
have said that to have human
feelings is important, and prob
ably in better ways than I have.
But such a lack of feeling is en
couraged in our campus in
fluences that it is almost im
possible to deal with them all
and still come out with any
semblance of an individual soul.
Increasingly, we are being
taught to look at things in the
world as distinct confrontations
— Us vs. Them. If this is being
fed to us as students, and espe
cially if we embrace it and hold
it as a guideline to our individual
lives, it gets easy to neglect per
sonal values in the rush to the
battle lines and stop caring
about innocent bystanders. Like
El Salvador.
All of a sudden, I see why our
leaders think the way they do
about our role in Central Ameri
ca. Noticing the same ways of

thinking at Stanford, I see why
we as students should be con
cerned about El Salvador. And
because I can't see an answer,
or a way out of the line of fire,
I'm more than concerned — I'm
frightened.
