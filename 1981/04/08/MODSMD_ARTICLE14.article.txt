# Residents' rebuttal
## French house strikes back 
### 
The Millennium Falcon broke down in a remote
corner of the galaxy. Luke, Leah, Hans, and Chuie
stepped out of the wounded bird and surveyed
what was to be their home for at least a few more
quarters.
"Well," said the ever-practical Hans, "let's get
something to eat."
"Yeah!" agreed Luke enthusiastically. "And
maybe we can learn some French too!"
The four walked into the French house and
looked around. They had never seen such a
grotesque collection of beings in their lives; ugly
undergraduians, Klingons, and far too many
Angeleans. But they decided to brave it, and sat
down at a crowded table with great caution.
"Hi," said a native, tossing a used napkin into
Luke's soup and splattering du jour all over his
clean white silks. "What's your name?"
Luke did not realize this was the locals'friendly
way of greet'ng strangers. He should have tossed
his napkin back, but instead he went for his laser
sword. Hans chuckled, stopped Luke before he
lopped the poor creatures head off, and led the
four to a table far far away. The four crowded to
gether each day in this fashion.
"Hey," one native said to another one day,
"let's make them paranoid." So that day at lunch
40 residents and six other eating associates all
crowded around one table, threw napkins into one
another's soup, and served the four last.
Johnnie Ray Gun was the house manager. He
was elected on the basis of his strong foreign poli
cy. "Keep strong ties with our natural allies, Haus
Mittle Europa and the Italian House," he said.
"Continue recognition of Okada while main
taining strong traditional ties with the Okada cot
tage. Get the Cubans out of Ujamaa, and draw the
line in Zapata," he proclaimed to the cheers of the
masses. But first he had to clean up his own house,
balance the budget, cut fees by 10 percent for each
of the next three years, and get the housing office
off his back.
Johnnie Ray got up to speak at dinner. He was
wearing a respectable Republican cloth three
piece suit, and carried a respectable Republican
clipboard. He was the law in this lawless corner of

the galaxy. Sometimes he had to be tough.
"The kitchen is a mess,'' Johnnie Ray said
again. "On weekends people leave the peanut but
ter out, and we have roaches that love peanut but
ter. People leave their dishes to be washed by
somebody else. Some eating associates have not
been busing their dishes."
With this Luke leaped across the room and with
a swish of his laser sword slashed Johnnie's clip
board in half. When one is fighting the forces of
evil in the galaxy, he cannot afford to have his
name blackened by the accusation of not having
bused his dishes. Luke was upset, but Johnnie Ray
was unflappable, even in the face of laser fire.
Johnnie Ray calmly explained, "There happen
to be six other eating associates. We evidently all
look alike to you sir. The others have made an ef
fort to be friendly to us. We gladly reciprocate.
You are free to stay here as long as you like, but
you too must follow the rules." Johnnie threw his
napkin disdainfully into Luke's soup and walked
away.
Not much later the finest in the land gathered at
the French House. The French Consulate and his
gang from San Francisco came down. All the
French professors and all the students from the
planet of the frog gathered at our humble abode.
Not a word of English could be heard anywhere.
French was spoken universally, except by a some
what hairy winetender who could have easily con
versed with Chuie. But the four took their plates
and wine and sat apart. With creatures far above
their regular repast companions the four still
stayed aloof.
So the quarter ended and the four searched for a
new watering hole. No hard feelings guys. We
hope you save the universe, and may the force be
with you.
As for us, we try to survive this poor excuse for
a planet as best we can, without taking ourselves
too seriously, and occasionally degenerating into
some real fear and loathing. Come and visit us if
you dare. If you do, a word of advice: Guard your
soup.

again. "On weekends people leave the peanut but
ter out, and we have roaches that love peanut but
ter. People leave their dishes to be washed by
somebody else. Some eating associates have not
been busing their dishes."
With this Luke leaped across the room and with
a swish of his laser sword slashed Johnnie's clip
board in half. When one is fighting the forces of
evil in the galaxy, he cannot afford to have his
name blackened by the accusation of not having
bused his dishes. Luke was upset, but Johnnie Ray
was unflappable, even in the face of laser fire.
Johnnie Ray calmly explained, "There happen
to be six other eating associates. We evidently all
look alike to you sir. The others have made an ef
fort to be friendly to us. We gladly reciprocate.
You are free to stay here as long as you like, but
you too must follow the rules." Johnnie threw his
napkin disdainfully into Luke's soup and walked
away.
Not much later the finest in the land gathered at
the French House. The French Consulate and his
gang from San Francisco came down. All the
French professors and all the students from the
planet of the frog gathered at our humble abode.
Not a word of English could be heard anywhere.
French was spoken universally, except by a some
what hairy winetender who could have easily con
versed with Chuie. But the four took their plates
and wine and sat apart. With creatures far above
their regular repast companions the four still
stayed aloof.
So the quarter ended and the four searched for a
new watering hole. No hard feelings guys. We
hope you save the universe, and may the force be
with you.
As for us, we try to survive this poor excuse for
a planet as best we can, without taking ourselves
too seriously, and occasionally degenerating into
some real fear and loathing. Come and visit us if
you dare. If you do, a word of advice: Guard your
soup.

The Millennium Falcon broke down in a remote
corner of the galaxy. Luke, Leah, Hans, and Chuie
stepped out of the wounded bird and surveyed
what was to be their home for at least a few more
quarters.
"Well," said the ever-practical Hans, "let's get
something to eat."
"Yeah!" agreed Luke enthusiastically. "And
maybe we can learn some French too!"
The four walked into the French house and
looked around. They had never seen such a
grotesque collection of beings in their lives; ugly
undergraduians, Klingons, and far too many
Angeleans. But they decided to brave it, and sat
down at a crowded table with great caution.
"Hi," said a native, tossing a used napkin into
Luke's soup and splattering du jour all over his
clean white silks. "What's your name?"
Luke did not realize this was the locals'friendly
way of greet'ng strangers. He should have tossed
his napkin back, but instead he went for his laser
sword. Hans chuckled, stopped Luke before he
lopped the poor creatures head off, and led the
four to a table far far away. The four crowded to
gether each day in this fashion.
"Hey," one native said to another one day,
"let's make them paranoid." So that day at lunch
40 residents and six other eating associates all
crowded around one table, threw napkins into one
another's soup, and served the four last.
Johnnie Ray Gun was the house manager. He
was elected on the basis of his strong foreign poli
cy. "Keep strong ties with our natural allies, Haus
Mittle Europa and the Italian House," he said.
"Continue recognition of Okada while main
taining strong traditional ties with the Okada cot
tage. Get the Cubans out of Ujamaa, and draw the
line in Zapata," he proclaimed to the cheers of the
masses. But first he had to clean up his own house,
balance the budget, cut fees by 10 percent for each
of the next three years, and get the housing office
off his back.
Johnnie Ray got up to speak at dinner. He was
wearing a respectable Republican cloth three
piece suit, and carried a respectable Republican
clipboard. He was the law in this lawless corner of

the galaxy. Sometimes he had to be tough.
"The kitchen is a mess,'' Johnnie Ray said
again. "On weekends people leave the peanut but
ter out, and we have roaches that love peanut but
ter. People leave their dishes to be washed by
somebody else. Some eating associates have not
been busing their dishes."
With this Luke leaped across the room and with
a swish of his laser sword slashed Johnnie's clip
board in half. When one is fighting the forces of
evil in the galaxy, he cannot afford to have his
name blackened by the accusation of not having
bused his dishes. Luke was upset, but Johnnie Ray
was unflappable, even in the face of laser fire.
