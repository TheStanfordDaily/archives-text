## Opinions Lighty/Ansell Endorse progressive alliance assessment 
### 
President Donald Kennedy's
recent comments to the Aca
demic Senate (Daily, Apr. 4)
concerning the Reagan Admin
istration's cuts in the education
budget illuminated Washing
ton's disregard of student
needs. Stanford students and
college students across the
country must begin to identify
themselves as part of a consti
tuency that will oppose Rea
gan's militarism, reactionary
morality, and social ir
responsibility.
Collective student action for
social change can receive a tre
mendous boost Apr. 15 and 16.
This year the ASSU election
ballot contains a fee assessment
for the Stanford Progressive Al
liance (SPA). We encourage all
students to support this request.
SPA was formed in the
autumn of 1980 in order to in
itiate more communication and
coordination among student or
ganizations working for social
change. Many of these groups
have endorsed the SPA fee
assessment. These include the
Committee on Hunger, Stanford
Pro-Choice Alliance, El
Salvador Solidarity Committee,
Stanford Against Conscription,
the Democratic Socialist Or
ganizing Committee, the Stan
ford Women's Center, and the
Black Student Union.
Throughout this academic
year, SPA has undertaken ac
tivities that encourage the de
velopment of a progressive
coalition. In November the
Progressive Alliance sponsored
an Election Rejection rally and
march protesting the illusion of
electoral choice. Five hundred

people turned out to voice their
political discontent. The march
set forth a positive principle for
progressive action: social
change must extend beyond
electoral politics.
In light of the need for broad
collective action, SPA or
ganized panel discussions dur
ing autumn quarter. These
educational meetings were de
signed to inform interested stu
dents, faculty and staff about
the interconnections between
progressive issues. Feminists,
Minorities and Workers
gathered to exchange their
thoughts and perspectives.
During winter quarter, SPA
broadened its effort to stimu
late political awareness. In con
junction with the Stanford Com
mittee on Political Education
(SCOPE), the Progressive Al
liance sponsored a speaker
series entitled "What Now
America: a progressive
analysis and strategy for the
80's." In the series, a variety of
professors, labor leaders and
community activists for
mulated alternative political
goals. The forums were well-at
tended indicating diverse, wide
spread participation in social
activism.
The request for a fee
assessment represents an effort
to increase SPA's potential and
effectiveness. The number of
student organizations dedicated
to social change is large. Yet
their membership relative to
the Stanford community re
mains small. Increased funding
would allow SPA to stimulate
the individual committment
necessary for a campus politi

cal culture.
The money from the fee
assessment would fund a varie
ty of organizing efforts. Specific
projects include publishing a bi
weekly newsletter linking the
member groups, establishing a
progressive speaker series as a
regular winter quarter event,
and conducting a campus wide
residential outreach program.
Furthermore, the fee
assessment could fund the ac
tivities of various groups as
those events become organized.
The increased funding available
for progressive groups can only
enhance the on-going discussion
of world events. In a varied and
sophisticated academic com
munity such as Stanford, con
structive social analysis and ac
tion are fundamental.
The Progressive Alliance is a
stable organization. Its efforts
will continue to rouse political
awareness at Stanford. The
groupg that belong to SPA share
a common understanding of how
specific issues exist as planks in
a broad platform for human de
velopment. Each individual's
right to self-development in an
equitable and democratic socie
ty is basic to SPA's perspective.
In America as in El Salvador, a

healthy social order required
citizen participation in the for
mulation of public policy. Fun
damentally, the Progressive Al
liance encourages all concerned
people to take action through
any of the many groups at Stan
ford and elsewhere.
In a variety of ways, students
must cope with an increasingly
volatile and inhuman social or
der. Today the government in
Washington seems committed
to social neglect and global
brinksmanship. All citizens dis
trubed by Reagan'sdesregardof
the underprivileged and politi
cally vulnerable must collec
tively initiate change.
Stanford students have a
stake in the analysis and resolu
tion of this country's pressing
problems. Through support of
the Stanford Progressive Al
liance students can stimulate
constructive, collective politi
cal action. This support can be
gin next Wednesday and Thurs
day with a vote for the SPA fee
assessment.
