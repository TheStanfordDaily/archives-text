## Tight grading policy 'merely intensifies' competition 
### 
I am writing because I take exception to some of the
things Michael Selmi brought up in his column (Daily,
Apr. 2).
First, if what Selmi says is true, graduate schools
and employers are already ignoring our grades and con
centrating on other methods of evaluation; our tran
scripts are treated roughly the same way as are "in
novative" ones. In this regard, no-grade transcripts are
very viable. The most likely reason for their non-accep
tance at Stanford is that the traditional grade system is
much easier. There isn't any personal commitment in
volved; grading can be "objective.'' In fact, the student
may be a member of a faceless crowd, since no one
needs to know a student well enough to say anything
meaningful about him — just put a grade on a piece of
paper
The traditional system's potential for dehumaniza
tion is demonstrable. A system involving personal per
formance evaluation instead of grades would be a
slower but "humanizing'" process that I believe is quite
desirable.
Second, asking for (or giving) a grade of no credit
rather than a D is not just a way of preserving a pretty
transcript. It allows students to retake courses that
they were not prepared to deal with the first time
around. Since a D grade is marginal, like grudgingly

being allowed to pass, this is not bad at all. A D should
be changed to NC if either the student or the professor
feels that the performance being evaluated is unaccep
table.
Third, some of the classes that give many A s are jus
tified in doing so, because the demands put on the stu
dents constitute exceptional performance if met. For
example, one class requires a project which "can easi
ly take 100 hours" (in fact, many of them take a good
deal more than 100) in order to complete the course.
This hundred-plus hours is mostly done in May and
June, after sufficient knowledge about the subject has
been gained.
Clearly, just completing the course is an exceptional
performance, and most of the people who do complete
it deserve A s. In a class where the demands made are
very high, the notion of "too many A s" is absurd. The
definition of exceptional should not be taken to mean
"only a few people in the class. "
Fourth, regarding pride in A grades, there is rarely
any doubt about whether an A grade is deserved or not.
In fact, it doesn't even matter what the grade is — if
someone did work (s)tie feels is a good effort even a C
can be a source of pride.
The grading policy should not be tightened. This

would merely intensify the competitive atmosphere
here. The "truly deserving" that Selmi speaks of would
be the victors in a long, grueling event, and the rest
would be the vanquished.
There are far more important things than a gold
medal in a scholastic decathelon; a gold medal is an
honor, but it is an honor given to the person who excels
at something that people do not really need to be good
at. The saying "the thrill of victory, the agony of de
feat, the human drama of athletic competition" should
stay where it belongs — in the living room, on Sunday
afternoons.
