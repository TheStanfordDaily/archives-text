## National News Budget Committee deals setback to Reagan plan 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The
House Budget Committee, over
riding Republican protests, re
jected President Ronald Rea
gan's overall budget proposals
yesterday and moved toward
adoption of a Democratic plan
that assumes a smaller deficit,
more spending on social pro
grams and less on defense than
the administration recom
mended.
The vote was 17 to 13 to reject
Reagan's overall budget plan,
with all the "no" votes cast by
Democrats. All 12 Republicans
on the committee and one Dem

ocrat, Rep. Phil Gramm of Tex
as, supported the president.
The vote, which represented
the biggest defeat for the Rea
gan economic program in either
house of Congress, came after
Rep. Delbert Latta (R-Ohio)
said the committee was decid
ing "whether the president's
program is going to get off the
ground."
Committee aides said they
expected Democrats to use
their majority in committee to
approve the alternative Demo
cratic plan later today.
That alternative calls for a

balanced budget in 1983, one fis
cal year ahead of the Reagan
plan. But it rejects the adminis
tration's proposal for a three
year, across-the-board tax cut
of 30 percent, substituting a less
expensive one-year reduction
instead.
The vote came as the Budget
Committee began the task of es
tablishing guidelines for Con
gress to follow for the next fis
cal year. Aides said the commit
tee would spend much of the
week reviewing the federal
budget virtually program by
program.
But the first step in that proc
ess was adoption of an overall
set of guidelines and the ques
tion came down to either Rea
gan's or the alternative pro
posed Monday by the Demo
crats.
The Democratic blueprint en
visions spending in the 1982 fis
cal year of $713.5 billion and a
deficit of $24.6 billion.
