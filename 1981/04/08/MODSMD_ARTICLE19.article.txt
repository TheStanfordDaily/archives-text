# Young plans to join Atlanta mayor race

Atlanta (AP) â€” Andrew Young, who rose with the civil rights
movement to become ambassador to the United Nations, says he
will try to become mayor of Atlanta because "there is no more ex
citing job in politics than trying to make cities work well."
The 49-year-old Young announced on Monday his candidacy for
the post now held by Maynard Jackson, telling supporters Atlanta
needs more jobs, more industrial development and more housing.
The former aide to assassinated civil rights leader, Martin Lu
ther King Jr., said the unsolved slayings and disappearances of 25
young blacks in the area since mid-1979 should not be an issue in the
campaign.
"Our objective is not to put the city on trial or the police on trial,"
said Young, who is black. "Our objective is to catch the killers and
put them on trial."
Young, an ordained minister, rose to prominence during the civil
rights movement of the 19605. He later defeated a conservative Re
publican to represent an Atlanta district in Congress.
After fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter was elected president in
1976, Young resigned from Congress to accept an appointment as
U.N. ambassador.
He held that post for two years, provoking a series of con
troversies with his outspoken comments on a variety of subjects. He
resigned under fire after holding an unauthorized meeting with a
representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Jackson, who is completing his eighth year as Atlanta's first
black mayor, is barred from seeking a third term.
