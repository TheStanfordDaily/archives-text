# Nature's long-time friend Brower teaches course
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff 
He is a "drop-out Presbyterian"
who worships the wilderness — a drop
out from Berkeley who is a guest pro
fessor at Stanford this quarter. He is a
soldier battling to perserve the en
vironment and the commanding of
ficer who founded Friends of the
Earth.
"He" is David Brower, the so
called "archdruid" of the conserva
tion movement.
Brower, a native of California since
his birth in 1912, is a virtual human en
cyclopedia when it comes to a topic re
lated to the environment. A giant
within the conservation community,
his manner is quiet, humble, laced
with humor, inviting. Listening to his
lecture to his course titled "Earth Is
land: Getting From Here to 2001" is
like listening to your grandfather. It is
a gentle conversation ranging from a
rebuttal of James Watts' policies to an
anecdote from his childhood that is
pertinent to the class.
His class, the first one he's taught
that is more than a one night lecture
engagement — a "one school stand" —
is offered through the Human Biology
department. Like John Anderson's
course offered through political sci
ence, this is the first time a guest pro
fessors' class was granted accredita
tion through an official University de
partment. Previously, the arrange
ments were made entirely through
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops on Po
litical and Social Issues).
Kathy Doi of the ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board was instrumental in
negotiating an agreement between
Brower and the Board. She worked
with Joel Horn, a second year Busi
ness School student who solicited an
additional $10,000 to add to the $3000
provided by the ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board.
Doi and Horn teamed up with Greg
Serrurier, Brower's assistant and
T.A. for the class, to finalize the
agreement. All three expressed ex
citement over Brower's class.
"He's touching a lot of people in a
unique way," said Serrurier.
Brower acknowledges and wel
comes his influential role on campus.
He hopes his class will help guarantee
that "there is another generation the
age of the present class that will be
grateful for what this class has done."
Horn mentioned the need for the en
vironmentalist movement of the
future to incorporate the professional
skills taught at the business school
with the "old school" encompassed by
Brower. "It's exciting to see him ad
dressing the GSB students; he's pass
ing on the reins," Horn said.
Brower's podium is neither soap
box nor tower, yet he is not hesitant to
share his political opinions. He warns
of the consequences of the Adminis
tration's policies on the environment
with a specific concern directed at In

terior Secretary James Watt.
"We've never been challenged as
we have been by Watt and his
friends," he cautions quietly.
This criticism is voiced less guard
edly in a personal dialogue. Brower
commented: "The President and the
Administration are driving on a free
way that leads to a bridge that is out
and they are not saving us by tearing
down the warning signs. No one wants
unnecessary regulations but the
future can not yet depend on the good
will of the corporate mind — not so
long as the corporate mind must con
centrate on this year's bottom line."
Though his convictions often reveal
distressing assessments of the future
of our world, Brower will pause in the
midst of lecture to read some Thoreau
or philosophy delivering the audience
from a dismal crevice. He captures an
optimistic idealism as he insists it is
possible to reconcile our national
energy needs with the preservation of
a wilderness he calls "the geography
of hope."
Brower is a realist however. The ac
ceptance of U.S. dependence on
energy to function is verbalized read
ily; then the realism takes a stance:
"We do not have enough energy to sus
tain our present infatuation with
mobility," he states.
Brower favors the research and de
velopment of renewable energy
sources. He supports a much greater
employment of solar power to provide
energy. He mentions — as evidence —
an estimate that the sun provides
more energy every two weeks than ex
ists in all recoverable fossil fuels in
the earth today.
Brower is no stranger to criticism
or confrontation and he handles both
with intelligent answers and a calm
manner that could predictably in
furiate those who oppose his view.
"I can be agitated," he said smiling,
"but I respect the rights of others to
arrive at their own conclusions. I just
hope I can show them the error of their
ways," he concluded, the smile wider.
He admitted that he has picked up
"more biases and a few truths. The
truth is elusive, you have to keep at
it."
His students seemed to appreciate
this modest, yet incredibly creden
tialed mouthpiece for the environ
ment and the coalition to preserve it.
"He is a dedicated individual with a
great knowledge of what he believes
in. He's sensitive enough not to dis
courage alternative points of view,"
remarked Gary Fremerman, a senior
in the course.
All the questions, articles, lecturing
and debate might become a bit com
plicating for someone else. But David
Brower sees the earth in a simple way.
"For the past three and a half
billion years, that is where life learned
to live. We had better keep the en
cyclopedia intact."

the earth today.
Brower is no stranger to criticism
or confrontation and he handles both
with intelligent answers and a calm
manner that could predictably in
furiate those who oppose his view.
"I can be agitated," he said smiling,
"but I respect the rights of others to
arrive at their own conclusions. I just
hope I can show them the error of their
ways," he concluded, the smile wider.
He admitted that he has picked up
"more biases and a few truths. The
truth is elusive, you have to keep at
it."
His students seemed to appreciate
this modest, yet incredibly creden
tialed mouthpiece for the environ
ment and the coalition to preserve it.
"He is a dedicated individual with a
great knowledge of what he believes
in. He's sensitive enough not to dis
courage alternative points of view,"
remarked Gary Fremerman, a senior
in the course.
All the questions, articles, lecturing
and debate might become a bit com
plicating for someone else. But David
Brower sees the earth in a simple way.
"For the past three and a half
billion years, that is where life learned
to live. We had better keep the en
cyclopedia intact."


David Brower
He is a "drop-out Presbyterian"
who worships the wilderness — a drop
out from Berkeley who is a guest pro
fessor at Stanford this quarter. He is a
soldier battling to perserve the en
vironment and the commanding of
ficer who founded Friends of the
Earth.
"He" is David Brower, the so
called "archdruid" of the conserva
tion movement.
Brower, a native of California since
his birth in 1912, is a virtual human en
cyclopedia when it comes to a topic re
lated to the environment. A giant
within the conservation community,
his manner is quiet, humble, laced
with humor, inviting. Listening to his
lecture to his course titled "Earth Is
land: Getting From Here to 2001" is
like listening to your grandfather. It is
a gentle conversation ranging from a
rebuttal of James Watts' policies to an
anecdote from his childhood that is
pertinent to the class.
His class, the first one he's taught
that is more than a one night lecture
engagement — a "one school stand" —
is offered through the Human Biology
department. Like John Anderson's
course offered through political sci
ence, this is the first time a guest pro
fessors' class was granted accredita
tion through an official University de
partment. Previously, the arrange
ments were made entirely through
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops on Po
litical and Social Issues).
Kathy Doi of the ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board was instrumental in
negotiating an agreement between
Brower and the Board. She worked
with Joel Horn, a second year Busi
ness School student who solicited an
additional $10,000 to add to the $3000
provided by the ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board.
Doi and Horn teamed up with Greg
Serrurier, Brower's assistant and
T.A. for the class, to finalize the
agreement. All three expressed ex
citement over Brower's class.
"He's touching a lot of people in a
unique way," said Serrurier.
Brower acknowledges and wel
comes his influential role on campus.
He hopes his class will help guarantee
that "there is another generation the
age of the present class that will be
grateful for what this class has done."
Horn mentioned the need for the en
vironmentalist movement of the
future to incorporate the professional
skills taught at the business school
with the "old school" encompassed by
Brower. "It's exciting to see him ad
dressing the GSB students; he's pass
ing on the reins," Horn said.
Brower's podium is neither soap
box nor tower, yet he is not hesitant to
share his political opinions. He warns
of the consequences of the Adminis
tration's policies on the environment
with a specific concern directed at In

terior Secretary James Watt.
"We've never been challenged as
we have been by Watt and his
friends," he cautions quietly.
This criticism is voiced less guard
edly in a personal dialogue. Brower
commented: "The President and the
Administration are driving on a free
way that leads to a bridge that is out
and they are not saving us by tearing
down the warning signs. No one wants
unnecessary regulations but the
future can not yet depend on the good
will of the corporate mind — not so
long as the corporate mind must con
centrate on this year's bottom line."
Though his convictions often reveal
distressing assessments of the future
of our world, Brower will pause in the
midst of lecture to read some Thoreau
or philosophy delivering the audience
from a dismal crevice. He captures an
optimistic idealism as he insists it is
possible to reconcile our national
energy needs with the preservation of
a wilderness he calls "the geography
of hope."
Brower is a realist however. The ac
ceptance of U.S. dependence on
energy to function is verbalized read
ily; then the realism takes a stance:
"We do not have enough energy to sus
tain our present infatuation with
mobility," he states.
Brower favors the research and de
velopment of renewable energy
sources. He supports a much greater
employment of solar power to provide
energy. He mentions — as evidence —
an estimate that the sun provides
more energy every two weeks than ex
ists in all recoverable fossil fuels in
the earth today.
