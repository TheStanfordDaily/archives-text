# Problems force space shuttle off schedule

Cape Canaveral, Fla. (AP) —
Launch crews sacrificed a full
shift rest period yesterday as
back-to-back problems created
a 10-hour logjam of work in
preparation for the dawn liftoff
of the new space shuttle Colum
bia.
"We're taking a little longer
to make sure it's right," said
test director Bill Schick. "At
this time there is no trouble
meeting a launch at 6:50 a.m.
(EST) Friday."
Problems put preparations 10
hours behind in the finely tuned

countdown to launch.
Schick said six hours would be
borrowed from a future "hold"
in the countdown — a period
when no activity is scheduled —
and added to the planned eight
hour hold yesterday. This would
provide a total 14 hours to clear
the backup and put the
countdown back on schedule.
To get accustomed to an early
wake-up on launch day,
astronauts John Young and Rob
ert Crippen have been gradually
adjusting their sleep cycles —
going to sleep earlier and get
ting up earlier each day. Last
Saturday, wakeup was 4:45 a.m.
On Sunday it was 4:15. On Mon
day 3:45. On Thursday and
launch day the call will come at

2:05 a.m.
The Columbia is the first
spaceship designed to make re
peated trips into space, using re
plenishable booster rockets and
an expendable external fuel
tank. The boosters drop away
after 2 minutes of flight and are
recovered; the external tank
breaks up in the atmosphere
when it is released after BV2
minutes flight.
As launch day moved closer,
space agency officials worried
about the weather. Mission
rules require that the launch be
scrubbed if head winds and
cross winds are stronger than 10
knots at Cape Canaveral's
15,000-foot shuttle landing strip
— in the case the Columbia runs

into trouble achieving orbit and
has to return.
If weather or other problems
delay the launch more than six
hours beyond schedule Friday,
the liftoff is likely to be delayed
until Sunday because a 48-hour
turnaround period is required
once fuel has been pumped into
the tanks.
Air Force weathermen pre
dicted generally fair skies Fri
day, the temperature about 70,
and surface winds of 10 to 12
mph — lIV 2 to 14 knots.
All day yesterday, starting at
10 a.m., countdown clocks on
the launch pad and in the control
room 3V2 miles away, stood still
at 1 day, 14 hours and 30 minutes
as the catchup work proceeded.

From the beginning, the
countdown work lagged.
First, an engine valve popped
open without command. This
was fixed when technicians
found and bypassed a short
circuit in the electrical system.
Then, a valve in the ground
support equipment leaked and
the three hours it took to replace
idled most launch workers.
Then, early yesterday, over
night crews found contaminants
in the gas lines to Columbia's
fuel cells. Workmen had to re
peat a seven-hour effort to
purify the lines, and by noon the
hoses — which carry gaseous
oxygen and nitrogen — were de
clared clean.
