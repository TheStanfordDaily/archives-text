# Liberals fight to save voting act

### 
Washington (AP) — Liberal House and
Senate members are opening what they con
cede is an uphill battle to keep alive key ele
ments of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, a major
component of the federal government's civ
il rights machinery.
Previous proposals to refine methods of
ensuring that minorities have equal access
to the polls have cleared Congress with rela
tive ease.
But this year, a bipartisan group of sup
porters are confronted with a new conserva
tive political climate on Capitol Hill and the
opposition of Sen. Strom Thurmond, the Re
publican chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
"We know it will be difficult, especially
since only about one third of the Senate was

around during the civil rights debates of the
1960s and 705," said one senior Senate aide
who requested anonymity.
Sens. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and
Charles Mathias (R-Md.) and Rep. Peter
Rodino (D-N.J.) chairman of the House Ju
diciary Committee, planned to announce
legislation today to retain or toughen exist
ing enforcement powers in the 1965 law and
its subequent amendments in 1970 and 1975.
The law now is scheduled to expire in Au
gust 1982. Kennedy, Mathias and Rodino
want to extend it to 1992 to make sure it cov
ers the 1990 census.
The touchiest issue is a requirement that
nine states and parts of some others seek
Justice Department approval whenever
they change the rules for voting in local,

state or federal elections.
According to a Thurmond aide, the Sena
tor from South Carolina "believes that
more than enough time has passed to make
it no longer necessary to punish states."
South Carolina is among the states now
required to prove to the Justice Department
that they are not seeking to deprive blacks
and other minorities of their right to vote.
The others are Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Georgia, Virginia, Texas, New
Mexico and Arizona.
In addition, parts of Maine, Idaho, Flori
da, California, New York, Colorado, Michi
gan, Wyoming, South Dakota, Oklahoma
and Hawaii, are monitored by the Justice
Department.
