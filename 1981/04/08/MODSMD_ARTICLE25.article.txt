# Carbon-monoxide levels may be decliningon El Camino Real

### Adam Berns 
A study conducted on El
Camino Real by a team here has
found that carbon monoxide e
missions from automobile ex
hausts may have decreased in
recent years.
Wayne Ott, a senior environ
mental engineer for the En
vironmental Protection Agen
cy, and Neil Willits, a post-doc
toral fellow here, conducted the
study with the help of Paul
Switzer, chairman of the
statistics department. Wayne
Ott is on a two year research fel
lowship to study human ex

a week for one full year starting
in January 1980.
The type of study conducted
by this team is unique in nature
because it studies the actual
amount of carbon monoxide a
person can expect to be exposed
to in an everyday activity such
as driving a car. Most air pollu
tion monitoring is done by tak
ing ambient exposure readings
from fixed stations which are
often far below the actual
amount received by people. Ex
posure monitoring studies such
as the one conducted by this
Stanford team often turn out ex-

posure to air pollution and will
tocus on carbon monoxide ex
posure for drivers in automo
biles.
The researchers found carbon
monoxide levels of 8.6 parts per
million (ppm), which, although
less than previous studies,
comes very close to the federal
maximum of 9 ppm for an eight
hour exposure above which the
pollution level is considered un
safe.
The study was conducted on
an 11.8 mile course on El
Camino Real and 20 intersec
ttons were monitored. The El
Camino was chosen because of
its combination of heavy traffic
and many starts and stops. Ott
and Willits collected the data in
a red Volkswagen in which they
cruised the course almost twice

posure levels as much as five
times higher than those rec
orded at fixed stations.
Because of recent advances
in technology, the monitoring
instruments used in the study
are not only more accurate and
less expensive than devices
used in previous studies, but
they are also much smaller. In
stead of needing a van to carry
the equipment, the instruments
can now be carried by hand.
The results of this study gain
perspective when compared to
the last study, completed in
1967. At that time, the Public
Health Service, a forerunner of
the EPA, conducted studies
similar to the one on El Camino
in several major cities. Re
searchers gathered similar
amounts of data in short two and

three week periods. The results
indicated that Los Angeles had
the highest carbon monoxide
reading at 34 ppm while Houston
had the lowest level of carbon
monoxide at 14 ppm. The aver
age for all of the cities was a
reading of approximately 22
ppm.
In contrast, the findings of
this new study found average
carbon monoxide levels to be at
8.6 ppm, significantly less than
indicated in previous studies.
The El Camino study can not be
directly compared to the studies
done in 1967 because San Fran
cisco was not one of the cities
studied at that time. However,
Ott and Willits both felt the
magnitude of the difference to
be significant. Although both re
searchers conceded that more
studies should be done in this
area, they felt that carbon
monoxide levels today are prob
ably lower than they were in
1967. Ott further speculated that
"emission controls seem to be
responsible for this apparent
downward trend in carbon
monoxide levels."
According to the researchers,
the 8.6 ppm carbon monoxide
levels mean that a little less
than half of those people who
drive on El Camino for eight
hours or more will breathe
enough carbon monoxide to
equal or exceed federal safety
standards. This is important for
taxi or bus drivers, delivery
people, and others who travel up
and down El Camino all day.
The study also showed other
interesting facts:
— Carbon monoxide
emissions at stoplights were
slightly higher than in other lo
cations due to car acceleration.

—'Clunkers' or cars that were
poorly maintained often caused
carbon monoxide levels at in
tersections to soar above nor
mal levels.
—Rolling up the window has
virtually no effect on the
amount of pollution to which
one is exposed .
Ott and Willitts said that a
yearly inspection to identify the
bottom one percent of those ve
hicles giving off high amounts of
carbon monoxide would be one
way of decreasing the in
ordinately high amount of pollu
tion caused by those vehicles.

However, neither of them were
sure that such a measure would
be cost effective. They also sug
gested stricter monitoring of
cars on the road by police, using
devices similar to those in the
study.

Ott and Willits concluded by
saying that their study is impor
tant not only for its own find
ings, but also because it shows
how effective exposure
monitoring studies can be. Not
only are the instruments ex

tremely sensitive, but they also
measure exposure levels for
people driving much more ac
curately than fixed stations.
Both Ott and Willits strongly en
couraged more research to be
done in this field.
