# Defeat Mayotte, Gurfein in challenge match
## Davis, Bondurant move up ladder

The tension in the Maples Pavilion air
Tuesday afternoon was thicker than the
June fog over the Golden Gate. There was
little noise in the building, save for the whis
pers of a half-dozen uninvited spectators
and a noisy air conditioning fan creaking ov
erhead.
On the floor, where two doubles teams
were playing superb tennis, there was even
less noise. The two teams barely acknowl
edged one another. There was little shouting
of either epithets or encouragement.
This wasn't a tournament match; there
was no Pac-10 title, much less an NCAA ti
tle, on the line. As a matter of fact, it was
only an intrasquad match between Stan
ford's top two doubles teams. When it was
over, however, the two teams had traded
spots in the starting lineup in the countdown
toward this weekend's matchups against
USC and UCLA.
Scott Bondurant and Scott Davis moved
up to become the No. 1 doubles team with a
7-6, 6-3 decision over Tim Mayotte and Jim
Gurfein, who will move down to the No. 2
position.
Though tennis is the most individual of
team sports, there is nonetheless no other
event in team competition to rival the
challenge match. Teammate is pitted
against teammate, and for the best two-of
three sets, the player can't do any less than
try and wipe out his buddy as if he were the
enemy.

"I hate challenge matches. All the guys
hate challenge matches." coach Dick Gould
said afterwards. Gould sat in the umpire's
chair at midcourt, scribbling notes to be
used in post-match discussion.
Though it is far from foolproof, Gould
said that challenge matches are the "most
fair'' way of deciding who should play
where.
"There was a question in my mind as to
who the better team was," Gould said.
"Tim and 'Gurf have lost their last couple
of matches, and Scott and Scott have been
playing well lately. So you play a challenge
match and see what happens They might
play 10 more times and split, but in this case
Bondurant and Davis won."
The winners jumped out to a two-break
edge in the first set, but Gurfein and May
otte broke back twice, sending the set into
the tiebreaker, won 5-2 by Bondurant-Davis.
Gurfein and Mayotte broke Davis in the
opening game of the second set, but the win
ners fought back, breaking Gurfein twice
for the win.
Bondurant was pleased with the win, but
wanted to play down the results. "It was
great practice," the junior said. "It's really
intense out there, similar to a match. I re
spect them as a team,'' he said of his team
mates. "You've got to play your best to win.
It's important."
Gould said that often the play in a
challenge match is of a higher quality than
in match play against another school. "They

get to play someone they know. They're a
little looser than if they were getting in front
of all those people playing a big match."
Because of the uplift a challenge match
gives, the lineup is sometimes distorted, ac
cording to Gould. "I've played more guys
out of position because of challenge
matches than anything else. But it's the
fairest way," the coach said.
With practice as fierce as yesterday's
challenge match, the Cards should have no
problem getting ready for the Trojans and
Bruins, two of the top five teams in the na
tion. Gould said preparations were going
well, and that most importantly, there were
no lineup changes due to injuries.
However, there might be lineup changes
for strategic reasons. The top of the lineup
seems set, with Mayotte, Davis and Gurfein
as tough a 1-2-3 punch as there is.
If there is a change, it would be down un
der. Gould said last week that freshman
Mike Falberg would not stay at No. 6 for
long. Whether "for long" means by Friday
will be known by noon that day, when the
USC match begins.
