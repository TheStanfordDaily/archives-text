# Watson warms up for Masters
## 
### 
Augusta, Ga. (AP) — By almost any other stan
dards, it hasn't been a bad year at all.
But Tom Watson is considerably less than hap
py with his performance so far this season.
"I'm not disappointed with the year, but I'm
very disappointed with the way I've played," he
said before a practice round for the 45th Masters,
which begins tomorrow on the 7040 yards of roll
ing hills that make up Augusta National Golf Club
course.
There has been a sharp drop in the level of his
play and production.
Last year, for example, at this stage of the sea
son, Watson had won two tournaments, collected
$140,275 and finished 10th or better in five of seven
starts.
This year, he has not won, he has collected
160,214 and has been 10th or better in three of sev
en starts.
It is the first time in five seasons that Watson
comes to the Masters as a non-winner for the
year.
"I haven't played well enough to win." he said
with the frank, candid appraisal of his own game

that is customary for the man who has dominated
golf for the past four seasons.
In that period he has been the single, outstand
ing player in the game. In those four years he won
a record four consecutive Player of the Year des
ignations, led the money-winning list every sea
son and set records in the last three, took three
Vardon Trophies, and won 20 American tour
naments plus two of his three British Opens.
But it's been a different, much more frustrating
story this year. His game isn't as strong, and his
confidence is suffering.
"I'm lacking execution," Watson said. 'And
that, in turn, breeds lack of confidence.
"It goes back to mechanics. And your mechan
ics effect your confidence directly. If you play
well, you have lots of confidence. If you don't play
well, you don't have much confidence and you
start playing defensively."
The problem, he said, centers around his setup.
"I haven't felt comfortable at address for a
long, long time. My swing has been restricted. I'm
not getting the leverage I need."
