### Gray Maxwell 
A Canadian team, the
Seaspray from British Colum
bia, won the Western States
Lacrosse Tournament held at
Stanford over the weekend. The
Canadians (who play pro
fessional box lacrosse)
withstood a valiant comeback
attempt waged by the San Fran
cisco Lacrosse Club to win the
title game by a 10-9 score. Stan
ford was defeated by Golden
Gate in sudden death overtime,
but bounced back to trounce
Marin and Seattle. The
Cardinals now stand at 5-1 over
all. and are undefeated in col
legiate competition (1-0).
Senior attack Kirk Phelps

scored the first six Cardinal
goals in Saturday's contest with
Golden Gate. Golden Gate
maintained a lead throughout
the second half, but Phelp's
scoring and good defensive play
by the middies kept the margin
close. A Golden Gate penalty
late in the game allowed Stan
ford to go 'man up,' and with
less than 30 seconds to play in
the game, middie Chris Romer
bounced a shot past the Golden
Gate goalie to tie the score at
7-7.
Golden Gate, in turn, took ad
vantage of a Stanford penalty in
the opening moments of sudden
death overtime, and scored to
win 8-7.

Despite being out of the win
ners' bracket, Stanford played
later in the day, and destroyed
Marin 10-2. Maryland native
Denny Childs, in the goal for the
first time this season (he
wrestled during the winter),
recorded 14 saves and shut out
Marin in the second half. Phelps
and Romer led the Cardinal
scoring, with each player regis
tering three goals.
In a consolation game played
on Sunday, Stanford avenged a
loss to Seattle at last year's Pa
cific Northwest Tournament.
The Cardinals built a first half
5-1 lead through the scoring of
attackmen Phelps and
freshman Dave Gardner.

Seattle rallied briefly in the
second half, but goals by Scott
Farley, Dickie Taylor,
Gardner, and Steve Pierce al
layed any fears of a come-from
behind victory by Seattle.
Coach Sam Sadtler. though
disappointed by the opening
round loss to Golden Gate, was
nonetheless pleased with the
team's overall performance.
"We're getting off a lot of shots,
and our defensemen (Steve
Kuptz, Chuck Renner, Mark
Melberg, and Andy Shea) have
been playing super ball."
Phelps has proven to be the
offensive mainstay of the
Cardinals. He has 31 goals and
four assists through six games.
