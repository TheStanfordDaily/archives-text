# Cards stomp Sparts, set HR record
## 
### Steve Odell 
The Stanford baseball team traveled to San Jose State yesterday
for a road game, but they certainly didn't pay their hosts any re
spect. The Cards bashed out 25 hits, two of those home runs, to
eclipse the team record for roundtrippers in a season.
The pair of homers give the Cards 46 for the year as compared to
the previous mark of 45, set by the 1975 squad, which featured Tom
Guardino and Bruce Robinson. Building a 12-0 lead after the first
five innings, the Cards coasted to a 16-5 rout over the Spartans.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess wasunderstandably quiteexcited
about the offensive display his team put on in the south peninsula.
"We just had outstanding hitting,'' he said, in a bit of an under
statement. "We broke our team home run record, and there are still
20-some games to play. We had at least six or seven guys with two
hits or more."
Like a worn-out recording, John Elway was again the master
blaster for the Cardinals. Elway rapped out three hits, including the
homer that tied the record, a three-run job in the second inning. He
now leads the team in HRs with seven, and also picked up four RBIs
against the hapless Spartan pitching staff, who had to be showing
signs of shellshock after the merciless barrage of baseballs they
saw coming their way, (or flying over their heads.)
Dave Meier also pummeled the stitching off the ball, picking up
three hits, among those a double and the two-run blast which broke
the record, to help lead the Cards offensively.
Freshman Doug Gwaltney picked up the win, shutting out the
Sparts over the first three frames. He was relieved by Bob Boat
man, who was on the mound for four innings, until the lefty from
Ventura was spelled by Lee Cline and John Radtke, who pitched the
eighth and ninth innings respectively.
But while the Cards continue to murder the ball offensively, their
defense this season has been less than spectacular, as witnessed by
four errors in the game against the Spartans. "It wasn't that impor
tant today," Marquess said, obviously worried about the defensive
woes his team has been having, "but it is overall. We've got to start
playing better defense."
Marquess' biggest concern, however, has got to be the injury sta
tus of his pitching staff, as he prepares his team for a 3-game road
trip to USC.
"We've scheduled Steve Cottrell to start the first game and Paul
Grame the second, but after that we're not sure yet," the Card skip
per said. "We won't know until Wednesday whether or not Brian
Myers or Brian Mignano (both of whom have been hampered by
sore arms) will make the trip."
"USC is tough on us, too," he continued. "They have so many lef
thanded hitters — they'll probably start seven against us. And we're
predominantly a righthanded pitching team."
If the Cards can pound the hemisphere around like they did yes
terday in San Jose, Marquess might not have to worry too much
about the other facets of the game. "We're hitting the ball real well
right now," he admitted. "So hopefully we can keep it up down
there."
Stanford leaves for Los Angeles tomorrow for the series with the
Trojans, and has games scheduled for Thursday, Friday, and Satur
day in Watts.

The sight of Stanford's John Elway has to be a harrowing one for
opposing pitchers right now. Elway continued his hot streak at the
plate yesterday in Stanford's 16-5 victory over San Jose State as the
Cards eclipsed the team record for home runs In a season. Elway,
who has already rewritten several pages of the football records
book, is honing in on some baseball marks as well. Elway hit his sev
enth HR of the year yesterday to put him within reach of the individ
ual Stanford mark of 13 for a season.
