## It's Opening Day, feel it? 
### 
Without a doubt, Opening Day of the major
league baseball season is my favorite day of
the year. Christmas? It's too commercial, and
far too expensive. New Year's Eve? I feel too
sick the morning after. My birthday? Sure, I
get lots of presents and attention, but like
many people, I feel let down after it's over.
Opening Day, however, captures the best
aspects of each of these occasions while leav
ing out their negative elements. Watching your
favorite batter smash one off the wall is just as
exciting as sitting on Santa's lap. The energy
and noise of the huge crowd is more intoxicat
ing than any kind of alcohol — without any bad
side effects. And when Opening Day is over,
you don't have to wait another year to get your
thrills again, for 161 more games are soon to
follow.
Lots of people, of course, think baseball is
about as exciting as watching live escargots
compete in the 100-yard dash. That's OK. You
can't convince a person to like baseball any
more than you can convince Snow White to try
heroin. Either you like baseball right away, or
you don't.
Me, I loved baseball right away. In the very
first inning of the very first game I attended,
Bobby Bonds and Willie McCovey hit home
runs. During the next game I went to, then-
Montreal Expo manager Gene Mauch angrily
hurled his team's equipment — bats, gloves,
batting helmets, the works — onto the field.
Mature hitting and childish tantrums: that's
entertainment, sports fans.
Yet my day at the game is made even before
the first pitch is thrown. For as I enter the sta
dium, I'm greeted with the same sights, sounds
and smells that have pleasantly assailed my
senses since I was 10. They're secure refuges,
these ballparks — few things ever change
there. No matter how chaotic your life be
comes, you can always find order on your way
to the grandstand. \
Tomorrow, when I approach the turnstile for
the first time in 1981,1 know that the smiling,
wrinkled little gray-haired man will be selling
scorecards. Once I get inside the park, I know

I'll hear the monotonous yet often mellifluous
litany of the vendors:
"Souvenirs — hats, bats, pennants,
baseballs! Gitcher sooooo-venirs!"
"Scorecards — programs — lineups!
Scorecards — programs — lineups!"
"Cold beer, bottle of beer. . Hey, coooold
beer here!"
I know I'll see the usherettes, wearing their
ridiculous, unattractive orange and black out
fits. I know I'll see the same old ladies wearing
big straw hats decorated with buttons depict
ing their favorite players — usually the entire
team. I know I'll see the beer-swilling boors
and champagne-sipping socialites, the wide
eyed youngsters and the T-shirted teenagers.
They'll all be making noise, too, filling the
April air with happy babbling. Why shouldn't
they be happy? Baseball has returned.
It's gotten to the point where I take it for
granted that everybody is happy inside a
ballpark. That conviction was tested — and re
affirmed — by one of my best friends a couple
of years ago when we attended an early-season
game.
Driving up Highway 101 toward the ballpark,
my friend grew unusually silent.
Once we got to the stadium, I made my char
acteristic remarks about what a great game
this was going to be today. My friend gave a
disinterested response. "Is he mad at me?" I
wondered.
We took our customary trip to the concession
stand and made our standard initial purchase:
two hot dogs, one large Coca-Cola and one bag
of peanuts apiece (this proved that my friend'
didn't have indigestion). Still my companion
remained silent. "He's mad at me," I sadly t
concluded. "But what for?"
Suddenly my friend spoke. Looking around
at the filling grandstand, gazing at the emerald
field, he murmured, "God damn. Everytimel
come here, I love it."
My friend, then, was merely in an advanced
state of dreaminess, the kind of dreaminess a
lover might experience. For baseball lovers,
the trysts begin this week.

comes, you can always find order on your way
to the grandstand. \
Tomorrow, when I approach the turnstile for
the first time in 1981,1 know that the smiling,
wrinkled little gray-haired man will be selling
scorecards. Once I get inside the park, I know

I'll hear the monotonous yet often mellifluous
litany of the vendors:
"Souvenirs — hats, bats, pennants,
baseballs! Gitcher sooooo-venirs!"
"Scorecards — programs — lineups!
Scorecards — programs — lineups!"
"Cold beer, bottle of beer. . Hey, coooold
beer here!"
I know I'll see the usherettes, wearing their
ridiculous, unattractive orange and black out
fits. I know I'll see the same old ladies wearing
big straw hats decorated with buttons depict
ing their favorite players — usually the entire
team. I know I'll see the beer-swilling boors
and champagne-sipping socialites, the wide
eyed youngsters and the T-shirted teenagers.
They'll all be making noise, too, filling the
April air with happy babbling. Why shouldn't
they be happy? Baseball has returned.
It's gotten to the point where I take it for
granted that everybody is happy inside a
ballpark. That conviction was tested — and re
affirmed — by one of my best friends a couple
of years ago when we attended an early-season
game.
Driving up Highway 101 toward the ballpark,
my friend grew unusually silent.
Once we got to the stadium, I made my char
acteristic remarks about what a great game
this was going to be today. My friend gave a
disinterested response. "Is he mad at me?" I
wondered.
We took our customary trip to the concession
stand and made our standard initial purchase:
two hot dogs, one large Coca-Cola and one bag
of peanuts apiece (this proved that my friend'
didn't have indigestion). Still my companion
remained silent. "He's mad at me," I sadly t
concluded. "But what for?"
Suddenly my friend spoke. Looking around
at the filling grandstand, gazing at the emerald
field, he murmured, "God damn. Everytimel
come here, I love it."
My friend, then, was merely in an advanced
state of dreaminess, the kind of dreaminess a
lover might experience. For baseball lovers,
the trysts begin this week.
Without a doubt, Opening Day of the major
league baseball season is my favorite day of
the year. Christmas? It's too commercial, and
far too expensive. New Year's Eve? I feel too
sick the morning after. My birthday? Sure, I
get lots of presents and attention, but like
many people, I feel let down after it's over.
Opening Day, however, captures the best
aspects of each of these occasions while leav
ing out their negative elements. Watching your
favorite batter smash one off the wall is just as
exciting as sitting on Santa's lap. The energy
and noise of the huge crowd is more intoxicat
ing than any kind of alcohol — without any bad
side effects. And when Opening Day is over,
you don't have to wait another year to get your
thrills again, for 161 more games are soon to
follow.
Lots of people, of course, think baseball is
about as exciting as watching live escargots
compete in the 100-yard dash. That's OK. You
can't convince a person to like baseball any
more than you can convince Snow White to try
heroin. Either you like baseball right away, or
you don't.
Me, I loved baseball right away. In the very
first inning of the very first game I attended,
Bobby Bonds and Willie McCovey hit home
runs. During the next game I went to, then-
Montreal Expo manager Gene Mauch angrily
hurled his team's equipment — bats, gloves,
batting helmets, the works — onto the field.
Mature hitting and childish tantrums: that's
entertainment, sports fans.
Yet my day at the game is made even before
the first pitch is thrown. For as I enter the sta
dium, I'm greeted with the same sights, sounds
and smells that have pleasantly assailed my
senses since I was 10. They're secure refuges,
these ballparks — few things ever change
there. No matter how chaotic your life be
comes, you can always find order on your way
to the grandstand. \
