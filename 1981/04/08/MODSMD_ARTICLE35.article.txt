Middle East, told Secretary of State Alexander Haig yes
terday that "Israeli aggression" poses the prime danger

consensus" in the area against Soviet intentions, was ex

Kassem. said the U.S. secretary of state had been told in
"a clear, direct and amicable manner" that a Mideast
peace depends on a total Israeli withdrawal from occupied
Arab lands.
"Israel's intransigent policies and daily aggression
against the Palestinian people and the systematic con
fiscation of Arab land," as well as its actions in south Leb
anon. where it supports anti-Palestinian Christian
fighters, will lead to "a more dangerous and volatile situ
ation" in the region. Kassem said.

Reagan thanks wounded C.I. A. agent
Washington — President Reagan bade a thankful
farewell yesterday to the Secret Service agent credited
with saving his life eight days ago and then told FBI agents
what he could recall of those moments when he and three
other men were shot.
"I wish you well on your vacation and trip to Mexico and
I thank you from the bottom of my heart," a White House
statement quoted Reagan as telling Timothy McCarthy
when the agent stopped by on his way out of George Wash
ington University Hospital.
McCarthy took a bullet in the liver last Monday when he
stepped between a gunman and Reagan as they left the
Washington Hilton hotel. The head of the White House Se
cret Service detail told a Senate committee last week he
thinks McCarthy's action probably saved Reagan's life.
After McCarthy's brief visit, two unidentified FBI
agents interviewed the president for 28 minutes in his hos
pital suite.
Tuesday's medical bulletin said White House press sec
retary James S. Brady, shot through the brain, "sat up in a
chair twice yesterday. He can now drink by himself and is
eating solid foods on a regular basis."
Police officer Thomas Delahanty, wounded in the neck,
was reported in good condition at Washington Hospital
Center. His temperature was normal, but he was to re
main on antibiotics for 24 hours "as a precautionary meas
ure." Crime is no fun

Percent victimized by crime falls
Washington — A Justice Department report said yester
day that while the number of crimes has increased the per
centage of Americans victimized by crime has actually
declined slightly over the past six years.
The report, by the department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics, showed that 30 percent of the nation's 80.6 mil
lion households were victimized by one or more crimes
during 1980, down from the 31.3 percent in each of the last
three years. In 1975, when the bureau's National Crime
Survey began, 32 percent of U.S. households were touched
by some crime.
The report said that the six-year pattern shows consis
tent and pervasive crime. "A large minority of American
households experiences crime each year, although most of
them experience it in a non-violent form," the report said.
"There is great stability in the patterns from year to year,
while the trend for the period as a whole seems to be down
ward."
The report found that race had little to do with exposure
to crime, but that higher-income households were more
likely to be victimized by crime than low-income houO
holds, and that city and suburban residents were more

likely to be victimized than rural residents.
