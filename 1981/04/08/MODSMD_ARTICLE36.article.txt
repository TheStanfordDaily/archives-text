# Underage sex report law challenged
## 
### Denny Dart 
A new state law that which will re
quire doctors to make reports on mi
nors who may have had consensual
sexual activity is being challenged in
the courts and has received negative
reaction from local medical author
ities.
The state law, which took effect
with the turn of the new year, requires
"child care custodians, medical and
non-medical practitioners" to report
to the police all cases of suspected
consensual sexual activity by unmar
ried minors. It was passed as an
amendment to a bill proposing re
forms in child abuse reporting pro
cedures.
The constitutionality of the law,
which defines sexual intercourse in
volving minors as "sexual abuse." has
been challenged by the American Civil
Liberties Union of Northern Califor
nia.
In response to the suit, the Califor
nia Supreme Court issued a stay which
will postpone enforcement of the law
until its constitutionality is assessed.
The ACLU claims that although the
law intends to increase detection of
sexual abuse of children, it will only
hinder detection.
"Instances of true sexual abuse of
children will be buried under masses
of paper reporting consensual sexual
activity," according to ACLU at
torney Margaret Crosby.
The ACLU is also concerned with
the state-wide implications of the law,
which requires all medical, psy
chiatric, contraceptive and abortion
councelors as well as foster parents

and teachers with knowledge of sexual
activity by minors to file reports with
police.
The law would require Stanford's
Cowell Student Health Center doctors,
peer counselors and psychological
counselors to report sexually active
students who are 17 years old or '
younger. Maureen Doherty, who is in
charge of the peer contraceptive coun
seling for spring quarter, said she is
concerned by the law but does not feel
that it will be a problem for the coun
seling service.
Although several of the students
who come to Cowell are under eight
een, the counselors will not be in a
position to report them, she explained.
"For most counselling we don't even
ask names and ages," so we have no
information to report, Doherty said.
Records are only made for those
students who are refered to doctors.
"We have a policy of anonymity.
Students don't even have to walk in,
we will give contraceptive advice over
the phone," Doherty said.

The law poses more difficulty for
the doctors at Cowell who keep rec
ords including names and ages of their
patients. Doctor James McClenahan
at Cowell said that the major concern
is that students who know about the
law might be deterred from seeking
medical treatment.
"However, now that the stay has
been issued, we will carry on our nor
mal policy," he said.
Two laws affect policy at Cowell.
All cases of communicable disease
must be reported to the Health De
partment. And medical records are
not made available to parents of mi
nors because of a California State
"emancipated minor" law which pro
tects the privacy of records of minors
living away from home.
Reports filed under the "child
abuse" law would go to the local law
enforcement agency. According to
Palo Alto Police Detective Fred
Porras, the reports would be per
manently filed and investigation
would take place.
