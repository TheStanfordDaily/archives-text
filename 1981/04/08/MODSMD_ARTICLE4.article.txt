# Heart-lung patient is off the critical list
## 
### Lisa Hudson 
Heart-lung transplant patient Mary
Gohlke has been taken off the
"critical-but-stable" list by doctors,
and she is now considered to be in
"satisfactory" condition.
Gohlke, only the fourth heart-lung
transplant patient in history, is the
first to recover sufficiently to be con
sidered by doctors to be in satisfactory
condition. Doctors Bruce Reitz and
Norman Shumway said they are op
timistic about her progress.
It has been 31 days since Gohlke's

March 9 operation, breaking the old
survival record of 23 days.
Gohlke is described by Medical Cen
ter spokeswoman Bobbi Navickis as
"slowly recovering." She is reported
ly walking around the room, and is
gaining strength and stamina every
day. Her release from the hospital is
still undetermined as yet, but is ex
pected within six to eight weeks.
Gohlke faces a lengthy recovery peri
od, including intensive physical thera
py, as well as a lifetime routine of
anti-rejection drugs, the spokes

woman said.
Meanwhile, doctors Reitz and
Shumway yesterday okayed a new
candidate for a heart-lung transplant.
He is Charles Walker, a 30-year-old
undertaker from Binghamton, New
York. Walker, who is described by his
mother as having been "in and out of
hospitals all his life," was admitted to
Stanford University Medical Center
last Wednesday for evaluation,
Navickis said.
Cardiologists checked his heart
function by performing a catheteriza
tion, a process in which dye is injected
into the heart by means of a catheter
in order to take pictures of the heart.
In addition, pulmonary physicians
checked WaYker's lung function by tes
ting for specific amounts of certain
gases in his blood, measuring the
amount of tension in the pulmonary
vein, and by testing the exchange of
oxygen in the lungs. Walker has
pulmonary hypertension, a condition
caused by high blood pressure, where
the lungs resist the pumping of blood
by the heart into the lungs, damaging
both the heart and the lungs, accord
ing to Navickis.
Doctors approved Walker for the
dual transplant because no other
treatment would be effective, and
without the operation, Walker's life
expectancy would have been under six
months. Transplant of the heart only
would be undesirable because the
healthy new heart would begin pump
ing too much blood into Walker's
weakened lungs, the spokeswoman
said.

Walker, who was born with a hole in
the wall of his ventricle — the pump
ing chamber of the heart — had to dis
continue working two years ago due to
lung problems developed as a result of
his weak heart. He had been referred
by his doctor in New York to the Mayo
Clinic, where he was given an ex
tensive evaluation. Mayo doctors sent
Walker to Stanford for the operation
after other methods of treatment
failed, Navickis said.
In addition to the medical tests,
Walker has met several other criteria.
Potential transplant candidates must
be psychologically stable in order to
deal successfully with both expected
and unexpected difficulties, as well as
be prepared to follow a daily drug reg
imen for the rest of his/her life.
It is essential for a candidate to
have a stable, supportive home at
mosphere to aid in the recovery and
readjustment process. Part of the can
didate's evaluation process is a ses
sion with a social worker to ensure
that his mental preparation for the op
eration is sufficient, the spokes
woman said.
Walker is not in the hospital now,
but is residing in the area awaiting a
donor. After Gohlke was approved for
the operation, it was three weeks
before a donor was found. Donors
must be young, of a compatible blood
type, and have normal heart and
lungs, without a trace of infection or
chest injury, and so are difficult to lo
cate, Navickis said.

Meanwhile, doctors Reitz and
Shumway yesterday okayed a new
candidate for a heart-lung transplant.
He is Charles Walker, a 30-year-old
undertaker from Binghamton, New
York. Walker, who is described by his
mother as having been "in and out of
hospitals all his life," was admitted to
Stanford University Medical Center
last Wednesday for evaluation,
Navickis said.
Cardiologists checked his heart
function by performing a catheteriza
tion, a process in which dye is injected
into the heart by means of a catheter
in order to take pictures of the heart.
In addition, pulmonary physicians
checked WaYker's lung function by tes
ting for specific amounts of certain
gases in his blood, measuring the
amount of tension in the pulmonary
vein, and by testing the exchange of
oxygen in the lungs. Walker has
pulmonary hypertension, a condition
caused by high blood pressure, where
the lungs resist the pumping of blood
by the heart into the lungs, damaging
both the heart and the lungs, accord
ing to Navickis.
Doctors approved Walker for the
dual transplant because no other
treatment would be effective, and
without the operation, Walker's life
expectancy would have been under six
months. Transplant of the heart only
would be undesirable because the
healthy new heart would begin pump
ing too much blood into Walker's
weakened lungs, the spokeswoman
said.

Walker, who was born with a hole in
the wall of his ventricle — the pump
ing chamber of the heart — had to dis
continue working two years ago due to
lung problems developed as a result of
his weak heart. He had been referred
by his doctor in New York to the Mayo
Clinic, where he was given an ex
tensive evaluation. Mayo doctors sent
Walker to Stanford for the operation
after other methods of treatment
failed, Navickis said.
In addition to the medical tests,
Walker has met several other criteria.
Potential transplant candidates must
be psychologically stable in order to
deal successfully with both expected
and unexpected difficulties, as well as
be prepared to follow a daily drug reg
imen for the rest of his/her life.
It is essential for a candidate to
have a stable, supportive home at
mosphere to aid in the recovery and
readjustment process. Part of the can
didate's evaluation process is a ses
sion with a social worker to ensure
that his mental preparation for the op
eration is sufficient, the spokes
woman said.
Walker is not in the hospital now,
but is residing in the area awaiting a
donor. After Gohlke was approved for
the operation, it was three weeks
before a donor was found. Donors
must be young, of a compatible blood
type, and have normal heart and
lungs, without a trace of infection or
chest injury, and so are difficult to lo
cate, Navickis said.
