# Draft registration invading privacy?

### Jan Benjamin 
Dear Registrant: Is your privacy being violated?
If you are one of those who have received a letter ac
knowledging your registration with the Selective Ser
vice System, you may be pondering this same question.
Confusion among recipients of the letters has arisen
over the Selective Service requirement that men regis
tering for the draft provide their Social Security num
bers.
A series of court rulings has been attempting to de
termine the legality of a clause in letters acknowledg
ing registration with the Selective Service. That clause
reads:
"Selective Service law and regulations provide that
each registrant who has been issued a Social Security
account number must provide it to Selective Service.
Failure to provide it is a violation of the Military Selec
tive Service Act and could result in legal action."
According to Michael Miller of the the American Civ
il Liberties Union, this action violates a provision of the
Federal Privacy Act of 1974. The provision states no
government agency may use the Social Security for any
purpose unless authorized by Congress to do so

When Selective Service made mandatory the in
clusion of Social Security numbers on draft forms and
letters last summer, the ACLU last November sued for
and received, (Wohlman v. Rosker) an injunction
against the Selective Service System.
The U.S. Government appealed the case and won a
stay of the injunction, pending review of the case by the
U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D C.
According to Miller, the stay preserves the status
quo â€” men cannot be prosecuted for failing to provide
Social Security numbers when they register. "Anyone
who hasn't provided his number may want to wait until
the appeals court in Washington, D C. makes a ruling."
This advice may be helpful to many Stanford reci
pients of these letters who are confused as to whether
or not they must comply with the Selective Service de
mand, according to Matt Nicodemus, a Stanford
Against Conscription member.
Many students have complied with the Selective Ser
vice request. Steve Richardson, a freshman living in
Toyon, said he thought the demand for the Social Secur
ity number was "standard procedure."
