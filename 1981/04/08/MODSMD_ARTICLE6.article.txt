# Senate denies extra cash to women's collective

### Richard Klingler 
Last night, the ASSU Senate denied
additional funding for the Gay Peo
ple's Union (GPU) Women's Collec
tive and heard protest against upcom
ing Faculty Senate action on grade
policy changes.
Sharon Silverstein, speaking on
behalf of the GPU Women's Collec
tive, petitioned the Senate to raise
ASSU program fee funding from the
$750 approved during last week's Sen
ate meeting to the $1200 alloted for the
GPU to benefit gay men.
Silverstein claimed additional
funds are needed to meet gay women's
needs, to achieve equity with funding

for men, and to affect more "gay and
undecided women and sympathetic
members of the community."
In the past. GPU funds were avail
able to both men and women although
Silverstein claims that men controlled
the decision-making process. Silver
stein said that this year "the GPU is
dominated by men" and that GPU
funds are used for gay men's needs.
According to Silverstein, gay wom
en's needs will be funded through the
GPU Women's Collective, established
to facilitate the autonomy of the gay
women's community.
Senators questioned whether the
GPU Women's Collective served as
many people in the Stanford Com
munity as the GPU does, and many
Senators challenged the necessity of
the projects that might be undertaken
with additional funding. The motion to
increase funding for the Women's Col
lective was defeated 2-8-1.
Silverstein claimed that the funding
issue was handled poorly by the Sen
ate She said she understood that the
Senate would take no actioon on GPU
Women's Collective funding until this
week. The Senate Finance Commit
tee's funding report, including the $750
allotment, was passed last week.
Senate Chairman Doug Mitchell ad
mitted that Silverstein did not receive
sufficient information, but he said,
"we gave them a fair shake." He
pointed out that the proceedure
adopted guarenteed $750 to the GPU
Women's Collective and suggested
that had discussion been confined to
last night's meeting, the Collective
might have lost all ASSU funding.
Council of Presidents (COP) mem
ber Dayna Goldfine said it is "a bad
precedent to fund men more than
women." Silverstein said she would
continue to search for additional
funds.
Silverstein petitioned the Senate as
part of the Open Forum program,
which allows each of three speakers
from the Stanford Community to ad
dress the Senate. Kenneth Killiany, a
co-terminal history student, ad
dressed the Senate during Public Fo
rum on probable upcoming Faculty
Senate changes in University grading
policy.
Killiany said that the Faculty Sen
ate was almost certain to reinstate the
F notation on transcripts, possibly ac
ting as early as the Faculty Senate
meeting in \ate \pri\ (the transcript
changes would probably not take ef
fect until theJ.9B2-3 school year). He

also said that the pass
no credit option will be
standardized and will require an
earlier declaration.
Killiany argued against the pro
posed grade change and urged Senate
members to coordinate protest
against the proposed action. Calling
the notation a "major change in aca
demic policy," Killiamy said the F
would only hurt individuals and de
crease course experimentation
without bringing accompanying
positive changes.
In regular business, the Senate ap
proved portions of the fee assessment
section of the election brochure and
voted to add Senate members to the
body making Academic Organizations
Board (AOB) allocations.

Throughout the sparsely attended
meeting, the conduct of Senate busi
ness was jeopardized by the occasion
al lack of a quorum. The meeting
started 25 minutes late because a
quorum could not be achieved, and
during the meeting, discussion con
tinued during a 15 minute lapse of a
quorum.
Graduate Senator Dave Kraus com
plained that no written reports had
been submitted by any but the Rules
Committee and said that Senators
"shouldn't let the Senate slip into
these slipshod methods."
When the Senate passed the unwrit
ten reports over his objections, Kraus
left in protest, destroying the pre
carious quorum. A quorum was re
established when Dave Mendelkem,
another graduate Senator, arrived.
