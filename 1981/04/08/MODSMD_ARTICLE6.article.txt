Last night, the ASSU Senate denied
additional funding for the Gay Peo
ple's Union (GPU) Women's Collec
tive and heard protest against upcom
ing Faculty Senate action on grade
policy changes.
Sharon Silverstein, speaking on
behalf of the GPU Women's Collec
tive, petitioned the Senate to raise
ASSU program fee funding from the
$750 approved during last week's Sen
ate meeting to the $1200 alloted for the
GPU to benefit gay men.
Silverstein claimed additional
funds are needed to meet gay women's
needs, to achieve equity with funding

for men, and to affect more "gay and
undecided women and sympathetic
members of the community."
In the past. GPU funds were avail
able to both men and women although
Silverstein claims that men controlled
the decision-making process. Silver
stein said that this year "the GPU is
dominated by men" and that GPU
funds are used for gay men's needs.
According to Silverstein, gay wom

GPU Women's Collective, established
to facilitate the autonomy of the gay
women's community.
Senators questioned whether the
GPU Women's Collective served as
many people in the Stanford Com
munity as the GPU does, and many
Senators challenged the necessity of
the projects that might be undertaken
with additional funding. The motion to
increase funding for the Women's Col
lective was defeated 2-8-1.
Silverstein claimed that the funding
issue was handled poorly by the Sen
ate She said she understood that the
Senate would take no actioon on GPU
Women's Collective funding until this
week. The Senate Finance Commit
tee's funding report, including the $750
allotment, was passed last week.
Senate Chairman Doug Mitchell ad
mitted that Silverstein did not receive
sufficient information, but he said,
"we gave them a fair shake." He
pointed out that the proceedure
adopted guarenteed $750 to the GPU
Women's Collective and suggested
that had discussion been confined to
last night's meeting, the Collective
might have lost all ASSU funding.

precedent to fund men more than
