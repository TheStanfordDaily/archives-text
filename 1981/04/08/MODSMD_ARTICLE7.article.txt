## Science News Shuttle to launch a new age of space exploration... 
### Michael Simon 
Early Friday morning, hours
before most of us get up for
class, a peculiar-looking oblong
object will be launched into the
Florida sky, and history will be
made.
The Space Shuttle Columbia
will begin its maiden voyage,
opening up a new era of space
exploration.
The Space Shuttle, the
world's most sophisticated
flying machine, will finally
leave the launch pad after an ex
pensive ten years of develop
ment by the National Aero
nautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA).
For those who are too young
to remember, NASA is the gov
erment agency which made he
roes out of 1960's Air Force colo
nels by sending them on ex
pense-paid, two-week vacations
to the Moon.
Forced out of this business by
economists who deduced fifty
pounds of moon rocks were not
worth twenty billion dollars,
NASA was forced to change
course. The Space Shuttle

Transportation System, which
presently absorbs nearly two
thirds of NASA's research and
development funding. This mon
ey is probably being well spent.
Within twenty years, the
Space Shuttle could transform a
century of sciencefiction into
science fact. The fully reusable
Shuttle Orbiter will be launched
with two solid fuel rocket
boosters, which are also re
usable, and a large expendable
hydrogen fuel tank.
Carrying a crew of as many as
seven men and women, the
massive Orbiter has a cargo bay
the size of a box car, and will be
able to lift over 30 tons of pay
load into space. The Orbiter can
remain in space for up to a
month at a time, and after re
turning to Earth, can be re
furbished and readied for anoth
er mission within two weeks.
Our fleet of four Shuttle Or
biters, when completed, will
provide the United States with
as many as one hundred Shuttle
flights per year.
According to present plans,
the Space Shuttle will perform

three different types of mis
sions over the next ten years.
First, it will be used for the
launch and repair of artificial
satellites, as many as five of
which can fit into the Orbiter
cargo bay at one time. These
satellites include communica
tions, remote-sensing, naviga
tion, and military spy satellites,
as well as the futuristic "killer
satellites" which emit destruc
tive lasers and particle beams.
If it had not been for the Shut
tle's military applications, it
probably would have never been
developed. Two of the four Shut
tle Orbiters will belong to the
United States Air Force.
Secondly, the Shuttle will
function as an in-space labora
tory and observatory. The Or
biter cargo bay will be outfitted
with the four-man Spacelab for
as many as fifty scientific mis
sions during the 1980's.
A giant Space Telescope is
scheduled for a Shuttle launch in
1983; it will be the most pow
erful astronomical instrument
ever built.
These missions are expected

to greatly enhance our under
standing of the evolution of the
Universe, and will provide use
ful information on the effects of
the space environment on living
systems.
Finally, the Space Shuttle will
provide the support required for
the construction of large space
platforms and structures. This
is perhaps the most important,
if not the most interesting of the
tasks for which the Space Shut
tle was designed.
Utilizing building methods
presently being developed at
NASA's Langley Research Cen
ter, a small crew will be able to
fabricate structures several
miles in length within the dura
tion of a single Shuttle mission.
Such large space structures
will permit the initiation of
space manufacturing and habi
tation, perhaps as early as 1985.
The possible uses for large
space structures technology are
fascinating. Within five years,
for example, the Shuttle could
launch communications plat
forms, for a personal com
munications system which
could eventually make tele
phones obsolete. Such a system
was designed during a NASA
"brain-storming session" in
1979. Its worldwide users would
be able to communicate instant
ly via satellite-linked
"wristwatch telephones,"
which might cost less than a
penny a minute to operate.
A Space Shuttle crew could
assemble a large permanently
manned space station within a
matter of weeks. A NASA study
in 1977 determined that one of
the Shuttle's external hydrogen
tanks could be tugged into orbit,
and refurbished to function as a
space habitat which could sup
port a crew of thirty.
Several such tanks could be
linked together to create an ex
tremely large space station.
But a much smaller eight
man "habitation module"

which is being considered by
NASA for launch around 1987,
might be sufficient to meet our
immediate needs for human ac
tivity in space.
One of these needs is for con
struction of a space power sys
tem to meet the energy re
quirements of extended Shuttle
missions. The Orbiter's solar
radiators alone will not be able
to provide enough energy for
many of the tasks NASA hopes
to accomplish in space during
this decade, but an orbiting
Power Extension Package
(PEP), which is described in
NASA's current Five-Year Pro
gram Plan, could solve this
problem.
The PEP could provide
energy for a materials process
ing experiment carrier, which
might ultimately become the
first factory in space.
In the gravity-free environ
ment of space, with an abun
dance of solar energy, a small
orbiting factory could manufac
ture valuable pharmaceuticals
and electronics components
which would be difficult or im
possible to produce on Earth.
' A space manufacturing facil
ity of this type might some day
process thousands of tons of ore
mined from the Moon and the
asteroids, enabling us to build
entire cities in space.
Proponents of "Space co
lonization" such as Gerard K.
O'Neill and Thomas Hep
penheimer believe that large
communities could be estab
lished in space by the end of this
century.
The Power Extension Pack
age, consisting mainly of
photovoltaic soiar cells, could
be modified to relay solar
energy down to Earth. This
could be the predecessor of a
massive network of solar power
satellites, which would beam
billions of watts of electricity to
Earth in the form of micro


Shuttle's twin solid rocket reusable boosters separate from Orbiter
at an altitude of 25 miles.

waves.
According to NASA and De
partment of Energy (DOE)
studies, such as a Space Power
System (SPS) could be de
veloped by the early 1990 s. A
more simple space energy sys
tem utilizing mirrors to reflect
sunlight directly to Earth, could
be established with the Space
Shuttle by the end of the 1980's.
Friday's test of the Space
Shuttle will be a critical step
toward the achievement of
these and other similar goals. If
the Space Shuttle fails, it would

be a tremendous setback for our
nation's space program.
If it does succeed in meeting
NASA's expectations, public
opinion will play a large role in
determining the extent to which
this spacecrft is used in the
shaping of mankind's future.
Space development holds great
potential, but it is also extreme
ly expensive, so important de
cisions will have to be made dur
ing the next few years. If space
development is determined to
be in our national interests, then
some day 1981 may indeed be
best remembered as the begin

ning of the "Age of the Space
Shuttle."

Early Friday morning, hours
before most of us get up for
class, a peculiar-looking oblong
object will be launched into the
Florida sky, and history will be
made.
The Space Shuttle Columbia
will begin its maiden voyage,
opening up a new era of space
exploration.
The Space Shuttle, the
world's most sophisticated
flying machine, will finally
leave the launch pad after an ex
pensive ten years of develop
ment by the National Aero
nautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA).
For those who are too young
to remember, NASA is the gov
erment agency which made he
roes out of 1960's Air Force colo
nels by sending them on ex
pense-paid, two-week vacations
to the Moon.
Forced out of this business by
economists who deduced fifty
pounds of moon rocks were not
worth twenty billion dollars,
NASA was forced to change
course. The Space Shuttle

Transportation System, which
presently absorbs nearly two
thirds of NASA's research and
development funding. This mon
ey is probably being well spent.
Within twenty years, the
Space Shuttle could transform a
century of sciencefiction into
science fact. The fully reusable
Shuttle Orbiter will be launched
with two solid fuel rocket
boosters, which are also re
usable, and a large expendable
hydrogen fuel tank.
Carrying a crew of as many as
seven men and women, the
massive Orbiter has a cargo bay
the size of a box car, and will be
able to lift over 30 tons of pay
load into space. The Orbiter can
remain in space for up to a
month at a time, and after re
turning to Earth, can be re
furbished and readied for anoth
er mission within two weeks.
Our fleet of four Shuttle Or
biters, when completed, will
provide the United States with
as many as one hundred Shuttle
flights per year.
According to present plans,
the Space Shuttle will perform

three different types of mis
sions over the next ten years.
First, it will be used for the
launch and repair of artificial
satellites, as many as five of
which can fit into the Orbiter
cargo bay at one time. These
satellites include communica
tions, remote-sensing, naviga
tion, and military spy satellites,
as well as the futuristic "killer
satellites" which emit destruc
tive lasers and particle beams.
If it had not been for the Shut
tle's military applications, it
probably would have never been
developed. Two of the four Shut
tle Orbiters will belong to the
United States Air Force.
Secondly, the Shuttle will
function as an in-space labora
tory and observatory. The Or
biter cargo bay will be outfitted
with the four-man Spacelab for
as many as fifty scientific mis
sions during the 1980's.
A giant Space Telescope is
scheduled for a Shuttle launch in
1983; it will be the most pow
erful astronomical instrument
ever built.
These missions are expected

to greatly enhance our under
standing of the evolution of the
Universe, and will provide use
ful information on the effects of
the space environment on living
systems.
Finally, the Space Shuttle will
provide the support required for
the construction of large space
platforms and structures. This
is perhaps the most important,
if not the most interesting of the
tasks for which the Space Shut
tle was designed.
Utilizing building methods
presently being developed at
NASA's Langley Research Cen
ter, a small crew will be able to
fabricate structures several
miles in length within the dura
tion of a single Shuttle mission.
Such large space structures
will permit the initiation of
space manufacturing and habi
tation, perhaps as early as 1985.
The possible uses for large
space structures technology are
fascinating. Within five years,
for example, the Shuttle could
launch communications plat
forms, for a personal com
munications system which
could eventually make tele
phones obsolete. Such a system
was designed during a NASA
"brain-storming session" in
1979. Its worldwide users would
be able to communicate instant
ly via satellite-linked
"wristwatch telephones,"
which might cost less than a
penny a minute to operate.
A Space Shuttle crew could
assemble a large permanently
manned space station within a
matter of weeks. A NASA study
in 1977 determined that one of
the Shuttle's external hydrogen
tanks could be tugged into orbit,
and refurbished to function as a
space habitat which could sup
port a crew of thirty.
Several such tanks could be
linked together to create an ex
tremely large space station.
But a much smaller eight
man "habitation module"

which is being considered by
NASA for launch around 1987,
might be sufficient to meet our
immediate needs for human ac
tivity in space.
One of these needs is for con
struction of a space power sys
tem to meet the energy re
quirements of extended Shuttle
missions. The Orbiter's solar
radiators alone will not be able
to provide enough energy for
many of the tasks NASA hopes
to accomplish in space during
this decade, but an orbiting
Power Extension Package
(PEP), which is described in
NASA's current Five-Year Pro
gram Plan, could solve this
problem.
The PEP could provide
energy for a materials process
ing experiment carrier, which
might ultimately become the
first factory in space.
In the gravity-free environ
ment of space, with an abun
dance of solar energy, a small
orbiting factory could manufac
ture valuable pharmaceuticals
and electronics components
which would be difficult or im
possible to produce on Earth.
' A space manufacturing facil

process thousands of tons of ore

with the four-man Spacelab for
as many as fifty scientific mis
sions during the 1980's.
A giant Space Telescope is
scheduled for a Shuttle launch in
1983; it will be the most pow
erful astronomical instrument
ever built.
These missions are expected

to greatly enhance our under
standing of the evolution of the
Universe, and will provide use
ful information on the effects of
the space environment on living
systems.
Finally, the Space Shuttle will
provide the support required for
the construction of large space
platforms and structures. This
is perhaps the most important,
if not the most interesting of the
tasks for which the Space Shut
tle was designed.
Utilizing building methods
presently being developed at
NASA's Langley Research Cen
ter, a small crew will be able to
fabricate structures several
miles in length within the dura
tion of a single Shuttle mission.
Such large space structures
will permit the initiation of
space manufacturing and habi
tation, perhaps as early as 1985.
The possible uses for large
space structures technology are
fascinating. Within five years,
for example, the Shuttle could
launch communications plat
forms, for a personal com
munications system which
could eventually make tele
phones obsolete. Such a system
was designed during a NASA
"brain-storming session" in
1979. Its worldwide users would
be able to communicate instant
ly via satellite-linked
"wristwatch telephones,"
which might cost less than a
penny a minute to operate.
A Space Shuttle crew could
assemble a large permanently
manned space station within a
matter of weeks. A NASA study
in 1977 determined that one of
the Shuttle's external hydrogen
tanks could be tugged into orbit,
and refurbished to function as a
space habitat which could sup
port a crew of thirty.
Several such tanks could be
linked together to create an ex
tremely large space station.
But a much smaller eight
man "habitation module"

which is being considered by
NASA for launch around 1987,
might be sufficient to meet our
immediate needs for human ac
tivity in space.
One of these needs is for con
struction of a space power sys
tem to meet the energy re
quirements of extended Shuttle
missions. The Orbiter's solar
radiators alone will not be able
to provide enough energy for
many of the tasks NASA hopes
to accomplish in space during
this decade, but an orbiting
Power Extension Package
(PEP), which is described in
NASA's current Five-Year Pro
gram Plan, could solve this
problem.
The PEP could provide
energy for a materials process
ing experiment carrier, which
might ultimately become the
first factory in space.
In the gravity-free environ
ment of space, with an abun
dance of solar energy, a small
orbiting factory could manufac
ture valuable pharmaceuticals
and electronics components
which would be difficult or im
possible to produce on Earth.
' A space manufacturing facil
ity of this type might some day
process thousands of tons of ore
mined from the Moon and the
asteroids, enabling us to build
entire cities in space.
Proponents of "Space co
lonization" such as Gerard K.
O'Neill and Thomas Hep
penheimer believe that large
communities could be estab

century.
The Power Extension Pack
age, consisting mainly of
photovoltaic soiar cells, could
be modified to relay solar
energy down to Earth. This
could be the predecessor of a
massive network of solar power
satellites, which would beam
billions of watts of electricity to
Earth in the form of micro

waves.
According to NASA and De
partment of Energy (DOE)
studies, such as a Space Power
System (SPS) could be de
veloped by the early 1990 s. A
more simple space energy sys
tem utilizing mirrors to reflect
sunlight directly to Earth, could
be established with the Space
Shuttle by the end of the 1980's.
Friday's test of the Space
Shuttle will be a critical step
toward the achievement of
these and other similar goals. If
the Space Shuttle fails, it would

be a tremendous setback for our
nation's space program.
If it does succeed in meeting
NASA's expectations, public
opinion will play a large role in
determining the extent to which
this spacecrft is used in the
shaping of mankind's future.
Space development holds great
potential, but it is also extreme
ly expensive, so important de
cisions will have to be made dur
ing the next few years. If space
development is determined to
be in our national interests, then
some day 1981 may indeed be
best remembered as the begin

ning of the "Age of the Space
Shuttle."

Early Friday morning, hours
before most of us get up for
class, a peculiar-looking oblong
object will be launched into the
Florida sky, and history will be
made.
The Space Shuttle Columbia
will begin its maiden voyage,
opening up a new era of space
exploration.
The Space Shuttle, the
world's most sophisticated
flying machine, will finally
leave the launch pad after an ex
pensive ten years of develop
ment by the National Aero
nautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA).
For those who are too young
to remember, NASA is the gov
erment agency which made he
roes out of 1960's Air Force colo
nels by sending them on ex
pense-paid, two-week vacations
to the Moon.
Forced out of this business by
economists who deduced fifty
pounds of moon rocks were not
worth twenty billion dollars,
NASA was forced to change
course. The Space Shuttle

Transportation System, which
presently absorbs nearly two
thirds of NASA's research and
development funding. This mon
ey is probably being well spent.
Within twenty years, the
Space Shuttle could transform a
century of sciencefiction into
science fact. The fully reusable
Shuttle Orbiter will be launched
with two solid fuel rocket
boosters, which are also re
usable, and a large expendable
hydrogen fuel tank.
Carrying a crew of as many as
seven men and women, the
massive Orbiter has a cargo bay
the size of a box car, and will be
able to lift over 30 tons of pay
load into space. The Orbiter can
remain in space for up to a
month at a time, and after re
turning to Earth, can be re
furbished and readied for anoth
er mission within two weeks.
Our fleet of four Shuttle Or
biters, when completed, will
provide the United States with
as many as one hundred Shuttle
flights per year.
According to present plans,
the Space Shuttle will perform

three different types of mis
sions over the next ten years.
First, it will be used for the
launch and repair of artificial
satellites, as many as five of
which can fit into the Orbiter
cargo bay at one time. These
satellites include communica
tions, remote-sensing, naviga
tion, and military spy satellites,
as well as the futuristic "killer
satellites" which emit destruc
tive lasers and particle beams.
If it had not been for the Shut
tle's military applications, it
probably would have never been
developed. Two of the four Shut
tle Orbiters will belong to the
United States Air Force.
Secondly, the Shuttle will
function as an in-space labora
tory and observatory. The Or
biter cargo bay will be outfitted
with the four-man Spacelab for
as many as fifty scientific mis
sions during the 1980's.
A giant Space Telescope is
