# ...but the spacecraft has had its share of problems

### Lisa A. Hudson 
The space shuttle Columbia,
NASA's pride and joy, is sched
uled for launching this Friday,
April 10, two years later and
$5 billion rrore than ori
ginally expected. The project
has had several problems re
sulting in delays, and has raised
doubts in more than a few minds
about the safety of the shuttle.
"The evidence of problems
(in the shuttle) is far greater
than in any other project,"
says Joel Shurkin, science writ
er for University News and Pub
lications, who has reported on
America's space efforts for
many years. He pointed out that
the Shuttle program was "un
der-budgeted" — causing cuts
in so-called marginal areas,
such as landing tests, back-up
systems, and unmanned test
flights.
But criticism of the shuttle
goes beyond launching delays.
The Washington Monthly in
its April 1980 issue called it"the
Spruce Goose of outer space."
The magazine charged that it
will cost more to fly than the old
reusable rockets, if it flies that
is.
The shuttle can't launch more
than the old rockets could. It
can't bring back or service sat
elites. as you may have heard,
— it can't get to them, and it
can't keep a space station aloft
for any length of time.
It just has men in the front
seats . . . and enormous amount
of weight and equipment de
voted to bringing them back, it
said.
The most important thing
that the shuttle cannot do and
the old rockets could is fail, ac
cording to the Monthly. "A
rocket can be permitted to fail.
What if a billion-dollar space
ship wipes out on a 'routine'

mission 'commuting' to space
with some puny little satelite?"
The reason for the delays and
criticisms may be the fact that
the shuttle is perhaps the most
ambitious project undertaken
by NASA.
While not as spectacular as
landing on the moon the shuttle
has posed complex engineering
problems.
The craft has to withstand
pressures and temperature dif
ferences far greater than any of
its predecessors. It has to fly at
far greater speeds than any oth
er craft after re-entry and yet
land like an aircraft — but
without power. Above all, it has
to be sturdy enough to withstand
the trip to space over and over
again.
Stan Miller, Chief of Technol
ogy Utilization at AMES re
search center in Mountain
View, attributes the launching
delays, measured in years, not
to problems, but to the in
novative technology required by
the shuttle. "Nothing like this
(the shuttle) has ever been done
before." he said.
Holt Ashley, Professor of
Aeronautics and Astronautics
and advisor to NASA agreed.
"They were just too op
timistic," he said, pointing out
the enormous complexity of the
shuttle. He said that the time
actually required to get the
shuttle off the ground, while two
years more than originally esti
mated, was "about right" for so
complicated a project.
A major challenge facing
NASA engineers, Ashley ex
plained, is to protect the rocket
from 3000 degree temperature it
must withstand on the way back
to earth. The answer was 31,000
six inch square fire-like tiles ap
plied to the surface of the rock
et.

The tiles, resembling
styrofoam, are made of silica
and are incredibly strong and
light. The problem, according to
Ashley, was that the strain
isolation pads used to protect
the tiles from strain and break
age, and to attack the tiles to the
rocket, were breaking too easily
themselves. The problem was
not discovered until mid-sum
mer of 1979, and resulted in a big
delay as a new glue made of
silica, alcohol and water was de
veloped and tested, and all the
tiles reapplied.
Another time-consuming task
impeding the launching of the
shuttle was the development of
three rocket engines using liq
uid hydrogen fuel, which Ashley
called a "tremendous advance
in the state of the art of liquid
engines." The trouble, .Ashley
described, was in trying to
pump oxygen into a combustion
chamber at 3000 lbs./sq. inch,
"three times whatever had been

done before."
The program has been costly
rising from the original 1973 es
timate of 5.8 billion dollars to
11.5 billion 1980 dollars. The gov
ernment posed strict controls on
the project's budget, or the cost
would have been much greater.
The program has been modified
as a result of the budget restric
tions. Originally planned to be
two fully-recoverable air
planes: an orbiter on top of a
launch plane; the shuttle now
consists of a less expensive sys
tem: 1) a recoverable orbiter
(expected to last 100 missions)
2) a huge external non-re
coverable fuel tank 3) two
boosters to get the orbiter into
the atmosphere (to be re
covered and used approximate
ly ten times each).
Three more shuttles are
scheduled to be built, down one
from the original five. Colum
bia belongs to NASA, which is
also scheduled to receive the

next shuttle built. The remain
ing two will be built for the Air
Force, operating out of Van
denburg Air Force Base in San
ta Maria.
The program has not been af
fected by Reagan's budget cuts,
because the program costs were
already budgeted when Reagan
entered office, according to
Ashley. Although Aviation
Week and Space Technology
reports that "future large dedi
cated space lab missions may be
in jeopardy as a result of the
spending cuts," Ashley believes
that further development of the
space exploration program will
depend on the success of Colum
bia.
Ashley notes that the uses of
the shuttle are at this point
more military than civilian
(photo reconnaissance, track
ing military ma
neuvers,submarines, crop con
trol, communications etc.)

can't keep a space station aloft
for any length of time.
It just has men in the front
seats . . . and enormous amount
of weight and equipment de
voted to bringing them back, it
said.
The most important thing
that the shuttle cannot do and
the old rockets could is fail, ac
cording to the Monthly. "A

What if a billion-dollar space
ship wipes out on a 'routine'

mission 'commuting' to space
with some puny little satelite?"
The reason for the delays and
criticisms may be the fact that
the shuttle is perhaps the most
ambitious project undertaken
by NASA.
While not as spectacular as
landing on the moon the shuttle
has posed complex engineering
problems.
The craft has to withstand
pressures and temperature dif
ferences far greater than any of
its predecessors. It has to fly at
far greater speeds than any oth
er craft after re-entry and yet
land like an aircraft — but
without power. Above all, it has
to be sturdy enough to withstand
the trip to space over and over
again.
Stan Miller, Chief of Technol
ogy Utilization at AMES re
search center in Mountain
View, attributes the launching
delays, measured in years, not
to problems, but to the in
novative technology required by
the shuttle. "Nothing like this
(the shuttle) has ever been done
before." he said.
Holt Ashley, Professor of
Aeronautics and Astronautics
and advisor to NASA agreed.
"They were just too op
timistic," he said, pointing out
the enormous complexity of the
shuttle. He said that the time
actually required to get the
shuttle off the ground, while two
years more than originally esti
mated, was "about right" for so
complicated a project.
A major challenge facing
NASA engineers, Ashley ex
plained, is to protect the rocket
from 3000 degree temperature it
must withstand on the way back
to earth. The answer was 31,000
six inch square fire-like tiles ap
plied to the surface of the rock
et.

The tiles, resembling
styrofoam, are made of silica
and are incredibly strong and
light. The problem, according to
Ashley, was that the strain
isolation pads used to protect
the tiles from strain and break
age, and to attack the tiles to the
rocket, were breaking too easily
themselves. The problem was
not discovered until mid-sum
mer of 1979, and resulted in a big
delay as a new glue made of
silica, alcohol and water was de
veloped and tested, and all the
tiles reapplied.
Another time-consuming task
impeding the launching of the
shuttle was the development of
three rocket engines using liq
uid hydrogen fuel, which Ashley
called a "tremendous advance
in the state of the art of liquid
engines." The trouble, .Ashley
described, was in trying to
pump oxygen into a combustion
chamber at 3000 lbs./sq. inch,
"three times whatever had been

done before."
The program has been costly
rising from the original 1973 es
timate of 5.8 billion dollars to
11.5 billion 1980 dollars. The gov
ernment posed strict controls on
the project's budget, or the cost
would have been much greater.
The program has been modified
as a result of the budget restric
tions. Originally planned to be
two fully-recoverable air
planes: an orbiter on top of a
launch plane; the shuttle now
consists of a less expensive sys
tem: 1) a recoverable orbiter
(expected to last 100 missions)
2) a huge external non-re
coverable fuel tank 3) two
boosters to get the orbiter into
the atmosphere (to be re
covered and used approximate
ly ten times each).
Three more shuttles are
scheduled to be built, down one
from the original five. Colum
bia belongs to NASA, which is
also scheduled to receive the

next shuttle built. The remain
ing two will be built for the Air
Force, operating out of Van
denburg Air Force Base in San
ta Maria.
The program has not been af
fected by Reagan's budget cuts,
because the program costs were
already budgeted when Reagan
entered office, according to
Ashley. Although Aviation
Week and Space Technology
reports that "future large dedi
cated space lab missions may be
in jeopardy as a result of the
spending cuts," Ashley believes
that further development of the
space exploration program will
depend on the success of Colum
bia.
Ashley notes that the uses of
the shuttle are at this point
more military than civilian
(photo reconnaissance, track
ing military ma
neuvers,submarines, crop con
trol, communications etc.)
The space shuttle Columbia,
NASA's pride and joy, is sched
uled for launching this Friday,
April 10, two years later and
$5 billion rrore than ori
ginally expected. The project
has had several problems re
sulting in delays, and has raised
doubts in more than a few minds
about the safety of the shuttle.
"The evidence of problems
(in the shuttle) is far greater
than in any other project,"
says Joel Shurkin, science writ
er for University News and Pub
lications, who has reported on
America's space efforts for
many years. He pointed out that
the Shuttle program was "un
der-budgeted" — causing cuts
in so-called marginal areas,
such as landing tests, back-up
systems, and unmanned test
flights.
But criticism of the shuttle
goes beyond launching delays.
The Washington Monthly in
its April 1980 issue called it"the
Spruce Goose of outer space."
The magazine charged that it
will cost more to fly than the old
reusable rockets, if it flies that
is.
The shuttle can't launch more
than the old rockets could. It
can't bring back or service sat
elites. as you may have heard,
