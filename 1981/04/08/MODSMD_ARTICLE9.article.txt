# Writer discusses space colonies
## 
### Jennifer Seymour 
Space colonization may seem
esoteric or too far into the
future for some but Thomas
Heppenheimer has spent most
of his life publicizing them. Sur
prisingly enough Heppenheimer
began his address in Skilling
Auditorium last Thursday eve
ning by emphasizing the im
portance of the past and the
trends of civilizations.
"To come to an under
standing of the future, we must
understand the humanities and
the science of the past," he said.
Such an awareness, Hep
penheimer suggested, reveals
that science and technology do
not insure advances in society.

' Advance depends on how we
use that knowledge we have
gained, and whether we possess
the will to go forward with it."
Heppenheimer holds a Ph.D
in aerospace engineering from
University of Michigan, though
most of his research has been in
planetary science. He has pub
lished 55 papers in this field,
along with his two books Co
lonies in Space, and Toward a
Distant Sun.
The forward-looking attitude
Heppenheimer advocated in
part motivated him to write Co
lonies in Space. "I don't see that
space colonies will be possible
in the near future, unless we are
able to develop the power satel-

Lite much more quickly than
foreseen. And I don't even see
any pressing reason for the de
velopment of such colonies very
immediately," he said.
"But someday they may be
come important and they are, in
any case, an interesting,
creative field to consider."
Heppenheimer described the
space colony wheels depicted in
his books "as a sort of lotus-land
Acapulco vacation." These, he
imagined, would probably be
developed like other real estate
has been, with loans and in
vestors to live In them. The ad
vantage of endless space would
keep colony prices stable, how
ever, as opposed to the price in
flation that occurs with limited
land resources here on earth.
Such colonies could be made
of aluminum, mined from the
moon, and could be climate con
trolled to make conditions ex
actly as desired
Heppenheimer emphasized,
however, that in considering
any kind of space travel or habi
tation, we should not demand of
the future (or space) a quality of
perfection not found in the past.
"Space tends to be the object
of idealisms, realized wishful
thinking. But the past shows us
that civilization makes very
slow, subtle real advances. So
we can not look to space for per
fection we have never yet had.
Space colonizers would have the
same worries, problems and
evils all societies have had," he
said. Heppenheimer spoke op
timistically about current space
exploration endeavors in Amer
ica.
"I think we have a good space
program. Space development
must be let to go at its own pace.
Big themes are hard to come
by."
Heppenheimer supported es
pecially the current space shut
tle, saying it would allow us to
"learn the real promise and
false promise of space travel"
as well as reveal which trends
and experiments of aerospace
we should pursue.
When asked about the de
velopmental problems the shut
tle has had, Heppenheimer ad
mitted there had been some,
probably would be more, and
there was even the chance that
it would fail or crash.
"But," he said, "I would hope
that even if this did happen, we
could be tough-minded enough
to mourn the losses and still go
forward with space research.
