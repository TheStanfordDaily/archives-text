Space colonization may seem
esoteric or too far into the
future for some but Thomas
Heppenheimer has spent most
of his life publicizing them. Sur
prisingly enough Heppenheimer
began his address in Skilling
Auditorium last Thursday eve
ning by emphasizing the im
portance of the past and the
trends of civilizations.
"To come to an under
standing of the future, we must
understand the humanities and
the science of the past," he said.
Such an awareness, Hep
penheimer suggested, reveals
that science and technology do
not insure advances in society.

' Advance depends on how we
use that knowledge we have
gained, and whether we possess
the will to go forward with it."
Heppenheimer holds a Ph.D
in aerospace engineering from

most of his research has been in
planetary science. He has pub

along with his two books Co
lonies in Space, and Toward a
Distant Sun.
The forward-looking attitude
Heppenheimer advocated in
part motivated him to write Co
lonies in Space. "I don't see that
space colonies will be possible
in the near future, unless we are
able to develop the power satel-

Lite much more quickly than
foreseen. And I don't even see
any pressing reason for the de

imagined, would probably be
developed like other real estate
has been, with loans and in
