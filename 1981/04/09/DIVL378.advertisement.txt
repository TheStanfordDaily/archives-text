SIGMA XI LECTURE I
112 "Experiment or Theory, |
I which Comes First" |
j One hundred years ago it was usually said that the success of modern science depends
§ on "the experimental method " Facts precede theory During the past forty years many v
£ writers have argued that there is no sSch thing as a bare experimental fact — in the words &
of one eminent philosopher of science every observation is "theory laden. This view, r
\ recognized or unrecognized, has affected the way science is taught, the way history and
& philosophy of science are written, and the way funding agencies operate in supporting or v
x failing to support research. Little effort has been made to examine the truth of these \
? opinions in the light of the history of any actual science. The lecturers attempt to do so by ?
N considering the history of several branches of physics. j
