# Meeting intended to rally support for funding increases
## Decline in grad aid level discussed 
### Mike Vaska First of two parts 
An overflow crowd ot 80 graduate
students assembled at Tresidder
Union last night to discuss the declin
ing level of financial aid provided by
the University in recent years.
Increases in the amount of graduate
financial aid Stanford provides have
not kept pace with surging inflation in
the Bay Area. As a result, some gradu
ate students receive less than 60 per
cent of their living expenses from the
University.
While inflation has taken its toll,
outside sources for financial support
provided by the federal government
and private foundations have also de
creased.
The problem is particularly acute in
the social sciences and the humanities
because corporations and the federal
government are more eager to fund
their more prestigious cousins — hard
sciences such as chemistry and phys
ics.
Last night's meeting was billed by
its sponsors, the Stanford Fellows As
sociation and the Social Sciences

Graduate Students Association
(SSGSAi, as an efiort rally the sup
port of graduate students in an effort
to increase financial aid amounts.
Graduate students are "vulner
able" in a university community to an
erosion in the financial support they
receive because they don't have a job
market, as do faculty and staff, to
keep their incomes at a decent level,
according to Bill Sundstrom. the
meeting's moderator.
The Stanford Fellows and the
SSGSA want to "try to form a more
visible hand" to work for reasonable
levels of support, Sundstrom said.
Stanford has been responsive to the
pressure brought to bear this year.
Sundstrom said. The University ori
ginally proposed financial aids in
creases tor next year of 12 percent, but
has since raised that figure to 16 per
cent, he said.
However, Sundstrom warned, there
is no reason to expect gains made this
year will be continued next year.
According to Michael Sperberg-
McQueen, chairman of the Stanford
Fellows, graduate students in the so
cial sciences and humanities general
ly receive support from two Univer
sity sources: fellowships and teaching
assistantships.
In addition, students receive tuition
waivers from the University.
Figures from the Stanford Depart
ment of Financial Aids show the
steady decline in support for graduate
students during the last five years,
Sperberg-McQueen said.
In 1975-76 University support for
Teaching Assistants covered more
than 10Q percent of total living costs;
presently support provides less than 80
percent of the amount needed to live,
Sperberg-McQueen said.
Graduate Students on fellowships
now receive less than 60 percent of
their living costs in the form of Uni
versity aid, Sperberg-McQueen said.
While University officials have
been sympathetic to the concerns of
graduate students, they have not been
able to offer much hope for the future,
according to Frank Dobbin, a gradu
ate student in the Sociology depart
ment.
"The reality of the last three years
and (University President Donald)
Kennedy's recent speech regarding

graduate aid have confirmed our be
lief that the University views gradu
ate students as expendable," Dobbin
said.
In that speech made last Friday
before the Academic Council, Ken
nedy listed the problems the Univer
sity will have in providing financial
support lor graduate students because
of recent and proposed cuts in federal
and private funding of higher educa
tion. He concluded that Stanford "can
not sustain full support tor doctoral
candidates, and . . . should now come
to recognize that inability."
Stanford should make an effort to
provide financial aid at a "level that
will permit them (graduate students)
to enroll here with the aid of other re
sources for which they are respon
sible," Kennedy said.
Graduate students agree that the is
sue of providing fellowship support is
an arguable one tor the University, but
Stanford should not argue about the
pay levels for its teaching assistants,
Dobbin said. TAs are the "backbone of
the University — they do all the aca
demic shitwork for the University,"
he said.
Graduate students should not ac
cept recent proposals tor changes that
have been discussed by the University
— which include a shift to "need-based
aid" or the reduction in the number of
graduate students accepted into pro
grams each year, Dobbin said. "The
pot should be bigger — there should be
more money to go around for graduate
students." Dobbin said.
Dean of Graduate Studies Gerald
Leiberman addressed the students in
an attempt to "clarity" the meaning
of Kennedy's speech to the Academic
Council. Kennedy meant to say "yes,
inflation has eroded the financial as
sistance Stanford gives to graduate
students," and it does not now look
promising to close the gap between
levels of support and the cost of living.
Lieberman said.
The University is not planning to
end financial support for graduate stu
dents, Lieberman said.
"It is easy to say 'yes, increase the
size of the pot' — but there is no natu
ral to do so without recognizing the
fact that there will be decreases in
other programs to facilitate such in
creases." Lieberman said.
