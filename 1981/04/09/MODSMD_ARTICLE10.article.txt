# Producer relates difficulties of filmmaking in Poland
## 'Two different countries were cooperating to make a film about two different subjects' 
### Sarah Hotchkis 
"If I had stayed another day,
I'm sure I would have been ar
rested,'' said film producer
Chris Berardo of her narrow es
cape last summer from the po
litical crisis in Poland. Speaking
at Bechtel International Cen
ter's Luncheon Series last Tues
day, Berardo described many of
the conflicts and impediments
she encountered as associate
producer of a TV film based on
John Hersey's novel, The Wall
(to be shown on CBS this fall).

During the three months of filming,
Hernardo and the other A mericans
associated with the film, endured many of
the tools of intimidation used by the
Communist government in Poland such as
censorship, bugging of telephone lines, and
the unexplained arrest and imprisonment of
many of the Polish filmmakers.

During the three months of
filming, Berardo, and the other
Americans associated with the
film, endured many tools of in
timidation used by the Com
munist government in Poland
such as censorship, bugging of
telephone lines, and the unex
plained arrest and imprison
ment of many of the Polish film
makers who worked in coopera
tion with the Americans.
Berardo noted that at the
time of her departure, the chair
man of the Polish Radio and Tel
evision who helped coordinate
and negotiate the film contract
was in "an intensive care ward
of a hospital — a euphemism,"
said Berardo, "for maximum
security detention."
The Wall, a film representing
the heroic but suicidal revolt of
the Jews in a Warsaw ghetto,
was originally written by Time-
Life Company and presented to
Polish filmmakers as a means
to share Western cinemato
graphic technology. The Poles
agreed to provide the hotels,
sets, extras, several techni
cians, and all the materials and
props which appear on the
screen. The Americans were to
provide the director, producer,
actors and actresses and princi
ple technicians. For their par
ticipation, the Poles had the
right to distribute the film in all
countries with the exception ot

the United States.
Berardo agreed to the con
tract expecting problems with
communication in the language,
and inefficiency due to the in
evitable exchange of recrimina
tions between the two film
groups. The actual problems,
dominated by the often blister
ing heat of the political up
heaval and labor strikes, in
cluded disagreement over the
script which the government
found insulting, despite the his
torical validity of the story. The

script depicted the failure ot the
Poles to aid the Jews in their
mission, but the Polish govern
ment wanted a propaganda film
about the heroic action of the
Polish underground.
CBS, however, was desperate
to please their Jewish viewers
and mollify the effect caused by
Vanessa Redgrave in a previous
CBS production. Thus, added
Berardo, "two different coun
tries were cooperating to make
a film about two different sub
jects." Finally the two sides
compromised, although now,
complained Berardo, the gov
ernment officials who approved
ot the film at that time have all
been replaced.
Another dilemma which frus
trated Berardo and the Ameri
can film crew was the lack ot
materials for production. "We
had to simulate snow to show
winter, but when I went to the
fire department, I had a terrible
time getting the necessary
chemicals. What do you use
when you want to make a film
showing snow?" Berardo asked
one ot the Polish crew. He re
plied, "We wait for winter."
Other scarce materials in
cluded munitions for military
scenes, and bricks needed to
build "The Wall." The daily
Polish refrain "it's simply not
possible," slowed but rarely

prevented the delivery (always
through the black market) of
the necessary supplies.
Berardo mentioned the
positive side to the film produc
tion, as well as the problems.
The failure to find enough Jew
ish extras resulted in a corps of
Polish extras whose faces were
truly "etched in suffering." In
addition, the Poles gave the film
crew an entire town, due for ur
ban renewal, to burn to the
ground. "We totally destroyed
it," said Berardo.
A final twist to her filming ex
perience occurred when she ov
erheard a group of actual Polish
soldiers, not actors, waiting to
be used in a scene involving
their specially trained attack
dogs. The Polish soldiers,
dressed in Nazi uniforms,
awaited a scene simulating the
throngs of Jews herded oft box
cars and into Auschwitz.
This was the very troop of sol
diers designated to break the
strike in Gdansk upon the gov
ernment's orders. "These
young guys were sitting there
talking about whether they
would go to Gdansk and whether
they would fire upon their own
people. It was a moment of
enormous irony," said Berardo,
"because they were debating
the question the world has asked
ever since of the Nazis: how
could they have done it?"
The 10 million members who
joined Solidarity during
Berardo's three month stay ex
emplified, she said, the amazing
momentum of the Polish worker
revolt. "I don't see any way of
putting the lid back on," she
said. Since her departure,
Berardo has predicted the in
evitable end in sight for the
Poles: an ultimate confronta
tion between the government
and the people. "The first thing
I do in the morning is to listen to
the radio to see if the bloodshed
has begun. But," she added, "I
hope to God that I'm wrong."

a film about two different sub
jects." Finally the two sides
compromised, although now,
complained Berardo, the gov
ernment officials who approved
ot the film at that time have all
been replaced.
Another dilemma which frus
trated Berardo and the Ameri
can film crew was the lack ot
materials for production. "We
had to simulate snow to show
winter, but when I went to the
fire department, I had a terrible
time getting the necessary
chemicals. What do you use
when you want to make a film
showing snow?" Berardo asked
one ot the Polish crew. He re
plied, "We wait for winter."
Other scarce materials in
cluded munitions for military
scenes, and bricks needed to
build "The Wall." The daily
Polish refrain "it's simply not
possible," slowed but rarely

prevented the delivery (always
through the black market) of
the necessary supplies.
Berardo mentioned the
positive side to the film produc
tion, as well as the problems.
The failure to find enough Jew
ish extras resulted in a corps of
Polish extras whose faces were
truly "etched in suffering." In
addition, the Poles gave the film
crew an entire town, due for ur
ban renewal, to burn to the
ground. "We totally destroyed
it," said Berardo.
A final twist to her filming ex
perience occurred when she ov
erheard a group of actual Polish
soldiers, not actors, waiting to
be used in a scene involving
their specially trained attack
dogs. The Polish soldiers,
dressed in Nazi uniforms,
awaited a scene simulating the
throngs of Jews herded oft box
cars and into Auschwitz.
This was the very troop of sol
diers designated to break the
strike in Gdansk upon the gov
ernment's orders. "These
young guys were sitting there
talking about whether they
would go to Gdansk and whether
they would fire upon their own
people. It was a moment of
enormous irony," said Berardo,
"because they were debating
the question the world has asked
ever since of the Nazis: how
could they have done it?"
The 10 million members who
joined Solidarity during
Berardo's three month stay ex
emplified, she said, the amazing
momentum of the Polish worker
revolt. "I don't see any way of
putting the lid back on," she
said. Since her departure,
Berardo has predicted the in
evitable end in sight for the
Poles: an ultimate confronta
tion between the government
and the people. "The first thing
I do in the morning is to listen to
the radio to see if the bloodshed
has begun. But," she added, "I
hope to God that I'm wrong."

"If I had stayed another day,
I'm sure I would have been ar
rested,'' said film producer
Chris Berardo of her narrow es
cape last summer from the po
litical crisis in Poland. Speaking
at Bechtel International Cen
ter's Luncheon Series last Tues
day, Berardo described many of
the conflicts and impediments
she encountered as associate
producer of a TV film based on
John Hersey's novel, The Wall
(to be shown on CBS this fall).

During the three months of filming,
Hernardo and the other A mericans
associated with the film, endured many of
the tools of intimidation used by the
Communist government in Poland such as
censorship, bugging of telephone lines, and
the unexplained arrest and imprisonment of
many of the Polish filmmakers.

During the three months of
filming, Berardo, and the other
Americans associated with the
film, endured many tools of in
timidation used by the Com
munist government in Poland
such as censorship, bugging of
telephone lines, and the unex
plained arrest and imprison
ment of many of the Polish film
makers who worked in coopera
tion with the Americans.
Berardo noted that at the
time of her departure, the chair
man of the Polish Radio and Tel
evision who helped coordinate
and negotiate the film contract
was in "an intensive care ward
of a hospital — a euphemism,"
said Berardo, "for maximum
security detention."
The Wall, a film representing
the heroic but suicidal revolt of
the Jews in a Warsaw ghetto,
was originally written by Time-
Life Company and presented to
Polish filmmakers as a means
to share Western cinemato
graphic technology. The Poles
agreed to provide the hotels,
sets, extras, several techni
cians, and all the materials and
props which appear on the
screen. The Americans were to
provide the director, producer,
actors and actresses and princi
ple technicians. For their par
ticipation, the Poles had the
right to distribute the film in all
countries with the exception ot

the United States.
Berardo agreed to the con
tract expecting problems with
communication in the language,
and inefficiency due to the in
evitable exchange of recrimina
tions between the two film
groups. The actual problems,
dominated by the often blister
ing heat of the political up
heaval and labor strikes, in
cluded disagreement over the
script which the government
found insulting, despite the his
torical validity of the story. The

script depicted the failure ot the
Poles to aid the Jews in their
mission, but the Polish govern
ment wanted a propaganda film
about the heroic action of the
Polish underground.
CBS, however, was desperate
to please their Jewish viewers
and mollify the effect caused by
Vanessa Redgrave in a previous
CBS production. Thus, added
Berardo, "two different coun
tries were cooperating to make
a film about two different sub
jects." Finally the two sides
compromised, although now,
complained Berardo, the gov
ernment officials who approved
