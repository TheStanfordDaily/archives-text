# The 						Stanford Daily Opinions
## Editorials Assessment endorsements 
### 
On Wednesday and Thursday of next
week, students will vote on 16 fee
assessment requests. Groups asking for
funding run the gamut from umbrella or
ganizations such as SCOPE and the Publi
cations Board that serve smaller student
services to specialized ones such as KZSU
and the Band.
The fee assessment is often the major or
even sole available source of program fi
nancing for these organizations. Without
this funding, several important groups
would have to limit activities or shut
down.
Students should examine the
assessments. Twenty percent of regis
tered students must vote to certify an
election and approve an assessment.
Three years ago. eight of 11 requests did
not receive 20 percent of the vote. The
ASSU had to hold a $600 special election.
We make the following recommenda
tions for several of the fee assessment re
quests appearing on the ballot next week.
Additional recommendations will appear
in the Daily tomorrow and Monday.
The Daily welcomes responses to its
editorial stances, and will offer space to
organizations whose fee assessments it
does not endorse. Submissions should be
brought to the Daily office no later than 2
p.m. Sunday.
Boathouse — Yes
It is with strong reservations that we
recommend a "yes" vote on the
Boathouse fee assessment. This is not be
cause we feel that the money will be
squandered — the needs outlined in the
Boathouse budget, such as lifeguarding
expenses and preventive maintenance,
are legitimate. Rather, we question why
the students are being called on to pay tor
this.
There has never been any question that
the University should pay for the upkeep
of recreation facilities at Roble, Encina
and DeGuerre; we see no reason why the
Lake should be any different.
While we recommend approval of the
assessment this year so that the service
will continue next year, we urge the ASSU
to work out a funding arrangement with
the University on behalf of the student
body. This is the Vast year such an
assessment should exist.
Student-Alumni Network —
No
The newly formed Student-Alumni
Network (SAN) is asking tor a fee
assessment to fund "educational service
events for students with alumni." Their
plans call for high-budget receptions for
alumni and students, and class events for
the freshman, sophomore and junior
classes. A fee assessment would only en
courage them to squander the money they
get, in accordance with the inflated
budget they prepared; without the levy,
they could run effective programs more
austerely.
Also, it seems unnecessary to constitute
a special organization solely to put on
class events. The Alumni Association and
the Development Office have found that
promoting "class consciousness" in
creases the likelihood that alumni will
make gifts to the University; let them
fund these activities, since they have a

direct interest in doing so.
The Band — Yes
The Band wants a one-quarter. $1 tee
assessment, a decrease from last year's
three-quarter request. The group is fore
going its traditional pre-season trip to an
away football game, cutting expenses by
about $18,000.
The Band plans to use the money for
about 60 new uniforms (coats and vests).
Members claim this will make the for
mations more easy to read than before.
Since it is unlikely the University or oth
er source will fund the Band, we support
this assessment. The Band is an institu
tion ; it supports not only the football team
but the University.
SCOPE - Yes
SCOPE (Stanford Committee on Politi
cal Education) has helped bring many in
teresting and valuable speakers to cam
pus this year. While we are impressed by
its stated desire to choose an issue first
and specific speakers second, we are con
cerned about redundancies that may de
velop among SPA, the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau and SCOPE. We endorse the fee
assessment requests of all three. But we
are concerned about groups that get fund
ing solely to disburse that money without
staging programs of their own, largely
latching onto programs that other groups
organize — a description that fits SCOPE
more than the other two. We recommend
that SCOPE consider soberly whether it
might be very ineffective in its current in
carnation, and whether member's
energies and students' money might not
be better directed to other channels.

Stanford Progressive
Alliance - Yes
Stanford Progressive Alliance repre
sents a broad coalition of groups, ranging
from women's and minority groups to the
Office Staff Organizing Committee and
political organizations. They seek an
assessment to fund their constituent
groups, to publish a biweekly newsletter,
to put on a speaker series and to visit
dorms to bring a progressive perspective
— often ignored at Stanford — to wider
campus attention.
We endorse their request. They are not
the narrowly dogmatic organization their
critics accuse them of being. They repre
sent a outlook not adequately represented
or institutionalized here. Such diversity is
essential to a climate of intellectual
growth and development that benefits the
University community as a whole.
ASSU Speakers Bureau — Yes
The Speakers Bureau has done a good
job over the past few years of bringing re
levant speakers to campus. This year, for
instance, the bureau sponsored ap
pearances by such speakers as feminist
Bella Abzug and former Sen. George Mc-
Govern.We endorse their fee assessment
request both because of their track record
and because of the innovative ideas they
have suggested for next year, such as a
speakers-in-residence program and a ris
ing emphasis on the cultural and artistic
as well as the political.

We endorse their request. They are not
the narrowly dogmatic organization their
critics accuse them of being. They repre
sent a outlook not adequately represented
or institutionalized here. Such diversity is
essential to a climate of intellectual
growth and development that benefits the
University community as a whole.
ASSU Speakers Bureau — Yes
The Speakers Bureau has done a good
job over the past few years of bringing re
levant speakers to campus. This year, for
instance, the bureau sponsored ap
pearances by such speakers as feminist
Bella Abzug and former Sen. George Mc-
Govern.We endorse their fee assessment
request both because of their track record
and because of the innovative ideas they
have suggested for next year, such as a
speakers-in-residence program and a ris
ing emphasis on the cultural and artistic
as well as the political.
On Wednesday and Thursday of next
week, students will vote on 16 fee
assessment requests. Groups asking for
funding run the gamut from umbrella or
ganizations such as SCOPE and the Publi
cations Board that serve smaller student
services to specialized ones such as KZSU
and the Band.
The fee assessment is often the major or
even sole available source of program fi
nancing for these organizations. Without
this funding, several important groups
would have to limit activities or shut
down.
Students should examine the
assessments. Twenty percent of regis
tered students must vote to certify an
election and approve an assessment.
Three years ago. eight of 11 requests did
not receive 20 percent of the vote. The
ASSU had to hold a $600 special election.
We make the following recommenda
tions for several of the fee assessment re
quests appearing on the ballot next week.
Additional recommendations will appear
in the Daily tomorrow and Monday.
The Daily welcomes responses to its
editorial stances, and will offer space to
organizations whose fee assessments it
does not endorse. Submissions should be
brought to the Daily office no later than 2
p.m. Sunday.
Boathouse — Yes
It is with strong reservations that we
recommend a "yes" vote on the
Boathouse fee assessment. This is not be
cause we feel that the money will be
squandered — the needs outlined in the
Boathouse budget, such as lifeguarding
expenses and preventive maintenance,
are legitimate. Rather, we question why
the students are being called on to pay tor
this.
There has never been any question that
the University should pay for the upkeep
of recreation facilities at Roble, Encina
and DeGuerre; we see no reason why the
Lake should be any different.
While we recommend approval of the
assessment this year so that the service
will continue next year, we urge the ASSU
to work out a funding arrangement with
the University on behalf of the student
body. This is the Vast year such an
assessment should exist.
Student-Alumni Network —
No
The newly formed Student-Alumni
Network (SAN) is asking tor a fee
assessment to fund "educational service
events for students with alumni." Their
plans call for high-budget receptions for
alumni and students, and class events for
the freshman, sophomore and junior
classes. A fee assessment would only en
courage them to squander the money they
get, in accordance with the inflated
budget they prepared; without the levy,
they could run effective programs more
austerely.
Also, it seems unnecessary to constitute
a special organization solely to put on
class events. The Alumni Association and
the Development Office have found that
promoting "class consciousness" in
creases the likelihood that alumni will
make gifts to the University; let them
fund these activities, since they have a

direct interest in doing so.
The Band — Yes
The Band wants a one-quarter. $1 tee
assessment, a decrease from last year's
three-quarter request. The group is fore
going its traditional pre-season trip to an
away football game, cutting expenses by
about $18,000.
The Band plans to use the money for
about 60 new uniforms (coats and vests).
Members claim this will make the for
mations more easy to read than before.
Since it is unlikely the University or oth
er source will fund the Band, we support
this assessment. The Band is an institu
tion ; it supports not only the football team
but the University.
SCOPE - Yes
SCOPE (Stanford Committee on Politi
cal Education) has helped bring many in
teresting and valuable speakers to cam
pus this year. While we are impressed by
its stated desire to choose an issue first
and specific speakers second, we are con
cerned about redundancies that may de
velop among SPA, the ASSU Speakers Bu
reau and SCOPE. We endorse the fee
assessment requests of all three. But we
are concerned about groups that get fund
ing solely to disburse that money without
staging programs of their own, largely
latching onto programs that other groups
organize — a description that fits SCOPE
more than the other two. We recommend
that SCOPE consider soberly whether it
might be very ineffective in its current in
carnation, and whether member's
energies and students' money might not
be better directed to other channels.

Stanford Progressive
Alliance - Yes
Stanford Progressive Alliance repre
sents a broad coalition of groups, ranging
from women's and minority groups to the
Office Staff Organizing Committee and
political organizations. They seek an
assessment to fund their constituent
groups, to publish a biweekly newsletter,
to put on a speaker series and to visit
dorms to bring a progressive perspective
— often ignored at Stanford — to wider
campus attention.
We endorse their request. They are not
the narrowly dogmatic organization their
critics accuse them of being. They repre
sent a outlook not adequately represented
or institutionalized here. Such diversity is
essential to a climate of intellectual
growth and development that benefits the
University community as a whole.
