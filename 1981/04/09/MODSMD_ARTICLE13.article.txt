## Spring break at Stanley Kaplan's retreat 
### 
During finals week, I had the
pleasure of talking to people
about their plans for spring
break. Unlike previous years,
this year very few people were
remaining at school. A good tan
seemed to be the common goal,
and students made their travel
plans accordingly. Palm
Springs, Mexico, San Diego and
Hawaii were common destina
tions. Bitterly I thought about
my destination — New Jersey.
New Jersey itself, although
California may find this hard to
believe, would have been toler
able. While it might be some
what of a "pit," you can never
get bored, as New York City is
right next door. In addition,
drinking age is 19 and there is no
sales tax on clothes.
But 1 wasn't heading toward
New Jersey in general; I was
heading for the Stanley H.
Kaplan center. While my
friends were lying in the sand
watching the surf, I would be
sitting hunched over a tape rec
order with headphones pressed
against the side of my head I
could have experienced this in
Stanley s Palo Alto branch, but
figured there would be fewer
panicking pre-meds stampeding
my hometown center.
Stanley H. Kaplan makes his
living by preparing college stu
dents for various standardized
tests. He charges you a small
fortune, and then furnishes you
with a set of review notes; he

also gives you access to practice
tests and tapes. All the major
standardized tests are repre
sented He'll prepare you for the
LSAT, DAT, GRE, GMAT, or
MCAT. MCATs were my future
determining exams.
While driving toward the cen
ter for my first cramming ses
sion, I began to think about how
much this one test actually
meant. Ever since grade school,
tests have been devised by in
structors to evaluate students.
Various tests are administered,
and an individual's per
formance is taken to reflect the
amount of knowledge he
possesses. Some people in
variably know everything,
while others know next to noth
ing. The majority of students
fall somewhere in between.
The results of the tests are
rated, either on an absolute
scale that determines how close
you are to knowing everything,
or on a relative scale, which
compares how much you know
to how much the average stu
dent knows. From the students'
point of view, good tests are
ones where scores actually do
reflect the degree of knowledge
they have, while bad ones are
those that do not indicate the ex
tent to which they comprehend
the material But as a student,
you come to accept the fact that
tests, whether they be good or
bad, are often used to rate you.

Tests that rate knowledge are
tolerable, it's when tests rate in
telligence that they lose their
validity. Equating knowledge
with intelligence on the basis of
test scores is a dangerous prac
tice, yet a common one. Tests
such as MCATs are given under
the auspices of serving as a
standard by which a school can
rate an individual's knowledge
of specific subjects, as well as
his ability to apply and as
similate unfamiliar facts.
The admissions boards use
these scores, in conjuction with
a G.P.A., to decide if a can
didate is qualified for entrance
into their school. What this ac
tually translates into is that the
schools are using a student's
performance on a test to de
termine whether he would be a
good doctor.
It is absolutely ridiculous to
correlate one's ability to read a
three-dimensional graph with
one's potential for being a good
doctor. An individual that is in
capable of deciding which re
agent he should use to cleave an
ester is not necessarily one who
would be incapable of diagnos
ing a case of cancer. It is also
possible that the student actual
ly does know the material. He
may take multiple choice tests
poorly, or he may just have had
a bad day.
This possibility is not con
sidered by the admissions men.

as they do not look favorably
upon those students who have to
take the exam twice. They feel
the tests reflect an intelligence
that should not vary from one
test to another. On the other
hand, those that do test well
may very well be bright, or they
may just be good test takers. In
either case, some students with
fifteens on their MCATs are so
cial misfits that will become
doctors with poor bedside
manners.
Parts of the test are valid, but
the emphasis which it is given is
far too great. Students spend 20
years in preparation for a ca
reer, and their fate is largely de
termined by an eight-hour
exam. One consequence of this
is that the student himself be
gins to interpret the test the way
the medical schools do. A stu
dent who does poorly is apt to
think that he is stupid because
he too inappropriately equates
his performance with his in
telligence.
But his future is greatly in
fluenced by the test; thus he
willingly spend $400 in an effort
to improve his scores. For in the
application process the test re
sults are crucial. It was with
this realization that I resigned
myself to a spring break at the
New Jersey Stanley Kaplan cen
ter.

this realization that I resigned
myself to a spring break at the
New Jersey Stanley Kaplan cen

During finals week, I had the
pleasure of talking to people
about their plans for spring
break. Unlike previous years,
this year very few people were
remaining at school. A good tan
seemed to be the common goal,
and students made their travel
plans accordingly. Palm
Springs, Mexico, San Diego and
Hawaii were common destina
tions. Bitterly I thought about
my destination — New Jersey.
New Jersey itself, although
California may find this hard to
believe, would have been toler
able. While it might be some
what of a "pit," you can never
get bored, as New York City is
right next door. In addition,
drinking age is 19 and there is no
sales tax on clothes.
But 1 wasn't heading toward
New Jersey in general; I was
heading for the Stanley H.
Kaplan center. While my
friends were lying in the sand
watching the surf, I would be
sitting hunched over a tape rec
order with headphones pressed
against the side of my head I
could have experienced this in
Stanley s Palo Alto branch, but
figured there would be fewer
panicking pre-meds stampeding
my hometown center.
Stanley H. Kaplan makes his
living by preparing college stu
dents for various standardized
tests. He charges you a small
fortune, and then furnishes you
with a set of review notes; he

also gives you access to practice
tests and tapes. All the major
standardized tests are repre
sented He'll prepare you for the
LSAT, DAT, GRE, GMAT, or
MCAT. MCATs were my future
determining exams.
While driving toward the cen
ter for my first cramming ses
sion, I began to think about how
much this one test actually
meant. Ever since grade school,
tests have been devised by in
structors to evaluate students.
Various tests are administered,
and an individual's per
formance is taken to reflect the
amount of knowledge he
possesses. Some people in
variably know everything,
while others know next to noth
ing. The majority of students
fall somewhere in between.
The results of the tests are
rated, either on an absolute
scale that determines how close
you are to knowing everything,
or on a relative scale, which
compares how much you know
to how much the average stu
dent knows. From the students'
point of view, good tests are
ones where scores actually do
reflect the degree of knowledge
they have, while bad ones are
those that do not indicate the ex
tent to which they comprehend
the material But as a student,
you come to accept the fact that
tests, whether they be good or
bad, are often used to rate you.

Tests that rate knowledge are
tolerable, it's when tests rate in
telligence that they lose their
validity. Equating knowledge
with intelligence on the basis of
test scores is a dangerous prac
tice, yet a common one. Tests
such as MCATs are given under
the auspices of serving as a
standard by which a school can
rate an individual's knowledge
of specific subjects, as well as
his ability to apply and as
similate unfamiliar facts.
The admissions boards use
these scores, in conjuction with
a G.P.A., to decide if a can
didate is qualified for entrance
into their school. What this ac
tually translates into is that the
schools are using a student's
performance on a test to de
termine whether he would be a
good doctor.
It is absolutely ridiculous to
correlate one's ability to read a
three-dimensional graph with
one's potential for being a good
doctor. An individual that is in
capable of deciding which re
agent he should use to cleave an
ester is not necessarily one who
would be incapable of diagnos
ing a case of cancer. It is also
possible that the student actual
ly does know the material. He
may take multiple choice tests
poorly, or he may just have had
a bad day.
This possibility is not con
sidered by the admissions men.

as they do not look favorably
upon those students who have to
take the exam twice. They feel
the tests reflect an intelligence
that should not vary from one
test to another. On the other
hand, those that do test well
may very well be bright, or they
may just be good test takers. In
either case, some students with
fifteens on their MCATs are so
cial misfits that will become
doctors with poor bedside
manners.
Parts of the test are valid, but
the emphasis which it is given is
far too great. Students spend 20
years in preparation for a ca
reer, and their fate is largely de
termined by an eight-hour
exam. One consequence of this
is that the student himself be
gins to interpret the test the way
the medical schools do. A stu
dent who does poorly is apt to
think that he is stupid because
he too inappropriately equates
his performance with his in
telligence.

fluenced by the test; thus he
willingly spend $400 in an effort
to improve his scores. For in the
