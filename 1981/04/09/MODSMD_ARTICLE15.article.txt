## 'No justification' for accepting abortion 
### 
The issue of abortion is a politician's
nightmare, for there is no middle ground on
which to stand. Our society has become
polarized by two highly vocal groups: those
in favor of legalized abortion ("pro-choice"
in their own terms) represented by feminist
groups, and those opposed (selt-styled "pro
life") most visibly represented by religious
groups.
The central focus of the controversy con
cerning abortion is the point at which the
fetus becomes a human. Unfortunately,
even that question is a subject of con
troversy. What is a human? There can be no
definition based on shape or size. Time in
the womb is the criterion applied by the Su
preme Court of the United States. Supposed
ly that point at which the fetus can survive
outside the womb is the line of demarcation
between thing and person. The validity of
this is questionable, however, for a one or
two-year old child cannot survive unaided
for long, nor can a helpless elderly person,
nor can a paralytic.
The pro-life groups believe that the very
moment of conception is the point at which
humanity is assumed. That may seem an ex
treme position, but it gives the benefit of
doubt to the developing child, and any other
criteria are harsh in comparison.
The issue resolves itself into a dispute be
tween the rights of the mother and the rights

of the unborn child. In one case, it is the
right of the mother to choose not to have the
child; in the other, it is the right of the child
to live. The priority of life over convenience
seems to be indisputable.
For convenience is the most all-encom
passing term to describe those reasons for
which an abortion may be performed. A new
child may seem an insurmountable finan
cial problem ; the pregnancy and birth are
physically discomforting to a degree under
stood only to those women who have under
gone them; the societal stigma against un
wed motherhood, while not as strong as it
was formerly, is still a source of emotional
trauma for all involved, particularly the
mother and child; and some women simply
do not want to have children. I have no an
swer to offer concerning cases involving
rape or difficult birth.
Those are heavy burdens, but they must
be balanced against the weightiest of all
gifts; life.
We must do all we can to eliminate the
possibilities for unwanted pregnancies.
Non-abortive contraceptive measures and
widespread education in their use will not
save lives, but they will prevent deaths.
The efforts of family planning agencies
should be augmented. Facilities for the care
of unwed mothers and the adoption of un
wanted children should be increased. Last
ly, most effective but least practical, our so

ciety must learn that sex is not merely a
means of obtaining pleasure. We have
within us the capacity to engender life —
that is not a small gitt, and it should not be
treated as such.
The availability of abortion serves to
make human life trivial, and the act of pro
creation insignificant tor other than physi
cal gratification. A reliance on abortion as
the ultimate contraceptive measure is an
abrogation ot responsibility on the part of
both male and female, with the bulk of the
burden borne by the woman. It is often
viewed as presumptuous, if not downright
arrogant, for a man to speak out on this is
sue.
A fetus is not merely an appendage of a
woman's body which she may cause to be re
moved at will, though. Abortion is not mere
ly a woman's issue — it is a human issue.
Yes, I will never have to bear a child — I will
never be able to bear a child.
This may seem an instance of one person
or group attempting to impose a certain mo
rality on another. That is true except that
the moral standard in question is the value
of human life. To accept abortion as in
evitable is to accept war as inevitable — no
solution to either is easy or even promising,
but that is no justification tor acceptance.

The central focus of the controversy con
cerning abortion is the point at which the
fetus becomes a human. Unfortunately,
even that question is a subject of con
troversy. What is a human? There can be no
definition based on shape or size. Time in
the womb is the criterion applied by the Su
preme Court of the United States. Supposed
ly that point at which the fetus can survive
outside the womb is the line of demarcation
between thing and person. The validity of
this is questionable, however, for a one or
two-year old child cannot survive unaided
for long, nor can a helpless elderly person,
nor can a paralytic.
The pro-life groups believe that the very
moment of conception is the point at which
humanity is assumed. That may seem an ex
treme position, but it gives the benefit of
doubt to the developing child, and any other
criteria are harsh in comparison.
The issue resolves itself into a dispute be
tween the rights of the mother and the rights

of the unborn child. In one case, it is the
right of the mother to choose not to have the
child; in the other, it is the right of the child
to live. The priority of life over convenience
seems to be indisputable.
For convenience is the most all-encom
passing term to describe those reasons for
which an abortion may be performed. A new
child may seem an insurmountable finan
cial problem ; the pregnancy and birth are
physically discomforting to a degree under
stood only to those women who have under
gone them; the societal stigma against un
wed motherhood, while not as strong as it
was formerly, is still a source of emotional
trauma for all involved, particularly the
mother and child; and some women simply
do not want to have children. I have no an
swer to offer concerning cases involving
rape or difficult birth.
Those are heavy burdens, but they must
be balanced against the weightiest of all
gifts; life.
We must do all we can to eliminate the
possibilities for unwanted pregnancies.
Non-abortive contraceptive measures and
widespread education in their use will not
save lives, but they will prevent deaths.
The efforts of family planning agencies
should be augmented. Facilities for the care
of unwed mothers and the adoption of un
wanted children should be increased. Last
ly, most effective but least practical, our so

ciety must learn that sex is not merely a
means of obtaining pleasure. We have
within us the capacity to engender life —
that is not a small gitt, and it should not be
treated as such.
The availability of abortion serves to
make human life trivial, and the act of pro
creation insignificant tor other than physi
cal gratification. A reliance on abortion as
the ultimate contraceptive measure is an
abrogation ot responsibility on the part of
both male and female, with the bulk of the
burden borne by the woman. It is often
viewed as presumptuous, if not downright
arrogant, for a man to speak out on this is
sue.
A fetus is not merely an appendage of a
woman's body which she may cause to be re
moved at will, though. Abortion is not mere
ly a woman's issue — it is a human issue.
Yes, I will never have to bear a child — I will
never be able to bear a child.
This may seem an instance of one person
or group attempting to impose a certain mo
rality on another. That is true except that
the moral standard in question is the value
of human life. To accept abortion as in
evitable is to accept war as inevitable — no
solution to either is easy or even promising,
but that is no justification tor acceptance.
