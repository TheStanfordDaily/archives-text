Garbage crisis
California currently faces an
accelerating garbage crisis. It
discards more and more wastes
while available space for their
disposal decreases. Californi
ans produce over 46 million tons
of solid waste each year despite
the impending closure of one
third of its sanitary landfills in
the next five years. The public
needs to be awakened to this
problem, as well as to the in
creasing cost of waste disposal
and litter control - presently
over $700 million per year.
As State Solid Waste Man
agement Board Chairman
Terry Trumbull points out, "We
must develop recycling and
waste-to-energy systems. In
stead of throwing away valuable
resources, we can recycle cans,
bottles, and newspapers. The
resulting energy savings would
be 150 million gallons of oil a

year, or 4 percent of the state's
entire energy needs."
To increase public awareness
of the need for recycling, the
Great California Resource Ral
ly will be held Apr. 20-26. The
rally is a statewide citizen ac
tion program intended to in
crease public awareness and en
thusiasm for the need to gener
ate less waste and increase the
use of solid waste as a resource.
Sponsored by the State Solid
Waste Management Board, the
Resource Rally will consist of
thousands of community events
throughout the state. Individ
uals, community organizations,
businesses, industries, and gov
ernmental agencies are all in
volved in clean-up, recycling,
and public awareness activities.
As an example, the City of Palo
Alto will have a program on
April 25 including a variety of
activities.
Despite this broad support,
the Resource Rally is only
meaningful if it succeeds in get
ting Peninsula residents in
terested in controlling litter and

recycling.

In David Miller's column,
"Gun control promises mislead
ing," (Daily, Apr. 7) the author
states that "careful statistical
studies have suggested that the
effect (of gun ownership in
creasing homicides), if any, is
small." This claim is totally
false. What mystery "studies"
is Miller citing? Certainly not
those of the FBI, Bureau of Al
cohol, Tobacco and Firearms or
the Justice Department, which
all agree that the effect on
murder is astoundingly large.
Also, my plaudits to the au
thor's creative imagination
when he conjures dark
scenarios in which gun control
will cause our civil liberties to
be revoked and Big Brother to
lurk around every corner. If he
had, instead, looked at the facts,
he would not have needed to

strain his imagination to see
what would happen if gun con
trol were enacted in this coun
try; it already has been enacted.
In Washington D.C., the sale
of all handguns is prohibited un
der the Firearms Control Act of
1975. The result is that handgun
homicide has decreased by 26.2
percent, robberies by 22.5 per
cent. The U.S. Conference of
Mayors concluded, after con
sidering all other extraneous
factors, that "the Firearms
Control Act has been respon
sible for the significant reduc
tion in handgun crime in the Dis
trict of Columbia."
Is is revealing to note that
while President Reagan was
shot in Washington D C., the gun
that John Hinckley used was
purchased in Texas, a state
whose gun laws are among the
most lax in the nation. Who
knows how much more dramat
ic the drop in murder and rob
bery in the capital would be if le
gal handguns could not be
brought in from the rest of the
country?
So far I have heard no cries
that Washington D.C. has be
come a "police state." Have
you? Case closed.

Garbage crisis
California currently faces an
accelerating garbage crisis. It
discards more and more wastes
while available space for their
disposal decreases. Californi
ans produce over 46 million tons
of solid waste each year despite
the impending closure of one
third of its sanitary landfills in
the next five years. The public
needs to be awakened to this
problem, as well as to the in
creasing cost of waste disposal
and litter control - presently
over $700 million per year.
As State Solid Waste Man
agement Board Chairman
Terry Trumbull points out, "We
must develop recycling and
waste-to-energy systems. In
stead of throwing away valuable
resources, we can recycle cans,
bottles, and newspapers. The
resulting energy savings would
be 150 million gallons of oil a

year, or 4 percent of the state's
entire energy needs."
To increase public awareness
of the need for recycling, the
Great California Resource Ral
ly will be held Apr. 20-26. The
rally is a statewide citizen ac
tion program intended to in
crease public awareness and en
thusiasm for the need to gener
ate less waste and increase the
use of solid waste as a resource.
Sponsored by the State Solid
Waste Management Board, the
Resource Rally will consist of
thousands of community events
throughout the state. Individ
uals, community organizations,
businesses, industries, and gov
ernmental agencies are all in
volved in clean-up, recycling,
and public awareness activities.
As an example, the City of Palo
Alto will have a program on
April 25 including a variety of
activities.
Despite this broad support,
the Resource Rally is only
meaningful if it succeeds in get
ting Peninsula residents in
terested in controlling litter and

recycling.

Column misleading
In David Miller's column,
"Gun control promises mislead
ing," (Daily, Apr. 7) the author
states that "careful statistical
studies have suggested that the
effect (of gun ownership in
creasing homicides), if any, is
small." This claim is totally
false. What mystery "studies"
is Miller citing? Certainly not
those of the FBI, Bureau of Al
cohol, Tobacco and Firearms or
the Justice Department, which
all agree that the effect on
murder is astoundingly large.
Also, my plaudits to the au
thor's creative imagination
when he conjures dark
scenarios in which gun control
will cause our civil liberties to
be revoked and Big Brother to
lurk around every corner. If he
had, instead, looked at the facts,
he would not have needed to

strain his imagination to see
what would happen if gun con
trol were enacted in this coun
try; it already has been enacted.
In Washington D.C., the sale
of all handguns is prohibited un
der the Firearms Control Act of
1975. The result is that handgun
homicide has decreased by 26.2
percent, robberies by 22.5 per
cent. The U.S. Conference of
Mayors concluded, after con
sidering all other extraneous
factors, that "the Firearms
Control Act has been respon
sible for the significant reduc
tion in handgun crime in the Dis
trict of Columbia."
Is is revealing to note that
while President Reagan was
shot in Washington D C., the gun
that John Hinckley used was
purchased in Texas, a state
whose gun laws are among the
most lax in the nation. Who
knows how much more dramat
ic the drop in murder and rob
bery in the capital would be if le
gal handguns could not be
brought in from the rest of the
country?
