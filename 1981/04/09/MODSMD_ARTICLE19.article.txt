# â€˜Jewelry through the ages'
## Trinkets displayed on museum tour 
### Karen Johnson 
Having presented myself
at the Stanford museum at
noon, yesterday, to take a
tour entitled 'Jewelry
through the Ages,' I expected
at the very least to be led
through rooms of dazzling
diamonds, glittering gold,
and creative masterpieces in
the spirit ot Salvador Dali's
pulsating heart Along with
many others, I was doomed
to disappointment.
'Jewelry through the
Ages' is not, as you might ex
pect, a special exhibit ot
gems. It is merely a tour de
signed by the museum to
point out the jewelry they
have on permanent display,
along with a brief history of
jewelry, illustrated through
paintings and the few pieces
they have. The tour could
more aptly have been called
'Jewelry Trivia.'
Did you know, for example
that the word 'carat' comes
from the word carob, as in
carob-covered yogurt balls?
Or perhaps you might be
interested to know that in an
cient Greece, prostitutes
wore cupid-shaped earrings
as means ot identification, or
that lapis-lazuli was often
ground up and taken as a
tonic to cure fevers.
All this is fine if one is
about to appear on a quiz
show next week, or is looking
for new information to throw
into dinner party conversa

tions, but it's scarcely rele
vant to the artistic history of
jewelry.
But for those people who
haven't visited the Stanford
Museum, or who aren't
aware that jewelry is dis
played there, it is nice to
know that they do have a few
pieces worth looking at.
Probably the most in
teresting room, and the room
where the tour started, is the
Egyptian Room. Enclosed in

... it is not, as you might expect, a special
exhibit of gems. It is merely a tour designed
by the museum to point out the jewelry they
have on permanent display.

glass cases one will find
amulets made ot blue-green
ceramic, representing such
exotic gods as Isis, Osiris and
Bes, which call forth mys
tical memories of James
Frazier's 'Golden Bough.'
There are rings called fin
ger-circles because they rep
resent unending life, magical
scarabs that represent re
generation, and necklaces of
amethyst, which were ap
parently worn in the hope
that they would keep the
wearer sober.
Another interesting room
for jewelry is the Oriental
Room. Here one can see gilt
statues of Bodisattva Kuan-
Yin, and his female coun

terpart , Bodisattva
Avalokitesvara. The Bod
isattva is one who, in Orien
tal culture, postpones entry
into Nirvana in order to stay
and help others. Unlike Bud
dha, who never wears jew
elry, the bodies of both the
male and the female Bod
isattvas are literally encased
with gems and other or
namentation.
The remainder of the tour
centered around European

paintings, religious and oth
erwise. The reason for look
ing at these paintings we
were told, was so that we
could see how many men
were wearing earrings. As it
turns out, it's not really ter
ribly outre for a man to wear
an earring, given such
notable, historic figures as
Shakespeare, Caesar and
Charles the Second, who suc
cumbed to the fashion. Ac
cording to the tour guide,
current practitioners of this
mode of adornment are
Ringo Starr and Willie
Nelson, who were both re
cently interviewed on tele
vision by Barbara Walters
wearing the item in question.

The most bizarre depiction
of jewelry was saved for
last; a painting done by
Astley David Montague Co
oper called Mrs. Stanford's
Jewelry Collection.' The
painting is exactly what it
says it is. It shows about 50
pieces ot jewelry sitting out
on a cloth-covered table.
Each piece is numbered.
Mrs. Stanford apparently
commissioned the painting
prior to selling all of the
jewels so that future gener
ations of the family would
know what they were miss
ing.
The tour completed, one
had to give credit to the
Museum for their efficient
use of time. We were
marched around the various
rooms as if we were training
for a marathon, and were
given no more than a few sec
onds in front of each display
or painting to try and see
what we were being shown.
Despite the courageous
pace, however, the tour ran
over the allocated time.
For those people truly in
terested in jewelry, my sug
gestion would be to browse
around the museum at your
own pace, since the typed de
scriptions that accompany
each piece are more in
formative than the tour. But
it it's trivia you're look for,
well, that can just as easily
be found in any encyclopedia
