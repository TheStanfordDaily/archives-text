El Salvador is a classic case of
polarized politics, exemplifying the
problems ot many Latin American
countries today, according to Pro
fessor John Wirth, director of Latin
American Studies at Stanford.
History Prof, Barton Bernstein,
Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Lew
is Gann and Anthropology Prof. Wil
liam Durham joined Wirth in address
ing nearly 400 people in Kresge
Auditorium last night.
Wirth, who moderated the torum,
said that El Salvador has the worst
"man-land ratio" in Latin America,
"a classic situation for social ex
plosion."
For the Reagan administration,
Bernstein said, El Salvador is "an ide
al test case" tor the United States to
stand up to the Soviet Union.
Bernstein said that "the United
States is seeking to internationalize
what is basically an indigenous prob
lem." He continued, "There is nothing

more dangerous than such an im
pression of world responsibility."
Gann, a frequent commentator on
Third World issues, said that "the
Communists see the conflict in El
Salvador as part of their greater
worldwide struggle." Gann said that
we must "prevent the Iron Curtain
trom descending on the New World."
But Bernstein said, "It is a mistake
to talk about El Salvador in terms of
Communism." Bernstein said,
"There is no reason to conclude that
Communism will flourish if we sup
port the FDR" (the Revolutionary
Democratic Front).
Examining the actions ot the Carter
administration, Bernstein said that
Carter initially backed the estab
lishment of the junta because ot
American support for the promised
land reforms. Though these reforms
did not materialize, we were "locked
in" to our position, having as the alter
native an "unpalatable" leftist re
gime.

Durham, who has lived in El
Salvador and written a book on the
country, criticized two popular U.S.
images of the situation in El Salvador.
First, Durham said, many Ameri
cans have the impression that the
problems in El Salvador are "recent
and imported from abroad," that El
Salvador "has not been the same since
revolution erupted two years ago."
Durham said that the problems in El
Salvador are clearly rooted in its own
history.
Durham said the second misconcep
tion many Americans have is that the
present regime is a "centrist, re
formist government" caught in the
middle between the left and the right.
Durham said that most progressives
have been forced out of the govern
ment. He said agrarian reform has
been a "virtual disaster . . . minor in
scope, inappropriate and repressive."
In a brief historical synopsis, Wirth
said that the export dependent econo
my of El Salvador has been dominated

by an oligarchy ot 14 families since the
late 19th century, "an oligarchy that
knows how to defend itself,'' demon
strated by its long history of imposing
military rule.
In October 1979, a reformist junta
backed by the United States replaced
the military government of General
Carlos Romero in a coup d'etat. Wirth
said that this was the last chance for
democratic reform that could help
avoid a "social explosion." In Novem
ber 1979, agrarian reforms were pro
posed but rejected by the right which
resulted in the resignation of the
progressive civilian members of the
junta.
Violence steadily increased in the
following months, with the assassina
tion in March 1980 of Archbishop Os
car Romero and the murder of four
American nuns a tew months later.
Wirth said U.S. aid to the military
regime in El Salvador was stopped
only briefly, despite the accelerated
repression and violence.
