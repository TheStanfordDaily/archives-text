## Brand new face or empty dance: two view new Who This is no social crisis, it's new direction 
### Douglas Ackerman Jeff Lange 
Although the Who's new
Face Dances lacks the con
ceptual brilliance of either
Tommy or (Juadrophenia
and does not contain the
thunderous epic rock of
Who's .\ext. the album is an
innovative step in a new
direction. Marked with little
social commentary. Pete
Townshend's seven new
songs manifest a more op
timistic, playful attitude and
utilize less ot the hard edges
that have characterized The
Who's music tor the last dec
ade. In addition, the two ef
fectively positioned com
positions bv bassist John
Entwistle are spicy, fast
paced complements to
Townshend's more
melodious tunes.
The album kicks off with
possibly the most pop-ori
ented song The Who has ever
produced. With a familiar
Townshend synthesizer
backbone and a punchy beat
delivered by new drummer
Kenney Jones. "You Better
You Bet" is an entertaining
"ditty" destined to be a radio
hit. The message relayed is
clear: there are to be no hard
strains a la "old T-Rex —
Who's Next? on Face
Dances.
The second track, "Don't
Let Go the Coat" beckons us
to "forget the war dances"
and just "get the hang of

hanging in there someday."
The vengeful Roger Daltrey
vocals of The Who by Num
bers era has been replaced by
a nothing complacency. Al
though the song's tone ade
quately fits the theme.
Townshend's capitulating
philosophy is a disappoint
ment. We should not swallow
his new parasitic, wimpy
stance Townshend's new
conservatism is affirmed in
"Cache Cache." in which he
provides a lecture on the
evils of unctuousness:
"Don't jump in expectin'
fun."
"Did You Steal My Mon
ey" reflects a playful in
security totally different
from the intense paranoia ot
1975s "How Many Friends."
This track features a bouncy
synthesizer lick similar to
the one in 1972s "Join To
gether." along with a de
lightfully inflected vocal by
Daltrey.
Townshend demonstrates
his versatility as both song
writer and guitarist in "How
Can You Do It Alone." This
composition addresses the
taboo subject of auto
sexuality with humor and
honest curiosity, and it laces
Entwistle's bubbly bass rip
ples and Pete's pert harmo
nies with mischievous
moans. Once again, a strong
percussion foundation is sup
plied by Kenney Jones.

Townshend reaches the
height of his new expression
in "Daily Records," the sec
ond best song on the album,
and one that compares well
against the best Who Are
You tracks. The frustration
of "New Song" is replaced
with a cheery optimism It no
longer matters it it's "the
same old song." rather it's
the joy of making the song
that counts.
•Just uanna he making
dail\ records
Can't exist no more in
chains and fetters.
In keeping with
Townshend's habit of saving
an album's finest music tor
the last track, "Another
Tricky Day" closes Face
Dances. Townshend's lyrics
solidify his novel acceptance
of society's illnesses as
merely "gentle nagging
pains." Pete has finalized his
exchange of violent re
belliousness in favor of
steady, slow progress. "An
other Tricky Day" features
an inspiring singing con
versation between Daltrey
and Townshend in which
Townshend speaks as an as
sumed authority. The
album's title can be in
terpreted with respect to this
tune: social crises can be
averted by tricky, dance-like
maneuvers. Unfortunately,
Townshend's idealism is ov
ershadowed by reality: the
problems of our society are
still more serious than he ac
knowledges on this album.
However, "Another Tricky
Day" is fun. enthusiastic,
and should provide many ex
citing concert moments.
"The Quiet One" and
"You," the two new Entwis
tle songs, are both driving
rockers that are positioned
well on the album to change
its pace. "The Quiet One" is
the Ox's response to those
who arbitrarily label him tor

his chronic reticence. Cliche
ridden. strained, and a bit
tiresome. "The Quiet One"
does not stand up to any of
John's former compositions
such as "Had Enough" and
"Success Story." "You''
fares somewhat better. The
bass runs rampant here, pro
viding both guttural power
and sliding transitions to and
from Daltrev's vocals. The
song's lyrics don't add up to
much, but Entwistle does
have a way of throwing to
gether multiple bass tracks
into a pretty fair tune. More
could have been expected of
John, however, when one
considers his blossoming on
Who Are You.

Face Dances is not a great
album. In fact, it one
staunchly sticks to historical
Who criteria to judge it, the
album looks downright dis
appointing. However, this is
not an album continuous with
The Who's past. It is a new
direction; the debut album ot
a new Who. The age of hard
rock is over, Townshend tells
us. Rigorous intellectualiz
ing is not crucial. After over
a decade of rough, biting
edges and conceptualiza
tions, Pete has a license to
explore other areas. Face
Dances is "no crisis." It's
just The Who having fun. And
after the trauma of Keith
Moon's death and the stam
pede at Cincinnati, no other
group deserves it more.
