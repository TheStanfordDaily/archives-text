# Translation, staging battle in ‘Oedipus'
## 
### Stephen Nash 
Sophocles' Oedipus the King may be over
2000 years old. but it remains a powerful
theatrical experience, and continues to be
produced and translated for each new gen
eration. It also continues to offer new liter
ary inspiration. Robbe-Grillet's idea for the
"new novel" — with its emphasis on the ex
pressive uses of structure — can be traced
to the resonances and circular sense of time
in this drama.
For the play's current run at the Nitery, it
has been given a new translation by director
Rush Rehm, designed to focus on the rich
texture of Sophocles' language. In contrast,
the production itself is very stark. There is
no set. and just the barest hint of costumes.
Only the lighting is complex.
There are many wonderful things that
could be said about both the translation and
the production in this version of the play.

Unfortunately, the two do not work well to
gether. While watching the play, one must
make a decision as to whether to concen
trate on the words or on the staging.
Rehm's translation demands a lot ot at
tention. since the language and gram
matical constructions are often complex. It
does not seem to correspond well to natural
speech rhythms, and so the listener is often
several words behind the actor, trying to
figure out what has just been said. It often
seems that it was more designed to be read
than to be acted.
The staging, on the other hand, em
phasizes the instinctive and the non-verbal.
The complex lighting is used to define the
mood. The actors are posed (with great
power) as elements in a kinetic sculpture.
And. for the choruses, the words are more
important as sounds than as ideas.
Very early on. the script intrudes on the

story. The tragedy is communicated much
better by the whispers flashing from one ac
tor to another, by the writhing mounds ot
bodies, and by the cruel beams of light.

The acting doesn't always assist the
translation. Jeff Ford, as Oedipus, gives a
near unvaried performance which does not
sustain interest throughout the play. Steve
Vineberg (as Teiresias) and Karyn Dietz
(as Jocasta) are the most successful, phras
ing their performances with imagination.
The actors in the other smaller roles often
seem uncomfortable with the words they
are speaking.
This staging of Oedipus the King works
best on an instinctive level. It would have
been much more satisfying to see it with a
simpler translation, one that penetrated our
minds without disturbing our emotions.
