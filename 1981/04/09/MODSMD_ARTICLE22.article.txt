Hope I die before I net old
— Pete Townshend, "My
Generation"
It's a different world than
it was in 1966 when the Who
tirst sang "My Generation."
John Lennon is dead. Less
profound — but no less un
imaginable 15 years ago —
Bob Dylan has embraced
Christianity. And when you
say Elvis, people think
you're talking about a skinny
iittle English guy with
glasses and a crewcut.
Quite frankly, it's not the
Who's generation anymore.
Pete Townshend, a selt-de
fined perpetual adolescent,
showed signs of growing up
on Empty (ilass, a solo
album released last year. He
wrote and sang passionately,
if not always eloquently,
about hard work, passion,
spirituality, his ambivalence
toward the rock press, and
the battle between in
stinctive, animal urges and
the intellect.
Townshend represents the
Old Wave (someone must
have coined the term by
now), that school of rockers
who reached stardom — and
most often their creative
apex — in the '60s and ear
ly 70s. The Old Wavers
have dealt in various ways
with the passing of time.
Some have become trend fol
lowers rather than trend set
ters (the Stones); some
make bland, uninspired rec
ords about life in the bike
path (James Taylor); some
have sold out (Rod Stewart);
some may seem to have sold
out, but perhaps, to para
phrase Tom Stoppard, are
simply doing their best work
(Paul McCartney).
Empty (ilass, more than
most records by Old Wave
artists, came to grips with
age and maturity, without
sacrificing the spirit and in
tensity that has always char
acterized Townshend s best
music. It proved that there is
rock after 35, and good rock
at that. What it lacked in
youthful bravado, it made up
tor in thoughtful maturity.
Though a solo record, it was
his best work with or without
the Who since Quad
rophenia.
On Face Dances, the new
Who album, Townshend has
abandoned both passion and
and the youthful bravado
which characterized the old
Who, and the result is sheer
mediocrity. Townshend
writes with little irony, and
his deadly seriousness, while
exhilarating on older, more
defiant songs ("Won't Get

Fooled Again" "I'm Free")
is close to embarrassing
here.
"You Better You Bet," the
record's first single, sub
stitutes sex for passion —
"You welcome me with open
arms and open legs" ... "I
lay on the bed with you, we
could make some book of rec
ords" — and the bravado is
less angry/defiant than ag
ing macho. Roger Daltrey, a
vocalist with the power and

range to deliver
Townshend's lyrics with con
viction, decides to skip the
melody after the tirst verse
in favor of a sing-song talky
style, and when he sings
"You better bet your lite,"
one must be forced to ask "on
what?" Sex? Sex with Pete
Townshend? No thanks.
The first two verses of
"How Can You Do It Alone"
cover the saddening ex
periences of a 50-year-old
flasher and a young man who
steals girlie magazines from
a store. Then we get to hear
that Pete's girl won't let him
into the shower with her, and
a potentially poignant song
about loneliness and frustra
tion leaves the singer
"scratching (his) jeans":
just a lousy jack-off joke.
Not all of the compositions
on Face Dances are by
Townshend. John Entwis
tle. who can do little wrong
on bass (listen to the opening
bars of both "You Better You
Bet" and "How Can You Do
It Alone"), contributes two
rockers that prove he has no
business writing lyrics. In
cluded in "You" and"The
Quiet One" are the following
phrases: "I'm going down
for the third time. . . Too hot
for me to handle . . . Pinch
me to see if I'm sleeping . . .
My goose is cooked . . .
There's a name tor girls like
you. . . You lead me on like a
lamb to the slaughter . . .
Then you act like a fish out of
water . . .You blow me away
just like a hurricane ... I
ain't never had the gift of gab
. . . Still water runs deep . . .
Sticks and stones may break

my bones . . . You won't hear
me with your head stuck in
the sand ... My head is in a
cloud." And this isn't even to
mention "Your arms are
open but your legs are
crossed. " Why are there legs
opening and closing all over
this record?
Not all of Face Dances is
mundane. "Daily Records"
is a song about living a vital
life even after one's is no
longer the "in" generation
("I just don't quite know how
to wear my hair no more/No
sooner cut it than they cut it
even more"); even though
Pete insists on telling us his
"balls are aching," the song
would have worked well on
Empty (ilass.
The album's best cuts end
each side. "Did You Steal My
Money," with its vaguely Po
lice-like verses, is an ex
cellent vehicle for Daltrey,
and "Another Tricky Day"
has a cunningly playful hook:
"This is no social crisis . . .
Just another tricky day for
you."
There are no important so
cial crises on Face Dances;
maybe that's why it seems
like such an unimportant rec
ord. The reason for this
might be the absence of the
late Keith Moon — a one-man
social crisis himself, whose
explosive drumming and
personality made every Who
song a potential neutron
bomb. But new drummer
Kenney Jones is also a mem
ber of the hit-'em-hard
school (he played for years
with the Small
Faces/Faces), and besides,
Moon's absence didn't hurt
Empty (ilass any.
It's easy to take an artist's
work — especially that of an
aging artist in a field that
emphasizes youthfulness —
and say "It's no good be
cause it isn't like the old
stuff." But while Face
Dances is no Who's Next, 10
years have passed, and
there's no reason why it
should be. Yet Townshend
proved only last year that he
can still write and play sig
nificant music, and though
"The Who" and "Pete
Townshend" are not mutual
ly exclusive terms, Pete pro
pels the band, and if he's off,
the Who is off.
That Face Dances is an in
consequential work is sad;
even though a mediocre Who
album is generally better
than most rock records,
(whatever the Wave), it's
hard not to expect a master
piece every time out. It may
not be the Who's generation,
but that's no excuse.

"You Better You Bet," the
record's first single, sub
stitutes sex for passion —
"You welcome me with open
arms and open legs" ... "I
lay on the bed with you, we
could make some book of rec
ords" — and the bravado is
less angry/defiant than ag
ing macho. Roger Daltrey, a
vocalist with the power and

range to deliver
Townshend's lyrics with con
viction, decides to skip the
melody after the tirst verse
in favor of a sing-song talky
style, and when he sings
"You better bet your lite,"
one must be forced to ask "on
what?" Sex? Sex with Pete
Townshend? No thanks.
The first two verses of
"How Can You Do It Alone"
cover the saddening ex
periences of a 50-year-old
flasher and a young man who
steals girlie magazines from
a store. Then we get to hear
that Pete's girl won't let him
into the shower with her, and
a potentially poignant song
about loneliness and frustra
tion leaves the singer
"scratching (his) jeans":
just a lousy jack-off joke.
Not all of the compositions
on Face Dances are by
Townshend. John Entwis
tle. who can do little wrong
on bass (listen to the opening
bars of both "You Better You
Bet" and "How Can You Do
It Alone"), contributes two
rockers that prove he has no
business writing lyrics. In
cluded in "You" and"The
Quiet One" are the following
phrases: "I'm going down
for the third time. . . Too hot
for me to handle . . . Pinch
me to see if I'm sleeping . . .
My goose is cooked . . .
There's a name tor girls like
you. . . You lead me on like a
lamb to the slaughter . . .
Then you act like a fish out of
water . . .You blow me away
just like a hurricane ... I
ain't never had the gift of gab
. . . Still water runs deep . . .
Sticks and stones may break

my bones . . . You won't hear
me with your head stuck in
the sand ... My head is in a
cloud." And this isn't even to
mention "Your arms are
open but your legs are
crossed. " Why are there legs
opening and closing all over
this record?
Not all of Face Dances is
mundane. "Daily Records"
is a song about living a vital
life even after one's is no
longer the "in" generation
("I just don't quite know how
to wear my hair no more/No
sooner cut it than they cut it
even more"); even though
Pete insists on telling us his
"balls are aching," the song
would have worked well on
Empty (ilass.
The album's best cuts end
each side. "Did You Steal My
Money," with its vaguely Po
lice-like verses, is an ex
cellent vehicle for Daltrey,
and "Another Tricky Day"
has a cunningly playful hook:
"This is no social crisis . . .
Just another tricky day for
you."
There are no important so
cial crises on Face Dances;
maybe that's why it seems
like such an unimportant rec
ord. The reason for this
might be the absence of the
late Keith Moon — a one-man
social crisis himself, whose
explosive drumming and
personality made every Who
song a potential neutron
bomb. But new drummer
Kenney Jones is also a mem
ber of the hit-'em-hard
school (he played for years
with the Small
Faces/Faces), and besides,
Moon's absence didn't hurt
Empty (ilass any.
It's easy to take an artist's
work — especially that of an
aging artist in a field that
emphasizes youthfulness —
and say "It's no good be
cause it isn't like the old
stuff." But while Face
Dances is no Who's Next, 10
years have passed, and
there's no reason why it
should be. Yet Townshend
proved only last year that he
can still write and play sig
nificant music, and though
"The Who" and "Pete
Townshend" are not mutual
ly exclusive terms, Pete pro
pels the band, and if he's off,
the Who is off.
That Face Dances is an in
consequential work is sad;
even though a mediocre Who
album is generally better
than most rock records,
(whatever the Wave), it's
hard not to expect a master
piece every time out. It may
not be the Who's generation,
but that's no excuse.


Pete Townshend, by Colin
Shelf of Norwich.
Hope I die before I net old
— Pete Townshend, "My
Generation"
It's a different world than
it was in 1966 when the Who
tirst sang "My Generation."
John Lennon is dead. Less
profound — but no less un
imaginable 15 years ago —
Bob Dylan has embraced
Christianity. And when you
say Elvis, people think
you're talking about a skinny
iittle English guy with
glasses and a crewcut.
Quite frankly, it's not the
Who's generation anymore.
Pete Townshend, a selt-de
fined perpetual adolescent,
showed signs of growing up
on Empty (ilass, a solo
album released last year. He
wrote and sang passionately,
if not always eloquently,
about hard work, passion,
spirituality, his ambivalence
toward the rock press, and
the battle between in
stinctive, animal urges and
the intellect.
Townshend represents the
Old Wave (someone must
have coined the term by
now), that school of rockers
who reached stardom — and
most often their creative
apex — in the '60s and ear
ly 70s. The Old Wavers
have dealt in various ways
with the passing of time.
Some have become trend fol
lowers rather than trend set
ters (the Stones); some
make bland, uninspired rec
ords about life in the bike
path (James Taylor); some
have sold out (Rod Stewart);
some may seem to have sold
out, but perhaps, to para
phrase Tom Stoppard, are
simply doing their best work
(Paul McCartney).
Empty (ilass, more than
most records by Old Wave
artists, came to grips with
age and maturity, without
sacrificing the spirit and in
tensity that has always char
acterized Townshend s best
music. It proved that there is
rock after 35, and good rock
at that. What it lacked in
youthful bravado, it made up
tor in thoughtful maturity.
Though a solo record, it was
his best work with or without
the Who since Quad
rophenia.
On Face Dances, the new
Who album, Townshend has
abandoned both passion and
and the youthful bravado
which characterized the old
Who, and the result is sheer
mediocrity. Townshend
writes with little irony, and
his deadly seriousness, while
exhilarating on older, more
defiant songs ("Won't Get

Fooled Again" "I'm Free")
is close to embarrassing

longer the "in" generation
("I just don't quite know how
to wear my hair no more/No
sooner cut it than they cut it
even more"); even though
Pete insists on telling us his
"balls are aching," the song
would have worked well on
Empty (ilass.
The album's best cuts end
each side. "Did You Steal My
Money," with its vaguely Po
lice-like verses, is an ex
cellent vehicle for Daltrey,
and "Another Tricky Day"
has a cunningly playful hook:
"This is no social crisis . . .
Just another tricky day for
you."
There are no important so
cial crises on Face Dances;
maybe that's why it seems
like such an unimportant rec
ord. The reason for this
might be the absence of the
late Keith Moon — a one-man
social crisis himself, whose
explosive drumming and
personality made every Who
song a potential neutron
bomb. But new drummer
Kenney Jones is also a mem
ber of the hit-'em-hard
school (he played for years
with the Small
Faces/Faces), and besides,
Moon's absence didn't hurt
Empty (ilass any.
It's easy to take an artist's
work — especially that of an
aging artist in a field that
emphasizes youthfulness —
and say "It's no good be
cause it isn't like the old
stuff." But while Face
Dances is no Who's Next, 10
years have passed, and
there's no reason why it
should be. Yet Townshend
proved only last year that he
can still write and play sig
nificant music, and though
"The Who" and "Pete
Townshend" are not mutual
ly exclusive terms, Pete pro
pels the band, and if he's off,
the Who is off.
That Face Dances is an in
consequential work is sad;
even though a mediocre Who
album is generally better
than most rock records,
(whatever the Wave), it's
hard not to expect a master
piece every time out. It may
not be the Who's generation,
but that's no excuse.

Shelf of Norwich.
