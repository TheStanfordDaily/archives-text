# There's still the Dickies

### Vince Waldman Don Willenburg 
Sid Vicious is dead Johnny
Rotten is now John Lydon and
has played on American
Bandstand. Deborah Harry
went disco, appeared on the cov
er of People and sells Murjani
jeans. No one even remembers
Richard Hell. The Clash have
hit the Top 40, and the Ramones
have been produced by Phil
Spector (remember the
Ronettes?).
But there's still the Dickies.
As they showed last weekend at
the Old Waldorf, the Dickies re
main dedicated to the principles
(of punk: song after two-minute
isong played at breakneck speed
and a volume somewhere near
the pain threshhold, with a fran
•tic drum base frequently
bordering on the epileptic.
The Dickies first achieved
-[notoriety with a witty cover of
■the Moody Blues' pretentious
j"Nights in White Satin," cutting
the original's eight minutes to a
more manageable ninety sec
onds or so. They subject classics
from other pop and rock realms
to the same Procrustean bed ot
!the punk idiom. Their show in
cluded a definitive, if demented,
•version of "The Sounds of Si
ilence" perfectly apropos to an
audience whose 'familiarity
with Paul Simon was limited to
their parents' record collec
tions. Not content to poke fun
•only at those who hold their
work out as profound in lyrical
or musical senses, the Dickies
also ravaged Black Sabbath's

"Paranoid" with predictable
success
The Dickies' original songs
are also crafted well within the
acceptable limits ot their
chosen genre In proper punk
fashion, the band's premiere
love song is entitled "Hideous,"
and is performed as if they real
ly mean it.
The band makes only oc
cassional concessions to post
punk complexities, and even
these — such as a charmingly
woeful but mercifully brief at
tempt at a saxophone solo —
sound hopelessly out ot place.
The sound and performing style
of the band never leaves the con
fines of punk as it existed in its
early days, a purposeful strip
ping of the musical and institu
tional embellishments of 70s
rock which had eroded the pas
sion that spawned rock and roll
as a young and angry music.
Bands like the Sex Pistols
were so radical and refreshing
because they were so straight
forward, so honest about their
abilities (or lack thereof) and
about the point of their music.
But as the raw simplicity of the
early punk sound gradually be
came itself tedious and institu
tionalized, rising talent and
creative ambitions led even the
Sex Pistols to add more to their
music (as in The (ireat Rock
and Roll Swindle or the live
"Anarchy in the U.S.A."). The
Ramones learned how to play
their instruments and even
tually collaborated with Phil
Spector, not just for com

mercial reasons, but because
the old sound was too limiting,
especially for a . punk Wcl
tanschunu that emphasizes ex
pressiveness as the only virtue
in a world ot postindustrial at
omized depersonalization
The Dickies have rejected
this movement, playing
anachronism in a business that
readily forgets its heroes The
lead singer was given to osten
tatiously snarling 'We're a
punk rock band from L.A." and
similar remarks indicating that
the band considers itself a de
fiant bastion ot a truth the musi
cal world has forsaken for more
current trends.
In the words of an estab
lishment critic, "methinks they
doth protest too much." While
the Dickies stick to the howling
basics, their songs are far too
good-natured and the per
formance far too affected to
convincingly disgust. These
guys have never missed a meal
in their lives, and look too well
fed to be truly angry: without
anger, the screamed vocals and
sloppy musicianship become
rather pointless. Their fans are
not punks, but reasonably clean
looking 14-year-olds who
pogoed and slammed in an un
comprehending imitation of
older siblings who've moved on,
much as those who reached
puberty in the early Seventies
worshipped the '50s, the Beach
Boys, or the Love Generation.
It is not a criticism of the
Dickies that they are to punk
what Robert Gordon is to rock
abilly: preservationists who
copy the form of a genre without
ever really capturing or even
wanting to capture the spirit un
derlying it. It is more a com
ment on punk and the integra
tionists in the industry who have
made all pop music a diluted,
homogenized form of angry
Birmingham expressionism
that it needs traveling museum
pieces like the Dickies to con
vince us that the motivation
ever really existed.
