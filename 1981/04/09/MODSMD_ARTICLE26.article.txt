# XTC just another dog head band
## 
### Tony Kelly 
Any devoted music fan should know the
one axiom of rock singing: Any Doghead
Can Do It XTC's show at California Hall
last Thursday, however, left that maxim to
the opening band Meanwhile, they proved
the rule's important corollary: Not Every
Doghead Can Do It Well.
If that sounds cynical, it deserves to. Cali
fornia Hall itself was not the most hospi
table venue last Thursday, delaying the
start of the show from 8 to 9:30 p.m. for un
known reasons. The only entertainment
before then was in the bar, leaving most of
the young audience to amuse themselves by
buying shirts, buttons, badges, posters and
programs for XTC. Obviously, Virgin Rec
ords is putting a lot of bucks into promoting
these guys. Nice try, but awfully expensive,
and I'm in a foul mood as the show starts.
Hazel O'Connor opened the concert, to a
decidedly mixed reaction. For both of you
out there who care, Hazel starred in a ter
rible "new wave" tilm. Breaking Glass, last
summer, hyped to the teeth as the Next Big
Thing. Now she's on her own, and what did
she grow up to be? David Bowie. Or almost.
Well, she's cut her hair short and dyed it or
ange, her new album (Sons and Lovers)
looks like Bowie's Scary Monsters right
down to the lettering, and she does "charac
terizations'" while singing onstage. Really
artistic, huh? She seems to think so, and
that makes one of us. For despite the quality
of her band, Megahype (with a name show
ing a sense of humor totally lacking in
O'Connor), Hazel's pretensions of art only
succeeded in making herself look like a pro
foundly silly example of a singer caught up
in posing.
As a contrast, Wall of Voodoo, the Los An
geles-based band that appeared next, of
fered a startling definition of what a rock
singer should be. Wall of Voodoo has been
reviewed (very favorably) here a while
back, and they continued to make the same
synthesizer/percussion pop that dist
inguished them from the pack in the past.
However, last Thursday showed a new ele
ment of stagecraft, especially in singer Stan
Ridgeway. Ridgeway's voice is not quite in
the area one would consider "good" — his
range is not extensive, nor can he hold notes
like he has vacuum cleaners for lungs. Yet
Stan's timing, his passion, and his sense of
restraint (or lack thereof) are all flawless
— that night he seemed just as accurate
half-diving into the audience, insisting the
closing lines "I'm a nice guy" of "Can't

Make Love," then sarcastically joking after
the song, "Yeah, we're all nice guys. . . ."
The rest of the band shared in the mood, eas
ily shifting gears from the tense, dis
cordance sounds of "The Passenger" to an
affectionate version of "The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly" to a remake of Johnny Cash's
"Ring of Fire" that ended in a cacophony of
feedback and damaged instruments. Stan
Ridgeway and Wall of Voodoo will never end
up in the Gary Numan School of Electronic
Angst — they're having too much fun to be
pretentious, and it shows in the music.
Cancel what I said about that foul mood. .
About midnight or so, XTC burst upon the
scene, bringing my foul mood back with a
vengeance. I had only heard of a few of their
songs before, most notably "Making Plans
for Nigel," a fine electro-rock song of a few
years back. Since then, they've toned down
the quirky music, bought nicer clothes, and
starting fashioning Beatlesque harmony
pop in their LPs. Unfortunately, they also
seemed to undergo lobotomies in the proc
ess. And once again, the singer is the key.
Andy Partridge seems to wish he was
David Byrne — he yelps and squeals while
singing just like Byrne used to, and he plays
the same style of trebly guitar. That's not so
bad — I guess there are worse role models to
copy (ct. Bob "Call Me Bruce" Seger). But
every time after he yelps or squeals or
stamps his foot emphatically, Partridge
flashes this shit-eating grin, looking for all

the world like he just found a new toy in his
windpipe Annoying, yes — but not half as
annoying as the electric fan set up in front of
Andy tor his comfort (those Beau Brummel
clothes can get so warm), blocking the
views of several aydience members One
can almost hear him saying. "Sure, they
paid $9.50 and waited four hours, but if they
think I'm gonna sweat for em. well they've
got another thing coming!" All modern con
veniences for this bunch.
The rest of XTC exhibited this same at
mosphere — stylish pop with no sweat.
"Cuba." a potentially compelling song, was
given a cartoon treatment by a film loop be
hind the group showing the letters C, U. B
and A flitting about like boat figures from
Sesame Street. "Making Plans for Nigel,"
significantly, was rearranged to a more
commercial mode, with a much feebler im
pact. Surprising, disturbing to see from a
band that's called New Wave, but hardly en
joyable.
Of course, Andy Partridge and XTC don't
have to do anything more than provide pop
music — Lord knows they can make money
off it, for the fans ate up every move they
made Thursday. But by featuring two sup
porting bandslhat attempted more, and one
that succeeded brilliantly in Wall of Voodoo
(who may be outgrowing the "support" role
now), XTC proved themselves to be just an
other textbook proof of the Doghead Axiom
and its disappointing Corollary of Talent.

cordance sounds of "The Passenger" to an
affectionate version of "The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly" to a remake of Johnny Cash's
"Ring of Fire" that ended in a cacophony of
feedback and damaged instruments. Stan
Ridgeway and Wall of Voodoo will never end

pretentious, and it shows in the music.
Cancel what I said about that foul mood. .
About midnight or so, XTC burst upon the
scene, bringing my foul mood back with a
vengeance. I had only heard of a few of their
songs before, most notably "Making Plans
for Nigel," a fine electro-rock song of a few
years back. Since then, they've toned down
the quirky music, bought nicer clothes, and
starting fashioning Beatlesque harmony
pop in their LPs. Unfortunately, they also
seemed to undergo lobotomies in the proc
ess. And once again, the singer is the key.
Andy Partridge seems to wish he was
David Byrne — he yelps and squeals while
singing just like Byrne used to, and he plays
the same style of trebly guitar. That's not so
bad — I guess there are worse role models to
copy (ct. Bob "Call Me Bruce" Seger). But
every time after he yelps or squeals or
stamps his foot emphatically, Partridge
flashes this shit-eating grin, looking for all

the world like he just found a new toy in his
windpipe Annoying, yes — but not half as
annoying as the electric fan set up in front of
Andy tor his comfort (those Beau Brummel
clothes can get so warm), blocking the
views of several aydience members One
can almost hear him saying. "Sure, they
paid $9.50 and waited four hours, but if they
think I'm gonna sweat for em. well they've
got another thing coming!" All modern con
veniences for this bunch.
The rest of XTC exhibited this same at
mosphere — stylish pop with no sweat.
"Cuba." a potentially compelling song, was
given a cartoon treatment by a film loop be
hind the group showing the letters C, U. B
and A flitting about like boat figures from
Sesame Street. "Making Plans for Nigel,"
significantly, was rearranged to a more
commercial mode, with a much feebler im
pact. Surprising, disturbing to see from a
band that's called New Wave, but hardly en
joyable.
Of course, Andy Partridge and XTC don't
have to do anything more than provide pop
music — Lord knows they can make money
off it, for the fans ate up every move they
made Thursday. But by featuring two sup
porting bandslhat attempted more, and one
that succeeded brilliantly in Wall of Voodoo
(who may be outgrowing the "support" role
now), XTC proved themselves to be just an
other textbook proof of the Doghead Axiom
and its disappointing Corollary of Talent.


XTC (I. to r.: Andy Partridge, Colin Moulding, Terry Chambers, David Gregory)
Any devoted music fan should know the
one axiom of rock singing: Any Doghead
Can Do It XTC's show at California Hall
last Thursday, however, left that maxim to
the opening band Meanwhile, they proved
the rule's important corollary: Not Every
Doghead Can Do It Well.
If that sounds cynical, it deserves to. Cali
fornia Hall itself was not the most hospi
table venue last Thursday, delaying the
start of the show from 8 to 9:30 p.m. for un
known reasons. The only entertainment
before then was in the bar, leaving most of
the young audience to amuse themselves by
buying shirts, buttons, badges, posters and
programs for XTC. Obviously, Virgin Rec
ords is putting a lot of bucks into promoting
these guys. Nice try, but awfully expensive,
and I'm in a foul mood as the show starts.
Hazel O'Connor opened the concert, to a
decidedly mixed reaction. For both of you
out there who care, Hazel starred in a ter
rible "new wave" tilm. Breaking Glass, last
summer, hyped to the teeth as the Next Big
Thing. Now she's on her own, and what did
she grow up to be? David Bowie. Or almost.
Well, she's cut her hair short and dyed it or
ange, her new album (Sons and Lovers)
looks like Bowie's Scary Monsters right
down to the lettering, and she does "charac
terizations'" while singing onstage. Really
artistic, huh? She seems to think so, and
that makes one of us. For despite the quality
of her band, Megahype (with a name show
ing a sense of humor totally lacking in
O'Connor), Hazel's pretensions of art only
succeeded in making herself look like a pro
foundly silly example of a singer caught up
in posing.
As a contrast, Wall of Voodoo, the Los An
geles-based band that appeared next, of
fered a startling definition of what a rock
singer should be. Wall of Voodoo has been
reviewed (very favorably) here a while
back, and they continued to make the same
synthesizer/percussion pop that dist
inguished them from the pack in the past.
However, last Thursday showed a new ele
ment of stagecraft, especially in singer Stan
Ridgeway. Ridgeway's voice is not quite in
the area one would consider "good" — his
range is not extensive, nor can he hold notes
like he has vacuum cleaners for lungs. Yet
Stan's timing, his passion, and his sense of
restraint (or lack thereof) are all flawless
— that night he seemed just as accurate
half-diving into the audience, insisting the
closing lines "I'm a nice guy" of "Can't

Make Love," then sarcastically joking after
the song, "Yeah, we're all nice guys. . . ."
The rest of the band shared in the mood, eas
ily shifting gears from the tense, dis
cordance sounds of "The Passenger" to an
affectionate version of "The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly" to a remake of Johnny Cash's
"Ring of Fire" that ended in a cacophony of
feedback and damaged instruments. Stan
