# Gasohol's feasibility doubted
## 
### Bill Beyda 
Many Americans are now faced
with a confusing choice at the gasoline
pump: regular, unleaded, super, and
gasohol.
Although federal and state govern
ments are trying to make gasohol
more attractive to the public, Walter
Falcon of Stanford's Food Research
Institute is convinced that gasohol is
presently not practical for economic
reasons, and for the adverse effect it
will have on America's grain supply.
"Major investments in gasohol will
not be economically feasible until
crude oil prices reach $55-$6O a bar
rel," Falcon said. A major source tor
the alcohol in gasohol is corn, though
other sources, such as waste, are
being considered.
Many politicians, including former
Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, are
strong proponents of corn gasohol.
"I'm not surprised that former Sen
ator Bayh feels that way," Falcon
said, "but remember, he's from the
corn belt."
Falcon's main argument against
gasohol is its effect on the "nation's
low grain stocks." Any further deple
tion of the stocks, according to
Falcon, will cause prices to "ex
plode." Some plans would require up
to 20 percent of the nation's corn crop
being poured into gasohol, and this,
Falcon said, "doesn't make economic
sense."
Falcon said gasohol continues to be
produced, despite low corn stocks, for
two main reasons: "One is our in

credible desire to become an energy
self-sufficent nation and the second is
corn belt politicians who think the only
way to do it includes gasohol.
"I don't blame them. If I was a Corn
Belt farmer. I'd love the idea of a new
market for my product," Falcon said.
In addition to economics that aren't
feasible, Falcon said gasohol produc
tion presently takes more energy than
it nets, which amounts to a "negative
energy balance."
Jim Childress, former executive di
rector of the National Alcohol Fuels
Commission and a previous employee
of Bayh, said he agrees that at pres
ent, gasohol is not competitive
without federal and state help, but
said the market should be allowed to
develop slowly.
"Many people assume," Childress
said, "in making their statements
about gasohol's impact on the tood
supply, that the industry is going to
take off. Well, it's not. "
Part of the problem, according to
Childress, is that people are expecting
too much from gasohol. "I don't blame
the corn belt farmers for pushing
gasohol as the answer,' it's under
standable," Childress said.
Scientifically, gasohol is not a total
ly different product from the one mo
torists have been using for years. "In
stead of adding additives to the gaso
line to boost octane," Childress said,
"the companies add ethanol."
The environmental advantages are
not clear cut, according to Childress.
In some engines, gasohol reduces

emissions, and in some, it increases it,
he said. Childress also said the new ad
ministration is not concerned much
with auto emissions.
The federal and state governments
support gasohol in several ways. They
do not tax gasohol at the pump and
they provide loan guarantees for
gasoholresearch.
Falcon served on former President
Jimmy Carter's World Hunger Com
mittee, and through that committee's
report and other contacts with the
White House made his view on gasohol
known. "However, one report won't
stop the growing gasohol industry,"
Falcon said. He said the first step in
stopping increased gasohol production
is removing the government sub
sidies.
