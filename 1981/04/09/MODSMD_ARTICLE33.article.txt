Democrats renew attack on budget
Washington — House Democrats labeled President
Ronald Reagan's tax-cut proposals "the fiscal equivalent
ot faith in a free lunch" yesterday and said the spending
cuts he wants would hurt poor and middle-income Ameri
cans.
Renewing their attack on Reagan's economic program
in an unusual eight-page statement of "Democratic eco
nomic principles." party members declared their willing
ness to back an effort to restrain federal spending, provide
tax relief and reduce the size ot government
But the statement, approved by voice vote after a
closed-door session of the party caucus, took issue with the
specifics ot the Reagan approach and said Democrats
would reject a program "that puts the main burden of
fighting inflation on the backs of the middle and low in
come workers while providing unprecedented benefits for
the privileged few."
On taxes, the statement said belief that the adminis
tration's three-year tax cut plan will stimulate the econo
my without fueling inflation "is the fiscal equivalent of
faith in a free lunch.
"In sum. we pledge to develop a lean federal budget —
which puts us on the path to balancing the budget and pro
vides for the human needs of our people." said the
statement.
Warsaw Pact forces remain active
Washington — The Department of State said yesterday
that there has been no change in the posture of Warsaw
Pact military forces in and around Poland despite a Soviet
announcement that its prolonged military exercises,
named Soyuz 81, had ended.
"We continue to observe unusual military activity in the
area," William Dvess. a State Department spokesman,
said. "Soviet forces in and around Poland remain on a high
level of preparedness."
The State Department's comments followed by one day
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev's speech to the Czecho
slovak Communist Party Congress in Prague, in which he
said that he was confident that Poland's Communist lead
ers could handle the situation in their country brought on
by the rise of Solidarity, the independent trade union fed
eration. Shortly after Brezhnev's speech. Tass. the Soviet
news agency, announced the end of the Warsaw Pact ex
ercises.
The Soviet leader's address to the Czech party congress
initially was seen as an easing of the tension in the Polish
crisis. But yesterday, the Department of State indicated
that the U.S. government was not satisfied that the threat
of Soviet military intervention in Poland had passed.
Dyess, the department's press officer, said that
Brezhnev's speech had neither cleared up Soviet inten
tions with regard to military force, nor had it lessened po
litical pressures.
More Soviet forces in Afghanistan
New Delhi — The Soviet Union has increased the size of
its military force in Afghanistan to more then 100,000. a
Western diplomat asserted yesterday.
The diplomat cited no hard evidence of the additional
Soviet troops, but referred to numerous accounts from
sources in the Afghan capital of Kabul that "large num
bers of additional Soviet troops have arrived in the coun
try." If the report is correct, the Soviets have made their
first major increase in troop strength since the Red Armv

invaded Afghanistan 15 months ago.
Soviet air transport activity at Kabul airport, which re
portedly rose sharply last week, continued at an ac
celerated pace early this week, the diplomat said.
Estimates of the number of additional troops varied, but
most centered around 20.000 to 22.000. the equivalent of
about two divisions, according to the diplomat. That would
be a 25 percent increase over the estimated 80,000 to 85,000
Soviet troops that have been in Afghanistan since the De
cember 1979 invasion.
A separate diplomatic account estimated the number of
additional Soviet troops at between 5000 and 10,000.
Diplomats in New Delhi said they received reports of
new Soviet troops arriving in Kabul last week, but believed
initially that they were routine replacements.
Astronauts ready for shuttle flight
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — With the countdown and weath
er outlook brightening, astronauts John Young and Robert
Crippen flew here yesterday and declared they "are ready
to tly" the untested space shuttle Columbia into orbit
tomorrow.
The spacemen flew separate T-38 jet trainer planes
from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, landing at Pa
trick Air Force Base. 35 miles south of the launch site.
"Bob and I are about ready to fly this thing; we're look
ing forward to the flight; we hope everything will allow us
to go on Friday," Young, the mission commander told a
group of reporters gathered for their arrival.
Following a long break for repairs, the countdown was
back on schedule and a spokesman said, "Everything is
going smoothly."
All eyes were on the weather, uncomfortably windy ear
ly this week.
"Yesterday things weren't looking so good; today I un
derstand things are looking better," test conductor Bill
Schick said this morning. "They are not ideal weather con
ditions, but they are progressing."
Reagan may go home by tomorrow
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, showing con
tinued improvement with no sign of complications from
his gunshot wound, probably will be ready to return to the
White House as early as tomorrow — and no later than
Monday, a key physician said yesterday.
"He will not be chopping wood next week," but Reagan
should be able to put in a couple hours of work at his desk
each day, said Dr. Dennis O'Leary, dean of clinical affairs
at George Washington University Hospital where Reagan
is recuperating.
The president likely will be recovered 100 percent within
tour months, O'Leary estimated, adding: "He might do a
little better."
NRC to check reactor plumbing
Washington— The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) is checking two "potentially serious" problems of
plumbing and stress that could lead to meltdowns in any of
the nation's operating nuclear power plants and a result
ing disastrous explosion of radioactivity.
One involves pressurized-water reactors, which com
prise about two-thirds of the nation's 74 nuclear plants. It
is possible, according to Harold Denton, NRC's director ot
reactor regulation, that some have brittle walls that could
crack if they received a sudden high-pressure burst of cold

water when they are very hot. A jet of cold water might be
injected during a malfunction or accident, crack the reac
tor vessel, and cause a meltdown.
The other problem involves the 23 boiling-water reac
tors. If there is a break or leak in one of the pipes that carry
water out of the reactor after a sudden shutdown, it would
be hard to stop the leak and prevent all the water from es
caping the reactor, again causing a meltdown.
Scientists have long known that neutron radiation from
the reactor core makes the vessel walls brittle over time,
but recent research has found it occurring faster than ex
pected.
General Omar Bradley dead at 88
Washington — General of the Army Omar Nelson Brad
ley died yesterday in a New York City hospital. He was 88.
His death, which was attributed to a heart attack, truly
brought an end to an era. He was the last ot the Army's
tive-star generals and the last of America's great warriors
ot World War 11.
Bradley had another distinction: counting his tour years
at West Point, he was on active Army duty longer than any
man in U.S. history — 69 years and eight months as of April
1.
Bradley emerged from World War II widely acclaimed
as one of that conflict's most brilliant generals. Yet more
frequently than not he was overshadowed in the public's
eye by his more colorful and dramatic colleagues —
Dwight Eisenhower, Douglas Mac Arthur, George Patton
and British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.
Giant pandas meet for first time
Washington — It wasn't exactly love at first sight.
Ling-Ling, the giant panda still awaiting motherhood,
played hard to get, while Chia-Chia, her imported lover,
gaped and growled at his intended.
It was, after all, only the first meeting of the two giant
pandas, brought together in hopes that they will find each
other compatible enough to have a baby.
Amid the flowering pear trees and cherry blossoms,
Chia-Chia got a first glimpse of his new girlfriend Tues
day, keeping one eye on the gate that separated them —
and one paw on his bamboo.
Ling-Ling tended her own garden, nibbling dandelions
and flirting occasionally.
For eight years, officials at the National Zoo have hoped
that Ling-Ling would become pregnant. But season after
season, her partner Hsing-Hsing didn't do what was ex
pected ot him. After a failed attempt at artificial in
semination last spring, Hsing-Hsing was embarrassed
once again: panda specialists determined he had a low
sperm count.
So last month, zoo officials imported Chia-Chia, an 8-
year-old, 245-pound male, from London. He took up resi
dence in the half-million-dollar panda palace where Ling-
Ling and Hsing-Hsing had been living since former Presi
dent Richard Nixon brought them from China in 1972.
Stocks inch forward for small gain
New York — American Telephone & Telegraph shares
held the spotlight as the stock market eked out a small gain

fallen more than 14 points in the two previous sessions,

managed a 54 gain to 993.43.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow with patchy low clouds nights
and mornings. Lows in the 40s. Highs in the upper 50s to
