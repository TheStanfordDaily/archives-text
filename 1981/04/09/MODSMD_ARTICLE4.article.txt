Intellectual life in University residences will be under
examination by the newly established faculty subcommit
tee on residential education and advising.
Assoc. History Prof. Kennell Jackson, chairman of the
subcommittee, said, "We're looking at those aspects of
the residences that fall under the category of education."
According to Assoc. History Prof. Carolyn Lougee,
chairman of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies < C
US), the new subcommittee was formed because of facul
ty concern that residential education had not received a
systematic examination for 10 years.
In redoing the structure of C-US this year, Lougee said,
the former committee on entering students was disbanded
and replaced with the one on residential education and ad
vising.
The charge of the new subcommittee is three-fold, ac
cording to member Stephen Ferrulo, assistant professor
of history. It will examine orientation of entering under
graduates to academic life at Stanaford. advising, and res
idential education.

Ferruolo said the time is ripe tor such a study, especial
ly in light of President Donald Kennedy 's expressed desire
to increase the University's emphasis on residential
education.
The committee has only held one meeting, but Jackson
said far-reaching proposals of the subcommittee may in
clude classes, seminars and themes in different resi
dences. This could be an expansion of the dorm-based sec
tion already set up for History 1-2-3.
"At this point we're trying to assess the views of the
community and find out what's going on in residences that
people would call intellectual life," Feruolo said.
To begin, the subcommittee is sending questionaires to
resident fellows and house associates (RAs). Jackson said
it is also interested in student input. "We want as open a
process as we can so I encourage people with ideas to con
tact me or members of the subcommittee. "
Jackson said the subcommittee anticipates a one-year
study and then will present its report to the Faculty Sen
ate.
