# Computer keeps track of student grades
## 
### Jan Mireles 
They know your grade in Econ 1.
They know about all of your in
completes. And they know when to al
low you to graduate.
The office of the Registrar at Stan
ford, under the direction of Sally
Mahoney, knows all of this and more.
Keeping track of courses students
have taken, how many units they've
acquired, and perhaps more im
portantly, what courses they've
passed, are just a tew of the responsi

bilities of the Registrar's office and its
divisions.
All primary documents (since 1891)
go into the computer," said Mahoney,
"We microfilm routinely. It is the ob
ligation of an institution to keep its
records in perpetuity."
Computers play an important role
in maintaining records and the com
puter record is used as a "resource."
according to Mahoney. The Recorder
of the University, a division within the
Registrar's Office, uses the computer
to maintain records of study lists,
grades and certification of such rec
ords as transcripts.
"We receive over 35,000 requests
for transcripts each year," said
Mahoney, "25,000 of those requests
fall between December 15 and Febru
ary 15," she said. This is when the ma
jority of students apply to graduate
schools and for jobs.
The Recorder also certifies regis
tration status for students applying
tor bank loans and notifies the Bechtel
International Center of foreign stu
dents' status. Bechtel then reports to
the U.S. Immigration Service which in
turn informs those governments aid
ing students that the students are ac
tually enrolled at Stanford.
Though keeping track of students
via study lists, grades and transcripts
is closely related it is not the Regis
trar's "principle responsibility," said
Mahoney.
"Our principle responsibility is to
serve the faculty and schools and stu

dents. We must know the relationship
between faculty, their curriculum and
the persons eligible to enroll," ex
plained Mahoney.
The registrar said they accomplish
this goal through publishing the time
schedule, courses and degrees book,
and by maintaining records of "what
has been offered, what is being offered
and who has been the clientele."
Edna Nigh is manager of the Stu
dent Information Systems which
maintains the computer system re
sponsible for keeping track of what
courses have been offered as well as
files of study lists, grades, and tran
scripts. The Student Information Sys
tems is a managment group set up in
the early 1970s by the provost's office
to be responsible for "the daily care
and feeding of the student data base "
Nigh is the computer coordinator un
der the registrar's office, the largest
user of the data base
The computer is chiefly designed to
store and recall data concerning stu
dents. It is not programmed to update
information directly. For example,
changes in a PTR are first sent
through a key punch operated system
and then entered into the computer via
batch update processes. Batch update
involves transferring information
onto tape and then processing the tape
into the system.
"On-line (direct update into the sys
tem) is faster, but batch is a very ef
fective way to process an awful lot of
data in a short period of time," ex

plained Nigh.
According to Nigh, there are plans
to update the student data base and
possibly acquire an on-line system.
"We currently don't have the
capability to support such a system.
CIT (Center tor Information Technol
ogy-Stanford's main data base) is in
the process now of putting a proposal
before the governing group of the data
base to update the system." said Nigh.
Academic Standing supervisor Nan
cy Osaki relies on the computer for in
formation regarding student status.
The office is responsible for following
students' academic progress, sending
out probation notices, and counseling
students on probation. It also handles
course evaluations and student peti
tions concerning individual academic
standing.
Each quarter a special program is
run through the computer. If a student
has a total of less than 12 academic
units his name is added to a list of oth
er such students. Then Osaki and her
aides begin a manual check of "any
where from 500 to 800 names " The
purpose of the check is to separate the
names into five categories: late
grades, special reduced loads, with
drawals from the University, students
overseas, and students who should be
reviewed for academic probation.
If a student in the last category has
eight units or less he is automatically
placed on probation. If he has nine, 10,
or 11 units, workers pull that student's transcript and add
the total number of units completed in the last three quar
ters. If the total is less than 36, the student is placed on pro
bation.
Though the process is admittedly time consuming,
Osaki says there is no way to eliminate checking late
grades because "students are constantly making up in
completes."
"The system you have really constrains what can be
done, right now this is the best we can do," Osaki said.
"It's still not too bad — only two weeks to get notices out."
she said.
Osaki said there are plans to update the system Univer
sity-wide. She said a new system would allow program
ming to "eliminate some of the manual work," as well as
further aid the Registrar's office and University in serving
the tacultv and students.

Though the process is admittedly time consuming,
Osaki says there is no way to eliminate checking late
grades because "students are constantly making up in
completes."
"The system you have really constrains what can be
done, right now this is the best we can do," Osaki said.
"It's still not too bad — only two weeks to get notices out."
she said.
Osaki said there are plans to update the system Univer
sity-wide. She said a new system would allow program
ming to "eliminate some of the manual work," as well as
further aid the Registrar's office and University in serving
the tacultv and students.
They know your grade in Econ 1.
They know about all of your in
completes. And they know when to al
low you to graduate.
The office of the Registrar at Stan
ford, under the direction of Sally
Mahoney, knows all of this and more.
Keeping track of courses students
have taken, how many units they've
acquired, and perhaps more im
portantly, what courses they've
passed, are just a tew of the responsi

bilities of the Registrar's office and its
divisions.
All primary documents (since 1891)
go into the computer," said Mahoney,
"We microfilm routinely. It is the ob
ligation of an institution to keep its
records in perpetuity."
Computers play an important role
in maintaining records and the com
puter record is used as a "resource."
according to Mahoney. The Recorder
of the University, a division within the
Registrar's Office, uses the computer
to maintain records of study lists,
grades and certification of such rec
ords as transcripts.
"We receive over 35,000 requests
for transcripts each year," said
Mahoney, "25,000 of those requests
fall between December 15 and Febru
ary 15," she said. This is when the ma
jority of students apply to graduate
schools and for jobs.
The Recorder also certifies regis
tration status for students applying
tor bank loans and notifies the Bechtel
International Center of foreign stu
dents' status. Bechtel then reports to
the U.S. Immigration Service which in
turn informs those governments aid
ing students that the students are ac
tually enrolled at Stanford.
Though keeping track of students
via study lists, grades and transcripts
is closely related it is not the Regis
trar's "principle responsibility," said
Mahoney.
"Our principle responsibility is to
serve the faculty and schools and stu

dents. We must know the relationship
between faculty, their curriculum and
the persons eligible to enroll," ex
plained Mahoney.
The registrar said they accomplish
this goal through publishing the time
schedule, courses and degrees book,
and by maintaining records of "what
has been offered, what is being offered
and who has been the clientele."
Edna Nigh is manager of the Stu
dent Information Systems which
maintains the computer system re
sponsible for keeping track of what
courses have been offered as well as
files of study lists, grades, and tran
scripts. The Student Information Sys
tems is a managment group set up in
the early 1970s by the provost's office
to be responsible for "the daily care
and feeding of the student data base "
Nigh is the computer coordinator un
der the registrar's office, the largest
user of the data base
The computer is chiefly designed to
store and recall data concerning stu
dents. It is not programmed to update
information directly. For example,
changes in a PTR are first sent
through a key punch operated system
and then entered into the computer via
batch update processes. Batch update
involves transferring information
onto tape and then processing the tape
into the system.
"On-line (direct update into the sys
tem) is faster, but batch is a very ef
fective way to process an awful lot of
data in a short period of time," ex

plained Nigh.
According to Nigh, there are plans
to update the student data base and
possibly acquire an on-line system.
"We currently don't have the
capability to support such a system.
CIT (Center tor Information Technol
ogy-Stanford's main data base) is in
the process now of putting a proposal
before the governing group of the data
base to update the system." said Nigh.
Academic Standing supervisor Nan
cy Osaki relies on the computer for in
formation regarding student status.
The office is responsible for following
students' academic progress, sending
out probation notices, and counseling
students on probation. It also handles
course evaluations and student peti
tions concerning individual academic
standing.
Each quarter a special program is
run through the computer. If a student
has a total of less than 12 academic
units his name is added to a list of oth
er such students. Then Osaki and her
aides begin a manual check of "any
where from 500 to 800 names " The
purpose of the check is to separate the
names into five categories: late
grades, special reduced loads, with
drawals from the University, students
overseas, and students who should be
reviewed for academic probation.
If a student in the last category has
eight units or less he is automatically
placed on probation. If he has nine, 10,
or 11 units, workers pull that student's transcript and add
the total number of units completed in the last three quar
ters. If the total is less than 36, the student is placed on pro
bation.
