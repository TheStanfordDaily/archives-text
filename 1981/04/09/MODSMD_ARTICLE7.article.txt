## El Salvador's U.S.-backed junta Violence hinders land reform plan 
### Washington Post 
San Salvador — The road map
says there is a village called
Tehuiste Arriba, population 250,
in the hills about 40 miles east of
here.
The map is wrong — Tehuiste
Arriba does not exist. Last sum
mer government troops swept
through and burned down or
simply pushed over nearly all of
the village's 30 or 40 stick-and
mud huts. Most of the residents
fled before the troops arrived.
Less than 2 miles up the road
from Tehuiste Arriba is a large
coffee plantation called San Si
mon. once privately owned and
now a government land-reform
cooperative. It is one of 283 of El
Salvador's larger farms that
have been expropriated by the
government and turned over to
peasants in hopes that a re
distribution of land in the agri
culture-based country will
make them deaf to leftist ap
peals.
Tehuiste Arriba and San Si
mon are two aspects of the rul
ing civilian-military junta's
joint, and sometimes conflict
ing, goals — winning the support
of the peasants who make up 60
percent of El Salvador's popu
lation, while physically
crushing the leftist guerrillas.
For critics
The land reform also is de
signed to prove to domestic and
foreign critics of this govern
ment that, while conservative,
it is committed to improving the
lives of the majority. The pro
gram has received heavy finan
cial, technological and moral
backing from the U.S. govern
ment's Agency for International
Development, and the AFL-
ClO's American Institute for
Free Labor Development.
As planned, the reform would
be the most extensive under
taken in Central America, af
fecting nearly two-thirds of the
rural poor, far more sweeping,
for example, than the program
outlined by the leftist Sandinista
government in nearby
Nicaragua.
But there are increasing in
dications that the politically ex
plosive program, one year after
it was launched in the midst of
brutal political violence, is
faltering, plagued by violence,
administrative delays and an in
creasing scarcity ot agricultur
al credit in a country suffering
from a flight of private capital
that officials estimate at more
than $1 billion in the last year.

The program was to take
place in three phases. The first,
already accomplished, was the
takeover by the government of
all farms larger than 1235 acres.
Those have been turned into
peasant-run cooperatives.
The second phase would take
over and distribute all farms
larger than 247 acres. The third
and perhaps most controversial
phase would take control of all
lands not worked by the owners
and give sharecroppers and ten
ants the titles to those proper
ties, up to 17 acres per family.
Government officials have an
nounced that the second phase
has been indefinitely postponed.
One Western diplomat put it
more bluntly. "Phase two is
dead," he said, for economic as
well as political reasons.
Production drop
The faltering economy sim
ply cannot sustain the drop in
agricultural production that
would result from changing the
production process.
In contrast, phase two would
take land away from about 1800
current owners, including many
government and military of
ficials.
Phase three, which would af
fect the greatest number of
peasants, is also stumbling. A
year ago the government an
nounced Decree 207, the "land
to-the-tiller" law, under which
former tenants on small sub
sistence plots would own the
lands they worked.
But a year later fewer than
"provisional" titles have been
handed out. Publicly, govern
ment officiate concede that the
third phase may take years to
carry out.
Pha§e three also carries the
greatest potential tor violence
by current landowners trying to
drive the peasant renters from
their land before the new
owners could prove they had a
right to it.
AFL-CIO killings
In a fiery televised address
just before he and two AFL-CIO
advisers were gunned down in a
hotel restaurant in January,
Rodolfo Viera, head of the land
reform institute, decried the
number of peasants killed "with
the 207 decree in their hands."
Despite the partial paralysis,
U.S. officials proclaim land re
torm a success, pointing out
that the large farms are no long
er in the hands ot the oligarchy,
and that production is adequate.
Foreign analysts also say the

program has demonstrated, to
the surprise ot both interna
tional observers and skeptical
moderates within the country,
that the government was seri
ous about reform.
But discussions last week
with dozens of those who are to
be the most affected, the
peasants themselves, indicate
that the junta's experiment so
far has provided little economic
benefit to them, and few if any
converts in the battle to win po
litical support.
Protection tax
And a new expense has come
with the reform. Peasant lead
ers and AFL-CIO reports say
that many cooperatives are now
forced to pay a protection tax to
the armed local-government
militia. San Simon, for exam
ple, now pays nearly $1000 a

month tor protection, according
to the AFL-CIO.
More than 50 government
land-reform and other officials,
along with more than 500
peasant leaders, have been
killed since the program started
last year.
More than anything, it is still
the violence that is undermining
any government effort to win
political support through the
land-reform program.
In a pattern repeated again
and again, a resident who was
not on the board of directors lat
er approached a group of vis
itors as they were leaving and
whispered that he and everyone
else knew that the killings were
almost all the work of govern
ment security forces.

Victims of violence
Residents of Apopa, a small town about 10 miles north of El Salvador's capital city of San Salvador,
walk through the remains of a burned municipal building last week. Reports say that leftist guerrillas
attacked the town and burned the village.
