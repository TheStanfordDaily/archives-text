### 
San Salvador, El Salvador (AP) — El
Salvador's Defense Ministry claims the massacre
of 30 civilians in a San Salvador slum was pro
voked by firing on an army patrol. Witnesses say
the victims were dragged from their homes and if
they resisted were shot in front of their families.
Reporters visiting the Monte Carmelos slum
district after the pre-dawn shooting Tuesday
counted 23 bodies, scattered for 100 yards along a
street. Residents of the area said seven people
were killed in their homes.
The corpses in the street were riddled with
large-caliber bullet wounds in the head and chest.
Blood had collected in small pools. Two houses
were burned by fires, apparently started when
they were hit by bazooka rounds.
"It was the national guard and the police."
shouted several residents.
Pre-dawn raid
A young boy said men in uniform and civilian
clothes drove into Monte Carmelos in the
darkness Tuesday. He said a masked man ap
peared and began pointing out homes, presumably
those of leftists opposed to the civilian-military
junta headed by President Jose Napoleon Duarte
and backed by the United States.
Uniformed men knocked at the front door of
each home, entered and after a few seconds
dragged one or two victims outside, the boy said.
"I could hear the screams of someone asking a
neighbor to turn on the outside lights, but no one

did." he said.
A Defense Ministry spokesman denied the kill
ing was premeditated.
"One must have a sick mind to plan something
like that," he said.
The spokesman claimed government forces on
patrol were fired on and returned the fire. He said
four soldiers were killed in the exchange but
would not provide the names of the casualties.
Neighbors of the dead said they watched the
killing from their windows.
Genocide
Commenting today on the mass slaying, the So
viet news agency Tass said: "The bloody
Salvadoran junta follows a policy of genocide as
regards its own people, actively using methods of
mass murder of civilians used by the American
military in Vietnam."
The El Salvador Human Rights Commission es
timates that more than 18,000 people have been
killed in El Salvador in political violence since ul
tra-rightist President Carlos Humberto Romero
was overthrown by more liberal officers on Oct.
15, 1979.
The U.S. government, believing the junta is the
best hope tor a stable democracy, has sent 54 U.S.
military advisers and $35 million worth of arms
and military equipment for the national guard.
The Reagan administration claims the guerrillas
are getting aid from communist countries.
