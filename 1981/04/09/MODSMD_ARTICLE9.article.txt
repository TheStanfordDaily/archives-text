# ‘Separate but complementary'
## Policy puzzles Israel 
### 
Jerusalem (AP) — Secretary of State Alexander Haig has left Is
raeli officials puzzled and skeptical about the Reagan adminis
tration's notion of strategic cooperation between Israel and the Ar
abs to counter Soviet moves in the Middle East.
The plan, as outlined by Haig, apparently would give separate but
complementary tasks to Israel and pro-Western Arab states. He
stressed in his visit Sunday and Monday that Israel and the Arabs
must subdue their rivalries and concentrate on the common threat
of "Soviet imperialism."
Haig's warnings of Soviet encroachment were applauded in Jeru
salem.
"It's stuff we've been saying for years," said one official. "The
Carter administration refused to believe it despite all the evi
dence."
But Israeli officials indicate in private conversation that they be
lieve Haig does not realize the depth of the hostility between Israel
and such Arab foes as Jordan and Saudi Arabia, with whom it is still
officially at war.
Even the peace between Egypt and Israel is untested by time.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and President Anwar Sadat dis
cussed regional problems at three summits, but they admitted it
was too soon to cooperate on regional strategy.
Israeli sources said Haig put no concrete proposals on the table
and spoke in general terms. But the sources said he made clear that
the first stage is to "strengthen America's friends," and for that
reason he rejected Israeli appeals to kill U.S. plans to sell Saudi
Arabia sophisticated arms that could be used against Israel.
The problem with that, said former foreign minister Abba Eban,
is that' 'your friends are our enemies
The respected newspaper Haaretz said it was hard for Israel "to
get excited about a policy whose result is the arming of Saudi Ara
bia with a vast amount of weapons and modern aircraft, while it
strongly opposes the peace between Israel and Egypt and even em
phasizes the slogan of jihad (holy war) against us."
Of particular concern to Israel is the proposed sale of AWACS —
Airborne Warning and Control System — planes to the Saudis. The
Americans say the Saudis will use the spy planes to monitor Soviet
inspired activity in South Yemen, the Persian Gulf and the Horn of
Africa.
