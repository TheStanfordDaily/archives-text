# Schultz speaks on economic issues of' 80s
## 
### Debbie Walker 
Former Secretary of the Treasury
and Secretary of Labor George
Schultz defined three great economic
issues of the 1980s in a Kresge
Auditorium speech yesterday after
noon — progress in developing coun
tries, free trade, and a positive and de
pendable role for the United States in
the international economic order
Schultz, president of Bechtel Corpo
ration and a Business School professor
here, also said that democracy has tri
umphed over communism in both eco
nomic and human terms.
"Why then does it (communism)
continue to exist?" Schultz asked.
"To a large extent, the answer lies
in the military sphere. The Russians
have constructed a military machine
of amazing proportions.
"For example, it is military power
alone that keeps Eastern Europe in
the Soviet camp," Schultz said.
Developing nations
Schultz said the United States has
an obligation to see that the option of
freedom is provided for developing na
tions.
"We must recognize the legitimate
national interests of the developing
world and show that ways can be found
to serve the great goals of equity and
efficiency," Schultz said.

As to the future of the free market in
the international system, Schultz said
that the increasing interdependency
and dispersion of economic forces is
exerting a great deal of pressure on
the existing system.
"We must try to understand these
new pressures and grapple with them
so free trade can continue to exist,"
Schultz said.
He pointed to the auto import dilem
ma as an example of a changing sys
tem challenging free trade.
"I think it is to (President Ronald)
Reagan's credit that he rejected the
idea of imposing import quotas or ask
ing the Japanese to voluntarily impose
quotas," Schultz said.
"We must sell our own cars because
people think they're better," he
added.
Schultz went on to praise Reagan's
decision to lift restrictions previously
imposed on the auto industry, main
taining that the government should
not hinder the industry from compet
ing in the marketplace.
In more general terms, Schultz said
that the struggle to find universal, ac
ceptable rules of trade continues, and
that when these rules are defined, the
United States must be willing to live
by them if the rules are to have mean
ing.

The United State's role in world af
fairs will best be served by achieving
non-inflationary growth, according to
Schultz.
"Foreign economic policy begins at
home," Schultz said.
"The nature and strength of our eco
nomic posture is linked to the per
formance of the United States on the
whole," he added.
One of the nation's major tasks is to
rid itself of its dependency on foreign
oil and to cultivate coal and nuclear

power, Schultz said.
"Reductions in oil imports will
make us less vulnerable and subse
quently aid our allies as well. It will
also have a positive effect on the world
oil market," Schultz said.
Schultz ended his speech by defining
a foundation for all future policies.
"Each action must be based on our
essential interest in the expansion of
the possibilities for human freedom
and prosperity."
