# Gangs ready to rumble as 'West Side Story' gets rolling
## Cast and crew pulling together 
### Karen Springen 
A group here on campus is dedicated to creating
a hostile, negative environment, characterized by
gangs and violence. Who are these people? And
why would they want to experience an oppressive
way of life?
They are the cast, crew and staff of Ram's
Head's spring production, West Side Story, which
will run April 16 to 18 and April 23 to 25 in Memori
al Auditorium.
According to producer Jane Wollenberg, the
show describes people living in an environment
they cannot escape. "There are no villains in the
show," she emphasized. "From day to day it's a
fight for survival and that's why they join the
gangs."
She added that the show reflects director Steve
Ullman's wish to show the prejudice arising from
a hostile environment. She compared the struggle
to the absolute helplessness of being stuck in
quicksand. Fighting back merely worsens the cy
cle of oppression.
Gang members kill their best friends when
"what they really need is understanding and
education," said Wollenberg. Pain is dulled.
"They've had it so long that they're used to it."
Preparation
The cast has been to Puerto Rican bars and to
"bad" neighborhoods in San Francisco to try and
understand the "hostility of the external world"
from the inside looking out, said Wollenberg.
"They've tried to study what it felt like," she said.
The Sharks, for example, had to go salsa danc
ing. The staff also brought in films about life in the
barrio.
Setting
The show is basically set to represent any time
or place. Some of the 1950s expressions which
dated the story were eliminated from the script.
Audiences should not expect stereotypical Jets
in T-shirts with cigarettes rolled up in their
sleeves. Jets will wear black and white costumes
to emphasize their jazzy movements, and Sharks
will don green and purple to enhance their sensual
actions.
Wollenberg described the costumes both as
"kind of suggested period" and as "somewhat
New Wave."
The show is contemporary but will always re

main a reflection of Shakespeare's classic play.
Wollenberg described the show as "Romeo and
Juliet set to a brilliant score and brilliant music."
The famous prologue to Romeo and Juliet em
phasizes the need for pride, dignity, family and a
space in this world. Jets and Sharks suffer from a
handicap. "They never had the love that every
child ought to get," said Wollenberg. "The whole
thing seems to be some misguided fate."
Cast, crew, staff
Staff, crew and cast are highly experienced in
general. Light designer senior Peter Maradudin,
for example, has done the lights for Superstar,
I'ippin, and many others. Junior Kevin Reidy
(Gladhand) directed Gaieties this year. Todd
Harris (Baby John) directed Superstar.
The list goes on to include Susie Cashion
(choreographer), Vince Foecke (technical direc
tor), Jerry Robinson (sound designer), Julienne
Weston (costume designer and assistant choreo
grapher), Alan Crystal (Action), Gwen Eagleton
(Maria), Gayle McGinnis (Francisca), T. Bag
Bigelow (Krupke), and Arnold Aguilar (Chino).
Wollenberg said the cast was not selected on
physical appearance. "Ethnically they're di
verse," she said. "One of our goals was to involve
the whole campus."
Rehearsals
Rehearsals started the week after auditions,
the first week of winter quarter. Dancers prac
ticed every Tuesday and Thursday. Rehearsals
have been seven days a week this quarter from at
least 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. Members also rehearsed
during spring break, and these rehearsals some
times lasted 10 hours a day.
Total rehearsal time has been well over 100
hours. Jet dancer, senior Jennifer Kahu said,
"They don't take it into consideration that you're
a student."
About 150 people are involved in the show. The
crew consists of about 40, the staff of 26, the or
chestra of 37, and the cast of 53 (including the off
stage chorus).
In addition to rehearsals, cast and crew went to
the beach together last Saturday. "The cast is
having a good time which is definitely unusual
(for a show at this stage of production)," said
Wollenberg.

the whole campus."
Rehearsals
Rehearsals started the week after auditions,
the first week of winter quarter. Dancers prac
ticed every Tuesday and Thursday. Rehearsals
have been seven days a week this quarter from at
least 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. Members also rehearsed
during spring break, and these rehearsals some
times lasted 10 hours a day.
Total rehearsal time has been well over 100
hours. Jet dancer, senior Jennifer Kahu said,
"They don't take it into consideration that you're
a student."
About 150 people are involved in the show. The
crew consists of about 40, the staff of 26, the or
chestra of 37, and the cast of 53 (including the off
stage chorus).
In addition to rehearsals, cast and crew went to
the beach together last Saturday. "The cast is
having a good time which is definitely unusual
(for a show at this stage of production)," said
Wollenberg.


Ram's Head's spring production, "West Side Story," will run April 16 to 18 and April 23 to 25 in Memori
al Auditorium. In general, the cast, staff and crew are highly experienced. Junior Keven Reidy (Glad
hand) directed "Gaieties" this year, and Todd Harris (Baby John) directed "Superstar." Light de
signer, senior Peter Maradudin, has done the lights for "Superstar," "Pippin," and many other pro
ductions.

A group here on campus is dedicated to creating
a hostile, negative environment, characterized by
gangs and violence. Who are these people? And
why would they want to experience an oppressive
way of life?
They are the cast, crew and staff of Ram's
Head's spring production, West Side Story, which
will run April 16 to 18 and April 23 to 25 in Memori
al Auditorium.
According to producer Jane Wollenberg, the
show describes people living in an environment
they cannot escape. "There are no villains in the
show," she emphasized. "From day to day it's a
fight for survival and that's why they join the
gangs."
She added that the show reflects director Steve
Ullman's wish to show the prejudice arising from
a hostile environment. She compared the struggle
to the absolute helplessness of being stuck in
quicksand. Fighting back merely worsens the cy
cle of oppression.
Gang members kill their best friends when
"what they really need is understanding and
education," said Wollenberg. Pain is dulled.
"They've had it so long that they're used to it."
Preparation
The cast has been to Puerto Rican bars and to
"bad" neighborhoods in San Francisco to try and
understand the "hostility of the external world"
from the inside looking out, said Wollenberg.
"They've tried to study what it felt like," she said.
The Sharks, for example, had to go salsa danc
ing. The staff also brought in films about life in the
barrio.
Setting
The show is basically set to represent any time
or place. Some of the 1950s expressions which
dated the story were eliminated from the script.
Audiences should not expect stereotypical Jets
in T-shirts with cigarettes rolled up in their
sleeves. Jets will wear black and white costumes
to emphasize their jazzy movements, and Sharks
will don green and purple to enhance their sensual
actions.
Wollenberg described the costumes both as
"kind of suggested period" and as "somewhat
New Wave."
The show is contemporary but will always re

main a reflection of Shakespeare's classic play.
Wollenberg described the show as "Romeo and
Juliet set to a brilliant score and brilliant music."
The famous prologue to Romeo and Juliet em
phasizes the need for pride, dignity, family and a
space in this world. Jets and Sharks suffer from a
handicap. "They never had the love that every
child ought to get," said Wollenberg. "The whole
thing seems to be some misguided fate."
Cast, crew, staff
Staff, crew and cast are highly experienced in
general. Light designer senior Peter Maradudin,
for example, has done the lights for Superstar,
I'ippin, and many others. Junior Kevin Reidy
(Gladhand) directed Gaieties this year. Todd
Harris (Baby John) directed Superstar.
The list goes on to include Susie Cashion
(choreographer), Vince Foecke (technical direc
tor), Jerry Robinson (sound designer), Julienne
Weston (costume designer and assistant choreo
grapher), Alan Crystal (Action), Gwen Eagleton
(Maria), Gayle McGinnis (Francisca), T. Bag
Bigelow (Krupke), and Arnold Aguilar (Chino).
Wollenberg said the cast was not selected on
physical appearance. "Ethnically they're di
verse," she said. "One of our goals was to involve
the whole campus."
