# Unique publicity

With the exception of Herant
Katchadourian's Human Sex
uality class, not many events
have filled Memorial
Auditorium without publicity.
But West Side Story l is attempt
ing a first — filling it for six
nights. If Mem Aud had capaci
ty audiences each night, about
10,000 people would see the
show.
Even hoping for this kind of
unprecedented attendance
takes a monumental publicity
effort — and publicity workers
have been active since last
spring.
Ram's Head productions,
such as Pippin last spring, gen
erally run four nights. But West
Side Story is running for six to
grasp a wide audience. The two
extra days appear to be neces
sary. According to producer
Wollenberg, pre-season ticket
sales are much greater than
traditionally.
The show has already sold
more than half of the available
seats. "Normal ticket sales are
about 20 percent at this time,"
said Wollenberg. She estimated
that about 35 percent of the
tickets are bought in blocks, by
dorms and other groups.
Publicity featured the show's
teaser poster. Wollenberg cited
it as one of the reasons for high
pre-sales. She said not everyone

initially understood the brick
wall poster, but that people
gave "positive feedback." The
buttons were the first time the
brick wall was associated with
West Side Story.
Other publicity efforts have
included a banner across Santa
Cruz Avenue, press releases,
4000 runners (which cost only
$40), buttons and helium
balloons. Both the balloons and
buttons are unusual publicity
measures.
"The more often you bom
bard somebody with something,
the better it is," said Wollen
berg. The show limited public
ity costs by using less expensive
paper than usual and planning
ahead.
As an end result of publicity
efforts, the show will earn mon
ey. Wollenberg described this as
"rare" in recent years here.
Costs are large — the rights to
the show alone are $400 a night.
This is in addition to costs for
renting scripts.
Tickets are available at all
BASS outlets and at the Tres
idder ticket office. They are
$3.50 for students and senior
citizens and $5.50 for general ad
mission.
Other upcoming shows on
campus include Equus and A
Little Nite Music, both to be
produced by The Company in
late May.
