# Spectrum of music

"It's without a doubt the most
difficult show to produce," said
music director senior Mark
Swanson. The music alone cer
tainly proves his point.
The score, written by
Leonard Bernstein, covers a
wide spectrum of styles. Jazz,
'50s rock, Latin American-in
fluenced songs, and even opera
run throughout the show.
"It's not just one type of
style," emphasized Swanson.
"It's got all these different
kinds of music in it."
Playing the music requires
more than mere technique, he
added. "You have to have a lot
of jazz feeling," said Swanson.
He emphasized the problems
the percussion faces. "Most of
the rhythms are very, very dif
ficult," he said.
The score was written about
25 years ago. "But it's still
almost contemporary," said
Swanson. "People who know the
show can't believe that it was
written that long ago."
The score reflects the overall
tragic theme of the show. Even
the light-hearted songs, such as
"Officer Krupke," relate to the
tragic, said Swanson. If the
"light" songs were not in
cluded, he added, the show
would be "too overbearing."
The orchestra has 37 mem
bers, which is the usual pit size
for West Side Story. Ram's

Head productions normally
have about 30 musicians.
Another difference between
West Side Story and past shows
is that there were auditions for
the orchestra. Wollenberg said,
"This is the first orchestra that
ever had auditions." She added,
"Usually you have to beg people
to get into your pit!"
The orchestra is not alone in
facing musical difficulties.
"It's difficult chorally in that it
has so many parts," said
Swanson. The male lead is a
tenor and the female lead is a
mezzo-soprano, he added.
Ram's Head has made min
imal changes in the score. "It's
pretty foolish to tamper with
something as great as West
Side Story," said Swanson. He
arranged the entreact, how
ever.
Swanson, like the other mem
bers of the staff, has had a wide
range of experience. He
directed Gaieties last year and
was assistant director of Kiss
Me Kate.
"It's really important to go
through the process of being as
sistant director," said Swanson.
'' People look up to you for direc
tion constantly. It's you who've
got to provide."
He emphasized the role of
cast and orchestra input. "If
they (musicians and singers)
are not sure about the direc
tions, then we'll axe it,"he said.
