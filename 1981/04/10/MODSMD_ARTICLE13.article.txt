# "Rumble?"
## 
### Karen Springen 
If you see fighting at noon
in White Plaza today, don't
be alarmed. The Daily has
just received a tip-off that
the Sharks and the Jets are
planning a rumble.
But why would they want
the fight "scene"? Maybe
they want us to see their side
of the story.
Another rumor is circulat
ing that three other scenes
may take place as well —
maybe Officer Krupke, Jet
song, and America.
And again, the Daily has
not yet discovered their
motives, but the gangs may
give out balloons and roses to
supporters.
So go to see what the "Big
Deal" is about. Who knows,
the "Action" may deserve a
"Tony!"
