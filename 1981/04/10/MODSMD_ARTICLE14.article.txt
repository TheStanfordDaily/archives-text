## Editorial Assessment endorsements 
### 
On Wednesday and Thursday of next
: week, students will vote on 16 fee
|{ assessment requests.
r Students should examine the
assessments carefully. Twenty percent of
* registered students must vote to certify an
- election and approve an assessment.
Yesterday we published our recommen
" dations for several assessments. Our final
set of recommendations will appear on
Monday.
- Individuals who wish to comment on the
assessments should submit typed opinions
by 2 p.m. Sunday.
Graduate Student Association
- Yes
The Graduate Student Association
(GSA) is an umbrella organization serv
ing graduate students in various depart
ments. Grads comprise 48.5 percent of the
student population, yet for a variety of
reasons do not benefit from many of the
social programs and academic services
available to undergraduates.
The one-quarter fee assessment re
quested by the GSA (and granted last
year) enables the GSA to bring grads from
their various specialized fields into con
tact with other grads. Lacking other fund
ing, the GSA needs a " Yes " vote to enable
it to continue its current programs and to
up other avenues (a newsletter is
proposed) to improve the quality of gradu
ate life at the University.
Chaparral — Yes
Stanford's humor magazine, the
Chaparral, is a notable exception to the
rule of floundering and irregularly pub
lishing magazines on the Stanford cam
pus. The Chaparral has achieved success
in maintaining regular quarterly publica
tions, while providing such services as the
Reg Pack and the Chaparral film series.
""In addition, the magazine offers its pro
'".duction facilities for the use of other stu
dent publications.
While the Chaparral soon plans to
achieve financial independence, present
r high costs of printing and limited advertis
ing mean that the magazine must publish
'-..at a deficit if it is to continue its present
■k service. Hence, the need for a fee
assessment, as the Chaparral does not re
ceive Publications Board money.
The Chaparral has recently achieved
acclaim in Newsweek as one ot the na
tion's leading college humor magazines.
-- This, and the fact that the Chaparral pro
vides a variety of useful services to the
Stanford community provide strong rea

sons for support of its one-quarter fee
assessment.
KZSU - Yes
The student radio station will rely this
year, as it has in the past, almost entirely
on income from student fees. Because of
FCC regulations, the station cannot ac
cept advertising. Underwriting of pro
grams by private businesses, although
permitted, has been exceedingly difficult
for the station to get. Thus, the requested
four-quarter fee assessment is estimated
to provide at least 80 percent of the sta
tion's income.
The station offers excellent program
ming combining a variety of music with
strong news and sports coverage. Without
student fees, KZSU would be forced to
close down. This would be a major loss to
the Stanford community. The Daily
strongly urges a "yes" vote on the KZSU
fee assessment.
Legal Counseling Office —
Yes
Through the Legal Counseling Office
(LCO), Stanford students are able to re
ceive legal advice on a variety of matters,
from rent disputes to parking tickets to
prosecution for possession of drugs. Legal
disputes are both complex and expensive
for the average student; the LCO provides
and invaluable service to all students.
The fee assessment is the major source
of funding for this program, and as stu
dents who already have their own legal ad
visers can easily take back their dollar
assessment, the Daily urges students to
support LCO assessment
Publications Board — Yes
The Publications Board provides funds
to wide variety of student groups for pub
lishing magazines or newsletters. These
groups are often unable to compete for lo
cal advertisers against the larger, and
more established publications like the
Daily, The Chaparral, and The Quad.
Admittedly, the students who benefit
the most from this fee assessment are
those who work on the publications, but
the funding the Publications Board pro
vides to these smaller groups eventually
affects the whole University. The smaller
publications present students with the op
portunity to examine and debate other
viewpoints. Without this free discussion,
the intellectual atmosphere of the Univer
sity would undoubtably suffer. The Daily
urges a yes vote on the Publications
Board.
