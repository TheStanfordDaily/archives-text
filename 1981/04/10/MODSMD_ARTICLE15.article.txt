## A 						day in the life of Mr. Stockman 
### 
It is an early morning in
Washington D C. A trim young
; tnan by the name of David
• Stockman is strolling down the
* -street. He stops in front of Rea
gan's Meat Shop, pulls a key out
of his pocket and opens the door.
He enters the shop, turns on the
lights and goes to the back
room. There he puts on his
butcher's smock and checks un
der tables, under chairs, and in
the freezer for Communists and
bureaucrats (not necessarily in

that order). Then he walks out
front and wait behind the coun
ter.
His first customer enters thp
store and walks up to the coun
ter.
"Good morning," says Stock
man. "What may I do for you?"
"I'd like to get four sirloin
steaks."
"Wonderful — we're having a
'10 percent off' sale on sirloins
today. Let me get you some."
With that, Mr. Stockman goes

back to the meat locker and
comes back with four pounds of
hamburger, which he weighs
and begins to wrap it up.
"Excuse me, Mr. Stockman,
but that's hamburger and I
asked for sirloin."
"Yes, that's right, Mr. Tax
payer, but it's 10 percent
cheaper than the regular sirloin.
There is no free lunch."
"Well, yes, I suppose you're
right." He picks up the now
wrapped hamburger and turns
to leave. "Put this on my ac
count."
"I'm sorry, I can't do that.
Too many customers were liv
ing beyond their means, spend
ing money they didn't have. I'm
afraid I'll have to be paid in
cash."
"Well, all right." Mr. Tax
payer pays for his hamburger
and leaves, as a second cus
tomer, a well-dressed, but obese
man walks in.
"Good morning, Mr. Busi
ness," says Mr. Stockman
cheerfully.
"Good morning. Mr. Stock
man. I'd like to get ten sirloin
steaks today."
"Wonderful. We're having a
'10 percent off' sale on sirloins
today. " Let me get you some."
He walks back to the freezer and
returns with ten sirloins.
"If I let you have these steaks
at 10 percent off, Mr. Business,
do you promise to tighten you
belt and to share some of these
steaks with your domestic
help?" Mr. Stockman asks as he
weighs and wraps up the steaks.
"Why, of course. Haven't I
always?" He picks up the now
wrapped steaks and turns to
leave. "Put it on my account."
"Why, of course, sir. Have a
nice day."
A third customer, an old ladv
dressed in rags, enters the store
and walks up to the counter.
"Good morning, Mrs. Needv.
What may I do for you today?"
"I'd like two pounds of ham
burgers, please," she replies as
she sets a wad of food stamps on

the counter. Mr Stockman picks
up the food stamps, stuffs them
in his pocket, and goes back to
the meat locker. He comes back
with some hamburger, weighs
it, and begins to wrap it up.
"Excuse me, Mr. Stockman,
but that doesn't look like two
pounds of hamburger."
"That's because it's only one
pound, Mrs. Needy. We all hve
to tighten our belts."
"Well, yes, dearie, I suppose
you're right."
"It comes to $2.00 total, Mrs.
Needy."
"Just take it out of the food
stamps I gave you, please."
"What food stamps?"
"The ones you just put in your
pocket a minute ago."
"I don't have any food stamps
in my pocket — I only deal in
cash."
"I don't have any cash."
"Well, then, I'm sorry, Mrs.
Needy, but I can't sell you any
meat then. Have a nice day." He
takes the hamburger back as
Mrs. Needy frowns and leaves.
The owner of the Meat Shop is
the next to walk in.
"How much have we earned
today, Mr. Stockman?" he asks.
Mr. Stockman opens the cash
register and shows him.
"Hmmm. Not bad. We can
buy a lot of new meat grinders,
butcher knives, and meat
slicers with this," the owner
says as he takes all the money
out of the till.
"Yes sir. Have a nice day."
Mr. Stockman replies. The
owner turns and walks out of the
store. Mr. Stockman goes to the
back room, takes off his
butcher's smock, checks under
the desk for Communists and
bureaucrats one last time, and
walk back to the front of the
store. He turns off the lights,
locks the door, and walks back
to his car. Another day's work
well done, he says to himself as
he gets in his car.

gan's Meat Shop, pulls a key out
of his pocket and opens the door.
He enters the shop, turns on the
lights and goes to the back
room. There he puts on his
butcher's smock and checks un
der tables, under chairs, and in
the freezer for Communists and
bureaucrats (not necessarily in

that order). Then he walks out
front and wait behind the coun
ter.
His first customer enters thp
store and walks up to the coun
ter.
"Good morning," says Stock
man. "What may I do for you?"
"I'd like to get four sirloin
steaks."
"Wonderful — we're having a
'10 percent off' sale on sirloins
today. Let me get you some."
With that, Mr. Stockman goes

back to the meat locker and
comes back with four pounds of
hamburger, which he weighs
and begins to wrap it up.
"Excuse me, Mr. Stockman,
but that's hamburger and I
asked for sirloin."
"Yes, that's right, Mr. Tax
payer, but it's 10 percent
cheaper than the regular sirloin.
There is no free lunch."
"Well, yes, I suppose you're
right." He picks up the now
wrapped hamburger and turns
to leave. "Put this on my ac
count."
"I'm sorry, I can't do that.
Too many customers were liv
ing beyond their means, spend
ing money they didn't have. I'm
afraid I'll have to be paid in
cash."
"Well, all right." Mr. Tax
payer pays for his hamburger
and leaves, as a second cus
tomer, a well-dressed, but obese
man walks in.
"Good morning, Mr. Busi
ness," says Mr. Stockman
cheerfully.
"Good morning. Mr. Stock
man. I'd like to get ten sirloin
steaks today."
"Wonderful. We're having a
'10 percent off' sale on sirloins
today. " Let me get you some."
He walks back to the freezer and
returns with ten sirloins.
"If I let you have these steaks
at 10 percent off, Mr. Business,
do you promise to tighten you
belt and to share some of these
steaks with your domestic
help?" Mr. Stockman asks as he
weighs and wraps up the steaks.
"Why, of course. Haven't I
always?" He picks up the now
wrapped steaks and turns to
leave. "Put it on my account."
"Why, of course, sir. Have a
nice day."
A third customer, an old ladv
dressed in rags, enters the store
and walks up to the counter.
"Good morning, Mrs. Needv.
What may I do for you today?"
"I'd like two pounds of ham
burgers, please," she replies as
she sets a wad of food stamps on

the counter. Mr Stockman picks
up the food stamps, stuffs them
in his pocket, and goes back to
the meat locker. He comes back
with some hamburger, weighs
it, and begins to wrap it up.
"Excuse me, Mr. Stockman,
but that doesn't look like two
pounds of hamburger."
"That's because it's only one
pound, Mrs. Needy. We all hve
to tighten our belts."
"Well, yes, dearie, I suppose
you're right."
"It comes to $2.00 total, Mrs.
Needy."
"Just take it out of the food
stamps I gave you, please."
"What food stamps?"
"The ones you just put in your
pocket a minute ago."
"I don't have any food stamps
in my pocket — I only deal in
cash."
"I don't have any cash."
"Well, then, I'm sorry, Mrs.
Needy, but I can't sell you any
meat then. Have a nice day." He
takes the hamburger back as
Mrs. Needy frowns and leaves.
The owner of the Meat Shop is
the next to walk in.
"How much have we earned
today, Mr. Stockman?" he asks.
Mr. Stockman opens the cash
register and shows him.
"Hmmm. Not bad. We can
buy a lot of new meat grinders,
butcher knives, and meat
slicers with this," the owner
says as he takes all the money
out of the till.
"Yes sir. Have a nice day."
Mr. Stockman replies. The
owner turns and walks out of the
store. Mr. Stockman goes to the
back room, takes off his
butcher's smock, checks under
the desk for Communists and
bureaucrats one last time, and
walk back to the front of the
store. He turns off the lights,
locks the door, and walks back
to his car. Another day's work
well done, he says to himself as
he gets in his car.
