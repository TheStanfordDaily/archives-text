## Tour of Hoover the New Right thing to do 
### 
Never buy a raffle ticket at a
Business School dance because
sometimes you win. Luckily, I
didn't draw the grand prize — a
luncheon date with Milton and
Rose Friedman, 'Free to
Choose' three martinis, tax
free. No, I won the next best
thing — a private tour for two of
the luxurious Hoover Institute
of War, Revolution and Peace.
I never imagined I'd be of
fered the chance to get on in
timate terms with a 285-foot
windowless phallus; but then
it's better than swimming les
sons under the big orange toilet
seat outside Meyer. Or so I
thought.
After great effort, I per
suaded my girlfriend to share
this rare opportunity for an in
side glimpse at the think-tank
running America.
"But I'm not interested in
vacuum cleaner exhibits," she
protested. "I don't even like
Tupperware parties." I finally
persuaded her that Hoover had
not only been President just
before FDR, but also Stanford
student body treasurer in 1894,
even before there was an ASSU.
He's famous. Even the Re
publicans make fun of him. Re
member the ultimate put-down
on Carter — "We no longer call
him "Jimmy Who? We call him
Jimmy Hoover!"
We began our tour in the Hoo
ver International Policy

Analysis Seminar Room. So
phisticated looking equipment
lined the walls. A map of the
world glowed blue, with red
lights flashing "Present Dan
ger" from the Alps to the Bering
Straits.
"This is where we brief
America's leaders on interna
tional affairs," our guide ex
plained. He seemed a friendly
sort, though his riding crop, six
guns and battle fatigues seemed
a bit too informal for an institu
tion recently featured in Wom
en's Wear Daily.
"You guys did quite a job on
Justice Clark. What happened?
Did Haig's evil spirits get into
the tape machine again and
erase his mind?" I jested. The
guide did not appear amused.
"He was a tough one, sure,
but it wasn't our fault. How did
we know that eastern estab
lishment pinko senator would
ask him to name the leaders of
South Africa, Zimbabwe and
Namibia. He wasn't applying to
be a quiz show contestant. Our
Scholars taught him who's be
hind the PLO, the rebels in El
Salvador, low-price Toyotas and
Teddy Kennedy."
Marxist guerillas on Soviet
puppet strings?" my friend
guessed.
"Right! That's easy to re
member, isn't it?"
Next we saw the room where
the Hoover Scholars decide
whether a government is total
itarian or merely authoritarian.
Luckily for us a Scholar was on
hand to explain their methods.
"You can usually tell by the
economic system," he said. "In
totalitarian countries the gov
ernments exploit, torture and
murder their people. In author
itarian countries much of this
work is left to the private sec
tor. Hence, they are more effi
cient. No long lines and no dissi
dents."
"I never thought of it that
way." I pointed to a graph on the
wall which correlated U.S. mul
tinational investment with to
talitarianism.
"Ingenious, isn't it,"the
Scholar smiled. "Do you think
Mobil or ITT have investments

in Cuba or Red China? Of course
not, because these are total
itarian countries. But South
Africa and El Salvador, of
course, are authoritarian coun
tries."
"Yeah, that's funnier than
the Laffer Curve." I was begin
ning to wish I had won the lunch
with Monetary Man.
Into the elevator and down the
shaft, our next stop would be the
very bowels of Hoover itself.
This was what most people
came for, a peek at the Hoover
archives.
"The institution has more
material on the growth and
spread of communism that can
be found anywhere outside Mos
cow," our guide intoned. "It has
more pro- and anti- Mussolini
data than can be found in Italy
and probably the most complete
record on Hitler, Nazi pro
paganda and assorted memo
rabilia anywhere."
As we continued down the cor
rider a door to a darkened
auditorium swung open. A clat
ter of marching boots, clicking
heels and guttural shouts of Sieg
Heil\ poured forth.
"What's going on?" we
asked.
The guide appeared flustered.
"Oh, uh, it's just some of our
Scholars analyzing old Nazi
training films." Wiping the
sweat off his upper lip, he ex
plained further. "We have the
largest collection of propoganda
in the world. Professor Goeb
bels, who holds our G. Gordon
Liddy's chair in Nonviolent So
cial Change is preparing for a
continuing education seminar."
"Where?" I queried, trying to
avoid grinding the popcorn and
jujubes into the carpeting.
"The White House Base
ment."
"Oh," I said, grabbing my
friend's arm. "Maybe we should
go on to the Reagan collection
now." The Hoover archive is the
official repository for all Rea
gan papers.
Down the ramp, we strode
through a set of swinging saloon
doors, which opened by electric
eye.

"I'll turn the exhibit on," the
guide beamed. "Lights, Camer
as, Action!" a friendly old voice
poured forth from the speakers,
while a multi-media presenta
tion illustrated the man and his
career.
"Unemployment insurance is
a prepaid vacation for free
loaders . . . This progressive in
come tax system was spawned
by Karl Marx and declared by
him to be the prime essential of
a Socialist state ... I would
have voted against the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 — a bad piece
of legislation ... I've already
spoken about the anti-nuclear
power people and the fact that
behind the scenes they are being
manipulated by forces sympa
thetic to the Soviet Union . . .
We built it. We paid for it. It's
ours and we're going to keep it."
The guide looked like he was
in seventh heaven, but I pushed
the group down to the 1980 cam
paign exhibit. I asked why the
marquees made no mention of
George Bush.
"The President co-stars with
no man," the guide replied in
dignantly.
"Only Bonzo," my friend
with a glance up at a movie
poster from "Bedtime for
Bonzo," giggled near my ear.
Unfortunately our friend over
heard.
'' Madame, that is not the Vice
President. That is a highly
trained ape."
Our last stop was the Hoover
Press, where the Scholars'
books are all rather reassuring
(and these are honest to God
titled): "Present Danger;"
"Terrorism: Threat, Reality
and Response;" "Soviet
Strategy for Nuclear War;" and
sure to become a classic, "Com
munist Cadre: The Social Back
ground of the American Com
munist Party Elite." I couldn't
resist purchasing the two most
prophetic sounding titles, pub
lished last year: "Will Russia
Survive Until 1984" and
"Pursuit of Simplicity."
