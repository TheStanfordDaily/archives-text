## SRI telepath research unsound 
### 
A recent news item ("SRI Ex
plores the Extrasensory," Dai
ly, Apr. 8), describes research
on parapsychology conducted at
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) by Harold Puthoff, Rus
sell Targ and Edwin May.
This research involves a pair
of subjects, one of whom is sent
to a series of test sites. The oth
er subject remains at SRI, de
scribing his "remote viewing"
impressions to an ex
perimenter. The experimenter
records the receiver's verbal
impressions, producing a tran
script. The receiving subject
may also make a drawing of his
impressions of the test site.
The experiment thus pro
duces a series of photographs of
the target sites, and a series of
transcripts and drawings repre
senting the receiving subject's
"telepathic" impressions. The
two sets of data are presented to
an independent judge, who at
tempts to match the target sites
with the drawings and tran
scripts.
The SRI researchers claim
that these experiments demon
strate that information can be
transmitted between two minds
located at great distances from
each other.
The Dailx article fails to men

tion that some scientists have
raised serious objections re
garding the procedural validity
of this research. David Marks
and Richard Kammann, in Na
ture (August 17, 1978, p. 680)
showed that the judges
were supplied with transcripts,
drawings, and photographs in
their correct (correlated) or
der. Furthermore, "careful ex
amination of the transcripts in
dicated that a large number of
cues were available indicating
the position of a transcript in the
series. "Marks and Kammann
took the original SRI tran
scripts, edited out the ex
traneous cues, randomized the
order of the transcripts and
drawings relative to the order of
the site photographs, and sub
mitted the data to two new
judges. The results: neither
judge could produce matchings
better than pure chance.
In their recent book, The Psy
chology of the Psychic, Marks
and Kammann describe their
own determined attempts to
replicate the SRI findings. They
also mention other researchers
who have obtained null results
in their attempts to verify Targ
and Puthoffs' results.
Most people who have re
viewed this experiment and

have compared the drawings
with the site photographs,
would have to agree with the
statement that "in most cases,
the correlation is obvious."
However, the apparent correla
tion may be due to a simple psy
chological effect.
Everyone is familiar with the
way a child can look at the cloud
and see a parade of animals, or a
friend's face. Similarly, in the
well-known. Ttorschcach test, a
subject looks at a shapeless ink
blot, but he might see a butterf
ly, or a fast car, or a football
player. The human mind's abili
ty to form associations among
different images is nearly un
limited.
Thus, the "correlations" be
tween the site photographs and
the remote-viewing drawings
exist mainly because we are
told they are there, so we expect
to find them.
It is unfortunate that Puthoff,
Targ and May are continuing to
waste time and effort in promot
ing the results of their pro
cedurally invalid and ir
reproducible experiments.
