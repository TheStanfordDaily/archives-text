# Officials watch for spring Medfly increase
## 
### Mike Resnick 
Environmentalists are carefully watching to see
if warm spring weather will cause a dramatic in
crease in the lower Peninsula Mediterranean truit
fly population.
If the Medfly population explodes, Santa Clara
County governments may be forced to continue ef
forts to oppose state moves to kill the flies by aerial
pesticide spraying — an environmentally sensitive
remedy.
Environmentalists fear the spraying of the
pesticide Malathion could be harmful to other living
organisms.
File suit
The county and five county cities, including Palo
Alto, filed a lawsuit Monday, seeking a temporary
restraining order before any aerial spraying may
begin.
Thi local governments have asked for a environ
mental impact study to be done before the state at
tempts to begin aerial spraying.
Soil temperature
According to Ann Smith, executive director of the
Peninsula Conservation Center, the Sierra Club has
been monitoring the soil temperature throughout
the county in an effort to estimate the future Medfly
turnout.
The method used to determine the number of flies
that could proliferate from larval stages was for

mulated for the current Medfly problems and is "not
a hard and fast equation," according to George
Farnham, a local Medfly eradication project of
ficial.
Concern was expressed over the discovery of a
newly-emerged, unmated female fly in Los Altos on
Monday, according to Farnham. The fly was found
on a site that had already been sprayed with
Malathion five times, most recently, early this
week.
Farnham said he thought that flies could emerge
by the end of April or at the beginning of May. But he
stressed that there are "a lot of ifs in there."
Test flights
As a precaution, tests are being run in Bakersfield
with aerial spray from helicopters. According to
Farnham, the test has been planned for some time.
Farnham said that is just a "quick and dirty test"
to see how the spray will affect automobile paint fin
ish. Old car fenders serve as the targets, he added.
In an emergency, Farnham said, "If we need this
weapon, we have to have it tested beforehand We're
hopeful we won't have to use it."
Latest controversy
The aerial spraying controversy is only the latest
in a string of problems caused by the Medflies. The
flies first appeared in the Bay Area last June.
On January 6, some 2000 workers began stripping
trees of their fruit — in which female Medflies de

posit their eggs — as well as spraying the trees with
a pesticide called Baytex.
Unfortunately, problems arose with this ap
proach.
First, Medflies can lay their eggs in plants other
than just trees, including various ornamental shrubs
grown throughout the Bay Area.
A second problem was the pesticide. Baytex
wasn't effective under Santa Clara County soil con
ditions. Therefore, ground spraying, which was sup
posed to destroy the pupae, or pre-adult Medflies,
had to be discontinued.
Despite these problems, ground and tree spraying
is currently continuing with a different pesticide,
Malathion. Also, sterile Medflies are being released
in hopes of reducing the flies' reproductive capaci
ty. The rato of sterile flies to the the wild, fertile
flies is about 100 to one, Farnham said.
Smith said that court action might be taken if
spraying should be initiated in this area.
Smith, however, felt that the Bakersfield test
might make aerial spraying an option that would be
more likely to be used if an emergency situation
arose.
Citing the denial of the Supreme Court in hearing
California's suit regarding the Texas quarantine of
California-grown fruits and vegetables, Smith
added, "Texas would be happy if we started aerial
spraying."
