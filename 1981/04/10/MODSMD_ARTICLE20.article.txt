## UMW chief 'blackens union's eye' 
### Associated Press 
Several coal mine owners
said Wednesday it could be
weeks before bargaining re
sumes with the striking United
Mine Workers union, while
some union officials said a fis
tfight between President Sam
Church and his safety director
had given their organization a
black eye.
Scattered picketing continued
in the coalfields, but there were
no reports of violence. The
union said it was swamped by
requests from miners wanting
to know about food stamps and
benefits.
Church, who has called the
union's 39-member Bargaining
Council to meet with him today
in Washington, mixed it up with
Everett Acord on the street
Tuesday outside the union's
Washington offices. They ap
parently were fighting over a
letter Acord wrote to ranking
union officers complaining

about Church's decision to lay
off union safety officials, includ
ing Acord.
"He called me a no-good, rot
ten SOB and Lord knows what
else," Acord said Wednesday.
Church refused to talk with re
porters.
"I don't believe in this
foolishness. There's always a
way to settle problems without
fighting," said Burdette Crowe,
president of UMW District 31 in
Fairmont, W.Va. "We've got
enough problems and I hate to
see something like this hap
pen."
Acord said he invited the
stocky, 250-pound union presi
dent to step outside after
Church began to "manhandle"
him during an argument over
the layoffs. He said neither he
nor Church showed any bruises
from the brief brawl and that
they shook hands later. But
Acord said he no longer would
support Church "if he goes

ahead with these cuts in the
safety department."
The strike was in its 13th day
Wednesday. The union rank and
file, despite Church's ratifi
cation campaign, rejected a ten
tative contract for its 160,000
members March 31 by a 2-1
margin.
"Psychologically, I think no
matter what came out right
now, it wouldn't be ratified,"
said Herbert Jones, president of
Amherst Coal Co. in Charleston,
W.Va. "The other (defeated)
contract was so expensive and

yet it was defeated so soundly."
"We're just biding our time
. . . I don't think anything's
going to happen immediately,"
said Jones, who during the 1968
and 1971 talks was a negotiator
for the organization represent
ing owners of unionized
coalfields, the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association.
The contract would have pro
vided a 36 percent raise over
three years, but many miners
said they felt it contained pro
visions that would threaten the
union's future.
