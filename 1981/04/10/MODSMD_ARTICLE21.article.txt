# Wore 'shaving cream shirt'
## Singer begins trial 
### 
Cleveland (AP) — Punk rock singer Wendy Williams went
on trial Wednesday on a charge of pandering obscenity, and
prosecutors promptly showed their key evidence — a
videotape of her performing while clad in shaving cream in
stead of a shirt.
The flamboyant 28-year-old singer, who wore a heavy chain
necklace, skin-tight red pants, a black tank top and knee-high
boots to municipal court, interrupted proceedings twice dur
ing opening statements.
She reacted angrily after city prosecutor Nick Tomino told
jurors her performance at Agora nightclub Jan. 21 was "ob
scene," and included "displays and depictions of masturba
tion, nudity and bizarre and extreme violence."
And she corrected her attorney, Patrick D'Angelo, when he
said Williams' group, the Plasmatics, had performed all over
the nation — injecting they had performed all over the world.
Prosecutors showed the 35-minute videotape to the eight
jurors as the main evidence against Williams, who was
charged with the first-degree misdemeanor after the
Plasmatics' Jan. 21 concert. The tape was made by WKYC
TV of Cleveland.
The Plasmatics, described by its promoters as a "concep
tual" group, are known for theatrics like bashing televisions
with sledgehammers and driving cars off docks.
On the tape, Williams was shown performing with the up
per part of her body covered only by shaving cream. It also
showed her gesturing with the microphone in a way the prose
cutor termed obscene.
