# States enacting laws to close 'head shops'
## 
### 
Cleveland (AP) — Law
makers throughout the nation
are trying to fight drug abuse by
passing laws against the sale of
cigarette papers, waterpipes
and other drug paraphernalia,
but court rulings threaten to
send the laws up in smoke.
Fourteen states and hundreds
of communities have adopted
laws banning the sale of drug
paraphernalia on the ground
that the " head shops' 'where the
pipes and papers are sold glam
orize and encourage drug abuse,
according to the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration.
And the trend shows no signs
of slowing.
The Oklahoma Legislature
has passed a "head shop" bill
that may go to Gov. George
Nigh today.
The Texas House Criminal
Jurisprudence Committee — re
ferred to in news accounts as the
War on Drugs committee — this
month recommended a bill that
would punish both buyers and
sellers of drug-related items.
"The whole intent of the bill is
to shut down the head shops,"
said state Rep. Terral Smith of
Austin. The paraphernalia in
dustry is worth an estimated
$500 million to $3 billion a year.
The Drug Enforcement Ad
ministration has helped law
makers by providing a model
for a law against drug-related
paraphernalia.
Some judges, in overturning

"head shop" laws, have said
these items can have legitimate
uses and that the laws give po
lice too much power in deciding
whether the items are intended
for use with illegal drugs.
Rolling papers for marijuana
"joints," for example, can also
be used for tobacco cigarettes.
A paper clip can be used to hold
the end of a burning marijuana
cigarette.
The issue of whether the sale
of drug paraphernalia can be
banned appears headed for the
U.S. Supreme Court, possibly
from the Cleveland suburb of
Parma.
