Washington (AP) â€” President Ronald
Reagan, free from an evening fever for the
first time in five days, experienced his
"best day yet" in the hospital yesterday, his
doctor said.
Reagan, who has been working about two
hours a day, is under doctors' orders to work
no more than that when he returns to the
White House.
His return now is expected between today
and Monday.
The White House press office, which has
cut its formal bulletins on the president's
health to one a day, said this morning the
president "had no fever last night when he
went to bed or this morning" after he awoke
about 6 a.m.
Deputy White House press secretary

Larry Speakes said Reagan's visitors today
would include the minority leaders of the
Senate and House, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-
W.Va.) and Rep. Robert Michel (R-Ill.) as
well as Treasury Secretary Donald Regan.
The president spent 20 minutes with his
three top aides yesterday morning, twice as
long as usual, Speakes said, discussing for
eign policy issues.
The three are presidential counselor
Edwin Meese, chief of staff James Baker
and deupty chief of staff Michael Deaver.
Speakes also said the president had been
given an advance copy of a speech Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, will deliver in Chi
cago later today outlining the Democrats'
tax cut plan, which would be an alternative
to the administration's.

Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) is expected to call
for a tax cut that is both more complex and
about $11 billion smaller than the adminis
tration version.
Speakes, relaying word from Dr. Daniel
Ruge that "this is the president's best day
yet," said Reagan was receiving on a daily
basis a report from the State Department,
and well as reports on White House mail,
policy recommendations from his Cabinet
councils and personnel recommendations.
In addition, Speakes said Reagan was
being briefed "extensively" on the progress
of his economic program in the House and
Senate.
Asked about the president's appearance
and whether he was looking drawn, Speakes
said "there has been some weight loss."
