Elections of member's of the
senior editorial staff of the
Stanford Journal of Interna
tional Lau\ extended an extra
day due to close competition for
the position of managing editor,
were completed this Wednesday
at the Law School. Second-year
student Brian Monkarsh was
selected as editor-in-chief by
Journal members from a field
of three candidates.
Journal members also
selected three new managing
editors. Unsuccessful can
didates for editor-in-chief
Katherine Mason and Ken Ro
senblatt were elected to two of
these positions. They were
joined by Tom Pauly, winner of
Wednesday's special runoff
election.
The Stanford Journal of In
ternational Law is among the
oldest and most respected publi
cations in its field. Its recently
published issue on transborder
data flow, hailed as a seminal
work in an area of growing con

cern, has helped greatly to in
crease subscriptions and en
hance the national and interna
tional stature the Journal en
joys.
Monkarsh said he intends to
maintain and develop that stat
ure by continuing to publish is
sues on important topics and by
attracting some of the best and

most qualified writers in the
world. In an interview with the
Daily, he pointed to upcoming
issues on international tele
communications and interna
tional antitrust law as examples
of each of these areas of effort.
According to Monkarsh, the
continued success of the Jour
nal is important to the Stanford
community in several ways.

Publication of the Journal rep
resents an opportunity for in
terested law students to develop
unique and varied research
skills, as well as editing and ad
ministrative experience with an
internationally recognized aca
demic publication.
While published articles must
have a core of legal analysis, the

interdisciplinary nature of its
subject matter allows the Jour
nal to serve as a forum for a
wealth of otherwise untapped
energy and creative potential of
individuals throughout the Uni
versity. Articles need not be
written by law students, schol
ars, or practitioners, and are
frequently written by authors
with different perspectives on

international law
Monkarsh points out that the
Journal is read by foreign policy
decisionmakers in the State De
partment and elsewhere, mak
ing work on the-Journal both in
teresting and important. "The
quality of the dialogue on issues
presented in the -Journal inures
to the benefit both of the Univer
sity and of the academic com
munity as a whole," stated
Monkarsh.
While the membership of the
Journal has doubled in the past
two years, some problems still
present challenges to continued
quality and growth. One is the
sheer size of the staff itself.
Monkarsh plans to appoint a
senior editor to be specifically
responsible for personnel mat
ters. And while others have
commented on the financial dif
ficulties facing student-run or
ganizations in the near future,
Monkarsh is confident that the
Journal will continue to enjoy
the support of the University
community, especially the Law
School and its alumni.
"The bottom line," said
Monkarsh, "is to publish the
best possible journal of interna
tional law. We must continue to
attract top-notch authors. When
we do that, everything else fol
lows."
Other students were elected
to Journal staff positions in un
contested races by affirmation.
They include: executive editor,
Laura Peterson; assistant man
aging editor, Lou Eber; busi
ness manager, Peter Cannon;
and book review editors, Norma
Harris and Amy Roth. The new
ly elected topic development
editors, whose work will involve
the conception and production
of future issues, are Valda
Staton, Jeri Stewart, and
Meredith Lobel. Lobel was
named Senior Topic Develop
ment Editor yesterday.
