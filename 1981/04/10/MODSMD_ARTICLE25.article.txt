# Public shuns study of religion
## 
### Associated Press 
In banning religious devotions irom the
classroom 18 years ago, the U.S. Supreme
Court specified it didn't want to prevent public
schools from teaching about religion, but to en
courage it. Yet there isn't much of it.
Nor is there any general public outcry for it.
Ironically, however, there is a lot of pressure
tor what the court ruled illegal — officially
sponsored prayers or devotional readings.
The peculiar situation is cited by two experts
in the field, educator William Collie and re
ligious historian David Barr of Wright State
University in Dayton, Ohio.
They're co-directors of the Public Education
Religious Studies Center, which seeks to en
courage and develop public school courses
about religion, but they report a general lack of
such education.
Because of the scant public interest, any
growth of such education seems likely to re
main slow, in scattered places, usually by in
itiative of individual teachers, the professors
wrote in Church & State recently.
They say that instead of people acting to pro
mote objective study about religion and its role
in civilization, the present clamor focuses on
efforts to restore outlawed devotionals in
schools.
"It's quite odd," comments Joseph Conn, as
sistant editor of the monthly published by
Americans United for Separation of Church
and State, which has offices in Silver Springs,
Md.
"The religious right rails that the Supreme
Court was against religion, but actually the

court was for it,"he says. Curiously, he adds,
the critics push for the outlawed devotional
practices, but do nothing to promote study of
religion which the court urged.
He says "we have a big educational job" to
do in making people aware of religion's right
ful place in education, but to which they, and
the school, have so far scarcely given any at
tention.
"Our organization has always favored ob
jective teaching about religion, the Bible as lit
erature and history and its enduring in
fluence," he says. "A person's education is not
complete without including religion and its im
portance in history and society."
That concept is just what the Supreme Court
expressed in its landmark 1962 and 1963 de
cisions outlawing state-sponsored religious
practices — prayer and Bible devotionals — in
the schools.
The majority decision included this admoni
tion:
"It might well be said that one's education is
not complete without a study of comparative
religion or of the history of religion and its re
lationship to the advancement of civilization.
"It certainly may be that the Bible is worthy
of study tor its literary and historic qualities.
Nothing we have said here indicates that study
of the Bible or religion, when presented objec
tively . . . may not be effected consistently
with the First Amendment."
Nevertheless, Collie and Barr report that lit
tle such teaching is being done, and that not
much change can be expected by educators
without more public demand for it.
