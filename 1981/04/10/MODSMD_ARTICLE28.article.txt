## The
						DH rule: pitch it or pinch hit

Sneaker-to-Sneaker is a commentary written by sports edi
tors Sally Jenkins and Steve Odell.
The issue this week is the American Baseball League des
ignated hitter rule, which, though it has been in effect for
some time, is still hotly dfbated in some quarters.

The American League has this neat thing, its called the des
ignated hitterrule, that might well be the most exciting in
novation in America's favorite pastime since someone de
cided that spit and baseballs went well together.
This rule allows a manager to designate a certain batter to
hit in place of the pitcher, who is usually the weakest player at
the plate. Some old time baseball fans might call this a form
of cheating. I prefer to call it "creative interpretation" of the
game.
Those in favor of the rule generally fall back on the stan
dard argument that it makes the game more exciting because
it drives up game scores, which means that the fans see a lot
more offensive and defensive action.
The baseball season is entirely too long. But at least I know
that the designated hitter rule will make Monday Night
Baseball a little more tolerable through the long months
ahead. The Phillies won the series last year, and we all sighed
as we tossed our mitts on the top shelf of the closet, half re
lieved it was finally over.
I took my own down the other day, only to find that it hadn't
dried out yet, much less cracked. "Uh oh," I thought. "Does
the season really last that long?" The designated hitter rule
will allow a team to win a game a little more quickly than per
haps it should, so not only will the added excitement make the
time go faster, it will also end the games earlier, which
means we can all go back to watching MASH.
Under the designated hitter rule old players can stick
around and still contribute to their team by way of the plate.
Would you force a Hall of Famer into retirement just because
his legs are gone?
Under the designated hitter rule adoring young kids don't
have to watch their illusions go down the drain as their favor
ite pitcher steps up to the plate, and immediately becomes
their previous favorite.
Under the designated hitter rule I don't have to watch a
pitcher do his imitation of Jane Fonda trying to swordfight.

Imagine you are the major league manager. The game is
tied in the top of the eighth. There are two outs and you've got
a man on second. Your ace reliever is scheduled to bat, and
he's got an inning of shutout ball under his belt.
His ERA is a lean 2.09 on the year. On the bench, you've got
a corps of relievers whose cumulative GPA is close to Bob
Lanier's shoe size. You've also got I. Ken Hittemout, a man
who makes Dave Kingman look like an overgrown Girl Scout.
Now for your big decision, do you pull him, or leave him in?
You are the manager.
Unfortunately for baseball fans, situations such as these,
which allow the manager in everyone of us to come-to-life, no
longer exist in the American League. Why? Because of the
designated hitter rule. So they can let 40-year old men with
beer bellies "bring more excitement into the game."
But tell me, what could be more exciting than situations
like the one described above?
And that is the main reason I am against the DH rule, be
cause it takes away so much of the strategy that so beautifully
belongs to baseball and no other sport.
Baseball, too, as I knew it, was a game where you had to be
a complete player. Being a competitor in the sport required
one to master a certain number of. for the most part, un
related skills. And, at least in the majors, on a superior level.
But the DH rule changed all that, too. Now, a pitcher no
longer has to be able to hit â€” he has someone do it for him. The
DH likewise, doesn't have to field.
To me, someone like Warren Spahn exemplifies all the
qualities of the complete player. Spahn won 363 games in his
lifetime, and one has to wonder how many of those he would
have not have won, had it not been for his bat.
Now don't get me wrong. I am not averse to all mod
ifications to the sport. Nighttime World Series games, more
colorful uniforms, and ultra-modern ballparks are all fine by
me.
Indeed, I can be seen as a proponent of change in this issue.
I would rather see a hungry, young ballplayer who is able to
perform all the skills that baseball requires move onto the
scorecard than to see his spot in the line-up taken up by some
old codger who can't bend over to tie his shoe, and calls time
after getting to first base in order to receive oxygen.
DH in baseball now stands for designated hitter. I think it
should stand for dry heaves.
