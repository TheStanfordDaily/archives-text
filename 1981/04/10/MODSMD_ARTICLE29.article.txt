# Cards sign three others
## Rogers opts for the Farm 
### Chris Haft 
The Associated Press reported early this morn
ing that Johnny Rogers, a two-time all-CIF
basketball player, has signed a letter of intent to
attend Stanford. This report was received after
the accompanying article was written.

Whether Stanford head basketball coach Dick
DiBiaso will finish with a smashing recruiting ef
fort as opposed to merely a satisfying one will be
determined today.
Three fairly talented high school seniors signed
letters of intent Wednesday to attend the Univer
sity, but DiBiaso still awaits the decision of &-
foot-9 Johnny Rogers, a southern California su
perstar who is considering both Stanford and
Iowa.
A reliable source told the Daily that Rogers will
make his choice today. The source said that Rog
ers' parents want him to attend Stanford, though
Rogers himself is leaning toward Iowa.
A superb outside shooter, Rogers averaged 32.4
points per game this past season for La Quinta
High in Westminster, located in Orange County.
He was named the California Interscholastic Fed
eration's (CIF) Player of the Year on the AAA
level and finished as the CIF's second-leading
scorer overall.
"If Stanford got Rogers, he would be the
school's best recruit since Rich Kelley (the Cards'
7-foot all-conference center from 1972-75)," the
source said.

Head coach Dick Dißiaso and assistant coach
Cory Russell were unavailable for comment and
ensconced in southern California, waiting and
hoping that Rogers will make them jolly.
Already tucked safely under Cardinal wraps
are 6-foot-2 guard Steve Brown from San Diego, 6-
foot-8 forward Kent Seymour of Long Beach and 6-
foot-6 guard-forward Charles Hunt, an Oakland
native.
Brown was the 1980 San Diego CIF Player of the
Year for Patrick Henry High. This past season, he
averaged 18.4 points and 8.5 assists. Quickness is
apparently one of his strengths — he owns the best
440-yard dash time in San Diego County (49.0).
Seymour averaged only 11.6 points per game,
but that figure is deceiving for the coach at his
high school, Long Beach Polytechnic, was a team
oriented sort who kept his players from ac
cumulating gaudy statistics. When Seymour
faced Brad Wright, a 6-foot-10 scoring machine
from Daniel Murphy High headed for UCLA, he
held Wright to nine points.
Hunt, whom USF wanted dearly, averaged 24.8
points and 14.4 rebounds for Head-Royce school
this season.
Dißiaso, then, has succeeded in approaching
his successes of last year, when he snatched Keith
Jones, Roger Lemons, John Revelli and Hans
Wichary, all of whom contributed positively to
Stanford's improvement as freshmen last season.
Should Dißiaso lure Rogers to the Farm, those
successes would, at the very least, be matched.
