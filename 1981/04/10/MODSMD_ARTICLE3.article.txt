# Columbia shuttle ready for space launch today
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Men, machine and nature all
seemed in harmony yesterday tor the
scheduled launch this morning of the
space shuttle Columbia with
astronauts John Young and Robert
Crippen at the controls.
If all continued going well through
the final hours of the countdown last
night and early this morning, the Co
lumbia was to roar away from its
launch pad at 6:50 a.m. today EST
(3:50 a.m. PST).
"We are ready," the astronauts told
Vice President George Bush, who tele
phoned from the White House yester
day morning.
At a news conference yesterday, af
ternoon NASA and Air Force officials
spoke about the people, and the sys
tems involved with this first flight of
the space shuttle.
"The crew's health is excellent,"
said Dr. Craig Fisher, the astronauts'
physician.
"We are in good shape," Launch
Control Director George Page said of
the Columbia spaceplane.
In addition, the weather was looking
good at just about every site around
the planet that might become part of
the mission: here at Cape Canaveral;
at Edwards Air Force Base in Califor
nia, where the Columbia is scheduled
to land Sunday, at the four emergency
landing fields, White Sands Missile
Range, New Mexico, Rota, Spain;
Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii;
and Kadena Air Base, Ryuku Islands,
Japan. The shuttle, after 54Vi hours in
space, is to land Sunday morning on
Rogers Dry Lake adjacent to NASA's
Dryden Flight Research Center at the
Edwards base.
Rains several weeks ago caused
concern that the 65-square-mile lake
bed might be too soggy for the 75-ton

shuttle. But the desert sun arid hot,
dusty winds quickly dried the salty
clay surface, now hard as concrete
and ready for the shuttle's touchdown.
Skies over the desert air base yes
terday were cloudless with nearly un
limited visibility trom the low
Rosamond Hills west of the lake bed to
the blue Leuhman Ridge to the east.
NASA spokesman Jim Kukowski
said, "The Sunday weather looks ex
cellent."
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts
Young and Crippen wolfed down "Tex
as-sized" steaks and went to bed at
4.30 p.m. EST.
They were to be awakened after 2
a.m. this morning for a launch-day
breakfast of orange juice, toast,
sausage and eggs, and then helped into
their flight suits.
Unlike previous Mercury, Gemini
and Apollo mission astronauts, who
wore bulky space suits, Young, 50, and
Crippen, 43, were to wear the sort of
high-performance flight suits worn by
Air Force pilots of the SR-71 strategic
reconnaissance jet aircraft. Conven
tional space suits will be aboard the
Columbia in case the crew might need
them for work outside the spaceplane
during their time in space.
It is both a measure of the im
portance of the space shuttle and an
indication of the ever-present threat
of terrorism that the Columbia is
guarded by a new Space~A,g«n<-y
SWAT team.
The special guards wear berets,
mirrored sunglasses, jungle
camouflage suits, paratrooper boots
and are heavily armed with several
kinds ot automatic weapons.
The guards are employees ot
Wackenhut Services Inc., a company
hired by the space agency to provide
security for this vast 144,000-acre fed
eral reservation. The guards are
mostly Vietnam War veterans and ex
policemen with Special Weapons and
Tactics experience.
"We don't like to call them a SWAT
team," said Charles Buckley, the di
rector of security for the Kennedy
Space Center here. "We call them
ALERT squads for Advance Logistics
Emergency Response Teams."
Buckley was reluctant to talk about
the special security force. He refused
to say how many guards are patrolling
the Columbia.
Buckley did say, however, that the
force was formed in 1979, that the
guards sometimes use specially
trained dogs in their patrols, and that
they report into a centralized security
command center here.
He also added that it was the threat
of terrorism that led to the estab
lishment of the squad two years ago,
but he said that neither the shuttle Co
lumbia nor its astronaut crew have re
ceived any specific threats.
If the mission begins as scheduled,
today promises to be a busy one for the

two astronauts. They would feel the
three liquid-fueled rocket engines at
the stern of the Columbia roar to life
at minus 3.8 seconds in the countdown.
Because the first launch of the shut
tle was also to be the first flight of the
shuttle with a human crew — in sharp
contrast to past American space pro
grams, where the space ships were
flown with animals or computers as
surrogate astronauts to demonstrate
their safety — space agency officials
developed elaborate plans for alter
nate trajectories tor the Columbia, in
case problems arose after launch.
In one case, the shuttle would quick
ly shed the two solid motors and with
its liquid engines still thrusting, make

a big sweeping turn and return to the
15,000-foot-long landing strip here on
the Kennedy space center.
In another alternate plan, if the Co
lumbia had flown too far out over the
Atlantic Ocean to return to Cape Ca
naveral, it would jettison the solid
boosters, cross the Atlantic and at
tempt to land at Rota, Spain.
In still another possible flight plan,
the Columbia might have barely made
it into a lower orbit than planned and
completed at least one revolution of
the earth before coming back down at
White Sands Missile range in New
Mexico. Other available sites include
air bases in the Hawaiian and Ryuka
islands.

mostly Vietnam War veterans and ex
policemen with Special Weapons and
Tactics experience.
"We don't like to call them a SWAT
team," said Charles Buckley, the di
rector of security for the Kennedy
Space Center here. "We call them
ALERT squads for Advance Logistics
Emergency Response Teams."
Buckley was reluctant to talk about
the special security force. He refused
to say how many guards are patrolling
the Columbia.
Buckley did say, however, that the
force was formed in 1979, that the
guards sometimes use specially
trained dogs in their patrols, and that
they report into a centralized security
command center here.
He also added that it was the threat
of terrorism that led to the estab
lishment of the squad two years ago,
but he said that neither the shuttle Co
lumbia nor its astronaut crew have re
ceived any specific threats.
If the mission begins as scheduled,
today promises to be a busy one for the

two astronauts. They would feel the
three liquid-fueled rocket engines at
the stern of the Columbia roar to life
at minus 3.8 seconds in the countdown.
Because the first launch of the shut
tle was also to be the first flight of the
shuttle with a human crew — in sharp
contrast to past American space pro
grams, where the space ships were
flown with animals or computers as
surrogate astronauts to demonstrate
their safety — space agency officials
developed elaborate plans for alter
nate trajectories tor the Columbia, in
case problems arose after launch.
In one case, the shuttle would quick
ly shed the two solid motors and with
its liquid engines still thrusting, make

a big sweeping turn and return to the
15,000-foot-long landing strip here on
the Kennedy space center.
In another alternate plan, if the Co
lumbia had flown too far out over the
Atlantic Ocean to return to Cape Ca
naveral, it would jettison the solid
boosters, cross the Atlantic and at
tempt to land at Rota, Spain.
In still another possible flight plan,
the Columbia might have barely made
it into a lower orbit than planned and
completed at least one revolution of
the earth before coming back down at
White Sands Missile range in New
Mexico. Other available sites include
air bases in the Hawaiian and Ryuka
islands.
From the Daily wire services
Men, machine and nature all
seemed in harmony yesterday tor the
scheduled launch this morning of the
space shuttle Columbia with
astronauts John Young and Robert
Crippen at the controls.
If all continued going well through
the final hours of the countdown last
night and early this morning, the Co
lumbia was to roar away from its
launch pad at 6:50 a.m. today EST
(3:50 a.m. PST).
"We are ready," the astronauts told
Vice President George Bush, who tele
phoned from the White House yester
day morning.
At a news conference yesterday, af
ternoon NASA and Air Force officials
spoke about the people, and the sys
tems involved with this first flight of
the space shuttle.
"The crew's health is excellent,"
said Dr. Craig Fisher, the astronauts'
physician.
"We are in good shape," Launch
Control Director George Page said of
the Columbia spaceplane.
In addition, the weather was looking
good at just about every site around
the planet that might become part of
the mission: here at Cape Canaveral;
at Edwards Air Force Base in Califor
nia, where the Columbia is scheduled
to land Sunday, at the four emergency
landing fields, White Sands Missile
Range, New Mexico, Rota, Spain;
Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii;
and Kadena Air Base, Ryuku Islands,
Japan. The shuttle, after 54Vi hours in
space, is to land Sunday morning on
Rogers Dry Lake adjacent to NASA's
Dryden Flight Research Center at the
Edwards base.
Rains several weeks ago caused
concern that the 65-square-mile lake
bed might be too soggy for the 75-ton

shuttle. But the desert sun arid hot,
dusty winds quickly dried the salty
clay surface, now hard as concrete
and ready for the shuttle's touchdown.
Skies over the desert air base yes
terday were cloudless with nearly un
limited visibility trom the low
Rosamond Hills west of the lake bed to
the blue Leuhman Ridge to the east.
NASA spokesman Jim Kukowski
said, "The Sunday weather looks ex
cellent."
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts
Young and Crippen wolfed down "Tex
as-sized" steaks and went to bed at
4.30 p.m. EST.
They were to be awakened after 2
a.m. this morning for a launch-day
breakfast of orange juice, toast,
sausage and eggs, and then helped into
their flight suits.
Unlike previous Mercury, Gemini
and Apollo mission astronauts, who
wore bulky space suits, Young, 50, and
Crippen, 43, were to wear the sort of
high-performance flight suits worn by
Air Force pilots of the SR-71 strategic
reconnaissance jet aircraft. Conven
tional space suits will be aboard the
Columbia in case the crew might need
them for work outside the spaceplane
during their time in space.
It is both a measure of the im
portance of the space shuttle and an
indication of the ever-present threat
of terrorism that the Columbia is
guarded by a new Space~A,g«n<-y
SWAT team.
The special guards wear berets,
mirrored sunglasses, jungle
camouflage suits, paratrooper boots
and are heavily armed with several
kinds ot automatic weapons.
The guards are employees ot
Wackenhut Services Inc., a company
hired by the space agency to provide
security for this vast 144,000-acre fed
eral reservation. The guards are
mostly Vietnam War veterans and ex
policemen with Special Weapons and
Tactics experience.
