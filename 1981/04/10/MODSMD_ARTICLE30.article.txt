## Racketeers to host Bruins, Trojans 
### Ivan Maisel 
UCLA coach Glenn Bassett
said it's not that important and
USC coach Dick Leach said his
team hasn't got a chance, prov
ing why these men are tennis
coaches instead of press agents.
In spite of their pooh-poohing,
the fact remains that Stanford
will be hosting a sixth-ranked
Trojan squad today (noon) and
the nation's No. 1 team tomor
row (noon and 6:30 p.m. in
Maples) in what will surely be
the best tennis in Stanford Ten
nis Stadium this year.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
has readied his troops, including
a lineup shift, a tactic he doesn't
normally use until after Stan
ford has played all the Pacif
ic-10 Conference schools once.
Scott Bondurant and Mike
Falberg will each move up one
spot, to four and five respective
ly, while junior Jeff Arons will
drop to No. 6, where he played
for most of last year.
Bondurant has yet to be
beaten in dual match play, while
Gould has said all along Falberg
would be moved up. Arons has
been complaining of a recent
loss of confidence, so Gould said
the move "might take a little
pressure off him."
The pressure of tomorrow's

match with NCAA co-favorite
UCLA has overshadowed to
day's match, a problem which
always gives coaches night
mares. "We can't let ourselves
look past USC," Gould said this
week, pointing out that the Tro
jans had match points on Stan
ford in both meetings last year.
But as Leach said yesterday,
that was last year and this is this
year. "I think we'll be a little ov
ermatched against Stanford.
We've lost (NCAA singles
champion) Robert Van't Hof,
who turned pro after his junior
year, and Doug Adler, who was
9-1 in Pac-10 singles last year,"
Leach said. "That really hurt
us, because I did not gain any
new players."
Not that what he has is so ter
rible. The Trojans are 21-4 this
year, having lost to Pepperdine
twice (5-4 both times), Georgia
and Arizona last weekend.
USC has played 25 dual
matches this season, while Stan
ford is but 8-0. Gould chooses to
build slowly and peak at the
NCAA tournament, but Leach
thinks differently.
"My philosophy is to have the
kids play a lot of matches. It
gives all the kids a chance to

play. I think they need this kind
of competition, which is dif
ferent from what some coaches
believe," Leach said.
USC's starting lineup will be
Billy Nealon, Sean Brawley,
Roger Knapp, Jack Kruger, Jim
Agate and Hugo Scott. The first
four players come intact from
last year's team, which finished
third in the nation. Nonetheless,
Stanford should have little prob
lem. As Leach said, "Their top
four players are better than any
of mine."
Gould wouldn't make that
claim even if he believed it. He
doesn't have to worry about
making that claim against
UCLA: they're too good.
The Bruins are so strong up
top that Bassett has been rotat
ing his top three guys, trying to
figure out who should play No. 1.
He said yesterday he would not
determine the starting lineup
until after yesterday's practice.
Whatever it is, it will be strong.
Playing No. 1 lately has been
Marcel Freeman, the epitome
of the streak player. In the
NCAAs last year, Freeman
wiped out future pro star Mel
Purcell 6-3,6-0 in the first round,
followed with a straight-set vic-

Tory over highly-regarded Ron
Hightower of Arkansas and then
collapsed in straight sets.
Behind him are last year's
No. 1, Robbie Venter and gritty
Blaine Willenborg. Rounding
out the lineup will be John
Davis, a high school teammate
(but no relation) of Stanford's
Scott Davis, Bruce Brescia, and
either Dan Saltz or Venter's
younger brother Craig.
Bassett refused to make out
tomorrow's match to be more
than a bellwether of his team's
progress. "It's not the most im
portant match of the year by a
longshot. Both teams are awful
ly good. The most important
would be if we met at the
NCAAs," Bassett said.
The difference could be the
homecourt edge, according to
the UCLA coach. "The outdoor
surroundings, the crowd, the
bigger courts, the whole en
vironment contributes,"
Bassett said. "A good player
can overcome all that. The
same thing happens when Stan
ford comes down here."
The Bruins are 14-1 this sea
son, and avenged the 7-2 loss at
Pepperdine with a 8-1 mauling
of the Waves at home.

will be hosting a sixth-ranked
Trojan squad today (noon) and
the nation's No. 1 team tomor
row (noon and 6:30 p.m. in
Maples) in what will surely be
the best tennis in Stanford Ten
nis Stadium this year.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
has readied his troops, including
a lineup shift, a tactic he doesn't
normally use until after Stan
ford has played all the Pacif
ic-10 Conference schools once.
Scott Bondurant and Mike
Falberg will each move up one
spot, to four and five respective
ly, while junior Jeff Arons will
drop to No. 6, where he played
for most of last year.
Bondurant has yet to be
beaten in dual match play, while
Gould has said all along Falberg
would be moved up. Arons has
been complaining of a recent
loss of confidence, so Gould said
the move "might take a little
pressure off him."
The pressure of tomorrow's

match with NCAA co-favorite
UCLA has overshadowed to
day's match, a problem which
always gives coaches night
mares. "We can't let ourselves
look past USC," Gould said this
week, pointing out that the Tro
jans had match points on Stan
ford in both meetings last year.
But as Leach said yesterday,
that was last year and this is this
year. "I think we'll be a little ov
ermatched against Stanford.
We've lost (NCAA singles
champion) Robert Van't Hof,
who turned pro after his junior
year, and Doug Adler, who was
9-1 in Pac-10 singles last year,"
Leach said. "That really hurt
us, because I did not gain any
new players."
Not that what he has is so ter
rible. The Trojans are 21-4 this
year, having lost to Pepperdine
twice (5-4 both times), Georgia
and Arizona last weekend.
USC has played 25 dual
matches this season, while Stan
ford is but 8-0. Gould chooses to
build slowly and peak at the
NCAA tournament, but Leach
thinks differently.
"My philosophy is to have the
kids play a lot of matches. It
gives all the kids a chance to

play. I think they need this kind
of competition, which is dif
ferent from what some coaches
believe," Leach said.
USC's starting lineup will be
Billy Nealon, Sean Brawley,
Roger Knapp, Jack Kruger, Jim
Agate and Hugo Scott. The first
four players come intact from
last year's team, which finished
third in the nation. Nonetheless,
Stanford should have little prob
lem. As Leach said, "Their top
four players are better than any
of mine."
Gould wouldn't make that
claim even if he believed it. He
doesn't have to worry about
making that claim against
UCLA: they're too good.
The Bruins are so strong up
top that Bassett has been rotat
ing his top three guys, trying to
figure out who should play No. 1.
He said yesterday he would not
determine the starting lineup
until after yesterday's practice.
Whatever it is, it will be strong.
Playing No. 1 lately has been
Marcel Freeman, the epitome
of the streak player. In the
NCAAs last year, Freeman
wiped out future pro star Mel
Purcell 6-3,6-0 in the first round,
followed with a straight-set vic-

Tory over highly-regarded Ron
Hightower of Arkansas and then
collapsed in straight sets.
Behind him are last year's
No. 1, Robbie Venter and gritty
Blaine Willenborg. Rounding
out the lineup will be John
Davis, a high school teammate
(but no relation) of Stanford's
Scott Davis, Bruce Brescia, and
either Dan Saltz or Venter's
younger brother Craig.
Bassett refused to make out
tomorrow's match to be more
than a bellwether of his team's
progress. "It's not the most im
portant match of the year by a
longshot. Both teams are awful
ly good. The most important
would be if we met at the
NCAAs," Bassett said.
The difference could be the
homecourt edge, according to
the UCLA coach. "The outdoor
surroundings, the crowd, the
bigger courts, the whole en
vironment contributes,"
Bassett said. "A good player
can overcome all that. The
same thing happens when Stan
ford comes down here."
The Bruins are 14-1 this sea
son, and avenged the 7-2 loss at
Pepperdine with a 8-1 mauling
of the Waves at home.

Stanford tennis player Scott Bondurant has been moved up the Cardinal ladder for this weekend's
matches with USC and UCLA, in both singles and doubles. Bondurant will play at number four in sin
gles and will team up with Scott Davis to play number one doubles.
UCLA coach Glenn Bassett
said it's not that important and
USC coach Dick Leach said his
team hasn't got a chance, prov
ing why these men are tennis
coaches instead of press agents.
In spite of their pooh-poohing,
the fact remains that Stanford
will be hosting a sixth-ranked
Trojan squad today (noon) and
the nation's No. 1 team tomor
row (noon and 6:30 p.m. in
