# Four-way tie at Masters
## 
### 
Augusta, Ga. — The first round of the Masters
is golf s sylvan circus. Every year the dizzying
potpourri seems similar, yet richly different.
The day is a long welter of heros and victims;
yet, at sundown, the results are utterly indetermi
nant: a four-way tie for the lead at 69, a seven-way
logjam for second place at 70 and 27 players within
three shots of the lead.
The scores, both good and bad, which are of
most general interest like those of the leaders —
Johnny Miller (69), Lon Hinkle (69), Curtis
Strange (69) and Australia's Greg Norman (69) —
and of Jack Nicklaus (70), Hubert Green (70),
Isao Aoki (70), Tom Watson (71), Bruce Lietzke
(72), Hale Irvin (73), Ray Floyd (75), Lee Trevino
(77), Lee Elder (77) and Severiano Ballesteros (78
on his birthday) — must share the bill with events
that are bizarre, piquant and fleeting.
Out from the junipers pops a dazzled amateur
who discovers that he's been paired with Arnold
Palmer. His name is Jim Holtgrieve, and he
shoots the round of his life: 70. "At the second
hole, I asked Palmer if I could call him 'Arnold,' "
said Holtgrieve, a St. Louis salesman with an ad
mittedly modest game. "He said, 'Hell, call me
Arnie.' I said, 'Thank you, sir.' "
Look behind a Chinese fir and there's a foreign
unheralded in America, who, in the next
lo-the-last group of the day, ties for the lead, after
taking his only bogey of the day at the 18th. He's
the 26-year-old Norman, a glamorous interna
tional slugger with $250,000 in '80 winnings, who
looks like the playboy everybody says he is.
Peek through the holly and what do you see but a
Tour star who cards a 70, then discovers he's been
clobbered with six strokes in penalties. That's
Keith Fergus who, after two drives so long and
straight that they rolled into crowd crosswalks,

thought he was allowed a ground-under-repair
drop into a better lie. Sorry, Keith: fall from one
shot off the lead to 53rd place.
Glance beneath a flowering crabapple and who
should be lurking there but The Bear — Nicklaus
himself — muttering imprecations against his
putter and saying, "This is the best ball-striking
round I've ever played here (since 1959). If I'd had
anybody putting for me, I'd be leading by five
shots."
Listen to the poor-mouthing from among the
azaleas of Humble Hubert Green, moaning, "My
putting stroke is terrible. I know it. Gonna go to
the pro shop and buy a new putter right now. Don't
worry, I'll get out of here (the interview room)
before Nicklaus comes. I know who you really
want to talk to."
Investigate the whimpering behind that Caroli
na Cherry of Doug Tewell, winner of $161,684 last
season. The poor fellow tapped a 50-foot downhill
putt from the back of the slick ninth green, then
watched the ball scream past the hole and roll 15
yards back down the fairway leaving him a 100-
foot comeback. "I'll see your 50 feet," said the
new bent grass green, "and raise you 50."
Who's that sulking behind the magnolias but de
fending champion Ballesteros, the streaky
gambler who believes in luck and omens and who,
when things don't go his way, can do as good an
imitation of a quitter as any top player extant.
The four players atop the huge Augusta Na
tional leaderboard had never shot an opening Mas
ters score better than 71. All were stunned by their
own competence; after all, pin placements were
the hardest for any first round in memory. "Most
of the flags were on the edges of cliffs," snickered
Nicklaus. Not since 1964 has 69 been a good enough
score to lead the first round.

The Stanford men's volleyball team, shown here in a loss to UCLA
at Maples Pavilion, dropped two more matches in Southern Califor
nia over the last two days. The Cards lost to San Diego State
Wednesday night, 15-12, 15-12, 20-18, and then were beaten by the
top-ranked USC Trojans, 15-6, 15-5, 15-4. The team concludes its
road trip when it plays Cal State-Long Beach tonight.

foot comeback. "I'll see your 50 feet," said the
new bent grass green, "and raise you 50."
Who's that sulking behind the magnolias but de
fending champion Ballesteros, the streaky
gambler who believes in luck and omens and who,
when things don't go his way, can do as good an
imitation of a quitter as any top player extant.
The four players atop the huge Augusta Na
tional leaderboard had never shot an opening Mas
ters score better than 71. All were stunned by their
own competence; after all, pin placements were
the hardest for any first round in memory. "Most
of the flags were on the edges of cliffs," snickered
Nicklaus. Not since 1964 has 69 been a good enough
score to lead the first round.

The Stanford men's volleyball team, shown here in a loss to UCLA
at Maples Pavilion, dropped two more matches in Southern Califor
nia over the last two days. The Cards lost to San Diego State
Wednesday night, 15-12, 15-12, 20-18, and then were beaten by the
top-ranked USC Trojans, 15-6, 15-5, 15-4. The team concludes its
road trip when it plays Cal State-Long Beach tonight.
Augusta, Ga. — The first round of the Masters
is golf s sylvan circus. Every year the dizzying
potpourri seems similar, yet richly different.
The day is a long welter of heros and victims;
yet, at sundown, the results are utterly indetermi
nant: a four-way tie for the lead at 69, a seven-way
logjam for second place at 70 and 27 players within
three shots of the lead.
The scores, both good and bad, which are of
most general interest like those of the leaders —
Johnny Miller (69), Lon Hinkle (69), Curtis
Strange (69) and Australia's Greg Norman (69) —
and of Jack Nicklaus (70), Hubert Green (70),
Isao Aoki (70), Tom Watson (71), Bruce Lietzke
(72), Hale Irvin (73), Ray Floyd (75), Lee Trevino
(77), Lee Elder (77) and Severiano Ballesteros (78
on his birthday) — must share the bill with events
that are bizarre, piquant and fleeting.
Out from the junipers pops a dazzled amateur
who discovers that he's been paired with Arnold
Palmer. His name is Jim Holtgrieve, and he
shoots the round of his life: 70. "At the second
hole, I asked Palmer if I could call him 'Arnold,' "
said Holtgrieve, a St. Louis salesman with an ad
mittedly modest game. "He said, 'Hell, call me
Arnie.' I said, 'Thank you, sir.' "
Look behind a Chinese fir and there's a foreign
unheralded in America, who, in the next
lo-the-last group of the day, ties for the lead, after
taking his only bogey of the day at the 18th. He's
the 26-year-old Norman, a glamorous interna
tional slugger with $250,000 in '80 winnings, who
looks like the playboy everybody says he is.
Peek through the holly and what do you see but a
Tour star who cards a 70, then discovers he's been
clobbered with six strokes in penalties. That's
Keith Fergus who, after two drives so long and
straight that they rolled into crowd crosswalks,

thought he was allowed a ground-under-repair
drop into a better lie. Sorry, Keith: fall from one
shot off the lead to 53rd place.
Glance beneath a flowering crabapple and who
should be lurking there but The Bear — Nicklaus
himself — muttering imprecations against his
putter and saying, "This is the best ball-striking
round I've ever played here (since 1959). If I'd had
anybody putting for me, I'd be leading by five
shots."
Listen to the poor-mouthing from among the
azaleas of Humble Hubert Green, moaning, "My
putting stroke is terrible. I know it. Gonna go to
the pro shop and buy a new putter right now. Don't
worry, I'll get out of here (the interview room)
before Nicklaus comes. I know who you really
want to talk to."
Investigate the whimpering behind that Caroli
na Cherry of Doug Tewell, winner of $161,684 last
season. The poor fellow tapped a 50-foot downhill
putt from the back of the slick ninth green, then
watched the ball scream past the hole and roll 15
yards back down the fairway leaving him a 100-
foot comeback. "I'll see your 50 feet," said the
new bent grass green, "and raise you 50."
