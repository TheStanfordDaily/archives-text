# Major league baseball predictions for 1981 season
## NL East 
### John Kosner 
"The Expos have less team feeling
than any club in baseball," writes
Thomas Boswell ot Inside Sports, "to
know them is not to like them."
Fair enough, but the Expos are still
the pick here to win the National
League East. After gagging down the
stretch the past two seasons, the Expos
know they had better get the job done
this year. And they have the talent to do
so.
Gary Carter, Warren Cromartie and
Andre Dawson are all hitting their
primes and the starting pitching — Bill
Gullikson, David Palmer (out until
May), Steve Rogers and Scott Sand
erson — is formidable. Montreal wisely
shipped out big mouth Ron Leflore.
Now, if manager Dick Williams can
only coax mercurial star Ellis Valen
tine oft his personal space shuttle and
back onto the field. . . .
If the Expos stumble again, the de
tending champion Philadelphia
Phillies should repeat as East victors.
Dallas Green's Phils were positively
inspiring as they surged to the title last
autumn. However, it may be different
this time around.
The Phillies are getting old —
catcher Bob Boone is 33, first baseman
Pete Rose is 40 and shortstop Larry
Bowa is 35. The team's two most impor
tant pitchers, Steve Carlton and Tug
McGraw, were unbelievable last sea
son. They will be believable and hit
table this year.
The 1979 champion Pittsburgh
Pirates are also getting old. Willie
Stargell is 40 and Jason Thompson is no
replacement for him. The Buc pitching
(save Jim Bibby) is spotty and the
once-proud bullpen may be over the
hill. If burly Dave Parker is ever going
to have a really big season, the Pirates
could sure use it now.
As usual, St. Louis is a talented
enigma. The Cards finally have a
bullpen stopper in Bruce Sutter and
they have plenty of hitting. But they
folded up shamelessly last season, just
plain gave up. Wil they have more heart
this time around? Who knows?
Rest of the Worst: The Mets now
have Dave Kingman and the Cubs
don't. Big Deal. New York's defense is
abysmal and the Cubs no longer have
the power hitter necessary for success

in matchbox Wrigley Field.
