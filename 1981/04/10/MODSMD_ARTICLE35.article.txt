# NL West
## 
### Steve Odell 
If it is true, as some say, that things
improve with age, then the Los Angeles
Dodgers are in good stead to take their
fourth National League West pennant
in the last eight years.
L.A.'s infield, which has been ridi
culed in the past, has been intact now
for seven seasons — and in those seven
years, the boys from Chavez Ravine
have taken three pennants, three sec
ond-place finishes, and one third.
And even though the Dodgers lost
Don Sutton (13-5, 2.21) to the Astros,
they still have a tough pitching staff.
On it, are Jerry "Rolls" Reuss (18-6,
2.52, one no-hitter), and righties Burt
Hooton and Bob Welch, who combined
for 28 victories a year ago.
Even though the Dodgers are a slight
favorite, you've got to like the Astros to
repeat, also. The pitching staff is, to
put it mildly — awesome. They've now
got Sutton, the NL's ERA champ last
year, to add to an already devastating
staff of hurlers. Even if Nolan Ryan
and J R. Richard don't come back from
their setbacks (Richard suffered a
stroke, Ryan a choke), the Astro's
league leading team ERA from 1980
could get better. The bullpen is headed
by Joe Sambito, who had a neat 2.20
ERA last year.
The Atlanta Braves could be the sur
prise team of the division. After the All-
Star break, Ted Turner's team had the
best winning percentage in the league.
They also tried to strengthen their
team by going after free agents Don
Sutton and Dave Winfield. They got
neither, and ended up with Claudell
Washington. Although "Wash" is a fine
player, I seriously doubt that a player
who hit 10 HRs last year is, in Turner's
words, "the power hitter we were look
ing for." With Bob Horner, Dale
Murphy, and Chris Chambliss in the
line-up, the Braves will still dent more
than their share ot cars in the parking
lot. You see, Teddy is a much better
sailor than he is an owner, but that's
OK. Maybe the Braves can win in spite
of him.
Cincinnati is an interesting team,
and one that could take longer to figure
out than it takes Greg Luzinski to go
from first to third. The Reds were both

ered by injuries all year long last sea
son, and among those hampered were
such notables as Tom Seaver, Johnny
"Put me anywhere but behind the
plate" Bench, and Geo. Foster, yet still
managed to finish only four games oft
the pace. If the Reds stay healthy,
watch out.
Battle for the Cellar: It has now been
a decade since the Giants won this
division, and it might be light years
before they win it again The bright
spots are the bullpen — which includes
Gary Lavelle, Greg Minton, and A 1
Holland, and the new manager, Frank
Robinson. And then there's San Diego.
