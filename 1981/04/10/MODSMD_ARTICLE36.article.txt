It is well known by now that Reggie
Jackson, alias Captain Candybar, is not
best friends with the man who employs
him, George Steinbrenner. However,
the owner of the New York Yankees
may not be the man who pays number
44's bills for long. Rest assured that
Mr. Reggievision is not reclining on his
laurels one bit. "If George doesn't sign
me soon," Jackson threatened last
month (obviously feeling the crunch of
not having a brand new 17-figure con
tract), "I'm gonna go out in October
and get me a Brinks job!"
Welcome to the 1981 edition of the
Bronx Zoo. Some of the uniforms have
gained new bodies, but — as always —
paranoia is the order of the season. And
it will only get worse. Dave Wintield is
barely worth a quarter of his $20 mil
lion contract, Tommy John and Rudy
May are getting awfully old, Ron
Guidry doesn't scare hitters anymore,
and there is not one proven right
handed starter in the whole asylum.
A better bet for Eastern honors is
Baltimore. Earl Weaver's starting five
— Scott McGregor, Steve Stone, Mike
Flanagan, Jim Palmer and Dennis
Martinez — is magnificent. But don't
forget Eddie Murray, Ken Singleton
and Rich Dauer — or that wonderfully
deep bench that allows baseball's best
manager endless flexibility in his pla
tooning ploys. Last season, Weaver's
rotating catchers (Rick Dempsey and
Dan Graham) hit 24 home runs and
drove in 93, while his revolving left

field alignment (Terry Crowley, Benny
Ayala and John Lowenstein) accounted
for 26 roundtrippers and 10 RBI.
Milwaukee has added reliever Rollie
Fingers to what was previously the
league's most consistent terrific hit,
zilcho pitch operation. Unfortunately,
as a Boston scribe pointd out, "you
need five Fingers not one." Especially
if you are the Brewers and you're enter
ing the season with new and weaker
gloves at catcher (Ted Simmons), sec
ond base (Jim Gantner), third base
(Roy Howell), and in center field (Paul
Molitor).
Elsewhere: it will be interesting to
see where Detroit finds the pitching it
needs, how Cleveland's Joe
Charboneau develops, whether or not
Toronto's Danny Ainge can hit, and
how the Fenway Park faithful react
over the weekend of June 19 to 21 when
the Boston Angels come to town.
