# AL West

### Steve Odell 
How long has it been? Five, six years
ago? Just how long/zas it been since the
Oakland A's won the American
League's Western Division on which
they had a veritable lock and key for
five years, during a period when they
were crowned world champions three
consecutive times.
Those were the glory days of the
past, when they had guys like Rollie
Fingers and Reggie Jackson and Sal
Bando and Joe Rudi and Catfish Hunter
and ... the list could go on longer than
the line that forms at the men's room
during the seventh inning stretch on 10-
cent beer night. The "Days of the A's"
are all in the past, demolished by the
free agent system like a crane smashes
through a glass house, and not soon to
reappear.
Or are they?
Tony Armas (.279, 35 HR, 109 RBI
last year), is not exactly a household
name now, but after this year, look for
him to be as familiar as Formula 409.
He is at the core of the best defensive
outfield in the league, which also fea
tures Rickey "Asbestos Shoes" Hen
derson (a cool 100 stolen bases a year
ago) and Dwayne Murphy, who won a
gold glove while hitting 13 homers and
batting .274.
The A's' starting pitching staff is as

solid as any, the questions arise in the
bullpen. Last year the A's had 94 com
plete games. Ninety-four. But ifSpacey
Bob Lacey comes off his cloud, the A's
should be tough coming out of the golf
cart, too.
The squad also has one other element
that might be the most important of all
— Billy Martin as their manager.
The A's will be challenged, of course,
by the reigning champs, the Kansas
City Royals. KC finally beat their
toughest opponent last year, them
selves, and took the AL pennant.
George Brett flirted with .400 all sea
son long and ended up at .390. You don't
win pennants with one man teams how
ever, as the never-never Twins of Rod
Carew's day are testimony of.
But that is not the case here. Willie
Wilson was another top ten hitter (.326)
and also stole 79 bases. Dan Quisen
berry was 12-7 in relief and won the
league's fireman award, and Larry
Gura won 18 games for a staff that was
second in the league to Oakland's. So
KC can easily win their fifth title in six
years.
But the Angels are another team to
keep your eye on. California has enough
talent to stock an All-Star game
scorecard. They've got Fred Lynn in
center, Rick Burleson at short, and all
the oldies but goodies. If you take each
player's best season, Fregosi's starting
line-up averages out to .304, 24 homers,
and 104 RBIs. Stick your tongue back in
vour head, Jim.
While many predictions have Texas
tabbed to take the division, I just can't
see it. The Rangers do have stars, (A 1
Oliver, Jim Sundberg, Buddy Bell), but
they have no bull — literally. Sparky
Lyle was dealt to the Phils, and Jim
Kern was 3-11 last year. Danny Darwin,
who was 13-4 with eight saves in '80, is
sorely needed in the starting rotation.
The Rest in the West: Seattle's team
is exemplified by Mike Parrot, who
won on opening day, and ended up 1-16.
Power hitter(?) Tom Paciorek led the
team in homers with 15 — and although
the acquisition of Jeff Burroughs and
Richie Zisk will help — it's not enough.
Even if the White Sox change out of
their black pajamas into new uniforms,
one thing won't change — their place in
the division, even though they have a
top young pitcher named Steve (Rain
bow) Trout. And Minnesota, well,
there's just one word for the Twins.
Sorry.

player's best season, Fregosi's starting
line-up averages out to .304, 24 homers,
and 104 RBIs. Stick your tongue back in
vour head, Jim.
While many predictions have Texas
tabbed to take the division, I just can't
see it. The Rangers do have stars, (A 1
Oliver, Jim Sundberg, Buddy Bell), but
they have no bull — literally. Sparky
Lyle was dealt to the Phils, and Jim
Kern was 3-11 last year. Danny Darwin,
who was 13-4 with eight saves in '80, is
sorely needed in the starting rotation.
The Rest in the West: Seattle's team
is exemplified by Mike Parrot, who
won on opening day, and ended up 1-16.
Power hitter(?) Tom Paciorek led the
team in homers with 15 — and although
the acquisition of Jeff Burroughs and
Richie Zisk will help — it's not enough.
Even if the White Sox change out of
their black pajamas into new uniforms,
one thing won't change — their place in
the division, even though they have a
top young pitcher named Steve (Rain
bow) Trout. And Minnesota, well,
there's just one word for the Twins.
Sorry.
How long has it been? Five, six years
ago? Just how long/zas it been since the
Oakland A's won the American
League's Western Division on which
they had a veritable lock and key for
five years, during a period when they
were crowned world champions three
consecutive times.
Those were the glory days of the
past, when they had guys like Rollie
Fingers and Reggie Jackson and Sal
Bando and Joe Rudi and Catfish Hunter
and ... the list could go on longer than
the line that forms at the men's room
during the seventh inning stretch on 10-
cent beer night. The "Days of the A's"
are all in the past, demolished by the
free agent system like a crane smashes
through a glass house, and not soon to
reappear.
Or are they?
Tony Armas (.279, 35 HR, 109 RBI
last year), is not exactly a household
name now, but after this year, look for
him to be as familiar as Formula 409.
He is at the core of the best defensive
outfield in the league, which also fea
tures Rickey "Asbestos Shoes" Hen
derson (a cool 100 stolen bases a year
ago) and Dwayne Murphy, who won a
gold glove while hitting 13 homers and
batting .274.
The A's' starting pitching staff is as

solid as any, the questions arise in the
bullpen. Last year the A's had 94 com
plete games. Ninety-four. But ifSpacey
Bob Lacey comes off his cloud, the A's
should be tough coming out of the golf
cart, too.
The squad also has one other element
that might be the most important of all
— Billy Martin as their manager.
The A's will be challenged, of course,
by the reigning champs, the Kansas
City Royals. KC finally beat their
toughest opponent last year, them
selves, and took the AL pennant.
George Brett flirted with .400 all sea
son long and ended up at .390. You don't
win pennants with one man teams how
ever, as the never-never Twins of Rod
Carew's day are testimony of.
But that is not the case here. Willie
Wilson was another top ten hitter (.326)
and also stole 79 bases. Dan Quisen
berry was 12-7 in relief and won the
league's fireman award, and Larry
Gura won 18 games for a staff that was
second in the league to Oakland's. So
KC can easily win their fifth title in six
years.
But the Angels are another team to
keep your eye on. California has enough
talent to stock an All-Star game
scorecard. They've got Fred Lynn in
center, Rick Burleson at short, and all
the oldies but goodies. If you take each
player's best season, Fregosi's starting
line-up averages out to .304, 24 homers,
and 104 RBIs. Stick your tongue back in
vour head, Jim.
