The men's volleyball team
will conclude what has been a
very long road trip tonight,
against Cal-State Long Beach
The Cardinals lost a heart
breaker to San Diego Stale in
three games Wednesday night,
15-12, 15-12, 20-18. Last night the
team was virtually humiliated
by the No. 1 team in the nation,
USC, 15-6, 15-5, 15-4.
According to Stanford head
coach Fred Sturm, his team
"couldn't seem to make the big
play at the right time." against
San Diego.
It was the longest match he
had ever been involved in, last
ing a total of one hour and 45
minutes, which works out to an
average of 20 minutes per game.
The Cardinals found them
selves playing catch-up ball
from the start of the match. Af
ter falling behind 9-4 in the first
game they managed to work
their way to an 11-10 lead, only
to lose minutes later.
In the second game, the team
fell behind 7-2, then caught up
and took a 12-10 lead, only to
watch it disappear again.
The third game was a night
mare, with the Cardinals initial
ly up 10-4. The two teams battled
back and forth trading scores,
with Stanford unable to break

San Diego at the crucial points.
As for the USC match, "It was
a simple case of being out
manned,'' said Sturm. Of the
two matches taken as a whole he
said, "We played pretty well ov
erall, but it wasn't a great per
formance. USC is the top ranked
team in the nation."
Cal-State Long Beach re
mains the Cardinals only hope
tor a happy return trip. "We
match up fairly well with the
Long Beach team, " Sturm said.
"If we come out and play
well, agressively and con
sistently, we will do well," he
continued.
"It's a question of rebounding
after two defeats . . . and I think
we will."
