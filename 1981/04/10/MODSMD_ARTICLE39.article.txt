Women's Softball
The Stanford women's soft
ball team dropped two games
last week, the first to Saint
Mary's, 13-7, the second to
DeAnza, 15-13.
After scoring a run in the
first, the lady Cardinals were
turned upside down in the sec
ond when St. Mary's erupted for
six runs. The Gaels powered
through five more runs in the
fifth, on a single and back-to
back triples. The Cardinals
were unable to overcome the in
surmountable lead.
The contest against DeAnza
was a close scoring one, with the
Cards tying it up 2-2 at the end of
three innings, then 4-4 at the end
of five.
But again, Stanford gave up a
bad inning when DeAnza scored
eight runs on five consecutive
hits in the seventh, three of
which were back-to-back home
runs.
The Stanford team finally
broke into the winners column
Wednesday afternoon, beating
San Jose State 9-4 at El Camino
field. The visitors started the
scoring with two runs in the first
inning.
Stanford, however, re
sponded with a Pam Hamamato
three-run homer in their own
half of the inning. The Cards
scored two more in the second,
then completed the scoring for
the day with a grand slam home
run in the sixth.
Gryphon Ice Hockey
In Stanford ice hockey, the
Gryphons tied San Jose State,
8-8. Doug Tapper was high
scorer with a three-goal hat
trick.
The Gryphons now have a
7-0-4 league record, and need
only a single point to ensure a
first-place finish. Their next
game will be against Monterey,
to be played at Belmont Iceland
this Sunday beginning at 9 p.m.
