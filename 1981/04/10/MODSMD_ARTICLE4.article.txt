# Students to staff Lambda Nu sleep research lab
## Narcolepsy subject of Stanford summer sleep study

Sixteen Stanford students will
spend their summer watching oth
er people sleep.
The students will be doing re
search work at the Summer Sleep
Camp, a project of the Sleep Re
search Center of the Stanford Med
ical School Psychiatry Depart
ment.
Currently, the students are pre
paring for the research work by
taking "Human Polysomno
graphy," taught by Psychiatry De
partment Research Associate Dr.
Mary Carskadon, the camp's direc
tor.
In the course, the sixteen learn
how to use an electroencephalo
graph (EEG), which records the
electrical activity of the brain.
They also learn how to measure eye
movements, respiration, heart
rate, muscle movement, and the
techniques of cardio-pulmonary re
suscitation.
'Unique' Job
Carskadon calls the summer pro
gram "unique" because the stu
dents take the techniques and skills
they learn in class and apply them
in a summer job.
These skills will be used to con
tinue a on-going Sleep Center study
of the development of narcolepsy, a
disorder of excessive sleepiness
The students also will be involved
in a study of the effects of new
sleeping pills on elderly people suf
fering from insomnia.
Narcolepsy study
Because narcolepsy is believed
to have a genetic component and
generally does not appear until
adolesence, two groups of children
— one whose parents currently suf
fer from narcolepsy and a control
group whose parents have no fami
ly history of the disease — will be
studied at the camp.
The students will administer a
"multiple sleep latency test,"
which will measure how long it
the children to fall asleep at

various times of the day, according
to Carskadon.
The test data. Carskadon says,
will help show how narcolepsy de
velops.
Sleeping pill study
The sleeping pill study will test
recently developed sleeping drugs.
Existing sleeping pills tend to
cause aftereffects of grogginess
and memory loss. The new drugs,
which have been pre-tested by
pharmaceutical firms, will be giv
en to elderly persons currently suf
fering from insomnia.
Hopefully, one or more of the
pills will show less severe after
effects.
Valuable job experience
Students who have worked at the
Sleep Camp in past summers
praise the research work.
Dulcy Petta, an undergraduate
majoring in biology and psy
chology, worked at the camp dur
ing the past two summers.
"It is a good way of learning to
work with kids and another good
way to work with the elderly," Pet
ta said.
"It taught me responsibility . . .
how to be in a position of authority,
and basically it is a very good re
search experience."
Carskadon said that students in
terested in working at the camp in
future summers must take "Physi
ological Psychology of Sleep and
Dreams," taught in the Psychology
Department next autumn by Dr.
William Dement, director of the
Sleep Research Center.
An introductory biology course
would be helpful, but not man
datory, Carskadon said, adding
that students from a variety of de
partments are encourged to apply
for the camp.
The summer workers are paid
from $3.75 to $4 per hour, depending
upon the availability of federal fun
ding from the National Institute of
Aging and the National Institutes
of Health, she noted.

studies include testing of narcoleptic youths and of the effects of new sleep
ing pills on elderly insomniacs.
