La Cumbre Mexican Restaurant
No. 2 Stanford Shopping Center

• Restaurants in large shopping malls gener
ally do not have to be outstanding. They have,
after all, a captive audience of sorts; few
Shoppers are willing to venture far just for a
meal. So I have come to assume that all mall
restaurants will be mediocre at best. La Cum
bre, at the Stanford Shopping Center, next to
Emporium-Capwell, is definitely an excep
tion to the rule. Having opened just 10 months
ago, La Cumbre has steadily gained in popu
larity, primarily because of its good,
authentic Mexican meals, attentive service
and reasonable prices.
The restaurant is open for both lunch and
dinner, and there is a separate bar and lounge
equipped with a giant-screen television. Hav
ing been to the restaurant twice, I would rec
ommend reservations for any time after 6
p.m., but they are not required. The at
mosphere is informal, as one would expect in
a shopping mall environment.
The best way to eat a healthy-sized meal at
a reasonable price would be to take advantage
of one of La Cumbre's daily specials. These
usually run from $5 to $7 and often include an
appetizer, soup or salad, dessert and some
times a complimentary drink. (The drinks

themselves are generous in size and strength
— I strongly recommend the bartender's
"special" margarita.) The cuisine is authen
tic and the portions are very large. An ap
petizer is really not necessary unless you are
either starved or training for the Olympic eat
ing team. However, if you are inclined to glut
tony, then the nachos are a delicious bargain
at $3.95 for a full order, and $1.95 for a half-or
der. A half order was nearly a meal in itself

for both myself and my guest.
Complete meals run from $5 to $10 per per
son. Meals include the main course, and either
soup or salad. Oddly enough, the best food
here is in the lower price categories, with the
chimichanga at $5.50 being a good meal for all
but the most voracious eater. If you are really
hungry, you might try a combination plate in
cluding refried beans, two beef enchiladas and
two tacos. When this is served as a special,

you get that, plus an appetizer, dessert and a
margarita for just $6.25 — certainly one of the
better food bargains in the area
It may be surprising, but the disappoint
ments, although few, came with the more ex
pensive "Especiales de Mexico" meals The
steak and shrimp (yes, that is authentic Mexi
can fare) at $9.95 was palatable but not out
standing. The steak, ordered medium-rare
(with an accent on rare), arrived well-done
and looking somewhat prefabricated, despite
the menu's claims about "prime sirloin
steak." The shrimp, three large prawns, were
obviously frozen, and must have been that
way for some time.
In another "especiale" dinner, the red
snapper and crab at $7.25, the crab was also
clearly frozen, but not nearly as old-tasting as
the shrimp. Underneath the crab pilaf-of
sorts was a generous portion of red snapper.
Although this particular fish is known for a
characteristic fishy smell, even when
absolutely fresh, this particular portion was
variably dry and moist in spots, and seemed to
be past its prime. The vegetables and/or fresh
fruit served with the meals were indeed fresh
and quite tasty. The salad with the meal was
fresh, with a good mix of lettuce, tomato and
other garnishings. The soup of the day was an

interesting beef and lentil stock-based vegeta
ble soup, somewhat spicy, but overall quite
good
For dessert, the Mexican flan is a good but
very rich custard treat La Cumbre serves an
average-sized portion ot some merit. A real
treat that I have not seen at other Mexican
restaurants is the Kahlua mousse, served in a
tall parfait glass. There is also the usual as
sortment of "mundane" desserts, including
ice cream, cake and the like.
All in all, La Cumbre is a good place to get a
very filling and pleasing meal for a truly rea
sonable price. The service is quite good, quick
and attentive, but not hawkish or pushy. The
waiters and waitresses are knowledgeable
about the food they serve, and are willing to
help. The atmosphere is comfortable, not in
timate, but personal. (There is a strolling
guitarist serenading diners with Mexican mu
sic on Tuesday through Saturday, from 6 to 8
p.m., as well as a handmade "tortilla station"
at the same times.) Few eating estab
lishments in the Peninsula are able to provide
such an agreeable combination of economy,
portion and service. La Cumbre provides a
good place to enjoy a decent meal without sac
rificing your bank account. It certainly merits
a visit.

obviously frozen, and must have been that
way for some time.
In another "especiale" dinner, the red
snapper and crab at $7.25, the crab was also
clearly frozen, but not nearly as old-tasting as
the shrimp. Underneath the crab pilaf-of
sorts was a generous portion of red snapper.
Although this particular fish is known for a
characteristic fishy smell, even when
absolutely fresh, this particular portion was
variably dry and moist in spots, and seemed to
be past its prime. The vegetables and/or fresh
fruit served with the meals were indeed fresh
and quite tasty. The salad with the meal was
fresh, with a good mix of lettuce, tomato and
other garnishings. The soup of the day was an

interesting beef and lentil stock-based vegeta
ble soup, somewhat spicy, but overall quite
good
For dessert, the Mexican flan is a good but
very rich custard treat La Cumbre serves an
average-sized portion ot some merit. A real
treat that I have not seen at other Mexican
restaurants is the Kahlua mousse, served in a
tall parfait glass. There is also the usual as
sortment of "mundane" desserts, including
ice cream, cake and the like.
All in all, La Cumbre is a good place to get a
very filling and pleasing meal for a truly rea
sonable price. The service is quite good, quick
and attentive, but not hawkish or pushy. The
waiters and waitresses are knowledgeable
about the food they serve, and are willing to
help. The atmosphere is comfortable, not in
timate, but personal. (There is a strolling
guitarist serenading diners with Mexican mu
sic on Tuesday through Saturday, from 6 to 8
p.m., as well as a handmade "tortilla station"
at the same times.) Few eating estab
lishments in the Peninsula are able to provide
such an agreeable combination of economy,
portion and service. La Cumbre provides a
good place to enjoy a decent meal without sac
rificing your bank account. It certainly merits
a visit.

La Cumbre Mexican Restaurant
No. 2 Stanford Shopping Center

• Restaurants in large shopping malls gener
ally do not have to be outstanding. They have,
after all, a captive audience of sorts; few
Shoppers are willing to venture far just for a
meal. So I have come to assume that all mall
restaurants will be mediocre at best. La Cum
bre, at the Stanford Shopping Center, next to
Emporium-Capwell, is definitely an excep
tion to the rule. Having opened just 10 months
ago, La Cumbre has steadily gained in popu
larity, primarily because of its good,
authentic Mexican meals, attentive service
and reasonable prices.
The restaurant is open for both lunch and
dinner, and there is a separate bar and lounge
equipped with a giant-screen television. Hav
ing been to the restaurant twice, I would rec
ommend reservations for any time after 6
p.m., but they are not required. The at
mosphere is informal, as one would expect in
a shopping mall environment.
The best way to eat a healthy-sized meal at
a reasonable price would be to take advantage
of one of La Cumbre's daily specials. These
usually run from $5 to $7 and often include an
appetizer, soup or salad, dessert and some
times a complimentary drink. (The drinks

themselves are generous in size and strength
— I strongly recommend the bartender's
"special" margarita.) The cuisine is authen
tic and the portions are very large. An ap
petizer is really not necessary unless you are
either starved or training for the Olympic eat
ing team. However, if you are inclined to glut
tony, then the nachos are a delicious bargain
at $3.95 for a full order, and $1.95 for a half-or
der. A half order was nearly a meal in itself

for both myself and my guest.
Complete meals run from $5 to $10 per per
son. Meals include the main course, and either
soup or salad. Oddly enough, the best food
here is in the lower price categories, with the
chimichanga at $5.50 being a good meal for all
but the most voracious eater. If you are really
hungry, you might try a combination plate in
cluding refried beans, two beef enchiladas and
two tacos. When this is served as a special,

you get that, plus an appetizer, dessert and a
margarita for just $6.25 — certainly one of the
better food bargains in the area
It may be surprising, but the disappoint
ments, although few, came with the more ex
pensive "Especiales de Mexico" meals The
steak and shrimp (yes, that is authentic Mexi
can fare) at $9.95 was palatable but not out
standing. The steak, ordered medium-rare
(with an accent on rare), arrived well-done
and looking somewhat prefabricated, despite
the menu's claims about "prime sirloin
steak." The shrimp, three large prawns, were
obviously frozen, and must have been that
way for some time.
