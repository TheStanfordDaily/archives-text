.Spring in Paris. The streets are filled with
spoilers. The strollers stroll aimlessly. Aim
lessness ceases abruptly at 4 p.m. when the
cky's glaciers (icecream parlors) open.
Why is there no American rite of glacier
stfolling? Why don't American husbands ever
say "Gee, honey, why don't we take a nice
Wplk down El Camino, do some window-shop
ping at World of Dinettes, and then stop in at
SVensen's for some of your favorite Straw
berry Bubblegum Swirl?"
A sociologist will tell you that we don't
glqcier-stroll because we don't stroll period —
we drive. Ice cream snobs, however, will tell
you that they'd stroll in a minute if there was
anything around here worth strolling towards
tWe aren't ice cream snobs. Swensen's is
great. Bud's is great. Even the tacky pink and
brown of Baskin-Robbins is great. But we do
know good European ice cream when we taste
it, and having tasted it, we're inclined to side
with the ice cream snobs. We might walk a
mile for a Camel, but we wouldn't budge past
our bucket seats for a scoop of Rainbow

Sherbet.
Now to our rescue comes Bravo Fono, a
Euro-Californian cafe that opened up at the
Stanford Shopping Center seven months ago.
It's a little pretentious and its parentage is
dubious — it serves Italian ice cream, Vien
nese pastries, Hungarian soups, bread, and
wine, and even a token French croque
monsieur (a glorified grilled cheese sand
wich ) — but its still worth crossing every hid
eous inch of parking lot that it takes to get
there.
The interior of Bravo Fono is disco-deco.
There are wicker chairs, immaculate tiled
floors, walls of opaque glass, and walls of mir
ror. Espresso machines are shined to within

an inch of their lives. Waiters and waitresses
are wrapped in green aprons that almost —
but not quite — hide the polo players on their
shirts. High above the bar, neon tubes of light
coil around the contours of the walls Below,
vases of fresh flowers rest in strategically
mirrored corners.
Bravo Fono is obsessive about details.
Their ice cream machines were imported
from Italy. Their croque monsieur pans are
imported from France. Their ingredients
make separate, lonely trips from all over the
globe just to join the Bravo Fono ensemble —
the current worry is over how the Polish crisis
will affect the international supply of cassis

(blackberry* syrup.
Small wonder, then, that the prices are
ethereal With La Baguette selling its authen
tic boulangcne wares down the way. Bravo
Fono has stepped easily into the you'll-pay
for this-but-you'll-be-back ethos of Stanford
Shopping Center's gourmet stores
Bravo Fono's menu concentrates on des
serts. and so will you if you're wise. The
owners — Laszlo and Paulette Fono — also
run Paprikas Fono in Ghiradelli Square, re
putedly one of the best Hungarian restaurants
in the country. But the entrees are lackluster
here in Palo Alto; the best are wonderful puff
pastry shells, filled with unfortunately mun-

Dane meats and spinach that tastes sus J •
piciously frozen.
The dessert pastries, though, are great. The
tortes and cakes — especially those with choc
olate — are obscenely rich, and the strudel is
light enough to make a French pastry chef cry.
with envy. And the ice cream is smooth. '
sweet, and pure: gelato in the best Italian
tradition The mocha has flecks of coffee
bean, the rum raisin is alcoholic enough to
liver a slight buzz, and the amaretto captures
the subtle aura of almonds with aplomb. The
ices have ten times more flavor than Ameri-U
can sherbets, although the lemon ic£;
(sampled on a return visit) was a bit too full of
icy chunks — a sign of inconstant temperature
in the freezer. More picky comments , the ser
vice is slow, and for a restaurant that adores
details it's surprising that they put that de
licious ice cream in such ordinary cones. 1
If you want to pretend you're European,'
there's an outdoor patio for dining al fresco.
There's also take-out, with slightly lower
prices — and, of course, there's Stanford
Shopping Center, where, armed with a scoop >
