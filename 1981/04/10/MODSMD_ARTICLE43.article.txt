Beauty and the Heast ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean Cocteau wrote and
directed this version of the great
fairy tale, and it is lovely. The look
of the film is consciously styled af
ter Vermeer paintings, but the
tone, with its curious blend of re
ality and fantasy, is uniquely Coc
teau's.
The beast inhabits an enormous
palace, where the candles are held
by living, disembodied arms and
the walls, quite literally, have
ears. Nothing is quite as it seems
— Cocteau has reinterpreted the
real world to produce a universe
that is hauntingly his own. Josette
Day has been perfectly typecast as
Beauty, and Jean Marais, wearing
magnificent, amazingly ex
pressive makeup, is her Beast.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
Werner Herzog's Nosferatu.
— Jim Mattson
Coal Miner's Daughter
Palo Alto Square
A pretty terrific movie, made
that way by some great per
formances and by director
Michael Apted's eye tor telling de
tail. Country star Loretta Lynn's
rags-to-riches story is brought to
the screen with warmth and fine
humor. Even when, two-thirds of
the way through, the inevitable
heartbreak comes, the movie
glides through showbiz cliche and
comes out with its good nature in
tact.
Sissy Spacek portrays the
singer as if she and Lynn had been
best friends: her performance
suggests shared secrets and late
night soul searching. Tommy Lee
Jones and Beverly D'Angelo (as
Patsy Cline) turn in superb sup
porting performances.

Animal Crackers
Friday, Kresge
Groucho plays Jeffrey T.
Spaulding in this Marx brothers
farce. It is one of the earliest —
only The Cocoanuts predates it —
and derived from a stage play by
George S. Kaufman and Morrie
Ryskind. In other words, it isn't
one of their most inspired vehi
cles. But of course it must be
scene. With songs by Bert Kalmar
and Harry Ruby ("Hooray for
Captain Spaulding" and "Why Am
I So Romantic?"); featuring
Lillian Roth and the indispensable
Margaret Dumont. Victor
Heerman directed.
Double-billed with another
Marx brothers movie, Love Hap

Ordinary People **
Mountain View Theatre
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — they're
practicing catharsis by the num

bers Although it's about a family
in crisis, the movie never makes
you feel that you've really cap
tured the family's heart and soul
— its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Redford is better with
the actors; Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is especially good. With
Mary Tyler Moore and Donald
Sutherland.

The Great Sanlini **
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
An interesting, often wonderful
movie run aground by an ending
that renders pointless everything
that's come before. Robert Duvall
plays a Marine colonel who ac
cuses his wife of mollycoddling his
sons. He abuses his family in what
he thinks is their best interests,
and risks alienating them all in the
process. So much, so good . . . but
then those lousy last five minutes
go and screw everything up. You
might want to consider going out
for another tub of popcorn when it
becomes apparent that the mov
ie's drawing to a close.
Double-billed with loricate Ben
jamin.

9 to 5 *
Old Mill, Mountain View
One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about the revenge three abused
secretaries take on their
chauvinistic boss are quickly
smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy
with a take feminist gloss and a
Frank Capracorn ending. Lily
Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Dabney
Coleman salvage as much as they
can, but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance: trying to
play a woman of average in
telligence and to be light and funny
at the same time, she telegraphs
appallingly and gives us scenes of
classic female incompetence,
which surely cannot be what she
intended.

Dr. No
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The first of the James Bond
movies, at about a tenth of the cost
of the latest, Moonraker Sean
Connery more than makes up for
any possible deficiencies with his
typically suave performance in
this slyly well-made thriller. In
contrast to the latest Bond movies,
l)r No can at least claim to be wit
ty. Like all of the good Bond pic
tures, this one's a helluva lot of
fun.
Plays tomorrow night only with
another good Bond picture, Gold
finder.

The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less as it
does in the book, but the soul of the
work is gone.
Tess' centerpiece is Nastassia
Kinski. s lovely. Looking at
her, one can almost believe that
she could, without in the least in
tending to. drive men to do terrible
deeds. But, and this is a big but.
she has an accent It is difficult to
concentrate her character 's plight
when it sounds as if she spent sum
mers on the banks of the Rhine
The ultimate responsibility, ot
course, rests with director Roman
Polanski. Unable to render any
real, cinematic interpretation of
the novel, he contented himself
with dramatizing its "big mo
ments." What he forgot to do, or
what he was afraid to try, was to
offer any reason for seeing the
movie rather than staying home
and rereading the book.

The Postman 41 ways Rinfis
Twice *"*
Palo Alto Square
The newest version of James M.
Cain's taut, mean little potboiler,
starring Jack Nicholson and
Jessica Lange, has a convincing
period look, and the director, Bob
Rafelson, has done a good Job of
recreating a desolate, under
populated patch of rural Califor
nia. Oddly enough. Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist,-artd well heeled ,
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige — in
cluding the casting o' Jack Nich
olson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direction,
which seems to be telling us to
study carefully what requires no
more than a glance. For if you take
away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.

Altered Stairs *
Palo Alto Square
Altered States is the world's
first 70-millimeter, six-track ster
eo Looney Tune. It's brightly col
ored, wonderfully noisy, and utter
ly vacuous.
Ken Russell (Women in Love,
Tummy) directed; Paddy
Chayetsky (Network) wrote the
story and screenplay. This tale of a
man who turns into an ape
(honest) and does other colorful
things after he takes a rare drug
reflects the worst aspects of both
of its creators: from Russell it re
ceives pointless visual flam
boyance; from Chayefsky it gains
pointless philosophical dis
cussions ("What is man? When do
we eat?"). Its visuals, however,
are very pretty — the movie prac
tically begs you to stop thinking
long enough to enjoy them — and
the soundtrack ("Megasound") is
loud and creepy. It's amazing what
wonderful things one can do with
no ideas at all.

Willie Nelson plays a country

Schatzberg is very good with ac

Rauinti Hull is a great piece ot
moviemaking, and it is a pow
erhouse But on every level direc
tor Martin Scorsese throws ob
stacles in our path that prevent us
from becoming involved with the
film's characters. Scorsese and
star Robert De Niro have done
something very strange: they
have created a hero (based on the
life ot famous middleweight Jake
La Motta) who does not respond on
any level to our attempt to locate
him on the human scale: he is im
penetrable. Raninn Hull is all
about passion, yet in some ul
timate and important way the pas
sion never reaches us, even when
Jake's blood spatters the spec
tators at the last fight. As much as
I admire the film's technique, I
have to confess I don't like it very
much.

Private Henjamin **
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
A Goldie Hawn-production of a
Goldie Hawn star vehicle. The
movie is a big-budgeted Perils of
Goldie:'' Hawn plays a know-noth
ing rich girl who loses her hus
band, meets the reality of the
army, grows up, becomes inde
pendent thinking. Hawn's talents
are considerable, but she's lost
much of her perspective here —
many ot her best sequences are
pushed beyond the breaking point
Director Howard Zieft 112 Hearts vf

but he stumbles badly when the
movie takes a romantic turn.

On second thought, it's de

A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest) works in a rest
less. giddy fashion, he manages to
capture the timeless, rock'n'roll,
rebellious spirit ot the '60s and
makes it live again It's a romantic

even in those terms, Hair might

Thief + + +
Royal, San Francisco
Michael Mann, who is making
his commercial film debut with
Thief has a feeling for lonely
milieux and a juicy, trashy energy
Thief is a terrific pulp movie. It is
so fiercely kinetic (like the score
that Tangerine Dream performs
behind it) and so unerringly deft
that it seems to have been as
sembled unconsciously. This mov
ie has two of the most exciting —
and most instructive — heist
scenes I've ever encountered, if
Mann's career as a director ever
falters, he could make it as a safe
cracker.
But the picture belongs to star
James Caan In I'hief, his best
work to date, he plays Frank, a
diamond burglar who prides
himself on his expertise and his in
dependence; he speaks straight
and rejects the efforts of other
men to claim ownership of his ser
vices 'Thief may be urban
western junk, but it's highly
charged and beautifully made.

The Seven Farek oj Doctor Lao

Fox, Redwood City
Director George Pal started his
Hollywood career with a series of
short animated films — "Puppe
toons" — which placed wonder
fully designed wooden puppets in
strange situations. From these, he
went on to direct some of the best
special-effects movies produced in
the '50s and early '60s, ranging
from an adaptation of War of the
Worlds to the Cinerama feature
The Wonderful World of the
Brothers (irimm.
Pal's The Seven Faces of Doc
tor Lao stars Tony Randall as an
cient owner of a travelling circus.
Doctor Lao brings new life to a
stagnating western town — he
brings the gift of magic. Randall,
who gives a terrific performance,
plays seven characters, all of
whom have at least one foot (or, in
some cases, hoof) in the super
natural.
Plays Saturday through
Wednesday with Disney's The
Aristocats.
