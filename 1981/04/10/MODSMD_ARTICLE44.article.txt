Democrats propose new tax package
Washington — The chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee unveiled yesterday a tax package
which jettisons President Ronald Reagan's multiyear cuts
in favor of a onetime slash aimed at greater relief for low
and middle-income Americans
The administration promptly rejected the proposal
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan said the president
looked upon the plan, advanced by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski
(D-Ill.) as "less than half a loaf." He declared also that "a
one-year bill will not suffice to do the job that we want.
Claiming support from a majority of his panel,
Rostenkowski outlined a measure which includes a reduc
tion in the "marriage penalty"; a higher standard deduc
tion; a liberalized credit for poor working families, and
cuts in individual tax rates, especially for those with in
comes between $20,000 and $50,000 a year
Rostenkowski's proposal, also backed by the House
Democratic leadership, is for a permanent one-year tax
cut for individuals, rather than the 3 1 2-vear phased cut on
which Reagan has built his plan for economic revitaliza
tion. Business also would get a big tax reduction, but dif
ferent than under the president's plan.
US warns Japan of import quotas
Tokyo — A U.S. trade mission warned Japanese of
ficials yesterday that Congress might enact a bill impos
ing quotas on imports of Japanese autos. and Ambassador
Mike Mansfield urged Japan to "act in its own interest'' to
influence Congress not to pass such a bill.
Stephen Lande, an assistant trade representative and
head of the 10-man U.S. mission, said that three days of
briefings on U.S. auto industry troubles had been com
pleted without any negotiations on Japanese restraints on
exports of autos.
But the team left behind no doubt that the United States
expected Japan to act to curb exports.
Steve Saunders, a member of the U.S. mission, dis

closed that Lande had delivered letters from William
Brock, President Ronald Reagan's special trade repre
sentative, expressing "appreciation" for Japan"s de
clared intention to "solve the automobile question prior to
Prime Minister (Zenko) Suzuki's visit (to Washington) in
May."
Latest Atlanta victim found
Atlanta — The body of a black male was found yesterday
in an abandoned apartment building in Atlanta, where 22
other young blacks have been slain, and officials quickly
identified the victim as a retarded man who disappeared
last week.
Public Safety Commissioner Lee Brown said the body
was identified yesterday afternoon as that of 20-year-old
Larry Rogers.
Before his body was found, a task force on the slayings
had been seeking Rogers, last seen March 30 getting into a
station wagon.
Israeli Labor Party names Cabinet
Jerusalem— It the Labor Party should return to power
in Israel's June 30 election, Abba Eban will once again be
foreign minister but there will be no Cabinet job tor
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, party leader
Shimon Peres said yesterday.
Peres, the former minister of defense who is Labor's
candidate for prime minister, unveiled his shadow cabinet
at a press conference in Tel Aviv.
Rabin, long a Peres rival within the party, had sought
the defense ministry portfolio. But Peres named Haim
Bar Lev, a former army chief ot staff, for the job.
Peres edged Rabin in a bitter race for the prime min
ister nomination at the party's national convention in Jan
uary. The two men have scarcely been on speaking terms
for several years, but they met for an hour Wednesday. La
bor Party sources say that Peres told Rabin at that time
that he had no place in a future Peres-led Cabinet.
With a little less than three months to go before the elec

tion. public opinion polls show Labor with a substantial, al
though shrinking, lead over the Likud bloc of Prime Min
ister Menachem Begin.
Haig restates US support of Spain
Madrid — Secretary of State Alexander Haig spent
much of a 20-hour visit here trying to undo the impression
left by a brief comment he made in Washington during the
military coup attempt here Feb. 23
Haig, who told a reporter on first learning of the
abortive rebellion that it was "an internal matter," spent
much of Wednesday and yesterday reiterating U.S. sup
port for Spain's fledgling democracy. Haig's comment had
been interpreted here as proof of a callous and even an
tagonistic attitude toward Spanish democracy on the part
of the Reagan administration.
