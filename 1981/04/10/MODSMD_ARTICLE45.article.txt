# Col won't pay Liddy to speak
## 
### Bill Beyda 
The president of the Associated Stu
dents of the UC-Berkeley Senate Marc
Litchman this week vetoed a Senate
motion to bring convicted Watergate
burglar G. Gordon Liddy to speak on
the Berkeley campus.
"No one is denying him his right to
speak,"' Litchman said, ' but student
resources should not be used to help
him make a lot of money."
Oran Reznick, ASUC Press officer,
said a lot of Cal students were upset at
the $3000 price tag that Liddy would
have been paid for his speaking ap
pearance.
"We're the first campus to say no to
Liddy," Reznick said, "but if he wants
to come and speak for free, he's wel
come."
The incident raises questions as to
whether the ASSU would have acted
like the ASUC Senate had the issue of
Liddy being asked to speak at Stanford

been raised.
Keith Ogden, director of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, said the bureau re
cently voted on the matter, and de
cided that "we wouldn't spend student
money to bring someone to campus
whose notoriety was a result of his
criminal actions." Ogden felt that
some exceptions might be made it
someone had a lot to offer students
besides his or her criminal record.
Steve Richardson, who worked ac
tively with the Guest Professorship
Board to bring John Anderson to cam
pus. feels some Watergate con
spirators would have "a lot to offer
Stanford students through their varied
political backgrounds and ex
perience. ' In fact, Richardson says he
is going to write a Watergate con
spirator and try to bring him to Stan
ford.
Dick Butterfield. Guest Pro
tessorship board chairman, stressed

that Richardson's position was a "per
sonal one, and by no means the board's
official position.
"Any student can correspond with
someone personally and find out if
they would like to speak at Stanford,
and then submit it to the board for ap
proval." Butterfield said.
"However, if Steve does write to a
Watergate conspirator, it will not be
in the name of the board," Butterfield
said.
Butterfield said he approved of the
Berkeley decision, because he also
feels use of "student funds to support
criminals is inappropriate."
The ASSU Senate has no control
over one-time appearances arranged
by the Speaker's Bureau, SCOPE or
other campus groups, but the senate
has the final word on guest professors
since direct spending of student funds
is involved.
