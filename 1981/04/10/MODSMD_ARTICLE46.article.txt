# Student's death called suicide
## 
### 
Junior Steven Eastham Neff was
found dead of an apparent suicide in a
remote canyon in Big Sur, late Tues
day evening. Monterey County Cor
oner Harley Hillbun said yesterday.
Neff, a mechanical engineering ma
jor who had been stopped out since
Winter Quarter, apparently hiked into
Torey Canyon, inflated a rubber life
raft and shot himself, Hillbun said. He
left no note.
Neff s body was found by road work
ers who were clearing some land in the

canyon, Hillbun said. The body had ap
parently been there for more than a
week.
Identification cards found with the
body made identification fairly cer
tain. but final identification will be
made when the Coroner's Office can
check Neff's dental records, which
have yet to arrive. Hillbun said.
Although resident fellow Sally Cole
told a group of Loro residents last
night — where Neff had lived before
stopping out — that he had died of

"gunshot wounds," Hillbun said yes
terday that Neff's death was de
termined to be caused by one, self-in
flicted gunshot wound.
Cole's information came from a
sheriff's deputy who called the Uni
versity on Wednesday, Cole said.
"There is no evidence of violence or
foul play," Hillbun said. It is not
known when Neff was last seen.
Cole said police sources told her
Neft bought and registered the weap
on in San Mateo last month.
