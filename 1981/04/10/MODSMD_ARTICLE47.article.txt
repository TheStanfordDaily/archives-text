Clarification
The headline that ran over Tues
day's story about graduate student
stipends erroneously stated that Pres
ident Donald Kennedy said graduate
stipends would be cut. In fact, he told
the Academic Council that the Univer
sity can no longer offer complete fi

nancial support to Ph.D. students.
The Daily regrets the error.
Staff picnic
The Daily staff will excurse to a
Palo Alto park this Saturday at 2 p.m.,
sign up in the office and pick up a map.
Libations will be provided.
