## NATO ministers link recent Soviet aggression with arms control talks 
### Washington Post 
Bonn — North Atlantic Trea
ty Organization defense min
isters Wednesday for the first
time formally and unanimously
linked Soviet international be
havior to the start of arms con
trol negotiations.
In a precedent-breaking oral
statement that not only went
outside their fixed agenda but
also was unusual for its address
ing a current crisis, the 15 min
isters, meeting as the Nuclear
Planning Group, said that Sovi
et intervention in Poland
"would gravely undermine the
basis for effective arms control
negotiation."
The statement, which came a
day after Warsaw Pact ma
neuvers in and around Poland
reportedly ended, was ham
mered out only after much con
troversy. It served explicit no
tice that the alliance by no
means feels the Polish crisis is
at an end.
Excuse
At the same time, it gives the
Reajan administration another
excuse for putting off U.S.-Sovi
et talks on reducing the number
of short-range or tactical nucle
ar weapons in Europe, a subject
of considerable sensitivity for
the United States' European al
lies.
U.S. officials here hailed the
statement as a victory for Pres
ident Ronald Reagan's policy
on arms-control negotiations
with the Soviets.
NATO Secretary General
Joseph Luns, who read the
statement, told a press con
ference here that the ministers
were serving notice on the Sovi
ets that they, as well as Ameri
cans, were being held accoun
table for the future of arms con
trol talks.
"I feel very pleased that the
ministers have authorized the
secretary general to issue a
statement of the kind he just
read," Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger said at the
brief press conference following
this 29th planning group meet
ing.
"We have no hesitancy about
starting the talks." on reducing

so-called theater nuclear
forces, Weinberger added. "It is
a matter of having an at
mosphere that indicates the
talks would be effective."
Two-track negotiation
West German Foreign Min
ister Hans Apel noted that the
two-track approach of nego
tiating to reduce theater nucle
ar weapons and at the same
time planning to deploy new
ones was reaffirmed in the for
mal, written communique is
sued after the two-day meeting.
This is how the oral com
munique linked Soviet behavior
in Poland to arms control nego
tiations:
The defense ministers "noted
with great concern that the So
viet Union for the past weeks
has been engaged in increasing
ly menacing troop movements
and other threatening activities
around Poland.
"The ministers stated that
actual intervention, including
the use or the threat of use of
military force, are incom
patible with the professed Sovi
et desire for peace and disarma
ment and are inconsistent with
the Helsinki Final Act and the
United Nations Charter."
Serious threat
Recalling the statements of
the defense and foreign min
isters in December 1980, they
reaffirmed that any Soviet mili
tary intervention would pose a
serious threat to security and
stability and would have pro
found implications for all
aspects of East-West relations.
"In particular, we agree that
the Soviets would gravely un
dermine the basis for effective
arms control negotiations if
they were to intervene in the in
ternal affairs of Poland. Poland
should be free to decide her own
future."
The back-room debates in
drafting that statement were
fierce at times, according to
NATO officials who declined to
be identified. However, one U.S.
official said that the United
States came in with several for
mulations but ended up with one
that achieved the two primary
American objectives.

The first, he said, was to link
Soviet behavior in Poland to the
future of arms control talks.
The second, he continued, was
to keep the planned mod
ernization of the theater nuclear
arsenal in Europe on schedule.
The United States intends to add
Tomahawk land-based cruise
missiles and Pershing II bat
tlefield rockets to its theater
forces in Europe.
Weinberger noted at another
point in the press conference
that the communique recom
mitted the NATO alliance to
deploying the new theater nu
clear weapons on schedule.
The communique stated that
"ministers emphasized that
NATO will move ahead with its
planned schedule of long-range
theater nuclear force mod
ernization while at the same
time making efforts to reach
balanced, equitable and veri
fiable arms control agreements
limiting such forces as was de
cided on Dec. 12,1979.
Formal communique
The defense ministers in the
formal communique also:
• Expressed regret that the
Soviets have stepped up their
deployment of the SS-20 in
termediate-range missile. The
minister said 220 of them have
been deployed. 20 more than
previous estimates of the three
warhead missile. Previously.
NATO officials have said two
thirds of the SS-20s have been
aimed at NATO countries in Eu
rope.
• Supported "all steps neces
sary to ensure an adequate bal
ance" of U.S. and Soviet
strategic forces. No mention
was made in the communique or
in the press conference of conti
nuing the commitment of NATO
nations to increase their de
fense budgets by at least 3 per
cent a year after allowing for in
flation. The Carter adminis
tration considered this commit
ment its major achievement in
NATO, while several countries
felt such a figure was mislead
ing, if not an insult, to their mili
tary efforts.
• Rejected the Soviet pro
posal to declare a moratorium

on theater nuclear weapons, de
claring this did not address "the
fundamental problems caused
by the buildup of Soviet arms."
The two-day Nuclear Plan
ning Group meeting that ended
Wednesday was Weinberger s
first. Several European defense
ministers gave him high marks
for his sensitivity to European
concern, although one German
official said that "we deserve
special consideration because
we are on the firing line." Many
German officials are anxious to
obtain a fixed date tor opening
U.S.-Soviet talks on reducing
theater nuclear weapons.

U.S. officials here hailed the
statement as a victory for Pres
ident Ronald Reagan's policy
on arms-control negotiations
with the Soviets.
NATO Secretary General
Joseph Luns, who read the
statement, told a press con
ference here that the ministers
were serving notice on the Sovi
ets that they, as well as Ameri
cans, were being held accoun
table for the future of arms con
trol talks.
"I feel very pleased that the
ministers have authorized the
secretary general to issue a
statement of the kind he just
read," Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger said at the
brief press conference following
this 29th planning group meet
ing.
"We have no hesitancy about
starting the talks." on reducing

so-called theater nuclear
forces, Weinberger added. "It is
a matter of having an at
mosphere that indicates the
talks would be effective."
Two-track negotiation
West German Foreign Min
ister Hans Apel noted that the
two-track approach of nego
tiating to reduce theater nucle
ar weapons and at the same
time planning to deploy new
ones was reaffirmed in the for
mal, written communique is
sued after the two-day meeting.
This is how the oral com
munique linked Soviet behavior
in Poland to arms control nego
tiations:
The defense ministers "noted
with great concern that the So
viet Union for the past weeks
has been engaged in increasing
ly menacing troop movements
and other threatening activities
around Poland.
"The ministers stated that
actual intervention, including
the use or the threat of use of
military force, are incom
patible with the professed Sovi
et desire for peace and disarma
ment and are inconsistent with
the Helsinki Final Act and the
United Nations Charter."
Serious threat
Recalling the statements of
the defense and foreign min
isters in December 1980, they
reaffirmed that any Soviet mili
tary intervention would pose a
serious threat to security and
stability and would have pro
found implications for all
aspects of East-West relations.
"In particular, we agree that
the Soviets would gravely un
dermine the basis for effective
arms control negotiations if
they were to intervene in the in
ternal affairs of Poland. Poland
should be free to decide her own
future."
The back-room debates in
drafting that statement were
fierce at times, according to
NATO officials who declined to
be identified. However, one U.S.
official said that the United
States came in with several for
mulations but ended up with one
that achieved the two primary
American objectives.

The first, he said, was to link
Soviet behavior in Poland to the
future of arms control talks.
The second, he continued, was
to keep the planned mod
ernization of the theater nuclear
arsenal in Europe on schedule.
The United States intends to add
Tomahawk land-based cruise
missiles and Pershing II bat
tlefield rockets to its theater
forces in Europe.
Weinberger noted at another
point in the press conference
that the communique recom
mitted the NATO alliance to
deploying the new theater nu
clear weapons on schedule.
The communique stated that
"ministers emphasized that
NATO will move ahead with its
planned schedule of long-range
theater nuclear force mod
ernization while at the same
time making efforts to reach
balanced, equitable and veri
fiable arms control agreements
limiting such forces as was de
cided on Dec. 12,1979.
Formal communique
The defense ministers in the
formal communique also:
• Expressed regret that the
Soviets have stepped up their
deployment of the SS-20 in
termediate-range missile. The
minister said 220 of them have
been deployed. 20 more than
previous estimates of the three
warhead missile. Previously.
NATO officials have said two
thirds of the SS-20s have been
aimed at NATO countries in Eu
rope.
• Supported "all steps neces
sary to ensure an adequate bal
ance" of U.S. and Soviet
strategic forces. No mention
was made in the communique or
in the press conference of conti
nuing the commitment of NATO
nations to increase their de
fense budgets by at least 3 per
cent a year after allowing for in
flation. The Carter adminis
tration considered this commit
ment its major achievement in
NATO, while several countries
felt such a figure was mislead
ing, if not an insult, to their mili
tary efforts.
• Rejected the Soviet pro
posal to declare a moratorium

on theater nuclear weapons, de
claring this did not address "the
fundamental problems caused
by the buildup of Soviet arms."
The two-day Nuclear Plan
ning Group meeting that ended
Wednesday was Weinberger s
first. Several European defense
ministers gave him high marks
for his sensitivity to European
concern, although one German
official said that "we deserve
special consideration because
we are on the firing line." Many
German officials are anxious to
obtain a fixed date tor opening
U.S.-Soviet talks on reducing
theater nuclear weapons.
Bonn — North Atlantic Trea
ty Organization defense min
isters Wednesday for the first
time formally and unanimously
linked Soviet international be
havior to the start of arms con

In a precedent-breaking oral
statement that not only went
outside their fixed agenda but
also was unusual for its address
ing a current crisis, the 15 min
isters, meeting as the Nuclear
Planning Group, said that Sovi
et intervention in Poland
"would gravely undermine the
basis for effective arms control
negotiation."
The statement, which came a
day after Warsaw Pact ma
neuvers in and around Poland
reportedly ended, was ham
mered out only after much con
troversy. It served explicit no
tice that the alliance by no
means feels the Polish crisis is
at an end.
