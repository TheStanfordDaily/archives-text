# Asks for $4 billion loan to finance work
## China reverses policy again; gives go-ahead to Japanese plants 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo — China, reversing itself
again on economic policy, has informed
Tokyo it will go ahead with four huge
plant contracts it had made and can
celed with Japan.
But the Chinese government simul
taneously has asked for a whopping $4
billion loan from Japan, which it ap
parently hopes to use to revive work on
the four major petrochemical plants it
had ordered suspended only a few
months ago.
Japanese officials Wednesday de
scribed a loan of that size as impossible
to grant. "That is an incredible fig
ure," said one official.
Government baffled
The latest development in China has
left the government here baffled by the
sharp swings in Chinese economic poli
cy. It has been encouraged by the de

cision not to cancel the industrial
projects and the promise to pay
Japanese businessmen for what has
been delivered so far.
But it is not clear how China plans to
raise the money it wants. So far. China
has not said that it must have the large
Japanese loan to revive the projects
and Japan is assuming that the two are
not necessarily linked.
Preliminary negotiations are sched
uled to begin in Tokyo this week with
the major decisions to be made later
this month when Chinese Vice Premier
Gu Mu arrives.
Crucial
The talks are crucial for China be
cause the four petrochemical plants
and one steel plant are the core of Chi
na's vast modernization program.
They also are vital to the long-term ec
onomic relations between the twocoun

tries.
Beginning in mid-January, the Chi
nese government made a series of an
nouncements stating that four
petrochemical plants and part of a steel
plant already under construction would
be canceled. This represented a dra
matic switch in policy after officials
concluded that China was investing too
much in heavy industry and that such
huge investments were contributing to
inflation.
At first, there was no talk of com
pensating Japanese firms for the can
celed contracts, and alarmed busi
nessmen here suddenly began talking
of pulling out of other planned con
tracts with Beijing.
Later, China said it would com
pensate the Japanese businessmen ac
cording to "accepted international
standards," but it was never clear how
much that would mean.

Last weekend, however, Chinese of
ficials notified a group of Japanese
businessmen and the Japanese Em
bassy that they now wish to revive
almost all of the projects. They simul
taneously let it be known that they hope
for a large infusion of Japanese yen
credits and long-term, low-interest
loans to finance the revival. The figure
of $2 billion was mentioned in Beijing
but Japanese officials here say the total
really amounts to $4 billion for the
petrochemical plants. Three-fourths of
it apparently would be used for the lo
cal construction work and the remain
ing $1 billion would be for foreign cur
rency to pay tor purchases of materials
and equipment shipped by Japanese
firms to build the projects.
No precedent on loans
Besides the sheer size of the request,
officials here point out there is no pre
cedent for using Japan's economic co

operation loans to finance local con
struction work. To grant it in China's
case, they said, would prompt South
east Asian nations to seek equal treat
ment.
"I do not know what they know about
the Japanese system, but it is simply
not possible — especially the $3 billion
fur local costs," an official said
Wednesday. "Perhaps we can do a lit
tle for them through the Export-Import
Bank." No formal Japanese govern
ment reaction has been decided yet, he
added.
The official said that so far China is
discussing the loan request as an item
separate from the plan to revive the
contracts. "But I am sure that they are
wistfully thinking that they will get
help from Japan. So far, they are
saying that they would continue (on the
once-canceled contracts) at their own
expense," he added.

But it is not clear how China plans to
raise the money it wants. So far. China
has not said that it must have the large
Japanese loan to revive the projects
and Japan is assuming that the two are
not necessarily linked.
Preliminary negotiations are sched
uled to begin in Tokyo this week with
the major decisions to be made later
this month when Chinese Vice Premier
Gu Mu arrives.
Crucial
The talks are crucial for China be
cause the four petrochemical plants
and one steel plant are the core of Chi
na's vast modernization program.
They also are vital to the long-term ec
onomic relations between the twocoun

tries.
Beginning in mid-January, the Chi
nese government made a series of an
nouncements stating that four
petrochemical plants and part of a steel
plant already under construction would
be canceled. This represented a dra
matic switch in policy after officials
concluded that China was investing too
much in heavy industry and that such
huge investments were contributing to
inflation.
At first, there was no talk of com
pensating Japanese firms for the can
celed contracts, and alarmed busi
nessmen here suddenly began talking
of pulling out of other planned con
tracts with Beijing.
Later, China said it would com
pensate the Japanese businessmen ac
cording to "accepted international
standards," but it was never clear how
much that would mean.

Last weekend, however, Chinese of
ficials notified a group of Japanese
businessmen and the Japanese Em
bassy that they now wish to revive
almost all of the projects. They simul
taneously let it be known that they hope
for a large infusion of Japanese yen
credits and long-term, low-interest
loans to finance the revival. The figure
of $2 billion was mentioned in Beijing
but Japanese officials here say the total
really amounts to $4 billion for the
petrochemical plants. Three-fourths of
it apparently would be used for the lo
cal construction work and the remain
ing $1 billion would be for foreign cur
rency to pay tor purchases of materials
and equipment shipped by Japanese
firms to build the projects.
No precedent on loans
Besides the sheer size of the request,
officials here point out there is no pre
cedent for using Japan's economic co

operation loans to finance local con
struction work. To grant it in China's
case, they said, would prompt South
east Asian nations to seek equal treat
ment.
"I do not know what they know about
the Japanese system, but it is simply
not possible — especially the $3 billion
fur local costs," an official said
Wednesday. "Perhaps we can do a lit
tle for them through the Export-Import
Bank." No formal Japanese govern
ment reaction has been decided yet, he
added.
The official said that so far China is
discussing the loan request as an item
separate from the plan to revive the
contracts. "But I am sure that they are
wistfully thinking that they will get
help from Japan. So far, they are
saying that they would continue (on the
once-canceled contracts) at their own
expense," he added.
