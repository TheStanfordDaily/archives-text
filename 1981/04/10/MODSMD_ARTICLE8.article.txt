# Common Market vetoes French-Soviet grain deal
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Strasbourg, France — The
European Common Market has
effectively banned a planned ex
port sale by France of 600,000
tons of wheat to the Soviet
Union.
The sale, which would have
been subsidized by Common
Market taxpayers, caused great
controversy in other European
countries and in the United
States because it was proposed
at a time of continuing uncer
tainty about a possible Soviet in
vasion of Poland.
It had been expected that the
Common Market Commission,
which has the power to refuse
authorization of such deals,
would defer a decision in order
not to provoke a row with the
French government just weeks
before the French presidential
election. But at its meeting late
Wednesday night the com
mission ruled that there was no

economic justification for the
proposed wheat export.
The commission softened the
blow to the French government
by giving assurances that it
would find alternative markets
for the subsidized export of the
surplus wheat. Commission of
ficials are confident that most if
not all of the 600,000 tons will be
sold to North African and Medi
terranean countries but that if
this proves insufficient special
subsidies will be paid for the
sale of the wheat for animal fod
der.
Whatever the economic rea
sons for halting the planned
wheat deal it is clear that the
commission's motives were
also political. Although French
officials claimed that they had
been given the green light for
the wheat it seems that the U.S.
administration as a whole was
angered by what it saw as a

highly contentious violation of
the European commitment to
support the U.S. grain embargo
to the Soviet Union introduced
after the invasion of Afghan
istan.
According to the ground rules
for the embargo — which allow
only "traditional" trade levels
to be maintained — the Common
Market has already exported
the permitted amount of 200,000
tons of wheat to Russia this
year. Given the commission's
refusal of the export subsidies
needed for the Soviet deal and
the political opposition of the
other Common Market coun
tries there seems no way it can
now be carried out.
However, French govern
ment sources yesterday were
clearly put out by the per
emptory way in which the com
mission had ruled out the pro
posed Soviet wheat contract.
They pointed out that a number
of major wheat-exporting coun
tries, such as Argentina, had
blatantly ignored the U.S. em
bargo while others such as Aus
tralia and Canada still exported
substantial quantities of grain
to Russia.
