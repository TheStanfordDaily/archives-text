Prague, Czechoslovakia (AP)
— The Poles' southern neigh
bors in Czechoslovakia have
been told that they, too, are
threatened with shortages and
other economic difficulties.
But unlike the new leaders of
the Polish Communist Party,
the Czechoslovak leaders in
stalled by the Soviet army in
1968 say they don't plan any ma
jor changes.
Party leader Gustav Husak
told the Czechoslovak Com
munist Party Congress that po
litical and economic policies
adopted after the 1968 Warsaw
Pact invasion remain valid.
"It was not necessary to
change anything in this political
line and we have not been de
flected from it by anything," he
declared.

However, Husak's three-hour
speech included repeated sig
nals that his economically trou
bled country faces difficult
times.
He said prices will continue to
be strictly controlled, but he
hinted they might increase. He
said wages "must be most
closely tied to growth in labor
productivity, effectiveness,
economy and quality of work."
He said the party would pay
more attention to the production
of consumer goods. But he
warned that it would be increas
ingly difficult to pay tor im
ported agricultural products
and food.
The party chief also hinted
that construction of nuclear
power plants has fallen behind
schedule. He said meeting the
goals set for the coal mines of
North Bohemia would take "ex
traordinary efforts."
While Czechoslovakia's econ
omy is struggling with officially
conceded inefficiencies, the
government has been widely
praised for its cautious borrow
ing policies.
"We cannot live on capital for
any length of time and do not
want and will not live on cred
it," he said in an apparent slap
at Poland's crippling $27 billion
debt to Western banks and gov
ernments.
