# Delt house smokes, faculty home burns
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
Two separate fires provided a
charred and soggy surprise for some
campus residents yesterday, but
while a faculty home suffered $100,000
in property damages, the presence of
fire sprinklers in the Delta Tau Delta
house limited damages there to about
$1000. There were no injuries in either
fire.
Both Stanford Linear Accelerator
physicist David Coward and most of
the members of the Delt fraternity re
turned home late yesterday to find
their homes smoky and wet as a result
of the two fires which burned almost
simultaneously around noon.
Two children playing in Howard's
one-story home at 828 Pine Hill Road
heard a noise in the attic, went outside
and discovered flames on the roof.
Howard's son Andrew, 14, and
Kraig Meyer, also 14. said they heard
crackling noises and thought it was a
mouse. The boys ran up the street,
pulled a fire alarm box and then re
turned to the house and telephoned the
fire department at 11:55 a.m. Two en
gines. two salvage units and a medic
unit were sent to contain the blaze.
Captain Pat Crady of the Palo Alto
Fire Department said the fire was
probably caused by some electrical
problem. It began, he guessed, in the
attic area over the kitchen but soon
spread across the roof.
"It had been cooking up there for a
while," Crady said, adding that the
fire may have been burning for as long
as five or six hours before it was dis
covered. Firefighters were thwarted
in trying to limit the blaze's damage
and clean up the charred embers by a
broken water line which they had trou
ble shutting off.
Finally the Palo Alto utility com
pany was called to help the approx
imately 11 firefighters shut off the wa
ter. Crady estimated damage to the
Coward home at at least $100,000,
much of it caused by water.
Mrs. Coward, a nurse at the Medical
Center, said she and the boys had been
up since about 4 a.m. watching the
launch of the space shuttle. She left for

work about 6:30 a.m. Mr. Coward was
expected home from a Boy Scout cam
ping trip last night.
"Luckily no one was hurt. If the
boys hadn't been home I think the dog
would have been burned, too." Mrs.
Coward said.
Amazingly composed, she laughed
with Crady about her son's judgment
in pulling the alarm and then calling
the fire department. "You didn't
teach him very much," she said (Mrs.
Coward is a scout leader too. and for
years has taken children to Crady for
advice on how they should react in
case of fire).
Meanwhile, the fire at the Delts
began in senior Bernard Hagan's
third-floor room shortly after noon. It
was quickly extinguished, however,
by a fire sprinkler in the room. The
sprinklers were installed in every
room of the house last summer,
prompted bv a 1980 study on fire safe
ty.
"It likely saved the house." said one
fireman working in the room.
Although water damage to Hagan's
room was fairly extensive and also af
fected the two floors below, damage
will likely not exceed $1000, according
to Captain Robert Gillespie of the Palo
Alto Fire Department.
Gillespie said the fire was probably
caused by a cigarette left smoking on
the couch earlier in the day. Fire
fighter Gary Moore said they could not
determine whether it was a tobacco or
marijuana cigarette — "both para
phernalia were there," he said.
Most of the Delts were in San Fran
cisco attending a Giants baseball
game and returned in the late after
noon to find other house residents, who
had stayed home, cleaning the house.
Fortunately, the water which
seeped down to the first floor did not
damage several thousand dollars
worth of acoustical equipment which
was left in the Delt lounge from a rush
party Saturday evening.
Gillespie said one engine responded
to the alarm, which was activated by
the sprinkler device.
