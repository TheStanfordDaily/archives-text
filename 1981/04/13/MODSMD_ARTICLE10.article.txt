## Reagan feels 'great', watches shuttle launch 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington â€” President Ronald Rea
gan, secluded with his family at the
White House, watched the launching of
the space shuttle on television yesterday
and declared: "It's a spectacular sight."
A day after he was discharged from
George Washington University Hospital,
the president's staff made a "hard and
fast" decision to leave him alone as he
continues to recuperate from the bullet
wound in his left lung.
Reagan arose about 10 minutes before
the shuttle launch and was visited by his
personal physician. Dr. Daniel Ruge. He
spent the day watching television and
reading briefing papers.
Reagan, smiling broadly but walking
stiffly, left the hospital to return to the
White House Saturday, 12 days after the
nation's heart skipped a beat as Ameri
cans saw Reagan struck by a bullet that
pierced his left lung.
Reagan said he felt "great" as he

walked out of George Washington Uni
versity Hospital at 10:44 a.m. EST with
Nancy Reagan holding his right arm and
his younger daughter, Patti Davis, hold
ing his left.
"What are you going to do when you
get home?" a reporter asked.
"Sit down," the president replied.
Doctors released Reagan after an X
ray taken Saturday morning showed the
remaining trace of the bullet wound in
his lung looking much improved. "We
are quite comfortable letting him go
home today," Dr. Dennis O'Leary, a hos
pital spokesman, said.
Although doctors have been impressed
by the rapidity of the 70-year-old Rea
gan's recovery, they say that he will not
be able to work in the Oval Office for at
least a week and should not travel for
several weeks.
"He's in great shape," Ruge said
through Speakes. "He looks great." Rea
gan was taking penicillin orally to ward

off infection in the lung wound he in
curred during an attempt on his life
March 30.
Nevertheless, aides were reluctant to
disturb the president, whose only compa
nions were his wife, Nancy and daughter.
Patti.
"No one from the staff has seen him
since he went into the elevator yester
day," Speakes said. "There was a con
scious decision on the part of the senior
staff yesterday that once he went into
that elevator to leave him alone and give
him some time with his family."
Reagan's doctors had advised him not
to work in the Oval Office for a week and
not to travel for several weeks. Speakes
said the president probably would spend
most of the coming week in the second
floor living quarters in the Executive
Mansion.
The only scheduled visitors were Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig, who was
likely to drop by today or Tuesday to re

port on his nine-day trip to Europe and
the Middle East, and Reagan's top three
economic aides. Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan, David Stockman, direc
tor of the Office of Management and
Budget, and Murray Weidenbaum, chair
man of the Council of Economic Ad
visers.
In addition, Speakes said the Reagan
may call individual congressmen "to get
a feel for" the prospects in Congress for
his economic program.
To a large extent, Speakes said, the
president will follow the same routine he
used at George Washington University
Hospital. His top three aides, Edwin
Meese; James Baker and Michael De
aver will visit him in the morning "to dis
cuss whatever matters come up," and
his national security briefing will be in
written form.
Vice President George Bush will con
tinue to stand in for Reagan at official
White House functions.
