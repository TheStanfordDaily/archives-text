# Bush assures blacks of federal fairness

### Washington Post 
Tuskegee, Ala. â€” Pinch-hitting for President Ronald Reagan on a
tough assignment, Vice President George Bush yesterday assured a
skeptical black audience that the Reagan administration would not
abandon the federal commitment to "equal justice under law."
In a speech to a Founder's Day observance at Tuskegee Institute,
cradle of black education in the South, Bush frankly acknowledged
that black Americans are doubtful about the extent of the Reagan
administration's commitment to protecting the political, social and
economic rights of minorities.
"These doubts just aren't right: they're totally unfounded," Bush
said. "President Reagan cares deeply about the lives and live
lihoods, the safety and security, of all Americans regardless of
race, sex, color or creed. "
This declaration was received in silence. But the predominantly
black audience warmed up and applauded moments later, when
Bush repeated the administration commitment to equal justice.
"And we will not tolerate or condone the irresponsible actions of
those who would deprive black and minority Americans of their
right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as envisioned by
our country's founding fathers," he said.
Bush also was applauded when he promised the Reagan adminis
tration would continue to value the role of black colleges and "do
what is necessary to assure that the cultural and educational
heritage represented by Tuskegee and America's black institutions
of higher learning will be preserved and strengthened. ..."
But there was practically no applause for the central message the
vice president brought to Tuskegee: the now-familiar Reagan
gospel that government spending must be cut back in favor of pro
grams that spring from the private sector.
