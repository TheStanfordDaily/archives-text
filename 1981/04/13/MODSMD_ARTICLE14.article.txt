# U.S. joins in renewed space race
## 
### 
Cape Canaveral, Fla.
lAF) — The United States
has rejoined the space race.
The last time Americans
were in space, it was a joint
mission with the Soviet
Union. Since then, 43 cos
monauts have been launched
into orbit. Two have been
afloat in space since last
March.
Now, the Soviets are not
alone.
Columbia's successful
launch ends a six-year
drought in the U.S. man-in
space program and signals
this nation's intention to re
gain eminence in a domain it
once dominated with the
man-on-the-moon missions.
Since the dawn of the
space age, the world's two
superpowers have used that
arena as a symbol of national
power. The renewed race
will focus heavily on military
superiority.
Americans on sidelines
With American astronauts
on the sidelines since 1975,
the Soviets have wrested
away every endurance rec
ord once held bv the Ameri
cans. The latest pair has
been aloft in a small station
for a month and they may
stay up more than half a

year.
The flight of John Young
and Robert Crippen, slated
for just over two days, seems
slight in comparison The big
edge for the U.S. is Colum
bia.
Columbia, says Young, is
light-years ahead of the Sovi
et spaceships.
Defense emphasized
The shuttles will carry up
satellites and space labora
tories for military, scientific
and commercial projects,
with heavy emphasis on de
fense flights as the Pentagon
moves to counter what it con
siders a growing Russian
threat from space. The craft
is the size of a jetliner and
can ferry up as many as sev
en persons and 32 tons of
cargo in its 60-foot-long bay.
U.S. observers say the
Russians are developing a
shuttle vehicle but they be
lieve it is much smaller than
Columbia and perhaps 10
years behind
Columbia initiated the
third decade of manned
space flight — roaring into
orbit on the 20th anniversary
of the historic orbital flight
of Soviet cosmonaut Yuri
Gagarin, on April 12,1961.
