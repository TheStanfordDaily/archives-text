## Thanks for political masturbation 
### 
"Dear Anthony:
Your very nice letter was received in my
office, and I certainly appreciate hearing
from you. It is good of you to take the time to
say thank you. I wish you well in your en
deavors, and, again, thank you for taking
the time to write to me. Sincerely. Marian
W. La Follette. 38th District. California As
sembly."
Dear Marian:
Your very nice letter was received in my
post office box. and I certainly appreciate
hearing from you. The Post Office folks usu
ally do what they can to keep my box
scrupulously clean, and it is good of you to
sneak your appreciation past them. I wish
you well in your endeavors, and. again,
thank you for taking the time to write to me.
But one question, Assemblywoman. What
did I do to deserve this? I didn't write you a
letter. You didn't "hear" anything from me
except my name and address, which cer
tainly didn't take me any time. In fact, the
real message wasn't even one of thanks, but
I hope you already realized that. All the
same, glad to hear from you — at least one
of us is writing letters. Sincerely. Tony.
Of course, I'm not being entirely fair, for
I did do one thing to attract Marian La
Follette's form-letter attention. A short
while back I received a card from the Finan
cial Aids Office urging me to sign a "Pro
clamation of Appreciation" for a state
scholarship program that helps me to go
here. Not being one to argue about scholar
ships, I signed the petition intended to go to
my assembly representative, as did lots of
others in the same situation. At that time, it
seemed fairly innocent — but now. with the
presence (I hesitate to say "benefit") of

hindsight. I find myself caught in an all-too
typical flurry of routine politics, a game
that became paradoxically more disturbing
in its insignificance.
The main feature of this disturbance is
the fact that I was barely involved in the
whole exchange. The intention of the Finan
cial Aids office in rounding up Proclama
tions of Appreciation was not to give thanks,
but to send a message of political clout. It
just so happened that the California As
sembly was considering cutting some funds
off the same state scholarship program that
we were sending our humble thanks to them
for. You don't need Calc 43 to put two and
two together to figure out the real intent,
then, of our petitions.
Indeed, the fact that the Financial Aids
office felt compelled to write a petition and
get us to sign it. instead of informing us and
letting us write our own letters, implies that
what we had to say as individual recipients
wasn't important, so just sign and forget
about it. It is more efficient, and probably
more effective politically, but it's not com
forting to see the Financial Aids office dis
guising their intents and engaging in tradi
tional lobbyist politics.
Of course. Assemblywoman La Follete's
job is politics. But her response is still un
settling. for it is so dripping with political
values that the value of the issue is lost. This
sort of form-letter appreciation is not only
purely hypothetical but is is meaningless in
its own right too. Her response cannot give
any consideration to my opinions, for I
didn't write any — the Financial Aids office
did. Accordingly. La Follette also avoids
saying how she feels, or what is being done
about the issue of state scholarships. The

only reason the letter was written was that
somebody felt it should be written. But it
shouldn't be written, or there should be
some evidence that someone cares about
the writing. It's too much, and it's not
enough.
I bet you're wondering how I could get so
worked up about a form letter. Well, maybe
it's a problem of my previous complacency.
I mean, it's always been hard to knock the
Financial Aids office for their intents — af
ter all. they do give me money to go here,
and I do have a slight emotional attachment
to eating. Therefore, maybe I should grant
them the chance to cover their tails and lob
by the Assembly for as much money as pos
sible. I suppose Assemblywoman La
Follette was just following politics-as-usual
in her reply, which I imagine was echoed by
the reply letters sent to anyone who signed a
Proclamation of Appeciation.
But if I can't complain against the Finan
cial Aids office because they give me mon
ey. then they had best show the same
priorities. Their autocratic uses of our ap
preciation lead me to believe that they don't
necessarily share my views — or worse, are
abusing their position to achieve political
ends. And the very fact that this mean
ingless communication is accepted to easily
as the status quo shows the extent of the
problem. Yes. it is accepted. Yes. it is the
way things are done. But it is also a game —
a political masturbation that ignores the
true issue. As it is, I have no idea what I re
ally accomplished by signing a Pro
clamaiton of Appreciation. But I've got a
letter of thanks. Thanks for nothing.
