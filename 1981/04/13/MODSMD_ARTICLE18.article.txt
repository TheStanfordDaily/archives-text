## Winter in Congress a unique experience 
### 
I feel like I left another life.
Working, eating and sleeping
there seemed so natural. Now I
am back at school, again lead
ing the life of a confused under
graduate. Stopping out was well
worth it.
Now that I am no longer gain
fully employed by the Hon
orable Congressman X, per
spective has a way of setting in.
Thinking back on Washington,
parallel images of ancient
Rome come to mind: "I came, I
saw. I conquered, and who is in
charge here?" — Caesar's
theme, with an addition by A 1
Haig; "Rome wasn't built in a
day" — Reagan's call for na
tional sacrifice to mend our eco
nomic woes; and "S.P.Q.R." —
that classical city's motto,
translated in Washington to
DOE, ICC, MC, HOB. USDA,
USGA, DOD, DO A. SOB. and
other acronyms of bureaucracy,
which is Washington's motto.
People there live for govern
ment like people here live for
academics. Both places also in
clude high quantities of drink
ing. At times I felt as if I hadn't
stopped out. but had gone to an
other version of fantasyland.
Like Stanford. Washington can
at times be extremely isolated,
but why fight the feeling?
The foundation of my job was
writing letters. 200 constituents
wrote the Congressman each
day, and each letter has to be re
turned. Does it do any good to
write your Congressman? Yes
and no.
In volume, letters can have an
impact. About 80 percent of the
letters we received approved of
Reagan's economic plan, so the
Congressman knows voting for
the plan will not hurt him in the
district. The 20 percent who
didn't like the cuts were forced
to lump it.

But some of the letters are
more obscure, and usually more
fun to answer. Take the
"nut." as the Congressman
himself put it. who ordered leg
islation introduced to disband
the Department of Defense. He
got a stiff letter in return. Or the
lady who was intensely para
noid about the increased num
bers of Asian people she noticed
infiltrating her suburban shop
ping center. She got a "nice"
letter plus information on U.S.
immigration statistics.
One telegram left no course of
further action: "Support the
President and don't send us one
of your double-talk letters ex
plaining your position." Signed
Mr. and Mrs. Fed-Up-With-
Junk-Mail.
From my vantage point, in
Congress I was able to see a lit
tle of the true workings of Wash
ington. Most of a Con
gressman's opinions come from
the sources in Washington —
committee hearings, dis
cussions with colleagues, and
information from close ad
visers. The philosophy is shaped
by his constituents, but the fine
tuning is done on his own.
The simplicity of the get
elected-write bills-vote system
as described in history texts can
be misleading. Congressmen
have so many demands on their
time that there is no way they
can oversee the entire operation
of the office They spend a lot of
time reading legislation, draft
ing bills, signing letters, meet
ing with constituents, and even
such trivial things as actually
voting on the House floor. Some
studies show that a Con
gressman has only 18 minutes a
week to think. Statistics like
that mean that he has to sur
round himself with a staff that
will perform unguarded and

when they have free time, get a
little creativity into their jobs.
For that reason, much of the
Congressman's life depends on
others. The staff does much of
the thought work, and that way
can actually take initiatives to
shape policy. The adminis
trative assistant in our office
wanted the Congressman to get
an auto-pen. The Congressman
does not like the idea, but when
he looks down the road and sees
piles of letters to sign, and those
piles only seem to be getting big
ger. he has to succumb to the
A.A.'s plan. This type of thing
can go on at any level. The result
is that the job of Congressman,
though perceived as a one-man
task, is actually well-defined
teamwork. The key is getting
good players on the team. As an
intern, I was about fourth
string.
Congressmen in general seem
to be a mixed lot. There are
those that have an affinity for
washrooms, and those that have
an affinity for tireless work.
What surprised me was the av
erage personalities of most of
the members. None of them
were born to be Congressmen.
Some even wear leisure suits.
The majority of them take their
jobs very seriously, but only
about 75 of the 435 seem to be
destined to be remembered by
history We tend to forget that,
after all. they are only govern
ment employees.
My career as a staff member
for the Congressman was mix
ed. I never did get involved in a
sex scandal, though many at
tempts were made. Neither is
there legislation with my name
on it. though there have already
been over 4000 bills introduced
in this session of Congress Of
that number, there may be 300

new ideas, a couple hundred
bills for grants for buildings in
various Congressman's dis
tricts, and 3500 variations of
common themes: tax laws, reg
ulations, and policy changes.
Would I go back? In a minute.
If DC can becompared to Rome,
allow me to make another
analogy: People, in the Roman
tradition, love to fiddle while
the city burns. If America is in a
mess, government is sure hav
ing a good time putting things
back together.
And despite all the bad PR
government gets. America does
have something to be proud of.
We have a great institution,
founded on solid principles. We
have the freedom to act and
make our own laws, and there is
that flicker of the beacon of
hope shining on our shores (mu
sic please). From my ex
perience I have realized that
almost anything is possible if we
want it done, and if we have the
time. We have the chance to ex
periment, to test and to act as
we feel. That's pretty rare in
this world. As Reagan said, we
have a basic reason to hope,
"for after all, we are Ameri
cans."
Working in government af
firms my belief in the American
system, not so much for what it
is, but for what it can be. There
is along way to go until per
fection is reached, but at least
we hve the material to continue
to forge ahead.
