Guest Professorship Bd.-Yes
The ASSU Guest Professorship Board
was established in the late '60s in order to
bring to campus lecturers with new per
spectives on politics, science, the arts,
and society at large. Though successful in
past years in bringing names like Angela
Davis and Daniel Ellsberg to Stanford, the
Board has never had successes to match
this spring.
Guided by an almost entirely new mem
bership this year, the board has invited
minority lobbyist Andre Burnett, environ
mentalist David Brower and former con
gressman John Anderson. For the first
time in the board's history, two of the
courses this spring are accredited through
a regular University department rather
than just Undergraduate Specials or
SWOPSI — Brower's through Human
Biology and Anderson's through Political
Science.
In the future, the Board hopes to invite
guest professors during fall and winter
quarters as well as spring.
Club Sports Council — Yes
Stanford's club sports program serves
more than 1300 students and provides op
portunities for student participation in ac
tivities which either do not have varsity
sport status and are thereby given support
directly from the university, or are not
competitive sports (like karate or dance).
While Athletic Department support for
Club Sports has increased in the past cou
ple of years, the need still exists for a fee
assessment.
Volunteers in Asia — No
Although the Vounteers in Asia program

provides a worthwhile service and in
troduction to a part of the world about
which the University is perhaps lacking in
awareness, the fact remains that annually
the program involves only about 45 people.
Currently we feel the base of the group
is simply too narrow to justify a campus
wide fee assessment. VIA avoids solic
iting funds from the government or multi
national corporations, but we fear this
may actually be the only way for the pro
gram to continue and build.
Program Fee — Yes
We feel the ASSU program fee provides
funding for groups on campus with no
where else to turn, and does so careful
ly.We distinguish between the Program
Fee and the Academic Organizations
Board in our endorsements because of the
methods the groups use to determine who
gets how much money. While the ASSU,
which allocates Program Fee funds, has
demonstrated that it has a clear view of its
role and of its obligations to the student
body in its allotment of funds, the AOB did
not.
Academic Organizations Bd.
-No
Because it is not clear that even the
AOB itself knows why it exists or to what
purposes the funds it distributes are put,
we feel a fee assessment at this time is un
wise. Conceivably this group could com
bine forces with the Program Fee board
and present a structured, responsible
group to help out groups which tend to
"fall through the cracks."
