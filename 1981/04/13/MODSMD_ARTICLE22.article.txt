Rod Beckstrom
Beckstrom expresses a strong concern
for bringing the senate back to the juris
diction where it can, and is designed to,
have its greatest effect — campus issues.
Beckstrom sees a need to examine and im
prove the ASSU itself before taking a
great deal of senate time debating in
ternational issues better left to ASSU
sponsored programs, like the ASSU forum
on El Salvador last week.
Major concerns include:
— The effectiveness of ASSU services,
especially those that chronically lose
money — perhaps an indication that stu
dents do not need those services.
— Concert promotion by a full-time pro
fessional, such as a promoter offering to
assume the full risk in return for a share in
the profits.
— More faculty/student interaction. He
proposes a plan to provide free meals in
dorms for professors.
We believe Beckstrom has a commit
ment to the issues important to the stu
dent community, the primary function of
the ASSU Senate.
Roc Blumenthal
Blumenthal is by far the candidate most
in touch with the role of the senate.
Through his extensive ASSU experience,
Blumenthal has acquired a very practical
understanding of the limitations on the
senate as an advisory rather than legisla
tive body within the University. His pro
posals reflect a realization.that the senate
cannot tell anyone in the administration
what to do, but can serve to collect student
input and make valuable recommenda
tions to the powers that be.
Major concerns include:
— Senate communication with and ac
countability to the student body. He pro
poses to distribute a quarterly newsletter
to the student body to inform students
about what's going on.
— Evaluation of student services to see
if new ones are desirable and how effec
tive the present ones are.
Rick Naimark
Naimark offers a valuable prospective
driving force to the senate. Only a
freshman, Naimark has credentials to
match most upperclass candidates and en
thusiasm to outshine them. In his one year
on campus he has served on several ASSU
committees and task forces and has at
tended every senate meeting — a record
matched by few current senators.

Major concerns include:
— Bringing concerts back to campus un
der the most feasible arrangement,
whether ASSU sponsored or not.
— Increased student input into Univer
sity processes such as grading policies.
— Refinement of the ASSU structure.
Despite his freshman status, Naimark
also shows a sensitivity to the special con
cerns of graduate students — a point rare
ly considered by undergraduates.
Although the Daily supports the following
senate candidates less strongly than it did the
previous three, we still believe that they are
superior to other undergraduate candidates
and that they deserve your vote this Wednes
day and Thursday.
Jordan Bender — A sophomore active in
community affairs like the Big Brother/Little
Brother program. Bender offers viable ideas
to promote campus unity through social affairs
like a University-wide talent show or other
events in Frost Amphitheater. He also sup
ports the improvement of campus lighting, and
bringing back campus concerts.
Andy Benn — Benn. a junior pre-med major
ing in biology, is running on a ticket with Tom
Kohn, whom the Daily also endorses. Benn
speaks reasonably of improving campus prob
lems in lighting, contemporary entertainment
and the student union.
Jon Blum — A freshman, Blum is a re
markably energetic and articulate candidate
who supports a more visible, receptive, and ac
countable senate. Although he is running on a
two-person slate, the Daily has chosen to en
dorse him alone, as he definitely represents
the more dominant and capable half of the
ticket.
Mark Epstein — Although Epstein, a junior,
appears to be running as a joke candidate (his
posters show him posing in a Mafioso-like cos
tume) he is obviously serious in his mission to
reform and improve the ASSU Senate. Perhaps
his highly-opinionated personality is just the
sort that will keep senate debate lively and pro
voke creative ideas and programs.
Tom Kohn — Kohn, already mentioned
above, is a sophomore who offers innovative
ideas about improving faculty/student rela
tions at Stanford. To do this, he favors im
provement of the advising and resident fellow
systems.
Adam Newar — A sophomore who has
worked with the ASSU Speakers Bureau, New
ar is both informed and opinionated about cam
pus issues like improved lighting. He also sup
ports the renovation of Encina Station to pro
vide a pleasant on-campus site for student so
cial life.
Mike Rielly — Rielly, an extremely well-in
formed freshman, offers concrete proposals
for improvements in campus life. As co-chair
man of the Student-Alumni Network, he sup
ports increased interaction between the two
groups. Rielly also supports the creation of a
student-run book exchange.

reform and improve the ASSU Senate. Perhaps
his highly-opinionated personality is just the
sort that will keep senate debate lively and pro
voke creative ideas and programs.
Tom Kohn — Kohn, already mentioned
above, is a sophomore who offers innovative
ideas about improving faculty/student rela
tions at Stanford. To do this, he favors im
provement of the advising and resident fellow
systems.
Adam Newar — A sophomore who has
worked with the ASSU Speakers Bureau, New
ar is both informed and opinionated about cam
pus issues like improved lighting. He also sup
ports the renovation of Encina Station to pro
vide a pleasant on-campus site for student so
cial life.
Mike Rielly — Rielly, an extremely well-in
formed freshman, offers concrete proposals
for improvements in campus life. As co-chair
man of the Student-Alumni Network, he sup
ports increased interaction between the two
groups. Rielly also supports the creation of a
student-run book exchange.
Rod Beckstrom
Beckstrom expresses a strong concern
for bringing the senate back to the juris
diction where it can, and is designed to,
have its greatest effect — campus issues.
Beckstrom sees a need to examine and im
prove the ASSU itself before taking a
great deal of senate time debating in
ternational issues better left to ASSU
sponsored programs, like the ASSU forum
on El Salvador last week.
Major concerns include:
— The effectiveness of ASSU services,
especially those that chronically lose
money — perhaps an indication that stu
dents do not need those services.
— Concert promotion by a full-time pro
fessional, such as a promoter offering to
assume the full risk in return for a share in
the profits.
— More faculty/student interaction. He
proposes a plan to provide free meals in
dorms for professors.
We believe Beckstrom has a commit
ment to the issues important to the stu
dent community, the primary function of
the ASSU Senate.
Roc Blumenthal
Blumenthal is by far the candidate most
in touch with the role of the senate.
Through his extensive ASSU experience,
Blumenthal has acquired a very practical
understanding of the limitations on the
senate as an advisory rather than legisla
tive body within the University. His pro
posals reflect a realization.that the senate
cannot tell anyone in the administration
what to do, but can serve to collect student
input and make valuable recommenda
tions to the powers that be.
Major concerns include:
— Senate communication with and ac
countability to the student body. He pro
poses to distribute a quarterly newsletter
to the student body to inform students
about what's going on.
— Evaluation of student services to see
if new ones are desirable and how effec
tive the present ones are.
Rick Naimark
Naimark offers a valuable prospective
driving force to the senate. Only a
freshman, Naimark has credentials to
match most upperclass candidates and en
thusiasm to outshine them. In his one year
on campus he has served on several ASSU
committees and task forces and has at
tended every senate meeting — a record
matched by few current senators.

Major concerns include:
— Bringing concerts back to campus un
der the most feasible arrangement,
whether ASSU sponsored or not.
— Increased student input into Univer
sity processes such as grading policies.
— Refinement of the ASSU structure.
Despite his freshman status, Naimark
also shows a sensitivity to the special con
cerns of graduate students — a point rare
ly considered by undergraduates.
Although the Daily supports the following
senate candidates less strongly than it did the
previous three, we still believe that they are
superior to other undergraduate candidates
and that they deserve your vote this Wednes
day and Thursday.
Jordan Bender — A sophomore active in
community affairs like the Big Brother/Little
Brother program. Bender offers viable ideas
to promote campus unity through social affairs
like a University-wide talent show or other
events in Frost Amphitheater. He also sup
ports the improvement of campus lighting, and
bringing back campus concerts.
Andy Benn — Benn. a junior pre-med major
ing in biology, is running on a ticket with Tom
Kohn, whom the Daily also endorses. Benn
speaks reasonably of improving campus prob
lems in lighting, contemporary entertainment
and the student union.
Jon Blum — A freshman, Blum is a re
markably energetic and articulate candidate
who supports a more visible, receptive, and ac
countable senate. Although he is running on a
two-person slate, the Daily has chosen to en
dorse him alone, as he definitely represents
the more dominant and capable half of the
ticket.
Mark Epstein — Although Epstein, a junior,
appears to be running as a joke candidate (his
posters show him posing in a Mafioso-like cos
tume) he is obviously serious in his mission to
reform and improve the ASSU Senate. Perhaps
his highly-opinionated personality is just the
sort that will keep senate debate lively and pro
