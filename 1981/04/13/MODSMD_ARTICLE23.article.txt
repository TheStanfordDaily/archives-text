RESUME
The RESUME slate humbly
requests your vote for Senior
Class Presidents on April 15 and
16. We are Frank Hicks. Ann
Cuthbertson, Clarissa Clayton,
and Jon Staenberg. This com
bination anacronymizes to
HACKS, (as with aspiring politi
cal). We feel the RESUME label
(Recalcitrant Epicureans Seek
ing Undeserved Meritorious
Eclat) more accurately de
scribes our objectives.
We are deeply concerned with
issues such as feminism, gay
rights. El Salvador, the Poland
workers, environmental dilem
mas, and nuclear disarmament,
as well as with issues closer to
home, such as the Stanford
clerical workers' struggle, ra

cial discrimination in hiring
practices on .campus, and
energy conservation.
If elected, we will press for
programs such as Senior happy
hours at the Gloworm, casino
nights, sherry hours and mixers
with influential faculty and
alumni, reserved seating for
seniors at football games, and
senior class trips to Tahoe. If
you think this sounds amazing,
just wait until Winter and
Spring quarters!
JJAM
Julie Johnson, Jerry
Cromack, Alicia Moore, and
Mark Deife are running for Sen
ior Class Presidents. Our defini
tion of the duties of Sr. Class
Presidents is;

1. fa-cil-i-tate (112 -sil'a-tat).
To free from obstacles; make
easier; aid; assist. As in, facil
itate interaction between sen
iors (on and off campus), facul
ty, and alumni.
2. in-e-bri-ate (in-e'bre-at').
To exhilarate or stupefy with or
as if with alcohol; imbibe; face;
get keyed . . . need we say
more?
3. rec-re-ate (rek're-at'). To
impart fresh life to; refresh
mentally or physically . . . e.g.
via organizing senior ex
cursions. road trips, and adven
tures.
4. mo-ti-vate (mo't -vat'). To
stimulate to action; incite. As
in, motivate the class of'B2 to in
sure that our last year is the
best!
5. grad-u-ate (graj'oo-at'h
Our duty as Presidents is to
make graduation, from class
day activities through commen
cement the culmination of a

great 4 years.
In addition to the traditional
Senior activities, our slate
would like to initiate some new
traditions. We would like to kick
off Fall quarter with a Sr. Cable
Car Bash in the City Mixing fun
with business, how about snag
ging a brew and a job before Big
Game at the Senior Alum
tailgater?
Also on our Fall quarter agen
da is a Senior Poll to formulate a
list of potential commencement
speakers. Winter quarter could
begin with a Senior Tahoe Blow
out. When you're not skiing the
slopes, you could practice gam
bling for the traditional Sr.
Casino Night.
Watch a Spring sunrise over
the Farm while indulging in
bagels and booze at the Senior
Sunrise Party. Also in the works
for next Spring is the Senior
Swill. Of course, we'll continue
Pub nights, Zot's runs, Sr.

Brunches, to name a few of the
old favorites.
We're not running as a slate to
build our resumes, to promise
parties that never materialize,
nor to present a clone per
sepective on senior activities.
Our slate, like our senior class,
includes a variety of back
grounds and interests. We will
"tap" the senior class for good
times and memories!
THE GANG
Are you excited by spontane
ous grunion hunts and kiosk-div
ing 9 Are you apathetic and in
need of a slate that isn't so to
plan your senior activities? Are
you not apathetic but rather
concerned about having three
responsible and exciting people
plus Peter Frost as your Senior
Class Presidents? If so, join
THE GANG! Peter Frost. Lisa
Cetlin, Kevin Aoyama and
Hilary Hall are THE GANG
slate.
We all have experinece in
creating and coordinating vari
ous activities. Three of us
helped organize such Junior
class events as the ice cream
study break and Encina pub
nights.
As members of the Student
Alumni Network, we have also
been involved in the develop
ment of programs for greater
student interaction with alum
ni.
Two of us have been social
chairpersons and one of us is a
former dorm president. We
have also been active in such
community and school service
projects as Dollies and the Big
Brother program. Through such
committments we have demon
strated our dedication, willing
ness to assume responsibility
and ability to work with others.
We feel that senior class pres
idents are elected to help make
the senior year memorable
while easing the transition from
the undergraduate world.
We will provide speakers and
informational programs on such
practical issues as career op
portunities, housing and taxes.
We will also sponsor programs
where seniors spend time with
alumni in their chosen field and
have opportunities to form con

tacts with alumni at the em
ployment hiring level.
We realize that the senior
class has extensive social needs
as well We will provide a great
number of well-coordinated,
highly publicized social events
to unify the class, allow seniors
to make new friends and provide
a healthy (who said "intox
icated 0 ") reprieve from
academia.
The casino night, halloween
party, traditional pub nights and
Zot's and "0" runs will con
tinue, but we will purpose new
traditions such as beach parties,
ski outings, and deleterious gru
nion hunts.
Our slate will strive to get the
senior class involved in the or
ganization of all activities. We
will be accessible with office
hours, committee meetings and
suggestion boxes.
You may even feel free to
harass us in the early morning
hours if your ideas demand im
mediate consideration. (Just
don't call Frost — he never an
swers his phone.)
We will circulate a senior
newsletter, provide a recorded
telephone hotline, and make
sure that all senior events are
well-publicized.
But the most important thing
about THE GANG is that we are
committed. (Of course Frost
was committed long ago.) The
four of us are reliable, hard
working individuals dedicated
to doing a great job.
We work well together, are
easy to approach and have the
necessary ability to com
municate with others.
We take our responsibilities
seriously, but we are also
creative, fun and excellent
partiers.
We look forward to planning
social events, but we want to
stress that senior class officers
are more than just party or
ganizers. THE GANG wants to
help prepare seniors for life af
ter Stanford and make ac
cessible to them the valuable re
sources of our alumni and facul
ty.
(Peter Frost is majoring in polit
ical science; Lisa Cetlin in in
ternational relations; Kevin
Aoyama in economics, and

out. When you're not skiing the
slopes, you could practice gam
bling for the traditional Sr.
Casino Night.
Watch a Spring sunrise over
the Farm while indulging in
bagels and booze at the Senior
Sunrise Party. Also in the works
for next Spring is the Senior
Swill. Of course, we'll continue
Pub nights, Zot's runs, Sr.

Brunches, to name a few of the
old favorites.
We're not running as a slate to
build our resumes, to promise
parties that never materialize,
nor to present a clone per
sepective on senior activities.
Our slate, like our senior class,
includes a variety of back
grounds and interests. We will
"tap" the senior class for good
times and memories!
THE GANG
Are you excited by spontane
ous grunion hunts and kiosk-div
ing 9 Are you apathetic and in
need of a slate that isn't so to
plan your senior activities? Are
you not apathetic but rather
concerned about having three
responsible and exciting people
plus Peter Frost as your Senior
Class Presidents? If so, join
THE GANG! Peter Frost. Lisa
Cetlin, Kevin Aoyama and
Hilary Hall are THE GANG
slate.
We all have experinece in
creating and coordinating vari
ous activities. Three of us
helped organize such Junior
class events as the ice cream
study break and Encina pub
nights.
As members of the Student
Alumni Network, we have also
been involved in the develop
ment of programs for greater
student interaction with alum
ni.
Two of us have been social
chairpersons and one of us is a
former dorm president. We
have also been active in such
community and school service
projects as Dollies and the Big
Brother program. Through such
committments we have demon
strated our dedication, willing
ness to assume responsibility
and ability to work with others.
We feel that senior class pres
idents are elected to help make
the senior year memorable
while easing the transition from
the undergraduate world.
We will provide speakers and
informational programs on such
practical issues as career op
portunities, housing and taxes.
We will also sponsor programs
where seniors spend time with
alumni in their chosen field and
have opportunities to form con

tacts with alumni at the em
ployment hiring level.
We realize that the senior
class has extensive social needs
as well We will provide a great
number of well-coordinated,
highly publicized social events
to unify the class, allow seniors
to make new friends and provide
a healthy (who said "intox
icated 0 ") reprieve from
academia.
The casino night, halloween
party, traditional pub nights and
Zot's and "0" runs will con
tinue, but we will purpose new
traditions such as beach parties,
ski outings, and deleterious gru
nion hunts.
Our slate will strive to get the
senior class involved in the or
ganization of all activities. We
will be accessible with office
hours, committee meetings and
suggestion boxes.
You may even feel free to
harass us in the early morning
hours if your ideas demand im
mediate consideration. (Just
don't call Frost — he never an
swers his phone.)
We will circulate a senior
newsletter, provide a recorded
telephone hotline, and make
sure that all senior events are
well-publicized.
But the most important thing
about THE GANG is that we are
committed. (Of course Frost
was committed long ago.) The
four of us are reliable, hard
working individuals dedicated
to doing a great job.
We work well together, are
easy to approach and have the
necessary ability to com
municate with others.
We take our responsibilities
seriously, but we are also
creative, fun and excellent
partiers.
We look forward to planning
social events, but we want to
stress that senior class officers
are more than just party or
ganizers. THE GANG wants to
help prepare seniors for life af
ter Stanford and make ac
cessible to them the valuable re
sources of our alumni and facul
ty.

RESUME
The RESUME slate humbly
requests your vote for Senior
Class Presidents on April 15 and
16. We are Frank Hicks. Ann
Cuthbertson, Clarissa Clayton,
and Jon Staenberg. This com
bination anacronymizes to
HACKS, (as with aspiring politi
cal). We feel the RESUME label
(Recalcitrant Epicureans Seek
ing Undeserved Meritorious
Eclat) more accurately de
scribes our objectives.
We are deeply concerned with
issues such as feminism, gay
rights. El Salvador, the Poland
workers, environmental dilem
mas, and nuclear disarmament,
as well as with issues closer to
home, such as the Stanford
clerical workers' struggle, ra

cial discrimination in hiring
practices on .campus, and
energy conservation.
If elected, we will press for
programs such as Senior happy
hours at the Gloworm, casino
nights, sherry hours and mixers
with influential faculty and
alumni, reserved seating for
seniors at football games, and
senior class trips to Tahoe. If
you think this sounds amazing,
just wait until Winter and
Spring quarters!

ganization of all activities. We
will be accessible with office
hours, committee meetings and
suggestion boxes.
You may even feel free to
harass us in the early morning
hours if your ideas demand im
mediate consideration. (Just
don't call Frost — he never an
swers his phone.)
We will circulate a senior
newsletter, provide a recorded
telephone hotline, and make
sure that all senior events are
well-publicized.
But the most important thing
about THE GANG is that we are
committed. (Of course Frost
was committed long ago.) The
four of us are reliable, hard
working individuals dedicated
to doing a great job.
We work well together, are
easy to approach and have the
necessary ability to com
municate with others.
We take our responsibilities
seriously, but we are also
creative, fun and excellent
partiers.
We look forward to planning
social events, but we want to
stress that senior class officers
are more than just party or
ganizers. THE GANG wants to
help prepare seniors for life af
ter Stanford and make ac
cessible to them the valuable re
sources of our alumni and facul
ty.
(Peter Frost is majoring in polit
ical science; Lisa Cetlin in in
ternational relations; Kevin
Aoyama in economics, and
