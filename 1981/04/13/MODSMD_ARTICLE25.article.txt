One of the biggest problems
of the environmental movement
has been its lack of ability to
reach the majority. This is a
time when environmental is
sues are being alienated from
the public interest by economic
and many other issues. This
problem is being perpetuated in
guest professor David Brower's
class, Earth Island; Getting
from Here to 2001. Though many
members of the Stanford com
munity would like to attend his
lectures, the class has been lim
ited to a mere 85 students. The
rest of the people who may have
environmental concerns have
been shut out.
It seems to me that this prac
tice goes against the grain of the
entire philosophy of the class.
The many are being excluded in
order to pamper a few with bet
ter participation opportunities.
Environmentalists are sup
posedly concerned with the
quality of life for the many, and
oppose the profits ot the tew at a
cost fo everyone else.
So why is this course in prac
tice a contradiction to the en
vironmentalist approach? What
good does it do to have a well
known environmentalist like

David Brower come to Stanford
and lecture only to a select few
who are probably aware of
many of the issues already?
Where is the progress in that?
In order to survive and suc
ceed, the environmental move
ment is going to have to make
itself relevant to all people. In
separating itself from the public
interest, it may wither and die.
The sponsors of David Brower's
class have already started out
on the wrong toot by excluding
so many people who want to be
come aware of environmental
issues.
