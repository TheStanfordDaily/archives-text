# Take first step toward No. 1
## Racketeers fend off USC,UCLA 
### Ivan Maisel 
When UCLA's diving Marcel
Freeman netted his backhand
Saturday night, giving Tim
Mayotte the win and Stanford an
unbeatable edge against the
Bruins, a roar went up from the
approximately 6000 fans in
Maples Pavilion. And nobody
was roaring louder than Stan
ford coach Dick Gould.
The 6-3 win over the Bruins,
when coupled with Friday's 7-2
win over USC. made Gould's
Cards the temporary tenants of
collegiate tennis' penthouse,
with a 10-0 record. The scores,
however, belie how close Stan
ford came to moving into the
outhouse.
Take the afternoon portion of
Saturday's match, played at
Stanford Tennis Stadium. You
can find it in the card catalog
under tennis comma intense.
Every match went three sets,
and the finish was the most im
probable of all.
UCLA (15-29) had taken a 3-2
lead and the only unfinished
match was on the No. 3 court,
where the third doubles match
was going into its third hour.
Mike Falberg and Jeff Arons of
Stanford won the opener 7-5,
while Freeman and Jacques
Manset won the second set 6-3.
The Cards had the edge in the
final set on two occasions, but
made UCLA pin them to the
back fence before winning.
• Stanford got an early service
break, allowing Falberg to
serve for the match at 5-3.
UCLA broke them quickly. OK.
give Falberg-Arons three break

points in the next game, then
watch UCLA win all three.
The momentum shifted to
Freeman and Manset When
they took a 4-1 lead in the subse
quent nine-point tiebreaker,
with Freeman serving the last
three points. Dick Gould's lips
pursed tighter than Jack Ben
ny's wallet. The Bruins needed
one point to take a 4-2 lead into
the night portion of the match.
They never got it. Uncanny
net play by both Falberg and
Arons moved Stanford to 4-all in
the tiebreak. then Falberg's
blistering return set up Arons
for a smash. If he hadn't hit
Manset in the chest, the ball
would have been three feet out.
It did. it wasn't, and the match
was tied.
"When you're down 4-1 and
they have the last three serves,
there's maybe one-in-a-hundred
chances of winning," an amazed
Arons said. When you're down
4-2 in team play, you don't have
many more chances than that,
either Not only did Arons and
Falberg put Stanford back in the
match, they gave the Cards the
psychological edge for the night
matches.
"There's quite a bit of dif
ference," UCLA coach Glenn
Bassett said after the un
believable finish "It's pretty
easy getting one match com
pared to two. Besides. Stan
ford's strength is at the top."
Bassett proved to be a
prophet. Mayotte and Scott
Davis, big hitters ex
traordinaire. had no major trou
ble with Freeman and Blaine
Willenborg respectively. The

"carpet." as the indoor court is
known, is faster than the greens
at Augusta National In other
words, made-to-order for serve
and-vollevers, the game Stan
ford's one-two punch fancies.
"It was definitely suited for
Tim." said Freeman, a 6-3, 6-4
loser "I can serve and volley,
but Tim does it better than me. I
feel that I would do much better
on a slower outdoor surface.
This was one-shot tennis."
"When I'm serving that well
on that court." Mayotte said,
"it's difficult for anybody to re
turn," noting that it was the
same surface on which he de
feated Jimmv Connors last fall.
The win was especially satis
fying for Mayotte. who had
played less-than-super tennis all
weekend. Friday he defeated
Billy Nealon of USC in three un
inspired sets, before becoming
the second left foot on the danc
ing doubles team of he and Jim
Gurfein Saturday against
UCLA's Willenborg and John
Davis. The Bruins won in three
sets. 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
"I was pretty disappointed af
ter this afternoon. I had been
playing mediocre tennis. Walk
ing over here (to Maples) I said
to myself. 'Things have to
change,' " Mayotte said.
One guy who hopes things
never change is Falberg. The
freshman didn't lose a match all
weekend at No. 5 singles and in
third doubles with Arons. Fri
day he devastated USC's Jim
Agate 6-1, 64 before teaming
with Arons to beat Agate and
Jack Kruger in doubles 6-1.6-2.
"Agate is normally very

tenacious, but I think Falberg
just overpowered him." USC
coach Dick Leach said. "I
thought he would be in the top
four."
Saturday the Santa Barbara
native faced John Davis, a
nemesis since the two were in
12-vear-old juniors. The two
cannon-like servers boomed
salvos at each other all after
noon. with Falberg's service re
turns the difference in a 6-3.3-6.
6-1 decision.
UCLA's Davis, a high school
teammate of Scott Davis, said
Falberg wasn't playing any dif
ferently than he has in the past.
"He was pretty much the same.
He played well the third set."
the loser said. "He just beat
me."
Other highlights for the Cards
were Gurfein's 7-6 (5-3), 4-6, 6-3
win over UCLA's Robbie
Venter, and the doubles play of
Davis and Scott Bondurant at
first doubles. They outlasted
Nealon and Roger Knapp of USC
6-2, 2-6, 6-4 before icing the win
ning cake Saturday with a 7-5,
7-6 (5-3) win over Venter and
Dan Saltz. That was sweet re
venge for Bondurant, who had
suffered his first loss of the year
to Saltz Saturday afternoon in
three sets.
Stanford faces UC-Irvine
tomorrow afternoon here at
1:30, and will do so without
Davis, who got a "wild card" in
vitation into the $175,000 Jack
Kramer Open in Los Angeles
this week. One can only assume
he will be back for the Arizona
and Arizona State matches this
weekend.

for a smash. If he hadn't hit
Manset in the chest, the ball
would have been three feet out.
It did. it wasn't, and the match
was tied.
"When you're down 4-1 and
they have the last three serves,
there's maybe one-in-a-hundred
chances of winning," an amazed
Arons said. When you're down
4-2 in team play, you don't have
many more chances than that,
either Not only did Arons and
Falberg put Stanford back in the
match, they gave the Cards the
psychological edge for the night
matches.
"There's quite a bit of dif
ference," UCLA coach Glenn
Bassett said after the un
believable finish "It's pretty
easy getting one match com
pared to two. Besides. Stan
ford's strength is at the top."
Bassett proved to be a
prophet. Mayotte and Scott
Davis, big hitters ex
traordinaire. had no major trou
ble with Freeman and Blaine
Willenborg respectively. The

"carpet." as the indoor court is
known, is faster than the greens
at Augusta National In other
words, made-to-order for serve
and-vollevers, the game Stan
ford's one-two punch fancies.
"It was definitely suited for
Tim." said Freeman, a 6-3, 6-4
loser "I can serve and volley,
but Tim does it better than me. I
feel that I would do much better
on a slower outdoor surface.
This was one-shot tennis."
"When I'm serving that well
on that court." Mayotte said,
"it's difficult for anybody to re
turn," noting that it was the
same surface on which he de
feated Jimmv Connors last fall.
The win was especially satis
fying for Mayotte. who had
played less-than-super tennis all
weekend. Friday he defeated
Billy Nealon of USC in three un
inspired sets, before becoming
the second left foot on the danc
ing doubles team of he and Jim
Gurfein Saturday against
UCLA's Willenborg and John
Davis. The Bruins won in three
sets. 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
"I was pretty disappointed af
ter this afternoon. I had been
playing mediocre tennis. Walk
ing over here (to Maples) I said
to myself. 'Things have to
change,' " Mayotte said.
One guy who hopes things
never change is Falberg. The
freshman didn't lose a match all
weekend at No. 5 singles and in
third doubles with Arons. Fri
day he devastated USC's Jim
Agate 6-1, 64 before teaming
with Arons to beat Agate and
Jack Kruger in doubles 6-1.6-2.
"Agate is normally very

tenacious, but I think Falberg
just overpowered him." USC
coach Dick Leach said. "I
thought he would be in the top
four."
Saturday the Santa Barbara
native faced John Davis, a
nemesis since the two were in
12-vear-old juniors. The two
cannon-like servers boomed
salvos at each other all after
noon. with Falberg's service re
turns the difference in a 6-3.3-6.
6-1 decision.
UCLA's Davis, a high school
teammate of Scott Davis, said
Falberg wasn't playing any dif
ferently than he has in the past.
"He was pretty much the same.
He played well the third set."
the loser said. "He just beat
me."
Other highlights for the Cards
were Gurfein's 7-6 (5-3), 4-6, 6-3
win over UCLA's Robbie
Venter, and the doubles play of
Davis and Scott Bondurant at
first doubles. They outlasted
Nealon and Roger Knapp of USC
6-2, 2-6, 6-4 before icing the win
ning cake Saturday with a 7-5,
7-6 (5-3) win over Venter and
Dan Saltz. That was sweet re
venge for Bondurant, who had
suffered his first loss of the year
to Saltz Saturday afternoon in
three sets.
Stanford faces UC-Irvine
tomorrow afternoon here at
1:30, and will do so without
Davis, who got a "wild card" in
vitation into the $175,000 Jack
Kramer Open in Los Angeles
this week. One can only assume
he will be back for the Arizona
and Arizona State matches this
weekend.

sets. 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

ter this afternoon. I had been
playing mediocre tennis. Walk
ing over here (to Maples) I said
to myself. 'Things have to
change,' " Mayotte said.
One guy who hopes things
never change is Falberg. The
freshman didn't lose a match all
weekend at No. 5 singles and in
third doubles with Arons. Fri
day he devastated USC's Jim
Agate 6-1, 64 before teaming
with Arons to beat Agate and
Jack Kruger in doubles 6-1.6-2.

tenacious, but I think Falberg
just overpowered him." USC
coach Dick Leach said. "I
thought he would be in the top
four."
Saturday the Santa Barbara
native faced John Davis, a
nemesis since the two were in
12-vear-old juniors. The two
cannon-like servers boomed
salvos at each other all after
noon. with Falberg's service re
turns the difference in a 6-3.3-6.
6-1 decision.
UCLA's Davis, a high school
teammate of Scott Davis, said
Falberg wasn't playing any dif
ferently than he has in the past.
"He was pretty much the same.
He played well the third set."
the loser said. "He just beat
me."
Other highlights for the Cards
were Gurfein's 7-6 (5-3), 4-6, 6-3

Venter, and the doubles play of
Davis and Scott Bondurant at
first doubles. They outlasted
Nealon and Roger Knapp of USC
6-2, 2-6, 6-4 before icing the win
ning cake Saturday with a 7-5,
7-6 (5-3) win over Venter and
Dan Saltz. That was sweet re
venge for Bondurant, who had
suffered his first loss of the year
to Saltz Saturday afternoon in
three sets.
Stanford faces UC-Irvine
tomorrow afternoon here at
1:30, and will do so without
Davis, who got a "wild card" in
vitation into the $175,000 Jack

he will be back for the Arizona

weekend.
