## Diamonders split series with Trojans, 2-2 
### Andy Nuss 
The Stanford baseball team
traveled to USC this weekend
for an important four-game
series, which included a twilight
doubleheader on Friday.
Thursday's game was an ex
cellent start for the Cards. They
won the game 17-9. on the
strength of a home run ex
plosion led by catcher Bill
Worden He blasted a grand
slam home run in the sixth in
ning, and followed it with a
three-run shot in the seventh.
Mike Aldrete also contributed

with a two-run homer in the sec
ond.
All in all, the longball ac
counted for nine (more than
half) of Stanford's runs in the
first game of the the series.
The second game was partic
ularly meaningful to both
teams, as it was a makeup for
last month's meeting at Sunken
Diamond that was called by
darkness.
In that game, the two teams
had played to a 2-2 deadlock af
ter six innings. However, USC
had opened the seventh with

three runs. Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess then decided to
use some stall tactics as a result
of the darkness that threatened
to end the game early anyway.
With that decision he hoped to
prevent the disastrous seventh
inning from being recorded, and
he did indeed succeed in pre
serving the tie.
A Pacific-10 ruling then desig
nated the time and place for the
makeup contest, with Stanford
batting in the bottom of the in
nings just as a home team
would.

If the controversy behind the
second contest had any effect on
the Stanford ballplayers, it was
to make them try all the harder
to win their "home game."
Justice prevailed for Stan
ford. The steady pitching of
Cardinal ace Paul Grame, and
the clutch hitting of Loring
Davies produced an 8-4 victory
for the Cards.
The scorecard (seven in
nings, only three earned runs)
does not tell the whole story of
Grame's day. He seemed to
save his best breaks for the key
pitches, causing Trojan betters
to ground out into the hands of
Cardinal infielders, setting up
three double plays.
Loring Davies, who was shut
out by Trojan pitching in his
earlier turns at bat, came
through late in the game. He
posted three insurance runs to
make the final tally 8-4.
Unfortunately for the Stan
ford, Mickey Meitzer pitched a
superb third game for the Tro
jans, breaking up the Cardinal
bid for sole possesion of second
place in the league standings,
and swinging the momentum in
favor of USC.
Meitzer gave up only a few
scattered Cardinal hits through
six innings. A seventh inning
homerun by Mike Dotterer and
a ninth inning two-run smash by
Mike Toothman could not
change the outcome.

The Cardinals needed Satur
day's game for a successful
road trip. It may have been the
toughest game of the series,
with both clubs bringing tired
pitching staffs into the bullpen.
Marquess started freshman
Doug Gwaltney, a lefthander
who he had been bringing along
slowly.
According to coach Dean
Stotz "Gwaltney had a more
than adequate performance."
But with a pitching staff
diminished by the loss of injured
Brian Mignano, Stanford just
ran out of arms, losing 12-10.
Coach Stotz' overall per
formance of the Cardinals' per
formance this weekend: Stan
ford played well at their oppo
nents' home stadium. The
fielders made only five errors
over four games. Stanford had a
chance to move into a tie with
USC for second place in the
league by winning the final
game. But without the right
breaks with men in scoring posi
tion Stanford came up a little
short, losing by two runs and
falling two games behind USC
Stotz called USC "the class of
the league along with Arizona
State," and considering that an
away team carries three less
men on it's roster than a home
team, the advantage definitely
went to the home team in a four
game series.

who he had been bringing along
slowly.
According to coach Dean
Stotz "Gwaltney had a more
than adequate performance."
But with a pitching staff
diminished by the loss of injured
Brian Mignano, Stanford just
ran out of arms, losing 12-10.
Coach Stotz' overall per
formance of the Cardinals' per
formance this weekend: Stan
ford played well at their oppo
nents' home stadium. The
fielders made only five errors
over four games. Stanford had a
chance to move into a tie with
USC for second place in the
league by winning the final
game. But without the right
breaks with men in scoring posi
tion Stanford came up a little
short, losing by two runs and
falling two games behind USC
Stotz called USC "the class of
the league along with Arizona
State," and considering that an
away team carries three less
men on it's roster than a home
team, the advantage definitely
went to the home team in a four
game series.
The Stanford baseball team
traveled to USC this weekend
for an important four-game
series, which included a twilight
doubleheader on Friday.
Thursday's game was an ex
cellent start for the Cards. They
won the game 17-9. on the
strength of a home run ex
plosion led by catcher Bill
Worden He blasted a grand
slam home run in the sixth in
ning, and followed it with a
three-run shot in the seventh.
Mike Aldrete also contributed

with a two-run homer in the sec
ond.
All in all, the longball ac
counted for nine (more than
half) of Stanford's runs in the
first game of the the series.
The second game was partic
ularly meaningful to both
teams, as it was a makeup for
last month's meeting at Sunken
Diamond that was called by
darkness.
In that game, the two teams
had played to a 2-2 deadlock af
ter six innings. However, USC
had opened the seventh with

three runs. Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess then decided to
use some stall tactics as a result
of the darkness that threatened
to end the game early anyway.
With that decision he hoped to
prevent the disastrous seventh
inning from being recorded, and
he did indeed succeed in pre
serving the tie.
A Pacific-10 ruling then desig
nated the time and place for the
makeup contest, with Stanford
batting in the bottom of the in
nings just as a home team
would.

If the controversy behind the
second contest had any effect on
the Stanford ballplayers, it was
to make them try all the harder
to win their "home game."
Justice prevailed for Stan
ford. The steady pitching of
Cardinal ace Paul Grame, and
the clutch hitting of Loring
Davies produced an 8-4 victory
for the Cards.
The scorecard (seven in
nings, only three earned runs)
does not tell the whole story of
Grame's day. He seemed to
save his best breaks for the key
pitches, causing Trojan betters
to ground out into the hands of
Cardinal infielders, setting up
three double plays.
Loring Davies, who was shut
out by Trojan pitching in his
earlier turns at bat, came
through late in the game. He
posted three insurance runs to
make the final tally 8-4.
Unfortunately for the Stan
ford, Mickey Meitzer pitched a
superb third game for the Tro
jans, breaking up the Cardinal
bid for sole possesion of second
place in the league standings,
and swinging the momentum in
favor of USC.
Meitzer gave up only a few
scattered Cardinal hits through
six innings. A seventh inning
homerun by Mike Dotterer and
a ninth inning two-run smash by
Mike Toothman could not
change the outcome.

The Cardinals needed Satur
day's game for a successful
road trip. It may have been the
toughest game of the series,
with both clubs bringing tired
pitching staffs into the bullpen.
Marquess started freshman
Doug Gwaltney, a lefthander
who he had been bringing along
slowly.
According to coach Dean
Stotz "Gwaltney had a more
than adequate performance."
