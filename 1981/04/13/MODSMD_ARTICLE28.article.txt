Stanford men's golf coach David Yates has
been a self-proclaimed "eternal optimist" all
season long, and it finally seems to be paying
off.The Cardinals placed seventh out of 18
teams this weekend at the Fresno Classic, an
unusually high finish for the young team.
'"Again, I'm the eternal optimist. Maybe
someone needs to beat me over the head or
something, because I still don't think we
played as well as we could," Yates said.
"We haven't had a tournament yet where
four or five members of the team played well,"
he continued. "Maybe one or two will do well
each week, but we really need to have at least
three or four playing well at the same time. I
think we are getting closer every week."
Tim Robinson and David Games were low
scorers for Stanford with 226. Team captain

Jack Skilling and Neil Robinson followed with
totals of 229, while Lew Dickey and Doug
Thompson shot 233 and 248, respectively.
The Cardinals shot a team score of 1144, as
opposed to San Jose State's first place 1113.
USC followed the Spartans with 1117, and Oral
Roberts University took third with 1123.
Regardless of the difference in the number
of strokes, Yates maintained, "I don't see that
much difference between our players and the
top teams. We are a young team, just waiting
to mesh. Our kids are better than most, but
can't seem to get over the hump. Maybe it will
happen in the next two weeks."
Yates may find the breakthrough he is look
ing for at the Western Intercollegiate tomor
row through Thursday. The tournament will be
held at Pasatiempo golf course in Santa Cruz.
