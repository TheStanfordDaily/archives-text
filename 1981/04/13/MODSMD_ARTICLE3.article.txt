# Mascot proposals fail to make ballot
## 
### Mike Resnick 
After many weeks of preparation,
the ballot for Wednesday's and Thurs
day's ASSU elections has been
finalized.
Despite a last-minute push for sig
natures on petitions to put various
mascot choices on the ballot, too few
were obtained, and no mascot will ap
pear on the ballot.
ASSU Senator Jeff Bradach, who
heads the Mascot Search Committee,
said that petitions were given to
groups supporting four different
mascots — the Trees, the Cardinals,
the Gryphons and the Sequoias — ear
ly last week.
All failed to gain the 1200 signatures
last year's senate imposed as the min
imum number for placing a mascot
proposal on the ballot. The closest
were the Cards with 900 signatures
and the Trees with 700.
According to Bradach. a special
committee, authorized at the begin
ning of this academic year by Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, will select a
mascot.
Bradach stressed that there would
still be student input to the selection
process, since the committee would be
partially composed of student-ath
letes and students involved in ASSU.
He added that the committee, under
the direction of Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons, "will meet soon
after the election."
In the election for ASSU senators, 34
candidates are vying for the 10 regular
and 10 alternate positions, a con
siderably smaller field than last
year's field of 49.
The turnout of candidates for the
graduate student positions of the sen
ate was also light. Although the gradu
ates have as many senate positions as
the undergraduates, only four grads
had announced their candidacy by last
Monday, the original filing deadline.
The deadline was extended to Friday
afternoon, by which time five addi
tional graduates had filed for can
didacy.
In what may be seen as an attempt

to remedy the low graduate student in
terest. an election reform proposal
will also appear on Wednesday's
ballot.
If the amendment passes. Business
and Medical Schools will each have
one senator, as will the School oi
Education. Humanities and Sciences
and the Engineering Department will
each elect three Senators because ol
their larger enrollments.
David Daleke, a graduate student
senator who serves on the ASSU Sen
ate Rules Committee, said "The
whole idea behind the proposal Is that
grad life is department-based. It's
easier for undergrads to know each
other because they tend to spend more
time on campus." Daleke felt that be
cause graduate students interact with
each other mainly through their de
partment, the representation will be
"more direct."
Also on the ballot will be 17 fee
assessments requested by various or
ganizations. Since no group may re
ceive an assessment for more than
seven consecutive quarters, organiza
tions must specify the quarters they
want assessments for.
Nine of the groups have petitioned
for an Autumn quarter assessment,
five have asked for an assessment for
two quarters and three organizations
are asking for as assessment for all
three quarters.
The ballot also includes two slates
of four members each who are running
for Council of Presidents seats. Addi
tionally, there are five candidates for
the three positions on the Student Con
duct Legislative Council which con
siders Honor Code violations and dis
ciplinary problems.
Also, three four-member slates are
seeking positions as senior class presi
dents.
In order to win, all proposals and
candidates must receive a majority of
the ballots cast. The fee assessments,
however, require a minimum voter
turnout of 20 percent of the student
body. There will be ample opportunity

to vote, with 10 polling places operat
ing.
The official Election Handbook,
produced by the ASSU Election Com
mission. is scheduled to be distributed
today. It contains statements from
each of the candidates and explana
tions of the proposals.
Forums will be held tonight and
tomorrow during which any candidate
desiring to do so may participate. Ac
cording to Election Commissioner
Karen Bloom, five forums are sched
uled.
Tonight's are at Branner at o.ao
p.m. and at Rinconada at 10 p.m.
Tomorrow evening the candidates will
appear at Twain at 4:30, Donner at 6
and Tovon at 7:30 p.m. The candidates
for the Council of Presidents will
speak separately at Branner tomor
row night at 6:30.

According to Bradach. a special
committee, authorized at the begin
ning of this academic year by Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, will select a
mascot.
Bradach stressed that there would
still be student input to the selection
process, since the committee would be
partially composed of student-ath
letes and students involved in ASSU.
He added that the committee, under
the direction of Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons, "will meet soon
after the election."
In the election for ASSU senators, 34
candidates are vying for the 10 regular
and 10 alternate positions, a con
siderably smaller field than last
year's field of 49.
The turnout of candidates for the
graduate student positions of the sen
ate was also light. Although the gradu
ates have as many senate positions as
the undergraduates, only four grads
had announced their candidacy by last
Monday, the original filing deadline.
The deadline was extended to Friday
afternoon, by which time five addi
tional graduates had filed for can
didacy.
In what may be seen as an attempt

to remedy the low graduate student in
terest. an election reform proposal
will also appear on Wednesday's
ballot.
If the amendment passes. Business
and Medical Schools will each have
one senator, as will the School oi
Education. Humanities and Sciences
and the Engineering Department will
each elect three Senators because ol
their larger enrollments.
David Daleke, a graduate student
senator who serves on the ASSU Sen
ate Rules Committee, said "The
whole idea behind the proposal Is that
grad life is department-based. It's
easier for undergrads to know each
other because they tend to spend more
time on campus." Daleke felt that be
cause graduate students interact with
each other mainly through their de
partment, the representation will be
"more direct."
Also on the ballot will be 17 fee
assessments requested by various or
ganizations. Since no group may re
ceive an assessment for more than
seven consecutive quarters, organiza
tions must specify the quarters they
want assessments for.
Nine of the groups have petitioned
for an Autumn quarter assessment,
five have asked for an assessment for
two quarters and three organizations
are asking for as assessment for all
three quarters.
The ballot also includes two slates
of four members each who are running
for Council of Presidents seats. Addi
tionally, there are five candidates for
the three positions on the Student Con
duct Legislative Council which con
siders Honor Code violations and dis
ciplinary problems.
Also, three four-member slates are
seeking positions as senior class presi
dents.
In order to win, all proposals and
candidates must receive a majority of
the ballots cast. The fee assessments,
however, require a minimum voter
turnout of 20 percent of the student
body. There will be ample opportunity

to vote, with 10 polling places operat
ing.
The official Election Handbook,
produced by the ASSU Election Com
mission. is scheduled to be distributed
today. It contains statements from
each of the candidates and explana
tions of the proposals.
Forums will be held tonight and
tomorrow during which any candidate
desiring to do so may participate. Ac
cording to Election Commissioner
Karen Bloom, five forums are sched
uled.
Tonight's are at Branner at o.ao
p.m. and at Rinconada at 10 p.m.
Tomorrow evening the candidates will
appear at Twain at 4:30, Donner at 6
and Tovon at 7:30 p.m. The candidates
for the Council of Presidents will
speak separately at Branner tomor
row night at 6:30.
After many weeks of preparation,
the ballot for Wednesday's and Thurs
day's ASSU elections has been
finalized.
Despite a last-minute push for sig
natures on petitions to put various
mascot choices on the ballot, too few
were obtained, and no mascot will ap
pear on the ballot.
ASSU Senator Jeff Bradach, who
heads the Mascot Search Committee,
said that petitions were given to
groups supporting four different
mascots — the Trees, the Cardinals,
the Gryphons and the Sequoias — ear
ly last week.
All failed to gain the 1200 signatures
last year's senate imposed as the min
imum number for placing a mascot
proposal on the ballot. The closest
were the Cards with 900 signatures
and the Trees with 700.
According to Bradach. a special
committee, authorized at the begin
ning of this academic year by Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, will select a
mascot.
