The Stanford women's tennis team claimed the
Cal Invitational title in Berkeley this weekend,
but why they got the crown is somewhat of a mys
tery True, the Cards rolled to their 10th and 11th
victories of the year by beating Arizona 7-2, and
llC-Santa Barbara 8-1 in the two-day tournament,
but the host Bears also won twice, setting up a ti
tle match — one which was not scheduled and
therefore never played.
•The odds are that the Cards got the title simply
because everyone knows they are the best team
abound — with one, or possibly two exceptions.
Stanford's only loss this season came at the hands
of the two-time AIAW defending champs and
number-one ranked USC Trojans. The only other
match they have really been challenged in was
against UCLA, which came down to the final
doubles before the Cards pulled it out, 5-4.
And that is why the matches, despite the ease of
I victory, acquired some significance, as they rep
' resent the final tune-up for the Cardinal women
before they travel to Los Angeles next weekend to
face the Bruins and Southern Cal.
I "All matches have importance," senior and
!: team captain Donna Rubin agreed. "Because the
| more matches you play, the more tournament
| tough you become. Matches such as these are
helpful because you can work on certain things
( that you ordinarily wouldn't try in a tougher
I match."

Against Arizona on Friday, the Cards didn't
drop a set in sweeping the singles to clinch the
match prematurely, but suffered an obvious let
down in the doubles. Both the number two and
three teams won their first sets 6-0, before losing
their intentsity and dropping their respective
matches.
Saturday's confrontation with Santa Barbara
was similar in that the Cards won five of six sin
gles to assure themselves of the win, but the
doubles were a different story as they won at ev
ery position in straight sets. "We utilized the out
come of the match before to our advantage,"
Rubin explained.
After the romp in Berkeley, the Cards will now
have three days of crucial practice before heading
down south on Thursday. "We know what's ahead
of us," said Burgin. "We'vegotto really dig down,
and work hard."

tle match — one which was not scheduled and
therefore never played.
•The odds are that the Cards got the title simply
because everyone knows they are the best team
abound — with one, or possibly two exceptions.
Stanford's only loss this season came at the hands
of the two-time AIAW defending champs and
number-one ranked USC Trojans. The only other
match they have really been challenged in was
against UCLA, which came down to the final
doubles before the Cards pulled it out, 5-4.
And that is why the matches, despite the ease of
I victory, acquired some significance, as they rep
' resent the final tune-up for the Cardinal women
before they travel to Los Angeles next weekend to
face the Bruins and Southern Cal.
I "All matches have importance," senior and
!: team captain Donna Rubin agreed. "Because the
| more matches you play, the more tournament
| tough you become. Matches such as these are
helpful because you can work on certain things
( that you ordinarily wouldn't try in a tougher
I match."

Against Arizona on Friday, the Cards didn't
drop a set in sweeping the singles to clinch the
match prematurely, but suffered an obvious let
down in the doubles. Both the number two and
three teams won their first sets 6-0, before losing
their intentsity and dropping their respective
matches.
Saturday's confrontation with Santa Barbara
was similar in that the Cards won five of six sin
gles to assure themselves of the win, but the
doubles were a different story as they won at ev
ery position in straight sets. "We utilized the out
come of the match before to our advantage,"
Rubin explained.
After the romp in Berkeley, the Cards will now
have three days of crucial practice before heading
down south on Thursday. "We know what's ahead
of us," said Burgin. "We'vegotto really dig down,
and work hard."
