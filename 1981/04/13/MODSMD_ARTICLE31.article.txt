# Watson wins second Masters title
## 
### 
Augusta, Ga. lAP) — Tom Watson —
never headed, never tied — turned back
any would-be challengers with a front
running 71 and scored his second Masters
victory yesterday in the 45th renewal of
golf's annual spring rite.
Watson, who established himself as
golf's current king with his 1977 triumph
on the rolling hills of the Augusta Na
tional Golf Club course, won this one by
two strokes with a 280 total, eight shots
under par.
While he never trailed over the last 18
holes of this, the first of the year's four
major tests of golfing greatness, the
green jacket was a hard-won piece of
cloth.
It was not exactly a walk in the park.
There were challenges aplenty.
First — and last — there was the in
domitable figure of Jack Nicklaus. now
41 and secure in his position as the finest
player the ancient game has produced.
At other times, there were Johnny
Miller, gritty little John Mahaffey, and
Greg Norman, the white-haired Austral
ian sharp-shooter.
All got close at one time or another on
the warm spring afternoon, but none of
them could ever take that last step on the

trek through the azaleas and dogwoods.
None ever managed to pull even
The key to Watson's victory came on
the two back-nine par-fives, the 13th and
15th.
Miller, playing 54 minutes in front,
birdied the 17th from about 14 feet, to go
six under par and pull within one stroke
of Watson, who was seven under for the
tournament when he played the 13th.
And he got his second in Rae's Creek,
the little stream that trickles through a
ravine in front of the green
But Watson saved par — and his lead.
He pitched to 4 to 5 feet and made the
putt.
On the 15th, he two-putted for the
birdie that gave him a two-shot margin
and nailed it down.
Nicklaus and Miller tied for second, a
position unhappily familiar to each, with
282 totals. Miller, now a three-time run
nerup, had a closing 68. Nicklaus. who
was seeking a sixth Masters title, settled
instead for a share of a record he'd rath
er not have. He tied Tom Weiskopf for
the most second place finishes, four. Af
ter a slow start, he managed to match
par 72.
Norman was next alone at 283 after an

erratic 72. including a double bogey on
the long 10th that destroyed any upset
hopes he may have held
Tom Kite, who has a history of high
finishes in this event, and Jerry Pate
were next at 284 Kite closed up with a 68,
matching Miller's effort for the best
round of the day, and Pate shot 70
David Graham, an Australian and a
former winner of the PGA, was next at
71-285.
Ben Crenshaw, Mahaffey and Ray
Floyd followed at 286. Mahaffey, only
one stroke back with nine holes to go,
slipped to a 74 with 40 on the back. Floyd,
a former winner here and holder of two
1981 titles, shot 71. Crenshaw, still lack
ing the one major title he needs to con
firm his position in the game, had 73.
The victory was worth $60,000 to
Watson, who has set money-winning rec
ords in each of the past three seasons and
won Player of the Year honors in the past
four.
It also extended his habit of scoring
multiple triumphs in certain key events.
Of his 26 career victories, including
three British Opens, he has acquired 19
of them in only eight tournaments.

player the ancient game has produced.
At other times, there were Johnny
Miller, gritty little John Mahaffey, and
Greg Norman, the white-haired Austral
ian sharp-shooter.
All got close at one time or another on
the warm spring afternoon, but none of
them could ever take that last step on the

trek through the azaleas and dogwoods.
None ever managed to pull even
The key to Watson's victory came on
the two back-nine par-fives, the 13th and
15th.
Miller, playing 54 minutes in front,
birdied the 17th from about 14 feet, to go
six under par and pull within one stroke
of Watson, who was seven under for the
tournament when he played the 13th.
And he got his second in Rae's Creek,
the little stream that trickles through a
ravine in front of the green
But Watson saved par — and his lead.
He pitched to 4 to 5 feet and made the
putt.
On the 15th, he two-putted for the
birdie that gave him a two-shot margin
and nailed it down.
Nicklaus and Miller tied for second, a
position unhappily familiar to each, with
282 totals. Miller, now a three-time run
nerup, had a closing 68. Nicklaus. who
was seeking a sixth Masters title, settled
instead for a share of a record he'd rath
er not have. He tied Tom Weiskopf for
the most second place finishes, four. Af
ter a slow start, he managed to match
par 72.
Norman was next alone at 283 after an

erratic 72. including a double bogey on
the long 10th that destroyed any upset
hopes he may have held
Tom Kite, who has a history of high
finishes in this event, and Jerry Pate
were next at 284 Kite closed up with a 68,
matching Miller's effort for the best
round of the day, and Pate shot 70
David Graham, an Australian and a
former winner of the PGA, was next at
71-285.
Ben Crenshaw, Mahaffey and Ray
Floyd followed at 286. Mahaffey, only
one stroke back with nine holes to go,
slipped to a 74 with 40 on the back. Floyd,
a former winner here and holder of two
1981 titles, shot 71. Crenshaw, still lack
ing the one major title he needs to con
firm his position in the game, had 73.
The victory was worth $60,000 to
Watson, who has set money-winning rec
ords in each of the past three seasons and
won Player of the Year honors in the past
four.
It also extended his habit of scoring
multiple triumphs in certain key events.
Of his 26 career victories, including
three British Opens, he has acquired 19
of them in only eight tournaments.
