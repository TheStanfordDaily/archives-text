Friday afternoon. Stephen Miller
carefulv combed his hair on the
Kresge Auditorium stage and smiled
rakishlv at the early arrivals in the au
dience His beige suit contrasted with
the more conservative navy blue ones
worn by his fellow contestants Kenta
Duffev, Robert Riggs and Richard
Gray, who sat nervously at their
tables.
Minutes later, the Honorable Betty
Fletcher of the Ninth Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals in Seattle, the Hon
orable William Norris of the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals in Los Angel
es and the Honorable Han Linde of the
Oregon Supreme Court took their
places at the judges' table to preside
over the final contest of Stanford's
29th Annual Marion Rice Kirkwood
Moot Court Competition.
"All rise," the Clerk of the Court
said.
The audience stood up with the
judges and contestants for the formal
calling-to-order, beginning the con
test.
Stanford law students consider the
Kirkwood contest to be the most im
portant moot court competition of at
least five state and national competi
tions in which Stanford participates,
according to members of the Moot
Court Board.
"The level of competition is higher
than elsewhere," board member

Martin Cerullo said
More Stanford students participate
in this competition than any other (61
students of a school of more than 500
participated this year) and the win
ners are considered to be the top oral
advocates at Stanford.
Law School Dean Charles Meyers
considers the Kirkwood competition
so important that, as of last year, it is
the only one for which partici
pantsreceive academic credit.
"It is a positive thing for the school
to expose talent to the practicing law
yers who judge the preliminary
rounds and to the judges who decide
the final rounds. We want to show how
good these students are," Meyers
said.
More than 50 lawyers and judges
evaluated this year's contestants.
There was a strong sense of com
petition among the contest finalists.
Duffey and Miller said the primary
reason they participated was to win.
They also found the experience educa
tional and time-consuming.
"I think it's an excellent way to get
experience in brief writing and to get
critiqued on both brief writing on oral
presentation," Duffey said.
Duffey and Riggs presented their
oral argument for the petitioners (the
government) in the hypothetical case,
Civiletti us. The Archdiocese of San
Francisco. The case, drafted by third
year law students on the Moot Court

Board and Board adviser Victoria
Diaz, involved a constitutional
challenge by the Archdiocese of San
Francisco, a Roman Catholic institu
tion. to a law that would require it to
pay abortion-related benefits to em
ployees.
After Duffey and Riggs spoke, Gray
and Miller presented the respondent's
side of the case Legal jargon flowed
from the contestants' mouths like hon
ey as they attempted to persuade the
judges to decide in their favor.
After all arguments were made and
the judges asked all the impossible
questions they could think of, a 20-
minute recess was ordered. However,
instead of deciding the case, the
judges evaluated the performances of
the contestants.
The judges decided in favor of Rich
ard Gray as the best advocate for his
oral argument, and Kenta Duffey and
Robert Riggs as the best team for
their combined efforts in oral ad
vocacy and brief presentation. Riggs
and Duffey also won the best brief
award for the graceful writing and
careful research exhibited in their
brief, according to the judges.
"Being present before three such
eminent judges was the most exciting
thing," she added.
A Supreme Court Justice is usually
present for the final competition.
However, Justice William Rehnquist,
scheduled to preside this year, was un
able to attend due to a back problem
which makes travel difficult, accord
ing to Dean Meyers.
