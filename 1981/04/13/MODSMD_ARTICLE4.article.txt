Felicia Stella says she can afford to
be a freshman here through a com
bination of loans and University finan
cial aid Federally-funded student
loans also help her family pay for her
older brother's college costs. She de
scribes her family's status as upper
middle-class but says. "If wecan'tget
loans, we can't go to school."
But the Guaranteed Student Loans
(GSLsi her family uses for funds are
under the knife of budget cutters in
Washington.
If proposed changes in GSLs — the
most widely used federal student aid
program — are passed by Congress,
the effective interest rate on the loans
will rise.
For undergraduates, the rate would
increase from 9 percent to 15 percent.
The effective rate for graduate stu
dents would be 14 percent.
About 4700 Stanford students would
be affected These students borrowed
$13 1 million this school year Borrow
ing could decrease 30 percent if all the
proposed changes are instituted, said
Robert Huff, director of financial
aids.
For the University, the most painful
cuts would come from proposed
changes in a second federal program

— Pell grants — which would cost the
University up to $200,000
According to a University impact
analysis, changes in Pell grants and
the loss of GSL administrative cost al
lowances could mean a total loss of
$258,000 for the University.
The programs and the main changes
proposed are outlined below:
GSL — Under this program banks
make loans directly to students The
collegeor university just certifies that
the student is registered, since the
loans are not based on need Under
graduates can borrow up to $2500
while graduate students can borrow
up to $5000 The federal government
pays banks the interest on the loans
Two proposed changes will affect
recipients.
First, the loans would be based on
need. Second, the government would
no longer pay lenders the in-school in
terest subsidy of 9 percent. Students
would pay interest while in school
While the first change would cut
"loans of convenience" — borrowing
to take advantage of the low interest
rate — the second proposal would
raise the interest rates for borrowers.
Robert Rosenzweig. University
vice-president for public affairs, said
these changes could "polarize" col
lege campuses between those poor
enough to qualify for need-based loans
and students rich enough to forego fed
eral aid
He said GSLs had come under fire
because of the convenience loan prob
lem. But he said the program is bene
ficial as a whole.
"We're the kind of institution it was
designed to help." he said
Pell Grants — This is a need-based
grant program. The revised 1981 pro
gram permits a maximum grant of
$1750. This year. 1100 Stanford stu
dents received $1.1 million through
this program.
The hardest-hitting change pro
posed would require families to in
crease their contribution to educa
tional costs. Under the current sys
considered, as well as how much the
recipient's family is assumed to have
set aside for education
Under the new proposal, inflation
would not be accounted for and fami
lies would be responsible for a greater
