# New funds for student loans: state may come to the rescue

New state-run parent loan pro
grams may help students pay for col
lege as other fund sources dry up.
In most states the loan programs
will be in operation by this summer, a
U.S. Department of Education survey
found.
"How big a help it will be remains to
be seen," said Jean Park, a depart
ment spokesperson. The Parent Loan
for Undergraduate Students (PLUS)
program was authorized by the
Education Amendments of 1980 —
before the Reagan administration
took office. But if left untouched, the
program "should certainly be a big
plus for students." she said.
In California the program is still un
der consideration in the attorney gen
eral's office. A spokesperson there
said a decision whether to implement
it would be handed down "within four
to six weeks."

PLUS will operate much like the
Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) pro
gram with one major exception — re
payment of both principal and interest
begins 60 days after funds are dis
bursed. Under the GSL program, the
federal government would subsidize
loans while student borrowers were
still in school.
The rate of interest is set at 9 per
cent and students can borrow up to
$3000 each year for five years.
Graduate and independent students
are barred from the program.
The same state and private non
profit guarantee agencies that ensure
GSL loans will operate the PLUS pro
gram.
Like the GSL program, repayment
can be extended over 10 years and can
be temporarily deferred if the bor
rower is disabled, unemployed or
serving in the armed forces.
