# Grads vent financial concerns, warn of dangers of low stipends
## 
### Mike Vaska Second of two parts 
Graduate students have just recently organized to fight
for financial support from the University. At meetings co
sponsored by the Stanford Fellows Association and the So
cial Sciences Graduate Students Association — which
were formed during this school year — many of the more
than 80 graduate students attending vented their frustra
tions and dissatifaction with the amount of aid the Stan
ford has provided in recent years.

And University officials have recently sounded the
alarm, facing the very real possibilities of massive federal
cuts in support for higher education. However, officials
stress that Stanford will continue to provide financial sup
port for graduate students at the present levels — 80 per
cent of living expenses for teaching assistants and 60 per
cent for graduate students on fellowships.
But at other schools around the nation, the problem has
been recognized earlier, and graduate students have en
gaged in strikes and haveorganized to try to improve their
support levels
At other major universities, graduate students have not
only organized to work for more aid. they have also formed
collective bargaining groups — unions — to provide the
muscle to back their demands.
In February, about 100 teaching assistants in the Eng
lish. education and foreign language departments at the
University of Houston staged a "sickout" to demand an
end to what one teaching assistant called "slave wages."

Graduate students at the universities of Wisconsin.
Michigan. Rutgers and Oregon are already organized into
collective bargaining units and recently, more than 2000
Florida State University graduate teaching assistants won
the right to unionize.
Private universities have so far been spared the gradu
ate student demands that have led to the formation of
unions.
But according to Andrea Bollin of the Council of Gradu
ate Schools headquartered in Washington, D C., private
schools may be in "deep trouble by 1982 or 1983. "
The Reagan administration budget calls for very few
federal funds for the support of graduate education, espe
cially in the humanities and social sciences. Bollin said.
In addition, if the guaranteed student loan program is
abolished — some say it may happen as early as this year
— graduate students will be almost totally dependent on
states and universities for their aid. she said.
Stanford's graduate students — Teaching Assistants.
Research Assistants and students on fellowships — pres
ently are not planning to form a collective bargaining unit,
according to Frank Dobbin of the Social Studies Graduate
Students Association.
"Graduate students would like to work through the ad
ministrative and decision-making processes now in
place," he said. "In thelong run. a collective (bargaining)
group is a possibility — a lot of graduate students are talk
ing about it," Dobbin said.
Graduate students feel the University should reassess
its priorities and adjust them to provide higher levels of
financial aid for graduate students, Dobbin said The
amount of money needed from the University budget is
very small in proportion to its total size, and Stanford

could divert money from areas of lower priority such as
building and grounds improvement to provide the addi
tional funding, he added.
If graduate students do not receive more money, enabl
ing them to meet the high cost of living in the Bay Area, a
host of long- and short-term problems will ensue, Dobbin
said.
In the immediate future, for example, many graduate
students may get into a "financial bind" if they are forced
to go deeply into debt to pay for their living expenses while
in school, he said.
Dobbin said that a graduate student on a four-year fel
lowship at Stanford will have to borrow $10,000 during that
period if he cannot obtain the money from other outside
sources, such as parents or another job.
Graduate students, especially in the humanities and so
cial sciences, can often expect to earn less than $20,000 per
year when they complete their Ph D programs — a salary
that will make paying back the loans very difficult.
Graduate students forced to take non-academic jobs to
supplement their stipends may also have less time to
spend teaching and grading undergraduate courses: as a
result the quality of undergraduate instruction may also
deteriorate, Dobbin said.
In the longer run. students faced with such graduate fun
ding realities may decide "it is crazy" to go to graduate
school, and the number and quality of the applicants may
decline, Dobbin said.
Talented potential graduate students have "a lot of op
tions" — they may enter business, law or medicine — and
may opt not to attend graduate school if they must go heav
ily into debt to do so, Dobbin said.
But Dean of Graduate Education Gerald Lieberman

said he disagreed with the assertion that decreased gradu
ate aid would lead inexorably to a decline in the number
and quality of graduate students.
"People go into an academic career for the love of the
subject. While I know you can only eat love for so long — it
is not a substitute for bread and other things — most grad
uate students are willing to make sacrifices for their
education," Lieberman said
According to Sociology Professor John Meyer, the fact
that funding does not meet the living costs of graduate stu
dents here will not have a "serious effect on the quality of
graduate students." However, the need to take other jobs
will "drain time away" from graduate students' educa
tional efforts, Meyer said
Funding shortages will also put pressure on graduate
students to apply themselves harder and be more prac
tically oriented in their graduate education, he said
Graduate students should not form unions because they
"are not employees" in the traditional sense, Lieberman
said. They are students, and they should not feel that they
are here only to earn an hourly wage for the work they per
form for the University, he added
Mever said that although graduate students should not
form a collective bargaining unit, it is good that they are
making an effort to open discussion on the problem
Stanford has "drifted into the problem" of inadequate
graduate funding during the last few years, and what is
needed now is a clear discussion of University policy and
its impact on students and a "considerable amount of can
dor in the admissions process" so that entering graduate
students will know exactly how much of their living ex
penses will be provided for by Stanford, Meyer said

ing about it," Dobbin said.
Graduate students feel the University should reassess
its priorities and adjust them to provide higher levels of
financial aid for graduate students, Dobbin said The
amount of money needed from the University budget is
very small in proportion to its total size, and Stanford

could divert money from areas of lower priority such as
building and grounds improvement to provide the addi
tional funding, he added.
If graduate students do not receive more money, enabl
ing them to meet the high cost of living in the Bay Area, a
host of long- and short-term problems will ensue, Dobbin
said.
In the immediate future, for example, many graduate
students may get into a "financial bind" if they are forced
to go deeply into debt to pay for their living expenses while
in school, he said.
Dobbin said that a graduate student on a four-year fel
lowship at Stanford will have to borrow $10,000 during that
period if he cannot obtain the money from other outside
sources, such as parents or another job.
Graduate students, especially in the humanities and so
cial sciences, can often expect to earn less than $20,000 per
year when they complete their Ph D programs — a salary
that will make paying back the loans very difficult.
Graduate students forced to take non-academic jobs to
supplement their stipends may also have less time to
spend teaching and grading undergraduate courses: as a
result the quality of undergraduate instruction may also
deteriorate, Dobbin said.
In the longer run. students faced with such graduate fun
ding realities may decide "it is crazy" to go to graduate
school, and the number and quality of the applicants may
decline, Dobbin said.
Talented potential graduate students have "a lot of op
tions" — they may enter business, law or medicine — and
may opt not to attend graduate school if they must go heav
ily into debt to do so, Dobbin said.
But Dean of Graduate Education Gerald Lieberman

said he disagreed with the assertion that decreased gradu
ate aid would lead inexorably to a decline in the number
and quality of graduate students.
"People go into an academic career for the love of the
subject. While I know you can only eat love for so long — it
is not a substitute for bread and other things — most grad
uate students are willing to make sacrifices for their
education," Lieberman said
According to Sociology Professor John Meyer, the fact
that funding does not meet the living costs of graduate stu
dents here will not have a "serious effect on the quality of
graduate students." However, the need to take other jobs
will "drain time away" from graduate students' educa
tional efforts, Meyer said
Funding shortages will also put pressure on graduate
students to apply themselves harder and be more prac
tically oriented in their graduate education, he said
Graduate students should not form unions because they
"are not employees" in the traditional sense, Lieberman
said. They are students, and they should not feel that they
are here only to earn an hourly wage for the work they per
form for the University, he added
Mever said that although graduate students should not
form a collective bargaining unit, it is good that they are
making an effort to open discussion on the problem
Stanford has "drifted into the problem" of inadequate
graduate funding during the last few years, and what is
needed now is a clear discussion of University policy and
its impact on students and a "considerable amount of can
dor in the admissions process" so that entering graduate
students will know exactly how much of their living ex
penses will be provided for by Stanford, Meyer said
Graduate students have just recently organized to fight
for financial support from the University. At meetings co
sponsored by the Stanford Fellows Association and the So
cial Sciences Graduate Students Association — which
were formed during this school year — many of the more
than 80 graduate students attending vented their frustra
tions and dissatifaction with the amount of aid the Stan
ford has provided in recent years.

Sews analysis

And University officials have recently sounded the
alarm, facing the very real possibilities of massive federal
cuts in support for higher education. However, officials
stress that Stanford will continue to provide financial sup
port for graduate students at the present levels — 80 per
cent of living expenses for teaching assistants and 60 per
cent for graduate students on fellowships.
But at other schools around the nation, the problem has
been recognized earlier, and graduate students have en
gaged in strikes and haveorganized to try to improve their
support levels
At other major universities, graduate students have not
only organized to work for more aid. they have also formed
collective bargaining groups — unions — to provide the
muscle to back their demands.
In February, about 100 teaching assistants in the Eng
lish. education and foreign language departments at the
University of Houston staged a "sickout" to demand an
end to what one teaching assistant called "slave wages."

Graduate students at the universities of Wisconsin.
Michigan. Rutgers and Oregon are already organized into
collective bargaining units and recently, more than 2000
Florida State University graduate teaching assistants won
the right to unionize.
Private universities have so far been spared the gradu
ate student demands that have led to the formation of
unions.
But according to Andrea Bollin of the Council of Gradu
ate Schools headquartered in Washington, D C., private
schools may be in "deep trouble by 1982 or 1983. "
The Reagan administration budget calls for very few
federal funds for the support of graduate education, espe
cially in the humanities and social sciences. Bollin said.
In addition, if the guaranteed student loan program is
abolished — some say it may happen as early as this year
— graduate students will be almost totally dependent on
states and universities for their aid. she said.
Stanford's graduate students — Teaching Assistants.
Research Assistants and students on fellowships — pres

according to Frank Dobbin of the Social Studies Graduate
