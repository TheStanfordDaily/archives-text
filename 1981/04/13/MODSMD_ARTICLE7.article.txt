## Poles hang on to hope 
### 
Warsaw, Poland (AP> — De
spite the harsh words from
Prague, many Polish Com
munists cling to the hope that
they can continue the liber
alization of their party.
"The Czechoslovak move
ment for reform was similar,
with one crucial difference,"
said one Polish party member
after Leonid Brezhnev and
Czechoslovak party chief
Gustav Husak likened the situ
ation in Poland to the liber
alization movement that the So
viet army crushed in
Czechslovakia in 1968.
"Their reforms came from
the top. from intellectuals
trying to attract the workers.
Ours comes from the
grassroots. It is stronger and
has more chances for success. A
real Marxist revolution."
Grassroots reforms
Many party members said in
interviews that they feel grass
roots reforms strengthen rather
than weaken "democratic cen
tralism," Lenin's foundation of
socialism which gives the par
• tv's central committee ultimate
authority over local organiza
tions.
Across Poland, local party
Cells and committees are pre
paring for what some feel could
be the party's most momentous
congress in its 36 years in
power. Expected by mid-July, it
will chart future policies in the
light of the social and political
; changes launched by the na
tionwide labor unrest last sum
mer.
Secret ballot
If the central committee at a
meeting later this month ap
proves proposals for reforms,
the congress will be the first
made up of delegates elected by
secret ballot from an unlimited
pool of candidates.
Such free elections do not
mesh with traditional party
practice that everywhere else in
the Soviet bloc, and in the past in
Poland, enables party leaders to
orchestrate their congresses in
advance.
The electoral reform was pro
■posed at the last central com
mittee meeting at which party
leaders came under sharp
criticism for losing touch with
rank-and-file sentiments. Many
party members consider them
necessary to prevent a repeti
tion of last year's strike wave.
Example
Some party members say
they have set an example for
party leaders in other East Eu
ropean countries who are in
stituting limited reforms to
keep the rank and file quiet.
Polish party leaders publicly
blame former first secretary
Edward Gierek's policies for
sparking the Polish crisis by in
vesting too much in industry at
the expense of agriculture, and
for not seeing the crisis coming.
But the big question is how the
Soviets will react?
"A reasonable answer could
be that the Soviets' vital in
terest is to have Poland as a
strong and loyal neighbor with a
strong party," the editor said.
"If the congress brings new sup
port. is it not in the interest of
the Soviet Union?"

Taking a stand

last week. The town was reportedly hit by Iraqi missiles 10
days ago.
