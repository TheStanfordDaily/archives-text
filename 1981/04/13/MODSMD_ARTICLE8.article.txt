# Belgian recovery suffers another setback
## 
### Washington Post 
Brussels — After the collapse last week of
the Belgian government, it was noted that,
for once, a government here had fallen over
the sort of hard economic problems beset
ting most countries rather than the old ri
valries between the Dutch and French
speaking peoples, which have toppled 29
Belgian governments since World War 11.
Belgium this time was an early European
casualty of the West's economic slump
While much of the world is economically
troubled, the situation in Belgium is among
the most worrisome, as a result of political
inaction against a mounting front of prob
lems. These include a severe balance-of
pavments deficit, widespread industrial
fatigue and welfare payments that have out
stripped the country's ability to pay.
Unions
Belgian conservatives are at odds with
the powerful trade unions over tough meas
ures to deal with what many regard as a
near-disastrous national condition. The in
ternational community rendered a no-con
fidence judgment recently by speculating
heavily on a currency devaluation
In an unprecedented move, Belgium's
King Baudouin last week summoned the
leading political, business and labor figures
of his crisis-ridden country for a royal pep
talk. It was a risky initiative taken by a
basically powerless monarch, who upset
some politicians and pundits by appearing
to step outside the normal channels of Cabi
net government to get his message across.
But the king's brief address succeeded in
dramatizing the gravity of the moment. In
what amounted to a slight overstatement,
the king declared that Belgium was con

fronted with a "war for the survival of our
economy."
Language conflict
Managing affairs in this small central Eu
ropean country has never been easy, due
primarily to Belgium's rival language
groups. Dutch-speaking Flemings dominate
the northern half of the country and French
speaking Walloons dominate the southern
half.
But the current crisis differs from past
splits. "This is the first crisis we've had not
based on a fight between the two peoples,"
said Guido Fontevn. political correspondent
for the Flemish daily De Standaard. "This
one has been caused by contrasting left
right political views on the economy."
An American analyst said, "This is a fun
damental crisis on fundamental economic
issues. It has brought Belgium's long-sim
mering economic problems to a boil."
Problems
The basic problems are these:
— Unemployment related to Belgium's
aging, recession-plagued heavy industries
is expected to increase by 100.000 persons
this year, to reach 477,000 — about 10.5 per
cent of the work force and the highest rate in
the European Community.
— The cost of maintaining the country's
generous unemployment benefits and social
services had already overwhelmed the
budget. The deficit on current expenditures
is predicted to double and worse this year,
from $2.6 billion $5.8 billion. Since 1978,
Belgium has been borrowing from abroad to
make ends meet.
— As a result of the borrowing and the in
ability to compete industrially abroad,
Belgium's current balance of payments is
expected to slide further this year to $6.8
billion, which, at roughly 6 percent of the

gross national product, exceeds the deficit
of any other Western European country.
While the signs of economic erosion have
been evident for some time, the country's
intractable political problems have kept the
government from focusing on the economy.
Agreement last August on constitutional
changes and a regionalization plan to grant
limited autonomy to Flanders and Wallonia
finally freed government leaders to spend
more time considering economic matters.
But the issues are linked.
Recovery
A start on a three-stage program of na
tional economic recovery — involving wage
restraints, spending cuts and
dustrialization — was made this year when
labor and business agreed to limit wage in
creases for two years.
At a subsequent negotiating session of
ministers two weeks ago, the center-left
coalition government of Social Christians
and Socialists agreed to spending cuts of
roughly $3 billion over three years.
These were widely perceived as insuffi
cient, however, and rumors of a Belgian de
valuation began to fly.
Appearing to panic, the prime minister,
Wilfried Martens, sought crisis talks early
last week in which he pressed for more se
vere measures, the most drastic being sus
pension of wage indexation. The Socialists
and their labor-union constituents balked.
No one is optimistic about the prospect of
Belgian economic recovery in the near
term. Essential to any effective new pro
gram would be the unions' tacit agreement
to change the indexation system and politi
cal courage among government leaders to
reduce social-welfare spending.

Belgian economic recovery in the near
term. Essential to any effective new pro
gram would be the unions' tacit agreement

reduce social-welfare spending.
Brussels — After the collapse last week of
the Belgian government, it was noted that,
for once, a government here had fallen over
the sort of hard economic problems beset
ting most countries rather than the old ri
valries between the Dutch and French
speaking peoples, which have toppled 29
Belgian governments since World War 11.
Belgium this time was an early European
casualty of the West's economic slump
While much of the world is economically
troubled, the situation in Belgium is among
the most worrisome, as a result of political
inaction against a mounting front of prob
lems. These include a severe balance-of
pavments deficit, widespread industrial
fatigue and welfare payments that have out
stripped the country's ability to pay.
Unions
Belgian conservatives are at odds with
the powerful trade unions over tough meas
ures to deal with what many regard as a
near-disastrous national condition. The in
ternational community rendered a no-con
fidence judgment recently by speculating
heavily on a currency devaluation
In an unprecedented move, Belgium's
King Baudouin last week summoned the
leading political, business and labor figures
of his crisis-ridden country for a royal pep
talk. It was a risky initiative taken by a
basically powerless monarch, who upset
some politicians and pundits by appearing
to step outside the normal channels of Cabi
net government to get his message across.
But the king's brief address succeeded in
dramatizing the gravity of the moment. In
what amounted to a slight overstatement,
the king declared that Belgium was con

fronted with a "war for the survival of our
economy."
Language conflict
Managing affairs in this small central Eu
ropean country has never been easy, due
primarily to Belgium's rival language
groups. Dutch-speaking Flemings dominate
the northern half of the country and French
speaking Walloons dominate the southern
half.
But the current crisis differs from past
splits. "This is the first crisis we've had not
based on a fight between the two peoples,"
said Guido Fontevn. political correspondent
for the Flemish daily De Standaard. "This
one has been caused by contrasting left
right political views on the economy."
An American analyst said, "This is a fun
damental crisis on fundamental economic
issues. It has brought Belgium's long-sim
mering economic problems to a boil."
Problems
The basic problems are these:
— Unemployment related to Belgium's
aging, recession-plagued heavy industries
is expected to increase by 100.000 persons
this year, to reach 477,000 — about 10.5 per
cent of the work force and the highest rate in
the European Community.
— The cost of maintaining the country's
generous unemployment benefits and social
services had already overwhelmed the
budget. The deficit on current expenditures
is predicted to double and worse this year,
from $2.6 billion $5.8 billion. Since 1978,
Belgium has been borrowing from abroad to
make ends meet.
— As a result of the borrowing and the in
ability to compete industrially abroad,
Belgium's current balance of payments is
expected to slide further this year to $6.8
billion, which, at roughly 6 percent of the

gross national product, exceeds the deficit
of any other Western European country.
While the signs of economic erosion have
been evident for some time, the country's
intractable political problems have kept the
government from focusing on the economy.
Agreement last August on constitutional
changes and a regionalization plan to grant
limited autonomy to Flanders and Wallonia
finally freed government leaders to spend
more time considering economic matters.
But the issues are linked.
Recovery
A start on a three-stage program of na
tional economic recovery — involving wage
restraints, spending cuts and
dustrialization — was made this year when
labor and business agreed to limit wage in
creases for two years.
At a subsequent negotiating session of
ministers two weeks ago, the center-left
coalition government of Social Christians
and Socialists agreed to spending cuts of
roughly $3 billion over three years.
These were widely perceived as insuffi
cient, however, and rumors of a Belgian de
valuation began to fly.
Appearing to panic, the prime minister,
Wilfried Martens, sought crisis talks early
last week in which he pressed for more se
vere measures, the most drastic being sus
pension of wage indexation. The Socialists
and their labor-union constituents balked.
