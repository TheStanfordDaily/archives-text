# Haig's first trip abroad: leaders get no surprises from the new secretary
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Alexander
Haig's first overseas trip, an
eight-dav, nine-nation tour of
the Middle East and Western
Europe, ended in Bonn. West
Germany, Saturday, in neither
triumph nor disaster.
From all appearances, the
secretary of state managed a
predictable but solid start in the
Middle East on establishing the
personal and political rela
tionships essential to policy in
that important area. But there
were also just enough gaffes to
keep alive the controversy that
had dogged him in recent weeks.
Like so much of U.S. foreign
policy, the trip began with a
simple concept and ballooned to
more complex, even exhaust
ing, proportions.
Peace process
Originally the journey was
designed to demonstrate U.S.
interest in the Middle East
peace process during the diplo
matic hiatus between the in
auguration of President Ronald
Reagan and the June 30 Israeli
national elections, which are ex
pected to define that country's
future leadership. One part of
the aim was to head off demands
for more dramatic American
activity, or a trip to Washington
by Israel's embattled prime
minister. Menachem Begin.
Once on the drawing board,
the trip also was seen as a
chance for Haig to try out his
concept of a loose anti-Soviet
"strategic consensus" embrac
ing the diverse and often war

ring group of states that are
America's main diplomatic and
military partners in the region:
Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia.
Stopovers
Onto this core of one-day vis
its to those four countries was
grafted a day in Spain to make
up for a harmful remark by
Haig in late February that an at
tempted military coup in Ma
drid was an "internal matter."
Also added was a British stop
over on the way home for rest,
fuel and a meeting requested by
Foreign Secretary Lord Peter
Carrington, who considers
himself a Middle East expert
and policy coordinator.
When the West Germans
heard Haig was stopping in Lon
don, they asked that the secre
tary of state make a visit to
Bonn, giving them equal status.
Haig agreed, but then could not
avoid an equal excursion to Par
is. especially since French
President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing is in a stiff battle for
re-election, and a flyover would
be interpreted as a U.S. snub.
The final dish in this
progressive supper was pasta,
added by request of an Italian
government that feels it has
often been unfairly excluded
from the U.S.-British-French-
German gentleman's club. Haig
made room for a three-hour air
port stopover in Rome last
Wednesday to meet Foreign
Minister Emilio Columbo.
Achievements
So what did it all accomplish?

So far as an accompanying re
porter can determine, the main
achievements were in the
Middle East, and these largely
involved the slaying of
hobgoblins.
• President Anwar Sadat of
Egypt, a leading practitioner of
personal diplomacy, was eager
for contact with the new secre
tary of state but seriously wor
ried about military rumbles
from Washington. Haig went to
great lengths to assure Sadat,
according to sources, that the
proposed Sinai peacekeeping
force in connection with next
year's Israeli withdrawal is not
a cover for an American Mid
east intervention force.
U.S. officials left Egypt be
lieving that Sadat will go along
with American participation in
a Sinai peacekeeping force
whose role is strictly limited.
Moreover, Sadat is believed
ready to permit regular U.S.
forces to use facilities at the
Egyptian base of Ras Banas on
the Red Sea, if Washington will
be content to seal this arrange
ment with only a handshake
rather than a formal agree
ment.

News analysis

• Prime Minister Begin and
his fellow leaders were happy
with the initial Israeli policy
orientation of the new adminis
tration, but worried by Wash
ington's simultaneous courtship
of Saudi Arabia. Haig's as
surance that Israel is a
"strategic asset" and central to
U.S. Mideast policy was just
what Jerusalem wanted to hear.
Gimmicks
On the other hand, not even an
extra $200 million in aid to Is
rael, via procurement gim
micks produced from Haig's kit
bag. reconciled the Israeli lead
ership to the U.S. sale of the
AWACS radar-surveillance
plane to the Saudis. Despite
Haig's pleas, the Israelis in
dicated they'll work hard
against the AWACS sale on
Capitol Hill.
• Jordan's King Hussein,
whose relations with Washing
ton sank to an all-time low dur
ing the last years of the Carter
administration, also sought to
restore his "personal rela
tionship with Washington."
Haig apparently succeeded in
doing so, aided by his rapport
with Hussein as a fellow mili
tary man. (But on the way out of
the area, Haig mistakenly re
ferred to the Jordanian king as
Hassan, the name of his younger
brother and crown prince.)
No deals
While reportedly happy with
Haig in private, Hussein made
repeatedly clear in public his re
fusal to join the Camp David
process or to negotiate a sepa
rate deal with Israel under a
"Jordanian option." In an em
barrassing incident, Jordanian
Foreign Minister Marwan al
Kassem took an anti-Israeli
stand before reporters and cam
eras just after Haig claimed to

have forged "a convergence of
views."
• The Saudi leadership, in the
mirror image of their nemesis,
were pleased with Washington's
initial policies toward their
country but wary of those
toward Israel. Haig told the
Saudis in strong terms that in
both cases "we stand by our
friends."
The Saudis, in private, are not
that unhappy with U.S.-Israeli
friendship if it holds the pros
pect of producing shifts in Is
raeli positions. And they were
greatly pleased by Haig's
statement of steadfastness
toward Saudi Arabia.
Anti-Soviet activism
Haig has said repeatedly in
public and private that the anti-
Soviet activism of the Reagan
administration is vital to repair
ing American fortunes in the
area. The regional leaders
seemed to approve a more vig
orous American role but at the
same time some of them, in
cluding the Saudis, were con
cerned in advance of Haig's ar
rival about how far, how fast,
the United States intended to
move toward confrontation
while its available resources
are still in doubt. Haig is re
ported to have been reassuring
on this point.
The least expected piece of
business Haig transacted — and
one of the most important —
was over the sudden surge of
fighting in Lebanon. In a flurry
of official notes and private
messages Haig appealed to such
diverse actors as Moscow and
the Vatican, Syria and Israel, to
help put down the fighting.
The diplomatic efforts seem
for the moment to have suc
ceeded in preventing the fight
ing from becoming uncon
trollable. But Haig did not help
himself or this effort when he
denounced Syrian "brutality"
from the steps of the Israeli
prime minister's office; that
sent tremors through the con
spiracy-prone Middle East.
Snake pit
A public figure seeking to
avoid missteps would hardly
select the Middle East snake pit
for his first overseas journey.
Moreover, the setting, in cur
rent circumstances, was far re
moved from the main focus of
American and world attention
in Europe, where Defense Sec
retary Caspar Weinberger was
speaking and acting for the
United States on a previously
planned trip. By the time Haig
hit Europe, the Polish alarm
bells had diminished.
A European hobgoblin, as the
famous "senior official" told
reporters on the last leg of
Haig's trip, involved concern
about "repetitive threats on a
high level" regarding the situ
ation in Poland. The Europeans
"want to be careful," reporters
were told, and apparently Haig
does, too, believing that an over
emphasis on the threat of Soviet
military action might be a fac
tor in causing it to happen. In his
view the threat to Poland during
the past week never wait
beyond the political level.

from the steps of the Israeli
prime minister's office; that
sent tremors through the con

Snake pit
A public figure seeking to
avoid missteps would hardly
select the Middle East snake pit
for his first overseas journey.
Moreover, the setting, in cur
rent circumstances, was far re
moved from the main focus of
American and world attention
in Europe, where Defense Sec
retary Caspar Weinberger was
speaking and acting for the
United States on a previously
planned trip. By the time Haig
hit Europe, the Polish alarm
bells had diminished.
A European hobgoblin, as the
famous "senior official" told
reporters on the last leg of
Haig's trip, involved concern
about "repetitive threats on a
high level" regarding the situ
ation in Poland. The Europeans
"want to be careful," reporters
were told, and apparently Haig
does, too, believing that an over

Washington — Alexander
Haig's first overseas trip, an
eight-dav, nine-nation tour of
the Middle East and Western
Europe, ended in Bonn. West
Germany, Saturday, in neither
triumph nor disaster.
From all appearances, the
secretary of state managed a
predictable but solid start in the
Middle East on establishing the
personal and political rela
tionships essential to policy in
that important area. But there
were also just enough gaffes to
keep alive the controversy that
had dogged him in recent weeks.
Like so much of U.S. foreign
policy, the trip began with a
simple concept and ballooned to
more complex, even exhaust
ing, proportions.
Peace process
Originally the journey was
designed to demonstrate U.S.
interest in the Middle East
peace process during the diplo
matic hiatus between the in
auguration of President Ronald
Reagan and the June 30 Israeli
national elections, which are ex
pected to define that country's
future leadership. One part of
the aim was to head off demands
for more dramatic American
activity, or a trip to Washington
by Israel's embattled prime
minister. Menachem Begin.
Once on the drawing board,
the trip also was seen as a
chance for Haig to try out his
concept of a loose anti-Soviet
"strategic consensus" embrac
ing the diverse and often war

ring group of states that are
America's main diplomatic and
military partners in the region:
Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia.
Stopovers
Onto this core of one-day vis
its to those four countries was
grafted a day in Spain to make
up for a harmful remark by
Haig in late February that an at
tempted military coup in Ma
drid was an "internal matter."
Also added was a British stop
over on the way home for rest,
fuel and a meeting requested by
Foreign Secretary Lord Peter
Carrington, who considers
himself a Middle East expert
and policy coordinator.
When the West Germans
heard Haig was stopping in Lon
don, they asked that the secre
tary of state make a visit to
Bonn, giving them equal status.
Haig agreed, but then could not
avoid an equal excursion to Par
is. especially since French
President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing is in a stiff battle for
re-election, and a flyover would
be interpreted as a U.S. snub.
The final dish in this
progressive supper was pasta,
added by request of an Italian
government that feels it has
often been unfairly excluded
from the U.S.-British-French-
German gentleman's club. Haig
made room for a three-hour air
port stopover in Rome last
Wednesday to meet Foreign
Minister Emilio Columbo.
Achievements
So what did it all accomplish?

So far as an accompanying re
porter can determine, the main
achievements were in the
Middle East, and these largely
involved the slaying of
hobgoblins.
• President Anwar Sadat of
Egypt, a leading practitioner of
personal diplomacy, was eager
for contact with the new secre
tary of state but seriously wor
ried about military rumbles
from Washington. Haig went to
great lengths to assure Sadat,
according to sources, that the
proposed Sinai peacekeeping
force in connection with next
year's Israeli withdrawal is not
a cover for an American Mid
east intervention force.
U.S. officials left Egypt be
lieving that Sadat will go along
with American participation in
a Sinai peacekeeping force
whose role is strictly limited.
Moreover, Sadat is believed
ready to permit regular U.S.
forces to use facilities at the
Egyptian base of Ras Banas on
the Red Sea, if Washington will
be content to seal this arrange
ment with only a handshake
rather than a formal agree
ment.

News analysis

• Prime Minister Begin and
his fellow leaders were happy
with the initial Israeli policy
orientation of the new adminis
tration, but worried by Wash
ington's simultaneous courtship
of Saudi Arabia. Haig's as
surance that Israel is a
"strategic asset" and central to
U.S. Mideast policy was just
what Jerusalem wanted to hear.
Gimmicks
On the other hand, not even an
extra $200 million in aid to Is
rael, via procurement gim
micks produced from Haig's kit
bag. reconciled the Israeli lead
ership to the U.S. sale of the
AWACS radar-surveillance
plane to the Saudis. Despite
Haig's pleas, the Israelis in
dicated they'll work hard
against the AWACS sale on
Capitol Hill.
• Jordan's King Hussein,
whose relations with Washing
ton sank to an all-time low dur
ing the last years of the Carter
administration, also sought to
restore his "personal rela
tionship with Washington."
Haig apparently succeeded in
doing so, aided by his rapport
with Hussein as a fellow mili
tary man. (But on the way out of
the area, Haig mistakenly re
ferred to the Jordanian king as
Hassan, the name of his younger
brother and crown prince.)
No deals
While reportedly happy with
Haig in private, Hussein made
repeatedly clear in public his re
fusal to join the Camp David
process or to negotiate a sepa
rate deal with Israel under a
"Jordanian option." In an em
barrassing incident, Jordanian
Foreign Minister Marwan al
Kassem took an anti-Israeli
stand before reporters and cam
eras just after Haig claimed to

have forged "a convergence of
views."
• The Saudi leadership, in the
mirror image of their nemesis,
were pleased with Washington's
initial policies toward their
country but wary of those
toward Israel. Haig told the
Saudis in strong terms that in
both cases "we stand by our
friends."
The Saudis, in private, are not
that unhappy with U.S.-Israeli
friendship if it holds the pros
pect of producing shifts in Is
raeli positions. And they were
greatly pleased by Haig's
statement of steadfastness
toward Saudi Arabia.
Anti-Soviet activism
Haig has said repeatedly in
public and private that the anti-
Soviet activism of the Reagan
administration is vital to repair
ing American fortunes in the
area. The regional leaders
seemed to approve a more vig
orous American role but at the
same time some of them, in
cluding the Saudis, were con
cerned in advance of Haig's ar
rival about how far, how fast,
the United States intended to
move toward confrontation
while its available resources
are still in doubt. Haig is re
ported to have been reassuring
on this point.
The least expected piece of
business Haig transacted — and
one of the most important —
was over the sudden surge of
fighting in Lebanon. In a flurry
of official notes and private
messages Haig appealed to such
diverse actors as Moscow and
the Vatican, Syria and Israel, to
help put down the fighting.
The diplomatic efforts seem
for the moment to have suc
ceeded in preventing the fight
ing from becoming uncon
trollable. But Haig did not help
himself or this effort when he
denounced Syrian "brutality"
from the steps of the Israeli
prime minister's office; that
sent tremors through the con
spiracy-prone Middle East.

friendship if it holds the pros
pect of producing shifts in Is
raeli positions. And they were
greatly pleased by Haig's
statement of steadfastness
toward Saudi Arabia.
Anti-Soviet activism
Haig has said repeatedly in
public and private that the anti-
Soviet activism of the Reagan
administration is vital to repair
ing American fortunes in the
area. The regional leaders
seemed to approve a more vig
orous American role but at the
same time some of them, in
cluding the Saudis, were con
cerned in advance of Haig's ar
rival about how far, how fast,
the United States intended to
move toward confrontation
while its available resources
are still in doubt. Haig is re
ported to have been reassuring
on this point.
The least expected piece of
business Haig transacted — and
one of the most important —
was over the sudden surge of
fighting in Lebanon. In a flurry
of official notes and private
messages Haig appealed to such
diverse actors as Moscow and
the Vatican, Syria and Israel, to
help put down the fighting.
The diplomatic efforts seem
for the moment to have suc
ceeded in preventing the fight
ing from becoming uncon
trollable. But Haig did not help
himself or this effort when he
denounced Syrian "brutality"
from the steps of the Israeli
prime minister's office; that
sent tremors through the con
spiracy-prone Middle East.
Snake pit
A public figure seeking to
avoid missteps would hardly
select the Middle East snake pit
for his first overseas journey.
Moreover, the setting, in cur
rent circumstances, was far re
moved from the main focus of
American and world attention
in Europe, where Defense Sec
retary Caspar Weinberger was
speaking and acting for the
United States on a previously
planned trip. By the time Haig
hit Europe, the Polish alarm
bells had diminished.
A European hobgoblin, as the
famous "senior official" told
reporters on the last leg of
Haig's trip, involved concern
about "repetitive threats on a
high level" regarding the situ
ation in Poland. The Europeans
"want to be careful," reporters
were told, and apparently Haig
does, too, believing that an over
emphasis on the threat of Soviet
military action might be a fac
tor in causing it to happen. In his
view the threat to Poland during
the past week never wait
beyond the political level.
Washington — Alexander
Haig's first overseas trip, an
eight-dav, nine-nation tour of
the Middle East and Western
Europe, ended in Bonn. West
Germany, Saturday, in neither
triumph nor disaster.
From all appearances, the
secretary of state managed a
predictable but solid start in the
Middle East on establishing the
personal and political rela
tionships essential to policy in
that important area. But there
were also just enough gaffes to
keep alive the controversy that
had dogged him in recent weeks.
Like so much of U.S. foreign
policy, the trip began with a
simple concept and ballooned to
more complex, even exhaust
ing, proportions.
Peace process
Originally the journey was
designed to demonstrate U.S.
interest in the Middle East
peace process during the diplo
matic hiatus between the in
auguration of President Ronald
Reagan and the June 30 Israeli
national elections, which are ex
pected to define that country's
future leadership. One part of
the aim was to head off demands
for more dramatic American
activity, or a trip to Washington
by Israel's embattled prime
minister. Menachem Begin.
Once on the drawing board,
the trip also was seen as a
chance for Haig to try out his
concept of a loose anti-Soviet
"strategic consensus" embrac
ing the diverse and often war

ring group of states that are
America's main diplomatic and
military partners in the region:
Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia.
Stopovers
Onto this core of one-day vis
its to those four countries was
grafted a day in Spain to make
up for a harmful remark by
Haig in late February that an at
tempted military coup in Ma
drid was an "internal matter."
Also added was a British stop
over on the way home for rest,
fuel and a meeting requested by
Foreign Secretary Lord Peter
Carrington, who considers
himself a Middle East expert
and policy coordinator.
When the West Germans
heard Haig was stopping in Lon
don, they asked that the secre
tary of state make a visit to
Bonn, giving them equal status.
Haig agreed, but then could not
avoid an equal excursion to Par
is. especially since French
President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing is in a stiff battle for
re-election, and a flyover would
be interpreted as a U.S. snub.
The final dish in this
progressive supper was pasta,
added by request of an Italian
government that feels it has
often been unfairly excluded
from the U.S.-British-French-
German gentleman's club. Haig
made room for a three-hour air
port stopover in Rome last
Wednesday to meet Foreign
Minister Emilio Columbo.
Achievements
So what did it all accomplish?

So far as an accompanying re
porter can determine, the main
achievements were in the
Middle East, and these largely
involved the slaying of
hobgoblins.
• President Anwar Sadat of
Egypt, a leading practitioner of
personal diplomacy, was eager
for contact with the new secre
tary of state but seriously wor
ried about military rumbles
from Washington. Haig went to
great lengths to assure Sadat,
according to sources, that the
proposed Sinai peacekeeping
force in connection with next
year's Israeli withdrawal is not
a cover for an American Mid
east intervention force.
U.S. officials left Egypt be
lieving that Sadat will go along
with American participation in
a Sinai peacekeeping force
whose role is strictly limited.
Moreover, Sadat is believed
ready to permit regular U.S.
forces to use facilities at the
Egyptian base of Ras Banas on
the Red Sea, if Washington will
be content to seal this arrange
ment with only a handshake
rather than a formal agree
ment.

News analysis

• Prime Minister Begin and
his fellow leaders were happy
with the initial Israeli policy
orientation of the new adminis
tration, but worried by Wash
ington's simultaneous courtship
of Saudi Arabia. Haig's as
surance that Israel is a
"strategic asset" and central to
U.S. Mideast policy was just
what Jerusalem wanted to hear.
Gimmicks
On the other hand, not even an
extra $200 million in aid to Is
rael, via procurement gim
micks produced from Haig's kit
bag. reconciled the Israeli lead
ership to the U.S. sale of the
AWACS radar-surveillance
plane to the Saudis. Despite
Haig's pleas, the Israelis in
dicated they'll work hard
against the AWACS sale on
Capitol Hill.
• Jordan's King Hussein,
whose relations with Washing
ton sank to an all-time low dur
ing the last years of the Carter
administration, also sought to
restore his "personal rela
tionship with Washington."
Haig apparently succeeded in
doing so, aided by his rapport
with Hussein as a fellow mili
tary man. (But on the way out of
the area, Haig mistakenly re
ferred to the Jordanian king as
Hassan, the name of his younger
brother and crown prince.)
No deals
While reportedly happy with
Haig in private, Hussein made
repeatedly clear in public his re
fusal to join the Camp David
process or to negotiate a sepa
rate deal with Israel under a
"Jordanian option." In an em
barrassing incident, Jordanian
Foreign Minister Marwan al
Kassem took an anti-Israeli
stand before reporters and cam
eras just after Haig claimed to

have forged "a convergence of
views."
• The Saudi leadership, in the
mirror image of their nemesis,
were pleased with Washington's
initial policies toward their
country but wary of those
toward Israel. Haig told the
Saudis in strong terms that in
both cases "we stand by our
friends."
The Saudis, in private, are not
that unhappy with U.S.-Israeli
friendship if it holds the pros
pect of producing shifts in Is
raeli positions. And they were
greatly pleased by Haig's
statement of steadfastness
toward Saudi Arabia.
Anti-Soviet activism
Haig has said repeatedly in
public and private that the anti-
Soviet activism of the Reagan
administration is vital to repair
ing American fortunes in the

seemed to approve a more vig
orous American role but at the

cluding the Saudis, were con

rival about how far, how fast,
the United States intended to
move toward confrontation
while its available resources
are still in doubt. Haig is re

was over the sudden surge of
