The toughest job
you'll lo^^
We admit it. It takes a different kind of person to be a Peace Corps Volunteer.
We won't mislead you with glowing pictures of exotic lands. The hours as a volun
teer are long. The pay is modest. And the frustrations sometimes seem overwhelming.
E3ut the satisfactions and rewards are immense. You'll be immersed in a new culture,
become fluent in a new language, and learn far more about yourself than you ever
expected.
You'll also discover that progress in the Peace Corps is measured in small accom
plishments. Such as rural health clinics established in Kenya. Irrigation systems built in
Upper Volta. Fresh-water fish ponds started in the Philippines.
The progress may seem modest, but to people in developing nations who have
never before had clean drinking water, basic A,
health care, or enough to eat, the Peace Corps Bjßj' 1[ j
brings a message of hope and change. H
We invite you to look into the volunteer A Jjjjj^/
opportunities beginning this year in 65
developing nations. See our representatives H
