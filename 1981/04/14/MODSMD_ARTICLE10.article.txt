# A 						'citizen politician' becomes Chief Executive: Ronald Reagan as the Chairman of the Board
## Former allies and antagonists from Reagan's term as Governor of California talk about the man, his Beverly Hills 'inner-circle,' and the 9-to-5 Chief Executive 
### 
This is the second and final installment of a
leadership profile of Ronald Reagan. The first
part traced the rise of Ronald Reagan, from
aging movie star and television host, to gov
ernor and now !'resident of the i'nited States.
Reagan's greatest strength has been as a mas
ter of the media. His leadership style has been
to irrite and dramatize the broad ideological
script while his staff provides the day-to-day
direction of government.
This week Reagan's closest aides and most
expe-ienced rivals describe (>ov. Reagan's
bitter relations with the California legislature
and the way he ran his own executive office as
the "Chairman of the Board. "
Many top aides from the Sacramento era
insist his habit of insulating himself from al
ternative views while endowing trusted aides
with extraordinary and unsupervised author
ity may generate grave group-think and ac
countability problems in the context of the
presidency.
[Resident Reagan came to Washington
with virtually the same "mandate" and set of
budget-slash-tax-cut promises to keep that
accompanied him to Sacramento in 1967. Al
though he kept very few promises during his
eight years as governor, Reagan will likely
transfer his 9-to-5 leadership style and public
relations priorities to the White House. The
following analysis, gleaned from scores of in
terviews with Reagan's top aides, former cab
inet secretaries, state legislative leaders and
journalists, should shed some light on the
making of policy at the White House today.
When Reagan first came to Sacra
mento. his closest political advisers
told him "you have a mandate, so forget the
legislature," according to George Steffes,
Reagan's legislative liaison and chief issues
adviser from 1967 to 1972. "If he picks advisers
again who tell him to rely on his mandate and
go directly to the people, we may all be in trou
ble." Steffes told me.
Steffes said Reagan later proved that he
could work well with the legislature, "but
there's a big IF — IF he is willing to get into
that world." He said if Reagan's eight years
as governor are any indication, "there will be
times he'll put in the effort and the personal
time necessary to work well with the legisla
tive body; then there'll be times when he gets
fed up and frustrated and starts thinking
'those guys are out to get me.' "
Michael Deaver. a top aide for 15 years who
some say became closest to the Reagans on a
personal basis, insists the conflicts were more

of style than substance. "Reagan was not one
of the boys. He didn't have a bottle to share
with them. He didn't play cards with the lob
byists. Ronald Reagan just wasn't that kind of
man He's a very private man."
Yet the nearly paralyzing enmity be
tween Reagan and the legislators from
both parties seemed a product less of style
than of conflicting personalities, attitudes and
ideologies. As a conservative, Reagan faced a
generally hostile and liberal Democratic ma
jority in the Assembly for six of his eight
years. To this he added antagonisms, such as
saying the Democratic leadership reminded
him of "a bunch of kids writing on a toilet
wall."
Since he left Sacramento, his daily radio
talk show and syndicated newspaper columns
have followed this same pattern, ridiculing
not only his old favorite targets — the federal

bureaucracy and the Supreme Court — but the
leadership of the U.S. House and Senate as
well.
"The big gulf between him and the legisla
ture was on a personal basis." said BobMoret
ti. Assembly speaker during Reagan's second
four years. "You know, they were the wealthy
socialites and we were the scum of theearth,"
Moretti said in an interview, visibly angered
as he recalled those years. "I always felt Mrs.
Reagan's attitude, at least hers, was that the
-legislators were common, unclean people
with whom she didn't want to dirty herself by
associating," he added. Moretti's view was
confirmed by two other legislative leaders,
one of whom said the Reagans' refusal to so
cialize outside their circle of Los Angeles en
tertainers and executives further poisoned
legislative relations.

Several aides blamed the administration's
early inability to communicate with the legis
lature or press on William Clark. Reagan's
first chief of staff whom he later appointed to
the California Supreme Court under a
hailstorm of criticism that Clark was un
qualified. Clark, who is resigning from the
Court to become deputy Secretary of State un
der Alexander Haig. had dropped out of Stan
ford and flunked out of Loyola University Law
School in Los Angeles, never finishing.
Clark, in an interview last February, said
Reagan did become very frustrated with his
legislative relations. He remembers, "it was
not easy to get him to go to legislative func
tions." and that the staff became concerned
because "he didn't recognize the legislators
and would get their names wrong. One night I
sat down with the legislative directory and
made prompt cards with the legislator's pic
ture on one side and the wife's and children's
names on the reverse."
Part of the problem stems from Reagan's
aloofness and his obsession with privacy and
security. Even some among his former top
aides refer to his first term as the "Imperial
Governorship."

While reporters and legislators often wan
dered through the open door to chat with Pat
Brown. Reagan hired hulking body guards and
set up a state police checkpoint in the ex
ecutive suite. He abhors informal questioning
by the press or debate with legislators, prefer
ring the controlled environment of a formal
press conference or prepared statement.
Reagan proposed little legislation and
passed even less, preferring to adopt bills pro
posed by representatives from either party,
sometimes to their surprise. This frustrated
Republicans, particularly when they held a
majority in both houses from 1968 to 1970, but
then lost it while Reagan won reelection.
Yet Reagan's 1970 campaign promises and
his desire to build a record upon which to base
a presidential campaign in 1976, compelled
him to improve relations and become more
aggressive during his second term. His new
chief of staff. Edwin Meese 111, who today
plays the same role as prime minister that he
did during Reagan's second term, was greatly

responsible for giving legislators and the
press greater access and respect during the
final three Sacramento years.
Although Reagan called his Secretary of Fi
nance. Casper ("Cap the Knife" > Weinberger.
"Mv Disraeli." it is Meese who legislators in
sist ran the state government while Reagan
worked short hours and spent much of his time
politicking out-of-state However, when asked
how much personal input Reagan had on the
budget process. Weinberger, who left the Rea
gan administration to become Nixon's budget
director and is now secretary of defense, said
Reagan "stayed with it throughout the proc
ess and took an interest in the budget that Mr
Nixon never had."
Less heralded was Reagan's performance
as a capable (if aloof > administrator who ra
tionalized the lines of authoritv in the ex-

you all agree."

ecutive branch and utilized his cabinet to a re
markable degree.
Major policy decisions from every depart
ment, including and especially the budget,
were debated by the full cabinet. Consensus
was the ideal, but Reagan generally took the
debates as advisory and made the final de
cision after conferring with top personal aides
like Deaver. Meese, Clark, Hannaford and
Nofziger. "Mini-memos" were prepared for
all issues requiring the governor's attention,
giving him a summary of the problem, the
facts, several options, and a recommended
solution.
Though some commentators satirized this
"government by mini-memo," the format fit
Reagan's stated desire to function as a "chair
man of the board." He could quickly review
the facts of an issue and simply initial "OK—
RR" next to his choice.
Political director Deaver told me President
Heagan will rely on tils cabinet "more than
any president in recent times." He said,
"there will be only about three personal staff
of importance who will be ex officio cabinet
members." Presumably the new palace
guard is the same as before — Meese, Deaver
and Nofziger. Watch for these three to freeze
out James Baker, Bush's campaign manager
who was given the title of White House Chief
of Staff, though apparently with little of the
power possessed bv past staff chiefs like
Haldeman and Jordan.
While most of the old Sacramento
hands lavishly praise Reagan's
judgment and calm under pressure, several
said they worry about his frequent failure to
seek alternative viewpoints. Reagan often let
his top staff isolate him from important con
stituencies — the press, interest groups, and
legislators especially — and they sometimes
exploited his willingness to delegate ex
traordinary authority to a small circle of
aides who gained his trust.
Several top aides agreed the potential for
abuse crept in because whoever wrote the
mini-memos often controlled the policy out
comes by default. The decisions were often ul
tradistilled and according to former aides.
Reagan would rarely invite outside opinions
or send the staff back to the drawing board for
new options.
"The great danger is that he (Reagan as
president) will become a prisoner of the peo
ple around him," said Steffes. confiding his
regret that he and a few others tightened the
circle around Reagan during the first term,
partially to enhance their own influence.
"If you thought Nixon had a closed door.
Reagan built more walls around him as gov
ernor and would do the same thing as presi
dent." said a former Republican legislative
leader who preferred anonymity. "He
wouldn't have a chance to talk to people with
diverse views, he didn't have adequate in
formation, and consequently he made many
mistakes."
Others among Reagan's cabinet and per
sonal staff admitted that group-think situ
ations often occurred with the best of inten
tions, because most of the staff would follow
the lead of key aides like Deaver or Meese and
the governor would concur with little ques
tioning.
Most agree there was a shared instinct to
"protect Ronnie." particularly in the begin
ning, but that the barriers slowly came down
and the decision-making process improved as
it became more open during the second term
Cabinet members and top aides also de
scribe what they call Reagan's "ex
traordinary" penchant for delegating his
power and authority to subordinates. Accord
ing to Tom Reed. Reagan's first appointments
secretary, chairman of his 1970 campaign and
recent organizer of the "independent" com
mittee to elect Reagan president. "He's
startling in the way he's willing to delegate
things. The trouble is that power devolves to
whomever can elbow his way into the inner
circle."
When I asked Reed how far Reagan's re
liance on his personal aides stretched, he of
fered an unlikely example. "If there had been
a staff consensus that in California water
flowed uphill, there was a feeling he's say.
'OK fellows, if you all agree.' " Another top

aide. who preferred anonymity, said "Reagan
does have a tendency to take things given to
him (by the staff ion pure faith.' This is one
reason his speeches are littered with inac
curacies — if an aide or trusted publication is
wrong, then Reagan is wrong
However. Meese said that there was an in
formal agreement not to "take advantage of
Reagan, and it was followed for the most
part."
Nevertheless, the influence and apparent
arrogance of Reagan's inner circle often ir
ritated even the four department secretaries
who sat on the cabinet and for a time were
called 'deputy governors ' Secretary of
Health and Welfare James Hall said that
"there was friction on a regular basis between
the agency secretaries and their personal
staffs, and the personal staff of the governor
Reagan also had a peculiar aversion to dis
agreements or conflict. The demand for unity
within the administration was adhered to. but
many complained that it often prefaced rea
sonable debate. Speaker Monagan said that
once Reagan made up his mind on an issue, he
refused to discuss it with legislators for fear
he might be persuaded or forced to make a
commitment.

Another reason Reagan delegated authority
and neglected oversight was that he really
was a 9-to-5 governor His aides say he had the
stamina to work into the night if necessary,
but he believed in separating his commit
ments to work and family. Paul Haerle. his
appointments secretary who supported Ford
as chairman of the California Republican par
ty in 1976. said that while opponents question
Reagan's age (he is 70). "age is only a factor.
He was essentially a 9-to-5 governor. He does
not have the executive work habits necessary
to be a good president."
Keeping the boss rested has been a primary
concern for his handlers since the day in 1966
when an overtired Reagan blew up before a
black audience and stomped off the podium,
yelling that his opposition to the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 did not mean that he is a racist.
"He doesn't hold up well." campaign man
ager Bill Roberts admitted to reporters after
the 1966 campaign, when Reagan was 55 years
old. "Give him three or four days of three or
four meetings in a row and he gets real ir
ritable." Roberts added.
According to a reporter who covers Rea
gan. he frequently took compensation time
the next morning if a budget cutting session or
speech required overtime. Part of this was
due to his possibly over-protective wife Nan
cy. who many aides say had an unusual in
fluence on Reagan's work habits and per
sonnel decisions, though probably not on poli

described a paradox of the ex-actor's myth:
"He is a reactor, not an actor " Roberts does
not believe Reagan is a real leader and he
phrased negatively what several other former
top aides characterized as traits having mixed
effects on ultimate policy "Whether or not
he's a good president will depend entirely on
how competent the people are around him If
you bring him a plan he'll critique it well and
choose an option, but he'll never give the or
ders or devise the plan. He's a coun
terpuncher He is not at the creative end but at
the reactive end. He's always been that way
and always will because that is how his
thought processes work "
Paradoxically, while Democrats sought to
revive the "Vietnam syndrome" with tales of
Cowboy Ron's bellicose instincts. Reagan
aides say his overall grasp of issues and his
propensity to delegate unlimited powers and
become isolated by his top staff are far more
important concerns According to Steffes,
"It's a gut feeling, but I have a great faith in
him not reacting irrationally or unreasonably.
The man just absolutely will not crack under
stress situations. That's my opinion after five
years."
Democratic Speaker Moretti, Pat Brown,

John Burton, a longtime legislative leader in
Sacramento and former congressman, and
others said Reagan's most irritating and
divisive political tactic was picking out a
scapegoat to blame for fundamental state
problems he found were immune to his brand
of "simple answers."
When Reagan lambasted the "spendthrift"
legislature to prepare the people for yet an
other huge tax rate increase in 1971 that he
himself would propose i during Reagan's eight
years state taxes increased $21.3 billion in
constant dollars, spending doubled and Cali
fornia's per capita tax burden also doubled
from $244 64 to $488.19), Moretti stated: "The
governor is attempting again to sell rhetoric
and to sell form rather than substance. . . .
Rut that damned legislature' or 'that damn
federal government,' or 'those damn state
employees,' or whoever he chooses to make
the scapegoat for this issue, will be blamed for
the tax increase, when everybody knew all
along that it's absolutely necessary." And
taxes did increase. Reagan's assurances dur
ing the 1970 campaign to the contrary.
Reagan's stock campaign speech during the
1980 primaries seemed to strike a responsive
chord in mainstream America, particularly
among older folks. "If I can sum up why I am
running for president, it is so that someday
these voung people could know the freedoms
that you and I knew when we were young and

Reagan often let his top staff isolate him from important
constituencies and they sometimes exploited his willingness to
delegate extraordinary authority to a small circle of aides who
gained his trust. Most of the staff would follow the lead of
Meese or Heaver and the governor would concur with little
(fu estioning.

cy. Haerle said Nancy Reagan would call the
office and complain to Meese and others that
they were "working Ronnie too hard "
Much is written about Reagan's in
tellect. or lack thereof. According to
Tom Reed. Reagan's photographic memory
and quickness on his feet have been his secret
to success both in Hollywood and politics.
"He's far and away the sharpest most reten
tive mind I have ever met," Reed added,
"though that's not the same thing as in
tellect." Other aides agreed that while Rea
gan is a quick-study and a good judge if given
adequate options, he is not an innovative or a
probing thinker
