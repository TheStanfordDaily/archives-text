# The 						Stanford Daily Opinions
## Viewpoint Endorse Daily assessment 
### 
This year, as in previous years, the Dai
ly is seeking a three-quarter. $l-per-quar
ter fee assessment.
The assessment is, in fact, a bulk sub
scription fee. The Daily, unlike many oth
er college newspapers, is distributed free
of charge; it seems reasonable to ask stu
dents to pay a nominal price — approx
imately two cents per issue — to read the
paper. In much the same way. the Univer
sity pays us a block subscription fee for
the copies the faculty and staff use.
Yet even this minimal charge would not
be justified if the Daily were making a
large profit. We are not. While we did
show a profit for several years, the money
was stored in a reserve fund that we used
to make needed capital improvements and
to buffer us against business contractions
such as the one we are now experiencing.

This year, we expect to be within a few
thousand dollars of the break-even point —
a dangerous situation for a business with
annual revenues of $500,000. Without the
fee assessment money and the Univer
sity's subscription fee, we would have
been in the red by about $40,000.
We will still be making loan payments
on our recent capital investments for an
other 2 1 2 years. The assessment will
enable us to continue providing the Stan
ford community with local, national and
international news coverage that we con
stantly are trying to improve and with ser
vices such as an opinions forum and Once
Around the Quad.
Please vote yes on the Daily fee
assessment tomorrow and Thursday.
