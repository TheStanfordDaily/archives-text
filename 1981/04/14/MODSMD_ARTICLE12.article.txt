## Graduate candidates endorsed 
### 
Yesterday, we published our endorse
ment of undergraduate ASSU Senate can
didates. The responses of those not en
dorsed will appear in tomorrow's Daily.
Only two graduate candidates solicited
the Daily's support, but we feel that both
of them are worthy of election and would
be qualified, effective senators.
James McGrath
McGrath. a computer science student
with an impressive history of involvement
in the student input process at the Univer
sity, is refreshing in the reasoned ap
proach he has to the issues â€” not adopting
catchy poster positions on tired issues, but

speaking thoughtfully on those same top
ics. such as campus safety, graduate stu
dent stipends, housing the grading system
and the increasingly inadequate comput
ing facilities here.
Dennis Romero
Romero, a first-year law student who
spent his undergraduate years here, too, is
an articulate speaker on many of the prob
lems that confront the University, such as
graduate and undergraduate housing. He
has become well-acquainted with the Uni
versity over the past five years, and his in
volvements in various Chicano and other
activities have prepared him well for a
senate post.
