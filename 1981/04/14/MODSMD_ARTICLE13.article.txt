Constitutional amendment —
Yes
The Daily supports the proposal for dis
tricting of graduate student represent
atives to the ASSU Senate for a number of
reasons related to the nature of graduate
life.
The proposal would institute a new sys
tem of graduate voting whereby repre
sentatives would be elected by the aca
demic area in which they are enrolled.
This would increase the ability of gradu

ate senators to represent the specific
needs of students in particular depart
ments (say, law. physics, or history). It
would also facilitate greater senator ac
countability because the majority of inter
student contact among graduates takes
place not in residence life (as among un
dergrads) but within their specific depart
ments of study.
Given the traditional weakness of grad
uate participation in the ASSU Senate, the
districting proposal is definitely worth a
trv.
