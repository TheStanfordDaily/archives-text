We urge readers of the Daily to vote this
Wednesday and Thursday in favor of a one-quar
ter. $1 fee assessment for Volunteers in Asia. Here
are some of the reasons why:
— This year, over 50 VIA volunteers are work
ing at 34 indigenous institutins in seven East and
Southeast Asian nations — Japan. Korea, the Peo
ple's Republic of China. Taiwan, the Philippines.
Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. Forty more people are
currently taking classes and doing individual
study to prepare for VIA post starting this sum
mer.
— VIA volunteers, working in English
teaching, development reportage, and ap
propriate technology, help provide Asian institu
tions with access they might not otherwise have to
a worldwide body of information, idea, and opin
ion in the English language.
— As an overseas educational experience. VIA
is unique on this campus. It is the only way for a
sizeable number of Stanford students to go to the
non-Western world with a work role and a family
in a local community. This extraordinary op
portunity for cross-cultural learning in an Asian
setting sets VIA apart from the campus-based
"Stanford enclaves" of the University's overseas
programs.
— Participatin in VIA is open to both graduate
students and undergraduates.
In addition to these opportunities, there are sig
nificant "spin-off" benefits from VlA's volunteer
programs. Returnees bring first-hand per

spectives on Asian neighborhoods and nations
back to their classes, seminars, discussion sec
tions. and jobs. Students from departments all
over campus make use of VlA's Asia travel and
appropriate technology publications collections.
VIA has become an informal "clearing house"
in touch with a wide variety of local people shar
ing interests in Third World development topics
and village technology. VIA returnees and staff
share experiences and insights through slide
shows, panel discussions, and participation in
SWOPSI seminars and classes like EDGE (Ethics
of Development in a Global Environment). VIA
helps to sponsor occasional speakers and films on
current topics as pressing as the Khmer refugees
in Thailand, and as general as the challenges fac
ing the fledgling Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
Yesterday, the Daily recommended a no vote
on the VIA fee assessment, suggesting that the
program annually involves only about 45 people.
This is a serious under-representation of VlA's
impact on the community. Through its campus
wide recruitment meetings alone, hundreds of us
are challenged to consider an experience living
and working in Asia, and to re-evaluate the course
of our formal education. VIA is a resource which
merits the support of the student community as a
whole. Please join us in voting for the fee
assessment this week.
