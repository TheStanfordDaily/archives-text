# Unendorsed slate responds
## 
### 
The members of the H & C slate, running for the
Council of Presidents, would like this space so
that we may discuss our candidacy. We feel that
the most important role of the Council of Presi
dents is one of management. As the leaders of
Stanford's largest and most complex organiza
tions. the COP must be able to creatively and effi
ciently manage, monitor, and motivate the stu
dents.
We strongly believe that we have the ex
perience and capabilities to handle this position.
Stamats has been active as the treasurer for
STARTS. Rothberg as a senator while at George
Washington. Kessler as a leader in the ASSU Pub
lications Board, and Wilkins as editor of The
Stanford Chaparral. We have learned from meet
ing with the current COP members that any rela
tive lack of ASSU experience suffered on our part
will in no way impair our effectiveness as COP
members. In fact, they have pledged their help in
making sure that we are fully cognizant of all
ASSU activity.
The Daily has based its support for the Greene
slate on such proposals as changing the name of
the position from 'COP' to 'ASSU Presidents,' a
move which seems cosmetic at best. The Cabinet

proposed by the Greene slate, and endorsed by the
Daily is very similar in nature to a proposal
enacted by the Petroll et al. COP of some years
back It ended amidst a confusion of apathy and
mismanagement.
Nowhere in the Daily endorsement, and no
where in the Greene platform is made any men
tion of the problem of insuring that economically
disadvantaged youth, specifically minorities, are
given a chance to attend Stanford. With the pro
posed government cuts in financial aid, and sky
rocketing tuition, these people simply cannot af
ford to go here. We will work to secure donations
from the private sector, specifically the for
mation of corporate scholarships, in an attempt to
solve this problem. Similarly, the Greene slate
makes no mention of the problem of crime on
campus.
With this in mind, we feel that we should be
elected, and must respectfully disagree with the
Daily's COP endorsement.
