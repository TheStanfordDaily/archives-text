## Patriotism and the success of the Right 
### 
Of all the political jokes I've
heard over the years, the follow
ing seems to capture the true
ambiguity of the American pa
triotic spirit:
Two guys are sitting in a bar
talking about politics and one
raises his glass and trium
phantly exclaims. "My country
right or wrong!" The other
looks at him perplexed and re
sponds. "What do you mean
wrong?"
In no other country is this am
biguity more apparent than in
the United States. But whatever
the ambiguities of the meaning
of true patriotism, it seems
clear that the Right in Ameri
can politics has successfully
garnered the image of the pro
tector and promoter of the true
patriotic spirit. Has it not been
one of the major precepts of the
right wing establishment in this
country that one of the major
reasons for the decline in Amer
ican power over the past 25
years is the decline of patriotic
spirit among the American peo
ple?
In his inaugural address to the
nation President Ronald Rea
gan called for a period of "na
tional renewal." implying that
all we really need to get the
United States back on top
domestically and international
ly is a simple rekindling of the
American patriotic spirit and
creative genius. But this rally
call to the American patriotic
spirit has not only been a staple
of the Right: it has been an inte
gral part of the message of ev
ery moderate president since
the beginning of the Cold War.
From Truman and Eisenhower,
at the height of the Cold War,
through the Kennedy and John
son years of the Vietnam War
era to Nixon and Carter of De
tente, the American patriotic
ethic has united all of these
presidents where their
domestic policies have differed.
The minimal terms of this pa
triotism are all too familiar: the
belief in the moral superiority
of the American way, the will to
maintain the status quo at
almost any price, and an
aversion to all revolutionary
movements, especially those
which might contain a lurking
element of communism. In
fact, the only major party can
didate ever to run for President
who fundamentally challenged
this traditional Cold War patri
otism, George McGovern, was
soundly defeated, even with the
memory of the debacle of Viet
nam fresh in the minds of the
American people.
In the past 30 years, and espe

cially in the last election, every
U.S. politician has been acutely
>aware of the danger of being
vulnerable to the charge of
"softness" on communism.
Although the influence of
Rightist philosophy diminished
significantly in terms of
domestic economic policy in the
'60s. its influence has been de
termining in foreign policy.
While the Right has had a de
termining political influence on
moderates, the Left, after brief
ly surfacing in the '60s. has been
forced to sit on the sidelines. In
creasingly. the voices of the
Left seem to be distant cries in
the wilderness to which the
American public is turning deaf
ears. There is no need to belabor
the obvious, the central question
is why?
The Right has always had an
easier time gaining influence
because of stylistic appeal to the
American public and directness
of its arguments. Rightist politi
cians barrage the public with
simple answers to complex
problems which anyone can un
derstand. They often exude con
fidence and conviction because
they are thoroughly convinced
th'at their views are right while
all others are wrong.
They have a concrete enemy
in the Soviet Union, whose evil
designs they say we must con
tain. They see the United States
as fulfilling a historic mission to
protect the free world (a
laudable end which justifies any
means) thus giving the Ameri
can people a sense of purpose. In
their perspective, the U.S. is
seen as ethically and intellec
tually superior to all other coun
tries. especially to all third
world countries. Rightist for
mulas both flatter the American
people and give them a sense of
purpose.
But the Left does not have a
concrete enemy. Leftist politi
cians constantly point out that
we are often our own worst ene
my. Unlike the Right, genuine
leftist politicians have an
aversion to simplistic formulas
to complex problems. There is
no end which dwarfs the means
which we may use to realize that
end.
The U.S. is not seen as an ethi
cal and intellectual superior of
all countries but rather as a
more fortunate but ethical and
intellectual equal to them. The
Left neither flatters the Ameri
can people nor gives them a
unique historic mission.
Moreover leftist politicians of
fer historical lessons which are
difficult to understand and do
not offer a clear and simple path

to follow for the future.
The Right has enjoyed (just
as orthodox communist move
ments in other countries) all the
short-term political advantages
of thinking in absolute terms. It
is easier intellectually to see the
world in black and white terms.
It is more comforting to believe
in a man who exudes conviction
and who thinks he has all the an
swers. (Reagan is the perfect
example.) And finally it is more
flattering to believe that your
country has a unique historic
mission to fulfill.
However, the political advan
tages which the Right enjoys in
its stylistic appeal to the Ameri
can public in general is not
enough to totally explain its suc
cess since the beginning of the
Cold War. If this were true, we
would have to assume that
Americans are intellectual idi
ots incapable of observing the
increasing complexity of both
the international system and of
the domestic economy.
The key to the success of
rightist philosophy over mod
erate political forces within this
country is due to two widely
held misconceptions on the na
ture of American patriotism: I)
The Right has the deserving
claim to the American patriotic
spirit, while the Left being over
ly critical of the homeland
which, after all. still allows it to
speak out, is anti-patriotic. 2)
Being patriotic means being
morally superior because patri
ots are more loyal to the institu
tions which make America
"great": the family, free en
terprise, obedience, and unabid
ing respect for the law.
But are the above institutions
the real source of American
greatness? This brand of Ameri
can patriotism appealing to
blind obedience of authority is
neither laudable nor original.
Tyrants and despots have
always invoked it to realize the
most imperialistic of goals.
From Napoleon to Hitler, peo
ple have succumbed time and
again to this patriotism of
monolithic madness.
Yet has American patriotism
traditionally been synonymous
with blind obedience to author
ity. in spite of the politics of that
authority? Is there not another
kind of American patriotism

historically rooted in American
political tradition which has re
fused blind acceptance of au
thority. defended human rights
and individual civil liberties
with only the idea of human
dignity and human solidarity as
its guiding principle?
From Susan B. Anthony to
Martin Luther King, there have
been many representatives of
this enlightened American pa
triotism which has a tradition as
long as the history of the United
States itself. Might we not call
this the traditional American
patriotism of dissent estab
lished in the first days of the
American revolution, the patri
otism which has always main
tained there arc limits to au
thorityt This patriotism, alone,
has distinguished the United
States from other capitalist
countries over the years. It is
largely responsible for the
American tradition of basic de
fense of civil liberties, the bill of
rights, in a word, the only real
sources of American greatness.
But the misconception still
reigns in the piinds of a majori
ty of Americans. The RAghV has
successfully (if unjustly) laid
claim to the American patriotic
spirit. Yet. it has only involved
the patriotism of blind na
tionalism whose distorted
terms are only too familiar
Clearly it is now up to the Left to
make the distinction to the
American people between the
vulgar patriotism of blind na
tionalism and the moral patri
otism of human dignity.
Unless the American Left can
recapture the claim to the true
American patriotic spirit from
the distorting grasp of the right
wing ideologues, then it will
always be relegated to the
classrooms of the university â€”
very far from the power center
in Washington, D C. The conse
quences are great: the very es
sence of traditional American
progressive thought will be
threatened by the Right in the
1980s; its very survival will de
pend upon how it meets that
challenge. If the Left refuses to
accept this challenge, some day
it will not even find a home in
the university either.
