Chalk one for Phil
We'd just like to thank Philip
Chalk for his wonderfully funny
cartoon, "SAC in the box." In ail
sincerity, it was one of the best
responses to our "radical" ac
tion that we received. Tasteful
humor, at last!
Unfortunately we were not in
terviewed for the Daily article
concerning the "induction" no
tices; and would therefore like
to take this chance to observe
that, in our opinion, the tremen
dous time and energy required
in mailing the 3000 letters was
well worth the effort. The
project succeeded beyond our
wildest expectations. We were
sure only a few would take the
messages seriously, let alone,
believe that this cheap, bulk
mailed letter could have actual
ly arrived from such a rich and
resourceful institution as the
Selective Service. The over
whelming reaction We received
indicated that people are, in
deed. concerned about the issue,
and are aware of the dangers it
contains for them personally.
Just one thing. Philip Chalk:

We're too non-violent to slap
people, it's not "dirty" work,
and everybody's got to do it.

Trust own mind?
Why does everyone assume
that intellectuality is opposed to
practicality? That reading phi
losophy is mutually exclusive of
looking for a job?
Dualism, everyone is hung up
on dualism. Personally, I'd
rather think and read philoso
phy than pay a corporate ana
lyst $75 an hour to find out
what's going on in my life. But
I'm just being practical and
philosophical (i.e., trusting my
own mind).
