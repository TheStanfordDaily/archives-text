## T-Birds are fabulous, if not flashy, at the Old Waldorf 
### Pat O'Bannon 
I'd like to start by thanking Eric Clapton for
getting an ulcer and cancelling his most re
cent tour Because of this charitable act. The
Fabulous Thunderbirds — who were going to
open for Clapton — headlined two shows at the
Old Waldorf last Friday
The T-Birds are a four-piece band out of
Austin. Texas who play the type of driving
energetic blues which Clapton made famous
during his days with the Yardbirds. and which
he abandoned i after shaking his heroin habit >
in favor of the ultra-mellow pablum found on
his flaccid, recent albums
Critics, sensing a trend in the renewed in
terest in classic blues, have branded the T-
Birds' music "blue wave Categories are
convenient, but there's no "wave" to what the
T-Birds play , it's simply blues — hot. sweaty,
and best heard in a club where the bandstand
looms fuzzy through a haze of tobacco smoke
and the smell of beer hangs in the air like a wet

woolen blanket
The T-Birds transformed the Old Waldorf, a
detestable room where they squeeze you in
like passengers on a Japanese commuter
train, into just this sort of blues dive last Fri
day Using material from all three of their
albums, including the new "Butt Rockin."
the T-Birds' set ranged widely between slow
blues. '50s style rock n' roll, old R&B. and a
few certifiable raveups They carried the au
dience through the peaks and valleys of mood
and tempo changes with deceptive ease But
the non-capacitv crowd of racous enthusiasts
helped, shouting encouragement and ap
preciation. and even dancing in the aisles on
occasion
George Thorogood is the most widely
known of the current crop of blues "re
vivalists His live shows, which have justly
received a lot of attention, are pushed along
more by his stage moves — leg kicks. Chuck
Berry duck-walks, and leaps into the crowd —

than by the music. Not so with the T-Birds.
who eschew any attempt at flash, preferring
to maintain their cool while letting the music
speak for itself This isn't to say that they lack
stage presence or hold themseives aloof from
the crowd: rather that they don't seem to see
any need to pander Thorogood has a tendency
to fall into guitar-hero cliches The T-Birds
play.
Despite having only four members, the T-
Birds sound like a six or seven piece band
Guitarist Jimmie Vaughan and vocalist and
harmonica player Kim Wilson are the front
men. but the rhythm section of Fran Chris
tiana. a DeNiro look-alike on drums, and
Keither Ferguson, a bass player with wall-to
wall tatoos and greased-back garage mechan
ic hair, provide them with the solid backing
they need
Vaughan hasn't an ounce of Thorogood
showman in him He looks as if he just
crawled down from the cab of his daddy's

John Deere, with work shirt sleeves rolled to
the shoulder, hair greased into a DA. except
for a stray lick falling down his forehead, and
his initials stuck on his guitar with those gold
and black appliques you see on rural mailbox
es But he can play. Except for the obligatory
"now I'll play it behind my back" solo, which
he seemed a bit embarassed over. Vaughan
skipped the theatrics and simply stepped into
the spotlight and wrung the notes out of his
Stratocaster He's obviously listened to a lot
of that other great Texas blues guitarist, the
late Freddie King, but he also shows plenty of
his own style. He has to play both rhythm and
lead with the T-Birds. a chore he manages
without apparent effort, sounding distinct in
each role While his solos ring crisp and pre
cise. his rhythm playing is choppy and thick,
growling out of the amps like a chainsaw,
Wilson shares the front of the stage with
Vaughan. and sings the blues well enough,
with perfect phrasing and plenty of intensity.

though his voice seems thin at times. This a
potential problem since none of the other
band members sing and Wilson's voice has to
carry all of the vocal duties. His strong point
is his harmonica playing, expressive and pow
erful in the tradition of Little Walter and other
blues harp legends Wilson uses the harmon
ica to augment his singing: pleading, coaxing,
and demanding with the instrument. Like
Vaughan. he doesn't bother to try and impress
you with his stage manner, he just maintains
his bluesman's cool.
Having a good time is what The Fabulous
Thunderbirds are all about They'll never be
rock stars. Their brand of raw gutsy blues just
isn't going to race to the top of the charts, and
anyway they don't look the part with their
greased hair, pencil thin mustaches, and no —
frills stage manner. They seem to say. "If you
like us great; if not. go home." At the Old
Waldorf last Friday nobody went home until
the show was over
