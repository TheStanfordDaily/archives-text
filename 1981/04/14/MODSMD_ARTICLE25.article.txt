# 'Three Sisters': ACT does okay, and that's not bad
## 
### Tom Casciato 
Not bad. You got Anton
Chekhov. One of the greats. And
he's got this play with three sis
ters. The first one's named
Olga. and she has to deliver
lines like these: "It's exactly a
year ago today since Father
died... your name-day, Irina. It
was very cold then, and snow
ing. I thought I'd never get over
it and you actually passed out...
But now a year's gone by and we
don't mind talking about it any
m0re...1 remember the band
playing when they took father to
the cemetery, and they fired a
salute. He was a general, com
manded a brigade. All the same,
not many people came — it was
a wet day of course, with heavy
rain and sleet." That's an ex
cerpt from Olga's opening
speech. It's a hard speech to de
liver — how do you recite this
series of past events without
making it sound like a shopping
list 9 — in a really hard play to
perform. But DeAnn Mears.
who plays Olga in ACT's current
production of The Three Sis
ters, gets through it gracefully,
and after the first few minutes,
you realize you just might have
a cast who can do justice to the
play.
You got Tom Moore. He
directed (Urease on Broadway.
Big success. Also Frankenstein.
Big flop. Moore has a nasty hab

it of grouping the sisters in. con
veniently. threes, as if the au
dience would otherwise forget
they are The Three Sisters. And
you have to wonder about his
sense of tempo; the pace drags
after intermission, and he in
cludes an entire song in the
fourth act of a long play when a
single verse would have filled
the script's requirement. But he
knows what the play is about:
frustration, loss, aging — life,
really. And his interpretation is
impeccable.
Until the end. Here, you got
melodrama where you need un
derstatement. As the action
comes to a close, the three sis
ters, clutching at each other in a
clump center-stage, gaze up
into the cheap seats and wonder
what it was all about.
As for the sisters themselves,
Olga, the eldest, teaches school
and longs to leave her life of pro
vincial boredom for the exciting
city of the sisters' birth: Mos
cow. DeAnn Mears plays the
role with quiet frustration, in
startling contrast to the
boisterous (read, "loud") style
of Barbara Dirickson, who plays
little sister Irina.
Now. it's good to have con
trast between the eldest and
youngest. Olga is old enough to
know the sisters may never
make it back to Moscow; Irina
is shocked when she realizes
they are not leaving, and that

she is wasting her youth away.
But where Mears understates
the tragedy. Dirickson makes it
ridiculous Twisting her face
into an exaggerated frown and
whining in the best Lucy
Ricardo tradition, she turns a
sad moment into one of uninten
tional comedy.
Masha, the middle sister, is
played by old ACT hand Eliz
abeth Huddle with wit and
charm. Masha. too. is frus
trated; she's married to a dull,
obsequious school teacher
(nicely portrayed by Michael
Winters), and she spends her
life wearing black dresses and
lounging around the house recit
ing little verses until she meets
up with Lieutenant-colonel Ver
shinin (Peter Donat). Masha
and Vershinin have an affair,
but when his army unit is trans
ferred. Masha is left with her
sisters and husband, finally de
termining it is best to keep
struggling, even if she isn't sure
there is anything left to struggle
for.
Huddle handles the transition
from tired homebody to aroused
lover (Masha and Vershinin
hum little tunes to each other
when they're feeling particular
ly libidinous) with ease; she.
more than any other member of
the cast, seems to understand
the delicate balance Chekhov
has established between trag

edy and comedy
You got a bunch of other peo
ple. too. Chekhov's best plays do
not concern a main character,
rather everyone is both pro
tagonist and antagonist, with
characters countering one an
other's lines with pointed argu
ments or hilarious mm se
quiturs. As with most ACT
shows, the ensemble is uneven
Joseph Bird is funny and sad
dening as the aged Ferapont. a
near-deaf servant in the sisters'
household, while Mimi Carr is
unbelievable as Anfisa. the
eighty year old nurse. Sally
Smvthe misses the comedy of
Natasha, the sisters' sister-in
law; Natasha is a shrill bitch,
but she is played with so little
sense of distance that it is the
actress, not the character, who
comes off bitchy On the other
hand. Bruce Williams, as
Solvony. perfectly captures the
contradictions of the nervously
witty and potentially explosive
captain, a basically malad
justed (yet not totally dis
agreeable) fellow who, unable
to win Irina's love, eventually
kill's her fiance in a duel.
Overall, you got a play worth
seeing here. ACT's production
of The Three Sisters is uneven,
but Chekhov is hard to perform,
and even if this cast and director
do not do him total justice, they
come close. And that's not bad.

ridiculous Twisting her face
into an exaggerated frown and
whining in the best Lucy
Ricardo tradition, she turns a
sad moment into one of uninten
tional comedy.
Masha, the middle sister, is
played by old ACT hand Eliz
abeth Huddle with wit and
charm. Masha. too. is frus
trated; she's married to a dull,
obsequious school teacher
(nicely portrayed by Michael
Winters), and she spends her
life wearing black dresses and
lounging around the house recit
ing little verses until she meets
up with Lieutenant-colonel Ver
shinin (Peter Donat). Masha
and Vershinin have an affair,
but when his army unit is trans
ferred. Masha is left with her
sisters and husband, finally de
termining it is best to keep
struggling, even if she isn't sure
there is anything left to struggle
for.
Huddle handles the transition
from tired homebody to aroused
lover (Masha and Vershinin
hum little tunes to each other
when they're feeling particular
ly libidinous) with ease; she.
more than any other member of
the cast, seems to understand
the delicate balance Chekhov
has established between trag

edy and comedy
You got a bunch of other peo
ple. too. Chekhov's best plays do
not concern a main character,
rather everyone is both pro
tagonist and antagonist, with
characters countering one an
other's lines with pointed argu
ments or hilarious mm se
quiturs. As with most ACT
shows, the ensemble is uneven
Joseph Bird is funny and sad
dening as the aged Ferapont. a
near-deaf servant in the sisters'
household, while Mimi Carr is
unbelievable as Anfisa. the
eighty year old nurse. Sally
Smvthe misses the comedy of
Natasha, the sisters' sister-in
law; Natasha is a shrill bitch,
but she is played with so little
sense of distance that it is the
actress, not the character, who
comes off bitchy On the other
hand. Bruce Williams, as
Solvony. perfectly captures the
contradictions of the nervously
witty and potentially explosive
captain, a basically malad
justed (yet not totally dis
agreeable) fellow who, unable
to win Irina's love, eventually
kill's her fiance in a duel.
Overall, you got a play worth
seeing here. ACT's production
of The Three Sisters is uneven,
but Chekhov is hard to perform,
and even if this cast and director
do not do him total justice, they
come close. And that's not bad.


From left: Olga (DeAnn Mears), Masha (Eliz
abeth Huddle), Irina (Barbara Dirickson) and
Vershinin (Peter Donat) in ACT's production of

Anton Chekhov's "The Three Sisters" (through
May 22).
Not bad. You got Anton
Chekhov. One of the greats. And
he's got this play with three sis
ters. The first one's named
Olga. and she has to deliver
lines like these: "It's exactly a
year ago today since Father
died... your name-day, Irina. It
was very cold then, and snow
ing. I thought I'd never get over
it and you actually passed out...
But now a year's gone by and we
don't mind talking about it any
m0re...1 remember the band
playing when they took father to
the cemetery, and they fired a
salute. He was a general, com
manded a brigade. All the same,
not many people came — it was
a wet day of course, with heavy
rain and sleet." That's an ex
cerpt from Olga's opening
speech. It's a hard speech to de
liver — how do you recite this
series of past events without
making it sound like a shopping
list 9 — in a really hard play to
perform. But DeAnn Mears.
who plays Olga in ACT's current
production of The Three Sis
ters, gets through it gracefully,
and after the first few minutes,
you realize you just might have
a cast who can do justice to the
play.
You got Tom Moore. He
directed (Urease on Broadway.
Big success. Also Frankenstein.
Big flop. Moore has a nasty hab

it of grouping the sisters in. con
veniently. threes, as if the au
dience would otherwise forget
they are The Three Sisters. And
you have to wonder about his
sense of tempo; the pace drags
after intermission, and he in
cludes an entire song in the
fourth act of a long play when a
single verse would have filled
the script's requirement. But he
knows what the play is about:
frustration, loss, aging — life,
really. And his interpretation is
impeccable.
Until the end. Here, you got
melodrama where you need un
derstatement. As the action
comes to a close, the three sis
ters, clutching at each other in a
clump center-stage, gaze up
into the cheap seats and wonder
what it was all about.
As for the sisters themselves,
Olga, the eldest, teaches school
and longs to leave her life of pro
vincial boredom for the exciting
city of the sisters' birth: Mos
cow. DeAnn Mears plays the
role with quiet frustration, in
startling contrast to the
boisterous (read, "loud") style
of Barbara Dirickson, who plays
little sister Irina.
Now. it's good to have con
trast between the eldest and
youngest. Olga is old enough to
know the sisters may never
make it back to Moscow; Irina
is shocked when she realizes
they are not leaving, and that

she is wasting her youth away.
