# Rene Clair: movies lose a great director
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Rene Clair died on March 16th
at the age of eighty-two. fifty
eight years after making his
first film. Paris (Jul Dort. and
sixteen years after making his
Fetes (ialantes. He was one of
the last survivors of that most
extraordinary decade in French
movies, the thirties, the era of
Jean Renoir. Jean Vigo. Julien
Duvivier, Marcel Pagnol and
Marcel Carne; that golden time
when French directors, follow
ing the example of their im
mediate forebears, the Im
pressionist painters (like Re
noir's father), discovered the
city of Paris and the countryside
surrounding it and fell in love
with it.
Movie lovers who are blessed
with imaginative revival houses
in their cities are astonished by
the treasure trove of films re
leased in France in this period:
Boudu Saved from Drowning,
Toni, The Crime of M. Lange, A
Day in the Country, Bizarre,
Bizarre, Poil de Carotte, Vn
Carnet de Bal, Harvest, the
Marius-Fanrjy-Cesar trilogy,
Pepe Le Mo ho, The Lower
Depths, Crand Illusion, Rules
of the (lame, Zero for Conduct,
L'Atalante, Port of Shadows,
Daybreak, The Baker's Wife —
and, by Rene Clair, Sous les
Toits de Paris, Le Million, A
Nous la Liberte.
Though more directors made
the transition from silents to
talkies successfully than are
generally recognized, perhaps
Clair alone carried the playful
inventiveness of his career as a
maker of silent comedies into
his early sound pictures. His
first films were surrealistic
games, highly experimental and
full of a kind of joie de vivre that
Clair, who had begun as a critic
in 1919, believed was missing
from the films his countrymen
were making. In Paris Qui Dort
and Entr'acte (1923 and 1924) he
was searching for the magic of
cinema, as the pioneers of
French film Meles and Lumi

ere, had at the turn of the cen
tury, and these early short
pieces of Clair's are sprightly
and surprising even now; they
have a sparkling, improvisatory
quality.
Clair was fascinated by the
potential of film to achieve
rythm. and indeed the verb
most often used to describe his
technique of film-making is
"choreograph." In 1927, he
adapted a riotous farce by
Eugene Labiche and Marc
Michel called An Italian Straw
Hat, and the resulting picture
was a marvel of technique: an

. . . Clair ivas a vehement opponent of the
talking picture, which he termed a
"redoubtable monster."

intricate 110-minute chase in
which a young man (Albert Pre
jean) attempts in the midst of
the ceremonies enshrining his
wedding day to hunt down a
straw hat, to replace the one
eaten by his horse, so that its
owner will not be compromised.
(It seems that she removed it
before keeping an assignation
with her lover.) The manipu
lation of characters and props is
so deft that one holds one's
breath through long, complex
sequences: An Italian Straw
Hat stands, with Chaplin's The
(laid Hush and Keaton's The
(ieneral, at the zenith of silent
comedy.
It is not surprising to find that
Clair was a vehement opponent
of the talking picture, which he
called "a redoubtable monster,
an unnatural creation, thanks to
which the screen will become
poor theatre." When he at
tacked the monster in 1930, he
breathed the fire of his own im
aginative genius, and conquered
it. If An Italian Straw Hat was a
silent musical. Sous les Toits de
Paris was a musical silent. At a
time when Americans were
making clunky, static musicals

that were more like third-row
center home movies of Broad
way shows than real motion pic
tures. Clair employed music as
he had employed objects in his
1920's films — as motifs and run
ning gags. First, he picked a
subject that was intrinsically
musical: the romance between
a street singer (Prejean again)
and his girl (Pola Illery). The ti
tle song is a thread that runs
through the film.and it is so vital
an element that one recalls it as
long as one retains the image of
the rooftops of Paris indicated
in the title. Both may be in-

eradicable: as Pauline Kael
once wrote, any shot of Parisian
roofs inevitably makes us think
of Rene Clair, and more than ten
years after seeing Sous les Toits
de Paris I can still hum that
melody.
Clair's two other master
pieces from this era were both
released in 1931: Le Million and
A Nous la Liberte. Le Million is
an extended vaudeville skit
about the efforts of a pair of lov
ers (Rene Lefevre and An
nabella) to track down a win
ning lottery ticket forgotten in a
coat pocket. It is a musical, too.
in which the sung rhymes propel
the story — in other words. Clair
invented a lean, economical
type of comic operetta. And it
had its influence. In 1932 and
1933 Rodgers and Hart ex
perimented with this kind of
musical film in The Phantom
President and Hallelujah, I'm a
Bum. (Both films are seen far
too seldom). And the structure
of the plot shows up most memo
rably four years after Le Mil
lion, in the Marx Brothers' A
Night at the Opera.
The Marx Brothers were not
the onlv American comedians

inspired by Rene Clair. As many
film historians have pointed
out. the factory scenes in
Charlie Chaplan's Modern
Times are based on A Nous la
Liberie. in which two buddies
escape from prison, only to end
up on opposite sides of the capi
talistic fence: Louis (Raymond
Cordv) builds a phonograph in
dustry and hires Emile (Henri
Marchand) as a laborer. Anyone
who has seen Modern Times
can guess the outcome: working
in his friend's factory becomes
as constraining as prison for
Emile. and he escapes a second
time.

The love of freedom and hu
manity that illuminates A Nous
la Liberie endears the film to
present-day audiences (who
always respond with delight).
Though Clair made films in
England in the late thirties
(such as '/'he (fjftont (;<><■* Wt-st
with Robert Donat), in Ameri
can in the forties (/ Married a
Witch. And Then There Were
None and others), and returned
to France to work in the fifties,
it is these early, effervescent
musical comedies to which we
return, if we are lucky enough to
have access to them, again and
again They are the greatest
part of the heritage Rene Clair
has left us.
(One of Clair's last movies,
Porte des Lilas, will be shown in
Bishop Auditorium on Wednes
day, May 27, at 8 p.m.)
