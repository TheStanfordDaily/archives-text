# Top oboist blows at SU

Hautbois, hoboe, mtboi, oboe.
In any language it is an "ill wind that blows no
good." Heinz Holliger, in his April sth concert,
proved that winds can change.
Holliger. perhaps the world's premier oboist,
presented a varied program of works by com
posers ranging from Robert Schumann to Luciano
Berio. For the first half of the recital. Holliger
and his accompanist. John Steele Ritter. chose
three classics of Romantic and twentieth century
oboe literature: Three Romances op. 94 (1849) by
Schumann, Temporal Variations op. Posth.
(1936). and Six Metamorphoses after Ovid op 49
(1951) bv Benjamin Britten.
Prior to the mid-nineteenth century, the oboe
was not extensively used as a solo instrument.
Schumann's Romances were welcomed as long
overdue contributions to the literature, and were
considered experimental. This first attempt at in
troducing the oboe into a solo work lacks an under
standing of the technical limitations of the instru
ment; the second Romance was written without
any rest for the oboe in almost three minutes.
Holliger played the piece effortlessly, varying
his tone from a strident forte to a tenderly ex
pressive pian<>. following the moods of the work.
His dynamic range was excellent, though slightly
over-blown in the louder passages. His interpreta
tion. showing all the results of his European train
ing. was appropriate, and marred only by minor
problems of coordination with the piano.
Britten's Temporal Variation.v are marvelous
short pieces that follow closely in the footsteps of
works by Camille Sain Saens and Serge Prokofiev
The final variation in particular demonstrated
Britten's genius, consisting of a series of long held
notes in the oboe interrupted by extremely diver
gent statements in the piano.
The Six Metamorphoses after (')vid are pro
grammatic musical sketches based on Greek
mythological figures. The pieces explore the full
expressive range of the oboe from pathetically
whimpering, to simply jocular, to aggressively
demanding. Despite a few minor memory lapses,
Holliger's performance of these sketches was
well-regulated and extremely effective.
For the second half of the program. Holliger
turned to the contemporary period, for which he is
most widely acclaimed. He began with the Se

queme 111 (1969) by Luciano Berio. The piece,
written especially for Holliger. came as the result
of extensive collaboration and suggestions by
Holliger as to the capabilities of the oboe Since
Holliger's capabilities are much greater than
those of almost any other oboist, the work is vir
tually impossible to perform and represent a true
showpiece for his technique.
The work is seven minutes of variation on and
around the note B It is accompanied bv a constant
tone upon which the oboe elaborates and rein
forces. It was the most exciting piece on the pro
gram. and left the audience with a resonance that
lasted until the next work.
The Four Pieces (1966) by Ernst Krenek. also
written for Holliger. are further explorations of
the possibilities of the oboist's technique, using
glissandi. polyphonies, harmonics, and sub-tonics
to vary otherwise simple thematic structure.
They were a humorous change from the intensity
of the rest of the program, and were performed
almost laughingly by Holliger and Ritter.
The only piano solo of the concert was the Vingt
Regards sur I'Engatt â€¢Jesus (1944) by Oliver
Messian Ritter played it expressively, emphasiz
ing its jazzy elements with a feeling worthy of
Duke Ellington The eclectic nature of the work
shone throughout the performance, reaching for
inspiration from Indian folk music and from com
posers such as Darius Mihaudand Modest
Mussogorsky.
The final scheduled work on the recital was the
Sonata (1947) by Henry Dutilleu. This work,
drawing on compositions by Maurice Rave, is
charming, and Holliger performed it with real
tenderness.
An an encore Holliger and Ritter played a work
for oboe and piano by Ravel, composed in his
Spanish period (like Bolero, and L'Heure
Espaiinol). It was a short tango and brought the
concert to a close with a light, springtime feeling
The Swiss-born oboist also gave a master class
on Monday night, in which he explored the tech
nique and phasing of various works in the liter
ature. Holliger's concert and master class repre
sent the beginning of a trend in the Stanford Lively
Arts Program towards exploration of many dif
ferent forms of performance, and should bring
greater, and more diverse exposure of music to
the Stanford campus.
