Shuttle will glide to landing today
Mojave — Columbia's ultimatedrama begins this morn
ing 170 miles above the south Indian Ocean when the shut
tle will fly backward for what the space people call the de
orbit burn.
Astronauts John Young and Robert Crippen will race
toward this bleak desert 100 miles northeast of Los Angel
es
They will cross the California coast at Monterey, trav
eling 4000 miles an hour and heading toward long lost
places called Buzzard Rock, Coyote Gulch and the Dead
Mountains.
"Well, we come across the coastline doing Mach 6 i six
times the speed of sound) at about 120.000 feet." Young,
the Columbia's commander, describes the return "Yeah,
the ground track is to come across the coastline north of
Monterey Bay up there, and sort of heading south it passes
Bakersfield. and. at Mach 4. you're abeam Lake Isabella."
Below them the panorama of the Big Sur will blur into
the burned brown mountains of the Coast Range and then
to the dazzling white sand of the Mojave Desert
At one point they will pass over the headquarters of the
Flat Earth Society which, since the embarrassment of the
moon flights and all these orbits, has retreated to a small
headquarters in the nearby desert town of Lancaster
where the society's last holdouts now concede the earth is
a disk
The Columbia will cruise over burned-out ghost towns
named Crutts and Ragtown. over exhausted mines named
Silver King and Waterloo, over the haunts of legendary
desert denizens named Death Valley Scotty and Peg Leg
Smith and zero in on a dry white lake named Rogers.
"At Mach 3 you're abeam of the runway at Mojave. real
ly going downwind at a little better than 50.000 feet."
Young continues.
At that point the Columbia is expected to make a long,
banking left turn off toward Death Valley, off toward the
old borax mines which did so much for the economy of both
this desert and President Ronald Reagan.
Ancient Egyptians used borax to mummify the dead.
Americans didn't really get with it until the mines were
discovered near Furnace Creek The 20-mule teams
hauled the stuff out of this forsaken land. And much later,
Reagan used the mule teams and television's "Death Val
ley Days" to keep his career from mummifying during the
transition from Hollywood to politics. The president will
be watching television as the Columbia makes the big
swing and. sinking like a rock now. heads for Rogers Dry
Lake at the military haven of Edwards Air Force Base.
"You hit the heading alignment circle into runway 23 on
the north lake bed at 32.000 feet." Young says.
The Columbia will be out of gas. a big. heavy glider now
— the Flying Brickyard, some space engineers call it —
and dropping three times as hard and fast as a commercial
jet.
The mesquite and the cactus and the white dry lake will
be leaping up at the astronauts as they make their final
turn at 23.000 feet. For the first time in 2 v z days they will
be in truly familiar territory. Young has flown a test shut
tle. taken aloft by a 747. from this height over the desert.
"You're at final — high final — at 12.000 feet, doing
about 275 knots in a 20 degree glide." Young goes on.
A convoy of 18 trucks will be waiting below, poised for
the recovery mission: poised for trouble, too.
As many as 200.000 tourists, who have been warned by
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration about
the rattlesnakes and water shortages out here, will be

gawking as the Columbia heads home, dropping faster
than any flying machine they have ever seen
The ship will pass over U.S. Highway 58 at 10.000 feet 76
seconds before touchdown l T p to this point the computers
have been flying the craft but Young will take the stick for
the landing
The landing gear will come down 19 seconds before
touchdown
"You try to touch down at 185 knots." Young says, talk
ing of a speed of more than 200 miles an hour
". ... and try to land soft." Young adds
"John does it soft every time." his copilot. Crippen,
adds, with a test pilot's "right stuff" grin
Reagan in fine fettle, nixes deal
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, on his first
day back at work after surviving an assassination attempt,
announced emphatically yesterday that he is in no mood to
compromise with Congress on his economic recovery
plan.
Not only did the president spell that out. but he had his
position reaffirmed by three of the top officials in the ad
ministration: Vice President George Bush. Secretary of
the Treasury Donald Regan and counselor to the president
Edwin Meese.
Reagan's hard line against a compromise, at least for
the near future, was prompted bv a statement Sunday by
the Democratic chairman of the House Budget Commit
tee. who maintained that he had detected a willingness on
the part of the administration to negotiate a deal.
The chairman. Rep James Jones (D-Okla) said on a tel
evision program that he had received "unofficial indica
tions" from "different people in the administration" that
the president might be willing to accept a one-year income
tax cut. instead of the three-year. 30 percent reduction
Reagan has proposed.
The president's strong reaction to Jones' assertion was
the first thing heard by his three top aides — Meese, chief
of staff James Baker and deputy chief of staff Michael De
aver — when they met with him yesterday morning in the
residential quarters of the White House.
"As they walked into the room, that was the president's
first statement — it might have even come before 'good
morning.'" deputy White House press secretary Larry
Speakes reported
Iran hostages cited for bravery
Washington — The American diplomats formerly held
hostage in Iran were cited yesterday for exceptional
bravery and heard Secretary of State Alexander Haig vow
"to stamp out the scourge of international terrorism "
In the presence of a U.S. Marine band, Haig pinned the
State Department's Award for Valor on the lapel of L.
Bruce Laingen. the ranking U.S. diplomat in Iran during
the 444-dav hostage crisis.
Laingen received the award on behalf of himself and 53
other returnees before an overflow crowd at the State De
partment's Dean Acheson auditorium. Thirty-four of the
former captives were present for the ceremony.
The award is given for "unusually difficult or dangerous
circumstances, which require exceptional personal
bravery and perseverence."
It was the first reunion of the ex-hostages since they
were received at the White House by President Reagan in
late January about a week after their departure from Iran
Twelve weeks have passed since then, and the returnees
appeared fit and relaxed during their appearance on ves

terdav.
The group will fly to the West Virginia resort town of
White Sulphur Springs today for three days of meetings
with the same government doctors who examined them in
West Germany before their return to the U.S.
The doctors will review with them any problems they
may have had in readjusting to freedom after their con
finement The overwhelming majority are said to have
had no significant re-entry problems
Four Atlanta slayings 'solved'
Atalnta — The slayings of as many as four of the 23
young blacks killed here since July 1979 have been "sub
stantially solved," FBI Director William Webster said
yesterday, and the FBI once thought it knew who had
killed more than a dozen of the victims
Webster, in an interview with The Atlanta Constitution,
said the four killings are not related to each other or to the
remaining murders of young blacks being investigated by
a special police task force.
Fulton County District Attorney Lewis Slaton said his
office "has not been made aware of sufficient evidence to
secure indictments on any of the (23) cases."
Asked later yesterday about the newspaper report. FBI
spokesman Robert Young said Webster did not mean to
imply that "prosecution will be forthcoming" in any of the
cases.
Webster said authorities believe that between 12 and 16
of the slayings were committed by one person.
He said the FBI three weeks ago was nearly certain it
had found that murderer, only to have its case weakened in
some critical fashion that he would not specify.
Since that setback, the FBI chief said authorities have
identified another suspect.
Reagan files, skips 'campaign box'
Washington — President Ronald Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, paid $67,465 in federal taxes on an income of
$227,968 last year — less than half of what he made in 1979,
according to his 1980 tax return.
The return, released yesterday by the White House and
dated April 8 — just a week before tomorrow's deadline for
filing —" showed that most of the president's income.
$164,337, came from interest. ,
He took a $25,400 deduction for state and local taxes, but
those returns were not released.
The return also showed the Reagans paid $2098 in Social
Security, self-employment tax. in addition to the $67,465.

The president, whose general election campaign was fi
nanced by taxpayers, did not check the box for the presi
dential election campaign fund, because he is
philosophically opposed to it, said deputy White House
press secretary Larry Speakes
Reagan reported earnings on his 1979 return of $515,878,
on which he paid $230,886 in federal income taxes and
$32,050 in California taxes.
Speakes said the president's income was much lower in
1980 "because he was campaigning He cut out his speak
ing engagements."
Reagan, whose net worth has been estimated at about $4
million, converted his personal wealth — excluding two
property estates — into $740,000 in cash earlier this year
and placed it in a blind trust.
The couple claimed $84,441 in itemized deductions, in
cluding $3085 for charities and $109 for Reagan's dues in
the actors union he once headed.
Study links Pill to slight cancer risk
Atalnta — A preliminary study has linked birth control
pills to breast cancer in women whose families have a his
tory of the disease, a researcher said today.
The study, bv scientists at New York Medical College in
Valhalla. N.Y.. said women whose grandmothers or aunts
had suffered breast cancer appeared slightly more likely
to get the disease themselves if they used oral contracep
tives.
Earlier studies have shown no link between the pill and
cancer, although women using oral contraceptives run a
small increased risk of circulatory problems, particularly
blood clots.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among wom
en, striking one woman in 15.
