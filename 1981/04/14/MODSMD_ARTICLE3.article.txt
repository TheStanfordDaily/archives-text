# Uncomplicating the housing draw
## 
### Cathy Janus 
There is a four letter word as
sociated with spring quarter that has a
visible effect on Stanford students
who desire to live on campus the fol
lowing year — the word is the DRAW
The Draw may seem complex and
frightening — where you'll live on
campus depends on a random number
as well as on completing certain re
quirements. But if you obtain the draw
handbook, read it carefully, and follow
instructions, the draw's procedures
are relatively easy to understand and
participation is simple.
Draw participants are assigned
spaces according to expressed
choices, priorities, draw numbers and
standing under the Guaranteed Hous
ing Plan.
The Draw consists of two time peri
ods. or two rounds.
There are two rounds of assign
ments in the Draw: round one which
generates a preliminary set of assign
ments. and round two, a final set of as
signments which represent commit
ments for autumn quarter housing.
Prior to round one. students make
their initial choices for next year's
housing. Residences hold open houses
so students can visit and talk with the
people living in the houses which in
terest them.
Students should obtain their draw
materials between April 10 and April
24. and after deciding which resi
dences they like most, list eight
choices in order of preference.
There are two kinds of choices
which can be made. Specific choices
refer to a particular residence such as
Roble or Phi Psi, while a General
choice refers to a category of resi
dences such as "Any Cooperative" or
"Any Wilbur House."
Once choices are listed and the

Draw card turned in, listed prefer
ences may not be changed.
Unguaranteed students may partic
ipate in the Draw; if not assigned after
round two. their chances of being as
signed to housing at a later date will be
improved by joining a waiting list.
Students who do not plan to live on
campus autumn quarter, but want on
campus housing winter or spring quar
ters should join a waiting list bv June
12.
To improve your chances for assign
ment to prefered housing you should
complete special priority require
ments that some houses offer.
Round one begins when students
hand in their ranked housing choices
with any special priorities and ran
domly select their draw number. The
numbers are drawn between April 21
and April 24 on the second floor of
Tresidder Union The numbers range
from 0001 (the best) to 5000 (the
worst).
In May the results of round one will
be released. Students who partici
pated in this round need not do any
thing unless they wish to: (1) drop out
of the draw or (2> accept their pre
liminary assignment as final.
Students who wish to do either of the
above must pick up a second draw
card at their residence office or the
Stanford Housing Center. This card
must be completed and retuned to the
office where it was picked up within
three working days from the date
round one results are announced.
Those students who remain in the
Draw will be reassigned to a house
higher on their list of choices if pos
sible. If they can't be assigned to an
other house they will be given their
round one assignments.
If not assigned to any of the resi
dences listed as choices on the draw

card, then guaranteed students can
choose to drop out of the draw on to be
assigned anywhere.
The final step for the Draw is in ear
ly June. At that time, if students have
not dropped out of the Draw, they
should pick up a third draw card and
return it by June 12. This step is re
quired of all students who receive a
draw assignment, and is highly rec
ommended for those who wish to join a
waiting list
Roommates are not assigned in the
Draw, so those who would like to be as
signed with one or more other students
may draw as a group. Drawing as a
group means that all members share
the same draw number. Assignments
are made separately for each sex. as
the housing office seeks to place an
equal number of males and females in
each residence.
There are 43 houses plus 13 all-male
fraternities. Both open houses and the
Fraternity Rush have begun Visit
those houses you are interested in. ob
tain priorities, and turn in your card

There is a four letter word as
sociated with spring quarter that has a
visible effect on Stanford students
who desire to live on campus the fol
lowing year — the word is the DRAW
The Draw may seem complex and
frightening — where you'll live on
campus depends on a random number
as well as on completing certain re
quirements. But if you obtain the draw
handbook, read it carefully, and follow
instructions, the draw's procedures
are relatively easy to understand and
participation is simple.
Draw participants are assigned
spaces according to expressed
choices, priorities, draw numbers and
standing under the Guaranteed Hous
ing Plan.
The Draw consists of two time peri
ods. or two rounds.
There are two rounds of assign
ments in the Draw: round one which
generates a preliminary set of assign
ments. and round two, a final set of as
signments which represent commit
ments for autumn quarter housing.
Prior to round one. students make
their initial choices for next year's
housing. Residences hold open houses
so students can visit and talk with the
people living in the houses which in
terest them.
Students should obtain their draw
materials between April 10 and April
24. and after deciding which resi
dences they like most, list eight
choices in order of preference.
There are two kinds of choices
which can be made. Specific choices
refer to a particular residence such as
Roble or Phi Psi, while a General
choice refers to a category of resi
dences such as "Any Cooperative" or
"Any Wilbur House."
Once choices are listed and the

Draw card turned in, listed prefer
ences may not be changed.
Unguaranteed students may partic
ipate in the Draw; if not assigned after
round two. their chances of being as
signed to housing at a later date will be
improved by joining a waiting list.
Students who do not plan to live on
campus autumn quarter, but want on
campus housing winter or spring quar
ters should join a waiting list bv June
12.
To improve your chances for assign
ment to prefered housing you should
complete special priority require
ments that some houses offer.
Round one begins when students
hand in their ranked housing choices
with any special priorities and ran
domly select their draw number. The
numbers are drawn between April 21
and April 24 on the second floor of
Tresidder Union The numbers range
from 0001 (the best) to 5000 (the
worst).
In May the results of round one will
be released. Students who partici
pated in this round need not do any
