## 
### 
by Jan Mireles
In proposing alternatives to "Rea
ganomics." guest speakers at a sym
posium analyzing the American econ
omy suggested that Americans need
energy alternatives and new incen
tives to fight increased inflation
caused by too much spending.
More than 600 people listened while
Congressional Representative Tom
Lantos (D-Calif.) moderated the sym
posium which featured guest pro
fessor John Anderson. Stanford Busi
ness school professor George Bach
and Martin Carnoy of the Economics
department.
Lantos introduced the night's topic:

"The American Economy: an
analysis of the emerging economic
policy of the Reagan administration."
Throughout the 90 minute sym
posium. the panelists stressed the lack
of "feasibility" of the proposed Rea
ganomics. Bach, a former member of
the Federal Reserve Board, examined
the Reagan progam and found it de
pendent upon incentives and stagfla
tion.
"We must increase incentives to
work. save, invest, and produce." said
Bach.
Bach went on to explain that the
Reagan administration has taken a
monetarist approach to get rid of of
deficits and scale government down

by "relying on the Federal Reserve to
control the money flow."
Continuing the examination of Rea
ganomics. Carnoy said. "Implicit in
the Reagan program is a redistribu
tion program In theory this program
could work, but there are several
crucial assumptions which preclude
its success."
The idea that tax cuts would spur in
vestment domestically and would
create work incentives was among the
assumptions Carnoy said were in
herent in President Ronald Reagan's
proposals. Carnoy said the Reagan
program also assumes that profits
will rise and corporations will pass on
lower costs resulting from the lower
tax rates.
"I don't think Reagan economics is
going to work," said Carnoy.
Carnoy then offered what he termed
his "alternative." He suggested that
democracy be extended to the "con
trol and ownership of production."
and that Americans increase the qual
ity of life by fighting inflation through
full employment but "not through mil
itarism abroad.
"I agree production is a problem I
don't agree production should be left
to those who have failed to increase

production." said Carnoy. "It is a
myth that American businesses areef
ficient. The solution is to gradually
take away decision-making power
from those people."
Anderson claimed that the fun
damental error in Reaganomics is
that it isbased on the "guns and but
ter" philosophy said to exist during
the Johnson administration.
"With a consumption-oriented tax
cut and at the same time an increased
defense spending plan, we're ready to
commit the same mistake and create
the same conditions for classic infla
tion." said Anderson.
According to Anderson. Reagan pol
icy exhibits a "continuous lack of con
cern for alternative forms of energy "
"I don't believe the invisible hand'
of Adam Smith is going to solve all our
problems." Anderson said. "If the ad
ministration's economic game plan is
something that's supposed to betaken
on faith, if that's the truth, then I'm a
doubting Thomas." said Anderson
Lantos ended the symposium with a
summary statement in which he
stressed that."There really is no free
lunch."
