## 
### Richard Klingler 
There are two slates running for
election April 15 and 16 to the four
member Council of Presidents (COP)
— the executive body of the ASSU.
The COP coordinates the activities
of the ASSU Senate. Finance Office,
general services like the Sunday
flicks, the student committee system,
the intern program, and other groups
in addition to serving as a liaison be
tween the student body and the admin
istration
One slate composed of Chris
Greene. Dragan Popov, Mariann
Byerwaiter and Fredrick Buhl
(GPBB slate i is opposed by the Ham
mer and Coffin ( Hand C) slate of Mike
VVilkins. Steve Kessler. Peter
Stamats. and Mary Anne Rothberg
Although both groups use elements
of humor in their campaigns, both
have put forth serious responses to a
range of problems, researched dif
ferent concerns and issues, and
worked with current COP members to
understand better the challenges and
functions of the COP.
The primary concern of both slates
is to address immediate student
needs The platforms of both groups
dwell upon issues of daily concern for
the majority of Stanford students, and
both groups consider discussions of in
ternational issues to be of secondary
importance.
Current COP member Marc Ven
tresea sees this emphasis on student
services as a continuation of the in
creasing managerial role of the COP
He stressed the importance of dedi
cation to the daily monitoring of a
large, growing organization like the
ASSU.
As part of their concern with stu
dent services, both slates promise in
creased student participation in run
ning Tresidder Union, attention to mi
nority affairs. efforts to improve cam
pus safety, and measures to augment
the quality and availability of housing.
Both groups also stress increasing stu
clant ii.-it-tlflf.itinn in the Aft.Str j,n<!
serving as efficient managers of the
organization

Rothberg outlined the four primary
concerns of the Hand (' slate to be
greater student control of Tresidder.
providing more campus housing,
creating a "cabinet government to
better oversee the Senate.'' and im
proving campus security
Stamats said the Hand C slate
would lobby for additional federal
funds and would solicit corporate
sp'onsored student scholarships
Stamats said reduced scholarship fun
ding. combined with increased tuition,
would prevent qualified students from
applying to the school He also said his
slate would work to make the Minority
Coalition more visible
Stamats said the COP "should take
an active role in energy conservation"
by instituting a plan to charge resi
dents in University housing for each
house's excess energy use
Byerwalter. speaking on behalf of
the GPBB slate, said her group's prin
ciple concerns are increasing the "ex
change of information" between dif
ferent areas of the University,
strengthening the rapport between the
ASSU Senate. The Stanford Daily,
and the COP. as well as addressing the
particular needs of graduate students.
The GPBB platform calls for effi
cient management, expanding student
control of Tresidder. overseeing aca
demic affairs, concern for graduate
and minority students, and emphasis
on particular student services.
To make the ASSU government
more efficient, the platform calls for
"the creation of a set of internships"
and "an unofficial cabinet."
Byerwalter said the cabinet would in
form COP members of the different
activities and needs of ASSU services
and improve the communication be
tween the COP and the student body.
In academic affairs, the GPBB
slate suggests examining the stan
dards of the Western Culture pro
gram. working to expand residential
education, regularizing the overseas
program requirements, and publiciz
ing the extradepartmental offerings

should be expanded to include greater
conservation efforts and a household
item exchange project Emphasizing
cooperation in all decisions and ef
forts. Byerwalter said of her slate:
"we want to act as one "
Both slates support autonomy for
sororities and recognition of sororities
by the University. Stamats said that
sororities "definitely have a place on
this campus." Wilkins and Byerwalter
urged students to read their platform.
The GPBB slate received the en
dorsement of The Stanford Daily, but
the selection process prompted
criticism. Wilkins said that the Daily
s editorial board did not listen to the
majority of the Hand C slate's pro
posals and that "it seemed to me that
we weren't given equal time."
Rothberg questioned whether the
endorsement of an entire platform
was fair when so many different is
sues and people were considered to
gether. especially when the COP en
dorsement might prove to be very im
portant Byerwalter. however, said
she was pleased to accept the endorse
ment and that the endorsement pro
cedure was "handled well."
The current COP worked with both
slates and offered to aid any group
that is elected. Ventresca said that he
hoped the new COP members would
continue many of the projects that are
now underway, but said that the COP
is also a body that is open to creativity
and initiatives. Current COP mem
bers refused to endorse either slate
