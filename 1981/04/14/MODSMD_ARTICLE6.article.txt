# Study keeping tabs on the class of '81
## 
### Rigo Chavez 
The Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies is conducting an on
going study concerning the academic
experiences and progression of ap
proximately 350 members of the class
of 81.
For the study. 320 freshmen were
selected randomly in the fall of 1977
and the number grew as transfer stu
dents enrolled. John Boli, research co
ordinator for the Undergraduate Stud
ies office, said.
Each spring these students are
asked to complete a questionnaire and
an interview with an upper level ad
ministrator.
Herant Katchadourian. dean of un
dergraduate studies and head of this
particular study, said that through it
he hoped to gain "a more in-depth un
derstanding of how students make
their academic choices, including how
they pick their major and what guides
them in choosing a major."
All students fill out the same ques
tionnaire but the interviews, while
they follow general guidelines, vary
with the interviewer
The 20 interviewers include James

Lyons, dean of student affairs; Ray
Bacchetti, vice provost for man
agement and budget . Sally Mahoney.
registrar, and Katchadourian
"Some interviewers spend several
hours talking to their students and
some spend only about an hour." Boli
said
Ho said that although the results of
the survey will not be compiled until
after December, ' the interviewers
think they have learned a lot already
"The main purpose of the study was
to provide data on which to base cer
tain academic decisions.
"The results should help us improve
undergraduate studies in general."
Katchadourian said
Response from the students and the
interviewers has been equally en
thusiastic There have been 498 stu
dents in the study at one time or anoth
er and of these only about 150 will not
complete the study mostly because
they stopped out at some point and will
not achieve junior status in time.
Part of the student's enthusiasm
could be attributed to the fact that
they are paid for participation
Roli said that each student is paid

$100 for participation: "they get $15
for each interview and survey they
complete, and if they complete all
four they get a $40 bonus "
Recently the University received a
grant of $50,000 from the Spencer
Foundation to help pay for the study
which will cost the University about
$35,000 in student stipends alone
This is the first time a study of this
type has been done at Stanford, ac
cording to Boli
He said that one was not planned
again in the near future
Katchadourian said that no interim
results have been released so far be
cause there is concern about how this
study affects the participants.
"One of the things we will have to
deal with when looking at the results is
what effect being a part of the study
and having contact with upper level
administrators had on the students
and to what extent this affected their
experiences at Stanford," Boli said
According to Boli the results could
affect the responses of those students
