## Comecon's fragile network sagging under steady strain of Polish crisis 
### Washington Post 
Munich. West Germany —
The Polish crisis has set off a
chain reaction throughout the
interlocking economies of the
Soviet Bloc, and its impact is be
ginning to be felt from East Ber
lin to Vladivostok
That is the impression gained
bv Western analysts here from
public statements and private
reports about dislocations in
Comecon. the Soviet Bloc com
mon market, caused by Po
land's decreasing ability to
meet its commitments.
The repercussions in the War
saw Pact also may be causing
Moscow to have second
thoughts about its longstanding
policy of promoting interdepen
dent economies in the bloc —
with the idea that none of its
Warsaw Pact allies would be ec
onomically independent but ul
timately be reliant on the rest of
the Soviet-led alliance

Two weeks ago Polish Deputy
Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski
said in an interview on Radio
Warsaw that he had received
the Romanian ambassador to
Poland, "who made no secret of
his anger at the fact that we are
no longer supplying them with
coke, which they have to buy in
the West for hard currency" to
keep Romania's industry going.
"He told me quite frankly that
they are still waiting for Poland
to meet its obligations."
Rakowski added.
The East Germans have
made their complaint public.
Due to Poland's failure to supp
plv promised coal, the East Ger
man magazine Neuer Weg said,
East Germany was forced to
buy coking coal from West Ger
many. The East Germans,
meanwhile, have ordered their
factories and power plants to
use domestic brown coal and
compressed lignite.
Similar difficulties have
arisen in Czechoslovakia.
Industrialized
After the Soviet Union. Po
land is the most heavily in
dustrialized country in Com
econ. All of its members depend
to varying degrees on Polish
made industrial products such
as ball bearings and electronic
instrumentation. For example,
under Comecon's specialization
arrangements. Poland produces
components for the Soviet air
craft industry.
This means that when Poland
fails to supply the energy and
components promised under the
five-year plans, other Comecon
nations must buy the necessary
items elsewhere or halt their

own production.
Exact figures on the Polish
difficulties and the extent of
damage caused to other War
saw Pact nations are un
available But reports of bu
reaucratic anxieties and vari
ous shortages intensifying
throughout Eastern Europe
may be reflected in Czechoslo
vak President Gustav Husak's
call this week for an early Com
econ summit to discuss basic
aspects of coordinating allied
economies
The Polish statistical data on
the first quarter of this year
were discouraging. Published in
the party daily. Try buna Ludu,
they suggest that Poland's ex
pected 3 percent decline in gross
national product for this year
may be too optimistic. The fig
ures reveal that the first quar
ter industrial output was down
10 percent from the planned
target and that building in
dustries were down by 20 per
cent.
Total Polish exports to its
Comecon allies declined by 15
percent compared with the
same three-month period of
1980.
Supporters of Solidarity
argue that labor efficiency has
increased sharply in Poland
since the independent labor
union organization was estab
lished and that Baltic shipyards,
for example, realized profits
last year for the first time.
At the same time, however,
Poland's shipbuilding output in
1980 was a staggering 39 percent
short of the projected target.
Since three out of each five
vessels made in Poland are ex
ported to the Soviet Union, the
overall decline was seen by ana
lysts as likely to have an impact
on Moscow's plans for its
merchant fleet.
Some experts argue that Sovi
et Bloc plans, with their heavy
emphasis on production, were
unrealistic and inflated and that
Poland is now trying to inject
rational methods in its com
mand economy.
According to economist Cam
Hudson of Radio Free Europe, a
U.S.-funded operation that
beams news and programs to
Eastern Europe, Poland's cur
rent economic decline has been
aggravated by disruptions in
supplies of raw materials as
much as by strikes. But he
pointed out that the introduction
of a five-day work week and
work-free Saturdays and the
changes in mine shifts would
have a long-term impact on the
plans conceived long before
these changes took place.

As Poland's Comecon part
ners are forced to take these
things into account, plans have
been ruined throughout the bloc
and administrative turmoil has
shaken the vast bureaucracies
that create the plans.
Having calculated their
1981-85 plans long before the full
extent of Poland's difficulties
was known. Soviet Bloc nations
now have to modify them — a
complex task since they have
been drawn, as usual, on the
best case scenarios that leave
no room for slack.
The changes would have to ac
count not only for Poland's re
duced ability to meet its pre
vious commitments but also for
increased East European aid to
Poland to keep it afloat.
The crucial question, which
the Polish crisis has raised ir
respective of its eventual out
come. is the very nature of of
the ability of command econo
mies to seek greater integration
through long-term planning.
A case in point may be the So
viet Bloc's nuclear program,
which has been prepared for the

next 15 years Except for the So
viet Union. Poland has under
taken by far the largest commit
ment in these joint investments
to build nuclear power plants on
Soviet soil in exchange for guar
anteed supplies of energy.
The Poles have pledged in
vestments of about $700 million
in the form of electrical equip
ment. automatic instrumenta
tion. rolled metal and labor for
the plant at Khmelnitsky, in the
Ukraine, which is scheduled for
completion in 1984 They are
committed as a major partner
in another Comecon nuclear
project at Konstantinovka, also
in the Ukraine. Moreover, they
have made bilateral agree
ments with Moscow for joint
construction of nuclear power
plants at Smolensk and Kursk,
in western Russia.

The Polish crisis has set off a

Two weeks ago Polish Deputy
Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski
said in an interview on Radio
Warsaw that he had received
the Romanian ambassador to
Poland, "who made no secret of
his anger at the fact that we are
no longer supplying them with
coke, which they have to buy in
the West for hard currency" to
keep Romania's industry going.
"He told me quite frankly that
they are still waiting for Poland
to meet its obligations."
Rakowski added.
The East Germans have
made their complaint public.
Due to Poland's failure to supp
plv promised coal, the East Ger
man magazine Neuer Weg said,
East Germany was forced to
buy coking coal from West Ger
many. The East Germans,
meanwhile, have ordered their
factories and power plants to
use domestic brown coal and
compressed lignite.
Similar difficulties have
arisen in Czechoslovakia.
Industrialized
After the Soviet Union. Po
land is the most heavily in
dustrialized country in Com
econ. All of its members depend
to varying degrees on Polish
made industrial products such
as ball bearings and electronic
instrumentation. For example,
under Comecon's specialization
arrangements. Poland produces
components for the Soviet air
craft industry.
This means that when Poland
fails to supply the energy and
components promised under the
five-year plans, other Comecon
nations must buy the necessary
items elsewhere or halt their

own production.
Exact figures on the Polish
difficulties and the extent of
damage caused to other War
saw Pact nations are un
available But reports of bu
reaucratic anxieties and vari
ous shortages intensifying
throughout Eastern Europe
may be reflected in Czechoslo
vak President Gustav Husak's
call this week for an early Com
econ summit to discuss basic
aspects of coordinating allied
economies
The Polish statistical data on
the first quarter of this year
were discouraging. Published in
the party daily. Try buna Ludu,
they suggest that Poland's ex
pected 3 percent decline in gross
national product for this year
may be too optimistic. The fig
ures reveal that the first quar
ter industrial output was down
10 percent from the planned
target and that building in
dustries were down by 20 per
cent.
Total Polish exports to its
Comecon allies declined by 15
percent compared with the
same three-month period of
1980.
Supporters of Solidarity
argue that labor efficiency has
increased sharply in Poland
since the independent labor
union organization was estab
lished and that Baltic shipyards,
for example, realized profits
last year for the first time.
At the same time, however,
Poland's shipbuilding output in
1980 was a staggering 39 percent
short of the projected target.
Since three out of each five
vessels made in Poland are ex
ported to the Soviet Union, the
overall decline was seen by ana
lysts as likely to have an impact
on Moscow's plans for its
merchant fleet.
Some experts argue that Sovi
et Bloc plans, with their heavy
emphasis on production, were
unrealistic and inflated and that
Poland is now trying to inject
rational methods in its com
mand economy.
According to economist Cam
Hudson of Radio Free Europe, a
U.S.-funded operation that
beams news and programs to
Eastern Europe, Poland's cur
rent economic decline has been
aggravated by disruptions in
supplies of raw materials as
much as by strikes. But he
pointed out that the introduction
of a five-day work week and
work-free Saturdays and the
changes in mine shifts would
have a long-term impact on the
plans conceived long before
these changes took place.

As Poland's Comecon part
ners are forced to take these
things into account, plans have
been ruined throughout the bloc
and administrative turmoil has
shaken the vast bureaucracies
that create the plans.
Having calculated their
1981-85 plans long before the full
extent of Poland's difficulties
was known. Soviet Bloc nations
now have to modify them — a
complex task since they have
been drawn, as usual, on the
best case scenarios that leave
no room for slack.
The changes would have to ac
count not only for Poland's re
duced ability to meet its pre
vious commitments but also for
increased East European aid to
Poland to keep it afloat.
The crucial question, which
the Polish crisis has raised ir
respective of its eventual out
come. is the very nature of of
the ability of command econo
mies to seek greater integration
through long-term planning.
A case in point may be the So
viet Bloc's nuclear program,
