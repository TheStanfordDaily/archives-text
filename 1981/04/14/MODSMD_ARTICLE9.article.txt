# Anti-Soviet, pro-Sadat
## Sudan's Nimeiri embraces diverse views in dispute 
### Washington Post 
Khartoum, Sudan — Why would a veteran Third
World leader abandon classic fence-straddling
diplomacy and throw himself publicly into Washing
ton's embrace, much to the Reagan administration's
apparent surprise?
Assuming Sudanese President Jaafar Nimeiri ac
cepted that reading of his recent conduct, his answer
very likely would be the clear and present danger he
feels Libyan Col. Muammar Khadafy represents for his
nearly 12-year-old government.
But to his 20 million subjects that alone does not ex
plain why he has embraced the Reagan adminis
tration's anti-Soviet world view or broken Arab ranks
by exchanging ambassadors again with the ostracized
government of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
Decisive role
Few Sudanese would dispute Nimeiri's right to be
suspicious of Khadafy. especially since the Libyans' de
cisive military role in ending the civil war to its own lik
ing in neighboring Chad last December
Despite initially excellent relations, the two leaders
have waged a kind of personal holy war against each
other for years and Nimeiri is still infuriated by
Khadafv's backing for a nearly successful and very
bloody coup attempt here in 1976
What questions are raised locally about Nimeiri's
present stance concern his wisdom in seeking a public
confrontation with Khadafy, who is buoyed by his suc
cess in Chad and by his petrodollar wealth.
No easy solution
For Nimeiri is beset by financial problems which
some economists maintain have reduced the Sudan to a
basket case and in any event promise no early or easy
solution.

Only last January three days of demonstrations in
the western province of Darfur near the Chadian border
greeted Nimeiri's efforts to impose as governor an old
army colleague detested by the local citizenry.
Depending on which officials are talking. Libyan
money may or may not have been involved in the
Darfur demonstrations in which 80 Sudanese were in
jured. But the lesson was that Nimeiri was forced to
back down and replace the governor in a humiliating
blow to his prestige.
Regional elections
Further complicating Nimeiri's task was his de
cision to embark on a publicly popular but apparently
unfinanced effort to organize six regional government
elections in Africa's largest country.
Nor has that scheme's predecessor — the local auton
omy the Arab north granted the largely Christian south
in 1972 after more than a decade of fighting — gone
without hitches. At present the south is smoldering
against a decision to ship oil discovered on its territory
to a refinery in the north.
Nimeiri's local critics and some diplomats wonder if
he has not embarked on his pro-Western confrontation
policy to divert attention from the grim domestic situ
ation. The recent 25th anniversary of independence
from Britain has done little to enhance his prestige as
Sudanese looked back at colonial rule with nostalgic
mixed emotions.
Critics argue that Nimeiri's seemingly unsolicited —
and now all but abandoned — offer of eventual use of
military facilities in the event the United States were to
underwrite upgrading them was meant as a political
signal and nothing else.
He is credited with understanding the only limited
value of naval facilities on the Red Sea. which can be

bottled up bv the Suez Canal in the north and the Soviet
controlled Bab el-Mandeb straits to the south.
Even before Nimeiri's offer the Reagan adminis
tration had tripled its military assistance program to
$100 million starting in 1982 and could hardly do more in
view of the proffered facilities' limited value.
Nimeiri's public backing of Sadat also remains a
mystery and observers are far from convinced that he
cleared his surprise decision with Saudi Arabia.
In the Sudan's poor financial condition, continued
Saudi largesse — $300 million this year — is considered
crucial in priming the complicated pumps which the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, various
governments and more than 100 Western banks havede
vised for economic recovery.
Possible signs of Sudanese establishment concern
about Nimeiri's behavior were visible in the recent tes
timony before the Sudanese equivalent of parliament
by Foreign Minister Mohammed Mirghani.
He recalled traditional Sudanese diplomatic truisms
— eight neighbors, crossroads of the Arab and African
world, ties with East and West and non-alignment.
He did not need to underline that Sudan's politics of
accommodation had not been modified to the extent of
widening Nimeiri's anti-Soviet remarks to com
promise his excellent relations with his Moscow
backed neighbor, Ethiopia.
More cynical observers question the wisdom of ad
vertising pro-Egyptian sentiments since they are con
vinced that Sadat has little choice but to support
Nimeiri in any case. No matter which governments are
in power in Cairo and Khartoum, friendly or rival, his
torically they have been fated to cooperate because of
their common interest in protecting the waters of the
Nile.

Saudi largesse — $300 million this year — is considered
crucial in priming the complicated pumps which the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, various
governments and more than 100 Western banks havede
vised for economic recovery.
Possible signs of Sudanese establishment concern
about Nimeiri's behavior were visible in the recent tes
timony before the Sudanese equivalent of parliament
by Foreign Minister Mohammed Mirghani.
He recalled traditional Sudanese diplomatic truisms
— eight neighbors, crossroads of the Arab and African
world, ties with East and West and non-alignment.
He did not need to underline that Sudan's politics of
accommodation had not been modified to the extent of
widening Nimeiri's anti-Soviet remarks to com
promise his excellent relations with his Moscow
backed neighbor, Ethiopia.
More cynical observers question the wisdom of ad
vertising pro-Egyptian sentiments since they are con
vinced that Sadat has little choice but to support
Nimeiri in any case. No matter which governments are
in power in Cairo and Khartoum, friendly or rival, his
torically they have been fated to cooperate because of
their common interest in protecting the waters of the
Nile.
Khartoum, Sudan — Why would a veteran Third
World leader abandon classic fence-straddling
diplomacy and throw himself publicly into Washing
ton's embrace, much to the Reagan administration's
apparent surprise?
Assuming Sudanese President Jaafar Nimeiri ac
cepted that reading of his recent conduct, his answer
very likely would be the clear and present danger he
feels Libyan Col. Muammar Khadafy represents for his
nearly 12-year-old government.
But to his 20 million subjects that alone does not ex
plain why he has embraced the Reagan adminis
tration's anti-Soviet world view or broken Arab ranks
by exchanging ambassadors again with the ostracized
government of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
Decisive role
Few Sudanese would dispute Nimeiri's right to be
suspicious of Khadafy. especially since the Libyans' de
cisive military role in ending the civil war to its own lik
ing in neighboring Chad last December
Despite initially excellent relations, the two leaders
have waged a kind of personal holy war against each
other for years and Nimeiri is still infuriated by
Khadafv's backing for a nearly successful and very
bloody coup attempt here in 1976
What questions are raised locally about Nimeiri's
present stance concern his wisdom in seeking a public
confrontation with Khadafy, who is buoyed by his suc
cess in Chad and by his petrodollar wealth.
No easy solution
For Nimeiri is beset by financial problems which
some economists maintain have reduced the Sudan to a
basket case and in any event promise no early or easy
solution.

Only last January three days of demonstrations in
the western province of Darfur near the Chadian border
greeted Nimeiri's efforts to impose as governor an old
army colleague detested by the local citizenry.
Depending on which officials are talking. Libyan
money may or may not have been involved in the
Darfur demonstrations in which 80 Sudanese were in
jured. But the lesson was that Nimeiri was forced to
back down and replace the governor in a humiliating
blow to his prestige.
Regional elections
Further complicating Nimeiri's task was his de
cision to embark on a publicly popular but apparently
unfinanced effort to organize six regional government
elections in Africa's largest country.
Nor has that scheme's predecessor — the local auton
omy the Arab north granted the largely Christian south
in 1972 after more than a decade of fighting — gone
without hitches. At present the south is smoldering
against a decision to ship oil discovered on its territory
to a refinery in the north.
Nimeiri's local critics and some diplomats wonder if
he has not embarked on his pro-Western confrontation
policy to divert attention from the grim domestic situ
ation. The recent 25th anniversary of independence
from Britain has done little to enhance his prestige as
Sudanese looked back at colonial rule with nostalgic
mixed emotions.
Critics argue that Nimeiri's seemingly unsolicited —
and now all but abandoned — offer of eventual use of
military facilities in the event the United States were to
underwrite upgrading them was meant as a political
signal and nothing else.
He is credited with understanding the only limited
value of naval facilities on the Red Sea. which can be

bottled up bv the Suez Canal in the north and the Soviet
controlled Bab el-Mandeb straits to the south.
Even before Nimeiri's offer the Reagan adminis
tration had tripled its military assistance program to
$100 million starting in 1982 and could hardly do more in
view of the proffered facilities' limited value.
Nimeiri's public backing of Sadat also remains a
mystery and observers are far from convinced that he
cleared his surprise decision with Saudi Arabia.
