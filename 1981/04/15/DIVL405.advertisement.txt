A pilot's license can help you save fuel and travel time
One of the modern fuel efficient aircraft available to club
members will let you reduce trip distances by as much as
one-third, by flying in a straight line And it gives you better
mileage than a mid-size car at 2 to 4 times the speed If
time, reduced distances, or lower fuel oosts per trip could
be worth something to you, join us
Learning to fly is an unusual experience few share and
none forget Many have obtained a Soto-License for less
than $432, or with only 9 to 18 hours of flight time To
