## Shuttle completes mission with perfect landing Vehicle proves it can operate both in space and atmosphere 
### Los Angeles Times 
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. —
The space shuttle Columbia fell from
the sky with grace here yesterday,
making a landing as successful as its
launching had been more than 54 hours
earlier and proving that a vehicle can
operate equally both in the vacuum of
space and the cushioned air of the
earth's atmosphere.
"What a way to come to Califor
nia!" said astronaut Robert Crippen,
as Columbia soared over the coastline.
Columbia was the first vehicle ever
to leave the earth under rocket power
and return to earth on the wings of an
aircraft. This concept of a reusable
space plane is central to America's
future in space.
Space agency officials, aerospace
industry workers, and an enthusiastic
public were awed at the ease and
smoothness with which Columbia
swooped down out of a clear blue sky
and once again made contact with sol
id earth.
But none was as happy as the two
men who had flown Columbia: John
Young, 50, who had just completed his
fifth space flight, and Crippen, 43, who
had completed his first.
Columbia's final 10 hours in space
were busy ones for Young and Crip
pen, but not so busy to preclude a bit of
fun with the controllers at Houston.
The wake-up call that Mission Con
trol beamed up to the spaceplane at
approximately 12 a.m. (PST) began
with raucous music from an old Spike
Jones record, followed by a blaring
rendition of reveille, and some good
natured needling from the controllers.
The two astronauts took the banter
in stride — they had already been up
and at work for at least 30 minutes.
They breakfasted and buttoned up
Columbia for its four orbits.
Loose equipment wua utowcd, in
strumentation systems recalibrated

and other systems checked. They
donned space suits in case the Colum
bia's cabin lost pressure, and then
closed the clam shell doors on the
cargo bay. It was then only three hours
before landing.
Firing selected thrusters in the nose
and tail, Young turned the Columbia
around and dipped its nose so that it
was now flying tail-first and nose
down. Then he slammed on the brakes
of the space vehicle by firing rocket
engines against the direction of travel
at 9:21 a.m. (PST).
The force of the firing slowed the
Columbia's speed as it was still 172
miles above the South Indian Ocean.
Columbia started to sink toward the
surface that it had left two days
earlier.
Young then turned Columbia around
so that it was once again flying for
ward, at a nose-high angle. In this
position, the spaceplane was trying to
take the brunt of re-entry heating
where its thermal protection system
was best prepared to take it: on the
belly and undersides of the wing. It
began to slam into molecules of air off
an altitude of about 400.000 feet, just
past the island of Guam.
Only seconds before Columbia be
came enclosed in a sheath of blazing,
electrified air particles — the sheath
that disrupts normal radio trans
missions and thus is called a "com
munications blackout" — mission
control in Houston called out "Ev
erything looks perfect going over the
hill. Nice and easy does it, John."
Shortly after 7 a.m., radio contact
was restored. Mission control looked
at the telemetry information being
transmitted down to ground stations
and told the astronauts that their
flight path could not have been better:
" Vt.w'r® coming riggk*t down the
chute."

transmitted down to ground stations
and told the astronauts that their
flight path could not have been better:
" Vt.w'r® coming riggk*t down the
