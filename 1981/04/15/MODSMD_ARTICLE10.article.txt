# Rodin exhibit reopens at Museum
## 
### Marianne Villanueva 
This year must be considered a banner
year for the Stanford Art Museum. After ex
tensive renovation, the south rotunda of the
Museum has now become the permanent
home of the largest Rodin collection outside
of Paris.
The rotunda is located directly to the
right of what was formerly the Rodin Room,
in the left wing of the Museum as one enters
the main entrance. Built in 1891, it is one of
the oldest surviving parts of the museum,
and dates from Rodin's lifetime. Originally
designed as a sculpture court, it was trans
formed after World War I into a botany li
brary, and its original two-story ap
pearance was altered by the addition of a
false second story.
During the recent renovation, however,
the false second story was removed, restor
ing the room to its original appearance. To
day, an upper gallery supported by marble
columns rings the upper half of the room.
High windows lining the room and a skylight
provide brilliant natural light.
As one walks into the rotunda today, the
entire display is stafiflerinfi. There are 55
pieces on the first floor, and 85 on the sec
ond. The more famous Rodin sculptures,
such as "The Walking Man," "The Mon
ument to Balzac," "The Kiss," and the
studies for "The Burgers of Calais," are
on the first floor. But the upper gallery con
tains much of the rich didactic material that
makes the Stanford Museum not only an
aesthetic, but an educational experience as

well.
Rodin believed that art should ennoble,
instruct, and edify the general public. The
Stanford Museum is the only one in the
world that shows all the stages of the
sculpture-making process. Plaster
sculptures and their bronze counterparts
are placed side by side. One display, entitled
"The Succubus," is shown at three different
stages: in its original plaster form, as an un
finished cast before removal of the bronze
channels, and as a finished bronze. Portrait
sculptures are placed side by side with ac
tual photographs of the model who posed for
them, so that one can actually see the
creativity at work as the artist transferred
his perceptions of the model into the final
sculpture.
Indeed, no aspect of the artist's life and
work seems to have been left out of the dis
play. The exhibit includes a number of
smaller pieces which Rodin made as "es
says" or studies in movement. Unlike the
larger pieces, these were not meant for pub
lic display. Museum Curator Albert Elsen
refers to them as "private art," because
they were an end in themselves. The exhibit
also includes examples of Ftcjclin's coin
mercial art — the work he sold to support
himself while he was working on his various
projects. Last but not least, the exhibit also
contains a number of photographs taken in
Rodin's lifetime under his guidance which
show the way he wanted people to view his
sculpture.
If only to emphasize the fact that the

Rodin Museum has been a learning ex
perience for both faculty and students,
Elsen says that the Rodin exhibit which is to
open in the East Wing of the National Gal
lery in Washington, D.C. on June 28 is "very
substantially a Stanford production." Thir
ty-five pieces from the Stanford collection
will be sent to the National Gallery in mid-
May, among which the more famous ones
will be "The Kiss," "The Walking Man,"
and the "Naked Balzac with Folded Arms."
Elsen himself will direct the exhibit, which
is said to be the largest Rodin exhibition
ever held. A few Stanford graduate students
— Joanne Paradise, Rosilyn Jamison, and
Dan Rosenfeld — contributed essays to the
catalog, as did former Stanford graduate
now teaching at New York University, Kirk
Varnedoe.
At a press preview for the newly renovat
ed south rotunda held last Friday, April 10,
Gerald Cantor, the man who was respon
sible for establishing and enlarging the Uni
versity's Rodin collection, told reporters
how 33 years of collecting Rodin had begun
with a walk down Madison Avenue, shortly
after the war, where he found and bought his
first sculpture, a smsll hand of God. Now.
he is about to open the world's highest
museum — a "sculpture center" on the
105 th floor of the World Trade Center in New
York City. As he surveyed the south rotun
da, reporters pressed him for his reactions
to the display.
"I can't talk," he said. "There's nothing
to say. I keep looking at the room . . . It's
perfection itself."
