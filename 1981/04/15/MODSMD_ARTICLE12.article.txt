# Marxism vs. The New Right:
## Prof. Eric Hobsbawm sees a choice between socialism and barbarism 
### Jiri Weiss 
Eric Hobsbau m. a professor
at the Universit\ of London, is
one of the West's most dist
inguished Marxist historians.
He looked the part us he spoke
while puffing on his pipe and
adjusting his thick glasses.
Hobsbawm was visiting Stan
ford's new Humanities Center
and delivered thr first lecture in
the center's sprint• series.
Hobsbawm was horn in Alex
andria. and educated in Vien
na, Berlin, London and Cam
bridge. He has treated a range
of topics in such widely known
works as his Industry arid Em
pire, an economic history of
England since 1750, and The
Age of Revolution, Europe,
1789-1848.
Daily: How has the way his
torians study history changed?
Hobsbawm : There has been a
change from a strict narrative
discipline to one which tries to
establish patterns and general
ize in the same way the social
sciences do. The old military
and diplomatic history was sim
ply not good enough. What has
been realized is that people can
not just decide to do something;
there are constraints.
Daily: Do historians affect

history?
Hpbsbau m: One thing which
is quite clear is that nobody
takes any notice of what his
torians say. The people that say
that they are going to learn the
lessons of history don't do it
They have already decided what
they will pick out of history and
what historians they will get it
from.
In my country the govern
ment is doing exactly the same
thing about the depression that
governments did 45 years ago.
And that was exactly the wrong
thing. Many people could have
told this to Mrs. Thatcher but
she found people, economists
and others whom she preferred
to believe.
On the other hand historians
have had an enormous effect,
not necessarily the best his
torians, in most movements of
national independence.
History is almost always used
to shape aspirations; that is
clear with national history. It is
taught in every country. Some
of it is fairytale like George
Washington and the cherry tree.
Historians establish the
matrix within which the new na
tion will actually develop. Hu
man beings can only situate
themselves with regard to other
human beings or society by es
tablishing a relationship with
their own past.
All decisions are based upon
the past. There is no way of
dividing past, present and
future, it is a continuum. In one
way or another people are doing
history even if they say that
they want to do what has never
been done before. People look at
family albums and they set up
monuments.
People need history but they
do not quite know what they
want and why they want it. They
can't see any practical value in
visiting the Lincoln Memorial
but that they do visit it.
Hobsbawm illustrated the
difference between historical
and unhistorical thinking:
For someone with no knowl
edge of history there is no way
any piece of news is probable,
plausible or improbable.
Last June the computers in
dicated that Soviet nuclear mis
siles were coming across until it
was discovered that it was a me
chanical fault, a computer
malfunction. That was a pro
cedure that owed nothing to his
tory, it assumed that anything
might happen at any time. For a
historian it would have taken
less then the three minutes to
know that it couldn't be true be
cause any war has to be pre
pared. A war has never broken
out without a warning.
Daily : Can history be an ob
jective science?
Hobsbawm:l like to think
that what is an objective science
is due for a certain amount of re
thinking right now. The model
for what a science should be like
has been based on Galileo. It is
an enormously powerful model.
But there are others. It is not
clear that this physical para
digm is going to outlast the 20th
century.
If science is defined in the
Galilean way then history is ob
viously not a science and it is not
likely to be.
The ideal way to study sci
ence is to isolate something you
are studying, isolate just that.
But if you take a science like
ecology you cannot operate that
way, the same is true for his

tory
Daily: In spite of the fact that
you criticize some Marxist re
gimes for their inhumanity and
advocate a revision of Marx,
you still remain a Marxist;
why? (Hobsbawm has been a
member of Britain's com
munist party in the past, but de
clined to comment on his pres
ent reltionship.)
Hobsbawm:l don't criticize
Marxism in criticizing a great
many things that have been
done in its name
One problem I see is that the
Marxist method of analysing so
ciety has hardly ever been ap
plied to the so-called socialist
countries as it has been applied
to the capitalist countries
I became a Marxist partly for
political reasons. I grew up in
central Europe I was in high

school in Berlin just before
Hitler came to power and conse
quently it was a natural thing.
I lived through my younger
years in period of anti-fascism.
We believed that the Com
munist movement and the Sovi
et Union were the major
bulwarks for the defense of. if
you excuse the word, civ
ilization against fascism.
Like other intellectuals I dis
covered that this political com
mitment implied an extremely
fascinating theory which did
alow one to make sense of the
world.
Marxism is the best approach
to history. I got my degree by
reading Das Kapital and Lenin.
I got a great deal of mileage
out of that chiefly because my
professors had not read it.
Marxism has helped to trans
form history, all history, even of
historians that aren't Marxists.
It is not a straightforward
machine for getting the right re
sults. It gives you a rough idea of
priorities — it gives you an idea
of what to look for first in a par
ticular period. It is a good guide
to what is at first an incredible
confusion.
I think one must distinguish
between Marxism which im
plies the kind of born-again
dogma with which you can no
longer tamper; this is the of
ficial Marxism of most govern
ments claiming to be Marxist,
and Marxism as a way of in
terpreting the world in order to
change it.
Daily: But hasn't the British
Labour party tried to 'change

the world' 0 There has been a
swing to the left but there is
such dissatisfaction with it.
Hobsbau m There has been a
swing to the left But mind you,
Marxism is a kind of a button
that everyone puts on and it is
not clear what it indicates To
have the old man with the white
beard merely indicates that you
would like to be on the left, pref
erably on the far left.
What has happened in Britain
is that there has been a loss of
support for both major parties.
The labor movement has been
having its traditional support
eroded because they are becom
ing a smaller portion of the pop
ulation and partly because a
number of these people are no
longer satisfied One problem is
to get those that did vote for

Labour back again. Shift to the
left has become possible be
cause of the erosion of the mass
support of the party. It is not
now a party with a mass mem
bership and that is why the mili
tants are so visible.
There is a tremendous sense
of inertia in political move
ments — they do tend to go back
to certainties. You can find it on
the right. For example, many
Americans wish this country
were like Little r?n
the I*rairie. It isn't. There is a
similar tendency of people on
the left to go back and repeat
standard old phrases about na
tionalizing everything.
It is clear that the economy
has to be managed. But in my
country many industries have
been nationalized, and some
work while others don't.
More and more people are
goii.j, to discover that more is
needed than a repetition of veri
ties of either right or left. That
does not mean that the labor
movement is wrong because, as
far as Britain is concerned, it is
clear that capitalism is not
working.
If it has worked brilliantly
over the past 25 years it has not
done so because it has operated
on the basis of unrestricted
private enterprise.
In a broader sense the choices
are between socialism and a re
lapse into barbarism, but it is a
long way between making a
diagnosis and working out a
cure.

What has happened in Britain
is that there has been a loss of
support for both major parties.
The labor movement has been

There is a tremendous sense

Americans wish this country
were like Little r?n

similar tendency of people on
the left to go back and repeat
standard old phrases about na
tionalizing everything.
It is clear that the economy
has to be managed. But in my
country many industries have
been nationalized, and some
work while others don't.
More and more people are
goii.j, to discover that more is
needed than a repetition of veri
ties of either right or left. That
does not mean that the labor
movement is wrong because, as
far as Britain is concerned, it is
clear that capitalism is not
working.
If it has worked brilliantly
over the past 25 years it has not
done so because it has operated
on the basis of unrestricted
private enterprise.
In a broader sense the choices

Dr. Eric Hobsbawm
Eric Hobsbau m. a professor
at the Universit\ of London, is
one of the West's most dist
inguished Marxist historians.
He looked the part us he spoke
while puffing on his pipe and
adjusting his thick glasses.
Hobsbawm was visiting Stan
ford's new Humanities Center
and delivered thr first lecture in
the center's sprint• series.
Hobsbawm was horn in Alex
andria. and educated in Vien
na, Berlin, London and Cam
bridge. He has treated a range
of topics in such widely known
works as his Industry arid Em
pire, an economic history of
England since 1750, and The
Age of Revolution, Europe,
1789-1848.
Daily: How has the way his
torians study history changed?
Hobsbawm : There has been a
change from a strict narrative
discipline to one which tries to
establish patterns and general
ize in the same way the social
sciences do. The old military
and diplomatic history was sim
ply not good enough. What has
been realized is that people can
not just decide to do something;
there are constraints.
Daily: Do historians affect

history?
Hpbsbau m: One thing which
is quite clear is that nobody
takes any notice of what his
torians say. The people that say
that they are going to learn the
lessons of history don't do it
They have already decided what
they will pick out of history and
what historians they will get it
from.
In my country the govern
ment is doing exactly the same
thing about the depression that
governments did 45 years ago.
And that was exactly the wrong
thing. Many people could have
told this to Mrs. Thatcher but
she found people, economists
and others whom she preferred
to believe.
On the other hand historians
have had an enormous effect,
not necessarily the best his
torians, in most movements of
national independence.
History is almost always used
to shape aspirations; that is
clear with national history. It is
taught in every country. Some
of it is fairytale like George
Washington and the cherry tree.
Historians establish the
matrix within which the new na
tion will actually develop. Hu
man beings can only situate
themselves with regard to other
human beings or society by es
tablishing a relationship with
their own past.
All decisions are based upon
the past. There is no way of
dividing past, present and
future, it is a continuum. In one
way or another people are doing
history even if they say that
they want to do what has never
been done before. People look at
family albums and they set up
monuments.
People need history but they
do not quite know what they
want and why they want it. They
can't see any practical value in
visiting the Lincoln Memorial
but that they do visit it.
Hobsbawm illustrated the
difference between historical
and unhistorical thinking:
For someone with no knowl
edge of history there is no way
any piece of news is probable,
plausible or improbable.
Last June the computers in
dicated that Soviet nuclear mis
siles were coming across until it
was discovered that it was a me
chanical fault, a computer
malfunction. That was a pro
cedure that owed nothing to his
tory, it assumed that anything
might happen at any time. For a
historian it would have taken
less then the three minutes to
know that it couldn't be true be
cause any war has to be pre
pared. A war has never broken
out without a warning.
Daily : Can history be an ob
jective science?
Hobsbawm:l like to think
that what is an objective science
is due for a certain amount of re
thinking right now. The model
for what a science should be like
has been based on Galileo. It is
an enormously powerful model.
But there are others. It is not
clear that this physical para
digm is going to outlast the 20th
century.
If science is defined in the
Galilean way then history is ob
viously not a science and it is not
likely to be.
The ideal way to study sci
ence is to isolate something you
are studying, isolate just that.
But if you take a science like
ecology you cannot operate that
way, the same is true for his

tory
Daily: In spite of the fact that
you criticize some Marxist re
gimes for their inhumanity and
advocate a revision of Marx,
you still remain a Marxist;
why? (Hobsbawm has been a
member of Britain's com
munist party in the past, but de
clined to comment on his pres
ent reltionship.)
Hobsbawm:l don't criticize
Marxism in criticizing a great
many things that have been
done in its name
One problem I see is that the
Marxist method of analysing so
ciety has hardly ever been ap
plied to the so-called socialist
countries as it has been applied
to the capitalist countries
I became a Marxist partly for
political reasons. I grew up in
central Europe I was in high

school in Berlin just before
Hitler came to power and conse
quently it was a natural thing.
I lived through my younger
years in period of anti-fascism.
We believed that the Com

have had an enormous effect,
not necessarily the best his
torians, in most movements of
national independence.
History is almost always used
to shape aspirations; that is
clear with national history. It is
taught in every country. Some
of it is fairytale like George
Washington and the cherry tree.
Historians establish the
matrix within which the new na
tion will actually develop. Hu
man beings can only situate
themselves with regard to other
human beings or society by es
tablishing a relationship with
their own past.
All decisions are based upon
the past. There is no way of
dividing past, present and
future, it is a continuum. In one
way or another people are doing
history even if they say that
they want to do what has never
been done before. People look at
family albums and they set up
monuments.
People need history but they
do not quite know what they
want and why they want it. They
can't see any practical value in
visiting the Lincoln Memorial
but that they do visit it.
Hobsbawm illustrated the
difference between historical
and unhistorical thinking:
For someone with no knowl
edge of history there is no way
any piece of news is probable,
plausible or improbable.
Last June the computers in
dicated that Soviet nuclear mis
siles were coming across until it
was discovered that it was a me
chanical fault, a computer
malfunction. That was a pro
cedure that owed nothing to his
tory, it assumed that anything
might happen at any time. For a
historian it would have taken
less then the three minutes to
know that it couldn't be true be
cause any war has to be pre
pared. A war has never broken
out without a warning.
Daily : Can history be an ob
jective science?
Hobsbawm:l like to think
that what is an objective science
is due for a certain amount of re
thinking right now. The model
for what a science should be like
has been based on Galileo. It is
an enormously powerful model.
But there are others. It is not
clear that this physical para
digm is going to outlast the 20th
century.
If science is defined in the
Galilean way then history is ob
viously not a science and it is not
likely to be.
The ideal way to study sci
ence is to isolate something you
are studying, isolate just that.
But if you take a science like
ecology you cannot operate that
way, the same is true for his

tory
Daily: In spite of the fact that
you criticize some Marxist re
gimes for their inhumanity and
advocate a revision of Marx,
you still remain a Marxist;
why? (Hobsbawm has been a
member of Britain's com
munist party in the past, but de
clined to comment on his pres
ent reltionship.)
Hobsbawm:l don't criticize
Marxism in criticizing a great
many things that have been
done in its name
One problem I see is that the
Marxist method of analysing so
ciety has hardly ever been ap
plied to the so-called socialist
countries as it has been applied
to the capitalist countries
I became a Marxist partly for
political reasons. I grew up in
central Europe I was in high

school in Berlin just before
Hitler came to power and conse
quently it was a natural thing.
I lived through my younger
years in period of anti-fascism.
We believed that the Com
munist movement and the Sovi
et Union were the major
bulwarks for the defense of. if
you excuse the word, civ
ilization against fascism.
Like other intellectuals I dis
covered that this political com
mitment implied an extremely
fascinating theory which did
alow one to make sense of the
world.
Marxism is the best approach
to history. I got my degree by
reading Das Kapital and Lenin.
I got a great deal of mileage
out of that chiefly because my
professors had not read it.
Marxism has helped to trans
form history, all history, even of
historians that aren't Marxists.
It is not a straightforward
machine for getting the right re
sults. It gives you a rough idea of
priorities — it gives you an idea
of what to look for first in a par
ticular period. It is a good guide
to what is at first an incredible
confusion.
I think one must distinguish
between Marxism which im
plies the kind of born-again
dogma with which you can no
longer tamper; this is the of
ficial Marxism of most govern
ments claiming to be Marxist,
and Marxism as a way of in
terpreting the world in order to
change it.
Daily: But hasn't the British
Labour party tried to 'change

the world' 0 There has been a
swing to the left but there is
such dissatisfaction with it.
Hobsbau m There has been a
swing to the left But mind you,
Marxism is a kind of a button
that everyone puts on and it is
not clear what it indicates To
have the old man with the white
beard merely indicates that you
would like to be on the left, pref
erably on the far left.
What has happened in Britain
is that there has been a loss of
support for both major parties.
The labor movement has been
having its traditional support
eroded because they are becom
ing a smaller portion of the pop
ulation and partly because a
number of these people are no
longer satisfied One problem is
to get those that did vote for

Labour back again. Shift to the
left has become possible be
cause of the erosion of the mass
support of the party. It is not
now a party with a mass mem
bership and that is why the mili
tants are so visible.
There is a tremendous sense
of inertia in political move
ments — they do tend to go back
to certainties. You can find it on
the right. For example, many
Americans wish this country
were like Little r?n
the I*rairie. It isn't. There is a
similar tendency of people on
the left to go back and repeat
standard old phrases about na
tionalizing everything.
It is clear that the economy
has to be managed. But in my
country many industries have
been nationalized, and some
work while others don't.
More and more people are
goii.j, to discover that more is
needed than a repetition of veri
ties of either right or left. That
does not mean that the labor
movement is wrong because, as
far as Britain is concerned, it is
clear that capitalism is not
working.
If it has worked brilliantly
over the past 25 years it has not
done so because it has operated
on the basis of unrestricted
private enterprise.
In a broader sense the choices
are between socialism and a re
lapse into barbarism, but it is a
long way between making a
diagnosis and working out a
cure.

Dr. Eric Hobsbawm
Eric Hobsbau m. a professor
at the Universit\ of London, is
one of the West's most dist
inguished Marxist historians.
He looked the part us he spoke
while puffing on his pipe and
adjusting his thick glasses.
Hobsbawm was visiting Stan
ford's new Humanities Center
and delivered thr first lecture in
the center's sprint• series.
Hobsbawm was horn in Alex
andria. and educated in Vien
na, Berlin, London and Cam
bridge. He has treated a range
of topics in such widely known
works as his Industry arid Em
pire, an economic history of
England since 1750, and The
Age of Revolution, Europe,
1789-1848.
Daily: How has the way his
torians study history changed?
Hobsbawm : There has been a
change from a strict narrative
discipline to one which tries to
establish patterns and general
ize in the same way the social
sciences do. The old military
and diplomatic history was sim
ply not good enough. What has
been realized is that people can
not just decide to do something;
there are constraints.
Daily: Do historians affect

history?
Hpbsbau m: One thing which
is quite clear is that nobody
takes any notice of what his
torians say. The people that say
that they are going to learn the
lessons of history don't do it
They have already decided what
they will pick out of history and
what historians they will get it
from.
In my country the govern
ment is doing exactly the same
thing about the depression that
governments did 45 years ago.
And that was exactly the wrong
thing. Many people could have
told this to Mrs. Thatcher but
she found people, economists
and others whom she preferred
to believe.
On the other hand historians
have had an enormous effect,
not necessarily the best his
torians, in most movements of
national independence.
History is almost always used
to shape aspirations; that is
clear with national history. It is
taught in every country. Some
