# Unendorsed candidates reply
## 
### 
()n Monday and yesterday,
following Friday's final dead
line for declaration of can
didacy. the Daily published its
endorsements of candidates
running for the ASSU Senate.
Here, the Daily is providing
space for rebuttal to those can
didates who were not endorsed.
Cricket Barlow
This campus needs new life!
The posters of me licking an ice
cream cone I hope reflect my
light-hearted personality. How
ever, I do take the issues seri
ously.
My intention is to focus the
ASSU on the students again.
Through concerts, a student
union, and a closer relationship
between faculty and students,
the ASSU can promote cohesive
ness in student activities. Have
you ever noticed that the only
weekend activities are dorm or
fraternity sponsored?
I am presently working on the
Student Alumni Network
(S.T.A.N.) whose major em
phasis is to support class togeth
erness. But Stanford not only
needs class interaction but uni
versity interaction as well. This
can be done by forming a stu
dent union to accomodate the
needs of all students. We need a
central meeting place to serve
as a comfortable alternative for
everyone.
I propose that we renovate
Tresidder so that it can be used
both day and night. The way to
achieve this is through a concen
trated effort of the senate. In
stead of delegating powers to
committees, why not use the
power of the senate effectively,
to follow through on these pro
posals.
The senate has a lot of poten
tial power, and I've seen that
through student initiative,
projects can be accomplished.
The senate can only do as much
as the students are willing to put
into it. I'm enthusiastic and
ready to take on the responsi
bilities of the senate as a body
working for the students.
So vote for Cricket Barlow,
and together we can lick the sys
tem.

Caroline Cheng
As a committee staff assis
tant, COP-intern, and ex-officio
member of the Nominations
Committee for the ASSU, I re
alize the importance of the
Committee System, where stu
dents can directly influence
University policy from the
Pass/No Credit option to the
Western Culture requirement.
Through the Committee Sys
tem, we can make the ASSU
stronger in influencing decision
making which greatly affects
students.
The ASSU lacks a centralized
publicity network. The result is
that people rarely know what
the senate and the ASSU are
doing. Monthly newsletters
about ASSU activities, and put
ting such information in regis
tration packets can improve
communication. Having more
polls, forums and senate meet
ings in dorms are other ways of
finding out student needs and
directing attention to them.
I am concerned about bring
ing student groups not tradi
tionally associated with the
ASSU such as ethnic and wom
en's organizations closer to the
ASSU by allowing them to give
monthly presentations before
the senate.
Although the ASSU repre
sents both graduates and under
grads, graduate issues have not
often been at the forefront of the
senate. Federal budget cuts and
the lack of graduate housing
should also be important issues.
How many of you felt that the
Approaching Stanford gave you
a feel for Stanford before you
came here? Graduate students
don't have that. I want to set up
a Graduate Approaching Stan
ford.
One way to counteract the ris
ing cost of education would be
the creation of a book exchange
or rental system for those who
want it. I propose to continue
the research started by last
year's senate and make buying
books more equitable.
Ultimately, the ASSU is a stu
dent service. Through better
communication and organiza
tion we can make it more re

sponsive to students.
Tom Dill
My name is Tom Dill and I am
a junior majoring in political
science. Due to extenuating cir
cumstances I was unable to at
tend my Daily interview and I
appreciate this opportunity to
express my views. The issues I
see as important to the student
body of Stanford University in
clude the following:
Take an in-depth look at the
possibility of having Special
Events (concerts) on campus.
There is sufficient interest to
warrant a re-attempt at co-pro
ducing a concert at Stanford.
This co-production could be
used as a case study and stu
dents could learn from pro
moters how to properly struc
ture a concert. It would also
enable the ASSU to determine
the feasibility of future concerts
on campus.
Improve relations between
the ASSU and Tresidder. The
ASSU should consider the ad
vantages of incorporating the
Recreation Center and The
Store into student-run organiza
tions. Such a restructuring
would make the facilities more
reflective of student needs and
improve their appropriateness
on campus. Revise the structure
of the Fee Assessment system.
Review ASSU projects. The
Typesetting service has lost
money in the past and the Typ
ing Service may not be in ex
istence next year. These ser
vices must be reviewed and re
organized along more efficient
lines. The senate must narrow
its objectives to achieve its
goals.
Finally, improved com
munication between the ASSU
and the student body is essential
if the senate is to remain an ef
fective organization of student
government. Vote Tom Dill for
ASSU Senate April 15 and 16.
Paul Elliott, Jan Rang
We are running for the senate
because we believe that any stu
dent political organization, no
matter how trivial, can become
a significant voice for change
within the University. The sen
ate need not be an organization
dedicated to the self-aggran
dizement of its few members.
The senate will become impor
tant only when its members be
gin to address fundamental is
sues and not petty student con
cerns. We do not advocate the
use of the senate as a forum for
the airing of national and in
ternational issues, but neither
do we believe that the senate
should consciously seek to avoid
controversy. We believe that
the senate should address, and
through its influence with the
University administration and
campus-wide public opinion,
seek a remedy for several seri
ous campus problems:
1. There is no reason for the
return of the "F" grade apart
from a peculiar desire on the
part of certain faculty to impose
their own sense of "merito
cracy" on the undergraduate
population. It is impossible to
quantify learning either numer
ically or with a letter grade.
2. Fraternities have prac
ticed open and notorious racial
discrimination for decades.
What have the frats done to
remedy their record of past dis
crimination? How many mem
bers of minority communities
feel welcome on the row? We
believe the frats should under
take a sincere affirmative ac
tion program. Otherwise Stan
ford in good conscience cannot
