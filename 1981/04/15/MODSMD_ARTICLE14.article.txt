# Unendorsed candidates reply
## 
### 
()n Monday and yesterday,
following Friday's final dead
line for declaration of can
didacy. the Daily published its
endorsements of candidates
running for the ASSU Senate.
Here, the Daily is providing
space for rebuttal to those can
didates who were not endorsed.
Cricket Barlow
This campus needs new life!
The posters of me licking an ice
cream cone I hope reflect my
light-hearted personality. How
ever, I do take the issues seri
ously.
My intention is to focus the
ASSU on the students again.
Through concerts, a student
union, and a closer relationship
between faculty and students,
the ASSU can promote cohesive
ness in student activities. Have
you ever noticed that the only
weekend activities are dorm or
fraternity sponsored?
I am presently working on the
Student Alumni Network
(S.T.A.N.) whose major em
phasis is to support class togeth
erness. But Stanford not only
needs class interaction but uni
versity interaction as well. This
can be done by forming a stu
dent union to accomodate the
needs of all students. We need a
central meeting place to serve
as a comfortable alternative for
everyone.
I propose that we renovate
Tresidder so that it can be used
both day and night. The way to
achieve this is through a concen
trated effort of the senate. In
stead of delegating powers to
committees, why not use the
power of the senate effectively,
to follow through on these pro
posals.
The senate has a lot of poten
tial power, and I've seen that
through student initiative,
projects can be accomplished.
The senate can only do as much
as the students are willing to put
into it. I'm enthusiastic and
ready to take on the responsi
bilities of the senate as a body
working for the students.
So vote for Cricket Barlow,
and together we can lick the sys
tem.

Caroline Cheng
As a committee staff assis
tant, COP-intern, and ex-officio
member of the Nominations
Committee for the ASSU, I re
alize the importance of the
Committee System, where stu
dents can directly influence
University policy from the
Pass/No Credit option to the
Western Culture requirement.
Through the Committee Sys
tem, we can make the ASSU
stronger in influencing decision
making which greatly affects
students.
The ASSU lacks a centralized
publicity network. The result is
that people rarely know what
the senate and the ASSU are
doing. Monthly newsletters
about ASSU activities, and put
ting such information in regis
tration packets can improve
communication. Having more
polls, forums and senate meet
ings in dorms are other ways of
finding out student needs and
directing attention to them.
I am concerned about bring
ing student groups not tradi
tionally associated with the
ASSU such as ethnic and wom
en's organizations closer to the
ASSU by allowing them to give
monthly presentations before
the senate.
Although the ASSU repre
sents both graduates and under
grads, graduate issues have not
often been at the forefront of the
senate. Federal budget cuts and
the lack of graduate housing
should also be important issues.
How many of you felt that the
Approaching Stanford gave you
a feel for Stanford before you
came here? Graduate students
don't have that. I want to set up
a Graduate Approaching Stan
ford.
One way to counteract the ris
ing cost of education would be
the creation of a book exchange
or rental system for those who
want it. I propose to continue
the research started by last
year's senate and make buying
books more equitable.
Ultimately, the ASSU is a stu
dent service. Through better
communication and organiza
tion we can make it more re

sponsive to students.
Tom Dill
My name is Tom Dill and I am
a junior majoring in political
science. Due to extenuating cir
cumstances I was unable to at
tend my Daily interview and I
appreciate this opportunity to
express my views. The issues I
see as important to the student
body of Stanford University in
clude the following:
Take an in-depth look at the
possibility of having Special
Events (concerts) on campus.
There is sufficient interest to
warrant a re-attempt at co-pro
ducing a concert at Stanford.
This co-production could be
used as a case study and stu
dents could learn from pro
moters how to properly struc
ture a concert. It would also
enable the ASSU to determine
the feasibility of future concerts
on campus.
Improve relations between
the ASSU and Tresidder. The
ASSU should consider the ad
vantages of incorporating the
Recreation Center and The
Store into student-run organiza
tions. Such a restructuring
would make the facilities more
reflective of student needs and
improve their appropriateness
on campus. Revise the structure
of the Fee Assessment system.
Review ASSU projects. The
Typesetting service has lost
money in the past and the Typ
ing Service may not be in ex
istence next year. These ser
vices must be reviewed and re
organized along more efficient
lines. The senate must narrow
its objectives to achieve its
goals.
Finally, improved com
munication between the ASSU
and the student body is essential
if the senate is to remain an ef
fective organization of student
government. Vote Tom Dill for
ASSU Senate April 15 and 16.
Paul Elliott, Jan Rang
We are running for the senate
because we believe that any stu
dent political organization, no
matter how trivial, can become
a significant voice for change
within the University. The sen
ate need not be an organization
dedicated to the self-aggran
dizement of its few members.
The senate will become impor
tant only when its members be
gin to address fundamental is
sues and not petty student con
cerns. We do not advocate the
use of the senate as a forum for
the airing of national and in
ternational issues, but neither
do we believe that the senate
should consciously seek to avoid
controversy. We believe that
the senate should address, and
through its influence with the
University administration and
campus-wide public opinion,
seek a remedy for several seri
ous campus problems:
1. There is no reason for the
return of the "F" grade apart
from a peculiar desire on the
part of certain faculty to impose
their own sense of "merito
cracy" on the undergraduate
population. It is impossible to
quantify learning either numer
ically or with a letter grade.
2. Fraternities have prac
ticed open and notorious racial
discrimination for decades.
What have the frats done to
remedy their record of past dis
crimination? How many mem
bers of minority communities
feel welcome on the row? We
believe the frats should under
take a sincere affirmative ac
tion program. Otherwise Stan
ford in good conscience cannot
continue to tolerate their pres
ence
3. Do House fellows always
do a good job? Res Ed should re
appoint resident fellows on a
merit basis and not as a per
petual system of cronyism
4 Ethnic theme houses
should be given an equal op
portunity share in the best of
Stanford housing. The place
ment of Casa Zapata in Stern
Hall is an affront to the Stanford
Chicano community.
Raga Klim
Elim is clearly one of this
year's strongest candidates.
Through his extensive ex
perience in leadership roles.
Elim has come to learn the im
portance of motivating people
and working well with others.
He is a very hard worker and he
has a unique ability of trans
ferring his enthusiasm to oth
ers, two qualities that would
make him a good senator. Final
ly, his work in the Om
budsman's office this past year
has given him a good insight into
the concerns and complaints of
the students.
Major concerns include:
Election Reform:
Have several opportunities
for the students to meet and
question the candidates.
Limit areas for posters to one
spot for each dorm and have this
rule strictly enforced.
Eliminate the Daily endorse
ments because it is not right
that a small panel of people
have that much influence in an
election.
Improve student body/senate
communications by having the
senate meetings in dorm
lounges. This will increase stu
dent input and make the senate
more visable.
Elim's only promise is hard
work and I think he deserves
your vote this Wednesday and
Thursday.
Fritz Fischer
My name is Fritz Fischer,
and my campaign for the senate
has one major theme, which can
best be expressed in a question
â€” Do you know what the ASSU
Senate does? If you are like
most students I've talked to,

your honest answer would be no.
This is a ridiculous problem.
The senate is the student's only
representative body, yet the stu
dents have absolutely no idea
what it does We see and learn
about the final results, yet we
have very little direct say in
their initiation.
I am currently a freshman,
and consider myself a "typical"
Stanford student, who is in
terested in the concerns of the
student body. My experience in
the ASSU is none, because I, like
most of you, had no idea what a
senator was or did until just re
cently. Yet I have been actively
involved in student government
in the past (high school, dorm
government) and am very will
ing to put in the time needed for
the job. It is essential that the
senate reflects true student
opinions in its decisions.
If the student body wants the
senate to represent the views of
the student body in world af
fairs, then the senate should. If
not, then the senate should not.
Ideas I have for increasing stu
dent involvement in the senate
include a senate liaison for each
dorm, open senate meetings in
dorms and dinners and social
events sponsored by the senate.
In short, the senate should be
what the students of Stanford
make it, and if elected I intend
to make it that way.
Jim Grundberg
I was disillusioned when I
read the Daily endorsements
the other day, if only because
their strong statements were
solely based on a short five
minute interview. Unless the
Daily is prepared to do a bit
more research than that, it has
no place in judging the abilities
of various candidates. The Dai
ly turned a very casual and un
professional interview into
some very powerful endorse
ments, and this represented a
total lack of responsibility on its
part.
Like most candidates, I could
have discussed some issues of
great concern to me, such as
bringing back concerts, "better
social life," or more student
faculty interaction in my Daily
"interview." I didn't have time
though, hence the editors ap

parently assumed I lacked'' sen
sitivity" to the important is
sues instead I took it as obvious
that we'd all like to see certain
improvements, and dealt with
the more fundamental question
â€” How can we improve the
process by which we can deal
with these issues? This year's
senate commands no respect
from the students, but students
can't be blamed because there
is no senate/student body in
teraction. Who is the senate rep
resenting?
We. as students, can have our
opinions heard, but only if we
first strengthen the network of
University policymaking, in
cluding the relationships be
tween the students and faculty,
the senate, and the decision
making committees. The senate
should keep in close touch with
student representatives on
these committees, and relay all
developments to students in the
form of senate meetings in
dorm lounges or dining halls.
ASSU sponsored educational fo
rums, to solicit student ideas,
are also necessary. Only if sena
tors concentrate their efforts
toward satisfying the foremost
needs and concerns of students,
will we make any progress
towards more effective student
representation at this school. A
vote for Jim Grundberg would
be a step in the right direction.
Paul Khavari
There is a vital point that
needs to be emphasized among
the factors of this year's cam
paign for the senate and it en
compasses the major concerns
receiving attention. This is the
absolute necessity of per
spective. For candidates so vo
cal about making Tresidder into
a real "student union," about
changing the Draw, about im
proving student-faculty rela
tions and about bringing back
concerts, this perspective is
crucial.
The ASSU functions on many
interfaces with University ad
ministration and it is here
where lack of perspective hurts
us, the students, the most. The
administration functions on
five- to 12-year guidelines while
all too many ASSU projects are
plagued with solely one year's

effort before being abandoned
The students must adjust to this
fact and realize that Tresidder
won't be transformed in three
quarters, that housing will be
radically affected by the new
dorms on the planning boards
and that student-faculty contact
can expand only through pa
tient, concerted and organized
effort among many other
things. Some candidates boast
of their desirable "freshness"
to the process and goals of the
association â€” a freshness that
might easily appear later as
costly ignorance
I am strongly against that
kind of instant success hopeful
ness. Only by being aware of
long-term trends as well as the
capacity for change that a sin
gle year involves will keep the
ASSU on a course most benefi
cial to the students in the long
run and prevent the kind of dis
organized, sporadic and ineffi
cient functioning that destroys
the organization's credibility in
the eyes of its members and hin
ders worthwhile achievement.
Perspective, then, is the fac
tor that will determine whether
the new senate will spend a
whole year discovering limita
tions and learning from their
mistakes only to leave when ap
proaching competency or
whether it will pick up on past
achievements and efficiently
apply their efforts to advance
student interests.
Bambi Markel
I would like to challenge the
Daily for neglecting to endorse
a single woman candidate for
the ASSU Senate. Woman make
up 45 percent of the Stanford
student body and deserve repre
sentation, especially as several
qualified female candidates are
running. I would also like to
point out the differences be
tween the other candidates and
myself, to clarify my particular
qualifications and ideas:
1) I was appointed to the Sub
committee on the Evaluation
and Improvement of Teaching. I
realize that certain depart
ments, especially math, object
to the very existence of the
ASSU Course Guide. As sena
tor, I would work to retain and
improve the Guide. Students

are the best judges of a pro
fessor's ability to teach stu
dents deserve to benefit from
the opinions of other students
2) The ASSU Finance Com
mittee must have a greater role
in auditing the finances of stu
dent organizations Presently,
student groups outline potential
budgets before the Finance
Committee, which then awards
funds, drawn from tuition The
senate does not require student
groups to report back to the Fi
nance Committee concerning
how they have actually spent
the funds With greater accoun
tability to the Finance Commit
tee, financial crises such as that
experienced by Special Events
could be recognized and dealt
with at an early stage Concerts
could be brought back and man
aged efficiently.
3) Through the senate, stu
dents can be influential political
lobbyists when necessary.
Educated by ASSU forums such
as the one on El Salvador, the
student body can then choose
whether or not to act For exam
ple, the Reagan administration
has slashed government-spon
sored student grants and loans.
If the senate discovered,
through polls, student opposi
tion to these cuts, the senate
could protest through a
statement backed by the entire
student bodv.
I have the initiative, creativi
ty, and energy to act on behalf of
YOUR and my ideas. If you
would like to see a more visible
and effective student senate,
please vote for Bambi Markel
on April 15 and 16.
Tracey Minkin
In a short campaign week that
feels like six months, the faces
and words of the senate race
have formed a smiling
homogeneous blur. Concerts,
lighting, linen, El Salvador
these catch-phrases are bounc
ing care-freely from one speech
to the next knock on the door.
Today and tomorrow, 35 or so
names will emerge from this
cloud and ask for your approval
and up to 10 votes. Where, then,
to check?
Consider my approach. I see
the problem areas and am con
cerned about the '81-'B2 Stan
ford issues, but will not act as a
senator until an intelligent and
comprehensive survey is done
this spring, advisably through
Residential Education chan

nels, and specific short-com
mgs. strengths, needs and alter
natives are discerned With this
detailed information, what
looks to be a new senate com
mitted to ASSU can take de
cisive and unified action.
This is the machinery behind
the word "priorities."
Personally, I have put this job
in the absolute forefront of my
outlook for/iext year, and view
the accompanying responsi
bilities very, very seriously.
This job is m\ priority.
So, confronted in the coming
days with the lengthy list of the
senate 35, please remember
that thinking and commitment
will make the difference in a
senator
Out of the issues blur, I will
give you both of those.
Marty Roberts
My name is Marty Roberts
and I am running for the ASSU
Senate My experience includes
being a member of the Califor
nia State Champion Parlia
mentary Procedure Team. With
this background I feel that I
would be well qualified to serve
as Senate Parliamentarian.
Other activities include being a
member of the 1979 National
Champion livestock judging
team, a KZSU sportscaster, a
member of the wrestling team,
and an active participant in
NCAA rodeo.
1 am very enthusiastic about
the senate's increasing ability
to respond to student concerns
and would very much like to be a
part of this process. This year's
senate has worked to improve
the senate's interaction with
students. We must continue this
effort through newsletters,
sherry hours, the creation of a
publicity committee, and more
frequent polling on important
issues.
Minority concerns should not
be just a concern of the groups
involved â€” they affect the en
tire community. The senate
should strive toward achieving
a better life for minorities at
Stanford. This means paying
special attention to minority
groups when deciding on group
funding.
Have you spent an all-nighter
at the CPPC? Many students
have! This problem can be dealt
with by the creation of a senate
task force to look into the CPPC
procedures.

The ASSU provides many stu
dent services such as lecture
notes, typing. T-shirts, etc I
propose that the ASSU create a
Bus Service to make buses
available for dorm trips and oth
er campus group activities The
advantages of the service would
include increased safety, lower
costs to students, convenience,
and energy conservation.
There are plenty of important
issues that the senate can focus
on right here at Stanford I feel
that the senate should stay out
of world politics unless a ma
jority of students want the sen
ate to make a stand on a certain
issue. The senate should always
reflect student opinion, not per
sonal views.
Thomas Yeatch
My name is Tom Veatch, and
I'm running for the ASSU Sen
ate Due to a misinformation
problem I missed the Daily sen
ate endorsement interviews. To
make up here are some issues
that I will work on in the senate.
First, the ASSU Senate, com
mittees and house governments
need to be linked to work in
synchrony and thus to better
solve problems. Student
projects and problem-solving
discussions in house meetings
and in the ASSU should not go on
in isolation, but with each oth
er's resources available.
Circulating relevant ideas to
people and organizations that
can help by means of memos
and perhaps newsletters is a
small thing that can help our
system work much more effec
tively.
Second, the student aid cuts
that loom ahead, if opposed by
the student body (let's find out
â€” polls are easy!), should be
lobbied against.
Third, the services of the
ASSl T Course (iuide would be
expanded and improved by in
cluding a list of small, ac
cessible classes (making close
student-faculty interaction
more available to those stuck
with "big, impersonal classes''
â€” after all, this is what Stanford
is all about).
These are some major, yet
workable, improvements that I
feel should be made, and that 1
will work for as a senator There
is much more to say and do. but
this is a beginning. Thank you
for the chance to avoid being
passed over in silence.

total lack of responsibility on its
part.
Like most candidates, I could
have discussed some issues of
great concern to me, such as
bringing back concerts, "better
social life," or more student
faculty interaction in my Daily
"interview." I didn't have time
though, hence the editors ap

parently assumed I lacked'' sen
sitivity" to the important is
sues instead I took it as obvious
that we'd all like to see certain
improvements, and dealt with
the more fundamental question
â€” How can we improve the
process by which we can deal
with these issues? This year's
senate commands no respect
from the students, but students
can't be blamed because there
is no senate/student body in
teraction. Who is the senate rep
resenting?
We. as students, can have our
opinions heard, but only if we
first strengthen the network of
University policymaking, in
cluding the relationships be
tween the students and faculty,
the senate, and the decision
making committees. The senate
should keep in close touch with
student representatives on
these committees, and relay all
developments to students in the
form of senate meetings in
dorm lounges or dining halls.
ASSU sponsored educational fo
rums, to solicit student ideas,
are also necessary. Only if sena
tors concentrate their efforts
toward satisfying the foremost
needs and concerns of students,
will we make any progress
towards more effective student
representation at this school. A
vote for Jim Grundberg would
be a step in the right direction.
Paul Khavari
There is a vital point that
needs to be emphasized among
the factors of this year's cam
paign for the senate and it en
compasses the major concerns
receiving attention. This is the
absolute necessity of per
spective. For candidates so vo
cal about making Tresidder into
a real "student union," about
changing the Draw, about im
proving student-faculty rela
tions and about bringing back
concerts, this perspective is
crucial.
The ASSU functions on many
interfaces with University ad
ministration and it is here
where lack of perspective hurts
us, the students, the most. The
administration functions on
five- to 12-year guidelines while
all too many ASSU projects are
plagued with solely one year's

effort before being abandoned
The students must adjust to this
fact and realize that Tresidder
won't be transformed in three
quarters, that housing will be
radically affected by the new
dorms on the planning boards
and that student-faculty contact
can expand only through pa
tient, concerted and organized
effort among many other
things. Some candidates boast
of their desirable "freshness"
to the process and goals of the
association â€” a freshness that
might easily appear later as
costly ignorance
I am strongly against that
kind of instant success hopeful
ness. Only by being aware of
long-term trends as well as the
capacity for change that a sin
gle year involves will keep the
ASSU on a course most benefi
cial to the students in the long
run and prevent the kind of dis
organized, sporadic and ineffi
cient functioning that destroys
the organization's credibility in
the eyes of its members and hin
ders worthwhile achievement.
Perspective, then, is the fac
tor that will determine whether
the new senate will spend a
whole year discovering limita
tions and learning from their
mistakes only to leave when ap
proaching competency or
whether it will pick up on past
achievements and efficiently
apply their efforts to advance
student interests.
Bambi Markel
I would like to challenge the
Daily for neglecting to endorse
a single woman candidate for
the ASSU Senate. Woman make
up 45 percent of the Stanford
student body and deserve repre
sentation, especially as several
qualified female candidates are
running. I would also like to
point out the differences be
tween the other candidates and
myself, to clarify my particular
qualifications and ideas:
1) I was appointed to the Sub
committee on the Evaluation
and Improvement of Teaching. I
realize that certain depart
ments, especially math, object
to the very existence of the
ASSU Course Guide. As sena
tor, I would work to retain and
improve the Guide. Students

are the best judges of a pro
fessor's ability to teach stu
dents deserve to benefit from
the opinions of other students
2) The ASSU Finance Com
mittee must have a greater role
in auditing the finances of stu
dent organizations Presently,
student groups outline potential
budgets before the Finance
Committee, which then awards
funds, drawn from tuition The
senate does not require student
groups to report back to the Fi
nance Committee concerning
how they have actually spent
the funds With greater accoun
tability to the Finance Commit
tee, financial crises such as that
experienced by Special Events
could be recognized and dealt
with at an early stage Concerts
could be brought back and man
aged efficiently.
3) Through the senate, stu
dents can be influential political
lobbyists when necessary.
Educated by ASSU forums such
as the one on El Salvador, the
student body can then choose
whether or not to act For exam
ple, the Reagan administration
has slashed government-spon
sored student grants and loans.
If the senate discovered,
through polls, student opposi
tion to these cuts, the senate
could protest through a
statement backed by the entire
student bodv.
I have the initiative, creativi
ty, and energy to act on behalf of
YOUR and my ideas. If you
would like to see a more visible
and effective student senate,
please vote for Bambi Markel
on April 15 and 16.
Tracey Minkin
In a short campaign week that
feels like six months, the faces
and words of the senate race
have formed a smiling
homogeneous blur. Concerts,
lighting, linen, El Salvador
these catch-phrases are bounc
ing care-freely from one speech
to the next knock on the door.
Today and tomorrow, 35 or so
names will emerge from this
cloud and ask for your approval
and up to 10 votes. Where, then,
to check?
Consider my approach. I see
the problem areas and am con
cerned about the '81-'B2 Stan
ford issues, but will not act as a
senator until an intelligent and
comprehensive survey is done
this spring, advisably through
Residential Education chan

nels, and specific short-com
mgs. strengths, needs and alter
natives are discerned With this
detailed information, what
looks to be a new senate com
mitted to ASSU can take de
cisive and unified action.
This is the machinery behind
the word "priorities."
Personally, I have put this job
in the absolute forefront of my
outlook for/iext year, and view
the accompanying responsi
bilities very, very seriously.
This job is m\ priority.
So, confronted in the coming
days with the lengthy list of the
senate 35, please remember
that thinking and commitment
will make the difference in a
senator
Out of the issues blur, I will
give you both of those.
Marty Roberts
My name is Marty Roberts
and I am running for the ASSU
Senate My experience includes
being a member of the Califor
nia State Champion Parlia
mentary Procedure Team. With
this background I feel that I
would be well qualified to serve
as Senate Parliamentarian.
Other activities include being a
member of the 1979 National
Champion livestock judging
team, a KZSU sportscaster, a
member of the wrestling team,
and an active participant in
NCAA rodeo.
1 am very enthusiastic about
the senate's increasing ability
to respond to student concerns
and would very much like to be a
part of this process. This year's
senate has worked to improve
the senate's interaction with
students. We must continue this
effort through newsletters,
sherry hours, the creation of a
publicity committee, and more
frequent polling on important
issues.
Minority concerns should not
be just a concern of the groups
involved â€” they affect the en
tire community. The senate
should strive toward achieving
a better life for minorities at
Stanford. This means paying
special attention to minority
groups when deciding on group
funding.
Have you spent an all-nighter
at the CPPC? Many students
have! This problem can be dealt
with by the creation of a senate
task force to look into the CPPC
procedures.

The ASSU provides many stu
dent services such as lecture
notes, typing. T-shirts, etc I
propose that the ASSU create a
Bus Service to make buses
available for dorm trips and oth
er campus group activities The
advantages of the service would
include increased safety, lower
costs to students, convenience,
and energy conservation.
There are plenty of important
issues that the senate can focus
on right here at Stanford I feel
that the senate should stay out
of world politics unless a ma
jority of students want the sen
ate to make a stand on a certain
issue. The senate should always
reflect student opinion, not per
sonal views.
Thomas Yeatch
My name is Tom Veatch, and
I'm running for the ASSU Sen
ate Due to a misinformation
problem I missed the Daily sen
ate endorsement interviews. To
make up here are some issues
that I will work on in the senate.
First, the ASSU Senate, com
mittees and house governments
need to be linked to work in
synchrony and thus to better
solve problems. Student
projects and problem-solving
discussions in house meetings
and in the ASSU should not go on
in isolation, but with each oth
er's resources available.
Circulating relevant ideas to
people and organizations that
can help by means of memos
and perhaps newsletters is a
small thing that can help our
system work much more effec
tively.
Second, the student aid cuts
that loom ahead, if opposed by
the student body (let's find out
â€” polls are easy!), should be
lobbied against.
Third, the services of the
ASSl T Course (iuide would be
expanded and improved by in
cluding a list of small, ac
cessible classes (making close
student-faculty interaction
more available to those stuck
with "big, impersonal classes''
â€” after all, this is what Stanford
is all about).
These are some major, yet
workable, improvements that I
feel should be made, and that 1
will work for as a senator There
is much more to say and do. but
this is a beginning. Thank you
for the chance to avoid being
passed over in silence.
()n Monday and yesterday,
following Friday's final dead
line for declaration of can
didacy. the Daily published its
endorsements of candidates
running for the ASSU Senate.
Here, the Daily is providing
space for rebuttal to those can
didates who were not endorsed.
Cricket Barlow
This campus needs new life!
The posters of me licking an ice
cream cone I hope reflect my
light-hearted personality. How
ever, I do take the issues seri
ously.
My intention is to focus the
ASSU on the students again.
Through concerts, a student
union, and a closer relationship
between faculty and students,
the ASSU can promote cohesive
ness in student activities. Have
you ever noticed that the only
weekend activities are dorm or
fraternity sponsored?
I am presently working on the
Student Alumni Network
(S.T.A.N.) whose major em
phasis is to support class togeth
erness. But Stanford not only
needs class interaction but uni
versity interaction as well. This
can be done by forming a stu
dent union to accomodate the
needs of all students. We need a
central meeting place to serve
as a comfortable alternative for
everyone.
I propose that we renovate
Tresidder so that it can be used
both day and night. The way to
achieve this is through a concen
trated effort of the senate. In
stead of delegating powers to
committees, why not use the
power of the senate effectively,
to follow through on these pro
posals.
The senate has a lot of poten
tial power, and I've seen that
through student initiative,
projects can be accomplished.
The senate can only do as much
as the students are willing to put
into it. I'm enthusiastic and
ready to take on the responsi
bilities of the senate as a body
working for the students.
So vote for Cricket Barlow,
and together we can lick the sys
tem.

Caroline Cheng
As a committee staff assis
tant, COP-intern, and ex-officio
member of the Nominations
Committee for the ASSU, I re
alize the importance of the
Committee System, where stu
dents can directly influence
University policy from the
Pass/No Credit option to the
Western Culture requirement.
Through the Committee Sys
tem, we can make the ASSU
stronger in influencing decision
making which greatly affects
students.
The ASSU lacks a centralized
publicity network. The result is
that people rarely know what
the senate and the ASSU are
doing. Monthly newsletters
about ASSU activities, and put
ting such information in regis
tration packets can improve
communication. Having more
polls, forums and senate meet
ings in dorms are other ways of
finding out student needs and
directing attention to them.
I am concerned about bring
ing student groups not tradi
tionally associated with the
ASSU such as ethnic and wom
en's organizations closer to the
ASSU by allowing them to give
monthly presentations before
the senate.
Although the ASSU repre
sents both graduates and under
grads, graduate issues have not
often been at the forefront of the
senate. Federal budget cuts and
the lack of graduate housing
should also be important issues.
How many of you felt that the
Approaching Stanford gave you
a feel for Stanford before you
came here? Graduate students
don't have that. I want to set up
a Graduate Approaching Stan
ford.
One way to counteract the ris
ing cost of education would be
the creation of a book exchange
or rental system for those who
want it. I propose to continue
the research started by last
year's senate and make buying
books more equitable.
Ultimately, the ASSU is a stu
dent service. Through better
communication and organiza
tion we can make it more re

sponsive to students.
Tom Dill
My name is Tom Dill and I am
a junior majoring in political
science. Due to extenuating cir
cumstances I was unable to at
tend my Daily interview and I
appreciate this opportunity to
express my views. The issues I
see as important to the student
body of Stanford University in
clude the following:
Take an in-depth look at the
possibility of having Special
Events (concerts) on campus.
There is sufficient interest to
warrant a re-attempt at co-pro
ducing a concert at Stanford.
This co-production could be
used as a case study and stu
dents could learn from pro
moters how to properly struc
ture a concert. It would also
enable the ASSU to determine
the feasibility of future concerts
on campus.
Improve relations between
the ASSU and Tresidder. The
ASSU should consider the ad
vantages of incorporating the
Recreation Center and The
Store into student-run organiza
tions. Such a restructuring
would make the facilities more
reflective of student needs and
improve their appropriateness
on campus. Revise the structure
of the Fee Assessment system.
Review ASSU projects. The
Typesetting service has lost
money in the past and the Typ
ing Service may not be in ex
istence next year. These ser
vices must be reviewed and re
organized along more efficient
lines. The senate must narrow
its objectives to achieve its
goals.
Finally, improved com
munication between the ASSU
and the student body is essential
if the senate is to remain an ef
fective organization of student
government. Vote Tom Dill for
ASSU Senate April 15 and 16.
Paul Elliott, Jan Rang
We are running for the senate
because we believe that any stu
dent political organization, no
matter how trivial, can become
a significant voice for change
within the University. The sen
ate need not be an organization
dedicated to the self-aggran
dizement of its few members.
The senate will become impor
tant only when its members be
gin to address fundamental is
sues and not petty student con
cerns. We do not advocate the
use of the senate as a forum for
the airing of national and in
ternational issues, but neither
do we believe that the senate
should consciously seek to avoid
controversy. We believe that
the senate should address, and
through its influence with the
University administration and
campus-wide public opinion,
seek a remedy for several seri
ous campus problems:
1. There is no reason for the
return of the "F" grade apart
from a peculiar desire on the
part of certain faculty to impose
their own sense of "merito
cracy" on the undergraduate
population. It is impossible to
quantify learning either numer
ically or with a letter grade.
2. Fraternities have prac
ticed open and notorious racial
discrimination for decades.
What have the frats done to
remedy their record of past dis
crimination? How many mem
bers of minority communities
feel welcome on the row? We
believe the frats should under
take a sincere affirmative ac
tion program. Otherwise Stan
ford in good conscience cannot
continue to tolerate their pres
ence
3. Do House fellows always
do a good job? Res Ed should re
appoint resident fellows on a
merit basis and not as a per
petual system of cronyism
4 Ethnic theme houses
should be given an equal op
portunity share in the best of
Stanford housing. The place
ment of Casa Zapata in Stern
Hall is an affront to the Stanford
Chicano community.
Raga Klim
Elim is clearly one of this
year's strongest candidates.
Through his extensive ex
perience in leadership roles.
Elim has come to learn the im
portance of motivating people
and working well with others.
He is a very hard worker and he
has a unique ability of trans
ferring his enthusiasm to oth
ers, two qualities that would
make him a good senator. Final
ly, his work in the Om
budsman's office this past year
has given him a good insight into
the concerns and complaints of
the students.
Major concerns include:
Election Reform:
Have several opportunities
for the students to meet and
question the candidates.
Limit areas for posters to one
spot for each dorm and have this
rule strictly enforced.
Eliminate the Daily endorse
ments because it is not right
that a small panel of people
have that much influence in an
election.
Improve student body/senate
communications by having the
senate meetings in dorm
lounges. This will increase stu
dent input and make the senate
more visable.
Elim's only promise is hard
work and I think he deserves
your vote this Wednesday and
Thursday.
Fritz Fischer
My name is Fritz Fischer,
and my campaign for the senate
has one major theme, which can
best be expressed in a question
â€” Do you know what the ASSU
Senate does? If you are like
most students I've talked to,

your honest answer would be no.
This is a ridiculous problem.
The senate is the student's only
representative body, yet the stu
dents have absolutely no idea
what it does We see and learn
about the final results, yet we
have very little direct say in
their initiation.
I am currently a freshman,
and consider myself a "typical"
Stanford student, who is in
terested in the concerns of the
student body. My experience in
the ASSU is none, because I, like
most of you, had no idea what a
senator was or did until just re
cently. Yet I have been actively
involved in student government
in the past (high school, dorm
government) and am very will
ing to put in the time needed for
the job. It is essential that the
senate reflects true student
opinions in its decisions.
If the student body wants the
senate to represent the views of
the student body in world af
fairs, then the senate should. If
not, then the senate should not.
Ideas I have for increasing stu
dent involvement in the senate
include a senate liaison for each
dorm, open senate meetings in
dorms and dinners and social
events sponsored by the senate.
In short, the senate should be
what the students of Stanford
make it, and if elected I intend
to make it that way.
Jim Grundberg
I was disillusioned when I
read the Daily endorsements
the other day, if only because
their strong statements were
solely based on a short five
minute interview. Unless the
Daily is prepared to do a bit
more research than that, it has
no place in judging the abilities
of various candidates. The Dai
ly turned a very casual and un
professional interview into
some very powerful endorse
ments, and this represented a
total lack of responsibility on its
part.
Like most candidates, I could
have discussed some issues of
great concern to me, such as
bringing back concerts, "better
social life," or more student

this is a beginning. Thank you
for the chance to avoid being
passed over in silence.
()n Monday and yesterday,
following Friday's final dead
line for declaration of can
didacy. the Daily published its
endorsements of candidates
running for the ASSU Senate.
Here, the Daily is providing
space for rebuttal to those can
didates who were not endorsed.
Cricket Barlow
This campus needs new life!
The posters of me licking an ice
cream cone I hope reflect my
light-hearted personality. How
ever, I do take the issues seri
ously.
My intention is to focus the
ASSU on the students again.
Through concerts, a student
union, and a closer relationship
between faculty and students,
the ASSU can promote cohesive
ness in student activities. Have
you ever noticed that the only
weekend activities are dorm or
fraternity sponsored?
I am presently working on the
Student Alumni Network
(S.T.A.N.) whose major em
phasis is to support class togeth
erness. But Stanford not only
needs class interaction but uni
versity interaction as well. This
can be done by forming a stu
dent union to accomodate the
needs of all students. We need a
central meeting place to serve
as a comfortable alternative for
everyone.
I propose that we renovate
Tresidder so that it can be used
both day and night. The way to
achieve this is through a concen
trated effort of the senate. In
stead of delegating powers to
committees, why not use the
power of the senate effectively,
to follow through on these pro
posals.
The senate has a lot of poten
tial power, and I've seen that
through student initiative,
projects can be accomplished.
The senate can only do as much
as the students are willing to put
into it. I'm enthusiastic and
ready to take on the responsi
bilities of the senate as a body
working for the students.
So vote for Cricket Barlow,
and together we can lick the sys
tem.

Caroline Cheng
As a committee staff assis
tant, COP-intern, and ex-officio
member of the Nominations
Committee for the ASSU, I re
alize the importance of the
Committee System, where stu
dents can directly influence
University policy from the
Pass/No Credit option to the
Western Culture requirement.
Through the Committee Sys
tem, we can make the ASSU
stronger in influencing decision
making which greatly affects
students.
The ASSU lacks a centralized
publicity network. The result is
that people rarely know what
the senate and the ASSU are
doing. Monthly newsletters
about ASSU activities, and put
ting such information in regis
tration packets can improve
communication. Having more
polls, forums and senate meet
ings in dorms are other ways of
finding out student needs and
directing attention to them.
I am concerned about bring
ing student groups not tradi
tionally associated with the
ASSU such as ethnic and wom
en's organizations closer to the
ASSU by allowing them to give
monthly presentations before
the senate.
Although the ASSU repre
sents both graduates and under
grads, graduate issues have not
often been at the forefront of the
senate. Federal budget cuts and
the lack of graduate housing
should also be important issues.
How many of you felt that the
Approaching Stanford gave you
a feel for Stanford before you
came here? Graduate students
don't have that. I want to set up
a Graduate Approaching Stan
ford.
One way to counteract the ris
ing cost of education would be
the creation of a book exchange
or rental system for those who
want it. I propose to continue
the research started by last
year's senate and make buying
books more equitable.
Ultimately, the ASSU is a stu
dent service. Through better
communication and organiza
tion we can make it more re

sponsive to students.
Tom Dill
My name is Tom Dill and I am
a junior majoring in political
science. Due to extenuating cir
cumstances I was unable to at
tend my Daily interview and I
appreciate this opportunity to
express my views. The issues I
see as important to the student
body of Stanford University in
clude the following:
Take an in-depth look at the
possibility of having Special
Events (concerts) on campus.
There is sufficient interest to
warrant a re-attempt at co-pro
ducing a concert at Stanford.
This co-production could be
used as a case study and stu
dents could learn from pro
moters how to properly struc
ture a concert. It would also
enable the ASSU to determine
the feasibility of future concerts
on campus.
Improve relations between
the ASSU and Tresidder. The
ASSU should consider the ad
vantages of incorporating the
Recreation Center and The
Store into student-run organiza
tions. Such a restructuring
would make the facilities more
reflective of student needs and
improve their appropriateness
on campus. Revise the structure
of the Fee Assessment system.
Review ASSU projects. The
Typesetting service has lost
money in the past and the Typ
ing Service may not be in ex
istence next year. These ser
vices must be reviewed and re
organized along more efficient
lines. The senate must narrow
its objectives to achieve its
goals.
Finally, improved com
munication between the ASSU
and the student body is essential
if the senate is to remain an ef
fective organization of student
government. Vote Tom Dill for
ASSU Senate April 15 and 16.
Paul Elliott, Jan Rang
We are running for the senate
because we believe that any stu
dent political organization, no
matter how trivial, can become
a significant voice for change
within the University. The sen
ate need not be an organization
dedicated to the self-aggran
dizement of its few members.
The senate will become impor
tant only when its members be
gin to address fundamental is
sues and not petty student con
cerns. We do not advocate the
use of the senate as a forum for
the airing of national and in
ternational issues, but neither
do we believe that the senate
should consciously seek to avoid
controversy. We believe that
the senate should address, and
through its influence with the
University administration and
campus-wide public opinion,
seek a remedy for several seri
ous campus problems:
1. There is no reason for the
return of the "F" grade apart
from a peculiar desire on the
part of certain faculty to impose
their own sense of "merito
cracy" on the undergraduate
population. It is impossible to
quantify learning either numer
ically or with a letter grade.
2. Fraternities have prac
ticed open and notorious racial
discrimination for decades.
What have the frats done to
remedy their record of past dis
crimination? How many mem
bers of minority communities
feel welcome on the row? We
believe the frats should under
take a sincere affirmative ac
tion program. Otherwise Stan
ford in good conscience cannot
continue to tolerate their pres
ence
3. Do House fellows always
do a good job? Res Ed should re
appoint resident fellows on a
merit basis and not as a per
petual system of cronyism
4 Ethnic theme houses
should be given an equal op
portunity share in the best of
Stanford housing. The place
ment of Casa Zapata in Stern
Hall is an affront to the Stanford
Chicano community.
Raga Klim
Elim is clearly one of this
year's strongest candidates.
Through his extensive ex
perience in leadership roles.
Elim has come to learn the im
portance of motivating people
and working well with others.
He is a very hard worker and he
has a unique ability of trans
ferring his enthusiasm to oth
ers, two qualities that would
make him a good senator. Final
ly, his work in the Om
budsman's office this past year
has given him a good insight into
the concerns and complaints of
the students.
Major concerns include:
Election Reform:
Have several opportunities
for the students to meet and
question the candidates.
Limit areas for posters to one
spot for each dorm and have this
rule strictly enforced.
Eliminate the Daily endorse
ments because it is not right
that a small panel of people
have that much influence in an
election.
Improve student body/senate
communications by having the
senate meetings in dorm
lounges. This will increase stu
dent input and make the senate
more visable.
Elim's only promise is hard
work and I think he deserves
your vote this Wednesday and
Thursday.
Fritz Fischer
My name is Fritz Fischer,
and my campaign for the senate
has one major theme, which can
best be expressed in a question
â€” Do you know what the ASSU
Senate does? If you are like
most students I've talked to,

your honest answer would be no.
This is a ridiculous problem.
The senate is the student's only
representative body, yet the stu
dents have absolutely no idea
what it does We see and learn
about the final results, yet we
have very little direct say in
their initiation.
I am currently a freshman,
and consider myself a "typical"
Stanford student, who is in
terested in the concerns of the
student body. My experience in
the ASSU is none, because I, like
most of you, had no idea what a
senator was or did until just re
cently. Yet I have been actively
involved in student government
in the past (high school, dorm
government) and am very will
ing to put in the time needed for
the job. It is essential that the
senate reflects true student
opinions in its decisions.
If the student body wants the
senate to represent the views of
the student body in world af
fairs, then the senate should. If
not, then the senate should not.
Ideas I have for increasing stu
dent involvement in the senate
include a senate liaison for each
dorm, open senate meetings in
dorms and dinners and social
events sponsored by the senate.
In short, the senate should be
what the students of Stanford
make it, and if elected I intend
to make it that way.
Jim Grundberg
I was disillusioned when I
read the Daily endorsements
the other day, if only because
their strong statements were
solely based on a short five
minute interview. Unless the
Daily is prepared to do a bit
more research than that, it has
no place in judging the abilities
of various candidates. The Dai
ly turned a very casual and un
professional interview into
some very powerful endorse
ments, and this represented a
total lack of responsibility on its
part.
Like most candidates, I could
have discussed some issues of
great concern to me, such as
bringing back concerts, "better
social life," or more student
faculty interaction in my Daily
"interview." I didn't have time
though, hence the editors ap

parently assumed I lacked'' sen
sitivity" to the important is
sues instead I took it as obvious
that we'd all like to see certain
improvements, and dealt with
the more fundamental question
â€” How can we improve the
process by which we can deal
with these issues? This year's
senate commands no respect
from the students, but students
can't be blamed because there
is no senate/student body in
teraction. Who is the senate rep
resenting?
We. as students, can have our
opinions heard, but only if we
first strengthen the network of
University policymaking, in
cluding the relationships be
tween the students and faculty,
the senate, and the decision
making committees. The senate
should keep in close touch with
student representatives on
these committees, and relay all
developments to students in the
form of senate meetings in
dorm lounges or dining halls.
ASSU sponsored educational fo
rums, to solicit student ideas,
are also necessary. Only if sena
tors concentrate their efforts
toward satisfying the foremost
needs and concerns of students,
will we make any progress
towards more effective student
representation at this school. A
vote for Jim Grundberg would
be a step in the right direction.
Paul Khavari
There is a vital point that
needs to be emphasized among
the factors of this year's cam
paign for the senate and it en
compasses the major concerns
receiving attention. This is the
absolute necessity of per
spective. For candidates so vo
cal about making Tresidder into
a real "student union," about
changing the Draw, about im
proving student-faculty rela
tions and about bringing back
concerts, this perspective is
crucial.
The ASSU functions on many
interfaces with University ad
ministration and it is here
where lack of perspective hurts
us, the students, the most. The
administration functions on
five- to 12-year guidelines while
all too many ASSU projects are
plagued with solely one year's

effort before being abandoned
The students must adjust to this
fact and realize that Tresidder
won't be transformed in three
quarters, that housing will be
radically affected by the new
dorms on the planning boards
and that student-faculty contact
can expand only through pa
tient, concerted and organized
effort among many other
things. Some candidates boast
of their desirable "freshness"
to the process and goals of the
association â€” a freshness that
might easily appear later as
costly ignorance
I am strongly against that
kind of instant success hopeful
ness. Only by being aware of
long-term trends as well as the
capacity for change that a sin
gle year involves will keep the
ASSU on a course most benefi
cial to the students in the long
run and prevent the kind of dis
organized, sporadic and ineffi
cient functioning that destroys
the organization's credibility in
the eyes of its members and hin
ders worthwhile achievement.
Perspective, then, is the fac
tor that will determine whether
the new senate will spend a
whole year discovering limita
tions and learning from their
mistakes only to leave when ap
proaching competency or
whether it will pick up on past
achievements and efficiently
apply their efforts to advance
student interests.
Bambi Markel
I would like to challenge the
Daily for neglecting to endorse
a single woman candidate for
the ASSU Senate. Woman make
up 45 percent of the Stanford
student body and deserve repre
sentation, especially as several
qualified female candidates are
running. I would also like to
point out the differences be
tween the other candidates and
myself, to clarify my particular
qualifications and ideas:
1) I was appointed to the Sub
committee on the Evaluation
and Improvement of Teaching. I
realize that certain depart
ments, especially math, object
to the very existence of the
ASSU Course Guide. As sena
tor, I would work to retain and
improve the Guide. Students

are the best judges of a pro
fessor's ability to teach stu
dents deserve to benefit from
the opinions of other students
2) The ASSU Finance Com
mittee must have a greater role
in auditing the finances of stu
dent organizations Presently,
student groups outline potential
budgets before the Finance
Committee, which then awards
funds, drawn from tuition The
senate does not require student
groups to report back to the Fi
nance Committee concerning
how they have actually spent
the funds With greater accoun
tability to the Finance Commit
tee, financial crises such as that
experienced by Special Events
could be recognized and dealt
with at an early stage Concerts
could be brought back and man
aged efficiently.
3) Through the senate, stu
dents can be influential political
lobbyists when necessary.
Educated by ASSU forums such
as the one on El Salvador, the
student body can then choose
whether or not to act For exam
ple, the Reagan administration
has slashed government-spon
sored student grants and loans.
If the senate discovered,
through polls, student opposi
tion to these cuts, the senate
could protest through a
statement backed by the entire
student bodv.
I have the initiative, creativi
ty, and energy to act on behalf of
YOUR and my ideas. If you
would like to see a more visible
and effective student senate,
please vote for Bambi Markel
on April 15 and 16.
Tracey Minkin
In a short campaign week that
feels like six months, the faces
and words of the senate race
have formed a smiling
homogeneous blur. Concerts,
lighting, linen, El Salvador
these catch-phrases are bounc
ing care-freely from one speech
to the next knock on the door.
Today and tomorrow, 35 or so
names will emerge from this
cloud and ask for your approval
and up to 10 votes. Where, then,
to check?
Consider my approach. I see
the problem areas and am con
cerned about the '81-'B2 Stan
ford issues, but will not act as a
senator until an intelligent and
comprehensive survey is done
this spring, advisably through
Residential Education chan

nels, and specific short-com
mgs. strengths, needs and alter
natives are discerned With this
detailed information, what
looks to be a new senate com
mitted to ASSU can take de
cisive and unified action.
This is the machinery behind
the word "priorities."
Personally, I have put this job
in the absolute forefront of my
outlook for/iext year, and view
the accompanying responsi
bilities very, very seriously.
This job is m\ priority.
So, confronted in the coming
days with the lengthy list of the
senate 35, please remember
that thinking and commitment
will make the difference in a
senator
Out of the issues blur, I will
give you both of those.
Marty Roberts
My name is Marty Roberts
and I am running for the ASSU
Senate My experience includes
being a member of the Califor
nia State Champion Parlia
mentary Procedure Team. With
this background I feel that I
would be well qualified to serve
as Senate Parliamentarian.
Other activities include being a
member of the 1979 National
Champion livestock judging
team, a KZSU sportscaster, a
member of the wrestling team,
and an active participant in
NCAA rodeo.
1 am very enthusiastic about
the senate's increasing ability
to respond to student concerns
and would very much like to be a
part of this process. This year's
senate has worked to improve
the senate's interaction with
students. We must continue this
effort through newsletters,
sherry hours, the creation of a
publicity committee, and more
frequent polling on important
issues.
Minority concerns should not
be just a concern of the groups
involved â€” they affect the en
tire community. The senate
should strive toward achieving
a better life for minorities at
Stanford. This means paying
special attention to minority
groups when deciding on group
funding.
Have you spent an all-nighter
at the CPPC? Many students
have! This problem can be dealt
with by the creation of a senate
task force to look into the CPPC
procedures.

The ASSU provides many stu
dent services such as lecture
notes, typing. T-shirts, etc I
propose that the ASSU create a
Bus Service to make buses
available for dorm trips and oth
er campus group activities The
advantages of the service would
include increased safety, lower
costs to students, convenience,
and energy conservation.
There are plenty of important
issues that the senate can focus
on right here at Stanford I feel
that the senate should stay out
of world politics unless a ma
jority of students want the sen
ate to make a stand on a certain
issue. The senate should always
reflect student opinion, not per
sonal views.
Thomas Yeatch
My name is Tom Veatch, and
I'm running for the ASSU Sen
ate Due to a misinformation
problem I missed the Daily sen
ate endorsement interviews. To
make up here are some issues
that I will work on in the senate.
First, the ASSU Senate, com
mittees and house governments
need to be linked to work in
synchrony and thus to better
solve problems. Student
projects and problem-solving
discussions in house meetings
and in the ASSU should not go on
in isolation, but with each oth
er's resources available.
Circulating relevant ideas to
people and organizations that
can help by means of memos
and perhaps newsletters is a
small thing that can help our
system work much more effec
tively.
Second, the student aid cuts
that loom ahead, if opposed by
the student body (let's find out
â€” polls are easy!), should be
lobbied against.
Third, the services of the
ASSl T Course (iuide would be
expanded and improved by in
cluding a list of small, ac
cessible classes (making close
student-faculty interaction
more available to those stuck
with "big, impersonal classes''
â€” after all, this is what Stanford
is all about).
These are some major, yet
workable, improvements that I
feel should be made, and that 1
will work for as a senator There
is much more to say and do. but
this is a beginning. Thank you
for the chance to avoid being
passed over in silence.

ly turned a very casual and un
professional interview into
some very powerful endorse
ments, and this represented a
total lack of responsibility on its
part.
Like most candidates, I could
have discussed some issues of
great concern to me, such as
bringing back concerts, "better
social life," or more student
faculty interaction in my Daily
"interview." I didn't have time
though, hence the editors ap

parently assumed I lacked'' sen
sitivity" to the important is
sues instead I took it as obvious
that we'd all like to see certain
improvements, and dealt with
the more fundamental question
â€” How can we improve the
process by which we can deal
with these issues? This year's
senate commands no respect
from the students, but students
can't be blamed because there
is no senate/student body in
teraction. Who is the senate rep
resenting?
We. as students, can have our
opinions heard, but only if we
first strengthen the network of
University policymaking, in
cluding the relationships be
tween the students and faculty,
the senate, and the decision
making committees. The senate
should keep in close touch with
student representatives on
these committees, and relay all
developments to students in the
form of senate meetings in
dorm lounges or dining halls.
ASSU sponsored educational fo
rums, to solicit student ideas,
are also necessary. Only if sena
tors concentrate their efforts
toward satisfying the foremost
needs and concerns of students,
will we make any progress
towards more effective student
representation at this school. A
vote for Jim Grundberg would
be a step in the right direction.
Paul Khavari
There is a vital point that
needs to be emphasized among
the factors of this year's cam
paign for the senate and it en
compasses the major concerns
receiving attention. This is the
absolute necessity of per
spective. For candidates so vo
cal about making Tresidder into
a real "student union," about
changing the Draw, about im
proving student-faculty rela
tions and about bringing back
concerts, this perspective is
crucial.
The ASSU functions on many
interfaces with University ad
ministration and it is here
where lack of perspective hurts
us, the students, the most. The
administration functions on
five- to 12-year guidelines while
all too many ASSU projects are
plagued with solely one year's

effort before being abandoned
The students must adjust to this
fact and realize that Tresidder
won't be transformed in three
quarters, that housing will be
radically affected by the new
dorms on the planning boards
and that student-faculty contact
can expand only through pa
tient, concerted and organized
effort among many other
things. Some candidates boast
of their desirable "freshness"
to the process and goals of the
association â€” a freshness that
might easily appear later as
costly ignorance
I am strongly against that
kind of instant success hopeful
ness. Only by being aware of
long-term trends as well as the
capacity for change that a sin
gle year involves will keep the
ASSU on a course most benefi
cial to the students in the long
run and prevent the kind of dis
organized, sporadic and ineffi
cient functioning that destroys
the organization's credibility in
the eyes of its members and hin
ders worthwhile achievement.
Perspective, then, is the fac
tor that will determine whether
the new senate will spend a
whole year discovering limita
tions and learning from their
mistakes only to leave when ap
proaching competency or
whether it will pick up on past
achievements and efficiently
apply their efforts to advance
student interests.
Bambi Markel
I would like to challenge the
Daily for neglecting to endorse
a single woman candidate for
the ASSU Senate. Woman make
up 45 percent of the Stanford
student body and deserve repre
sentation, especially as several
qualified female candidates are
running. I would also like to
point out the differences be
tween the other candidates and
myself, to clarify my particular
qualifications and ideas:
1) I was appointed to the Sub
committee on the Evaluation
and Improvement of Teaching. I
realize that certain depart
ments, especially math, object
to the very existence of the
ASSU Course Guide. As sena
tor, I would work to retain and
improve the Guide. Students

are the best judges of a pro
fessor's ability to teach stu
dents deserve to benefit from
the opinions of other students
2) The ASSU Finance Com
mittee must have a greater role
in auditing the finances of stu
dent organizations Presently,
student groups outline potential
budgets before the Finance
Committee, which then awards
funds, drawn from tuition The
senate does not require student
groups to report back to the Fi
nance Committee concerning
how they have actually spent
the funds With greater accoun
tability to the Finance Commit
tee, financial crises such as that
experienced by Special Events
could be recognized and dealt
with at an early stage Concerts
could be brought back and man
aged efficiently.
3) Through the senate, stu
dents can be influential political
lobbyists when necessary.
Educated by ASSU forums such
as the one on El Salvador, the
student body can then choose
whether or not to act For exam
ple, the Reagan administration
has slashed government-spon
sored student grants and loans.
If the senate discovered,
through polls, student opposi
tion to these cuts, the senate
could protest through a
statement backed by the entire
student bodv.
I have the initiative, creativi
ty, and energy to act on behalf of
YOUR and my ideas. If you
would like to see a more visible
and effective student senate,
please vote for Bambi Markel
on April 15 and 16.
Tracey Minkin
In a short campaign week that
feels like six months, the faces
and words of the senate race
have formed a smiling
homogeneous blur. Concerts,
lighting, linen, El Salvador
these catch-phrases are bounc
ing care-freely from one speech
to the next knock on the door.
Today and tomorrow, 35 or so
names will emerge from this
cloud and ask for your approval
and up to 10 votes. Where, then,
to check?
Consider my approach. I see
the problem areas and am con
cerned about the '81-'B2 Stan
ford issues, but will not act as a
senator until an intelligent and
comprehensive survey is done
this spring, advisably through
Residential Education chan

nels, and specific short-com
mgs. strengths, needs and alter
natives are discerned With this
detailed information, what
looks to be a new senate com
mitted to ASSU can take de
cisive and unified action.
This is the machinery behind
the word "priorities."
Personally, I have put this job
in the absolute forefront of my
outlook for/iext year, and view
the accompanying responsi
bilities very, very seriously.
This job is m\ priority.
So, confronted in the coming
days with the lengthy list of the
senate 35, please remember
that thinking and commitment
will make the difference in a
senator
Out of the issues blur, I will
give you both of those.
Marty Roberts
My name is Marty Roberts
and I am running for the ASSU
Senate My experience includes
being a member of the Califor
nia State Champion Parlia
mentary Procedure Team. With
this background I feel that I
would be well qualified to serve
as Senate Parliamentarian.
Other activities include being a
member of the 1979 National
Champion livestock judging
team, a KZSU sportscaster, a
member of the wrestling team,
and an active participant in
NCAA rodeo.
1 am very enthusiastic about
the senate's increasing ability
to respond to student concerns
and would very much like to be a
part of this process. This year's
senate has worked to improve
the senate's interaction with
students. We must continue this
effort through newsletters,
sherry hours, the creation of a
publicity committee, and more
frequent polling on important
issues.
Minority concerns should not
be just a concern of the groups
involved â€” they affect the en
tire community. The senate
should strive toward achieving
a better life for minorities at
Stanford. This means paying
special attention to minority
groups when deciding on group
funding.
Have you spent an all-nighter
at the CPPC? Many students
have! This problem can be dealt
with by the creation of a senate
task force to look into the CPPC
procedures.

The ASSU provides many stu
dent services such as lecture
notes, typing. T-shirts, etc I
propose that the ASSU create a
Bus Service to make buses
available for dorm trips and oth
er campus group activities The
advantages of the service would
include increased safety, lower
costs to students, convenience,
and energy conservation.
There are plenty of important
issues that the senate can focus
on right here at Stanford I feel
that the senate should stay out
of world politics unless a ma
jority of students want the sen
ate to make a stand on a certain
issue. The senate should always
reflect student opinion, not per
sonal views.
Thomas Yeatch
My name is Tom Veatch, and
I'm running for the ASSU Sen
ate Due to a misinformation
problem I missed the Daily sen
ate endorsement interviews. To
make up here are some issues
that I will work on in the senate.
First, the ASSU Senate, com
mittees and house governments
need to be linked to work in
synchrony and thus to better
solve problems. Student
projects and problem-solving
discussions in house meetings
and in the ASSU should not go on
in isolation, but with each oth
er's resources available.
Circulating relevant ideas to
people and organizations that
can help by means of memos
and perhaps newsletters is a
small thing that can help our
system work much more effec
tively.
Second, the student aid cuts
that loom ahead, if opposed by
the student body (let's find out
â€” polls are easy!), should be
lobbied against.
Third, the services of the
ASSl T Course (iuide would be
expanded and improved by in
cluding a list of small, ac
cessible classes (making close
student-faculty interaction
more available to those stuck
with "big, impersonal classes''
â€” after all, this is what Stanford
is all about).
These are some major, yet
workable, improvements that I
feel should be made, and that 1
will work for as a senator There
is much more to say and do. but
this is a beginning. Thank you
for the chance to avoid being
passed over in silence.
()n Monday and yesterday,
following Friday's final dead
line for declaration of can
didacy. the Daily published its
endorsements of candidates
running for the ASSU Senate.
Here, the Daily is providing
space for rebuttal to those can
didates who were not endorsed.
Cricket Barlow
This campus needs new life!
The posters of me licking an ice
cream cone I hope reflect my
light-hearted personality. How
ever, I do take the issues seri
ously.
My intention is to focus the
ASSU on the students again.
Through concerts, a student
union, and a closer relationship
between faculty and students,
the ASSU can promote cohesive
ness in student activities. Have
you ever noticed that the only
weekend activities are dorm or
fraternity sponsored?
I am presently working on the
Student Alumni Network
(S.T.A.N.) whose major em
phasis is to support class togeth
erness. But Stanford not only
needs class interaction but uni
versity interaction as well. This
can be done by forming a stu
dent union to accomodate the
needs of all students. We need a
central meeting place to serve
as a comfortable alternative for
everyone.
I propose that we renovate
Tresidder so that it can be used
both day and night. The way to
achieve this is through a concen
trated effort of the senate. In
stead of delegating powers to
committees, why not use the
power of the senate effectively,
to follow through on these pro
posals.
The senate has a lot of poten
tial power, and I've seen that
through student initiative,
projects can be accomplished.
The senate can only do as much
as the students are willing to put
into it. I'm enthusiastic and
ready to take on the responsi
bilities of the senate as a body
working for the students.
So vote for Cricket Barlow,
and together we can lick the sys
tem.

Caroline Cheng
As a committee staff assis
tant, COP-intern, and ex-officio
member of the Nominations
Committee for the ASSU, I re
alize the importance of the
Committee System, where stu
dents can directly influence
University policy from the
Pass/No Credit option to the
Western Culture requirement.
Through the Committee Sys
tem, we can make the ASSU
stronger in influencing decision
making which greatly affects
students.
The ASSU lacks a centralized
publicity network. The result is
that people rarely know what
the senate and the ASSU are
doing. Monthly newsletters
about ASSU activities, and put
ting such information in regis
tration packets can improve
communication. Having more
polls, forums and senate meet
ings in dorms are other ways of
finding out student needs and
directing attention to them.
I am concerned about bring
ing student groups not tradi
tionally associated with the
ASSU such as ethnic and wom
en's organizations closer to the
ASSU by allowing them to give
monthly presentations before
the senate.
Although the ASSU repre
sents both graduates and under
grads, graduate issues have not
often been at the forefront of the
senate. Federal budget cuts and
the lack of graduate housing
should also be important issues.
How many of you felt that the
Approaching Stanford gave you
a feel for Stanford before you
came here? Graduate students
don't have that. I want to set up
a Graduate Approaching Stan
ford.
One way to counteract the ris
ing cost of education would be
the creation of a book exchange
or rental system for those who
want it. I propose to continue
the research started by last
year's senate and make buying
books more equitable.
Ultimately, the ASSU is a stu
dent service. Through better
communication and organiza
tion we can make it more re

sponsive to students.
Tom Dill
My name is Tom Dill and I am
a junior majoring in political
science. Due to extenuating cir
cumstances I was unable to at
tend my Daily interview and I
appreciate this opportunity to
express my views. The issues I
see as important to the student
body of Stanford University in
clude the following:
Take an in-depth look at the
possibility of having Special
Events (concerts) on campus.
There is sufficient interest to
warrant a re-attempt at co-pro
ducing a concert at Stanford.
This co-production could be
used as a case study and stu
dents could learn from pro
moters how to properly struc
ture a concert. It would also
enable the ASSU to determine
the feasibility of future concerts
on campus.
Improve relations between
the ASSU and Tresidder. The
ASSU should consider the ad
vantages of incorporating the
Recreation Center and The
Store into student-run organiza
tions. Such a restructuring
would make the facilities more
reflective of student needs and
improve their appropriateness
on campus. Revise the structure
of the Fee Assessment system.
Review ASSU projects. The
Typesetting service has lost
money in the past and the Typ
ing Service may not be in ex
istence next year. These ser
vices must be reviewed and re
organized along more efficient
lines. The senate must narrow
its objectives to achieve its
goals.
Finally, improved com
munication between the ASSU
and the student body is essential
if the senate is to remain an ef
fective organization of student
government. Vote Tom Dill for
ASSU Senate April 15 and 16.
Paul Elliott, Jan Rang
We are running for the senate
because we believe that any stu
dent political organization, no
matter how trivial, can become
a significant voice for change
within the University. The sen
ate need not be an organization
dedicated to the self-aggran
dizement of its few members.
The senate will become impor
tant only when its members be
gin to address fundamental is
sues and not petty student con
cerns. We do not advocate the
use of the senate as a forum for
the airing of national and in
ternational issues, but neither
do we believe that the senate
should consciously seek to avoid
controversy. We believe that
the senate should address, and
through its influence with the
University administration and
campus-wide public opinion,
seek a remedy for several seri
ous campus problems:
1. There is no reason for the
return of the "F" grade apart
from a peculiar desire on the
part of certain faculty to impose
their own sense of "merito
cracy" on the undergraduate
population. It is impossible to
quantify learning either numer
ically or with a letter grade.
2. Fraternities have prac
ticed open and notorious racial
discrimination for decades.
What have the frats done to
remedy their record of past dis
crimination? How many mem
bers of minority communities
feel welcome on the row? We
believe the frats should under
take a sincere affirmative ac
tion program. Otherwise Stan
ford in good conscience cannot
continue to tolerate their pres
ence
3. Do House fellows always
do a good job? Res Ed should re
appoint resident fellows on a
merit basis and not as a per
petual system of cronyism
4 Ethnic theme houses
should be given an equal op
portunity share in the best of
Stanford housing. The place
ment of Casa Zapata in Stern
Hall is an affront to the Stanford
Chicano community.
Raga Klim
Elim is clearly one of this
year's strongest candidates.
Through his extensive ex
perience in leadership roles.
Elim has come to learn the im
portance of motivating people
and working well with others.
He is a very hard worker and he
has a unique ability of trans
ferring his enthusiasm to oth
ers, two qualities that would
make him a good senator. Final
ly, his work in the Om
budsman's office this past year
has given him a good insight into
the concerns and complaints of
the students.
Major concerns include:
Election Reform:
Have several opportunities
for the students to meet and
question the candidates.
Limit areas for posters to one
spot for each dorm and have this
rule strictly enforced.
Eliminate the Daily endorse
ments because it is not right
that a small panel of people
have that much influence in an
election.
Improve student body/senate
communications by having the
senate meetings in dorm
lounges. This will increase stu
dent input and make the senate
more visable.
Elim's only promise is hard
work and I think he deserves
your vote this Wednesday and
Thursday.
Fritz Fischer
My name is Fritz Fischer,
and my campaign for the senate
has one major theme, which can
best be expressed in a question
â€” Do you know what the ASSU
Senate does? If you are like
most students I've talked to,

your honest answer would be no.
This is a ridiculous problem.
The senate is the student's only
representative body, yet the stu
dents have absolutely no idea
what it does We see and learn
about the final results, yet we
have very little direct say in
their initiation.
I am currently a freshman,
and consider myself a "typical"
Stanford student, who is in
terested in the concerns of the
student body. My experience in
the ASSU is none, because I, like
most of you, had no idea what a
senator was or did until just re
cently. Yet I have been actively
involved in student government
in the past (high school, dorm
government) and am very will
ing to put in the time needed for
the job. It is essential that the
senate reflects true student
opinions in its decisions.
If the student body wants the
senate to represent the views of
the student body in world af
fairs, then the senate should. If
not, then the senate should not.
Ideas I have for increasing stu
dent involvement in the senate
include a senate liaison for each
dorm, open senate meetings in
dorms and dinners and social
events sponsored by the senate.
In short, the senate should be
what the students of Stanford
make it, and if elected I intend
to make it that way.
Jim Grundberg
I was disillusioned when I
read the Daily endorsements
the other day, if only because
their strong statements were
solely based on a short five
minute interview. Unless the
Daily is prepared to do a bit
more research than that, it has
no place in judging the abilities
of various candidates. The Dai
ly turned a very casual and un
professional interview into
some very powerful endorse
ments, and this represented a
total lack of responsibility on its

feel should be made, and that 1
will work for as a senator There
is much more to say and do. but
this is a beginning. Thank you
for the chance to avoid being
passed over in silence.
()n Monday and yesterday,
following Friday's final dead
line for declaration of can
didacy. the Daily published its
endorsements of candidates
running for the ASSU Senate.
Here, the Daily is providing
space for rebuttal to those can
didates who were not endorsed.
Cricket Barlow
This campus needs new life!
The posters of me licking an ice
cream cone I hope reflect my
light-hearted personality. How
ever, I do take the issues seri
ously.
My intention is to focus the
ASSU on the students again.
Through concerts, a student
union, and a closer relationship
between faculty and students,
the ASSU can promote cohesive
ness in student activities. Have
you ever noticed that the only
weekend activities are dorm or
fraternity sponsored?
I am presently working on the
Student Alumni Network
(S.T.A.N.) whose major em
phasis is to support class togeth
erness. But Stanford not only
needs class interaction but uni
versity interaction as well. This
can be done by forming a stu
dent union to accomodate the
needs of all students. We need a
central meeting place to serve
as a comfortable alternative for
everyone.
I propose that we renovate
Tresidder so that it can be used
both day and night. The way to
achieve this is through a concen
trated effort of the senate. In
stead of delegating powers to
committees, why not use the
power of the senate effectively,
to follow through on these pro
posals.
The senate has a lot of poten
tial power, and I've seen that
through student initiative,
projects can be accomplished.
The senate can only do as much
as the students are willing to put
into it. I'm enthusiastic and
ready to take on the responsi
bilities of the senate as a body
working for the students.
So vote for Cricket Barlow,
and together we can lick the sys
tem.

Caroline Cheng
As a committee staff assis
tant, COP-intern, and ex-officio
member of the Nominations
Committee for the ASSU, I re
alize the importance of the
Committee System, where stu
dents can directly influence
University policy from the
Pass/No Credit option to the
Western Culture requirement.
Through the Committee Sys
tem, we can make the ASSU
stronger in influencing decision
making which greatly affects
students.
The ASSU lacks a centralized
publicity network. The result is
that people rarely know what
the senate and the ASSU are
doing. Monthly newsletters
about ASSU activities, and put
ting such information in regis
tration packets can improve
communication. Having more
polls, forums and senate meet
ings in dorms are other ways of
finding out student needs and
directing attention to them.
I am concerned about bring
ing student groups not tradi
tionally associated with the
ASSU such as ethnic and wom
en's organizations closer to the
ASSU by allowing them to give
monthly presentations before
the senate.
Although the ASSU repre
sents both graduates and under
grads, graduate issues have not
often been at the forefront of the
senate. Federal budget cuts and
the lack of graduate housing
should also be important issues.
How many of you felt that the
Approaching Stanford gave you
a feel for Stanford before you
came here? Graduate students
don't have that. I want to set up
a Graduate Approaching Stan
ford.
One way to counteract the ris
ing cost of education would be
the creation of a book exchange
or rental system for those who
want it. I propose to continue
the research started by last
year's senate and make buying
books more equitable.
Ultimately, the ASSU is a stu
dent service. Through better
communication and organiza
tion we can make it more re

sponsive to students.
Tom Dill
My name is Tom Dill and I am
a junior majoring in political
science. Due to extenuating cir
cumstances I was unable to at
tend my Daily interview and I
appreciate this opportunity to
express my views. The issues I
see as important to the student
body of Stanford University in
clude the following:
Take an in-depth look at the
possibility of having Special
Events (concerts) on campus.
There is sufficient interest to
warrant a re-attempt at co-pro
ducing a concert at Stanford.
This co-production could be
used as a case study and stu
dents could learn from pro
moters how to properly struc
ture a concert. It would also
enable the ASSU to determine
the feasibility of future concerts
on campus.
Improve relations between
the ASSU and Tresidder. The
ASSU should consider the ad
vantages of incorporating the
Recreation Center and The
Store into student-run organiza
tions. Such a restructuring
would make the facilities more
reflective of student needs and
improve their appropriateness
on campus. Revise the structure
of the Fee Assessment system.
Review ASSU projects. The
Typesetting service has lost
money in the past and the Typ
ing Service may not be in ex
istence next year. These ser
vices must be reviewed and re
organized along more efficient
lines. The senate must narrow
its objectives to achieve its
goals.
Finally, improved com
munication between the ASSU
and the student body is essential
if the senate is to remain an ef
fective organization of student
government. Vote Tom Dill for
ASSU Senate April 15 and 16.
Paul Elliott, Jan Rang
We are running for the senate
because we believe that any stu
dent political organization, no
matter how trivial, can become
a significant voice for change
within the University. The sen
ate need not be an organization
dedicated to the self-aggran
dizement of its few members.
The senate will become impor
tant only when its members be
gin to address fundamental is
sues and not petty student con
cerns. We do not advocate the
use of the senate as a forum for
the airing of national and in
ternational issues, but neither
do we believe that the senate
should consciously seek to avoid
controversy. We believe that
the senate should address, and
through its influence with the
University administration and
campus-wide public opinion,
seek a remedy for several seri
ous campus problems:
1. There is no reason for the
return of the "F" grade apart
from a peculiar desire on the
part of certain faculty to impose
their own sense of "merito
cracy" on the undergraduate
population. It is impossible to
quantify learning either numer
ically or with a letter grade.
2. Fraternities have prac
ticed open and notorious racial
discrimination for decades.
What have the frats done to
remedy their record of past dis
crimination? How many mem
bers of minority communities
feel welcome on the row? We
believe the frats should under
take a sincere affirmative ac
tion program. Otherwise Stan
ford in good conscience cannot
continue to tolerate their pres
ence
3. Do House fellows always
do a good job? Res Ed should re
appoint resident fellows on a
merit basis and not as a per
petual system of cronyism
4 Ethnic theme houses
should be given an equal op
portunity share in the best of
Stanford housing. The place
ment of Casa Zapata in Stern
Hall is an affront to the Stanford
Chicano community.
Raga Klim
Elim is clearly one of this
year's strongest candidates.
Through his extensive ex
perience in leadership roles.
Elim has come to learn the im
portance of motivating people
and working well with others.
He is a very hard worker and he
has a unique ability of trans
ferring his enthusiasm to oth
ers, two qualities that would
make him a good senator. Final
ly, his work in the Om
budsman's office this past year
has given him a good insight into
the concerns and complaints of
the students.
Major concerns include:
Election Reform:
Have several opportunities
for the students to meet and
question the candidates.
Limit areas for posters to one
spot for each dorm and have this
rule strictly enforced.
Eliminate the Daily endorse
ments because it is not right
that a small panel of people
have that much influence in an
election.
Improve student body/senate
communications by having the
senate meetings in dorm
lounges. This will increase stu
dent input and make the senate
more visable.
Elim's only promise is hard
work and I think he deserves
your vote this Wednesday and
Thursday.
Fritz Fischer
My name is Fritz Fischer,
and my campaign for the senate
has one major theme, which can
best be expressed in a question
â€” Do you know what the ASSU
Senate does? If you are like
most students I've talked to,

your honest answer would be no.
This is a ridiculous problem.
The senate is the student's only
representative body, yet the stu
dents have absolutely no idea
what it does We see and learn
about the final results, yet we
have very little direct say in
their initiation.
I am currently a freshman,
and consider myself a "typical"
Stanford student, who is in
terested in the concerns of the
student body. My experience in
the ASSU is none, because I, like
most of you, had no idea what a
senator was or did until just re
cently. Yet I have been actively
involved in student government
in the past (high school, dorm
government) and am very will
ing to put in the time needed for
the job. It is essential that the
senate reflects true student
opinions in its decisions.
If the student body wants the
senate to represent the views of
the student body in world af
fairs, then the senate should. If
not, then the senate should not.
Ideas I have for increasing stu
dent involvement in the senate
include a senate liaison for each
dorm, open senate meetings in
dorms and dinners and social
events sponsored by the senate.
In short, the senate should be
what the students of Stanford
make it, and if elected I intend
to make it that way.
Jim Grundberg
I was disillusioned when I
read the Daily endorsements
the other day, if only because
their strong statements were
solely based on a short five
minute interview. Unless the
Daily is prepared to do a bit
more research than that, it has
no place in judging the abilities
of various candidates. The Dai
ly turned a very casual and un
professional interview into
some very powerful endorse
ments, and this represented a
total lack of responsibility on its
part.
Like most candidates, I could
have discussed some issues of
great concern to me, such as
bringing back concerts, "better
social life," or more student
faculty interaction in my Daily
"interview." I didn't have time
though, hence the editors ap

parently assumed I lacked'' sen
sitivity" to the important is
sues instead I took it as obvious
that we'd all like to see certain
improvements, and dealt with
the more fundamental question
â€” How can we improve the
process by which we can deal
with these issues? This year's
senate commands no respect
from the students, but students
can't be blamed because there
is no senate/student body in
teraction. Who is the senate rep
resenting?
We. as students, can have our
opinions heard, but only if we
first strengthen the network of
University policymaking, in
cluding the relationships be
tween the students and faculty,
the senate, and the decision
making committees. The senate
should keep in close touch with
student representatives on
these committees, and relay all
developments to students in the
form of senate meetings in
dorm lounges or dining halls.
ASSU sponsored educational fo
rums, to solicit student ideas,
are also necessary. Only if sena
tors concentrate their efforts
toward satisfying the foremost
needs and concerns of students,
will we make any progress
towards more effective student
representation at this school. A
vote for Jim Grundberg would
be a step in the right direction.
Paul Khavari
There is a vital point that
needs to be emphasized among
the factors of this year's cam
paign for the senate and it en
compasses the major concerns
receiving attention. This is the
absolute necessity of per
spective. For candidates so vo
cal about making Tresidder into
a real "student union," about
changing the Draw, about im
proving student-faculty rela
tions and about bringing back
concerts, this perspective is
crucial.
The ASSU functions on many
interfaces with University ad
ministration and it is here
where lack of perspective hurts
us, the students, the most. The
administration functions on
five- to 12-year guidelines while
all too many ASSU projects are
plagued with solely one year's

effort before being abandoned
The students must adjust to this
fact and realize that Tresidder
won't be transformed in three
quarters, that housing will be
radically affected by the new
dorms on the planning boards
and that student-faculty contact
can expand only through pa
tient, concerted and organized
effort among many other
things. Some candidates boast
of their desirable "freshness"
to the process and goals of the
association â€” a freshness that
might easily appear later as
costly ignorance
I am strongly against that
kind of instant success hopeful
ness. Only by being aware of
long-term trends as well as the
capacity for change that a sin
gle year involves will keep the
ASSU on a course most benefi
cial to the students in the long
run and prevent the kind of dis
organized, sporadic and ineffi
cient functioning that destroys
the organization's credibility in
the eyes of its members and hin
ders worthwhile achievement.
Perspective, then, is the fac
tor that will determine whether
the new senate will spend a
whole year discovering limita
tions and learning from their
mistakes only to leave when ap
proaching competency or
whether it will pick up on past
achievements and efficiently
apply their efforts to advance
student interests.
Bambi Markel
I would like to challenge the
Daily for neglecting to endorse
a single woman candidate for
the ASSU Senate. Woman make
up 45 percent of the Stanford
student body and deserve repre
sentation, especially as several
qualified female candidates are
running. I would also like to
point out the differences be
tween the other candidates and
myself, to clarify my particular
qualifications and ideas:
1) I was appointed to the Sub
committee on the Evaluation
and Improvement of Teaching. I
realize that certain depart
ments, especially math, object
to the very existence of the
ASSU Course Guide. As sena
tor, I would work to retain and
improve the Guide. Students

are the best judges of a pro
fessor's ability to teach stu
dents deserve to benefit from
the opinions of other students
2) The ASSU Finance Com
mittee must have a greater role
in auditing the finances of stu
dent organizations Presently,
student groups outline potential
budgets before the Finance
Committee, which then awards
funds, drawn from tuition The
senate does not require student
groups to report back to the Fi
nance Committee concerning
how they have actually spent
the funds With greater accoun
tability to the Finance Commit
tee, financial crises such as that
experienced by Special Events
could be recognized and dealt
with at an early stage Concerts
could be brought back and man
aged efficiently.
3) Through the senate, stu
dents can be influential political
lobbyists when necessary.
Educated by ASSU forums such
as the one on El Salvador, the
student body can then choose
whether or not to act For exam
ple, the Reagan administration
has slashed government-spon
sored student grants and loans.
If the senate discovered,
through polls, student opposi
tion to these cuts, the senate
could protest through a
statement backed by the entire
student bodv.
I have the initiative, creativi
ty, and energy to act on behalf of
YOUR and my ideas. If you
would like to see a more visible
and effective student senate,
please vote for Bambi Markel
on April 15 and 16.
Tracey Minkin
In a short campaign week that
feels like six months, the faces
and words of the senate race
have formed a smiling
homogeneous blur. Concerts,
lighting, linen, El Salvador
these catch-phrases are bounc
ing care-freely from one speech
to the next knock on the door.
Today and tomorrow, 35 or so
names will emerge from this
cloud and ask for your approval
and up to 10 votes. Where, then,
to check?
Consider my approach. I see
the problem areas and am con
cerned about the '81-'B2 Stan
ford issues, but will not act as a
senator until an intelligent and
comprehensive survey is done
this spring, advisably through
Residential Education chan

nels, and specific short-com
mgs. strengths, needs and alter
natives are discerned With this
detailed information, what
looks to be a new senate com
mitted to ASSU can take de
cisive and unified action.
This is the machinery behind
the word "priorities."
Personally, I have put this job
in the absolute forefront of my
outlook for/iext year, and view
the accompanying responsi
bilities very, very seriously.
This job is m\ priority.
So, confronted in the coming
days with the lengthy list of the
senate 35, please remember
that thinking and commitment
will make the difference in a
senator
Out of the issues blur, I will
give you both of those.
Marty Roberts
My name is Marty Roberts
and I am running for the ASSU
Senate My experience includes
being a member of the Califor
nia State Champion Parlia
mentary Procedure Team. With
this background I feel that I
would be well qualified to serve
as Senate Parliamentarian.
Other activities include being a
member of the 1979 National
Champion livestock judging
team, a KZSU sportscaster, a
member of the wrestling team,
and an active participant in
NCAA rodeo.
1 am very enthusiastic about
the senate's increasing ability
to respond to student concerns
and would very much like to be a
part of this process. This year's
senate has worked to improve
the senate's interaction with
students. We must continue this
effort through newsletters,
sherry hours, the creation of a
publicity committee, and more
frequent polling on important
issues.
Minority concerns should not
be just a concern of the groups
involved â€” they affect the en
tire community. The senate
should strive toward achieving
a better life for minorities at
Stanford. This means paying
special attention to minority
groups when deciding on group
funding.
Have you spent an all-nighter
at the CPPC? Many students
have! This problem can be dealt
with by the creation of a senate
task force to look into the CPPC
procedures.

The ASSU provides many stu
dent services such as lecture
notes, typing. T-shirts, etc I
propose that the ASSU create a
Bus Service to make buses
available for dorm trips and oth
er campus group activities The
advantages of the service would
include increased safety, lower
costs to students, convenience,
and energy conservation.
There are plenty of important
issues that the senate can focus
on right here at Stanford I feel
that the senate should stay out
of world politics unless a ma
jority of students want the sen
ate to make a stand on a certain
issue. The senate should always
reflect student opinion, not per
sonal views.
Thomas Yeatch
My name is Tom Veatch, and
I'm running for the ASSU Sen
ate Due to a misinformation
problem I missed the Daily sen
ate endorsement interviews. To
make up here are some issues
that I will work on in the senate.
First, the ASSU Senate, com
mittees and house governments
need to be linked to work in
synchrony and thus to better
solve problems. Student
projects and problem-solving
discussions in house meetings
and in the ASSU should not go on
in isolation, but with each oth
er's resources available.
Circulating relevant ideas to
people and organizations that
can help by means of memos
and perhaps newsletters is a
small thing that can help our
system work much more effec
tively.
Second, the student aid cuts
that loom ahead, if opposed by
the student body (let's find out
â€” polls are easy!), should be
lobbied against.
Third, the services of the
ASSl T Course (iuide would be
expanded and improved by in
cluding a list of small, ac
cessible classes (making close
student-faculty interaction
more available to those stuck
with "big, impersonal classes''
â€” after all, this is what Stanford
is all about).
These are some major, yet
workable, improvements that I
feel should be made, and that 1
will work for as a senator There
is much more to say and do. but
this is a beginning. Thank you
for the chance to avoid being
passed over in silence.

more research than that, it has
no place in judging the abilities
of various candidates. The Dai
ly turned a very casual and un
professional interview into
some very powerful endorse
ments, and this represented a
total lack of responsibility on its
part.
Like most candidates, I could
have discussed some issues of
great concern to me, such as
bringing back concerts, "better
social life," or more student
faculty interaction in my Daily
"interview." I didn't have time
though, hence the editors ap

parently assumed I lacked'' sen
sitivity" to the important is
sues instead I took it as obvious
that we'd all like to see certain
improvements, and dealt with
the more fundamental question
â€” How can we improve the
process by which we can deal
with these issues? This year's
senate commands no respect
from the students, but students
can't be blamed because there
is no senate/student body in
teraction. Who is the senate rep
resenting?
We. as students, can have our
opinions heard, but only if we
first strengthen the network of
University policymaking, in
cluding the relationships be
tween the students and faculty,
the senate, and the decision
making committees. The senate
should keep in close touch with
student representatives on
these committees, and relay all
developments to students in the
form of senate meetings in
dorm lounges or dining halls.
ASSU sponsored educational fo
rums, to solicit student ideas,
are also necessary. Only if sena
tors concentrate their efforts
toward satisfying the foremost
needs and concerns of students,
will we make any progress
towards more effective student
representation at this school. A
vote for Jim Grundberg would
be a step in the right direction.
Paul Khavari
There is a vital point that
needs to be emphasized among
the factors of this year's cam
paign for the senate and it en
compasses the major concerns
receiving attention. This is the
absolute necessity of per
spective. For candidates so vo
cal about making Tresidder into
a real "student union," about
changing the Draw, about im
proving student-faculty rela
tions and about bringing back
concerts, this perspective is
crucial.
The ASSU functions on many
interfaces with University ad
ministration and it is here
where lack of perspective hurts
us, the students, the most. The
administration functions on
five- to 12-year guidelines while
all too many ASSU projects are
plagued with solely one year's

effort before being abandoned
The students must adjust to this
fact and realize that Tresidder
won't be transformed in three
quarters, that housing will be
radically affected by the new
dorms on the planning boards
and that student-faculty contact
can expand only through pa
tient, concerted and organized
effort among many other
things. Some candidates boast
of their desirable "freshness"
to the process and goals of the
association â€” a freshness that
might easily appear later as
costly ignorance
I am strongly against that
kind of instant success hopeful
ness. Only by being aware of
long-term trends as well as the
capacity for change that a sin
gle year involves will keep the
ASSU on a course most benefi
cial to the students in the long
run and prevent the kind of dis
organized, sporadic and ineffi
cient functioning that destroys
the organization's credibility in
the eyes of its members and hin
ders worthwhile achievement.
Perspective, then, is the fac
tor that will determine whether
the new senate will spend a
whole year discovering limita
tions and learning from their
mistakes only to leave when ap
proaching competency or
whether it will pick up on past
achievements and efficiently
apply their efforts to advance
student interests.
Bambi Markel
I would like to challenge the
Daily for neglecting to endorse
a single woman candidate for
the ASSU Senate. Woman make
up 45 percent of the Stanford
student body and deserve repre
sentation, especially as several
qualified female candidates are
running. I would also like to
point out the differences be
tween the other candidates and
myself, to clarify my particular
qualifications and ideas:
1) I was appointed to the Sub
committee on the Evaluation
and Improvement of Teaching. I
realize that certain depart
ments, especially math, object
to the very existence of the
ASSU Course Guide. As sena
tor, I would work to retain and
improve the Guide. Students

are the best judges of a pro
fessor's ability to teach stu
dents deserve to benefit from
the opinions of other students
2) The ASSU Finance Com
mittee must have a greater role
in auditing the finances of stu
dent organizations Presently,
student groups outline potential
budgets before the Finance
Committee, which then awards
funds, drawn from tuition The
senate does not require student
groups to report back to the Fi
nance Committee concerning
how they have actually spent
the funds With greater accoun
tability to the Finance Commit
tee, financial crises such as that
experienced by Special Events
could be recognized and dealt
with at an early stage Concerts
could be brought back and man
aged efficiently.
3) Through the senate, stu
dents can be influential political
lobbyists when necessary.
Educated by ASSU forums such
as the one on El Salvador, the
student body can then choose
whether or not to act For exam
ple, the Reagan administration
has slashed government-spon
sored student grants and loans.
If the senate discovered,
through polls, student opposi
tion to these cuts, the senate
could protest through a
statement backed by the entire
student bodv.
I have the initiative, creativi
ty, and energy to act on behalf of
YOUR and my ideas. If you
would like to see a more visible
and effective student senate,
please vote for Bambi Markel
on April 15 and 16.
Tracey Minkin
In a short campaign week that
feels like six months, the faces
and words of the senate race
have formed a smiling
homogeneous blur. Concerts,
lighting, linen, El Salvador
these catch-phrases are bounc
ing care-freely from one speech
to the next knock on the door.
Today and tomorrow, 35 or so
names will emerge from this
cloud and ask for your approval
and up to 10 votes. Where, then,
to check?
Consider my approach. I see
the problem areas and am con
cerned about the '81-'B2 Stan
ford issues, but will not act as a
senator until an intelligent and
comprehensive survey is done
this spring, advisably through
Residential Education chan

nels, and specific short-com
mgs. strengths, needs and alter
natives are discerned With this
detailed information, what
looks to be a new senate com
mitted to ASSU can take de
cisive and unified action.
This is the machinery behind
the word "priorities."
Personally, I have put this job
in the absolute forefront of my
outlook for/iext year, and view
the accompanying responsi
bilities very, very seriously.
This job is m\ priority.
So, confronted in the coming
days with the lengthy list of the
senate 35, please remember
that thinking and commitment
will make the difference in a
senator
Out of the issues blur, I will
give you both of those.
Marty Roberts
My name is Marty Roberts
and I am running for the ASSU
Senate My experience includes
being a member of the Califor
nia State Champion Parlia
mentary Procedure Team. With
this background I feel that I
would be well qualified to serve
as Senate Parliamentarian.
Other activities include being a
member of the 1979 National
Champion livestock judging
team, a KZSU sportscaster, a
member of the wrestling team,
and an active participant in
NCAA rodeo.
1 am very enthusiastic about
the senate's increasing ability
to respond to student concerns
and would very much like to be a
part of this process. This year's
senate has worked to improve
the senate's interaction with
students. We must continue this
effort through newsletters,
sherry hours, the creation of a
publicity committee, and more
frequent polling on important
issues.
Minority concerns should not
be just a concern of the groups
involved â€” they affect the en
tire community. The senate
should strive toward achieving
a better life for minorities at
Stanford. This means paying
special attention to minority
groups when deciding on group
funding.
Have you spent an all-nighter
at the CPPC? Many students
have! This problem can be dealt
with by the creation of a senate
task force to look into the CPPC
procedures.

The ASSU provides many stu
dent services such as lecture
notes, typing. T-shirts, etc I
propose that the ASSU create a
Bus Service to make buses
available for dorm trips and oth
er campus group activities The
advantages of the service would
include increased safety, lower
costs to students, convenience,
and energy conservation.
There are plenty of important
issues that the senate can focus
on right here at Stanford I feel
that the senate should stay out
of world politics unless a ma
jority of students want the sen
ate to make a stand on a certain
issue. The senate should always
reflect student opinion, not per
sonal views.
Thomas Yeatch
My name is Tom Veatch, and
I'm running for the ASSU Sen
ate Due to a misinformation
problem I missed the Daily sen
ate endorsement interviews. To
make up here are some issues
that I will work on in the senate.
First, the ASSU Senate, com
mittees and house governments
need to be linked to work in
synchrony and thus to better
solve problems. Student
projects and problem-solving
discussions in house meetings
and in the ASSU should not go on
in isolation, but with each oth
er's resources available.
Circulating relevant ideas to
people and organizations that
can help by means of memos
and perhaps newsletters is a
small thing that can help our
system work much more effec
tively.
Second, the student aid cuts
that loom ahead, if opposed by
the student body (let's find out
â€” polls are easy!), should be
lobbied against.
Third, the services of the
ASSl T Course (iuide would be
expanded and improved by in
cluding a list of small, ac
cessible classes (making close
student-faculty interaction
more available to those stuck
with "big, impersonal classes''
â€” after all, this is what Stanford
is all about).
These are some major, yet
workable, improvements that I
feel should be made, and that 1
will work for as a senator There
is much more to say and do. but
this is a beginning. Thank you
for the chance to avoid being
passed over in silence.
()n Monday and yesterday,
following Friday's final dead
line for declaration of can
didacy. the Daily published its
endorsements of candidates
running for the ASSU Senate.
Here, the Daily is providing
space for rebuttal to those can
didates who were not endorsed.
Cricket Barlow
This campus needs new life!
The posters of me licking an ice
cream cone I hope reflect my
light-hearted personality. How
ever, I do take the issues seri
ously.
My intention is to focus the
ASSU on the students again.
Through concerts, a student
union, and a closer relationship
between faculty and students,
the ASSU can promote cohesive
ness in student activities. Have
you ever noticed that the only
weekend activities are dorm or
fraternity sponsored?
I am presently working on the
Student Alumni Network
(S.T.A.N.) whose major em
phasis is to support class togeth
erness. But Stanford not only
needs class interaction but uni
versity interaction as well. This
can be done by forming a stu
dent union to accomodate the
needs of all students. We need a
central meeting place to serve
as a comfortable alternative for
everyone.
I propose that we renovate
Tresidder so that it can be used
both day and night. The way to
achieve this is through a concen
trated effort of the senate. In
stead of delegating powers to
committees, why not use the
power of the senate effectively,
to follow through on these pro
posals.
The senate has a lot of poten
tial power, and I've seen that
through student initiative,
projects can be accomplished.
The senate can only do as much
as the students are willing to put
into it. I'm enthusiastic and
ready to take on the responsi
bilities of the senate as a body
working for the students.
So vote for Cricket Barlow,
and together we can lick the sys
tem.

Caroline Cheng
As a committee staff assis
tant, COP-intern, and ex-officio
member of the Nominations
Committee for the ASSU, I re
alize the importance of the
Committee System, where stu
dents can directly influence
University policy from the
Pass/No Credit option to the
Western Culture requirement.
Through the Committee Sys
tem, we can make the ASSU
stronger in influencing decision
making which greatly affects
students.
The ASSU lacks a centralized
publicity network. The result is
that people rarely know what
the senate and the ASSU are
doing. Monthly newsletters
about ASSU activities, and put
ting such information in regis
tration packets can improve
communication. Having more
polls, forums and senate meet
ings in dorms are other ways of
finding out student needs and
directing attention to them.
I am concerned about bring
ing student groups not tradi
tionally associated with the
ASSU such as ethnic and wom
en's organizations closer to the
ASSU by allowing them to give
monthly presentations before
the senate.
Although the ASSU repre
sents both graduates and under
grads, graduate issues have not
often been at the forefront of the
senate. Federal budget cuts and
the lack of graduate housing
should also be important issues.
How many of you felt that the
Approaching Stanford gave you
a feel for Stanford before you
came here? Graduate students
don't have that. I want to set up
a Graduate Approaching Stan
ford.
One way to counteract the ris
ing cost of education would be
the creation of a book exchange
or rental system for those who
want it. I propose to continue
the research started by last
year's senate and make buying
books more equitable.
Ultimately, the ASSU is a stu
dent service. Through better
communication and organiza
tion we can make it more re

sponsive to students.
Tom Dill
My name is Tom Dill and I am
a junior majoring in political
science. Due to extenuating cir
cumstances I was unable to at
tend my Daily interview and I
appreciate this opportunity to
express my views. The issues I
see as important to the student
body of Stanford University in
clude the following:
Take an in-depth look at the
possibility of having Special
Events (concerts) on campus.
There is sufficient interest to
warrant a re-attempt at co-pro
ducing a concert at Stanford.
This co-production could be
used as a case study and stu
dents could learn from pro
moters how to properly struc
ture a concert. It would also
enable the ASSU to determine
the feasibility of future concerts
on campus.
Improve relations between
the ASSU and Tresidder. The
ASSU should consider the ad
vantages of incorporating the
Recreation Center and The
Store into student-run organiza
tions. Such a restructuring
would make the facilities more
reflective of student needs and
improve their appropriateness
on campus. Revise the structure
of the Fee Assessment system.
Review ASSU projects. The
Typesetting service has lost
money in the past and the Typ
ing Service may not be in ex
istence next year. These ser
vices must be reviewed and re
organized along more efficient
lines. The senate must narrow
its objectives to achieve its
goals.
Finally, improved com
munication between the ASSU
and the student body is essential
if the senate is to remain an ef
fective organization of student
government. Vote Tom Dill for
ASSU Senate April 15 and 16.
Paul Elliott, Jan Rang
We are running for the senate
because we believe that any stu
dent political organization, no
matter how trivial, can become
a significant voice for change
within the University. The sen
ate need not be an organization
dedicated to the self-aggran
dizement of its few members.
The senate will become impor
tant only when its members be
gin to address fundamental is
sues and not petty student con
cerns. We do not advocate the
use of the senate as a forum for
the airing of national and in
ternational issues, but neither
do we believe that the senate
should consciously seek to avoid
controversy. We believe that
the senate should address, and
through its influence with the
University administration and
campus-wide public opinion,
seek a remedy for several seri
ous campus problems:
1. There is no reason for the
return of the "F" grade apart
from a peculiar desire on the
part of certain faculty to impose
their own sense of "merito
cracy" on the undergraduate
population. It is impossible to
quantify learning either numer
ically or with a letter grade.
2. Fraternities have prac
ticed open and notorious racial
discrimination for decades.
What have the frats done to
remedy their record of past dis
crimination? How many mem
bers of minority communities
feel welcome on the row? We
believe the frats should under
take a sincere affirmative ac
tion program. Otherwise Stan
ford in good conscience cannot
continue to tolerate their pres
ence
3. Do House fellows always
do a good job? Res Ed should re
appoint resident fellows on a
merit basis and not as a per
petual system of cronyism
4 Ethnic theme houses
should be given an equal op
portunity share in the best of
Stanford housing. The place
ment of Casa Zapata in Stern
Hall is an affront to the Stanford
Chicano community.
Raga Klim
Elim is clearly one of this
year's strongest candidates.
Through his extensive ex
perience in leadership roles.
Elim has come to learn the im
portance of motivating people
and working well with others.
He is a very hard worker and he
has a unique ability of trans
ferring his enthusiasm to oth
ers, two qualities that would
make him a good senator. Final
ly, his work in the Om
budsman's office this past year
has given him a good insight into
the concerns and complaints of
the students.
Major concerns include:
Election Reform:
Have several opportunities
for the students to meet and
question the candidates.
Limit areas for posters to one
spot for each dorm and have this
rule strictly enforced.
Eliminate the Daily endorse
ments because it is not right
that a small panel of people
have that much influence in an
election.
Improve student body/senate
communications by having the
senate meetings in dorm
lounges. This will increase stu
dent input and make the senate
more visable.
Elim's only promise is hard
work and I think he deserves
your vote this Wednesday and
Thursday.
Fritz Fischer
My name is Fritz Fischer,
and my campaign for the senate
has one major theme, which can
best be expressed in a question
â€” Do you know what the ASSU
Senate does? If you are like
most students I've talked to,

your honest answer would be no.
This is a ridiculous problem.
The senate is the student's only
representative body, yet the stu
dents have absolutely no idea
what it does We see and learn
about the final results, yet we
have very little direct say in
their initiation.
I am currently a freshman,
and consider myself a "typical"
Stanford student, who is in
terested in the concerns of the
student body. My experience in
the ASSU is none, because I, like
most of you, had no idea what a
senator was or did until just re
cently. Yet I have been actively
involved in student government
in the past (high school, dorm
government) and am very will
ing to put in the time needed for
the job. It is essential that the
senate reflects true student
opinions in its decisions.
If the student body wants the
senate to represent the views of
the student body in world af
fairs, then the senate should. If
not, then the senate should not.
Ideas I have for increasing stu
dent involvement in the senate
include a senate liaison for each
dorm, open senate meetings in
dorms and dinners and social
events sponsored by the senate.
In short, the senate should be
what the students of Stanford
make it, and if elected I intend
to make it that way.
Jim Grundberg
I was disillusioned when I
read the Daily endorsements
the other day, if only because
their strong statements were
solely based on a short five
minute interview. Unless the
Daily is prepared to do a bit
more research than that, it has
no place in judging the abilities
of various candidates. The Dai
