## Fraternity offers freedom of choice 
### 
Freedom of choice is what you've got
Freedom from choice is what you need
Often in recent years, some who pursue
what they consider to be almost ethereal
lifestyles and seek to convert the masses to
the same have portrayed fraternities as
dens of iniquitous hedonism by and for the
son of the American aristocratic bourgeois.
It has been claimed that fraternity mem
bers choose women as one would a rump
roast in a butcher shop, do little but drink
and shortly thereafter vomit the elixers of
Augie Busch and Joe Coors, all aspire to
look like George Bush and speak like Bill
Buckley, kill faggots, and are junior mem
bers of the Klan who dress in white sheets
and burn crosses at initiation. This is
purported to be true as it is purported that
fraternities have lost their charters at vari
ous times for admitting Jews and blacks.
At the same time, some fraternity
membes have noted that some of those who
criticize their lifestyles live in residences
which "self-select" members, never take
showers, have bean sprouts growing out of
their ears because Q-tips are bad karma,
think that a gourmet meal is pouring your
choice of Seven Seas on the front lawn for
Bermuda and Zoysia salads — without
utensils (verrrry mellowly mowing grass
wastes energy, man), share beds with 10
others who may or may not be of the op
posite sex, and use the American flag as a
toilet. Worst of all, the females never shave
their armpits, and castrate men for the
crime of possessing a Playboy. (It has been
purported that when once this happened the
victim did not resist his androgonous at
tackers as he practiced non-violence).
The aforementioned stereotypes and ster
eotypical practices are to say the least, fan
tastic. Whichever one prefers — sprouts or
steaks, beer and coke or shrooms and
dirtweed, monogamy or musical beds, or
something in between — fraternities and
priority houses to lesser or greater degrees
choose those with whom they wish to live,
have chosen and made great efforts to live
there, and make great efforts to make their

abodes what they want them to be. Such res
idences may be termed selective. As a
member of a fraternity I chose the place I
wanted to be and the place where I live
chose me to live there.
In fraternity rush as well as in priority
rush, it may be said that an invisible hand
sees to it that people get into the residence
they want and that the residences find the
membership they want. Further, there is no
shortage of fraternity space as two-thirds of
the houses did not make quota; they certain
ly cannot be the abodes of exclusionary
WASPS promoting social plutocracy as they
have much more space that can be filled by
Texans with black Cadillacs. Lastly,
fraternity room, board, and social bills are
within a $100 range either way of full board
and room at Wilbur.
Fraternities make no attempt to exclude
people by charging exorbitant fees. They
could not if they wanted to since they have
many spaces to fill. Those who derogate
fraternities tend to do so most often on
grounds of equity. Such living arrange
ments tend to favor the sons of the affluent
who have the "right" social connections and
prepare them to grasp the mantle of the
legacy to be passed on by their forebears.
Also advanced is the argument that these
sons should have to experience "alternative
lifestyles" so such aristrocracies and old
boy networks do not perpetuate themselves
at the expense of "Third-World-People"; it
is desired that there be equality of condition
as well as of opportunity.
It is well and good to promulgate personal
qualities which enable individuals to in
teract with others from a broad spectrum
of backgrounds; however, the ability to do
so seems to be an essential prerequisite for
admission to Stanford. Further, if one is not
a well-adjusted member of the human com
munity by the time one is 18 years old, the
problem is best left to a psychiatrist, cer
tainly not a group of socially-level pseudo
psychologists and sociologists.
Lastly, a person's home is his castle
whether or not it be on the Stanford Cam

pus; nothing seems to be more traumatic
than having to go back to a roommate and
hallmates who as likely as not are a bunch of
flaming shitheels that he got put with by the
omniscients at the Housing Office (who pair
people up by height and weight after a day's
academic grind). If the people one doesn't
like happen to be of some minority, such
hostility, albeit wrongly, most often is
translated into bigotry. Thus, the results de
sired are turned on their head.
Most fundamentally, a university is a
place for a student to learn how to make
choices independently. The last thing a stu
dent needs is for big-brother type charac
ters to tell him what's good for him. Best of
all, the student can commend himself for
the friends he has made and has no one else
to blame for the flaming shitheels he meets.
The University has a diverse student
body; it is not a place for Devo units. Any at
tempts to create such a student body
should be regarded as farcical. However,
when I leave the Farm, I hope to find a
neighborhood where I can enjoy my neigh
bors and feel comfortable with them.
That is the essence of brotherhood, of
fraternity. There is no reason why our little
dreamland should not conform with reality.
And reality is not living in standardized
housing with standardized people. I shall not
go into the economics of housing in the real
world, but if you value a nice living environ
ment you shall go out and earn the money to
support such. You may consider this sim
plistic, but then truth is often much simpler
than we are led to believe.
So, in the next two weeks, go and find the
people you feel comfortable with whether
they be in fraternities, priority houses, or
dorms. No economic or racial binds hold
these houses together, just people who en
joy each other. Isn't that really what life's
all about?

crime of possessing a Playboy. (It has been
purported that when once this happened the
victim did not resist his androgonous at
tackers as he practiced non-violence).
The aforementioned stereotypes and ster
eotypical practices are to say the least, fan
tastic. Whichever one prefers — sprouts or
steaks, beer and coke or shrooms and
dirtweed, monogamy or musical beds, or
something in between — fraternities and
priority houses to lesser or greater degrees
choose those with whom they wish to live,
have chosen and made great efforts to live
there, and make great efforts to make their

abodes what they want them to be. Such res
idences may be termed selective. As a
member of a fraternity I chose the place I
wanted to be and the place where I live
chose me to live there.
In fraternity rush as well as in priority
rush, it may be said that an invisible hand
sees to it that people get into the residence
they want and that the residences find the
membership they want. Further, there is no
shortage of fraternity space as two-thirds of
the houses did not make quota; they certain
ly cannot be the abodes of exclusionary
WASPS promoting social plutocracy as they
have much more space that can be filled by
Texans with black Cadillacs. Lastly,
fraternity room, board, and social bills are
within a $100 range either way of full board
and room at Wilbur.
Fraternities make no attempt to exclude
people by charging exorbitant fees. They
could not if they wanted to since they have
many spaces to fill. Those who derogate
fraternities tend to do so most often on
grounds of equity. Such living arrange
ments tend to favor the sons of the affluent
who have the "right" social connections and
prepare them to grasp the mantle of the
legacy to be passed on by their forebears.
Also advanced is the argument that these
sons should have to experience "alternative
lifestyles" so such aristrocracies and old
boy networks do not perpetuate themselves
at the expense of "Third-World-People"; it
is desired that there be equality of condition
as well as of opportunity.
It is well and good to promulgate personal
qualities which enable individuals to in
teract with others from a broad spectrum
of backgrounds; however, the ability to do
so seems to be an essential prerequisite for
admission to Stanford. Further, if one is not
a well-adjusted member of the human com
munity by the time one is 18 years old, the
problem is best left to a psychiatrist, cer
tainly not a group of socially-level pseudo
psychologists and sociologists.
Lastly, a person's home is his castle
whether or not it be on the Stanford Cam

pus; nothing seems to be more traumatic
than having to go back to a roommate and
hallmates who as likely as not are a bunch of
flaming shitheels that he got put with by the
omniscients at the Housing Office (who pair
people up by height and weight after a day's
academic grind). If the people one doesn't
like happen to be of some minority, such
hostility, albeit wrongly, most often is
translated into bigotry. Thus, the results de
sired are turned on their head.
Most fundamentally, a university is a
place for a student to learn how to make
choices independently. The last thing a stu
dent needs is for big-brother type charac
ters to tell him what's good for him. Best of
all, the student can commend himself for
the friends he has made and has no one else
to blame for the flaming shitheels he meets.
The University has a diverse student
body; it is not a place for Devo units. Any at
tempts to create such a student body
should be regarded as farcical. However,
when I leave the Farm, I hope to find a
neighborhood where I can enjoy my neigh
bors and feel comfortable with them.
That is the essence of brotherhood, of
fraternity. There is no reason why our little
dreamland should not conform with reality.
And reality is not living in standardized
housing with standardized people. I shall not
go into the economics of housing in the real
world, but if you value a nice living environ
ment you shall go out and earn the money to
support such. You may consider this sim
plistic, but then truth is often much simpler
than we are led to believe.
So, in the next two weeks, go and find the
people you feel comfortable with whether
they be in fraternities, priority houses, or
dorms. No economic or racial binds hold
these houses together, just people who en
joy each other. Isn't that really what life's
all about?

Freedom of choice is what you've got
Freedom from choice is what you need
Often in recent years, some who pursue
what they consider to be almost ethereal
lifestyles and seek to convert the masses to
the same have portrayed fraternities as
dens of iniquitous hedonism by and for the
son of the American aristocratic bourgeois.
It has been claimed that fraternity mem
bers choose women as one would a rump
roast in a butcher shop, do little but drink
and shortly thereafter vomit the elixers of
Augie Busch and Joe Coors, all aspire to
look like George Bush and speak like Bill
Buckley, kill faggots, and are junior mem
bers of the Klan who dress in white sheets
and burn crosses at initiation. This is
purported to be true as it is purported that
fraternities have lost their charters at vari
ous times for admitting Jews and blacks.
At the same time, some fraternity
membes have noted that some of those who
criticize their lifestyles live in residences
which "self-select" members, never take
showers, have bean sprouts growing out of
their ears because Q-tips are bad karma,
think that a gourmet meal is pouring your
choice of Seven Seas on the front lawn for
Bermuda and Zoysia salads — without
utensils (verrrry mellowly mowing grass
wastes energy, man), share beds with 10
others who may or may not be of the op
posite sex, and use the American flag as a
toilet. Worst of all, the females never shave
their armpits, and castrate men for the
crime of possessing a Playboy. (It has been
purported that when once this happened the
