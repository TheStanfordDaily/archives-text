Support STAN
Class activities and use of
alumni resources have been
missing from the university
campus for a long time. This
winter the alumni association
helped to organize a group of 57
students to work on projects to
fill this void.
In the two months that the
Student Alumni Network
(STAN) has been in existence it
has organized class activities
such as several sophomore and
junior study breaks at Encina
Station, an ice-cream party for
juniors, a sophomore field in
Frost with live music and free
ice-cream, and a freshman
Luau.
We have also arranged an
alumni-by degree program,
where alums will come to Stan
ford and talk to students about
the effectiveness of their
degree. This program is de
signed to help students choose a
mjaor and to give them an idea
of what they can do with it.
We are also working on a
home-away-from-home pro
gram which will match up alum
ni families in the area with
freshmen. The families will
have their freshmen over for
dinner once a quarter and do
other activities with them.
Many people have asked why
the alumni association is in
terested in class activities.
They would like to promote
class unity and make their ser
vices more available to stu
dents They too. as do many stu
dents, see a lack of class ac
tivities between the time of
freshmen orientation and senior
class activities. Why can't
freshmen, sophomores and jun
iors participate in "class soli
darity" activities as seniors do?
Why wait until senior year.
Up until now, the activities
have been sponsored by Stan
ford Alumni Association. Each

class has been working with a
$400 budget. We feel that a one
quarter fee assessment is essen
tial to expand this pilot program
into something that can be ef
fective or a University-wide
scale.
Please join us and vote yes on
the Student Alumni Network fee
assessment.

The better half?
In a limited scope campus
election, it is the privilege and
responsibility of an un
challenged information source
to present a reliably intelligent
editorial. Your candidate en
dorsements of (Daily, April 13)
fail in this obligation. Though it
might be your felt duty to make
biased endorsements in an elec
tion so relevant to students, is is
not your entrusted perogative to
make ill-researched, ir
responsible renunciations of
particular candidates. By nam
ing Jon Blum as the "more dom
inant and capable half" of the
Cynthia Ellise/Jon Blum ticket,
you have abused our trust by un
justly eliminating a candidate
from our consideration.
A brief interview does not
provide an adequate forum to
determine a candidate's
credibility, nor can it be the
basis for such a damaging pre
supposition. While the Daily
maintains Jon Blum to be a "re
markably energetic and
articulate candidate," his rec
ord of dorm and campus-gov
ernment involvement is
greviously blank. Cynthia Ellis
however, shows a strong record

of dorm involvement and re
spect, including editor of the
dorm newspaper, winner of the
USF Philhistorian Invitational
Debate Tournament, and most
significantly, Branner dorm
president.
Your mistake, in failing to re
search and report such obvious
ly relevant facts, has soured
your credibility to a once trust
ing readership. The ir
responsibility of a single en
dorsement reveals an
amateurish lack of integrity re
flecting poorly upon all other
candidate editorials.

Back SPA
We would like to urge that stu
dents vote for the fee
assessment for the Stanford
Progressive Allience (SPA) on
April 15-16. SPA has been acitve
since the fall of 1980 pulling to
gether a large number of or
ganizations on the campus and
promoting their activities, as
well as organizing workshops
and educational meetings
around the economic and social
issues of concern to Stanford
students.
For the first time in many
years, faculty, students and
staff were brought together in
these discussions. In winter
quarter these groups, through
SPA and with the help of the
Dickinson Symposium Fund and
SCOPE, sponsored a series of
symposia on issues crucial to
the future of our society.
We feel that these activities,
bringing together students and
the local community, should be
supported by the student body,
and we urge vou to do so.

SPA rip-off
Leave it to the Stanford
Progressive Alliance to ask for
a handout in the form of a fee
assessment in the upcoming
election. Ironically, this comes
from the self-same people who
pride themselves on having or
ganized an "election rejection"
rally to protest the "illusion of
electoral choice" (Lighty and
Ansell, Daily, Apr. 9). Aside
from an apparent talent for self
serving hypocrisy, one wonders
what is so special about SPA
that it should be singled out for
special consideration, apart
from other partisan political
groups on campus such as the
Stanford Libertarians, the Stan
ford Republicans, or the Com
munist Revolutionary Youth
Brigade?
Perhaps it is a mark of how
stale "progressive" ideas have
become that SPA is attempting
to carve out an official niche for
itself in the Stanford estab
lishment. Indeed, since the elec
tion, progressives have increas
ingly emerged as the leading
apoiogists for bureaucratic sub
sidies. But then, as Tom
Hayden. Jerry Rubin, et al.,
have been demonstrating re
cently. rip-offs are easier to ac
complish working within the
system. P a l e Qj er j n g er
