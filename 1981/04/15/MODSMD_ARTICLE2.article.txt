# University and union battle over bulletins
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar 
In a battle to project the ultimate
results of unionization, Stanford's
clerical workers are being assaulted
by the claims and counter-claims of
both the University and the union or
ganizers.
The University has elaborated on its
opposition to unionization as the solu
tion to the problems of Stanford's
clerical workers in a series of bulle
tins issued since the beginning of the
quarter.
And a union spokesman, saying that
University is fighting to keep the
workers from gaining power, called
the bulletins statistically misleading
and reactionary.
There have been four bulletins so
far, concerning local salary levels,
collective bargaining, general union
membership rules, and strikes, re

spectively.
The bulletins are designed to allow
the employees to "make an informed
choice on the basis of factual informa
tion," according to Felix Barthelemy,
Stanford's manager of employee rela
tions.
But Michael Baratz, spokesman for
Local 715, the chapter which would
represent the clericals if they vote for
unionization, said the bulletins are de
signed to portray the union as some
thing "separate and different from the
workers."
Baratz said the University is being
deliberately misleading when they
claim in the latest bulletin that the
union "called a strike at the Univer
sity in 1974."
"Workers voted on whether or not to
go out on strike — one isn't (taken out)
on strike," Baratz said. He em

phasized that unions are "the most
democratic institutions on earth" in
that they determine their actions
through the votes of their members.
The latest election bulletin also says
that when the Service Employees In
ternational Union (SEIU), the parent
organization of Local 715, calls a
strike, it "means that it is likely that
you will be asked to join in and honor
its picket lines."
The bulletin warns clericals that
during strikes, "THE MAJOR IM
PACT FALLS ON YOU." It says that
during strikes clericals would lose
pay, are not eligible for unemploy
ment benefits, and might be per
manently replaced.
Honoring picket lines is one of the
basic principles of organized labor,
according to Baratz. He said it is rare
that workers go out on strike for mon

ey alone and due to the union's sur
vival fund he has never known anyone
to "lose a home or a car."
The third election bulletin concen
trates on the responsibilities involved
in union membership. It points out
that if the union is chosen as the sole
bargaining unit for clericals here,
each would have to pay 1 percent of
their gross salary to Local 715, wheth
er they joined the union or not.
This is another attempt at exag
geration, according to Baratz. Over
all, a clerical worker earning $1000 per
month would have to pay $10 dollars a
month in dues, he said, a small price
for the increased salaries a union
could negotiate.
The bulletin warns that employees
can be fired for not paying union dues
and says that this insures "SECUR
ITY FOR THE UNION - NOT THE
EMPLOYEE; it is NOT JOB SECUR
ITY."
"A union is security for the work
ers, and the more workers who join
the union make its negotiated con
tracts stronger," Baratz replied He
repeated that the attempt to dist
inguish between the union and the
workers is "just trash written by evil
human beings to scare people. " There
would not be "20 million people in
unions" if they did not benefit work
ers, Baratz said.
The bulletin says that the non-mem
bers are subject to but cannot vote on
union contracts, fines, dues, fees
assessments, election of officers, or
strikes It also says that members can be fined for "dis
loyalty to the union" or other actions which disobey union
rules, such as "working when the union has called a
strike."
As an example the bulletin says that SEIU "recently
subjected 19 employees to a union trial and fined them for
working when the union called a strike. "
Baratz said he could not remember any such case in the
past seven years.
This did occur after a strike against the Dameron Hospi
tal Association in Stockton, last year, but the bulletin fails
to mention that the fines were dismissed after a National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB)arbitrator decided that
they were "in contravention of the amnesty provision" ne
gotiated in the strike settlement.
The second of the four election bulletins describes the
process of collective bargaining, pointing out that the
union can only achieve changes in the clericals' salaries
and benefits if the University agrees.
The first bulletin focused on salaries negotiated by Lo
cal 715 in the local area The bulletin attempts to match
Stanford's job classifications with those in the area. As the
bulletin says, "actual job titles differ but job descriptions
have been matched."
The comparisons show that with the proposed minimum
12 percent increase, Stanford's salary range next year will
have a higher upper level than those of clerical employees
of San Mateo County, Redwood City and Palo Alto. The
comparison also compares Stanford salaries with salary
levels in Santa Clara County for past years, but projected
levels were not included as that county's contract has not
been renegotiated.
An OSOC newsletter argues that there are several flaws
in that comparison. Primarily, it said that job classi
fications in one area cannot be matched with those in "a
totally different setting or from one employer to another.''
It also argues that the statistics are misleading as benefits
are not included in the comparison. For example, the
newsletter says, employees in Santa Clara County have
their entire social security taxes paid by that county,
which amounts to 6.13 percent of their income.
"Benefits are a different question," according to Rose
mary Monroe, Stanford's assistant manager in compensa
tion. The first bulletin was just a comparison of actual
wages, she said, as a study of benefits would require much
more research.
President Donald Kennedy said recently that the Uni
versity's opposition does not "relate to salary and bene
fits." The University is specifically opposed to
unionization due to past experience with the United Stan
ford Employees Local 715, which represents the technical
workers on campus. He said that they have contributed to
a "tense and hostile" atmosphere on campus, "one that is
especially damaging to the working environment in facul
ty and staff offices."
Baratz said that he did not want to get into a "flying
memo fight with the University" despite the fact that the
bulletins are "statistically not correct. "

ford Employees Local 715, which represents the technical
workers on campus. He said that they have contributed to
a "tense and hostile" atmosphere on campus, "one that is
especially damaging to the working environment in facul
ty and staff offices."
Baratz said that he did not want to get into a "flying
memo fight with the University" despite the fact that the
bulletins are "statistically not correct. "
In a battle to project the ultimate
results of unionization, Stanford's
clerical workers are being assaulted
by the claims and counter-claims of
both the University and the union or
ganizers.
The University has elaborated on its
opposition to unionization as the solu
tion to the problems of Stanford's
clerical workers in a series of bulle
tins issued since the beginning of the
quarter.
And a union spokesman, saying that
University is fighting to keep the
workers from gaining power, called
the bulletins statistically misleading
and reactionary.
There have been four bulletins so
far, concerning local salary levels,
collective bargaining, general union
membership rules, and strikes, re

spectively.
The bulletins are designed to allow
the employees to "make an informed
choice on the basis of factual informa
tion," according to Felix Barthelemy,
Stanford's manager of employee rela
tions.
But Michael Baratz, spokesman for
Local 715, the chapter which would
represent the clericals if they vote for
unionization, said the bulletins are de
signed to portray the union as some
thing "separate and different from the
workers."
Baratz said the University is being
deliberately misleading when they
claim in the latest bulletin that the
union "called a strike at the Univer
sity in 1974."
"Workers voted on whether or not to
go out on strike — one isn't (taken out)
on strike," Baratz said. He em

phasized that unions are "the most
democratic institutions on earth" in
that they determine their actions
through the votes of their members.
The latest election bulletin also says
that when the Service Employees In
ternational Union (SEIU), the parent
organization of Local 715, calls a
strike, it "means that it is likely that
you will be asked to join in and honor
its picket lines."
The bulletin warns clericals that
during strikes, "THE MAJOR IM
PACT FALLS ON YOU." It says that
during strikes clericals would lose
pay, are not eligible for unemploy
ment benefits, and might be per
manently replaced.
Honoring picket lines is one of the
basic principles of organized labor,
according to Baratz. He said it is rare
that workers go out on strike for mon

ey alone and due to the union's sur
vival fund he has never known anyone
to "lose a home or a car."
The third election bulletin concen
trates on the responsibilities involved
in union membership. It points out
that if the union is chosen as the sole
bargaining unit for clericals here,
each would have to pay 1 percent of
their gross salary to Local 715, wheth
er they joined the union or not.
This is another attempt at exag
geration, according to Baratz. Over
all, a clerical worker earning $1000 per
month would have to pay $10 dollars a
month in dues, he said, a small price
for the increased salaries a union
could negotiate.
The bulletin warns that employees
can be fired for not paying union dues
and says that this insures "SECUR
ITY FOR THE UNION - NOT THE
EMPLOYEE; it is NOT JOB SECUR
ITY."
"A union is security for the work
ers, and the more workers who join
the union make its negotiated con
tracts stronger," Baratz replied He
repeated that the attempt to dist
inguish between the union and the
workers is "just trash written by evil
human beings to scare people. " There
would not be "20 million people in
unions" if they did not benefit work
ers, Baratz said.
The bulletin says that the non-mem
bers are subject to but cannot vote on
union contracts, fines, dues, fees
assessments, election of officers, or
strikes It also says that members can be fined for "dis
loyalty to the union" or other actions which disobey union
rules, such as "working when the union has called a
strike."
As an example the bulletin says that SEIU "recently
subjected 19 employees to a union trial and fined them for
working when the union called a strike. "
Baratz said he could not remember any such case in the
past seven years.
This did occur after a strike against the Dameron Hospi
tal Association in Stockton, last year, but the bulletin fails
to mention that the fines were dismissed after a National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB)arbitrator decided that
they were "in contravention of the amnesty provision" ne
gotiated in the strike settlement.
The second of the four election bulletins describes the
process of collective bargaining, pointing out that the
union can only achieve changes in the clericals' salaries
and benefits if the University agrees.
The first bulletin focused on salaries negotiated by Lo
cal 715 in the local area The bulletin attempts to match
Stanford's job classifications with those in the area. As the
bulletin says, "actual job titles differ but job descriptions
have been matched."
The comparisons show that with the proposed minimum
12 percent increase, Stanford's salary range next year will
have a higher upper level than those of clerical employees
of San Mateo County, Redwood City and Palo Alto. The
comparison also compares Stanford salaries with salary
levels in Santa Clara County for past years, but projected
levels were not included as that county's contract has not
been renegotiated.
An OSOC newsletter argues that there are several flaws
in that comparison. Primarily, it said that job classi
fications in one area cannot be matched with those in "a
totally different setting or from one employer to another.''
It also argues that the statistics are misleading as benefits
are not included in the comparison. For example, the
newsletter says, employees in Santa Clara County have
their entire social security taxes paid by that county,
which amounts to 6.13 percent of their income.
"Benefits are a different question," according to Rose
mary Monroe, Stanford's assistant manager in compensa
tion. The first bulletin was just a comparison of actual
wages, she said, as a study of benefits would require much
more research.
President Donald Kennedy said recently that the Uni
versity's opposition does not "relate to salary and bene
fits." The University is specifically opposed to
unionization due to past experience with the United Stan
ford Employees Local 715, which represents the technical
workers on campus. He said that they have contributed to
a "tense and hostile" atmosphere on campus, "one that is
especially damaging to the working environment in facul
