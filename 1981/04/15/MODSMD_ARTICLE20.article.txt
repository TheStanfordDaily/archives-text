## Much-admired hostages reunited 
### Los Angeles Times 
As the 53 former American
hostages in Iran gathered at the
posh Greenbrier resort hotel in
West Virginia yesterday for
their first reunion since their
tumultuous return to the United
States in January, they still
found themselves the objects of
almost unremitting adulation
and magnanimity.
Some arrived freshly tanned
from all-expense paid vacations
in Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Is
lands and Puerto Rico.
Six had stories to tell of hav
ing thrown out the first ball at
major league baseball openers,
and all of them have been given
free lifetime baseball passes,
something not even a president
receives.
All have been bombarded
with free offers of everything
from record albums and theater
tickets to Pucci ties, Vidal
Sassoon hair washes and cuts, a
supply of blue jeans for the next
five years, rent-a-cars, luggage
and much more.
Small potatoes
But that is small potatoes
compared to the hundreds of
thousands of dollars in book
deals, magazine articles and
speaking engagements that
have gone, or will go, to many of
the American men and women
who spent 444 days as hostages
in Iran until their Jan. 20 re
lease.
The Department of State and
armed forces have been inun
dated with requests for ap
pearances by the former
hostages. "I feel like a damned
social secretary," one Pentagon
official complained.
Even their stay at the 700-
room Greenbrier this week is
free. When the management
heard that the White Sulphur
Springs resort had been selected
by the State Dept. for the site of
final medical checkups and
debriefings, "they were de

lighted" and decided to pick up
the tab for the $150-a-day rooms
and meals, a spokesman said.
Many of the former hostages
clearly were stunned by the pub
lic outpouring of largesse, and
even concerned.
'Mixed feelings'
"I have some mixed feel
ings," Barry Rosen, the former
press attache in the American
embassy in Iran, told the Los
Angeles Times. "I don't look at
it as a moralistic thing, whether
to take or not to take. I don't
know. . . my life is so hectic, I
don't even look at half the stuff
that comes in.
Richard Morefield, of San Di

ego, who was U.S. consul gener
al in Iran, suggested that he too
was grappling with the atten
tion.
"I think the line to draw (on
gifts) is a judgment line," he
said. "It would be physically
impossible to go to all the places
and yet, to not graciously listen
would be wrong, too."
Most of the time on the lec
ture circuit, said Rosen, he re
ceives travel expenses but few
honorariums, or fees.
But his book, co-authored
with his wife, is another story.
Julian Bach, Rosen's New York
based literary agent, said the
deal "approaching six figures"

he nailed down the first week of
this month involved selling the
book to Doubleday and Co., and
magazine rights to (inod House
keeping. With writer George
Feiffer putting together the
final draft, the Rosens' book is
scheduled for publication in the
spring of 1982.
The only other former
hostage known to have a book
deal is Richard Queen, of New
York, the embassy's vice con
sul, released by the Iranians in
July 1980 because of illness.
Queens's book, Inside and Out,
written with Patricia Hass, is
aimed for publication late this
summer.

"I think the line to draw (on
gifts) is a judgment line," he
said. "It would be physically
impossible to go to all the places
and yet, to not graciously listen
would be wrong, too."
Most of the time on the lec
ture circuit, said Rosen, he re
ceives travel expenses but few
honorariums, or fees.
But his book, co-authored
with his wife, is another story.
Julian Bach, Rosen's New York
based literary agent, said the
deal "approaching six figures"

he nailed down the first week of
this month involved selling the
book to Doubleday and Co., and
magazine rights to (inod House
keeping. With writer George
Feiffer putting together the
final draft, the Rosens' book is
scheduled for publication in the
spring of 1982.
The only other former
hostage known to have a book
deal is Richard Queen, of New
York, the embassy's vice con
sul, released by the Iranians in
July 1980 because of illness.
Queens's book, Inside and Out,
written with Patricia Hass, is
aimed for publication late this
summer.
