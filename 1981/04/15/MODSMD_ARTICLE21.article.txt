# Opponents 'full of hot air'
## Senator discusses candidacy 
### Los Angeles Times 
Culver City, Calif. — All those
people lining up to run against
him, says Sen. S.I. Hayakawa,
are "soft in the head — they
don't know what they're doing."
The 75-year-old Republican,
who has said repeatedly that he
will seek re-election next year,
said his prospective challengers
are "full of hot air" if they think
he will drop out of the race.
Hayakawa told a California
Scholastic Press Association
news conference in Culver City
Monday: "I hope the list (of
challengers) grows to 100.
"The more the merrier. Then
they'll knock each other off and
I'll win."
Because Hayakawa has
shown poorly in the polls and be
cause of his age, an unusually
large field of Republicans has
been assembling to challenge
him in the 1982 party primary.
Those considering the race
are Reps. Barry Goldwater, Jr.
and Paul (Pete) McCloskey;
Maureen Reagan, daughter of

President Ronald Reagan;
Loyola Law School Dean Theo
dore Bruinsma and former
State Sen. Dennis Carpenter.
As if to illustrate his fitness
for the race, Hayakawa told the
student journalists how he spent
Sunday scuba diving near
Avalon, on Catalina Island.
In the telling, he struggled to
think of the name of the "or
ange-colored" fish he saw.
And later in the hour-long ses
sion, he charged that Northern
California olive growers had
suffered a $500 million loss last
year because the Immigration
and Naturalization Service had
deported 500 undocumented
workers just before harvest
time and growers contended
there were not enough workers
to bring in the crop.
What he meant to say, an aide
explained later, was that
$500,000 was the estimated loss.
When asked to explain his phi
losophy, Hayakawa said, "I be
lieve in the utmost freedom for
the individual, including the

right to make mistakes."
He scoffed at child-proof drug
bottles — "as if parents aren't
able to take care of their own
children" — and said that in
trying to protect children,
"they've made it so a 65-year
old arthritic can't open their
damn things."
Hayakawa conceded that his
legislative record thus far has
been "essentially weak," but
explained this is because he has
been a freshman Republican in
a Democrat-controlled Senate.
Now that his party reigns, he
said things will get better.
