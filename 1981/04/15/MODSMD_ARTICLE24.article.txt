# Secret Service to build U.S. intelligence

### Washington Post 
Washington — If the Secret
Service were given twice as
much money as it gets now to
protect the president, how
would it use the extra funds?
Secret Service Director H.

Stuart Knight was asked that
question, a tantalizing one for
any federal manager, at an ap
propriations hearing on Capitol
Hill last week. After a long,
thoughtful silence, he said, "My
response would be, in some way,
to try to enhance our in
telligence capability."

News analysis

It is doubtful that the Secret
Service's $178 million annual
budget will be doubled, as Rep.
Clarence Miller (R-Ohio)
hypothesized when he asked
Knight that question, but it does
seem likely that Congress —in
its zeal to do something in re
sponse to the March 30 shooting
of President Ronald Reagan

will do what it can to help
Knight increase his agents' abil
ity to gather information about
individuals and groups the ser
vice thinks might pose a threat
to the president.
Flurry of new laws
Congress has reacted to the
assassination attempt with a
flurry of legislation and a flood
of suggestions for the president
and his protectors. The ideas
range from the call by Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.) for a
new effort at gun-control legis
lation to the recommendation
by Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.)
that Reagan wear a military
flak jacket whenever he goes
outside ("I know these jackets
are bulky," Pressler wrote the
president, "but it is essential we

take all steps to protect. . .")
But gun control seems
doomed, as usual, to be lobbied
to death, and it is likely that the
only legislation in the whole
crop of post-shooting bills that
will become law is a measure
toughening penalties for anyone
who shoots the president. The
experts say it is doubtful that
the deranged people who tend to
shoot at presidents would be de
terred by the threat of penalty.
The man charged with shooting
Reagan, John Hinckley, wrote
beforehand that he almost ex
pected to die in his assassination
attempt — but he went ahead.
And so Congress and the ex
ecutive branch have focused on
domestic intelligence as an area
in which changes can be made.
