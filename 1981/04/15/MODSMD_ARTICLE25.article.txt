# Football practice starts, without old No. 28
## It's only spring but hits still sting The 						Stanford Daily Sports 
### Sally Jenkins 
Stanford spring football prac
tice opened Monday, and
school was definitely in session
The Cardinals were in full
pads, as if there was a chill in
the air and USC or Cal was
marching towards the stadium.
Ex-Cardinal wide receiver Ken
Margerum, on the other hand,
strolled along the sidelines in a
t-shirt and track shorts
"Wish you were out there 0 " a
friend asked, as two Cardinals
collided and almost knocked
eachother out.
"No." he shook his head and
laughed, watching the players
struggle to their feet. "No. I re
ally don't."
Margerum. owner of the rec
ord book in several areas and
next in the long line of alumni
who have gone on to catch foot
balls for a pro team, was out of
place.
Younger players spat out dirt
or stood around the water
siphon, while some older ex-
Cardinals milled around watch
ing various squads. Margerum
chatted with members of both
groups, caught in between.
The sideline was a pro team in
itself, as Cardinal alumni had
apparently come from all over
the country to see some old
friends and work out in the
weight room. Some of the famil
iar faces:
Guy Benjamin, quarterback
for Stanford in the 1978 Liberty
Bowl, now with the New Orleans
Saints.
Turk Schonert, John Elway's
predecessor now a back up quar
terback for the Cincinatti
Bengals.
Chuck Evans, 1979 team cap
tain. defensive lineman for the
San Francisco 49ers.
Andre Hines. offensive line
man for the Seattle Seahawks.

James Lofton, wide receiver
for the Green Bay Packers,
needs no introduction
All of the above mentioned
teams, along with the New York
Jets. Oakland Raiders, Pit
tsburgh Steelers and Dallas
Cowboys have expressed in
terest in Margerum.
Until the pro draft rolls
around, however, he is essen-

tially just another shiftless sen
ior He can be found at a local
beer hall, The Oasis, most eve
nings. He looks for courses with
titles like "The World of Dis
ney: Past and Present," and
dodges paper deadlines.
He spends the rest of his time
like most other Stanford ath
letes about to turn pro, in the
weight room, and generally
keeping in shape. "I never let
myself get out of shape after the
season, so it's actually not that

hard " he said.
Margerum may not care to
wear a Cardinal jersey these
days, but he does not seem over
ly eager to leave the general vi
cinity He favors Oakland Raid
er shades of silver and black be
cause it would mean that he
could remain near campus,
among other things.
In fact, he favors the

Northern California area so
much that he passed up a free
trip to New York for a Jets
tryout. '.'The Raiders was my
best tryout." he said. "I jumped
higher for them than any other
team."
He sat down in the grass and
stretched out his legs, sighing in
a rather self-satisfied way as he
took in the mayhem around him.
It was a different kind of
spring practice, maybe a dif
ferent practice in general, with

no reminders of the quiet days
when Bill Walsh (head coach of
the San Francisco 49ers) pa
tiently explained a play.
Coaches screamed, whooped
and hollered, paced out plays,
motioned frantically. Those
who didn't have something to do
for a moment or two stood with
arms crossed and legs spread
wide, looking important and ev-

ery bit as in shape as the
players.
Athletic director Andy Geiger
had his own arms crossed as he
watched the action intently and
looked most important of all,
probably a result of the suit and
tie.
A Stanford baseball cap did
detract from the image a bit,
however.
The pro players chatted with
friends, answered questions
about their carreers, discussed

the action on the field.
The current Cardinals, of
course, were busy trying to
break some legs, or wondering
what in God's name they were
doing in pads the first day of
spring practice.
So, it appears that

Margerum's departure may
coincide with a shift of em
phasis in the football program.
The image of Stanford football
teams and players like
Margerum as flaky but charm
ing, accurate or otherwise,
seems to be out.
What's in was clearly in
dicated by the intensity of the
day's workout. Bystanders
began taking bets on how many
players would be injured by the
end of the week as at least two

players were observed leaving
the field after being shaken up.
The numbers ranged from five
to seven.
The addition of defensive co
ordinator Jack Harbaugh to the
staff last season was an indica
tion in itself. Harbaugh pre-

viously coached defensive backs
at the University of Michigan
for seven years, and was in
volved in the Wolverines three
straight Rose Bowl ap
pearances, from 1977 to 1979.
His team ranked 12th in NCAA
defense in 1979.
Harbaugh and Wiggin took a
no-nonsense squad onto the field
yesterday afternoon. They had
obviously made their point clear
as shouts like "Get eye to eye,
eye to eye!" and "Get excited

damn it, lets start hopping
around out there!" came from
players and coaches alike.
Wiggin has 42 lettermen back
from last season's team, 15 of
which were starters, seven on
offense and eight on defense.
The workouts are scheduled to
last five weeks, with the
Cardinals practicing from 3:15
p.m. from 5:15 p.m. Mondays,
Wednesdays and Thursdays,
and from 10 a.m. to noon Satur
days.
He stated his aims and inten
tions best when he said, "This
year, we come into spring prac
tice with a stronger and more
meaningful knowledge of our
players."
"Our goals this spring deal
with the technical and physical
side of football. We're excited
about these five weeks, because
it gives us a chance to put some
things to test."
The "tests" seem to include
everything from lineup shuffles
to pain thresholds. The
Cardinals ranked no. 1 in the Pa
cific-10 last season, but a dismal
no. 8 in defense, and something
certainly has to be done about
that.
Lineup experiments include
the possible switches of senior
Steve Ballinger from defensive
to offensive tackle, sophomore
Pat Mitchell from offensive
tackle to inside linebacker, and
junior Mike Dotterer from half
back to fullback.
One can't help wondering if
Margerum might not return to
watch practice as a pro and do
what Lofton did Monday after
noon. A horn blew signalling a
new drill. As the Cardinals
moved past him Lofton almost
fell in line.

Halfback John Carrol chased soccer balls at the first spring practice session held Monday afternoon, proving that the emphasis is definitely shifting within the pro
gram. Fifteen starters return to the team, seven on offense, eight on defense.
