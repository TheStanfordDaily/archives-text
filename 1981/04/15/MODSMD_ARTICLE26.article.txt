# Bicyclists win twice
## 
### Rich Swent 
The Stanford bicycling team
took first place in two races
sponsored by UC-Davis and Sac
ramento State last Saturday and
Sunday respectively.
The Davis race was on a flat
course with six 90 degree turns,
and a stiff wind. The Cardinal
women were up to their usual
standards, as Liz Newberry won
her third race in a row, and
Margi Bethke took third.
Stanford got off to a poor start
in the men's Novice race, with
only one of 10 riders finishing.
Most of them were eliminated
from being lapped, but a flat
tire, a mechanical problem and
a crash also contributed.
The Expert Men's race set the
pattern for the weekend. Paul
Middlestadt found himself in a
breakaway race with four other
riders, including one from Foot
hill College.
The remaining Stanford and
Foothill riders sucessfully
blocked the pack from chasing

the break, and Middlestadt un
leashed his sprint at the end to
give the race to the Cardinals.
The flat oval course at Sacra
mento resulted in large group
finishes. Dave Huntley provided
most of the scoring for Stanford,
winning several sprints and
eventually taking first place.
In the women's race, Bethke
broke away with a rider from
City College of San Francisco
and took second place. New
berry, in spite of a minor me
chanical accident, took seventh.
Middlestadt was again the
story in the men's expert race.
He repeatedly won the sprints in
the early going, with teammate
George Hermann in two several
times.
Then, as at Davis, he got into
a break which included a Foot
hill rider. Teammates again
provided effective blocking, and
he took another race, giving
Stanford a wide margin of vic
tory for the day.
