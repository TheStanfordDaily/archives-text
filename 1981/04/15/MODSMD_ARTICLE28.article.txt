# Chapman takes 13th at AIAW's

### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's freshman gymnastics standout Merilyn Chapman
placed 13th at the AIAW National Championships held last Friday
and Saturday at the University of Utah. Although her 35.65 all
around total was more than a full point off of her school record of
36.80 (set Feb. 7 at Oregon State, the eighth highest mark in the
country at the time), her finish just outside of the top 10 is the
highest yet for a Cardinal woman gymnast.
Without a slip on balance beam, at least a .5 of a point deduction,
Chapman would have stood a good chance of finishing among the top
six or seven individuals. Unfortunately, the very closely-matched,
high-scoring talent assembled at the nationals penalizes the
slightest mistakes, costing a gymnast a loss of several places in the
standings for differences of mere tenths of points.
Hailing from Danville and Monta Vista High School, Chapman
was the top seed going into nationals, and equalled that pre-meet
ranking by winding up as the top at-large competitor in the individ
ual portion of the AIAWs.
Besides her success in Utah, Chapman will have at least one more
major event of the 1980-81 season, having qualified for the "All-
Americas All" competition. This is a "low-pressure" meet for the
top 16 all-around gymnasts from the nationals. Oregon State is serv
ing as host for the event later this month.
National-level success is not new for Chapman — among her
credits are the 1978 U.S. Junior Elite Championships title and two
national all-around championships. Perhaps her most dist
inguishing accomplishment is the fact that she was the first Ameri
can gymnast to upset Russian competitors at a meet in the U.S.S.R.
