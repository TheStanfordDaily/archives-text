# Speaker supports oil price increases

Oil price increases are necessary to
ease the transition from an oil-based
world economy to a new era of diverse
energy sources and to facilitate the
development of Third World OPEC
countries, according to Fadhil Al-
Chalabi, Deputy Secretary General of
the Oil Producing and Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
"I believe that what OPEC has done
in the matter of pricing, in either the
first major price change of 1973 or the
second major change in price last year
and the year before, was reflecting a
long-term trend of oil scarcity," Al-
Chalabi said "This action was neces
sary to correct the imbalance between
the demand of oil and the availability
of oil because rising prices made it
possible for consumers to reduce con
sumption and conserve more."
Al-Chalabi explained yesterday to
an audience of about 100 people at a
Bechtel International Center luncheon
why he thought oil-producing coun
tries needed to set high prices to pro

long the life of their oil reserves.
"It is imperative for these countries
to have the lifespan of their reserves
prolonged as long as necessary to
(make the transition) from a state of
underdevelopment, of dependence on
one commodity, to another state of a
diversified economy where oil plays a
less predominant role â€” and this will
take time," he said.
Al-Chalabi commented that before
the OPEC organization took control of
pricing, major oil companies de
pressed oil prices and dramatically
shortened the lifespan of Middle
Eastern oil supplies.
Oil funds were needed on a long
term basis to finance the development
of human resources and the acquisi
tion of technology and equipment in
the OPEC underdeveloped countries
where the possibility of creating other
sources of income is now severely lim
ited, he explained.
He also said price increases would
lower world consumer demand and en
courage conservation, a change he
considers necessary to lessen the im
balance between the supply and the
demand for oil. If OPEC sold only half
of the 28 million barrels currently pro
duced, it would still have enough mon
ey to finance its economic develop
ment, he said.
"Only since the price change in 1973
has the growth in consumption of oil in
the West been totally arrested," Al-
Chalabi said
Oil demand in Western Europe has
actually decreased in 1973 and de
creased again by 6 percent with the
major price increase of 1980, he
added

In the question and answer period
following the talk, an Iranian student
challenged Al-Chalabi's comments re
garding OPEC countries' need to pre
serve their resources. The student
asked why human and economic re
sources were being destroyed in the
war between Iran and Iraq. Al-
Chalabi, formerly Director General of
Oil Affairs for Iraq, said he would not
comment because he was speaking as
a representative of OPEC, not Iraq.
