# Aids in Stanford's victory over UC- Irvine
## Bondurant knows what it takes to win 
### Ivan Maisel 
He doesn't have the fluid strokes of a Scott Davis, nor
the frantic energy of a Jim Gurfein His Gumby-like
body looks like it was ordered extra on arms and legs,
hold the torso. His walk — shoulders hunched, leaning
forward — makes him look old beyond his years.
But put him on a tennis court and he is transformed
almost magically. The long legs move quickly to the
net, the arms range from one side of the court to the
other, making him one of the best volleyers in college
tennis.
And none of this takes into account the tennis game
that has developed from his neck up, where many a
match is won or lost. To say that Scott Bondurant is a
tough competitor is to say that Wimbledon is just anoth
er stop on the tour.
The scowling face is a mask of concentration. Blow
ing on his fingers, he casts his eyes downward, bounc
ing on his toes as he walks to the back line to serve. He
doesn't argue on calls; he rarely yells or shows any
emotion whatsoever. He goes out, plays his tennis and
walks off the court.
And Bondurant usually walks off the court a winner.
The junior ran his dual match record to 10-1 yester
day, beating Chris Emery 6-1, 4-6,6-2 at No. 3 singles as
Stanford (11-0) whipped UC-Irvine 8-1 at Stanford Ten
nis Stadium.
Bondurant's victory wasn't pretty, just workman
like. When he needed the point, he won it. Of 12 3-all
points in the no-ad match, he won 10 of them. That's
something that keeps him near and dear to coach Dick
Gould's heart.
"He's one of the best competitors I've ever had,"
Gould said. "His overall match record is phenomenal.
He's really tough, really tough. He's the catalyst. He's
not spectacular ; he's the guy on the team that gets the
job done. He doesn't score 32 points, but he's the first
one down the floor and he leads the team in assists. Ev
ery championship team has one."
After the match, the pseudo-basketball star sat in the
tennis office, an icebag on the bursitis-stricken right
shoulder that has troubled him on-and-off since his
freshman year.

"A lot of it is that I play fairly aggressively The key
to'winning big points is in going for it instead of letting
the other guy take the initiative." Bondurant said. "Ob
viously there's some luck in there, too "
Not according to ex-teammate Andy Chase, one of
Bondurant's best friends, in terms of being successful
when it's close. Scott is incredible. He really bears
down and plays extra aggressive. He just wins close
matches."
Gould attributed a great deal ot Bondurant's success
to that aggressive attitude. "He puts an awful lot of
pressure on the opponent because he's always on the at
tack. The player has to make the shot to beat him "
The on-court steeliness changes when Bondurant
steps off the court. The 21-year-old is quiet, soft-spoken
and almost always has an enigmatic smile on his face
However, once he begins competing, the mask of con
centration reappears. You see. Bondurant likes win
ning
"He never loses, at cards especially. How obnox
ious!,." said a teasing John Corse, himself a 6-3.6-0 win
ner over Mark Ramos in No. 6 singles. "If there's an
edge, he takes it."
"I'm competitive. I like competing in general,
playing games It's a fun thing to do," Bondurant said.
"When you don't have that much talent, you've gotta
make it somewhere. I just try to concentrate harder. "
The self-effacing crack about talent doesn't wash
with the guys who know him best. "He has no
weakness." Chase said. "At 3-all you try to serve into
the body or the backhand: you pull out your best serve.
But against Scott you're not going to get a quick point
because he gets the return so low on both sides. There's
no weak spot no matter where you hit."
It's a talent Bondurant has been developing since he
was seven, when he began playing in his then-home of
Rye. New York. At the age of 11. his family moved to
Winter Park. Florida. The balmy weather made tennis
a year-round affair, even taking precedence over
basketball for the 6-foot-2,158-pounder. Tennis was also
a family affair.
"My mom just won the national clay court doubles
championship in 45-and-over," said the proud son.
"She's psyched."

Above all else, his coach knows Bondurant's worth as
an infighter. "I never had a better team player asfar as
being a competitor," Gould said "It's a tribute to his
leadership abilities that his teammates have elected
him co-captain the last two years. He's obviously a win
ner
Ample proof of that came last May in the NCAA team
championship match. Gould's Cards were down 3-1 to
Cal. and Bondurant was down a set to the Bears' Phil
Lehnhoff However, Bondurant surged forward to win
the match in a third-set tiebreaker, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (5-3).
Stanlord was on its way to its sixth NCAA title.
"There was a lot of guts on both his part and mine,"
Bondurant said after that match. "Guts are my philoso
phy of life."
NOTES — The team is a bundle of aches and pains
after the weekend's grueling wins over USC and UCLA
In addition to Bondurant's shoulder, Mike Falberg has
a slight groin muscle pull in his right leg
In No. 1 singles, Tim Mayotte methodically beat Jim
Snyder 6-4, 6-2, staying at the baseline instead of using
his natural serve-and-volley game. "He was so far back
that when I went to the net, his strokes would dip at my
feet,' Mayotte said. "I'm looking for confidence in my
backcourt game. I just can't depend on my serve-and
volley game all the time."
Scott Davis took veteran Mark Edmondson to the
brink of upset before bowing 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 in the opening
round of the $175,000 Jack Kramer Open in Los Angeles.
He will back in the starting lineup for Stanford Friday
against Arizona State Friday at 1:30 p.m. at the Tennis
Stadium Arizona will be here the following day. also at
1:30 p.m.
Jeff Arons continues to slump. After losing No. 5 sin
gles 6-4, 7-6 (5-3) to Rob Nelson, his fourth straight de
feat, Arons slammed his racket on top of a fencepost. It
looked like the racket in Bubba Smith's and Dick
