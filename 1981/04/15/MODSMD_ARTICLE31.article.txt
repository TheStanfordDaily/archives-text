# Cardinal nine dumps St.Mary's
## 
### Steve Odell 
The Stanford baseball team received a gift from visiting St
Mary's yesterday, and it came packaged as a balk which
forced in the winning run, in the Cards' 7-6 victory at Sunken
Diamond
The Cards found themselves tied in the bottom of the eighth
after St. Mary's had put a notch in the scoreboard in the top of
the inning. But that was before Mike Toothman took things
into his own hands.
Toothman started, fueled and completed the one-run rally
singlehandedly for the Cards, scoring the go-ahead run in the
last of the eighth. The junior rightfielder singled, stole sec
ond, advanced to third on a wild pitch, and then waltzed home
when the less-than-controversial balk was called.
With two outs and Dave Meier at the plate, St. Mary's
pitcher Ben Snyder, the ace of the staff, was pitching from a
full wind-up. Halfway through his motion, though, the St.
Mary's catcher stood up to warn Snyder that he should pitch
out of a stretch with Toothman leering at home from third,
and when he did, Snyder took his foot off the rubber.
Bingo, Toothman scores.
Stanford fell behind right away as St. Mary's jumped on
starter Lee Cline for three runs in the first inning. The Cards
closed the gap to one in the bottom half, when Phil Wilson
knocked home two Cardinal runs with a two-out double.
St. Mary's increased their lead to two in the second, but
they were only too obliged to let Stanford tie it up. The Cards
knotted it at 4-all in the last half of the second, but did it
without any hits. Instead, they thought they d let St. Mary's
do their dirty work, using three walks, a sacrifice fly, and a
St. Mary's error.
Cline started for the Cards, but lasted only three innings.
Bob Boatman came on in relief, and did a superb job, giving
up only one run,(and that unearned) and two hits, over the
course of the next four frames. Junior righthander Mike Sul
livan (2-0) pitched the eighth and ninth innings to mop things
up and pick up the win.
With some thanks due to St. Mary's.

Phil Wilson didn't catch this pop-up (teammate Dave Meier did)but he did grab his hat during
Stanford's 7-6 victory over St. Mary's yesterday at Sunken Diamond. Wilson was 2-for-5 with a
home run for the Cards.
