Weinberger would delay talks
Washington — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
said yesterday that he is opposed to any arms control talks
with the Soviet Union until the Russians, "at the very min
imum," limit their troops now deployed in positions near
the Polish border.
"At the very least the divisions deployed around Poland
— there are about 20 of them — would have to be re
versed," Weinberger told a group of reporters at a break
fast meeting
American allies have been pushing the United States to
begin arms talks with the Soviets as part of a planned
NATO buildup of tactical nuclear weapons in Western Eu
rope.
But Weinberger's hard-line approach to arms talks was
at odds with a formula adopted by NATO defense min
isters in Bonn last week and with positions taken publicly
by Secretary of State Alexander Haig
Weinberger and other allied defense chiefs had agreed
in Bonn that such arms talks should go forward unless the
Soviets "intervene in the internal affairs of Poland
The West Germans, in particular, were annoyed last
week when Weinberger told reporters a day after leaving
Bonn that the arms talks could not go forward so long as
there were "threats of violence or intimidation'' around
Poland. This seemed to the Germans to go well beyond the
formula worked out the day before
Mine contract talks resume
Washington — Bargaining over a new soft-coal contract
resumed yesterday for the first time since 160,000 United
Mine Workers struck 19 days earlier, but the industry re
jected new union proposals and the top management nego
tiator declared: "I'm still not optimistic."
B R Brown, president of Consolidation Coal Co. and
chief negotiator for the Bituminous Coal Operators As
sociation. said he was not optimistic about the forging of a
new pact and. when asked if the industry had refused new
proposals from the union, said "I think you could say
that."
The negotiating lineups remained unchanged as repre
sentatives of the UMW and BCOA met one another at the
same Washington hotel where talks have been held at vari
ous times since Jan. 23.
The strike, followed by rank and file rejection of a three
year pact with a 36 percent boost in wages and benefits,
has taken a toll, though not devastating, on some in
dustries. Coal-hauling railroads, for example, have an
nounced hundreds of layoffs
Union President Sam Church, buoyed by votes of con
fidence by the UMW's top governing board and the 39-
member bargaining council, declined comment yester
day.
Funeral for five-star general
Washington — On a blossom-flecked hillside overlook
ing the Potomac, the Army and the nation bade farewell
yesterday to General of the Army Omar Bradley the last
of the five-star generals who forged victory in the last war
America clearly won.
Bradley, who in World War II commanded the 1.3 mil
lion-man 12th Army Group, the largest U.S. force ever as
sembled. was laid to rest with full military honors close to
many of his old comrades in Arlington National Cemetery.
Earlier, about 1000 people gathered below the vaulted
Gothic arches of the Washington Cathedral for an im
pressive Episcopal funeral service for Bradley, who was
88 when he died last Thursday in New York. The long list of
dignitaries was headed by Vice President George Bush
and Nancy Reagan, representing the recuperating presi
dent. Old soldiers, some in uniform and some in civilian
dress, were everywhere.
In a homily, retired Maj. Gen. Francis Sampson, a
former chief of Army chaplains who went ashore with
Bradley in the Normandy invasion of June 1944. eulogized
his old commander as "a soldier's soldier.
"He was dear to his soldiers' hearts," Sampson said.
"But he was also dear to his superiors, to whom he gave
absolute loyalty.
"There was something Lincolnesque about Omar Brad
ley, a tall, strong quiet man from the Midwest," Sampson
said. Describing Bradley in combat, he said the field com
mander "didn't look like a general except for his stars"
even as he was proving himself to be "perhaps the finest
tactician our country has produced in a generation. "

Blood factor hinders cancer defense
Atlanta — Cancer patients — and even some healthy
people — have something in their blood that blunts the
body's natural defense against tumor cells, researchers
said yesterday
Scientists at the University of Michigan have dis
covered a "suppressor factor" that hinders two types of
cells in the body's immune system from attacking and de
stroying tumor cells.
The immune system is the body's internal defense
against infection There is growing evidence it is involved
in cancer defense as well.
Dr. Stanley Schwartz, a pediatrician at the Ann Arbor.
Mich school, said the suppressor factor was found in
small quantities in the blood of most people But levels
were two to three times higher in cancer patients and in a
few healthy volunteers
Schwartz said the suppressor factor may help explain
the "vicious circle" suffered by some cancer patients, in
which the ability of the immune system to resist the dis
ease actually decreases as the size of the tumor increases.
Israelis arm Lebanese Christians
Tel Aviv — Israel is supplying weapons and other
"means and equipment to fight" to Christian militiamen
who have engaged in combat with Syrian forces in Beirut,
Zahlah and other parts of northern Lebanon, an Israeli
military source said yesterday.
In confirming that Israel is aiding the Christian
Falangist forces in the north as well as the Christian
militia of Maj. Saad Haddad in southern Lebanon, the
source said that the Israelis are determined to prevent
Syria from taking effective control of all of Lebanon. Syr
ian forces have been in that country since 1976, when they
were dispatched to help quell a civil war between Chris
tians and Moslems
"Israel cannot live with the domination (of Lebanon) by
the Syrian forces because that makes Lebanon a Syrian
base." the source, who briefed reporters on the under
standing that he would not be identified, said. "A Syrian
force in Lebanon opens a new front against Israel."
Reagan talks with recovering Brady
Washington — President Ronald Reagan talked to his
press secretary. James Brady, yesterday for the first time
since the assassination attempt March 30 in which both
men were wounded.
"Are you ready for a press conference?" Reagan asked
in a telephone cail placed from the White House to Brady's
room at George Washington University Hospital.
"Yes. sir," Brady replied.
"We've got a lot to be thankful to God for." Reagan said.
"We feel that way. too." said Brady.
The conversation lasted two minutes, and Reagan after
ward talked to Brady's wife, Sarah, expressing apprecia
tion both for her husband's performance and her own.
Reagan's budget prospects gloomy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, slowly work
ing up to a half-day schedule, yesterday received a gloomy
private assessment of the legislative prospects for his eco
nomic program.
At a meeting with top advisers and his legislative liaison
staff, the president was told his program faces tough

scrutiny from Democratic liberals in the House and a
forceful rear-guard action from Republican conservatives
in the Senate.
Three conservative GOP senators deserted the adminis
tration last week, causing a 12-8 rejection of his economic
program by the Senate Budget Committee. The defectors
objected on philosophical grounds, saying they could not
support the program because it did not provide the bal
anced budget by 1984 that Reagan has repeatedly prom
ised.
Reagan has instructed budget director David Stockman
to assure the skeptical senators privately that additional
cuts will be forthcoming in 1982 and 1983 to assure a bal
anced budget.
Quebecois win legislative majority
Montreal — The Parti Quebecois. which advocates inde
pendence for the Canadian province of Quebec, held its
strongest majority yet in the provincial legislature yester
day as a result of a sweeping re-election victory.
The PQ, which first gained power in elections 4Va years
ago, won 80 seats in the 122-member Quebec National As
sembly in Monday's provincial elections The opposition
Liberal Party won the other 42
In the popular vote, with 70 percent of the returns
counted early yesterday, the left-of-center PQ had
1,215,523 votes, or 49 percent, and the middle-of-the-road
Liberals 1,147,160, or 46 percent Although the vote was rel
atively close, the PQ won many more seats because its
vote was more evenly distributed over more electoral dis
tricts.

Funeral for five-star general
Washington — On a blossom-flecked hillside overlook
ing the Potomac, the Army and the nation bade farewell
yesterday to General of the Army Omar Bradley the last
of the five-star generals who forged victory in the last war
America clearly won.
Bradley, who in World War II commanded the 1.3 mil
lion-man 12th Army Group, the largest U.S. force ever as
sembled. was laid to rest with full military honors close to
many of his old comrades in Arlington National Cemetery.
Earlier, about 1000 people gathered below the vaulted
Gothic arches of the Washington Cathedral for an im
pressive Episcopal funeral service for Bradley, who was
88 when he died last Thursday in New York. The long list of
dignitaries was headed by Vice President George Bush
and Nancy Reagan, representing the recuperating presi
dent. Old soldiers, some in uniform and some in civilian
dress, were everywhere.
In a homily, retired Maj. Gen. Francis Sampson, a
former chief of Army chaplains who went ashore with
Bradley in the Normandy invasion of June 1944. eulogized
his old commander as "a soldier's soldier.
"He was dear to his soldiers' hearts," Sampson said.
"But he was also dear to his superiors, to whom he gave
absolute loyalty.
"There was something Lincolnesque about Omar Brad
ley, a tall, strong quiet man from the Midwest," Sampson
said. Describing Bradley in combat, he said the field com
mander "didn't look like a general except for his stars"
even as he was proving himself to be "perhaps the finest
tactician our country has produced in a generation. "

Blood factor hinders cancer defense
Atlanta — Cancer patients — and even some healthy
people — have something in their blood that blunts the
body's natural defense against tumor cells, researchers
said yesterday
Scientists at the University of Michigan have dis
covered a "suppressor factor" that hinders two types of
cells in the body's immune system from attacking and de
stroying tumor cells.
The immune system is the body's internal defense
against infection There is growing evidence it is involved
in cancer defense as well.
Dr. Stanley Schwartz, a pediatrician at the Ann Arbor.
Mich school, said the suppressor factor was found in
small quantities in the blood of most people But levels
were two to three times higher in cancer patients and in a
few healthy volunteers
Schwartz said the suppressor factor may help explain
the "vicious circle" suffered by some cancer patients, in
which the ability of the immune system to resist the dis
ease actually decreases as the size of the tumor increases.
Israelis arm Lebanese Christians
Tel Aviv — Israel is supplying weapons and other
"means and equipment to fight" to Christian militiamen
who have engaged in combat with Syrian forces in Beirut,
Zahlah and other parts of northern Lebanon, an Israeli
military source said yesterday.
In confirming that Israel is aiding the Christian
Falangist forces in the north as well as the Christian
militia of Maj. Saad Haddad in southern Lebanon, the
source said that the Israelis are determined to prevent
Syria from taking effective control of all of Lebanon. Syr
ian forces have been in that country since 1976, when they
were dispatched to help quell a civil war between Chris
tians and Moslems
"Israel cannot live with the domination (of Lebanon) by
the Syrian forces because that makes Lebanon a Syrian
base." the source, who briefed reporters on the under
standing that he would not be identified, said. "A Syrian
force in Lebanon opens a new front against Israel."
Reagan talks with recovering Brady
Washington — President Ronald Reagan talked to his
press secretary. James Brady, yesterday for the first time
since the assassination attempt March 30 in which both
men were wounded.
"Are you ready for a press conference?" Reagan asked
in a telephone cail placed from the White House to Brady's
room at George Washington University Hospital.
"Yes. sir," Brady replied.
"We've got a lot to be thankful to God for." Reagan said.
"We feel that way. too." said Brady.
The conversation lasted two minutes, and Reagan after
ward talked to Brady's wife, Sarah, expressing apprecia
tion both for her husband's performance and her own.
Reagan's budget prospects gloomy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, slowly work
ing up to a half-day schedule, yesterday received a gloomy
private assessment of the legislative prospects for his eco
nomic program.
At a meeting with top advisers and his legislative liaison
staff, the president was told his program faces tough

scrutiny from Democratic liberals in the House and a
forceful rear-guard action from Republican conservatives
in the Senate.
Three conservative GOP senators deserted the adminis
tration last week, causing a 12-8 rejection of his economic
program by the Senate Budget Committee. The defectors
objected on philosophical grounds, saying they could not
support the program because it did not provide the bal
anced budget by 1984 that Reagan has repeatedly prom
ised.
Reagan has instructed budget director David Stockman
to assure the skeptical senators privately that additional
cuts will be forthcoming in 1982 and 1983 to assure a bal
anced budget.
Quebecois win legislative majority
Montreal — The Parti Quebecois. which advocates inde
pendence for the Canadian province of Quebec, held its
strongest majority yet in the provincial legislature yester

Liberals 1,147,160, or 46 percent Although the vote was rel
atively close, the PQ won many more seats because its
vote was more evenly distributed over more electoral dis
tricts.
Uncles Sam demands his money
Washington — The final countdown is under way for
Americans to file their 1980 federal individual income tax
returns with the Internal Revenue Service.
The deadline is midnight tonight.
The IRS expects about 13 million tax returns in the last
week of the filing season. It estimates that about 94 million
returns will be filed this year.
Most large post offices that provide 24-hour service are
expected to accept tax returns up to the deadline and affix
a postmark so that it meets the deadline, says Jeanne
O'Neill, media relations officer with the Postal Service
For those who can't meet the deadline, the IRS provides
a two-month automatic extension, to June 15, with the fil
ing of Form 4868, "Application for Automatic Extension of
Time to File U.S. Individual Tax Returns." That should be
filed by midnight tonight along with a check for at least 90
percent of the estimated taxes owed.

Weinberger would delay talks
Washington — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
said yesterday that he is opposed to any arms control talks
with the Soviet Union until the Russians, "at the very min
imum," limit their troops now deployed in positions near
the Polish border.
"At the very least the divisions deployed around Poland
— there are about 20 of them — would have to be re
versed," Weinberger told a group of reporters at a break
fast meeting
American allies have been pushing the United States to
begin arms talks with the Soviets as part of a planned
NATO buildup of tactical nuclear weapons in Western Eu
rope.
But Weinberger's hard-line approach to arms talks was
at odds with a formula adopted by NATO defense min
isters in Bonn last week and with positions taken publicly
by Secretary of State Alexander Haig
Weinberger and other allied defense chiefs had agreed
in Bonn that such arms talks should go forward unless the
Soviets "intervene in the internal affairs of Poland
The West Germans, in particular, were annoyed last
week when Weinberger told reporters a day after leaving
Bonn that the arms talks could not go forward so long as
there were "threats of violence or intimidation'' around
Poland. This seemed to the Germans to go well beyond the
formula worked out the day before
Mine contract talks resume
Washington — Bargaining over a new soft-coal contract
resumed yesterday for the first time since 160,000 United
Mine Workers struck 19 days earlier, but the industry re
jected new union proposals and the top management nego
tiator declared: "I'm still not optimistic."
B R Brown, president of Consolidation Coal Co. and
chief negotiator for the Bituminous Coal Operators As
sociation. said he was not optimistic about the forging of a
new pact and. when asked if the industry had refused new
proposals from the union, said "I think you could say
that."
The negotiating lineups remained unchanged as repre
sentatives of the UMW and BCOA met one another at the
same Washington hotel where talks have been held at vari
ous times since Jan. 23.
The strike, followed by rank and file rejection of a three
year pact with a 36 percent boost in wages and benefits,
has taken a toll, though not devastating, on some in
dustries. Coal-hauling railroads, for example, have an
nounced hundreds of layoffs
Union President Sam Church, buoyed by votes of con
fidence by the UMW's top governing board and the 39-
member bargaining council, declined comment yester

were two to three times higher in cancer patients and in a
few healthy volunteers
Schwartz said the suppressor factor may help explain
the "vicious circle" suffered by some cancer patients, in
which the ability of the immune system to resist the dis
ease actually decreases as the size of the tumor increases.
Israelis arm Lebanese Christians
Tel Aviv — Israel is supplying weapons and other
"means and equipment to fight" to Christian militiamen
who have engaged in combat with Syrian forces in Beirut,
Zahlah and other parts of northern Lebanon, an Israeli
military source said yesterday.
In confirming that Israel is aiding the Christian
Falangist forces in the north as well as the Christian
militia of Maj. Saad Haddad in southern Lebanon, the
source said that the Israelis are determined to prevent
Syria from taking effective control of all of Lebanon. Syr
ian forces have been in that country since 1976, when they
were dispatched to help quell a civil war between Chris
tians and Moslems
"Israel cannot live with the domination (of Lebanon) by
the Syrian forces because that makes Lebanon a Syrian
base." the source, who briefed reporters on the under
standing that he would not be identified, said. "A Syrian
force in Lebanon opens a new front against Israel."
Reagan talks with recovering Brady
Washington — President Ronald Reagan talked to his
press secretary. James Brady, yesterday for the first time
since the assassination attempt March 30 in which both
men were wounded.
"Are you ready for a press conference?" Reagan asked
in a telephone cail placed from the White House to Brady's
room at George Washington University Hospital.
"Yes. sir," Brady replied.
"We've got a lot to be thankful to God for." Reagan said.
"We feel that way. too." said Brady.
The conversation lasted two minutes, and Reagan after
ward talked to Brady's wife, Sarah, expressing apprecia
tion both for her husband's performance and her own.
Reagan's budget prospects gloomy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, slowly work
ing up to a half-day schedule, yesterday received a gloomy
private assessment of the legislative prospects for his eco
nomic program.
At a meeting with top advisers and his legislative liaison
staff, the president was told his program faces tough

scrutiny from Democratic liberals in the House and a
forceful rear-guard action from Republican conservatives
in the Senate.
Three conservative GOP senators deserted the adminis
tration last week, causing a 12-8 rejection of his economic
program by the Senate Budget Committee. The defectors
objected on philosophical grounds, saying they could not
support the program because it did not provide the bal
anced budget by 1984 that Reagan has repeatedly prom
ised.
Reagan has instructed budget director David Stockman
to assure the skeptical senators privately that additional
cuts will be forthcoming in 1982 and 1983 to assure a bal
anced budget.
Quebecois win legislative majority
Montreal — The Parti Quebecois. which advocates inde
pendence for the Canadian province of Quebec, held its
strongest majority yet in the provincial legislature yester
day as a result of a sweeping re-election victory.

counted early yesterday, the left-of-center PQ had
1,215,523 votes, or 49 percent, and the middle-of-the-road
Liberals 1,147,160, or 46 percent Although the vote was rel
atively close, the PQ won many more seats because its
vote was more evenly distributed over more electoral dis
tricts.
Uncles Sam demands his money
Washington — The final countdown is under way for
Americans to file their 1980 federal individual income tax
returns with the Internal Revenue Service.
The deadline is midnight tonight.
The IRS expects about 13 million tax returns in the last
week of the filing season. It estimates that about 94 million
returns will be filed this year.
Most large post offices that provide 24-hour service are
expected to accept tax returns up to the deadline and affix
a postmark so that it meets the deadline, says Jeanne
O'Neill, media relations officer with the Postal Service
For those who can't meet the deadline, the IRS provides
a two-month automatic extension, to June 15, with the fil
ing of Form 4868, "Application for Automatic Extension of
Time to File U.S. Individual Tax Returns." That should be
filed by midnight tonight along with a check for at least 90
percent of the estimated taxes owed.

Weinberger would delay talks
Washington — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
said yesterday that he is opposed to any arms control talks
with the Soviet Union until the Russians, "at the very min
imum," limit their troops now deployed in positions near
the Polish border.
"At the very least the divisions deployed around Poland
— there are about 20 of them — would have to be re
versed," Weinberger told a group of reporters at a break
fast meeting
American allies have been pushing the United States to
begin arms talks with the Soviets as part of a planned
NATO buildup of tactical nuclear weapons in Western Eu
rope.
But Weinberger's hard-line approach to arms talks was
at odds with a formula adopted by NATO defense min
isters in Bonn last week and with positions taken publicly
by Secretary of State Alexander Haig
Weinberger and other allied defense chiefs had agreed
in Bonn that such arms talks should go forward unless the
Soviets "intervene in the internal affairs of Poland
The West Germans, in particular, were annoyed last
week when Weinberger told reporters a day after leaving
Bonn that the arms talks could not go forward so long as
there were "threats of violence or intimidation'' around
Poland. This seemed to the Germans to go well beyond the
formula worked out the day before
Mine contract talks resume
Washington — Bargaining over a new soft-coal contract
resumed yesterday for the first time since 160,000 United
Mine Workers struck 19 days earlier, but the industry re
jected new union proposals and the top management nego
tiator declared: "I'm still not optimistic."
B R Brown, president of Consolidation Coal Co. and
chief negotiator for the Bituminous Coal Operators As
sociation. said he was not optimistic about the forging of a
new pact and. when asked if the industry had refused new
proposals from the union, said "I think you could say
that."
The negotiating lineups remained unchanged as repre
sentatives of the UMW and BCOA met one another at the
same Washington hotel where talks have been held at vari
ous times since Jan. 23.
The strike, followed by rank and file rejection of a three
year pact with a 36 percent boost in wages and benefits,
has taken a toll, though not devastating, on some in
dustries. Coal-hauling railroads, for example, have an
nounced hundreds of layoffs
Union President Sam Church, buoyed by votes of con
fidence by the UMW's top governing board and the 39-
member bargaining council, declined comment yester
day.
Funeral for five-star general
Washington — On a blossom-flecked hillside overlook
ing the Potomac, the Army and the nation bade farewell
yesterday to General of the Army Omar Bradley the last
of the five-star generals who forged victory in the last war
America clearly won.
Bradley, who in World War II commanded the 1.3 mil
lion-man 12th Army Group, the largest U.S. force ever as
sembled. was laid to rest with full military honors close to
many of his old comrades in Arlington National Cemetery.
Earlier, about 1000 people gathered below the vaulted
Gothic arches of the Washington Cathedral for an im
pressive Episcopal funeral service for Bradley, who was
88 when he died last Thursday in New York. The long list of
dignitaries was headed by Vice President George Bush
and Nancy Reagan, representing the recuperating presi
dent. Old soldiers, some in uniform and some in civilian
dress, were everywhere.
In a homily, retired Maj. Gen. Francis Sampson, a
former chief of Army chaplains who went ashore with
Bradley in the Normandy invasion of June 1944. eulogized
his old commander as "a soldier's soldier.
"He was dear to his soldiers' hearts," Sampson said.
"But he was also dear to his superiors, to whom he gave
absolute loyalty.
"There was something Lincolnesque about Omar Brad
ley, a tall, strong quiet man from the Midwest," Sampson
said. Describing Bradley in combat, he said the field com
mander "didn't look like a general except for his stars"
even as he was proving himself to be "perhaps the finest
tactician our country has produced in a generation. "

Blood factor hinders cancer defense
Atlanta — Cancer patients — and even some healthy
people — have something in their blood that blunts the
body's natural defense against tumor cells, researchers
said yesterday
Scientists at the University of Michigan have dis
covered a "suppressor factor" that hinders two types of
cells in the body's immune system from attacking and de
stroying tumor cells.
The immune system is the body's internal defense
against infection There is growing evidence it is involved
in cancer defense as well.
Dr. Stanley Schwartz, a pediatrician at the Ann Arbor.
Mich school, said the suppressor factor was found in
small quantities in the blood of most people But levels
were two to three times higher in cancer patients and in a
few healthy volunteers
Schwartz said the suppressor factor may help explain
the "vicious circle" suffered by some cancer patients, in
which the ability of the immune system to resist the dis
