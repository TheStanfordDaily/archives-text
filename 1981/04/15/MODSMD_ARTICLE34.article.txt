The ASSU Election Pamphlet will be distributed one
day later than planned because of mistakes in reproduc
tion. according to Election Commissioner Karen Bloom.
Upon receiving the pamphlet from the printers Monday
night, Bloom said the ASSU realized that the front and
back pages had been switched, leaving information on one
Council of Presidents (COP) slate at the beginning of the
pamphlet and part of the information on the other COP
slate on the last page. She said there were also several
typographical errors.
"It would be upsetting if you were a COP candidate and
the information you submitted appeared out of order,"
Bloom said. "We decided to have the pamphlet redone
rather than hand out a bad product."

Reprinting the pamphlet will cost an additional $400.
Bloom said the corrected pamphlet was distributed to
all student residences last night and will be stacked in nu
merous locations around campus today. Pamphlets can
also be obtained at the polls.
"The pamphlet is much bigger and more thorough than
it has ever been before," Bloom said. "It is comprehensive
and should be very helpful to the voter."
The pamphlet contains the platforms of all senate, sen
ior class president, COP and Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC) candidates who chose to submit them, and
information on the fee assessments. Also included is a
copy of the proposed Constitutional amendment concern
ing Graduate Student elections.
