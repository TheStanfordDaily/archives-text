In yesterday's Daily, an article on the housing draw sys
tem contained potentially misleading information for stu
dents who will be taking part in the Draw for next fall. Un
like past years, the choices which a student makes for
housing preferences in the first round will be considered
final, including a request for any available housing. These
choices cannot be changed without penalty in the second
round.
Additionally, the housing office seeks to balance assign
ments of males and females in proportion to their numbers
within the student population, which does not necessarily
mean there will be equal numbers of males and females
in the housing system, as was stated in the article.
The Daily regrets the errors.
