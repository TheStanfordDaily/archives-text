# Bright future forseen for shuttle flights
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — The
brilliant first cruise oi the space shut
tle Columbia has brought the United
States to a long-awaited era when the
cost of space operations may no longer
be as restrictive as it was in the past.
Within the next month, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administraton
plans to publish a flight manifest that
will project about three dozen manned
space flights aboard shuttle vehicles
during the first two years after the
new orbiter is declared fully opera
tional.
That means that in a two-year peri
od, NASA expects to launch more

manned flights than it has from 1961,
when Alan Shepard made the first sub
orbital test flight in a Mercury
capsule, until Sunday, when the his
toric flight of the Columbia took off
from Cape Canaveral.
According to NASA's long-range
projections, the United States will
launch a 487 civilian and military
flights using four space shuttleplanes
over the next dozen years.
Second shuttle — Challenger
Rockwell International is to deliver
the second shuttle, the Challenger,
njext year, andjpomplete the third and
tcpiMrtH m9fnber« of the //wt by 1&&4.
As astronauts John Young and Rob

ert Crippen flew home to Houston yes
terday afternoon, Donald Slayton,
NASA's orbital flight test manager,
said that the space agency would now
consider whether shuttle missions
could be landed at Cape Canaveral
earlier than originally planned in the
development program.
As now laid out, all of the four flight
tests are scheduled to land at Edwards
Air Force Base, in California, but the
bullseye landing yesterday by Colum
bia raised the possibility of attempt
ing landings at the Kennedy Space
Center earlier in the test program.
Sl* month* to ra/uMnli
Despite any temptation to ac
celerate the early launch schedule,
Slayton said it would be nearly im
possible to refurbish the Columbia and
launch it again in less than six months.
That means that the shuttle will most
likely fly again next October on a four
day mission.
Later, however, when all four vehi
cles are fully operational, the turn
around time is to be reduced to no
more than two weeks.
But despite the perfect per
formance of the Columbia, introduc
ing the world's first reusable space
craft, the future of the U.S. space pro
gram is not nearly as clear as it would
seem from reading NASA's projected
flight schedule, nor as certain as an
ebullient Young indicated yesterday
when he said, "We're not really too
far, the human race, from going to the
stars."
First flight at crucial time
Columbia's flight, nearly three
years behind its original schedule,
came at a crucial time.
The Reagan administration's pro
posed cuts in the federal budget lopped
$604 million from the $6.7 billion
budget that was sent to Congress in the
final days of the Carter adminis
tration.
Including in the cuts were a $36-mil
lion reduction for the space shuttle
and $126 million from the budget for
space sciences, the latter cutting into
the development of scientific payloads
that the shuttlecrafts will carry into
space.
Beyond the budget actions, there
are few indications as to the Reagan
administration's plans for the civilian
space program. So far it has not
named its new administrator nor oth
er ranking officials.

As it is, the United States seems to
have almost ready for operational use
the most versatile manned space vehi
cle that the world will see for years to
come.
Until the flight of the Columbia,
U.S. manned space vehicles were sin
gle-purpose machines, all dedicated to
the final goal of landing on the moon.
Their use for other purposes was lim
ited.
Although the Soviet Union has
launched about three dozen manned
orbital missions during the six years
that the United States has been
, its Soyux v&hadfs* at ill
belong to the same generation and the
same basic technology as the Gemini
and Apollo hardware now shelves by
the United States.
Biggest leap in 20 years
The introduction of the space shut
tle represents the biggest leap for
ward since the first manned orbital
flight nearly 20 years ago and in
dicates that the United States is very
likely years ahead of the Soviet Union
in space technology.
More than anything else, the shut
tle's landing on the California desert
floor yesterday made it clear that the
spaceplane does belong to an entirely
new generation.
What the flight of Columbia also
showed was that the future of the
manned space flight program now de
pends upon the availability of pay
loads and the demands for launch ser
vices — not just the ability to carry
those payloads into space.
Domestic users hold back
Columbia's success could give both
domestic customers and foreign users
more confidence in signing up to have
U.S. space shuttles take their cargo
into space. So far, some of them, con
cerned over the persistent problems in
getting the shuttle off the ground, have
held onto the option of launching their
satellites with conventional Delta
rockets.
Still, NASA already has launch ser
vice contracts with nine major U.S.
corporations and 15 foreign countries
and organizations.
As things stand, the first opera
tional flight of the space shuttle,
scheduled for September 1982, will
have two commercial communication
satellites in its cargo bay.

Their use for other purposes was lim
ited.
Although the Soviet Union has
launched about three dozen manned
orbital missions during the six years
that the United States has been
, its Soyux v&hadfs* at ill
belong to the same generation and the
same basic technology as the Gemini
and Apollo hardware now shelves by
the United States.
Biggest leap in 20 years
The introduction of the space shut
tle represents the biggest leap for
ward since the first manned orbital
flight nearly 20 years ago and in
dicates that the United States is very
likely years ahead of the Soviet Union
in space technology.
More than anything else, the shut
tle's landing on the California desert
floor yesterday made it clear that the
spaceplane does belong to an entirely
new generation.
What the flight of Columbia also
showed was that the future of the
manned space flight program now de
pends upon the availability of pay
loads and the demands for launch ser
vices — not just the ability to carry
those payloads into space.
Domestic users hold back
Columbia's success could give both
domestic customers and foreign users
more confidence in signing up to have
U.S. space shuttles take their cargo
into space. So far, some of them, con
cerned over the persistent problems in
getting the shuttle off the ground, have
held onto the option of launching their
satellites with conventional Delta
rockets.
Still, NASA already has launch ser
vice contracts with nine major U.S.
corporations and 15 foreign countries
and organizations.
As things stand, the first opera
tional flight of the space shuttle,
scheduled for September 1982, will
have two commercial communication
satellites in its cargo bay.

The space shuttle Columbia is shown here as it completes its perfect landing at Edwards Air Force Base yesterday. The success of this first shuttle flight has
led many to predict a rosy future for the American space program.
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — The
brilliant first cruise oi the space shut
tle Columbia has brought the United
States to a long-awaited era when the
cost of space operations may no longer
be as restrictive as it was in the past.
Within the next month, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administraton
plans to publish a flight manifest that
will project about three dozen manned
space flights aboard shuttle vehicles
during the first two years after the
new orbiter is declared fully opera
tional.
That means that in a two-year peri
od, NASA expects to launch more

manned flights than it has from 1961,
when Alan Shepard made the first sub
orbital test flight in a Mercury
capsule, until Sunday, when the his
toric flight of the Columbia took off
from Cape Canaveral.
According to NASA's long-range
projections, the United States will
launch a 487 civilian and military
flights using four space shuttleplanes
over the next dozen years.
Second shuttle — Challenger
Rockwell International is to deliver
the second shuttle, the Challenger,
njext year, andjpomplete the third and
tcpiMrtH m9fnber« of the //wt by 1&&4.
As astronauts John Young and Rob

ert Crippen flew home to Houston yes
terday afternoon, Donald Slayton,
NASA's orbital flight test manager,
said that the space agency would now
consider whether shuttle missions
could be landed at Cape Canaveral
earlier than originally planned in the
development program.
As now laid out, all of the four flight
tests are scheduled to land at Edwards
Air Force Base, in California, but the
bullseye landing yesterday by Colum
bia raised the possibility of attempt
ing landings at the Kennedy Space
Center earlier in the test program.
Sl* month* to ra/uMnli
Despite any temptation to ac
celerate the early launch schedule,
Slayton said it would be nearly im
possible to refurbish the Columbia and
launch it again in less than six months.
That means that the shuttle will most
likely fly again next October on a four
day mission.
Later, however, when all four vehi
cles are fully operational, the turn
around time is to be reduced to no
more than two weeks.
But despite the perfect per
formance of the Columbia, introduc
ing the world's first reusable space
craft, the future of the U.S. space pro
gram is not nearly as clear as it would
seem from reading NASA's projected
flight schedule, nor as certain as an
ebullient Young indicated yesterday
when he said, "We're not really too
far, the human race, from going to the
stars."
First flight at crucial time
Columbia's flight, nearly three
years behind its original schedule,
came at a crucial time.
The Reagan administration's pro
posed cuts in the federal budget lopped
$604 million from the $6.7 billion
budget that was sent to Congress in the
final days of the Carter adminis
tration.
Including in the cuts were a $36-mil
lion reduction for the space shuttle
and $126 million from the budget for
space sciences, the latter cutting into
the development of scientific payloads
that the shuttlecrafts will carry into
space.
Beyond the budget actions, there
are few indications as to the Reagan
administration's plans for the civilian
space program. So far it has not
named its new administrator nor oth
er ranking officials.

As it is, the United States seems to
have almost ready for operational use
the most versatile manned space vehi
cle that the world will see for years to
come.
Until the flight of the Columbia,
U.S. manned space vehicles were sin
gle-purpose machines, all dedicated to
the final goal of landing on the moon.
