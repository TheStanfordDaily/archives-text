# Through arrangement with UC-Berkeley
## NROTC to be offered to students again this fall 
### Allen Cohn 
The Naval Reserve Officers Training program
(NROTC) will once again be open to Stanford stu
dents next fall because of a new cross-enrollment ar
rangement with the University of California at
Berkeley.
The program, open to freshmen, sophomores and
juniors, involves classes in naval science once or
twice a week at the Berkeley campus and summer
tours of duty with the Navy for on-ship experience.
Stanford students will not be eligible to receive
academic credit for their efforts, but they will be
able to compete for Navy scholarships which may
cover expenses such as tuition, books and fees.
The new Navy agreement is similar to existing
cross-enrollment arrangements with the Army
ROTC at the University of Santa Clara (begun in
1975) and the Air Force ROTC at San Jose State Uni
versity (begun in 1979). However, of the many
schools nationwide that have such cross-enrollment
arrangements with the armed forces, Stanford is
unique in its denial of academic credit to ROTC stu
dents.

Presently five Stanford students are taking Air
Force courses and seven are involved in the Army
ROTC program.
Richard Knowlton, a senior who was instrumental
in initiating the Air Force program here, said he was
happy to hear of the new arrangement. He said par
ticipation in ROTC was not as tedious and demean
ing as the stereotypes would lead one to believe.
Rather, the officers "treat you as if you're an in
telligent person." Knowlton said.
In addition, many of the courses have academic
merit since "they really are very similar to classes
at Stanford." he said.
However, one possible drawback to participation
in the program is the potential for an adverse reac
tion from friends, Knowlton said When his Stanford
peers found out that he was in the ROTC, "the reac
tion was decidedly cool" at times, he said
Four year hitch required
Students who stick with the program through
their senior year of college will be required to serve,
upon graduation, for four years in the Navy.
Reserve Officer Training programs are not en
tirely new to Stanford. ROTC programs were

phased out in 1973. In February 1969, the Faculty
Senate voted to end academic credit for ROTC
cources here. But, in the wake of demonstrations
and violence in the spring of 1970 it decided to phase
out the program.
In the 19705, the "off-ROTC movement" was the
focal point for student protest, and the anti-ROTC
and anti-Cambodian involvement riots cost the Uni
versity $580,000, effectively shut down the Univer
sity for two weeks, and led to the arrest of 34 Stan
ford students.
Other schools had demonstrations
UC-Berkeley, San Jose State and Santa Clara all
had their share of demonstrations and violence in
1970, but their ROTC programs were not termi
nated,
Neither Stanford's Don Carlson, director of uni
versity relations, nor UC-Berkeley's Captain Steve
Sloane, a professor of naval science, said they ex
pected an accompanying return of protest over the
reestablishment of NROTC at Stanford.
The program is being revitalized now because
there is a growing demand among students for the
NROTC program. Sloane said.
