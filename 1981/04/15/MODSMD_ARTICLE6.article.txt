## Tectonics explain quakes 
### Bill Beyda 
Twenty years ago, a scientist
would have been ridiculed if he
suggested the earth was made
up of 10 constantly moving
plates that cause earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, and con
tinental drift. Today, these
facts are scientifically accepted
and are part of a new science
known as plate tectonics.
"The earth's surface is made
up of about 10 plates that are
constantly moving, though very
slowly." according to Robert
Geller, professor of Geophysics
here at Stanford. "When the
plates are unable to move, pres
sure builds up. and this pressure
is released in the form of an
earthquake."
The San Andreas fault is
where the North American and
Pacific plates meet. Plates can
meet in different ways, accord
ing to Geller. The San Andreas
fault is a transform fault, with
the plates trying to move side by
side. The Pacific plate is trying
to move North.
Therefore, the notion that
California will some day fall
into the ocean is unfounded, ac
cording to Geology Prof. T.H.
VanAndel. "However," Van-
Andel said, "wise investors

might consider purchasing
property in Baja now, because
in about 50 million years, Baja
will be adjacent to us." Geller
joked that the Pac-10 will be a
more unified division when
USC, UCLA, Cal and Stanford
are all within an hour's drive.
Another example of a trans
form fault is in Havward. where
the plates move slowly every
year, causing the curbs to be off
set. There are no earthquakes if
the plates are able to move,
since pressure cannot build up.
Plates can also move away
from each other, or can ram into
each other, which isknownas a
convergent margin. Usually
this happens on the sea floor, ac
cording to Geller. but one exam
ple that can be identified on land
occurs in East Asia. "When the
Indian and Eurasian plate meet,
the rocks are forced up and form
the Himalaya mountain range."
Geller said.
One of the reasons Stanford
was devastated by the 1906
earthquake was its proximity to
the San Andreas Fault, part of
which passes two kilometers
from the Quad, slightly west of
the Dish (Stanford Radio Tele
scope), and near SLAC (Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Cen

ter).
Many Bay Area residents are
concerned about predictions
that another major earthquake
will hit the area soon. Geller and
VanAndel state, however, that
earthquake predicting is a
tricky business, and that at
present earthquakes can only be
predicted in a "Geological time
frame."
In other words, plate tec
tonics experts can predict with
much certainty that a major
earthquake will hit the Bay
Area in the next 30 years,
but how major, or when, is not
predictable. Since geological
events repeat themselves over
millions of years, a 30-year
error in prediction is reason
able.
Bay Area earthquakes may
frighten some, but they are
small in comparison to those
that occur in other areas. The
1960 Chilean earthquake had
50,000 times the destructive
power of last year's Livermore
earthquake, but was centered
offshore, which lessened its de
structive power.
Most experts agree that the
Bay Area's main weakness will
be highway overpasses and
buildings built before the

newer, safer construction codes *
went into effect. The University
has distributed brochures to all
dorm residents on earthquake
safety as part of its public
awareness program. The earth
quake drill next Tuesday, the
public awareness program and
the University's recently ac
quired earthquake insurance
policy suggest that someone in
the administration is expecting
"the big one" in the near future.
But for now scientists and ad
ministrators can only guess how
soon that quake will be.
