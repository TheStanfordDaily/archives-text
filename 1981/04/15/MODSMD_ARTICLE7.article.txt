# Quake center preps school for 'the big one'

When the next major earth
quake hits the Bay Area — and
experts believe there is a 50-50
chance one is coming in the next
ten years — the resulting dam
age could leave as many as 60
members of the Stanford com
munity dead or crictically in
jured, according to Civil Engi
neering Prof. Haresh Shah, co
director of Stanford's Blume
Earthquake Center.
But to mitigate problems
such an earthquake would gen
erate, the University intends to
run an earthquake drill, as well
maintain efforts to predict and
analyze quakes through the
Earthquake Center.
The University earthquake
drill, planned for next Tuesday,
will be based on a hypothetical
earthquake centered at Crystal
Reservoir in Marin County and
measuring 7.5 on the Richter
scale. "We have determined
that the total damage from such
an earthquake would be approx
imately 15 percent of the value
of University property, or $120
million," Shah said.
The university is carrying $60
million worth of earthquake in
surance as well as operating the
extensive earthquake research
center.
Geophysics Prof. Robert
Geller explained that the real
threat to human life is not posed
by the actual ground movement
but by the collapse of buildings
and related fires. A man living
in a tent in the middle of a field
would not be injured by even a
major quake. "If your tent falls
on top of you, you just get out

and set it back up," Geller said.
Geller discounted the like
lihood of large-scale ground
cracks swallowing people
wholesale during a quake, as
suggested in Superman or
Shogun.
The Kanto earthquake that
devastated Tokyo in 1923 was
the cause of more than 142.000
deaths. According to Geller, the
castastrohic loss of human life
was due to the quake's upsetting
many hibachi grills which were
in use at the time oi the quake,
which occured around noon. The
quake upset the grills, trigger
ing numerous fires which swept
through the close-packed
wooden houses, Geller said.
The many facets of earth
quake hazard — building col
lapse, fire, water and electrici
ty cut-off, severance of gas and
sewerage lines — are being
studied by the University Com
mittee on Earthquake Pre
paredness. According to Shah,
the committee is "doing a
marvelous job. They are active
ly working on each issue. "
The University has been
structurally upgrading one
building at a time, strengthen
ing it to make it more earth
quake resistant.
"The History corner in par
ticular was well-done. The
structural work done was state
of-the-art," Shah said.
However the University does
not have the funds to im
mediately renovate every cam
pus building potentially suscep
tible to earthquakes.
"In event of a large earth
quake, we expect very heavy

damage to some of the older, un
reinforced masonry buildings,"
Shah said.
But Shah was quick to point
out the fallacy in assuming that
old buildings. re unsafe and new
building are safe. "In the Im
perial Valley quake, the most
modern building in the county,
the County Services building,
collapsed. Across the street, the
old courthouse was not even
cracked. In the San Fernando
quake, a hospital recently built
to current code collapsed.
"You can always build a

building following the best code,
then do a lousy job and ensure
that the building will collapse."
Shah said.
In planning the earthquake
drill, the assumption is the Uni
versity will receive no advance
warning and, for some time af
ter the quake, no outside as
sistance. According to Shah.
"The surrounding communities
will have their hands more than
full. We can always ask for help,
but it is not likely we will get
any."

will be based on a hypothetical
earthquake centered at Crystal
Reservoir in Marin County and
measuring 7.5 on the Richter
scale. "We have determined
that the total damage from such
an earthquake would be approx
imately 15 percent of the value
of University property, or $120
million," Shah said.
The university is carrying $60
million worth of earthquake in
surance as well as operating the
extensive earthquake research
center.
Geophysics Prof. Robert
Geller explained that the real
threat to human life is not posed
by the actual ground movement
but by the collapse of buildings
and related fires. A man living
in a tent in the middle of a field
would not be injured by even a
major quake. "If your tent falls
on top of you, you just get out

and set it back up," Geller said.
Geller discounted the like
lihood of large-scale ground
cracks swallowing people
wholesale during a quake, as
suggested in Superman or
Shogun.
The Kanto earthquake that
devastated Tokyo in 1923 was
the cause of more than 142.000
deaths. According to Geller, the
castastrohic loss of human life
was due to the quake's upsetting
many hibachi grills which were
in use at the time oi the quake,
which occured around noon. The
quake upset the grills, trigger
ing numerous fires which swept
through the close-packed
wooden houses, Geller said.
The many facets of earth
quake hazard — building col
lapse, fire, water and electrici
ty cut-off, severance of gas and
sewerage lines — are being
studied by the University Com
mittee on Earthquake Pre
paredness. According to Shah,
the committee is "doing a
marvelous job. They are active
ly working on each issue. "
The University has been
structurally upgrading one
building at a time, strengthen
ing it to make it more earth
quake resistant.
"The History corner in par
ticular was well-done. The
structural work done was state
of-the-art," Shah said.
However the University does
not have the funds to im
mediately renovate every cam
pus building potentially suscep
tible to earthquakes.
"In event of a large earth
quake, we expect very heavy

damage to some of the older, un
reinforced masonry buildings,"
Shah said.
But Shah was quick to point
out the fallacy in assuming that
old buildings. re unsafe and new
building are safe. "In the Im
perial Valley quake, the most
modern building in the county,
the County Services building,
collapsed. Across the street, the
old courthouse was not even
cracked. In the San Fernando
quake, a hospital recently built
to current code collapsed.
"You can always build a

building following the best code,
then do a lousy job and ensure
that the building will collapse."
Shah said.
In planning the earthquake
drill, the assumption is the Uni
versity will receive no advance
warning and, for some time af
ter the quake, no outside as
sistance. According to Shah.
"The surrounding communities
will have their hands more than
full. We can always ask for help,
but it is not likely we will get
any."
