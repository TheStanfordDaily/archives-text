# The
						Fall of San Francisco
## 
### 
April 18. 1981 marks the 75th anniversary of the
San Francisco earthquake, one of the most de
structive in the recorded history of North Ameri
ca. More than 600 persons died in the earthquake
and subsequent fires and property loss has been
estimated at $400 million. Though there are still
the vivid recollections of those who were in the
Bay Area in 1906 and still live here, local United
States Geologic Survey (USGS) records provide a
detailed account of the events and effects of the
quake. . . .
At 5:13 a.m., April 18,1906, a sudden slippage of
rocks along the San Andreas fault generated the
earthquake. The western side of the fault moved
northward relative to the eastern side â€” as though
the cities of San Francisco to the east and Los An
geles to the west were being drawn closer togeth
er.
The offset of roads, fences, buildings, lines of
trees, water pipes, and gas mains documented the
horizontal movement. The maximum displace
ment observed occurred at the head of Tomales
Bay, where a road was offset 21 feet.
In downtown San Francisco, pavements were
shattered and buildings collapsed. Most of the
property damage, however, was caused by hun
dreds of fires which raged for days. Started by ov
erturned stoves and ruptured gas lines, the fires
swept through the City while some firemen stood
by helplessly because many of the City's water

mains were broken.
The 1906 earthquake, with a Richter Scale mag
nitude of 8.3, was caused by crustal movement
along a 270-mile segment of the northern San An
dreas fault. Although 375,000 square miles of
northern California were affected, the quake is
usually called the "San Francisco earthquake"
due to the destruction of the City by a combination
of quake and fire.
Tlie intensity of the shaking actually was
greater in other areas, including Santa Rosa.
U.S. Cieological Survey scientists say that there
is currently about a 1 percent chance per year of a
magnitude 8.3 quake occurring along the northern
segment of the San Andreas fault and a moderate
likelihood that such an earthquake would recur in
the next 20 to 30 years is near 50 percent.
Should a magnitude 8.3 earthquake occur here
again, USGS scientists say that numerous after
shocks could be expected for days or weeks. Al
though little detail is available about the 1906 af
tershocks to use as a guide, some magnitude 6 af
tershocks are likely and perhaps a magnitude 7
event is possible.
Areas particularly vulnerable to quake damage
are coastal bluffs that are now retreating inland
relative to the coast at rates of 3 to 4 feet per year.
The area of the Santa Cruz mountains, west of San
Francisco Bay, and much of the area of northern
coast ranges are also susceptible to slope failure.
