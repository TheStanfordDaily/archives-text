# Geology Prof. Compton will give up teaching to paint
## 
### Karen Springen 
"The most valuable work must be
new," according to Robert Compton,
reknowned professor of Geology. In
his case, innovation extends beyond
his academic field into art. He will
leave the University after 33 years to
try a new career — painting.
"People probably should not im
agine that they're going to do one
thing all their life," said Compton, a
vibrant man whose energy level could
match that of any athlete here. "I'm
not interested in being an artist. I'm
interested in seeing if I can paint in a
satisfying way." He emphasized the
sheer importance of moving in a
creative way, regardless of the field.
Similarities
Compton stressed a definite cor
relation between painting and geolog
ical science. "The two things are not
ali that totally divorced from each
other," he said.
Self-expression is a crucial element

of both. "We can marvel at Cezanne
and Picasso, but what is going to
come out that is new?" he asked.
The two fields allow him to enjoy
both humans and landscapes. Com
pton concentrated on teaching and
fieldwork here, and he plans to paint
both humans and landscapes.
Compton attributed a large portion
of his interest in resuming painting to
fieldwork. He was trained mainly to
paint nudes, however, and particular
ly admires the form of the human
body.
He almost attended art school but
instead went to Stanford for his un
dergraduate study. He emphasized
that he did not regret his career
choice. But early retirement will give
him sufficient time to try painting.
About 15 years ago he took classes
at the San Francisco Art Institute but
was frustrated by the lack of time
available to paint while teaching.
Compton, who plans to attend San

Francisco Art Institute, lit' Berkeley,
or local junior colleges, said it is bene
ficial for a professor to be a student
again. "You get to feel very secure in
your superior position (as a pro
fessor)," he said.
He cited the importance of receiv
ing instructive criticism at art school.
"You're exposing yourself all the
time."
Both painters and geologists
should avoid merely following suc
cessful models. "You should not try to
become Picasso. I learned that partly
from being a scientist."
He encouraged the 60-some Ph.D.
students he has had not to handle
problems the way they think he wants
them to or innovation will not occur.
"Newness comes from feeling com
fortable with yourself and your
field."
Compton also stressed several dif
ferences between science and art. "In
geology, you're seeing things — fac

tual relations that you're interpret
ing," he said. The art student, in con
trast, faces the added difficulty of
starting with a blank canvas.
And unlike geology, painting has a
sensuous quality. "It's expressive. It
does something."
Both teaching and painting may not
offer tangible benefits — teaching is
not rewarded per se, and paintings
may not sell. "The measure of suc
cess is the satisfaction that you feel."
He plans to continue painting for at
least five years. Although he would
like to eventually sell his work, the
early retirement option gives him the
freedom of "not worrying what peo
ple will like."
Teaching experience
Compton has taught Geo 1 here for
about 20 years. The introductory
course enables him to reach the most
people, he said. "You can get them
going on something that may be very
key in their lives. "
