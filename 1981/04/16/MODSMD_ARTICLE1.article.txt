# ASSU elections end today â€” see locations and times below
## No problems for election procedures 
### Mike Resnick 
By 5:00 last night, after trickling in
from 10 polling places around thecam
pus. some 1024 ballots were locked in
the ASSU office safe. 'Things are run
ning very smoothly,' commented
Election Commissioner Karen Bloom.
Even so, there were still some last
minute problems. The Election Hand
books, originally scheduled to be de
livered to University residences on
Monday, were not ready for distribu
tion until today. They were available
at all the polling places and left in
stacks in high traffic areas,according
to Bloom.
Attendence at the candidate fo
rums, held Monday and Tuesday, was
minimal 'There were more can
didates than spectators; they man
aged to take up an entire couch,' said
one of the candidates. Tuesday after
noon's forum at Twain was cancelled
due to lack ot interest on the part of
the residents. Attendence, however,
was considerably better at the later
forums, held at Toyon and Donner, al
though fewer candidates decided to
participate.
While not substantially different
from first day voter turnouts of pre
vious years, ASSU officials stressed
the need tor students to vote sometime
today Bloom indicated that for the fee
assessments to be implemented, even
if they receive a majority of 'yes'
votes. 20 percent of the student body
(about 2600 people) must vote in the
election. This number may be even
harder to reach because, as Assistant
Election Commissioner Mark
Charney noticed, not every voter both
ers to vote for the fee assessments.
Council of Presidents member Day
na Goldfine said that students often
feel "My vote doesn't count." Given
yesterday's turnout, however, a few
votes can make a difference. During
the four and a half hours the Medical
School polling place was set up, only 10
students voted. Even some of the
more visible locations had low turn
outs: 39 students voted at the center of
the quad; 49 cast ballots at Tresidder.
Only two locations saw more than 100
voters. The engineering corner
counted 153 and the highly frequented
post office ended with an all-day total
of 570.
'Stanford students are pro
crastinators; they will vote on the sec
ond day,' Goldfine said. Seniors should
realize that they are eligible to vote.
Today, 10 polling places will again be
in operation, each with an ample supp
ly of Election Handbooks. For the
most hardened procrastinators, the
last polling place will close in the lob
by of Meyer undergraduate library at
9 p.m.
