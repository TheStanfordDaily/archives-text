# Canada's separatist

### 
Montreal (AP) — The re-elec
tion of the separatist govern
ment in Quebec sets the stage
for a possibly climactic show
down over keeping Canada
whole.
The confrontation may take
years to unfold, but the renewed
prospect of a fractured Canada
is likely to revive old concerns
in Washington.
Premier Rene Levesque's
Parti Quebecois, which ad
vocates "sovereignty-associa
tion" for French-speaking Que
bec, meaning political inde
pendence with continued close
economic ties to English-speak
ing Canada, won 80 of the 122
seats in the provincial legisla
ture in Monday's election.
The opposition Liberal Party
took the other 42 seats.
'Good government'
Political analysts here agree
that the PQ was re-elected be
cause of its "good government"
appeal, not on the separatist is
sue. But the results nonetheless
mean the party is stronger than
ever.
The pace of events will be dic
tated by the PQ's own timetable
and by the kaleidoscopic nature
of Canadian politics.
Three of every five Quebec
voters firmly rejected the PQ's
separatist option in May, when
the Levesque government asked
in a referendum for authority to
negotiate sovereignty-associa
tion with the rest of Canada.
Levesque has pledged that in its
second term — probably over
four years — the PQ will not
hold another referendum.
One scenario: the PQ will
fight a 1984 or 1985 election
against the Liberals on the sepa
ratist issue; if it wins, it will try
to force the rest of Canada into
negotiations; it will then pres
ent the final breakaway scheme
to Quebec voters in a referen
dum.
Much now depends on events
elsewhere in Canada.
Reform
Prime Minister Pierre Elliott
Trudeau is fighting to push
through constitutional reform
that is opposed by Levesque and
seven of Canada's nine other
provincial premiers, who con
tend it expands federal powers
at the expense of provincial au
tonomy. The outcome could
arouse more anti-federal feel
ing among French Quebecers.
French Quebecer Trudeau
had planned to step down when
the reform was complete, possi
bly early next year. But his suc
cessor would probably be an
English-Canadian of his own
Liberal Party or a member of
the opposition Progressive Con
servative Party, which has
almost no support in Quebec.
Since this would further alien
ate French Quebecers, Trudeau
may be forced to stay on and
continue his crusade to keep his
home province in the Canadian
confederation.
