# Stress: a reality of our fast-paced society, can we cope with it?
## Realizing the causes of stress 
### Karen Johnson 
Man's innate desire to better
his environment, improve his
mind, and create increasingly
cost efficient ways of dealing
with life, has often resulted in
wonderful and useful inven
tions.
We live in an age of com
puters, food processors and
video cassettes We also live in a
world of stress, caused in part
by those very inventions that
were designed to save us time
and energy.
Stress among office workers
is growing more serious, ac
cording to Jeff Clark, adminis
trative director of the Stanford
Counseling Institute. Clark
finds that it is often the ac
cumulation of small daily prob
lems that results in stress.
"Overwhelming personal
tragedies and problems are of
course very stressful," said
Clark, "the largest problem,
however, is the cumulative ef
fect of all the lesser social
stresses, borne by the majority
of people."
In today's fast-moving socie
ty, we are encountering pres
sures that our parents probably
never dreamed of. Clark cited
various reasons for this.
Wages are not keeping up
with inflation and thus, although
we are making more, our money
is buying less and it seems as if
we aren't getting anywhere.
In families, both husband and
wife are now working and this
often results in feelings of in
adequacy for both parties. Men

who were brought up to believe
that they should be the provider
for the family feel guilty be
cause they can't be, and this in
turn makes them feel resentful
towards their wives who have
essentially taken this role away
from them.
Conversely, women find that
they are having to work to make
ends meet, but feel guilty be
cause they believe they should
be at home, looking alter the
house. In the end they try to
fulfill both occupations and feel
inadequate when they can't
cope
The changing nature of office

machinery is causing more
stress in the workplace. People
are experiencing less and less
human contact with the advent
of computers, and continual
new technological develop
ments means there is constant
pressure to learn new things.
Stress affects everyone dif
ferently. According to Clark,
it's all in the way you deal with
it. One person may be under just
as much stress as the next per
son, but because he can deal
with it better, it's not a prob
lem.
Clark says there are two

important factors in dealing
with stress One is simply to
have a sense of humor If one
has the ability to laugh and en
joy lite, chances are stress
won't get to that person
The other important factor is
social interaction The more
close friends a person has, and
the more one talks to people
about real feelings, the less
tense a person is likely to be.
The reason for this, according to
Clark, is that friends reinforce
one's sense of self-worth, mak
ing a person less prone to having
to prove himself in other ways.
Not all people cooe with

stress that well though. In an ef
fort to combat the problem, the
Institute is starting a stress
workshop. Six participants have
already been chosen, all wom
en.
It would be erroneous to sup
pose, however, that women are
the only ones who suffer from
stress. Thirty-three percent of
the workshop's applications
came from men. but due to lim
ited enrollment, the Institute
chose only those applicants who
appeared to be truly committed
to changing their behavior pat
terns.
The workshop's goal is not to
find a stress-free life for people,
but to make daily living more
manageable.
One part of the workshop's
focus will be on time man
agement, since one of the main
worries in life is that there just
isn't enough time to do ev
erything.
Another focus will be on peo
ple's unrealistic beliefs. Ac
cording to Clark, many of the
people that experience stress
hold unrealistic expectations of
perfection. He cites as an exam
ple the belief that "I can do any
thing if I try hard enough." A
more realistic approach would
be, "I can do almost everything
that's important to me, but I
can't do everything and it's not
simply a matter of trying
harder."
What the Institute in effect is
trying to achieve is an at
titudinal change. Becoming
aware of the causes of stress
helps you to eliminate them, and
becoming aware of your own ca
pacity for doing things, will
hopefully teach you to not ex
tend yourself beyond the point
where you can cope.
