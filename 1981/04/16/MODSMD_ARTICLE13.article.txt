# Fragile balance: stress vs. disease

Events and changes in a per
son's life, both positive and
negative, make one more prone
to illness, according to Dr.
Gurdon Pulford, a pediatrician
at the Palo Alto Medical Foun
dation for Health Care, Re
search and Education, and
clinical professor at Stanford.
This hypothesis is not new,
said Pulford. The idea was first
introduced a generation ago at
Cornell by Dr. Harold Wolf.
More recently, studies of tuber
culosis patients found that
changes had occurred in the
lives of those patients in whom
the tuberculosis germ had been
activated, said Pulford. He said
there was also a dramatically
strong correlation between
events and disease among Viet
namese soldiers.
Pulford is now conducting a
study, by questionnaire, to test
this theory. "We are trying to
validate the questionnaire and
use it clinically," said Pulford.
It is accepted far more by the
patient population than by the
medical population, he said
The questionnaire or "life event

scale" consists of 50 good and
bad events such as the death of a
parent, the divorce of parents,
getting a summer job, or being
told one is attractive, he said.
The different events are ac
corded a certain number of
points. The more momentous
the event, the more points it is
given. Pulford said. Thus if the

death of one's mother is 100
points, dating, acceptance to
the college of one's choice, and
other more minor events would
be given fewer points. In the
final analysis the higher one's
score, the worse the illness
potential, he said.
"A number ot people show a
strong correlation between dis
eases and events," said Pultord
"If you have so many points
then you may develop an illness
in the next few months." The
term illness includes accidents,
colds and anti-social behavior,
he said.
A doctor can warn his patient
to avoid stress if the patient ac
cumulates a lot of points, said
Pultord. An example of how this

point accumulation works, he
said, is that it one graduates
with honors, and is then ad
mitted to Stanford, it is not a
good time for marriage. Or if
someone's spouse dies, he or she
should not move in with a son or
daughter right away. One
should wait a while, before mak
ing any more changes to one's

lifestyle, said Pulford
Although it is possible to
avoid disease by taking it easy
once one has accumulated a
number of points, a person
should not be afraid to become
ill "To some extreme, the con
cept is that illness is good for
your health," he said.
"Systems," including the hu
man system, "are goal ori
ented." He said each system
tries to stay in balance —''like a
teeter-totter." If everything is
going down, a little disease —
whether an accident, the flu or a
suicide attempt, may help
Pulford said.
Some people, however, can
have many points and still not
contract a severe disease, said

Pulford But even if one does,
the more severe diseases, such
as diabetes, can be healthy, he
said. "Social support systems
rally around you." Everyone is
nice to a sick person so things
look better, he said. It gets one
back into "homeostatis so you
don't lose the game altogether."
said Pulford
Of course there are ways to
cope with stress besides getting
an illness, said Pulford. "There
are dozens of coping mecha
nisms and getting sick is not the
best." Some methods for sub
limation include writing a
poem, going out for the soccer
or swim team, or doing other
constructive, creative ac
tivities. he said Many great ac
complishments happened dur
ing times of stress, said
Pulford.
The best coping device, ac
cording to Pulford, is to fall in
love. Being loved is good for the
health, and the relationship is
good in the early stages, even
hough it may gradually deterio
rate. he said.
Pulford said that how you
make out in life has a lot to do
with which coping mechanisms
are used. "More successful peo
ple select more successful cop
ing mechanisms." The classic
adaptive coping mechanism is
hard work; fantasy and drug us
age are not useful, he said.
The methods for coping with
stress are long and com
plicated. said Pulford, but if a
person is aware of the situation
and realizes that he has ac
cumulated a number of points,
he can possibly avoid illness. Or
else by effectively using adap
tive coping mechanisms or con
tracting a disease he can re-bal
ance the "teeter-totter."
