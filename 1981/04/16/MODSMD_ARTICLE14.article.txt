## Michael I. Spye in 'Case of Missing A' 
### 
I trudged wearily back to my
room and collapsed on my bed. I
felt like I had just been through
a war. In effect. I practically
had. I had just taken a three
hour biology mid-term. Still I
survived. I was tough. After all,
I was Michael I Spye, Student
Grade Investigator.
Yes. ladies and gentlemen,
once again it is time for another
exciting episode of "Michael I.
Spye, Student Grade In
vestigator." This week we take
you to that most beautiful, most
intellectual, most boring of uni
versities. Stanford University.
In today's show, Michael gets
thrown into a world of treach
erous men, dangerous women,
and worst of all. cut-throat pre
meds, as he confronts "The
Mysterious Case Of The Missing
A." Now back to our story:
In my fatigue, I reflected
back to how I had become in
volved in this case. It all began
when this lady called me at my
office and began hysterically
telling me about her son. "Oh
Mr. Spye," she said. "You've
got to help me. I have a son that
is about to graduate from Stan
ford. All through college, he re
ceived A s in all his classes. He
was so smart that in the pre
med society they called him,
The Raging Bio Major.' "
"Lady," I replied, "I'm real
ly happy for you. Maybe when I
have an ulcer one day, I'll give
your son a call. Now, why don't
you go find him a nice Jewish
girl to marry. I have work to do,
so if you don't mind ..."
"You don't understand, Mr.
Spye. We just received his final
transcript, and we see that he
received an A- in Chem 33. With
this A-, our son is no longer the
top pre-med student in Ameri
ca." By this time she was
crying. "Please Mr. Spye.
You've got to help us. You've
got to find out why he got the A-.
and maybe change it."
The lady sounded so pitiful
that I decided to take the case. I
always like to immerse myself
into a client's world, so I de
cided to study Biology for two
weeks and then take a test. Ac
tually, the most I received from
this experience was a headache.
The fatigue was starting to
get to me. Soon I felt myself
drifting off. Sleep came quickly
. . . then a dream began.
I was at a Stanford party.
Good-looking girls all around,
beer flowing and music playing
loudly. Suddenly a guy yelled
out, "Okay, everyone, let's play
a game." A beautiful blond in a
black dress stared at me and
said demurely, "Yeah, let's
play a game."
I had recently done an in
vestigation at a school in South

ern California, and I though
back with fond memories to the
wild party games in which I had
become involved while there.
That's when the dream began
to turn into a nightmare. Sud
denly all these gorgeous girls
lined up on one side of the room,
and the guys lined up on the oth
er. The blond licked her lips and
said, "Let's start." She pointed
at me. "You go first. Spell 'tedi
um.' "
"What is this." I said. "I
thought we were going to play
party games."
"We are. We're having a
spelling bee," someone shouted.
I ran out of the dorm party
and found myself running down
Palm Drive, trying to escape
Stanford. Just as I reached the
end. I realized that a huge wall
of Biochemistry books was
blocking my path. I knocked
these down, and then there was
a wall of calculus books. Then
there were history books, then
econ books . . .
Mercifully, an early garbage
man dropped his can, and I
awoke. It was a beautiful day. I
decided I would begin my in
vestigation.
I decided to begin my in
vestigation by talking to The
Raging Bio Major's former girl
friend, a doll by the name of El
len Stanfordchickberg.
When she opened her door to
respond to my knocks, the pret
tiness of this girl suprised me.
Of course, maybe it was just my
funny tastes in women that
made her seem appealing.
There was something about a
girl with disheveled hair, a
math book in one hand, and five
differently colored highlighters
in the other that really turned
me on.
"So tell me, Ellen, what do
you first think of when you think
of the Raging Bio Major'?"
A far-away look came into her
eyes and she said softly, "I think
of those lovely nights, when we
were together, holding hands,
just the two of us, our head only
inches apart, chemistry books
in front of our eyes. And once in
a while. Bill would turn to me
and whisper into my ear some
thing like, "What is the catalyst
for the reaction between
potassium and sodium
chloride?" I saw that her hands
were shaking
She was obviously not going to
help very much, and I soon took
my leave. I still needed to find
some reason why Bill might
have gotten an A- in his Chem 31
class.
My next move was to the
gym. Bill had been on Stanford's

varsity Tiddley-Wink team, and
I thought the coach might be
able to give me some insight.
That's when it happened. A
mosquito was on my arm, and I
quickly slapped it and killed it.
Then I look down, and realized
that the dead mosquito looked
like a small dash on my arm.
That was it! That was the an
swer!
I quickly got Mrs. Raging Bio
Major on the phone,
"Listen closely," I told her.
"Find your son's transcript, and
rub your hand over it.
"Okay," she said. "I have it,
and I'm doing it. Hey! Mr. Spye,
it comes off. Why, it's just a
dead mosquito. My son really
does have all A's after all. He re
ally is 'The Raging Bio Major.'
Mr. Spye, how can I ever thank
you?"
"Don't worry about thanking
me. Just send me my money."
Another case solved. I left the
phone booth. For the first time,
I took a good look at the campus.

It really was a beautiful place.
I saw a tall thin guy walking
toward me.
"Aren't you Michael I. Spye,
Student Grade Investigator,"
he asked.
'That's me," I responded.
"Well, my name is Fred, and
this place could really use a full
time student grade in
vestigator. It would really add
diversity to the student body.
How about it. Would you like to
join with us."
I gave the guy a hard look. He
seemed honest enough. "Bud
dy," I said. "You got a deal."
Well fans, that's our show for
this week. Isn't our hero just
great. Be sure to tune in next
week, as Michael I. Spye con
fronts "The Case Of The Stan
ford Tennis Player Who Forgot
How To Grunt."
Till then, bye-bye.
(Michael Weiss is a sophomore
majoring in economics. His col
umn appears every other
Thursday.)
