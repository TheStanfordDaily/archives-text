## Learning from literature 
### 
I decide it is time to take a
break, so I gaze out my in
famous third-story window and
glimpse a mass of sun-drenched
bodies absorbing the sun's can
cerous rays.
In terms of nature it is a beau
tiful day. But nature, like all
things, can be deceiving. As I
metaphorically peer past our
isolated society I quickly realize
that all is not well.
In Washington I see the Presi
dent recovering from a shot that
was intended to kill him. Al
though President Reagan's tre
mendous courage serves as an
inspiration, the action of John
Hinckley serves as a grim re
minder of the true state of the
union.
A further admonition is found
in a nearby hospital bed where a
once jovial press secretary
James Brady lies motionless in
bed suffering from a bullet
would which he received be
cause he was in the way. They
say he is improving re
markably, but one wonders if a
man, even of Brady's stature,
can ever fully recover from
such an incident.
Farther East, my vision
brings me to Poland, where for
a moment my thoughts become
jumbled as I attempt to under
stand the stalled condition of the
state in which both sides are re
fusing to budge but neither is
winning. My thoughts clear as I
realize that I may be visiting
Poland, rifle in hand, sooner

than I desire.
Or perhaps my vacation will
take me in a different direction,
to Central America a little
nearer, or maybe "dearer" is
more accurate, to home. Here I
find a nation inflicted with per
petual political warfare. I read
of hundreds of people buried
alive and of daily massacres. I
wonder why they call this
progress?
As I return to our own home
front, the tranquility of Stan
ford, my vision fails to improve.
I see people so wrapped up in
themselves that they fail to even
look beyond Stanford Avenue.
Begrudgingly I see people
mercilessly stepping on others
on their way up the ladder of
success. And worst of all, I see
people who don't care about
what is going on in the world be
cause it doesn't directly con
cern them.
Suddenly a barrage of ques
tions cross through my head:
What has happened to our sup
posed innate compassion for hu
manity? How have we managed
to progress to this stage of sani
ty? And how can we continue to
live in a world like this?
And as I begin to search for
desperately needed solutions I
turn to literature and surpris
ingly find many answers to our
absurd perseverance and adap
tation. That's right, literature
must not be considered a wasted
pasttime; to the contrary, liter
ature has to do with living and
what it means to be a part of hu
manity.
In contemporary society liter
ature is often avoided because it
is irrelevant. In fact, the truth is
quite the opposite. Every great
novel provides a temporal
vacarious lifestyle for the
reader to become enthralled in
and to learn from. Each charac
ter in a book has something to
teach us about our own lives.
In essence, the author is at
tempting to save the reader
from painful learning ex
periences. A novel helps one be
come a better prepared person;
better prepared to deal with life
and to adapt. Literature also of
fers profound social commen
tary and is more than a way of
telling a good story.
But most importantly, and
certainly relevant to today's so
ciety, literature instructs in the
art of adaptation and per
severance. For instance, the an
swers to how we manage to con
tinue living in this senseless and
valueless age are to be found in
many modern novels.

One such book is Ralph El
lison's Invisible Man, in which a
man who, like all of us, is
metaphorically invisible, ex
periences a succession of dis
illusioning and traumatic
events. Finally, out of desper
ation, he plunges into a hole to
escape the utter lunacy which
surrounds him.
But he doesn't remain in the
hole even though he is fully
aware that he will never win.
Rather, and this is what is so im
portant to our lives, he chooses
to emerge and re-enter society.
In the words of Jean Paul
Sartre, he returns without il
lusions to do what he can. He
continues to fight in spite of im
minent failure because he loves
man and he cannot stop loving.
Anyone who says that he can
not learn from this novel needs
to re-examine his reading tech
niques. This is a novel, and cer
tainly not an isolated example
which is both relevant and im
portant to our lives.
Literature teaches how and
what it means to be a human
being. Whether the book it an
cient or modern, it nonetheless
teaches the reader about
himself.
This is precisely why socie
ty's neglect of books is so
alarming. The world might be a
better and safer place if ev
eryone read more. At least it
would be more interesting. But
the National Enquirer has re
placed Shakespeare and Camus
as entertainment, and Western
Culture books remain on the
bookshelf untouched by student
hands.
People no longer read be
cause it is tiresome and unim
portant. In this age of special
ization in which we have spe
cialized things at the expense of
human values, literature is
traded for engineering degrees.
Literature is certainly not
going to solve all of the world's
problems, but it might help all
of us to understand a little bit
more about ourselves, and why
like the Chaplain in Catch-22 we
manage to perservere.
I conclude with a remark by
Aldous Huxley, who sum
marizes the importance of
books as follows: "Every man
who knows how to read has it in
his power to magnify himself, to
multiply the ways in which he
exists, to make his life full, sig
nificant and interesting."

such an incident.
Farther East, my vision
brings me to Poland, where for
a moment my thoughts become
jumbled as I attempt to under
stand the stalled condition of the
state in which both sides are re
fusing to budge but neither is
winning. My thoughts clear as I
realize that I may be visiting
Poland, rifle in hand, sooner

than I desire.
Or perhaps my vacation will
take me in a different direction,
to Central America a little
nearer, or maybe "dearer" is
more accurate, to home. Here I
find a nation inflicted with per
petual political warfare. I read
of hundreds of people buried
alive and of daily massacres. I
wonder why they call this
progress?
As I return to our own home
front, the tranquility of Stan
ford, my vision fails to improve.
I see people so wrapped up in
themselves that they fail to even
look beyond Stanford Avenue.
Begrudgingly I see people
mercilessly stepping on others
on their way up the ladder of
success. And worst of all, I see
people who don't care about
what is going on in the world be
cause it doesn't directly con
cern them.
Suddenly a barrage of ques
tions cross through my head:
What has happened to our sup
posed innate compassion for hu
manity? How have we managed
to progress to this stage of sani
ty? And how can we continue to
live in a world like this?
And as I begin to search for
desperately needed solutions I
turn to literature and surpris
ingly find many answers to our
absurd perseverance and adap
tation. That's right, literature
must not be considered a wasted
pasttime; to the contrary, liter
ature has to do with living and
what it means to be a part of hu
manity.
In contemporary society liter
ature is often avoided because it
is irrelevant. In fact, the truth is
quite the opposite. Every great
novel provides a temporal
vacarious lifestyle for the
reader to become enthralled in
and to learn from. Each charac
ter in a book has something to
teach us about our own lives.
In essence, the author is at
tempting to save the reader
from painful learning ex
periences. A novel helps one be
come a better prepared person;
better prepared to deal with life
and to adapt. Literature also of
fers profound social commen
tary and is more than a way of
telling a good story.
But most importantly, and
certainly relevant to today's so
ciety, literature instructs in the
art of adaptation and per
severance. For instance, the an
swers to how we manage to con
tinue living in this senseless and
valueless age are to be found in
many modern novels.

One such book is Ralph El
lison's Invisible Man, in which a
man who, like all of us, is
metaphorically invisible, ex
periences a succession of dis
illusioning and traumatic
events. Finally, out of desper
ation, he plunges into a hole to
escape the utter lunacy which
surrounds him.
But he doesn't remain in the
hole even though he is fully
aware that he will never win.
Rather, and this is what is so im
portant to our lives, he chooses
to emerge and re-enter society.
In the words of Jean Paul
Sartre, he returns without il
lusions to do what he can. He
continues to fight in spite of im
minent failure because he loves
man and he cannot stop loving.
Anyone who says that he can
not learn from this novel needs
to re-examine his reading tech
niques. This is a novel, and cer
tainly not an isolated example
which is both relevant and im
portant to our lives.
Literature teaches how and
what it means to be a human
being. Whether the book it an
cient or modern, it nonetheless
teaches the reader about
himself.
This is precisely why socie
ty's neglect of books is so
alarming. The world might be a
better and safer place if ev
eryone read more. At least it
would be more interesting. But
the National Enquirer has re
placed Shakespeare and Camus
as entertainment, and Western
Culture books remain on the
bookshelf untouched by student
hands.
People no longer read be
cause it is tiresome and unim
portant. In this age of special
ization in which we have spe
cialized things at the expense of
human values, literature is
traded for engineering degrees.
Literature is certainly not
going to solve all of the world's
problems, but it might help all
of us to understand a little bit
more about ourselves, and why
like the Chaplain in Catch-22 we
manage to perservere.
I conclude with a remark by
Aldous Huxley, who sum
marizes the importance of
books as follows: "Every man
who knows how to read has it in
his power to magnify himself, to
multiply the ways in which he
exists, to make his life full, sig
nificant and interesting."
(Michael Selmi is an un
declared sophomore. His col
umn appears every other
Thursda\.)
I decide it is time to take a
break, so I gaze out my in
famous third-story window and
glimpse a mass of sun-drenched
bodies absorbing the sun's can
cerous rays.
In terms of nature it is a beau
tiful day. But nature, like all
things, can be deceiving. As I
metaphorically peer past our
isolated society I quickly realize
that all is not well.
In Washington I see the Presi
dent recovering from a shot that
was intended to kill him. Al
though President Reagan's tre
mendous courage serves as an
inspiration, the action of John
Hinckley serves as a grim re
minder of the true state of the
union.
A further admonition is found
in a nearby hospital bed where a
once jovial press secretary
James Brady lies motionless in
bed suffering from a bullet
would which he received be
cause he was in the way. They
say he is improving re
markably, but one wonders if a
man, even of Brady's stature,
can ever fully recover from
such an incident.
