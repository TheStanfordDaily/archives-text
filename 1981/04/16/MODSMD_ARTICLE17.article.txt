## Puerto Rican Association at Stanford ‘West Side Story' insensitive 
### 
Here at Stanford, Ram's
Head production management
says they are not making an '' in
sensitive" statement about
Puerto Ricans, but producing a
wonderful love story. Their
statement condones an ex
pression of bigoted racist stere
otypes about Puerto Ricans be
cause it is made through a play;
because "West Side Story" is
art and we should look at art for
art's sake. Should we forget
about reality and let such socio
political statements go uncon
tested because they are part of
some individual's artistic ex
pression? We think not!
The Puerto Rican Association
of Stanford would like to ex
press a number of objections we
have regarding the depiction of
Puerto Ricans in "West Side
Story." Our aim in this article is
to raise critical questions about
the play and how it affects the
general perception of Puerto Ri
cans in the United States and
abroad. We do so by examining
stereotypes, their significance,
and the static nature of the mass
media portrayals of Puerto Ri
cans.
"West Side Story" presents
an incorrect view of the Puerto
Rican immigrant. We are
portrayed as violent gang mem
bers who come from a desper
ately impoverished island, well
worth our leaving. The song "I
Want to Live in America"
epitomizes this feeling of dis
dain for the Puerto Rico left be
hind, especially on the part of
the female characters. A com
bination of natural disasters —
"always a hurricane blowing"
— and the natives' natural pro
pensity for overpopulation
come up as causes of the is
land's economic and technolog
ical underdevelopment and the
characters' justification for
leaving.

This is blaming the victim. It
is true that in the 1950s when the
play was written Puerto Rico
was an underdeveloped third
world country. It still is. But it is
also true that what caused the
huge influx of Puerto Ricans af
ter World War 11, and especially
in the 19605, to U.S. cities was
not nature, but a program engi
neered by the Commonwealth
government of Puerto Rico. The
U.S. government, and industry
called "Operation Bootstrap."
"Operation Bootstrap" ef
fected a shift from an agricul
ture-based economy to an in
dustrial one. This shift caused a
massive displacement of labor
and left thousands unemployed.
Puerto Ricans were persuaded
to re-locate to the United States
based on misinformation and
false incentives. The distorted
model of economic develop
ment promoted by the "Opera
tion Bootstrap" has benefitted
the U.S. industry more than the
Puerto Rican people. It is a
direct result of Puerto Rico's
colonial status vis-a-vis the
U.S., a status which has been of
ficially censured by the United
Nations.
Of course, Puerto Ricans
have not passively accepted
their socio-political situation.
Both in Puerto Rico and in the
United States they have strug
gled to gain control of the social
and economic forces which de
termine their lives. Through the
means offered to them by cul
ture, the arts, and effective po
litical organization, they have
fashioned a long-standing tradi
tion with a deep sense of na
tionalism and pride in being
Puerto Rican. This is what we
properly call Puerto Rican cul
ture, not the debased and un
representative version that one
gets from "West Side Story,"
with its stereotype of the
"Spanish": irrationality,
machismo, and flamenco turns.
Pride in being Puerto Rican is
totally lacking in "West Side
Story," as are any aspects of
real Puerto Rican culture. What
is most insidious, though, is not
the misrepresentation has on
the Puerto Rican growing up in
the U.S. and on the general pub
lic. Portrayals like those in
"West Side Story" cannot lead
to any positive evaluation of our

cultural heritage.
One might argue that "West
Side Story" offers only one view
of the Puerto Rican which is not
supposed to be either conclusive
or definitive. But given the totol
absence of any other view in the
mass media, one must conclude
that the American media has
either by design or willful neg
lect promoted a negative image
of the Puerto Ricans until the
recent "Fort Apache" in which
Puerto Ricans living in the
South Bronx were depicted in
the same derogatory manner as
in "West Side Story."
Finally, we object to the
statement implicit in "West
Side Story" that irrational at
titudes create conflict and con
frontation among racial and
ethnic groups in America. Cer
tainly, we all believe in the
power of love. But it is not by ap
pealing to platitudes that we are
going to gain an understanding
of the very real social and eco
nomic forces which bring racial
and ethnic groups into conflict.
Our intention is not to disrupt
the Ram's Head production of
"West Side Story." It is, rather,
informational. We engaged in
dialogue, in good faith, with the
production management of
"West Side Story" and our
purposes was to have them take
some responsibility for the
statement about Puerto Ricans
implicit in this play. Although
they claim to agree with our
stance, and although the pro
ducer agreed to redress the situ
ation in any way short of doing
away with the production, they
have refused to include our pre
pared statement (the above) as
an insert to their program. They
reneged on their desire to
ameliorate the situation by
claiming this one page
statement as "too bulky."
Ram's Head, by producing
"West Side Story," reinforces a
grossly inappropriate stere
otype of the Puerto Rican in the
United States. Furthermore,
they refused to take any respon
sibility for the objectionable
statements in "West Side
Story." Thus, they are making a
political and social statement
about us.

ical underdevelopment and the
characters' justification for
leaving.

This is blaming the victim. It
is true that in the 1950s when the
play was written Puerto Rico
was an underdeveloped third
world country. It still is. But it is
also true that what caused the
huge influx of Puerto Ricans af
ter World War 11, and especially
in the 19605, to U.S. cities was
not nature, but a program engi
neered by the Commonwealth
government of Puerto Rico. The
U.S. government, and industry
called "Operation Bootstrap."
"Operation Bootstrap" ef
fected a shift from an agricul
ture-based economy to an in
dustrial one. This shift caused a
massive displacement of labor
and left thousands unemployed.
Puerto Ricans were persuaded
to re-locate to the United States
based on misinformation and
false incentives. The distorted
model of economic develop
ment promoted by the "Opera
tion Bootstrap" has benefitted
the U.S. industry more than the
Puerto Rican people. It is a
direct result of Puerto Rico's
colonial status vis-a-vis the
U.S., a status which has been of
ficially censured by the United
Nations.
Of course, Puerto Ricans
have not passively accepted
their socio-political situation.
Both in Puerto Rico and in the
United States they have strug
gled to gain control of the social
and economic forces which de
termine their lives. Through the
means offered to them by cul
ture, the arts, and effective po
litical organization, they have
fashioned a long-standing tradi
tion with a deep sense of na
tionalism and pride in being
Puerto Rican. This is what we
properly call Puerto Rican cul
ture, not the debased and un
representative version that one
gets from "West Side Story,"
with its stereotype of the
"Spanish": irrationality,
machismo, and flamenco turns.
Pride in being Puerto Rican is
totally lacking in "West Side
Story," as are any aspects of
real Puerto Rican culture. What
is most insidious, though, is not
the misrepresentation has on
the Puerto Rican growing up in
the U.S. and on the general pub
lic. Portrayals like those in
"West Side Story" cannot lead
to any positive evaluation of our

cultural heritage.
One might argue that "West
Side Story" offers only one view
of the Puerto Rican which is not
supposed to be either conclusive
or definitive. But given the totol
absence of any other view in the
mass media, one must conclude
that the American media has
either by design or willful neg
lect promoted a negative image
of the Puerto Ricans until the
recent "Fort Apache" in which
Puerto Ricans living in the
South Bronx were depicted in
the same derogatory manner as
in "West Side Story."
Finally, we object to the
statement implicit in "West
Side Story" that irrational at
titudes create conflict and con
frontation among racial and
ethnic groups in America. Cer
tainly, we all believe in the
power of love. But it is not by ap
pealing to platitudes that we are
going to gain an understanding
of the very real social and eco
nomic forces which bring racial
and ethnic groups into conflict.
Our intention is not to disrupt
the Ram's Head production of
"West Side Story." It is, rather,
informational. We engaged in
dialogue, in good faith, with the
production management of
"West Side Story" and our
purposes was to have them take
some responsibility for the
statement about Puerto Ricans
implicit in this play. Although
they claim to agree with our
stance, and although the pro
ducer agreed to redress the situ
ation in any way short of doing
away with the production, they
have refused to include our pre
pared statement (the above) as
an insert to their program. They
reneged on their desire to
ameliorate the situation by
claiming this one page
statement as "too bulky."
Ram's Head, by producing
"West Side Story," reinforces a
grossly inappropriate stere
otype of the Puerto Rican in the
United States. Furthermore,
they refused to take any respon
sibility for the objectionable
statements in "West Side
Story." Thus, they are making a
political and social statement
about us.

Here at Stanford, Ram's
Head production management
says they are not making an '' in
sensitive" statement about
Puerto Ricans, but producing a
wonderful love story. Their
statement condones an ex
pression of bigoted racist stere
otypes about Puerto Ricans be
cause it is made through a play;
because "West Side Story" is
art and we should look at art for
art's sake. Should we forget
about reality and let such socio
political statements go uncon
tested because they are part of
some individual's artistic ex
pression? We think not!
The Puerto Rican Association
of Stanford would like to ex
press a number of objections we
have regarding the depiction of
Puerto Ricans in "West Side
Story." Our aim in this article is
to raise critical questions about
the play and how it affects the
general perception of Puerto Ri
cans in the United States and
abroad. We do so by examining
stereotypes, their significance,
and the static nature of the mass
media portrayals of Puerto Ri
cans.
"West Side Story" presents
an incorrect view of the Puerto
Rican immigrant. We are
portrayed as violent gang mem
bers who come from a desper
ately impoverished island, well
worth our leaving. The song "I
Want to Live in America"
epitomizes this feeling of dis
dain for the Puerto Rico left be
hind, especially on the part of
the female characters. A com
bination of natural disasters —
"always a hurricane blowing"
— and the natives' natural pro
pensity for overpopulation
come up as causes of the is
land's economic and technolog
ical underdevelopment and the
characters' justification for
leaving.
