Plant pilferer
To the person who ripped off
my plant:
The tendency is great to as
sume that any plants in an office
setting belong to the office and
"the University can afford an
other one." Unfortunately that
is not the case here. The beau
tiful philodendron that you so
casually walked off with has
belonged to me for almost 10
years and it has taken great love
and patience to grow this plant
to its present state.
I put it in the stairwell be
cause it added color to a dull
corner and was a perfect setting
to show off the magnificence of
that plant. During the past year
that we have been in this office I

have received many compli
ments on it.
Now, not only is my plant
gone, a source of joy is gone and
"the University" clearly cannot
afford another one because it is
now obvious that you (in your in
finite wisdom) have decided to
appropriate for one what was
once a source of beauty for
many and that any plant left out
will be stolen. You have taken a
plant that meant much to me.
Frankly, I am so incensed at
your high-handedness that I
hope it shrivels and dies on you.
If you have any sense of decency
(which seems unlikely) I hope
even more that you return it.
