From the Daily wire services
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. —
The era of the space shuttle has begun.
In Houston, Columbia's astronauts
began telling specialists yesterday the
details of a flight they described as
"just short of a miracle."
John Young and Robert Crippen had
the morning free to relax with their
families after an historic 2V4-day or
bital flight that ended spectacularly
Tuesday with a pinpoint landing on a
desert runway in California.
They huddled after lunch with flight
operations director George Addey and
engineers and technicians anxious to
discuss the flight while details still are
fresh in the astronauts' minds.
For the next seven working days,
Young and Crippen will answer ques
tions fired by relays of experts on all
of Columbia's hundreds of systems.
Later the astronauts will hold a news
conference and present their im
pressions to the world.
Columbia is the world's first space
ship capable of being reflown and was
a near-flawless machine, so there are
few problems to analyze. From the
moment of its blazing departure from
Cape Canaveral on Sunday to the land
ing at Edwards Air Force Base on
Tuesday only a few minor problems
cropped up.
Tuesday's near-perfect landing af
ter a "100 percent successful flight"

by the Columbia is testimony to the
potential of the boxy, stubby-winged,
space-going freighter, says Donald
Slayton, shuttle flight test manager
and a former astronaut.
According to Slayton, the ship will
become the workhorse of an era in
which Americans will not only explore
but exploit the unique properties of
space for industrial, scientific and
military gains formerly impossible
without low-cost round trips.
The shuttle's 60-foot cargo bay can
ferry up to 65,000 pounds of instru
ments and components which could be
orbited as high-flying laboratories or
factories and produce superior metal
alloys, pharmaceuticals and other
products that benefit from the weight
lessness beyond Earth's gravity.
The military foresees a low-cost
way to place ever-larger recon
naissance. navigation and com
munications satellites in orbit and
talks of space-borne weapons such as
satellite killers and anti-missile laser
beams.
In addition, the spacecraft has re
established America as a space-going
nation. For nearly six years the high
frontier was the exclusive domain of
Soviet cosmonauts.
Slayton. test manager at the John
son Space Center in Houston, said at a
post-landing news briefing here the
historic voyage encountered no major
problems and only a few minor ag
gravations.
"We've developed a transportation
system that's going ... to carry us out
through the next 20 years," he said.
Meanwhile, the Columbia was being
readied for its next flight: a two-day
trip to Florida on the back of a Boeing
747 jumbo jet.
At Florida's Kennedy Space Center
the Columbia will be checked and re
outfitted for yet another test flight this
fall. That one, with astronauts Joe
Engle and Richard Truly aboard, is to
last four days.
"The schedule is optimistic,"
Slayton said, "but we hope to turn it
around (and be ready to go) in the next
six months."
Officials said initial inspection
showed the shuttle to be in great condi
tion. A few non-critical thermal tiles

on the top of the tail section suffered
some shock damage at liftoff, but the
important ones, those that protected
the sensitive underside from re-entry
heat, were in excellent shape.
Three more Columbia test flights
are planned and will last up to seven
days. Bit officials said the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration might consider cutting off the
last one if the spaceship continues to
perform as well as it did on its maiden
voyage.
That could advance to mid-1982 the
vehicle's operational date,at which
time it can begin moving routinely
into space, ferrying payloads and ex
periments for military, scientific and
commercial missions.
Astronauts Young and Crippen,
awed by the success of their historic
space adventure, were back in Texas
yesterday for several days of intense
debriefing.
Young told the rousing, flag-waving
crowd gathered on Tuesday to greet
the astronauts at nearby Ellington Air
Force Base that the 54V 2 -hour voyage
and unprecedented landing by the
Space Shuttle Columbia was "just
short of a miracle."
"Robert and I spent what were
probably the most exciting 2 1 /z days in
our lives," said the flight commander,
wearing a blue flight suit and standing
on a platform decked with red, white
and blue banners.
Young, who is 50, a veteran of four
previous trips into space and one of the
handful of men to walk on the moon,
suggested there might have been some
perilous moments during the maiden
voyage which perhaps went unnoticed
in an almost flawless mission.
Young said that Crippen. who is 43
and made his first space trip, "is a
very smart man (who) kept me out of
a lot of trouble on that flight."
As he spoke, Crippen stood behind
Young, grinning and shaking his head
from side to side as his boss in space
praised him.
"For me it was the darndest time
I've ever had in my entire life," Crip
pen said. "I was just hanging on, hop
ing he would point me in the right
direction. I want to go back as soon as I
can."

readied for its next flight: a two-day
trip to Florida on the back of a Boeing
747 jumbo jet.
At Florida's Kennedy Space Center
the Columbia will be checked and re
outfitted for yet another test flight this
fall. That one, with astronauts Joe
Engle and Richard Truly aboard, is to
last four days.
"The schedule is optimistic,"
Slayton said, "but we hope to turn it
around (and be ready to go) in the next
six months."
Officials said initial inspection
showed the shuttle to be in great condi
tion. A few non-critical thermal tiles

on the top of the tail section suffered
some shock damage at liftoff, but the
important ones, those that protected
the sensitive underside from re-entry
heat, were in excellent shape.
Three more Columbia test flights
are planned and will last up to seven
days. Bit officials said the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration might consider cutting off the
last one if the spaceship continues to
perform as well as it did on its maiden
voyage.
That could advance to mid-1982 the
vehicle's operational date,at which
time it can begin moving routinely
into space, ferrying payloads and ex
periments for military, scientific and
commercial missions.
Astronauts Young and Crippen,
awed by the success of their historic
space adventure, were back in Texas
yesterday for several days of intense
debriefing.
Young told the rousing, flag-waving
crowd gathered on Tuesday to greet
the astronauts at nearby Ellington Air
Force Base that the 54V 2 -hour voyage
and unprecedented landing by the
Space Shuttle Columbia was "just
short of a miracle."
"Robert and I spent what were
probably the most exciting 2 1 /z days in
our lives," said the flight commander,
wearing a blue flight suit and standing
on a platform decked with red, white
and blue banners.
Young, who is 50, a veteran of four
previous trips into space and one of the
handful of men to walk on the moon,
suggested there might have been some
perilous moments during the maiden
voyage which perhaps went unnoticed
in an almost flawless mission.
Young said that Crippen. who is 43
and made his first space trip, "is a
very smart man (who) kept me out of
a lot of trouble on that flight."
As he spoke, Crippen stood behind
Young, grinning and shaking his head
from side to side as his boss in space
praised him.
"For me it was the darndest time
I've ever had in my entire life," Crip
pen said. "I was just hanging on, hop
ing he would point me in the right
direction. I want to go back as soon as I
can."

The era of the space shuttle has begun.
In Houston, Columbia's astronauts
began telling specialists yesterday the
details of a flight they described as
"just short of a miracle."
John Young and Robert Crippen had
the morning free to relax with their
families after an historic 2V4-day or
bital flight that ended spectacularly
Tuesday with a pinpoint landing on a
desert runway in California.
They huddled after lunch with flight
operations director George Addey and
engineers and technicians anxious to
discuss the flight while details still are
fresh in the astronauts' minds.
For the next seven working days,
Young and Crippen will answer ques
tions fired by relays of experts on all
of Columbia's hundreds of systems.
Later the astronauts will hold a news
conference and present their im
pressions to the world.
Columbia is the world's first space
ship capable of being reflown and was
a near-flawless machine, so there are
few problems to analyze. From the
moment of its blazing departure from
Cape Canaveral on Sunday to the land
ing at Edwards Air Force Base on
Tuesday only a few minor problems
cropped up.
Tuesday's near-perfect landing af
ter a "100 percent successful flight"

by the Columbia is testimony to the
potential of the boxy, stubby-winged,
space-going freighter, says Donald
Slayton, shuttle flight test manager
and a former astronaut.
According to Slayton, the ship will
become the workhorse of an era in
which Americans will not only explore
but exploit the unique properties of
space for industrial, scientific and
military gains formerly impossible
without low-cost round trips.
The shuttle's 60-foot cargo bay can
ferry up to 65,000 pounds of instru
ments and components which could be
orbited as high-flying laboratories or
factories and produce superior metal
alloys, pharmaceuticals and other
products that benefit from the weight
lessness beyond Earth's gravity.
The military foresees a low-cost
way to place ever-larger recon
naissance. navigation and com
munications satellites in orbit and
talks of space-borne weapons such as
satellite killers and anti-missile laser
beams.
In addition, the spacecraft has re
established America as a space-going
nation. For nearly six years the high
frontier was the exclusive domain of
Soviet cosmonauts.
Slayton. test manager at the John
son Space Center in Houston, said at a
post-landing news briefing here the
historic voyage encountered no major
problems and only a few minor ag
gravations.
"We've developed a transportation
system that's going ... to carry us out
through the next 20 years," he said.

readied for its next flight: a two-day
trip to Florida on the back of a Boeing
