# America's defense strategy discussed on radio talk show
## 
### Patty Kammerer 
The disparity in forces
that has grown between the
United States and the Soviet
Union is "inviting Soviet ad
venturism" . . . "The Sovi
ets are having a unilateral
arms race and we need to
join it," according to Ben
jamin Schemmer, editor of
the Armed Forces â– Journal.
Alan Piatt, National Fel
low at the Hoover Institution
and formerly of the U.S.
Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency, retired Major
General David Parker of the
U.S. Army, and Charles Kup
perman, defense analyst for
the Committee on the Pres
ent Danger discussed the is
sue of "rearming" America
on KQED-FM's weekly pro
gram Foreign Exchange, co
hosted by Lynn Joiner and
Elie Abel of the Stanford
Communication Depart
ment.
Schemmer stressed that
"this nation no longer has the
forces needed to execute the
strategy that we have ad-

vertised," namely our com
mitment to defend the free
dom of our allies in Western
Europe, Northeast Asia and
the Middle East.
Piatt agreed that while it
is important to increase de
fense spending, "an arms
race does not make a lot of
sense." Piatt said we should
not merely "throw more
money at the problem" but
correlate what money we
spend with an overall
strategy consistent with our
foreign policy goals. But
Piatt added that with in
creased military spending,
we should simultaneously
pursue arms control nego
tiations with the Soviets.
He said that arms control
talks can only enhance U.S.
security by constraining
"certain planned Soviet sys
tems" and we can then begin
to stabilize the arms com
petition between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
Parker claimed that one
reason why we do not have a
war is the result of our sue

cessful deterrence efforts so
far. Piatt agreed that if
spending is done efficiently,
we can increase our de
terrence posture. We must
maintain the perception of
our ability to respond. The
goal then, according to Kup
perman is not nuclear "supe
riority" but an effort "to re
verse the dangerous down
flight" of the last decade.
Though rebuilding the mil
itary industrial base is vital,
Parker stressed the need to
concentrate on the "people
problem." He advocated
both the need for an im
mediate draft as well as im
provement in the quality of
our armed forces. He said
over half of the people being
recruited in the army can't
get beyond sixth grade read
ing level and "this is exactly
the type of person you would
want in the missile age of the
army."
In order to retain good peo
ple, you have to increase
salary levels and create in
centives for the trained per

sonnel to remain in the
armed forces Parker
claimed one example ot the
retention problem is that
there are too many women in
the armed forces. Parker
said that women cost more to
train and to keep in the army.
Parker said that he was
surprised that most Ameri
cans are not aware that the
share of the national budget
going to defense has de
creased dramatically. In
1960, 50 percen* r,f the federal
budget went to defense
spending compared to the 23
percent now allocated to the
military. This trans
formation of expenditures
has drastically reduced the
effectiveness of the U.S. mil
itary.
There has been a shift in
priorities for the majority of
the American public, accord
ing to Kupperman. He be
lieves that the American
people will support the Rea
gan administration in its ef
forts to "re-arm America."
