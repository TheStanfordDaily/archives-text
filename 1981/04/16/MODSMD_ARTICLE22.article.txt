## Jerry Lewis hardly works 
### Jim Mattson 
Twenty years ago, Jerry Lew
is made The Nutty Professor,
which wasn't just a great Jerry
Lewis movie. It was a great
movie. Lewis had always been
cartoonish, and here he
wrapped the movie around
himself until all that was left
was his gooney smile.
Jerry Lewis doesn't smile
much in Hardly Working, his
first movie in about 10 years.
His face seems to have hard
ened — it looks like clay that s
been left out of its tin too long.
He used to have three or four ex
pressions, most of them funny.
Now he has only one — quiet
desperation. He doesn't seem
certain that he knows how to
make us laugh any more.
There are fewer jokes, and
less schtick, in Hardly Working
than in any other Lewis movie I
can think of, The movie isn't
even silly; in this film, silliness
would have been a blessing. All
those years rearing "Jerry's
kids" seem to have sobered
him. Lewis has become, well,
restrained.
He tries to lather up a little
excitement, but the effort is
only a halfhearted one — it
seems as if he gave up even at
the scriptwriting stage. The
movie opens with Lewis as a
clown in a circus. He wears
makeup that makes him look

like one of those pictures on the
walls at Motel 6.
The clown gets fired, and he
stays with his sister and her hus
band while he looks for work.
They have two kids, nice kids
They're so nice that they make
the movie roll over and die
whenever they're on-screen
What's frightening is that Lewis
doesn't seem to see anything
wrong with these children.
We're presented with the rare
spectacle of an actor who has
made an art form out of child
ishness suddenly turning sen
timental about childhood.
He's also, sadly, become
more enamored of the work eth
ic than can make for healthy
comedy. Lewis goes from job to
job here, and makes a mess of
himself at each one. He doesn't
have a good time at making a
mess, however. He's miserable,
and that's no fun at all.
In Hardly Working, Jerry
Lewis is no longer a likeable
klutz who gets swept into chaos
by the strength of his own good
intentions, he's merely a klutz.
When he knocks over a stack of
papers, or upsets a rack of mail,
or knocks himself out on a
doorframe, we don't laugh, we
politely avert our eyes. It's not
nice to laugh at people who can't
help themselves.
Sentiment and cynicism are
usually linked; both require a

degree of blindness. In Hardly
Working, Lewis' cynicism is
flapping in the wind for the
whole world to see His jokes
are little and bitter like the ones
Bob Hope tells on Texaco com
mercials. He used to be film's
most expansive actor, sprawl
ing, and giggling, and doing
enough double-takes to make
even excess seem funny. Now,
he gives us nothing extra. It
could be that, as a comedian, he
has nothing left to give.
The movie's funniest mo
ments occur when Lewis deals
with some inanimate object
that, for a moment, has become
as irrational as he is. Lewis has
always relied on gadgets to help
crowbar the world out of align
ment, and, once or twice in
Hardly Working he uses them
as well as he ever has.
In a simple, marvelous scene,
he has a telephone conversation
with an answering machine that
chastises him for his rudeness.
Offended, he wraps the cord
around his hand until the voice
chokes on its own words. If Lew
is had been as free, and as
fierce, with the rest of the mov
ie as he was with this scene, he
might have had a comeback on
his hands. Instead, he prepared
something that seems a lot
more like a wake.

Jim Haynie as Lee, in the Magic Theatre's current production of 'True West' by Sam
Shepard. Directed by Robert Woodruff, 'True West' has been described as a play that hurls
itself "with lethal precision at the cynic American psyche" (Time magazine), and as "one of
the American Theatre's most precious natural resources" (New York Times). This produc
tion runs through May 17 at A.C.T.'s Marines' Memorial Theatre. Go see it.
