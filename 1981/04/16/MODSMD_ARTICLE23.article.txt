# Rhinoceros spoofs homosexual mores

### Stephen Nash 
Theatre Rhinoceros will soon
be evicted from it intimate per
forming space in the Goodman
Building to make way for some
despicably boring con
dominiums. Before they move,
though, they are putting on two
one-act comedies by Victor
Bumbalo If you've never been
to their cozy storefront theatre,
this may be your last chance.
In "Kitchen Duty," Michael
(a dominant leatherman) has
invited Bob home for some good
old-fashioned bondage and dis
cipline. Bob is a little new to the
B&D scene, and he starts get
ting nervous, especially when he
finds himself blindfolded and
shackled in leg and hand-cuffs.
When it turns out that the keys
to the cuffs are off on a hot
date with Michael's friend, Bob
is instantly overcome by an
asthma attack. So Michael has
to call Garry, Bob's ex-lover,
who happens to live upstairs and
who still has some ot Bob's med
icine. And that sets off a whole
chain of complications.

This play is a wonderful com
edy, exploiting as it does the
natural theatricality of S/M.
It's great tun to see Michael
(played by Valentine Hooveni
switch in and out ot his role as
Master — one minute ordering
Bob to lick his boots, the next
getting him a drink and asking if
he wants to play Monopoly.
There's also Bob (Michael De-
Martini), obediently saying.
"Yes Sir, No Sir," and knowing
full well what a teddybear
Michael is underneath the cos
tume. Maybe best of all, though,
is the situation when Garry
(Thomas-Mark) arrives with
the medicine, and all three sit
around casually talking about
old times — with Michael in full
leather drag and Bob non
chalantly locked up in hand
cuffs.
The second play, "American
Coffee," is more disturbing. An
older married couple, Connie
and Johnny, are sitting in their
kitchen on the morning of their
daughter's wedding day. A few
hours before, their son arrived

in town, but with his handsome
blond i male i lover in tow. Con
nie and Johnny have planned a
traditional Italian-Catholic
wedding, and Johnny is a little
concerned about the scandal
their son might cause He insists
on drugging the two men with
sleeping pills, but Connie is
equally insistent about having
them at the ceremony And so
the argument continues
Connie and Johnny, with their
naive fantasies about gay life,
are good targets for satire It's
hard not to laugh at them when
they think that their son is gay
because they were cursed by
Dominique, the gay man they
wouldn't let sing at their wed
ding; or at Johnny's fears that
"military" gays might picket
the wedding; or even at the
questions of etiquette, such as
what should Johnny do if their
son's lover asks him to dance.
Sometimes, though, the
satire is uncomfortably close to
the truth. The pointless ques
tions — "What did we do
wrong'.'" or "What if Aunt Rose

suspects?" — often reminds us
of our own families and give this
play a disturbing aura Not that
there is anything wrong with the
play being disturbing It's just a
question of whether to continue
calling it a comedy.
This play is a little too long.
Toward the end. the arguments
become repetitive, and there is
not a great deal of action of dis
tract attention from the
dialogue. And the acting (by
Maggi Sutherland and Nello
Carlini), although generally
strong, is more uneven than in
"Kitchen Duty."
Both plays were directed by
Kevin Hanlon Particularly in
"Kitchen Duty." with its fre
quent changes of situation and
mood, he is very effective at
maintaining the humour in the
two plays.

cipline. Bob is a little new to the
B&D scene, and he starts get
ting nervous, especially when he
finds himself blindfolded and
shackled in leg and hand-cuffs.
When it turns out that the keys
to the cuffs are off on a hot
date with Michael's friend, Bob
is instantly overcome by an
asthma attack. So Michael has
to call Garry, Bob's ex-lover,
who happens to live upstairs and
who still has some ot Bob's med
icine. And that sets off a whole
chain of complications.

This play is a wonderful com
edy, exploiting as it does the
natural theatricality of S/M.
It's great tun to see Michael
(played by Valentine Hooveni
switch in and out ot his role as
Master — one minute ordering
Bob to lick his boots, the next
getting him a drink and asking if
he wants to play Monopoly.
There's also Bob (Michael De-
Martini), obediently saying.
"Yes Sir, No Sir," and knowing
full well what a teddybear
Michael is underneath the cos
tume. Maybe best of all, though,
is the situation when Garry
(Thomas-Mark) arrives with
the medicine, and all three sit
around casually talking about
old times — with Michael in full
leather drag and Bob non
chalantly locked up in hand
cuffs.
The second play, "American
Coffee," is more disturbing. An
older married couple, Connie
and Johnny, are sitting in their
kitchen on the morning of their
daughter's wedding day. A few
hours before, their son arrived

in town, but with his handsome
blond i male i lover in tow. Con
nie and Johnny have planned a
traditional Italian-Catholic
wedding, and Johnny is a little
concerned about the scandal
their son might cause He insists
on drugging the two men with
sleeping pills, but Connie is
equally insistent about having
them at the ceremony And so
the argument continues
Connie and Johnny, with their
naive fantasies about gay life,
are good targets for satire It's
hard not to laugh at them when
they think that their son is gay
because they were cursed by
Dominique, the gay man they
wouldn't let sing at their wed
ding; or at Johnny's fears that
"military" gays might picket
the wedding; or even at the
questions of etiquette, such as
what should Johnny do if their
son's lover asks him to dance.
Sometimes, though, the
satire is uncomfortably close to
the truth. The pointless ques
tions — "What did we do
wrong'.'" or "What if Aunt Rose

suspects?" — often reminds us
of our own families and give this
play a disturbing aura Not that
there is anything wrong with the
play being disturbing It's just a
question of whether to continue
calling it a comedy.
This play is a little too long.
Toward the end. the arguments
become repetitive, and there is
not a great deal of action of dis
tract attention from the
dialogue. And the acting (by
Maggi Sutherland and Nello
Carlini), although generally
strong, is more uneven than in
"Kitchen Duty."
Both plays were directed by
Kevin Hanlon Particularly in
"Kitchen Duty." with its fre
quent changes of situation and
mood, he is very effective at
maintaining the humour in the
two plays.
