# ‘Modern Romance’ shows interior comedy

### Steve Vineberg 
Albert Brooks' style of com
edy is so muted that you have to
lean closely into it before you
can see what is meant to be fun
ny. He's the opposite of a night
club comic like Richard Pryor
or Robin Williams: even on a big
screen he seems remote, like a
witty party guest entertaining a
select group of triends at the
other end of a crowded room. In
Modern Romance, which he co
authored and directed, Brooks
plays Robert Cole, a film editor
who is breaking up with his girl
friend, Mary Harvard (pretty,
wide-eyed Kathryn Harrold) —
sort of. The movie begins with
the break-up scene, which is as
bizarre a piece of comedy as

I've ever laughed at: the
dialogue is sautered together so
that the connection between
cause and effect is often miss
ing, and emotional switches are
rapid and unreasonable. Yet the
two performers deliver the lines
in deadly earnest — in fact, they
are almost glum, and Brooks'
nasal, thin-voiced readings sit
on the edge between melancholy
and monotony. There is comic
tension between this banal seri
ousness and the absurdity of the
encounter — the relationship is
being killed off for no reason we
can get a grasp on. It's im
pressionist lonesco.
It is difficult to predict how
audiences will respond to humor
so subtle that it's practically in

ternal. Brooks' first picture,
Real Life, failed miserably at
the box office, but it was sabo
taged by its distributors, who
didn't open it in more than a few
cities. (It didn't play in mine, so
I haven't seen it.) Modern Ro
mance deserves to be seen, I
think: the first half, if you link
up with Brooks' style, is almost
unceasingly funny. Woody Allen
appeals to so many people be
cause his jokes illuminate thinly
disguised vulnerable spots in
the personalities of characters
with whom we identify; Brooks
sends up Allen's approach —
which has its sentimental, self
pitying side — by showing us a
character whom we seem to
recognize but whose motivation
doesn't read to us, and a rela
tionship that appears real but
that dissolves and comes togeth
er again purely arbitrarily.
Brooks is a skillful per
former. though I don't know if
anybody else's material would
suit him. (He barely registered
in the role of Cybil Shepherd's
sometime boy friend in Taxi
Driver.) Modern Romance is
built entirely around him —
there is, however, a hilarious
cameo by comedy writer James
L. Brooks as a movie director
who talks about his crummy sci
ence-fiction epic as if it were
Citizen Kane — and in the best
sequence he is alone on screen,
except for a pet bird. He has just
taken a couple of quaaludes. and

his movements become soft and
sloppy as he descends into loony
sentimentality; then, speaking
on the phone to a friend, he be
gins to pull at his face. As is
often the case with unusual
comic talents. Brooks' funniest
moments are generally small
ones like this, and his writing
soars in unlikely, off-center pas
sages, too. He doesn't know how
to write and stage a crowd scene
convincingly — he tends to turn
it into a collection of two- and
three-character groupings
glued together — but he can
write a line like "Here's what I
feel, and I've felt it for a long
time and it just hit me."
Modern Romance goes wrong
in the second half for reasons
that are not related to Brooks'
gifts. When Robert's jealousy
drives him to interrupt Mary's
dinner with business associates
and interrogates her about a
long-distance phone number she
called twice (he has read her
phone bill), he exceeds the lim
its of our allowance for a comic
hero and becomes someone
whom we no longer care to lis
ten to. This obnoxious piece of
manipulation was a major mis
calculation on Brooks' part: it
loses him the movie, and un
fortunately, since it is the final
note, he has no chance to recoup
his losses. Modern Romance is
often terrific, but it leaves us
with a vaguely unpleasant feel
ing.

pitying side — by showing us a
character whom we seem to
recognize but whose motivation
doesn't read to us, and a rela
tionship that appears real but
that dissolves and comes togeth
er again purely arbitrarily.
Brooks is a skillful per
former. though I don't know if
anybody else's material would
suit him. (He barely registered
in the role of Cybil Shepherd's
sometime boy friend in Taxi
Driver.) Modern Romance is
built entirely around him —
there is, however, a hilarious
cameo by comedy writer James
L. Brooks as a movie director
who talks about his crummy sci
ence-fiction epic as if it were
Citizen Kane — and in the best
sequence he is alone on screen,
except for a pet bird. He has just
taken a couple of quaaludes. and

his movements become soft and
sloppy as he descends into loony
sentimentality; then, speaking
on the phone to a friend, he be
gins to pull at his face. As is
often the case with unusual
comic talents. Brooks' funniest
moments are generally small
ones like this, and his writing
soars in unlikely, off-center pas
sages, too. He doesn't know how
to write and stage a crowd scene
convincingly — he tends to turn
it into a collection of two- and
three-character groupings
glued together — but he can
write a line like "Here's what I
feel, and I've felt it for a long
time and it just hit me."
Modern Romance goes wrong
in the second half for reasons
that are not related to Brooks'
gifts. When Robert's jealousy
drives him to interrupt Mary's
dinner with business associates
and interrogates her about a
long-distance phone number she
called twice (he has read her
phone bill), he exceeds the lim
its of our allowance for a comic
hero and becomes someone
whom we no longer care to lis
ten to. This obnoxious piece of
manipulation was a major mis
calculation on Brooks' part: it
loses him the movie, and un
fortunately, since it is the final
note, he has no chance to recoup
his losses. Modern Romance is
often terrific, but it leaves us
with a vaguely unpleasant feel
ing.
Albert Brooks' style of com
edy is so muted that you have to
lean closely into it before you
can see what is meant to be fun
ny. He's the opposite of a night
club comic like Richard Pryor
or Robin Williams: even on a big
screen he seems remote, like a
witty party guest entertaining a
select group of triends at the
other end of a crowded room. In
Modern Romance, which he co
authored and directed, Brooks
plays Robert Cole, a film editor
who is breaking up with his girl
friend, Mary Harvard (pretty,
wide-eyed Kathryn Harrold) —
sort of. The movie begins with
the break-up scene, which is as
bizarre a piece of comedy as

I've ever laughed at: the
dialogue is sautered together so
that the connection between
cause and effect is often miss
ing, and emotional switches are
rapid and unreasonable. Yet the
two performers deliver the lines
in deadly earnest — in fact, they
are almost glum, and Brooks'
nasal, thin-voiced readings sit
on the edge between melancholy
and monotony. There is comic
tension between this banal seri
ousness and the absurdity of the
encounter — the relationship is
being killed off for no reason we
can get a grasp on. It's im
pressionist lonesco.
It is difficult to predict how
audiences will respond to humor
so subtle that it's practically in

ternal. Brooks' first picture,
Real Life, failed miserably at
the box office, but it was sabo
taged by its distributors, who
didn't open it in more than a few
cities. (It didn't play in mine, so
I haven't seen it.) Modern Ro
mance deserves to be seen, I
think: the first half, if you link
up with Brooks' style, is almost
unceasingly funny. Woody Allen
appeals to so many people be
cause his jokes illuminate thinly
disguised vulnerable spots in
the personalities of characters
with whom we identify; Brooks
sends up Allen's approach —
which has its sentimental, self
pitying side — by showing us a
character whom we seem to
recognize but whose motivation
doesn't read to us, and a rela
tionship that appears real but
that dissolves and comes togeth
er again purely arbitrarily.
