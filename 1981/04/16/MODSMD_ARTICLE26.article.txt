# Tiara's album reaches back to forties to hit top twenty

New Wave fans beware. A re
fusal to change with the times
and conform to your tastes may
have knocked groups like Chica
go and America from the ranks
of major acts, but not all bands
are intimidated An upstart
called Tierra is not only not
progressive, it's downright re
actionary. And we're not talking
70 s country-rock, or 60 s love
your-neighbor music, or even
a '50s rock and roll. Tierra is a
straight 19405, complete with a
swing-time, big-band style.
And what do you know,
they're getting away with it
Their first single, "Together,"
went to the top-twenty and their
next, "Memories," is also on its
way up the charts Apparently
the growth of progressive, punk,
and new-wave music has opened
up a market of those looking for
something different

On their debut album, City
Nights, Tierra makes a strong
effort to play on these senti
ments They sing of "precious
memories" of shared good
times, ot simple pure and lost
loves, and of dancing to the
swinging beat Perhaps it's a re
flection of our times that they
serve the same function as did
Depressiona and World War II
movies They provide happy,
upbeat, uplifting, and essential
ly mindless entertainment as an
escape from a troubled world
In a spoken interlude in "To
gether," a soft voice reassures.
"Now I know things aren't the
way they used to be right now.
but they are going to get better
someday I know that "
The band itself is L A -based
and Chicano. and its music is
very much a product of this
background Reeds, congas, and
timbales give each song a dis

tinctively Latin sound, as do the
arrangements Because of this,
even a number with a title like
"Latin Disco" has a style that
conjures up an image of people
dancing with roses in their teeth
and a dark-haired dated on their
arm. rather than one of people
in white suits doing spins and
flips Similarly, one could very
easily tango to "Time to
Dance, but it would be more
difficult to do the coathanger.
They indicate that they are
veterans ot the Los Angeles mu
sical Zoot Suit (which is cur
rently being filmed for release)
by including the big-band
number "Zoot Suit Boogie" on
('it\ Xitfhts. This would be con
sistent with their music. They
utilize many characteristics of
the musical theatre, including
dramatically rising harmonies
and swelling horn passages. And
during the album's tender mo

ments. it's not difficult to pic
ture lead singer Steve Salas as
the deeply-in-love broken
hearted young hero crooning his
story to an audience.
Salas brother Rudy wrote all
but one song ("Together") on
the album, including the two co
written with Steve The man is
nothing if not stylish and
agreeable In a way. it really is
a shame that he couldn't have
worked with Fred. Ginger,
Gene. Judy and the rest. After
all, "Zoot Suit Boogie" and
"Time to Dance" wouldn't have
been written or presented any
differently then than now. But
he (along with his brother in
some cases) has also written
several songs that fit right into
today's pop mainstream, with
all of that type's bad and good
implications. Tierra coun
teracts the bad to some extent
by creating a Latin big-band

style used by no other band, but
their music is still not what one
would call "thought-provok
ing " One of their better num
bers, "Givin' Up On Love." has
been done more than once
before with various melodies
and lyrics, but with the same
point. (The Carpenters' "Good
bye to Love" and Elton John's
"Never Gonna Fall in Love
Again "are two fairly recent ex
amples that come to mind.) And
"Memories" and "Street
Scene" are held together with
only a single overriding phrase
â€” "precious memories" in the
first and "everybody's danc
ing" in the other. Not heavy
stuff here.
But City Wights has the
strong point of being cheerful
and pleasant to listen to. Music
of this type, in whatever form it
comes, will always find an au
dience.
