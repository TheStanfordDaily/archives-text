Chick Corea! Yea. Chick Corea! Ear-pleas
ing. soul-touchin' Chick Corea! Where re they

Oh. By himself?
Forget it.
Last Tuesday in the University of Santa
Clara's acoustically perfect Lois B. Mayer
Theater, Chick Corea played to an audience of
four hundred and seventy people. The theater
held 500. True, the concert was not well-publi
cized: a few brief mentions on KPEN. and a
sign hanging in the U. of Santa Clara student
union. Still. I would have expected a much,
much larger turnout.
Perhaps the small number of people was a
good thing. Almost everyone was a die-hard
fan, calling him "Corea" or just "Him," with
only a few crass neophytes uttering "Chick ' as
if they were his best 112 riends. And when he men
tioned Thelonius Monk or Bud Powell, there
were many sighs of recognition
Armed with only a $45,000 Hamburg
Steinway and the voice of Gayle Moran. Cor
ea's opening number was less than brilliant Of
course, this rendition of Ms. Moran s "Do You
Ever Love" was technically perfect, but
shades of Bill Murray playing in some' 1 Kit Kat
Lounge" hopelessly marred the piece As for
Ms. Moran's singing — it takes a lot of getting
used to. Just imagine Joan Armatrading trying
to hit the same high notes as Olivia Newton-
John. But, after adjusting your ears to her
breathy highs and low lows, you realize that
she is very good, perfectly accompanying the
myriad of variations produced by Him."
Following a very good solo called "Love
Castle," producing little wisps of Spain and
Toreadors, Corea moved into Trinkle-
Tinkle" by Thelonius Monk Much different
than the bluesy original, Core<i s version
bursts out in fits of highs and lows Like a fly
skittering across a wall. Corea teased the au
dience with spasmodic dips into a melody, nev
er giving us a chance to grab onto a theme. Af
ter the last note, wholly unexpected from the
one before it, the audience applauded almost
as fervently and as ecstatically as the sounds

he had just fired at us.
Sparing the audience the sensory overload of
two intense pieces in a row. Corea moved on to
Bud Powell's "Oblivion," gliding over the
keys, quickly setting off one note then scam
pering off to the next. Suddenly, in the middle
of a progression, he stopped playing to stomp
his feet and drum the air with his hands. The
audience wildly applauded the imaginary
drumming while Corea zoomed off to explore
other, as yet untapped, melodies
Of many brilliant and entertaining pieces,
the most brilliant and the entertaining were
also the most unusual. Both his solo version of
"Ishfahan," and his never-before-heard "Dan
cers'' were fantastic. "Ishfahan." titled after
the ancient capital of Persia, miraculously
evoked the image of a dusty Persian market
place filled with the shrill cackles of haggling
merchants. Then a storm blows in and Corea
actually reaches into the piano and deadens the
bass strings with one hand while still pounding
those same notes with the other. The effect is
eerie and somber, causing you to see the thick,
black clouds storm the sky.
A slight problem with this otherwise perfect
piece was his attempts at strumming the piano
strings with the fingernails of his left hand
while at the same time playing with his right.
He could barely do more than touch the strings
and the little bit of sound that did emerge was
less than pleasing. At the end of "Ishfahan," he
announced that he had "hurt the piano" and
beckoned the tuner back up on stage to try and
patch up the patient. Luckily is was nothing
major and the show went on.
Finally, with a series of "dancers," Chick
Corea proved once again that he has the
"fastest hands in the west." With quick stac
cato bursts, he pulled the audience many dif
ferent ways, as he dipped into the bass notes,
then soared off into the highs
After a few more pieces with the help of
Gayle Moran, including Soft and Gentle is My
Love" and "Come Rain or Come Shine." a
standing ovation, and a beautiful encore — it
was over.
Chick Corea tickles the ivory like no other.
