# Jazz in the old style: just ask Turk

San Francisco — I don't think that the ex
perience could be attributed to the
mushrooms — the stir-fried ones at the buf
fet table. So it must have been the time ma
chine I discovered a week ago Sunday on the
no. 19 bus while I rode from Mission to
Rhode Island in San Francisco.
Not knowing how long the warranty on my
H.G, Wellsian device was good for, I de
cided to try it out immediately. I was not
disappointed, for at 101 Kansas Street, in a
spot known as The Galleria, I sampled a
"San Francisco tradition" that rivalled an
It's It. a "San Francisco treat" that sur
passed Rice-a-Roni — I dined on a double
serving of the Turk Murphy Jazz Band.
Courtesy of the TMJB, one of the coun
try's last peforming groups of classic jazz, I
was transported back to the genre's hey
day.and treated to New Orleans and Chica
go style jazz with a garnish of ragtime and
blues.
Turk and his cohorts headlined a benefit
for Friends Outside, a 13-year-old non-profit
organization aiming to assist offenders, ex
offenders and their families. Billed as "The
Spirit of San Francisco," the event was an
all-around success. It expressed goodwill on
behalf of the organization, provided new ex
posure for veteran and up-and-coming ar
tists alike, and drew a very good turnout —
considering it was held on a Sunday night,
and cost $25 a head. A percentage of funds
from sales of record albums, donated
flowers and photographs, all went towards
helping Friends Outside.
Master of ceremonies for the gathering
was Dan Coffey of the Duck's Breath Mys
tery Theatre. He proved to be not only a
more-than-able emcee, but also to have a
terminal case of zany schizophrenia, as he
introduced the acts with impersonations
drawn from cartoons, television shows and
movies.
Among the other performers partici
pating in the benefit were Amadeo, a folk

group from Salinas specializing in all-ori
ginal compositions; Lynda Bergren, a
Vegas-styled cabaret vocalist; and Bob
Sandner, a 15-year veteran of the S.F. piano
bar scene
The evening's main disappointment was
that the audience was not more attentive to
the musicians, a problem certainly not
stemming from a lack of effort by the per
formers. It might very well have been a
combination of the week-night timing and
the delicious distractions (fresh veggies
cooked in a wok and strawberries for a cho
colate fondue, to name but two).
Amadeo had the rather unfortunate luck
of being the opening act, thus having to com
pete with still-arriving visitors. A "cocktail
hour" murmur as new arrivals chatted and
slowly took their seats or lined up at the buf
fet tables detracted from the on-stage offer
ings.
Bergren, the evening's third act, was able
to overcome the seemingly disconcerting
hub-bub at the tables and enticed couples
into dancing to her energetic renditions of
standards and contemporary tunes.
But it was Turk & Co., preceding Bergren
and later returning following intermission,
which best captured the favor of the au
dience. The six-man band showcased clar
inet, trumpet, piano and the lead
er/namesake on trombone, while the banjo
and tuba kept a steady rhythm going. A
female vocalist displayed the necessary
bluesy vocals to round out the atmosphere.
In their first set the TMJB provided dance
and toe-tapping music with numbers such as
Scott Joplin's "Pineapple Rag" (which fea
tured Turk on the washboard); "Papa Dip,"
performed in the New Orleans tradition; " A
Good Man Is Hard To Find," and"Tin Roof
Blues." Later the band continued to dazzle
and win the night's most enthusiastic ap
plause with tunes including Joplin's "Maple
Leaf Rag,""Mecca Flat Blues," from Chi
cago's jazz roots, and "Hot Time In The Old
Town Tonight."
As delightful as it was to see the TMJB

steal the show at The Galleria, I couldn't
help but imagine what it must be like to
catch Murphy on his own turf, Earthquake
McGoon's. where he plays to a more ap
preciative audience. Murphy, who has rec
orded over 25 albums during his career, said
that he and his band will be on a European
tour during early and mid-May and a St.
Louis trip the third week of June. But when
in San Francisco. TMJB calls McGoon's
home.

Home as it is to a variety of uses, the
Galleria itself proved one of the most in
teresting aspects of the evening. Imagine, if
you can, a cross between the S.F. Opera
House, with its tiers opening to the mair\,
stage, and the rustic brick setting of The
Cannery or Ghirardelli Square. This ap
parent contradiction in architecture suc
ceeds in practice, if not in theory. The result
is a pleasing blend of dining and socializing
privacy along the perimeter of the
auditorium, with the openness of the dance
floor and main stage as a focal point. The
brick walls that edge the room serve as a
plain canvas for a great deal of visual varie
ty: potted plants (from daisies to palms), a
glass elevator, benches carved from giant
redwoods, and a marquee-like lighting pat
tern bring attention to the graceful steel col
umns and beams.
Like The Cannery or Ghirardelli Square
complexes, The Galleria blends functions,
with office space located in wings branching
out from the entertainment hall. The heart
of the facility served admirably in its role as
a combination lounge, restaurant and con
cert hall. Along with the work of the or
ganizers and the talent of the entertain:
ment, the impressive surroundings in this
center displayed the underlying "Spirit of
San Francisco," an appropriate title for
Friends Outside's grand gathering. (Thi>

tists alike, and drew a very good turnout —
considering it was held on a Sunday night,
and cost $25 a head. A percentage of funds
from sales of record albums, donated
flowers and photographs, all went towards
helping Friends Outside.
Master of ceremonies for the gathering
was Dan Coffey of the Duck's Breath Mys
tery Theatre. He proved to be not only a
more-than-able emcee, but also to have a
terminal case of zany schizophrenia, as he
introduced the acts with impersonations
drawn from cartoons, television shows and
movies.
Among the other performers partici
pating in the benefit were Amadeo, a folk

group from Salinas specializing in all-ori
ginal compositions; Lynda Bergren, a
Vegas-styled cabaret vocalist; and Bob
Sandner, a 15-year veteran of the S.F. piano
bar scene
The evening's main disappointment was
that the audience was not more attentive to
the musicians, a problem certainly not
stemming from a lack of effort by the per
formers. It might very well have been a
combination of the week-night timing and
the delicious distractions (fresh veggies
cooked in a wok and strawberries for a cho
colate fondue, to name but two).
Amadeo had the rather unfortunate luck
of being the opening act, thus having to com
pete with still-arriving visitors. A "cocktail
hour" murmur as new arrivals chatted and
slowly took their seats or lined up at the buf
fet tables detracted from the on-stage offer
ings.
Bergren, the evening's third act, was able
to overcome the seemingly disconcerting
hub-bub at the tables and enticed couples
into dancing to her energetic renditions of
standards and contemporary tunes.
But it was Turk & Co., preceding Bergren
and later returning following intermission,
which best captured the favor of the au
dience. The six-man band showcased clar
inet, trumpet, piano and the lead
er/namesake on trombone, while the banjo
and tuba kept a steady rhythm going. A
female vocalist displayed the necessary
bluesy vocals to round out the atmosphere.
In their first set the TMJB provided dance
and toe-tapping music with numbers such as
Scott Joplin's "Pineapple Rag" (which fea
tured Turk on the washboard); "Papa Dip,"
performed in the New Orleans tradition; " A
Good Man Is Hard To Find," and"Tin Roof
Blues." Later the band continued to dazzle
and win the night's most enthusiastic ap
plause with tunes including Joplin's "Maple
Leaf Rag,""Mecca Flat Blues," from Chi
cago's jazz roots, and "Hot Time In The Old
Town Tonight."
As delightful as it was to see the TMJB

steal the show at The Galleria, I couldn't
help but imagine what it must be like to
catch Murphy on his own turf, Earthquake
McGoon's. where he plays to a more ap
preciative audience. Murphy, who has rec
orded over 25 albums during his career, said
that he and his band will be on a European
tour during early and mid-May and a St.
Louis trip the third week of June. But when
in San Francisco. TMJB calls McGoon's
home.

Home as it is to a variety of uses, the
Galleria itself proved one of the most in
teresting aspects of the evening. Imagine, if
you can, a cross between the S.F. Opera
House, with its tiers opening to the mair\,
stage, and the rustic brick setting of The
Cannery or Ghirardelli Square. This ap
parent contradiction in architecture suc
ceeds in practice, if not in theory. The result
is a pleasing blend of dining and socializing
privacy along the perimeter of the
auditorium, with the openness of the dance
floor and main stage as a focal point. The
brick walls that edge the room serve as a
plain canvas for a great deal of visual varie
ty: potted plants (from daisies to palms), a
glass elevator, benches carved from giant
redwoods, and a marquee-like lighting pat
tern bring attention to the graceful steel col
umns and beams.
Like The Cannery or Ghirardelli Square
complexes, The Galleria blends functions,
with office space located in wings branching
out from the entertainment hall. The heart
of the facility served admirably in its role as
a combination lounge, restaurant and con
cert hall. Along with the work of the or
ganizers and the talent of the entertain:
ment, the impressive surroundings in this
center displayed the underlying "Spirit of
San Francisco," an appropriate title for
Friends Outside's grand gathering. (Thi>

San Francisco — I don't think that the ex
perience could be attributed to the
mushrooms — the stir-fried ones at the buf
fet table. So it must have been the time ma
chine I discovered a week ago Sunday on the
no. 19 bus while I rode from Mission to
Rhode Island in San Francisco.
Not knowing how long the warranty on my
H.G, Wellsian device was good for, I de
cided to try it out immediately. I was not
disappointed, for at 101 Kansas Street, in a
spot known as The Galleria, I sampled a
"San Francisco tradition" that rivalled an
It's It. a "San Francisco treat" that sur
passed Rice-a-Roni — I dined on a double
serving of the Turk Murphy Jazz Band.
Courtesy of the TMJB, one of the coun
try's last peforming groups of classic jazz, I
was transported back to the genre's hey
day.and treated to New Orleans and Chica

blues.
Turk and his cohorts headlined a benefit
for Friends Outside, a 13-year-old non-profit
organization aiming to assist offenders, ex
offenders and their families. Billed as "The
