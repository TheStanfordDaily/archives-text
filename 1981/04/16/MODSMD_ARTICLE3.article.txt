# Reagan advocates tax relief as nation files

### Los Angeles Times 
The Reagan administration fired
back at tax critics yesterday, with the
president saying Americans are over
taxed and Vice President Bush sug
gesting Reagan might veto a tax cut
bill that deviates too much from his
three-year, across-the-board pro
posal.
Bush said the president was "in no
mood to compromise" with Demo
crats who would rather cut taxes one
year at a time and in a smaller amount
than the president has proposed. "I
think the president would probably
(veto) that," he said.
President Ronald Reagan seized the
occasion of yesterday's income tax fil
ing deadline to make his point that
Americans pay too much. He said
April 15 "reminds us that taxpayers
pay too much of their earnings to the
federal government."
Reagan appealed to Americans to
tell their congressmen, now at home
for the Easter recess, that taxes
should be cut. "Today is a day when
the people reaffirm their commitment
to our system by contributing a por
tion of their income to the government
. . . but today (Americans) should
make it clear to all elected officials
that government has gone beyond its
bounds and that the people will not to
lerate the ever-increasing tax burden
they experienced in recent years."
The administration has been put on
the defensive as the Democratic-con
trolled House moves toward drawing
up a tax bill. The president has made
clear that he does not intend to begin
compromising on his tax plan yet, but
congressional sources believe his pro
posal cannot win support in the tax
writing Ways and Means Committee.
Budget Committee Chairman
James Jones (D-Oklahoma), yester
day repeated that three Treasury of
ficials who spoke to him last week said
they were "flexible" about the future
years of the tax program.

The administration has denied that
the three — undersecretary for taxes
Norman Ture and his assistant secre
tary, John Chapaton, and deputy assis
tant tor legislative affairs Bruce
Thompson — talked of compromise af
ter the president said he had author
ized no offer of legislative com
promise.
Jones Wednesday said it was "as
tounding" that the administration was
"now taking the position that there
can be no compromise."
He warned "such an attitude could
undermine the chances" that tax and
spending measures will be moved
"along the fast schedule we have set."
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Il
linois), last week proposed a one-year
tax cut bill, significantly different
from the three-year, across-the-board
cuts in the Reagan plan. Rostenkowski
said he hoped his plan would be a basis
for consensus, and he thought both
Democrats and Republicans would
support it in the committee.
Another flurry over the adminis
tration's position on tax compromise
came yesterday with a report, later
denied, that ranking Ways and Means
Republican Barber Conable Jr. had
last month advised the president to
compromise.
Conable said at a conference re
ported by Associated Press that Rea
gan will "win less than 10 percent" an
nual cuts in personal tax rates. "I
think there are going to be some
targeted savings plans," he said. Con
able later denied, however, that he
had told the president to compromise
earlier.
"I have not offered the president
that advice... I mentioned it as an op
tion. The president indicated clearly
that he was not about to compromise
at this time," Conable said in a
statement released by his office yes

terday.
Administration officials argue that
cuts in marginal tax rates of the kind
they propose are essential to boost in
centives to work, save and invest. This
is one reason for their unwillingness to
compromise on the nature and timing
of their tax plan.
But figures released yesterday by
the Treasury Department suggest
that even after enactment of the full

Reagan plan, a family of four, now
earning about $28,300 would face a
marginal tax rate in 1984 of 23 percent
— onlv 1 percentage point less than in
1980.
This is because inflation pushes peo
ple into higher tax brackets when their
income rises to keep pace with higher
prices. Without any tax cut, marginal
rates would rise substantially for all
income groups

tax cut bill, significantly different
from the three-year, across-the-board
cuts in the Reagan plan. Rostenkowski
said he hoped his plan would be a basis
for consensus, and he thought both
Democrats and Republicans would
support it in the committee.
Another flurry over the adminis
tration's position on tax compromise
came yesterday with a report, later
denied, that ranking Ways and Means
Republican Barber Conable Jr. had
last month advised the president to
compromise.
Conable said at a conference re
ported by Associated Press that Rea
gan will "win less than 10 percent" an
nual cuts in personal tax rates. "I
think there are going to be some
targeted savings plans," he said. Con
able later denied, however, that he
had told the president to compromise
earlier.
"I have not offered the president
that advice... I mentioned it as an op
tion. The president indicated clearly
that he was not about to compromise
at this time," Conable said in a
statement released by his office yes

terday.
Administration officials argue that
cuts in marginal tax rates of the kind
they propose are essential to boost in
centives to work, save and invest. This
is one reason for their unwillingness to
compromise on the nature and timing
of their tax plan.
But figures released yesterday by
the Treasury Department suggest
that even after enactment of the full

Reagan plan, a family of four, now
earning about $28,300 would face a
marginal tax rate in 1984 of 23 percent
— onlv 1 percentage point less than in
1980.
This is because inflation pushes peo
ple into higher tax brackets when their
income rises to keep pace with higher
prices. Without any tax cut, marginal
rates would rise substantially for all
income groups
The Reagan administration fired
back at tax critics yesterday, with the
president saying Americans are over
taxed and Vice President Bush sug
gesting Reagan might veto a tax cut
bill that deviates too much from his
three-year, across-the-board pro
posal.
Bush said the president was "in no
mood to compromise" with Demo
crats who would rather cut taxes one
year at a time and in a smaller amount
than the president has proposed. "I
think the president would probably
(veto) that," he said.
President Ronald Reagan seized the
occasion of yesterday's income tax fil
ing deadline to make his point that
Americans pay too much. He said
April 15 "reminds us that taxpayers
pay too much of their earnings to the
federal government."
Reagan appealed to Americans to
tell their congressmen, now at home
for the Easter recess, that taxes
should be cut. "Today is a day when
the people reaffirm their commitment
to our system by contributing a por
tion of their income to the government
. . . but today (Americans) should
make it clear to all elected officials
that government has gone beyond its
bounds and that the people will not to
lerate the ever-increasing tax burden
they experienced in recent years."
The administration has been put on
the defensive as the Democratic-con
trolled House moves toward drawing
up a tax bill. The president has made
clear that he does not intend to begin
compromising on his tax plan yet, but
congressional sources believe his pro
posal cannot win support in the tax
writing Ways and Means Committee.
Budget Committee Chairman
James Jones (D-Oklahoma), yester
day repeated that three Treasury of
ficials who spoke to him last week said
they were "flexible" about the future
years of the tax program.

The administration has denied that
the three — undersecretary for taxes
Norman Ture and his assistant secre
tary, John Chapaton, and deputy assis
tant tor legislative affairs Bruce
Thompson — talked of compromise af
ter the president said he had author
ized no offer of legislative com
promise.
Jones Wednesday said it was "as
tounding" that the administration was
"now taking the position that there
can be no compromise."
He warned "such an attitude could
undermine the chances" that tax and
spending measures will be moved
"along the fast schedule we have set."
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Il
linois), last week proposed a one-year
tax cut bill, significantly different
from the three-year, across-the-board
cuts in the Reagan plan. Rostenkowski
said he hoped his plan would be a basis
for consensus, and he thought both
Democrats and Republicans would
support it in the committee.
