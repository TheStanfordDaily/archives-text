### Los Angeles Times 
The Reagan administration fired
back at tax critics yesterday, with the
president saying Americans are over
taxed and Vice President Bush sug
gesting Reagan might veto a tax cut
bill that deviates too much from his
three-year, across-the-board pro

Bush said the president was "in no
mood to compromise" with Demo

congressional sources believe his pro
posal cannot win support in the tax

Budget Committee Chairman
James Jones (D-Oklahoma), yester

they were "flexible" about the future
years of the tax program.

The administration has denied that
the three — undersecretary for taxes
Norman Ture and his assistant secre
tary, John Chapaton, and deputy assis

Thompson — talked of compromise af
