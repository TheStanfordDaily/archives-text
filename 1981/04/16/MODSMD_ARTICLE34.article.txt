Poor face income cuts
Washington — At least 20 million to 25 million people,
most of them living below the poverty line, would have
their incomes cut as a result of President Ronald Reagan's
proposed reductions in welfare, public service jobs, food
stamps and the school lunch program, according to a study
by the Congressional Budget Office.
The study, prepared at the request of Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) and Rep. James R Jones (D-Okla. ) shows
that changes in those four programs alone would mean
cuts for up to one American in 10. Among the hardest hit
would be low-income female-headed families, particular
ly non-white.
The CBO said that even these figures "considerably un
derstate" the real impact of Reagan's budget because his
proposals to reduce Social Security, Medicaid, unemploy
ment insurance, fuel-aid and assorted other health and so
cial services programs weren't included in the study.
The CBO said that because of data limitations, it was
able to estimate the impact of only $5.3 billion in fiscal 1982
welfare, public service job and food cuts, and had to leave
out the impact of $10.1 billion in other cuts in Social Secur
ity, Medicaid and other programs for the poor and near
poor. If these had been included, the affected total would
have been significantly higher.
Despite its limitations, the study is the most com
prehensive survey yet of the overall efect of the Reagan
budget cuts on the poor.
The findings are sure to provide ammunition for Ken
nedy and others opposed to the Reagan proposals. Reagan
and aides have repeatedly claimed that the Reagan budget
cuts wouldn't hurt "the truly needy'' but the CBO study
clearly shows they would affect tens of millions of people
below the poverty line or just above it.
"It is ironic and tragic that an administration which pro
claims itself to be pro-family has given us an anti-family
budget which will put even more pressure on the family
structure of those already living at the economic margin.''
Kennedy said yesterday.
"This budget could be the final factor that causes many
more families to break apart. For them, the adminis
tration's proposal is one of unequal justice and unfair sac
rifice. It penalizes marginal families with children, those
headed by women, and particularly those headed by non
white women," he said.
Haig's success in Mideast mixed
Washington — While Secretary of State Alexander Haig
scored some successes on his mission to the Mideast, the
moderate Arab nations were virtually unmoved by his
claim that the threat of Soviet aggression should be their
greatest concern.
Instead, like his forerunners. Haig found the issue of
Palestinian autonomy the most vexing impediment to U.S.
foreign policy goals in the region.
Haig heard both in Jordan and Saudi Arabia that Israel
is seen as the greatest threat to security in the region, and
that any resolution of that fear must include an Arab-Is
raeli settlement on the Palestinian problem.
The terms of that settlement, from an Arab viewpoint,
are unchanged: withdrawal of Israel from occupied terri
tories on the West Bank of the Jordan River and in Jerusa
lem, and recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion as the representative of the Palestinian people.
Those are conditions that the Israelis have heretofore
been unwilling to accept, and Haig apparently heard noth
ing while in Jerusalem to indicate a softening of Israel's

position.
But while the negotiating positions of the two sides
haven't changed, Haig came away from the trip with the
feeling that some progress toward a solution is needed by
the end of this year.
The Reagan administration is committed to the 1978
Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt as the
basis for negotiations to achieve a settlement, even though
those negotiations have been stalled over the question of
autonomy for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied lands.
Before stopping in Europe, Haig journeyed to Israel,
Egypt. Saudi Arabia and Jordan to push the adminis
tration's goal of building a "strategic consensus" of na
tions to confront Soviet expansion into the oil-rich region.
Agent's statement 'uncalled for'
Atlanta — An FBI agent's statement that some of Atlan
ta's slain children were killed by their parents was "ir
responsible. unprofessional and uncalled for," Atlanta
Public Safety Commissioner Lee Brown said yesterday.
Brown said his department has "never said that a pa
rent is a suspect, nor would we ever say that."
Mike Twibell. special agent in charge of the Macon. Ga.,
FBI office, told local reporters following a civic club ap
pearance in Macon Tuesday night that "some of those kids
were killed by their parents."
The remark came after he defended FBI Director Wil
liam Webster's statement Monday that three or four of the
23 Atlanta slavings were "substantially solved," although
no prosecutions were imminent.
Bradley wins in landslide
Los Angeles — Despite challenges from 18 people, in
cluding a former mayor he had faced twice before, Tom
Bradley won a landslide victory in his quest for a third
term with the highest percentage of votes ever cast for a
Los Angeles mayor.
With 99.2 percent of Tuesday's vote counted, Bradley
had 63.6 percent, or 279,501 votes, to former Mayor Sam
Yorty's 32.3 percent, or 142,204. Bradley had needed at
least 50 percent to avoid what would have been his first
runoff.
Bradley, a 63-year-old Democrat and the first black
mayor of the nation's third largest city, had been widely
favored to win the non-partisan election by at least several
percentage points, but the larger-than-expected margin
bodes well for any hopes he may have of seeking the Demo
cratic gubernatorial nomination in 1982.
Kleindienst indicted for perjury
Phoenix — Former U.S. Attorney General Richard
Kleindienst, who resigned amid the Watergate scandal
and later pleaded guilty to testifying falsely to the Senate,
has been indicted on 14 counts of perjury, state officials
say.
Kleindienst was named Tuesday in an indictment
handed down by a Maricopa County grand jury alleging he
lied to Arizona Bar Association panels investigating his
role in an alleged Teamsters Union pension-milking
scheme.
Kleindienst, who maintained his innocence before the
indictments were handed down, reacted to them by
saying, "holy mackerel."
"I am not a liar," he said.
Kleindienst faces arraignment April 22.
Phil MacDonnell of the state attorney general's office

said pre-trial motions could last six months and the trial
itself could last a month or more.
The indictment capped a six-month investigation that
started when Bar Association officials told prosecutors
that Kleindienst allegedly lied to their administrative and
disciplinary committees during their 1978 and 1980 in
quiries.
Feature Pulitzer withdrawn
Washington— The Pulitzer Prize Committee withdrew
its feature-writing prize from Washington Post reporter
Janet Cooke yesterday after she admitted that her award
winning story was a fabrication.
Cooke's story. "Jimmy's World," was about an alleged
8-year-old heroin addict in the District of Columbia. It was
said to be based on interviews with the boy, his mother and
his mother's boyfriend. Cooke now acknowledges that she
never met or interviewed any of those people and that she
made up the story of Jimmy based on a composite of in
formation about heroin addiction in Washington gleaned
from various social workers and other sources.
Her admission followed revelations that certain claims
she had made in an autobiographical report to the Pulitzer
authorities also were false.

Cooke resigned from the Post yesterday.
"It is a tragedy that someone as talented and promising
as Janet Cooke, with everything going for her, felt that she
had to falsify the facts," said Benjamin Bradley, ex
ecutive editor of The Washington Post.
Osborne Elliott, dean of the Columbia School of Journal
ism which oversees the Pulitzer awards process, said yes
terday that the Pulitzer board, after being polled by tele
phone, withdrew Cooke's prize and awarded it to the
runner-up, Teresa Carpenter of The Village Voice.
