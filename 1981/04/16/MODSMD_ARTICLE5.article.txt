# Symposium on Africa covers food shortages
## 
### Tyson Powell 
The current food shortage in Africa
prompted a discussion of its causes
and possible solutions last night in a
symposium entitled "Food Produc
tion and Self-Sufficiency in Africa."
Part of Africa Week — 1981, the
symposium was the third annual con
ference sponsored by the Stanford
African Students Association (SASA),
which has as its goal increasing Stan
ford awareness ot Africa.
About 90 people heard panelists dis
cuss the dimensions of the food short
age, its relation to Africa's colonial
past and strategies to prevent its re
currence.
Ibn Chambas, assistant professor of„
political science at Oberlin College of
Ohio, cited slavery and colonialism as
important factors in the destruction ot
Africa's economy. He noted, however,
that "ultimately the problem must be
solved by Africans."
"Before the impact of the slave
trade, although Africa was not de
veloped as we know it today, Africa
was self-sufficient (in food produc
tion)," he said.
Chambas also mentioned Malcolm
X, a prominent black civil rights ac
tivist of the 1960 s, and the belief that
blacks must go back in history to un
derstand the problems of today.
David Abernethy, associate pro
fessor of political science here, em
phasized "tradeoffs" if Africa expects
to compete in the international mar
ket, and said that "it may be neces
sary to increase aid dependency" in

order to finance increased food pro
duction.
According to Abernethy. it also may
be necessary to submerge local self
reliance to the needs of national self
sufficiency. "Countries must special
ize," he said.
SASA chairman and doctoral can
didate, KwakuOsafor. called food pro
duction the "Achilles heel" of Africa,
however He said that while food aid
has its advantages, "as a whole.
African governments should do away
with it."
"Africans should grow what they
eat and eat what they grow," he said
From another perspective. Michael
Watts, associate professor ot geogra
phy from UC-Berkeley, criticized the
World Bank for its failure to supply
"basic needs." despite its intentions.
In particular, the World Bank has not
confronted the issue of local political
economy. Watts said. As a relief work
er during the Sahelian drought of the
early 70 s. Watts brought first-hand
experience to his observations that
class differences are the cause of dif
ferences in drought impacts within
members of the same village.
"The burden of famine is not borne
equally by everyone." he said.
The symposium, part of this Africa
Week program, will be followed today
by a lecture on "The Liberation of
Namibia." Tomorrow night's cultural
night in Cubberley Auditorium is
planned as the highlight of Africa
Week.
