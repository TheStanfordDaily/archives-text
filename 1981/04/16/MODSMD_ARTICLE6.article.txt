### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan granted full pardons yester
day to two former high-ranking FBI
officials convicted last November of
authorizing secret break-ins in the
search for fugitive terrorists.
The president said that his exonera
tion of the men, W. Mark Felt and Ed
ward Miller, which was handled out
side the usual channels established by
the Department of Justice, was based
on "their good faith belief that their
actions were necessary to preserve
the security interests of our country."
Felt, who is 67 and once was the
FBl's No. 2 man, and 57 year-old
Miller, the bureau's former in
telligence rhief, expressed gratitude
to the president, hailing the pardon as
a victory for U.S. law enforcement.
Reagan noted that shortly after
former President Jimmy Carter took
office four years ago. he granted par
dons to thousands of draft evaders and
others who had violated Selective Ser
vice laws during the Vietnam War.
"America was generous to those
who refused to serve their country in
the Vietnam War," Reagan said in a
statement. "We can be no less gener
ous to two men who acted on high prin
ciple to bring an end to the terrorism
that was threatening our nation."
John Nields Jr., a Washington at
torney who served as special prose
cutor against Felt and Miller for acts
that they took in 1972-73, reacted an
grily to the pardons. He said he had not
been consulted, contrary to regular
procedure.
"Whoever is responsible doesn't
know the facts and hasn't read the rec
ord," Nields said. "It doesn't bespeak
the kind of values that I've come to as
sociate with this president, of whom I
think very highly."
according to Nields, "there isn't
anything in the world that will ever
erase the jury's verdict based on the
actual facts and the legal instructions
by an independent judiciary."
Judge William Bryant of U.S. Dis
trict Court, who presided over the 8-
week trial, declined comment on the
pardon. Last December Bryant im
posed a total of $8500 in fines, but no
jail terms, on the two retired FBI of
ficials for their roles in approving
break-ins at the homes of friends and
relatives of Weather Underground ter
rorists.
"America was at war in 1972," Rea
gan said, referring to the Vietnam era
in which Bernadine Dohrn and other
Weatherman fugitives claimed re
sponsibility for bombings at the Pen
tagon, the U.S. Capitol and other fed
eral office buildings.
"Messrs. Felt and Miller followed
procedures they believed essential to
keep the director of the FBI, the at
torney general and the president of the
United States advised of the activities
of hostile foreign powers and their col
laborators in this country," the presi
dent said.
"The record demonstrates that they
(Felt and Miller) acted not with crimi

nal intent, but in the belief that they
had grants of authority reaching to the
highest levels of government."
Gritfin Bell, the attorney general in
the Carter administration who author
ized the initial prosecution of Felt and
Miller for civil rights violations, en
dorsed Reagan's pardon, calling it "a
good ending to a bad chapter."
Bell said in an interview, "I
agonized a good deal over the case.
The rule of law had to be upheld The
convictions made the point."
But Bell added that procedures gov
erning secret break-ins in so-called
national security cases "were not as
clear as they are now." Now the at
torney general must specifically ap
prove such break-ins, and in instances
where microphones or wiretaps are
installed a special federal sur
veillance court must approve their
use.
Altough most presidential pardons
result from formal applications by de
fendants and only reach the president
after clearance by the Office of Par
don Attorney in the Department of
Justice, the White House initiated the
pardons of Felt and Miller, officials
said.
"It was Reagan's first pardon, and
it was purely a personal thing with
him," said Larry Speakes, the deputy
White House press secretary. "It was
a matter about which he felt keenly
since he followed the trial last fall."
Thomas Kennelly, Miller's at
torney, said that he received a phone
call last Jan. 30 from Edwin Meese 111,
counselor to the president. "We dis
cussed a pardon and the fact that the
president was considering and think
ing about it." Kennelly said.
Meese, a former California prose
cutor, served as state pardon attorney
when Reagan was governor of that
state and regularly attends meetings
of law enforcement officials as the
president's representative.
Kennelly said that he later sent
Meese "a memorandum describing
the case and what our position was."
At the Department of Justice,
spokesman Tom DeCair said that al
though no formal pardon application
had been submitted, Attorney General
William French Smith consulted with
the president and fully approved of
Reagan's decision.

who refused to serve their country in
the Vietnam War," Reagan said in a
statement. "We can be no less gener
ous to two men who acted on high prin
ciple to bring an end to the terrorism
that was threatening our nation."
John Nields Jr., a Washington at
torney who served as special prose
cutor against Felt and Miller for acts
that they took in 1972-73, reacted an
grily to the pardons. He said he had not
been consulted, contrary to regular
procedure.
"Whoever is responsible doesn't
know the facts and hasn't read the rec
ord," Nields said. "It doesn't bespeak
the kind of values that I've come to as
sociate with this president, of whom I
think very highly."
according to Nields, "there isn't
anything in the world that will ever
erase the jury's verdict based on the
actual facts and the legal instructions
by an independent judiciary."
Judge William Bryant of U.S. Dis
trict Court, who presided over the 8-
week trial, declined comment on the
pardon. Last December Bryant im
posed a total of $8500 in fines, but no
jail terms, on the two retired FBI of
ficials for their roles in approving
break-ins at the homes of friends and
relatives of Weather Underground ter
rorists.
"America was at war in 1972," Rea
gan said, referring to the Vietnam era
in which Bernadine Dohrn and other
Weatherman fugitives claimed re
sponsibility for bombings at the Pen
tagon, the U.S. Capitol and other fed
eral office buildings.
"Messrs. Felt and Miller followed
procedures they believed essential to
keep the director of the FBI, the at
torney general and the president of the
United States advised of the activities
of hostile foreign powers and their col
laborators in this country," the presi
dent said.
"The record demonstrates that they
(Felt and Miller) acted not with crimi

nal intent, but in the belief that they
had grants of authority reaching to the
highest levels of government."
Gritfin Bell, the attorney general in
the Carter administration who author
ized the initial prosecution of Felt and
Miller for civil rights violations, en
dorsed Reagan's pardon, calling it "a
good ending to a bad chapter."
Bell said in an interview, "I
agonized a good deal over the case.
The rule of law had to be upheld The
convictions made the point."
But Bell added that procedures gov
erning secret break-ins in so-called
national security cases "were not as
clear as they are now." Now the at
torney general must specifically ap
prove such break-ins, and in instances
where microphones or wiretaps are
installed a special federal sur
veillance court must approve their
use.
Altough most presidential pardons
result from formal applications by de
fendants and only reach the president
after clearance by the Office of Par
don Attorney in the Department of
Justice, the White House initiated the
pardons of Felt and Miller, officials
said.
"It was Reagan's first pardon, and
it was purely a personal thing with
him," said Larry Speakes, the deputy
White House press secretary. "It was
a matter about which he felt keenly
since he followed the trial last fall."
Thomas Kennelly, Miller's at
torney, said that he received a phone
call last Jan. 30 from Edwin Meese 111,
counselor to the president. "We dis
cussed a pardon and the fact that the
president was considering and think
ing about it." Kennelly said.
Meese, a former California prose
cutor, served as state pardon attorney
when Reagan was governor of that
state and regularly attends meetings
of law enforcement officials as the
president's representative.
Kennelly said that he later sent
Meese "a memorandum describing
the case and what our position was."
At the Department of Justice,
spokesman Tom DeCair said that al
though no formal pardon application
had been submitted, Attorney General
William French Smith consulted with
the president and fully approved of
Reagan's decision.
From the Daily wire services
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan granted full pardons yester
day to two former high-ranking FBI
officials convicted last November of
authorizing secret break-ins in the
search for fugitive terrorists.
The president said that his exonera
tion of the men, W. Mark Felt and Ed
ward Miller, which was handled out
side the usual channels established by
the Department of Justice, was based
on "their good faith belief that their
actions were necessary to preserve
the security interests of our country."
Felt, who is 67 and once was the
FBl's No. 2 man, and 57 year-old
Miller, the bureau's former in
telligence rhief, expressed gratitude
to the president, hailing the pardon as
a victory for U.S. law enforcement.
Reagan noted that shortly after
former President Jimmy Carter took
office four years ago. he granted par
dons to thousands of draft evaders and
others who had violated Selective Ser
vice laws during the Vietnam War.
