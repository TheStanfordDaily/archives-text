## Controversy centers on apartheid African adviser snubbed by right and left on visit 
### Washington Post 
Maputo, Mozambique —
President Samora Machel of
Mozambique Tuesday snubbed
President Ronald Reagan's top
adviser on Africa, registering
the clearest disagreement yet
from any African country over
the direction it perceives in the
new administration's policy
toward the continent.
Another setback for Reagan's
southern Africa policy came
almost simultaneously, when
U.S. officials in Pretoria an
nounced that the presidential
adviser. Chester Crocker, assis
tant secretary of state-desig
nate for African affairs, would
also not be given an expected
meeting with South African
Prime Minister Pieter W.
Botha.
Botha's decision not to meet
Crocker appeared to indicate
displeasure with the adminis
tration's Africa policy from an
other direction. While Mozam
bique and other black African
nations are upset over what they
see as an administration tilt
toward South Africa. Pretoria
reportedly is upset about com
ments Crocker has made so far
on his trip denying such a tilt.
A grim-faced Crocker left
here for Pretoria, with a short
stopover in Swaziland, shortly
after a 75-minute meeting with
Foreign Minister Joaquim
Chissano which the Mozam
bican official described as "not
pleasant."
'Angry'
Sources familiar with the two
sides said both Chissano and
Crocker became "angry" when
the talks shifted to bilateral re
lations. Relations have been
strained since last month when
the leftist government of
Mozambique expelled four
American diplomats for alleged
spying activities and the United
States retaliated by suspending
food aid.
Crocker had routinely seen
the heads of government in Ken
ya, Tanzania, Zambia and Zim
babwe. The United States has
closer relations with these four
countries.
Chissano said in an interview
with The Washington Post that
there were significant dif
ferences betwen the United
States and Mozambique over
policies toward South Africa
and Namibia, the territory Pre
toria illegally controls as South
West Africa.
Namibia dispute
Crocker said the United
States favors a constitutional
conference involving all sides to
the Namibia dispute before in
dependent elections, according
to the foreign minister.
"We are not of the same opin
ion," Chissano said, adding that
most of black Africa would also

oppose such a solution.
The U.S. proposal would in
volve a change in the plans
drawn up by the United States.
Britain, France. West Germany
and Canada for a U.N.-super
vised election for a constituent
assembly leading to independ
ence. The South West Africa
People's Organization, which is
fighting a guerrilla war for inde
pendence, and South Africa
have accepted the Western plan
in principal but South Africa has
refused to implement it.
"Only the Namibian people
can discuss the constitution,"
Chissano said.
Crocker is bound to run into
trouble on this issue again later
in the week when he visits
Angola, with which the United
States has no diplomatic rela
tions. It was announced Tuesday
that the six "front-line" states
involved in the Namibia nego
tiations — Angola, Mozam
bique, Zambia. Zimbabwe. Tan
zania and Botswana — will have
a summit meeting in Luanda.
Angola on Wednesday. Namibia
and Crocker's tour of Africa are

believed to be on the agenda.
Chissano also said there are
"big differences between our
views and Reagan's" on South
Africa.
"We feel the changes in South
Africa are not significant at
all," the foreign minister said.
"The changes are aimed at pro
tecting apartheid.
Chissano said he concluded
from Crocker's remarks in the
meeting that "the American
government wants us to
apologize for having expelled
the CIA spies. We are not pre
pared to apologize for being
spied on by the CIA. We would
not tolerate any interference in
our internal affairs."
Machel was the first African
leader to criticize what black
Africa sees as Reagan's tilt
toward white-ruled South
Africa.
Before Crocker's arrival
Monday, there had been a slight
upbeat note since Mozambique
last Friday released the last of
two American civilians jailed at
the time of the expulsion of the
diplomats.
