# Bangladesh example highlights development pitfalls
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Kelia, Bangladesh — Life has changed for the better
in the few months since electricity came to this village
of thatched huts and rice paddies.
An irrigation pump, installed four years ago but used
only sparingly because the villagers could not afford
the diesel fuel to run it, now chugs along on electric
power for much of the day. The additional water it pro
vides will mean a bigger harvest and more food.
Electric lights and a television set have extended vil
lage life later into the evening, and some villagers are
talking about starting a small machine shop to repair
farm equipment.
The rural electification program that brought those
changes to Kelia, situated 50 miles northwest of Dacca,
Bangladesh's capital, and hundreds of other villages as
well was financed by a small part of the $11 billion in
foreign aid that Bangladesh has soaked up during its
decade of independence. The United States, by far the
largest donor nation, has accounted for $1.3 billion.
F ailed to produce
Much of that aid money, however, has failed to pro
duce such positive results. A number of international
aid officials here contend that only a tiny portion of the
foreign assistance has trickled down to those who need
it most — the landless rural poor.
Most of it, they say, is siphoned off through corrup
tion, which is pervasive, and much of it goes into the
pockets of the well-off, further widening the chasm be
tween the poor and the rich.
The aid problems of Bangladesh are common in most
Third World nations. But the size of the aid effort here,
coupled with the contrast between the haves and have
nots, accentuates a dilemma that has made foreign as
sistance so controversial among Western in
dustrialized nations in recent years.
Help
No one questions the need for help. The problem lies
in reaching those with the greatest need.
Stories abound of local officials passing on only a
fraction of the food aid alloted to them for distribution,
then selling the rest.
Money for many aid projects is often shrunk by the

need to pay bribes, especially in projects requiring
some form of construction.
While international aid agencies are only rarely in
volved directly in bribery, local contractors often fac
tor bribes into their bids, so that, indirectly, it is foreign
aid money that is used.
Members of a team from a government organization
responsible for appraising construction projects re
portedly demand up to 10,000 taka ($600) each for their
official approval. These men, routinely handling 10
projects a month, pocket roughly 600 times the average
per-capita income here.
International agencies
Nearly all of the 150 international assistance agen
cies involved here are based in the few urban areas,
close to the government and communications with the
world outside. Because of that, liberal overhead costs
flow into those relatively affluent areas — the agents'
commissions, for example that are paid on any foreign
equipment that must be imported.
In rural areas, large landowners almost invariably
conspire with local administrators to make certain that
any new program works to their advantage. New ir
rigation wells, for example, usually end up under the
control of the large landowner, improving his position
in relation to that of the smaller landowners.
A 1979 study by the Swedish International Develop
ment Authority concluded that a string of rural cooper
atives established to benefit the poor "today work
almost exclusively for the benefit of a small minority of
surplus farmers, while the landless or near landless are
hardly participating at all."
Discouraging
The inability of foreign assistance organizations to
break free of urban centers or vested rural interets is
discouraging to newcomers here. However, ex
perienced hands insist that the problem plagues aid
projects throughout the Third World.
One seasoned international development official
said: "I've been in the Third World 40 years, and I've
never seen a project that helped the poor without help
ing the rich, too."
He said it is impossible to carry out any program of
' any size without encountering the elite class that con

trols Third World countries.
"If you want to establish a system of rural credit to
help the landless, you have to deal with those who con
trol the credit system," he said. "The choice isn't
whether you help the rich or the poor. The choice is to
help the poor as much as the system allows or give up
and don't help them at all."
No solutions
Bangladeshi government leaders, including Presi
dent Zia Rahman, admit that the problem exists but of
fer no solutions.
A. M. Muhith, who is in charge of foreign-assistance
matters at the Finance Ministry, said that Bang
ladesh's elite, like any elite, "protects its own in
terests, but it isn't malevolent and it does have a con
sideration for others."
President Zia acknowledged that there is a signifi
cant degree of corruption but insisted that he is taking
measures to minimize it. "There are many countries
where it is far worse," he said.
Some projects, such as the electrification in Kelia, do
reach down to the rural poor, but it is impossible to de
termine just how much aid finds its way to the bottom
of the highly stratified Bangladeshi society.
Muhith said the impact of foreign aid is significant
even at the lowest levels, but added: "The only way to
show the impact is with photographs. Carry some
photos of the 1974 famine into the countryside and com
pare them with what you see. There's a big difference."
Importance of foreign aid
There is little debate about the importance here of
foreign aid, past or future. Approximately $1.4 billion in
grain has more than once prevented mass starvation in
the decade since independence. And more than half of
the current five-year development plan is being fi
nanced with foreign aid.
But Bangladesh, like most major recipients of in
ternational assistance, has felt the pinch as the in
dustrial nations have become increasingly reluctant to
contribute to Third World development.
Zia argues that the depth of his country's problems,
coupled with its large population, makes it a special
case, but so far he has failed to change the trend.

portedly demand up to 10,000 taka ($600) each for their
official approval. These men, routinely handling 10
projects a month, pocket roughly 600 times the average
per-capita income here.
International agencies
Nearly all of the 150 international assistance agen
cies involved here are based in the few urban areas,
close to the government and communications with the
world outside. Because of that, liberal overhead costs
flow into those relatively affluent areas — the agents'
commissions, for example that are paid on any foreign
equipment that must be imported.
In rural areas, large landowners almost invariably
conspire with local administrators to make certain that
any new program works to their advantage. New ir
rigation wells, for example, usually end up under the
control of the large landowner, improving his position
in relation to that of the smaller landowners.
A 1979 study by the Swedish International Develop
ment Authority concluded that a string of rural cooper
atives established to benefit the poor "today work
almost exclusively for the benefit of a small minority of
surplus farmers, while the landless or near landless are
hardly participating at all."
Discouraging
The inability of foreign assistance organizations to
break free of urban centers or vested rural interets is
discouraging to newcomers here. However, ex
perienced hands insist that the problem plagues aid
projects throughout the Third World.
One seasoned international development official
said: "I've been in the Third World 40 years, and I've
never seen a project that helped the poor without help
ing the rich, too."
He said it is impossible to carry out any program of
' any size without encountering the elite class that con

trols Third World countries.
"If you want to establish a system of rural credit to
help the landless, you have to deal with those who con
trol the credit system," he said. "The choice isn't
whether you help the rich or the poor. The choice is to
help the poor as much as the system allows or give up
and don't help them at all."
No solutions
Bangladeshi government leaders, including Presi
dent Zia Rahman, admit that the problem exists but of
fer no solutions.
A. M. Muhith, who is in charge of foreign-assistance
matters at the Finance Ministry, said that Bang
ladesh's elite, like any elite, "protects its own in
terests, but it isn't malevolent and it does have a con
sideration for others."
President Zia acknowledged that there is a signifi
cant degree of corruption but insisted that he is taking
measures to minimize it. "There are many countries
where it is far worse," he said.
Some projects, such as the electrification in Kelia, do
reach down to the rural poor, but it is impossible to de
termine just how much aid finds its way to the bottom
of the highly stratified Bangladeshi society.
Muhith said the impact of foreign aid is significant
even at the lowest levels, but added: "The only way to
show the impact is with photographs. Carry some
photos of the 1974 famine into the countryside and com
pare them with what you see. There's a big difference."
Importance of foreign aid
There is little debate about the importance here of
foreign aid, past or future. Approximately $1.4 billion in
grain has more than once prevented mass starvation in
the decade since independence. And more than half of
the current five-year development plan is being fi
nanced with foreign aid.
But Bangladesh, like most major recipients of in
ternational assistance, has felt the pinch as the in
dustrial nations have become increasingly reluctant to
contribute to Third World development.
Zia argues that the depth of his country's problems,
coupled with its large population, makes it a special
case, but so far he has failed to change the trend.
Kelia, Bangladesh — Life has changed for the better
in the few months since electricity came to this village
of thatched huts and rice paddies.
An irrigation pump, installed four years ago but used
only sparingly because the villagers could not afford
the diesel fuel to run it, now chugs along on electric
power for much of the day. The additional water it pro
vides will mean a bigger harvest and more food.
Electric lights and a television set have extended vil
lage life later into the evening, and some villagers are
talking about starting a small machine shop to repair
farm equipment.
The rural electification program that brought those
changes to Kelia, situated 50 miles northwest of Dacca,
Bangladesh's capital, and hundreds of other villages as
well was financed by a small part of the $11 billion in
foreign aid that Bangladesh has soaked up during its
decade of independence. The United States, by far the
largest donor nation, has accounted for $1.3 billion.
F ailed to produce
Much of that aid money, however, has failed to pro
duce such positive results. A number of international
aid officials here contend that only a tiny portion of the
foreign assistance has trickled down to those who need
it most — the landless rural poor.
Most of it, they say, is siphoned off through corrup
tion, which is pervasive, and much of it goes into the
pockets of the well-off, further widening the chasm be
tween the poor and the rich.
The aid problems of Bangladesh are common in most
Third World nations. But the size of the aid effort here,
coupled with the contrast between the haves and have
nots, accentuates a dilemma that has made foreign as
sistance so controversial among Western in
dustrialized nations in recent years.
Help
No one questions the need for help. The problem lies
in reaching those with the greatest need.
Stories abound of local officials passing on only a
fraction of the food aid alloted to them for distribution,
then selling the rest.
Money for many aid projects is often shrunk by the

need to pay bribes, especially in projects requiring
some form of construction.
While international aid agencies are only rarely in
volved directly in bribery, local contractors often fac
tor bribes into their bids, so that, indirectly, it is foreign
aid money that is used.
