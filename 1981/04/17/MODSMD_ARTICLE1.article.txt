# Greene slate defeats H & C line- up in COP race
## 6 assessments fail for lack of turnout 
### Richard Klingler Mike Resnick 
At least until this morning, the fate
of the 17 different fee assessment pro
posals is uncertain because the Elec
tion Commission is unsure of exactly
how many students attend Stanford
University.
For any fee assessment to pass, 20
percent of the student body must vote
on that assessment, and a majority of
those students voting must favor it.
Estimates of the number of Stanford
students vary from 11,104 students, as
listed on computer printouts in the
Begistrar's Office, to 12,866 students,
the figure provided by a University
statistician to ASSU Election Com
missioner Karen Bloom.
If the higher estimate of the number
of Stanford students is correct, none of
the fee assessment proposals will
have passed. At least one assessment
— the Guest Professorship Board —
will pass if the actual number of Stan
ford student is 12,670 or less.
According to Bloom, the number of
students "is probably higher than
11,104 and much lower than 12,866."
She did not rule out the possibility that
the actual number of students falls
outside of this range.
If the lower estimate — 11,104 — is
correct, two of the fee assessments
fail outright because they were re
jected by a majority of those voting on
those assessments, and six additional
assessments fail because less than 20
percent of even this lowest estimate of
students chose to vote on those ballot
issues.
The ASSU by-laws provide for spe
cial elections to be determined by the
Election Commission. Bloom said
that another election may be called,
but. she was unsure of whether those
assessments with less than 50 percent
support of those voting would be in
cluded in the election.
In addition to the difficulties over
the fee assessments, problems oc
curred before the election with the
publication of a campaign platform.
According to Hammer and Coffin
Council of Presidents slate member
Mike Wilkins, the events leading to the
publication of a humorous campaign
platform in the ASSU Election Hand
book was "a comedy of misunderstan

ding."
Members of the campus humor
magazine, The Stanford Chaparral,
originally submitted the humorous
platform for publication in the hand
book. Three of the Hammer and Coffin
candidates are staff members of the
Chaparral.
Then, the slate tried unsuccessfully
to substitute a serious platform.
"There really isn't anyone to
blame," Wilkins said.
Originally, when the Hammer and
Coffin slate submitted the 250 signa
tures qualifying them for the election
ballot, they didn't realize that their
platform had to be submitted at the
same time, even though the deadline
was listed on the back of the pam
phlets given to candidates.
Election Commissioner Karen
Bloom said that on April 6, she was
speaking with a member of the
Chaparral staff and mentioned that
she still had not received the Hammer
and Coffin platform, which was due at
the end of the day.
The humorous statement that was
printed in the Election Handbook was
delivered to Bloom within a few hours.
Wilkins said that two members of
the Chaparral staff had written the
platform and that neither he nor the
other members of his slate had read it
until after it had been submitted
Bloom decided to give the Hammer
and Coffin slate a break by extending
their deadline until 10 p.m. the next
day.
A new platform was never sub
mitted.
At the end of the week. Bloom
agreed to let the slate submit changes,
pending approval by the entire
Greene-Byerwalter-Buhl-Popov
slate, the opposing COP slate.
Not every member of the Greene
slate could be found. Thus, the Elec
tion Handbook went to the printers
with the original, humorous platform.
The Hammer and Coffin slate
thought it had another chance when
paste-up errors forced the handbook to
be reprinted.
Wilkens said that another member
of the slate. Steve Kessler, asked
Bloom if they could try once again to
contact the other COP candidates
B\oom refused.
"I gave them a break and they
didn't turn in anything," Bloom said.
