# Students Against Waste initiates awareness program

Astronomical board rates
have caused concern among the
Stanford community, prompt
ing approximately 50 students to
form a task force to investigate
food waste. Students Against
Waste (S A W,) recently com
pleted research which revealed
that "the fault lies more with
the system (University Food
Service) itself and the collec
tive attitudes of all the people
within it."
Wasting food is part of a cul
ture. S A W. recommended an
awareness program to change
student and food service per
sonnel's attitudes, renovate the
food service system, and dis
pose of waste more efficiently.
Dragan Popov, a represent
ative from S.A.W., described
the food waste at the dorms as
"phonomenal," and believes a
program to increase student
awareness of the connection be
tween food waste and rising
board rates could drastically re
duce food prices.
The SAW. study on food
waste claimed that "if just one
fourth of all students wasted one
glass of milk, it would cost $3840

per month."
Past studies at Stanford have
shown that students waste ap
proximately 10 percent of their
food each year, because they do
not like what is served, are
served portions too large for
them, or feel rushed while eat

ing.
Roble Against Waste
(R.A.W.), a group of students
concerned about food and
energy conservation, has in
crease student awareness of
waste by posting signs on the
dining table and encouraging

students to ask hashers for
smaller portions.
The efforts of R A W. are re
flected in the fact that Roble's
food waste is usually one-half of
Lagunita's. If similar programs
are instilled in dorms, co-ops,
and fraternities, food waste
could be significantly de
creased.
S A W. would also like to see a
program of student represent
atives in each dorm to work on
the problem of food waste. Fun
ding for such a project could
come through Residential
Education, Food Service, and
revenues from recycling of food

waste.
Popov would like to have
classes on hunger and food
waste offered to the under
graduates to increase aware
ness of the problem Film
series, lectures, and discussion
groups for the dorms were also
proposed
S A W. determined that a de
crease in food waste could occur
by renovating the existing food
service system. S.A.W.'s report
cited several universities that
have cut waste from between 15
to 80 percent by switching to
coupons instead of pre-paid
meal plan Students on the
coupon system pay a base fee
for salaries and maintenance
costs such as heating and light
ing, then purchase as many or as
few coupons as they desire
Under this system, Bowling
Green University, in Ohio, has

cut food waste by 80 percent
since 1971. New York State Uni
versity, using a point system,
decreased waste by 23 percent,
thereby keeping board rates
from increasing since 1970.
A more efficient waste dis
posal program could also affect
board rates. Approximately .9
tons of food waste is disposed of
each day at the Palo Alto dump
Alternatives to dumping waste
include selling to local zoos as
animal feed, creating compost,
or biomass conversion. Reven
ues from these programs could
then subsidize the cost of board
rates.

Students Against Waste (S.A.W.) is a task force recently organized for the purpose of investigating
food waste on campus. S.A.W.'s stueles have resulted in recommending awareness programs to
change the attitudes of students and food service personnel.
