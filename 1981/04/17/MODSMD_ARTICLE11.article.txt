# SCIRE: innovative education

Wanted: Students with
creativity, energy, and a pro
posal, who want to get academic
credit for their work.

Innovation in Research and
Education (SCIRE).
"It's nice to know that the
University does provide a
means for students who have a
serious project they want to
pursue," said student Steve
Weeba, summing up the feelings
expressed by many students in
the program.
SCIRE offers support for
three different sorts of student
projects: internships, individ
ual projects, and separate "In
novation Fund" proposals.
Through these projects, ac
cording to SCIRE codirector
Guillermo Nodarse, students
can shape their own ideas into
real academic projects.
"It's one of the ways for stu
dents to show real innovation in
their education here," said
Nodarse. "We help organize and
arrange credit for internships,
special projects, and student in
novations, and many students
here take advantage of that op
portunity."
The internships consist of stu
dents working in the community
with various agencies — health,
law, businesses, and schools.
SCIRE produces a catalog,
along with other student groups
such as Action Research Liason
Office (ARLO) and the Career
Planning and Placement Cen

ter, which lists some of the
available internships.
"If the students know of an
agency that they would like to
work for, then the SCIRE option
is a good pitch. You can say, 'I'll
work for you and you don't have
to pay me a penny,' and often
the agencies are quite respon
sive," he said.
But there are, of course, basic
requirements which the student
must fulfill in order to get credit
for the internship.
"There must be a faculty
sponsor, someone who has
agreed to oversee what the stu
dent is doing," said Nodarse.
"Also, along with the work
there has to be a final product,
something tangible which the
student and the agency have
agreed upon."
Some students said that they
found it difficult to find a faculty
sponsor, but that SCIRE pro
vided a lot of help.
Terry Miller, whose SCIRE
project consists of establishing
a certified chapter of AIESEC
for Stanford, said that her facul
ty adviser has been very in
volved in the project from the
beginning.
Another aspect of SCIRE are
the student projects, which do
not involve an agency, but rath
er consist of work done by the
3tudents on their own. For in
stance, Weeba is designing and
marketing a computer science
game for his SCIRE project.
SCIRE also has a third option,
the "Innovation Fund." A
budget of $4000 is established

yearly to be distributed among
student groups which are trying
to establish "a long term
project that will have an impact
on educational life here," said
Nodarse.
"We focus the Innovation
Fund on undergrads, giving
money to projects that can be
offered to a wide variety of stu
dents," he said. For instance,
SCIRE gave money to establish
the Winter-One Acts, which will
hopefully be an annual event,
and money to establish AIESEC
last year.
