# The 						Stanford Daily Opinions
## Aleen Zimberoff Being an RA: more than a job 
### 
The place: the Stanford post office The time:
around 11 a.m. -after an infusion from the express
window — en route to the Wilbur Natural Foods
line. The mood: frantic. Bike spokes weaving in
and out of the conversation.
The camera moves in on two old acquaintances
Freshman dorm inhabitants or possibly overseas
buddies. Chit chat, chit chat.
"So, where ya living this year?"
"Rinconada."
"Oh." Pause. "Hey, isn't that a freshman
dorm?"
My pause. "Uh huh "
"Are you an R.A.?"
"Yep."
"Do you like it?"
Do I like being an R.A ? That's like asking do I
like being a sister, or a daughter, or a person. Usu
ally. Usually yes (emphatically).
But there is so much more to say about those
two letters (R.A.) than the three I respond with
(yes). And my P.O. box is not conducive to shar
ing my feelings about my tenures as a resident as
sistant.
This month. 400 people are applying for posi
tions as R.A s. About 140 students will be chosen
to inhabit the lone singles in Stern and Wilbur , to
digest the Food Service; to sign their lives away
to 3rd floor Old Union and a contingency of mem
os from Asst. Dean of Residential Education
Alice Supton.
It seems appropriate that one of the veterans
share a few anecdotes, memories, suggestions
and prayers to commemorate the experience. I
volunteer.
An R.A. is a special person. A little insane; a lit
tle compulsive; a little compassionate. All in all,
I'd stress the insane component. Who else would
offer to spend 24 hours a day with three floors of
18-year-olds?
This is no nine-to-five job. I'm not sure even
Jane Fonda could handle "Beast of Burden'' out
the window accompanied by the poor victim of 2
packs of Henry Weinhards at 2:30 a m But then
again. Jane Fonda wouldn't get woken up at 6:00
a.m. on April Fools Davby 30frosh in ties and box
ers serving day-old Hostess doughnuts!
Those late nights and early mornings are the
traditional R.A. horror stories The hypothetical
we pose in interviews to test the applicant's re
sponse to stress and mental durability. Sure it
happens. People get locked out of their rooms
when you are late for your 10:00 class; folks tend
to leave bowls of moldy fruit loops and cups of
curdled milk at the end of the hall; the stereo

often invades the beauty sleep of a pre-GRE
alarm clock
It's all true,folks
It is also true that 4 out of 5 R A s would not
trade the experience for the world
Why? Money? Nope. Units 0 Nope. Sleep 0
Wrong again.
Interaction The interaction with 90 people who
are as excited to be here as some of us are to move
on. is incredibly compelling It is a unique op
portunity to play parent, friend, teacher, hall
monitor, counselor and best of all (in my case*
Freshman. As a senior.
It's like looking through an intellectual and
emotional telescope at myself as I entered the
Farm. The energy is no more powerful — it is just
pure, vibrant, potential. The essence of college:
potential. And an R.A. watches this potential
emerge as a kinetic force; somewhere between
Orientation and Spring break these 90 ex-high
school superstars become adults.
To witness this funny and often traumatic road
to adulthood is to better understand our own jour
ney. And to witness the development from the
safety of a single with the master key is a very
safe and rather enlightening process.
It is not a job. Being an R.A. is being yourself.
Being incredibly yourself under the microscopic
scrutiny of people who alternately respond
positively to your guts and as easily reject them.
Friends wonder in amazement as I pass up a
night at the Keystone or the 0' because I have
"R.A. stuff." They ask about isolation. And. at
times, I wonder too. As I pass Encina on a Thurs
day night or pass up a lecture on Wednesday to
make the house meeting. I pause.
But I have a confession. I love the house. I love
"my kids." I am addicted to the entire ex
perience.
It is incredibly rewarding, challenging and
most importantly FUN adventure.
I'm not sure how much mileage I'll get on my
resume from this "extra-curricular activity;" I
sure didn't make any money this year; I did miss
out on some good burgers at the Goose.
But I feel lucky. I feel indebted to 90 freshman
in Rinconada who taught me about where I've
been, where I am and where I want to go. Espe
cially that time at 2:00 a.m. when they poured the
bucket of ice-water on me. Or was it the time
someone let off a fire extinguisher in my hall?
Possibly the stolen foos-ball table . . .

two letters (R.A.) than the three I respond with
(yes). And my P.O. box is not conducive to shar
ing my feelings about my tenures as a resident as
sistant.
This month. 400 people are applying for posi
tions as R.A s. About 140 students will be chosen
to inhabit the lone singles in Stern and Wilbur , to
digest the Food Service; to sign their lives away
to 3rd floor Old Union and a contingency of mem
os from Asst. Dean of Residential Education
Alice Supton.
It seems appropriate that one of the veterans
share a few anecdotes, memories, suggestions
and prayers to commemorate the experience. I
volunteer.
An R.A. is a special person. A little insane; a lit
tle compulsive; a little compassionate. All in all,
I'd stress the insane component. Who else would
offer to spend 24 hours a day with three floors of
18-year-olds?
This is no nine-to-five job. I'm not sure even
Jane Fonda could handle "Beast of Burden'' out
the window accompanied by the poor victim of 2
packs of Henry Weinhards at 2:30 a m But then
again. Jane Fonda wouldn't get woken up at 6:00
a.m. on April Fools Davby 30frosh in ties and box
ers serving day-old Hostess doughnuts!
Those late nights and early mornings are the
traditional R.A. horror stories The hypothetical
we pose in interviews to test the applicant's re
sponse to stress and mental durability. Sure it
happens. People get locked out of their rooms
when you are late for your 10:00 class; folks tend
to leave bowls of moldy fruit loops and cups of
curdled milk at the end of the hall; the stereo

often invades the beauty sleep of a pre-GRE
alarm clock
It's all true,folks
It is also true that 4 out of 5 R A s would not
trade the experience for the world
Why? Money? Nope. Units 0 Nope. Sleep 0
Wrong again.
Interaction The interaction with 90 people who
are as excited to be here as some of us are to move
on. is incredibly compelling It is a unique op
portunity to play parent, friend, teacher, hall
monitor, counselor and best of all (in my case*
Freshman. As a senior.
It's like looking through an intellectual and
emotional telescope at myself as I entered the
Farm. The energy is no more powerful — it is just
pure, vibrant, potential. The essence of college:
potential. And an R.A. watches this potential
emerge as a kinetic force; somewhere between
Orientation and Spring break these 90 ex-high
school superstars become adults.
To witness this funny and often traumatic road
to adulthood is to better understand our own jour
ney. And to witness the development from the
safety of a single with the master key is a very
safe and rather enlightening process.
It is not a job. Being an R.A. is being yourself.
Being incredibly yourself under the microscopic
scrutiny of people who alternately respond
positively to your guts and as easily reject them.
Friends wonder in amazement as I pass up a
night at the Keystone or the 0' because I have
"R.A. stuff." They ask about isolation. And. at
times, I wonder too. As I pass Encina on a Thurs
day night or pass up a lecture on Wednesday to
make the house meeting. I pause.
But I have a confession. I love the house. I love
"my kids." I am addicted to the entire ex
perience.
It is incredibly rewarding, challenging and
most importantly FUN adventure.
I'm not sure how much mileage I'll get on my
resume from this "extra-curricular activity;" I
sure didn't make any money this year; I did miss
out on some good burgers at the Goose.
But I feel lucky. I feel indebted to 90 freshman
in Rinconada who taught me about where I've
been, where I am and where I want to go. Espe
cially that time at 2:00 a.m. when they poured the
bucket of ice-water on me. Or was it the time
someone let off a fire extinguisher in my hall?
Possibly the stolen foos-ball table . . .

The place: the Stanford post office The time:
around 11 a.m. -after an infusion from the express
window — en route to the Wilbur Natural Foods
line. The mood: frantic. Bike spokes weaving in
and out of the conversation.
The camera moves in on two old acquaintances
Freshman dorm inhabitants or possibly overseas
buddies. Chit chat, chit chat.
"So, where ya living this year?"
"Rinconada."
"Oh." Pause. "Hey, isn't that a freshman
dorm?"
My pause. "Uh huh "
"Are you an R.A.?"
"Yep."
"Do you like it?"
Do I like being an R.A ? That's like asking do I
like being a sister, or a daughter, or a person. Usu
ally. Usually yes (emphatically).
