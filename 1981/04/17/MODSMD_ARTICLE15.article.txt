## Draft danger real, so now it's time to think 
### 
Somebody told me recently
that draft registration had noth
ing to do with a draft. I wish I
could take his word for it, but it
just doesn't look that way.
Perhaps he didn't know that
Senator Ernest Hollings (D.,
S.C.) has introduced a bill which
would reinstate the draft for
men aged 18 to 22, calling for
nine months of active service
possibly followed by reserve
duty.
Perhaps he didn't know that
the Selective Service System
has already started circulating
appllcatoins for local draft
boards.
Perhaps he didn't know that
the Selective Service System Is
already collecting names ot
those non-registrants who went
public or were informed on, and
either already has or will soon
start gathering names of other,
private, non-registrants.
Perhaps he didn't know that
President Ronald Reagan, after
including opposition to regis
tration and the draft in his cam

paign. has said absolutely noth
ing about either since he has
been in office.
The government is not
playing soft-ball. And it is not
hard to comprehend why. Our
new administration has dedi
cated itself to restoring Ameri
can "credibility" abroad, and
the opinion is pervasive that
credibility means military
strength. Thus if the govern
ment decides a draft is neces
sary for our credibility, there is
likely to be one Remember that
registration was supposed to be
a "credible" response to the So
viet invasion of Afghanistan.
Then, keeping in mind all the
trouble spots In the world that
are likely to call for a
"credible" American response,
try to convince yourself that
"it's only registration,"
I was one of the people with
Stanford against Conscription
(SAC) who helped put mock in
duction notices in the mailboxes
of hundreds of students on cam
pus. And although I certainly

can't deny that it was a "public
ity stunt," in the sense that it
announced a march and a meet
ing, it was far more than just a
publicity stunt. It was meant as
a stimulus to get people thinking
about the very real possibility of
a draft. We reached a large
number of people; we pleased
some, scared some, annoyed
and angered others. But we re
ally wanted to make people
think.
How many of you already
know the answers to these ques
tions:
Of the different kinds of wars
the United States might become
Involved In, do I distinguish be
tween "Just" and "unjust"
wars?
If I am drafted at the time
when the U.S. is fighting an "un
just" war, will I go?
If I am drafted in peacetime,
but at a time when the U.S. ap
pears likely to enter an "un
just" war. will I go?
Are there any circumstances
at all that could make me fight
in a war?
If I were drafted, would I app
ly for C.O. status? (This is a
very important question, as fil
ing a successful C.O. claim re
quires considerable preparation
ahead of time.)
Do I mind if others are
drafted, as long as I am not?
If the draft is reinstated as a
political move (as registration
was), will I go?
Do I approve of the regis
tration of men and not women?
That's a big list of questions,
and I expect the answers are not
readily available, even though
they are strictly personal ques
tions. But considering the like
lihood of a draft coming back,
and the certainty of its coming
up before Congress, they are
questions that all of us who are
draft age, and everyone else as
well, should be thinking about
seriously.
It doesn't please me that the

draft argument is one that sets
itself up as an "us against
them" question. Yet is there
any alternative?
There may be some merit to
the contention that a minority
should obey a law until it be
comes a majority and can
change that law. But a draft
law, since it deals directly with
one's life and freedom, doesn't
seem to qualify for this treat
ment. The minority must draw
to Itself, to protect its mem
bers; the polarization seems In
evitable.
The group that opposes the
draft is not a small one. By
Selective Service estimates,
which are very likely to be con
servative or even false, only 93
percent of the 1960-61 group and
87 percent of the 1962 group reg
istered; that means at least half
a million non-registrants. Also,
a federal survey of high-school
seniors (as reported in The
San Francisco Chronicle April
15) said that 30 percent of those
surveyed would try to avoid
either mandatory military or
other national service. And
there is not telling how many of
those who aren't eligible are
also opposed.
Yet we are still a minority,
and will be treated as one. The
force of the law is not small.
There will be prosecutions, me
dia campaigns, and who knows
what else; I'm sure many peo
ple are at least a little familiar
with the FBI COINTELPRO
project which infiltrated anti
war groups in the Vietnam era. I
am not saying this will happen
again, but anything is possible.
And for this reason, it is very
important to form and maintain
contacts within "the minority."
There may never be a draft, but
there may be one tomorrow.
What will you do when the
real draft notice arrive in your
mailbox?

Do I mind if others are
drafted, as long as I am not?
If the draft is reinstated as a
political move (as registration
was), will I go?
Do I approve of the regis
tration of men and not women?
That's a big list of questions,
and I expect the answers are not
readily available, even though
they are strictly personal ques
tions. But considering the like
lihood of a draft coming back,
and the certainty of its coming
up before Congress, they are
questions that all of us who are
draft age, and everyone else as
well, should be thinking about
seriously.
It doesn't please me that the

draft argument is one that sets
itself up as an "us against
them" question. Yet is there
any alternative?
There may be some merit to
the contention that a minority
should obey a law until it be
comes a majority and can
change that law. But a draft
law, since it deals directly with
one's life and freedom, doesn't
seem to qualify for this treat
ment. The minority must draw
to Itself, to protect its mem
bers; the polarization seems In
evitable.
The group that opposes the
draft is not a small one. By
Selective Service estimates,
which are very likely to be con
servative or even false, only 93
percent of the 1960-61 group and
87 percent of the 1962 group reg
istered; that means at least half
a million non-registrants. Also,
a federal survey of high-school
seniors (as reported in The
San Francisco Chronicle April
15) said that 30 percent of those
surveyed would try to avoid
either mandatory military or
other national service. And
there is not telling how many of
those who aren't eligible are
also opposed.
Yet we are still a minority,
and will be treated as one. The
force of the law is not small.
There will be prosecutions, me
dia campaigns, and who knows
what else; I'm sure many peo
ple are at least a little familiar
with the FBI COINTELPRO
project which infiltrated anti
war groups in the Vietnam era. I
am not saying this will happen
again, but anything is possible.
And for this reason, it is very
important to form and maintain
contacts within "the minority."
There may never be a draft, but
there may be one tomorrow.
What will you do when the
real draft notice arrive in your
mailbox?

Somebody told me recently
that draft registration had noth
ing to do with a draft. I wish I
could take his word for it, but it
just doesn't look that way.
Perhaps he didn't know that
Senator Ernest Hollings (D.,
S.C.) has introduced a bill which
would reinstate the draft for
men aged 18 to 22, calling for
nine months of active service
possibly followed by reserve
duty.
Perhaps he didn't know that
the Selective Service System
has already started circulating
appllcatoins for local draft
boards.
Perhaps he didn't know that
the Selective Service System Is
already collecting names ot
those non-registrants who went
public or were informed on, and
either already has or will soon
start gathering names of other,
private, non-registrants.
Perhaps he didn't know that
President Ronald Reagan, after
including opposition to regis
tration and the draft in his cam

paign. has said absolutely noth
ing about either since he has
been in office.
The government is not
playing soft-ball. And it is not
hard to comprehend why. Our
new administration has dedi
cated itself to restoring Ameri
can "credibility" abroad, and
the opinion is pervasive that
credibility means military
strength. Thus if the govern
ment decides a draft is neces
sary for our credibility, there is
likely to be one Remember that
registration was supposed to be
a "credible" response to the So
viet invasion of Afghanistan.
Then, keeping in mind all the
trouble spots In the world that
are likely to call for a
"credible" American response,
try to convince yourself that
"it's only registration,"
I was one of the people with
Stanford against Conscription
(SAC) who helped put mock in
duction notices in the mailboxes
of hundreds of students on cam
pus. And although I certainly

can't deny that it was a "public
ity stunt," in the sense that it
announced a march and a meet
ing, it was far more than just a
publicity stunt. It was meant as
a stimulus to get people thinking
about the very real possibility of
a draft. We reached a large
number of people; we pleased
some, scared some, annoyed
and angered others. But we re
ally wanted to make people
think.
How many of you already
know the answers to these ques
tions:
Of the different kinds of wars
the United States might become
Involved In, do I distinguish be
tween "Just" and "unjust"
wars?
If I am drafted at the time
when the U.S. is fighting an "un
just" war, will I go?
If I am drafted in peacetime,
but at a time when the U.S. ap
pears likely to enter an "un
just" war. will I go?
Are there any circumstances
at all that could make me fight
in a war?
If I were drafted, would I app
ly for C.O. status? (This is a
very important question, as fil
ing a successful C.O. claim re
quires considerable preparation
ahead of time.)
Do I mind if others are
