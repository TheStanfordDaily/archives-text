## Question fee assessment rationale 
### 
The rationale behind the idea
of fee assessments requires
more careful attention than it
seems to have received from
much of the Stanford communi
ty. While the first group of en
dorsements {Daily, Apr. 9)
seems more tightly reasoned
than last year's, I am still con
cerned by the statement, "The
fee assessment is often the ma
jor or even sole available source
of program financing for these
organizations. Without this fun
ding. several important groups
would have to limit activities or
shut down."
If a group is truly important,
it must be providing significant
benefits to people, which raises
the question of why these benefi
ciaries should not directly pro
vide the financial support, rath
er than the student body as a
whole. As I see it, there are four
possible justifications for fee
assessments:
1. The beneficiaries are an un

derprivileged minority. In this
case, the group might have a
moral claim on the resources of
the community in order to re
dress an inequitable income dis
tribution. This is the idea behind
the welfare system in this coun
try. However, I suspect that few
if any of the groups appearing on
the ballot would put themselves
in this category.
2. The beneficiaries are ran
domly selected from the entire
student body. This applies to in
surance schemes, such as Legal
Assistance; even though you
don't benefit one quarter, you
may be a recipient the next.
3. Benefits accrue directly to
the whole community or to a
large subset that would be dif
ficult to identify or collect from.
This applies most obviously to
the Daily and KZSU. Note, how
ever, that people who never
read the paper or listen to the
station (or benefit by interac
tion with those who do ; see next
paragraph) are perfectly justi
fied in identifying themselves
as non-beneficiaries by voting
against the assessments or ob
taining refunds.
4. Benefits accrue to the en
tire community, either directly
or via indirect "external" bene

fits. This is a tricky proposition,
probably the most widely ap
plicable and also the easiest to
mis-apply. It implies that the
activity would be under-sup
plied if it was supported only the
direct beneficiaries.
Is the viewpoint represented
by the Stanford Progressive Al
liance. as the Daily claims, "es
sential to a climate of intellec
tual growth and development
that benefits the University
community as a whole?" Do
students who don't go to football
games or the LSJUMB rallies
benefit from the band's repre
sentation of the University?
In general, indirect benefits
per person are likely to be less
than those to actual users, sug
gesting that the latter should
pay the difference at the time of
use. in addition to the fee
assessment. On the other hand,
perhaps the nature of the activi
ty itself would be changed by
imposing a user fee. For exam
ple, maybe the community bene
fits from the fact that SCOPE
lectures are free via the induce
ment to people to listen to
speakers they disagree with.
As examples from last
spring's ballot of groups that
fail to meet these tests, I submit

the Graduate Student Associa
tion and the Theater Guild (both
of whose activities I personally
find worthwhile). I find it very
difficult to believe that the
PTR's could not be adjusted so
that only graduate students
would be assessed a GSA fee.
Similarly, there seems little
reason why the Guild could not
raise needed funds by an in
crease in ticket prices of mem
ber groups.
It is time for a clarification of
the purpose of fee assessments.
I suggest that all groups wishing
to appear on the ballot be re
quired to submit a letter to the
ASSU, to be printed in the Daily,
explicitly justifying the need for
an assessment as opposed to
possible methods of self-financ
ing. To spur this reform, stu
dents should carefully
scrutinize future ballots, and
vote against or obtain refunds
from groups which provide
them no direct or indirect bene
fits. Such explicit justification
will help distinguish cases of le
gitimate University-wide in
terest from those of laziness or
the "organizational im
perative." to growth.
