Escondido rent
I would like to make three
points concerning Dean William
Massy's response to the Escon- *
dido Village Committee for Fair
Rents (Daily, March 31).
1. Escondido rents are al
ready at fair market rates,
when measured by rent per
square foot. That is, a one
bedroom Escondido apartment
has from 400 to 450 square feet
and rents for $261 a month. An
apartment In Palo Alto may
rent for much more than that,
but the commercially rented
apartment will inevitably be
over 600 square feet. Admitted
ly, Escondido rents Include the
cost of utilities; on the other
hand, Stanford pays no property
tax.
2. While the cost of utilities
may be high, Escondido resi
dents have taken steps to reduce
energy consumption. These con
servation efforts have offset
much of the increase in energy
prices. For example, in my
building (Barnes), energy costs
per apartment have averaged
only $4 more this winter than
last — despite a $32 per apart
ment rent hike.
3. The University made a
"profit" of $234,000 last year on
its Escondido operations,
though Massy assures us that
no profit was made on Stanford
housing as a whole. But when a
non-profit institution (like Stan
ford) runs a profit-making busi
ness, it may lose its tax exempt
status for that business. That
the profit was confined to
Escondido is no objection. The
IRS has the statutory authority
to break out the Escondido Vil
lage profits from the rest of the
University housing and to tax
Stanford on the $234,000.
I cannot fail to be amazed at
the shortsightedness of the Uni
versity in its graduate housing
policy. The antagonistic at
titude of Stanford to its gradu
ate students surely will harm
Stanford's reputation as a grad
uate school and reduce it to an
institution for wealthy under
graduates and professional
school students.

Grad sacrifice
I cannot but agree with Dean
Lieberman's statement regard

ing the motivations of graduate
students. Surely it has always
been true that most students, as
I did, "go into an academic ca
reer for the love of the subject"
rather than because of the pros
pect of great financial rewards
and are willing, as I was, "to
make sacrifices for their educa
tion." Remarkably enough, this
has continued to hold true for
the last several years, when
there was no longer the certain
ty — or, in some areas, even the
probability — that four or more
years of hard work would result
In the achievement of one's de
sired career goals. A graduate
education In the field one loves
remains a rich source of person
al fulfillment and satisfaction,
whatever occupation one may
ultimately be engaged in.
However, in considering the
impending cuts in graduate fi
nancial support, I find it dif
ficult to share Lieberman's op
timism for the future. One may
still be able to say, "Yes, those
four or six or eight years were
well spent, and the modest debt
I have incurred is not that im
portant," even when one is
working as a typist, or truck
driver, or salesperson, or
janitor — all of these being oc
cupations in which my former
colleagues have found them
selves after receiving Ph.D.
degrees from Stanford. But
when the prospect is that the
four or six or eight years will
expand to several more, and the
modest debt becomes a
crushing burden, I believe that
then prospective graduate stu
dents — at least in the human
ities and social sciences — will
begin to think very hard before
committing themselves to such
an undertaking, given that the
end result is likely to be em
ployment as a typist, or truck
driver, or salesperson, or
janitor.

Why not work?
Apparently, some graduate
students at Stanford seem to
think that they have a God-given
or constitutional right to be giv
en money to go to school. What
about working to earn money to
pay for their education? They
have all had undergraduate

education at prestigious col
leges (or they wouldn't be
here), they have achieved legal
majority and therefore can earn
at least a minimum wage, and if
they really want to study at
Stanford, there are plenty of
work-study jobs going begging
right now.
There is no law that says they
cannot stop out for a few years If
they are unable to work and go
to school at the same time.
Beyond this Ivory tower is a real
world where most people get
paid money for productive labor
(last Sunday the San Jose
Mercury had 45 pages of em
ployment opportunities); I
strongly recommend that these
students stop snivelling and get
jobs! Or join the army!

Student draw input
The feature article in the Dai
ly on Friday, April 3 entitled
"Res Ed to 'Streamline' Draw
with New Procedural Changes''
accurately reported the specific
policy shifts in this year's Draw
and was appreciated by the Of
fice of Residential Education
for providing this information to
all students.
It is important to point out,
however, that these changes
were accepted by Residential
Education upon the recommen
dation of COSS-R (Committee
on Services to Students-subcom
mittee on Residences). This
group discussed these changes
in great depth and made these
recommendations for the rea
sons explained in the article.
Student input is a major factor
behind many changes in the
Draw and is very useful in the
formulation and implementa
tion of housing policy and as
signment procedures at Stan
ford.
It is important that the mem
bers of COSS-R be given credit
for their help in making the rec
ommendations that led to these
changes.
