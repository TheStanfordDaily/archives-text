# Sierra Club launches petition drive to oust Sec'y of Interior
## 
### Sam Rosalsky 
The Sierra Club has declared war on
President Ronald Reagan's Interior
Secretary, James Watt.
The 200,000-member environmental
organization has launched a na
tionwide petition drive, seeking to
gather a million signatures for Watt's
removal. The petitions will be
directed to Congress.
At a news conference yesterday in
San Francisco, Sierra Club Executive
Director Mike McCloskey called
Watt's anti-environmental initiatives
"unacceptable."
"In his first few months in office,
Secretary Watt has clearly demon
strated that he is a pro-development
extremist, a professional confronta
tionist, and a man who shows no con
cern for the protection and en
hancement of our environment," Mc-
Closkey said.
The petition charges that Watt sup
ports "private economic interests
rather than following the laws" and is
"sabotaging conservation goals sup
ported by the vast majority of the
American people."
According to Gene Cohn, assistant
club conservation director, club of
ficials "have met with Mr. Watt for
several hours over the last few months
trying to make headway" in getting
him to moderate his environmental
policies.
Club officials admit that Reagan
has the prerogative to hire and fire
cabinet members However, Mc-
Closkey said, the club hopes to bring
the weight of the public's dislike of
Watt's policies to bear on members of
Congress.
The petition drive will channel
criticism of Watt into a "politically
comprehensible form and will or
ganize people to take action in the next
election," McCloskey said.
The announcement of the petition
drive came a day after Watt renewed
the suggestion that the federal govern
ment should stop running national
parks that aren't of national signifi
cance.
However, Watt refused to name

which parks he believes should be run
locally rather than under a national
system.
In other remarks, McCloskey at
tacked Watt's basis for environmental
policy, characterizing him as a zealot,
whose misguided religious zeal has
vented itself as the voice of secular in
terests.
McCloskey said that Watt, when
pressed by McCloskey to recognize the
immediate need for conserving wil
derness, responded that such time
constraint is inconsequential because
of the imminence of the Lord's com
ing.
Brock Evans, associate executive
director of the club, spoke in
metaphorical terms. The environ
ment, he said, is not like gold, whose
value and price can fluctuate as the
market requires. Rather, he added,
the environment is an irretrievable re
source.
David Brower, founder of the en
vironmental organization Friends of
the Earth and a guest professor here
this quarter, also criticized Watt.
Brower told the Daily earlier this
month that, "We've never been
challenged as we have been by Watt
and his friends. The President and the

Administration are driving on a free
way that leads to a bridge that is out,
and they are not saving us by tearing
down the warning signs. No one wants
unnecessary (environmental) regu
lations, but the future cannot yet de
pend on the goodwill of the corporate
mind."
Yesterday afternoon, Watt could
not be reached at the Department of
Interior to comment on the club's peti
tion drive announcement or its
criticisms.
Wednesday in Washington DC.,
Watt reiterated his views on urban
parks within the national system One
point of view, he said, is that national
parks should preserve "unique areas
— seashore, mountains, high plains,
low plains — so that generations to
come will see untramelled nature in it
original state."
The other view, he added, is for the
park system to provide a recreational
opportunity.
"I fall on the preservation side,"
Watt said, adding that he thought "the
playgrounds should be maintained by
those who play in them. If you're going
to have a city park here in Washington
or in Denver, or wherever, those peo
ple who really use it should see to it."

to have a city park here in Washington
or in Denver, or wherever, those peo
ple who really use it should see to it."
The Sierra Club has declared war on
President Ronald Reagan's Interior
Secretary, James Watt.
The 200,000-member environmental
organization has launched a na
tionwide petition drive, seeking to
gather a million signatures for Watt's
removal. The petitions will be
directed to Congress.
At a news conference yesterday in
San Francisco, Sierra Club Executive
Director Mike McCloskey called
Watt's anti-environmental initiatives
"unacceptable."
"In his first few months in office,
Secretary Watt has clearly demon
strated that he is a pro-development
extremist, a professional confronta
tionist, and a man who shows no con
cern for the protection and en
hancement of our environment," Mc-
Closkey said.
The petition charges that Watt sup
ports "private economic interests
rather than following the laws" and is
"sabotaging conservation goals sup
ported by the vast majority of the
American people."
According to Gene Cohn, assistant
club conservation director, club of
ficials "have met with Mr. Watt for
several hours over the last few months
trying to make headway" in getting
him to moderate his environmental
policies.
Club officials admit that Reagan
has the prerogative to hire and fire
cabinet members However, Mc-
Closkey said, the club hopes to bring
the weight of the public's dislike of
Watt's policies to bear on members of
Congress.
The petition drive will channel
criticism of Watt into a "politically
comprehensible form and will or
ganize people to take action in the next
election," McCloskey said.
The announcement of the petition
drive came a day after Watt renewed
the suggestion that the federal govern
ment should stop running national
parks that aren't of national signifi
cance.
However, Watt refused to name

which parks he believes should be run
locally rather than under a national
system.
In other remarks, McCloskey at
tacked Watt's basis for environmental
policy, characterizing him as a zealot,
whose misguided religious zeal has
vented itself as the voice of secular in
terests.
McCloskey said that Watt, when
pressed by McCloskey to recognize the
immediate need for conserving wil
derness, responded that such time
constraint is inconsequential because
of the imminence of the Lord's com
ing.
Brock Evans, associate executive
director of the club, spoke in
metaphorical terms. The environ
ment, he said, is not like gold, whose
value and price can fluctuate as the
market requires. Rather, he added,
the environment is an irretrievable re
source.
David Brower, founder of the en
vironmental organization Friends of
the Earth and a guest professor here
this quarter, also criticized Watt.
Brower told the Daily earlier this
month that, "We've never been
challenged as we have been by Watt
and his friends. The President and the

Administration are driving on a free
way that leads to a bridge that is out,
and they are not saving us by tearing
down the warning signs. No one wants
unnecessary (environmental) regu
lations, but the future cannot yet de
pend on the goodwill of the corporate
mind."
Yesterday afternoon, Watt could
not be reached at the Department of
Interior to comment on the club's peti
tion drive announcement or its
criticisms.
Wednesday in Washington DC.,
Watt reiterated his views on urban
parks within the national system One
point of view, he said, is that national
parks should preserve "unique areas
— seashore, mountains, high plains,
low plains — so that generations to
come will see untramelled nature in it
original state."
The other view, he added, is for the
park system to provide a recreational
opportunity.
"I fall on the preservation side,"
Watt said, adding that he thought "the
playgrounds should be maintained by
those who play in them. If you're going
to have a city park here in Washington
or in Denver, or wherever, those peo
ple who really use it should see to it."
