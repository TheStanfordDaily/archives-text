## Shuttle success foreshadows busy future 
### Washington Post 
Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif. — The pinpoint precision
of the flight of the Columbia
means at least one more space
shuttle excursion into earth or
bit this year, probably with two
rookie astronauts aboard.
But that flight, scheduled for
September or October, will be
just a second routine step in
what the National Aeronautics

and Space Administration hopes
will soon become voyages as
common as those of a luxury
ocean liner.
Two men who have never
been in space — Joe Engle, a 48-
year-old Air Force colonel, and
Dick Truly, a 43-year-old Navy
captain — are expected to man
the next flight of the Columbia,
which remains here in the dry
clear air for a one-week check

out before being flown atop a
specially designed Boeing 747
back to Cape Canaveral.
The shuttle seemed to have
suffered no major damage from
its punishing liftoff and its
scorching return through the at
mosphere. Budgetary questions
still haunt NASA, however.
The space agency is com
mitted to building four shuttle
craft by 1984. The second, the

Challenger, already is under
construction at a Rockwell In
ternational assembly plant near
this desert landing site.
Engle and Truly, almost cer
tain to be the crew on the next
trip, will stay in space about 4Vi
days. They will take along a
small kit of sensors and other
equipment, the forerunners of
future elaborate cargoes, for
tests. They also will run the first
crude tests of the shuttle's me
chanical arm, which eventually
will reach out of the craft to
place satellites in orbit and re
trieve them.
NASA plans to make the shut
tle fully operational in Septem
ber 1982. It has contracts with
nine major American corpo
rations, such as Bell Telephone
and Comsat, and 15 foreign
countries, including Canada and
Indonesia, for the first in
dustrial and scientific tests on
about 50 military and com
mercial satellites through 1985.
The first 52 flights, through
1986, are booked up.
The Pentagon has assigned 14

of its communication, naviga
tion and reconnaissance satel
lites to the space shuttle.
New customers who have
booked space for communica
tion satellites in the last six
months on future shuttle flights
include General Telephone Co.
and Australia and India.
The average cost to carry a
10,000-pound communication
satellite into orbit is $14 million,
less than half what it would cost
using a conventional rocket.
A customer books space on
the shuttle by paying NASA
$100,000 in "earnest money"
and telling it when it wants to fly
its satellite and in what orbit.
The customer must size the sat
ellite to make it fit in the shut
tle's cargo bay and meet safety
requirements, such as not hav
ing sharp, protruding objects on
the satellite that might injure
astronauts.
About a dozen commercial
customers have options for
shuttle flights in the next five
years which they must exercise
by June 1.
