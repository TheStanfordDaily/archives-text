Delahanty goes home
District of Columbia policeman Thomas Delahanty leaves the George Washington University
Medical Center last weekend. Delahanty was shot in the neck during the assassination attempt on
President Ronald Reagan, and remained in the hospital for longer than expected after the bullet
— which doctors originally planned to leave in his neck — was found to be explosive and had to be
removed by an all-volunteer surgical team.
