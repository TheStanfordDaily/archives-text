# Reagan almost died

Washington (AP) â€” Contrary to the first initial denials, the
bullet that struck President Ronald Reagan stopped only an
inch from his heart, says the surgeon who removed it.
Dr. Benjamin Aaron said he almost left the explosive bullet
where it was because of difficulty in getting it out.
The president, Aaron said, "was right on the margin" when
he arrived at the emergency room on March 30
"If the president had been taken to the White House after
he was shot instead of to George Washington (University)
Hospital, or taken to a more distant or lesser hospital, I think
he would have been in big trouble," Aaron said in an interview
published in yesterday's Washington Post
The account by Aaron, director of chest and cardiovascular
surgery at the hospital, generally confirmed grim descrip
tions by others involved and contradicted the first reassuring
statements by the hospital's official spokesman, Dr Dennis
O'Leary.
O'Leary has admitted he was trying to be as optimistic as
he could and sometimes was working with less-than-complete
information.
O'Leary said on March 30 the bullet lodged "several in
ches" from Reagan's heart.
Aaron said he twice almost gave up efforts to find the bullet
in Reagan's lung but "had a strong feeling'' that it should not
be left there. Only later did physicians learn that the 22-
caliber projectile was explosive.
"I think there's no question but that we would have had to
go back into his chest again and take it out," the surgeon said,
"because it might have ruptured and started leaking."
Reports about Reagan's condition have varied. Throughout
Reagan's hospital stay, O'Leary and other doctors were the
most optimistic, stating that Reagan was never in serious
danger before and during surgery. Other reports, though,
mostly from unnamed hospital sources, stated that Reagan
lost about half his blood before undergoing surgery.
Of the others injured in the assassination attempt, only
; press secretary James Brady remains hospitalized.
