# NAACP busing hearing starts today
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — The NAACP took the Los
Angeles school desegregation case to feder
al court Wednesday and obtained a hearing,
set for today, on is request for an order tem
porarily halting the dismantling of the man
datory busing plan.
Eight local chapters of the NAACP filed a
new suit in U.S. District Court on behalf on
more than 200,000 black children residing in
the Los Angeles Unified School District.
Broader than the case that has been in
state courts for 17 years, the federal suit
names state officials — including Gov.
Jerry Brown — as defendants, along with
Los Angeles school officials.
Charging a long history of intentional ra
cial segregation on the part of both state and
local officials, the federal suits could well
launch another long series of court battles.
The opening round will be Friday before
U.S. District Judge Wallace Tashima.
Temporary restraining order
At that time, NAACP attorneys will ask
Tashima to issue a temporary restraining
order keeping Los Angeles Superior Court
Judge Paul Egly's desegregation plan in
place. Mandatory busing under that plan is

scheduled to halt Monday.
Also requested is a temporary order
maintaining the funding, quantity and quali
ty of educational programs, despite the pas
sage by popular vote of Proposition 13, the
tax limitations measure, and of Proposition
1, which prohibited mandatory busing.
The ultimate relief sought by the NAACP
is a permament injunction providing fully
desegregated schools. State and local of
ficials would be required to develop for the
court's review plans capable of effecting
such desegregation.
No remedy proposed
Thomas Atkins, national general counsel
for the NAACP, told a news conference at
the Greater Los Angeles Press Club that no
specific remedy has yet been proposed. He
said liability on the part of the defendants
must be proved first.
"They ain't going to wear us down,"
Atkins said.
Atkins said that it is an "insult to our in
telligence" to suggest that long-standing ra
cial segregation in the schools is a conse
quence of neighborhood patterns.
"We will ask the federal courts to put a
stop to it,"he added. "In federal

courtrooms equal justice under the law is
not subject to the whims of a rampant ma
jority operating at the polls."
Challenge Prop. 1
Atkins said the federal suit will directly
challenge the constitutionality of Proposi
tion 1, which the state Court of Appeal has
upheld and the state Supreme Court has de
clined to review.
Named as defendants are the Los Angeles
Unified School District and its Board of
Education, district Supt. William Johnston,
the state Board of Education, the state De
partment of Education, state Supt. Wilson
Riles and Brown.
The suit charges that the defendants
"have resisted each and every effort by ju
dicial authorities to dismantle racial segre
gation and to end the pervasive racial dis
crimination practiced" in the Los Angeles
district.
'Dogged determination'
"Indeed, in the annals of school de
segregation law, there may be no equal to
these defendants in the dogged de
termination with which they have sought to
defend segregation and discrimination at all
costs." the complaint alleges.
