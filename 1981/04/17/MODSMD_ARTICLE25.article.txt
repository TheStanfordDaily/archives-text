# To face UCLA, no.1-ranked USC
## Women net set jet to L.A. 
### Steve Odell 
Most sports are defined as
being "games of inches." How
ever, when the Stanford wom
en's tennis team travels south to
play UCLA and top-ranked USC
this weekend, their success
quite possibly could be meas
ured best by feet.
Susy Jaeger's feet, that is.
The freshman wunderkind
from Lincolnshire, Illinois, has
been hampered throughout her
career by sore tootsies, and the
many specialists that have
checked her out cannot seem to
put an end to the problem.
The last time Stanford played
the two-time AIAW defending
champion Trojans was for the
NIKE Invitational title, and
they were without the services
of Jaeger, who was on the side
lines because of her feet. One
doubts if it would have made
any difference, though, as the
Cards were obliterated, 7-2, and
failed to take even one set, let
alone an individual match, in
singles.
That was then, however, and
this is now, as Stanford coach
Frank Brennan is quick to point
out. "At NIKE, our freshman
only had five matches under
their belt, while most of the oth
er teams had around 14," he
said. "They are that much more
mature now. As for the older
girls — Donna (Rubin), Alycia
(Moulton), and Caryn
(Copeland) — they played well
the whole tournament."

"The number one problem is
Jaeger s feet," Brennan ad
mitted. "Without them, we'll
lose. And even with them, we
might not doit."
What, then, will it take to beat
the Trojans, who haven't even
been threatened once in the last
two years? "Everyone has to
play well,'' the second-year
coach said. "We are one out of
two teams in the nation that can
beat them (along with UCLA).
But we have to be at full
strength."
The next question is, will
Jaeger play, and will she be able
to play up to her capabilities? "I
think she's going to be'ready,"
Brennan said. "She's also
playing well, so it could be a dif
ference. She'll definitely play
against UCLA. How much good
her foot will be after pounding
on it all day,(and whether she'll
be able to play against USC), I
just don't know."
The Cards will play the No. 3
ranked Bruins first, today at
1:30. The last time the two
teams met was at NIKE also,
and it was a classic affair.
After singles it was three-all,
and it ended up coming down to
the final doubles, with Michelle
Weiss and Rubin coming from
behind to beat Karen Huebner
and Karen Dewis at number
three - 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.
But it wasn't as though that
was an unusual type of ending
when these two go head-to-head.
Last year, the teams battled

each other three times to a 5-4
final score, with Stanford win
ning twice.
In the match in Westwood, the
Cards again won in the final
doubles, but this time it was
Copeland and Rubin winning in
a three-setter. Up here, the
Bruins put on a tremendous
comeback, being down 4-2 after
the singles, and then sweeping
all three doubles matches to
clinch the victory.
Brennan doesn't think playing
UCLA before USC will cause his
team to look past the Bruins. "I
don't think it will be a prob
lem," he said. "They have a
great deal of respect for UCLA.
They'll be ready."
"UCLA has good depth, good
players on top, and good doubles
teams," he went on, "ev
erything you need to be a good
team. We match up with them
about as close as you're going to
get."
Line-ups will play a big role in
deciding the outcome of this
weekend's matches for the
Cards, and Brennan has made
one switch in his own.
Freshman Weiss will play at
number six singles instead of
Sue Rasmussen in the LA.

"She's healthy now and she's
been playing well," Brennan ex
plained of the change. "She's
also been doing a good job in
doubles. I just want to stick her
back in there, and see what she
can do."

they were without the services
of Jaeger, who was on the side
lines because of her feet. One
doubts if it would have made
any difference, though, as the
Cards were obliterated, 7-2, and
failed to take even one set, let
alone an individual match, in
singles.
That was then, however, and
this is now, as Stanford coach
Frank Brennan is quick to point
out. "At NIKE, our freshman
only had five matches under
their belt, while most of the oth
er teams had around 14," he
said. "They are that much more
mature now. As for the older
girls — Donna (Rubin), Alycia
(Moulton), and Caryn
(Copeland) — they played well
the whole tournament."

"The number one problem is
Jaeger s feet," Brennan ad
mitted. "Without them, we'll
lose. And even with them, we
might not doit."
What, then, will it take to beat
the Trojans, who haven't even
been threatened once in the last
two years? "Everyone has to
play well,'' the second-year
coach said. "We are one out of
two teams in the nation that can
beat them (along with UCLA).
But we have to be at full
strength."
The next question is, will
Jaeger play, and will she be able
to play up to her capabilities? "I
think she's going to be'ready,"
Brennan said. "She's also
playing well, so it could be a dif
ference. She'll definitely play
against UCLA. How much good
her foot will be after pounding
on it all day,(and whether she'll
be able to play against USC), I
just don't know."
The Cards will play the No. 3
ranked Bruins first, today at
1:30. The last time the two
teams met was at NIKE also,
and it was a classic affair.
After singles it was three-all,
and it ended up coming down to
the final doubles, with Michelle
Weiss and Rubin coming from
behind to beat Karen Huebner
and Karen Dewis at number
three - 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.
But it wasn't as though that
was an unusual type of ending
when these two go head-to-head.
Last year, the teams battled

each other three times to a 5-4
final score, with Stanford win
ning twice.
In the match in Westwood, the
Cards again won in the final
doubles, but this time it was
Copeland and Rubin winning in
a three-setter. Up here, the
Bruins put on a tremendous
comeback, being down 4-2 after
the singles, and then sweeping
all three doubles matches to
clinch the victory.
Brennan doesn't think playing
UCLA before USC will cause his
team to look past the Bruins. "I
don't think it will be a prob
lem," he said. "They have a
great deal of respect for UCLA.
They'll be ready."
"UCLA has good depth, good
players on top, and good doubles
teams," he went on, "ev
erything you need to be a good
team. We match up with them
about as close as you're going to
get."
Line-ups will play a big role in
deciding the outcome of this
weekend's matches for the
Cards, and Brennan has made
one switch in his own.
Freshman Weiss will play at
number six singles instead of
Sue Rasmussen in the LA.

"She's healthy now and she's
been playing well," Brennan ex
plained of the change. "She's
also been doing a good job in
doubles. I just want to stick her
back in there, and see what she
can do."
Most sports are defined as
being "games of inches." How
ever, when the Stanford wom
en's tennis team travels south to
play UCLA and top-ranked USC
this weekend, their success
quite possibly could be meas
ured best by feet.
Susy Jaeger's feet, that is.
The freshman wunderkind
from Lincolnshire, Illinois, has
been hampered throughout her
career by sore tootsies, and the
many specialists that have
checked her out cannot seem to
put an end to the problem.
The last time Stanford played
the two-time AIAW defending
champion Trojans was for the
NIKE Invitational title, and
they were without the services
of Jaeger, who was on the side
lines because of her feet. One
doubts if it would have made
any difference, though, as the
