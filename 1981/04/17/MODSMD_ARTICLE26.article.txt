# Crew teams' hard work paying off
## 
### John Kosner 
The coach leaned back in his
chair. Then the words came to
mind. "As the old saying goes,"
he remarked, "they really bust
butt!" This wasn't Paul Wiggin
talking about his football team.
Instead, the man speaking was
John Davis, coach of the Stan
ford women's crew team.
And he had a lot to talk about.
This has been a good year for
both the women's and men's
crew teams at Stanford and the
two individuals in charge —
Davis and men's coach Bob
Whitford — are quite willing to
sound off on their rower's
behalf. "Our people have im
proved by leaps and bounds over
the last six weeks," said Whit
ford Tuesday. "I'm very, very
pleased with their progress."
Also pleased is Davis. With
good reasons. His women's unit
is perhaps farther along than
the men's at this stage of the
season. While Whitford has de
voted the 1980-81 campaign to
"teaching, rowing and racing"
and must essentially base his
hopes for national recognition
on an outstanding freshman
class, Davis' women's varsity is
already competitive with the
best. And with each other.
With four ports and five rotat
ing starboards, the women's
varsity is essentially "a nine

person eight" (since only eight
can row at one time). Though
crew is the epitomy of a " team''
sport, Davis is not shy about
singling out his key performers.
In his mind, hard-working
Joline Esparza and captain
Martha Hoffman have really
made the difference this year.
"We use an unusual formation,"
said Davis, "a German rig with
starboard stroke. And when we
put Martha in the stroke seat,
the boat just took off!"
Indeed, in the San Diego Crew
Classic two weeks back, Stan
ford's women took the measure
of more established crews from
UCLA, Long Beach State, Ore
gon State, and USC. Considering
that Stanfcfrd women have been
rowing intercollegiately for but
five years, the crew's overall
fifth place finish was no dis
grace.
The men also had their mo
ments in San Diego. While the
varsity took fourth in the Cal
Cup ("not a particularly good
showing" according to Whit
ford), the freshmen proved they
belonged with a dazzling heat
that propelled them to the
finals.
Last weekend, both the varsi
ty and freshmen were in peak
form as Stanford wrested the
Finley Cup from USC in Los An

geles. The following day, the
J.V. crew —the only eight to fall
against Southern Cal — proved
to be the only survivor against
San Diego.
Beginning with this week
end's home meets (at the
Redwood Shores course), the
schedule really heats up for both
the men's and women's crews.
Tonight (4:30 p.m. start),
Loyola-Marymount and U.C.
Davis take on the Stanford
crews. Tomorrow morning
(8:00 a.m.), both men and wom
en will again be in action, this
time against Long Beach State.
Finally on Sunday (9:00 a.m.),
the women alone will contest
UCLA.
Next weekend, the men will
be in San Pedro for the Harback
Cup against USC and UCLA,
while the women are off to Mills
College. Two weeks later, the
crews return to Redwood
Shores on May 9th for a crucial
meeting with Cal. The following
week, the women's Pac-10 finals
will be held and the week after
that (May 23), the men's con
ference championships will be
staged at Redwood Shores. Also
that weekend (May 21-23) are
the women's nationals at Lake
Merritt.
No matter how the crews fare
in these competitions, there is
no contesting how hard these

athletes and their coacnes work.
The crew season began in Octo
ber and the team regimen has
hardly slackened since.
"No sport works harder,"
says Davis. No fooling. Week
day practices begin at six in the
morning (with the wake-up call
at 5:30 a.m.) and the men's
crew frequently works early on
Saturdays as well. Besides the
practices, crew members lift
weights twice a week and run
lots of hills and stadium stairs.
It is not a training program for
the squeamish.
And yet, no one seems to com
plain. At least not too loud. The
coaches are confident and
gracious despite tiny salaries
and no office space (Whitford,
in fact, organizes the entire
men's crew program). For
some reason, crew remains a
"club," rather than varsity,
sport at Stanford. The students
themselves are — by and large
— a healthy and cheery lot.
"Don't forget about our novice
coach (Tom Brown)," chirps
energetic freshwoman Michelle
Von Tscharner. "He's a great
guy"
Freshman Bill Hansen says
he just loves to row. "Besides,"
he points out, "how else do you
get to see the sun rise every
morning on the bay at 5:30?"
Got me.

John Davis, coach of the Stan
ford women's crew team.
And he had a lot to talk about.
This has been a good year for
both the women's and men's
crew teams at Stanford and the
two individuals in charge —
Davis and men's coach Bob
Whitford — are quite willing to
sound off on their rower's
behalf. "Our people have im
proved by leaps and bounds over
the last six weeks," said Whit
ford Tuesday. "I'm very, very
pleased with their progress."
Also pleased is Davis. With
good reasons. His women's unit
is perhaps farther along than
the men's at this stage of the
season. While Whitford has de
voted the 1980-81 campaign to
"teaching, rowing and racing"
and must essentially base his
hopes for national recognition
on an outstanding freshman
class, Davis' women's varsity is
already competitive with the
best. And with each other.
With four ports and five rotat
ing starboards, the women's
varsity is essentially "a nine

person eight" (since only eight
can row at one time). Though
crew is the epitomy of a " team''
sport, Davis is not shy about
singling out his key performers.
In his mind, hard-working
Joline Esparza and captain
Martha Hoffman have really
made the difference this year.
"We use an unusual formation,"
said Davis, "a German rig with
starboard stroke. And when we
put Martha in the stroke seat,
the boat just took off!"
Indeed, in the San Diego Crew
Classic two weeks back, Stan
ford's women took the measure
of more established crews from
UCLA, Long Beach State, Ore
gon State, and USC. Considering
that Stanfcfrd women have been
rowing intercollegiately for but
five years, the crew's overall
fifth place finish was no dis
grace.
The men also had their mo
ments in San Diego. While the
varsity took fourth in the Cal
Cup ("not a particularly good
showing" according to Whit
ford), the freshmen proved they
belonged with a dazzling heat
that propelled them to the
finals.
Last weekend, both the varsi
ty and freshmen were in peak
form as Stanford wrested the
Finley Cup from USC in Los An

geles. The following day, the
J.V. crew —the only eight to fall
against Southern Cal — proved
to be the only survivor against
San Diego.
Beginning with this week
end's home meets (at the
Redwood Shores course), the
schedule really heats up for both
the men's and women's crews.
Tonight (4:30 p.m. start),
Loyola-Marymount and U.C.
Davis take on the Stanford
crews. Tomorrow morning
(8:00 a.m.), both men and wom
en will again be in action, this
time against Long Beach State.
Finally on Sunday (9:00 a.m.),
the women alone will contest
UCLA.
Next weekend, the men will
be in San Pedro for the Harback
Cup against USC and UCLA,
while the women are off to Mills
College. Two weeks later, the
crews return to Redwood
Shores on May 9th for a crucial
meeting with Cal. The following
week, the women's Pac-10 finals
will be held and the week after
that (May 23), the men's con
ference championships will be
staged at Redwood Shores. Also
that weekend (May 21-23) are
the women's nationals at Lake
Merritt.
No matter how the crews fare
in these competitions, there is
no contesting how hard these

athletes and their coacnes work.
The crew season began in Octo
ber and the team regimen has
hardly slackened since.
"No sport works harder,"
says Davis. No fooling. Week
day practices begin at six in the
morning (with the wake-up call
at 5:30 a.m.) and the men's
crew frequently works early on
Saturdays as well. Besides the
practices, crew members lift
weights twice a week and run
lots of hills and stadium stairs.
It is not a training program for
the squeamish.
And yet, no one seems to com
plain. At least not too loud. The
coaches are confident and
gracious despite tiny salaries
and no office space (Whitford,
in fact, organizes the entire
men's crew program). For
some reason, crew remains a
"club," rather than varsity,
sport at Stanford. The students
themselves are — by and large
— a healthy and cheery lot.
"Don't forget about our novice
coach (Tom Brown)," chirps
energetic freshwoman Michelle
Von Tscharner. "He's a great
guy"
Freshman Bill Hansen says
he just loves to row. "Besides,"
he points out, "how else do you
get to see the sun rise every
morning on the bay at 5:30?"
Got me.
The coach leaned back in his
chair. Then the words came to
mind. "As the old saying goes,"
he remarked, "they really bust
butt!" This wasn't Paul Wiggin
talking about his football team.
Instead, the man speaking was
John Davis, coach of the Stan
ford women's crew team.
