### Sally Jenkins Steve Odell 
Sneaker-to-Sneaker is a commentary written bx sports
editors Sally Jenkins and Steue Odell. Each week we debate
a current issue in sports, usually one concerning the Stanford
communitx in some way. This week we discuss the merits of
astroturf and natural grass playing fields.

Many would consider my position, support of astroturf, a
fundamentally indefensible one.
I have no quotes from high-flown doctors in support of
astroturf like Steve does against it.
But then I have always been the underdog, and have learned
to deal with that fact rather gracefully, I think. I will now ex
tricate myself gracefully from this situation.
It was all Steve's idea.
Astroturf is not my favorite substance, but grass is my
least favorite. Grass takes mowing. Grass grows in dirt,
which turns to mud when it gets wet. Nobody likes a muddv
athlete.
Anyone who supports grass never spent a summer with a
parent standing on the patio, pointing to a spot you missed
with the manual mower. That experience alone is enough to
make one a lifetime supporter of astroturf.
My father sent me a letter in my freshman year that I now
refer to as the State of the Lawn Address, describing our
grass. "The yard, " he wrote, "is Vietnam. Your mother is the
36th Airborne."
"I am free." I thought, as I read those lines.
The point is, grass playing fields need time-consuming and
expensive care. Astroturf needs only two part-time employ
ees, one to roll the cover on when it rains, one to roll it off
when the rain has stopped.
Grass, in fact, is difficult to grow in general. There is this
thing one usually needs to grow grass called "sludge." When
"sludge" gets wet, it smells like you know what. As a matter
of fact, "sludge" is you know what.
That means grass fields are part you know what, too. I like
astroturf.

I can just see it now, a new horror flick in town
"It'll cut, burn, and tear up your skin, injure your body, and
hit you like a brick wall!" blasts the radio advertisement.
So what's the villain in the new movie? Astroturf Rated
"R" for ridiculous. IQs under 17 not admitted without parent
or guardian. Playing soon in a stadium near you
And like most "B" flicks, its sole purpose is to save money.
The easy maintenance of astroturf has made it economical
for owners to substitute the surface for natural grass in their
stadiums. Instead of a full groundskeeping staff, they can hire
two part-timers to take care of the " lawn " But they do so at a
very high price.
Dr. Robert Jamplis was the team physician at Stanford
back in 1954, and held the post for about two decades, giving
him ample opportunity to see the invasion of artificial turf
into our games.
"I think it's terrible," he stated bluntly. "It's too hard to
play on, the cuts you get from playing on it are easily infected,
and I think it causes much more injuries than it prevents."
Dr. Chris Meyers, one of the current Stanford team physi
cians, shed more light on the issue of injuries and astroturf.
"First of all, the game is much faster on astroturf," he
said. "The power and impact of collision are much higher.
Second of all, it is an ungiving surface, and very hard There
are several new injuries caused by it — such as jammed toes,
for example. Thirdly, the turf causes a lot of burns and
abrasions."
"In addition," he continued, "your foot tends to stick on
astroturf. When it does, and you get hit from the side, some
thing has to give. And that something is usually your knee."
An interesting tidbit of information to note here also is that
several stadiums that have had astroturf have switched back
to natural grass, despite the increased care and finances
needed.
When asked if he preferred artificial turf to grass a few
years back, major league baseball star Bobby Bonds replied,
"I don't know. I've never smoked artificial grass before."
Alas. Bobby, if it were only as simple as that.

are several new injuries caused by it — such as jammed toes,
for example. Thirdly, the turf causes a lot of burns and
abrasions."
"In addition," he continued, "your foot tends to stick on
astroturf. When it does, and you get hit from the side, some
thing has to give. And that something is usually your knee."
An interesting tidbit of information to note here also is that
several stadiums that have had astroturf have switched back
to natural grass, despite the increased care and finances
needed.
When asked if he preferred artificial turf to grass a few
years back, major league baseball star Bobby Bonds replied,
"I don't know. I've never smoked artificial grass before."
Alas. Bobby, if it were only as simple as that.
Sneaker-to-Sneaker is a commentary written bx sports
editors Sally Jenkins and Steue Odell. Each week we debate
a current issue in sports, usually one concerning the Stanford
communitx in some way. This week we discuss the merits of
astroturf and natural grass playing fields.

Many would consider my position, support of astroturf, a
fundamentally indefensible one.
I have no quotes from high-flown doctors in support of
astroturf like Steve does against it.
But then I have always been the underdog, and have learned
to deal with that fact rather gracefully, I think. I will now ex
tricate myself gracefully from this situation.
It was all Steve's idea.
Astroturf is not my favorite substance, but grass is my
least favorite. Grass takes mowing. Grass grows in dirt,
which turns to mud when it gets wet. Nobody likes a muddv
athlete.
Anyone who supports grass never spent a summer with a
parent standing on the patio, pointing to a spot you missed
with the manual mower. That experience alone is enough to
make one a lifetime supporter of astroturf.
My father sent me a letter in my freshman year that I now
refer to as the State of the Lawn Address, describing our
grass. "The yard, " he wrote, "is Vietnam. Your mother is the
36th Airborne."
"I am free." I thought, as I read those lines.
The point is, grass playing fields need time-consuming and
expensive care. Astroturf needs only two part-time employ
ees, one to roll the cover on when it rains, one to roll it off
when the rain has stopped.
Grass, in fact, is difficult to grow in general. There is this
thing one usually needs to grow grass called "sludge." When
"sludge" gets wet, it smells like you know what. As a matter
of fact, "sludge" is you know what.
That means grass fields are part you know what, too. I like
astroturf.

I can just see it now, a new horror flick in town
"It'll cut, burn, and tear up your skin, injure your body, and
hit you like a brick wall!" blasts the radio advertisement.
So what's the villain in the new movie? Astroturf Rated
"R" for ridiculous. IQs under 17 not admitted without parent
or guardian. Playing soon in a stadium near you
And like most "B" flicks, its sole purpose is to save money.
The easy maintenance of astroturf has made it economical
for owners to substitute the surface for natural grass in their
stadiums. Instead of a full groundskeeping staff, they can hire
two part-timers to take care of the " lawn " But they do so at a
very high price.
Dr. Robert Jamplis was the team physician at Stanford
back in 1954, and held the post for about two decades, giving
him ample opportunity to see the invasion of artificial turf
into our games.
"I think it's terrible," he stated bluntly. "It's too hard to
play on, the cuts you get from playing on it are easily infected,
and I think it causes much more injuries than it prevents."
Dr. Chris Meyers, one of the current Stanford team physi
cians, shed more light on the issue of injuries and astroturf.
"First of all, the game is much faster on astroturf," he
said. "The power and impact of collision are much higher.
Second of all, it is an ungiving surface, and very hard There
are several new injuries caused by it — such as jammed toes,
for example. Thirdly, the turf causes a lot of burns and
abrasions."
"In addition," he continued, "your foot tends to stick on
astroturf. When it does, and you get hit from the side, some
thing has to give. And that something is usually your knee."
An interesting tidbit of information to note here also is that
several stadiums that have had astroturf have switched back
to natural grass, despite the increased care and finances
