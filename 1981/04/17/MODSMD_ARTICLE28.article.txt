## Silver medalist Yugoslavians invade Poloists back to de Guerre 
### Sally Jenkins 
The defending NCAA champion Stanford water
polo team is three weeks into spring practice, will
face its toughest competition of the upcoming sea
son Sunday afternoon, and will probably lose.
The Yugoslavian national 1980 Olympic silver
medalist team will meet the Cardinals at de-
Guerre pool for an exhibition game beginning at
3:30 p.m., and according to Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti, "It would not look good for a
university team to beat a national team."
"We could possibly beat them, but I don't think
the referees will let that happen, even though they
will be from the U. 5.." Dettamanti continued.
"It's just an exhibition game, but I think there is
still some prestige involved."
Dettamanti was the coach of the U.S. team at
the 1979 World Student Games; the team included
Stanford Cardinals goalie John Gansel and hole
man Jody Campbell, four- and three-time All-
America's respectively. That team won the gold
medal, defeating the USSR but losing a narrow 4-3
decision to the same Yugoslavian team.
The idea of a national team playing a game
against the Cardinals is not as odd as it seems.

Four members of the team are currently mem
bers of the U.S. national squad: Gansel,
Campbell, James Bergeson, and Alan Mouchawar
(alternate).
The Yugoslavs are in the Bay Area for a three
week training period in preparation for the Fina II
World Water Polo cup, to be held in Long Beach
April 25. Eight of the world's top teams will com
pete, including the U.S. and Russia.
"Yugoslavia is consistently among the top
three teams in the world," said Dettamanti.
"This will be our second crack at them since I've
been coaching here, and we want to play well in
front of the home crowd. "
Gansel, considered one of the finest goalies
ever to play the game, will be making his final ap
pearance for Stanford. According to Dettamanti,
"he is playing just super. He's got a lot more con
fidence, he's gotten older, and he's been working
with the national team all winter."
With no evident weaknesses, including partisan
officiating, the Yugoslavs seem to be a lock.
Should the Cardinals overcome the national team,
however, Gansel may very well prove to be the
difference.
