Stanford catcher Bill Worden attempts to "follow the bouncing ball" after it was fouled off by
a Bruin hitter yesterday at Sunken Diamond. Stanford beat UCLA in the first of the three game
series, 6-5, in 10 innings. Phil Wilson got the winning "hit" for the Cards, as he was nailed in
the back by UCLA pitcher Andy Center with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 10th to drive
in Mike Toothman with the winning run. Toothman walloped his seventh home run of the year,
and Mike Sullivan (3-0) got the win for the Cards. The series continues today and tomorrow at
Sunken Diamond.
