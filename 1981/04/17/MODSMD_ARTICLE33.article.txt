# Arizona schools visit
## Netmen host desert duo 
### Ivan Maisel 
The enemy the Stanford
men's tennis team should fear
most is not Arizona State, the
Pacific-10 Conference doormat
that will visit the Tennis Stadi
um today at 1:30 p.m. Nor
should it be Arizona, who will be
here tomorrow (1.30 p.m.).
The enemy Dick Gould's
Cards (11-0) should fear most is
themselves. Injuries and pos
sible overconfidence could
make for a surprising weekend.
Says who? The guy sitting be
neath a Panama hat that can
only be described as Early Tour
ist. Nonetheless, while watch
ing his players practice for the
weekend's endeavors, Gould
didn't seem too worried, either.
He said the team is still re
covering both mentally and
physically from last weekend's
grueling wins over USC and
UCLA. "It's like in the pros. A
guy will win a tournament and

come off and lose in the first
round the next week You have
to be 100 percent all the time."
The wear and tear of last
weekend is showing up in the
trainer's room, where two
starters could be seen this week.
Freshman Mike Falberg proba
bly will take the weekend off be
cause of a pulled groin muscle in
his right leg. Scott Bondurant
has been felled by a recurrence
of bursitis in his right (playing)
shoulder. He said yesterday he
will play doubles today, but
playing singles is uncertain.
Thus Gould will probably
have to go to his bench, most
likely junior John Corse and
freshman Mark McKeen. Not
that that should be a problem.
When the Cards went to Arizona
three weeks ago, they left be
hind their top two players, Tim
Mayotte and Scott Davis, who
played in a pro tournament in
Napa. Nevertheless, they won

both matches handily.
With the top players back,
Stanford could easily overlook
these two matches, particularly
because of the post-win letdown
Gould mentioned. No. 3 Jim
Gurfein said the team is well
aware they can't relax.
"None of us are fully re
covered from last weekend,"
Gurfein said. "We'll have our
hands full — but if we take it to
them we can close them out
(win 9-0) both times."
NOTES — Jeff Arons worked
out with his hometown (Portola
Valley) pro yesterday, trying to
find the secret to breaking a
four-match slump. Even the
ever-patient Gould is con
cerned. "He's got to start win
ning soon," Gould said. "We're
not going to be an NCAA cham
pionship team losing at No. 6."
Change could hinge on Arons'
play this weekend.
