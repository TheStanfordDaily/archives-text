# Lacrosse team faces UCSB
## 
### Gray Maxwell 
The men's lacrosse team
hosts UC-Santa Barbara tomor
row in a game to be played at de-
Guerre Field. The match is
slated to begin at 1:00 p.m.
The game certainly pits two
championship-caliber teams â€”
Stanford defeated UCSB two
years ago to take the California
Collegiate Championship, and
last year, UCSB avenged the
loss to take the title. Both teams
were highly-seeded in the
Western States Tournament
held on the Farm two weeks
ago, but UCSB lost to eventual
tournament runner-up San
Francisco. Stanford meanwhile
lost to Golden Gate in sudden
death overtime. Those two
losses mar otherwise perfect
records.
Last weekend, the Cards trav
eled to Berkeley to play the
Berkely Lacrosse Club at
Kleeberger Field. The Cards
were victorious, winning 12-6.
Captain Kirk "AMC" Phelps
continued his scoring onslaught,
bouncing five shots past the
Berkely goalie. Phelps now has
36 goals in seven games, and is
in excellent position to shatter
single-season and career-scor
ing records. Co-captain Dickie
Taylor and freshman Dave

Gardner have 12 and 11 goals,
respectively, and Taylor leads
the club in assists with 10. Mid
die Chris Romer has eight as
sists and six goals.
The Cardinal defense has
been sterling this season. De

tensemen Chuck Renner, Steve
Kuptz, Mark Melberg, Andy
Shea, and Brian Arthur have
been extremely effective in
'killing' penalties, while goalies
Denny Childs and Thai' Hon
gladarum have allowed a scant
53 goals in seven games.
