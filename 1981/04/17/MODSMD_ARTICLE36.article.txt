/Ursula K. LeGuin and Stephen King, two of
the best writers in the science fiction field,
are only beginning to bother the critics by
writing respectable fiction, and by demon
strating some measure of literary talent:
King with his graphic but effective novels of
the supernatural (Carrie, The Shining, The
Stand, The Dead Zone), and LeGuin with her
graceful, lyrical works that lightly tread the
between fantasy and science fic
tion (The Left Hand of Darkness, The Dis-
The Earthsea Trilogy). Both have
Hfed the bad grace to attract popular as well as
attention, and King's novels have
Been regularly transformed into successful
by directors like Stanley Kubrick and
Irian DePalma, who share his love for ex-
Mflicit violence. LeGuin's successes have been
njore modest, but her novels have
consistently popular among college stu-
Bjents and young adults (the same crowd that
Hnade The Lord of the Rings a hit in the mid-
Blixties), and The Lathe of Heaven was recent-
Hy dramatized by PBS as the first in a series of
Science fiction classics.
[ The beginning Place is a contemporary
Bantasy that starts out in the suburban sprawl
lof a major city, one that some critics identi
■fned as Los Angeles, although LeGuin says

that she had Cleveland in mind. The hero, a
clumsy teenager named Hugh who works as a
checker in a supermarket and lives at home
with his embittered mother, stumbles onto a
gateway that leads him to a fantasy kingdom:
the shadowy land of Tembreabrezi, a place of
clear streams and dark woods shrouded in
perpetual twilight. There he discovers Irena,
a girl his age who also comes from the sub
urban wasteland; and together they set out for
Mountain Town, where Hugh is greeted by the
villagers as a savior foretold by legend, come
to deliver the town from a nameless horror
that is stalking the mountainside.
LeGuin instills the brooding mountain and
dim forests of Tembreabrezi with an almost
breathless clarity: she is at the top of her form
here, creating a new world with the precision
and delicacy of a skilled artisan. Surprisingly,
she is able to evoke the suburban home of
Hugh and Irena with just as much conviction,
although nothing could be more alien to
LeGuin's ethereal prose than TV dinners or
Thrift-E-Marts.
The Beginning Place is billed as a "fantasy
romance," but if it's a romance, it's a very un
conventional one. Hugh has been victimized
all his life by his shrewish mother, and Irena
has been the target of unwanted advances by
her lecherous stepfather. Only in the twilight
world can either of them forget the constant
tension of day-to-day life in the real world —
Tembreabrezi is a timeless place without any

sexual or social pressures.
Unless I misread my Freudian cues, the
creature is a cousin of the one that stalks
Golding's Lord of the Flies — a grotesque
magnification of Hugh and Irean's repressed
sexuality: "White, wrinkled, twice a man's
height, dragging its bulk painfully and with
terrible quickrtess, round mouth open in the
hissing howl of hunger and insensible pain "
Hugh even recognizes its scent — the "sweet,
dull smell of semen.' In facing the creature,
they are facing that part of themselves that
they have refused to assimilate, refused even
to believe in; and it's no accident that the ro
mance between Hugh and Irena can't begin
until the creature has been vanquished.
Hugh and Irena, like so many of LeGuin's
characters, are hollow, empty beings, await
ing that missing chemical ingredient that will
bring them to life. Until they enter Tem
breabrezi, the very concept of love, or of any
emotion beyond vague yearning or dull ha
tred, is unimaginable; and since The Begin
ning Place is, after all, a romance, the miss
ing ingredient for Hugh and Irena is their love
for one another.
Stephen King's novels often deal with chil
dren, particularly adolescent children, as a
horribly potent and destructive force. Carrie
is a teen-age girl persecuted by her
classmates, and when they scheme to humil
iate her at a high school dance, she uses her
innate power of telekinesis — or more ac
curately, pyrokinesis — to bring her torment

ors to a gruesome end. In The Shining, the
five-year-old son of Jack and Wendy Torrence
is given a strange precognitive power called
"shining" that seems to have a little some
thing to do with his father's sudden,
murderous insanity.
Firestarter, King's latest, gives us a nine
year-old girl named Charlie McGee whose pa
rents were exposed to an experimental drug
called only "Lot Six" while they were stu
dents at a Midwestern college. Afterward,
Charlie's mother is able to open doors from
across the room, and her father to mentally
"push" people into doing what he wants them
to do. But the real jackpot for the government
agency that was pushing Lot Six is Charlie,
who (like Carrie) can start fires just by think
ing about it. While still in her crib, she sets her
teddy bear on fire and then burns her mother's
hair; and as she grows older, the power be
comes stronger and harder to control. It all
seems to be connected with the pituitary
gland, which becomes really active during
adolescence, and as one of the scientists who
invented the stuff remarks, "What happens
when that gland awakens from its sleep and
becomes the most powerful force in her body?
Suppose you have a child capable of even
tually creating a nuclear explosion simply by
the force of her will?"
The cloak-and-dagger stuff that follows is
routine and familiar, but King's characters
somehow manage to ring true — they're
always doing the wrong thing at the wrong

time, like getting migrane headaches at the
moment of crisis. King, although no John Le
Carre, has a good-natured and engaging style
that lends some credibility to the plot: he
throws in brand names, Holiday Inns, makes
of cars and other realistic tidbits with great
abandon, and he doesn't spare the mundane.
Of course, no matter how hard King tries,
Charlie's power is no more believable than
Krook's spontaneous combustion in Dickens's
Bleak House. In fact, it's easier to believe in
LeGuin's magic gateway, partly because a
fantasy novel is able by definition to engage
our willing suspension of disbelief, while a
thriller like Firestarter, enmeshed as it is in
car chases and government conspiracies, ties
us down to the real world where abilities like
Charlie's (and drugs like Lot Six) don't exist.
The saving grace of the novel is Charlie
herself. It's not easy to put yourself in the
mind of a nine-year-old, and King manages to
strike just the right balance of childishness
and precocious maturity. Charlie is a believ
able character — she's ashamed of her "prob
lem," just as a bedwetter might be ashamed
of that, and when she is forced to use her
power to save her father from the clutches of
government agents, she does so with great re
luctance and with a nine-year-old's terrible
guilt at doing something she's not supposed to.
King has created the nightmare situation
where a child's darkest, most destructive fan
tasies are instantly translated into reality,
and the most frightening part of it is that
Charlie begins to like it.
