Tar Baby
By Toni Morrison
Alfred A. Knopf
:mpp. $11.95

I The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison's first novel, re
ceived little critical acclaim. A mystical tale
about a little black girl and her desire for bright
blue eyes, the haunting novel re-awakens one's
childhood belief in the supernatural
Next, she wrote Sula, less than The Bluest Eye
but still far better than most of the schlock
cranked out by her contemporaries. But the
crown of this trio came four years later with Sonn
of Solomon, winner of the National Book Critics
, Circle Award for Fiction and one of the best nov
els ever written. The book follows a young black
; man's search for himself than makes Roots look
like an "ABC Afternoon Special.''
And then, after four years came Tar Baby. The
media pounced on this defenseless little book as
soon as it was released. Appearing on everything
;from the cover of Newsweek to the "Dick Cavett
Show," the black woman editor for Random
House whose pen spouts butterflies has finally
found fame.
Too bad the book isn't better Her other works
seemed to have been shaded with the surreal sepia
of the past, free from the chains of reality while
j, Tar Baby is entrenched in the commercialism of
, the present. Instead of describing the flavor of the
mustard, the odor of the cologne or the feel of the
soap, Ms. Morrison writes "Dijon," "Paco
Rabanne," or "Estee Lauder.'' Also, much of the
magic that snaked through her other works has
t lost its power in Tar Baby. True, the parrots
think, the clouds look, the trees dream, but gone
are the women without bellybuttons, the mys
terious peacocks, the answered dreams.
Still, this novel, like Sula, is head and shoulders
above the rest of the pack. To anyone who does not
know she can do better, it will be a refreshing
; pleasure
* The title, taken from the old Uncle Remus tale
;of a baby-shaped pile of tar set up as a trap for

Brer Rabbit, perfectly fits the novel's plot. A
mysterious man named Son becomes hopelessly
infatuated with Jadine, a beautiful model
schooled at the Sorbonne Though both are black.
Son is very dark-skinned, while Jadine is "high
yeller" (light-skinned) As the story unfurls, we
come to realize that ironically, Jadine is the tar
baby and Son her Brer Rabbit. Infinitely more so
phisticated than the Lady and the Tramp cliche,
this strange relationship is only a springboard for
a series of wonderfully memorable scenes.
One scene, perhaps the best Ms. Morrison has
ever written, occurs in a supermarket. Jadine has
just been featured in Vogue, and plans to cele
brate with a decadent dinner party. At the market
she and everyone else in the store are possessed
by a tar black woman with a yellow dress, golden
sandals and no eyelashes. Her eyes are "too beau
tiful for eyelashes." The woman merely buys
some eggs and leaves, but her serene yet haughty
demeanor, her swaying hips and swelling bust,
capture the love of both Jadine and the reader
Ms. Morrison's poetic use of language also
makes this novel special. The beginning of nearly
each new chapter describes some beautiful
aspects of nature that most of us have either for
gotten or never even noticed, and Tar Baby, as
are all her novels, is like a three-hundred page
prose-poem.
Perhaps Tar Baby, in all its splendor, falls
short of the poetry that is Song of Solomon and
The Bluest Eye because it tries to incorporate a
message. All her stories deal with blacks and rela
tions between the sexes, but Tar Baby is her first
novel to address the question of skin. As noted
before. Jadine. the yellow-brown model, repre
sents the tar-black tar baby, while the darker
skinned Son represents the white rabbit.
Tar Bab\ is Morrison's first novel to use whites
as major characters; Margaret and Valerian
Street, Jadine's patrons, are central figures
throughout the novel The tensions between them
and Ondine and Sydney, their black servants, are
particularly crucial to the story.
Despite its many faults, Tar Baby is one of the
most important books to come out this year â€” and
one of the best.
