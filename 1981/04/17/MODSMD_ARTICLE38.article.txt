Circle of Poison: Pesticides

Ever enjoyed a luscious
yellow banana with the an
noying litle Del Monte'
sticker on each bunch? Ever
sat back smugly, glad that
the Environmental Protec
tion Agency and the Depart
ment of Agriculture are
diligently monitering dan
gerous pesticides in your
food? Then Wier and
Schapiro of the San Francis
co-based Institute for Food
and Development Policy
have news for you. In a re
cently published book, Circle
of Poison, the authors con
duct a comprehensive and
readable investigative study
of how dangerous agro
chemicals, outrightly
banned for use in the U.S.,
are nevertheless entering
the American diet through
food imports.
Many banned or severly
restricted chemicals, espe
cially pesticides, are pro
duced in the U.S. for high
profit export to the Third
World. There they are used
on "cash crops," which are
subsequently re-exported to
the U.S. and other in
dustrialized ' countries for

high profit This flow is tight
ly controlled by a handful of
giant U.S. and European
multinational con
glomerates.
The story is familiar
enough. The rampant pro
duction and use of highly po
tent and dangerous
chemicals in domestic agri
culture lead to acute environ
mental awareness and public
clamour for strict regu
lations. The agro-chemical
companies, not about to fore
go high profits in pesticide
manufacture, tailored the
regulations to permit un
restricted export of danger
ous chemicals. Wier and
Schapiro argue that this
loophole is a disaster. The
giant multinationals are now
selling ever-increasing
quantities abroad, and the
victims are the peoples of the
developed and developing
countries.
The authors claim that the
promoters of agro-chemicals
highlight the altruistic
aspect of their export busi
ness: after all, the pesticides
are needed by a hungry world
to produce more food. And
they are able to cite im
pressive statistics to show
the increase in food produc
tion. However, food produc
tion is not food consumption,
and such arguments ring
hollow to a Third World
peasant who can see more
food grow but often eats less.
Additionally, he must pay

the price of handling and liv
ing with these chemicals,
which produce death and dis
ablement. Until 1975 much of
this foreign pesticide sale
was actually subsidised by
the U.S. taxpayer as part of
the USAID Food for Peace
Program. It was only the
concerted action of domestic
environmental groups that
forced an end to this prac
tice.
But damage to the Third
World is only part of the
story. The U.S. is increasing
ly dependent on food imports
from the Third World, say
Weir and Shapiro. Domestic
monitoring of exported
chemicals is lax. Many new
unknown and chemicals un
registered with the EPA are
continually being produced
for export. The EPA is hard
pressed to carefully analyze
and assess the impact of
these chemicals, which are
re-imported in food. Besides,
the perishable nature of food
imports necessitates only
marginal testing of known
chemicals before approval.
Moreover, as some users of
paraquat-sprayed marijuana
may remember, some prod
ucts are not tested at all.
Despite its comprehensive
nature there are some seri
ous shortcomings in the
book. Most glaringly, Wier
and Schapiro have somehow
managed to totally bypass
Africa. Africa has been the

traditional dumping ground
for many chemical com
pounds Furthermore Africa
has emerged as a significant
food source, especially for
Europe. So the omission is
very noticeable. Wier and
Schapiro also fail to ade
quately address the issue of
what role the U.S. govern
ment should or shouldn't
play in pesticide decisions.
While some pesticide ap
plications are unques
tionably and irreparably
damaging to the environ
ment, for a whole variety of
chemicals the pros and cons
fall in a gray area. Third
World governments and peo
ple naturally resent pater
nalistic attitudes of the pow
erful Western nations. Yet
they welcome hard-to-get
scientific evidence. How can
such a compromise be effec
tively achieved? Towards
this end the authors could
have substantially improved
the relevance and effective
ness of the book if they had
included a concise but simple
scientific overview of the
propagation and dissemina
tion of pesticides in the en
vironment.
Judged as a whole, the
book is a useful introduction
to an issue that is bound to
grow in significance. Read
ing it is a must for anyone
concerned with education on
pesticides, chemicals and
the Third World-First World
interdependence.

victims are the peoples of the
developed and developing
countries.
The authors claim that the
promoters of agro-chemicals
highlight the altruistic
aspect of their export busi
ness: after all, the pesticides
are needed by a hungry world
to produce more food. And
they are able to cite im
pressive statistics to show
the increase in food produc
tion. However, food produc
tion is not food consumption,
and such arguments ring
hollow to a Third World
peasant who can see more
food grow but often eats less.
Additionally, he must pay

the price of handling and liv
ing with these chemicals,
which produce death and dis
ablement. Until 1975 much of
this foreign pesticide sale
was actually subsidised by
the U.S. taxpayer as part of
the USAID Food for Peace
Program. It was only the
concerted action of domestic
environmental groups that
forced an end to this prac
tice.
But damage to the Third
World is only part of the
story. The U.S. is increasing
ly dependent on food imports
from the Third World, say
Weir and Shapiro. Domestic
monitoring of exported
chemicals is lax. Many new
unknown and chemicals un
registered with the EPA are
continually being produced
for export. The EPA is hard
pressed to carefully analyze
and assess the impact of
these chemicals, which are
re-imported in food. Besides,
the perishable nature of food
imports necessitates only
marginal testing of known
chemicals before approval.
Moreover, as some users of
paraquat-sprayed marijuana
may remember, some prod
ucts are not tested at all.
Despite its comprehensive
nature there are some seri
ous shortcomings in the
book. Most glaringly, Wier
and Schapiro have somehow
managed to totally bypass
Africa. Africa has been the

traditional dumping ground
for many chemical com
pounds Furthermore Africa
has emerged as a significant
food source, especially for
Europe. So the omission is
very noticeable. Wier and
Schapiro also fail to ade
quately address the issue of
what role the U.S. govern
ment should or shouldn't
play in pesticide decisions.
While some pesticide ap
plications are unques
tionably and irreparably
damaging to the environ
ment, for a whole variety of
chemicals the pros and cons
fall in a gray area. Third
World governments and peo
ple naturally resent pater
nalistic attitudes of the pow
erful Western nations. Yet
they welcome hard-to-get
scientific evidence. How can
such a compromise be effec
tively achieved? Towards
this end the authors could
have substantially improved
the relevance and effective
ness of the book if they had
included a concise but simple
scientific overview of the
propagation and dissemina
tion of pesticides in the en
vironment.
Judged as a whole, the
book is a useful introduction
to an issue that is bound to
grow in significance. Read
ing it is a must for anyone
concerned with education on
pesticides, chemicals and
the Third World-First World
interdependence.
Circle of Poison: Pesticides
and People in a Hungry

Ever enjoyed a luscious
yellow banana with the an
noying litle Del Monte'
sticker on each bunch? Ever
sat back smugly, glad that
the Environmental Protec
tion Agency and the Depart
ment of Agriculture are
diligently monitering dan
gerous pesticides in your
food? Then Wier and
Schapiro of the San Francis
co-based Institute for Food
and Development Policy
have news for you. In a re
cently published book, Circle
of Poison, the authors con
duct a comprehensive and
readable investigative study
of how dangerous agro
chemicals, outrightly
banned for use in the U.S.,
are nevertheless entering
the American diet through
food imports.
Many banned or severly
restricted chemicals, espe
cially pesticides, are pro
duced in the U.S. for high
profit export to the Third
World. There they are used
on "cash crops," which are
subsequently re-exported to
the U.S. and other in
dustrialized ' countries for

high profit This flow is tight
ly controlled by a handful of
giant U.S. and European
multinational con
glomerates.
The story is familiar
enough. The rampant pro
duction and use of highly po
tent and dangerous
chemicals in domestic agri
culture lead to acute environ
mental awareness and public
clamour for strict regu
lations. The agro-chemical
companies, not about to fore
go high profits in pesticide
manufacture, tailored the
regulations to permit un
restricted export of danger
ous chemicals. Wier and
Schapiro argue that this
loophole is a disaster. The
giant multinationals are now
selling ever-increasing
quantities abroad, and the
victims are the peoples of the
developed and developing
countries.
