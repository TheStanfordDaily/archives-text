The Thief of Baghdad
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Michael Powell directed this
1940 spectacular; Sir Alexander
Korda, the incredibly successful,
enormously influential Hungar
ian-British film entrepreneur, pro
duced The film features some
breathtaking trick photography in
volving giants and flying carpets
and such, but it is even more
notable for its overall look. It was
shot in gauzy, pinkish technicolor,
producing the not-unpleasant ef
fect of viewing everything through
a rose-colored projector lens. Con
rad Veidt makes a stylish, thor
oughly detestable villain; Sabu
(who would later play Mowgli in
Korda's The ■Junnle Hook) plays
the Thief.
Plays through Wednesday with
Sinbad the Sailor, starring
Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and
Maureen O'Hara

The Tin Drum ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
"War is bad . . War is bad . . .
War is bad . . For all its good in
tentions, the din of this drum beats
too long and too loud. This adapta
tion of the Gunter Grass novel is
visually inventive, and occasion
ally intriguing. Weirdness, how
ever, only carries one along just so
far . . .
See this one for the vivid
cinematic moments everyone
talked about (yes, the kid really
does peer out in disgust from its
mother's womb); leave the much
ballyhooed "hidden meanings" to
the book.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with Ranier Fassbinder's The
Marriage of Maria Firaun.
— Leslie Bixel
Private Benjamin **
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
A Goldie Hawn-production of a
Goldie Hawn star vehicle. The
movie is a big-budgeted "Perils of
Goldie:" Hawn plays a know-noth
ing rich girl who loses her hus
band, meets the reality of the
army, grows up, becomes inde
pendent thinking. Hawn's talents
are considerable, but she's lost
much of her perspective here —
many of her best sequences are
pushed beyond the breaking point.
Director Howard Zleff (Hearts of
the WW J has a nice comic touch,
but he stumbles badly when the
movie takes a romantic turn.
— Roff LUlejord
Viva Italia
Wednesday, Bishop Auditorium
This omnibus is made up of nine
vignettes; they range in length
from two minutes to 20 and in qual
ity from pointless to nearly
perfect. There are two sketches
which by themselves make Viva
Italia worth seeing. One is about
an old woman who is too proud to
object when her thoughtless son
decides that she would be better
off in a nursing home. It is moving
without stooping for cheap effects.
The other great sketch is about
how a great comedian's funeral is
plunged into chaos when his jokes
are recounted in the eulogy.

Moonraker★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Formula James Bond — this
movie looks like it was made from
a recipe instead of from a script.
Take one unit James Bond (in this
case, Roger Moore, who serves as
a devalued Sean Connery for these
inflationary times), one major vil
lain, one femme fatale (Lois
Chiles, who's great whenever
she's not required to deliver a line)
and a gimmicky plot and you, too,
can make your own Bond movie.
Moonraker has a great pre-credit
sequence that takes place in mid
air After that, the movie is earth
bound for two solid hours — even
the patented in-the-sack final
scene seems to be affected by post
coital depression.
Plays Saturday only with The
Spy Who Loved Me.

Thief
Royal, San Francisco
Michael Mann, who is making
his commercial film debut with
Thief has a feeling for lonely
milieux and a juicy, trashy energy.
Thief is a terrific pulp movie. It is
so fiercely kinetic (like the score
that Tangerine Dream performs
behind it) and so unerringly deft
that it seems to have been as
sembled unconsciously. This mov
ie has two of the most exciting —
and most instructive — heist
scenes I've ever encountered; if
Mann's career as a director ever
falters, he could make it as a safe
cracker.
But the picture belongs to star
James Caan. In Thief, his best
work to date, he plays Frank, a
diamond burglar who prides
himself on his expertise and his in
dependence; he speaks straight
and rejects the efforts of other
men to claim ownership of his ser
vices. Thief may be urban
western junk, but it's highly
charged and beautifully made.
— Steve Vineberg
The Pout man Aiwa y* Ring*
Twice **
Palo Alto Square
The newest version of James M.
Cain's taut, mean little potboiler,
starring Jack Nicholson and
Jessica Lange, has a convincing
period look, and the director, Bob
Rafelson, has done a good job of
recreating a desolate, under
populated patch of rural Califor
nia. Oddly enough, Postman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong: it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive- >
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist, and well heeled;
it's obvious that Paramount sjpent
money on it. All this prestige — in
cluding the casting of Jack Nich
olson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direction,
which seems to be telling us to
study carefully what requires no
more than a glance. For if you take
away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.

Star tf dr» **
Old Mill, Mountain View
At first glance 1 (stunningly en
tertaining and wildly visual
2)wi!dly entertaining and stun
ningly visual 3) the kind of movie
nobody makes anymore.
On second thought, it's de
liberately anesthetic, little more
than the financial successor to
■Jan s. Except for Alec Guiness the
actors are not unlike Barbie dolls
or escapees from episodes of
Lassie; Lucas' decision to center
the action around members of the
Pepsi generation rankles and irks
and peeves. True 2(H)] fans insist
that for all of its visual achieve
ments Star Wars is really very
bland — even though I still don't
know what the hell was going on in
Kubrick's movie I am tempted to
agree.

Ten» + '/*
Old Mill, Mountain View
The characters' names are the
same as in the Hardy novel, the
landscape looks familiar, and the
storyline runs more or less as it
does in the book, but the soul of the
work is gone.
Tess' centerpiece is Nastassia
Kinski. She is lovely. Looking at
her, one can almost believe that
she could, without in the least in
tending to, drive men to do terrible
deeds. But, and this is a big but,
she has an accent. It is difficult to
concentrate her character's plight
when it sounds as if she spent sum
mers on the banks of the Rhine.
The ultimate responsibility, of
course, rests with director Roman
Polanski. Unable to render any
real, cinematic interpretation of
the novel, he contented himself
with dramatizing its "big mo
ments." What he forgot to do, or
what he was afraid to try, was to
offer any reason for seeing the
movie rather than staying home
and rereading the book.

Ordinary People **
Mountain View Theatre
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — they're
practicing catharsis by the num*
bers. Although it's about a family
in crisis, the movie never makes
you feel that you've really cap
tured the family's heart and soul
—| its guts.
'Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piVce Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Redford is better with
the actors; Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is especially good. With
Mary Tyler Moore and Donald
Sutherland.

Death on the Nile
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Ustinov plays Agatha
Christie's Hercule Poirot for com
edy, but he slides into seriousness
in time for the patented Christie
climax. A solid mystery, nicely
photographed, well set out. But
perhaps Gulf and Western (the
conglomorate that owns Para
mount, the distributors of this
film) could have put their $14 mil
lion to a different use. Or, better
yet, maybe they should keep mak
ing these safe, inoffensive, and
generally well-made entertain
ments and use the inevitable prof
its to take some chances with un
usual projects and new film
makers. Probably won't happen,
though; the board of directors
would never allow it.
Plays Sunday with The Mirror

The Mirror Cracked **
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A suitable means for simulating
Agatha Christie's suspense-build
ing techniques on-screen has yet to
be found, and The Mirror Crack'd,
the latest Christie-derived pic
ture, never really gets going.
While there are no real per
formances, it is nevertheless only
the actors who are worth watchifif
— Tony Curtis and Edward Fox
manage to provide momenta that
keep one from leaving the theater.
Angela Lansbury, unfortunately,
is reduced to geriittric amorphous
ness as Miss Marple,
Plays Sunday only.
Hair ****
Old Mill, Mountain View
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Mllos Forman (One Flew Over the
Cuckoo'h Neat) works in a rest
less, giddy fashion; he manages to
capture the timeless, rock'n'roll,
rebellious spirit of the '80s and
makes it live again. It's a romantic
fantasy vision of America, but
even in those terms, Hair might
just be the truest picture of the '60s
ever made. With John Savage,
Beverly D'Angelo and Treat Wil
liams.
Late show this weekend.

The Great Santini **
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
An interesting, often wonderful
movie run aground by an ending
that renders pointless everything
that's come before. Robert Duvall
plays a Marine colonel who ac
cuses his wife of mollycoddling his
sons. He abuses his family in what
he thinks is their best interests,
and risks alienating them all In the
process. So much, so good . . but
then those lousy last five minutes
go and screw everything up. You
might want to consider going out
for another tub of popcorn when It
becomes apparent that the mov
ie's drawing to a close.
Double-billed with Private Ben

The Blue Lagoorttf
Sunday, Mem Aua
Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins star as history's most dim
witted teen-agers. Marooned all
alone in a tropical paradise, they
take years to figure out the finer
points that the six-year-olds in the
audience grasp immediately. Di
rector Randal Kleiser (Grease)
has seen to it that there's some
thing here to offend everyone..
When the two kids aren't acting
out stereotyped "natural" sex
roles (he spears fishes; she braids
baskets), they're being threatened
by savages straight out of a '40s
jungle epic. A movie for dullards
and child molesters.

9 to 5 *
Old Mill, Mountain View
One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about the revenge three abused
secretaries take on their
chauvinistic boss are quickly
smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy
with a fake feminist gloss and a
Frank Capracorn ending. Lily
Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Dabney
Coleman salvage as much as they
can, but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance: trying to
play a woman of average in
telligence and to be light and funny
at the same time, she telegraphs
appallingly and gives us scenes of
classic female incompetence,
which surely cannot be what she
intended.
- S.V.

Hardly Working * J|r
Old Mill, Mountain View
Jerry Lewii doesn't amile much
in Hardly Working, his first movie
in about 10 years There are fewer
jokes, and less schtlck, in Hardly
Working than in any other Lewis
movie I can think of. In Hardly
Working, he's no longer a likeable
klutz who gets swept into chaos by
the strength of his own good inten
tions, he's merely a klutz. When
does something stupid, we don't
laugh, we politely avert our eyes.
It's not nice to laugh at people who
can't help themselves.
The movie is not without its mo
ments. In a simple, marvelous
scene. Lewis has a telephone con
versation with an answering ma
chine that chastises him for his
rudeness. Offended, he wraps the
cord around his hand until the
voice chokes on its own words. If
Lewis had been as free, and as
fierce, with the rest of the movie
as he was with this scene, he might
have had a comeback on his hands.
Instead, he prepared something
that seems a lot more like a wake.
