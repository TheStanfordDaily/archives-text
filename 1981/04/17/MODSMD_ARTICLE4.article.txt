# Weighty tasks face new senators, COP
## 
### Richard Klingler 
The low voter turnout and complete
turnover of senators and COP mem
bers challenge the new student gov
ernment to regain the interest of Stan
ford students and to respond to their
needs.
The new COP members — Chris
Greene, Fredrick Buhl, Mariann
Byerwalter, and Dragan Popov — cel
ebrated their victory when it was an
nounced at 2:30 a.m. They were
jubilant and looked forward to future
action: Byerwalter said, "It's been a
long road, but this is only the begin
ning."
"We have to sit down and decide
what we want to do," said Greene.
Champagne glass in hand, Buhl said,
"Yeah, but not until after the week
end."

Senators, too, were looking toward
their upcoming terms. Boc Blumen
thal, who received the most votes of
any senator and nearly double the tal
ly of his closest rival, said, "I think we
should sit down as soon as possible and
work out our priorities." Epstein, who
received the most votes after Blumen
thal, agreed: "I'm just glad I won, and
I'm ready to get down to work."

News analysis

Some senators were disappointed
by the low turnout and by the basis of
the voters' decisions. Tom Kohn said,
"It seemed this year that most people
were presenting the same thing."
Andy Benn said that the voters "had
to choose not on issues but on how hard
you campaigned." He was also disap

pointed by the students' attitude:
"You wish everyone would vote and
take the election a little more serious
ly."
The newly elected senate is charac
terized by a general lack of experience
in dealing with the issues the senate
will confront in the coming year. None
of the newly elected senators served
on last year's senate, and few -
Blumenthal is an exception - have
much experience with the daily opera
tion of the senate or with senate pro
dedures.
Many senators' platforms raised is
sues that nearly every senate has cited
as important, yet the senators have
presented few creative or detailed
solutions. Nearly every newly-elected
senator promises to make the senate
more effective and efficient, to in
crease student participationin govern
ment, to expand and improve ser
vices, to increase housing, and to im

prove campus safety. This senate
must overcome problems that have
kept these issues from being resolved
in the past.
The new senate is a particularly
young group. Two of the 10 full under
graduate Senators are now freshmen,
six are sophomores, and two are jun
iors. This high underclass representa
tion may bring fresh ideas and
heightened enthusiasm to the senate
but may also deprive the senate of the
.necessary knowledge of the Univer
sity and its students. The graduate stu
dents elected to the senate — particu
larly Romero and McGrath - will bring
the senate additional experience with
both Stanford and the senate pro
cedure.
The newly elected senators agree on
many issues, which may contribute to
effective senate action. Nearly every
senator states that improving student
