stopping to check for deadly gases moved slowly yester
day toward 15 men trapped by an explosion 7000 feet inside
a coal mine high in the mountains of western Colorado
Asked to estimate the odds for a successful rescue. Rob

replied, "I wouldn't place odds on them one way or the oth
er. I'd say they are remote."

about 1000 feet of where the men were last seen. Seven oth
er miners escaped after the blast.
Officials said the cause of the explosion at 4:15 p.m.
MST Wednesday had not been determined. But one of the
miners who escaped said he thought it had been caused by
a buildup of methane, a highly explosive and toxic sub
stance.
Polish farmers to get a union
Bydgoszcz, Poland — Poland took another liberalizing
step yesterday as its moderate communist leaders were
reported to have decided to legalize the establishment of
an independent farmers' union

million private farmers for their own union, a senior of
ficial yesterday informed striking farmers in this
northern town that a proposed trade union law would be
amended by Parliament to allow registration of an inde
pendent union for farmers.

The farmers are the last significant social group in Po
land to win the right to form their own union. They first
applied for legal registration six months ago but — after a
series of legal wrangles — their application was turned
down by the Supreme Court.

Americans divided on El Salvador
New York — Americans are deeply divided over U.S. in
volvement in El Salvador and are unhappy with the dis
patch of U.S. military advisers to that Central American
country, a new Associated Press-NBC News poll says.
Many people do not accept the Reagan administration
argument that the United States must support the govern
ment of El Salvador to stop communist aggression. They
choose, instead, to believe that the conflict there is a civil
war in which America should not get involved.
The latest AP-NBC News poll was conducted Monday
and Tuesday and is based on telephone interviews with

1,604 adults across the country
It found that the public is roughly divided on the general
issue of U.S. support for the government of El Salvador.
Twenty-six percent agree with that U.S. backing, while
31 percent oppose it. Eleven percent were not sure.
The rest — 32 percent — said they had not heard of the
conflict that is raging in that country, about the size of
Massachusetts.
