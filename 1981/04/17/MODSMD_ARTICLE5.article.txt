### Mike Resnick 
The ASSU Election Committee an
nounced this morning that Fredrick
Buhl, Mariann Byerwalter, Chris
Greene and Dragon Popov will serve
on next year's Council of Presidents.
They beat the Hammer and Coffin
slate by 327 votes, receiving 56.6 per
cent of the votes cast. The final count
was 1399 to 1072.
New members of the ASSU Senate
were also announced after more than
five hours of tabulation. The over
whelming winner was Boc Blumen
thal who received 1176 votes — almost
as many as the next two Senator
elects combined. Mark Epstein re
ceived 626 votes. Bambi Markel, the
only woman to be elected, won with
558 votes. Freshman Mike Bielly was
one vote behind with 557. Scott Para
zynski registered 542 ballots, followed
by Jon Blum with 502. Both members
of the Andy Benn/Tom Kohn slate will
be in next year's senate, after receiv
ing 493 and 475 votes respectively. Bod
Beckstrom and Marty Boberts will be
other two senate members: 475 people
cast votes for Beckstrom, 473 for Bob
erts.
The 10 senate alternates will be
headed by Bick Naimark, who re
ceived a total of 455 votes. Tracey

Priorities' Minkin will be second al
ternate, with 447 votes
Although only nine candidates for
the graduate student senator positions
were listed in the Election Handbook,
all 20 positions are now occupied with
a 12-way tie for the last spot. The top
nine vote getters were those originally
listed on the ballot. Dennis Romero re
ceived 174 votes ; Michael Calabrese,
164. Cynthia Robbins, Jim Steyer, and
Stephen Coyle also received over 100
votes — 154, 133, and 129 respectively.
James McGrath, John Ellis and
Daniel Waxer's votes numbered in the
80s, while Tad Hogg received 77. Rich
ard Nielson received 25 write-in votes,
making him the tenth graduate sena
tor. Nine candidates received at least
two write-in votes and will be the top
senate alternates. Twelve others each
received one write-in vote, which ties
them for the last alternate position.
Of the fee assessments, two — Stan
ford Progressive Alliance and the Ac
ademic Organizations Board — failed
because more "no" votes were regis
tered than "yes" votes. Six other
assessments — the Publications
Board, the Graduate Student Associa
tion, Volunteers in Asia, Student
Alumni Network, SCOPE and the
ASSU Program Fee did not draw the
votes of 20 percent, the minimum re
quired to validate the fee assessment
elections. One other assessment — for
the Boathouse — may fail, depending
on the exact number of registered stu
dents. The other assessments — ASSU
Guest Professorship Board, Speakers
Bureau, Legal Counseling Office, the
Band, the Daily, Club Sports Council,
KZSU and the Chaparral.
Also of concern to the grad students
is the amendment regarding redisric
ting for the graduate student elec
tions: it passed. 1605 to 510 votes.
As anticipated the candidates for
senior class president wiW have a run
off on April 22 and 23. It will be be
tween the Frost-Cetlin-Aoyama-Hall,
which received 261 votes and the Clay
to n-Cuth be rtson-Staenberg-Hicks
slate with 180. The Johnson-Cromak-
Moore-Deife slate came in third with
170 votes.
The three students who will sit on
the Student Conduct Legislative Coun
cil will be Diane Johnson, Mindy
Basham, and David Phelps who polled
735, 619 and 558 votes respectively.
Tom Blaisdell and Andy Chan also
ran, receiving 489 and 552 votes.
