Some of the youngest people who
study at Stanford are eight years old
and speak Spanish.
Their excited chatter mixes with
the adult baritones, and together, the
talking can be heard by anyone pass
ing El Centro Chicano, the University
Chicano student center, Saturday
mornings between 10 a.m. and noon.
The program that brings Spanish
speaking children to Stanford is called
Barrio Assistance, or "Mexican
neighborhood." Started eight years
ago, the program aims to help chil
dren who are having problems with
schoolwork.

However, according to Eloisa Car
rillo, one of the program's six coordi
nators, one of Barrio Assistance s pri
mary goals is "to get children away
from the kinds of things they normally
learn at school."
Instead, some 40 tutors emphasize
discussion in Spanish and English.
During the first hour of the morning,
conversations explore subjects like
the family or community.
According to Carrillo, the children
are encouraged to express themselves
and work in groups.
Nine-year-old Blanca is one of the
most articulate children in the pro
gram, but Coordinator Gerardo

Gonzalez doubts whether she is quite
as expressive in her nursery school.
"Chicano children who can't speak
English have two choices," he says.
"Either they withdraw or they fight
off the system."
Another part of Barrio Assistance's
goals, say the coordinators, is to give
confidence to these children so that
they, like other youths, can eventually
attend college.
"And part of the purpose is also to
be in touch with the parents to tell
them how their children are do
ing,"says Carrillo.
"Often, because of economics, pa
rents will take their children out of

school to work," she says.
Most of the Barrio children come
from East Palo Alto.
"Many of their attitudes come from
living in this low-economic area with
other ethnic (minority) groups," says
Carrillo.
"Some of the kids notice the big
beautiful homes across the bridge
(over the Bayshore Freeway) from
their own little ones, and they think
about it."
The program encourages tutors to
work with the children on a one-to-one
basis. At present there are almost as
many tutors as children Most of the
tutors come from Casa Zapata, the

Chicano theme house, in Stern Hall.
Barrio Assistance is funded by the
Academic Organization Board,
Chicano Fellows Program, Office of
Chicano Affairs, and Office of Student
Affairs.
The tutors are encouraged to pick
the children up at home so the tutors
can get a better idea of how the youths
live.
Gonzalez looks back wistfully on his
own childhood
"If we'd got something like this pro
gram, we'd be better off today," he
says, referring to the numbers of
Chicano students who drop out of
