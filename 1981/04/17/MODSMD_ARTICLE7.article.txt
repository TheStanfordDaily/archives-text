## Arab citizens face discrimination, suspicion, conflicts living in Israel 
### Los Angeles Times 
Nazareth, Israel — Caught
between two hostile cultures,
the 640,000 Arabs of Israel are
becoming increasingly bitter
toward a state that they say
promises them equality but de
livers a daily ration of insults,
slights and open suspicion about
their ultimate loyalty.
Unlike the 1.1 million Arabs
living under military occupa
tion in the West Bank area and
the Gaza Strip, the Arabs of Is
rael proper are citizens of the
Jewish state, a status that the
Jerusalem government says
gives them all the rights and all
but one of the obligations —
compulsory military service —
of other citizens.
But it is a schizophrenic sort
of citizenship. An Arab civil ser
vant remarked during the Yom
Kippur War of 1973, "My people
are fighting my country."
Tightrope
So far, most Israeli Arabs
have successfully walked the
tightrope between Arab
heritage and and Israeli
citizenship.
Even during the bitter Israeli-
Arab wars since the creation of
the Jewish state in 1948, there
were no major examples of sab
otage by Israeli Arabs. Unlike
Palestinians living outside Is
rael, they have never engaged in
acts of terrorism.
However, the vast majority
of Israeli Jews — Jews make up
85 percent of Israel's 3.7 million
people — look at the country's
Arab citizens as at least a poten
tial security threat.
There is evidence of a grow
ing militancy among Israeli Ar
abs, especially the young. Is
raeli security forces recently
broke up what they referred to
as an underground cell operat
ing in Arab villages. Caches of
weapons, well-oiled and cared
for, were confiscated and a
number of young Arabs were ar
rested and tried behind the
closed doors of a military court.
Discrimination
Rayah Assel, pastor of the
Anglican Church in Nazareth,
complained that the Israeli gov
ernment has adopted "policies
aimed at keeping the Arabs as a
bunch of servers, people who do
the menial work."
"I am an Israeli citizen —
well and good — but I am not
treated equally," Assel said.
"When I say that I am Palesti
nian, I am blackballed in some

government circles. They would
tell us we are not what we are.
"Regardless of all the prac
tices of discrimination against
the Arab minority and regard
less of attempts to de-Arabize
us and make us less conscious of
our true identity, it is a fact that
the Arabs in Israel are more
aware today of their Arabism
and more conscious of their
Palestinianism."
Communist support
About 52 percent of Israel's
Arabs voted for candidates sup
ported by Rakah, the Israeli
Communist Party, in the
Knesset election four years ago.
There is a solid core of Marxist
sentiment among the Arabs, but
most specialists in the field
agree that many Arabs vote for
Rakah mainly as a protest
against the Israeli Estab
lishment.
Compared to their status in
1948, when the modern Israeli
state was born, today's Israeli
Arabs are educated, sophisti
cated and well-to-do. But com
pared to Israel's Jewish majori
ty, the Arabs are poor, are con
centrated in menial jobs, lag far
behind in education and are po
litically weak.
No one disputes any of those
facts, but there is an endless de
bate about whether the glass is
half full or half empty.
Suffrage
Israeli Arabs have the right to
vote in the country's elections
and to run for public office.
However, there are only five
Arab members of the 120-mem
ber Knesset. A 15 percent mi
nority should be able to elect
about 18 members under Is
rael's system of proportional
representation.
"We do not want to assimilate
them, but we want to integrate
them into society," said one
high government official.
But like so many other at
tempts at cultural integration,
the process is far easier said
than done. Many people in both
the Jewish and Arab com
munities say the gap is growing
larger by the day.
Arabs and Jews alike tend to
talk about the Arab population
as if it were a unified whole. Of
course, it is not. The Israeli Ar
abs are divided between
Moslem and Christian, between
militant and moderate, between
urban and rural and between af
fluent and poor.
However, despite the

divisions, most Arabs express a
kinship for the rest of the Arab
population. And there are many
problems all Arabs have in com
mon.
The Arabs say the difference
is due to discrimination. Jews
mostly attribute it to greater
motivation and technical skill
on the part of the Jewish popu
lation.
The difference in industrial
development is irksome to most
Israeli Arabs, but the issues that
bother them the most are more
emotional. First among these is
land, a factor that takes on a
mystic importance in the
Middle East that goes far
beyond the value of real estate.
Second among the emotional
matters is a basket of insults,
harassments and implied dis
crimination that Israeli Arabs
call their daily lot.
Land is a major part of the
culture of both the Zionist and
the Arab. But the two sides look
at the issue so differently that it
is almost impossible to obtain
undisputed facts.
Israeli Arabs say as much as
75 percent of their ancestral
land has been confiscated. Is
rael contends that most Jewish
development has been on land
that was state-owned, un
cultivated, barren wilderness.
The Arabs of pre-1948
Palestine were not sticklers for
land records. It was enough to
know which family or group of
families controlled a particular
area. Much of the land the Arabs
considered theirs was either not
platted and deeded at all or was
officially registered by the Ot
toman Turks or the British man
date authorities as "state
land."
Under the Turks and the Brit
ish, common acreage made
available for whole villages was
classed as state land. When Is
rael was established, the Israeli
government became the official
owner of this state land, but
within a few years much of the
property was put to much dif
ferent use.
Zionist ideology places great
emphasis on the cultivation of
land. If the desert is not made to
bloom, the land is not used prop
erly. However, many Arabs, es
pecially the Bedouins, use the
land differently. Land used for
tending flocks of sheep and
goats, for instance, is almost
always uncultivated and un
deeded but often has been in

Arab hands for generations.
Military service
Military service is com
pulsory for Jews and Druse,
whose religion is an offshoot of
Islam. The vast majority of Ar
abs, who are classified either as
Christians or Moslems, may
volunteer but, with the excep
tion of a few Bedouin scouts,
almost none do. At one time, Is
rael tried to sign up promising
young Arabs, but there is no
such effort at present.
There are scores of petty
slights and insults that the Ar
abs say they must endure. Jew
ish Israelis reply that insults are
common in this society and that
Arabs often ascribe motives of
racism to the sort of discourtesy
that Jews ignore.
Nevertheless, Israeli Arabs
cite incidents that would be con
sidered blatant racism if the
victims were American blacks,
for instance, or Jews in any oth
er country.
Joseph Ginat, a Haifa Univer
sity professor and an expert on
Arab affairs, said the problems
of bias against Arabs will be
solved only when Israel makes
peace with the surrounding
Arab nations.
