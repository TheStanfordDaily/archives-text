# Thatcher visits India

New Delhi, India (AP) -
Small Communist demonstra
tions and angry newspaper edi
torials condemning Prime Min
ister Margaret Thatcher's ra
cial policies greeted her
Wednesday when she arrived
for a four-day visit to India.
About two dozen noisy youths
waved black swatches of cloth
and shouted "Go back! Go
back!" as Thatcher and Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi left the
airport. Several dozen more
youths chanted and passed out
leaflets as the motorcade
reached the presidential palace
where the British visitor is
staying.
A police official said about 25
people were arrested.
Condemned legislation
The leaflets, issued by youth
organizations affiliated with the
Communist parties, condemned
legislation sponsored by
Thatcher's government to re
strict non-white immigration to
Britain and her support for the
supplying of American arms to
Pakistan. They also accused her
of opposition to making the Indi

an Ocean a "zone of peace."
Nationality bill
Thatcher appeared to be in
for some barbed questions from
Indian officials about her gov
ernment's controversial na
tionality bill. Her talks with
Gandhi also were expected to in
clude candid discussion of their
differences over U.S. plans to
sell arms to Pakistan, India's
traditional enemy, and the
American military buildup in
the Indian Ocean. The British
leader supports both, the Indian
opposes them.
British treatment of non
whites, especially the stringent
checking of immigrants at Lon
don's Heathrow Airport, has
long been a festering sore in In
dian-British relations. The riots
last weekend in the London slum
district of Brixton reopened the
wound.
Editorials Tuesday accused
Britain of racist policies and
sharply attacked the nationality
bill pending in Parliament,
which would create three
classes of British citizenship.
