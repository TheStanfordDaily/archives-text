# East Germans not amused by Polish developments
## 
### Washington Post 
East Berlin — In the many
cabarets of this city the comedi
ans satirize nearly every situ
ation imaginable, but with one
exception. There are no jokes
about Poland and no hint of the
political tensions that have been
stirred up here by the events in
this country's eastern neighbor.
It was as if the Polish situ
ation were simply too serious,
and too immediate, to be the
subject of satire even for the
amusement of a small audience
of cabaret-goers.
Such omissions are no acci
dent in a society that carefully
controls all political expression.
And to those skilled at reading
the country's political signs it
was evidence of the gravity with
which East German authorities
view the unfolding crisis in Po
land.
In the West, East Germany is
sometimes portrayed as a harsh
socialist prison ruled by a re
gime that is slavishly loyal to
the Soviet Union and anxious to
be unleashed militarily to put
down the unrest beyond the
Oder River.
Complex picture
But inside East Germany a
far more complex picture of the
German Democratic Republic's
interests in the present crisis
emerges.
In many respects, East Ger
many has more to lose from the
continued unrest than the Soviet
Union or any of its allies. Yet

the party leadership as well as
the people both appear to dread
the prospect of military in
tervention, fearing that it could
spell the end of the expanded
contacts with the West that have
greatly improved life here since
the 19705.
It is difficult to find anyone
here who agrees with U.S. De
fense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger's view that the detente of
the last decade reinforced the
Soviet "prison wall."
Under the umbrella of de
tente, which East Germans now
see threatened by events in Po
land, the two Germanys signed
agreements that eased tensions
between them, increased per
sonal contacts and improved ec
onomic conditions this side of
the wall.
Visits
In 1978 about 7.7 million West
Germans visited relatives in
East Germany compared with a
mere trickle in 1970. The
number of East Germans trav
eling to the West rose from
hardly any in 1970 to about 40,000
a year, and visits of West Ber
liners to East Berlin became
almost routine.
Meanwhile, economic ties be
tween the two Germanys
strengthened. In 1978 about $1.1
billion worth of Western cash
went to East Germany in the
form of grants from the West
German government, or as gifts
and money spent in East Ger
many by visitors and relatives.
As a direct consequence of de
tente, Washington and Bonn
ended their postwar policy of
isolating East Germany. East
and West Germany exchanged
diplomatic representatives, and
East Germany joined the Unit
ed Nations and was recognized
by 120 countries, including the
United States.
East Germans already have
paid a price for the crisis in Po
land. Contacts with West Ger
many have been reduced be
cause of actions taken by the
government here last October,
and there were shortages this
winter of hard coal, sulfur and
other raw materials normally
obtained from Poland.
Uncertainty
As the uncertainty continues,
however, concern mounts that
broader gains made in the 1970s
also could become a casualty of
Poland's strife — especially if
the Army has to join a military
intervention in Poland, as it did
in Czechoslovakia in 1968.
East German officials ac
knowledge that the crisis has en
hanced their country's prestige
within the Soviet Bloc. Com
pared with the disarray in Po
land, East Germany's political,
economic and social stability

stands out sharply. After being
overshadowed for years by Po
land and Czechoslovakia, East
Germany seems finally to have
arrived as the Soviet Union s
most important East European
ally.
Industrial output rose last
year by an impressive 4.7 per
cent and exports to the West in
creased by 27 percent. Increas
ingly, East Germany is the Sovi
et Bloc's economic showcase.
No restiveness
There is no sign of the restive
ness in the country's labor force
that gave rise to the Solidarity
independent trade union or
ganization in Poland, and work
ers acknowledge that they are
better off than their coun
terparts in Poland or in Czecho
slovakia.
Far from spreading to East
Germany's factories, Solidar
ity's strikes and political ac
tivities seem instead to have
stirred up dormant German
contempt for Polish work hab
its. Old jokes about "the Polish
mess" have been making the
rounds in East Berlin. Yet few
Germans, in or out of the party,
are gloating over the Polish sit
uation.
For one thing, not all East
Germans disapprove of the ac
tivities of Polish workers. As a
local truck driver put it, "It's
true that the Poles are unloved
here and vice versa. But you
have to admire their courage.
We do not have that kind of
courage."
If Solidarity survives as an in
dependent voice of Polish work
ers, its influence eventually
would be felt in East Germany
as well. Western diplomats say.
The current situation is full of
potential perils for the East
German leadership.
East Germany's relative
prosperity has been built on a
social and economic model that
is similar to that of the Soviet
Union. What remains to be seen,
however, is whether this model
can succeed if it is cut off from
Moscow by a Poland that is ex
perimenting with a new system
based on trade union rights and
democratic principles.
"If it came down to a choice
between intervening in Poland
and standing idly by while capi
talism was restored . . . then I
would unhesitatingly say, 'in
tervene,' " an East German
party member said.
However, he acknowledged
that the choice is never likely to
be that simple. "Countries do
have a right to develop social
ism in their own way — Karl
Marx said so — but when does
this become the first step in the
restoration of capitalism? It is
not an easy thing to know."
