To All Members of the Office
and Library Support Staff
i I
<
The University has learned that the Stanford Daily and
USE/Local 715 union have been conducting separate surveys of
office and library support staff to determine their feelings about
unionization.
II
A number of employees have expressed concerns about
these surveys because they view their vote on May 7 as a per
sonal and private matter.
The University has no involvement in these surveys and
wants you to. know that you are free to respond or not to
respond to the questions.
The University also wants to assure all eligible voters that the
May 7 election is indeed a secret ballot election. No one—not
the University, nor the union, nor the National Labor Relations
Board—will Know how you voted.
So regardless of these surveys, all office and library support
staff should be sure to vote on May 7.
