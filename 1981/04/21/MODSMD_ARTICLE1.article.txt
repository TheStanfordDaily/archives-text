### Clay Moltz 
Church leaders and political ac
tivists presented a strong statement
supporting the struggle of the
Salvadoran people against armed re
pression in that country to more than
1000 people gathered here on Easter
Sunday to attend The Memorial Ser
vice for El Salvador.
Led by Father Coop Moriarty of the
San Francisco Archdiocese's Social
Justice Commission, the Reverend
Dr. Robert McAfee Brown and folk
singer Joan Baez, the event was more
than an Easter religious service, and
presented strong opposition to con
tinued U.S. intervention and military
aid to the ruling junta.
Speaking to the crowd outside Me
morial Auditorium, Moriarty said,
"The bullets that have killed people
are not marked Cuba or Soviet Union,
but Made in U.S.A."

According to Moriarty, the Church
is taking an active stand against the
killing in El Salvador, unlike the pas
sive position of the Catholic Church
during the Vietnam War. Referring to
the United States, he said, "We are
tired of being ashamed of our coun
try."
A recent refugee from El Salvador
and a member of the National Teach
ers Union there, Tulio Mendosa
Figueroa spoke of the plight of the
Salvadoran people in the face of the
terrorist tactics of the ruling junta,
which issupported by U.S. aid. "Our
people are struggling against a very
powerful enemy."

Mendosa said that there is wide
spread opposition to the killing taking
place in his country among workers,
peasants, clericals and professionals,
and said that people live in constant
fear of their lives.
"When we go to bed at night we
don't know if we will wake up the next
day," Mendosa said. It is estimated
that in the small country of 4 million,
50 people die each day in the swell of
political violence.
Brown's address focused on the re
ligious context of the struggle of the
Salvadoran people and drew applause
from the crowd. Referring to the polit
icalassassination last year of Catholic
Archbishop Oscar Romero (a critic of
the El Salvadoran government),
Brown said, "Archbishop Romero has
risen in the hearts of the El
Salvadoran people."
Brown alluded to the Bible, apply-

ing references from scripture to the
situation in El Salvador today.
"God said that true power would be
channeled not through the tyrants, but
through the people," Brown said.
"The Reagan administration has
chosen to side with the tyrants. . . the
modern-day Pilates and Herods."
Chilean poet and professor Fernan
do Alegria read from his works "Noc
turne" and "Report to the Ruler." He
presented the poems in Spanish and
wrote them, he said, out of concern for
the El Salvadoran crisis. A local poet
translated the works into English.
Three Latin American women
opened the service with music and

songs sung in Spanish. Baez also per
formed during the course of the ap
proximately two hour service and
spoke of her lack of faith in the govern
ments of the world
"It's time for the superpowers to
get off the backs of small and op
pressed nations of the world," Baez
said.
The end of the program was left
open to give unscheduled speakers an
opportunity to address the crowd.
Among those who expressed sympa
thy for the El Salvadoran cause was
Dave Mason, an American Indian,
who said that his people identify with
the struggle of the El Salvadoran peo
ple.
A short message from Con
gressman Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) restated his conviction that
neither Americans nor Latin Ameri
cans are served by U.S. military in
volvement in Latin American strug
gles.
The service was preceeded by a
march commemorating those who
have died in political violence in El
Salvador in the past year.
The El Salvador Solidarity Commit
tee at Stanford and the Stanford
Progressive Alliance were among the
many Bay Area groups which spon
sored the Easter service and rally.
