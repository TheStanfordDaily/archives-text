# The 						draw: a fair housing system, or a big headache?
## Students face deadlines, problems 
### Karen Springen 
This quarter the sun is shining
j and there seems to be little to
; complain about. . . except for
• one undergraduate rite of spring
( — the draw.
Illusions run rampant as
hopeful freshmen in Stern count
on spending the next few years
sunning by the lake outside their
I Lambda Nu dream-home. It is
' easy to forget that one is guar
i anteed only a room. The housing
office makes no promises con
* cerning location, size or decor.
As a result, housing gripes
are not unusual. And they can be
expected to increase after the
first round of the draw, today
| through Friday, when many stu
dents develop Manzanita
, phobia.
According to housing center
t supervisor Jean Kitaji, another
complaint concerns the number
«of spaces available. Mainly be
cause of unguaranteed students
entering the draw, more than
: 600 students who tried to receive
housing were not assigned last
spring. But students are guaran
teed three years of on-campus
housing — far more than at most
universities.
Almost 7000 students are
housed on campus. And al

though spaces are divided
among the competing popu
lations here, undergraduates
live in the majority of resi
dences. Kitaji said that of 6976
students housed in autumn 1980,
5055 were single under
graduates, 1038 were single
graduate students, and 883 were
married.
"The draw and the under
graduate housing plan work
very closely together," said
Kitaji. Graduate students, how
ever, do not participate in a
draw. They submit applications
which are assigned numbers.
Change the system?
"Every year we look at how
we can simplify the system,"
said Kitaji. For example, it
would be less time-consuming
to have a computer or employee
randomly assign numbers. But
students want to draw their own
numbers.
Kitaji emphasized that the
guarantee aspect of the system
gives predictability to academ
ic programs and reduces the
number of "unlucky" people.
"It hopefully guarantees ev
eryone a significant number of
years on campus."
The demand for on-campus
housing has increased. Students

find it inconvenient and difficult
to get good off-campus housing.
High expectations
Kitaji said student dis
satisfaction is somewhat "self
inflicted." For example, many
students enter the draw their
unguaranteed years. "They
don't accept that as a non-guar
anteed year."
And students are often the
cause of their own housing prob
lems, particularly in regard to
missing deadlines. Senior Gayle
Groff lost her housing deposit
and guaranteed year when she
notified the housing office of her
stopping out plans a week late.
Complaints
Fraternities appear to have a
legitimate gripe with the sys
tem. Those ineligible for the
draw (non-students) are not al
lowed to be boarders even if all
students on the wait list have
been assigned elsewhere. Yet
the fraternity house, such as
SAE, must pay the University
the same as if all spaces were
filled.
The number of vacancies

within the system has de
creased recently, however, says
Kitaji.
Senior Roy Nordblom (who
drew 4965 his first year and 10
his second, so there is hope!)
said the housing system, like
other institutions, is a bureau
cracy.
Another common complaint
concerns the wait list. Students
who leave their name on a wait
list are placed in the residence
without warning. If they do not
accept the new assignment,
they are removed from the
housing system.
Other students cited the "vi
cious cycle" of a poor draw.
Transfer students seem sur
prised by the priority system
here. Sophomore Lori
Lehmann, a transfer, said most
universities give preference to
upperclassmen. She added that
housing assigned her the wrong
guaranteed years. She is cur
rently unguaranteed next year
and guaranteed for the year af
ter she graduates.

the fraternity house, such as
SAE, must pay the University
the same as if all spaces were

The number of vacancies

Kitaji.
Senior Roy Nordblom (who
drew 4965 his first year and 10
his second, so there is hope!)
said the housing system, like
other institutions, is a bureau
cracy.
Another common complaint
concerns the wait list. Students
who leave their name on a wait
list are placed in the residence
without warning. If they do not
accept the new assignment,
they are removed from the
housing system.
Other students cited the "vi
cious cycle" of a poor draw.
Transfer students seem sur

here. Sophomore Lori

upperclassmen. She added that
housing assigned her the wrong

and guaranteed for the year af

This quarter the sun is shining
j and there seems to be little to
; complain about. . . except for
• one undergraduate rite of spring
( — the draw.
Illusions run rampant as
hopeful freshmen in Stern count
on spending the next few years
sunning by the lake outside their
I Lambda Nu dream-home. It is
' easy to forget that one is guar
i anteed only a room. The housing
office makes no promises con
* cerning location, size or decor.
As a result, housing gripes
are not unusual. And they can be
expected to increase after the
first round of the draw, today
| through Friday, when many stu
dents develop Manzanita
, phobia.
According to housing center
t supervisor Jean Kitaji, another
complaint concerns the number
«of spaces available. Mainly be
cause of unguaranteed students
entering the draw, more than
: 600 students who tried to receive
housing were not assigned last
spring. But students are guaran
teed three years of on-campus
housing — far more than at most
universities.
Almost 7000 students are
housed on campus. And al

though spaces are divided
among the competing popu
lations here, undergraduates
live in the majority of resi
dences. Kitaji said that of 6976
students housed in autumn 1980,
5055 were single under
graduates, 1038 were single
graduate students, and 883 were
married.
"The draw and the under
graduate housing plan work
very closely together," said
Kitaji. Graduate students, how
ever, do not participate in a
draw. They submit applications
which are assigned numbers.
Change the system?
"Every year we look at how
we can simplify the system,"
said Kitaji. For example, it
would be less time-consuming
to have a computer or employee
randomly assign numbers. But
students want to draw their own
numbers.
Kitaji emphasized that the
guarantee aspect of the system
gives predictability to academ
ic programs and reduces the
number of "unlucky" people.
"It hopefully guarantees ev
eryone a significant number of
years on campus."
The demand for on-campus
housing has increased. Students

find it inconvenient and difficult
to get good off-campus housing.
High expectations
Kitaji said student dis
satisfaction is somewhat "self
inflicted." For example, many
students enter the draw their
unguaranteed years. "They
don't accept that as a non-guar
anteed year."
And students are often the
cause of their own housing prob
lems, particularly in regard to
missing deadlines. Senior Gayle
Groff lost her housing deposit
and guaranteed year when she
notified the housing office of her
stopping out plans a week late.
Complaints
Fraternities appear to have a
legitimate gripe with the sys
tem. Those ineligible for the
draw (non-students) are not al
lowed to be boarders even if all
students on the wait list have
been assigned elsewhere. Yet
the fraternity house, such as
SAE, must pay the University
the same as if all spaces were
filled.
The number of vacancies

within the system has de
creased recently, however, says
Kitaji.
