# ...but they have a variety of living options
## 
### Cathy Janus 
Where to live — that's the
crucial question for next year's
sophomores and other students
who do not have returning
priority with their houses.
There are many options but
where one is placed ultimately
depends on one's draw number.
Be optimistic and in the hopes
that you will draw a low
number, visit the houses and
choose those which you most
prefer to live in — that is the ad
vice given by the Housing Of
fice.
Residences range from the
larger dorms: Toyon, Roble,
Lagunita, Wilbur, Florence
Moore, and Stern, to self-ops
such as ATO, ZAP, Kairos, and
co-ops, Theta Chi, Terra, and
Columbae. Hulburt, 558 May
field, Durand, and other Row
Houses are small, university
run houses.
The larger dorms range in
size from 50 students per dorm
in Florence Moore Hall to 290
students in Roble Hall. Al
though most of the larger dorms
are made up of doubles and tri
ples, there are a few singles,
mainly in dorms such as
Lagunita Court. Residents of
these dorms are required to con
tract with the food service for
their meals.
Students wishing to sample
life in another culture may want
to examine the cross-cultural
theme houses based in the larg

er dormitories. Stanford has
three cross-cultural houses:
Okada (The Asian-American
theme house in Wilbur);
Ujamaa (The Black theme
house in Lagunita Court); and
Casa Zapata (The Mexican-
American-Chicano) theme
house in Stern.
Mirrielees and Manzanita
Trailer Park offer a living ar
rangement that is "different"
from the traditional dorm situ
ation. The trailers are a group of
115 double-wide trailers. Four
students live in each trailer and
can do their own cooking in the
kitchens provided. Mirrielees
offers the same sort of "apart
ment-style" living space inside
of a more permanent building.
All-male fraternities also of
fer alternative to the regular
housing system. The 13
fraternities pride themselves on
active social life and wide
range of community services
and group involvement. Each
house admits own members. Al
though one sorority has been al
lowed back on campus, Delta-
Gamma does not yet have
comparable housing for its all
female membership.
Theta Chi, a co-op with 17 sin
gles and 26 residents, combines
privacy with the close contact
inevitable in a "house.'' Accord
ing to one resident, the house is
set apart by the students' "deep
love and concern for their
house, and its small size." The

house is owned by a national
fraternity rather than by Stan
ford so the residents are re
quired to maintain it. The week
before fall quarter, everyone
works together to prepare the
house for the year ahead, which
"builds a strong community."
"It's more of a home — we can
say OUR house," said RA Con
nie Wolf.
Theta Chi makes it own bread
and granola, and meals are ex
tremely varied — there's
always the alternative of ham
burgers in the freezer for those
who dislike dinner. "It has
been argued that our food is the
best," said one student. Another
student, searching for a more
adequate adjective than good
said the dinners are "palate
pleasing." Everyone who lives

in the house must share in the
household duties, as well as
reap the benefits, Wolf said. In
fall and spring there is a good
"orgy" — everyone cooks some
thing and the rules state that
you can't feed yourself or use
utensils. Said one woman, Theta
Chi is "the nicest place you
could possibly care to live."
The other self-owned house,
Phi-Sig, is also small, consisting
of 25 people. There is a cook for
this house, which also has a sun
deck, the "best" pool table on
campus, and a uniquely de
signed froom for each resident.
The house is sunny and worth
visiting if only to inspect the
various architectural struc
tures of the rooms and the
creative energy used in decorat

ing them.
Phi Psi is a somewhat larger
co-op with 40 students, fire
places in the rooms, and bands
including Rooftop Magic prac
ticing in the basement. Many
peple in the house are interested
in music, and one resident said,
"there's a lot of diversity
among our residents, which is
really nice."
The other co-ops, Columbae,
Synergy, and Terra are environ
mentally concerned. Columbae
and Synergy are vegetarian;
Terra offers meat for dinner
three times a week.
Overlooking the lake is the
"dream house," Lambda Nu.
Peter Whidden, sophomore
said, "It's fantastic. You can't
get better." Lambda Nu fea
tures a "great cook," two-room

doubles, sundeck, and parties.
Residents are currently practic
ing for the play "God" by
Woody Allen.
Row houses include 558 May
field, which is notorious for its
"beauty and boredom," as one
student put it. Casa Italiana and
American Studies are also popu
lar choices, and require certain
committments such as lan
guage requirements at Casa
Italiana and a special project at
American Studies.
The French House is also on
the row. "If you love good
food," said Judy Moreland. a
junior, French house is great.
"Being in the French House is a
good excuse for wine with
meals," she continued. She said
one gets to know people a lot bet

ter than in a dorm because there
are only 35 people in the house.
"It's more relaxing — more
conducive to 'come to my house'
type of thing instead of 'come to
my dorm.' " She said that
potential residents don't have to
worry that French is spoken all
of the time. The concentration is
on people interested in French.
The Cowell Cluster houses
are Whitman, ZAP, ATO, Terra,
and Alpha Sigma Phi. Each has
sun decks, two room doubles,
many with lofts, and other
unique features. Alpha Sig is a
co-ed fraternity. ATO has a
sauna, a pool, and is cheaper in
meal costs, but more expensive
as far as activities are con
cerned, according to residents.
The great thing about the open
kitchens, said one student, "is

that the food managers will get
you almost anything you want,
plus it's a great meeting place
at night.
The University-owned row
houses include Durand,
Lathrop, Roth (all-women) and
Hurlburt. The houses range in
size, and the food is said to be
"excellent." The location is ide
al, said one resident, because
you're "in the middle of cam
pus, and can easily get to most
activites, but still be close to
home.
There are distinguishing fac
tors to each house, and one can
only ask a lot of questions and
investigate, always remember
ing that a house's personality
will change yearly as different
people move into various resi
dences.

The infamous box and the draw numbers it contains hold the key to many students' hopes and expecta
tions for housing next year. The first round of this year's draw begins today.
