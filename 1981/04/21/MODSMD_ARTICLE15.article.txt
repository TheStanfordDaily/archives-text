## The 						inside guide to writing English papers 
### 
Read over your compositions
and, when you meet a passage
which you think is particularly
fine, strike it out.
— Samuel Johnson
To someone who has not
been initiated into the mysteries
of William Faulkner or Emily
Dickinson, the English depart
ment can be an intimidating
place, shrouded in antiquity and
dimly-understood ritual. Even
at so indulgent a university as
Stanford, English classes ex
pose the unwary and under
graduate to both unexpected
cross-examinations by vindic
tive T.A.'s and the whimsical in
terpretations of professors who
have voluntarily isolated them
selves from the outside world
since entering graduate school.
Worst of all, the English class
carries with it the stigma of that
most dreaded of education in in
stitutions — the English paper.
The most able-bodies engi
neer or biologist will find that
his operations research analysis
or his lab report will avail him
little when faced with an Eng
lish paper. Indeed, those un
lucky souls who have written
OUly tour or live tones of
cpherent prose during their
Stanford career have been
known to break down and cry
when asked to write eight to ten
pages on Pope's Rape of the
Lock.
As a graduate student in Eng
lish, and one well-acquainted
with the subtle mysteries of the
field, I feel that it is my duty to
dispel the notion that the Eng
lish paper isn't to be undertaken
lightly — a notion propogated by
graduate students and pro
fessors who are keenly aware of
their privileged position. In
fact, the clever student will find
that it's entirely possible to con
struct a plausible English paper
with little or no direct ex
perience with the material.
1. Reference handbooks. Al
though many recommend the
MLA Handbook or Strunk and
White's Elements of Style, the
one truly indispensable refer
ence guide to writing English
papers is the Harvard Lam
poon's Rig Rook of College Fun.
The Rig Rook explains how two
or three pages of material can
be easily expanded into a six- to
eight-page paper, through such
handy devices as two-inch
margins, skipping page num
bers in the middle of the paper,
using 2 1/2 spacing instead of
double spacing (no one will no
tice) and repeating short words
at the end of a line and at the be
ginning of the next.
2. Footnotes. As any English
or History major knows, the
form of footnotes is infinitely
more important than the sub
stance, As long as you can
adhere to correct footnote form,
and sprinkle at least two or
three on every page, it really
doesn't matter if they refer to

books you're quoting from, or
even to books you've read. After
all. professors are no more in
terested in footnotes than you
are. Use the subject index to
Rooks in Print for a list of ten or
twelve likely-sounding titles,
and use these for your bibiol
graphy as well as for your foot
notes. Or, if you can't be both
ered, just make up the titles 1 —
but be sure to use obscure-soun
ding publishers, and publication
dates at least twenty years old.
For example:
Sylvan Barnet. Alas Poor
Yorick: Necrophilia in Hamlet
(New York: Hudson Press,
1952), p. 331.
3. Epigrams. A brief quota
tion at the beginning of your pa
per — a snatch of poetry or
prose that may have little to do
with your subject matter — is a
surprisingly easy and effective
way of establishing your in
telligence and sensitivity right
from the start, as well as put
ting you in the company of such
literary heavyweights as James
Fenimore Cooper and Ernest
Hemingway. Use Rartlett's Fa
miliar Quotations, or pick any
three ot four tones of poetry
from T.S. Elliot or Wallace
Stevens — no one knows what
they mean anyway. When writ
ing papers for professors under
the age of 40, a line or two
from a popular song of the six
ties — Bob Dylan or the Doors —
is often appropriate.
4. Literary illusions. In many
papers, it's mandatory to allude
to other literary works, and
most novels and short stories
written since 1900 will benefit
from some mention of either
Freud (key words: ego, super
ego, id) or Jung (key words:
anima, animus). Both are avail
able in convenient Monarch
Note or Cliff Note form.
5. Qualifiers. It is likely that
the professor will disagree with
any personal stand you take in
your paper, so qualify ev
erything with "It is possible
that. . . or in extreme cases,
"One might almost say . . . "
6. Style. Follow Mandel's
First Law: "Glib prose and
clever metaphors will gloss
over all but the most ludicrous
idea." (Editor's note: see
Mandel's column on feminism.)
7. Modifiers. Most abstract
concepts can, and should, be
modified with the name of a lit
erary figure. Why say simply
"suffering" when you can give
it dimension and authority be
reworking it as Dostoyevskian
suffering?" Other examples:
Dickensian sense of the absurd,
Emersonian mysticism,
Nietzchean Übermensch ("su
perman"), Platonic order.
8. Rrou n-nosing. It is highly
recommended to include quotes
from members of the pro
fessor's department, or better
yet, the professor himself.
Avoid such obvious flattery,

however, as "the esteemed pro
fessor" or "highly innovative
book."
9. Credibility. One trick used
by many graduate students is to
give their own opinions as
quotations from a mythical sec
ondary source or unpublished
dissertation, thereby lending
them a certain objective
credibility. Instead of simply
stating, "Hamlet resembles the
necrophiliac hero of Irving's
Adventures of a German Stu
dent,' " rephrase it as: "Sylvan
Barnet, in Necrophilia in
Hamlet, remarks that Hamlet
resembles the necrophiliac hero
in Irving's 'Adventures of a Ger
man Student.' " When foot
noting such opinions, don't
ascribe them to well-known lit
erary periodicals like the Times
Literary Supplement or the
PMLA; instead, use obscure
ones like the Oxford Slavonic
Papers or the Sewannee Re
view.
10. Old papers. There is a
wealth of usable material in old
papers, both your own and those
of other people. Many phrases,
paragraphs and even entire
pages can be lifted intact from
old paper, with just a little edit
ing and revision of names. (A
good rule of thumb is to re-use

the paragraphs marked "V.G."
or "excellent" by the professor
in old papers.) The smart stu
dent will keep a file of especial
ly good "general purpose" para
graphs, and when it comes time
to write a paper, he will sim
ply rearrange the contents of
the file into some kind of
aesthetic order.
11. Quotations. At least one
half of your paper should consist
of quotations from the work(s)
being discussed. While plot
summary is unnacceptable to
English professors, long,
pointless quotations seem to add
to a paper's credibility, even if
chosen at random from the text.
Since you're quadruple-spacing
before and after quotations, lots
of short quotes are cleary better
than a few long ones.
12. Class lists. One final hint:
when the professor hands out in
dex cards on the first day of
class for your name, year and
major, identify yourself as
"freshman, mechanical engi
neering." This will make your
papers seem all the better, and
the professor will be gratified
you're taking the class at all.
