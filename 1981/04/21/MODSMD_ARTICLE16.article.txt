Woman's life real
Bill Wray's letter against the
legality of abortion (Daily, Apr.
9) neatly sidesteps the impor
tant issues of this debate to
reach the conclusion that accep
tance of abortion in our society
is unjustified. As one who has
had an abortion and who is now
the mother of three children, I
feel qualified to speak on the
subject.
As so many others suggest,
Wray implies that abortion is an
easy, convenient alternative.
Yet, no woman in her right mind
would use abortion as a con
traceptive measure given an
other choice. However, acci
dents happen, as does rape, in
cest, child experimentation and
other misfortunes. Wray
sidesteps these cases by stating
that he has no "answer" for
cases involving rape or difficult
births (although there is no such
thing as an easy one). This frees
him of having to make an excep
tion in some cases, which would
undermine has argument that
"the priority of life over conve
nience seems to be in
disputable." You see, if he finds
a difficult birth inconvenient
enough, or child conceived in
rape inconvenient enough, or a
child conceived by a 13 year old
inconvenient enough to warrant
abortion, then who is he, or
some religious group, or the
government to decide for a
woman what is or is not inconve
nient enough to warrant abor
tion?
Only the woman knows how
she feels about risking her life in
childbirth or bearing the child of
a rapist. It follows that only she
knows what other "inconve
niences" are serious enough to
her, to warrant terminating her
pregnancy. She bears the re
sponsibility for her decision and
must live it for the rest of her
life, believe me.
There is, of course, no clear
and logical way to determine
when the unborn child's life be
gins, but there is no question
that the woman's life is real.
The taking of human life, in
whatever form, is always ex
cruciatingly painful to a sane
person. Yet, we do it to protect
our own lives, to be free of
enslavement, even to defend our
territory and property, and we
say, in our laws, that it is justi
fied. In the same manner, it is
justified when we save

ourselves from giving birth,
when, for whatever reason, the
birth is unthinkable.
And anyway, to bring up an
other neglected issue, you won't
stop abortion with a law; you
will only make it more danger
ous, more expensive, more
traumatic, more life taking
than it already is.

No cuts
The article on graduate
stipends (Daily, Apr. 7) was ac
curate; but, like many another
accurate story, it was done in by
a headline writer. The headline
read "Kennedy says grad
stipends will be cut." I did not.
What I did say was exactly what
was included in the story: it is
likely to be impossible for the
University to grant its Ph.D.
candidates complete financial
support. We do not now antici
pate a cut in stipends; indeed,
we raised them this year, and
hope we can continue to do so.
But graduate students now find
that their fellowship stipends
fall short of meeting the cost of
living here, and that gap may
continue to widen — even
without cuts.

Jan's OK
I am not a firm believer in the
old adage. "If you don't have
anything nice to say, don't say
anything at all." Sometimes the
bas as well as the good must be
aired. I will, however, claim to
be a proponent of my own per
sonal adage, "If you must say
something, accuracy and
fairness should preside."
This, unfortunately, was not
the case in the article (dining re
view?) written by Erin Craig
and Seth Zuckerman entitled,
"But the food ... do you re
member the food?" (Daily,
March 11). A dining review was
done on Jan's Valley Inn, a local
restaurant/bar in Portola Val
ley.
Accuracy and fairness were
lacking in this article to the
point where one wonders wheth
er the editors had established a
prejudice against Jan's long
before they set out to write this
objective' review. Not one
nice or pleasant comment was

made regarding the at
mosphere, the table setting, the
prices, the food, the people or
the service, which are in my
opinion quite adequate. And if a
comment came near to being
pleasant, the sarcastic under
tones were quite prevalent.
Commenting on the brand of
shirt the waiter was wearing re
ally left a lot to be desired —
tacky? — but then, stating it as
if it were a pertinent item to a
dining review left even more to
be desired. Or at least it tends to
make one question the value of
the judgement of these writers.
Also, please, I would like to
ask what sense there is in a com
ment like, "... and even if the
seafood platter was a little fishy
. . . ?" How are seafood plat
ters suppose to taste . . .
gamey? Meaty? Come on.
These writers even had the gall
to describe the clientele at Jan's
as being "as heavy as the cheese
cake," whatever that means.
What is "heavy?" A new pro
fessional term used when de
scribing particular personality
traits? (Here now, shouldn't
writers be a bit more pro
fessional in their terminology
than that?) The article went on
the describe the people at Jan's
as "either rich young Portola
Valley types or balding middle
aged* accountants." Portola
Valley "types." Which "type"
is that? Not only is a comment
like this extremely presump
tuous, innaccurate and unfair,
but it also eradicates, once
again, any value placed on the
judgement of these writers.
Think about it, actually stating
and printing a gross general
ization such as this? Hummmm.
(In fact, a retraction may even
be in line here on the part of the
Daily — I hope not too many
Portola Valley "types" were in
sulted. )
It would be unnecessary as
well as not to-the-point to con
tinue. To clarify my position, by
no means am I stating that Jan's
is the "greatest" or the "best"
but the restaurant and the clien
tele are a heck of a lot better
than this review gives credit
for. A heck of a lot better. And if
people must insist on making
judgements (and then publish
ing them!) please, all that is
asked is No. 1-Accuracy; No. 2-
Fairness. 0.K.?
P S. Yes the Sunday cham
pagne brunch is good.
