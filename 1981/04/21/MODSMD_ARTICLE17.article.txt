## David Miller Critic of libertarians incorrect 
### 
One of the serious problems
with much of the current politi
cal discussion and commentary
in this country is the lack not
only of common civility but
even of simple honesty. Some
rightists falsely accuse anyone
who questions the need for our
bloated defense establishment
of being a tool of the Com
munists; many leftists falsely
label anyone who questions the
utility of the ever-expanding
welfare state as being a neo
fascist who hates the poor.
This sort of misrepresenta
tion and reckless disregard of
the truth makes honest political
debate and discussion nearly
impossible.
An example of such pre
variacation if the column which
Andrew Goldenkranz penned at
tacking libertarianism (Dailv,
Feb. 20).
There's nothing wrong with
Goldenkranz's questioning and
criticizing libertarian ideas. In
fact, as a supporter of liber
tarianism, I wish there were
much more public scrutiny and
criticism of the libertarian posi
tion.
When I first ran across liber
tarian ideas, I, like Gold
enkranz, thought that they were
obviously absurd; it was only af
ter a good deal of thinking and
reading about the issues that I
reluctantly became convinced
that libertarianism was a viable
and attractive political philoso
phy. Anyone who accepts the
libertarian philosophy (or any
other position) without subject
ing that position to hard and
probing criticism is guilty of in
tellectual sloppiness if not dis
honesty.
Unfortunately, Goldenkranz
does not question and criticize
positions which libertarians ac
tually hold; instead, he fabri
cates positions himself and then
falsely attributes them to liber
tarians.
For example, he announces
that "libertarians use the word
'atomistic' " to describe indi
vidual decisions in a complex
world.
Although I have read numer
ous books and publications by

libertrians, I know of no case in
which a libertarian used the
word "atomistic" to describe
individual decisions or to de
scribe a possible or desirable
state of society. If Goldenkranz
has even a single example to
back up his claim, 1 would be
eager to see it.
In reality, libertarians con
sistently argue that individual
behavior is not atomistic, but,
on the contrary, that a free soci
ety is a complex spontaneous or
der which coordinates and in
terlinks the knowledge, values
and decisions of individuals.
Libertarians believe that com
plex social interaction and rela
tionships are a natural and nec
essary part of normal human
existence.
Libertarians oppose govern
ment intervention into the so
cial order largely because they
believe that such interventions
invariably produce unforeseen
disruptions and dislocations in
the complex web of social in
terdependence.
Contrary to Goldenkranz's
statement, it is not libertarians
but opponents of libertarianism
who persist in falsely claiming
that a free society would lead to
an atomistic form of social ex
istence.
Nor do libertarians advocate,
as Goldenkranz alleges, "a
Darwinistic political system."
Libertarians oppose existing po
litical systems, such as state so
cialism and welfare-state de
mocracy, because these sys
tems are "Darwinistic," grant
ing nearly unlimited powers and
privileges to those who prove to
be the "fittest" in the struggle
to gain control of state power.
Libertarians believe that the
only acceptable social order is a
non-Darwinistic society in
which every person fully enjoys
justice and human rights re
gardless of his or her power or
social "fitness." Libertarians
wish to abolish the existing
state-created oligopolistic econ
omy of privilge and establish a
free market so that all people,
not just those with political and
economic power, can survive
and prosper.
Goldenkranz also errs in his
implication that libertarians op
pose worker control or man
agement of industry. Liber
tarians do not oppose any form
of social organization — work
er-controlled industry, capital
ist corporations, consumers' co
operatives, communes, etc. —
which arises through voluntary
association without violating
anyone's rights.
As Goldenkranz points out,
some worker-controlled firms
have been in existence for many
years. To a libertarian, this fact
and the fact, which Goldenkranz
documents, that this form of in
dustrial organization may be
come more widespread in the
future demonstrate the essen
tial openness, pluralism, and di
versity which can flower in a
market economy. Libertarians
applaud such pluralism and
openness to innovation as being
among the most valuable
aspects of a free society.

It is not libertarians but rul
ing state socialists, such as
Leonid Brezhnev, who are, in
general, firmly opposed to
worker control of industry. In
deed, most of the beliefs which
Goldenkranz falsely attributes
to libertarians are in fact broad
ly characteristic of state social
ists.
On only one matter is Gold
enkranz correct. Libertarians
do perceive a great difference
between political power and ec
onomic power. General Motors
cannot put a man in jail, force
him to surrender part of his in
come, compel him to buy one of
its products, or force him to
work at one of its facilities.
Government routinely does
all of these things.
A private organization (un
less it is getting special privi
leges from the state) has power
only because of its ability to of
fer positive benefits (em
ployment, a product or service,
etc.) in exchange for labor ser
vices or money. The power of
private organizations is based
on the carrot.
The powers of government
(conscription, taxation, legisla
tion of morality, etc.) are based
on the stick.
Goldenkranz answers that
there is no difference between
these different sorts of power.
While the difference between
the carrot and the stick, be
tween the open hand and the
fist, may seem insignificant to
Goldenkranz, libertarians sus
pect that the difference is likely
to seem great indeed to those
people who are on the receiving
end.
Goldenkranz accuses liber
tarians of favoring "the in
visible fist." On the contrary, in
the basic choice between the
open hand and the fist, liber
tarians opt not, as Goldenkranz
claims, for an invisible fist but
rather for a social order based
on the open hand.
This last issue concerning the ;
nature of power is the only mat
ter in which Goldenkranz's de
scription of libertarians accords
at all with reality; even here his
view if rather distorted. Liber
tarians are not shy about pres
enting their views, and many of
these views are highly con
troversial and fair subject for
debate. Why does Goldenkranz,
instead of attacking these
views, manufacture falsehoods
attributing to libertarians views
they do not expound?
The answer, I suppose, is that
misrepresentation for politics'
sake has become an accepted
part of our society. Goldenkranz
is not unique. No political fac
tion (including libertarians) is
immune.
This must stop. We must re
store a reverence for the facts
and respect for intellectual hon
esty and rigor. Unless we do so,
honest political debate and the
resolution of the serious issues
and problems which confront us
will be impossible.

In reality, libertarians con
sistently argue that individual
behavior is not atomistic, but,
on the contrary, that a free soci
ety is a complex spontaneous or
der which coordinates and in
terlinks the knowledge, values
and decisions of individuals.
Libertarians believe that com
plex social interaction and rela
tionships are a natural and nec
essary part of normal human
existence.
Libertarians oppose govern
ment intervention into the so
cial order largely because they
believe that such interventions
invariably produce unforeseen
disruptions and dislocations in
the complex web of social in
terdependence.
Contrary to Goldenkranz's
statement, it is not libertarians
but opponents of libertarianism
who persist in falsely claiming
that a free society would lead to
an atomistic form of social ex
istence.
Nor do libertarians advocate,
as Goldenkranz alleges, "a
Darwinistic political system."
Libertarians oppose existing po
litical systems, such as state so
cialism and welfare-state de
mocracy, because these sys
tems are "Darwinistic," grant
ing nearly unlimited powers and
privileges to those who prove to
be the "fittest" in the struggle
to gain control of state power.
Libertarians believe that the
only acceptable social order is a
non-Darwinistic society in
which every person fully enjoys
justice and human rights re
gardless of his or her power or
social "fitness." Libertarians
wish to abolish the existing
state-created oligopolistic econ
omy of privilge and establish a
free market so that all people,
not just those with political and
economic power, can survive
and prosper.
Goldenkranz also errs in his
implication that libertarians op
pose worker control or man
agement of industry. Liber
tarians do not oppose any form
of social organization — work
er-controlled industry, capital
ist corporations, consumers' co
operatives, communes, etc. —
which arises through voluntary
association without violating
anyone's rights.
As Goldenkranz points out,
some worker-controlled firms
have been in existence for many
years. To a libertarian, this fact
and the fact, which Goldenkranz
documents, that this form of in
dustrial organization may be
come more widespread in the
future demonstrate the essen
tial openness, pluralism, and di
versity which can flower in a
market economy. Libertarians
applaud such pluralism and
openness to innovation as being
among the most valuable
aspects of a free society.

It is not libertarians but rul
ing state socialists, such as
Leonid Brezhnev, who are, in
general, firmly opposed to
worker control of industry. In
deed, most of the beliefs which
Goldenkranz falsely attributes
to libertarians are in fact broad
ly characteristic of state social
ists.
On only one matter is Gold
enkranz correct. Libertarians
do perceive a great difference
between political power and ec
onomic power. General Motors
cannot put a man in jail, force
him to surrender part of his in
come, compel him to buy one of
its products, or force him to
work at one of its facilities.
Government routinely does
all of these things.
A private organization (un
less it is getting special privi
leges from the state) has power
only because of its ability to of
fer positive benefits (em
ployment, a product or service,
etc.) in exchange for labor ser
vices or money. The power of
private organizations is based
on the carrot.
The powers of government
(conscription, taxation, legisla
tion of morality, etc.) are based
on the stick.
Goldenkranz answers that
there is no difference between
these different sorts of power.
While the difference between
the carrot and the stick, be
tween the open hand and the
fist, may seem insignificant to
Goldenkranz, libertarians sus
pect that the difference is likely
to seem great indeed to those
people who are on the receiving
end.
Goldenkranz accuses liber
tarians of favoring "the in
visible fist." On the contrary, in
the basic choice between the
open hand and the fist, liber
tarians opt not, as Goldenkranz
claims, for an invisible fist but
rather for a social order based
on the open hand.
This last issue concerning the ;
nature of power is the only mat
ter in which Goldenkranz's de
scription of libertarians accords
at all with reality; even here his
view if rather distorted. Liber
tarians are not shy about pres
enting their views, and many of
these views are highly con
troversial and fair subject for
debate. Why does Goldenkranz,
instead of attacking these
views, manufacture falsehoods
attributing to libertarians views
they do not expound?
The answer, I suppose, is that
misrepresentation for politics'
sake has become an accepted
part of our society. Goldenkranz
is not unique. No political fac
tion (including libertarians) is
immune.
This must stop. We must re
store a reverence for the facts
and respect for intellectual hon
esty and rigor. Unless we do so,
honest political debate and the
resolution of the serious issues
and problems which confront us
will be impossible.

One of the serious problems
with much of the current politi
cal discussion and commentary
in this country is the lack not
only of common civility but
even of simple honesty. Some
rightists falsely accuse anyone
who questions the need for our
bloated defense establishment
of being a tool of the Com
munists; many leftists falsely
label anyone who questions the
utility of the ever-expanding
welfare state as being a neo
fascist who hates the poor.
This sort of misrepresenta
tion and reckless disregard of
the truth makes honest political
debate and discussion nearly
impossible.
An example of such pre
variacation if the column which
Andrew Goldenkranz penned at
tacking libertarianism (Dailv,
Feb. 20).
There's nothing wrong with
Goldenkranz's questioning and
criticizing libertarian ideas. In
fact, as a supporter of liber
tarianism, I wish there were
much more public scrutiny and
criticism of the libertarian posi
tion.
When I first ran across liber
tarian ideas, I, like Gold
enkranz, thought that they were
obviously absurd; it was only af
ter a good deal of thinking and
reading about the issues that I
reluctantly became convinced
that libertarianism was a viable
and attractive political philoso
phy. Anyone who accepts the
libertarian philosophy (or any
other position) without subject
ing that position to hard and
probing criticism is guilty of in
tellectual sloppiness if not dis
honesty.
Unfortunately, Goldenkranz
does not question and criticize
positions which libertarians ac
tually hold; instead, he fabri
cates positions himself and then
falsely attributes them to liber
tarians.
For example, he announces
that "libertarians use the word
'atomistic' " to describe indi
vidual decisions in a complex
world.
Although I have read numer
ous books and publications by

libertrians, I know of no case in
which a libertarian used the
word "atomistic" to describe
individual decisions or to de
scribe a possible or desirable
state of society. If Goldenkranz
has even a single example to
back up his claim, 1 would be
eager to see it.

dustrial organization may be
come more widespread in the
future demonstrate the essen
tial openness, pluralism, and di
versity which can flower in a
market economy. Libertarians
applaud such pluralism and
openness to innovation as being
among the most valuable
aspects of a free society.

It is not libertarians but rul
ing state socialists, such as
Leonid Brezhnev, who are, in
general, firmly opposed to
worker control of industry. In
deed, most of the beliefs which
Goldenkranz falsely attributes
to libertarians are in fact broad
ly characteristic of state social
ists.
On only one matter is Gold
enkranz correct. Libertarians
do perceive a great difference
between political power and ec
onomic power. General Motors
cannot put a man in jail, force
him to surrender part of his in
come, compel him to buy one of
its products, or force him to
work at one of its facilities.
Government routinely does
all of these things.
A private organization (un
less it is getting special privi
leges from the state) has power
only because of its ability to of
fer positive benefits (em
ployment, a product or service,
etc.) in exchange for labor ser
vices or money. The power of
private organizations is based
on the carrot.
The powers of government
(conscription, taxation, legisla
tion of morality, etc.) are based
on the stick.
Goldenkranz answers that
there is no difference between
these different sorts of power.
While the difference between
the carrot and the stick, be
tween the open hand and the
fist, may seem insignificant to
Goldenkranz, libertarians sus
pect that the difference is likely
to seem great indeed to those
people who are on the receiving
end.
Goldenkranz accuses liber
tarians of favoring "the in
visible fist." On the contrary, in
the basic choice between the
open hand and the fist, liber
tarians opt not, as Goldenkranz
claims, for an invisible fist but
rather for a social order based
on the open hand.
This last issue concerning the ;
nature of power is the only mat
ter in which Goldenkranz's de
scription of libertarians accords
at all with reality; even here his
view if rather distorted. Liber
tarians are not shy about pres
enting their views, and many of
these views are highly con
troversial and fair subject for
debate. Why does Goldenkranz,
instead of attacking these
views, manufacture falsehoods
attributing to libertarians views
they do not expound?
The answer, I suppose, is that
misrepresentation for politics'
sake has become an accepted
part of our society. Goldenkranz
is not unique. No political fac
tion (including libertarians) is
immune.
This must stop. We must re
store a reverence for the facts
and respect for intellectual hon
esty and rigor. Unless we do so,
honest political debate and the
resolution of the serious issues
and problems which confront us
will be impossible.
