## Los Angeles forced busing halted; transition goes smoothly 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Los Angeles (AP) — About
7300 children returned to neigh
borhood schools yesterday for
the first time this school year as
mandatory busing came to halt
in the nation's second largest
public school district.
The transition, a month after
the school board voted to dis
mantle the 23,000-student man
datory busing program, ap
peared to be going smoothly.
The other 15,700 students opted
to remain with busing volun
tarily for the last 10 weeks of the
school year.
"It seems to be going as
planned," school district
spokesman Pat Spencer said.
"The transportation people said
it was a quieter Monday than
usual."
One of the last challenges to
the school board's decision to

stop forced busing was set
aside, at least temporarily, late
Sunday as public schools were
winding up a 10-day Easter
break.
Rehnquist refuses challenge
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
William Rehnquist refused to
order the desegregation busing
of 23,000 students to continue,
although he said his final de
cision on an appeal by the Na
tional Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People
(NAACP) would not come until
at least the middle of the week.
"They came, they're back,
they're happy to be back," said
Philip Nassief, principal of
McClay Junior High in
Pacoima, which gained 65 stu
dents. "Kids adjust very rapid
ly."
"The general mood is fine,"
said Jane Fanganiello, adminis

trative dean at Pacoima Junior
High school, which absorbed be
tween 180 and 200 returning stu
dents. "We will be a little bit
crowded," she added.
The school got four or five
new teachers of 50 hired by the
board for schools swollen by re
turning children, she said.
At McClay, Nassief said the
board authorized overtime
payments for teachers handling
an extra period during the
school day.
Question unanswered
Rehnquist left unanswered
the question of how a resump
tion of the mandatory busing
plan might actually be ac
complished, once the dismantl
ing progress begins.
In a four-sentence order,
Rehnquist refused to grant a
last-minute plea by the NAACP
to keep busing in effect.

The NAACP contended that
abandoning the program will
lead to a large increase in racial
segregation within the Los An
geles public school system
Time a factor
The justice, who deliberated
about the decision for seven
hours, said he was unable to act
upon the NAACP's request in
such a short time. He had re
ceived the NAACP's court pa
pers here in mid-afternoon Sun
day.

Rehnquist ordered the school
district to file a written re
sponse to the NAACP by 8 p.m.
(EST) tomorrow Meanwhile,
he said he will leave standing an
order issued Saturday night by
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
9th Circuit, allowing the district
to abandon manadtory busing.
"Much as it would be de
sirable for me as Circuit Justice
for the 9th Circuit to act im
mediately upon (the NAACP's)
request for a stay, I find that I

cannot, in the proper discharge
of my judicial duties act without
benefit of a response from the
(school disctrict)," Rehnquist
wrote.
Rehnquist's action meant
that, for the time being, at least,
the comprehensive school de
segregation plan that has been
in effect in Los Angeles since
1978 ended yesterday.
The plan, ordered by Los An
geles Superior Court Judge Paul
Egly, required busing more

than 23,000 of the school dis
trict's 529,000 pupils Another
30,000 or so were taking part in
voluntary busing plans
Under terms of the dismantl
ing operation ordered by the
school board March 16, follow
ing a series of decisions in state
court, all youngsters in the man
datory program were told they
could return to neighborhood
schools or continue in the
schools they had attended since

U.S. Supreme Court Justice
William Rehnquist refused to
order the desegregation busing
of 23,000 students to continue,
although he said his final de
cision on an appeal by the Na
tional Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People
(NAACP) would not come until
at least the middle of the week.
"They came, they're back,
they're happy to be back," said
Philip Nassief, principal of
McClay Junior High in
Pacoima, which gained 65 stu
dents. "Kids adjust very rapid
ly."
"The general mood is fine,"
said Jane Fanganiello, adminis

trative dean at Pacoima Junior
High school, which absorbed be
tween 180 and 200 returning stu
dents. "We will be a little bit
crowded," she added.
The school got four or five
new teachers of 50 hired by the
board for schools swollen by re
turning children, she said.
At McClay, Nassief said the
board authorized overtime
payments for teachers handling
an extra period during the
school day.
Question unanswered
Rehnquist left unanswered
the question of how a resump
tion of the mandatory busing
plan might actually be ac
complished, once the dismantl
ing progress begins.
In a four-sentence order,
Rehnquist refused to grant a
last-minute plea by the NAACP
to keep busing in effect.

The NAACP contended that
abandoning the program will
lead to a large increase in racial
segregation within the Los An
geles public school system
Time a factor
The justice, who deliberated
about the decision for seven
hours, said he was unable to act
upon the NAACP's request in
such a short time. He had re
ceived the NAACP's court pa
pers here in mid-afternoon Sun
day.

Rehnquist ordered the school
district to file a written re
sponse to the NAACP by 8 p.m.
(EST) tomorrow Meanwhile,
he said he will leave standing an
order issued Saturday night by
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
9th Circuit, allowing the district
to abandon manadtory busing.
"Much as it would be de
sirable for me as Circuit Justice
for the 9th Circuit to act im
mediately upon (the NAACP's)
request for a stay, I find that I

cannot, in the proper discharge
of my judicial duties act without
benefit of a response from the
(school disctrict)," Rehnquist
wrote.
Rehnquist's action meant
that, for the time being, at least,
the comprehensive school de
segregation plan that has been
in effect in Los Angeles since
1978 ended yesterday.
The plan, ordered by Los An
geles Superior Court Judge Paul
Egly, required busing more

than 23,000 of the school dis
trict's 529,000 pupils Another
30,000 or so were taking part in
voluntary busing plans
Under terms of the dismantl
ing operation ordered by the
school board March 16, follow
ing a series of decisions in state
court, all youngsters in the man
datory program were told they
could return to neighborhood
schools or continue in the
schools they had attended since
the beginning of this year
From the Daily wire services
Los Angeles (AP) — About
7300 children returned to neigh
borhood schools yesterday for
the first time this school year as
mandatory busing came to halt
in the nation's second largest
public school district.
The transition, a month after
the school board voted to dis
mantle the 23,000-student man
datory busing program, ap
peared to be going smoothly.
The other 15,700 students opted
to remain with busing volun
tarily for the last 10 weeks of the
school year.
"It seems to be going as
planned," school district
spokesman Pat Spencer said.
"The transportation people said
it was a quieter Monday than
usual."
One of the last challenges to
the school board's decision to

stop forced busing was set
aside, at least temporarily, late
Sunday as public schools were
winding up a 10-day Easter
break.
