# Special assessment vote considered
## 
### Mike Resnick 
Last week's elections are over, but
the future of 10 of the 17 fee
assessments which appeared on the
ballot is still undecided. The proposals
were not certified primarily because
the necessary 20 percent of the student
body — 2349 people — did not vote on
those individual measures.
A special election, solely for these
fee assessments, is a possibility.
A special ASSU Senate meeting,
scheduled for 8 a.m. yesterday, did not
begin until 8:50 when the requisite
number of senators to constitute a
quorum was finally present. Senate
Chairman Doug Mitchell ruled that a
special election would be unconstitu
tional and asked if there were any mo
tions to overrule his interpretation of
the constitution. Receiving none,
Mitchell adjourned the meeting two
minutes after he called it to order.
According to Senate Parlia
mentarian Tom Harrell, however,
there may a question as to whether
yesterday's meeting was valid.
The ASSU By-Laws state that "no
tice of special meetings must be given
in the Stanford Daily on the day
before or the day of such meeting if the
Daily is being published. If the Daily is
not being published the Chairperson of
the Senate shall make a reasonable ef
fort to contact every member if a spe
cial meeting is to be held."
Because the Daily was not pub
lished yesterday, no notice of the
meeting appeared. Mitchell did try to
contact senate members, however.
If the special meeting is found to be
invalid, Mitchell will have to restate
his interpretation of the ASSU Con
stitution either tomorrow night at
their meeting or at a subsequent sen
ate meeting. At that time, if three
fifths of the senate disagees with
Mitchell's interpretation, it could be
overruled, and a special election
would be called this quarter.
A similar situation occurred three

years ago when low voter turnout
caused the fee assessments not to be
enacted. The ASSU Constitution states
that a new election for fee
assessments may not be held until the
quarter after the assessments are de
feated. Then senate Chair Fred
Grethel ruled that the proposals had
not been defeated — they had only
failed to meet the requirements for
certification because of the low voter
turnout — and that a special election
could, therefore, be held.
If this reasoning were applied now,
only two of the assessments, those
proposed by the Stanford Progressive
Alliance and the Academic Organiza
tions Board, would have been con
sidered defeated. The other eight or
ganizations — the Student-Alumni
Network, SCOPE, The Publications

Board, the Program Fee, Legal Coun
seling, the Graduate Student Associa
tion, the Boathouse and Volunteers in
Asia — would all be eligible for a spe
cial election.
Even if both yesterday's meeting
and Mitchell's interpretation are
found to be valid, there are two options
open to the groups still hoping for a fee
assessment. According to Mitchell, if
a group should change its original pro
posal — from a one-quarter fee
assessment to a multiple-quarter
assessment, for example — it would
be able to hold a special election, but
at its own cost. The cost would be
shared by several groups partici
pating in the same election. The con
stitution also provides for organiza
tions to hold a special election, again
