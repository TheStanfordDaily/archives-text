# Fake story called editors' fault
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — A fake story in the Wash
ington Post that won a Pulitzer Prize was pub
lished because of the inexcusable failure of edi
tors to do their jobs, the newspaper has con
cluded.
In a report to readers which covered 3V2 pages
in the Sunday edition, the Post's ombudsman, Bill
Green, said the made-up story of an 8-year-old
heroin addict got in the newspaper because of
"the failure of a system that, in another industry,
might be called 'quality control.' On newspapers,
it is called editing."
The story, "Jimmy's World," was awarded the
prize in the feature category on April 13 On
Wednesday, two days later, the reporter who
wrote it, Janet Cooke, admitted the fabrication,
returned the prize and resigned.
Green's account was based on 47 interviews.
Miss Cooke declined to be interviewed.
"It was a complete systems failure, and there's
no excuse for it," said Green.
One of the major flaws, Green concluded, was
that in reporting the story, Miss Cooke was prom
ised anonymity for her sources and was never
forced to reveal them to her editors.
Miss Cooke's editors "should have asked tough
questions. . . And every staffer who had a serious
doubt about 'Jimmy' had an unavoidable respon
sibility to pursue it, hard," Green concluded.
Green also concluded that "this business of

trusting reporters absolutely goes too far. Clearly
it did in this case. Editors have to insist on know
ing and verifying. That's one of the big reasons
they hold their jobs."
The ombudsman noted that doubts of other re
porters and first-line editors never reached senior
editors. "While editors repeatedly talked about
their trust in reporters, the trust apparently ap
plies only to written stories, not to reporters' opin
ions. Otherwise, somebody with authority would
have heard something about those persistent
doubts on the Cooke story and would have in
vestigated," he said.
Ben Bradlee, executive editor, told Green that
"nobody ever came in . . . and said, 'I have doubts
about the story' — before or after publication —
and nobody said someone else had misgivings
about the story."
The Post, "given its competitive nature, may
very well have unwittingly encouraged (Miss
Cooke's) success and thereby hastened her fail
ure," Green wrote. "Hers was an aberration that
grew in fertile ground, according to one reporter.
That's close to the mark."
After the story was published last September,
District of Columbia police and Mayor Marion
Barry said they did not believe it was true. Police
and social agencies hunted for the child but could
not find him.
