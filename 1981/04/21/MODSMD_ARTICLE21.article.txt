# Richardson called anti-Semite
## Reagan appointment challenged 
### Washington Post 
Washington — New background informa
tion has begun to emerge on Warren Rich
ardson, a former Liberty Lobby official
whose appointment as assistant secretary
for legislation of the Department of Health
and Human Services has been put in
jeopardy by allegations of anti-Semitism.
The information is contained in a 1970
joint interview with Richardson, then gen
eral counsel of Liberty Lobby, and Curtis
Dall, then head of the organization, pub
lished in the November 1970 True magazine.
During the interview, Richardson sat by
while Dall repeatedly declared that Zionism
is dedicated to "political and financial
world domination," that the Rothschild
banking family (a Jewish family) is the
head of a "one-world, large-monied group"
that finances both communism and social
ism and that Jacob Schiff, a wealthy Ameri
can, "gave $17 million or more to start com
munism."
Richardson himself didn't voice any such
specific charges, but at one point he did, in a
fleeting, somewhat unclear reference, use
the phrase "the international money or
der," an expression sometimes employed
as a code-word for the concept of an interna
tional Jewish or bankers' alleged plan to
control the world.
In other parts of the interview Rich
ardson said that there were probably more
than 750 security risks working for the State
Dept. that "much of the sex education in the
public schools ... is designed openly and
unashamedly to destroy all of our classic
mores and moral values" and that the "ex
cesses of a permissive America" parallel

"the degenerate fall of Rome."
Richardson, who worked for Liberty Lob
by from 1969 to 1973, could not be reached
for comment Saturday on the True in
terview, and HHS officials declined to com
ment.
The appointment of Richardson, who has
also worked for the National Right to Work
Committee, National Lumber Manufac
turers Association, General Accounting Of
fice, Justice Dept. and Associated General
Contractors, was challenged last week by
Rep. Samuel Gejdenson (D-Conn.) and by
the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith.
They charged that Liberty Lobby was an
anti-Semitic organization. Gejdenson at
that time cited an article under Rich
ardson's byline in the May 18, 1971 New
York Times, opposing U.S. intervention in
the Mideast, which said, "Liberty Lobby
will not tag along with the cowards who
would rather countenance another national
disaster than brave the screams of the pro-
Zionist 'free press' in America."
Gjedenson said in an interview yesterday
that the True interview broadens "the pic
ture of where these people and Mr. Rich
ardson are coming from"and shows that
Richardson's New York Times article
"wasn't an idiosyncratic" isolated case but
typical of "what the organization stands
for."
Richardson and Liberty Lobby have de
nied the allegations of anti-Semitism, and
he says the sentence cited was added to the
article by someone else without his knowl
edge. But both HHS Secretary Richard
Schweiker and the White House have or

dered an investigation.
In the True magazine article, Dall, a
former son-in-law of the late President
Franklin Roosevelt, had just finished a reci
tation of his view that Rothschild and Schiff
money and Zionism were behind the "one
world plans of the international bankers" to
destroy the United States, when the in
terviewer asked if the Liberty Lobby sup
ported the House Internal Security subcom
mittee.
But Richardson interjected, "Whether
communism is part of the international
money order or not isn't too material to your
specific question. The point is we must pro
tect ourselves against what is obviously the
source of attack" — meaning communism.
Dall then said that the "financial one
world plan to destroy us" includes "pene
tration of the financial enemy's agents into
the various colleges." Richardson, seem
ingly agreeing, said, "It's a technique. The
communists feed input into the colleges
about ecology and future horrors."
Other materials from the period when
Richardson was with the Liberty Lobby
have also been obtained by the Washington
Past. In one 1972 letter to subscribers to Lib
erty Letter, Dall appealed for a big increase
in subscriptions to help counteract "the
well-heeled and extremely vocal 'minority'
machine, the labor bosses, and the super
rich international banking and CFR (Coun
cil on Foreign Relations, a favorite Liberty
Lobby target) interests."
Liberty Lobby, in statements to the press
and a letter to President Ronald Reagan
Friday, said it is anti-Zionist but not anti-Se
mitic.
