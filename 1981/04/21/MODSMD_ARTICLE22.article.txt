# Artist builds abstraction of a nest
## 
### Debbie Walker 
Nestled among the rolling
green hills and Redwood groves
of the coast range behind Palo
Alto, Stanford visiting artist
Barbara Greenberg is creating
a huge nest-like structure out of
ash and willow branches.
Standing 18 feet high with a
base 14 feet wide, the
"elongated hemisphere" will be
transported to the campus in
late May.
The branch sculpture, which
is held together with bits of rag
and wire, will then be allowed to
disintegrate naturally.
"I began working with
branches about a year ago,"
Greenberg said. 'They are so
beautiful, and they allow you to
work with a rougher line."
Greenberg is the second
Pamel Djerassi visiting artist
— a possition made possible by
the Djerassi Foundation in
memory of the late artist. Each
year a panel from the Stanford
Art Department and the Center
for Research on Women
(CROW) selects a female artist
based on the recommendations
of international art experts.
Greenberg said she did not be
come serious about her art until
after she graduated from Ben
nington with a degree in Eng

lish.
"After college I found myself
in an office," Greenberg said,
"and one day as I was counting
out 250 sheets of paper, I really
began questioning my posi
tion."
Greenberg said she spent sev
eral years building a house and
pursuing her interest in weav
ing. Fascinated by the tech
niques used to blend colors in
Polish rugs, she decided to
travel to Poland to observe the
rug making process first hand.
The Polish government then
offered her a stipend to study
weaving at the Academy of Fine
Arts in Krakow where she re
mained for six months.
During this period Greenberg
met Magdalena Abakaowicz,
the artist who has heavily in
fluenced Greenberg's work.
"Magdalena concentrated on
large environmental pieces,"
Greenberg said. "She would
talk about space and time as if
they are things you can move
around with your hands."
Under Abakanowicz's
tutelage, Greenberg completed
a series of large hanging
tapestries inspired by a group of
stones in Scotland which re
semble Stonehenge.
It was also at the Academy

that Greenberg met a young
Polish painter named Pawel
Kromholz. The two artists were
married and then left for Den
mark where they both exhibited
their work in 1977
The couple now maintains
permanent residence on the top
floor of a building in New York
City's garment district.
"The Empire State Building
is on one side, and you can see
the Hudson on the other,"
Greenberg said. "I think the
only drawback to our large con
crete space is the cold. We have
to bribe the custodian to leave
the heat on us."
Greenberg said their loft
serves as both residence and
studio, but she is not able to de
vote all of her time to art.
"My work is basically un
salable since it usually consists
of large pieces that will disinte
grate," Greenberg said. "There
is really no market since most
people are interested in
purchasing art as an invest
ment."
Greenberg does statistical re
search for the Japanese govern
ment four days a week and
Kromholz restores antiquities.
The two artists are now work
ing together in Pamela
Djerassi's former studio and

residence on Skyline Ridge
north of Palo Alto.
Greenberg said there is no
difficulty with both working in
the same studio.
"If we criticized each other's
work, things would be hard, but
we've had a mutual positive in
fluence on each other,"
Greenberg said. "My work is
becoming more geometric and
Pawel is now working in three
dimension, something he has
never done before."
Greenberg's most immediate
artistic interest is what she
terms the "Hill Project." She
has rented 250 orange traffic
markers for the coming week
end and plans to make an ar
rangement on the steep green
hillside behind the house.
"The hills are so tempting,"
Greenberg said. "It is hard to
avoid thinking of them as a type
of canvas. The traffic markers
should like short orange pen
strokes.
Greenberg has invited all in
terested individuals to join her
this coming Saturday and Sun
day afternoon to arrange the
markers.
"It should be very interest
ing, and it is a means of involv
ing the community," Greenberg
said.

Greenberg said their loft
serves as both residence and
studio, but she is not able to de
vote all of her time to art.
"My work is basically un
salable since it usually consists
of large pieces that will disinte
grate," Greenberg said. "There
is really no market since most
people are interested in
purchasing art as an invest
ment."
Greenberg does statistical re
search for the Japanese govern
ment four days a week and
Kromholz restores antiquities.
The two artists are now work
ing together in Pamela
Djerassi's former studio and

residence on Skyline Ridge
north of Palo Alto.
Greenberg said there is no
difficulty with both working in
the same studio.
"If we criticized each other's
work, things would be hard, but
we've had a mutual positive in
fluence on each other,"
Greenberg said. "My work is
becoming more geometric and
Pawel is now working in three
dimension, something he has
never done before."
Greenberg's most immediate
artistic interest is what she
terms the "Hill Project." She
has rented 250 orange traffic
markers for the coming week
end and plans to make an ar
rangement on the steep green
hillside behind the house.
"The hills are so tempting,"
Greenberg said. "It is hard to
avoid thinking of them as a type
of canvas. The traffic markers
should like short orange pen
strokes.
Greenberg has invited all in
terested individuals to join her
this coming Saturday and Sun
day afternoon to arrange the
markers.
"It should be very interest
ing, and it is a means of involv
ing the community," Greenberg
said.

Visiting artist Barbara Greenberg and her husband Pawel
Kromholz, a painter, live and work together ii) a residence/studio
on Skyline Ridge.
Nestled among the rolling
green hills and Redwood groves
of the coast range behind Palo
Alto, Stanford visiting artist
Barbara Greenberg is creating
a huge nest-like structure out of
ash and willow branches.
Standing 18 feet high with a
base 14 feet wide, the
"elongated hemisphere" will be
transported to the campus in
late May.
The branch sculpture, which
is held together with bits of rag
and wire, will then be allowed to
disintegrate naturally.
"I began working with
branches about a year ago,"
Greenberg said. 'They are so
beautiful, and they allow you to
work with a rougher line."
Greenberg is the second
Pamel Djerassi visiting artist
— a possition made possible by
the Djerassi Foundation in
memory of the late artist. Each
year a panel from the Stanford
Art Department and the Center
for Research on Women
(CROW) selects a female artist
based on the recommendations
of international art experts.
Greenberg said she did not be
come serious about her art until
after she graduated from Ben
nington with a degree in Eng

lish.
"After college I found myself
in an office," Greenberg said,
"and one day as I was counting
out 250 sheets of paper, I really
began questioning my posi
tion."
Greenberg said she spent sev
eral years building a house and
pursuing her interest in weav
ing. Fascinated by the tech
niques used to blend colors in
Polish rugs, she decided to
travel to Poland to observe the
rug making process first hand.
The Polish government then
offered her a stipend to study
weaving at the Academy of Fine
Arts in Krakow where she re
mained for six months.
During this period Greenberg
met Magdalena Abakaowicz,
the artist who has heavily in
fluenced Greenberg's work.
"Magdalena concentrated on
large environmental pieces,"
Greenberg said. "She would
talk about space and time as if
they are things you can move
around with your hands."
Under Abakanowicz's
tutelage, Greenberg completed
a series of large hanging
tapestries inspired by a group of
stones in Scotland which re
semble Stonehenge.
It was also at the Academy

that Greenberg met a young
Polish painter named Pawel
Kromholz. The two artists were
married and then left for Den
mark where they both exhibited
their work in 1977
The couple now maintains
permanent residence on the top
floor of a building in New York
City's garment district.
"The Empire State Building
is on one side, and you can see
the Hudson on the other,"
Greenberg said. "I think the
only drawback to our large con
crete space is the cold. We have
to bribe the custodian to leave
the heat on us."
