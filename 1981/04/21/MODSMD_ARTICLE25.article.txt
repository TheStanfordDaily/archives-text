## Haynie carries the weight in Shepard's 'True West' 
### Tom Casciato 
I Sam Shepard's True West is a
hilarious play. It's also a brutal, loveless
play. It has a certain randomness about
it that makes it very refreshing, yet it
doesn't seem to really be about any
thing.
The story concerns two brothers who
lead vastly different lives, and have not
seen each other in five years. Austin, the
younger, has a wife, a suburban home in
Northern California, an ivy league
education and a commitment from a
112 slick Hollywood producer to film a
screenplay he is going to write. His
: brother Lee seems to have spent most of
| his life hanging around in the desert,
X emerging every so often to steal a tele-
I vision set or two. While Austin is minding
1 their mother's home in Southern Califor
nia, Lee comes to call.
Lee is a mean and imposing figure:
slightly deranged, very dirty and on the
whole, quite unpleasant. He meets the
producer, intimidates him into playing
golf with him, then wins the game. In the
process, he wins a bet: the producer
must produce a script Lee wants to
write, a modern western. Of course Lee
I can't write, so Austin is commissioned to
I write the script, while his own project is
I dropped. Bitterly, Austin agrees.

Jim Haynie, as Lee, almost single
handedly carries the Magic Theatre's
production of True West. Haynie is what
is known as a consummate actor; he acts
with his eyes, his hands, even the veins in
his neck. He can switch gears from angry
to contrite to paranoid with a few sublte
shifts in posture. And he handles under
stated humor — as when he tells Austin
that their mother might just as well have
asked him to mind the house — and
slapstick — as when he tears the phone
off the wall when the operator tells him
there are ten Melanie Fergusons in Bak
ersfield — with equal aplomb.
Ebbe Roe Smith, as Austin, is less suc
cessful. Where Haynie's acting betrays
no trace of self-consciousness, Smith's
often seems painfully conscious. But
while anyone sharing a stage with Hay
nie would be at a distinct disadvantage in
terms of comparison, Smith wisely tries
to play off him, rather than against him.
Unfortunately, the limitations of the
script work against Smith. In the opening
scenes, Austin is no more than a straight
man for Lee, asking him questions and
reacting to his threatening (funny, to the
audience) remarks.
Later, Austin is drunk, and Smith gets
a chance to take part in the comedy. He
bets Lee that he can steal a toaster, and

ends up not only stealing about 15 of
them, but, in a classic comic scene, ac
tually makes toast in every one of them.
Yet while Smith seems to act a better
drunk than sober person, the script re
quires him to stay bombed far longer
than he can make drunkenness seem
amusing or interesting, and the play be
gins to drag.
Tom Dahlgren is appropriately slimy
as Saul Kimmer, the producer, and Carol
McElheney, as the boys' mother, adds a
nice comic touch to the plays' final
scene, in which she arrives to find her
kitchen a mess (there is, of course, toast
everywhere).
Yet Shepard seems to have crammed
the mother's role into the script with a
ramrod. She makes a few funny com
ments about the state of the kitchen, then
suggests that they all go see Picasso, be
cause she read in the paper on the
Greyhound from Alaska that he's going
to be at the museum (she doesn't know
he's dead). Then she watches coldly as
Austin tries to strangle Lee with a tele
phone cord.
The Picasso bit comes from some
where out in left field, and it's the kind of
outrageous writing that can be so amus
ing in Shepard's plays — he pulls the

same kind of thing off with Austin's
bizarre monologue about their fathers'
teeth. But in this case, the device — and
it is a device — seems simply forced And
why is the mother there in the frist
place? To talk about the kitchen? To
show that she is just as insensitive as the
rest of the family?
And what, really, is True West about?
There are vague comparisons between
Hollywood and the Old West, implied
comments on the vacuousness of sub
urban living, random thoughts on the va
lidity of "real life" versus fiction. But
the problem is that it's all random. Per
haps the author figures that anyone who
would come to one of his plays already
assumes that the Old West was better
than present-day Hollywood, that sub
urban life is indeed vacuous, and that fic
tion doesn't necessarily provide more
truth than experience. But if one doesn't
share Shepard's vision in the first place,
he offers no convincing evidence that it is
legitimate. Without the superb acting of
Jim Haynie, the whole thing might fall
flat on its face.
