# 'Feeding' really puts you off
## 
### Stephen Nash 
"Life is a rat race." An over
worked metaphor to be sure, but
the competition of the business
world has caused the division
between the word and the image
to disappear. Every situation is
then seen only in terms of win
ning and losing, and the
metaphor has become a
tautology.
"The Feeding" by Pat Feif
fer (at the Magic Theatre) is
about a famly where game
playing is the only form of com
munication left. There are six
principal competitors — two tri
angles a generation apart. The
first involves Karl (a Silicon
Valley research physicist), his
alcoholic wife Elizabeth, and
his boss Douglas (who is having
an affair with Elizabeth). The
second involves Douglas' son
Todd (who corresponds to
Karl), and Karl's two younger
children, Brian and Kathy
(loosely corresponding to
Douglas and Elizabeth). Some
what removed from the arena
are Karl's eldest son Roger
(who is generally stoned) and
Elizabeth's mother (whose age
and morals keep her from par
ticipating.)
This disparate collection of
generally obnoxious characters
has moved far beyond the parlor
games of polite society. The
only games that are still of in
terest to them have high stakes.
They are gambling not with
nickels and matchsticks, but
with marriages, careers, sani
ty and lives.
A play containing as many un

pleasant characters as this one
runs the very great risk of being
unpleasant rather than en
lightening. That is generally
what has happened in this case.
The central roles of Todd (Phil
ip Horritz) and Karl (J.E. Free
man) are played unrelentingly
as spoiled brats, so that the au
dience has no sympathy for
them.
A notable exception is Joanna
Frix-Lokey as Elizabeth. Her
acting implies that Elizabeth is
an unwilling addict to the game
playing, rather than an over
aged child who never grew out
of it.
The direction (by Alan Duke)
contributes to the feeling of un
pleasantness. There is little
sense that the characters are

trapped in an addictive maze of
competition and hate (a feeling
the author, in her program
notes, seems to desire). The
characters do not fight against
each other, but act instead in
isolation, leaving the general
situation of the play un
motivated.
If acted differently — with the
characters hinting at their more
innocent pasts, and with a far
strong sense of a collective, ad
dictive hate — this play could be
highly compelling. As it is, it is
merely off-putting.
