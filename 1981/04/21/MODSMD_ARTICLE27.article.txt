# 'A Friendly Card' good, if spacey
## 
### David Schmelzer 
It tells something about a
band's emphasis when the man
after whom it's named isn't a
lead singer or instrumentalist,
but is its producer and co-com
poser. The Alan Parsons
Project isn't geared towards es
tablishing a "star." They don't
even have a lead singer, but in
stead have a rotating ensemble
of four. Because of this, their
albums have to be looked at as
units held together by the writ
ing and smooth production, and
not as collections of catchy
tunes.
This concept, along with their
unusual topic choices, have giv
en the group a bizarre, spacey
image. And there's no denying
it, they are spacey. How many
other groups have made an
album by putting the works of
Edgar Allan Poe to music?
What other band has a new
album out that has a recurring
medieval (you read it right â€”
medieval) theme?
This album, The Turn of a
Friendly Card, tells what the
ads describe as "a magnificent
tale of obsession." The ob
session in this case is gambling,
although that's not instantly ap
parent because of the mys
terious (one might even say
"spacey") mood of the music.
The Parson's Project keeps the
image of dark, murky, desper
ate doings throughout by
playing on emotions with alter
nately frenzied and languid pac
ing.
The first thing one hears on
the album is a solemn trumpet
fanfare of the type that might
have announced the coming of
King Arthur. A narrator tell sof
evil creeping into a house after
its master has left and his "ser
vants (have) decided to play."
He worries that "something un
righteous is possessing (his)
soul" and that, because of this
black force, "there may be a
price to pay."
Then they cut from this house
of dread to someone beginning
to panic as he sees his youth
leaving him. He doesn't want to
leave the world of excitement
and vitality for one in which
"nobody gives us a damn."
What can he do to keep this

youth? What's his answer? May
be he should join "games people
play in the middle of the night."
The inexorable pull of time
finally convinces him to make
the move and go through a door
that he never should have en
tered. But once through it, he
can't go back home.
Inside he sees emotionless
men and "a wheel in perpetual
motion." Caught up in the
games and gripped with a need
to play even when he's in trou
ble, the obsessed gambler loses
all he has.
Parsons and Eric Woolfson
capture the seductive nature of
this possession in the tone of
their music. One can feel
himself being swept away in
"Time" 's current. And during
"The Gold Bug," an instrumen
tal, it's not hard to see a man at
the doorway of a casino watch
ing a panorama of cool, hard
boiled gamblers throwing their
money down.
The band's musical imagery
adds to this picture as well.
They obviously feel a mysticism
in the mood of the Middle Ages.
They use that mood in the
trumpet fanfare at the begin
ning, and in lute and guitar pas
sages straight from the days of
wandering minstrels in the title
song, and in "The Ace of
Swords." "Snake Eyes," the
song where the gambling fever
builds, opens with the sound of
change tinkling and a pounding
heartbeat of percussion.

They don't forget about lyr
ical imagery either. To their ob
sessed gambler, the casino is a
cathedral complete with a
stained-glass window decorated
with a king of diamonds.
Parsons and Woolfson also show
a talent for creating an artistic
phrase, writing, "There's a sign
in the desert that lies to the
west/Where you can't tell the
night from the sunrise," rather
than "In Las Vegas ..." And
they perceive irony. Their un
smiling, chain-wearing,
roulette-wheel operators in
"Turn of a Friendly Card" be
come unsmiling gamblers
shackled to a perpetually spin

ning wheel in the song's reprise.
Here their medieval image is
one of a torture chamber.
The Turn of a Friendly Card
is a theme album on more than
one level, and the Alan Parsons
Project takes the theme as far
as it can be taken. It's easy, and
sometimes even soothing, to lis
ten to. But it's also disconcert
ing. One has the feeling that
one's stepped into the midst of a
black ritual, which is, of course,
what the group is striving for. A
brilliant record in many ways,
The Turn of a Friendly Card is
finely executed and thought-out,
but it's . . . well, spacey.
