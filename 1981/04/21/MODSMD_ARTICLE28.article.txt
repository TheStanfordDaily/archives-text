# 'Homes'provides rapport

Small theatre in San Fran
cisco is one of the special
pleasures of living in the Bay
Area. Most of the shows are
local productions of new lo
cal plays, making for a
unique neighborly ex
perience. Because of their
size, the 99-seat theatres
have an intimacy which
could not be moved to a larg
er stage. There is the op
portunity for emotional con
tact between performer and
audience — the greatest ex
citement of live per
formance.
"Mobile Homes" by Eliz
abeth Wray exploits as well
as explores the rapport be
tween performer and au
dience. Now in its premiere
run at San Francisco's Julian
Theatre, it's about Ava — a
Bette Midler-like rock singer
— running away from her
newly-gentrified neighbor
hood in Baltimore in the hope
of making a career for
herself in San Francisco.
In Act I, she's pushed for
ward by Katie (her prim,
childhood friend who tries to
pretend she's liberated) and
Katie's fiance Bill (a middle
aged businessman who tries
to be hip by snorting cocaine
and sleeping around). In Act
11, at a diner on the Tex
as/New Mexico border, Ava
encounters Ace (a burnt-out
musician obsessed with rec
orded sounds) and his eccen
tric brother Junior. In Act
111, at last in San Francisco,
Ava has hitched up with Pe
ter (a mellowed-out bass
player) and has
metaphorically left Katie
and Bill trapped in the New
Mexico desert sand.
The many idiosyncratic
details about the characters
give this play its interest and
its humor. For example,
there's the kooky anecdote
about Mrs. Romansky giving

up her broom and her ritual
istic sidewalk sweeping in
order to run off with the Mix
master travelling salesman.
Even better is Ava's en
counter with Ace and Junior
in Act II
This act is the most en
thralling piece of theatre to
come along this year. Ace
(Cab Covay) has rigged the
diner with microphones, and
orders his brother Junior
(Richard Reineccius) to
wander from mike to mike,
slurping and whispering
about Heinz Barbeque sauce.
Ace is taping a symphony of
sounds which he plans to play
out in the desert on April 15th
— income tax day.
But Ace isn't the only one
with idiosyncracies Junior
runs the gas station, but he
refuses to deal with foreign
cars. He's also the rather ob
sessive local census enumer
ator. The whole act. in addi
tion to being incredibly fun
ny, drags the audience into
the powerful mood of gentle
craziness that Ace inspires
The play suffers, though
from a weak third act. Part
of this is due to Laura Taran
tino's acting the part of Ava.

She must alternate between
singing as a rock-performer
and acting as Ava. She is
good at both (although she
could use more of Bette
Midler's raw sexiness), but
the transitions create breaks
in the mood since they de
mand a major change in her
relationship with the au
dience.
The weakness of the third
act can also be traced to
Wray's writing, and to the
direction (by Covay and Re
inecciusK The four charac
ters (Ava. Peter, Katie, and
Bill) have very distinct per
sonalities. During the act,
they recite disjointed mono
logues on a stage blocked to
emphasize the differences
among them. This is highly
effective in isolation, but it
fragments the act.
If you're fascinated by
that electric contact be
tween performer and au
dience. rush over to the
Julian Theatre. It can offer
you an experience that
neither Broadway nor Holly
wood could ever hope to
match.
