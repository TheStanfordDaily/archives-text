# America discovers Cliff Richard
## 
### David Schmelzer 
Cliff Richard, who played last
Friday at the Warfield. seems
like any one of a number of ris
ing young stars. He followed up
last year's successful "We
Don't Talk Anymore" with this
year's "Dreaming'' and "A Lit
tle in Love." He gets to sing
duets with Olivia Newton John
("Suddenly"). A few people
even remember that he did
"Devil Woman" back in 1976.
But Richard's been "rising
since a bit before then. He's
made more albums than Elton
John. He's been recording long
er than either The Rolling
Stones or The Beatles. And now,
at age forty-one (and aging
more slowly than Dick Clark),
he's finally a success in the U.S.
It took America a long time to
catch on. Richard has been one
of Britain's biggest attractions
since his first single, "Move It,"
in 1958. He's starred in a BBC
TV series, and in several mov
ies, four of which his publicity
says, were "the most popular
screen musicals ever produced
in Britain." So where has this
guy been?
England, mainly. Unlike the
other British musicians that
have made it big in America,
Richard has never moved here
to hook up with a U.S. record
company. Even after "Devil
Woman," he had no albums
widely released in this country
until We Don't Talk Anymore —
five records later. Apparently
his record company figured he
hadn't caught the fancy of the
American public.
He was in San Francisco Fri
day as a part of what he hinted
was his first U.S. tour. To put it
as impartially as possible, mu
sic fans can be happy that he's
here now. Richard puts more
energy into a concert than any
one this side of Bruce Spring
steen, and he can dance. He uses
twirls, kicks, theatrical poses,
and pantomime in each song.
And he draws heavily from his
acting background; the man
doesn't just sing numbers, he

lives them. During his upbeat
songs, he'll duckstep across the
stage looking like he's having a
great time. But during his weird
ones, of which he has many,
he'll turn suddenly and face the
audience with a look of such fear
that you fight the urge to turn
around and see what the heck's
behind you.
He played both parts in acting
out "Carrie," a song of a search
for a mysteriously missing girl.
At one moment he was on one
side of the microphone, with a
jacket slung over one shoulder,
playing the worried young man
looking for a friend. At the next,
he was on the other side, with
the jacket on, saying sternly
that "Carrie doesn't live here
anymore." All of this happened
in the midst of swirling fog, as
did "Sci Fi," which he did en
tirely in weightless slow mo
tion. Richard follows the Navy
philosophy of music — It's not
just a song. "It's an " And
he manages to do it without
being camp.
He covered the span of his ca
reer by singing both oldies like
"Move It"and Elvis's "Heart
break Hotel," and his newer,
American hits. Much of the ma
terial in between is unknown to
U.S. audiences, since the
albums from which the songs
came were never released here.
A stand-out among these num
bers was the ballad "When Two
Worlds Drift Apart," which,
performed with only sparse ac
companiment, provided a nice
contrast to his more theatrical
numbers.
He also did about a half-dozen
songs from the "other side" of
his life — that of a converted
Christian who annually makes a
gospel tour of England and other
countries. He ripped through
rockers like Larry Norman's
"Why Should the Devil Have All
the Good Music?" (Norman was
in the audience) and a number
called "The Rock That Doesn't
Roll," as well as a couple of
spiritual ballads. He also did
"Everyman," one of what he

called his "crossover" songs
that have a gospel background
but fit well on his rock albums.
Much of Richard's appeal
stems from the fact that he
gives so much of himself on
stage. He's obviously doing his
utmost to entertain, and he does
so professionally and good-na
turedly, and his spirit is infec
tuous.
My only worry about Cliff
Richard is that his newfound
success in American will force
him into the mold of pleasant,
uninspired pop singers. With
I'm No Hero, his new album,
he's changed his tone. Before
this, his producer and primary
writer was Terry Britten — a
man who liked to make quirky,
off-beat songs like "Carrie,"
"Scie Fi," "Devil Woman," and
a song about "Spiderman."
Stuff like this has character.
But the songs that he didn't

write ruined him. Either Rich
ard or his record label replaced
Britten on the new album with
Alan Tarney, who wrote "We
Don't Talk Anymore." Maybe
Britten just decided to leave on
his own. But whatever the rea
son, Tarney's music doesn't
have the Britten flair. His sound
is pleasant as a supplement to
an album, but homogenous as a
staple. He is capable of creating
some intense, original songs —
as Richard showed Friday by
singing his "A Heart Will Break
Tonight" — but Richard has to
use songs like this as more than
just throw-ins on an otherwise
mainstream album.
Even so, Cliff Richard's per
formance was a nice "hello" to
America. One hopes that he'll
give us what he's been giving
the rest of the world for years,
and not what a record company
thinks we want instead.
