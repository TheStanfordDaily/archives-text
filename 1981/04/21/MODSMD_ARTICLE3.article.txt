# African literature, dance celebrated

### Tyson Powell 
African dancing, music and literature were cele
brated Friday night as about 310 people attended
African "Cultural Night" at Cubberley Auditorium.
The event, co-sponsored by the Stanford African Stu
dents Association (SASA) and The Committee on Black
Performing Arts, was part of Africa Week 1981.
The audience, which included the Hon. A. Ajakaiye,
Nigerian General Consul, heard Stanford students
Awetu Simesso and Laura Mays read selections of
African poetry, and viewed the performances of the
African Music and Dance Ensemble and Fua dia Congo,
two African dance companies that have performed
throughout the Bay Area.
The highlight of the evening, however, occurred
when Professor St. Clair Drake was made Patron of
SASA by the groups's chairman, Kwaku Osafo.
Drake, emeritus professor of anthropology here, re
ceived a standing ovation and declared that "culture
should be used for liberation."
The long list of Drake's accomplishments read to the
audience by Osafo included early involvement in the
Pan-African movement with African nationalists
George Padmore, Jomo Kenyatta and Kwame

Nkrumah.
Drake was also instrumental in founding the Com
mittee on Black Performing Arts here.
The two dance troupes performed dances from vari
ous regions of Africa. The African Dance Ensemble, a
Berkeley-based group consisting of members from
Berkeley and Oakland, performed dances from Ghana
and Nigeria.
Fua dia Congo, which means "Congolese Heritage,"
performed songs, dances, chants and drum suites
adapted from ethnic groups of Congo-Brazzaville and
other Central African regions. The group was formed in
East Palo Alto in 1977.
The poetry read by Simesso and Mays included ex
cerpts from the works of Aime Cesaire, Kofi Awoonor
and South African Dennis Brutus.
Proceeds from the Cultural Night and other ac
tivities throughout Africa Week will support the relief
effort in East Africa. The Stanford East African Relief
Organization, founded recently to counter the effects of
drought, famine and war in East Africa, has provided
information and asked for donations throughout the
week
