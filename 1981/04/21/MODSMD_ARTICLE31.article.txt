# Racketmen take two
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
There were two things that
looked like they used to in the
Stanford men's tennis team's
easy wins over Arizona State
(9-0) and Arizona (5-1) last
weekend.
Unlike the past two weeks,
when the weather was the kind
that made California famous,
the blustery chill brought back
unwanted memories of winter
quarter. More importantly for
the Cards, Jeff Arons returned
to form with singles wins both
days.
The junior had been mired in
a four-match losing streak. With
coach Dick Gould hinting that
his starting job was possibly on
the line, Arons rallied to a three
set victory Friday over Arizona
State's Andy Krantz, 6-0, 2-6,
6-1. He made it two-for-two Sat
urday evening, beating Tim
Marcin of Arizona 7-6, 6-3 in
doors when showers forced the
match to move to the Sundown
Tennis Club in San Mateo.
"I had to show myself I could
still win," Arons said after beat
ing Krantz. "I was ahead 6-0,3-1
in the first game of the second
set and I lose. I've got to get
used to winning. I've been fall
ing apart where I used to just
forget things."

Playing at No. 4 because Scott
Bondurant (shoulder) and Mike
Falberg (groin pull) were out
with injuries, Arons had his
chance to fall apart. He rallied
with a third-set victory. "I had
to win. There are a lot of good
guys behind me on this team
that want to play. But I'm not
worried about that. I want to be
gin playing better to try and im
prove myself."
Stanford improved its record
to 13-0 with the two wins, 7-0 in
conference play. Reserves John
Corse and Mark McKeen aided
the cause with three wins in four
matches. However, Bondurant
and Falberg are expected back
for the Pac-10 individual cham
pionships this weekend in Ojai.
