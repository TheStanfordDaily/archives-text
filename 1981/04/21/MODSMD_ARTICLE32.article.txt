# Bruins batter Card nine, take two of three
## 
### Ralph Walker 
The Stanford-UCLA baseball
series this weekend, won by the
Bruins (5-6, 15-8, 10-7), was
characterized by both the typi
cal and the atypical.
Typically, Stanford suffered
yet another injury (catcher Bill
Worden's torn fingernail),
pitched rather poorly (27 earned
runs, 22 bases on balls) and was
inconsistent on defense.
Atypically, the Cardinals hit

only one home run, Mike Dot
terer did not steal a base and
Worden, who normally lays
waste to UCLA pitching, col
lected only one hit. On the other
hand, UCLA scored 30 runs, and
Bruin third baseman Lindsay
Meggs clobbered three home
runs after hitting only one in 41
previous games.
Not that any of the above
were flukes. Before the series
started, Stanford coach Mark

Marquess expressed respect for
the cellar-dwelling Bruins.
"They can beat you." he said.
"They have two of the better
pitchers in the league, and some
good young speed." Ironically,
UCLA exhibited neither. They
won with 39 hits instead,
Wilson gets game-winning
"hit"
The first game, tied in the bot
tom of the 10th with two outs and
the bases loaded, was won by

Stanford when third baseman
Phil Wilson "took one for the
team," being hit by an Andy
Center fastball to force in the
winning run. The "hit" Wilson
received was the culmination of
a Stanford comeback after the
Bruins had taken a 4-3 lead in
the eighth inning.
UCLA tied the score in the top
of the ninth on a two-base error
by leftfielder Dotterer. A Stan
ford victory seemed imminent
after Toothman led off the bot
tom of the 10th with a double,
but after an intentional base on
balls to John Elway, Loring
Davies hit into a tailor-made
6-4-3 double play. Center pro
ceeded to walk Dave Meier and
Jim McFarlane before nailing
Wilson in the back.
Bruins beat Cards at own game
The Cardinals have adopted
single inning eruptions as their
trademark this season, but they
were given a dose of their own
medicine in the second game.
The Bruins came out of hiber
nation, sending 14 men to the
plate in a ten-run third inning.

Centerfielder Vince Beringhole,
rightfielder Dave Montanari
and first baseman Greg Nor
man each drove in two runs on
two hits in the inning. Eight of
the Bruins' ten hits were sin
gles. Norman collected both of
the extra-base hits en route to a
four-hit, four-RBI day.
"He goes in spurts," said
Adams of his junior infielder,
"and when he's hot he's really
hot. He had two home runs and
eight RBI against Arizona."
Take a raincheck on this one
It might have been best to
save Saturday's finale, won by
UCLA, for another time. There
were a few amusing moments
that made the four-hour mara
thon almost bearable for the 76
fans who remained after two 20-
minute rain delays and six
pitching changes.
UCLA's 10-run effort was led
by Meggs, who cranked con
secutive round-trippers over the
left field fence, and Colin Word,
who threw five strong innings en
route to his second victory of the
year.

but after an intentional base on
balls to John Elway, Loring
Davies hit into a tailor-made
6-4-3 double play. Center pro

Bruins beat Cards at own game
The Cardinals have adopted
single inning eruptions as their
trademark this season, but they
were given a dose of their own
medicine in the second game.
The Bruins came out of hiber
nation, sending 14 men to the
plate in a ten-run third inning.

Centerfielder Vince Beringhole,
rightfielder Dave Montanari
and first baseman Greg Nor
man each drove in two runs on
two hits in the inning. Eight of
the Bruins' ten hits were sin
gles. Norman collected both of
the extra-base hits en route to a
four-hit, four-RBI day.
"He goes in spurts," said
Adams of his junior infielder,
"and when he's hot he's really
hot. He had two home runs and
eight RBI against Arizona."
Take a raincheck on this one
It might have been best to
save Saturday's finale, won by
UCLA, for another time. There
were a few amusing moments
that made the four-hour mara
thon almost bearable for the 76
fans who remained after two 20-
minute rain delays and six
pitching changes.
UCLA's 10-run effort was led
by Meggs, who cranked con
secutive round-trippers over the
left field fence, and Colin Word,
who threw five strong innings en
route to his second victory of the
year.

two games to one.
