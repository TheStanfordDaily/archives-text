# Scare top-ranked Trojans, threaten win streak
## Women netters beaten twice in Los Angeles 
### Steve Odell 
Los Angeles â€” Potential is a
double-edged sword. On the one
hand, it can generate optimism
and encouragement, and on the
other, it can mean the frustra
tion of knowing that one is not
performing up to one's
capabilities.
The Stanford women's tennis
team, absolutely overflowing
with the stuff, felt both edges
this weekend in Los Angeles.
The Cardinals, now 10-3 on the
season, dropped a disappointing
6-2 decision to no. 3-ranked
UCLA on Friday, but rebounded
the next day by coming within
an eyelash of beating the two
time AIAW defending champion
Trojans and ending their 55-dual
match winning streak, losing by
a score of 5-4.
The match with USC was
filled with tension and excite
ment, but because of some unex
pected rain in the San Fernando
Valley, it was questionable for
awhile whether it would even be
played.
Even more unexpected,
though, was the news that Anne
White, USC's number one sin
gles player and the 49th ranked

player in the world, had decided
to turn professional earlier in
the week. The news brought
hope to the Stanford team, who
had lost to the women 112 rom Troy
7-2 earlier this year, but it shook
up the Trojans and their coach,
Dave Borelli.
"I really feel that at this
stage of the game, her decision
was very unfair," Borelli
stated, in no uncertain terms.
Alas, White's absence didn't
make quite enough of a dif
ference, as the Trojans, after
being tied 3-3 following the com
pletion of the singles, rallied to
take two out of three doubles to
keep their win skein intact.
But oh, how Stanford battled.
Alycia Moulton got the Cards
going right away, tearing right
through 87th-ranked Anna
Maria Fernandez in no time at
all, 6-2, 6-4.
The All-America from Sacra
mento used an overpowering
serve (she was broken only once
during the match) and an ag
gressive net game to clinch the
victory at number one.
Freshman Elise Burgin also
won in straight sets in a veri
table tug-of-war at number four

with USC's Nina Voydat, 6-4,
6-4. The match was a marathon,
partially because of Voydat's
methodical baseline style, and
partially because almost every
game had more deuces than
you'd find up a card shark's
sleeve.
Burgin, who tried to mix up
her game against the very pre
dictable Voydat, found herself
frustrated whenever she came
to the net by the Trojan's superb
lobs. Nevertheless, Burgin
finally came back from a 1-3 dis
advantage in the first set and
broke through after four deuces
in the tenth game to take it. She
followed that up with another
6-4 set to take the match.
The doubles, however, was
where the victor was de
termined. And at first, it looked
as though the Cards would win
the battle at hand, as two of
their three doubles teams got
off to good starts, putting the
phenomenal Trojan streak in
jeopardy.
At number two, Susy Jaeger
and Burgin were looking sharp
in building up a 4-3 advantage
over A.M. Fernandez and Voy
dat, with Jaeger serving well

and Burgin putting away the
subsequent volleys.
And at number one, the pre
viously undefeated duo of
Moulton and Caryn Copeland
teamed up to romp on Henry and
Siegel in the first set, rolling to a
5-0 lead before winning it, 6-1.
Further optimism was created
by the fact that they had already
won over the same team in
straight sets at the NIKE tour
nament.
But then the heavens opened
up to delay this match between
the nation's two best teams once
again And it effectively curbed
the Cards' momentum.
After the showers had sub
sided and the courts had dried,
Burgin and Jaeger lost a long
eighth game, but were able to
come back and hold service
twice before breaking Voydat in
the twelfth for a win in the first
set.
The second followed exactly
the same script, with Stanford
barreling out to a 5-2 lead, being
caught at five and then breaking
Voydat two games later for an
other 7-5 win.
Moulton and Copeland, how
ever, never fully recovered
their fine play of the first set
and were only able to win three
games after the rainfall, losing
the fifth and deciding match,
1-6, 6-2,6-1.
Against the Bruins, Stanford
was as frustrated as the sun
which attempted to make its
way through the heavy smog
and clouds hanging over West

wood on Friday. Both the Cards
and the sun, however, were un
successful in their respective
quests.
Stanford, which had beaten
the Bruins earlier this year, 5-4
at the NIKE tournament, fared
miserably this time and failed
to take even one singles match
on the afternoon.
Led by last year's number
one, Kathy O'Brien, and this
year's number one, Kathrin
Keil, the Bruins, now 18-2, had
no trouble whatsoever in
polishing off Stanford
O'Brien took care of Jaeger
quickly, 6-2, 6-0, at number two
singles. And Keil, last year's
Southwestern girls' 18 cham
pion, used a combination of pin
point backhand returns and
passing shots to flatten
Moulton. 6-2, 7-6.
