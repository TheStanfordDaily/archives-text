## Seko wins in Boston 
### 
Boston (AP) â€” Japan's Toshihiko Seko took command on the
backslopes of punishing Heartbreak Hill, then kicked away from
mid-distance ace Craig Virgin and four-time winner Bill Rodgers to
win the 85th Boston Marathon yesterday.
The 24-year-old Seko, undefeated at the marathon distance since
1979, finished in an unofficial time of 2 hours, 9 minutes and 20 sec
onds, which if verified would be the best time ever recorded in the
United States. Rodgers holds the U.S. mark of 2:09.27.
Virgin, from Lebanon, 111., was second in 2:10.26. The 33-year-old
Rodgers, of Stoneham, Mass., lagged in third at 2:10.34, frustrated
in his bid for an unprecedented fourth consecutive Boston crown.
In cool weather that Rodgers usually turns to his advantage, Seko
pounded ahead after he and Virgin dueled neck-and-neck on'the
cruel hill about six miles from the finish
