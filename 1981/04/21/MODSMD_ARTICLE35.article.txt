Another Atlanta victim found
Atlanta — A black teen-ager who was slain, stripped and
dumped into a suburban river probably died of asphyxia
tion — like 12 of the 23 other young blacks killed here since
July 1979, a medical examiner ruled yesterday
The decomposed body of 15-year-old Joseph Bell was
found Sunday floating face-down in an isolated bend of the
South River in DeKalb County. He had been missing since
March 2, when he stopped to look for work at a restaurant
where he occasionally did odd jobs
The manager of the restaurant, Richard Harp, told po
lice he received a telephone call on March 3 from someone
claiming to be Bell who said, "I'm almost dead " Police
spokeswoman Beverly Harvard said police were in
vestigating the incident.
DeKalb County Medical Examiner Joseph Burton an
nounced after an autopsy yesterday that Bell did not ap
pear to have been strangled, but that smothering was a
"possible" cause of death. Burton said Bell could have
been in the river since the day he disappeared
Ronny Tillman, who discovered Bell's body while riding
a motorbike along the river, said the body was clad in "just
shorts." Five of the victims found this year were clothed
only in shorts or undershorts.
Several authorities, including State Crime Lab Director
Larry Howard, have speculated that the recent victims
may have been stripped and dumped in rivers to prevent
investigators from finding clues such as fibers, reported
on some of the bodies.
Burton said there was no evidence of external injuries
other than marks resulting from contact with debris in the
river. Nor were there any apparent signs of sexual abuse
or mutilation, although the body was too decomposed for a
complete examination, he said.
Supreme Court rules on disabled
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday narrowed
the legal rights of an estimated 135,000 mentally retarded
and other disabled persons confined in
large public institutions around the United States.
In a case involving the Pennhurst State School and Hos
pital in Spring City, Pa., the justices ruled 6-3 that a law
passed by Congress in 1975 should not be interpreted as re
quiring that states must provide treatment for a retarded
person in "the setting that is least restrictive of the per
son's personal liberty."
The effect of the decision is to reduce the pressure upon
states and local governments to close down large institu
tions for the retarded and to place the persons confined
there in smaller residential facilities in community set
tings.
The Disabled Act provided federal
funds to state governments to help them provide better
services for retarded, autistic and other
disabled persons. States do not have to take part in this fed
eral program if they do not wish.
In carrying out the 1975 law, the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services has required states receiving
federal funds to make several changes in public institu
tions for the retarded.
Economy has healthy first quarter
ashington — The nation's economy spurted ahead at a
surprisingly strong annual rate of 6.5 percent in the first
quarter of this year, as consumers continued to spend at
high levels, the Department of Commerce reported yes

terdav.
It was the largest quarterly increase in the Gross Na
tional Product, the market value of all goods and services
produced in the country, since a 9 percent advance in the
spring of 1978.
While Reagan administration officials hailed the "nice
start" for the economy in 1981, they warned that it would
not be repeated in the quarter now in progress, when
growth is expected to flatten out.
"The first quarter pace almost surely will not be sus
tained and signs already have accumulated that the econo
my is shifting to a sluggish performance in the near
term," Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige said at
a news conference.
"We should not let results for the first quarter over
shadow the fact that inflation and unemployment show lit
tle sign of. . . improvement," said Murray Weidenbaum,
chairman of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Eco
nomic Advisers
The 6.5 percent annual rate of growth in the first quarter
contrasted with a 3.8 percent advance in the last three
months of 1980 The surge this year occurred despite wide
spread forecasts by government and private economists of
a decline in first quarter growth.
Ethics law questioned
Washington — Attorney General William French Smith
said yesterday he had "serious reservations" about the
constitutionality of a 1978 law that calls for special prose
cutors to investigate government officials suspected of
wrongdoing.
"In some or all of its applications, the Special Prose
cutor Act appears fundamentally to contradict the princi
ple of separation of powers erected by the Constitution,"
Smith wrote in a letter to Michael Davidson, chief Senate
legal counsel. "The Special Prosecutor Act removes the
responsibility for the enforcement of federal criminal
laws and lodges it in an officer who is not appointed by, or
accountable to. or save in extraordinary circumstances,
removable by the attorney general or the president."
Smith said the Justice Dept. will continue to comply
with the law until it is changed or declared unconstitu
tional by a federal court but left little doubt of his opinion
of the law known formally as the Ethics in Government
Act of 1978.
Passed in the wake of Watergate, the act covers about
200 top federal officials. A special prosecutor, who is
named by a panel of federal judges, operates independen
tly of the Justice Dept. Many allegations have been made
against federal officials since passage of the act, but spe
cial prosecutors have been named only twice to pursue the
allegations.
In November 1979, a special prosecutor was named to in
vestigate charges that Hamilton Jordan had publicly used
cocaine while he was White House chief of staff. Last year,
another was named to investigate charges that Timothy
Kraft used cocaine while he was President Jimmy
Carter's appointments secretary.
Both times, the special prosecutor said there was not
enough evidence to bring charges, prompting Kraft to drop
a suit challenging constitutionality of the act. When Kraft
dropped his suit. Smith wrote Davidson to give him Justice
Dept. views.
Brady recovering from drug reactioil
Washington — An apparent drug reaction gave White
House press secretary James Brady a 104-degree fever

and widespread rash over the weekend, but he was nearly
recovered yesterday, doctors said.
At first doctors thought Brady might be suffering an in
fection, which would have meant a grave threat to his life,
when he started running a fever and getting a rash around
1 a.m. Saturday. By that night the fever reached 104
degrees, a serious worry in itself had it continued.
But by then the doctors had decided Brady probably was
having a drug reaction and had taken him off two drugs —
one to prevent seizures, a possible aftermath of brain in
jury, and the other to control Brady's occasional high
blood pressure. His doctors also gave him an antibiotic in
case the problem was an infection.
Cultures and a spinal fluid study showed no evidence of
infection, and Saturday night the fever broke. It continued
going down Sunday.

Stocks up in active trading
New York — Trading was active as the stock market
rolled up its third straight gain yesterday in an advance
that carried the Dow Jones industrial average to a new
eight-year high.

Easter-Passover weekend, the Fed reported a $4.8 billion
jump in the money supply.
That big increase prompted some early selling this
morning.
