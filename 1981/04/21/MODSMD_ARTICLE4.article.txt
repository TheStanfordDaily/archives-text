# Miller calls inflation 'principle obstacle'

Outlining the basic goals of an eco
nomic system as balanced growth,
high employment and price stability,
former Treasury Secretary G. Wil
liam Miller pointed to inflation as the
"principle obstacle" to attaining
those goals in a speech delivered in
Kresge auditorium last night.
Miller, who served in the Carter ad
ministration, attributed the "vir
ulent" inflation rate to societal de
cisions perpetuating an attitude typi
fied by "American desires and objec
tives that outpace our willingness to
pay for them."
In addition, he cited the national ac
ceptance of large federal deficits as
"due course," a historical realign
ment between supply and demand for
energy in the world and the influence
of "natural forces' as factors which
detrimentally affect the economy.
He emphasized the significance of
our energy consumption and depen
dence on foreign oil imports as central
to the spiraling inflation rate.
"For the first 100 years, our nation
relied on renewable energy sources:
wood, water and wind," Miller said.
"The second 100 years we used fossil
fuels that are depletable: coal, oil and
natural gas."
"We've used energy instead of capi
tal and labor to establish the highest
standard of living in the world,"
Miller said, identifying this pattern as

an explanation for our current eco
nomic condition.
Miller criticized former adminis
tration energy policies, specifically
the domestic policy decisions follow
ing the 1973 Arab oil embargo.
"The first reaction was the wrong
thing: price control." According to
Miller, price control encourages con
sumption and discourages production,
tendencies which lead to increased de
pendence on foreign supply.
The passage in 1978 of the natural
gas act which changed the allocation
of that energy source and the subse
quent decontrol of domestic crude oil
in the spring of 1980 were two steps
which helped alleviate or mitigate the
previous consumptive patterns

"There has been a remarkable de
crease in consumption," Miller said.
"Last year we imported 25 percent
less oil by volume than we did in 1977."
According to Miller, several "struc
tural problems " within the economy
have contributed to our current in
stability. These include barriers to
competition, excessive regulatory
policies and declining productivity, he
said.
"In the first 20 years following
World War 11. our productivity was
growing at 3 percent. In the next ten
years we experienced growth at less
than 2 percent and the last five years it
has been tej;s than 1 percent," he said
Aside Trom these instVtutlonai or
government phenomenon contributing

to high inflation and a weak economy.
Miller cited a "divisiveness" that
grew out of the cynicism following the
Vietnam war and Watergate
He commented on the Reagan ad
ministration's economic strategy that
calls for cuts in both federal expen
ditures and iederal regulations, feder
al tax cuts and a cut in the growth of
monetary aggregates.
"We must question the degree to
which the proposed cuts fall on those
who are least able to afford them. We
should be able to ensure appropriate
controls on federal expenditures
withought reducing our commitment
to a just society," he said.
