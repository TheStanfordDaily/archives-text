# British historian cites case of his brother's death
## Governments said to twist history

Governments twist historical facts
to fit propaganda needs, according to
Edward Thompson, British historian
and political activist.
In a three-part speech entitled
"Journey Across the Frontier, Track
ing the Cold War to a Source: The
Balkans. 1944," Thompson last week
traced the account of his brother, Ma
jor Frank Thompson, who was ex
ecuted by Bulgarian fascists in 1944.
Thompson's personal curiosity
about his only sibling's death grew
into professional interest as he re
searched the event. Beneath the nar
rative, Thompson said he recognized
the pressure of larger issues.
The details of one person's life can
"illuminate" the history of nations, he
said, especially when sensitive ideol
ogical issues are involved.
Through conversations with British
and Bulgarian officials, Thompson
learned that the stories commonly be
lieved in those countries not only con
tradicted each other, but also his
brother's letters and papers.
Governments replace historical
facts with myths that comply with ide
ology. "Sometimes evidential materi
al is suppressed or destroyed so that
the truth of a past event becomes ir
retrievable," he said.
Major Thompson, who parachuted
into Bulgaria to aid the resistance

movement partisans, has since be
come a national hero in Bulgaria while
passing into obscurity and disrepute in
England. Thompson said, however,
"The truth lies somewhere between
those two lies."
According to Thompson, his brother
was among a handful of Allies sent to
aid the Bulgarian partisans in 1944
who were trying to overthrow the Bul
garian government supporting the
fascist Axis powers.
The partisans had everything going
against them, being out-numbered and
lacking weapons and supplies. Half
the civilian population was hostile to
them; the enemy s brutality was
notorious.
In May 1944, Frank Thompson's unit
was encircled by Bulgarian soldiers
while marching into central Bulgaria
to establish contact with other parti-

San groups. Thompson focused on this
partisan march, which ended in
Frank's capture and the death of most
of his companions.
"This particular moment in history
is important because it took place in
the eye of the gathering hurricane
which later became known as the Cold
War," he said. "It tells us a little
about how that hurricane was
formed."
Examining the Bulgarian account,
Thompson said he discovered four
phases of myth that spanned the 37
years since his brother's death. The
status of the Bulgarian partisans and
Frank rose and fell with ideologies
and individuals in the Bulgarian Com
munist Party, which came to power
after the war

amended. By the partisan march of
May 1944. the British had disowned
Frank's mission to Bulgaria.
"Each state has a right and a left
hand," Thompson said, referring to
the way the British played both sides
of the conflict while awaiting develop
ments.
The British abandoned the parti

sans because of their Communist af
filiations and because tension between
the Western Allies and the Soviets was
increasing.
Frank, who had been associated
with the Communists, had also fallen
out of the British government's favor.
Since his brother's mission had be
come an embarrassment to the Allies,
Thompson suggested that they didn't
intervene to stop the Bulgarians from
executing him.
British history, meanwhile, vir
tually ignores the Bulgarian parti

sans. The official story about Frank is
that he forced some men to accom
pany him to Bulgaria because he was a
fanatical Communist, according to
the historian.
Although Frank had been a member
of the Communist Party as a student,
Thompson said he was a non-doc
trinal, unorthodox Communist and
that he may not have even considered
himself one by 1944.
More importantly, Frank's politics
represented the anti-fascist spirit of
the time. "From 1942 to 1944, there
was an international anti-fascist cul
ture which had been falsified and for
gotten," Thompson said.

May 1944. the British had disowned
Frank's mission to Bulgaria.
"Each state has a right and a left
hand," Thompson said, referring to
the way the British played both sides
of the conflict while awaiting develop
ments.
The British abandoned the parti

sans because of their Communist af
filiations and because tension between
the Western Allies and the Soviets was
increasing.
Frank, who had been associated
with the Communists, had also fallen
out of the British government's favor.
Since his brother's mission had be
come an embarrassment to the Allies,
Thompson suggested that they didn't
intervene to stop the Bulgarians from
executing him.
British history, meanwhile, vir
tually ignores the Bulgarian parti

sans. The official story about Frank is
that he forced some men to accom
pany him to Bulgaria because he was a
fanatical Communist, according to
the historian.
Although Frank had been a member
of the Communist Party as a student,
Thompson said he was a non-doc
trinal, unorthodox Communist and
that he may not have even considered
himself one by 1944.
More importantly, Frank's politics
represented the anti-fascist spirit of
the time. "From 1942 to 1944, there
was an international anti-fascist cul
ture which had been falsified and for
gotten," Thompson said.
"What is known as the Cold War is
the central human fracture," Thomp

Governments twist historical facts
to fit propaganda needs, according to
Edward Thompson, British historian
and political activist.
In a three-part speech entitled
"Journey Across the Frontier, Track
ing the Cold War to a Source: The
Balkans. 1944," Thompson last week
traced the account of his brother, Ma
jor Frank Thompson, who was ex
ecuted by Bulgarian fascists in 1944.
Thompson's personal curiosity
about his only sibling's death grew
into professional interest as he re
searched the event. Beneath the nar
rative, Thompson said he recognized
the pressure of larger issues.
The details of one person's life can
"illuminate" the history of nations, he
said, especially when sensitive ideol
ogical issues are involved.
Through conversations with British
and Bulgarian officials, Thompson
learned that the stories commonly be
lieved in those countries not only con
tradicted each other, but also his
brother's letters and papers.
Governments replace historical
facts with myths that comply with ide
ology. "Sometimes evidential materi
al is suppressed or destroyed so that
the truth of a past event becomes ir
retrievable," he said.
Major Thompson, who parachuted
into Bulgaria to aid the resistance

movement partisans, has since be
come a national hero in Bulgaria while
passing into obscurity and disrepute in
England. Thompson said, however,
"The truth lies somewhere between
those two lies."
According to Thompson, his brother
was among a handful of Allies sent to
aid the Bulgarian partisans in 1944
who were trying to overthrow the Bul
garian government supporting the
fascist Axis powers.
The partisans had everything going
against them, being out-numbered and
lacking weapons and supplies. Half
the civilian population was hostile to
them; the enemy s brutality was
notorious.
