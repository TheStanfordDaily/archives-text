## Syrian-U.S. relations reach new low after secretary's Middle East visit 
### Los Angeles Times 
Damascus, Syria — Relations
between the United States and
Syria, already chilly because of
Damascus' opposition to the Is
raeli-Egyptian peace treaty,
have hit a new low after a series
of U.S. statements criticizing
Syrian actions in Lebanon, Syr
ian officials and Western
diplomats here say.
Twice in the past two weeks,
Secretary of State Alexander
Haig has strongly questioned
Syria's role in Lebanon, only to
have the State Dept. later soften
the harsh wording of his
statements. Despite the clari
fications, the Syrians have re
acted angrily to what they see as
a significant shift against them
in U.S. policy.
Attack
"The Reagan administration
has done nothing but attack us
since it came into office," said
Zuhair Jannan, a spokesman for
the Damascus government.
"Haig's visit to this area was
not to negotiate peace between
Israel and the Arab world," Syr
ian President Hafez Assad said
in a speech Saturday. "He came
to ask us (the Arabs) to prepare
our army to fight the Soviet
Union. The United States is
looking for Arab stooges, not
Arab friends."
Haig initially angered the
Syrians by not including Damas
cus on his Middle East tour
which ended last week. "They
felt that they were being ig
nored as a player in the Arab-Is
raeli conflict," a European am
bassador explained.
Reassure
U.S. diplomats tried to re
assure the Syrians, the only.
Arab state still maintaining a
genuine state of war against Is
rael, that the administration
was not counting them out of
any peace negotiations.
But after talks with Israeli of
ficials, Haig denounced Syria's
bombardment of the Lebanese
city of Zahlah, held by
militiamen of the Christian
Falangist Party, as "brutal"
and "unacceptable." The State
Dept. later said that Haig had
not intended to be one-sided in
his criticism of the fighting be

tween the Syrians and
Falangists.
French proposal
Then, during his stopover in
Paris. Haig endorsed a French
proposal for a new United Na
tions force to replace the all-
Syrian Arab deterrent force in
parts of Lebanon.
The French themselves
quickly dropped the suggestion,
and the State Dept. issued an
other clarification. "The United
States does not advocate a U.N.
peacekeeping force in Leba
non," a U.S. Embassy spokes
man here said. "It is only one of
the ideas which should be con
sidered."

stooges, not Arab friends.'

The Lebanese government re
jected the proposal Wednesday,
with both Christian and Moslem
Cabinet ministers unanimously
agreeing that negotiations be
tween the Falangists and the
Syrians were the proper course.
Complaint
The Syrians also complain
that the United States no longer
criticizes Israel for its pre-emp
tive attacks against Palestinian
bases in southern Lebanon. The
Damascus government fears
this reflects a change in policy
and may encourage the Israelis
to launch another invasion of the
area.
But several diplomats said
they believe Assad is unlikely to
retaliate harshly against the
United States, by freezing or se
vering diplomatic relations.
"Syria is too isolated these days
to slam many doors," one ana
lyst said.
And the White House also ap
pears to be trying to keep the
door open President Ronald
Reagan, noting Syria's upcom
ing national day, said in a
message disclosed here
Wednesday by Western
diplomats that Syria had a cen
tral role in the search for "a just

Middle East peace."
Syria and the United States
have had a rocky relationship
ever since President Jimmy
Carter mediated the Israeli-
Egyptian peace talks at Camp
David in 1978. The Syrians ob
jected to the Camp David agree
ment because both Syria and the
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion were left out of the process,
and because they believed that
Egypt settled for too little from
Israel.
The chill has deepened as As
sad's socialist regime has
turned increasingly to the Sovi
et Union for political support
and arms supplies. Last Novem

ber, the Syrians signed a long
term friendship treaty with the
Russians after 15 years of re
sisting Soviet suggestions for
such a pact.
In Lebanon, the Syrians be
lieve they are being treated un
fairly by the United States,
diplomats said.
Intervention
When the Syrian army in
tervened in the Lebanese civil
war in 1976, it had the approval
of President Gerald Ford.
Assad wanted Lebanon within
his sphere of influence in the
area, where he could both dem
onstrate the power of his army
and maintain some kind of con
trol over the Palestinian quer
rillas.
But the Falangists, the larg
est armed faction among Leba
non's Christians, withdrew the
support they had originally giv
en the Syrians, and announced
their intention of taking over all
of Lebanon by force.
That touched off several
rounds of Syrian-Falangist
lighting, the latest of which
began two weeks ago in Zahlah,
only 10 miles from Syria's
western border, where the
Falangists were attempting to

set up new military positions
'"The Syrians see the
Falangists' presence as
equivalent to an Israeli pres
ence," one diplomat pointed
out. "They perceived it as a real
strategic threat."
Israel concerned
And Israel continues to be
concerned about the threat
posed by Syria. In Tel Aviv last
week Prime Minister Men
achem Begin said the Soviet
Union has stationed 1000 tanks
in Syria. He called Syria a Sovi
et forward base in a televised in
terview.
Asked about the perception of
Syria as a Soviet client state,
spokesman Jannan said: "We
are not a Soviet puppet. There
are no Soviet military bases
here. We accept arms from the
Soviet Union as a friendly coun
try. Is anyone else offering us
weapons? Is the United States
offering us weapons?"
