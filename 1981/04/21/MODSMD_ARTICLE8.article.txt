# Mugabe pledges 'peaceful coexistence' with South Africa in anniversary speech

### Washington Post 
Salisbury, Zimbabwe — Prime Min
ister Robert Mugabe Saturday marked
the first anniversary of black rule for
Zimbabwe, born from Africa's bloodiest
guerrilla war, by continuing the country
along its moderate path of change and of
fering an unusual olive branch to South
Africa.
In an independence day speech,
Mugabe outlined plans to speed pro
grams for black advancement in land re
settlement, government employment,
education, health and housing. He gave
few details, however.
Mugabe appealed to the people of Zim
babwe for "unity and hard work" to
achieve progress in what was essentially
a reiteration of policies that have won
him acclaim in the West.
In an interview on government tele
vision and radio Friday night, Mugabe
pledged his country to "peaceful coex
istence" with South Africa despite

"hostile acts" by its white-minority gov
ernment.
"Although we are opposed to the poli
tics of South Africa, we do not regard the
people of South Africa as our enemies at
all," he said.
Hedge
The olive branch had a hedge —
Mugabe's customary criticism of South
Africa's racial segregation and its re
fusal to grant independence to Namibia.
But Mugabe's conciliatory remarks
were unusual for the leader of one of the
so-called front-line African nations con
fronting Pretoria over white rule.
Zimbabwe is economically dependent
on South Africa, which spent billions of
dollars to support the previous white-mi
nority rule during 15 years of independ
ence as Rhodesia. At that time most of
the world refused to recognize the
Rhodesian government.
South Africa is Zimbabwe's biggest
trading partner and most imports and

exports use South Africa's ports and rail
ways.
Cancels trade agreement
Last month South Africa gave the re
quired one-year notice that it intends to
cancel a preferential trade agreement
that is a holdover from the period of
white rule.
Mugabe said in the interview that the
government was concerned about South
Africa's "aggressive and hostile ac
tivities against us" and added, "We ex
pect that she might proceed to take even
sterner measures against us."
Mugabe said it was important to dist
inguish between political and trade rela
tions and said Zimbabwe would "con
tinue to maintain trade relations with
South Africa to the extent that South
Africa makes it possible for us to do so."
Cities were decorated with bunting for
independence day, and celebrations,
mostly low-key, were held throughout
the country featuring military bands,
traditional dancers and sporting events.
