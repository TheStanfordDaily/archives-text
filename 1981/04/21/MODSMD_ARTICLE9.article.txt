# Iraq adopts new, defensive policy on Iran
## 
### Washington Post 
Baghdad, Iraq — Embittered
and increasingly frustrated by
Iran's refusal to make peace af
ter seven months of fighting,
Iraq has widened its initial war
aims and now says it will seek
dismemberment of strife-torn
Iran.
"If Iran continues to be an en
emy, it is better to have five
Irans, five small Irans rather
than one big Iran," Tariq Aziz, a
leading member of Iraq's Revo
lutionary Command Council,
said in explaining this ominous
shift in policy.
"We have reached the point
where objectives have
changed," he said in a two-hour
interview here last week.
Aziz contended that the Iraqi
decision to seek disintegration
of politically troubled Iran —
primarily through supporting
dissident minorities in that
country — was essentially a
"defensive policy" stemming
from Iranian intransigence. He
said Iraq had hoped at the start

of the war to make peace with a
"united Iran."
Escalation danger
Aziz's comments highlighted
the imminent danger of a major
escalation and change in the
direction of a war that began in
September as ail Iraqi bid to
force Iran to recognize Iraqi
sovereignty over the vital Shatt
al-Arab, the waterway separat
ing the Persian Gulf's two
strongest military powers.
Seated in his book-lined office
overlooking the Tigris River,
Aziz explained his govern
ment's hardening attitude
toward Iran and the war and dis
cussed the state of Iraq's rela
tions with the Soviet Union and
the United States. Despite Mos
cow's refusal to provide Soviet
equipped Iraq with arms and its
official stance of neutrality in
the war. Baghdad will not
cancel its nine-year-old treaty
of friendship and cooperation
with the Soviet Union, Aziz said.
"We are not irritated with the
Soviet Union," he said, although
he indicated that the two coun
tries had narrowly avoided a
major blowup.
On the other hand, despite
some improvement in Iraqi-
American relations, he said he
was "not very optimistic" that
the Reagan administration
would carry out any "dramatic
changes" in U.S. Middle East
policy that would make possible
a renewal of diplomatic ties bro
ken off by Iraq 14 years ago.
Iraq, he said, nonetheless fa
vored more high-level contacts
between the two governments.
His remarks came five days af
ter Morris Draper, U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of state for
Middle East affairs, had talks
here with high-level Iraqi of
ficials, the first in nearly four
years.
He warned, however, that if
the Reagan administration
makes another "mistake" such
as the Camp David peace ac
cords sponsored by the previous
administration, "there will be a
dramatic and very bad develop
ment in Arab-American rela
tions."
No early end
In discussing the war with
Iran, Aziz emphasized that he
saw no early end to the fighting.
After three months of heavy

fighting, the war reached a
stalemate and has been in a lull,
partly because of heavy winter
rains but partly, too, Iraq says,
because it wanted to give time
to so far unsuccessful outside
diplomatic efforts to bring Iran
to the negotiating table.
Iraq claims to have seized
6000 to 8000 square miles of
Iran's oil heartland, Khuzestan,
but the Iraqis still have not
gained total military control
over the Shatt-al-Arab, their
lifeline to the Persian Gulf.
Now, there is talk of a new
spring offensive by Iraq and
much speculation here about
what its objectives will be.
Aziz, who is also a deputy
prime minister and a major fig
ure in the ruling Arab Socialist
Baath Party, said despite the
fact that recent U.N., Islamic
and nonaligned peace efforts
had created an atmosphere "for
the possibility of discussing
peace," Baghdad had detected
no real willingness among Iran
ian leaders to accept a nego
tiated settlement to the cen
turtes-old dispute over the
Shatt-al-Arab. ,
False hopes
He said the Iranians were liv
ing on false hopes of a military
victory and erroneous informa
tion being fed to them by the
Syrians about the political situ
ation in Iraq, leading them to
believe they could hold out long
er than the Iraqis.
Asked about a possible new
offensive to pressure Iran into
holding talks, Aziz said the Iraqi
government did not want to en
danger mediation efforts yet.
Iraq has, however, sent its
forces across the border into
Iranian Kurdestan and is assist
ing Kurds there in a struggle
against the Iranian Army. It is
also helping the Arabs in the
areas occupied by Iraqi forces
in Iran's Khuzestan Province to
press their demands for auton
omy. Whether Iraq is in a strong
enough position militarily to
provoke the dismemberment of
Iran as a nation, even through
stepped-up assistance to the
Iranian minorities, is not clear.
Aziz gave the impression that
while the Iraqi leadership did
not care if Iran falls apart, it did
not believe this was in either na
tion's best interest. At one

point, he went out of his way to
deny that Iraq was an "im
perialist" country or "part of
any international strategy,"
adding, "what interest would
we gain from the dismember
ment of Iran?"
Speaking about Iraq's present
relations with Moscow and
Washington, Aziz outlined for
the first time since the war
began Iraq's attitude toward the
Soviet Union. He said a major
crisis in Iraqi-Soviet relations
because of Moscow's refusal to
provide arms or spare parts had
been avoided mainly because
Iraq had succeeded in getting
them elsewhere.
Iraq-American relations ,
Regarding Iraqi-American
relations, Aziz noted several
areas where he said he saw an
improvement, including a
change in the previous U.S. per
ception of Iraq as a "pro-Sovi
et" nation.
"We are friends with the Sovi
et Union; we don't pretend the
contrary. But our policy is not
dictated from Moscow," he
said. "This is understood by
America. This is very good."
Also, he added, the Iraqi gov
ernment had no evidence that
the United States was involved
in any "conspiracies" against it
today, such as in the early 19705,
when the Central Intelligence
Agency provided aid to the
Kurdish rebellion in the north.
On the central issue that led
to the freeze in relations be
tween the two governments —
U.S. support for Israel and its
failure to solve the Palestinian
question — Aziz was
pessimistic.
"Everybody is saying not
before the middle of this year is
the American administration
going to specify its policy," he
said. "I will tell you. We are not
very optimistic. We don't ex
pect any dramatic changes. But
we will see."
Aziz did not indicate what
kind of change would be neces
sary to satisfy Iraq in order for
diplomatic relations to be re
stored, limiting himself to
saying simply that "any change
in the American attitude toward
the Arab-Israeli conflict bring
ing America to a more balanced
attitude toward this conflict will
help in developing relations."
