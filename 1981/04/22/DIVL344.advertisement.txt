Should Stanford
get the union label?
Tomorrow, in a special issue of The
Stanford Daily Magazine, we publish
the results of an independent,
scientific survey of the clerical and
library workers who will decide May 7
whether or not to unionize.
Also appearing will be a host of other
articles on the issue, exclusive
interviews with union organizer Joyce
Tipps-Coats and President Donald
Kennedy, and an article examining the
views of ASSU senators on the coming
year.
Watch for it tomorrow, along with our
usual Thursday entertainment section. |
