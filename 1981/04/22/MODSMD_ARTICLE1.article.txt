# Team effort succeeds in fake quake

Few students realize that such pop
ular campus residences as Lagunita
Court, Roble Hall and Toyon Hall
"collapsed" in yesterday morning's
campus earthquake drill.
In addition to the residences, about
100 students participating in the drill,
collapsed on the lawn, rooms and
hallways of Roble as well as those of
the nearby Terman Engineering Cen
ter.
Clad in old shirts, jeans or shorts —
and some of the most realistic injury
makeup ever seen outside of Holly
wood movie studios — the "victims"
lay moaning as they waited for the
rescue teams to arrive.
Why go through this ordeal?
"For a free T-shirt, breakfast,
lunch, and ten bucks!" replied one stu
dent participant.
After waiting about 10 minutes for
help to arrive, victims started shout
ing.
"Where the hell is everyone?"
"Someone help us — damn it, we're
dying in here."
Help started to arrive after about
half an hour. The victims began to feel
useful.
Strapped onto stretchers, some dat
ing to World War 11, the victims were
gently lowered into waiting Univer
sity Facilities and Services Depart
ment trucks.
In the next hour, they were taken to
auxiliary emergency rooms at local
hospitals and "treated" for their im
aginary wounds,
The hospital treatment was de
signed to simulate what could occur
after a real earthquake. But the stu
dents often occupied their time casu
ally during the drill.
Many simply lay on the Roble lawn,
bronzing themselves under the sunny

April skies. Others posed for local tel
evision camera persons and news
paper photographers.
The "injuries" were serious, allow
ing the rescue crew to go through the
motions of post-earthquake first aid.
Frequently, first aid took a long
time to arrive.
David Chenevert, for instance, suf
fered a "concussion "and lay waiting
for help.
Fake blood dripping out of his ear,
he said, "I'm glad this wasn't a real
earthquake. I've been lying here for
twenty minutes with blood dripping
out of my head and no one's even no
ticed."
At first, some of the rescue teams
made bad decisions. A girl with a
"compound fracture" was told to
walk down the steps, while a victim
with a supposed spinal injury was
haphazardly carried away.
However, once trained medical per
sonnel arrived, there were fewer mis
haps, and victims were removed in a
more orderly fashion
One student, who supposedly suf
fered injuries from a bike accident,
spotted the medical personnel and
began moaning and groaning re
alistically. "It brings out the actor in
all of us," he said.
A visitor to the Terman area
screamed when she saw an eye "in
jury," and almost fainted, until stu
dents convinced her the wound was
take.
Most of the participants enjoyed
themselves, but many don't realize
how much they have contributed to
Stanford's earthquake preparedness.
The drill will be analyzed for weeks
by committees before final con
clusions are made for improving post
quake campus safety procedures.
Therefore, when the "Big One"
does strike, Stanford hopes it will be
ready.
