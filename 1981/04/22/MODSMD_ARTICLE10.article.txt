# Nuclear waste left in the dumps
## 
### Kathryn Doi 
The government has been
grappling with the prob
lem of disposing of high
level radioactive waste since
the birth of the nuclear program
40 years ago.
However, scientists still dis
agree on a safe method for dis
posing of the waste, which is so
toxic that it has to be isolated
from the environment for up to
millions of years.
Nobody knows just how long
the nuclear material will have
to be stored.
Konrad Krauskopf, a Stan
ford geology professor, who has
been working on the problem of
nuclear waste disposal for 11
years, quipped. "If I could an
swer that question, I would get a
Nobel prize."
For such long-term storage,
the federal government is con
sidering putting the material in
salt mines, shooting it into outer
space, or burying it in theocean.
Until the final decision is
made, the waste will continue to
be stored on nuclear reactor
sites and in storage tanks lo
cated on isolated government
"reservations." *
There does not seem to be a
consensus on a safe container
for the nuclear waste.
The nuclear industry is satis
fied with the current level of
technology, according to the
Electric Power Research In
stitute, a Palo Alto utility re
search institute.
The government, however,
prefers to wait for more re
search.
The government's goal is to
keep the waste completely
isolated from the environment
for a thousand years, sealed in
glass and special metal alloy
containers.
The U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) reports indicate
that a waste repository might be
functioning as early as 1997.
Krauskopf called this date a
"fair guess."
The nuclear waste storage

and disposal issue also ques
tions the effectiveness with
which present institutions can
deal with such highly complex
and technical issues.
According to Neville Cook, a
professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, state
government infrastructures
aren't capable of handling the
waste generated by the 150 nu
clear plants nationwide current
ly in operation or under con
struction
Should there be two re
positories to dispose of the
waste, there would be a truck
with waste arriving every 50
minutes all day long, noted Jim
Harding, energy projects direc
tor of Friends of the Earth.
Since it takes two days to un
load storage casks from a truck,
the repositories will require 50
cranes working continuously to
handle the waste.
According to Krauskopf, the
obstacles to safe disposal will be
both technical and political. And
he said that the problem will be
solved with a certain degree of
assurance of safety.
Chaim Braun, technical man
ager of the Electric Power Re
search Institute (EPRI), said
he felt that the primary obstacle
is the public perception of the is
sue.
"The general public feeling is
that unless they (the parties re
sponsible for the waste) can
prove that a successful disposal
method exists, no solution will
be acceptable," Braun said.
Georgia Yuan, project geolo
gist for the Natural Resources
Defense Council Inc. (NRDC), a
national environmental law
firm, said she agrees with
Braun. "Until they (the DOE)
recognize that they need to in
clude people in the decision
making process, with mecha
nisms for taking into considera
tion people's fears and ques
tions, they'll never be able to
reach a satisfactory solution."
Scientists may see sincere ef
forts in the DOE's attempts to

include the public, but, Yuan
noted, "they (DOE) are not
pouring money into addressing
social issues, they're not getting
good people involved."
"The people have the right to
be scared," she added.
Harding said he agreed,
warning that the nuclear waste
issue may be a much harder
problem to solve than some peo
ple think.
Braun said he disagreed that
there are technological con
siderations that have yet to be
solved. "Technologically there
is absolutely no problem in pro
ceding right away," he said.
"The question is which institu
tion will manage the waste. "
Harding said he feels strongly
that the DOE is not designed to
build, manage, and technically
prove out a nuclear waste dis
posal site. It was set up to do pol
icy studies, he explained. From
his position as a member of a
National Academy of Sciences
Committee examining waste
disposal issues, Harding has
concluded that the DOE is "in
competant" when it comes to
efficient work.
The government perception
of waste disposal is that per
manent sites will be build by the
DOE, with construction permits
from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC), Krauskopf
explained. But "I'm afraid I re
ally don't know who'd be respon
sible if something goes wrong. I
suppose it would come back to
the company that builds the re
pository." Yuan noted that this
responsibility is a "part of
those institutional questions
which the DOE hasn't dealt with
yet."
The utility idea is to set up a
public corporation to handle
waste management, Braun
said. This corporation would be
set up and initially funded by
utilities, the government, and
other interested parties, even
tually becoming financially
self-sufficient from the disposal
charges from utilities, he said.

yet."
The utility idea is to set up a
public corporation to handle
waste management, Braun
said. This corporation would be
set up and initially funded by
utilities, the government, and
other interested parties, even
tually becoming financially
self-sufficient from the disposal
charges from utilities, he said.
The government has been
grappling with the prob
lem of disposing of high
level radioactive waste since
the birth of the nuclear program
40 years ago.
However, scientists still dis
agree on a safe method for dis
posing of the waste, which is so
toxic that it has to be isolated
from the environment for up to
millions of years.
Nobody knows just how long
the nuclear material will have
to be stored.
Konrad Krauskopf, a Stan
ford geology professor, who has
been working on the problem of
nuclear waste disposal for 11
years, quipped. "If I could an
swer that question, I would get a
Nobel prize."
For such long-term storage,
the federal government is con
sidering putting the material in
salt mines, shooting it into outer
space, or burying it in theocean.
Until the final decision is
made, the waste will continue to
be stored on nuclear reactor
sites and in storage tanks lo
cated on isolated government
"reservations." *
There does not seem to be a
consensus on a safe container
for the nuclear waste.
The nuclear industry is satis
fied with the current level of
technology, according to the
Electric Power Research In
stitute, a Palo Alto utility re
search institute.
The government, however,
prefers to wait for more re
search.
The government's goal is to
keep the waste completely
isolated from the environment
for a thousand years, sealed in
glass and special metal alloy
containers.
The U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) reports indicate
that a waste repository might be
functioning as early as 1997.
Krauskopf called this date a
"fair guess."
The nuclear waste storage

and disposal issue also ques
tions the effectiveness with
which present institutions can
deal with such highly complex
and technical issues.
According to Neville Cook, a
professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, state
government infrastructures
aren't capable of handling the
waste generated by the 150 nu
clear plants nationwide current
ly in operation or under con
struction
Should there be two re
positories to dispose of the
waste, there would be a truck
with waste arriving every 50
minutes all day long, noted Jim
Harding, energy projects direc
tor of Friends of the Earth.
Since it takes two days to un
load storage casks from a truck,
the repositories will require 50
cranes working continuously to
handle the waste.
According to Krauskopf, the
obstacles to safe disposal will be
both technical and political. And
he said that the problem will be
solved with a certain degree of
assurance of safety.
Chaim Braun, technical man
ager of the Electric Power Re
search Institute (EPRI), said
he felt that the primary obstacle
is the public perception of the is
sue.
"The general public feeling is
that unless they (the parties re
sponsible for the waste) can
prove that a successful disposal
method exists, no solution will
be acceptable," Braun said.
Georgia Yuan, project geolo
gist for the Natural Resources
Defense Council Inc. (NRDC), a
national environmental law
firm, said she agrees with
Braun. "Until they (the DOE)
recognize that they need to in
clude people in the decision
making process, with mecha
nisms for taking into considera
tion people's fears and ques
tions, they'll never be able to
reach a satisfactory solution."
Scientists may see sincere ef
forts in the DOE's attempts to

include the public, but, Yuan
noted, "they (DOE) are not
pouring money into addressing
social issues, they're not getting
good people involved."
"The people have the right to
be scared," she added.
Harding said he agreed,
warning that the nuclear waste
issue may be a much harder
problem to solve than some peo
ple think.
Braun said he disagreed that
there are technological con
siderations that have yet to be
solved. "Technologically there
is absolutely no problem in pro
ceding right away," he said.
"The question is which institu
tion will manage the waste. "
Harding said he feels strongly
that the DOE is not designed to
build, manage, and technically
prove out a nuclear waste dis
posal site. It was set up to do pol
icy studies, he explained. From
his position as a member of a
National Academy of Sciences
Committee examining waste
disposal issues, Harding has
concluded that the DOE is "in
competant" when it comes to
efficient work.
The government perception
of waste disposal is that per
manent sites will be build by the
DOE, with construction permits
from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC), Krauskopf
explained. But "I'm afraid I re
ally don't know who'd be respon
sible if something goes wrong. I
suppose it would come back to
the company that builds the re
pository." Yuan noted that this
responsibility is a "part of
those institutional questions
which the DOE hasn't dealt with
yet."
