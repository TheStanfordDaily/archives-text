# Basic research funds are declining
## 
### Theresa Simons 
Amidst the shifting of priorities and
finals in our society, it seems that as fun
ding for scientific research moves in
creasingly towards the endangered spec
ies list, especially under the sharpened
financial ax of the neic administration,
scientific advisory boards and business
consultants steadily increase in their
num hers.
The following is the first of tiro articles
which address this shifting emphasis,
and the effects it will have on society,
scientific research, and technological
growth. . . .

As the Reagan administration's
short-term budget plans (fiscal
years 1981 and 1982) undergo con
gressional scrutiny, academicians and
scientists await a verdict on the future of
research and development in the United
States.
The present budget proposal of the Of
fice of Management and Budget (OMB)
would reduce spending primarily in the
social sciences — the National Science
Foundation (NSF) budgets for econom
ics, psychology and sociology would de
cline by an average of 32.6 percent by
1982.
However, according to Vice-Provost
and Dean of Graduate Studies and Re
search Gerald Lieberman, scientific re
search, although relatively untouched
now, could suffer sharp budget cuts in
the future.
"I feel there will be another round of
cuts, and science and basic research will
be vulnerable," Lieberman said. "It's
not that the new administration is
negative about science — but balancing
the budget is their first priority."

More than 40 percent of the federal
budget is mandated by law and cannot be
changed unless laws are changed. Be
cause basic research, especially scien
tific, is not a mandated part of the
budget, it is more vulnerable to future
budget reductions, according to
Lieberman.
In recent years, both public and
private funding of research has been de
clining in the United States. From 1968 to
1980, research and development as a
fraction of the federal budget decreased
by 38 percent, according to an article by
former NSF director Richard Atkinson
in Education Digest.
Investment by U.S. industry in re
search decreased by 29 percent as a frac
tion of net sales during the same period.
At the same research and de
velopment particularly in science and
technology efforts are on the upswing in
competitive countries Research and de
velopment as a fraction of GNP went up
by 19 percent in Japan. 14 percent in the
Soviet Union, and 16 percent in West Ger
many, according to Atkinson.
Both the Carter administration and
the Reeagan administration recognize
this situation and have included ffinds for
real growth in their basic research
budgets, according to Lieberman.
"The new administration has not pro
posed cuts, but has, in a sense, not in
creased research funding as much (as
the former administration)," he said.
As an indication of a decline in the sup
port of basic research, Lieberman
pointed out that the 1981 and 1982 budget
proposals were designed without the gui
dance of a science adviser. Lieberman
called failure to appoint a science ad

viser a "shrewd strategy" which
enabled the OMB to concentrate on
budget-cutting without having to defend
its actions.
"Indeed, I think that the procedure
that was carried forth was probably in
appropriate," he said. "Even if cuts in
the social sciences were warranted, and
that's questionable, the procedure by
which the director of the OMB (David
Stockman) singles out a specific area
and says the cuts should be here seems
inappropriate. The NSF, not Stockman,
should make the decision."
Scientists have attempted to make the
need for research funds known to the
public and to government, but gaining
widespread support is difficult because
the tradeoffs between the long-term ben
efits of research and the short-term ben
efits of social programs are hard to com
pare, according to Lieberman.
For example, lobbying efforts by uni
versities and the scientific community to
accelerate the appointment of a science
advisor were unsuccessful, he said.
Earl Cilley, director of sponsored
projects, said that although short-term
fluctuations in spending can be disrup
tive to research projects, long-term
trends in financing are more important.
"It is difficult when funding fluctuates
dramatically from year to year. Most
school work at the university is more
productive and works best if financed
over a longer period of time, perhaps as
much as a decade," Cilley said.
"I think that if they're (fiscal plan
ners) not very careful to put a noticeable
amount of our national resources into
creative thinking and original scholar
ship, we are going to very much wish we
had done so — 20 to 25 years from now."
