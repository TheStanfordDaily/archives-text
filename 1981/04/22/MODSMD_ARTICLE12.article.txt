# SLAC plans anger neighbors
## Homeowners say new atom smasher is an eye-sore 
### Cathy Janus 
Despite the angry opposition
of nearby homeowners, the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) has submitted a
proposal to build' a pioneering
$90 million atomic particle
smasher to the federal govern
ment asking for funds beginning
in the fiscal year 1983.
There are five SLAC buildings
where atomic particles are
smashed together after being
accelerated around the PEP
ring. The new collider will con
sist of an underground tunnel
system at the end of the linear
accelerator of approximately a
mile and a half in length, and an
above-ground research building
at the point where the particles
will collide.
Opposition to the proposed
project is due mainly to home
owner's questioning of what
they will be looking at in three
years. "SLAC consistently
breaks promises," said one
Stanford Hills homeowner.
Marty Coddington, secretary
of the Stanford Hills Home
owners Association, said that
the four buildings of the PEP
Ring looked small on a model. In
reality, she said, these buildings
that should have been topped by
trees, tower over some very
small trees that won't mature
"in our life time."
"I feel very keenly that large
sums of money should be in the
budget from the beginning."
Coddington said she is sort of
resigned to the project. "There
is nothing we can do — it will
happen, but the land should be
made as visually attractive as
possible." She said SLAC is also
trying to avoid doing a proper
environmental impact study.
They think it would be ex
pensive, she said, but "it should
be done."
"There is a high degree of
skepticism as to what they
(SLAC) say and do. Our concern
is with what they said before
(about the PEP ring) and what
resulted," according to Ted
Aldridge, Stanford Hills Home
owners Association president.
He said they were told that the
PEP Ring would be unob
trusive. "Quite the opposite was
true." He said the ugly buildings
weren't in the original plan.
Aldridge said most people in

the neighborhood are somewhat
concerned about the prospect.
"The noise is very disturbing to
people who live closest to it,"he
said.During the proposed con
struction period there would be
dust and blasting during all
hours of the day and night, she
said.
Aldridge said SLAC has been
very responsive to some of their
complaints. They have been
very good about changing part
of the construction area after

. . . the four buildings of the PEP King
looked small on a model that has since
disappeared. In reality, she said, these
buildings that should have been topped by
trees, tower over some very small trees that
won '112 mature "in our life time. "

much discussion that the home
owners pursued, he said.
Aldridge said they planted very
small trees which might help
somewhat.
As far as being a taxpayer is
concerned, Aldridge doesn't
think the project has a lot of
merit. "Private industry would
finance it if it was worthy," he
said. "It's a lot of money for a
project with questionable bene
fits." Aldridge said he did think
that SLAC has had good benefits
so far. He said they developed
cancer treatments that were
"very beneficial."
Kevin Obrien, another home
owner, said, "I bet over half the
people in this neighborhood are
in favor of it (the proposed
project). At worst it is 50-50."
Those opposed "imagine more
inconveniences than they ex
perience," he said.
People think things will stay
the same as the day they moved
in — that's baloney," Obrien
said.
"Construction isn't simple;
earth has to be moved. That's
progress," he said. "That's life.
Things change; you have to roll
with the punches." This is a one
of a kind facility, Obrien said.
"It's really important. I hope
it's a success." He said there
will be a few years of construc

tion, but "in the meantime we'll
all survive."
Budd Coddington thinks SLAC
should protect homeowners
from the ugliness. "Stanford
Hills people have the right to
comment on something that will
affect them," he said. "Last
time they (SLAC) claimed they
ran out of money for land
scaping; that's ridiculous,"
said Coddington. "I'm inclined
to favor these projects," but
they should be "best calculated

so as not to disturb," Cod
dington said. He said that two
buildings had bright red doors
before, and when they were re
painted another color the
change was remarkable.
There are about 78 homes in
Stanford Hills area; the land is
leased from Stanford Univer
sity.
Frank Donnelly said he ques
tions the need for the atomic
particle smasher. "I question
whether the project is really
necessary." He said that a simi
lar project is being conducted in
Switzerland, and the U.S. should
obtain their information from
Switzerland. Professors have a
tendency to want to get a
"feather in their caps" and do
things themselves; they com
pete with other institutions in
stead of sharing their knowl
edge, Donnelly said. If the fed
eral government is trying to
economize, they should save
money by denying SLAC further
funds, he said.
Since the project hasn't been
authorized, it wouldn't hurt any
body; they would lose the ability
to experiment, but this is "bet
ter than cutting funds that help
the poor," said Donnelly. He
said he doesn't know of anyone
who favors the project.

"Our experience now is that
there's noise from ventilators
and pumps in the PEP Ring "
The proposed addition to the
area will ruin the rural view and
make it look industrial. They
are adding a building and a
fence, he said.
Donnelly said he also wonders
about the possibility ot radio
active dust from the ventilators.
The ventilators should be ducted
several hundred feet from the
residences, he said, and they
should have proper filters.
Willard Classen, Stanford
Hills homeowner, said he also
opposes the project. "It doesn t
make me happy" that they in
tend to build a radiation fence
with barbed wire within 80 feet
of my property," he said. He
said that the area is noisy. "I
don't know what it is, but I hear
a chug, chug noise," Classen
said.
Classen attended a meeting
concerning the proposal and
said that at present there is no
money so there's really nothing
to say. "It's just in the forma
tive stage," he said. He con
cluded that everyone he knows
is against the project. "The peo
ple most affected will be on the
golf course side of Alpine Road
— I feel sorry for them."

think the project has a lot of
merit. "Private industry would
finance it if it was worthy," he
said. "It's a lot of money for a
project with questionable bene
fits." Aldridge said he did think
that SLAC has had good benefits
so far. He said they developed
cancer treatments that were
"very beneficial."
Kevin Obrien, another home
owner, said, "I bet over half the
people in this neighborhood are
in favor of it (the proposed
project). At worst it is 50-50."
Those opposed "imagine more
inconveniences than they ex
perience," he said.
People think things will stay
the same as the day they moved
in — that's baloney," Obrien
said.
"Construction isn't simple;
earth has to be moved. That's
progress," he said. "That's life.
Things change; you have to roll
with the punches." This is a one
of a kind facility, Obrien said.
"It's really important. I hope
it's a success." He said there
will be a few years of construc

tion, but "in the meantime we'll
all survive."
Budd Coddington thinks SLAC
should protect homeowners
from the ugliness. "Stanford
Hills people have the right to
comment on something that will
affect them," he said. "Last
time they (SLAC) claimed they
ran out of money for land
scaping; that's ridiculous,"
said Coddington. "I'm inclined
to favor these projects," but
they should be "best calculated

so as not to disturb," Cod
dington said. He said that two
buildings had bright red doors
before, and when they were re
painted another color the
change was remarkable.
There are about 78 homes in
Stanford Hills area; the land is
leased from Stanford Univer
sity.
Frank Donnelly said he ques
tions the need for the atomic
particle smasher. "I question
whether the project is really
necessary." He said that a simi
lar project is being conducted in
Switzerland, and the U.S. should
obtain their information from
Switzerland. Professors have a
tendency to want to get a
"feather in their caps" and do
things themselves; they com
pete with other institutions in
stead of sharing their knowl
edge, Donnelly said. If the fed
eral government is trying to
economize, they should save
money by denying SLAC further
funds, he said.
Since the project hasn't been
authorized, it wouldn't hurt any
body; they would lose the ability
to experiment, but this is "bet
ter than cutting funds that help
the poor," said Donnelly. He
said he doesn't know of anyone
who favors the project.

"Our experience now is that
there's noise from ventilators
and pumps in the PEP Ring "
The proposed addition to the
area will ruin the rural view and
make it look industrial. They
are adding a building and a
fence, he said.
Donnelly said he also wonders
about the possibility ot radio
active dust from the ventilators.
The ventilators should be ducted
several hundred feet from the
residences, he said, and they
should have proper filters.
Willard Classen, Stanford
Hills homeowner, said he also
opposes the project. "It doesn t
make me happy" that they in
tend to build a radiation fence
with barbed wire within 80 feet
of my property," he said. He
said that the area is noisy. "I
don't know what it is, but I hear
a chug, chug noise," Classen
said.
Classen attended a meeting
concerning the proposal and
said that at present there is no
money so there's really nothing
to say. "It's just in the forma
tive stage," he said. He con
cluded that everyone he knows
is against the project. "The peo
ple most affected will be on the
golf course side of Alpine Road
— I feel sorry for them."

The site of the new PEP ring at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) is adjacent to a resi
dential district of Stanford Hills. Local homeowners are concerned about the probable noise, inconve
nience, and ugliness of the proposed atom-smasher facility.
Despite the angry opposition
of nearby homeowners, the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) has submitted a
proposal to build' a pioneering
$90 million atomic particle
smasher to the federal govern
ment asking for funds beginning
in the fiscal year 1983.
There are five SLAC buildings
where atomic particles are
smashed together after being
accelerated around the PEP
ring. The new collider will con
sist of an underground tunnel
system at the end of the linear
accelerator of approximately a
mile and a half in length, and an
above-ground research building
at the point where the particles
will collide.
Opposition to the proposed
project is due mainly to home
owner's questioning of what
they will be looking at in three
years. "SLAC consistently
breaks promises," said one
Stanford Hills homeowner.
Marty Coddington, secretary
of the Stanford Hills Home
owners Association, said that
the four buildings of the PEP
Ring looked small on a model. In
reality, she said, these buildings
that should have been topped by
trees, tower over some very
small trees that won't mature
"in our life time."
"I feel very keenly that large
sums of money should be in the
budget from the beginning."
Coddington said she is sort of
resigned to the project. "There
is nothing we can do — it will
happen, but the land should be
made as visually attractive as
possible." She said SLAC is also
trying to avoid doing a proper
environmental impact study.
They think it would be ex
pensive, she said, but "it should
be done."
"There is a high degree of
skepticism as to what they
(SLAC) say and do. Our concern
is with what they said before
(about the PEP ring) and what
resulted," according to Ted
Aldridge, Stanford Hills Home
owners Association president.
He said they were told that the
PEP Ring would be unob
trusive. "Quite the opposite was
true." He said the ugly buildings
weren't in the original plan.
Aldridge said most people in

the neighborhood are somewhat
concerned about the prospect.
"The noise is very disturbing to
people who live closest to it,"he
said.During the proposed con
struction period there would be
dust and blasting during all
hours of the day and night, she
said.
Aldridge said SLAC has been
very responsive to some of their
complaints. They have been
very good about changing part
of the construction area after

. . . the four buildings of the PEP King
looked small on a model that has since
disappeared. In reality, she said, these
buildings that should have been topped by
trees, tower over some very small trees that
won '112 mature "in our life time. "

owners pursued, he said.
Aldridge said they planted very
small trees which might help
somewhat.

fence, he said.
Donnelly said he also wonders
about the possibility ot radio
active dust from the ventilators.
The ventilators should be ducted
several hundred feet from the
residences, he said, and they
should have proper filters.
Willard Classen, Stanford
Hills homeowner, said he also
opposes the project. "It doesn t
make me happy" that they in
tend to build a radiation fence
with barbed wire within 80 feet
of my property," he said. He
said that the area is noisy. "I
don't know what it is, but I hear
a chug, chug noise," Classen
said.
Classen attended a meeting
concerning the proposal and
said that at present there is no
money so there's really nothing
to say. "It's just in the forma
tive stage," he said. He con
cluded that everyone he knows
is against the project. "The peo
ple most affected will be on the
golf course side of Alpine Road
— I feel sorry for them."
