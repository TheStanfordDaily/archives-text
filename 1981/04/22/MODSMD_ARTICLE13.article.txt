# Court confirms Franklin decision
## 
### Cynthia Moses 
The 10-year-long court battle to overturn
a Stanford Advisory Board decision that put
Professor H. Bruce Franklin out of a job
continued last month in Santa Clara Superi
or Court. Judge John Flaherty upheld Stan
ford's dismissal of Franklin resulting from
his anti-Vietnam War activities.
Franklin was the first tenured professor
to be fired by Stanford in over 50 years.
According to American Civil Liberties
Union lawyer Alan Schlosser, the ACLU will
appeal the decision. Schlosser said, "The
ACLU feels that Stanford violated the First
Amendment," and he indicated the ACLU
will continue to appeal until it is satisfied
with the outcome.
Schlosser said, "Stanford's whole theory
is basically insulting to students and faculty
who were supposedly led around like
sheep."
Attorney David Heilbron, representing
Stanford University, said he was pleased
with Judge Flaherty's decision. "I would
hope the matter would come to an end by the
time the next appeal has run its course. It
has gone on far too long already," Heilbron

said.
In a recent telephone interview. Franklin
told the Daily that the court's decision was,
"pretty much as expected since the Santa
Clara Superior Court belongs to Stanford
University."
When asked to comment on Franklin's
statement, Heilbron said it was "pre
posterous" and worth pointing out that
Judge Flaherty is a very, highly regarded
judge.
Franklin, 46, is currently a tenured pro
fessor at Rutgers University in New Jersey
where he has received an award for dist
inguished teaching.
Schlosser explained that the 1972 firing
left Franklin unemployed and un
employable for three years. The ACLU is
working to recover damages from Stanford
for Franklin.
Franklin, a self-proclaimed Maoist, said,
"Stanford and the FBI went to great lengths
to prevent me from getting any em
ployment. Deprivation of a job is an attack
on an individual."
This semester Franklin is teaching a

course entitled "Vietnam in America." He
said that he is also involved in a movement
against U.S. intervention in El Salvador.
"Rutgers is quite different from Stanford
in 1971. You don't see the direct involvement
of the administration," Franklin said.
The Stanford faculty advisory board rec
ommended Franklin's dismissal in January
of 1972 on the basis of speeches delivered at
White Plaza, the computation center and
the Old Union. The board held that these
speeches were inflammatory and incited
student action.
In 1978, the ACLU appealed in Franklin's
behalf. Judge Flaherty upheld two of the
three principal charges. At that time, the
Advisory Board reviewed Franklin's case
again and decided to hold with the decision
to dismiss him.
Flaherty's ruling last month upheld the
decision of the Stanford faculty advisory
board, the University's Board of Trustees
and former Stanford President Richard
Lyman.
Franklin said, "We are confident we'll
win when the case gets to the California Su
preme Court."
