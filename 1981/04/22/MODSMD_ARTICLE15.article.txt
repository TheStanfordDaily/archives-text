# University community comments on proposed clerical union
## The 						Stanford Daily Opinions 
### 
Noise effective
A few thoughts follow regard
ing the letter sent to me from
the University dated March 17.
Q. "Why did the University
give the Union my home ad
dress?": This is a ridiculous
question. If you've ever noticed
your home mail as I have, you
would have noticed that you re
ceive tons of junk mail, the
senders of which have in some
cases obtained your private res
idence address from the Univer
sity. I would rather the Union
have my address than Stanford.
I would probably receive less
junk!
Q. "If I signed one of the union
"blue cards" does that mean I
must vote for the Union on May
7? ": I am insulted by the partic
ular "question and answer"
routine. This is the typical at
titude of management that the
backbone of this University, the
clerical people, are so naive and
ignorant that they would arbi
trarily sign something that they
knew nothing about. I signed my
blue card because I believe in
the Union and what it will do for
me. I also believe that Union
considers me a knowledgeable,
intelligent employee who is
aware of the issues involved, not
some dimwit who signs a blue
card because she/he is afraid to
say "NO" to someone.
Then there is all this garbage
about dues, financial fees, etc.
that seems to be a big point with
the University. Of course there
will be certain fees. Of course
the union needs money to run
itself or it wouldn't be a viable
alternative to the employment
practices of the University
(poor pay, misclassification).
Any large group needs a cer
tain amount of financial back
ing, and the dues are a good way
for each member to contribute a
small amount to keep their
bargaining unit functioning. It is
not such a backbreaking
amount, and if the University
would ever look at the past his
tory of Local 715, they would be
very upset to notice that there
probably is no record of "addi
tional financial payments" re
quested of their members. The
USE Chapter of Local 715 has
never levied fees in addition to
dues since they became or
ganized.
Q. "If Local 715 is elected will
I receive higher wages than I
would receive without a
-union?" (Obviously this partic
ular clerical would sign any
thing from anybody). This has
already been answered by the
fact that everytime the union
makes a little noise we get an in
crease. The union pushed for
certain critical issues last year,
and the University rebutted
with a higher increase and addi
tional benefits. Again the union
is making louder noises this
year and again the University is
rebutting with talk of revamp
ing the step sytem and increas
ing wages. I for one am not to
tally convinced that these in
creases would have occurred
without pressure of organizing
from the union.

Issues 'muddied'
The Offices of the Provost
and Vice-President for Business
and Finance have recently
launched a campaign to try to
slow down our unionization
drive. It is very important to
that we each see PrQvost Albert
Hastorf and Vice President for
Business and Finance William
Massy's "education" endeavors
for what they are — poorly re
searched attempts to use their
offices as a means to color our
judgement and muddy the real
issues raised by our continuing
effort to gain a legal and binding
contract with the University.
Recently these two gen
tlemen have sent each of the
clerical staff two such "educa
tional" missives. The first was
sent to us at our homes, and the
second distributed to us at our
job sites. Each of these missives
requires examination.
In the first of these com
munications we were told that
the Union can call a strike if ne
gotiations between our elected
Union representatives and the
University break down. This is a
misconception. The member
ship is polled regarding pro
posed contracts, and our nego
tiators (whom we elect) would
not "call a strike" without a
massive majority vote from the
membership. In short, there
can't be a strike unless we, the
membership, overwhelmingly
vote for one. This letter at
tempted to portray the Union as
some distant third party. In
fact, the Union is each of us.
Hastorf and Massy's "third par
ty" notion falls just short of
being a deliberate misconcep
tion, and is not the sort of re
search that has placed Stanford
in the prestigious position the
University now enjoys.
The second publication from
the Provost and Business and

Finance dealt with comparative
salaries This communication
intimates that Local 715 (our lo
cal when we win the election)
has not gained much for the
clerical units the Local repre
sents in San Mateo County,
Redwood City. Palo Alto and
Santa Gara counties. This is in
ferred via several graphs com
paring the present and proposed
salaries from these cities and
counties with Stanford's present
and proposed salary ranges.
Hastorf and Massy have asked
us to compare apples and or
anges because they are fruit in
this instance. The salaries listed
that are under contract from the
cities and counties are those of
public sector employers, and
Stanford is a private sector em
ployer. Traditionally the public
sector is under more stringent
budgetary restraint than is the
private sector. These gen
tlemen have failed to compare
Stanford's salary ranges with
those of other private em
ployers who are under contract.
The job classifications which
were compared (i.e., "Account
ing Assistant I") were not
carefully researched, if they
were researched at all. The
stated classificatin of, for in
stance, the "Acct. Clk I" gave
Stanford's salary as $965 -$1050
In truth. Santa Clara's real
equivalent job classification re
ceives $1048 — $1268. This repre
sents an error made by Hastorf
and Massy to the tune of some
$200 per month.
Additionally, these two gen
tlemen include in their quota
tions of Stanford's salaries the
merit zone figures. If we ex
amine their graphs for Stanford
we can easily see that the merit
zone salary figures account for
one-hcilf (the top half) of the
University salary figures. It
should be mentioned that once
an employee reaches the merit
zone area, it is entirely up to
his/her supervisor whether s/he
will ever receive any of that
amount.
There is no guarantee that
any of us will receive one penny
once we enter the merit zone.
This is one of the points which
many of the clerical staff want
to see addressed via contractual
bargaining. Without a contract
which is legal and binding, we
have no assurances that Stan
ford will give us the announced
pay raises.
A historical perspective on
traditional attitudes Stanford's
management has held is in or
der when reviewing these two
communications from Hastorf
and Massy. These letters were
brought to us by the folks who.
two years ago, gave us a 6.5 per
cent cost-of-living increase in
the face of double-digit infla
tion! Clearly, management was
unconcerned about our welfare
then, but that was before we
began to organize. These
"educational" attempts are
brought to us by the folks who.
that same year, took one week
of vacation away from new em
ployees. Had we had a contract
at that point, management
would have not been able to pull
a stunt like that.
These "communications" are
brought to us by the folks who,
when our blue-card drive was in
full swing last year, suddenly
announced their "concern" for
us with a 10 percent cost-of-liv
ing increase in an effort to abort
our unionization drive. The folks
who, seeing our determination,
became concerned enough to of
fer us the recently quoted salary
increases while saying that the
increases were due to a "1978
study." If this is so, why were
the increases not implemented
in 1978? Did we need such in
creases any less then, or was the
outmoded steps system any less
effective then? Clearly not.
What has changed, however, is
that we of the clerical and li
brary staff have shown our
force and our intention, and
Hastorf and Massy have
responded with last-minute ef
forts to appease us in hopes that
the spector of the Union would
go away.
We of the clerical and library
staff are not unreasonable
rowdies bent on the destruction
of the system. We are well
educated people who enjoy
working for Stanford. We come
from the same sorts of back
grounds that Hastorf and Massy
come from. We are, however,
dedicated to the notion that we
are intelligent human beings
who want a hand and a voice in
our futures, and who want to be
considered as professionals who
do our jobs very well, rather
than being considered "the
girl."
We found that asking for these
considerations without the
backing of an organization got
us nowhere. We then preceded
to the next obvious step — that
of unionization. We believe that
our services for the University
entitle us to decent wages and
working conditions We feel en
titled to adequate grievance
procedures. And we can't help
wondering why our requests are
met with such suspicion and dis

trust by Hastorf and Massy.

Unions ineffective
We have been bombared with
articles in the various campus
publications and by OSOC news
letters telling us why we should
have a union. Before we cast our
ballots we need facts in order to
make an intelligent decision.
I should like to state here that
the facts presented below are
the results of 40 years' secretar
ial experience, 19 of which have
been on the Stanford campus,
and a lot of homework on the
current clerical scene in several

of the large prestigious in
dustrial firms here on the penin
sula.
Stanford is not unique in its
shortage of qualified clerical
help. Unions do not provide
properly trained clerical staff
and a union is not going to solve
the problems here. Industrial
affiliates of the Department of
Industrial Engineering report
that unions are now beginning to
accept the fact that they are no
longer effective agents in ob
taining solutions to problems
encountered in the working
world.
To address specifics — the
"low" salaries at Stanford as a
reason for a union. A com
parison with the salaries of four
of the most prestigious firms
here on the peninsula to the ex
tent they were made available
revealed that Stanford salaries
matched and in some cases,
were even better. Now I had
been wondering why, if the
salaries at Stanford were so
much lower, the agitators for
higher salaries did not flock to
take advantage of the openings
in these firms — the results of
the comparison are the answer.
If they remain because they pre
fer the academic environment,
then they must be willing to
make a trade-off.
Service organizations cannot
compete salary-wise with firms
producing end products for prof
it and union dues will only
shrink our take-home pay even
further without any guaranteed
benefits! And it is really absurd
to compare the salaries of sec
retaries and lab technicians as
was done in a recent edition of
the OSOC News!
Where will you get two weeks
paid vacation the first year you
work plus 12 days sick leave, or
where will you get bereavement
leave without having it charged
to vacation leave, or more than
three weeks vacation a year?
Other benefits offered by var
ious employers must also be
carefully compared. It has been
argued that the dental plan was
implemented to forestall
unionization but investigation
revealed that dental plans were
being scrutinized for implemen
tation for at least two years
prior to Sept. 1, 1980 You cer
tainly will not get tuition schol
arships from any industrial
firm. Stock options and profit
sharing cannot be compared
with tuition scholarships, albeit
not everyone has children to
take advantage of this privilege,
but one of the reasons given for
demanding higher salaries was
to cope with the increased costs

of raising children, of which the
cost of education plays a major
part. This is having $3000 plus
added to your salary without
having to pay tax on it. Stock op
tions and profit sharing have
proved risky indeed to the em
ployees of firms with these
"benefits."
Plans are now being eval
uated to update retirement ben
efits so that upcoming retirees
will fare better.
Those of the clerical staff of
this university who have such a
low opinion of the occupation
and themselves should re-ex
amine the reasons why they
chose clerical work and Stan
ford in the first place. There is

no problem that the right person
in the admnistration will not ad
dress. It may take a few phone
calls but one will learn a lot
about Stanford, who to contact
for what, and discover a lot of
friends you didn't know you had.
The esprit is not as evident as it
once was due to the increase in
size of all departments and the
rapidity with which new pro
grams have to be implemented
and old ones constantly updated
in order to keep step with busi
ness and industry, but it is there
is one makes the effort to identi
fy with the University and the
opportunities it offers.
We all have a job to do which
carries responsibilities as well
as compensations and ev
erything cannot be done at once
either in our own personal lives
nor in the organization of which
we are a part to solve problems
which arise. We should not ex
pect the responsibilities for our
individual well-being to be as
sumed by an organization. It is
too soul-destroying to those who
have trained properly and
worked patiently to be darned
good secretaries who enjoy
their work to have those who are
unhappy demean the profession,
themselves, and their col
leagues.
The office staff has had an or
ganization on this campus for 30
years to "promote the fellow
ship and mutual helpfulness of
its members" but has never had
a membership of more than a
fraction of those eligible to join
(and the dues are only three
dollars per year.) A union will
fare no better when it comes to
representation at meetings. Al
ready U.S.E. had had to lower
its quorum to 15 to conduct busi
ness. I don't want people who
try to convince me of the merits
of a union by comparing apples
and bananas dictating the terms
of my position.
Vote no on May 7.
(Mildred Nilsson is a secretary
in industrial engineering.)
Cast vote
We have read the literature
circulated by the union and by
the University and have come to
the following conclusions .
First and foremost — it is vi
tal to vote on May 7 whether you
are for or against the union. If
you are against the union and do
not vote you have given others
the right to decide your job
future.
It would be nice to think that a
union or some other miracle
will guarantee that all man
agers and supervisors would be

perfect, that there would be ac
knowledgement for a job well
done, that a job will be classi
fied at the appropriate level for
the responsibility but at this
point the union has not con
vinced us that this unattainable
goal is attainable if they be
came our spokesman.
It can be hoped that the dis
cussion generated by union ac
tivity might encourage man
agement to look at the super
vision and if need be upgrade the
skilss those managers who need
this assistance. We night all
benefit from such evaluation
with action taken where re
quired.
If after the vote the union has

been accepted — you will be giv
en the opportunity to join or not
to join. You should also re
member that the salary changes
proposed for September will no
longer be applicable. ALL
salaries, benefits and working
conditions become negotiable
once the union has been voted in.
If you join, we believe . . .
You will be part of a group
whose bylaws will be developed
locally but based on the bylaws
of the National and Local 715.
You will be subject to dis
ciplinary action by the union if
required. — You will as a mem
ber vote for your represent
ative. — You will as a member
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will be able to vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — If you wish to file a
grievance, the union must agree
with you and act for you. They
are not required to file your
grievance and you may not file
on your own. — Job reclass
ifications, merit raises and oth
er working conditions will be
governed by union contract. —
If a strike is called — as a mem
ber you may not cross the picket
line. If you choose to do so you
will be subject to union dis
ciplinary action. You will not be
paid. *
If you do not join . . . You may
still be required to pay a "ser
vice fee." This will be at least
equal to the amount of dues
assessed. — You will not vote on
a representative. — You will not
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will not vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — You will not be sub
ject to union rules. — You (in all
probability) would be subject to
dismissal if you refuse to pay
the service fee. The University
will have no option on this. —
You will be subject to the same
grievance procedures as set
forth by the union. — In the
event of a strike you may con
tinue to work and you will con
tinue to be paid.
We can only hope that you all
will consider all the facts and
regardless of your stand, vote
on May 7.

troller's Office, School of

University inaction
Through the distribution of
four "Election Bulletins," the
University has attempted to put
the clerical union in a very
negative light. The emphasis
has been on what the union can't
do for us and, indeed, what it

may adversely do to us. How
ever, I have yet to read about
what the University can and will
do for us so that we don't need a
union.
Also, if the University wants
to bring out the "facts," per
haps it should be mentioned that
the Committee on the Education
and Employment of Women in
the University (C-EEWU) has
been abolished. In Campus Re
port, (Oct. 1, 1980), this com
mittee published a lengthy re
port on clerical dissatisfaction
with their jobs, influenced
largely by a perceived lack of
opportunity for promotion or
mobility.
Other factors, such as lack of
communication with super
visors, lack of staff develop
ment programs, and relatively
low salaries, were also men
tioned. C-EEWU made several
recommendations for improv
ing clerical conditions, with the
hope that they would be serious
ly considered for future study by
the University.
In a note dated Mar. 26, 1981,
Marion E. Smith, C-EEWU
Chairman, stated, "... The C
EEWU was abolished by the
Committee on Committees this
year as being unnecessary." In
light of this, I would appreciate
knowing just how the University
proposes to take such good care
of us that the union is unneces
sary.

Grievances fail
As May 7 approaches, I would
like to pass along two personal
experiences that might be in
formative to the undecided.
The first experience resulted
from a grievance I filed about
three years ago, and in which I
requested an outside hearing of
ficer. In violation of the Univer
sity's grievance procedures,
that officer was denied. As a re
sult, I filed suit before the Supe
rior Court of Santa Clara Coun
ty, asking that the University be
compelled to carry out its griev
ance procedures. Much to my
surprise, the Court ruled that
Stanford's Administration
Guide does not have " ... the
stature of a legally binding con
tract." In other words, not only
is the University not required to
abide by its own leaky grievance
procedures, the University is
not bound by any of the con
tents of that guide, which
touches on such crucial matters
as salaries, promotions, etc.
The second experience re
sulted from another grievance
filed last year. This grievance
was unsuccessful, of course (95
percent of them are). Recourse
was sought through the Equal
Employment Opportunity Com
mission in San Jose. During the
initial stages of the interview,
the commission's represent
ative took the liberty of telling
me, a complainant, that a mem
ber of the University's legal
staff had confessed to him that,
yes, there is racism at Stanford,
but would deny ever having said
it if quoted. I was doubly
startled; first, in the Univer
sity's representative feeling so
comfortable with the com
mission that the statement
could be made to it; second, by
the commission's represent
ative's presumption in relating
this to me, a person seeking the
protection of the commission
After trying to recover from
this confidence-evoking revel
ation, I was later faced with an
other. I signed a complaint with

the commission, of course,
which was sent to the University
for a response. The University's
response to my complaint was
not made available to me, and I
learned that it would not be, un
less permitted by the Univer
sity. It should be needless to say
that the University's counsel re
fused to let me see the response
My concern was that the com
mission could not make an en
lightened ruling on the case un
less exposed to free discussion
of the complaint and the re
sponse, but such was not the
case. Although the courts re
mained as a mechanism for
pursuing the complaint further,
due process should operate in all
agencies as well.
The bottom line is that if an
employee is to obtain fairness at
Stanford, it apparently must be
through a union and not through
administrative guides and gov
ernmental agencies.

Union needed
I would like to express my dis
pleasure with the decision re
garding the hearing of Rita
Mazon. I read the article con
cerning Rita's grievance in the
Daily and based on the facts sur
rounding the case, I feel the
hearing was unjust.
This case is a valid example
of Stanford's "fair" grievance
procedure. As a non-exempt of
fice workers, feel it is at my
best interest to vote for the
union. As we (office staff) stand
now, it is apparent that we have
no voice and whatever man
agement decides is final. Unless
we unite, Stanford will never ac
knowledge our grievances.
I am encouraging all of the
eligible office workers to vote
yes on May 7, union election
day. If you don't vote, don't
complain. Remember, what
happened to Rita could happen
to you. United we stand, divided
we fall.

Salary issue
Recently, the Provost and
Vice President for Business and
Finance circulated Election
Bulletin I to members of the
University Office and Library
Support Staff. It responded to an
issue that had been raised by
USE/Local 715 — namely, com
parative salary ranges for sev
eral classifications of employ
ees at Stanford and the surroun
ding community.
This Bulletin attempted to
put the salary issue into per
spective, and I applaud the at
tempt: the bar chart format
was quite helpful.
It would now be even more
helpful (in making a rational de
cision before the election), if
Provost Albert Hastorf and Mr.
William Massy, Vice President
for Business and Finance, would
now go one step further and
furnish us with the mean and
standard deviation of the salary
distribution, with reference
only to Stanford salaries. To put
it simply, let us know what the
salary spread within each range
looks like. For example, do
more secretary lis earn close to
$1000 or $1350 now? Will more
secretary Ills be earning $1300
or $1750 in September?
This information is pertinent
to the issue raised and will, I
hope, be presented in a forth
coming Bulletin.

many of the clerical staff want
to see addressed via contractual
bargaining. Without a contract
which is legal and binding, we
have no assurances that Stan
ford will give us the announced
pay raises.
A historical perspective on
traditional attitudes Stanford's
management has held is in or
der when reviewing these two
communications from Hastorf
and Massy. These letters were
brought to us by the folks who.
two years ago, gave us a 6.5 per
cent cost-of-living increase in
the face of double-digit infla
tion! Clearly, management was
unconcerned about our welfare
then, but that was before we
began to organize. These
"educational" attempts are
brought to us by the folks who.
that same year, took one week
of vacation away from new em
ployees. Had we had a contract
at that point, management
would have not been able to pull
a stunt like that.
These "communications" are
brought to us by the folks who,
when our blue-card drive was in
full swing last year, suddenly
announced their "concern" for
us with a 10 percent cost-of-liv
ing increase in an effort to abort
our unionization drive. The folks
who, seeing our determination,
became concerned enough to of
fer us the recently quoted salary
increases while saying that the
increases were due to a "1978
study." If this is so, why were
the increases not implemented
in 1978? Did we need such in
creases any less then, or was the
outmoded steps system any less
effective then? Clearly not.
What has changed, however, is
that we of the clerical and li
brary staff have shown our
force and our intention, and
Hastorf and Massy have
responded with last-minute ef
forts to appease us in hopes that
the spector of the Union would
go away.
We of the clerical and library
staff are not unreasonable
rowdies bent on the destruction
of the system. We are well
educated people who enjoy
working for Stanford. We come
from the same sorts of back
grounds that Hastorf and Massy
come from. We are, however,
dedicated to the notion that we
are intelligent human beings
who want a hand and a voice in
our futures, and who want to be
considered as professionals who
do our jobs very well, rather
than being considered "the
girl."
We found that asking for these
considerations without the
backing of an organization got
us nowhere. We then preceded
to the next obvious step — that
of unionization. We believe that
our services for the University
entitle us to decent wages and
working conditions We feel en
titled to adequate grievance
procedures. And we can't help
wondering why our requests are
met with such suspicion and dis

trust by Hastorf and Massy.

Unions ineffective
We have been bombared with
articles in the various campus
publications and by OSOC news
letters telling us why we should
have a union. Before we cast our
ballots we need facts in order to
make an intelligent decision.
I should like to state here that
the facts presented below are
the results of 40 years' secretar
ial experience, 19 of which have
been on the Stanford campus,
and a lot of homework on the
current clerical scene in several

of the large prestigious in
dustrial firms here on the penin
sula.
Stanford is not unique in its
shortage of qualified clerical
help. Unions do not provide
properly trained clerical staff
and a union is not going to solve
the problems here. Industrial
affiliates of the Department of
Industrial Engineering report
that unions are now beginning to
accept the fact that they are no
longer effective agents in ob
taining solutions to problems
encountered in the working
world.
To address specifics — the
"low" salaries at Stanford as a
reason for a union. A com
parison with the salaries of four
of the most prestigious firms
here on the peninsula to the ex
tent they were made available
revealed that Stanford salaries
matched and in some cases,
were even better. Now I had
been wondering why, if the
salaries at Stanford were so
much lower, the agitators for
higher salaries did not flock to
take advantage of the openings
in these firms — the results of
the comparison are the answer.
If they remain because they pre
fer the academic environment,
then they must be willing to
make a trade-off.
Service organizations cannot
compete salary-wise with firms
producing end products for prof
it and union dues will only
shrink our take-home pay even
further without any guaranteed
benefits! And it is really absurd
to compare the salaries of sec
retaries and lab technicians as
was done in a recent edition of
the OSOC News!
Where will you get two weeks
paid vacation the first year you
work plus 12 days sick leave, or
where will you get bereavement
leave without having it charged
to vacation leave, or more than
three weeks vacation a year?
Other benefits offered by var
ious employers must also be
carefully compared. It has been
argued that the dental plan was
implemented to forestall
unionization but investigation
revealed that dental plans were
being scrutinized for implemen
tation for at least two years
prior to Sept. 1, 1980 You cer
tainly will not get tuition schol
arships from any industrial
firm. Stock options and profit
sharing cannot be compared
with tuition scholarships, albeit
not everyone has children to
take advantage of this privilege,
but one of the reasons given for
demanding higher salaries was
to cope with the increased costs

of raising children, of which the
cost of education plays a major
part. This is having $3000 plus
added to your salary without
having to pay tax on it. Stock op
tions and profit sharing have
proved risky indeed to the em
ployees of firms with these
"benefits."
Plans are now being eval
uated to update retirement ben
efits so that upcoming retirees
will fare better.
Those of the clerical staff of
this university who have such a
low opinion of the occupation
and themselves should re-ex
amine the reasons why they
chose clerical work and Stan
ford in the first place. There is

no problem that the right person
in the admnistration will not ad
dress. It may take a few phone
calls but one will learn a lot
about Stanford, who to contact
for what, and discover a lot of
friends you didn't know you had.
The esprit is not as evident as it
once was due to the increase in
size of all departments and the
rapidity with which new pro
grams have to be implemented
and old ones constantly updated
in order to keep step with busi
ness and industry, but it is there
is one makes the effort to identi
fy with the University and the
opportunities it offers.
We all have a job to do which
carries responsibilities as well
as compensations and ev
erything cannot be done at once
either in our own personal lives
nor in the organization of which
we are a part to solve problems
which arise. We should not ex
pect the responsibilities for our
individual well-being to be as
sumed by an organization. It is
too soul-destroying to those who
have trained properly and
worked patiently to be darned
good secretaries who enjoy
their work to have those who are
unhappy demean the profession,
themselves, and their col
leagues.
The office staff has had an or
ganization on this campus for 30
years to "promote the fellow
ship and mutual helpfulness of
its members" but has never had
a membership of more than a
fraction of those eligible to join
(and the dues are only three
dollars per year.) A union will
fare no better when it comes to
representation at meetings. Al
ready U.S.E. had had to lower
its quorum to 15 to conduct busi
ness. I don't want people who
try to convince me of the merits
of a union by comparing apples
and bananas dictating the terms
of my position.
Vote no on May 7.
(Mildred Nilsson is a secretary
in industrial engineering.)
Cast vote
We have read the literature
circulated by the union and by
the University and have come to
the following conclusions .
First and foremost — it is vi
tal to vote on May 7 whether you
are for or against the union. If
you are against the union and do
not vote you have given others
the right to decide your job
future.
It would be nice to think that a
union or some other miracle
will guarantee that all man
agers and supervisors would be

perfect, that there would be ac
knowledgement for a job well
done, that a job will be classi
fied at the appropriate level for
the responsibility but at this
point the union has not con
vinced us that this unattainable
goal is attainable if they be
came our spokesman.
It can be hoped that the dis
cussion generated by union ac
tivity might encourage man
agement to look at the super
vision and if need be upgrade the
skilss those managers who need
this assistance. We night all
benefit from such evaluation
with action taken where re
quired.
If after the vote the union has

been accepted — you will be giv
en the opportunity to join or not
to join. You should also re
member that the salary changes
proposed for September will no
longer be applicable. ALL
salaries, benefits and working
conditions become negotiable
once the union has been voted in.
If you join, we believe . . .
You will be part of a group
whose bylaws will be developed
locally but based on the bylaws
of the National and Local 715.
You will be subject to dis
ciplinary action by the union if
required. — You will as a mem
ber vote for your represent
ative. — You will as a member
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will be able to vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — If you wish to file a
grievance, the union must agree
with you and act for you. They
are not required to file your
grievance and you may not file
on your own. — Job reclass
ifications, merit raises and oth
er working conditions will be
governed by union contract. —
If a strike is called — as a mem
ber you may not cross the picket
line. If you choose to do so you
will be subject to union dis
ciplinary action. You will not be
paid. *
If you do not join . . . You may
still be required to pay a "ser
vice fee." This will be at least
equal to the amount of dues
assessed. — You will not vote on
a representative. — You will not
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will not vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — You will not be sub
ject to union rules. — You (in all
probability) would be subject to
dismissal if you refuse to pay
the service fee. The University
will have no option on this. —
You will be subject to the same
grievance procedures as set
forth by the union. — In the
event of a strike you may con
tinue to work and you will con
tinue to be paid.
We can only hope that you all
will consider all the facts and
regardless of your stand, vote
on May 7.

troller's Office, School of

University inaction
Through the distribution of
four "Election Bulletins," the
University has attempted to put
the clerical union in a very
negative light. The emphasis
has been on what the union can't
do for us and, indeed, what it

may adversely do to us. How
ever, I have yet to read about
what the University can and will
do for us so that we don't need a
union.
Also, if the University wants
to bring out the "facts," per
haps it should be mentioned that
the Committee on the Education
and Employment of Women in
the University (C-EEWU) has
been abolished. In Campus Re
port, (Oct. 1, 1980), this com
mittee published a lengthy re
port on clerical dissatisfaction
with their jobs, influenced
largely by a perceived lack of
opportunity for promotion or
mobility.
Other factors, such as lack of
communication with super
visors, lack of staff develop
ment programs, and relatively
low salaries, were also men
tioned. C-EEWU made several
recommendations for improv
ing clerical conditions, with the
hope that they would be serious
ly considered for future study by
the University.
In a note dated Mar. 26, 1981,
Marion E. Smith, C-EEWU
Chairman, stated, "... The C
EEWU was abolished by the
Committee on Committees this
year as being unnecessary." In
light of this, I would appreciate
knowing just how the University
proposes to take such good care
of us that the union is unneces
sary.

Grievances fail
As May 7 approaches, I would
like to pass along two personal
experiences that might be in
formative to the undecided.
The first experience resulted
from a grievance I filed about
three years ago, and in which I
requested an outside hearing of
ficer. In violation of the Univer
sity's grievance procedures,
that officer was denied. As a re
sult, I filed suit before the Supe
rior Court of Santa Clara Coun
ty, asking that the University be
compelled to carry out its griev
ance procedures. Much to my
surprise, the Court ruled that
Stanford's Administration
Guide does not have " ... the
stature of a legally binding con
tract." In other words, not only
is the University not required to
abide by its own leaky grievance
procedures, the University is
not bound by any of the con
tents of that guide, which
touches on such crucial matters
as salaries, promotions, etc.
The second experience re
sulted from another grievance
filed last year. This grievance
was unsuccessful, of course (95
percent of them are). Recourse
was sought through the Equal
Employment Opportunity Com
mission in San Jose. During the
initial stages of the interview,
the commission's represent
ative took the liberty of telling
me, a complainant, that a mem
ber of the University's legal
staff had confessed to him that,
yes, there is racism at Stanford,
but would deny ever having said
it if quoted. I was doubly
startled; first, in the Univer
sity's representative feeling so
comfortable with the com
mission that the statement
could be made to it; second, by
the commission's represent
ative's presumption in relating
this to me, a person seeking the
protection of the commission
After trying to recover from
this confidence-evoking revel
ation, I was later faced with an
other. I signed a complaint with

the commission, of course,
which was sent to the University
for a response. The University's
response to my complaint was
not made available to me, and I
learned that it would not be, un
less permitted by the Univer
sity. It should be needless to say
that the University's counsel re
fused to let me see the response
My concern was that the com
mission could not make an en
lightened ruling on the case un
less exposed to free discussion
of the complaint and the re
sponse, but such was not the
case. Although the courts re
mained as a mechanism for
pursuing the complaint further,
due process should operate in all
agencies as well.
The bottom line is that if an
employee is to obtain fairness at
Stanford, it apparently must be
through a union and not through
administrative guides and gov
ernmental agencies.

Union needed
I would like to express my dis
pleasure with the decision re
garding the hearing of Rita
Mazon. I read the article con
cerning Rita's grievance in the
Daily and based on the facts sur
rounding the case, I feel the
hearing was unjust.
This case is a valid example
of Stanford's "fair" grievance
procedure. As a non-exempt of
fice workers, feel it is at my
best interest to vote for the
union. As we (office staff) stand
now, it is apparent that we have
no voice and whatever man
agement decides is final. Unless
we unite, Stanford will never ac
knowledge our grievances.
I am encouraging all of the
eligible office workers to vote
yes on May 7, union election
day. If you don't vote, don't
complain. Remember, what
happened to Rita could happen
to you. United we stand, divided
we fall.

Salary issue
Recently, the Provost and
Vice President for Business and
Finance circulated Election
Bulletin I to members of the
University Office and Library
Support Staff. It responded to an
issue that had been raised by
USE/Local 715 — namely, com
parative salary ranges for sev
eral classifications of employ
ees at Stanford and the surroun
ding community.
This Bulletin attempted to
put the salary issue into per
spective, and I applaud the at
tempt: the bar chart format
was quite helpful.
It would now be even more
helpful (in making a rational de
cision before the election), if
Provost Albert Hastorf and Mr.
William Massy, Vice President
for Business and Finance, would
now go one step further and
furnish us with the mean and
standard deviation of the salary
distribution, with reference
only to Stanford salaries. To put
it simply, let us know what the
salary spread within each range
looks like. For example, do
more secretary lis earn close to
$1000 or $1350 now? Will more
secretary Ills be earning $1300
or $1750 in September?
This information is pertinent
to the issue raised and will, I
hope, be presented in a forth
coming Bulletin.

Noise effective
A few thoughts follow regard
ing the letter sent to me from
the University dated March 17.
Q. "Why did the University
give the Union my home ad
dress?": This is a ridiculous
question. If you've ever noticed
your home mail as I have, you
would have noticed that you re
ceive tons of junk mail, the
senders of which have in some
cases obtained your private res
idence address from the Univer
sity. I would rather the Union
have my address than Stanford.
I would probably receive less
junk!
Q. "If I signed one of the union
"blue cards" does that mean I
must vote for the Union on May
7? ": I am insulted by the partic
ular "question and answer"
routine. This is the typical at
titude of management that the
backbone of this University, the
clerical people, are so naive and
ignorant that they would arbi
trarily sign something that they
knew nothing about. I signed my
blue card because I believe in
the Union and what it will do for
me. I also believe that Union
considers me a knowledgeable,
intelligent employee who is
aware of the issues involved, not
some dimwit who signs a blue
card because she/he is afraid to
say "NO" to someone.
Then there is all this garbage
about dues, financial fees, etc.
that seems to be a big point with
the University. Of course there
will be certain fees. Of course
the union needs money to run
itself or it wouldn't be a viable
alternative to the employment
practices of the University
(poor pay, misclassification).
Any large group needs a cer
tain amount of financial back
ing, and the dues are a good way
for each member to contribute a
small amount to keep their
bargaining unit functioning. It is
not such a backbreaking
amount, and if the University
would ever look at the past his
tory of Local 715, they would be
very upset to notice that there
probably is no record of "addi
tional financial payments" re
quested of their members. The
USE Chapter of Local 715 has
never levied fees in addition to
dues since they became or
ganized.
Q. "If Local 715 is elected will
I receive higher wages than I
would receive without a
-union?" (Obviously this partic
ular clerical would sign any
thing from anybody). This has
already been answered by the
fact that everytime the union
makes a little noise we get an in
crease. The union pushed for
certain critical issues last year,
and the University rebutted
with a higher increase and addi
tional benefits. Again the union
is making louder noises this
year and again the University is
rebutting with talk of revamp
ing the step sytem and increas
ing wages. I for one am not to
tally convinced that these in
creases would have occurred
without pressure of organizing
from the union.

Issues 'muddied'
The Offices of the Provost
and Vice-President for Business
and Finance have recently
launched a campaign to try to
slow down our unionization
drive. It is very important to
that we each see PrQvost Albert
Hastorf and Vice President for
Business and Finance William
Massy's "education" endeavors
for what they are — poorly re
searched attempts to use their
offices as a means to color our
judgement and muddy the real
issues raised by our continuing
effort to gain a legal and binding
contract with the University.
Recently these two gen
tlemen have sent each of the
clerical staff two such "educa
tional" missives. The first was
sent to us at our homes, and the
second distributed to us at our
job sites. Each of these missives
requires examination.
In the first of these com
munications we were told that
the Union can call a strike if ne
gotiations between our elected
Union representatives and the
University break down. This is a
misconception. The member
ship is polled regarding pro
posed contracts, and our nego
tiators (whom we elect) would
not "call a strike" without a
massive majority vote from the
membership. In short, there
can't be a strike unless we, the
membership, overwhelmingly
vote for one. This letter at
tempted to portray the Union as
some distant third party. In
fact, the Union is each of us.
Hastorf and Massy's "third par
ty" notion falls just short of
being a deliberate misconcep
tion, and is not the sort of re
search that has placed Stanford
in the prestigious position the
University now enjoys.
The second publication from
the Provost and Business and

Finance dealt with comparative
salaries This communication
intimates that Local 715 (our lo
cal when we win the election)
has not gained much for the
clerical units the Local repre
sents in San Mateo County,
Redwood City. Palo Alto and
Santa Gara counties. This is in
ferred via several graphs com
paring the present and proposed
salaries from these cities and
counties with Stanford's present
and proposed salary ranges.
Hastorf and Massy have asked
us to compare apples and or
anges because they are fruit in
this instance. The salaries listed
that are under contract from the
cities and counties are those of
public sector employers, and
Stanford is a private sector em
ployer. Traditionally the public
sector is under more stringent
budgetary restraint than is the
private sector. These gen
tlemen have failed to compare
Stanford's salary ranges with
those of other private em
ployers who are under contract.
The job classifications which
were compared (i.e., "Account
ing Assistant I") were not
carefully researched, if they
were researched at all. The
stated classificatin of, for in
stance, the "Acct. Clk I" gave
Stanford's salary as $965 -$1050
In truth. Santa Clara's real
equivalent job classification re
ceives $1048 — $1268. This repre
sents an error made by Hastorf
and Massy to the tune of some
$200 per month.
Additionally, these two gen
tlemen include in their quota
tions of Stanford's salaries the
merit zone figures. If we ex
amine their graphs for Stanford
we can easily see that the merit
zone salary figures account for
one-hcilf (the top half) of the
University salary figures. It
should be mentioned that once
an employee reaches the merit
zone area, it is entirely up to
his/her supervisor whether s/he
will ever receive any of that
amount.
There is no guarantee that
any of us will receive one penny
once we enter the merit zone.
This is one of the points which
many of the clerical staff want
to see addressed via contractual
bargaining. Without a contract
which is legal and binding, we
have no assurances that Stan
ford will give us the announced
pay raises.
A historical perspective on
traditional attitudes Stanford's

We all have a job to do which

years to "promote the fellow

a membership of more than a

Cast vote
We have read the literature
circulated by the union and by
the University and have come to
the following conclusions .
First and foremost — it is vi
tal to vote on May 7 whether you
are for or against the union. If
you are against the union and do
not vote you have given others
the right to decide your job
future.
It would be nice to think that a
union or some other miracle
will guarantee that all man
agers and supervisors would be

perfect, that there would be ac
knowledgement for a job well
done, that a job will be classi
fied at the appropriate level for
the responsibility but at this
point the union has not con
vinced us that this unattainable
goal is attainable if they be
came our spokesman.
It can be hoped that the dis
cussion generated by union ac
tivity might encourage man
agement to look at the super
vision and if need be upgrade the
skilss those managers who need
this assistance. We night all
benefit from such evaluation
with action taken where re
quired.
If after the vote the union has

been accepted — you will be giv
en the opportunity to join or not
to join. You should also re
member that the salary changes
proposed for September will no
longer be applicable. ALL
salaries, benefits and working
conditions become negotiable
once the union has been voted in.
If you join, we believe . . .
You will be part of a group
whose bylaws will be developed
locally but based on the bylaws
of the National and Local 715.
You will be subject to dis
ciplinary action by the union if
required. — You will as a mem
ber vote for your represent

vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will be able to vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — If you wish to file a
grievance, the union must agree
with you and act for you. They
are not required to file your
grievance and you may not file
on your own. — Job reclass
ifications, merit raises and oth
er working conditions will be
governed by union contract. —
If a strike is called — as a mem
ber you may not cross the picket
line. If you choose to do so you
will be subject to union dis
ciplinary action. You will not be
paid. *
If you do not join . . . You may
still be required to pay a "ser
vice fee." This will be at least
equal to the amount of dues
assessed. — You will not vote on
a representative. — You will not
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will not vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — You will not be sub
ject to union rules. — You (in all
probability) would be subject to
dismissal if you refuse to pay
the service fee. The University
will have no option on this. —
You will be subject to the same
grievance procedures as set
forth by the union. — In the
event of a strike you may con
tinue to work and you will con
tinue to be paid.
We can only hope that you all
will consider all the facts and
regardless of your stand, vote
on May 7.

University inaction
Through the distribution of
four "Election Bulletins," the
University has attempted to put
the clerical union in a very
negative light. The emphasis
has been on what the union can't
do for us and, indeed, what it

may adversely do to us. How
ever, I have yet to read about
what the University can and will
do for us so that we don't need a
union.
Also, if the University wants
to bring out the "facts," per
haps it should be mentioned that
the Committee on the Education
and Employment of Women in
the University (C-EEWU) has
been abolished. In Campus Re
port, (Oct. 1, 1980), this com
mittee published a lengthy re
port on clerical dissatisfaction
with their jobs, influenced
largely by a perceived lack of
opportunity for promotion or
mobility.
Other factors, such as lack of
communication with super
visors, lack of staff develop
ment programs, and relatively
low salaries, were also men
tioned. C-EEWU made several
recommendations for improv
ing clerical conditions, with the
hope that they would be serious
ly considered for future study by
the University.
In a note dated Mar. 26, 1981,
Marion E. Smith, C-EEWU
Chairman, stated, "... The C
EEWU was abolished by the
Committee on Committees this
year as being unnecessary." In
light of this, I would appreciate
knowing just how the University
proposes to take such good care
of us that the union is unneces
sary.

Grievances fail
As May 7 approaches, I would
like to pass along two personal
experiences that might be in
formative to the undecided.
The first experience resulted
from a grievance I filed about
three years ago, and in which I
requested an outside hearing of
ficer. In violation of the Univer
sity's grievance procedures,
that officer was denied. As a re
sult, I filed suit before the Supe
rior Court of Santa Clara Coun
ty, asking that the University be
compelled to carry out its griev
ance procedures. Much to my
surprise, the Court ruled that
Stanford's Administration
Guide does not have " ... the
stature of a legally binding con
tract." In other words, not only
is the University not required to
abide by its own leaky grievance
procedures, the University is
not bound by any of the con
tents of that guide, which
touches on such crucial matters
as salaries, promotions, etc.
The second experience re
sulted from another grievance
filed last year. This grievance
was unsuccessful, of course (95
percent of them are). Recourse
was sought through the Equal
Employment Opportunity Com
mission in San Jose. During the
initial stages of the interview,
the commission's represent
ative took the liberty of telling
me, a complainant, that a mem
ber of the University's legal
staff had confessed to him that,
yes, there is racism at Stanford,
but would deny ever having said
it if quoted. I was doubly
startled; first, in the Univer
sity's representative feeling so
comfortable with the com
mission that the statement
could be made to it; second, by
the commission's represent
ative's presumption in relating
this to me, a person seeking the
protection of the commission
After trying to recover from
this confidence-evoking revel
ation, I was later faced with an
other. I signed a complaint with

the commission, of course,
which was sent to the University
for a response. The University's
response to my complaint was
not made available to me, and I
learned that it would not be, un
less permitted by the Univer
sity. It should be needless to say
that the University's counsel re
fused to let me see the response
My concern was that the com
mission could not make an en
lightened ruling on the case un
less exposed to free discussion
of the complaint and the re
sponse, but such was not the
case. Although the courts re
mained as a mechanism for
pursuing the complaint further,
due process should operate in all
agencies as well.
The bottom line is that if an
employee is to obtain fairness at
Stanford, it apparently must be
through a union and not through
administrative guides and gov
ernmental agencies.

Union needed
I would like to express my dis
pleasure with the decision re
garding the hearing of Rita
Mazon. I read the article con
cerning Rita's grievance in the
Daily and based on the facts sur
rounding the case, I feel the
hearing was unjust.
This case is a valid example
of Stanford's "fair" grievance
procedure. As a non-exempt of
fice workers, feel it is at my
best interest to vote for the
union. As we (office staff) stand
now, it is apparent that we have
no voice and whatever man
agement decides is final. Unless
we unite, Stanford will never ac
knowledge our grievances.
I am encouraging all of the
eligible office workers to vote
yes on May 7, union election
day. If you don't vote, don't
complain. Remember, what
happened to Rita could happen
to you. United we stand, divided
we fall.

Salary issue
Recently, the Provost and
Vice President for Business and
Finance circulated Election
Bulletin I to members of the
University Office and Library
Support Staff. It responded to an
issue that had been raised by
USE/Local 715 — namely, com
parative salary ranges for sev
eral classifications of employ
ees at Stanford and the surroun
ding community.
This Bulletin attempted to
put the salary issue into per
spective, and I applaud the at
tempt: the bar chart format
was quite helpful.
It would now be even more
helpful (in making a rational de
cision before the election), if
Provost Albert Hastorf and Mr.
William Massy, Vice President
for Business and Finance, would
now go one step further and
furnish us with the mean and
standard deviation of the salary
distribution, with reference
only to Stanford salaries. To put
it simply, let us know what the
salary spread within each range
looks like. For example, do
more secretary lis earn close to
$1000 or $1350 now? Will more
secretary Ills be earning $1300
or $1750 in September?
This information is pertinent
to the issue raised and will, I
hope, be presented in a forth
coming Bulletin.

Noise effective
A few thoughts follow regard
ing the letter sent to me from
the University dated March 17.
Q. "Why did the University
give the Union my home ad
dress?": This is a ridiculous
question. If you've ever noticed
your home mail as I have, you
would have noticed that you re
ceive tons of junk mail, the
senders of which have in some
cases obtained your private res
idence address from the Univer
sity. I would rather the Union
have my address than Stanford.
I would probably receive less
junk!
Q. "If I signed one of the union
"blue cards" does that mean I
must vote for the Union on May
7? ": I am insulted by the partic
ular "question and answer"
routine. This is the typical at
titude of management that the
backbone of this University, the
clerical people, are so naive and
ignorant that they would arbi
trarily sign something that they
knew nothing about. I signed my
blue card because I believe in
the Union and what it will do for
me. I also believe that Union
considers me a knowledgeable,
intelligent employee who is
aware of the issues involved, not
some dimwit who signs a blue
card because she/he is afraid to
say "NO" to someone.
Then there is all this garbage
about dues, financial fees, etc.
that seems to be a big point with
the University. Of course there
will be certain fees. Of course
the union needs money to run
itself or it wouldn't be a viable
alternative to the employment
practices of the University
(poor pay, misclassification).
Any large group needs a cer
tain amount of financial back
ing, and the dues are a good way
for each member to contribute a
small amount to keep their
bargaining unit functioning. It is
not such a backbreaking
amount, and if the University
would ever look at the past his
tory of Local 715, they would be
very upset to notice that there
probably is no record of "addi
tional financial payments" re
quested of their members. The
USE Chapter of Local 715 has
never levied fees in addition to
dues since they became or
ganized.
Q. "If Local 715 is elected will
I receive higher wages than I
would receive without a
-union?" (Obviously this partic
ular clerical would sign any
thing from anybody). This has
already been answered by the
fact that everytime the union
makes a little noise we get an in
crease. The union pushed for
certain critical issues last year,
and the University rebutted
with a higher increase and addi
tional benefits. Again the union
is making louder noises this
year and again the University is
rebutting with talk of revamp
ing the step sytem and increas
ing wages. I for one am not to
tally convinced that these in
creases would have occurred
without pressure of organizing
from the union.

Issues 'muddied'
The Offices of the Provost
and Vice-President for Business
and Finance have recently
launched a campaign to try to
slow down our unionization
drive. It is very important to
that we each see PrQvost Albert
Hastorf and Vice President for
Business and Finance William
Massy's "education" endeavors
for what they are — poorly re
searched attempts to use their
offices as a means to color our
judgement and muddy the real
issues raised by our continuing
effort to gain a legal and binding
contract with the University.
Recently these two gen
tlemen have sent each of the
clerical staff two such "educa
tional" missives. The first was
sent to us at our homes, and the
second distributed to us at our
job sites. Each of these missives
requires examination.
In the first of these com
munications we were told that
the Union can call a strike if ne
gotiations between our elected
Union representatives and the
University break down. This is a
misconception. The member
ship is polled regarding pro
posed contracts, and our nego
tiators (whom we elect) would
not "call a strike" without a
massive majority vote from the
membership. In short, there
can't be a strike unless we, the
membership, overwhelmingly
vote for one. This letter at
tempted to portray the Union as
some distant third party. In
fact, the Union is each of us.
Hastorf and Massy's "third par
ty" notion falls just short of
being a deliberate misconcep
tion, and is not the sort of re
search that has placed Stanford
in the prestigious position the
University now enjoys.
The second publication from
the Provost and Business and

Finance dealt with comparative
salaries This communication
intimates that Local 715 (our lo
cal when we win the election)
has not gained much for the
clerical units the Local repre
sents in San Mateo County,
Redwood City. Palo Alto and
Santa Gara counties. This is in
ferred via several graphs com
paring the present and proposed
salaries from these cities and
counties with Stanford's present
and proposed salary ranges.
Hastorf and Massy have asked
us to compare apples and or
anges because they are fruit in
this instance. The salaries listed
that are under contract from the
cities and counties are those of
public sector employers, and
Stanford is a private sector em
ployer. Traditionally the public
sector is under more stringent
budgetary restraint than is the
private sector. These gen
tlemen have failed to compare
Stanford's salary ranges with
those of other private em
ployers who are under contract.
The job classifications which
were compared (i.e., "Account
ing Assistant I") were not
carefully researched, if they
were researched at all. The
stated classificatin of, for in
stance, the "Acct. Clk I" gave
Stanford's salary as $965 -$1050
In truth. Santa Clara's real
equivalent job classification re
ceives $1048 — $1268. This repre
sents an error made by Hastorf
and Massy to the tune of some
$200 per month.
Additionally, these two gen
tlemen include in their quota
tions of Stanford's salaries the
merit zone figures. If we ex
amine their graphs for Stanford
we can easily see that the merit
zone salary figures account for
one-hcilf (the top half) of the
University salary figures. It
should be mentioned that once
an employee reaches the merit
zone area, it is entirely up to
his/her supervisor whether s/he
will ever receive any of that
amount.
There is no guarantee that
any of us will receive one penny
once we enter the merit zone.
This is one of the points which
many of the clerical staff want
to see addressed via contractual
bargaining. Without a contract
which is legal and binding, we
have no assurances that Stan
ford will give us the announced
pay raises.
A historical perspective on
traditional attitudes Stanford's
management has held is in or
der when reviewing these two
communications from Hastorf
and Massy. These letters were
brought to us by the folks who.
two years ago, gave us a 6.5 per
cent cost-of-living increase in
the face of double-digit infla
tion! Clearly, management was
unconcerned about our welfare
then, but that was before we
began to organize. These
"educational" attempts are
brought to us by the folks who.
that same year, took one week
of vacation away from new em
ployees. Had we had a contract
at that point, management
would have not been able to pull
a stunt like that.
These "communications" are
brought to us by the folks who,
when our blue-card drive was in
full swing last year, suddenly
announced their "concern" for
us with a 10 percent cost-of-liv
ing increase in an effort to abort
our unionization drive. The folks
who, seeing our determination,
became concerned enough to of
fer us the recently quoted salary
increases while saying that the
increases were due to a "1978
study." If this is so, why were
the increases not implemented
in 1978? Did we need such in
creases any less then, or was the
outmoded steps system any less
effective then? Clearly not.
What has changed, however, is
that we of the clerical and li
brary staff have shown our
force and our intention, and
Hastorf and Massy have
responded with last-minute ef
forts to appease us in hopes that
the spector of the Union would
go away.
We of the clerical and library
staff are not unreasonable
rowdies bent on the destruction
of the system. We are well
educated people who enjoy
working for Stanford. We come
from the same sorts of back
grounds that Hastorf and Massy
come from. We are, however,
dedicated to the notion that we
are intelligent human beings
who want a hand and a voice in
our futures, and who want to be
considered as professionals who
do our jobs very well, rather
than being considered "the
girl."
We found that asking for these
considerations without the
backing of an organization got
us nowhere. We then preceded
to the next obvious step — that
of unionization. We believe that
our services for the University
entitle us to decent wages and
working conditions We feel en
titled to adequate grievance
procedures. And we can't help
wondering why our requests are
met with such suspicion and dis

trust by Hastorf and Massy.
Lyn Sims
Chemistry Department
Unions ineffective
We have been bombared with
articles in the various campus
publications and by OSOC news
letters telling us why we should
have a union. Before we cast our
ballots we need facts in order to
make an intelligent decision.
I should like to state here that
the facts presented below are
the results of 40 years' secretar
ial experience, 19 of which have
been on the Stanford campus,
and a lot of homework on the
current clerical scene in several

of the large prestigious in
dustrial firms here on the penin
sula.
Stanford is not unique in its
shortage of qualified clerical
help. Unions do not provide
properly trained clerical staff
and a union is not going to solve
the problems here. Industrial
affiliates of the Department of
Industrial Engineering report
that unions are now beginning to
accept the fact that they are no
longer effective agents in ob
taining solutions to problems
encountered in the working
world.
To address specifics — the
"low" salaries at Stanford as a
reason for a union. A com
parison with the salaries of four
of the most prestigious firms
here on the peninsula to the ex
tent they were made available
revealed that Stanford salaries
matched and in some cases,
were even better. Now I had
been wondering why, if the
salaries at Stanford were so
much lower, the agitators for
higher salaries did not flock to
take advantage of the openings
in these firms — the results of
the comparison are the answer.
If they remain because they pre
fer the academic environment,
then they must be willing to
make a trade-off.
Service organizations cannot
compete salary-wise with firms
producing end products for prof
it and union dues will only
shrink our take-home pay even
further without any guaranteed
benefits! And it is really absurd
to compare the salaries of sec
retaries and lab technicians as
was done in a recent edition of
the OSOC News!
Where will you get two weeks
paid vacation the first year you
work plus 12 days sick leave, or
where will you get bereavement
leave without having it charged
to vacation leave, or more than
three weeks vacation a year?
Other benefits offered by var
ious employers must also be
carefully compared. It has been
argued that the dental plan was
implemented to forestall
unionization but investigation
revealed that dental plans were
being scrutinized for implemen
tation for at least two years
prior to Sept. 1, 1980 You cer
tainly will not get tuition schol
arships from any industrial
firm. Stock options and profit
sharing cannot be compared
with tuition scholarships, albeit
not everyone has children to
take advantage of this privilege,
but one of the reasons given for
demanding higher salaries was
to cope with the increased costs

of raising children, of which the
cost of education plays a major
part. This is having $3000 plus
added to your salary without
having to pay tax on it. Stock op
tions and profit sharing have
proved risky indeed to the em
ployees of firms with these
"benefits."
Plans are now being eval
uated to update retirement ben
efits so that upcoming retirees
will fare better.
Those of the clerical staff of
this university who have such a
low opinion of the occupation
and themselves should re-ex
amine the reasons why they
chose clerical work and Stan
ford in the first place. There is

no problem that the right person
in the admnistration will not ad
dress. It may take a few phone
calls but one will learn a lot
about Stanford, who to contact
for what, and discover a lot of
friends you didn't know you had.
The esprit is not as evident as it
once was due to the increase in
size of all departments and the
rapidity with which new pro
grams have to be implemented
and old ones constantly updated
in order to keep step with busi
ness and industry, but it is there
is one makes the effort to identi
fy with the University and the
opportunities it offers.
We all have a job to do which
carries responsibilities as well
as compensations and ev
erything cannot be done at once
either in our own personal lives
nor in the organization of which
we are a part to solve problems
which arise. We should not ex
pect the responsibilities for our

too soul-destroying to those who
have trained properly and
worked patiently to be darned
good secretaries who enjoy
their work to have those who are
unhappy demean the profession,

ganization on this campus for 30

me, a complainant, that a mem

yes, there is racism at Stanford,
but would deny ever having said
it if quoted. I was doubly
startled; first, in the Univer
sity's representative feeling so
comfortable with the com
mission that the statement
could be made to it; second, by
the commission's represent

this to me, a person seeking the

the commission, of course,
which was sent to the University
for a response. The University's

not made available to me, and I
learned that it would not be, un
less permitted by the Univer

that the University's counsel re

My concern was that the com

Salary issue

Noise effective
A few thoughts follow regard
ing the letter sent to me from
the University dated March 17.
Q. "Why did the University
give the Union my home ad
dress?": This is a ridiculous
question. If you've ever noticed
your home mail as I have, you
would have noticed that you re
ceive tons of junk mail, the
senders of which have in some
cases obtained your private res
idence address from the Univer
sity. I would rather the Union
have my address than Stanford.
I would probably receive less
junk!
Q. "If I signed one of the union
"blue cards" does that mean I
must vote for the Union on May
7? ": I am insulted by the partic
ular "question and answer"
routine. This is the typical at
titude of management that the
backbone of this University, the
clerical people, are so naive and
ignorant that they would arbi
trarily sign something that they
knew nothing about. I signed my
blue card because I believe in
the Union and what it will do for
me. I also believe that Union
considers me a knowledgeable,
intelligent employee who is
aware of the issues involved, not
some dimwit who signs a blue
card because she/he is afraid to
say "NO" to someone.
Then there is all this garbage
about dues, financial fees, etc.
that seems to be a big point with
the University. Of course there
will be certain fees. Of course
the union needs money to run
itself or it wouldn't be a viable
alternative to the employment
practices of the University
(poor pay, misclassification).
Any large group needs a cer
tain amount of financial back
ing, and the dues are a good way
for each member to contribute a
small amount to keep their
bargaining unit functioning. It is
not such a backbreaking
amount, and if the University
would ever look at the past his
tory of Local 715, they would be
very upset to notice that there
probably is no record of "addi
tional financial payments" re
quested of their members. The
USE Chapter of Local 715 has
never levied fees in addition to
dues since they became or
ganized.
Q. "If Local 715 is elected will
I receive higher wages than I
would receive without a
-union?" (Obviously this partic
ular clerical would sign any
thing from anybody). This has
already been answered by the
fact that everytime the union
makes a little noise we get an in
crease. The union pushed for
certain critical issues last year,
and the University rebutted
with a higher increase and addi
tional benefits. Again the union
is making louder noises this
year and again the University is
rebutting with talk of revamp
ing the step sytem and increas
ing wages. I for one am not to
tally convinced that these in
creases would have occurred
without pressure of organizing
from the union.

Issues 'muddied'
The Offices of the Provost
and Vice-President for Business
and Finance have recently
launched a campaign to try to
slow down our unionization
drive. It is very important to
that we each see PrQvost Albert
Hastorf and Vice President for
Business and Finance William
Massy's "education" endeavors
for what they are — poorly re
searched attempts to use their
offices as a means to color our
judgement and muddy the real
issues raised by our continuing
effort to gain a legal and binding
contract with the University.
Recently these two gen
tlemen have sent each of the
clerical staff two such "educa
tional" missives. The first was
sent to us at our homes, and the
second distributed to us at our
job sites. Each of these missives
requires examination.
In the first of these com
munications we were told that
the Union can call a strike if ne
gotiations between our elected
Union representatives and the
University break down. This is a
misconception. The member
ship is polled regarding pro
posed contracts, and our nego
tiators (whom we elect) would
not "call a strike" without a
massive majority vote from the
membership. In short, there
can't be a strike unless we, the
membership, overwhelmingly
vote for one. This letter at
tempted to portray the Union as
some distant third party. In
fact, the Union is each of us.
Hastorf and Massy's "third par
ty" notion falls just short of
being a deliberate misconcep
tion, and is not the sort of re
search that has placed Stanford
in the prestigious position the
University now enjoys.
The second publication from
the Provost and Business and

Finance dealt with comparative
salaries This communication
intimates that Local 715 (our lo
cal when we win the election)
has not gained much for the
clerical units the Local repre
sents in San Mateo County,
Redwood City. Palo Alto and
Santa Gara counties. This is in
ferred via several graphs com
paring the present and proposed
salaries from these cities and
counties with Stanford's present
and proposed salary ranges.
Hastorf and Massy have asked
us to compare apples and or
anges because they are fruit in
this instance. The salaries listed
that are under contract from the
cities and counties are those of
public sector employers, and
Stanford is a private sector em
ployer. Traditionally the public
sector is under more stringent
budgetary restraint than is the
private sector. These gen
tlemen have failed to compare
Stanford's salary ranges with
those of other private em
ployers who are under contract.
The job classifications which
were compared (i.e., "Account
ing Assistant I") were not
carefully researched, if they
were researched at all. The
stated classificatin of, for in
stance, the "Acct. Clk I" gave
Stanford's salary as $965 -$1050
In truth. Santa Clara's real
equivalent job classification re
ceives $1048 — $1268. This repre
sents an error made by Hastorf
and Massy to the tune of some
$200 per month.
Additionally, these two gen
tlemen include in their quota
tions of Stanford's salaries the
merit zone figures. If we ex
amine their graphs for Stanford
we can easily see that the merit
zone salary figures account for
one-hcilf (the top half) of the
University salary figures. It
should be mentioned that once
an employee reaches the merit
zone area, it is entirely up to
his/her supervisor whether s/he
will ever receive any of that
amount.
There is no guarantee that
any of us will receive one penny
once we enter the merit zone.
This is one of the points which
many of the clerical staff want
to see addressed via contractual
bargaining. Without a contract
which is legal and binding, we
have no assurances that Stan
ford will give us the announced
pay raises.
A historical perspective on
traditional attitudes Stanford's
management has held is in or
der when reviewing these two
communications from Hastorf
and Massy. These letters were
brought to us by the folks who.
two years ago, gave us a 6.5 per
cent cost-of-living increase in
the face of double-digit infla
tion! Clearly, management was
unconcerned about our welfare
then, but that was before we
began to organize. These
"educational" attempts are
brought to us by the folks who.
that same year, took one week
of vacation away from new em
ployees. Had we had a contract
at that point, management
would have not been able to pull
a stunt like that.
These "communications" are
brought to us by the folks who,
when our blue-card drive was in
full swing last year, suddenly
announced their "concern" for
us with a 10 percent cost-of-liv
ing increase in an effort to abort
our unionization drive. The folks
who, seeing our determination,
became concerned enough to of
fer us the recently quoted salary
increases while saying that the
increases were due to a "1978
study." If this is so, why were
the increases not implemented
in 1978? Did we need such in
creases any less then, or was the
outmoded steps system any less
effective then? Clearly not.
What has changed, however, is
that we of the clerical and li
brary staff have shown our
force and our intention, and
Hastorf and Massy have
responded with last-minute ef
forts to appease us in hopes that
the spector of the Union would
go away.
We of the clerical and library
staff are not unreasonable
rowdies bent on the destruction
of the system. We are well
educated people who enjoy
working for Stanford. We come
from the same sorts of back
grounds that Hastorf and Massy
come from. We are, however,
dedicated to the notion that we
are intelligent human beings
who want a hand and a voice in
our futures, and who want to be
considered as professionals who
do our jobs very well, rather
than being considered "the
girl."
We found that asking for these
considerations without the
backing of an organization got
us nowhere. We then preceded
to the next obvious step — that
of unionization. We believe that
our services for the University
entitle us to decent wages and
working conditions We feel en
titled to adequate grievance
procedures. And we can't help
wondering why our requests are
met with such suspicion and dis

trust by Hastorf and Massy.
Lyn Sims
Chemistry Department
Unions ineffective
We have been bombared with
articles in the various campus
publications and by OSOC news
letters telling us why we should
have a union. Before we cast our
ballots we need facts in order to
make an intelligent decision.
I should like to state here that
the facts presented below are
the results of 40 years' secretar
ial experience, 19 of which have
been on the Stanford campus,
and a lot of homework on the
current clerical scene in several

of the large prestigious in
dustrial firms here on the penin
sula.
Stanford is not unique in its
shortage of qualified clerical
help. Unions do not provide
properly trained clerical staff
and a union is not going to solve
the problems here. Industrial
affiliates of the Department of
Industrial Engineering report
that unions are now beginning to
accept the fact that they are no
longer effective agents in ob
taining solutions to problems
encountered in the working
world.
To address specifics — the
"low" salaries at Stanford as a
reason for a union. A com
parison with the salaries of four
of the most prestigious firms
here on the peninsula to the ex
tent they were made available
revealed that Stanford salaries
matched and in some cases,
were even better. Now I had
been wondering why, if the
salaries at Stanford were so
much lower, the agitators for
higher salaries did not flock to
take advantage of the openings
in these firms — the results of
the comparison are the answer.
If they remain because they pre
fer the academic environment,
then they must be willing to
make a trade-off.
Service organizations cannot
compete salary-wise with firms
producing end products for prof
it and union dues will only
shrink our take-home pay even
further without any guaranteed
benefits! And it is really absurd
to compare the salaries of sec
retaries and lab technicians as
was done in a recent edition of
the OSOC News!
Where will you get two weeks
paid vacation the first year you
work plus 12 days sick leave, or
where will you get bereavement
leave without having it charged
to vacation leave, or more than
three weeks vacation a year?
Other benefits offered by var
ious employers must also be
carefully compared. It has been
argued that the dental plan was
implemented to forestall
unionization but investigation
revealed that dental plans were
being scrutinized for implemen
tation for at least two years
prior to Sept. 1, 1980 You cer
tainly will not get tuition schol
arships from any industrial
firm. Stock options and profit
sharing cannot be compared
with tuition scholarships, albeit
not everyone has children to
take advantage of this privilege,
but one of the reasons given for
demanding higher salaries was
to cope with the increased costs

of raising children, of which the
cost of education plays a major
part. This is having $3000 plus
added to your salary without
having to pay tax on it. Stock op
tions and profit sharing have
proved risky indeed to the em
ployees of firms with these
"benefits."
Plans are now being eval
uated to update retirement ben
efits so that upcoming retirees
will fare better.
Those of the clerical staff of
this university who have such a
low opinion of the occupation
and themselves should re-ex
amine the reasons why they
chose clerical work and Stan
ford in the first place. There is

no problem that the right person
in the admnistration will not ad
dress. It may take a few phone
calls but one will learn a lot
about Stanford, who to contact
for what, and discover a lot of
friends you didn't know you had.
The esprit is not as evident as it
once was due to the increase in
size of all departments and the
rapidity with which new pro
grams have to be implemented
and old ones constantly updated
in order to keep step with busi
ness and industry, but it is there
is one makes the effort to identi
fy with the University and the
opportunities it offers.
We all have a job to do which
carries responsibilities as well
as compensations and ev
erything cannot be done at once
either in our own personal lives
nor in the organization of which
we are a part to solve problems
which arise. We should not ex
pect the responsibilities for our
individual well-being to be as
sumed by an organization. It is
too soul-destroying to those who
have trained properly and
worked patiently to be darned
good secretaries who enjoy
their work to have those who are
unhappy demean the profession,
themselves, and their col
leagues.
The office staff has had an or
ganization on this campus for 30
years to "promote the fellow
ship and mutual helpfulness of
its members" but has never had
a membership of more than a
fraction of those eligible to join
(and the dues are only three
dollars per year.) A union will
fare no better when it comes to
representation at meetings. Al
ready U.S.E. had had to lower
its quorum to 15 to conduct busi
ness. I don't want people who
try to convince me of the merits
of a union by comparing apples
and bananas dictating the terms
of my position.
Vote no on May 7.
(Mildred Nilsson is a secretary
in industrial engineering.)
Cast vote
We have read the literature
circulated by the union and by
the University and have come to
the following conclusions .
First and foremost — it is vi
tal to vote on May 7 whether you
are for or against the union. If
you are against the union and do
not vote you have given others
the right to decide your job
future.
It would be nice to think that a
union or some other miracle
will guarantee that all man
agers and supervisors would be

perfect, that there would be ac
knowledgement for a job well
done, that a job will be classi
fied at the appropriate level for
the responsibility but at this
point the union has not con
vinced us that this unattainable
goal is attainable if they be
came our spokesman.
It can be hoped that the dis
cussion generated by union ac
tivity might encourage man
agement to look at the super
vision and if need be upgrade the
skilss those managers who need
this assistance. We night all
benefit from such evaluation
with action taken where re
quired.
If after the vote the union has

been accepted — you will be giv
en the opportunity to join or not
to join. You should also re
member that the salary changes
proposed for September will no
longer be applicable. ALL
salaries, benefits and working
conditions become negotiable
once the union has been voted in.
If you join, we believe . . .
You will be part of a group
whose bylaws will be developed
locally but based on the bylaws
of the National and Local 715.
You will be subject to dis
ciplinary action by the union if
required. — You will as a mem
ber vote for your represent
ative. — You will as a member
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will be able to vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — If you wish to file a
grievance, the union must agree
with you and act for you. They
are not required to file your
grievance and you may not file
on your own. — Job reclass
ifications, merit raises and oth
er working conditions will be
governed by union contract. —
If a strike is called — as a mem
ber you may not cross the picket
line. If you choose to do so you
will be subject to union dis
ciplinary action. You will not be
paid. *
If you do not join . . . You may
still be required to pay a "ser
vice fee." This will be at least
equal to the amount of dues
assessed. — You will not vote on
a representative. — You will not
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will not vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — You will not be sub
ject to union rules. — You (in all
probability) would be subject to
dismissal if you refuse to pay
the service fee. The University
will have no option on this. —
You will be subject to the same
grievance procedures as set
forth by the union. — In the
event of a strike you may con
tinue to work and you will con
tinue to be paid.
We can only hope that you all
will consider all the facts and
regardless of your stand, vote
on May 7.

troller's Office, School of
Education and Office of De
velopment.)
University inaction
Through the distribution of
four "Election Bulletins," the
University has attempted to put
the clerical union in a very
negative light. The emphasis
has been on what the union can't
do for us and, indeed, what it

may adversely do to us. How
ever, I have yet to read about
what the University can and will
do for us so that we don't need a
union.
Also, if the University wants
to bring out the "facts," per
haps it should be mentioned that
the Committee on the Education
and Employment of Women in
the University (C-EEWU) has
been abolished. In Campus Re
port, (Oct. 1, 1980), this com
mittee published a lengthy re
port on clerical dissatisfaction
with their jobs, influenced
largely by a perceived lack of
opportunity for promotion or
mobility.
Other factors, such as lack of
communication with super
visors, lack of staff develop
ment programs, and relatively
low salaries, were also men
tioned. C-EEWU made several
recommendations for improv
ing clerical conditions, with the
hope that they would be serious
ly considered for future study by
the University.
In a note dated Mar. 26, 1981,
Marion E. Smith, C-EEWU
Chairman, stated, "... The C
EEWU was abolished by the
Committee on Committees this
year as being unnecessary." In
light of this, I would appreciate
knowing just how the University
proposes to take such good care
of us that the union is unneces
sary.

Grievances fail
As May 7 approaches, I would
like to pass along two personal
experiences that might be in
formative to the undecided.
The first experience resulted
from a grievance I filed about
three years ago, and in which I
requested an outside hearing of
ficer. In violation of the Univer
sity's grievance procedures,
that officer was denied. As a re
sult, I filed suit before the Supe

Stanford's Administration

quested of their members. The
USE Chapter of Local 715 has
never levied fees in addition to
dues since they became or
ganized.
Q. "If Local 715 is elected will
I receive higher wages than I
would receive without a
-union?" (Obviously this partic
ular clerical would sign any
thing from anybody). This has
already been answered by the
fact that everytime the union
makes a little noise we get an in
crease. The union pushed for
certain critical issues last year,
and the University rebutted
with a higher increase and addi
tional benefits. Again the union
is making louder noises this
year and again the University is
rebutting with talk of revamp
ing the step sytem and increas
ing wages. I for one am not to
tally convinced that these in
creases would have occurred
without pressure of organizing
from the union.

Issues 'muddied'
The Offices of the Provost
and Vice-President for Business
and Finance have recently
launched a campaign to try to
slow down our unionization
drive. It is very important to
that we each see PrQvost Albert
Hastorf and Vice President for
Business and Finance William
Massy's "education" endeavors
for what they are — poorly re
searched attempts to use their
offices as a means to color our
judgement and muddy the real
issues raised by our continuing
effort to gain a legal and binding
contract with the University.
Recently these two gen
tlemen have sent each of the
clerical staff two such "educa
tional" missives. The first was
sent to us at our homes, and the
second distributed to us at our
job sites. Each of these missives
requires examination.
In the first of these com
munications we were told that
the Union can call a strike if ne
gotiations between our elected
Union representatives and the
University break down. This is a
misconception. The member
ship is polled regarding pro
posed contracts, and our nego
tiators (whom we elect) would
not "call a strike" without a
massive majority vote from the
membership. In short, there
can't be a strike unless we, the
membership, overwhelmingly
vote for one. This letter at
tempted to portray the Union as
some distant third party. In
fact, the Union is each of us.
Hastorf and Massy's "third par
ty" notion falls just short of
being a deliberate misconcep
tion, and is not the sort of re
search that has placed Stanford
in the prestigious position the
University now enjoys.
The second publication from
the Provost and Business and

Finance dealt with comparative
salaries This communication
intimates that Local 715 (our lo
cal when we win the election)
has not gained much for the
clerical units the Local repre
sents in San Mateo County,
Redwood City. Palo Alto and
Santa Gara counties. This is in
ferred via several graphs com
paring the present and proposed
salaries from these cities and
counties with Stanford's present
and proposed salary ranges.
Hastorf and Massy have asked
us to compare apples and or
anges because they are fruit in
this instance. The salaries listed
that are under contract from the
cities and counties are those of
public sector employers, and
Stanford is a private sector em
ployer. Traditionally the public
sector is under more stringent
budgetary restraint than is the
private sector. These gen
tlemen have failed to compare
Stanford's salary ranges with
those of other private em
ployers who are under contract.
The job classifications which
were compared (i.e., "Account
ing Assistant I") were not
carefully researched, if they
were researched at all. The
stated classificatin of, for in
stance, the "Acct. Clk I" gave
Stanford's salary as $965 -$1050
In truth. Santa Clara's real
equivalent job classification re
ceives $1048 — $1268. This repre
sents an error made by Hastorf
and Massy to the tune of some
$200 per month.
Additionally, these two gen
tlemen include in their quota
tions of Stanford's salaries the
merit zone figures. If we ex
amine their graphs for Stanford
we can easily see that the merit
zone salary figures account for
one-hcilf (the top half) of the
University salary figures. It
should be mentioned that once
an employee reaches the merit
zone area, it is entirely up to
his/her supervisor whether s/he
will ever receive any of that
amount.
There is no guarantee that
any of us will receive one penny
once we enter the merit zone.
This is one of the points which
many of the clerical staff want
to see addressed via contractual
bargaining. Without a contract
which is legal and binding, we
have no assurances that Stan
ford will give us the announced
pay raises.
A historical perspective on
traditional attitudes Stanford's
management has held is in or
der when reviewing these two
communications from Hastorf
and Massy. These letters were
brought to us by the folks who.
two years ago, gave us a 6.5 per
cent cost-of-living increase in
the face of double-digit infla
tion! Clearly, management was
unconcerned about our welfare
then, but that was before we
began to organize. These
"educational" attempts are
brought to us by the folks who.
that same year, took one week
of vacation away from new em
ployees. Had we had a contract
at that point, management
would have not been able to pull
a stunt like that.
These "communications" are
brought to us by the folks who,
when our blue-card drive was in
full swing last year, suddenly
announced their "concern" for
us with a 10 percent cost-of-liv
ing increase in an effort to abort
our unionization drive. The folks
who, seeing our determination,
became concerned enough to of
fer us the recently quoted salary
increases while saying that the
increases were due to a "1978
study." If this is so, why were
the increases not implemented
in 1978? Did we need such in
creases any less then, or was the
outmoded steps system any less
effective then? Clearly not.
What has changed, however, is
that we of the clerical and li
brary staff have shown our
force and our intention, and
Hastorf and Massy have
responded with last-minute ef
forts to appease us in hopes that
the spector of the Union would
go away.
We of the clerical and library
staff are not unreasonable
rowdies bent on the destruction
of the system. We are well
educated people who enjoy
working for Stanford. We come
from the same sorts of back
grounds that Hastorf and Massy
come from. We are, however,
dedicated to the notion that we
are intelligent human beings
who want a hand and a voice in
our futures, and who want to be
considered as professionals who
do our jobs very well, rather
than being considered "the
girl."
We found that asking for these
considerations without the
backing of an organization got
us nowhere. We then preceded
to the next obvious step — that
of unionization. We believe that
our services for the University
entitle us to decent wages and
working conditions We feel en
titled to adequate grievance
procedures. And we can't help
wondering why our requests are
met with such suspicion and dis

trust by Hastorf and Massy.

Chemistry Department
Unions ineffective
We have been bombared with
articles in the various campus
publications and by OSOC news
letters telling us why we should
have a union. Before we cast our
ballots we need facts in order to
make an intelligent decision.
I should like to state here that
the facts presented below are
the results of 40 years' secretar
ial experience, 19 of which have
been on the Stanford campus,
and a lot of homework on the
current clerical scene in several

of the large prestigious in
dustrial firms here on the penin
sula.
Stanford is not unique in its
shortage of qualified clerical
help. Unions do not provide
properly trained clerical staff
and a union is not going to solve
the problems here. Industrial
affiliates of the Department of
Industrial Engineering report
that unions are now beginning to
accept the fact that they are no
longer effective agents in ob
taining solutions to problems
encountered in the working
world.
To address specifics — the
"low" salaries at Stanford as a
reason for a union. A com
parison with the salaries of four
of the most prestigious firms
here on the peninsula to the ex
tent they were made available
revealed that Stanford salaries
matched and in some cases,
were even better. Now I had
been wondering why, if the
salaries at Stanford were so
much lower, the agitators for
higher salaries did not flock to
take advantage of the openings
in these firms — the results of
the comparison are the answer.
If they remain because they pre
fer the academic environment,
then they must be willing to
make a trade-off.
Service organizations cannot
compete salary-wise with firms
producing end products for prof
it and union dues will only
shrink our take-home pay even
further without any guaranteed
benefits! And it is really absurd
to compare the salaries of sec
retaries and lab technicians as
was done in a recent edition of
the OSOC News!
Where will you get two weeks
paid vacation the first year you
work plus 12 days sick leave, or
where will you get bereavement
leave without having it charged
to vacation leave, or more than
three weeks vacation a year?
Other benefits offered by var
ious employers must also be
carefully compared. It has been
argued that the dental plan was
implemented to forestall
unionization but investigation
revealed that dental plans were
being scrutinized for implemen
tation for at least two years
prior to Sept. 1, 1980 You cer
tainly will not get tuition schol
arships from any industrial
firm. Stock options and profit
sharing cannot be compared
with tuition scholarships, albeit
not everyone has children to
take advantage of this privilege,
but one of the reasons given for
demanding higher salaries was
to cope with the increased costs

of raising children, of which the
cost of education plays a major
part. This is having $3000 plus
added to your salary without
having to pay tax on it. Stock op
tions and profit sharing have
proved risky indeed to the em
ployees of firms with these
"benefits."
Plans are now being eval
uated to update retirement ben
efits so that upcoming retirees
will fare better.
Those of the clerical staff of
this university who have such a
low opinion of the occupation
and themselves should re-ex
amine the reasons why they
chose clerical work and Stan
ford in the first place. There is

no problem that the right person
in the admnistration will not ad
dress. It may take a few phone
calls but one will learn a lot
about Stanford, who to contact
for what, and discover a lot of
friends you didn't know you had.
The esprit is not as evident as it
once was due to the increase in
size of all departments and the
rapidity with which new pro
grams have to be implemented
and old ones constantly updated
in order to keep step with busi
ness and industry, but it is there
is one makes the effort to identi
fy with the University and the
opportunities it offers.
We all have a job to do which
carries responsibilities as well
as compensations and ev
erything cannot be done at once
either in our own personal lives
nor in the organization of which
we are a part to solve problems
which arise. We should not ex
pect the responsibilities for our
individual well-being to be as
sumed by an organization. It is
too soul-destroying to those who
have trained properly and
worked patiently to be darned
good secretaries who enjoy
their work to have those who are
unhappy demean the profession,
themselves, and their col
leagues.
The office staff has had an or
ganization on this campus for 30
years to "promote the fellow
ship and mutual helpfulness of
its members" but has never had
a membership of more than a
fraction of those eligible to join
(and the dues are only three
dollars per year.) A union will
fare no better when it comes to
representation at meetings. Al
ready U.S.E. had had to lower
its quorum to 15 to conduct busi
ness. I don't want people who
try to convince me of the merits
of a union by comparing apples
and bananas dictating the terms
of my position.
Vote no on May 7.
(Mildred Nilsson is a secretary
in industrial engineering.)
Cast vote
We have read the literature
circulated by the union and by
the University and have come to
the following conclusions .
First and foremost — it is vi
tal to vote on May 7 whether you
are for or against the union. If
you are against the union and do
not vote you have given others
the right to decide your job
future.
It would be nice to think that a
union or some other miracle
will guarantee that all man
agers and supervisors would be

perfect, that there would be ac
knowledgement for a job well
done, that a job will be classi
fied at the appropriate level for
the responsibility but at this
point the union has not con
vinced us that this unattainable
goal is attainable if they be
came our spokesman.
It can be hoped that the dis
cussion generated by union ac
tivity might encourage man
agement to look at the super
vision and if need be upgrade the
skilss those managers who need
this assistance. We night all
benefit from such evaluation
with action taken where re
quired.
If after the vote the union has

been accepted — you will be giv
en the opportunity to join or not
to join. You should also re
member that the salary changes
proposed for September will no
longer be applicable. ALL
salaries, benefits and working
conditions become negotiable
once the union has been voted in.
If you join, we believe . . .
You will be part of a group
whose bylaws will be developed
locally but based on the bylaws
of the National and Local 715.
You will be subject to dis
ciplinary action by the union if
required. — You will as a mem
ber vote for your represent
ative. — You will as a member
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will be able to vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — If you wish to file a
grievance, the union must agree
with you and act for you. They
are not required to file your
grievance and you may not file
on your own. — Job reclass
ifications, merit raises and oth
er working conditions will be
governed by union contract. —
If a strike is called — as a mem
ber you may not cross the picket
line. If you choose to do so you
will be subject to union dis
ciplinary action. You will not be
paid. *
If you do not join . . . You may
still be required to pay a "ser
vice fee." This will be at least
equal to the amount of dues
assessed. — You will not vote on
a representative. — You will not
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will not vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — You will not be sub
ject to union rules. — You (in all
probability) would be subject to
dismissal if you refuse to pay
the service fee. The University
will have no option on this. —
You will be subject to the same
grievance procedures as set
forth by the union. — In the
event of a strike you may con
tinue to work and you will con
tinue to be paid.
We can only hope that you all
will consider all the facts and
regardless of your stand, vote
on May 7.

troller's Office, School of

University inaction
Through the distribution of
four "Election Bulletins," the
University has attempted to put
the clerical union in a very
negative light. The emphasis
has been on what the union can't
do for us and, indeed, what it

may adversely do to us. How
ever, I have yet to read about
what the University can and will
do for us so that we don't need a
union.
Also, if the University wants
to bring out the "facts," per
haps it should be mentioned that
the Committee on the Education
and Employment of Women in
the University (C-EEWU) has
been abolished. In Campus Re
port, (Oct. 1, 1980), this com
mittee published a lengthy re
port on clerical dissatisfaction
with their jobs, influenced
largely by a perceived lack of
opportunity for promotion or
mobility.
Other factors, such as lack of
communication with super
visors, lack of staff develop
ment programs, and relatively
low salaries, were also men
tioned. C-EEWU made several
recommendations for improv
ing clerical conditions, with the
hope that they would be serious
ly considered for future study by
the University.
In a note dated Mar. 26, 1981,
Marion E. Smith, C-EEWU
Chairman, stated, "... The C
EEWU was abolished by the
Committee on Committees this
year as being unnecessary." In
light of this, I would appreciate
knowing just how the University
proposes to take such good care
of us that the union is unneces
sary.

Grievances fail
As May 7 approaches, I would
like to pass along two personal
experiences that might be in
formative to the undecided.
The first experience resulted
from a grievance I filed about
three years ago, and in which I
requested an outside hearing of
ficer. In violation of the Univer
sity's grievance procedures,
that officer was denied. As a re
sult, I filed suit before the Supe
rior Court of Santa Clara Coun
ty, asking that the University be
compelled to carry out its griev
ance procedures. Much to my
surprise, the Court ruled that
Stanford's Administration
Guide does not have " ... the
stature of a legally binding con
tract." In other words, not only
is the University not required to
abide by its own leaky grievance
procedures, the University is
not bound by any of the con
tents of that guide, which
touches on such crucial matters
as salaries, promotions, etc.
The second experience re
sulted from another grievance
filed last year. This grievance
was unsuccessful, of course (95
percent of them are). Recourse
was sought through the Equal
Employment Opportunity Com
mission in San Jose. During the
initial stages of the interview,
the commission's represent
ative took the liberty of telling
me, a complainant, that a mem
ber of the University's legal
staff had confessed to him that,
yes, there is racism at Stanford,
but would deny ever having said
it if quoted. I was doubly
startled; first, in the Univer
sity's representative feeling so
comfortable with the com
mission that the statement
could be made to it; second, by
the commission's represent
ative's presumption in relating
this to me, a person seeking the
protection of the commission
After trying to recover from
this confidence-evoking revel
ation, I was later faced with an
other. I signed a complaint with

the commission, of course,
which was sent to the University
for a response. The University's
response to my complaint was
not made available to me, and I
learned that it would not be, un
less permitted by the Univer
sity. It should be needless to say
that the University's counsel re
fused to let me see the response
My concern was that the com
mission could not make an en
lightened ruling on the case un
less exposed to free discussion
of the complaint and the re
sponse, but such was not the
case. Although the courts re
mained as a mechanism for
pursuing the complaint further,
due process should operate in all
agencies as well.
The bottom line is that if an
employee is to obtain fairness at
Stanford, it apparently must be
through a union and not through
administrative guides and gov
ernmental agencies.

Union needed
I would like to express my dis
pleasure with the decision re
garding the hearing of Rita
Mazon. I read the article con
cerning Rita's grievance in the
Daily and based on the facts sur
rounding the case, I feel the
hearing was unjust.
This case is a valid example
of Stanford's "fair" grievance
procedure. As a non-exempt of
fice workers, feel it is at my
best interest to vote for the
union. As we (office staff) stand
now, it is apparent that we have
no voice and whatever man
agement decides is final. Unless
we unite, Stanford will never ac
knowledge our grievances.
I am encouraging all of the
eligible office workers to vote
yes on May 7, union election
day. If you don't vote, don't
complain. Remember, what
happened to Rita could happen
to you. United we stand, divided
we fall.

Salary issue
Recently, the Provost and
Vice President for Business and
Finance circulated Election
Bulletin I to members of the
University Office and Library
Support Staff. It responded to an
issue that had been raised by
USE/Local 715 — namely, com
parative salary ranges for sev
eral classifications of employ
ees at Stanford and the surroun
ding community.
This Bulletin attempted to
put the salary issue into per
spective, and I applaud the at
tempt: the bar chart format
was quite helpful.
It would now be even more
helpful (in making a rational de
cision before the election), if
Provost Albert Hastorf and Mr.
William Massy, Vice President
for Business and Finance, would
now go one step further and
furnish us with the mean and
standard deviation of the salary
distribution, with reference
only to Stanford salaries. To put
it simply, let us know what the
salary spread within each range
looks like. For example, do
more secretary lis earn close to
$1000 or $1350 now? Will more
secretary Ills be earning $1300
or $1750 in September?
This information is pertinent
to the issue raised and will, I
hope, be presented in a forth
coming Bulletin.

Noise effective
A few thoughts follow regard
ing the letter sent to me from
the University dated March 17.
Q. "Why did the University
give the Union my home ad
dress?": This is a ridiculous
question. If you've ever noticed
your home mail as I have, you
would have noticed that you re
ceive tons of junk mail, the
senders of which have in some
cases obtained your private res
idence address from the Univer
sity. I would rather the Union
have my address than Stanford.
I would probably receive less
junk!
Q. "If I signed one of the union
"blue cards" does that mean I
must vote for the Union on May
7? ": I am insulted by the partic
ular "question and answer"
routine. This is the typical at
titude of management that the
backbone of this University, the
clerical people, are so naive and
ignorant that they would arbi
trarily sign something that they
knew nothing about. I signed my
blue card because I believe in
the Union and what it will do for
me. I also believe that Union
considers me a knowledgeable,
intelligent employee who is
aware of the issues involved, not
some dimwit who signs a blue
card because she/he is afraid to
say "NO" to someone.
Then there is all this garbage
about dues, financial fees, etc.
that seems to be a big point with
the University. Of course there
will be certain fees. Of course
the union needs money to run
itself or it wouldn't be a viable
alternative to the employment
practices of the University
(poor pay, misclassification).
Any large group needs a cer
tain amount of financial back
ing, and the dues are a good way
for each member to contribute a
small amount to keep their
bargaining unit functioning. It is
not such a backbreaking
amount, and if the University
would ever look at the past his
tory of Local 715, they would be
very upset to notice that there
probably is no record of "addi
tional financial payments" re
quested of their members. The
USE Chapter of Local 715 has
never levied fees in addition to
dues since they became or
ganized.
Q. "If Local 715 is elected will
I receive higher wages than I
would receive without a
-union?" (Obviously this partic
ular clerical would sign any
thing from anybody). This has
already been answered by the
fact that everytime the union
makes a little noise we get an in
crease. The union pushed for
certain critical issues last year,
and the University rebutted
with a higher increase and addi
tional benefits. Again the union
is making louder noises this
year and again the University is
rebutting with talk of revamp
ing the step sytem and increas
ing wages. I for one am not to
tally convinced that these in
creases would have occurred
without pressure of organizing
from the union.

Unions ineffective
We have been bombared with
articles in the various campus
publications and by OSOC news
letters telling us why we should
have a union. Before we cast our
ballots we need facts in order to
make an intelligent decision.
I should like to state here that
the facts presented below are
the results of 40 years' secretar
ial experience, 19 of which have
been on the Stanford campus,
and a lot of homework on the
current clerical scene in several

of the large prestigious in
dustrial firms here on the penin
sula.
Stanford is not unique in its
shortage of qualified clerical
help. Unions do not provide
properly trained clerical staff
and a union is not going to solve
the problems here. Industrial
affiliates of the Department of
Industrial Engineering report
that unions are now beginning to
accept the fact that they are no
longer effective agents in ob
taining solutions to problems
encountered in the working
world.
To address specifics — the
"low" salaries at Stanford as a
reason for a union. A com
parison with the salaries of four
of the most prestigious firms
here on the peninsula to the ex
tent they were made available
revealed that Stanford salaries
matched and in some cases,
were even better. Now I had
been wondering why, if the
salaries at Stanford were so
much lower, the agitators for
higher salaries did not flock to
take advantage of the openings
in these firms — the results of
the comparison are the answer.
If they remain because they pre
fer the academic environment,
then they must be willing to
make a trade-off.
Service organizations cannot
compete salary-wise with firms
producing end products for prof
it and union dues will only
shrink our take-home pay even
further without any guaranteed
benefits! And it is really absurd
to compare the salaries of sec
retaries and lab technicians as
was done in a recent edition of
the OSOC News!
Where will you get two weeks
paid vacation the first year you
work plus 12 days sick leave, or
where will you get bereavement
leave without having it charged
to vacation leave, or more than
three weeks vacation a year?
Other benefits offered by var
ious employers must also be
carefully compared. It has been
argued that the dental plan was
implemented to forestall
unionization but investigation
revealed that dental plans were
being scrutinized for implemen
tation for at least two years
prior to Sept. 1, 1980 You cer
tainly will not get tuition schol
arships from any industrial
firm. Stock options and profit
sharing cannot be compared
with tuition scholarships, albeit
not everyone has children to
take advantage of this privilege,
but one of the reasons given for
demanding higher salaries was
to cope with the increased costs

of raising children, of which the
cost of education plays a major
part. This is having $3000 plus
added to your salary without
having to pay tax on it. Stock op
tions and profit sharing have
proved risky indeed to the em
ployees of firms with these
"benefits."
Plans are now being eval
uated to update retirement ben
efits so that upcoming retirees
will fare better.
Those of the clerical staff of
this university who have such a
low opinion of the occupation
and themselves should re-ex
amine the reasons why they
chose clerical work and Stan
ford in the first place. There is

no problem that the right person
in the admnistration will not ad
dress. It may take a few phone
calls but one will learn a lot
about Stanford, who to contact
for what, and discover a lot of
friends you didn't know you had.
The esprit is not as evident as it
once was due to the increase in
size of all departments and the
rapidity with which new pro
grams have to be implemented
and old ones constantly updated
in order to keep step with busi
ness and industry, but it is there
is one makes the effort to identi
fy with the University and the
opportunities it offers.
We all have a job to do which
carries responsibilities as well
as compensations and ev
erything cannot be done at once
either in our own personal lives
nor in the organization of which
we are a part to solve problems
which arise. We should not ex
pect the responsibilities for our
individual well-being to be as
sumed by an organization. It is
too soul-destroying to those who
have trained properly and
worked patiently to be darned
good secretaries who enjoy
their work to have those who are
unhappy demean the profession,
themselves, and their col
leagues.
The office staff has had an or
ganization on this campus for 30
years to "promote the fellow
ship and mutual helpfulness of
its members" but has never had
a membership of more than a
fraction of those eligible to join
(and the dues are only three
dollars per year.) A union will
fare no better when it comes to
representation at meetings. Al
ready U.S.E. had had to lower
its quorum to 15 to conduct busi
ness. I don't want people who
try to convince me of the merits
of a union by comparing apples
and bananas dictating the terms
of my position.
Vote no on May 7.
(Mildred Nilsson is a secretary
in industrial engineering.)
Cast vote
We have read the literature
circulated by the union and by
the University and have come to
the following conclusions .
First and foremost — it is vi
tal to vote on May 7 whether you
are for or against the union. If
you are against the union and do
not vote you have given others
the right to decide your job
future.
It would be nice to think that a
union or some other miracle
will guarantee that all man
agers and supervisors would be

perfect, that there would be ac
knowledgement for a job well
done, that a job will be classi
fied at the appropriate level for
the responsibility but at this
point the union has not con
vinced us that this unattainable
goal is attainable if they be
came our spokesman.
It can be hoped that the dis
cussion generated by union ac
tivity might encourage man
agement to look at the super
vision and if need be upgrade the
skilss those managers who need
this assistance. We night all
benefit from such evaluation
with action taken where re
quired.
If after the vote the union has

been accepted — you will be giv
en the opportunity to join or not
to join. You should also re
member that the salary changes
proposed for September will no
longer be applicable. ALL
salaries, benefits and working
conditions become negotiable
once the union has been voted in.
If you join, we believe . . .
You will be part of a group
whose bylaws will be developed
locally but based on the bylaws
of the National and Local 715.
You will be subject to dis
ciplinary action by the union if
required. — You will as a mem
ber vote for your represent
ative. — You will as a member
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will be able to vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — If you wish to file a
grievance, the union must agree
with you and act for you. They
are not required to file your
grievance and you may not file
on your own. — Job reclass
ifications, merit raises and oth
er working conditions will be
governed by union contract. —
If a strike is called — as a mem
ber you may not cross the picket
line. If you choose to do so you
will be subject to union dis
ciplinary action. You will not be
paid. *
If you do not join . . . You may
still be required to pay a "ser
vice fee." This will be at least
equal to the amount of dues
assessed. — You will not vote on
a representative. — You will not
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will not vote for or
against a strike if this situation
occurs. — You will not be sub
ject to union rules. — You (in all
probability) would be subject to
dismissal if you refuse to pay
the service fee. The University
will have no option on this. —
You will be subject to the same
grievance procedures as set
forth by the union. — In the
event of a strike you may con
tinue to work and you will con
tinue to be paid.
We can only hope that you all
will consider all the facts and
regardless of your stand, vote
on May 7.

University inaction
Through the distribution of
four "Election Bulletins," the
University has attempted to put
the clerical union in a very
negative light. The emphasis
has been on what the union can't
do for us and, indeed, what it

may adversely do to us. How
ever, I have yet to read about
what the University can and will
do for us so that we don't need a
union.
Also, if the University wants
to bring out the "facts," per
haps it should be mentioned that
the Committee on the Education
and Employment of Women in
the University (C-EEWU) has
been abolished. In Campus Re
port, (Oct. 1, 1980), this com
mittee published a lengthy re
port on clerical dissatisfaction
with their jobs, influenced
largely by a perceived lack of
opportunity for promotion or
mobility.
Other factors, such as lack of
communication with super
visors, lack of staff develop
ment programs, and relatively
low salaries, were also men
tioned. C-EEWU made several
recommendations for improv
ing clerical conditions, with the
hope that they would be serious
ly considered for future study by
the University.
In a note dated Mar. 26, 1981,
Marion E. Smith, C-EEWU
Chairman, stated, "... The C
EEWU was abolished by the
Committee on Committees this
year as being unnecessary." In
light of this, I would appreciate
knowing just how the University
proposes to take such good care
of us that the union is unneces
sary.

Grievances fail
As May 7 approaches, I would
like to pass along two personal
experiences that might be in
formative to the undecided.
The first experience resulted
from a grievance I filed about
three years ago, and in which I
requested an outside hearing of
ficer. In violation of the Univer
sity's grievance procedures,
that officer was denied. As a re
sult, I filed suit before the Supe
rior Court of Santa Clara Coun
ty, asking that the University be
compelled to carry out its griev
ance procedures. Much to my
surprise, the Court ruled that
Stanford's Administration
Guide does not have " ... the
stature of a legally binding con
tract." In other words, not only
is the University not required to
abide by its own leaky grievance
procedures, the University is
not bound by any of the con
tents of that guide, which
touches on such crucial matters
as salaries, promotions, etc.
The second experience re
sulted from another grievance
filed last year. This grievance
was unsuccessful, of course (95
percent of them are). Recourse
was sought through the Equal
Employment Opportunity Com
mission in San Jose. During the
initial stages of the interview,
the commission's represent
ative took the liberty of telling
me, a complainant, that a mem
ber of the University's legal
staff had confessed to him that,
yes, there is racism at Stanford,
but would deny ever having said
it if quoted. I was doubly
startled; first, in the Univer
sity's representative feeling so
comfortable with the com
mission that the statement
could be made to it; second, by
the commission's represent
ative's presumption in relating
this to me, a person seeking the
protection of the commission
After trying to recover from
this confidence-evoking revel
ation, I was later faced with an
other. I signed a complaint with

the commission, of course,
which was sent to the University
for a response. The University's
response to my complaint was
not made available to me, and I
learned that it would not be, un
less permitted by the Univer
sity. It should be needless to say
that the University's counsel re
fused to let me see the response
My concern was that the com
mission could not make an en
lightened ruling on the case un
less exposed to free discussion
of the complaint and the re
sponse, but such was not the
case. Although the courts re
mained as a mechanism for
pursuing the complaint further,
due process should operate in all
agencies as well.
The bottom line is that if an
employee is to obtain fairness at
Stanford, it apparently must be
through a union and not through
administrative guides and gov
ernmental agencies.

Union needed
I would like to express my dis
pleasure with the decision re
garding the hearing of Rita
Mazon. I read the article con
cerning Rita's grievance in the
Daily and based on the facts sur
rounding the case, I feel the
hearing was unjust.
This case is a valid example
of Stanford's "fair" grievance
procedure. As a non-exempt of
fice workers, feel it is at my
best interest to vote for the
union. As we (office staff) stand
now, it is apparent that we have
no voice and whatever man
agement decides is final. Unless
we unite, Stanford will never ac
knowledge our grievances.
I am encouraging all of the
eligible office workers to vote
yes on May 7, union election
day. If you don't vote, don't
complain. Remember, what
happened to Rita could happen
to you. United we stand, divided
we fall.

Salary issue
Recently, the Provost and
Vice President for Business and
Finance circulated Election
Bulletin I to members of the
University Office and Library
Support Staff. It responded to an
issue that had been raised by
USE/Local 715 — namely, com
parative salary ranges for sev
eral classifications of employ
ees at Stanford and the surroun
ding community.
This Bulletin attempted to
put the salary issue into per
spective, and I applaud the at
tempt: the bar chart format
was quite helpful.
It would now be even more
helpful (in making a rational de
cision before the election), if
Provost Albert Hastorf and Mr.
William Massy, Vice President
for Business and Finance, would
now go one step further and
furnish us with the mean and
standard deviation of the salary
distribution, with reference
only to Stanford salaries. To put
it simply, let us know what the
salary spread within each range
looks like. For example, do
more secretary lis earn close to
$1000 or $1350 now? Will more
secretary Ills be earning $1300
or $1750 in September?
This information is pertinent
to the issue raised and will, I
hope, be presented in a forth
coming Bulletin.

Noise effective
A few thoughts follow regard
ing the letter sent to me from
the University dated March 17.
Q. "Why did the University
give the Union my home ad
dress?": This is a ridiculous
question. If you've ever noticed
your home mail as I have, you
would have noticed that you re
ceive tons of junk mail, the
senders of which have in some
cases obtained your private res
idence address from the Univer
sity. I would rather the Union
have my address than Stanford.
I would probably receive less
junk!
Q. "If I signed one of the union
"blue cards" does that mean I
must vote for the Union on May
7? ": I am insulted by the partic
ular "question and answer"
routine. This is the typical at
titude of management that the
backbone of this University, the
clerical people, are so naive and
ignorant that they would arbi
trarily sign something that they
knew nothing about. I signed my
blue card because I believe in
the Union and what it will do for
me. I also believe that Union
considers me a knowledgeable,
intelligent employee who is
aware of the issues involved, not
some dimwit who signs a blue
card because she/he is afraid to
say "NO" to someone.
Then there is all this garbage
about dues, financial fees, etc.
that seems to be a big point with
the University. Of course there
will be certain fees. Of course
the union needs money to run
itself or it wouldn't be a viable
alternative to the employment
practices of the University
(poor pay, misclassification).
Any large group needs a cer
tain amount of financial back
ing, and the dues are a good way
for each member to contribute a
small amount to keep their
bargaining unit functioning. It is
not such a backbreaking
amount, and if the University
would ever look at the past his
tory of Local 715, they would be
very upset to notice that there
probably is no record of "addi
tional financial payments" re
quested of their members. The
USE Chapter of Local 715 has
never levied fees in addition to
dues since they became or
ganized.
Q. "If Local 715 is elected will
I receive higher wages than I
would receive without a
-union?" (Obviously this partic
ular clerical would sign any
thing from anybody). This has
already been answered by the
fact that everytime the union
makes a little noise we get an in
crease. The union pushed for
certain critical issues last year,
and the University rebutted
with a higher increase and addi
tional benefits. Again the union
is making louder noises this
year and again the University is
rebutting with talk of revamp
ing the step sytem and increas
ing wages. I for one am not to
tally convinced that these in
creases would have occurred
without pressure of organizing
from the union.

Issues 'muddied'
The Offices of the Provost
and Vice-President for Business
and Finance have recently
launched a campaign to try to
slow down our unionization
drive. It is very important to
that we each see PrQvost Albert
Hastorf and Vice President for
Business and Finance William
Massy's "education" endeavors
for what they are — poorly re
searched attempts to use their
offices as a means to color our
judgement and muddy the real
issues raised by our continuing
effort to gain a legal and binding
contract with the University.
Recently these two gen
tlemen have sent each of the
clerical staff two such "educa
tional" missives. The first was
sent to us at our homes, and the
second distributed to us at our
job sites. Each of these missives
requires examination.
In the first of these com
munications we were told that
the Union can call a strike if ne
gotiations between our elected
Union representatives and the
University break down. This is a
misconception. The member
ship is polled regarding pro
posed contracts, and our nego
tiators (whom we elect) would
not "call a strike" without a
massive majority vote from the
membership. In short, there
can't be a strike unless we, the
membership, overwhelmingly
vote for one. This letter at
tempted to portray the Union as
some distant third party. In
fact, the Union is each of us.
Hastorf and Massy's "third par
ty" notion falls just short of
being a deliberate misconcep
tion, and is not the sort of re
search that has placed Stanford
in the prestigious position the
University now enjoys.
The second publication from
the Provost and Business and

Finance dealt with comparative
salaries This communication
intimates that Local 715 (our lo
cal when we win the election)
has not gained much for the
clerical units the Local repre
sents in San Mateo County,
Redwood City. Palo Alto and
Santa Gara counties. This is in
ferred via several graphs com
paring the present and proposed
salaries from these cities and
counties with Stanford's present
and proposed salary ranges.
Hastorf and Massy have asked
us to compare apples and or
anges because they are fruit in
this instance. The salaries listed
that are under contract from the
cities and counties are those of
public sector employers, and
Stanford is a private sector em
ployer. Traditionally the public
sector is under more stringent
budgetary restraint than is the
private sector. These gen
tlemen have failed to compare
Stanford's salary ranges with
those of other private em
ployers who are under contract.
The job classifications which
were compared (i.e., "Account
ing Assistant I") were not
carefully researched, if they
were researched at all. The
stated classificatin of, for in
stance, the "Acct. Clk I" gave
Stanford's salary as $965 -$1050
In truth. Santa Clara's real
equivalent job classification re
ceives $1048 — $1268. This repre
sents an error made by Hastorf
and Massy to the tune of some
$200 per month.
Additionally, these two gen
tlemen include in their quota
tions of Stanford's salaries the
merit zone figures. If we ex
amine their graphs for Stanford
we can easily see that the merit
zone salary figures account for
one-hcilf (the top half) of the
University salary figures. It
should be mentioned that once
an employee reaches the merit
zone area, it is entirely up to
his/her supervisor whether s/he
will ever receive any of that
amount.
There is no guarantee that
any of us will receive one penny
once we enter the merit zone.
This is one of the points which
many of the clerical staff want
to see addressed via contractual
bargaining. Without a contract
which is legal and binding, we
have no assurances that Stan
ford will give us the announced
pay raises.
A historical perspective on
traditional attitudes Stanford's
management has held is in or
der when reviewing these two
communications from Hastorf
and Massy. These letters were
brought to us by the folks who.
two years ago, gave us a 6.5 per
cent cost-of-living increase in
the face of double-digit infla
tion! Clearly, management was
unconcerned about our welfare
then, but that was before we
began to organize. These
"educational" attempts are
brought to us by the folks who.
that same year, took one week
of vacation away from new em
ployees. Had we had a contract
at that point, management
would have not been able to pull
a stunt like that.
These "communications" are
brought to us by the folks who,
when our blue-card drive was in
full swing last year, suddenly
announced their "concern" for
us with a 10 percent cost-of-liv
ing increase in an effort to abort
our unionization drive. The folks
who, seeing our determination,
became concerned enough to of
fer us the recently quoted salary
increases while saying that the
increases were due to a "1978
study." If this is so, why were
the increases not implemented
in 1978? Did we need such in
creases any less then, or was the
outmoded steps system any less
effective then? Clearly not.
What has changed, however, is
that we of the clerical and li
brary staff have shown our
force and our intention, and
Hastorf and Massy have
responded with last-minute ef
forts to appease us in hopes that
the spector of the Union would
go away.
We of the clerical and library
staff are not unreasonable
rowdies bent on the destruction
of the system. We are well
educated people who enjoy
working for Stanford. We come
from the same sorts of back
grounds that Hastorf and Massy
come from. We are, however,
dedicated to the notion that we
are intelligent human beings
who want a hand and a voice in
our futures, and who want to be
considered as professionals who
do our jobs very well, rather
than being considered "the
girl."
We found that asking for these
considerations without the
backing of an organization got
us nowhere. We then preceded
to the next obvious step — that

our services for the University
entitle us to decent wages and
working conditions We feel en

will consider all the facts and
regardless of your stand, vote
on May 7.

University inaction
Through the distribution of
four "Election Bulletins," the
University has attempted to put
the clerical union in a very
negative light. The emphasis
has been on what the union can't
do for us and, indeed, what it

may adversely do to us. How
ever, I have yet to read about
what the University can and will
do for us so that we don't need a
union.
Also, if the University wants
to bring out the "facts," per
haps it should be mentioned that
the Committee on the Education
and Employment of Women in
the University (C-EEWU) has
been abolished. In Campus Re
port, (Oct. 1, 1980), this com
mittee published a lengthy re
port on clerical dissatisfaction
with their jobs, influenced
largely by a perceived lack of
opportunity for promotion or
mobility.
Other factors, such as lack of
communication with super
visors, lack of staff develop
ment programs, and relatively
low salaries, were also men
tioned. C-EEWU made several
recommendations for improv
ing clerical conditions, with the
hope that they would be serious
ly considered for future study by
the University.
In a note dated Mar. 26, 1981,
Marion E. Smith, C-EEWU
Chairman, stated, "... The C
EEWU was abolished by the
Committee on Committees this
year as being unnecessary." In
light of this, I would appreciate
knowing just how the University
proposes to take such good care
of us that the union is unneces
sary.

Grievances fail
As May 7 approaches, I would
like to pass along two personal
experiences that might be in
formative to the undecided.
The first experience resulted
from a grievance I filed about
three years ago, and in which I
requested an outside hearing of
ficer. In violation of the Univer
sity's grievance procedures,
that officer was denied. As a re
sult, I filed suit before the Supe
rior Court of Santa Clara Coun
ty, asking that the University be
compelled to carry out its griev
ance procedures. Much to my
surprise, the Court ruled that
Stanford's Administration
Guide does not have " ... the
stature of a legally binding con
tract." In other words, not only
is the University not required to
abide by its own leaky grievance
procedures, the University is
not bound by any of the con
tents of that guide, which
touches on such crucial matters
as salaries, promotions, etc.
The second experience re
sulted from another grievance
filed last year. This grievance
was unsuccessful, of course (95
percent of them are). Recourse
was sought through the Equal
Employment Opportunity Com
mission in San Jose. During the
initial stages of the interview,
the commission's represent
ative took the liberty of telling
me, a complainant, that a mem
ber of the University's legal
staff had confessed to him that,
yes, there is racism at Stanford,
but would deny ever having said
it if quoted. I was doubly
startled; first, in the Univer
sity's representative feeling so
comfortable with the com
mission that the statement
could be made to it; second, by
the commission's represent
ative's presumption in relating
this to me, a person seeking the
protection of the commission
After trying to recover from
this confidence-evoking revel
ation, I was later faced with an
other. I signed a complaint with

the commission, of course,
which was sent to the University
for a response. The University's
response to my complaint was
not made available to me, and I
learned that it would not be, un
less permitted by the Univer
sity. It should be needless to say
that the University's counsel re
fused to let me see the response
My concern was that the com
mission could not make an en
lightened ruling on the case un
less exposed to free discussion
of the complaint and the re
sponse, but such was not the
case. Although the courts re
mained as a mechanism for
pursuing the complaint further,
due process should operate in all
agencies as well.
The bottom line is that if an
employee is to obtain fairness at
Stanford, it apparently must be
through a union and not through
administrative guides and gov
ernmental agencies.

Union needed
I would like to express my dis
pleasure with the decision re
garding the hearing of Rita
Mazon. I read the article con
cerning Rita's grievance in the
Daily and based on the facts sur
rounding the case, I feel the
hearing was unjust.
This case is a valid example
of Stanford's "fair" grievance
procedure. As a non-exempt of
fice workers, feel it is at my
best interest to vote for the
union. As we (office staff) stand
now, it is apparent that we have
no voice and whatever man
agement decides is final. Unless
we unite, Stanford will never ac
knowledge our grievances.
I am encouraging all of the
eligible office workers to vote
yes on May 7, union election
day. If you don't vote, don't
complain. Remember, what
happened to Rita could happen
to you. United we stand, divided
we fall.

Salary issue
Recently, the Provost and
Vice President for Business and
Finance circulated Election
Bulletin I to members of the
University Office and Library
Support Staff. It responded to an
issue that had been raised by
USE/Local 715 — namely, com
parative salary ranges for sev
eral classifications of employ
ees at Stanford and the surroun
ding community.
This Bulletin attempted to
put the salary issue into per
spective, and I applaud the at
tempt: the bar chart format
was quite helpful.
It would now be even more
helpful (in making a rational de
cision before the election), if
Provost Albert Hastorf and Mr.
William Massy, Vice President
for Business and Finance, would
now go one step further and
furnish us with the mean and
standard deviation of the salary
distribution, with reference
only to Stanford salaries. To put
it simply, let us know what the
salary spread within each range
looks like. For example, do
more secretary lis earn close to
$1000 or $1350 now? Will more
secretary Ills be earning $1300
or $1750 in September?
This information is pertinent
to the issue raised and will, I
hope, be presented in a forth
coming Bulletin.

Noise effective
A few thoughts follow regard
ing the letter sent to me from
the University dated March 17.
Q. "Why did the University
give the Union my home ad
dress?": This is a ridiculous
question. If you've ever noticed
your home mail as I have, you
would have noticed that you re
ceive tons of junk mail, the
senders of which have in some
cases obtained your private res
idence address from the Univer
sity. I would rather the Union
have my address than Stanford.
I would probably receive less
junk!
Q. "If I signed one of the union
"blue cards" does that mean I
must vote for the Union on May
7? ": I am insulted by the partic
ular "question and answer"
routine. This is the typical at
titude of management that the
backbone of this University, the
clerical people, are so naive and
ignorant that they would arbi
trarily sign something that they
knew nothing about. I signed my
blue card because I believe in
the Union and what it will do for
me. I also believe that Union
considers me a knowledgeable,
intelligent employee who is
aware of the issues involved, not
some dimwit who signs a blue
card because she/he is afraid to
say "NO" to someone.
Then there is all this garbage
about dues, financial fees, etc.
that seems to be a big point with
the University. Of course there
will be certain fees. Of course
the union needs money to run
itself or it wouldn't be a viable
alternative to the employment
practices of the University
(poor pay, misclassification).
Any large group needs a cer
tain amount of financial back
ing, and the dues are a good way
for each member to contribute a
small amount to keep their
bargaining unit functioning. It is
not such a backbreaking
amount, and if the University
would ever look at the past his
tory of Local 715, they would be
very upset to notice that there
probably is no record of "addi
tional financial payments" re
quested of their members. The
USE Chapter of Local 715 has
never levied fees in addition to
dues since they became or
ganized.
Q. "If Local 715 is elected will
I receive higher wages than I
would receive without a
-union?" (Obviously this partic
ular clerical would sign any
thing from anybody). This has
already been answered by the
fact that everytime the union
makes a little noise we get an in
crease. The union pushed for
certain critical issues last year,
and the University rebutted
with a higher increase and addi
tional benefits. Again the union
is making louder noises this
year and again the University is
rebutting with talk of revamp
ing the step sytem and increas
ing wages. I for one am not to
tally convinced that these in
creases would have occurred
without pressure of organizing
from the union.

Issues 'muddied'
The Offices of the Provost
and Vice-President for Business
and Finance have recently
launched a campaign to try to
slow down our unionization
drive. It is very important to
that we each see PrQvost Albert
Hastorf and Vice President for
Business and Finance William
Massy's "education" endeavors
for what they are — poorly re
searched attempts to use their
offices as a means to color our
judgement and muddy the real
issues raised by our continuing
effort to gain a legal and binding
contract with the University.
Recently these two gen
tlemen have sent each of the
clerical staff two such "educa
tional" missives. The first was
sent to us at our homes, and the
second distributed to us at our
job sites. Each of these missives
requires examination.
In the first of these com
munications we were told that
the Union can call a strike if ne
gotiations between our elected
Union representatives and the
University break down. This is a
misconception. The member
ship is polled regarding pro
posed contracts, and our nego
tiators (whom we elect) would
not "call a strike" without a
massive majority vote from the
membership. In short, there
can't be a strike unless we, the
membership, overwhelmingly
vote for one. This letter at
tempted to portray the Union as
some distant third party. In
fact, the Union is each of us.
Hastorf and Massy's "third par
ty" notion falls just short of
being a deliberate misconcep
tion, and is not the sort of re
search that has placed Stanford
in the prestigious position the
University now enjoys.
The second publication from
the Provost and Business and

Finance dealt with comparative
salaries This communication
intimates that Local 715 (our lo
cal when we win the election)
has not gained much for the
clerical units the Local repre
sents in San Mateo County,
Redwood City. Palo Alto and
Santa Gara counties. This is in
ferred via several graphs com
paring the present and proposed
salaries from these cities and
counties with Stanford's present
and proposed salary ranges.
Hastorf and Massy have asked
us to compare apples and or
anges because they are fruit in
this instance. The salaries listed
that are under contract from the
cities and counties are those of
public sector employers, and
Stanford is a private sector em
ployer. Traditionally the public
sector is under more stringent
budgetary restraint than is the
private sector. These gen
tlemen have failed to compare
Stanford's salary ranges with
those of other private em
ployers who are under contract.
The job classifications which
were compared (i.e., "Account
ing Assistant I") were not
carefully researched, if they
were researched at all. The
stated classificatin of, for in
stance, the "Acct. Clk I" gave
Stanford's salary as $965 -$1050
In truth. Santa Clara's real
equivalent job classification re
ceives $1048 — $1268. This repre
sents an error made by Hastorf
and Massy to the tune of some
$200 per month.
Additionally, these two gen
tlemen include in their quota
tions of Stanford's salaries the
merit zone figures. If we ex
amine their graphs for Stanford
we can easily see that the merit
zone salary figures account for
one-hcilf (the top half) of the
University salary figures. It
should be mentioned that once
an employee reaches the merit
zone area, it is entirely up to
his/her supervisor whether s/he
will ever receive any of that
amount.
There is no guarantee that
any of us will receive one penny
once we enter the merit zone.
This is one of the points which
many of the clerical staff want
to see addressed via contractual
bargaining. Without a contract
which is legal and binding, we
have no assurances that Stan
ford will give us the announced
pay raises.
A historical perspective on
traditional attitudes Stanford's
management has held is in or
der when reviewing these two
communications from Hastorf
and Massy. These letters were
brought to us by the folks who.
two years ago, gave us a 6.5 per
cent cost-of-living increase in
the face of double-digit infla
tion! Clearly, management was
unconcerned about our welfare
then, but that was before we
began to organize. These
"educational" attempts are
brought to us by the folks who.
that same year, took one week
of vacation away from new em
ployees. Had we had a contract
at that point, management
would have not been able to pull
a stunt like that.
These "communications" are
brought to us by the folks who,
when our blue-card drive was in
full swing last year, suddenly
announced their "concern" for
us with a 10 percent cost-of-liv
ing increase in an effort to abort
our unionization drive. The folks
who, seeing our determination,
became concerned enough to of
fer us the recently quoted salary
increases while saying that the
increases were due to a "1978
study." If this is so, why were
the increases not implemented
in 1978? Did we need such in
creases any less then, or was the
outmoded steps system any less
effective then? Clearly not.
What has changed, however, is
that we of the clerical and li
brary staff have shown our
force and our intention, and
Hastorf and Massy have
responded with last-minute ef
forts to appease us in hopes that
the spector of the Union would
go away.
We of the clerical and library
staff are not unreasonable
rowdies bent on the destruction
of the system. We are well
educated people who enjoy
working for Stanford. We come
from the same sorts of back
grounds that Hastorf and Massy
come from. We are, however,
dedicated to the notion that we
are intelligent human beings
who want a hand and a voice in
our futures, and who want to be
considered as professionals who
do our jobs very well, rather
than being considered "the
girl."
We found that asking for these
considerations without the
backing of an organization got
us nowhere. We then preceded
to the next obvious step — that
of unionization. We believe that
our services for the University
entitle us to decent wages and
working conditions We feel en
titled to adequate grievance
procedures. And we can't help
wondering why our requests are
met with such suspicion and dis

trust by Hastorf and Massy.

Chemistry Department
Unions ineffective
We have been bombared with
articles in the various campus
publications and by OSOC news
letters telling us why we should
have a union. Before we cast our
ballots we need facts in order to
make an intelligent decision.
I should like to state here that
the facts presented below are
the results of 40 years' secretar
ial experience, 19 of which have
been on the Stanford campus,
and a lot of homework on the
current clerical scene in several

of the large prestigious in
dustrial firms here on the penin
sula.
Stanford is not unique in its
shortage of qualified clerical
help. Unions do not provide
properly trained clerical staff
and a union is not going to solve
the problems here. Industrial
affiliates of the Department of
Industrial Engineering report
that unions are now beginning to
accept the fact that they are no
longer effective agents in ob
taining solutions to problems
encountered in the working
world.
To address specifics — the
"low" salaries at Stanford as a
reason for a union. A com
parison with the salaries of four
of the most prestigious firms
here on the peninsula to the ex
tent they were made available
revealed that Stanford salaries
matched and in some cases,
were even better. Now I had
been wondering why, if the
salaries at Stanford were so
much lower, the agitators for
higher salaries did not flock to
take advantage of the openings
in these firms — the results of
the comparison are the answer.
If they remain because they pre
fer the academic environment,
then they must be willing to
make a trade-off.
Service organizations cannot
compete salary-wise with firms
producing end products for prof
it and union dues will only
shrink our take-home pay even
further without any guaranteed
benefits! And it is really absurd
to compare the salaries of sec
retaries and lab technicians as
was done in a recent edition of
the OSOC News!
Where will you get two weeks
paid vacation the first year you
work plus 12 days sick leave, or
where will you get bereavement
leave without having it charged
to vacation leave, or more than
three weeks vacation a year?
Other benefits offered by var
ious employers must also be
carefully compared. It has been
argued that the dental plan was
implemented to forestall
unionization but investigation
revealed that dental plans were
being scrutinized for implemen
tation for at least two years
prior to Sept. 1, 1980 You cer
tainly will not get tuition schol
arships from any industrial
firm. Stock options and profit
sharing cannot be compared
with tuition scholarships, albeit
not everyone has children to
take advantage of this privilege,
but one of the reasons given for
demanding higher salaries was
to cope with the increased costs

of raising children, of which the
cost of education plays a major
part. This is having $3000 plus
added to your salary without
having to pay tax on it. Stock op
tions and profit sharing have
proved risky indeed to the em
ployees of firms with these
"benefits."
Plans are now being eval
uated to update retirement ben
efits so that upcoming retirees
will fare better.
Those of the clerical staff of
this university who have such a
low opinion of the occupation
and themselves should re-ex
amine the reasons why they
chose clerical work and Stan
ford in the first place. There is

no problem that the right person
in the admnistration will not ad
dress. It may take a few phone
calls but one will learn a lot
about Stanford, who to contact
for what, and discover a lot of
friends you didn't know you had.
The esprit is not as evident as it
once was due to the increase in
size of all departments and the
rapidity with which new pro
grams have to be implemented
and old ones constantly updated
in order to keep step with busi
ness and industry, but it is there
is one makes the effort to identi
fy with the University and the
opportunities it offers.
We all have a job to do which
carries responsibilities as well
as compensations and ev
erything cannot be done at once
either in our own personal lives
nor in the organization of which
we are a part to solve problems
which arise. We should not ex
pect the responsibilities for our
individual well-being to be as
sumed by an organization. It is
too soul-destroying to those who
have trained properly and
worked patiently to be darned
good secretaries who enjoy
their work to have those who are
unhappy demean the profession,
themselves, and their col
leagues.
The office staff has had an or
ganization on this campus for 30
years to "promote the fellow
ship and mutual helpfulness of
its members" but has never had
a membership of more than a
fraction of those eligible to join
(and the dues are only three
dollars per year.) A union will
fare no better when it comes to
representation at meetings. Al
ready U.S.E. had had to lower
its quorum to 15 to conduct busi
ness. I don't want people who
try to convince me of the merits
of a union by comparing apples
and bananas dictating the terms
of my position.
Vote no on May 7.
(Mildred Nilsson is a secretary
in industrial engineering.)
Cast vote
We have read the literature
circulated by the union and by
the University and have come to
the following conclusions .
First and foremost — it is vi
tal to vote on May 7 whether you
are for or against the union. If
you are against the union and do
not vote you have given others
the right to decide your job
future.
It would be nice to think that a
union or some other miracle
will guarantee that all man
agers and supervisors would be

perfect, that there would be ac
knowledgement for a job well
done, that a job will be classi
fied at the appropriate level for
the responsibility but at this
point the union has not con
vinced us that this unattainable
goal is attainable if they be
came our spokesman.
It can be hoped that the dis
cussion generated by union ac
tivity might encourage man
agement to look at the super
vision and if need be upgrade the
skilss those managers who need
this assistance. We night all
benefit from such evaluation
with action taken where re
quired.
If after the vote the union has

been accepted — you will be giv
en the opportunity to join or not
to join. You should also re
member that the salary changes
proposed for September will no
longer be applicable. ALL
salaries, benefits and working
conditions become negotiable
once the union has been voted in.
If you join, we believe . . .
You will be part of a group
whose bylaws will be developed
locally but based on the bylaws
of the National and Local 715.
You will be subject to dis
ciplinary action by the union if
required. — You will as a mem
ber vote for your represent

— You will be able to vote for or

governed by union contract. —
If a strike is called — as a mem
ber you may not cross the picket
line. If you choose to do so you
will be subject to union dis
ciplinary action. You will not be

If you do not join . . . You may
still be required to pay a "ser
vice fee." This will be at least
equal to the amount of dues
assessed. — You will not vote on
a representative. — You will not
vote on a negotiated agreement.
— You will not vote for or

will have no option on this. —

pursuing the complaint further,
due process should operate in all
agencies as well.
The bottom line is that if an
employee is to obtain fairness at
Stanford, it apparently must be
through a union and not through
administrative guides and gov
ernmental agencies.

Union needed
I would like to express my dis
pleasure with the decision re
garding the hearing of Rita
Mazon. I read the article con
cerning Rita's grievance in the
Daily and based on the facts sur
rounding the case, I feel the
hearing was unjust.
This case is a valid example
of Stanford's "fair" grievance
procedure. As a non-exempt of
fice workers, feel it is at my
best interest to vote for the
union. As we (office staff) stand
now, it is apparent that we have
no voice and whatever man
agement decides is final. Unless
we unite, Stanford will never ac
knowledge our grievances.
I am encouraging all of the
eligible office workers to vote
yes on May 7, union election
day. If you don't vote, don't
complain. Remember, what
happened to Rita could happen
to you. United we stand, divided
we fall.

Salary issue
Recently, the Provost and
Vice President for Business and
Finance circulated Election
Bulletin I to members of the
University Office and Library
Support Staff. It responded to an
issue that had been raised by
USE/Local 715 — namely, com
parative salary ranges for sev
eral classifications of employ
ees at Stanford and the surroun
ding community.
This Bulletin attempted to
put the salary issue into per
spective, and I applaud the at
tempt: the bar chart format
was quite helpful.
It would now be even more
helpful (in making a rational de
cision before the election), if
Provost Albert Hastorf and Mr.
William Massy, Vice President
for Business and Finance, would
now go one step further and
furnish us with the mean and
standard deviation of the salary
distribution, with reference
only to Stanford salaries. To put
it simply, let us know what the
salary spread within each range
looks like. For example, do
more secretary lis earn close to
$1000 or $1350 now? Will more
secretary Ills be earning $1300
or $1750 in September?
This information is pertinent
to the issue raised and will, I
hope, be presented in a forth
coming Bulletin.
