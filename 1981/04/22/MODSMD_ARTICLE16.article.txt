## Why administration says no 
### 
I want to respond to various comments that
have been made, in these pages and elsewhere
over the past month, about my position on the ef
fort by USE/SEIU Local 715 to unionize Stan
ford's office and library support staff.
These arguments in particular need to be an
swered. To begin with, it is alleged that somehow
I. or the Stanford administration, ought not to
take a position on the organization issue. In addi
tion, it is said that by indicating a preference in
the matter the administration is revealing an
"anti-union" attitude; and to this is added the
claim that in opposing this particular union at this
time, we are revealing a concern for Stanford's
economic welfare as opposed to that of Stanford
workers.
On the first point, it is both legal and entirely
usual for a University administration (or for man
agement in a profit corporation) to express a
strong view on the merits of a particular
unionization issue — whether pro (as it occasion
ally is) or con. It is important for the voters in an
election to know where the principals stand. In my
letter of Jan. 27, in addition to announcing our plan
to oppose USE/SEIU Local 715,1 pledged the ad
ministration to provide objective, accurate in
formation to the voters in this election. Could the
electorate have evaluated that information as
fairly had we deliberately permitted a false as
sumption of neutrality to prevail? I think it would
have been less fair, not fairer, had we stepped
aside from full disclosure.
Our position in the present election is based on a

number of factors — none of which relate to
salary and benefits. The consequences of eight
years of living with USE, both before and after its
merger into Local 715, have not entailed special
financial difficulties for the institution. It is im
portant to note that salary and benefits for USE
bargaining unit members have not improved at a
faster rate than those of non-union workers at
Stanford; on the contrary, Stanford office and li
brary support staff have done better over the past
five years than USE members.
My concern is quite different, and it stems from
our actual experience with USE and Local 715.
The attitude and practices of USE/Local 715 have
been unusually negative, and counterproductive
to efforts to resolve important employment prob
lems and issues. The atmosphere that has re
sulted has often been tense and hostile — a cir
cumstance not usually found when unions are tru
ly effective in gaining recognition and benefits for
their members, and one that is especially damag
ing to the working environment in faculty or staff
offices.
The election we are about to have is not a choice
between "no union" and "some union;" it is be
tween "no union" and "USE/SEIU Local 715 now
I do not think all unions are undesirable, but I do
think some unions are undesirable in some situ
ations. It is on that basis that I oppose USE/SEIU
Local 715 in this election. But if Stanford's office
workers do select that union as their bargaining
agent, we will bargain with it in good faith.
