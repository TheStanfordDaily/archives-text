## Resources on the reservations 
### 
The critical issue of resource
development on Indian reserva
tions is one that the general pub
lic is not well informed about.
For those concerned about our
energy future, it is necessary to
understand that a major portion
of the U.S. energy reserves of oil
coal, uranium, and natural gas
lie on Native American lands.
Some estimate up to 80 percent
of uranium, and 1/3 of Western
coal. American self-sufficiency
in energy will rely heavily on
the development of these Indian
owned resources.
The Council of Energy Re
source Tribes (CERT) was
formed in 1975 by 25 tribes dis
gusted with the past energy
leases arranged by the Bureau
of Indian Affairs (BIA) which
had resulted in paltry royalties
and environmental ruin. The
U.S. Government feared this
'Indian OPEC' image. By 1979
they had co-opted the move
ment by providing 'operating
expenses' to the tune of a $24
million aid package from the
Department of Energy. Govern
ment monies are now funneled
to tribes with each energy con
cession made, which CERT
terms 'negotiated com
promises.' There is evidence
that a CERT member's non
compliance with Federal and
corporate requests are met with
throuts of withdrawl of Federal
program dollars for education,
health, welfare, etc.
Peter McDonald, Chairman
of the Navajo Nation and Presi
dent of CERT, has committed
himself to full cooperation with
the U.S. government in develop
ing these resources in order to
"help American get back on its
energy feet again." He feels this
will at the same time restore ec
onomic self-determination to
Native American tribes and
promote "protection, conserva
tion, control and prudent man
agement" to tribal resources.
Unwittingly or intentionally, he
and other CERT members are

leading their people into a new
era of neo-colonialism.
The traditional leaders, in op
position to CERT, say that the
organization represents the de
sires of 25 elitist Tribal
Chairmen, not the wishes of the
25 tribes' members. They see
CERT as a small en
terpreneurial group of Indians
seeking to interpose their or
ganization between tribal
groups and the Federal Govern
ment.
The majority of Indians of
these lands are uninformed
about the CERT decisions until
their lives are directly affected.
For example, in order to extend
the Black Mesa strip mine area
to vast seams of high grade coal,
the BIA is currently attempting
to relocate 5600 protesting
Navajos from their homelands
to Flagstaff, Arizona, under the
guise of settling a joint land dis
pute beteen the Navajo and
Hopi: CERT is an accomplice in
this action.
CERT (with the financial
backing of ARCO, Equitable
Life, FLOUR and the DOE) as
serts that it is committed to a
vast program of rapid energy
development on Indian lands,
but its vision of progress is an in
creased dependence on money,
not sustaining people from the
land. The leaders of CERT wish
to incorporate their people into
the 'modern' world as a means
of economic survival. If this
threatens to contaminate more
underground water, kill a few
more miners from radiation ex
posure or destroy a couple
thousand more acres of the frag
ile desert ecosystem forever,
it's a 'national sacrifice' that
must be tolerated.
But when the well(s) run dry
and the land is uninhabitable for
livestock or humans, where will
they go? In the words of Yakima
Reservation Tribal Coun
cilman, Russell Jim, regarding
the environmental degradation
that will result from further de

velopment, "Our lands may be
contaminated irretrievably . . .
I believe any of you gentlemen
will realize that for native
Americans, 'evacuation' from
their lands is meaningless."
If the traditionals gain
enough strength to have their
way and preserve their lands,
the U.S. will be hard put to de
crease their foreign dependence
on energy resources. If CERT
concessions continue in the
present manner in order to
prove energy for Americans,
the native Americans better
start looking for another place
to live.
The fallacy of the promise of
a modern standard of living for
Indian people who develop their
resource potential is that in giv
ing up traditional proven ways
of living (what little remains of
them) as a sacrifice for the in
dustrialist lifestyle, they burn
their bridges behind them. Full
entrance into mainstream
America will never be at
tainable, since a people can nev
er gain independence through a
system that is responsible for
their dependence and op
pression in the first place.
