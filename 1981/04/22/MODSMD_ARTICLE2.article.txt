# Encourage 'sense of community'
## COP winners celebrate, plan for future 
### Bill Beyda 
Chris Greene, Mariann Byerwalter,
Fred Buhl, and Dragan Popov waited
anxiously by the phone last Thursday
evening, wondering if they would be
ASSU Presidents Friday morning.
At 11:45 p.m., the phone rang.
Tension filled the room.
Greene answered the phone ner
vously and announced, "Mariann, it's
your Mom."
Some three hours later, however the
four were informed that they had won
the election. French champagne was
opened, and the new Council of Presi
dents toasted.
Happy, tired, and relieved,
Byerwalter reflected on the campaign
and the future: "It's been a long road,
but this is only the beginning."
Greene, a co-terminal senior, is
working towards his B.S. and M.S. in
Industrial Engineering. After trans
ferring to Stanford from Princeton,
Greene became active in the ASSU,
joining the Committee of Fifteen, a
ASSU legislative and judicial body,
and later chairing the Finance Com
mittee
Greene also worked actively in pre
paring the Coffee House bid, which
has turned into one of the ASSU's most
successful projects.
Greene said he hopes his knowledge
of the ASSU structure, particularly in
the area of finance, will help the new

COP work effectively next year. As a
senator, he proposed that all ASSU
committees meet at the same time
and place, a plan that has increased
the efficiency of the committees
throughout the year.
"Now most of the work gets done in
the committees instead of on the Sen
ate floor," Greene said.
"As presidents, we will encourage a
sense of community among the people
working in the ASSU," Greene said.
"With a unity of purpose, the ASSU
can actively serve the student body."
Buhl, a junior majoring in African
and Afro-American Studies, and Polit
ical Science, has worked extensively
in the black community. He has
worked for the Black Student Union,
and written for The Real News, the
campus black student newspaper.
In addition, Buhl said he has done "a
lot of speaking on campus." For in
stance, he spoke at the Martin Luther
King Day rally this year and at the
Africa Week rally last year.
Recently, he led the East Palo Alto
march in support of the families of the
slain Atlanta children.
A former ASSU Senator, Buhl said
he wants to "restore minority con
fidence in the ASSU." Buhl pointed out
the fact that few minorities currently
serve on committees or run for ASSU
offices. He said he wants to change

this.
In a statement after the final elec
tion results were received. Buhl said:
"To our brothers and sisters in the oth
er minority and Third World com
munities at Stanford, I strongly af
firm, our time has come. We will work
together to make Stanford a better
place for all its students."
Popov, a co-terminal senior, work
ing towards a B.S. in Human Biology
and an M.S. in Biology, was an ASSU
Projects Manager this year. He also
was active in organizing students
against waste.
"A lot of furniture and bicycles are
thrown out every year by seniors in
June," Popov said. "Why not store
them and make them available to
freshmen?"
Popov hopes the new presidents will
be able to improve the academic ad
vising program next year, an area
which has received many student
complaints. He also wants to en
courage more students to use the
Learning Assistance Center.
Byerwalter, a junior majoring in
Economics and Political Science, has
developed many ideas she hopes the
COP can turn into constructive pro
grams. Her experience in the ASSU
has had an academic focus and in
cludes organizing the Rhetorical Soci
ety and coaching the Debate Team.
Also, Byerwalter 's experience as an

Resident Assistant at Branner Hall
help keep her in touch with student
needs.
"We hope to take several programs,
such as Advising Associates and the
Western Culture programs, and ex
amine them," Byerwalter said.
Another of the COP's goals, accord
ing to Byerwalter, is to "enhance the
exchange of information among stu
dents and representatives."
