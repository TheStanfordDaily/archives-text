## An information bulletin, slightly revised 
### 
Some clerical workers who have been put
ting in a 40-hour week for years in return for
a wage they can't live on may never have
known what powerful friends they have in
high places. Previously treated mostly like
the waitress in a restaurant — essential, but
unseen — they suddenly find themselves the
recipients of the most solicitous attention
and an avalanche of mail.
One recent missive, addressed to their
"Dear Friends by Provost Albert Hastorf
and Vice President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy, arrived shortly after
the dust had settled — or turned to mud —
from President Donald Kennedy's letter.
This one sagely avoids the perilous shoals of
administrative confessions and instead con
centrates of providing "information." (We
have all understood by this time that "in
formation" is what comes from the admin
istration, whereas only rhetoric, bias and
propaganda emanate from the union.)
The information is presented in a ques
tion-and-answer format, in an arrangement
somewhat reminiscent of that of the lie de
tector test ("What is your name'' What did
you have for lunch? Did you bludgeon your
mother?"), and, for a document so obvious
ly objective, seems curiously incomplete. I
should like to offer a few addenda.
Q. How is a corporation like Stanford run?
A. Stanford is a family. We are governed
by our father, with the help of many uncles.
Q. What about affirmative action?
A. Not all of our uncles are white. One is
black and one is a woman.
Q. How do they govern?
A. They deeply cherish democracy and
maintain it with several hundred well-paid
staff officers and line officers.
Q. Would you say the staff are the troops?
A. That depends. Some are the enemy.
Q. What is the composition of the staff?
A. They are almost all supervisors.
Q. What is the definition of a supervisor?
A. Someone who may not talk about the
union.
Q. Where do you get your wonderful ideas
for warning workers about the coercive, in
vasive, freedom-depriving union and for
promising such open-handed pay raises six
weeks before an election?
A. We have available to us the expertise
of such organizations as Littler, Mendelson,
Fastiff & Tichy?
Q. What is LMF&T?
A. A professional corporation, univer
sally considered the biggest union-busting
firm west of the Mississippi, and the best.
Q. Doesn't that sort of thing cost a lot of
money?
A. It does, but we consider it a sound in
vestment — much better than distributing
equivalent funds to clericals who will
squander it on rent money that goes down

the drain.
Q. Would you be willing to divulge how
much money you save from going down the
drain that way?
A. We make it a policy to preserve the
confidentially of such matters to protect in
dividuals from invasion of privacy.
Q. Why would you have to resort to an out
side firm when you have a legal staff that
occupies two floors?
A. Our legal staff is not always adequate
to the magnitude of the task.
Q. It is said that Stanford spends huge
sums on legal work. The American Civil
Liberties Union, for instance, says that the
Franklin case will end up costing the Uni
versity about $1 million.
A That does not trouble us. We employ
the firm of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and
Enersen to handle the case.
Q. How does that affect the expenditure?
A. It helps two of the firm's partners,
Morris Doyle and Robert Minge Brown,
both Stanford trustees, to perform their role
as prudent investors and place Stanford's
money into something as safe as their own
coffers. It also makes it easier for them to
offer their services to the University
without pay, as trustees do. We have been
very active in educating our clericals to do
the same.
Q. You say Franklin was dismissed, de
spite tenure, for "incitement to violence."
How did you escalate the penalty for anoth
er professor when he, a few years later,
committed an act of violence and struck his
secretary when she was sitting at her type
writer, bloodying her face and breaking her
glasses?
A. As a measure of our concern, we fined
him $3000 from one year's salary and, as a
further deterrent, put him on two years'
probation, thus forbidding him to hit anoth
er secretary during that entire period. We
have been very successful. Although we
have had several murders and rapes in the
more dimly lit parts of our campus since,
not a single other secretary has had her face
bashed in by her supervisor.
Q. How do you reward your long-time em
ployees?
A. With sweeping lawns, raised petunia
plantings, self-circulating, energy-econo
mizing fountains and a loose dress code.
Q. Isn't that very generous of you?
A. Yes, but it has the enthusiastic support
of our many enlightened supervisors. We
feel that in an institution like Stanford, dedi
cated to humanistic values, that sort of psy
chic income is worth more than money.
To employees not threatening to unionize,
we offer a payscale that guarantees that no
one will receive an increase of less than zero
percent. A few of our most consistently ex
ceptional employees may even expect in
crements that will bring them close to keep
ing up with the cost of living.

Q But haven't you also shown in recent
charts that Stanford workers are paid sub
stantially more than their unionized col
leagues in the area''
A. So we have just discovered from a judi
cious mix of apples and oranges which we
have compiled in the interests of keeping
our treasured friends on the clerical staff
out of the clutches of a manipulative bu
reaucracy and from worshipping false gods
when they have us.
Q. Don't you also try to protect them from
having to pay one percent of their pay in
union dues?
A. We are doing our best.
Q. The union says dues are tax-deduc
tible, but the .75 percent of their salary
clericals now pay for parking is not.
A. For that sum all who come to work at
7:30 a.m. may park quite close to their of
fices. But we offer them a free choice. They
may pay less if they elect to park closer to
Mountain View or Redwood City.
Q. How can a charitable institution like
Stanford afford to pay the large salaries
that clericals want?
A. We can't. Stanford is very poor. We
own only 9000 acres, $1 billion and most of
the local courts. We have to borrow money
through AAA bonds.
Q. Do you know that there are depart
ments at Stanford where clerical workers
literally have to ask for permission from
their supervisors to go to the toilet?
A. No, and we don't want to.
Q. It is safe for such workers to be seen
talking to a union representative?
A. We maintain total freedom of informa
tion about the union, and they are at liberty
to consult their friends in the adminis
tration about it.
Q. If Stanford is as kind, considerate and
generous as you say it is, how come over
1000 clerical workers signed blue cards?
A. Because we had not yet at the time suc
ceeded in making known to our help how de
serving we are of their trust and faith, how
concerned about their friendship, well
being and democratic rights, and how we
want to put all our good will and integrity to
the task of protecting them from troubling
their pretty little heads about ways in which
the University should be run. But we are
working on it and we are sure that by May 7
we will have them in our camp. We are
shooting for it with all we have got.
Q. How have you managed to send around
for weeks, as you have, teams of lawyers
and administrators to give long talks at fac
ulty and department meetings and
supervisors' gatherings, all on company
time, at a cost of thousands of staff hours,
when the union must confine itself to ap
proaching workers only during their breaks
or lunch time or away from work?
A. Because we have got the power.

generous as you say it is, how come over
1000 clerical workers signed blue cards?
A. Because we had not yet at the time suc
ceeded in making known to our help how de
serving we are of their trust and faith, how
concerned about their friendship, well
being and democratic rights, and how we
want to put all our good will and integrity to
the task of protecting them from troubling
their pretty little heads about ways in which
the University should be run. But we are
working on it and we are sure that by May 7
we will have them in our camp. We are
shooting for it with all we have got.
Q. How have you managed to send around
for weeks, as you have, teams of lawyers
and administrators to give long talks at fac
ulty and department meetings and
supervisors' gatherings, all on company
time, at a cost of thousands of staff hours,
when the union must confine itself to ap
proaching workers only during their breaks
or lunch time or away from work?
A. Because we have got the power.
(Lis, (iiraud is a librarian at Cecil H. Green
Library.)
Some clerical workers who have been put
ting in a 40-hour week for years in return for
a wage they can't live on may never have
known what powerful friends they have in
high places. Previously treated mostly like
the waitress in a restaurant — essential, but
unseen — they suddenly find themselves the
recipients of the most solicitous attention
and an avalanche of mail.
One recent missive, addressed to their
"Dear Friends by Provost Albert Hastorf
and Vice President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy, arrived shortly after
the dust had settled — or turned to mud —
from President Donald Kennedy's letter.
This one sagely avoids the perilous shoals of
administrative confessions and instead con
centrates of providing "information." (We
have all understood by this time that "in
formation" is what comes from the admin
istration, whereas only rhetoric, bias and
propaganda emanate from the union.)
The information is presented in a ques
tion-and-answer format, in an arrangement
somewhat reminiscent of that of the lie de
tector test ("What is your name'' What did
you have for lunch? Did you bludgeon your
mother?"), and, for a document so obvious
ly objective, seems curiously incomplete. I
should like to offer a few addenda.
Q. How is a corporation like Stanford run?
A. Stanford is a family. We are governed
by our father, with the help of many uncles.
Q. What about affirmative action?
A. Not all of our uncles are white. One is
black and one is a woman.
Q. How do they govern?
A. They deeply cherish democracy and
maintain it with several hundred well-paid
staff officers and line officers.
Q. Would you say the staff are the troops?
A. That depends. Some are the enemy.
Q. What is the composition of the staff?
A. They are almost all supervisors.
Q. What is the definition of a supervisor?
A. Someone who may not talk about the
union.
Q. Where do you get your wonderful ideas
for warning workers about the coercive, in
vasive, freedom-depriving union and for
promising such open-handed pay raises six
weeks before an election?
A. We have available to us the expertise
of such organizations as Littler, Mendelson,
Fastiff & Tichy?
Q. What is LMF&T?
A. A professional corporation, univer
sally considered the biggest union-busting
firm west of the Mississippi, and the best.
Q. Doesn't that sort of thing cost a lot of
money?
A. It does, but we consider it a sound in
vestment — much better than distributing
equivalent funds to clericals who will
squander it on rent money that goes down

the drain.
Q. Would you be willing to divulge how
much money you save from going down the
drain that way?
A. We make it a policy to preserve the
confidentially of such matters to protect in
dividuals from invasion of privacy.
Q. Why would you have to resort to an out
side firm when you have a legal staff that
occupies two floors?
A. Our legal staff is not always adequate
to the magnitude of the task.
Q. It is said that Stanford spends huge
sums on legal work. The American Civil
Liberties Union, for instance, says that the
Franklin case will end up costing the Uni
versity about $1 million.
A That does not trouble us. We employ
the firm of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and
Enersen to handle the case.
Q. How does that affect the expenditure?
A. It helps two of the firm's partners,
Morris Doyle and Robert Minge Brown,
both Stanford trustees, to perform their role
as prudent investors and place Stanford's
money into something as safe as their own
coffers. It also makes it easier for them to
offer their services to the University
without pay, as trustees do. We have been
very active in educating our clericals to do
the same.
Q. You say Franklin was dismissed, de
spite tenure, for "incitement to violence."
How did you escalate the penalty for anoth
er professor when he, a few years later,
committed an act of violence and struck his
secretary when she was sitting at her type
writer, bloodying her face and breaking her
glasses?
A. As a measure of our concern, we fined
him $3000 from one year's salary and, as a
further deterrent, put him on two years'
probation, thus forbidding him to hit anoth
er secretary during that entire period. We
have been very successful. Although we
have had several murders and rapes in the
more dimly lit parts of our campus since,
not a single other secretary has had her face
bashed in by her supervisor.
Q. How do you reward your long-time em
ployees?
A. With sweeping lawns, raised petunia
plantings, self-circulating, energy-econo
mizing fountains and a loose dress code.
Q. Isn't that very generous of you?
A. Yes, but it has the enthusiastic support
of our many enlightened supervisors. We
feel that in an institution like Stanford, dedi
cated to humanistic values, that sort of psy
chic income is worth more than money.
To employees not threatening to unionize,
we offer a payscale that guarantees that no
one will receive an increase of less than zero
percent. A few of our most consistently ex
ceptional employees may even expect in
crements that will bring them close to keep
ing up with the cost of living.

Q But haven't you also shown in recent
charts that Stanford workers are paid sub
stantially more than their unionized col
leagues in the area''
A. So we have just discovered from a judi
cious mix of apples and oranges which we
have compiled in the interests of keeping
our treasured friends on the clerical staff
out of the clutches of a manipulative bu
reaucracy and from worshipping false gods
when they have us.
Q. Don't you also try to protect them from
having to pay one percent of their pay in
union dues?
A. We are doing our best.
Q. The union says dues are tax-deduc
tible, but the .75 percent of their salary
clericals now pay for parking is not.
A. For that sum all who come to work at
7:30 a.m. may park quite close to their of
fices. But we offer them a free choice. They
may pay less if they elect to park closer to
Mountain View or Redwood City.
Q. How can a charitable institution like
Stanford afford to pay the large salaries
that clericals want?
A. We can't. Stanford is very poor. We
own only 9000 acres, $1 billion and most of
the local courts. We have to borrow money
through AAA bonds.
Q. Do you know that there are depart
ments at Stanford where clerical workers
literally have to ask for permission from
their supervisors to go to the toilet?
A. No, and we don't want to.
Q. It is safe for such workers to be seen
talking to a union representative?
A. We maintain total freedom of informa
tion about the union, and they are at liberty
to consult their friends in the adminis
tration about it.
Q. If Stanford is as kind, considerate and
generous as you say it is, how come over
1000 clerical workers signed blue cards?

clericals now pay for parking is not.
A. For that sum all who come to work at
7:30 a.m. may park quite close to their of
fices. But we offer them a free choice. They
may pay less if they elect to park closer to
Mountain View or Redwood City.
Q. How can a charitable institution like
Stanford afford to pay the large salaries
that clericals want?
A. We can't. Stanford is very poor. We
own only 9000 acres, $1 billion and most of
the local courts. We have to borrow money
through AAA bonds.
Q. Do you know that there are depart
ments at Stanford where clerical workers
literally have to ask for permission from
their supervisors to go to the toilet?
A. No, and we don't want to.
Q. It is safe for such workers to be seen
talking to a union representative?
A. We maintain total freedom of informa
tion about the union, and they are at liberty
to consult their friends in the adminis
tration about it.
Q. If Stanford is as kind, considerate and
generous as you say it is, how come over
1000 clerical workers signed blue cards?
A. Because we had not yet at the time suc
ceeded in making known to our help how de
serving we are of their trust and faith, how
concerned about their friendship, well
being and democratic rights, and how we
want to put all our good will and integrity to
the task of protecting them from troubling
their pretty little heads about ways in which
the University should be run. But we are
working on it and we are sure that by May 7
we will have them in our camp. We are
shooting for it with all we have got.
Q. How have you managed to send around
for weeks, as you have, teams of lawyers
and administrators to give long talks at fac
ulty and department meetings and
supervisors' gatherings, all on company
time, at a cost of thousands of staff hours,
when the union must confine itself to ap
proaching workers only during their breaks
or lunch time or away from work?
A. Because we have got the power.
(Lis, (iiraud is a librarian at Cecil H. Green
Library.)
Some clerical workers who have been put
ting in a 40-hour week for years in return for
a wage they can't live on may never have
known what powerful friends they have in
high places. Previously treated mostly like
the waitress in a restaurant — essential, but
unseen — they suddenly find themselves the
recipients of the most solicitous attention
and an avalanche of mail.
One recent missive, addressed to their
"Dear Friends by Provost Albert Hastorf
and Vice President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy, arrived shortly after
the dust had settled — or turned to mud —
from President Donald Kennedy's letter.
This one sagely avoids the perilous shoals of
administrative confessions and instead con
centrates of providing "information." (We
have all understood by this time that "in
formation" is what comes from the admin
istration, whereas only rhetoric, bias and
propaganda emanate from the union.)
The information is presented in a ques
tion-and-answer format, in an arrangement
somewhat reminiscent of that of the lie de
tector test ("What is your name'' What did
you have for lunch? Did you bludgeon your
mother?"), and, for a document so obvious
ly objective, seems curiously incomplete. I
should like to offer a few addenda.
Q. How is a corporation like Stanford run?
A. Stanford is a family. We are governed
by our father, with the help of many uncles.
Q. What about affirmative action?
A. Not all of our uncles are white. One is
black and one is a woman.
Q. How do they govern?
A. They deeply cherish democracy and
maintain it with several hundred well-paid
staff officers and line officers.
Q. Would you say the staff are the troops?
A. That depends. Some are the enemy.
Q. What is the composition of the staff?
A. They are almost all supervisors.
Q. What is the definition of a supervisor?
A. Someone who may not talk about the
union.
Q. Where do you get your wonderful ideas
for warning workers about the coercive, in
vasive, freedom-depriving union and for
promising such open-handed pay raises six
weeks before an election?
A. We have available to us the expertise
of such organizations as Littler, Mendelson,
Fastiff & Tichy?
Q. What is LMF&T?
A. A professional corporation, univer
sally considered the biggest union-busting
firm west of the Mississippi, and the best.
Q. Doesn't that sort of thing cost a lot of
money?
A. It does, but we consider it a sound in
vestment — much better than distributing
equivalent funds to clericals who will
squander it on rent money that goes down

the drain.
Q. Would you be willing to divulge how
much money you save from going down the
drain that way?
A. We make it a policy to preserve the
confidentially of such matters to protect in
dividuals from invasion of privacy.
Q. Why would you have to resort to an out
side firm when you have a legal staff that
occupies two floors?
A. Our legal staff is not always adequate
to the magnitude of the task.
Q. It is said that Stanford spends huge
sums on legal work. The American Civil
Liberties Union, for instance, says that the
Franklin case will end up costing the Uni
versity about $1 million.
A That does not trouble us. We employ
the firm of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and
Enersen to handle the case.
Q. How does that affect the expenditure?
A. It helps two of the firm's partners,
Morris Doyle and Robert Minge Brown,
both Stanford trustees, to perform their role
as prudent investors and place Stanford's
money into something as safe as their own
coffers. It also makes it easier for them to
offer their services to the University
without pay, as trustees do. We have been
very active in educating our clericals to do
the same.
Q. You say Franklin was dismissed, de
spite tenure, for "incitement to violence."
How did you escalate the penalty for anoth
er professor when he, a few years later,
committed an act of violence and struck his
secretary when she was sitting at her type
writer, bloodying her face and breaking her
glasses?
A. As a measure of our concern, we fined
him $3000 from one year's salary and, as a
further deterrent, put him on two years'
probation, thus forbidding him to hit anoth
er secretary during that entire period. We
have been very successful. Although we
have had several murders and rapes in the
more dimly lit parts of our campus since,
not a single other secretary has had her face
bashed in by her supervisor.
Q. How do you reward your long-time em
ployees?
A. With sweeping lawns, raised petunia
plantings, self-circulating, energy-econo
mizing fountains and a loose dress code.
Q. Isn't that very generous of you?
A. Yes, but it has the enthusiastic support
of our many enlightened supervisors. We
feel that in an institution like Stanford, dedi
cated to humanistic values, that sort of psy
chic income is worth more than money.
To employees not threatening to unionize,
we offer a payscale that guarantees that no
one will receive an increase of less than zero
percent. A few of our most consistently ex
ceptional employees may even expect in
crements that will bring them close to keep
ing up with the cost of living.

Q But haven't you also shown in recent
charts that Stanford workers are paid sub
stantially more than their unionized col
leagues in the area''
A. So we have just discovered from a judi
cious mix of apples and oranges which we
have compiled in the interests of keeping
our treasured friends on the clerical staff
out of the clutches of a manipulative bu
reaucracy and from worshipping false gods
when they have us.
Q. Don't you also try to protect them from
having to pay one percent of their pay in
union dues?
A. We are doing our best.
Q. The union says dues are tax-deduc
tible, but the .75 percent of their salary
clericals now pay for parking is not.
A. For that sum all who come to work at
7:30 a.m. may park quite close to their of
fices. But we offer them a free choice. They
may pay less if they elect to park closer to
Mountain View or Redwood City.
Q. How can a charitable institution like
Stanford afford to pay the large salaries
that clericals want?
A. We can't. Stanford is very poor. We
own only 9000 acres, $1 billion and most of
the local courts. We have to borrow money
through AAA bonds.
Q. Do you know that there are depart
ments at Stanford where clerical workers
literally have to ask for permission from
their supervisors to go to the toilet?
A. No, and we don't want to.
Q. It is safe for such workers to be seen
talking to a union representative?
A. We maintain total freedom of informa
tion about the union, and they are at liberty
to consult their friends in the adminis
tration about it.
Q. If Stanford is as kind, considerate and
generous as you say it is, how come over
1000 clerical workers signed blue cards?

ceeded in making known to our help how de
serving we are of their trust and faith, how

being and democratic rights, and how we
