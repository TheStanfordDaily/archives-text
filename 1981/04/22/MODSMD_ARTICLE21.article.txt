I'm a co-op
It sure does feel good to be
clean! I feel like I've just been
through a car wash. My floors
are shiny, my carpets are clean
— I can't find a speck of dust
anywhere. Not that I'm usually
dirty, mind you. No sirreee. The
people who live here take great
care of me. It's just that they've
given me a special good clean
ing now, because the housing
draw's coming up and they want
people who come by to live here
next year.
You see, I'm a co-op. I do have
a name, but let's just say I could
be any one of the six cooperative
houses on campus. (Columbae,
Synergy, Theta Chi, Phi Psi,
Terra, and Hammarskjold). I
really like being a co-op, be
cause the people are so nice and
warm. I feel like otherwise I
might just be a house, but now
I'm really a home. All that fresh
hot bread, the late night kitchen
talks, the house meetings, the
hugs . . . well, just everything
that goes on here makes me feel
twenty years younger.

I've tried to figure out what
makes a co-op so special. It
could be tht the people who
come here are great before they
arrive, or that cooking, clean
ing, and playing together brings
out the best in them. My guess is
that it's a mixture os both. I've
seen people grow a lot during
the time they've called me
home, but I also notice a lot of
love in most of the people here
from the minute they walk in the
door. I guess I'd say that good
people doing cooperative things
makes for one great communi
ty-
Cooperation really is the key
to it all. Everyone here shares a
certain type of family-like con
cern for each other, even for
people who aren't their closes
friends. By cooking, cleaning
and administering their com
munity, they develop a sense of
unity that goes beyond hwo they
feel about each other individ
ually. Of course, there are a lot
of close bonds between individ
uals; in fact, I feel close friend
ship all inside me. All I'm trying

to get across is that there's a
certain atmosphere here that's
really special.
I'm a little embarassed to
mention it, but one final neat
thing about me, in addition to
the people and the atmosphere,
is that I'm beautiful. I have a
spacious roof, lots of common
space, and huge rooms. Of
course, physical beauty isn't the
only things, but it sure doesn't
hurt.
The more I think about it, the
more I'm convinced that you
should really come by and check
me out.
You see, I know that you'd
just love it here. I think that
anyone who likes people and like
to communicate with them
would love to live with me. The
other thing is that I just adore
company, so I hope you stop by,
even if you're not planning to
live here. I'll even give you a
tip: if you come at dinner time,
you'll meet all the neat folks.

Don't complain
The recently run political car
toons concerning the ASSU rep
resents a disturbing attitude
that is not uncommon among
students. It pains me to see such
a misguided perspective toward
an organization that belongs
solely to us. I'd like to offer a
more constructive view.
According to its Constitution,
the ASSU was established "in
order to advance our interests,
define our responsibilities, and
provide for our meaningful par
ticipation in the governance of
the University. . . ." The
purpose seems clear, and it is
evident that the organization
has made great strides in these
areas. Most recently, The Cof
fee House, Inc., and the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board
have demonstrated this dedi
cation by students to serve other
students and themselves. These

are, of course, in addition to the
numerous other services that
the ASSU has provided for
years: The Sunday Flicks, Lec
ture Notes. Legal Counseling,
and Typing, to name just a few.
Still, people seem unhappy with
their organization, so they
choose to complain about it,
seemingly to no avail.
No organization is without its
flaws and inefficiencies, and
certainly the ASSU is not im
mune to these; nevertheless, if
we simply sit back and criticize
it, when we have the power to
change it, aren't we then some
what responsible?
The ASSU is a great asset to
the students of Stanford. If there
is something wrong with it, it's
up to us, the students, to change
it. If we spent as much time im
proving the ASSU as we spend
complaining about it, the ser
vices it provides to the students
would be expanded and im
proved.

cause the people are so nice and
warm. I feel like otherwise I
might just be a house, but now
I'm really a home. All that fresh
hot bread, the late night kitchen
talks, the house meetings, the
hugs . . . well, just everything
that goes on here makes me feel
twenty years younger.

I've tried to figure out what
makes a co-op so special. It
could be tht the people who
come here are great before they
arrive, or that cooking, clean
ing, and playing together brings
out the best in them. My guess is
that it's a mixture os both. I've
seen people grow a lot during
the time they've called me
home, but I also notice a lot of
love in most of the people here
from the minute they walk in the
door. I guess I'd say that good
people doing cooperative things
makes for one great communi
ty-
Cooperation really is the key
to it all. Everyone here shares a
certain type of family-like con
cern for each other, even for
people who aren't their closes
friends. By cooking, cleaning
and administering their com
munity, they develop a sense of
unity that goes beyond hwo they
feel about each other individ
ually. Of course, there are a lot
of close bonds between individ
uals; in fact, I feel close friend
ship all inside me. All I'm trying

to get across is that there's a
certain atmosphere here that's
really special.
I'm a little embarassed to
mention it, but one final neat
thing about me, in addition to
the people and the atmosphere,
is that I'm beautiful. I have a
spacious roof, lots of common
space, and huge rooms. Of
course, physical beauty isn't the
only things, but it sure doesn't
hurt.
The more I think about it, the
more I'm convinced that you
should really come by and check
me out.
You see, I know that you'd
just love it here. I think that
anyone who likes people and like
to communicate with them
would love to live with me. The
other thing is that I just adore
company, so I hope you stop by,
even if you're not planning to
live here. I'll even give you a
tip: if you come at dinner time,
you'll meet all the neat folks.

Don't complain
The recently run political car
toons concerning the ASSU rep
resents a disturbing attitude
that is not uncommon among
students. It pains me to see such
a misguided perspective toward
an organization that belongs
solely to us. I'd like to offer a
more constructive view.
According to its Constitution,
the ASSU was established "in
order to advance our interests,
define our responsibilities, and
provide for our meaningful par
ticipation in the governance of
the University. . . ." The
purpose seems clear, and it is
evident that the organization
has made great strides in these
areas. Most recently, The Cof
fee House, Inc., and the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board
have demonstrated this dedi
cation by students to serve other
students and themselves. These

are, of course, in addition to the
numerous other services that
the ASSU has provided for
years: The Sunday Flicks, Lec
ture Notes. Legal Counseling,
and Typing, to name just a few.
Still, people seem unhappy with
their organization, so they
choose to complain about it,
seemingly to no avail.
No organization is without its
flaws and inefficiencies, and
certainly the ASSU is not im
mune to these; nevertheless, if
we simply sit back and criticize
it, when we have the power to
change it, aren't we then some
what responsible?
The ASSU is a great asset to
the students of Stanford. If there
is something wrong with it, it's
up to us, the students, to change
it. If we spent as much time im
proving the ASSU as we spend
complaining about it, the ser
vices it provides to the students
would be expanded and im
proved.

I'm a co-op
It sure does feel good to be
clean! I feel like I've just been
through a car wash. My floors
are shiny, my carpets are clean
— I can't find a speck of dust
anywhere. Not that I'm usually
dirty, mind you. No sirreee. The
people who live here take great
care of me. It's just that they've
given me a special good clean
ing now, because the housing
draw's coming up and they want
people who come by to live here
next year.
You see, I'm a co-op. I do have
a name, but let's just say I could
be any one of the six cooperative
houses on campus. (Columbae,
Synergy, Theta Chi, Phi Psi,
Terra, and Hammarskjold). I
really like being a co-op, be
cause the people are so nice and
warm. I feel like otherwise I
might just be a house, but now
I'm really a home. All that fresh
