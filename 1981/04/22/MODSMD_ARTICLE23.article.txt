## NAACP drops forced busing case 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — NAACP at
torneys gave up their attempt to
keep 7000 unwilling students in
the Los Angeles school busing
program for the rest of the se
mester after most of the young
sters returned Monday morning
to neighborhood schools.
Saying the issue was moot,
the lawyers asked U.S. Supreme
Court Justice William Rehn
quist to disregard the NAACP's
request for an order blocking
the transfers.
The NAACP filed the last
minute request for a stay Sun
day, hoping for an immediate
ruling from Rehnquist, the jus
tice who handles emergency
petitions from California But
Rehnquist then gave Board of
Education attorneys until today
to file their arguments against
the request before he issued a
ruling.
NAACP attorney Joseph Duff
said Monday that the group
didn't want to add to the disrup
tion created by the mid-semes
ter transers that followed anoth
er court ruling. But the NAACP
will continue its legal battle to
revive mandatory busing by the
start of the fall semester, he

said.
Students found most ev
erything in order when they re
ported to school Monday, in
spite of a confusing weekend of
activity in the courts. Few prob
lems arose in student and teach
er assignments, although some
inconvenience and disgruntle
ment were reported.
A few schools had more stu
dents return from the busing
program than were expected.
After a state court ruling re
lesed it from a mandatory bus
ing order, the Board of Educa
tion voted March 16 to let stu
dents return voluntarily to their
neighborhood schools or choose
to continue riding buses in the
desegregation program through
June 12, when the semester
ends. School officials had en
couraged students to remain
where they were for educational
reasons, and about 70 percent,
or 15,700, elected to stay in the
program.
Last minute change
Some principals speculated
Monday that more students and
parents decided to transfer fol
lowing the past weekend's legal
wrangling.
On Friday a U.S. District

Judge in Los Angeles ordered
the transfers halted. On Satur
day a federal appeals court
vacated the order; on Sunday
the NAACP went to Rehnquist
but failed to get the order re
instated.
Also Sunday, the California
Supreme Court rejected an ap
peal through'the state courts.
The busing program now
ended was limited compared to
others around the country.
About 23,000 students were
bused to 153 schools, and a total
of 57,000 were affected the pro
gram in grades one through nine
this year.
Hearing tomorrow
The next move will be in fed
eral court here tomorrow, when
a hearing is scheduled before
District Court Judge Wallace
Tashima. He is the judge who
ordered the transfers stopped
last Friday, saying the board's
policy and the intent and effect
of segregation. His ruling was
overturned on Saturday.
NAACP attorneys contend
that the board is guilty of inten
tional segregation by its policies
and thus subject the mandatory
desegregation under federal
court decisions.

First Rehnquist must decide
on the group's request to
withdraw its petition for review
to the Supreme Court, how
ever. Normally such a request is
routinely approved, but Rehn
quist is a noted advocate of
states rights and some lawyers
familiar with the have sug
gested he may make a
statement about the federal ju
risdiction in the case.
Duff said that any statement
by Rehnquist would not be bind
ing.
New judge
Lawyers in the state court
case are scheduled Thursday to
appear before the new Los An
geles Superior Court judge ap
pointed to supervise the board's
desegregation efforts, Robert
Lopez.
Lopez must grapple with the
legal remains of a ruling last
December by the state Court of
Appeal that freed the board
from all mandatory busing or
ders. Lopez replaces Judge Paul
Egly, who withdrew from the
case last month after the Cali
fornia Supreme Court refused to
hear an appeal of the Court of
Appeal ruling.
Lopez has to decide what
remedies are appropriate under
the Court of Appeal ruling,
which found that Proposition 1,
passed by voters in 1979, is con
stitutional and prohibits man
datory busing currently in Los
Angeles. Mandatory busing
could be required agian if there
is a new finding that the school
board is guilty of intentional, or
de jure, segregation.

which found that Proposition 1,
passed by voters in 1979, is con
stitutional and prohibits man
datory busing currently in Los
Angeles. Mandatory busing
could be required agian if there
is a new finding that the school
board is guilty of intentional, or
de jure, segregation.
Los Angeles — NAACP at
torneys gave up their attempt to
keep 7000 unwilling students in
the Los Angeles school busing
program for the rest of the se
mester after most of the young
sters returned Monday morning
to neighborhood schools.
Saying the issue was moot,
the lawyers asked U.S. Supreme
Court Justice William Rehn
quist to disregard the NAACP's
request for an order blocking
the transfers.
The NAACP filed the last
minute request for a stay Sun
day, hoping for an immediate
ruling from Rehnquist, the jus
tice who handles emergency
petitions from California But
Rehnquist then gave Board of
Education attorneys until today
to file their arguments against
the request before he issued a
ruling.
NAACP attorney Joseph Duff
said Monday that the group
didn't want to add to the disrup
tion created by the mid-semes
ter transers that followed anoth
er court ruling. But the NAACP
will continue its legal battle to
revive mandatory busing by the
start of the fall semester, he

said.
Students found most ev
erything in order when they re
ported to school Monday, in
spite of a confusing weekend of
activity in the courts. Few prob
lems arose in student and teach
er assignments, although some
inconvenience and disgruntle
ment were reported.
A few schools had more stu
dents return from the busing
program than were expected.
After a state court ruling re
lesed it from a mandatory bus
ing order, the Board of Educa
tion voted March 16 to let stu
dents return voluntarily to their
neighborhood schools or choose
to continue riding buses in the
desegregation program through
June 12, when the semester
ends. School officials had en
couraged students to remain
where they were for educational
reasons, and about 70 percent,
or 15,700, elected to stay in the
program.
Last minute change
Some principals speculated
Monday that more students and
parents decided to transfer fol
lowing the past weekend's legal
wrangling.
On Friday a U.S. District

Judge in Los Angeles ordered
the transfers halted. On Satur
day a federal appeals court
vacated the order; on Sunday
the NAACP went to Rehnquist
but failed to get the order re
instated.
Also Sunday, the California
Supreme Court rejected an ap
peal through'the state courts.
The busing program now
ended was limited compared to
others around the country.
About 23,000 students were
bused to 153 schools, and a total
of 57,000 were affected the pro
gram in grades one through nine
this year.
Hearing tomorrow
The next move will be in fed
eral court here tomorrow, when
a hearing is scheduled before
District Court Judge Wallace
Tashima. He is the judge who
ordered the transfers stopped
last Friday, saying the board's
policy and the intent and effect
of segregation. His ruling was
overturned on Saturday.
NAACP attorneys contend
that the board is guilty of inten
tional segregation by its policies
and thus subject the mandatory
desegregation under federal
court decisions.

First Rehnquist must decide
on the group's request to
withdraw its petition for review
to the Supreme Court, how
ever. Normally such a request is
routinely approved, but Rehn
quist is a noted advocate of
states rights and some lawyers
familiar with the have sug
gested he may make a
statement about the federal ju
risdiction in the case.
Duff said that any statement
by Rehnquist would not be bind
ing.
New judge
Lawyers in the state court
case are scheduled Thursday to
appear before the new Los An
geles Superior Court judge ap
pointed to supervise the board's
desegregation efforts, Robert
Lopez.
Lopez must grapple with the
legal remains of a ruling last
December by the state Court of
Appeal that freed the board
from all mandatory busing or
ders. Lopez replaces Judge Paul
Egly, who withdrew from the
case last month after the Cali
fornia Supreme Court refused to
hear an appeal of the Court of
Appeal ruling.
Lopez has to decide what
remedies are appropriate under
the Court of Appeal ruling,
which found that Proposition 1,
passed by voters in 1979, is con
stitutional and prohibits man
datory busing currently in Los
Angeles. Mandatory busing
could be required agian if there
