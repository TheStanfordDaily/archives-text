Scene of the crime
Ann Arbor city detectives work in the hall of Bursley Dormitory on the University of Michigan
campus where two students were shot to death early last Friday morning. A 22-year-old psy
chology major — reportedly "high on pills" — has been arrested in connection with the shotgun
killings.
