# New caucus formed to promote 'Sun Belt'
## 
### Washington Post 
Regional warfare in Congress
has escalated with the creation
of a Sun Belt Council designed to
prevent the Northeast and
Midwest from taking too big a
piece of the federal budget.
More than 90 House members
from 17 southern and south
western states have joined
forces to counterattack the
Northeast-Midwest Coalition
and what they believe has been a
significant shift in the flow of
federal funds from their region
to the North.
"We really resisted forming
it, but we felt it was forced on us
by our Northeast and Midwest
colleagues, who have a case of
terminal paranoia," said Rep.
Charles Wilson (D-Texas) the
council chairman. "They blame
all the problems of their area on
the formula for federal grants,
which is pretty absurd,"
John Buchanan, a former Ala
bama congressman who is serv
ing as the council's staff direc
tor, called the new caucus "a
counterforce, not so much to
serve regional interests of the
Sun Belt, but to protect the rest
of the country from the highly
effective efforts of the North
east-Midwest Coalition on
behalf of their region, usually at

the expense ot the rest of the
country."
Budget not tilted
Said Rep. Bob Edgar (D-Pa.)
chairman of the Northeast-
Midwest Coalition. "If they are
organizing out of fear that we
were winning too many battles,
I appreciate that compliment,
but as I look at the Reagan
budget it doesn't look as though
it's tilted from South to North."
Edgar's group has argued
that President Ronald Reagan's
proposed budget cuts will fall
most heavily on the Frost Belt,
and is organizing to soften the

blows as the budget makes its
way through Congress.
Buchanan said the Sun Belt
Council, which disagrees with
its northern brethren on the bias
in the Reagan budget, will try to
prevent the North from having
its way in the distribution of the
cuts.
Reverse spending policy
He said the new caucus will
work to reverse a policy that
now targets defense spending to
areas of high unemployment,
tight to get a larger share of
energy assistance funds, which

now go more to the colder
northern states, and argue that
proposed cuts in welfare actual
ly fall more heavily on the large
ly black, rural poor in the South
rather than welfare recipients
in the North.
"Sun Belt is really an un
fortunate term," Buchanan
said, "because it fosters the im
age of states prospering at the
expense of the East and
Midwest. The reality is that
some (Sun Belt) states are
doing very well and others are
not doing well at all."
