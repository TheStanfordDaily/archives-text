# Body discovered near Atlanta

### Washington Post 
Atlanta — The naked body of a black person at
least 15 years old was found on the banks of the
Chattahoochee River Monday about 20 miles
southwest of Atlanta in Fulton County.
Authorities were unable to determine whether
the badly decomposed body, found on a sandbar by
a farmer clearing his riverfront property, was
that of a male or female, adult or child.
"We kind of think it's a male" over 15 years old.
"but we don't know for sure," said Fulton County
Police Chief Clinton Chafin as he walked up the
river bank after an ambulance took the body to the
county morgue.
Police were treating the case as a probable

homicide connected to the murders of 24 black
youths in the last 21 months and the disappearance
of one 10-year-old boy.
"With all the (killings) going on, we're gonna
treat it like (a murder)," said Chafin. "We have
to assume it fits the pattern, until we find out oth
erwise."
Monday's discovery came one day after the
body of 15-year-old Joseph Bell was pulled from
the South River in DeKalb County. Bell had been
missing since March 2. A special task force in
vestigating the disappearances and murders is
still seeking Darron Glass, 10, who disappeared in
September.
