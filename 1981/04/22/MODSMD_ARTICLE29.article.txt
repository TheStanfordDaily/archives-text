# Lambert gets hat trick
## Poloists tie Yugoslavians, 10-10 
### Sally Jenkins 
The Yugoslavian national water polo
players made a rather disgruntled look
ing group as they left DeGuerre pool Sun
day afternoon, unable to manage more
than a 10-10 tie with the Stanford
Cardinals.
The Yugoslavs, silver medalists at the
1980 Olympics, are in the Bay Area train
ing for the Fina II Cup, to be played this
weekend in Los Angeles. There they will
meet the top eight teams in the world;
the Russian and American national
teams will both be present. Three mem
bers of the Stanford squad also compete
with the national team; senior John
Gansel, who made his last appearance
for Stanford on Sunday, and juniors
James Bergesen and Jody Campbell.
Bill Taylor, who won a starting posi
tion last season for his clutch play,
proved that he hasn't lost his touch. With
the score 10-9 and only 19 seconds re
maining the junior found a hole and
slipped the ball into the cage.
Goalie Gansel showed why he is con
sidered the best in the world, preserving
the tie with one of his many spectacular
saves of the day: a last minute diving
block across the face of the cage to stop a
bullet from penetrating the high left cor
ner.
The Cardinals built an 8-5 lead over the

course of the third period, breaking a 5-5
halftime tie. Sophomore Greg Lambert
scored all three goals, with the as
sistance of the ever-present and all
knowing hole man, Campbell — who was
virtually handcuffed by the physical play
inside, at times unable to move his arms
for the Yugoslavian death grip around
his shoulders. With five minutes remain
ing in the period the Yugoslavian goalie
smothered a Campbell attempt only to
lose the ball to Lambert, who slammed it
home, breaking the tie.
A replay of the situation occurred only
30 seconds later, when Lambert once
again picked up a Campbell ball in man
up advantage, and tossed it into the cage,
making the score 7-5. The Yugoslavians
put themselves in real trouble a minute
later when another of their players was
ejected for 45 seconds, and Lambert
went cross-cage for the score.
The national team retaliated with
three goals of their own in less than a full
minute. With 25 seconds left in the period
a post man found that he couldn't go
through Gansel, so lobbed the ball over
his head and found the goal.
With 40 seconds gone in the fourth peri
od the Yugoslavs found the mark again,
twice, while the Cardinals failed to con
vert on two man-up situations. They then
produced two more unanswered goals as
the Cards consistently turned the ball

over with sloppy play, giving the Yugo
slavs so many opportunities they could
hardly help but score.
They scored their final goal with four
minutes remaining on yet another coun
terattack coming off a man-short disad
vantage. The Cardinals failed to convert,
only to watch a Yugoslavian post man
fire the ball through Gansel's hands.
James Bergesen converted a freebie
penalty shot, firing the ball to the high
left corner, to give some momentum
back to Stanford. The defense stiffened,
giving the offense the opportunities it
needed to find a break — at which point
Bill Taylor scored, and Gansel went into
his dance routine.
Though the game was more physical
than the Cardinals are generally used to,
they found most of the Yugoslavians to
be friendly. "One guy poked me in the
eye on the way down-pool, and he stopped
and said 'Oh excuse me, excuse me,' "
Mouchawar said.
The Cardinals were as startled by the
outcome as the Yugoslavians. "I had no
idea what to expect," said field man Alan
Mouchawar, "all I knew was that we
wouldn't beat them. It's exciting to know
that we can tie a silver medalist team, I
think that's particularly impressive. No
other college team in the world could do
that."

The Stanford water polo team tied the Yugoslavian national 1980 Olympic silver medalist
team Sunday afternoon, 10-10. Senior goalie John Gansel was instrumental in preserving the
tie, consistently blocking the Yugoslavians' last gasp attempts to score a winning goal. It was
Gansel's last appearance at deGuerre Pool, but he will continue to play competitive water
