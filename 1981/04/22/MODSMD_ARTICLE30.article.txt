legiate champion UC-Santa
Barbara outshot Stanford en
route to a 14-12 victory in a
lacrosse game played at de-
Guerre field this past Saturday.
The Cardinals led 7-6 at half
time, but UCSB dominated the

pivotal third quarter, and pulled
ahead, 11-8. The Cards waged a
rally in the final period, but
were unable to catch Santa
Barbara.
Captain Kirk Phelps led the
Cardinal offense, registering
six of the first seven Stanford
goals. He assisted Peter Hoberg

on the seventh. Midfielder Chris
Romer scored on a solo drive
early in the third quarter, but
the Cards were then able to
muster only five more shots.
UCSB, meanwhile, riddled
Stanford goalie Denny Childs
with 21 shots. Attackman J.C.
Reed fired most of those shots,
and scored four of the five Santa
Barbara third quarter goals.
Fourteen minutes of penal
ties plagued Stanford as UCSB
was able to capitalize on seven
"man-up" situations. Two of
these goals came early in the
fourth quarter. Stanford fought
back, though, with Phelps,
Romer, and middie Scott F arley
each scoring a goal.
At 13 :15 in the final period, co
captain Dickie Taylor picked up
a loose ball in front of the net

and slipped it past UCSB goalie
Joe Fedyshyn. That made it
13-12, in tavor of UCSB, with
nearly two minutes remaining
in the game.
Cardinal middie Graham
Winton fed the ball to Phelps,
who fired a shot going across the
crease. Fedyshyn came out of
the goal and made a spectacular
save, his fifteenth of the game.
UCSB came up with the loose
ball, and with 10 seconds left,
scored once more as goalie Den
ny Childs went out to the re
straining line to challenge the
UCSB attack.
The loss snapped a three
game Cardinal winning streak,
and dropped their record to 6-2.
Stanford is now 1-1 against other
college teams.
