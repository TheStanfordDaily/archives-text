The Stanford women's varsi
ty crew team went undefeated
over the weekend, generating a
great deal of optimism for suc
cess in their attempt to try and
compete with the big buoys on
the block, California and Wash
ington. The Lady Cardinals took
all five races they competed in,
but their biggest win came
against UCLA on Sunday.

The women won by 10.3 sec
onds, tacking over two seconds
onto the the Cal gals margin of
victory over the Bruins the day
before. "We were very
pleased," said women's coach
John Davis. "It's very difficult
to know what (a statistic like)
that means, when you're going
up agaisnt national caliber crew
teams, but there's a good possi
bility that we're at least in the
ballpark with them. We've im
proved very much over the last
two weeks, and hope to use last
weekend as a springboard to im
prove further."
On Friday, the Cards beat
Loyola and UC-Davis, and on
Saturday, they put two more
victories under their belt, beai.
ing Davis again, and Long
Beach.
The women's novice team
also competed well, beating the
lightweight varsity from Long
Beach twice, as well as the sec
ond varsity boat from Santa
Barbara. Their only loss came

at the hands of the novice team
from UCLA.
The men's crew team was
also in action this weekend,
against Loyola and Long Beach.
On Friday, the varsity, JV, and
lightweight four all won races
against Loyola. The following
day, they didn't fare as well,
with only the varsity winning
against Long Beach.

The Stanford men's volleyball
team fell to third-ranked UC-
Santa Barbara Saturday night in
four games, 6-15, 15-4, 15-10,
15-9. Head coach Fred Sturm
cited four players for their in
spiring play: John McColl, Ran
dy Smith, Peter Schapiro, and
Kip Engen.
The Cardinals will face the
University of Hawaii tonight at
Maples Pavilion beginning at
7:30 p.m. The game will be na
tionally televised on a tape de
lay sometime next week by
ESPN, the cable sports
network. According to Sturm
the two squads are equally
matched in strength, which
should provide for an interest
ing match.

UCSB also prevailed in the
cycling arena Saturday, as they
hosted and won their own tour
ney. The Cardinals took second,
however, and defeated the tired
team the next day at a series of
