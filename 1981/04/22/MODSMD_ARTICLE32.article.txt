# Card nine takes Stanislaus State

### Andy Nuss 
The Stanford baseball team disposed of its division-II opponent
Stanislaus State with ease on Monday, winning 10-7 at Sunken
Diamond. In fact, it seemed that the only source of concern for the
Cardinals was whether or not the game would get started on time.
Mike Sullivan, the right-handed reliever who recorded the save
against the Warriors, said after the game, "We were all worried be
cause the Stanislaus bus driver locked his keys in the bus and it took
them over an hour to get the players out."
Bob Hausladen, who substituted at catcher for Bill Worden,
showed immediately what it means to hit in the cleanup position. He
cleared the bases with a three-run homer to right field in his first at
bat.
Shortstop Dave Meier followed with a home run to left field and
it was already apparent that the Warriors could not match up
against Stanford's power.
By the end of six innings Stanford had coasted to a 9-0 lead on
timely hitting and Paul Grame's near-perfect pitching per
formance. Though the final margin of victory was only three runs,
the game was never really in doubt after the first inning.
Grame picked up the win for the Cards, pitching six innings, and
giving up only one hit, three walks, and no runs.
Dave Meier homered twice, boosting his season total to eight and
placing him second on the team, behind only Bill Worden. Darryl
Stephens scored the eventual game winning run in the sixth inning
on Mike Toothman's RBI single to center field.
