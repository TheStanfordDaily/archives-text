## Tracksters trounced twice 
### Paul Brewer 
The Cardinal men's track
squad knew it was in for a
"learning experience" as it
headed south for a dual meet
with ever-powerful UCLA. And
the Bruins, the only undefeated
dual meet team around, taught
the Stanford team its antici
apated lessson by trouncing the
Cards. 115-35.
Saturday's meet, held at
UCLA's Drake Stadium,
marked the end of a "sucide two
weeks" of competition for the
Cards as they were defeated by
Arizona State by the almost
identical score of 116-36 in
Tempe the week before. These
two southern opponents, along
with the Cal Bears (whom Stan
ford will meet in the Big Meet on
May 2), are probably among the
top five dual meet teams in the
nation. So the young Stanford
contingent can at least console
itself with the fact that it has as
tough a 1981 schedule as any col
lege team in the United States.
Despite going scoreless in
seven of the 18 track and field
events at UCLA, the Cards were
able to muster up a few good in
idvidual performances. Distan
ceman Rod Berry, recovering
quickly from a recent bout with
pneumonia, provided an early
bright spot by winning the
steeplechase in 9:12.7. In the
only other event won by a Stan
ford competitor, John Schaer
took the 1500 meters in a re
spectable 3:53.2. Garry
Shumway, usually a hurdler,
scored the only Stanford sprint
points.
