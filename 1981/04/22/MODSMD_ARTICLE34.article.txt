Japan to reduce car exports
Washington — The Japanese government yesterday asked its
auto industry to reduce car exports to the United States volun
tarily by 7 percent this year, according to press reports from To
kyo — a cutback of 120.000 vehicles that apparently stops well
short of what Congress and the U.S. auto industry have been seek
ing
As Japanese trade officials began a series of conferences with
that country's auto producers. U.S. Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige said here that Japan is waiting for more evi
dence of sacrifice by American automakers and the United Auto
Workers union to help the U.S. industry recover
' The Japanese government and industry might decide to make
a token effort, which in turn might be interpreted that way" on
Capitol Hill, he said Such an effort, he said, probably would lead
to legislated import quotas from Congress — an outcome the Rea
gan administration deeply hopes to avoid
Two Japanese news services reported that the Ministry of In
ternational Trade and Industry had asked Japanese automakers
to hold exports to the United States to 1.7 million units this year
and next, compared with the 1.82 million shipped in 1980
Because of the hands-off policy that the Reagan administration
is officially committed to. Baldrige would not indicate what an
acceptable import number would be. nor would he suggest con
cessions that the American companies and the UAW might make
to move the auto dispute further toward resolution
The problem is that the American companies believe they've
sacrificed enough already, and UAW leaders cannot make wage
concessions in advance of the local elections scheduled for May
and June, he said
Violence follows hunger strike
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Rioters threw acid bombs at police
in Londonderry yesterday, and the British government stood firm
on its stand not to grant concessions to end the hunger strike by
jailed IRA guerrilla Bobby Sands.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on a state visit to Saudi
Arabia, rejected a plea by three Irish legislators to meet with
them and consider Sands' demand that imprisoned IRA members
be given political-prisoner status Medical officials said Sands,
who campaigned from his jail cell and was elected to the British
Parliament in an April 9 by-election, was slipping fast and proba
bly would die within five or six days.
Authorities said seven policemen were treated for burns suf
fered when they were hit by bottles filled with acid and thrown by
rioters in Londonderry's Bogside district. They said the
chemicals may have been stolen from schools, but the acid was
not identified.
The officials also reported a youth underwent surgery for a
head wound apparently caused by one of the rubber bullets fired
by the anti-riot police and British soldiers.
It was the first time in several years that demonstrators used
acid bombs against police in Northern Ireland. In addition to the
acid, an estimated 100 youths hurled gasoline bombs and bricks
and set two mail trucks afire in the seventh day of rioting in this
strife-torn British province
Sands was sentenced in 1976 to 14 years in prison after a
shootout with police. His family said the 27-vear-old IRA gunman
was suffering from severe headaches, failing eyesight and hear
ing as a result of his hunger strike
Supreme Court rules on jury selection
Washington — Acting in a criminal case that involved claims of
jury bias against Mexicans, the Supreme Court ruled yesterday
that defendants do not have an automatic right to insist that
potential jurors be examined tor signs of racial or ethnic preju
dice
Rather, the Court held, it is generally up to trial judges to de

cide. based upon the particular facts of each individual criminal
case, whether there are enough racial overtones to make such
questioning necessary.
The justices voted 6-3 to uphold the conviction of a Mexican
man. Humberto Rosales-Lopez, on alien smuggling charges Af
ter he was convicted in U.S. District Court in San Diego in 1979,
Rosales-Lopez was given a 30-year suspended sentence, placed on
parole and deported to Mexico.
His lawyer appealed the conviction on grounds that Senior U.S.
District Judge Howard Corcoran, who presided over Rosales-
Lopez s trial, had failed to ask prospective jurors whether they
were biased against Mexicans Both a federal appeals court and
the Supreme Court ruled that Rosales-Lopez had no right to de
mand such an examination.
The courts decision settles a legal issue on which federal ap
peals courts across the nation had handed down conflicting rul
ings.
In a separate decision yesterday, the Court ruled that police
need a search warrant to enter one person's home to look for an
other person wanted for a crime
The 7-to-2 ruling still allows authorities with an arrest warrant
to force their way into the suspect's own home. But for the first
time, the Court said that the homes of others, friends or relatives
who might be hiding the suspect, are off-limits without a specific
search warrant
The decision is thus an important extension of the right to
privacy in the home Authorities, except when they are in "hot
pursuit." will have to go to a judge or magistrate and explain the
reasons for wanting the search before getting a warrant.
Sexual Harassment Discussed
Washington — The head of the Equal Employment Op
portunities Commission said yesterday that sexual harassment
on the job may be deeper and more widespread than his agency
knows.
Sexual harassment in the workplace is not a figment of the im
agination," said acting commissioner J. Clay Smith Jr. "It is a
real problem "
Also testifying was Phyllis Schlaflv, the militant opponent of
the Equal Rights Amendment for women, who said the EEOC
guidelines are "unjust because they penalize the innocent
bystander, the employer, for acts over which he has no control,
and because they allow unscrupulous persons to file mis
chievous claims."
In more detailed testimony given the subcommittee. Schlafly
also said if a woman is sexually propositioned on the job, it is most
often because she invites such attention.
For the "virtuous woman" said Schafly, sexual harassment is
not a problem "except in the rarest of cases."
"When a women walks across the room," she said, "she speaks
with a universal body language that most men intuitively under
stand.
"Men hardly ever ask sexual favors of women from whom the
certain answer is No,'" said Schlafly, who heads an organization
called the Eagle Forum organized in 1972 in opposition to feminist
groups like the National Organization for Women.
Acting EEOC chairman Smith, a Republican who is hoping to
be named permanently to the post, said there has been a steady
increase of sex discrimination cases in the federal courts.
Workmen exposed to nuclear waste
Tokyo — Fifty-six men were exposed to contaminated waste in
the nuclear power plant accident on the Sea of Japan and the
plant's executives may be indicted on criminal charges, the gov
ernment said yesterday.
In its first official statement on the accident, the Japan Atomic
Power Co said eight plant workers were immediately put to work
mopping up the spill with buckets and rags after it occurred
March 8. The statement said a subcontractor then supplied addi

tional moppers who worked for 15 more days
The utility said the cleaners, totaling 56 men. were exposed to
no more than 155 millirems of radioactivity, which puts the ex
posure level considerably under the government-set limit of 3000
millirems over a three-month period
However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, which regulates
Japan's nuclear power industry, disputed the company
statement It said it was likely the moppers were exposed to dan
gerous doses of contamination because the waste water had a rel
atively high level of contamination.
Minister of Trade and Industry Rokusuke Tanaka told the
Japan Times the company may have violated the Electricity Util
ity Industry Law by not reporting the spill when it first occurred,
and that its executives may be criminally charged
Reagan favors Saudi aircraft sale
Washington — Despite strong political opposition. President
Ronald Reagan has decided to go ahead with the sale to Saudi Ara
bia of a controversial military aircraft package including highly
sophisticated AWACS radar reconnaissance planes, the adminis
tration announced yesterday.
After the June 30 Israeli national election, well-informed
sources said the administration hopes that emotions generated by
the issue will have cooled and that it will be better able to placate
Israel's congressional supporters by assuring them that various
safeguards are in place against use of AWACS in ways harmful to
Israeli defense interests.
Successful completion of the deal is considered critical to the
administration's desire for continued close relations with Saudi
Arabia, which is this country's major supplier of crude oil and
also looms large in Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr.'s high
priority hopes of creating a force to counter Soviet pressure in the
strategically important Persian Gulf region.
