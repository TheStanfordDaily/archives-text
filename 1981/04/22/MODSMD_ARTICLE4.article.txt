# Mock quake rescue tests preparedness
## 
### Bill Beyda 
University President Donald Ken
nedy called the earthquake drill con
ducted yesterday a valuable ex
perience, although he admitted-a few
errors were committed.
Several problems encountered dur
ing the drill included communication
difficulties between students who
were relaying information on damage
conditions to a mock campus safety
command center.
Overall, Kennedy said "the level of
knowledge exhibited by the partici
pants in the rescue efforts was su
perb."
The big one
The drill is designed to prepare
Stanford for the "Big One," an earth
quake of 7 or greater magnitude on the
Richter scale that experts predict will
hit the Bay Area in the next decade.
If an earthquake of this magnitude
hit, Stanford would have to fend for
itself for up to four days, because most
highway overpasses would be de
stroyed — thus making it imposible
for relief equipment to reach the cam
pus.
If the water supply was cut off. stu
dents might have to drink water from
Lake Lagunita and the swimming
pools, both of which would be con
sidered safe enough in an emergency
situation.
The scenario of destruction in yes
terday's drill was made especially se
vere in order to challenge the Univer
sity's resources, according to Ken
nedy.
The supposed earthquake, of magni
tude 7.5 on the Richter Scale and cen
tered 15 miles northwest of campus,
posed many problems for the Public
Safety Department, the President's
office, and local hospitals.
A command center was set up at the
Public Safety Department to coordi
nate information gathering and rescue
missions and to inform the policy
group that met at the President's of
fice.
Marv Herrington, public safety de
partment chairman and campus po
lice chief, said "the drill went better
than expected. People knew more
about how to handle themselves than
we expected," he said.
Confusion reigns
At first, confusion reigned at Roble
Hall and Terman Engineering Center,
the sites picked to conduct the drill.
Students acting as victims waited for
help to arrive, and when it did, it was
not always of the type they needed.
The first rescue workers to arrive

were not medically trained personnel,
and, in some instances, they "killed"
and "injured" some students by han
dling the students improperly during
evacuation.
However, when a trained medical
personnel team arrived, first aid
evacuation proceeded smoothly, as a
registered nurse and a doctor worked
together to decide which cases needed
urgent care.
"The triage teams (the medical
personnel) were terrific," Diana Con
klin, director of Row Houses, said.
The victims were systematically
loaded on Facilities and Services
trucks, which delivered the victims to
local health care facilties — Stanford
Hospital, Cowell Student Health Cen
ter or Stanford Children's Hospital.
Dr. Jan Ehrenwerth, chairman of
the disaster committee at Stanford
Hospital, said she was pleased with
the hospital's performance. Of the 90
students sent to the Hospital, 24 un
derwent operations, and only two of
those would have "died" had their in
juries been real.
Ehrenwerth noted that areas for im
provement were in communications
and in the prompt unloading of
stretchers from the incoming trucks.
Damage to buildings
Heavy destruction was supposed to
have occurred in all of the older
dormitories — including Lagunita
Court, Branner, Toyon, and Roble
Halls — since it is thought the older
buildings would probably be less able
to survive a major earthquake.
In addition, the Old Chemistry
Building, Encina Commons, and parts
of the Quad which have not been
strengthened for a strong quake were
heavily damaged.
James Gere, co-director of the John
A. Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center and a civil engineering pro
fessor here, observed some of the op
erations at Roble Hall. "We're defi
nitely going to learn a lot from this
drill," Gere said.
Earlier this month, Gere told the
Daily that "The possibility of building
collapse exists but is definitely re
mote. The major danger would proba
bly be from falling objexts such as
light fixtures or ceiling tiles," he said.
In overestimating the severity of
the damage. University officials
hoped to get an idea of the worst they
would have to be prepared for. The
problems uncovered will be solved
before the "Big One" strikes. Thus,
the drill provided an experiment that
the Univesity hopes to analyze and use
to save lives in the future.
