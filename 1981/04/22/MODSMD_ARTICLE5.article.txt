# Changes in recycling center make trash into $4000 profit
## 
### Stephan Wassmann 
For the first time since it opened in
1977 the University recycling center
has broken its pattern of chronic
losses and has earned a profit.
The $4000 profit will have to go
toward paying off last year's debt of
$4685. However, Steve Lautze, center
co-manager, is very optimistic be
cause spring quarter is one of the most
productive recycling periods of the
year. He expects to more than com
pensate for the habitually low recycl
ing output of summer and winter quar
ters.
According to Lautze. the center's
student management and staff, which
has to be replaced every year, is most
experienced and efficient in spring. In
addition, by spring the students have
become moderately aware of the pro
gram.
"Last year, about $7000 of our ex
pense of $8000 was incurred in summer
and autumn, when people were the
least educated," Lautze said.
To account for the change in the cen
ter's performance, Lautz made sever
al suggestions.
For the first time the center has a
full-time site manager, Peter Brym.
who supervises the functioning of the
recycling site, located on Pampas
Lane, where the sorting of campus re
fuse occurs.
Brym. whom Lautze describes as
"very motivated and efficient." has
made it possible for the center to
switch from using six-ton to 10-ton col
lecting bins by constructing a sorting
platform. The platform expedites
loading of the trucks, which take re
cycled trash away from campus.
The center can now have a load of 30
tons hauled in three pickups at $35 per
pickup rather than in five.
In addition, the center decided six
weeks ago to terminate the labor-in
tensive service of sorting wine bottles
from other glass. Now all glass mate
rial is crushed and sold for $16 per ton

"The stacking process had become
very complicated and we were begin
ning to lose money from it," Lautze
said. He added that People Who Care
Recycling, which has purchased the
bottles from Stanford, will be going
out of business this summer.
Another improvement in campus
recycling came with a "white paper"
program, which began last August.
Every office on campus is now pro
vided with a box that carries detailed
instructions for sorting used office pa
per. This minimizes labor costs be

cause most of the sorting is carried out
by office employees.
Also, the recycling center recently
switched selling its computer paper
from Fiber Cycle Co. to Sunset Fiber.
The University receives a higher price
from Sunset Fiber.
Over the past two years the center
has expanded its personnel from 15 to
22 student workers. Two-thirds of
these workers are paid out of the cen
ter's budget. They receive $3.50 per
hour.
