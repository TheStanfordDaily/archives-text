Stanford's Values. Technol
ogy and Society (VTS)
program does not explain
engineering to the layman, nor
is its purpose to humanize the
engineer. Rather, the program
examines the interrelationships
between society and technolog
ical developments within a vari
ety of fields.
According to Robert McGinn,
a professor in the VTS depart
ment, the 10-year-old program
is "one of the few programs
with 'values' in its title. Most go
under the rubric of STS for Sci
ence, Technology, and Society.
"VTS is concerned with de
scribing technology 's role in so
ciety too; but VTS is especially
concerned with assessing it."
Stephen Kline, a professor in
mechanical engineering and
VTS agrees. " 'Values' is in the
Stanford program title because
although science is free of val
ues, its application is not. De
cisions about technology are
value-related."
The program primarily at
tempts to bridge gaps between
tiie disciplines. "There is noth
ing wrong with specialization,
but it can become a kind of cul
ture.' Specialists in different
fields have different visions of
the world. For example, those in

physics, chemistry and engi
neering want to quantify ev
erything. but if you are in psy
chology you can't do that."
Kline said.
The VTS department reflects
this integration of disciplines in
its faculty, boasting such pro
fessors as McGinn, who has a
Masters in mathematics, train
ing in engineering and a Ph D in
philosophy; Walter Vincetti, a
professor of aeronautics and
astronautics; Stephen Kline, a
professor of mechanical engi
neering; and Edwin Good of re
ligious studies.
VTS students are confronted
with real world issues such as
research on test-tube fertiliza
tion. weapons research and en
vironmental impact of technolo
gy. The students are challenged
to examine not only the techno
logical know-how involved, but
also the myriad social, political,
ethical, and human value con
siderations which are in
tertwined with technology
The faculty encourage cross
ing of fields in their courses. "I
like to put a few equations on the
board. Students expect some
classes to have no numbers,
some, only numbers. It's nice to
show that both can go together
in a harmonious way." McGee
said.

Kline teaches a VTS course
with students of several fields.
"The discussion is a dialogue
between technical and non-tech
nical students."
"It's not too easy to get peo
ple to respect other outlooks
People often refer to 'human
izing the engineers.' But it's
wrong to come down on engi
neers, The arrogance and ig
norance of humanists trying to
avoid science and technology
and putting it down is as regret
table as the narrowness of some
engineers." McGinn said.
The program also emphasizes
the importance of technology in
contemporary history. "In
dustrialization is one of. if not
the, most important
phenomenon of modern Western
society, because technology has
permitted changes even if it
hasn't caused them. There
wouldn't have been a women's
liberation movement without
industrialization," McGinn
said.
In designing classes, VTS co
ordinators strive to pool in
tellectual resources from the
arts and sciences, the past and
the future. According to Good.
"VTS realizes that many impor
tant problems in the modern
world — or the ancient one for
that matter — cannot be ex-

VTS studies also consider the
divergent effects of technology
in society and the future. For
McGinn. "In terms of interna
tional consciousness, technolo
gy holds the promise of over
coming national separatism be
cause of the communications
revolution, but technology has
also given countries the weap
ons and means to flex their na
tionalistic muscles."
McGinn refered to German
philosopher Friedrich Nietzshe
in considering this contem
porary issue: "Technology is a
double-edged sword, at once a
source of opportunities for
creative growth and of tempta
tions to inertial or dissipative
behavior."
