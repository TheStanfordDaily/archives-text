# New course to focus on professional ethics
## 
### Coleen Fitzpatrick 
You're a geotechnical en
gineer. You work for a
consulting firm. In the
process of working on a dam de
sign you confirm the existence
of an earthquake fault. You sud
denly realize that the end of the
fault underlies the site of a
future nuclear power plant. Do
you act according to your per
sonal code of ethics and social
responsibility as a professional
engineer and announce the dis
covery to the public? Or do your
primary obligations rest with
your employer, who may take
legal action against you if you
blow the whistle?
Problems such as this one will
be the focus of an under
graduate course entitled "Tech
nical Professionals and Ethics"
to be offered next autumn by the
program in Values. Technology,
and Society (VTS). The course
will be taught by Richard
Meehan. president and chief
civil engineer of Earth Sciences
Associates in Palo Alto, and a
consulting professor at Stan
ford.
Although Meehan has taught
graduate courses in the depart
ment of Applied Earth Sciences
for the last five years, this will
be his first undergraduate
course.
Explains Meehan, "There's
been so much interest in this
area from my grad students.
That's what really prompted me
to offer it as an undergraduate
course."
The tentative course outline
is divided into three parts: pro
fessionalism, the philosophy of
technical practice, and pro
fessional ethics.
According to Meehan. the
problem with professionals is
that society has allowed them to
limit access to a profession
forming a monopoly. But, he
said, "if you remove all licens
ing and totally destroy the idea
of any professional standards,
then can you ever depend on
anyone to act in accordance
with those standards?" Meehan
concluded that there is a lot of
confusion surrounding pro
fessionalism today.
There are no guidelines or
code of ethics among pro
fessionals. "There is no national
professional group out there
that is going to take young engi
neers and say. This is the way
it's done; this is the way you
should behave,' " Meehan said.
Consequently, Meehan said
he sees two possible courses of
action. "Either it's going to be
every person for himself or

else there's going to be a re
formulation of a new kind of
ethos among professionals. I'm
inclined to think that there may
well be a new leadership emer
ging."
In the 1920s engineers and
technical people revolted
against corporations and gov
ernment organizations and at-

tempted to build their own
power base. Meehan thinks that
may be happening again today
"Like a lot of other things today,
this movement is starting very
small with very local groups
that are highly specialized."
According to Meehan. people
are rejecting national pro
fessional organizations such as
the American Medical Associa
tion in favor of more specialized
groups such as the coalition of
doctors concerned about nucle
ar war. Meehan said he antici
pates further growth of
backyard special interest
groups, as opposed to individual
alienation on the issues of social
responsibility.
Another part of the course
will examine a professional's
obligation to society.
Meehan's said his personal
view is that "The professional,
scientist, or any technical per
son has an obligation that goes
beyond their employer," to
make known the hazards and
implications of a particular
technology.
Meehan s interest in pro
fessionalism and ethics was
first sparked when he was an un
dergraduate at the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology in
the late 19505. In a course simi
lar to the one he will teach at
Stanford. Meehan interviewed
the president of a large firm
who had been convicted of brib
ing public officials in order to
secure jobs for his company. In
stead of jailing him, the judge
added an interesting twist. If
the president agreed to reveal
the true inner workings of his
firm, the judge would suspend
his sentence.
"I spent the entire afternoon
with this man," Meehan re

called. "He told me how the
whole system really worked â€”
not what you read in magazines
or what the professional propa
ganda was, but how it really
worked. And it had a big effect
on me."
"Engineering and the techni
cal professions are extremely
popular right now." Meehan

continued. "There's a lot of
pressure, and a lot of it has to do
with the question of jobs. I think
that if I were in your position.
I'd want to know just how much
I'll have to compromise. And
you're not going to get that by
reading Fortune magazine."
Walter Vincenti, chairman of
VTS, said he thinks Meehan's
practical knowledge and ex
perience will be his strongest
contribution to the program.
"Being a practicing civil engi
neer. he sees some of the kinds
of issues in practical operation,
so he's able to bring a reality to
some of our considerations."
Jane Woodward, an Engi
neering Geology major, and
former student of Meehan's
Geotechnical Practice class,
which discussed many of the
same problems, commented, "I
think we were all surprised at
how much the class did for us.
The whole aim of the class was
to help us: to prepare us for the
real world "
"Nowhere in our education,
except in our practical ex
perience, had any of us learned
what it was like to be sued as an
engineer."
In fact. Meehan elaborated on
some of the legal aspects of en
gineering in his forthcoming
book, (retting Sued and Other
Tiilrs (if the Engineering Life, to
be published in August by the
M.I.T. Press. He is currently
writing another book for Hoover
Institution on nuclear licensing.
A semi-renaissance man,
Meehan received his S B. in civ
il engineering from M.I.T. in
1961. He completed his graduate
work in soil mechanics in 1966 at
Imperial College, University of
London, and also studied at UC-
Berkeley's College of Environ

mental Design.
Meehan has worked for con
sulting engineering companies
in the U.S., Southeast Asia, and
South America. The primary
focus of Earth Sciences As
sociates, of which he has been
the president for the last 12
years, involves the safe siting
and design of large energy
projects such as dams, re
fineries and power plants. Of
Meehan s professional ability
Vincenti said, "He's a respected
member of the engineering
community."
Meehan will not provide an
swers for budding professionals
struggling with questions on so
cial responsibility. But as an en
gineer, author, and philosopher
he is highly qualified to reveal
and suggest paths through the
moral uncertainty facing to
day's professionals.
