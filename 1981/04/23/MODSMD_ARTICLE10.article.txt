Why Is it important to have a
union for clerical workers at
Stanford?
It equalizes the power. With a
union we will be able to have
some input into our own working
conditions, into our means of
livelihood.
How will the union achieve
this equalization of power?
Through joint committees —
employee-management com
mittees — and through nego
tiations with the University.
Is a union the only means of
achieving this?
It's the only real means. It is
the only one that is legally rec
ognized ; agreements made with
a union are binding.
Why are some clericals op
posed to unionization?
I have a theory about that. I
believe the root of the problem
is that women, traditionally,
are conditioned to have some
thing or someone else take care
of them. It starts in childhood —
boys take care of their sisters,
and fathers look after the house
hold. When women leave home,
their husbands become respon
sible for the household. Women
are working now for more than
pocket money, they're working
bepause they have to.

"Their (the University's) bulletins are
distorted and misleading. They are not
factual."
— Joyce Tipps-Coats

Since the people who are ad
ministrators are men, women
are again being taken care of.
Unions allow women to be re
sponsible for their own live
lihood. It can be done collective
ly. Women must be responsible,
but they don't feel they can do it.
Even if their employer is not
ideal, they feel that it is secure
because the boss is the man who
delivers the paycheck.
What about male clerical
workers?
They are also discriminated
against in that they are doing
what's considered women's
work. They, too, are underpaid
and undervalued.
Why do you think the' Unive
rsity is opposed to unionization?
It would take away from their
ultimate power. Once the union
is established, they can't make
decisions arbitrarily towards
our livelihood. They'll have to
sit down to work out an agree
ment that is satisfactory for
both sides.
Why are some women
who have been here for
years without any in
creased benefits or reclass
ification still opposed to
unionization?

That goes back to my theory.
The university has created a
sense of loyalty, and many
women feel that if they vote
"yes." they are somehow going
against the University, or rath
er against the University's in
terests. What they're Veally
doing is promoting their own in
terests.
Ignoring the University's in
terests?
No. It depends on how you
look at it. Voting "yes" means
you're promoting your own in
terests, taking responsibility
for your own interests. It's
saying you know what's best for
you. Unions allow you some in
put into what's best for you. The
University's arbitrary decisions
affect those loyal to it. We're all
in this together. It's not an indi
vidual thing, it's unity and soli
darity — we all can gain.
Is your gain the University's
loss?
The University won't lose
anything. We'll gain respect,
self-respect and our own dignity
as a result of this.
Do you think the unionization
drive will be successful?
Yes. It's clear what this
movement has created. The pay
increases we have received in

the past two years are a direct
result of this ongoing campaign;
people can see what collective
action can do. That in itself
shows what we can do if we
come together as a collective.
These increases have been
across the board, not just for an
individual, and that's what it's
all about.
What happens if you fail?
I don't want to use a scare tac
tic because I think that's what
the University is doing I think
we will receive the 12 percent
increase promised for October.
If not, there will be 2000 women
who will be outraged. We will
attempt to start this over again.
If this year's attempt fails, it
will be clear to the University
that we can't come together for
our own collective action. The
University will know that they
can do what they want with us in
terms of salaries, benefits,
vacations or whatever. We'll
have to accept it or leave, which
is where we're at now.
Many clericals still seem
to be unclear about the
difference between vot
ing for the union and actually
joining It.
What you're talking about is
the agency shop question It

means that although you don't
have to become a member, you
have to pay the fees. This is a
question that is negotiated be
tween the union and the Univer
sity. The law says that you can't
force people to join the union.
But you can have an agency shop
negotiated between the Univer
sity and the union. The people in
the bargaining unit, whom the
union is legally bound to repre
sent, have to pay dues. This has
been explained in all of our noon
meetings and in our newsletter.
If you are successful, will it
take a long time to negotiate a
contract?
The University has said over
and over again that if we are
successful they will negotiate in
good faith. It only takes a long
time when they don't.
What about the comparison in
the University's Election Bul
letin 1 where the salary levels
negotiated by Local 715 were
shown to be lower than what
they will be offering?
I think what they really did is
create a visual aid. When they
first announced the increases in
Campus Report, they said we
would get 12 to 22 percent more,
in black and white print. Elec
tion Bulletin 1 was a visual aid.
They wanted the clericals to
look at it and say "God, if I join
the union I'm not going to re
ceive the raises the University
has promised!" Also, in their
projections they included the
merit zone. Very few people
reach the top percentage of pay
raises in the merit zone which
were included in the bulletin's
graph. (Editor's note: In the
"merit zone," the highest level
of the University's six-step ad
vancement system, employees
receive raises at the discretion
of their supervisors. Their
salaries cannot, however, drop
below the level of the highest
step in the initial six steps they
must pass through before enter
ing the merit zone.)
Also, Local 715 only repre
sents workers in the public sec
tor, except for the United Stan
ford Employees, whose con
tract will not be renegotiated
until the fall of 1982 But they
were comparing the public sec
tor to a private sector.
What do you think the ov
erall effect of the elec
tion bulletins has been?
They've turned people off be
cause they see through this. Our
newsletters have been going out
for 18 months. The attention the
workers have been receiving
from the University only
started in the last two months,
when they started with their
bulletins.
Their bulletins are distorted
and misleading. They are not
factual. It is hard to believe that

they would underestimate us as
they do. The election bulletins
are based on fear and intimida
tion. I don't mind them putting
out their side of the story, but
they shouldn't distort and mis
lead, and the bulletins shouldn't
be based on fear.
They should tell us how
they're going to change; the bul
letins should be based on the is
sues. They should tell us how
they're going to implement
child care, give us equal pay,
and improve our benefits. They
said they were going to be fac
tual but instead they came off
with all this stuff about strikes
and whatever, which is really
untrue.
What I really fear if we do not
win is that the issues — child
care. wages, the reclass
ification system — will not be
addressed. I'm not really con
cerned with Bulletin One or Two
or Three or Four or any of that
stuff.

"112 otingyes means you're promoting your
own interests, taking responsibility for your
own interests. It's saying you know what's
best for you."
— Joyce Tipps-Coats

How did you get started in the
unionization effort?
In June of 1979, I became
president of the Women's As
sociation at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator (SLAC). Just
before I became president,
there was a survey done on
salaries. The survey showed
that the men who worked in the
labor pool — whose only quali
fication was a valid driver's
license — received 21 percent
Increases and the technicians 19
percent over the past three
years because they were
unionized. The office staff had
only received 5.3 percent in
those three years.
Thus, I got started on the
equal pay for equal work issue.
I'm not saying that those work
ers were receiving too much,
but we were receiving too little
in terms of our skill level.
When we approached the
SLAC management, they said
there was nothing we could do
since our salaries were tied into
the University wage scale. As
our only recourse, we sought

help from the union. It should be
remembered that the unions
didn't come to us, we went to
them. They were our only re
course, we had no other alter
native.
What was your initial
motivation?
The 5.3 percent is
what motivated me. The fact
that clericals who are organized
received 33 percent more
motivated me. In my previous
years as a secretary, I was not
aware of the discrimination I
was dealing with as a clerical
worker, and as a woman, I ac
cepted the role of a secretary —
that I was in a certain position
and got a certain wage. It's only
when I took a serious look at my
position and my wages that my
attitude changed.
Do you think the* Daily's poll
could affect the outcome?
I'm not sure. I know that we
have a lot of solid people who
are supporting us. Those people

are going to remain solid no
matter what. But there are peo
ple who have not yet made up
their minds and who probably
won't until the day of the elec
tion. The poll could influence
them.
How do you feel about rela
tions between the unionization
effort and the University?
It's really hard to see the kind
of stuff the University is putting
out and not Uike it personully.
They're implying that the ac
tivists have somehow been
tricked into organizing this, that
we are not responsible adults.
The accusation that we are
hostile and counterproductive
offends me. We took a serious
look at unions before we at
tempted to join. But to imply
that we have been conned really
bothers me.
What actions that your or
ganization has taken do you
think the University sees as
hostile and counterproductive?
I have no idea. I'd like them to
specifically say.

would get 12 to 22 percent more,
in black and white print. Elec
tion Bulletin 1 was a visual aid.
They wanted the clericals to
look at it and say "God, if I join
the union I'm not going to re
ceive the raises the University
has promised!" Also, in their
projections they included the
merit zone. Very few people
reach the top percentage of pay
raises in the merit zone which
were included in the bulletin's
graph. (Editor's note: In the
"merit zone," the highest level
of the University's six-step ad
vancement system, employees
receive raises at the discretion
of their supervisors. Their
salaries cannot, however, drop
below the level of the highest
step in the initial six steps they
must pass through before enter
ing the merit zone.)
Also, Local 715 only repre
sents workers in the public sec
tor, except for the United Stan
ford Employees, whose con
tract will not be renegotiated
until the fall of 1982 But they
were comparing the public sec
tor to a private sector.
What do you think the ov
erall effect of the elec
tion bulletins has been?
They've turned people off be
cause they see through this. Our
newsletters have been going out
for 18 months. The attention the
workers have been receiving
from the University only
started in the last two months,
when they started with their
bulletins.
Their bulletins are distorted
and misleading. They are not
factual. It is hard to believe that

they would underestimate us as
they do. The election bulletins
are based on fear and intimida
tion. I don't mind them putting
out their side of the story, but
they shouldn't distort and mis
lead, and the bulletins shouldn't
be based on fear.
They should tell us how
they're going to change; the bul
letins should be based on the is
sues. They should tell us how
they're going to implement
child care, give us equal pay,
and improve our benefits. They
said they were going to be fac
tual but instead they came off
with all this stuff about strikes
and whatever, which is really
untrue.
What I really fear if we do not
win is that the issues — child
care. wages, the reclass
ification system — will not be
addressed. I'm not really con
cerned with Bulletin One or Two
or Three or Four or any of that
stuff.

How did you get started in the
unionization effort?
In June of 1979, I became
president of the Women's As
sociation at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator (SLAC). Just
before I became president,
there was a survey done on
salaries. The survey showed
that the men who worked in the
labor pool — whose only quali
fication was a valid driver's
license — received 21 percent
Increases and the technicians 19
percent over the past three
years because they were
unionized. The office staff had
only received 5.3 percent in
those three years.
Thus, I got started on the
equal pay for equal work issue.
I'm not saying that those work
ers were receiving too much,
but we were receiving too little
in terms of our skill level.
When we approached the
SLAC management, they said
there was nothing we could do
since our salaries were tied into
the University wage scale. As
our only recourse, we sought

help from the union. It should be
remembered that the unions
didn't come to us, we went to
them. They were our only re
course, we had no other alter
native.
What was your initial
motivation?
The 5.3 percent is
what motivated me. The fact
that clericals who are organized
received 33 percent more
motivated me. In my previous
years as a secretary, I was not
aware of the discrimination I
was dealing with as a clerical
worker, and as a woman, I ac
cepted the role of a secretary —
that I was in a certain position
and got a certain wage. It's only
when I took a serious look at my
position and my wages that my
attitude changed.
Do you think the* Daily's poll
could affect the outcome?
I'm not sure. I know that we
have a lot of solid people who
are supporting us. Those people

are going to remain solid no
matter what. But there are peo
ple who have not yet made up
their minds and who probably
won't until the day of the elec
tion. The poll could influence
them.
How do you feel about rela
tions between the unionization
effort and the University?
It's really hard to see the kind
of stuff the University is putting
out and not Uike it personully.
They're implying that the ac
tivists have somehow been
tricked into organizing this, that
we are not responsible adults.
The accusation that we are
hostile and counterproductive
offends me. We took a serious
look at unions before we at
tempted to join. But to imply
that we have been conned really
bothers me.
What actions that your or
ganization has taken do you

hostile and counterproductive?
I have no idea. I'd like them to

★ ★ ★
Why Is it important to have a
union for clerical workers at
Stanford?
It equalizes the power. With a
union we will be able to have
some input into our own working
conditions, into our means of
livelihood.
How will the union achieve
this equalization of power?
Through joint committees —
employee-management com
mittees — and through nego
tiations with the University.
Is a union the only means of
achieving this?
It's the only real means. It is
the only one that is legally rec
ognized ; agreements made with
a union are binding.
Why are some clericals op
posed to unionization?
I have a theory about that. I
believe the root of the problem
is that women, traditionally,
are conditioned to have some
thing or someone else take care
of them. It starts in childhood —
boys take care of their sisters,
and fathers look after the house
hold. When women leave home,
their husbands become respon
sible for the household. Women
are working now for more than
pocket money, they're working
bepause they have to.

"Their (the University's) bulletins are
distorted and misleading. They are not
factual."
— Joyce Tipps-Coats

Since the people who are ad
ministrators are men, women
are again being taken care of.
Unions allow women to be re
sponsible for their own live
lihood. It can be done collective
ly. Women must be responsible,
but they don't feel they can do it.
Even if their employer is not
ideal, they feel that it is secure
because the boss is the man who
delivers the paycheck.
What about male clerical
workers?
They are also discriminated
against in that they are doing
what's considered women's
work. They, too, are underpaid
and undervalued.
Why do you think the' Unive
rsity is opposed to unionization?
It would take away from their
ultimate power. Once the union
is established, they can't make
decisions arbitrarily towards
our livelihood. They'll have to
sit down to work out an agree
ment that is satisfactory for
both sides.
Why are some women
who have been here for
years without any in
creased benefits or reclass
ification still opposed to
unionization?

That goes back to my theory.
The university has created a
sense of loyalty, and many
women feel that if they vote
"yes." they are somehow going
against the University, or rath
er against the University's in
terests. What they're Veally
doing is promoting their own in
terests.
Ignoring the University's in
terests?
No. It depends on how you
look at it. Voting "yes" means
you're promoting your own in
terests, taking responsibility
for your own interests. It's
saying you know what's best for
you. Unions allow you some in
put into what's best for you. The
University's arbitrary decisions
affect those loyal to it. We're all
in this together. It's not an indi
vidual thing, it's unity and soli
darity — we all can gain.
Is your gain the University's
loss?
The University won't lose
anything. We'll gain respect,
self-respect and our own dignity
as a result of this.
Do you think the unionization
drive will be successful?
Yes. It's clear what this
movement has created. The pay
increases we have received in

the past two years are a direct
result of this ongoing campaign;
people can see what collective
action can do. That in itself
shows what we can do if we
come together as a collective.
These increases have been
across the board, not just for an
individual, and that's what it's
all about.
What happens if you fail?
I don't want to use a scare tac
tic because I think that's what
the University is doing I think
we will receive the 12 percent
increase promised for October.
If not, there will be 2000 women
who will be outraged. We will
attempt to start this over again.
If this year's attempt fails, it
will be clear to the University
that we can't come together for
our own collective action. The
University will know that they
can do what they want with us in
terms of salaries, benefits,
vacations or whatever. We'll
have to accept it or leave, which
is where we're at now.
Many clericals still seem
to be unclear about the
difference between vot
ing for the union and actually
joining It.
What you're talking about is
the agency shop question It

means that although you don't
have to become a member, you
have to pay the fees. This is a
question that is negotiated be
tween the union and the Univer
sity. The law says that you can't
force people to join the union.
But you can have an agency shop
negotiated between the Univer
sity and the union. The people in
the bargaining unit, whom the
union is legally bound to repre
sent, have to pay dues. This has
been explained in all of our noon
meetings and in our newsletter.
If you are successful, will it
take a long time to negotiate a
contract?
The University has said over
and over again that if we are
successful they will negotiate in
good faith. It only takes a long
time when they don't.
What about the comparison in
the University's Election Bul
letin 1 where the salary levels
negotiated by Local 715 were
shown to be lower than what
they will be offering?
I think what they really did is
create a visual aid. When they
first announced the increases in
Campus Report, they said we
would get 12 to 22 percent more,
in black and white print. Elec
tion Bulletin 1 was a visual aid.
They wanted the clericals to
look at it and say "God, if I join
the union I'm not going to re
ceive the raises the University
has promised!" Also, in their
projections they included the
merit zone. Very few people
reach the top percentage of pay
raises in the merit zone which
were included in the bulletin's

"merit zone," the highest level
of the University's six-step ad

some input into our own working
conditions, into our means of
livelihood.
How will the union achieve
this equalization of power?
Through joint committees —
employee-management com
mittees — and through nego
tiations with the University.
Is a union the only means of
achieving this?
It's the only real means. It is
the only one that is legally rec
ognized ; agreements made with
a union are binding.
Why are some clericals op
posed to unionization?
I have a theory about that. I
believe the root of the problem
is that women, traditionally,
are conditioned to have some
thing or someone else take care
of them. It starts in childhood —
boys take care of their sisters,
and fathers look after the house
hold. When women leave home,
their husbands become respon
sible for the household. Women
are working now for more than
pocket money, they're working
bepause they have to.

"Their (the University's) bulletins are
distorted and misleading. They are not
factual."
— Joyce Tipps-Coats

Since the people who are ad
ministrators are men, women
are again being taken care of.
Unions allow women to be re
sponsible for their own live
lihood. It can be done collective
ly. Women must be responsible,
but they don't feel they can do it.
Even if their employer is not
ideal, they feel that it is secure
because the boss is the man who
delivers the paycheck.
What about male clerical
workers?
They are also discriminated
against in that they are doing
what's considered women's
work. They, too, are underpaid
and undervalued.
Why do you think the' Unive
rsity is opposed to unionization?
It would take away from their
ultimate power. Once the union
is established, they can't make
decisions arbitrarily towards
our livelihood. They'll have to
sit down to work out an agree
ment that is satisfactory for
both sides.
Why are some women
who have been here for
years without any in
creased benefits or reclass
ification still opposed to
unionization?

That goes back to my theory.
The university has created a
sense of loyalty, and many
women feel that if they vote
"yes." they are somehow going
against the University, or rath
er against the University's in
terests. What they're Veally
doing is promoting their own in
terests.
Ignoring the University's in
terests?
No. It depends on how you
look at it. Voting "yes" means
you're promoting your own in
terests, taking responsibility
for your own interests. It's
saying you know what's best for
you. Unions allow you some in
put into what's best for you. The
University's arbitrary decisions
affect those loyal to it. We're all
in this together. It's not an indi
vidual thing, it's unity and soli
darity — we all can gain.
Is your gain the University's
loss?
The University won't lose
anything. We'll gain respect,
self-respect and our own dignity
as a result of this.
Do you think the unionization
drive will be successful?
Yes. It's clear what this
movement has created. The pay
increases we have received in

the past two years are a direct
result of this ongoing campaign;
people can see what collective
action can do. That in itself
shows what we can do if we
come together as a collective.
These increases have been
across the board, not just for an
individual, and that's what it's
all about.
What happens if you fail?
I don't want to use a scare tac
tic because I think that's what
the University is doing I think
we will receive the 12 percent
increase promised for October.
If not, there will be 2000 women
who will be outraged. We will
attempt to start this over again.
If this year's attempt fails, it
will be clear to the University
that we can't come together for
our own collective action. The
University will know that they
can do what they want with us in
terms of salaries, benefits,
vacations or whatever. We'll
have to accept it or leave, which
is where we're at now.
Many clericals still seem
to be unclear about the
difference between vot
ing for the union and actually
joining It.
What you're talking about is
the agency shop question It

means that although you don't
have to become a member, you
have to pay the fees. This is a
question that is negotiated be
tween the union and the Univer
sity. The law says that you can't
force people to join the union.
But you can have an agency shop
negotiated between the Univer
sity and the union. The people in
the bargaining unit, whom the
union is legally bound to repre
sent, have to pay dues. This has
been explained in all of our noon
meetings and in our newsletter.
If you are successful, will it
take a long time to negotiate a
contract?
The University has said over
and over again that if we are
successful they will negotiate in
good faith. It only takes a long
time when they don't.
What about the comparison in
the University's Election Bul
letin 1 where the salary levels
negotiated by Local 715 were
shown to be lower than what
they will be offering?
I think what they really did is
create a visual aid. When they
first announced the increases in
Campus Report, they said we
would get 12 to 22 percent more,
in black and white print. Elec
tion Bulletin 1 was a visual aid.
They wanted the clericals to
look at it and say "God, if I join
the union I'm not going to re
ceive the raises the University
has promised!" Also, in their
projections they included the
merit zone. Very few people
reach the top percentage of pay
raises in the merit zone which
were included in the bulletin's
graph. (Editor's note: In the
"merit zone," the highest level
of the University's six-step ad
vancement system, employees
receive raises at the discretion
of their supervisors. Their
salaries cannot, however, drop
below the level of the highest
step in the initial six steps they
must pass through before enter
ing the merit zone.)
Also, Local 715 only repre
sents workers in the public sec
tor, except for the United Stan
ford Employees, whose con
tract will not be renegotiated
until the fall of 1982 But they
were comparing the public sec
tor to a private sector.
What do you think the ov
erall effect of the elec
tion bulletins has been?
They've turned people off be
cause they see through this. Our
newsletters have been going out
for 18 months. The attention the
workers have been receiving
from the University only
started in the last two months,
when they started with their
bulletins.
Their bulletins are distorted
and misleading. They are not
factual. It is hard to believe that

they would underestimate us as
they do. The election bulletins
are based on fear and intimida
tion. I don't mind them putting
out their side of the story, but
they shouldn't distort and mis
lead, and the bulletins shouldn't
be based on fear.
They should tell us how
they're going to change; the bul
letins should be based on the is
sues. They should tell us how
they're going to implement
child care, give us equal pay,
and improve our benefits. They
said they were going to be fac
tual but instead they came off
with all this stuff about strikes
and whatever, which is really
untrue.
What I really fear if we do not
win is that the issues — child
care. wages, the reclass
ification system — will not be
addressed. I'm not really con
cerned with Bulletin One or Two
or Three or Four or any of that
stuff.

"112 otingyes means you're promoting your
own interests, taking responsibility for your
own interests. It's saying you know what's
best for you."
— Joyce Tipps-Coats

How did you get started in the
unionization effort?
In June of 1979, I became
president of the Women's As
sociation at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator (SLAC). Just
before I became president,
there was a survey done on
salaries. The survey showed
that the men who worked in the
labor pool — whose only quali
fication was a valid driver's
license — received 21 percent
Increases and the technicians 19
percent over the past three
years because they were
unionized. The office staff had
only received 5.3 percent in
those three years.
Thus, I got started on the
equal pay for equal work issue.
I'm not saying that those work
ers were receiving too much,
but we were receiving too little
in terms of our skill level.
When we approached the
SLAC management, they said
there was nothing we could do
since our salaries were tied into
the University wage scale. As
our only recourse, we sought

help from the union. It should be
remembered that the unions
didn't come to us, we went to
them. They were our only re
course, we had no other alter
native.
What was your initial
motivation?
The 5.3 percent is
what motivated me. The fact
that clericals who are organized
received 33 percent more
motivated me. In my previous
years as a secretary, I was not
aware of the discrimination I
was dealing with as a clerical
worker, and as a woman, I ac
cepted the role of a secretary —
that I was in a certain position
and got a certain wage. It's only
when I took a serious look at my
position and my wages that my
attitude changed.
Do you think the* Daily's poll
could affect the outcome?
I'm not sure. I know that we
have a lot of solid people who
are supporting us. Those people

are going to remain solid no
matter what. But there are peo
ple who have not yet made up
their minds and who probably
won't until the day of the elec
tion. The poll could influence
them.
How do you feel about rela
tions between the unionization
effort and the University?
It's really hard to see the kind
of stuff the University is putting
out and not Uike it personully.
They're implying that the ac
tivists have somehow been
tricked into organizing this, that
we are not responsible adults.
The accusation that we are
hostile and counterproductive
offends me. We took a serious
look at unions before we at
tempted to join. But to imply
that we have been conned really
bothers me.
What actions that your or
ganization has taken do you
think the University sees as
hostile and counterproductive?
I have no idea. I'd like them to
specifically say.

What do you think the ov
erall effect of the elec
tion bulletins has been?
They've turned people off be
cause they see through this. Our
newsletters have been going out
for 18 months. The attention the
workers have been receiving
from the University only
started in the last two months,
when they started with their
bulletins.
Their bulletins are distorted
and misleading. They are not
factual. It is hard to believe that

they would underestimate us as
they do. The election bulletins
are based on fear and intimida
tion. I don't mind them putting
out their side of the story, but
they shouldn't distort and mis
lead, and the bulletins shouldn't
be based on fear.
They should tell us how
they're going to change; the bul
letins should be based on the is
sues. They should tell us how
they're going to implement
child care, give us equal pay,
and improve our benefits. They
said they were going to be fac
tual but instead they came off
with all this stuff about strikes
and whatever, which is really
untrue.
What I really fear if we do not
win is that the issues — child
care. wages, the reclass
ification system — will not be
addressed. I'm not really con
cerned with Bulletin One or Two
or Three or Four or any of that
stuff.

How did you get started in the
unionization effort?
In June of 1979, I became
president of the Women's As
sociation at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator (SLAC). Just
before I became president,
there was a survey done on
salaries. The survey showed
that the men who worked in the
labor pool — whose only quali
fication was a valid driver's
license — received 21 percent
Increases and the technicians 19
percent over the past three
years because they were
unionized. The office staff had
only received 5.3 percent in
those three years.
Thus, I got started on the
equal pay for equal work issue.
I'm not saying that those work
ers were receiving too much,
but we were receiving too little
in terms of our skill level.
When we approached the
SLAC management, they said
there was nothing we could do
since our salaries were tied into
the University wage scale. As
our only recourse, we sought

help from the union. It should be
remembered that the unions
didn't come to us, we went to
them. They were our only re
course, we had no other alter
native.
What was your initial
motivation?
The 5.3 percent is
what motivated me. The fact
that clericals who are organized
received 33 percent more
motivated me. In my previous
years as a secretary, I was not
aware of the discrimination I
was dealing with as a clerical
worker, and as a woman, I ac
cepted the role of a secretary —
that I was in a certain position
and got a certain wage. It's only
when I took a serious look at my
position and my wages that my
attitude changed.
Do you think the* Daily's poll
could affect the outcome?
I'm not sure. I know that we
have a lot of solid people who
are supporting us. Those people

are going to remain solid no
matter what. But there are peo
ple who have not yet made up
their minds and who probably
won't until the day of the elec
tion. The poll could influence
them.
How do you feel about rela
tions between the unionization
effort and the University?
It's really hard to see the kind
of stuff the University is putting
out and not Uike it personully.
They're implying that the ac
tivists have somehow been
tricked into organizing this, that
we are not responsible adults.
The accusation that we are
hostile and counterproductive
offends me. We took a serious
look at unions before we at
tempted to join. But to imply
that we have been conned really
bothers me.
What actions that your or
ganization has taken do you
think the University sees as
hostile and counterproductive?
I have no idea. I'd like them to
specifically say.

Why Is it important to have a
union for clerical workers at
Stanford?
It equalizes the power. With a
union we will be able to have
some input into our own working
conditions, into our means of
livelihood.
How will the union achieve
this equalization of power?
Through joint committees —
employee-management com
mittees — and through nego
tiations with the University.
Is a union the only means of
achieving this?
It's the only real means. It is
the only one that is legally rec
ognized ; agreements made with
a union are binding.
Why are some clericals op
posed to unionization?
I have a theory about that. I
believe the root of the problem
is that women, traditionally,
are conditioned to have some
thing or someone else take care
of them. It starts in childhood —
boys take care of their sisters,
and fathers look after the house
hold. When women leave home,
their husbands become respon
sible for the household. Women
are working now for more than
pocket money, they're working
bepause they have to.

"Their (the University's) bulletins are
distorted and misleading. They are not
factual."
— Joyce Tipps-Coats

Since the people who are ad
ministrators are men, women
are again being taken care of.
Unions allow women to be re
sponsible for their own live
lihood. It can be done collective
ly. Women must be responsible,
but they don't feel they can do it.
Even if their employer is not
ideal, they feel that it is secure
because the boss is the man who
delivers the paycheck.
What about male clerical
workers?
They are also discriminated
against in that they are doing
what's considered women's
work. They, too, are underpaid
and undervalued.
Why do you think the' Unive
rsity is opposed to unionization?
It would take away from their
ultimate power. Once the union
is established, they can't make
decisions arbitrarily towards
our livelihood. They'll have to
sit down to work out an agree
ment that is satisfactory for
both sides.
Why are some women
who have been here for
years without any in
creased benefits or reclass
ification still opposed to
unionization?

That goes back to my theory.
The university has created a
sense of loyalty, and many
women feel that if they vote
"yes." they are somehow going
against the University, or rath
er against the University's in
terests. What they're Veally
doing is promoting their own in
terests.
Ignoring the University's in
terests?
No. It depends on how you
look at it. Voting "yes" means
you're promoting your own in
terests, taking responsibility
for your own interests. It's
saying you know what's best for
you. Unions allow you some in
put into what's best for you. The
University's arbitrary decisions
affect those loyal to it. We're all
in this together. It's not an indi
vidual thing, it's unity and soli
darity — we all can gain.
Is your gain the University's
loss?
The University won't lose
anything. We'll gain respect,
self-respect and our own dignity
as a result of this.
Do you think the unionization
drive will be successful?
Yes. It's clear what this
movement has created. The pay
increases we have received in

the past two years are a direct
result of this ongoing campaign;
people can see what collective
action can do. That in itself
shows what we can do if we
come together as a collective.
These increases have been
across the board, not just for an
individual, and that's what it's
all about.
What happens if you fail?
I don't want to use a scare tac
tic because I think that's what
the University is doing I think
we will receive the 12 percent
increase promised for October.
If not, there will be 2000 women
who will be outraged. We will
attempt to start this over again.
If this year's attempt fails, it
will be clear to the University
that we can't come together for
our own collective action. The
University will know that they
can do what they want with us in
terms of salaries, benefits,
vacations or whatever. We'll
have to accept it or leave, which
is where we're at now.
Many clericals still seem
to be unclear about the
difference between vot
ing for the union and actually
joining It.
What you're talking about is
the agency shop question It

means that although you don't
have to become a member, you
have to pay the fees. This is a
question that is negotiated be
tween the union and the Univer
sity. The law says that you can't
force people to join the union.
But you can have an agency shop
negotiated between the Univer
sity and the union. The people in
the bargaining unit, whom the
union is legally bound to repre
sent, have to pay dues. This has
been explained in all of our noon
meetings and in our newsletter.
If you are successful, will it
take a long time to negotiate a
contract?
The University has said over
and over again that if we are
successful they will negotiate in
good faith. It only takes a long
time when they don't.
What about the comparison in
the University's Election Bul
letin 1 where the salary levels
negotiated by Local 715 were
shown to be lower than what
they will be offering?
I think what they really did is
create a visual aid. When they
first announced the increases in
Campus Report, they said we
would get 12 to 22 percent more,
in black and white print. Elec
tion Bulletin 1 was a visual aid.
They wanted the clericals to
look at it and say "God, if I join
the union I'm not going to re
ceive the raises the University
has promised!" Also, in their
projections they included the
merit zone. Very few people
reach the top percentage of pay
raises in the merit zone which
were included in the bulletin's
graph. (Editor's note: In the
"merit zone," the highest level
of the University's six-step ad
vancement system, employees
receive raises at the discretion
of their supervisors. Their
salaries cannot, however, drop
below the level of the highest
step in the initial six steps they
must pass through before enter
ing the merit zone.)
Also, Local 715 only repre
sents workers in the public sec
tor, except for the United Stan
ford Employees, whose con
tract will not be renegotiated
until the fall of 1982 But they
were comparing the public sec
tor to a private sector.
What do you think the ov
erall effect of the elec
tion bulletins has been?
They've turned people off be
cause they see through this. Our
newsletters have been going out
for 18 months. The attention the
