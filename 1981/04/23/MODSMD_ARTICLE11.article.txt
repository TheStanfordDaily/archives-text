# Unionization effort not unique to Stanford

### Clay Moltz 
The May 7 union represen
tation election by Univer
sity clerical employees
will determine whether Stan
ford clericals will enter the
slowly growing ranks of univer
sities with unionized clericals.
The issue of unionization of
university employees is not
unique to Stanford. At some uni
versities. unions have existed
since shortly after World War
11, while at other schools, em
ployees are either not unionized
or at various stages in the or
ganizing process. In many
cases, the process of
unionization involves confronta
tion between motivated work
ers wanting to form a collective

bargaining unit and anti-union
university administrations.
Union representation in
itiatives at other universities of
fer both hopeful and gloomy pre
cedents to the clericals trying to
unionize at Stanford.
Clericals at Yale University,
for example, face a similar situ
ation to those at Stanford, with a
unionization vote for 3000 Yale
clericals and technicians ten
tatively scheduled for next
month. Uncertainty exists as to
which of two competing or
ganizing groups will file first
with the NLRB (National Labor
Relations Board) to schedule a
unionization vote. The present
effort by Yale clericals and
technicians to unionize is their
third in the past decade.

Dining hall, physical plant,
custodial, and maintenance em
ployees (numbering some 950)
are represented by the national
Hotel and Restaurant Employ
ees union.
Work-study students em
ployed in Yale dining halls pay
union dues and receive wages
starting at the union minimum
of $5 an hour. Students working
at Yale libraries, however,
where regular employees are
not unionized, receive salaries
starting at or near minimum
wage.
In 1977, a strike by the Yale
dining hall and custodial em
ployees union over renegotia
tion of their two-year contract
nearly crippled the university.
Students were given daily food
rebates from their board fees
and were instructed to find their
own meals. They also had to as
sume responsibility for cleaning
their own dormitories. The
strike lasted more than a
month.
The success or failure of the
upcoming clerical unionization
vote may in large part be af
fected by the policies of the Yale
administration. According to
sources at the Yale Daily News,
the university has hired a
$100,000-a-month union-busting
law firm to prevent
unionization
At Harvard University,
workers voted down a
move to unionize the
clericals at Harvard Medical
School just three weeks ago.

Workers union, District 65. Ac
cording to sources at the
Harvard Crimson, union of

mains uncertain whether legal
action will be taken by UAW.
At the University of San Fran

tempts have been much more
successful. At present, all uni

university adminstration's of

strike in its nearly 10-year his
tory. In the mid-19705, however,
the union did honor the picket
lines of a strike of university en
gineers which, according to uni
versity clerical Elizabeth
Benhardt, was "settled suc
cessfully" in two weeks.
Benhardt, a union member,
said in a telephone interview
that dealings between the USF
administration and the employ
ees are characterized by a gen
erally "adversarial rela
tionship." However, she said
that working conditions had im
proved with unionization since
workers are "less apt to take
what's unnecessary — unfair
treatment."
At UC-Berkeley, there is a
long history of collective
bargaining. The union of
custodial employees, for exam
ple, dates back to the im
mediate post-World War II peri

od. All of the major unions at
Berkeley are locals of the
American Federation of State,
County, and Municipal Employ
ees (AFSCME).
The efforts of clericals at
Berkeley to achieve
unionization met university re
sistance similar to that now
being experienced by clericals
at Stanford. Berkeley clericals,
however, successfully unionized
in 1967 along with university lab
technicians, programmers and
remaining non-unionized custo
dians.

In 1972, the builders, electri
cians, and construction engi
neers' union called a strike
against the Berkeley adminis
tration. Other unions, including
the clericals, honored the picket
lines until successful nego
tiation brought an end to the
most serious labor-man
agement conflict at the school
since a major custodial strike in
the mid-19505.
Judy Shattuck, president of
AFSCME local 1695 for
Berkeley clericals and techni
cians, said in a telephone in

ministration remains essential
ly anti-union.

the union did honor the picket
lines of a strike of university en
gineers which, according to uni
versity clerical Elizabeth
Benhardt, was "settled suc
cessfully" in two weeks.
Benhardt, a union member,
said in a telephone interview
that dealings between the USF
administration and the employ

erally "adversarial rela
tionship." However, she said
that working conditions had im
proved with unionization since
workers are "less apt to take

At UC-Berkeley, there is a
long history of collective
bargaining. The union of
custodial employees, for exam
ple, dates back to the im
mediate post-World War II peri

od. All of the major unions at
Berkeley are locals of the
American Federation of State,
County, and Municipal Employ
ees (AFSCME).
The efforts of clericals at
Berkeley to achieve
unionization met university re
sistance similar to that now
being experienced by clericals
at Stanford. Berkeley clericals,
however, successfully unionized
in 1967 along with university lab
technicians, programmers and
remaining non-unionized custo
dians.

In 1972, the builders, electri
cians, and construction engi
neers' union called a strike
against the Berkeley adminis
tration. Other unions, including
the clericals, honored the picket
lines until successful nego
tiation brought an end to the
most serious labor-man
agement conflict at the school
since a major custodial strike in
the mid-19505.
Judy Shattuck, president of
AFSCME local 1695 for
Berkeley clericals and techni
cians, said in a telephone in

ministration remains essential
ly anti-union.
The upcoming clerical vote at
Stanford is not something new.
However, successful or not. the
unionization election will be a

The May 7 union represen

will determine whether Stan

The issue of unionization of
university employees is not
unique to Stanford. At some uni
versities. unions have existed
since shortly after World War
11, while at other schools, em
ployees are either not unionized
or at various stages in the or

cases, the process of
unionization involves confronta

bargaining unit and anti-union
university administrations.

Clericals at Yale University,
for example, face a similar situ

unionization vote for 3000 Yale
clericals and technicians ten
tatively scheduled for next
month. Uncertainty exists as to
which of two competing or
ganizing groups will file first
with the NLRB (National Labor
Relations Board) to schedule a
unionization vote. The present
effort by Yale clericals and
technicians to unionize is their
third in the past decade.

are represented by the national

Work-study students em
ployed in Yale dining halls pay
union dues and receive wages
starting at the union minimum
of $5 an hour. Students working
at Yale libraries, however,
where regular employees are
not unionized, receive salaries
starting at or near minimum

In 1977, a strike by the Yale
dining hall and custodial em

nearly crippled the university.
Students were given daily food
rebates from their board fees
and were instructed to find their

strike lasted more than a

The success or failure of the
upcoming clerical unionization
vote may in large part be af
