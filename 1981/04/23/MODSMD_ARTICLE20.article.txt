# Tresidder: promising future despite troubled past
## Newly created board allows for student input 
### Mike Vaska 
On a given day. Tresidder
Union is vibrant and alive
with activity. Musical
groups often play in the noon
time sun for crowds of office
workers, students and pro
fessors taking a break from the
rigors of the academic com
munity. During the evening,
community residents may par
ticipate in ballroom dancing les
sons, karate classes or even
brass rubbing sessions, all spon
sored by Tresidder.
Tresidder Union has emerged
from the dark ages of just a few
years ago into "a period of ren
aissance", according to Council
of Presidents member Marc
Ventresca.
The signs of this renaissance
are apparent throughout Tres
idder. From the new Union
Board — begun this year to give
students, faculty and staff a
chance to advise Tresidder
management — to the ballroom
dance classes held in the eve
nings, there has been a re
vitalization of the notion that

'TTiere is a difference between (providing
input) and running the place. Students
cannot just walk in and, boom, have all the
answers.'

Tresidder Union should be more
I than "just a place to stop and tie
your shoe," according to Jean
Martin, director of Student Arts
at Stanford (STARTS).
Tresidder Union was dedi
cated in 1961 in memory of
Donald Tresidder, Stanford's
fourth president. Students
played a major role in the con
ception and funding of Tres
idder — a student fund that had
been formed in 1949 amassed
enough money to cover one
fourth of the construction costs.
At the dedication ceremony.
then-ASSU President Larry
Royse described the purpose of
the new community center:
"The Union also shall be part of
the informal educational pro
gram of the University. Its com
mittees, boards, and staffs shall
present a social, cultural, recre
ational and intellectual pro

gram for the whole campus."
Tresidder experienced
hard times in the late
1960s and early 1970s as a
number of factors converged,
according to Tresidder Director
Ellie Oppenheim. The most ap
parent symptom of the malaise
was the financial hardships
Tresidder encountered, Op
penheim said. A chart of Tres
idder's finances from its open
ing until the present shows large
deficits from 1967 to the
mid-19705. The depths of the fi
nancial crunch came in
1971-1972 when the figures "lit
erally fell off the chart," Op
penheim said.
To a large degree, the student
anti-war and civil rights unrest
that swept the campus was the
sickness responsible for the fi
nancial problems, Oppenheim
said. "Student involvement in
the University wavered, and in
put into Tresidder fell apart,"
she said. There were great soci
etal changes in the works, stu
dents' interests changed dra
matically, and "Tresidder
neither anticipated nor re

sponded to the changes," Op
penheim said.
"And the downward spiral
was made a whole lot worse
when programs were wiped out
to cut costs," she said.
In the 19605, students were
breaking windows at Tresidder
because they were angry at all
parts of the University adminis
tration, according to Martin.
They were protesting against
the University because it was
allowing things such as the draft
to happen to them, and they took
it out on the Union, Martin said.
"But today, Tresidder is on
the upswing," she said. The ad
ministration is eager to bring
students back to make Tres
idder a student and community
center once again, Martin
added.
Former Tresidder Director
Dan Williams, who left Stanford

last year to take a post at the
University of Oregon, worked
hard to provide Tresidder with a
"level of stability" upon which
Tresidder is now attempting to
build, Oppenheim said.
The Union Board symbol
izes that Tresidder has
emerged from its deepest
financial problems and is now
ready to look toward the future,
according to Union Board Chair
Sam Howe, a junior here. The
Board serves in an advisory ca
pacity, working with Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons
and Tresidder Director Op
penheim to "form a common vi
sion of what Tresidder could
be," Howe said. A Union Board
existed more than 10 years ago,
but was discontinued during the
great upheavals on campus, he
said.
The Union Board concerns
itself with programming at
Tresidder through STARTS, the
quality of the food through the
Food Committee, and the ap
propriate use of limited space
through a newly created Space
Committee, according to Howe.
In addition, the Union Board
will be examining possible op
tions for student control of
projects at Tresidder, he said.
Students are already running
the Coffee House, and in the
future, other student-run
projects such as a cooperative

store or an equipment rental
center may be feasible, accord
ing to Ventresca. But,students
should not advance too quickly
on the notion that they may take
over effective control of the
Union, he added. "Students
have learned a lot this year.
There is a difference between
having input and holding final
responsibility for decisions. To
go beyond just having input re
quires a lot more," Ventresca
said.
Although students should pro
vide input in the operation of
Tresidder, "there is a dif
ference between that and run
ning the place. Students cannot
just walk in and, boom, have all

the answers," according to
Theresa-Marie Rhyne, a mem
ber of the Union Board Space
Committee and a former intern
in the University's Office of
Management and Budget.
Tresidder is different from
other college unions be
cause it was designed to
be a community union rather
than just a student union, Op

penheim said. At the University
of Wisconsin and UC-Berkeley,
for example, students pay a
mandatory union fee each se
mester to support their union,
she pointed out. Tresidder, on
the other hand, receives direct
University funding for expenses
not covered by revenues, Op
penheim said.
Although students here do not
play as great a role in operating
Tresidder as they do at colleges
elsewhere, they do have an op
portunity to get involved in
union management through the
Union Board, STARTS and stu
dent internships, Oppenheim
said. Such opportunities are im
portant because any college

union should be more than just a
"service station" — it should be
part of the informal educational
structure of the University, she
said.
STARTS, for example, gives
students a chance to learn about
the organization of an event, to
set priorities, make a budget
and to see the successful pro
duction of a show, Oppenheim
said.
The program has come a long
way from the early 1970s when
the only music presented was
limited recitals put on by stu
dents in the music department
and an occasional wandering
guitar player performing on the
steps, Martin said. Three stu
dents were members of
STARTS when the board first
started in 1974. This year there
are 61 students involved in put
ting on events that number at
least one a night, every night of
the week, she said.
Students are the prime mov
ers behind STARTS, Martin
said. Ideas that percolate up
from students go to the board
where they are reviewed and
then put into production, Martin
said.
Although Tresidder has
come a long way, it still
must overcome many
hurdles before it gains the stat
ure of a true central meeting
place of the campus.
"Tresidder s image is a hold
over from the early 1970s — it
has changed, but we haven't
done a very good job of letting
people know that we have
changed, Oppenheim said. In

addition, the Union is suffering
from a space shortage, she said.
"We have to turn away many re
quests for meeting space be
cause we are booked." It may be
possible to expand Tresidder in
three to five years, but it is too
early to make any firm predic
tions, she said.
Tresidder must also compete
with the dormitory based, resi
dential education policy of the
University, Oppenheim said.
"In a school like Wisconsin, the
student union is the meeting
place for the community —
dorms are just places to sleep,"
she said. The strong residential
education system here provides
a great deal of a ser.se of com
munity for students, and thus
Tresidder must try to performs
functions that are complemen
tary to activities in dormitories,
she said.
To improve its image in the
community and provide better
service, the Transition will un
dergo nearly $250,000 worth of
renovations beginning this
spring. The three or four years
of upgrading and improvement
of internal maintenance have
been valuable, Ventresca said
"But it is time to go public —
people need to see that Tres
idder is improving," he said.
The renovations will include
new lighting, carpeting, paint,
tables and other amenities de
signed to make the Transition
"more of a hangout place," ac
cording to Howe.

The new 800-person
dormitory the University is
building next to Lagunita should
also help to entrench Tresidder
as an integral part of the Uni
versity's social life, he said.
"Tresidder stands to become a
logical meeting place for stu
dents from that side of campus
who want to get together with
students from Wilbur/' Howe
said.
"Today, Tresidder is bloom
ing. It is starting to grow and
change. to give it a cou
ple of years to see if the new im
age will take hold." Ventresca
said.

students, faculty and staff a
chance to advise Tresidder
management — to the ballroom
dance classes held in the eve
nings, there has been a re
vitalization of the notion that

'TTiere is a difference between (providing
input) and running the place. Students
cannot just walk in and, boom, have all the
answers.'

Tresidder Union should be more
I than "just a place to stop and tie
your shoe," according to Jean
Martin, director of Student Arts
at Stanford (STARTS).
Tresidder Union was dedi
cated in 1961 in memory of
Donald Tresidder, Stanford's
fourth president. Students
played a major role in the con
ception and funding of Tres
idder — a student fund that had
been formed in 1949 amassed
enough money to cover one
fourth of the construction costs.
At the dedication ceremony.
then-ASSU President Larry
Royse described the purpose of
the new community center:
"The Union also shall be part of
the informal educational pro
gram of the University. Its com
mittees, boards, and staffs shall
present a social, cultural, recre
ational and intellectual pro

gram for the whole campus."
Tresidder experienced
hard times in the late
1960s and early 1970s as a
number of factors converged,
according to Tresidder Director
Ellie Oppenheim. The most ap
parent symptom of the malaise
was the financial hardships
Tresidder encountered, Op
penheim said. A chart of Tres
idder's finances from its open
ing until the present shows large
deficits from 1967 to the
mid-19705. The depths of the fi
nancial crunch came in
1971-1972 when the figures "lit
erally fell off the chart," Op
penheim said.
To a large degree, the student
anti-war and civil rights unrest
that swept the campus was the
sickness responsible for the fi
nancial problems, Oppenheim
said. "Student involvement in
the University wavered, and in
put into Tresidder fell apart,"
she said. There were great soci
etal changes in the works, stu
dents' interests changed dra
matically, and "Tresidder
neither anticipated nor re

sponded to the changes," Op
penheim said.
"And the downward spiral
was made a whole lot worse
when programs were wiped out
to cut costs," she said.
In the 19605, students were
breaking windows at Tresidder
because they were angry at all
parts of the University adminis
tration, according to Martin.
They were protesting against
the University because it was
allowing things such as the draft
to happen to them, and they took
it out on the Union, Martin said.
"But today, Tresidder is on
the upswing," she said. The ad
ministration is eager to bring
students back to make Tres
idder a student and community
center once again, Martin
added.
Former Tresidder Director
Dan Williams, who left Stanford

last year to take a post at the
University of Oregon, worked
hard to provide Tresidder with a
"level of stability" upon which
Tresidder is now attempting to
build, Oppenheim said.
The Union Board symbol
izes that Tresidder has
emerged from its deepest
financial problems and is now
ready to look toward the future,
according to Union Board Chair
Sam Howe, a junior here. The
Board serves in an advisory ca
pacity, working with Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons
and Tresidder Director Op
penheim to "form a common vi
sion of what Tresidder could
be," Howe said. A Union Board
existed more than 10 years ago,
but was discontinued during the
great upheavals on campus, he
said.
The Union Board concerns
itself with programming at
Tresidder through STARTS, the
quality of the food through the
Food Committee, and the ap
propriate use of limited space
through a newly created Space
Committee, according to Howe.
In addition, the Union Board
will be examining possible op
tions for student control of
projects at Tresidder, he said.
Students are already running
the Coffee House, and in the
future, other student-run
projects such as a cooperative

store or an equipment rental
center may be feasible, accord
ing to Ventresca. But,students
should not advance too quickly
on the notion that they may take
over effective control of the
Union, he added. "Students
have learned a lot this year.
There is a difference between
having input and holding final
responsibility for decisions. To
go beyond just having input re
quires a lot more," Ventresca
said.
Although students should pro
vide input in the operation of
Tresidder, "there is a dif
ference between that and run
ning the place. Students cannot
just walk in and, boom, have all

the answers," according to
Theresa-Marie Rhyne, a mem
ber of the Union Board Space
Committee and a former intern
in the University's Office of
Management and Budget.
Tresidder is different from
other college unions be
cause it was designed to
be a community union rather
than just a student union, Op

penheim said. At the University
of Wisconsin and UC-Berkeley,
for example, students pay a
mandatory union fee each se
mester to support their union,
she pointed out. Tresidder, on
the other hand, receives direct
University funding for expenses
not covered by revenues, Op
penheim said.
Although students here do not
play as great a role in operating
Tresidder as they do at colleges
elsewhere, they do have an op
portunity to get involved in
union management through the
Union Board, STARTS and stu
dent internships, Oppenheim
said. Such opportunities are im
portant because any college

union should be more than just a
"service station" — it should be
part of the informal educational
structure of the University, she
said.
STARTS, for example, gives
students a chance to learn about
the organization of an event, to
set priorities, make a budget
and to see the successful pro
duction of a show, Oppenheim
said.
The program has come a long
way from the early 1970s when
the only music presented was
limited recitals put on by stu
dents in the music department
and an occasional wandering
guitar player performing on the
steps, Martin said. Three stu
dents were members of
STARTS when the board first
started in 1974. This year there
are 61 students involved in put
ting on events that number at
least one a night, every night of
the week, she said.
Students are the prime mov
ers behind STARTS, Martin
said. Ideas that percolate up
from students go to the board
where they are reviewed and
then put into production, Martin
said.
Although Tresidder has
come a long way, it still
must overcome many
hurdles before it gains the stat
ure of a true central meeting
place of the campus.
"Tresidder s image is a hold
over from the early 1970s — it
has changed, but we haven't
done a very good job of letting
people know that we have
changed, Oppenheim said. In



— Daily photos by Artie Streiber
addition, the Union is suffering
from a space shortage, she said.
"We have to turn away many re
quests for meeting space be
cause we are booked." It may be
possible to expand Tresidder in
three to five years, but it is too
early to make any firm predic
tions, she said.
Tresidder must also compete
with the dormitory based, resi
dential education policy of the
University, Oppenheim said.
"In a school like Wisconsin, the
student union is the meeting
place for the community —
dorms are just places to sleep,"
she said. The strong residential
education system here provides
a great deal of a ser.se of com
munity for students, and thus
Tresidder must try to performs
functions that are complemen
tary to activities in dormitories,
she said.
To improve its image in the
community and provide better
service, the Transition will un
dergo nearly $250,000 worth of
renovations beginning this
spring. The three or four years
of upgrading and improvement
of internal maintenance have
been valuable, Ventresca said
"But it is time to go public —
people need to see that Tres
idder is improving," he said.
The renovations will include
new lighting, carpeting, paint,
tables and other amenities de
signed to make the Transition
"more of a hangout place," ac
cording to Howe.

The new 800-person
dormitory the University is
building next to Lagunita should
also help to entrench Tresidder
as an integral part of the Uni
versity's social life, he said.
"Tresidder stands to become a
logical meeting place for stu
dents from that side of campus
who want to get together with
students from Wilbur/' Howe
said.
"Today, Tresidder is bloom
ing. It is starting to grow and
change. to give it a cou
ple of years to see if the new im
age will take hold." Ventresca
said.
On a given day. Tresidder
Union is vibrant and alive
with activity. Musical
groups often play in the noon
time sun for crowds of office
workers, students and pro
fessors taking a break from the
rigors of the academic com
munity. During the evening,
community residents may par
ticipate in ballroom dancing les
sons, karate classes or even
brass rubbing sessions, all spon
sored by Tresidder.
Tresidder Union has emerged
from the dark ages of just a few
years ago into "a period of ren
aissance", according to Council
of Presidents member Marc
Ventresca.
The signs of this renaissance
are apparent throughout Tres
idder. From the new Union
Board — begun this year to give
students, faculty and staff a
chance to advise Tresidder
management — to the ballroom
dance classes held in the eve

been formed in 1949 amassed

then-ASSU President Larry
Royse described the purpose of
the new community center:
"The Union also shall be part of
the informal educational pro
gram of the University. Its com
mittees, boards, and staffs shall
present a social, cultural, recre
ational and intellectual pro

gram for the whole campus."
Tresidder experienced
hard times in the late
1960s and early 1970s as a
number of factors converged,
according to Tresidder Director
Ellie Oppenheim. The most ap
parent symptom of the malaise
was the financial hardships
Tresidder encountered, Op
penheim said. A chart of Tres
idder's finances from its open
ing until the present shows large
deficits from 1967 to the
mid-19705. The depths of the fi
nancial crunch came in
1971-1972 when the figures "lit
erally fell off the chart," Op
penheim said.
To a large degree, the student
anti-war and civil rights unrest
that swept the campus was the
sickness responsible for the fi
nancial problems, Oppenheim
said. "Student involvement in
the University wavered, and in
put into Tresidder fell apart,"
she said. There were great soci
etal changes in the works, stu
dents' interests changed dra
matically, and "Tresidder
neither anticipated nor re

sponded to the changes," Op
penheim said.
"And the downward spiral
was made a whole lot worse
when programs were wiped out
to cut costs," she said.
In the 19605, students were
breaking windows at Tresidder
because they were angry at all
parts of the University adminis
tration, according to Martin.
They were protesting against
the University because it was
allowing things such as the draft
to happen to them, and they took
it out on the Union, Martin said.
"But today, Tresidder is on
the upswing," she said. The ad
ministration is eager to bring
students back to make Tres
idder a student and community
center once again, Martin
added.
Former Tresidder Director
Dan Williams, who left Stanford

last year to take a post at the
University of Oregon, worked
hard to provide Tresidder with a
"level of stability" upon which
Tresidder is now attempting to
build, Oppenheim said.
The Union Board symbol
izes that Tresidder has
emerged from its deepest
financial problems and is now
ready to look toward the future,
according to Union Board Chair
Sam Howe, a junior here. The
Board serves in an advisory ca
pacity, working with Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons
and Tresidder Director Op
penheim to "form a common vi
sion of what Tresidder could
be," Howe said. A Union Board
existed more than 10 years ago,
but was discontinued during the
great upheavals on campus, he
said.
The Union Board concerns
itself with programming at
Tresidder through STARTS, the
quality of the food through the
Food Committee, and the ap
propriate use of limited space
through a newly created Space
Committee, according to Howe.
In addition, the Union Board
will be examining possible op
tions for student control of
projects at Tresidder, he said.
Students are already running
the Coffee House, and in the
future, other student-run
projects such as a cooperative

store or an equipment rental
center may be feasible, accord
ing to Ventresca. But,students
should not advance too quickly
on the notion that they may take
over effective control of the
Union, he added. "Students
have learned a lot this year.
There is a difference between
having input and holding final
responsibility for decisions. To
go beyond just having input re
quires a lot more," Ventresca
said.
Although students should pro
vide input in the operation of
Tresidder, "there is a dif
ference between that and run
ning the place. Students cannot
just walk in and, boom, have all

the answers," according to
Theresa-Marie Rhyne, a mem
ber of the Union Board Space
Committee and a former intern
in the University's Office of
Management and Budget.
Tresidder is different from
other college unions be
cause it was designed to
be a community union rather
than just a student union, Op

penheim said. At the University
of Wisconsin and UC-Berkeley,
for example, students pay a
mandatory union fee each se
mester to support their union,
she pointed out. Tresidder, on
the other hand, receives direct
University funding for expenses
not covered by revenues, Op
penheim said.
Although students here do not
play as great a role in operating
Tresidder as they do at colleges
elsewhere, they do have an op
portunity to get involved in
union management through the
Union Board, STARTS and stu
dent internships, Oppenheim
said. Such opportunities are im
portant because any college

union should be more than just a
"service station" — it should be
part of the informal educational
structure of the University, she
said.
STARTS, for example, gives
students a chance to learn about
the organization of an event, to
set priorities, make a budget
and to see the successful pro
duction of a show, Oppenheim
said.
The program has come a long
way from the early 1970s when
the only music presented was
limited recitals put on by stu
dents in the music department
and an occasional wandering
guitar player performing on the
steps, Martin said. Three stu
dents were members of
STARTS when the board first
started in 1974. This year there
are 61 students involved in put
ting on events that number at
least one a night, every night of
the week, she said.
Students are the prime mov
ers behind STARTS, Martin
said. Ideas that percolate up
from students go to the board
where they are reviewed and
then put into production, Martin
said.
Although Tresidder has
come a long way, it still
must overcome many
hurdles before it gains the stat
ure of a true central meeting
place of the campus.
"Tresidder s image is a hold
over from the early 1970s — it
has changed, but we haven't
done a very good job of letting
people know that we have
changed, Oppenheim said. In

addition, the Union is suffering
from a space shortage, she said.
"We have to turn away many re
quests for meeting space be
cause we are booked." It may be
possible to expand Tresidder in
three to five years, but it is too
early to make any firm predic
tions, she said.
Tresidder must also compete
with the dormitory based, resi
dential education policy of the
University, Oppenheim said.
"In a school like Wisconsin, the
student union is the meeting
place for the community —
dorms are just places to sleep,"
she said. The strong residential
education system here provides
a great deal of a ser.se of com
munity for students, and thus
Tresidder must try to performs
functions that are complemen
tary to activities in dormitories,
she said.
To improve its image in the
community and provide better
service, the Transition will un
dergo nearly $250,000 worth of
renovations beginning this
spring. The three or four years
of upgrading and improvement
of internal maintenance have
been valuable, Ventresca said
"But it is time to go public —
people need to see that Tres
idder is improving," he said.
The renovations will include
new lighting, carpeting, paint,
tables and other amenities de
signed to make the Transition
"more of a hangout place," ac
cording to Howe.

The new 800-person
dormitory the University is
building next to Lagunita should
also help to entrench Tresidder
as an integral part of the Uni
versity's social life, he said.
"Tresidder stands to become a
logical meeting place for stu
dents from that side of campus
who want to get together with
students from Wilbur/' Howe
said.
"Today, Tresidder is bloom
ing. It is starting to grow and
change. to give it a cou
ple of years to see if the new im
age will take hold." Ventresca
said.
On a given day. Tresidder
Union is vibrant and alive
with activity. Musical
groups often play in the noon
time sun for crowds of office
workers, students and pro
fessors taking a break from the
rigors of the academic com
munity. During the evening,
community residents may par
ticipate in ballroom dancing les
sons, karate classes or even
brass rubbing sessions, all spon
sored by Tresidder.
Tresidder Union has emerged
from the dark ages of just a few
years ago into "a period of ren
aissance", according to Council
of Presidents member Marc
Ventresca.
The signs of this renaissance
are apparent throughout Tres
idder. From the new Union
Board — begun this year to give
students, faculty and staff a
chance to advise Tresidder
management — to the ballroom
dance classes held in the eve
nings, there has been a re
vitalization of the notion that

'TTiere is a difference between (providing
input) and running the place. Students
cannot just walk in and, boom, have all the
answers.'

Tresidder Union should be more
I than "just a place to stop and tie
your shoe," according to Jean
Martin, director of Student Arts
at Stanford (STARTS).
Tresidder Union was dedi
cated in 1961 in memory of
Donald Tresidder, Stanford's
fourth president. Students
played a major role in the con
ception and funding of Tres
idder — a student fund that had
been formed in 1949 amassed
enough money to cover one
fourth of the construction costs.
