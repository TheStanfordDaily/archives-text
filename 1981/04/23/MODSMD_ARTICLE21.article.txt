# Newly elected Senators face challenges
## Outgoing Senators warn against overenthusiasm 
### Richard Klingler 
Several members of the out
going ASSU Senate eval
uated the challenges that
face the senators elected on
April 15 and 16, and expressed
doubts as to the new senators'
perception of their impending
tasks. v
"Some of the senators who
are coming in bright-eyed and
ready to make big changes
aren't aware of how many peo
ple benefit from the ASSU and of
what the ASSU does," said
ASSU Senator Sue Goldfarb, re
ferring to the attitude of many
of the recently elected Senators.
. Senator John Kinney drew
upon his own experience and
presented another evaluation of
the new senate's potential: "If
people are excited, there are a
lot of programs and services
that could be offered."

. . it will be a hard thing for some of them
to find they don '112 have all the answers."
— Doug Mitchell

These outgoing senators dis
cussed the need for informed
representatives who dedicate
themselves to establishing
priorities and making the ASSU
run efficiently with increased
student participation. They also
speculated on what the major
concerns and issues of the com
ing year might be.
Senate Chair Doug Mitchell
characterized the incoming sen
ators as being "very fresh with
the workings of the ASSU ... it
will be a hard thing for some of
them to find they don't have all
the answers."
Yet newly elected senator
Scott Parazynski pointed to sen
ator-elect Roc Blumenthal and
alternate-elect Rick Naimark
as people who are experienced
at working within the ASSU.

"It's a very tight senate that's
coming in," he added.
Goldfarb stressed the need
for senators to learn about the
complexities of their positions
— "senators get involved and
see it's not so easy to solve prob
lems," she said.
Senator-elect Tom Kohn dis
agreed ." I see the new SteAate as
really willing to work hard to be
accessible to students and rep
resent their views," he said.
"Every senate comes in ideal
istic and eager to implement
changes. We, too, will probably
come to the realization that we
can't change the world, but that
doesn't mean we will give up
trying."
Senator Rex Sharp said that
the new Council of Presi
dents (COP) and senate
chair will be important leaders
of the senate because new sena

tors "don't have the working
knowledge of the ASSU yet."
Many senators hope that mov
ing the election to spring quar
ter will allow time for the new
senate to organize during the re
mainder of the school year. Sen
ator John Lamb said there will
be "lots of orientation meet
ings, get-togethers, and help
from the current Senate."
Lamb. Mitchell, and Sharp
emphasized the importance of
directing senate action toward
specific goals. "One of the
things the senate is going to
have to do is build a set of
priorities." said Mitchell. "We
didn't do that this year."
Graduate senator Dave
Daleke said, "the first issue is
one of unity; this year's senate
fell apart at times." Lamb

linked unity with the need for
priorities, and said a unified
senate should "try to be re
alistic ... try to concentrate on
a few major things they want to
do."
The senate I 'will be effective
only if senators concentrate on
details and organization, ac
cording to Goldfarb. She said,
"the senate's day-to-day run
ning has to be fixed before big
problems can be solved," she
singled out defining committee
responsibilities and restructur
ing the fee assessment pro
cedure as areas that need to be
changed.
Many of the new Senators'
platforms advocated increasing
student participation in senate
activities and in ASSU govern
ment organizations. Outgoing
senators agree that student par
ticipation is vital to an active
senate, especially because the
recent voter turn-out was very
low (just over 20 percent of the
student body voted.)
Kinney said that, in addition
"to keeping the entire ASSU or
ganization running, ... the
greatest challenge is opening up
avenues of communication be
tween students and the senate."

ate's credibility depends upon
increased senate visibility
through dorm meetings, sherry
hours, publicizing activities, ad
vertising the internship pro
gram, and "doing tangible
things like providing coffee in
Meyer or hosting dances."
Sharp cautioned that pro
posals for representation
by district and greater sen
ate contact with dorms did not
work in the past, but he said the
senate should "direct en
thusiastic students so they don't
just bitch about problems. "
Daleke said student interest
in the senate might be increased
by advertising Open Forum,
which allows each of three
speakers five minutes to ad
dress the senate on any issue,
and by rotating the location of
senate meetings in the dorms:
"if we can't bring them (the stu
dents) to the meeting, bring the

meeting to them."
The senators were unanimous
in their judgment that the con
cert issue will demand a great
deal of the incoming senate's
time and concern.
"Concerts have to be a big is
sue in the coming year," said
Kinney, but he also said, "most
of the groundwork as been done
this year."

. . the greatest challenge is opening up
avenues of communication between students
and the senate."
— John Lamb

According to Mitchell, the
new senate will "have to be con
cerned with concerts, but not in
the fiery way they have so far."
Many incoming senators
promised increased control of
Tresidder Union — an issue that
has been a concern of many cur
rent senators and COP mem
bers. In contrast to the promises
of newly elected senators, cur
rent senators warned of limits
on how much the senate is able
to accomplish.
Sharp said altering control of
Tresidder created problems be
cause "the senate can't deal

directly with the Tresidder is
sue ... it must work through the
administration and the Tres
idder board." He said student
control of Tresidder "is an issue
that won't be dealt with quick
ly"
Daleke said the Coffee
Houses's change in man
agement could not be used as a

'We will probably come to the realization
that ive can't change the world, but that
doesn't mean we'll give up trying.'
— Tom Kohn

catalyst for immediate change
because its conditions were
unique, and said senate action
might be limited to improving
existing Tresidder services. He
also said the senate might ex

amine Tresidder as the eventual
site of an ASSU travel service, a
student-run ticket office, and a
credit union.
Senators suggested next
year's senate might address in
ternational issues, structural
changes in the senate, and
changes in the school's grading
policy.

Kinney said that although
many new senators
promised to avoid con
sidering national and interna
tional issues, the new senate
would be called upon to respond
to such issues as the El
Salvadoran conflict. He said the
way the senate considers each
issue "will be determined by its
own characteristics."
Both Lamb and Daleke said
new senators would have to
direct attention to grading poli
cy changes and represent stu
dent interests before the faculty
and administration.
The routine work of senate
committees will demand a
great deal of new senators'
time, according to Goldfarb.
Citing her own experience on
the Finance Committee, she
said, "the thrust of my time was
spent on financial matters when
my platform didn't have any
thing about it."
Graduate students concerns
may not occupy much of the sen
ate's energy, Daleke said. "The
ASSU is not the place for gradu
ate student issues to be aired,"
he said. Graduate students can
organize in other ways . . . and
go to the heart of the problem."
He cited the Graduate Student
Association (GSA) and efforts
to increase housing as examples
of graduate students organizing
to address their needs.
"We've had one meeting and
we all realize that its time to get

back to work to represent the
students better," Kohn as
serted. "Maybe I'm being ideal
istic, but we're going to fight for
new ideals whether they can re
ally come true or not,"

According to Mitchell, the
new senate will "have to be con

the fiery way they have so far."
Many incoming senators
promised increased control of
Tresidder Union — an issue that
has been a concern of many cur
rent senators and COP mem
bers. In contrast to the promises
of newly elected senators, cur
rent senators warned of limits
on how much the senate is able
to accomplish.
Sharp said altering control of
Tresidder created problems be
cause "the senate can't deal

control of Tresidder "is an issue

catalyst for immediate change
because its conditions were
unique, and said senate action
might be limited to improving
existing Tresidder services. He
also said the senate might ex

Kinney said that although

would be called upon to respond
to such issues as the El
Salvadoran conflict. He said the
way the senate considers each
issue "will be determined by its
own characteristics."
Both Lamb and Daleke said
new senators would have to
direct attention to grading poli
cy changes and represent stu

The routine work of senate
committees will demand a
great deal of new senators'
time, according to Goldfarb.
Citing her own experience on
the Finance Committee, she
said, "the thrust of my time was

Graduate students concerns
may not occupy much of the sen

ASSU is not the place for gradu

he said. Graduate students can
organize in other ways . . . and
go to the heart of the problem."
He cited the Graduate Student
Association (GSA) and efforts
to increase housing as examples
of graduate students organizing
to address their needs.

Lamb. Mitchell, and Sharp
emphasized the importance of
directing senate action toward
specific goals. "One of the
things the senate is going to
have to do is build a set of
priorities." said Mitchell. "We
didn't do that this year."
Graduate senator Dave
Daleke said, "the first issue is
one of unity; this year's senate
fell apart at times." Lamb

linked unity with the need for
priorities, and said a unified
senate should "try to be re
alistic ... try to concentrate on
a few major things they want to
do."
The senate I 'will be effective
only if senators concentrate on
details and organization, ac

Many senators hope that mov
ing the election to spring quar
ter will allow time for the new
senate to organize during the re
mainder of the school year. Sen
ator John Lamb said there will
be "lots of orientation meet
ings, get-togethers, and help
from the current Senate."
Lamb. Mitchell, and Sharp
emphasized the importance of
directing senate action toward
specific goals. "One of the
things the senate is going to
have to do is build a set of
priorities." said Mitchell. "We
didn't do that this year."
Graduate senator Dave
Daleke said, "the first issue is
one of unity; this year's senate
fell apart at times." Lamb

linked unity with the need for
priorities, and said a unified
senate should "try to be re
alistic ... try to concentrate on
a few major things they want to
do."
The senate I 'will be effective
only if senators concentrate on
details and organization, ac
cording to Goldfarb. She said,
"the senate's day-to-day run
ning has to be fixed before big
problems can be solved," she
singled out defining committee
responsibilities and restructur
ing the fee assessment pro
cedure as areas that need to be
changed.
Many of the new Senators'
platforms advocated increasing
student participation in senate
activities and in ASSU govern
ment organizations. Outgoing
senators agree that student par
ticipation is vital to an active
senate, especially because the
recent voter turn-out was very
low (just over 20 percent of the
student body voted.)
Kinney said that, in addition
"to keeping the entire ASSU or
ganization running, ... the
greatest challenge is opening up
avenues of communication be
tween students and the senate."
Lamb said the incoming sen

ate's credibility depends upon
increased senate visibility
through dorm meetings, sherry
hours, publicizing activities, ad
vertising the internship pro
gram, and "doing tangible
things like providing coffee in
Meyer or hosting dances."
Sharp cautioned that pro
posals for representation
by district and greater sen
ate contact with dorms did not
work in the past, but he said the
senate should "direct en
thusiastic students so they don't
just bitch about problems. "
Daleke said student interest
in the senate might be increased
by advertising Open Forum,
which allows each of three
speakers five minutes to ad
dress the senate on any issue,
and by rotating the location of
senate meetings in the dorms:
"if we can't bring them (the stu
dents) to the meeting, bring the

meeting to them."
The senators were unanimous
in their judgment that the con
cert issue will demand a great
deal of the incoming senate's
time and concern.
"Concerts have to be a big is
sue in the coming year," said
Kinney, but he also said, "most
of the groundwork as been done
this year."

. . the greatest challenge is opening up
avenues of communication between students
and the senate."
— John Lamb

According to Mitchell, the
new senate will "have to be con
cerned with concerts, but not in
the fiery way they have so far."
Many incoming senators
promised increased control of
Tresidder Union — an issue that
has been a concern of many cur
rent senators and COP mem
bers. In contrast to the promises
of newly elected senators, cur
rent senators warned of limits
on how much the senate is able
to accomplish.
Sharp said altering control of
Tresidder created problems be
cause "the senate can't deal

directly with the Tresidder is
sue ... it must work through the
administration and the Tres
idder board." He said student
control of Tresidder "is an issue
that won't be dealt with quick
ly"
Daleke said the Coffee
Houses's change in man
agement could not be used as a

'We will probably come to the realization
that ive can't change the world, but that
doesn't mean we'll give up trying.'
— Tom Kohn

catalyst for immediate change
because its conditions were
unique, and said senate action
might be limited to improving
existing Tresidder services. He
also said the senate might ex

amine Tresidder as the eventual
site of an ASSU travel service, a
student-run ticket office, and a
credit union.
Senators suggested next
year's senate might address in
ternational issues, structural
changes in the senate, and
changes in the school's grading
policy.

Kinney said that although
many new senators
promised to avoid con
sidering national and interna
tional issues, the new senate
would be called upon to respond
to such issues as the El
Salvadoran conflict. He said the
way the senate considers each
issue "will be determined by its
own characteristics."
Both Lamb and Daleke said
new senators would have to
direct attention to grading poli
cy changes and represent stu
dent interests before the faculty
and administration.
The routine work of senate
committees will demand a
great deal of new senators'
time, according to Goldfarb.
Citing her own experience on
the Finance Committee, she
said, "the thrust of my time was
spent on financial matters when
my platform didn't have any
thing about it."
Graduate students concerns
may not occupy much of the sen
ate's energy, Daleke said. "The
ASSU is not the place for gradu
ate student issues to be aired,"
he said. Graduate students can
organize in other ways . . . and
go to the heart of the problem."
He cited the Graduate Student
Association (GSA) and efforts
to increase housing as examples
of graduate students organizing
to address their needs.
"We've had one meeting and
we all realize that its time to get

back to work to represent the
students better," Kohn as
serted. "Maybe I'm being ideal
istic, but we're going to fight for
new ideals whether they can re
ally come true or not,"
Several members of the out
going ASSU Senate eval
uated the challenges that
face the senators elected on
April 15 and 16, and expressed
doubts as to the new senators'
perception of their impending
tasks. v
"Some of the senators who
are coming in bright-eyed and
ready to make big changes
aren't aware of how many peo
ple benefit from the ASSU and of
what the ASSU does," said
ASSU Senator Sue Goldfarb, re
ferring to the attitude of many
of the recently elected Senators.
. Senator John Kinney drew
upon his own experience and
presented another evaluation of
the new senate's potential: "If
people are excited, there are a
lot of programs and services
that could be offered."

. . it will be a hard thing for some of them
to find they don '112 have all the answers."
— Doug Mitchell

These outgoing senators dis
cussed the need for informed
representatives who dedicate
themselves to establishing
priorities and making the ASSU
run efficiently with increased
student participation. They also
speculated on what the major
concerns and issues of the com
ing year might be.
Senate Chair Doug Mitchell
characterized the incoming sen
ators as being "very fresh with
the workings of the ASSU ... it
will be a hard thing for some of
them to find they don't have all
the answers."
Yet newly elected senator
Scott Parazynski pointed to sen
ator-elect Roc Blumenthal and
alternate-elect Rick Naimark
as people who are experienced
at working within the ASSU.

"It's a very tight senate that's
coming in," he added.
Goldfarb stressed the need
for senators to learn about the
complexities of their positions
— "senators get involved and
see it's not so easy to solve prob
lems," she said.
Senator-elect Tom Kohn dis
agreed ." I see the new SteAate as
really willing to work hard to be
accessible to students and rep
resent their views," he said.
"Every senate comes in ideal
istic and eager to implement
changes. We, too, will probably
come to the realization that we
can't change the world, but that
doesn't mean we will give up
trying."
Senator Rex Sharp said that
the new Council of Presi
dents (COP) and senate
chair will be important leaders
of the senate because new sena

tors "don't have the working
knowledge of the ASSU yet."
Many senators hope that mov
ing the election to spring quar
ter will allow time for the new
senate to organize during the re
mainder of the school year. Sen

be "lots of orientation meet
