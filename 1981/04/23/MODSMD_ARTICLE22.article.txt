## Giscard d'Estaing favored in French election Sunday 
### Los Angeles Times 
Paris — The French presiden
tial election campaign has
moved into the home stretch
with President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing battling challenges on
his left and right for another
seven-year term of office.
Ten candidates will be on the
ballot in the first round of voting
Sunday. A runoff between the
top two will take place on Mav
10.
While the odds still favor
Giscard d'Estaing's re-election,
it is no longer a certainty. The
final public opinion polls (by law
there can be none in the final
seven days of the campaign)
show a continuing surge of
strength for Gaullist candidate
Jacques Chirac, the favorite of
the right.
Poll
A poll published in the news
paper Le Figaro over the week
end. put Giscard d'Estaing at
27.5 percent, Socialist Party
candidate Francois Mitterrand
at 22 percent. Chirac at 19.5 per
cent, and Communist leader
Georges Marchais at 18.5 per
cent.
However, if the polling trends
continue in this final week of the
campaign, Sunday's first round
outcome may be closer. The
president has consistently
fallen in the polls since a 35 per
cent mark three months ago.

Perhaps the most important
poll result of all in the Le Figaro
study showed 19 percent of the
voters undecided a week before
election.
The biggest surprise of the
lackluster campaign has been
the unexpectedly strong per
formance of Chirac. As leader
of the Gaullist party, the Rally
for the Republic, Chirac has
won enough support to possibly
oust Mitterrand on the first
ballot.
Runoff
A runoff battle between
Giscard d'Estaing and Chirac,
both appealing to the same cen
ter-right electorate that has
been choosing the leaders of
France since Gen. Charles de
Gaulle took power in 1958, would
have profound implications for
French politics whatever the
outcome. The odds would favor
the president because he would
gain the bulk of the Socialist-
Communist vote, which would
have no place else to go.
Chirac, who served for two
years as Giscard's premier in
1974-76 and then formed an im
portant power base of his own by
taking over the leadership of the
Gaullist party and winning the
mayoralty of Paris, is exuding
confidence in the home stretch.
He is a man of driving personal
ambition, rather than any par
ticular political originality, and

the Gaullist Party machinery
appears stronger than that of
Giscard d'Estaing's party, the
Union for French Democracy.
Others
The remaining six can
didates, ranging from an
ecologist to a Trotskyite, are not
expected to pull much more
than 15 percent on the total vote.
The French therefore will be
choosing from the same politi
cal figures they have been look
ing at. listening to and voting for
since the late 19605. None of the
candidates has had much new to
offer, and the choice is largely
one of personalities rather than
policies or programs.
Giscard d'Estaing adopted an
attitude of lofty indifference
during the early, informal cam
paigning of a monarch above the
mud of politics. But this has not
worked.
'Citizen candidate'
So when the campaign opened
formally on April 9. he came
down from the presidential
throne and announced that he
was simply a "citizen can
didate." This prompted one
commentator to remark that he
is an ordinary citizen in the
same sense that Marie An
toinette was an ordinary
shepherdess.
Mitterrand called him the
"outgoing candidate."
As for issues, the central
problem of France is unemploy
ment, now pushing 1.6 million,
better than 7 percent of the la
bor force.
Giscard d'Estaing, never
hesitant to use the power of the
presidency in his campaign, has
announced a joint program with
West Germany to borrow nearly
$11 billion for investment pro
grams to stimulate the two
economies.
The French president has
said that he will progressively
reduce the retirement age to 58
to counter unemployment. Mit
terrand, on the other hand, says
that he will reduce the work
week from 40 to 35 hours without
cutting wages.

Sands wins seat, still fasting
Bernadette Devlin McAliskey last week directed the final
moments of jailed IRA gunman Bobby Sands' successful
campaign for British Parliament. Sands, on the 54th day of a
hunger strike to gain political prisoner status, was reported
near-comatose yesterday, with an estimated five to six days
left to live. A papal initiative was launched to end the strike.
Meanwhile, Catholic youths in Londonderry rioted again in
the ninth straight day of violence there. They were protesting
yesterday the killing of two youths Sunday.
