# El Salvador president asks for more arms
## 
### Washington Post 
San Salvador, El Salvador â€”
Despite previous insistence that
El Salvador has all the military
equipment it needs from the
United States, President Jose
Napoleon Duarte made a pitch
Monday for additional U.S.
arms, including helicopters.
Duarte, the civilian head of
El Salvador's governing junta,
said, however, that his country
would continue to oppose the in
troduction here of any foreign
combat troops, regardless of na
tionality.
Speaking at a news con
ference after an hour-and-a-half
meeting with visiting U.S. Rep.
Robert Dornan (R-Calif.),
Duarte said he urged the con
gressman to help El Salvador
obtain needed additional mili
tary and economic aid.
"I told the congressman that
we need more military equip
ment to get the capacity to con
trol our country," Duarte said.
"We need more military equip
ment, including more heli
copters, and the means to pro
tect them."
No detailed list
U.S. Embassy officials said
later, however, that no specific
detailed shopping list had been
presented to Dornan, who sits
on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
As a result of a special $5.2
million package from the Carter
administration in January and
an additional $25 million pack
age in March from the Reagan
administration, El Salvador has
received 10 Huey combat trans
port helicopters, ground troop
transports and infantry combat
weapons and ammunition as
well as 54 U.S. military advisers
to instruct the Salvadoran
armed forces.
Duarte and other junta mem
bers repeatedly have stated in
public that El Salvador did not

need any more military help and
have added that even before this
equipment arrived the
Salvadoran armed forces had
managed to defeat, or at least
contain, the "final offensive"
against the government
launched in January with little
success by the leftist guerrillas.
Administration defends
The Reagan administration,
defending its program while
being buffeted by charges that it
could lead to an involvement
reminiscent of Vietnam, has
said recently that the current
level of aid to El Salvador is suf
ficient.
In addition to requesting this
new, if undetailed military aid,
Duarte indicated he would wel
come more U.S. military
trainers to instruct his troops as
long as they had no combat role
in El Salvador.
Dornan said that as a result of
his talks with Duarte he would
ask Congress to double its eco
nomic aid to El Salvador.
Duarte had expressed apprecia
tion for the $62 million in eco
nomic aid given to El Salvador
by Washington but said the
country needed $200 million to
$300 million.
Charges
At his press conference,
Duarte brushed aside charges of
government foot-dragging in its
investigations of the murders of
six U.S. citizens here since De
cember and said the arrest last
week of two Salvadorans in one
of the cases was a significant
breakthrough.
He confirmed U.S. reports
that his government had suc
ceeded in linking two prominent
Salvadorans to the gangland
style slaying in January of two
U.S. agricultural advisers and
their Salvadoran host. But he
stopped short of saying that
Hans Christ, arrested by the
FBI on a Salvadoran request

last week in Miami, and Ricardo
Sol Meza, arrested here April 4,
would be charged with murder
in the case. He said the actual
charges were up to the courts
and that "others" were in
volved.
Murder investigation
Duarte also denied accusa
tions by some U.S. diplomats
here that an investigation of the
murder in December of three
American nuns and a lay worker
was being conducted at a
"glacially slow pace."
He insisted that much has

been established in the govern
ment's autopsy of the women,
who had been shot to death and
hastily buried alongside a road
outside the capital. He said that
they had been killed with G-3 as
sault rifle ammunition dated
1953, five years before the
Salvadoran government first re
ceived that type of weapon.
Some U.S. Embassy officials
here believe that official
Salvadoran security forces
were involved in the women's
murders.
