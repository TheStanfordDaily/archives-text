# Botha slides right for election

### Los Angeles Times 
Johannesburg, South Africa — With general
elections only a few days away, Prime Minister
Pieter Botha is encountering growing resistance
to his program of moderating racial discrimina
tion against South Africa's black majority, and
has taken a tougher stance against black leaders.
In the latest instance, Botha's government
withdrew the passport of Bishop Desmond Tutu,
who recently returned from a trip to Europe and
the United States where he denounced the racist
policies of the all-white regime.
Tutu, an Anglican churchman and leading black
nationalist, is general secretary of the South
African Council of Churches. His passport was
withdrawn last week, barring for now any foreign
travel.
Ciskei
Last week, white citizens of King Williams
Town were assured by Pieter Koornhof, Botha's
minister of development, that the city will not be
incorporated into the black homeland of Ciskei.
Botha's decision was contrary to a government
commission's recommendation that King Wil
liams Town be consolidated with Ciskei to make
the tribal area economically viable.
Ciskei will be declared an independent state at
the end of this year under the government's home
land program of granting autonomy to tribal
areas. None of the independent homelands have
received international recognition.
Another example of Botha's backsliding on his
moderate policies involves the black labor unions
that won official recognition a year ago.

Botha's retreat, political observers believe, has
come in the face of the strength shown by the ex
treme right-wing Herstigte Nasionale Party in its
campaign to capture its first parliamentary
seats. The party wants to keep the country's legal
separation of blacks and other non-white races in
tact, and to use armed force against dissidents.
Botha is also struggling to hold on to the loyalty
of the right wing in the ruling National Party.
Most observers believe that Botha's decision in
this final stage of the campaign to avoid even the
rhetoric of reform is a political ploy, however,
and that he will push ahead with moderating the
country's race laws after his return to office.
However, if the Herstigte Nasionale - a
splinter group that broke away from the National
Party in 1969 — does gain a few seats in Par
liament, it will have a platform for its right-wing
views and could eventually become a sizable op
position.
Soft-pedal
So in recent weeks the prime minister has
begun to soft-pedal his earlier advocacy of extend
ing more economic and social rights to blacks,
while continuing to deny them political rights!
Botha and other National Party campaigners
have also downgraded the significance of changes
that have been made in discrimination practices,
such as the elimination of separate entrances for
blacks and whites to public offices.
Botha's campaigners have been stressing as a
positive factor the gap between white and black
education, boasting that the government is spend
ing 12 times more to educate a white pupil than a
black child
