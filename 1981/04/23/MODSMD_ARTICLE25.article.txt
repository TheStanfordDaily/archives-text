## Southside live is five years too late 
### Pat O'Bannon 
Most live albums are
eminently disposable.
With few exceptions
(The Band's Rock of Ages, Neil
Young's Live Rust, and The J.
Geils Band's classic Full
House), their value is as concert
souvenirs, not music. I mean it
you wanted all that applause
you would've bought that sound
effects record in the bargain
bin.
One of the other major prob
lems with live albums is that
they always seem to be rec
orded a year or two after the
band has passed its peak, sound
ing tired and lackluster (listen
to most of Little Feat's Waiting
I for Columbus). This is a major
part of the problem with Reach
Up and Touch the Sky, South
side Johnny and the Asbury
Jukes new live album. The
Jukes are one of the best live
bands around, giving their all
every night — Southside once
whirled off a stage in Sacra
mento, cutting his hand up on
broken glass to the point where
it required microsurgery — but
the frenzy they whip up live got
lost somewhere between the
stage and this vinyl.

I had high hopes when I put
this record on the turntable. I
remembered the first time I
saw the Jukes live and figured
that if any band could knock out
a truly great live album it was
this one. It was almost five
years ago. Springsteen had
popped up on the covers of Time
and Newsweek in the same week
that year, and everybody sud
denly hailed from New Jersey.
Now the word was spreading
about a new band from Asbury
Park with an improbable name
that played R&B and had lots of
horns. Five of us went to the
show, which Elvin Bishop head
lined. Overalls and straw cow
boy hats were out in strength,
and we figured the Jukes didn't
have a chance, since nobody
else seemed to have ever heard
of them. The Jukes didn't care.
They poured out onto the stage,
crammed the horn section into a
space a good bit smaller than
the average apartment bath
room, and proceeded to tear the
place apart for 40 minutes.
Some of the cowboys nursed
their beers and hooted for
Bishop, others sat up and took
notice, and we stood on our
chairs and screamed ourselves
hoarse The fact that half the au
dience ignored them didn't
phase the Jukes in the slightest;
they seemed overjoyed to just
be playing, and the five crazies
down in front were merely an
added bonus.
Reach Up and Touch the
Sky wasn't recorded that
night. It should've been.
In the ensuing five years the
band has struggled to achieve
some degree of commercial
success, undergoing many per
sonnel changes, and moving
their music closer to main

stream rock and roll in the proc
ess. During the course of this
transformation the band's be
come saddled with material
markedly inferior to that on
their first three albums. Spring
steen and Miami Steve Van
Zandt wrote many of the songs
on these records, and their tunes
are vastly superior to the self
penned songs which currently
dominate Jukes albums. It is
these new songs which domi
nate Reach Up and Touch the
Sky, and they just don't carry
the punch and drive of the
band's early material. Cuts like
"I'm So Anxious" and "Why is
Love Such a Sacrifice," which
receive long workouts on this
album, sound tedious alongside
Springsteen's "Hearts of
Stone" and Van Zandt's "I Don't
Want to Go Home." The rock
and roll orientation of the new
tunes even spills over into the
versions of the old R&B songs.
"The Fever," a Springsteen
song written for the Jukes' first
album, is one of the great heart
breaking, gut-wrenching songs
of our time, but the version rec
orded here is terrible. The

band's pushing the tempo
through the whole number, at
tempting to convert an anguish
filled ballad into another
rocker. Instead of drowning in
angst, Southside's vocals sound
almost happy.
By the time I'd heard "The
Fever" on this album I
knew that the Jukes had
come up way short in any at
tempt to make the definitive
live album. I placed all my
hopes on Side Four, a collection
of Sam Cooke tunes and Chuck
Berry's "Back in the USA." The
Jukes traditionally include a
Sam Cooke medley at the end of
their shows which is guaranteed
to bring the most hostile crowd
to its feet, and I felt sure that
their cover of Chuck Berry
would at least be truer to the
spirit of the original than
Ronstadt's. Happily, Southside
Johnny Lyon can sing R&B
beautifully. He's able to move
effortlessly through Sam Cooke,
turning in a lovely version of
"You Send Me." My only com
plaint is that they crammed four
classic songs into a 3:45 medley.
You release a sigh of recogni

tion and appreciation and
wham, they're on to the next
one.
There's one classic cut on
Roach up and Touch the Sky.
The Jukes always close their
sets with Cooke's "Having a
Party." They've played it hun
dreds of times, and it always
comes out loose, joyous and
fresh. The band sounds more
comfortable playing R&B than
trying to kick out the Rock n'
Roll jams, and Southside sings
like he owns the song. The result
is that the listener finally, after
four sides and 10 bucks, gets a
hint of what this band is all
about. I wish this album had
been cut five years ago when the
Jukes were at their peak. The
frenzy, looseness, and boozy
good times this band exudes on
stage might then have domi
nated the entire album, not just
"Having a Party." As it is, I'll
always remember screaming
my lungs out from the top of my
chair in L.A. When it was all
over, Southside and the bass
player exchanged grins and
gave the five of us a thumbs up
as they left the stage.

whirled off a stage in Sacra
mento, cutting his hand up on
broken glass to the point where
it required microsurgery — but
the frenzy they whip up live got
lost somewhere between the
stage and this vinyl.

I had high hopes when I put
this record on the turntable. I
remembered the first time I
saw the Jukes live and figured
that if any band could knock out
a truly great live album it was
this one. It was almost five
years ago. Springsteen had
popped up on the covers of Time
and Newsweek in the same week
that year, and everybody sud
denly hailed from New Jersey.
Now the word was spreading
about a new band from Asbury
Park with an improbable name
that played R&B and had lots of
horns. Five of us went to the
show, which Elvin Bishop head
lined. Overalls and straw cow
boy hats were out in strength,
and we figured the Jukes didn't
have a chance, since nobody
else seemed to have ever heard
of them. The Jukes didn't care.
They poured out onto the stage,
crammed the horn section into a
space a good bit smaller than
the average apartment bath
room, and proceeded to tear the
place apart for 40 minutes.
Some of the cowboys nursed
their beers and hooted for
Bishop, others sat up and took
notice, and we stood on our
chairs and screamed ourselves
hoarse The fact that half the au
dience ignored them didn't
phase the Jukes in the slightest;
they seemed overjoyed to just
be playing, and the five crazies
down in front were merely an
added bonus.
Reach Up and Touch the
Sky wasn't recorded that
night. It should've been.
In the ensuing five years the
band has struggled to achieve
some degree of commercial
success, undergoing many per
sonnel changes, and moving
their music closer to main

stream rock and roll in the proc
ess. During the course of this
transformation the band's be
come saddled with material
markedly inferior to that on
their first three albums. Spring
steen and Miami Steve Van
Zandt wrote many of the songs
on these records, and their tunes
are vastly superior to the self
penned songs which currently
dominate Jukes albums. It is
these new songs which domi
nate Reach Up and Touch the
Sky, and they just don't carry
the punch and drive of the
band's early material. Cuts like
"I'm So Anxious" and "Why is
Love Such a Sacrifice," which
receive long workouts on this
album, sound tedious alongside
Springsteen's "Hearts of
Stone" and Van Zandt's "I Don't
Want to Go Home." The rock
and roll orientation of the new
tunes even spills over into the
versions of the old R&B songs.
"The Fever," a Springsteen
song written for the Jukes' first
album, is one of the great heart
breaking, gut-wrenching songs
of our time, but the version rec
orded here is terrible. The

band's pushing the tempo
through the whole number, at
tempting to convert an anguish
filled ballad into another
rocker. Instead of drowning in
angst, Southside's vocals sound
almost happy.
By the time I'd heard "The
Fever" on this album I
knew that the Jukes had
come up way short in any at
tempt to make the definitive
live album. I placed all my
hopes on Side Four, a collection
of Sam Cooke tunes and Chuck
Berry's "Back in the USA." The
Jukes traditionally include a
Sam Cooke medley at the end of
their shows which is guaranteed
to bring the most hostile crowd
to its feet, and I felt sure that
their cover of Chuck Berry
would at least be truer to the
spirit of the original than
Ronstadt's. Happily, Southside
Johnny Lyon can sing R&B
beautifully. He's able to move
effortlessly through Sam Cooke,
turning in a lovely version of
"You Send Me." My only com
plaint is that they crammed four
classic songs into a 3:45 medley.
You release a sigh of recogni

tion and appreciation and
wham, they're on to the next
one.
There's one classic cut on
Roach up and Touch the Sky.
The Jukes always close their
sets with Cooke's "Having a
Party." They've played it hun
dreds of times, and it always
comes out loose, joyous and
fresh. The band sounds more
comfortable playing R&B than
trying to kick out the Rock n'
Roll jams, and Southside sings
like he owns the song. The result
is that the listener finally, after
four sides and 10 bucks, gets a
hint of what this band is all
about. I wish this album had
been cut five years ago when the
Jukes were at their peak. The
frenzy, looseness, and boozy
good times this band exudes on
stage might then have domi
nated the entire album, not just
"Having a Party." As it is, I'll
always remember screaming
my lungs out from the top of my
chair in L.A. When it was all
over, Southside and the bass
player exchanged grins and
gave the five of us a thumbs up
as they left the stage.


Most live albums are
eminently disposable.
With few exceptions
(The Band's Rock of Ages, Neil
Young's Live Rust, and The J.
Geils Band's classic Full
House), their value is as concert
souvenirs, not music. I mean it
you wanted all that applause
you would've bought that sound
effects record in the bargain
bin.
One of the other major prob
lems with live albums is that
they always seem to be rec
orded a year or two after the
band has passed its peak, sound
ing tired and lackluster (listen
to most of Little Feat's Waiting
I for Columbus). This is a major
part of the problem with Reach
Up and Touch the Sky, South
side Johnny and the Asbury
Jukes new live album. The
Jukes are one of the best live
bands around, giving their all
every night — Southside once
whirled off a stage in Sacra
mento, cutting his hand up on

it required microsurgery — but
