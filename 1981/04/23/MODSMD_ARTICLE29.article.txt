# Starship's latest needs sense of humor
## 
### David Schmelzer 
Critics panned the last Jef
ferson Starship album.
They didn't Mke the direc
tion the group took after Grace
Slick and Marty Balin left, and
the Starship replaced them with
lead vocalist Mickey Thomas
from Elvin Bishop's band and
Journey's drummer Aynsley
Dunbar They complained that
they'd gone from being an in
novative force in music to being
just another pedestrian rock
band.
The album sold like crazy.
Well Grace Slick is back.
She's not a full-fledged band
member yet, but she does sing a
duet with Thomas and do some
backup vocals. It didn't make
that much difference. They're
still just another pedestrian
rock band.
More than likely the new
album. Modern Times, will sell
like crazy too.
There's nothing all that sur
prising or wrong with that.
While they aren't exceptional,
they're not bad either. They're
great to put on when you're
heading for the beach. They're
great to put on when you're in
the mood for rock and roll and
only rock and roll. They sound
terrific after you haven't heard
them in a while. All of these are
good reasons to buy an album.
The band has a place.
But while all that makes them
a useful.band, it doesn't make
them a particularly outstanding
band. True, they sound good af
ter you've forgotten about them
for some time and hear them
fresh, but you still forget about
them first. They have the op
posite problem than do bands
like Fleetwood Mac or The
Doobie Brothers, where the
writers are so stylistically dif
ferent that it's difficult for the
band to find a common identity.
In Jefferson Starship's case, it's
phenomenal how their three
main contributors, Paul
Kantner, Pete Sears, and Craig
Chaquico can sound so much
alike. Because of this, and be
cause none of them experiment
significantly with different
styles, the songs on Modern

Times sound pretty much the
same. The album could be a sin
gle suite with nine different
movements. Again, the music
isn't bad, just unmemorable.
Kantner comes up with the
most interesting stuff of the
three. The title song from Free
dom at Point Zero was a quirky,
'60s-style number, and on
Modern Times he again wrote
the most intriguing song.
"Stairway to Cleveland (We Do
What We Want)" is his shot at
those same critics who
criticized their new style. He re
sponds to what he sees as de
mands that the group continue
to put social comment in their
music by saying "Fuck you. We
do what we want." It may be a
bitter song, but it's not bland.
His other two songs, "Wild
Eyes" and "Modern Times" are
decent'enough rockers, but are
worth comment primarily for a
lyric from the first. It reads,
"Even telepathic chil
dren/Have to eat their vegeta
bles." Would you run that one by
me again?
Sears (sometimes with lyrics
from his wife Jenette) wrote
three songs for the album, two
of them about mysterious fig
ures. It's an interesting thought,
but it might have been a good
idea to save one of them for an
other record. The first,
"Strangers," relies on a heavy,
steady drum beat and good vo
cals from Thomas and Slick,
and seems likely to be a single.
An E.K.G. sound opens the sec
ond, "Alien," and sets the tone
for the rest of the song's use of
simulated racing and stopping
heartbeat. But even with these
distinctive features, unless
you're paying attention, both
songs blend into the rest of the
album. They, like the others,
use synthesizers, drums, and
pedal-steel guitars almost con
stantly.
Chaquico writes their catch
iest stuff. His "Find Your Way
Back" is the best of his songs on
the album because he occasion
ally lightens up on it. It opens
with one of the few acoustic
guitar passages on the album,
and on its chorus the group does
some harmonizing without the

heavy jamming in the back
ground that characterizes most
of his music. He could have
lightened up in more cases. Be
cause "Free" and "Mary" nev
er do this, rather than tripping
along with a delicate, fine
touch, they come across as
pounding and ponderous.
His problem is also the
group's problem. They take
themselves much too seriously.

It's hard to see them having any
fun as they play this music. The
picture, instead, is of a band res
olutely saying to the world that
they don't need Marty Balin or
any one else, and anybody who
doesn't like their new stuff can
go to a very warm place. Even
the song in which they discuss
this doesn't have much humor,
but only anger.
The band has talent. Aynsley

Dunbar is a better drummer
than most; Mickey Thomas can
do some good rock and roll sing
ing, and Paul Kantner is re
spected enough to have been
named the Bay Area musician
of the year a few weeks ago.
Now if they'd just cool down a
bit and be willing to try to do
more things than just heavy,
deadly serious rock, they could
be a good band. But they aren't
that yet.

the album because he occasion
ally lightens up on it. It opens
with one of the few acoustic
guitar passages on the album,
and on its chorus the group does
some harmonizing without the

heavy jamming in the back
ground that characterizes most
of his music. He could have
lightened up in more cases. Be
cause "Free" and "Mary" nev
er do this, rather than tripping
along with a delicate, fine
touch, they come across as
pounding and ponderous.
His problem is also the
group's problem. They take
themselves much too seriously.

It's hard to see them having any
fun as they play this music. The
picture, instead, is of a band res
olutely saying to the world that
they don't need Marty Balin or
any one else, and anybody who
doesn't like their new stuff can
go to a very warm place. Even
the song in which they discuss
this doesn't have much humor,
but only anger.
The band has talent. Aynsley

Dunbar is a better drummer
than most; Mickey Thomas can
do some good rock and roll sing
ing, and Paul Kantner is re
spected enough to have been
named the Bay Area musician
of the year a few weeks ago.
Now if they'd just cool down a
bit and be willing to try to do
more things than just heavy,
deadly serious rock, they could
be a good band. But they aren't
that yet.

Critics panned the last Jef
ferson Starship album.
They didn't Mke the direc
tion the group took after Grace
Slick and Marty Balin left, and
the Starship replaced them with
lead vocalist Mickey Thomas
from Elvin Bishop's band and
Journey's drummer Aynsley
Dunbar They complained that
they'd gone from being an in
novative force in music to being
just another pedestrian rock
band.
The album sold like crazy.
Well Grace Slick is back.
She's not a full-fledged band
member yet, but she does sing a
duet with Thomas and do some
backup vocals. It didn't make
that much difference. They're
still just another pedestrian
rock band.
More than likely the new
album. Modern Times, will sell
like crazy too.
There's nothing all that sur
prising or wrong with that.
While they aren't exceptional,
they're not bad either. They're
great to put on when you're
heading for the beach. They're
great to put on when you're in
the mood for rock and roll and
only rock and roll. They sound
terrific after you haven't heard
them in a while. All of these are
good reasons to buy an album.
The band has a place.
But while all that makes them
a useful.band, it doesn't make
them a particularly outstanding
band. True, they sound good af
ter you've forgotten about them
for some time and hear them
fresh, but you still forget about
them first. They have the op
posite problem than do bands
like Fleetwood Mac or The
Doobie Brothers, where the
writers are so stylistically dif
ferent that it's difficult for the
band to find a common identity.
In Jefferson Starship's case, it's
phenomenal how their three
main contributors, Paul
Kantner, Pete Sears, and Craig
Chaquico can sound so much
alike. Because of this, and be
cause none of them experiment
significantly with different
styles, the songs on Modern

Times sound pretty much the
same. The album could be a sin
gle suite with nine different
movements. Again, the music
isn't bad, just unmemorable.
Kantner comes up with the
most interesting stuff of the
three. The title song from Free
dom at Point Zero was a quirky,
'60s-style number, and on
Modern Times he again wrote
the most intriguing song.
"Stairway to Cleveland (We Do
What We Want)" is his shot at
those same critics who
criticized their new style. He re
sponds to what he sees as de
mands that the group continue
to put social comment in their
music by saying "Fuck you. We
do what we want." It may be a
bitter song, but it's not bland.
His other two songs, "Wild
Eyes" and "Modern Times" are
decent'enough rockers, but are
worth comment primarily for a
lyric from the first. It reads,
"Even telepathic chil
dren/Have to eat their vegeta
bles." Would you run that one by
me again?
Sears (sometimes with lyrics
from his wife Jenette) wrote
three songs for the album, two
of them about mysterious fig
ures. It's an interesting thought,
but it might have been a good
idea to save one of them for an
other record. The first,
"Strangers," relies on a heavy,
steady drum beat and good vo
cals from Thomas and Slick,
and seems likely to be a single.
An E.K.G. sound opens the sec
ond, "Alien," and sets the tone
for the rest of the song's use of
simulated racing and stopping
heartbeat. But even with these
distinctive features, unless
you're paying attention, both
songs blend into the rest of the
album. They, like the others,
use synthesizers, drums, and
pedal-steel guitars almost con
stantly.
Chaquico writes their catch
iest stuff. His "Find Your Way
Back" is the best of his songs on
the album because he occasion
ally lightens up on it. It opens
with one of the few acoustic
guitar passages on the album,
and on its chorus the group does
