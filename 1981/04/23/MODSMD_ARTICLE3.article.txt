Students living in the sheltered atmosphere of a college
campus often isolate themselves from the "real world,"
existing instead in the dream world of a private
university. With this magazine, we attempt to bridge this gap
by addressing a real issue — the unionization of clerical
workers — which is happening here on campus.
The issue of unionization has become increasingly volatile
during the past weeks as the election which will decide the
fate of the clerical's proposed union draws near. But in
coordinating the magazine, we tried to take a step back,
forget our prejudices, and present a fair picture of the
conflict — particularly in our interviews with Donald
Kennedy and Joyce Tipps-Coats, the major spokespersons
for each side of the conflict, and our independent survey. We
believe we have succeeded.
The survey itself, for us, represents an opportunity to put
aside the value-laden University "election bulletins" and
Office Staff Organizing Committee newsletters to hear
directly from the clerical and library workers themselves. It
is our hope that the results will offer our readers some insight
into the feelings of those who will be most directly affected
by the May 7 ballot.
For those who are unfamiliar with the issue of the clerical
worker's proposed union, we have a synopsis of the events
which led to the formation of the Office Staff Organizing
Committee, and an explanation of the more recent events at
the very heart of the present conflict.
We also present articles which fill in the organized labor
picture. The first is a brief history of unions at Stanford which
outlines the formation of the United Stanford Employees,
and the second is a look at the status of unions at other
universities.
But the world of the university is obviously important to
students at Stanford. Therefore, we offer an in-depth look
into Tresidder union, and how it is changing to better respond
to student needs.
In preparing this magazine we have met with situations
that were as challenging as any we have ever encountered,
and many a sleepless night was spent worrying whether our
decisions were indeed the right ones.
We would like to thank Shari Folz for her cover design, Kay
Magill, who tabulated and processed our statistical data.
Assoc. Prof. Diana Tillinghast, who offered her guidance
throughout the polling process, and all the clerical and
library workers who responded to our poll.
