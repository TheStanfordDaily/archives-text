# No open tear ducts at West Side Story

V"l"Test Side Story," if you
| mfm/ know it well enough, it
I T V is the kind of play that
you approach with anxiety and a
good deal of respect. Anxiety,
•because it is such a great play
you hope to God it's not going to
be done badly. And respect be
cause it is such a hard play to do.
The music is difficult. The danc-

ing is difficult. And the story is
difficult, particularly since if
you're not careful if can get a bit
sappy.
Ram's Head production of
"West Side Story" can make
your seat very uncomfortable at
times. Nick Bandouveris as
Tony is the production's major
miss. Granted his lines are
probably the worst of writer
Arthur Laurents' career and
thus hard to pull off with a mod
icum of feeling, but when Tony
falls bleeding into his beloved
Maria's arms, your tear ducts
ought to do something. Tony's
passionate intensity seems to

have tripped over a backstage
prop, able to come but limpingly
to life.
The show is very much worth
going to see, though, for Gwen
Eagleton's voice, for the danc
ing and for the Jets' "Gee, Of
ficer Krupke." The mainstay of
the production, the one thing the
entire company probably never
once doubted, is Gwen
Eagleton's (Maria) ability to hit

absolutely every note with oper
atic expertise. She doesn't look
or sound very Puerto Rican, but
if there is anyone in the cast who
does Stephen Sondheim-
Leonard Bernstein libretto jus
tice it is Gwen Eagleton.
Susie Cashion's choreography
as well is able to equal the high
expectations one has of "West
Side Story." Any production of
this play would be a disaster
without the vital energy of good
dancing, and Cashion takes care
to see that this one doesn't
shoulder such misfortunte. Pam
Spira and James Sakamoto as
Maria and Tony in the Dream

Sequence grace the Ram's Head
production with an elegance and
expertise above and beyond the
call of a student production.
The women, in general, were
more consistently good than the
men. Mary Tanner as Anita ex
hibits^'the most successful fusion
of the
talents necessary to the show.
Tanner's performance of
"America," supported by
Audrey Levine as Rosalia and
the rest of the Shark Girls, is
certainly one of the most pro
fessional of the production.
However, nobody can beat the
Jets in "Gee, Officer Krupke,"
one of the show's popular songs.
It is hard to miss with this one,
especially with Alan Crystal
(Action) and Todd Harris (Baby
John) and the rest of the Jets
hamming it up to the hilt.
Randy Smith's bare and
geometric set design coupled
with Mark Swanson's musical
direction formed a firm and
much needed backdrop to the
show's dramatics.
Overall, the cast should be
commended for an ambitious
and, for the most part, suc
cessful production. The love
scenes are weak and could have
used a more intimate staging,
but the show possesses an over
arching integrity which, to a
great extent, is able to mask its
misses.
