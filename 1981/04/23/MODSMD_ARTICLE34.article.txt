Israel protests arms sales
!' Jerusalem— Israel declared "unreserved op
position" yesterday to President Ronald Rea
gan's plans to press ahead with the sale of sur
veillance aircraft and offensive weaponry to
(Saudi Arabia. The Israelis warned that it will un
dermine peace in the Middle East and threaten
the security of Israel.
In the strongest statement yet on the planned
sale, Prime Minister Menachem Begin's office
voiced "profound regret" at the White House de
cision, saying that it will create a "grave danger"
to Israel in the future. Begin repeated the warning
in a meeting in his office with the U.S. am
bassador to Israel, Samuel Lewis.
Israeli Foreign Ministry officials said that
"friends in the United States" would be expected
to take into account the prime minister's
statement, and that "we will do whatever we can
to stop the sale."
The statements are interpreted as a signal to
the organized American Jewish lobby to wage an
intensive fight in Congress against the proposed
sale of the radar reconnaissance planes. Reagan's
decision could be blocked only by majority votes
in both the House and Senate within 30 days after
formal notification by the administration that it
intends to go through with the deal.
