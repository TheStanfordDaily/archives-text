The Santa Clara County Sher

Road Tuesday night as Horace
McNair, 45, a San Francisco
taxi driver and brother of singer
Barbara McNair.
McNair was killed by a shot
gun fired at his head at close
range.
Residents nearby told police
they had heard what they
thought was a car backfire and
heard a car leave the area. A
resident returning home dis
covered the body in the street
and called Stanford police at
about 10:30 p.m.
The murder "appears to have
no connection with the Univer
sity," said Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
"We don't know what he was
doing at Stanf6rd," said Sgt. A 1
Ondi of the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's office, "we're totally
stumped."
"This is a residential neigh
borhood — it's the wrong place

for things like this to happen.
Why would his killer shoot him
in the middle of the street when
he could have hidden him . . .
where we wouldn't find the body
for months," said Ondi.
McNair had an extensive rec
ord of narcotics violations both
in this area and in Las Vegas,
Nevada.
