# University looking ahead to 'Context' system

"Anyone who enjoys language will
find a kind of magic in it. " — Assistant
Professor Douglas Hofstadter, computer
science, here on leave from the Univer
sity of Indiana
"It doubles my academic life. " — Pro
fessor Alphonse Juilland, French
"It changes my temporal relationship
to the text." — Historian Michael
Carter
"It" is Context, a computer text sys
tem for written communication which
will be made available to Stanford's aca
demic community this June. Context will
provide key services for all aspects of
creative writing: reading, revising, fil
ing, retrieving, printing and distributing
the text.
Using the system is similar to using a
typewriter, only the text appears on a
screen in front of the writer. Deletions,
insertions, or revisions can be done easi
ly, without having to retype the entire
text. Thus, editing of manuscripts can be
done much faster.
Besides keyboards and display screens
(terminals), the system includes proc
essors, memory, and communications
networks which people can use to make
their own text available to others.
The ease with which changes can be
made is the key to the system's signifi
cance. When trying to describe the Con
text system, both Carter and Jon Sand
elin, director of the Center for Informa

tion Technolgy (CIT) Text Network Pro
gram, used the word "fluid."
One can "paint, create a document,
one can get it just the way you want
it,"said Sandelin.
"Because changes are always pos
sible, I feel as if I'm in closer touch with
my literary product. Typing is only
slightly more sophisticated than etching
it in stone. Its inflexibility increases the
writer's distance,"said Carter.
Carter said that as a historian, he ex
perienced an especially important
phenomenon when working on the Con
text system: "I have a different rela
tionship to my text. It's more like sitting
in a desk surrounded by the text. I'm able
to move to any point in the text; I'm
equidistant from any point in the book
and thus in history. The temporal rela
tionship between events is broken
down."
Juilland complained that humanities
professors don't have the research assis
tants and secretaries that are available
in the medical school and the sciences
and one ends up spending more time
doing "kitchen work" than original
thinking. But the text-editing system,
he said, enables him to reverse this ratio.
"It gives me longevity. This machine
doubles my scholarly life."
Hofstadter, the Pulitzer-Prize win
ning author of Ciodel, Escher, Bach: an
Eternal Golden Braid, said that the

ablility to rewrite even the simplest
things actually changed his writing
style. He said that the system allowed
him to say exactly what he wanted and
that because of the system he felt "right
there with his text." "Anyone who uses
writing creatively can benefit from it,"
he added
Only a handful of professors and grad
uate students have used the text-editing
system so far. They have been allowed to
use a computer system at the Institute
for Mathematical Studies of the Social
Sciences (IMSSS) which is used primari
ly for research. The text-editing system
evolved as a byproduct of the Institute's
main work.
Plans for the purchase of a computer
system similar to the one in use at the
IMSSS were approved in March. The
main unit has already arrived, and the
terminals will arrive in June.
One third of the computing capacity of
the system will be allocated for student
use in two modes with different
capabilities and at different prices. The
rest of the system will be allocated for
faculty use — through either rental or
purchase. Sandelin said he envisages
many of the professsors working out of
their own homes as well as in their de
partment offices.
Right now there are 10 terminals at the
Center for Educational Research at
Stanford (CERAS) which are only being

used at night, and so as part of the pilot
project, they will be hooked up to the
Context unit during the day. These termi
nals will be available to students around
the second week of May for about $1 per
hour, including use of the printer and
help from computer consultants. Student
demand for these services will de
termine the number of terminals in each
mode which will be available in the fall.
"A lot of things won't be known until
we actually start supporting services,"
Sandelin said. "It's never been done
before. Stanford is in contact with other
universities through seminars which we
have given. No one else is currently plan
ning to do this, but many others may
choose to adopt this approach," he
added.
Sandelin also said that the com
munication facilitation which is possible
because of the computer system is as im
portant as the actual writing support.
"Because of the capability of instan
taneously informing several people, one
is able to keep in direct contact, without
requiring an immediate response."
He remarked that the system
diminishes miscommunication while
potentially allowing contact with
thousands of people across the country.
Both he and Carter spoke of the system
as possibly "replacing the telephone"
and as a means of "increasing literacy
and improving writing ability."

Using the system is similar to using a
typewriter, only the text appears on a
screen in front of the writer. Deletions,
insertions, or revisions can be done easi
ly, without having to retype the entire
text. Thus, editing of manuscripts can be
done much faster.
Besides keyboards and display screens
(terminals), the system includes proc
essors, memory, and communications
networks which people can use to make
their own text available to others.
The ease with which changes can be
made is the key to the system's signifi
cance. When trying to describe the Con
text system, both Carter and Jon Sand
elin, director of the Center for Informa

tion Technolgy (CIT) Text Network Pro
gram, used the word "fluid."
One can "paint, create a document,
one can get it just the way you want
it,"said Sandelin.
"Because changes are always pos
sible, I feel as if I'm in closer touch with
my literary product. Typing is only
slightly more sophisticated than etching
it in stone. Its inflexibility increases the
writer's distance,"said Carter.
Carter said that as a historian, he ex
perienced an especially important
phenomenon when working on the Con
text system: "I have a different rela
tionship to my text. It's more like sitting
in a desk surrounded by the text. I'm able
to move to any point in the text; I'm
equidistant from any point in the book
and thus in history. The temporal rela
tionship between events is broken
down."
Juilland complained that humanities
professors don't have the research assis
tants and secretaries that are available
in the medical school and the sciences
and one ends up spending more time
doing "kitchen work" than original
thinking. But the text-editing system,
he said, enables him to reverse this ratio.
"It gives me longevity. This machine
doubles my scholarly life."
Hofstadter, the Pulitzer-Prize win
ning author of Ciodel, Escher, Bach: an
Eternal Golden Braid, said that the

ablility to rewrite even the simplest
things actually changed his writing
style. He said that the system allowed
him to say exactly what he wanted and
that because of the system he felt "right
there with his text." "Anyone who uses
writing creatively can benefit from it,"
he added
Only a handful of professors and grad
uate students have used the text-editing
system so far. They have been allowed to
use a computer system at the Institute
for Mathematical Studies of the Social
Sciences (IMSSS) which is used primari
ly for research. The text-editing system
evolved as a byproduct of the Institute's
main work.
Plans for the purchase of a computer
system similar to the one in use at the
IMSSS were approved in March. The
main unit has already arrived, and the
terminals will arrive in June.
One third of the computing capacity of
the system will be allocated for student
use in two modes with different
capabilities and at different prices. The
rest of the system will be allocated for
faculty use — through either rental or
purchase. Sandelin said he envisages
many of the professsors working out of
their own homes as well as in their de
partment offices.
Right now there are 10 terminals at the
Center for Educational Research at
Stanford (CERAS) which are only being

used at night, and so as part of the pilot
project, they will be hooked up to the
Context unit during the day. These termi
nals will be available to students around
the second week of May for about $1 per
hour, including use of the printer and
help from computer consultants. Student
demand for these services will de
termine the number of terminals in each
mode which will be available in the fall.
"A lot of things won't be known until
we actually start supporting services,"
Sandelin said. "It's never been done
before. Stanford is in contact with other
universities through seminars which we
have given. No one else is currently plan
ning to do this, but many others may
choose to adopt this approach," he
added.
Sandelin also said that the com
munication facilitation which is possible
because of the computer system is as im
portant as the actual writing support.
"Because of the capability of instan
taneously informing several people, one
is able to keep in direct contact, without
requiring an immediate response."
He remarked that the system
diminishes miscommunication while
potentially allowing contact with
thousands of people across the country.
Both he and Carter spoke of the system
as possibly "replacing the telephone"
and as a means of "increasing literacy
and improving writing ability."
