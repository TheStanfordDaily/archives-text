## 
### Karen Springen 
With only two weeks left
before clericals here vote on
whether to unionize, the Office
IStaff Organizing Committee
fOSOC) held a noon rally at Old
Union courtyard yesterday.
About 200 people turned out
for the event, which included a
skit, two speeches, and wine,
music and balloons.
Gahaida Firestone, a library
specialist at Green Library and
one of the speakers at the rally,
said "We (office workers) are
disenfranchised, unfortunately,
in a center of enlightenment."
Firestone, who has worked at
the University almost 14 years,
blasted University man
agement, asserting that there is
a "two-class citizenship at this
University."
She also mentioned the dis
tribution of bulletins by the ad
ministratfon. "We are not
scared," she emphasized.
The University has dis
tributed election bulletins and a
four-page letter to all clericals.
Owen called the bulletin in
formation misleading. "They
make it seem like a hostile en
terprise," she said
Terry Owen, a staff organizer
and a part-time secretary at the
Med Center, was the second
speaker She cited the need for a
union to provide a legal mecha
nism to negotiate with the Uni
versity.
"We are on the march here at
Stanford and we have been on
the march for two years," she
cried OSOC has held weekly
meetings since it began 18
months ago.
She referred to OSOC's effort
as a continuation of the 1903
Mother Jones march of the mill
children in Pennsylvania,
where Mother Jones led a large
contingent of working children
on a march to demonstrate the
need for improved working con
ditions.
Owen particularly em
phasized lack of support from
the administration. "Stanford
University thinks we are hostile
and tense," she said.

President Donald Kennedy
has written two statements pub
lished in Campus Report and
the Daily. Owen said his action
was unnecessary. "There's no
doubt about the adminis
tration's position," she said.
Owen further urged workers
to "vote yes on the continuation
of all the work that's been done
in the past." For example, she
said, it has only been illegal to
pay men more than women
since 1973,
She labeled clerical organiz
ing "the wave of the future."
"We cannot perceive that we
will lose on May 7," she con
cluded.
Almost 1800 are eligible to
vote in the upcoming election.
Office workers are demand
ing decent raises, adequate
grievance procedures, im
proved safety, and a revamping
of the classification system.
The union would give OSOC a
legal voice, according to or
ganizers of the campaign For
example, grievance procedures
presently are not binding
Betsy Murphy, a staff or
ganizer, cited a common com
plaint — the "patronizing at
titude" of the University. "I
don't think Kennedy is for any
union," she said
Jill Coelho of Green Library
said, "I feel very fond of this
University and I want to partici
pate at a higher level." She
added, "You need economic
power before your voice is
heard "
Folk singer Robert Gold
sborough opened the program
after being introduced by OSOC
chairman Joyce Tipps-Coats
His rallying lyrics included
"solidarity forever."
Singers later asked the crowd
to join in with lyrics such as,
"You can't scare me, I'm stick
ing to the union," and"the
working girl blues." The au
dience laughed at a song mim
icking a boss. "Whoever do they
think they are to organize like
men''" and "I'll damn well see
her fired if I can find the form"

drew widespread applause.
OSOC also sold red and white
t-shirts at the rally. Shirts ask,
"Who runs Stanford?" and an
swer, "Wedo!"
The NLRB will supervise the
May 7 election. Votes will be
counted and announced that
night. A simple majority is all
that is needed to pass the union.
The clericals here would form a
branch of USE local 715. The ex
isting unit of USE has 1400 mem
bers.

With only two weeks left
before clericals here vote on
whether to unionize, the Office
IStaff Organizing Committee
fOSOC) held a noon rally at Old
Union courtyard yesterday.
About 200 people turned out
for the event, which included a
skit, two speeches, and wine,
music and balloons.
Gahaida Firestone, a library
specialist at Green Library and
one of the speakers at the rally,
said "We (office workers) are
disenfranchised, unfortunately,
in a center of enlightenment."
Firestone, who has worked at
the University almost 14 years,
blasted University man
agement, asserting that there is
a "two-class citizenship at this
University."
She also mentioned the dis
tribution of bulletins by the ad
ministratfon. "We are not
scared," she emphasized.
The University has dis
tributed election bulletins and a
four-page letter to all clericals.
Owen called the bulletin in
formation misleading. "They
make it seem like a hostile en
terprise," she said
Terry Owen, a staff organizer
and a part-time secretary at the
Med Center, was the second
speaker She cited the need for a
union to provide a legal mecha
nism to negotiate with the Uni
versity.
"We are on the march here at
Stanford and we have been on
the march for two years," she
cried OSOC has held weekly
meetings since it began 18
months ago.
She referred to OSOC's effort
as a continuation of the 1903
Mother Jones march of the mill
children in Pennsylvania,
where Mother Jones led a large
contingent of working children
on a march to demonstrate the
need for improved working con
ditions.
Owen particularly em
phasized lack of support from
the administration. "Stanford
University thinks we are hostile
and tense," she said.

President Donald Kennedy
has written two statements pub
lished in Campus Report and
the Daily. Owen said his action
was unnecessary. "There's no
doubt about the adminis
tration's position," she said.
Owen further urged workers
to "vote yes on the continuation
of all the work that's been done
in the past." For example, she
said, it has only been illegal to
pay men more than women
since 1973,
She labeled clerical organiz
ing "the wave of the future."
"We cannot perceive that we
will lose on May 7," she con
cluded.
Almost 1800 are eligible to
vote in the upcoming election.
Office workers are demand
ing decent raises, adequate
grievance procedures, im
proved safety, and a revamping
of the classification system.
The union would give OSOC a
legal voice, according to or
ganizers of the campaign For
example, grievance procedures
presently are not binding
Betsy Murphy, a staff or
ganizer, cited a common com
plaint — the "patronizing at
titude" of the University. "I
don't think Kennedy is for any
union," she said
Jill Coelho of Green Library
said, "I feel very fond of this
University and I want to partici
pate at a higher level." She
added, "You need economic
power before your voice is
heard "
Folk singer Robert Gold
sborough opened the program
after being introduced by OSOC
chairman Joyce Tipps-Coats
His rallying lyrics included
"solidarity forever."
Singers later asked the crowd
to join in with lyrics such as,
"You can't scare me, I'm stick
ing to the union," and"the
working girl blues." The au
dience laughed at a song mim
icking a boss. "Whoever do they
think they are to organize like
men''" and "I'll damn well see
her fired if I can find the form"

drew widespread applause.
OSOC also sold red and white
t-shirts at the rally. Shirts ask,
"Who runs Stanford?" and an
swer, "Wedo!"
The NLRB will supervise the
May 7 election. Votes will be
counted and announced that
night. A simple majority is all
that is needed to pass the union.
The clericals here would form a
branch of USE local 715. The ex
