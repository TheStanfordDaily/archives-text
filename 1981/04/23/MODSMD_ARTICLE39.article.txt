# ASSU Senate nixes special fee election
## 
### Richard Klingler 
Pass/Fail option deadline to the
third week of the quarter, cen
tralizing administration of the
process for dropping courses,
and recording failing grades
and withdrawals from classes
after a specified deadline, ac
cording to Senator Mike
O'Reilly.
O'Reilly is a member of the
Student Affairs Committee,
whose successful resolution
asks th2 Faculty Senate and C
AAA to publicize widely any
proposed changes and provide
the opportunity for students to
express their concerns.
O'Reilly said he fears that pro
posed changes would penalize
students with weaker educa
tional backgrounds without ad
dressing the issue of grade infla
tion.
The senate also recom
mended to the Presidential
Search Committee (to resolve
the mascot controversy) that
the official Stanford mascot re
main the color cardinal. Senator
Jeff Bradach said the proposal

"recognizes the status quo" and
provides the search committee
with an expression of student
opinion.
According to Bradach, the
Student Affairs Committee ad
dressed the mascot issue in this
manner because the students
hold no consensus of what the
mascot should be and because
no mascot campaign received
general support.
With little opposition, the sen
ate accepted the Finance Com
mittee's recommendations to
eliminate the ASSU Typing Ser
vice and the ASSU Consumer
Affairs Bureau (CAB). The typ
ing service will be replaced by a
bulletin board on which typists
can advertise their services.
The typing service declared a
loss of $636.86 (including $65 of
stolen funds) in its Fall 1980 In
come Statement. Senator Dave
Phelps, a member of the Fi
nance Committee, said,
"basically, what the board (the
CAB) has done is nothing."
The ASSU Senate last night
refused to hold a special elec
tion to reconsider fee
assessments that failed to gain
votes of 20 percent of the student
body and authorized a forum to
discuss proposed changes in the
grading system.
During the sparsely attended
meeting, the senate accepted
Chair Doug Mitchell's Monday
interpretation of the ASSU Con
stitution that no organization's
identical fee assessment re
quest could be considered twice
in a given quarter.
Eight of the original 17 fee
assessment proposals received
a favorable majority of those
students voting on the proposal,
but failed to attain 20 percent of
the vote of the student body.
Last night's senate action de
nies those groups — including
five ASSU organizations that de
pend upon assessments for the
bulk of their support — funding
in a special election but makes
no provisions for alternate fund
ing.
Senator Dave Daleke outlined
two ways for those organiza
tions to receive funding through
a fee assessment: by partici
pating in a special spring elec
tion by requesting a different
amount of money, or by request
ing a fee assessment in next
fall's election. Referring to the
groups denied funding, Mitchell
said there "probably will be an
election in the fall."
Several senators challenged
Mitchell's authority to interpret
the ASSU Constitution and
claimed that only the full senate
could take such action, but Sen

ator Dave Mandelkern's suc
cessful motion to accept
Mitchell's interpretation gave
senate endorsement to the re
jection of the special election.
Council of Presidents (COP)
member Marc Ventresca em
phasized that the senate action
left large organizations without
a great proportion of their fund
ing and said, "we need to do
something to find any way pos
sible to help these groups."
Mitchell agreed: "Our work
starts now."
The senate action leaves five
ASSU services — Legal Coun
seling Service, the Boathouse,
Academic Organization Board
(AOB), the Publications Board,
and the Program Fee — without
funding at least for fall quarter.
Financial Manager Steve Davis
said the Legal Service,
Boathouse, and Publications
Board have money to weather
delayed funding but said the
AOB and Program Fee, which
together provide money to more
than 50 student organizations,
depend upon the assessments
that they were denied this quar
ter.
The senate also responded to
proposed changes in the grading
system by authorizing "a forum
at which the student body may
hear the proposals of the C-AAA
(the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement,
which is considering grade sys
tem changes) and respond to
them" and by asking the Facul
ty Senate and C-AAA to consider
student opinion in new policy
formation.
On May 28, the Faculty Sen
ate will consider moving the
Pass/Fail option deadline to the
third week of the quarter, cen
tralizing administration of the
process for dropping courses,
and recording failing grades
and withdrawals from classes

hear the proposals of the C-AAA
(the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement,
which is considering grade sys
tem changes) and respond to
them" and by asking the Facul
ty Senate and C-AAA to consider
student opinion in new policy
formation.
On May 28, the Faculty Sen
ate will consider moving the
Pass/Fail option deadline to the
third week of the quarter, cen
tralizing administration of the
process for dropping courses,
and recording failing grades
and withdrawals from classes
after a specified deadline, ac
cording to Senator Mike
O'Reilly.
O'Reilly is a member of the
Student Affairs Committee,
whose successful resolution
asks th2 Faculty Senate and C
AAA to publicize widely any
proposed changes and provide
the opportunity for students to
express their concerns.
O'Reilly said he fears that pro
posed changes would penalize
students with weaker educa
tional backgrounds without ad
dressing the issue of grade infla
tion.
The senate also recom
mended to the Presidential
Search Committee (to resolve
the mascot controversy) that
the official Stanford mascot re
main the color cardinal. Senator
Jeff Bradach said the proposal

"recognizes the status quo" and
provides the search committee
with an expression of student
opinion.
According to Bradach, the
Student Affairs Committee ad
dressed the mascot issue in this
manner because the students
hold no consensus of what the
mascot should be and because
no mascot campaign received
general support.
With little opposition, the sen
ate accepted the Finance Com
mittee's recommendations to
eliminate the ASSU Typing Ser
vice and the ASSU Consumer
Affairs Bureau (CAB). The typ
ing service will be replaced by a
bulletin board on which typists
can advertise their services.
The typing service declared a
loss of $636.86 (including $65 of
stolen funds) in its Fall 1980 In
come Statement. Senator Dave
Phelps, a member of the Fi
nance Committee, said,
"basically, what the board (the
CAB) has done is nothing."
The ASSU Senate last night
refused to hold a special elec
tion to reconsider fee
assessments that failed to gain
votes of 20 percent of the student
body and authorized a forum to
discuss proposed changes in the
grading system.
During the sparsely attended
meeting, the senate accepted
Chair Doug Mitchell's Monday
interpretation of the ASSU Con
stitution that no organization's
identical fee assessment re
quest could be considered twice
in a given quarter.
Eight of the original 17 fee
assessment proposals received
a favorable majority of those
students voting on the proposal,
but failed to attain 20 percent of
the vote of the student body.
Last night's senate action de
nies those groups — including
five ASSU organizations that de
pend upon assessments for the
bulk of their support — funding
in a special election but makes
no provisions for alternate fund
ing.
Senator Dave Daleke outlined
two ways for those organiza
tions to receive funding through
a fee assessment: by partici
pating in a special spring elec
tion by requesting a different
amount of money, or by request
ing a fee assessment in next
fall's election. Referring to the
groups denied funding, Mitchell
said there "probably will be an
election in the fall."
Several senators challenged
Mitchell's authority to interpret
the ASSU Constitution and
claimed that only the full senate
could take such action, but Sen

ator Dave Mandelkern's suc
cessful motion to accept
Mitchell's interpretation gave
senate endorsement to the re
jection of the special election.
Council of Presidents (COP)
member Marc Ventresca em
phasized that the senate action
left large organizations without
a great proportion of their fund
ing and said, "we need to do
something to find any way pos
sible to help these groups."
Mitchell agreed: "Our work
starts now."
The senate action leaves five
ASSU services — Legal Coun
seling Service, the Boathouse,
Academic Organization Board
(AOB), the Publications Board,
and the Program Fee — without
funding at least for fall quarter.
Financial Manager Steve Davis
said the Legal Service,
Boathouse, and Publications
Board have money to weather
delayed funding but said the
AOB and Program Fee, which
together provide money to more
than 50 student organizations,
depend upon the assessments
that they were denied this quar
ter.
