# ASSU Senate nixes special fee election

### Richard Klingler 
Pass/Fail option deadline to the
third week of the quarter, cen
tralizing administration of the
process for dropping courses,
and recording failing grades
and withdrawals from classes
after a specified deadline, ac
cording to Senator Mike
O'Reilly.
O'Reilly is a member of the
Student Affairs Committee,
whose successful resolution
asks th2 Faculty Senate and C
AAA to publicize widely any
proposed changes and provide
the opportunity for students to
express their concerns.
O'Reilly said he fears that pro
posed changes would penalize
students with weaker educa
tional backgrounds without ad
dressing the issue of grade infla
tion.
The senate also recom
mended to the Presidential
Search Committee (to resolve
the mascot controversy) that
the official Stanford mascot re
main the color cardinal. Senator
Jeff Bradach said the proposal

"recognizes the status quo" and
provides the search committee
with an expression of student
opinion.
According to Bradach, the
Student Affairs Committee ad
dressed the mascot issue in this
manner because the students
hold no consensus of what the
mascot should be and because
no mascot campaign received
general support.
With little opposition, the sen
ate accepted the Finance Com
mittee's recommendations to
eliminate the ASSU Typing Ser
vice and the ASSU Consumer
Affairs Bureau (CAB). The typ
ing service will be replaced by a
bulletin board on which typists
can advertise their services.
The typing service declared a
loss of $636.86 (including $65 of
stolen funds) in its Fall 1980 In
come Statement. Senator Dave
Phelps, a member of the Fi
nance Committee, said,
"basically, what the board (the
CAB) has done is nothing."
