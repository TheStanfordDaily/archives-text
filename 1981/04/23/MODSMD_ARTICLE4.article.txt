# Tense atmosphere surrounds union issue
## Union-University friction intensifies as election nears 
### Jan Mireles 
Tensions are mounting be
tween University officials
and clerical workers as
the University and the Office
Staff Organizing Committee
step up their pre-election cam
paigns. The clericals will make
their final decision May 7.
The University this week re
leased the fifth and sixth in its
series of election bulletins,
these last two entitled "The
Union and Individual Rights,"
and "Grievance Procedures."
The grievance bulletin com
pares the grievance procedure
of United Stanford Employees
to that available to clerical
workers now without

unionization, and claims that
the University's procedure is
both faster and more beneficial
to employees than that of USE.
The individual rights bulletin
stresses the role of the union as
a bargaining unit, and asserts
that "individual recognition
would be secondary to union in
terests." It also claims that
unions are "very difficult to for
employees to remove . . . once
it has been elected," and notes
that the new USE by-laws of
provide for disciplinary action
against employees who try to
decertify the union.
If the proposal passes, Local
715 of the Service Employees In
ternational Union, representing
United Stanford Employees

(USE), will be the official
bargaining agent representing
the clerical staff in negotiations
with the University.
Both organizers and adminis
tration admit that a strained at
mosphere exists, but neither
will admit creating the tension.
In a letter dated Jan. 27, Pres
ident Donald Kennedy urged
staff members to forego
unionization, saying that though
problems of classification and
wage scales exist, they would,
"ultimately . . . deal with these
issues."
An attorney representing the
University, Priscilla Wheeler,
accused the union of having a
"confrontational approach"
which makes problem solving

difficult; while an office staff
organizer blasted the Univer
sity for "attempts to squash"
the election by campaigning
against it. Joyce Tipps-Coats,
who chairs the Office Staff Or
ganizing Committee (OSOC),
defended the clericals' move to
unionize.
"What we're doing is not
against the University. We're
working to protect our own in
terests," Tipps-Coats said.
The move to organize began
in June 1979, when mem
bers of a women's group
at SLAC decided to conduct a
pay scale survey and found that
they received only a 5.5 percent
pay raise between 1976 and 1979,
while technicians received a 19
percent raise.
Disturbed by this informa

tion, the workers prepared a
grievance statement and pre
sented their case to SLAC man
agement. The management in
formed the workers that there
was nothing they could do be
cause SLAC salaries are de
termined by the University
scale. Feeling they had little
other recourse, Tipps-Coats
said the group joined other cam
pus office workers intent on or
ganizing and decided to work
toward unionization. TTiey held
their first public meeting as
OSOC on Aug. 1, 1979. About 300
office women met in a room de
signed to hold 150.
During the 18 months that fol
lowed, OSOC has published
newsletters, held many lunch
eons, office meetings, and cof
fee hours to gain support for
