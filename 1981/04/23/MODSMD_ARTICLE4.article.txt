# Tense atmosphere surrounds union issue
## Union-University friction intensifies as election nears 
### Jan Mireles 
Tensions are mounting be
tween University officials
and clerical workers as
the University and the Office
Staff Organizing Committee
step up their pre-election cam
paigns. The clericals will make
their final decision May 7.
The University this week re
leased the fifth and sixth in its
series of election bulletins,
these last two entitled "The
Union and Individual Rights,"
and "Grievance Procedures."
The grievance bulletin com
pares the grievance procedure
of United Stanford Employees
to that available to clerical
workers now without

unionization, and claims that
the University's procedure is
both faster and more beneficial
to employees than that of USE.
The individual rights bulletin
stresses the role of the union as
a bargaining unit, and asserts
that "individual recognition
would be secondary to union in
terests." It also claims that
unions are "very difficult to for
employees to remove . . . once
it has been elected," and notes
that the new USE by-laws of
provide for disciplinary action
against employees who try to
decertify the union.
If the proposal passes, Local
715 of the Service Employees In
ternational Union, representing
United Stanford Employees

(USE), will be the official
bargaining agent representing
the clerical staff in negotiations
with the University.
Both organizers and adminis
tration admit that a strained at
mosphere exists, but neither
will admit creating the tension.
In a letter dated Jan. 27, Pres
ident Donald Kennedy urged
staff members to forego
unionization, saying that though
problems of classification and
wage scales exist, they would,
"ultimately . . . deal with these
issues."
An attorney representing the
University, Priscilla Wheeler,
accused the union of having a
"confrontational approach"
which makes problem solving

difficult; while an office staff
organizer blasted the Univer
sity for "attempts to squash"
the election by campaigning
against it. Joyce Tipps-Coats,
who chairs the Office Staff Or
ganizing Committee (OSOC),
defended the clericals' move to
unionize.
"What we're doing is not
against the University. We're
working to protect our own in
terests," Tipps-Coats said.
The move to organize began
in June 1979, when mem
bers of a women's group
at SLAC decided to conduct a
pay scale survey and found that
they received only a 5.5 percent
pay raise between 1976 and 1979,
while technicians received a 19
percent raise.
Disturbed by this informa

tion, the workers prepared a
grievance statement and pre
sented their case to SLAC man
agement. The management in
formed the workers that there
was nothing they could do be
cause SLAC salaries are de
termined by the University
scale. Feeling they had little
other recourse, Tipps-Coats
said the group joined other cam
pus office workers intent on or
ganizing and decided to work
toward unionization. TTiey held
their first public meeting as
OSOC on Aug. 1, 1979. About 300
office women met in a room de
signed to hold 150.
During the 18 months that fol
lowed, OSOC has published
newsletters, held many lunch
eons, office meetings, and cof
fee hours to gain support for
unionization.
In order to form a bargaining
unit, which could legally repre
sent workers to management,
OSOC had to gather support
from 30 percent of the office and
library support staff. On Oct. 16,
1980, OSOC announced that they
had enough signatures to func
tion legally as a bargaining unit.
A month later the University
refused to recognize OSOC, de
spite the fact that the group had
gathered 1000 signatures from
the 2000 workers who would be
represented by the unit. On Nov.
14, OSOC filed a petition with
the National Labor Relations
Board to join USE/Local 715,
which currently represents 1400
technical, maintenance and ser
vice employees at Stanford.
Employment Manager Linda
Haines said that the decision to
unionize developed for a variety
of reasons.
"There is a nationally in
creased awareness of
unionization; people are looking
at pay, treatment and promo
tional aspects. In some ways,"
added Haines, "Stanford is no
different from a big employer.
Workers feel they don't get indi
vidual attention."

Many workers agree with this
view, saying they want more at
tention and a larger role in the
decisions that affect them. Jim
Coleman, assistant to the Aca
demic Standing Supervisor
added that there is a need for
"greater responsibility, job au
tonomy, and partial worker con
trol of work environment.
"People who have to carry
out the decision should be con
sulted at some level," said Cole
man.
Some office staff members
are quick to discount the
pay levels as primary fac
tors for unionization. Secretary
Kathy Klindt and office assis
tant Rachel Hazard emphasize
the opportunity for a united
voice.
"It's not monetary," said
Klindt, "a union will give us a
voice that we haven't had to
date."
Hazard echoed Klindt, "I
want to have a say in my future.
A union will give us a sense of
unity."
OSOC hopes that as a union
they will be better able to work
toward making adjustments in
the existing system to allow for
fair compensation, more de
fined classification of job skills,
a grievance procedure that per
mits outside arbitration and
traditional improvements in
benefits such as health and safe
ty plans.
In the previous election bulle
tins issued by Vice President
and Provost Albert Hastorf and
Vice President for Business and
Finance, William Massey, the
University warns against
unionization.
According to a University
Election Bulletin, "Your say, or
lack of it, in collective bargain
ing is totally dependent on the
union's internal rules and pro
cedures. The law gives a union
broad discretion in deciding
what's best for you."
Erector of Personnel Robert

Parker, in explaining the bullet
in's validity, stressed the Uni
versity's wish to inform em
ployees about all the aspects of
a union so they can "hear both
sides of the story.
"It troubles us that people
might be fooled into thinking the
union can fulfill all their needs.
The facts simply don't bear that
out," said Parker.
Haines said that she believes
"a lot of people are reacting to
union promises."
Union supporters how
ever, turn that argument
around. Terri Owen, a
Clinical Service Representative
at the Medical Center and part
time organizer, said she is
pleased that "people are not
being fooled by the election bul

letins."
Owen also denied Haines' ac
cusation that workers are re
sponding to promises.
"We are being cautious to the
extreme. We are simply stating
possibilities and ideas we have
for dealing with problems,"
said Owen.
Kennedy, however, ex
pressed doubt in Local 715's
ability to function successfully
as bargaining agents. In a Cam
pus Report letter to the editor
dated April 15 of this year, Ken
nedy denied that the adminis
tration has taken an anti-union
stance.
"I do not think all union are
undesirable, but I do think some
unions are undesirable in some
situations. It is on that basis

that 1 oppose USE Local 715 in
the election," Kennedy wrote.
Kennedy argued against the
union, saying that the attitude
and practices of Local 715 "have
been unusually negative and
counter-productive.
"The atmosphere that has re
sulted has often been tense and
hostile," Kennedy wrote, "a
circumstance not usually found
when unions are truly effective
in gaining recognition and bene
fits for their members."
Though Kennedy pledged con
tinued opposition to
unionization by Local 715, he
said that if Stanford's workers
select the union as a bargaining
agent the administration will
"bargain with it in good faith."
