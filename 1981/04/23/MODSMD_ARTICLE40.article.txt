# Prisoners taught to meditate
## 
### Richard Salas 
Twice daily, more than 100 inmates of a
maximum security prison sit together peace
fully with members of the prison staff, all with
their eyes closed, practicing the art of tran
scendental meditation (TM).
A unique program which trains prisoners in
TM has been active since 1975 at Folsom Pris
on in Northern California, and has spread to
other prisons across the state. George Ellis, di
rector of the prison TM program, said in a
speech here Tuesday night that such programs
have had wide success.
As part of the presentation, Ellis showed the
film The Transcendental Meditation Program
in the Criminal Justice System. A series of in
terviews in the film explained how the TM pro
gram had benefitted such prisons as Folsom
and San Quentin. The film also showed cases in
which TM was used as an alternative probation
measure for people who would otherwise have
been sentenced to prison.
According to Ellis, Folsom prison was an es
pecially good location to begin the TM pro
gram because Folsom was known as one of the
toughest prisons in the state. Poor conditions
pervaded the prison, said Ellis, and inmates
were likely to build up stress because of the vi
olent atmosphere
Ellis began the program at Folsom in 1975.
After initial lessons in TM, the program al
lowed for two 20 minute sessions per day when
the inmates would meditate.
Many of the prisoners, as well as the staff,
have mentioned the positive effects of the pro
gram In letters and interviews, they said they
noticed improvements in their personalities
and their work. They were able to relax more
and they said they felt less violent.
Ellis explained that he had originally been
teaching philosophy to the inmates at Folsom.
He said he had been saddened by the poor con-

ditions there.
"I was moved by the tremendous suffering,
the tremendous human waste," he said. "This
type of misery wasn't going to help society or
the prisoners."
Ellis got a chance to aid the prisoners by
means of the TM program. He first taught one
student the technique, but soon many other in
mates said they wanted to learn it.
The benefits of TM are not limited to the peo
ple who actually practice it, Ellis said. He re
ferred to the hypothesis that when a certain
percentage of the population meditates, there
is a positive effect on the total population.
TM is a good form of therapy to use on pris
oners because it helps to reduce the stress
which is inherent in the prison environment,
Ellis said. The prisoners relax to the point
where they feel safe and comfortable enough
to close their eyes and meditate while sur
rounded by members of opposing gangs.
The inmates who practice TM are less likely
to become repeat offenders, said Ellis, and this
would help to alleviate crowded prison condi
tions and save the state millions of dollars. He
also said he feels TM is a compassionate meth
od for treating criminals, as it restores their
sense of self worth.
Ellis said he hopes that eventually some sci
entific parameters can be used to determine
when a prisoner is ready to return to society.
For example, studies have shown that EEC
coherence (a measure of brain waves) is
raised by the TM technique, which means that
the individual becomes less violent.
"I think it's going to be a real good day when
they start to teach TM on a mass scale," he
said
Currently TM is being used in 29 prisons, El
lis said He has taught the TM technique at
female prisons and to juvenile offenders.
