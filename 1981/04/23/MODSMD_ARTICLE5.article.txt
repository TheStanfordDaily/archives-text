# Conflict over unionization not without precedent
## 
### Monika Guttman 
The upcoming election
which will decide whether
clerical workers here will
become a part of United Stan
ford Employees (USE) has
sparked a lot of interest in the
history of unions on campus. In
terms of the overall history of
the University, unions are a
fairly recent phenomenon.
USE is one of the few unions
on campus. Professors and
teaching staff do not belong to a
bargaining unit, although many
belong to unions which repre
sent their field (i.e., unions that
pertain to areas of expertise and
not occupations). The fire
fighters' union merged with
Palo Alto's 4V2 years ago; thus,
their interests are negotiated
through the city of Palo Alto.
The other major represent
ative organizations include
CRONA (Committee for Recog
nition" of Nursing Achieve
ments), which negotiates con
tracts for nurses at the Hospital
and Medical Center, the Stan
ford Police Officers Union, and
the Medical Center Main
tenance Engineers Union.
The first collective of Stan
ford employees, developed in
1965-67, was the Stanford Em
ployees Association (SEA). Al
though this group consisted
mostly of plant service employ
ees, it was considered the repre
sentative union of University
employees. According to
Rowland Finston, the first pres
ident of USE, this association
was "on the conservative side of
the union spectrum."
In 1968, the SEA voted to af
filiate with the California
School Employees Association
(CSEA), because poor atten
dance at most meetings in
dicated, in their opinion, that
Stanford could not support an in

dependent union. The CSEA did
not call itself a union, and had a
no-strike pledge in its constitu
tion, and this indicated to many
employees it was a weak and in
significant organization. Al
though SEA was involved in
some bargaining with the Uni
versity administration on such
issues as wage increases and
benefits, a few within the or
ganization felt that it was too le
nient towards the adminis
tration.
These views were
crystallized in 1969, with the ad
vent of student protests and the
question of University contracts
for defense research. At this
point, certain members of SEA
felt that campus employees
needed different representa
tion, "more representative of
the anti-war sentiments and less
involved with the adminis
tration."
When the CSEA criticized
a student sit-in at the
Electronic Research
Labs, some members protested
that the action had been taken
without the approval of the
membership. These members
were expelled from the CSEA,
and in September 1969 they
formed United Stanford Em
ployees.
Another group of workers
who were disillusioned by the
CSEA went to the Teamsters
Union and formed Local 856.
The Teamsters circulated peti
tions and filed for a National La
bor Relations Board election in
the winter of 1970. This election
was to cover workers in the
Plant Services department, to
taling about 90 workers.
But the NLRB was then ap
proached by the CSEA, which
proposed that a bargaining unit
be established to include all
blue-collar workers and techni
cians, bringing the potential

number of union members to
1500.
The hearing continued for
more than a year. Meanwhile,
USE started becoming actively
involved in labor disputes
within the University, including
a sit-in at the Stanford Hospital
to protest the firing of a laborer
there. USE continued to grow in
membership through March of
1972, when the NLRB handed
down its decision. The bargain
ing unit recommended by CSEA
was approved, and now it was up
to the potential membership to
vote on which union would rep
resent them.
In the March election, 63 per
cent of the eligible workers
voted, with the Teamsters get
ting 27 percent endorsement,
USE getting 21 percent of the
votes, and CSEA 15 percent.
None of these percentages was
high enough for the union to re
ceive representation rights. Ac
cording to NLRB rules, another

election could not be held for a
year.
In April 1973, USE voted over
whelmingly to affiliate with the
Service Employees Interna
tional Union (SEIU) of the AFL
CIO — while USE had still not
qualified as an official bargain
ing unit. At this point USE was
involved in another campaign to
be recognized as the official
union on campus, against anoth
er group sponsored by the Uni

versity called the Stanford Joint
Council. As part of the agree
ment, the SEIU provided USE
with $3000 for the campaign.
USE was finally voted in as
the official union in June 1973.
Of the 1400 members eligible to
vote, 660 voted for the union, 494
voted against 'the union, and 25
votes were unresolved. The
Teamsters and CSEA had
earlier dropped out of the com

petition.
The next problem confronting
the University and USE was to
negotiate a contract. Bargain
ing continued from October 1973
through May 1974. At stake were
disagreements between the
union and the University over
minimum wage bases, benefits,
and whether students who were
temporarily carrying out some

service or maintenance jobs
could be exempted from union
dues and requirements.
When no settlement had been
reached by May, 74 percent of
the union voted for a strike. On
May 14, 900 union members
struck their jobs.
The strike lasted for about
three weeks, as negotiations for
a new contract continued. On

May 17, Judge Homer Thomp
son of the superior court of Cali
fornia issued a temporary re
straining order to prohibit ob
struction of entry caused by
USE picketers, and on May 21 is
sued a second restraining order
in response to alleged van
dalism by members of USE.
The strike was ended in June
with a three-year contract.

terms of the overall history of
the University, unions are a
fairly recent phenomenon.
USE is one of the few unions
on campus. Professors and
teaching staff do not belong to a
bargaining unit, although many
belong to unions which repre
sent their field (i.e., unions that
pertain to areas of expertise and
not occupations). The fire
fighters' union merged with
Palo Alto's 4V2 years ago; thus,
their interests are negotiated
through the city of Palo Alto.
The other major represent
ative organizations include
CRONA (Committee for Recog
nition" of Nursing Achieve
ments), which negotiates con
tracts for nurses at the Hospital
and Medical Center, the Stan
ford Police Officers Union, and
the Medical Center Main
tenance Engineers Union.
The first collective of Stan
ford employees, developed in
1965-67, was the Stanford Em
ployees Association (SEA). Al
though this group consisted
mostly of plant service employ
ees, it was considered the repre
sentative union of University
employees. According to
Rowland Finston, the first pres
ident of USE, this association
was "on the conservative side of
the union spectrum."
In 1968, the SEA voted to af
filiate with the California
School Employees Association
(CSEA), because poor atten
dance at most meetings in
dicated, in their opinion, that
Stanford could not support an in

dependent union. The CSEA did
not call itself a union, and had a
no-strike pledge in its constitu
tion, and this indicated to many
employees it was a weak and in
significant organization. Al
though SEA was involved in
some bargaining with the Uni
versity administration on such
issues as wage increases and
benefits, a few within the or
ganization felt that it was too le
nient towards the adminis
tration.
These views were
crystallized in 1969, with the ad
vent of student protests and the
question of University contracts
for defense research. At this
point, certain members of SEA
felt that campus employees
needed different representa
tion, "more representative of
the anti-war sentiments and less
involved with the adminis
tration."
When the CSEA criticized
a student sit-in at the
Electronic Research
Labs, some members protested
that the action had been taken
without the approval of the
membership. These members
were expelled from the CSEA,
and in September 1969 they
formed United Stanford Em
ployees.
Another group of workers
who were disillusioned by the
CSEA went to the Teamsters
Union and formed Local 856.
The Teamsters circulated peti
tions and filed for a National La
bor Relations Board election in
the winter of 1970. This election
was to cover workers in the
Plant Services department, to
taling about 90 workers.
But the NLRB was then ap
proached by the CSEA, which
proposed that a bargaining unit
be established to include all
blue-collar workers and techni
cians, bringing the potential

number of union members to
1500.
The hearing continued for
more than a year. Meanwhile,
USE started becoming actively
involved in labor disputes
within the University, including
a sit-in at the Stanford Hospital
to protest the firing of a laborer
there. USE continued to grow in
membership through March of
1972, when the NLRB handed
down its decision. The bargain
ing unit recommended by CSEA
was approved, and now it was up
to the potential membership to
vote on which union would rep
resent them.
In the March election, 63 per
cent of the eligible workers
voted, with the Teamsters get
ting 27 percent endorsement,
USE getting 21 percent of the
votes, and CSEA 15 percent.
None of these percentages was
high enough for the union to re
ceive representation rights. Ac
cording to NLRB rules, another

election could not be held for a
year.
In April 1973, USE voted over
whelmingly to affiliate with the
Service Employees Interna
tional Union (SEIU) of the AFL
CIO — while USE had still not
qualified as an official bargain
ing unit. At this point USE was
involved in another campaign to
be recognized as the official
union on campus, against anoth
er group sponsored by the Uni

versity called the Stanford Joint
Council. As part of the agree
ment, the SEIU provided USE
with $3000 for the campaign.
USE was finally voted in as
the official union in June 1973.
Of the 1400 members eligible to
vote, 660 voted for the union, 494
voted against 'the union, and 25
votes were unresolved. The
Teamsters and CSEA had
earlier dropped out of the com

petition.
The next problem confronting
the University and USE was to
negotiate a contract. Bargain
ing continued from October 1973
through May 1974. At stake were
disagreements between the
union and the University over
minimum wage bases, benefits,
and whether students who were
temporarily carrying out some

service or maintenance jobs
could be exempted from union
dues and requirements.
When no settlement had been
reached by May, 74 percent of
the union voted for a strike. On
May 14, 900 union members
struck their jobs.
The strike lasted for about
three weeks, as negotiations for
a new contract continued. On

May 17, Judge Homer Thomp
son of the superior court of Cali
fornia issued a temporary re
straining order to prohibit ob
struction of entry caused by
USE picketers, and on May 21 is
sued a second restraining order
in response to alleged van
dalism by members of USE.
The strike was ended in June
with a three-year contract.
