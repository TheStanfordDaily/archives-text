More of Stanford's
clerical workers lean
toward voting against
unionization in the upcoming
election than toward voting for
it. according to a Daily poll con
ducted last week. However,
enough of those polled remain
undecided to swing the election
either way.
Forty-eight percent of those
interviewed in the survey of
clerical workers eligible to vote
in the upcoming election would
vote against unionization if the
election were held today,
whereas 37 percent would vote
for it and 15 percent are unsure
how thev would vote.

Cover Story

Most clericals plan to vote.
Ninety-four percent of those
polled said they would cast their
ballots while 3 percent said they
would not and 3 percent were
not sure
When asked about their feel
ings towards unionization, there
is a greater percentage of
clericals strongly opposed than
strongly in favor of having Unit
ed Stanford Employees (USE)
Local 715 as their bargaining
agent.
Clericals were asked to re
spond to the question, "How
would you describe your feel
ings about the prospect of a
clerical workers' union at Stan
ford?"
Strongly in favor... 23%
Moderately in favor 20%
Neither in favor
or opposed 10%
Moderately opposed 17%
Strongly opposed 30%
Overall, 43 percent of the

clericals at Stanford favor the
prospect of a union, while 47 per
cent oppose the idea and 10 per
cent have mixed feelings or no
opinion. Those who plan to vote
against unionization seem
slightly more committed in
their stance than those who sup
port unionization and plan to
vote for it.
In separate interviews with
several clericals, most ex
pressed dissatisfaction with
their jobs and many said that al
though they have mixed feelings
about the union, they support
unionization as the only legally
sanctioned means of gaining
recognition.
Many clericals believe that
the union, although it might not
increase their wages or job sat

isfaction, would be able to im
prove their working conditions.
A large percentage of
clericals are unsure of
the effect a union would
have on their future wages.
Twenty-eight percent thought a
union might be able to improve
on the wage plan offered by the
University, 36 percent thought it
would not and 36 percent were
unsure.
Also, when asked if a union
would increase their'overall job
satisfaction, 28 percent of the
respondents thought it would, 57
percent did not think it would
and 15 percent were unsure.
Forty-seven percent of the in
terviewees responded "yes" to
the question, "Do you think the
union could improve your work
ing conditions?" Thirty-six per
cent did not think the union
could improve their working
conditions and 17 percent of the
clericals were unsure.

Few workers felt that the
University's recent pay scale
changes affected their decision
on whether they were for the
union or against it. Eighty-four
percent said it had not affected
their decision whereas 16 per
cent said that it had.
Workers employed less than
two years were more likely to
have been affected by the Uni
versity's pay scale announce
ment than workers employed
more than six years. Twenty
eight percent of those clericals
employed here less than two
years were affected by the an
nouncement. whereas only 6
percent of those employed here
more than six years said the
changes influenced their de
cision.
Most respondents said the
University's new wage plan an
nouncement only reaffirmed
the decision they had already
made. Clericals in favor of the
union said the changes were
"too little, too late," and that
they were now more in favor of
the union because the changes
were designed "strictly to have
us back off."
Those opposed to the union
said the changes reaffirmed
their belief that "you don't need
a union to get better wages."
Although the difference be
tween voting for unionization
and actually joining the union
was not always clear to some,
the majority of those polled said
they would join the union if it
were formed.
Asked, "If a clerical worker's
union was formed, would you
join?" the following responses
were given:
Yes 46%
No 39%
Unsure 15%
Of those polled, 45 percent
said they had signed blue
cards while 55 percent
had not. Of those who did sign
blue cards, 62 percent said they
would vote for unionization and

-69 percent said they would ul
timately join the union if it were
formed.
Of the 55 percent who had not
signed bluecards, 69 percent
said they would vote "no" on
unionization and 57 percent said
they would not join the union if it
were formed.
The person most likely to sup
port and vote for the union is
less than 30 years old, has been
employed at Stanford for two to
six years and earns less than
$13,000 per year.
Those opposed to and likely to
vote against unionization are
most likely to be more than 45
years old, have been employed
here for more than six years and
earn more than $13,000 per year.
One clerical worker, 62, and a

16-year employee, said she did
not support unionization. This
office assistant, whose three
children graduated from Stan
ford, said, "I don't see what
we'd gain from unionization. I
see it as an adversarial situation
and I'm concerned that it would |
involve a group larger than the
University.'' Speaking about the
University, she said, "They've
treated me well, I've enjoyed
their benefits."
Another clerical, a secretary
who has worked for the Univer
sity for three years, is voting for
the union because "women and
their work are not valued in this
society."
The secretary, calling the
people she works with "excep

tional," says she loves working
here and "wants to grow and get
promoted'' with the people she
is working with.
This secretary also said she is
often asked to go beyond her job
description to find houses,
furniture and other items for in
coming visiting professors. Al
though she doesn't like the at
titude that "servants don't de
serve to be paid well," she said
she is glad to do the extra work,
"but when I don't get supported
over a lousy $20 raise, that
hurts."
Not all of the clericals fit into
the above categories. A 24-year
old secretary in the Office of De
velopment opposes the union be
cause she "has a good working
relationship" and feels that "we
don't need another bureaucracy
here." Noting that the griev
ance procedure is not fair and
that many clericals work in
crowded conditions, she said, "I
think there are problems that

need to be addressed, but the
union is not the best vehicle.''
Other trends among the
clerical and library work
ers indicated by the sur
vey include:
• Library personnel are more
likely than other employee
groups to support the
unionization effort and believe
that the union could increase
their wages, working condi
tions. and job satisfaction. Sev
enty-eight percent of library
workers surveyed said they
would vote for unionization, 78
percent believe it could improve
their working conditions and 61
percent said it would probably
increase their overall job satis
faction.
In comparison, only 41 per
cent of the office assistants and
29 percent of the secretaries
said they would would vote for
the union, and only 23 percent of
the office assistants and secre
taries believe that a union would

increase their overall job satis
faction.
• Generally, workers earning
less than $13,000 are more likely
than workers earning more than
$13,000 to think that Local 715
could negotiate better wages.
Thirty-eight percent of those
earning up to $13,000 think they
could get a better wage plan

from union negotiations, where
as only 20 percent of those earn
ing more than $13,000 think this
is likely.
Forty-seven percent of those
earning more than $13,000 think
Local 715 could not negotiate a
better wage plan, compared
with 27 percent of those earning
up to $13,000.

• In terms of education, work
ers with at least a college
degree are more likely than
those without college degrees to
believe that a union will bring
increased job satisfaction. Thir
ty-seven percent of the college
graduates believed this, com
pared with 20 percent of non
graduates.
