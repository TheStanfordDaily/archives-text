# Survey conducting logistics
## 
### 
The results of the Dailyjs
survey are based on data
compiled from telephone
interviews with 207 clerical and
library workers eligible to vote
in the May 7 union representa
tion election.
A random sample of employ
ees was taken from those listed
in the Stanford Faculty/Staff
Directory with job classi
fications that would be included
in the bargaining unit United
Stanford Employees Local 715
seeks to represent. All employ
ees from every third page of the
directory were called.
The survey was conducted on
April 15-18 by Daily Magazine
coordinators Raymond Mills
and Erin Craig with the as
sistance of regular members of
the Daily staff.
Clerical and library support
staff personnel were asked to
respond to 14 questions dealing

with the current unionization ef
fort. As respondents were as
sured at the time of the in
terviews, all responses are com
pletely confidential.
Survey data was tabulated at
the Stanford Center for In
formation Technology (CIT) on
a program called Statistical
Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS) by Kay Magill, a Ph D
.candidate in the Stanford Orad
uate Softool of Communication
with the consultation of Diana
Tillinghast, assistant professor
in the Communication Depart
ment here.
Readers should keep in mind
two limitations of our survey.
The poll results are static; this
means that they reflect the opin
ions of the workers at the time
of the actual interviews. The
outcome is not intended to pre
dict the of the May 7
election since many opinions

are likely to change before elec
tion day.
Also, interviews were com
pleted with 40 percent of our
sample of 516 eligible voters.
The sample error is plus or mi
nus 7 percent, meaning that
opinions of all eligible voters
could vary as much as 7 percent
above or below the survey re
sults. Such a response rate is
lowpr than is normally
slraDic, DuC a till la enough Co
yield significant statistical re>,
suits.
Cross tabulations, which
compare responses to one ques
tion with answers to another
question for possible correla
tions, were not used unless they
showed a statistical signifi
cance factor less than .05 per
cent, which would mean there is
a 95 percent chance that cor
relations were not due to chance
alone.
