### Neil MacFarquhar Seth Zuckerman 
Editor'• note: Since his
letter to the entire Uni
versity faculty and staff
about the clerical unionization
issue in late January \ President
Donald Kennedy has expressed
his views several times on this
topic, most recently to the Daily
in an interview granted espe
cially for this Daily Magazine.
Following are excerpts from
that interview
★ ★ ★
Could you outline how you feel
about unionization at Stanford?
Yes. I think that any position
that a university president
would take with regard to a
union has to be looked at with re
spect to that particular election.

ia particular group of employees
and a particular vote involving
one or more unions.
Often, as you know, in such
elections there are a couple of
different unions contesting in
the election, and one doesn't
have a bi-polar choice but a tri
polar choice or a many-polar
ichoice. So. seldom is it a matter
of being pro-union or anti-union.
It's almost always a choice be
tween a particular situation in
which you have several union
(opportunities.

"It is not in the interests of both the office
workers and the University to select this
union as their bargaining unit."
— President Donald Kennedy

In this one, we only have one,
but my position is that it is not in
the interests of both the office
workers and the University to
select this union as their
bargaining unit.
I emphasized in the letter and
I'll emphasize to you now that
that's not a general decision
about the validity of unions, it's
a specific decision on this union,
for this group of workers in this
election
You have talked about the
hostility USE has
brought to the University
and the atmosphere that has
prevailed since they unionized
nine or 10 years ago. Could you
be a little more specific about
the things that USE does to
engender this hostility?
I think that there are two
areas that have troubled us par
ticularly over the past 10 years.
One is their style of collective
bargaining in which it has often
been difficult for us even to sort
out the initial issues and get
agreement about what's on the
table and get things considered
in a comprehensive way. There

is really a lot of wheel-spinning
which has been necessary be
cause of an attitude that I have
found to be confrontational.
The other and possibly more
serious problem for us is the
level of grievances, some of
which are important but some
of which seem not so important,
a large percentage of which are
taking a lot of time. If that ac
tivity were productive — pro
ductive from the union's point
of view — in that it yielded a
large proportion in favor of em
ployees, you could understand
the argument that that level of
confrontational activity is nec
essary.
But in fact, a rather low per
centage of those have resulted
in actions for the employee —
indeed a lower percentage, sig
nificantly lower, than of the

grievance procedures installed
by the University for non
bargaining unit personnel.
Have the Election Bulletins
discussed the essential issues of
this campaign?
I think you have a limited
number of points you can make.
It seems to me that those made
by the University center around
the basic question of this elec
tion, which is: "Shall this par
ticular union represent these
employees and will that be of
advantage to them, and do the

employees understand how
many of their rights they are
surrendering as they cast their
vote?"
I've said all along that there
are some important questions
which need to be addressed. Our
employees know and can ex
amine our record of addressing
the main ones
I think the most important is
sue, the one that's really basic,
is the issue of compensation. We
did address that essentially, and
we showed something that
we've known all along and
something that has in fact ap
peared in published data. That
is that unionized employees —
USE employees at Stanford —
have not done as well unionized
as clerical workers have done
without benefit of a union. His
torically, if you compare the in
creases of USE bargaining unit
employees at Stanford, with the
increases received by clerical
workers, the fact is that the
clericals have done better here
over the past five years.
But aren't you comparing
different classifications
of workers — comparing
apples to oranges?

Look, there are some experi
ments that nature just doesn't
make for you. and that's one of
them. There are two available
experiments: How do unionized
and non-unionized workers at
the same salary levels at Stan
ford compare with each other,
and how do workers in
equivalent job classifications at
Stanford and elsewhere —
nearby, in the same neighbor
hood. unionized and non
unionized. compare.
What we have shown is that
our people have done better in
both experiments. Now you can
say that a third experiment
would be desirable if we only
had it. But of the two we have, I
think they are as reasonable as
you can get.
What solutions has the Uni
versity proposed for such spe
cific problems as childcare and
the grievance procedure?
With respect to the grievance
procedure I think the one the
University has produced regu
larly better results for employ
ees than the one that USE has.
The only way I would think that
you could evaluate the griev
ance procedure is in terms of its
outcome for the employees who
are using it and it seems to me
that USE has difficulties, that
theirs is not working as well as
the one the University has in
place for non-bargaining unit
employees.
What about childcare?
Childcare is something that
we've been working on fairly
regularly over the past several
years. I think many women find
Stanford's childcare arrange
ments less than they should be.
But you have to look at childcare
and other fringe benefits as part
of a general package that in
cludes compensation and all
other benefits.
It does have the difficulty In
that a class of people is sub
sidized by another class of non
beneficiaries and I should think
the union would want to work
that out very carefully before it
decides to push for that in con
tract negotiations.
How would you respond to the
union's feelings that the issues
have not been adequately ad
dressed?
Every one of the issues you've
mentioned except childcare —
which strikes me as one that's
not right at the top of the list —
has been addressed in the elec
tion bulletins. We've addressed
comparative compensation and
we've addressed the adequacy
of the union's grievance pro
cedures.
How do you formulate the
opinions expressed in
your letters?
I think them through. I've
written two letters. In the first
one I did a very simple thing: I
announced my own position. I
gave considerable thought to
whether it was the wisest thing
to do to announce that position. I
concluded that it was and that it
was the fairest thing to do.
Basically, I think that the union
and many others believe that
the president should remain
neutral on this issue and I don't
see how a president could or
even wish to remain neutral on
an issue like this.
But should you have argued
that position?
Maybe I shouldn't have de
clared a position so early. As a
matter of fact, if one has a posi
tion and is providing informa
tion and pledging the staff to
provide information, it seems to
me that it is only fair to disclose
your position. I said what I felt
about the union. The main
purpose was simply to inform
people that: a) There was an
election and b) what we would
be doing about it. It was very
important that supervisors and

other people representing this
position understand what the
National Labor Relations Act
says what they can do and can't
do.
Whom did you consult with in
writing your letters?
It varies for different things.
Obviously, the people with the
most knowledge are the ones in
the University Counsel's office.
I also consult with the provost as
he is a member of the faculty
and represents them.
Do you consult with any out
side sources?
President Kennedy shook his
head, indicating no. We like our
legal staff just fine.
What reaction did you ex
pect the election bulle
tins would inspire in the
clerical workers?
The reaction depends on what
they feel. The reaction we've
hoped for is that the bulletins
would inspire people to ask
questions. For almost everyone

"I SE employees at Stanford have not done
as well unionized as clerical workers have
done without benefit of a union. "
— President Donald Kennedy

of those issues there are places
where an appropriately
launched question can produce
some information. There are
challenges to be made against
the University's information
and the way it's presented.
What we want are a lot of vot
ers who are really qualified to
vote. We want the people that
turn out to have really thought
about the issues and listened to
both sides.
If we lose the election to vot
ers like that, then we will accept
that and bargain in good faith.
The thing I don't want is an elec
tion with a low voter turnout be
cause the people don't under
stand that not voting is not
equivalent to a no vote.
Also, we still find some peo
ple who don't know that this is
an honest-to-God secret ballot.
You would think that that's such
a rich American tradition that

everybody understood it. But
there are those who don't be
lieve that the union or the Uni
versity can't somehow after the
fact find out how they voted We
want them to understand that
the National Labor Relations
Board supervises the election
and there isn't any possible way
for anyone to find out how they
voted.
How much influence did
OSOC's organizing effort have
on policy changes?
So many people make policy
here that it's hard for me to say.
I know that while OSOC was still
a relatively small group, the
personnel department made a
compelling case for improving
our competitive position which
had seriously eroded in the local
market. In the past two years
we had noted serious drops in
our ability to recruit and retain J
clerical workers. We were slow
in formulating the meaning ot
these drops and slow in for

mulating the salary increases,
but I want to make it very clear
that this study preceded the or
ganizing effort.
Did the unionization move
ment speed up the process of
changing the pay structure?
No, it may have produced
stronger and quicker consensus
on recommendations which
were being made for changes
but it certainly didn't generate
it. The total package is the re
sult of our struggling with our
market position.
How would unionization!
change the atmosphere in Uni
versity offices? Would the rela
tionship between professors and
secretaries become ad
versarial?
I'm not predicting anything so
dire, but relatively few of our
faculty have encountered a shop
steward before. It would inject
a new element into faculty-staff
relations.

ers who are really qualified to
vote. We want the people that
turn out to have really thought
about the issues and listened to
both sides.
If we lose the election to vot
ers like that, then we will accept
that and bargain in good faith.
The thing I don't want is an elec
tion with a low voter turnout be
cause the people don't under
stand that not voting is not
equivalent to a no vote.
Also, we still find some peo
ple who don't know that this is
an honest-to-God secret ballot.
You would think that that's such
a rich American tradition that

everybody understood it. But
there are those who don't be
lieve that the union or the Uni
versity can't somehow after the
fact find out how they voted We
want them to understand that
the National Labor Relations
Board supervises the election
and there isn't any possible way
for anyone to find out how they
voted.
How much influence did
OSOC's organizing effort have
on policy changes?
So many people make policy
here that it's hard for me to say.
I know that while OSOC was still
a relatively small group, the
personnel department made a
compelling case for improving
our competitive position which
had seriously eroded in the local
market. In the past two years
we had noted serious drops in
our ability to recruit and retain J
clerical workers. We were slow
in formulating the meaning ot
these drops and slow in for

mulating the salary increases,
but I want to make it very clear
that this study preceded the or
ganizing effort.
Did the unionization move
ment speed up the process of
changing the pay structure?
No, it may have produced
stronger and quicker consensus
on recommendations which
were being made for changes
but it certainly didn't generate
it. The total package is the re
sult of our struggling with our
market position.
How would unionization!
change the atmosphere in Uni
versity offices? Would the rela
tionship between professors and
secretaries become ad
versarial?
I'm not predicting anything so
dire, but relatively few of our
faculty have encountered a shop
steward before. It would inject
a new element into faculty-staff
relations.

Editor'• note: Since his
letter to the entire Uni
versity faculty and staff
about the clerical unionization
issue in late January \ President
Donald Kennedy has expressed
his views several times on this
topic, most recently to the Daily
in an interview granted espe
cially for this Daily Magazine.
Following are excerpts from
that interview
★ ★ ★
Could you outline how you feel
about unionization at Stanford?
Yes. I think that any position
that a university president
would take with regard to a
union has to be looked at with re
spect to that particular election.

ia particular group of employees
and a particular vote involving
one or more unions.
Often, as you know, in such
elections there are a couple of
different unions contesting in
the election, and one doesn't
have a bi-polar choice but a tri
polar choice or a many-polar
ichoice. So. seldom is it a matter
of being pro-union or anti-union.
It's almost always a choice be
tween a particular situation in
which you have several union
(opportunities.

"It is not in the interests of both the office
workers and the University to select this
union as their bargaining unit."
— President Donald Kennedy

In this one, we only have one,
but my position is that it is not in
the interests of both the office
workers and the University to
select this union as their
bargaining unit.
I emphasized in the letter and
I'll emphasize to you now that
that's not a general decision
about the validity of unions, it's
a specific decision on this union,
for this group of workers in this
election
You have talked about the
hostility USE has
brought to the University
and the atmosphere that has
prevailed since they unionized
nine or 10 years ago. Could you
be a little more specific about
the things that USE does to
engender this hostility?
I think that there are two
areas that have troubled us par
ticularly over the past 10 years.
One is their style of collective
bargaining in which it has often
been difficult for us even to sort
out the initial issues and get
agreement about what's on the
table and get things considered
in a comprehensive way. There

is really a lot of wheel-spinning
which has been necessary be
cause of an attitude that I have
found to be confrontational.
The other and possibly more
serious problem for us is the
level of grievances, some of
which are important but some
of which seem not so important,
a large percentage of which are
taking a lot of time. If that ac
tivity were productive — pro
ductive from the union's point
of view — in that it yielded a
large proportion in favor of em
ployees, you could understand
the argument that that level of
confrontational activity is nec
essary.
But in fact, a rather low per
centage of those have resulted
in actions for the employee —
indeed a lower percentage, sig
nificantly lower, than of the

grievance procedures installed
by the University for non
bargaining unit personnel.
Have the Election Bulletins
discussed the essential issues of
this campaign?
I think you have a limited
number of points you can make.
It seems to me that those made
by the University center around
the basic question of this elec
tion, which is: "Shall this par
ticular union represent these
employees and will that be of
advantage to them, and do the

employees understand how
many of their rights they are
surrendering as they cast their
vote?"
I've said all along that there
are some important questions
which need to be addressed. Our
employees know and can ex
amine our record of addressing
the main ones
I think the most important is
sue, the one that's really basic,
is the issue of compensation. We
did address that essentially, and
we showed something that
we've known all along and
something that has in fact ap
peared in published data. That
is that unionized employees —
USE employees at Stanford —
have not done as well unionized
as clerical workers have done
without benefit of a union. His
torically, if you compare the in
creases of USE bargaining unit
employees at Stanford, with the
increases received by clerical
workers, the fact is that the
clericals have done better here
over the past five years.
But aren't you comparing
different classifications
of workers — comparing
apples to oranges?

Look, there are some experi
ments that nature just doesn't
make for you. and that's one of
them. There are two available
experiments: How do unionized
and non-unionized workers at
the same salary levels at Stan
ford compare with each other,
and how do workers in
equivalent job classifications at
Stanford and elsewhere —
nearby, in the same neighbor
hood. unionized and non
unionized. compare.
What we have shown is that
our people have done better in
both experiments. Now you can
say that a third experiment
would be desirable if we only
had it. But of the two we have, I
think they are as reasonable as
you can get.
What solutions has the Uni
versity proposed for such spe
cific problems as childcare and
the grievance procedure?
With respect to the grievance
procedure I think the one the
University has produced regu
larly better results for employ
ees than the one that USE has.
The only way I would think that
you could evaluate the griev
ance procedure is in terms of its
outcome for the employees who
are using it and it seems to me
that USE has difficulties, that
theirs is not working as well as
the one the University has in
place for non-bargaining unit
employees.
What about childcare?
Childcare is something that
we've been working on fairly
regularly over the past several
years. I think many women find
Stanford's childcare arrange
ments less than they should be.
But you have to look at childcare
and other fringe benefits as part
of a general package that in
cludes compensation and all
other benefits.
It does have the difficulty In
that a class of people is sub
sidized by another class of non
beneficiaries and I should think
the union would want to work
that out very carefully before it
decides to push for that in con
tract negotiations.
How would you respond to the
union's feelings that the issues
have not been adequately ad
dressed?
Every one of the issues you've
mentioned except childcare —
which strikes me as one that's
not right at the top of the list —
has been addressed in the elec
tion bulletins. We've addressed
comparative compensation and
we've addressed the adequacy
of the union's grievance pro
cedures.
How do you formulate the
opinions expressed in
your letters?
I think them through. I've
written two letters. In the first
one I did a very simple thing: I
announced my own position. I
gave considerable thought to
whether it was the wisest thing
to do to announce that position. I
concluded that it was and that it
was the fairest thing to do.
Basically, I think that the union
and many others believe that
the president should remain
neutral on this issue and I don't
see how a president could or
even wish to remain neutral on
an issue like this.
But should you have argued
that position?
Maybe I shouldn't have de
clared a position so early. As a
matter of fact, if one has a posi
tion and is providing informa
tion and pledging the staff to
provide information, it seems to
me that it is only fair to disclose
your position. I said what I felt
about the union. The main
purpose was simply to inform
people that: a) There was an
election and b) what we would
be doing about it. It was very
important that supervisors and

other people representing this
position understand what the
National Labor Relations Act
says what they can do and can't
do.
Whom did you consult with in
writing your letters?
It varies for different things.
Obviously, the people with the
most knowledge are the ones in
the University Counsel's office.
I also consult with the provost as
he is a member of the faculty
and represents them.
Do you consult with any out
side sources?
President Kennedy shook his
head, indicating no. We like our
legal staff just fine.
What reaction did you ex
pect the election bulle
tins would inspire in the
clerical workers?
The reaction depends on what
they feel. The reaction we've
hoped for is that the bulletins
would inspire people to ask
questions. For almost everyone

"I SE employees at Stanford have not done
as well unionized as clerical workers have
done without benefit of a union. "
— President Donald Kennedy

of those issues there are places
where an appropriately
launched question can produce
some information. There are
challenges to be made against
the University's information
and the way it's presented.
What we want are a lot of vot
ers who are really qualified to
vote. We want the people that
turn out to have really thought
about the issues and listened to
both sides.
If we lose the election to vot
ers like that, then we will accept

opinions expressed in
your letters?
I think them through. I've
written two letters. In the first
one I did a very simple thing: I
announced my own position. I
gave considerable thought to
whether it was the wisest thing
to do to announce that position. I
concluded that it was and that it
was the fairest thing to do.
Basically, I think that the union
and many others believe that
the president should remain
neutral on this issue and I don't
see how a president could or
even wish to remain neutral on
an issue like this.
But should you have argued
that position?
Maybe I shouldn't have de
clared a position so early. As a
matter of fact, if one has a posi
tion and is providing informa
tion and pledging the staff to
provide information, it seems to
me that it is only fair to disclose
your position. I said what I felt
about the union. The main
purpose was simply to inform
people that: a) There was an
election and b) what we would
be doing about it. It was very
important that supervisors and

other people representing this
position understand what the
National Labor Relations Act
says what they can do and can't
do.
Whom did you consult with in
writing your letters?
It varies for different things.
Obviously, the people with the
most knowledge are the ones in
the University Counsel's office.
I also consult with the provost as
he is a member of the faculty
and represents them.
Do you consult with any out
side sources?
President Kennedy shook his
head, indicating no. We like our
legal staff just fine.
What reaction did you ex
pect the election bulle
tins would inspire in the
clerical workers?
The reaction depends on what
they feel. The reaction we've
hoped for is that the bulletins
would inspire people to ask
questions. For almost everyone

"I SE employees at Stanford have not done
as well unionized as clerical workers have
done without benefit of a union. "
— President Donald Kennedy

of those issues there are places
where an appropriately
launched question can produce
some information. There are
challenges to be made against
the University's information
and the way it's presented.
What we want are a lot of vot
ers who are really qualified to
vote. We want the people that
turn out to have really thought
about the issues and listened to
both sides.
If we lose the election to vot
ers like that, then we will accept
that and bargain in good faith.
The thing I don't want is an elec
tion with a low voter turnout be
cause the people don't under
stand that not voting is not
equivalent to a no vote.
Also, we still find some peo
ple who don't know that this is
an honest-to-God secret ballot.
You would think that that's such
a rich American tradition that

everybody understood it. But
there are those who don't be
lieve that the union or the Uni
versity can't somehow after the
fact find out how they voted We
want them to understand that
the National Labor Relations
Board supervises the election
and there isn't any possible way
for anyone to find out how they
voted.
How much influence did
OSOC's organizing effort have
on policy changes?
So many people make policy
here that it's hard for me to say.
I know that while OSOC was still
a relatively small group, the
personnel department made a
compelling case for improving
our competitive position which
had seriously eroded in the local
market. In the past two years
we had noted serious drops in
our ability to recruit and retain J
clerical workers. We were slow
in formulating the meaning ot
these drops and slow in for

mulating the salary increases,
but I want to make it very clear
that this study preceded the or
ganizing effort.
Did the unionization move
ment speed up the process of
changing the pay structure?
No, it may have produced
stronger and quicker consensus
on recommendations which
were being made for changes
but it certainly didn't generate
it. The total package is the re
sult of our struggling with our
market position.
How would unionization!
change the atmosphere in Uni
versity offices? Would the rela
tionship between professors and
secretaries become ad
versarial?
I'm not predicting anything so
dire, but relatively few of our
faculty have encountered a shop
steward before. It would inject
a new element into faculty-staff
relations.

Editor'• note: Since his
letter to the entire Uni
versity faculty and staff
about the clerical unionization
issue in late January \ President
Donald Kennedy has expressed
his views several times on this
topic, most recently to the Daily
in an interview granted espe
cially for this Daily Magazine.
Following are excerpts from
that interview
★ ★ ★
Could you outline how you feel
about unionization at Stanford?
Yes. I think that any position
that a university president
would take with regard to a
union has to be looked at with re
spect to that particular election.

ia particular group of employees
and a particular vote involving
one or more unions.
Often, as you know, in such
elections there are a couple of
different unions contesting in
the election, and one doesn't
have a bi-polar choice but a tri
polar choice or a many-polar
ichoice. So. seldom is it a matter
of being pro-union or anti-union.
It's almost always a choice be
tween a particular situation in
which you have several union
(opportunities.

"It is not in the interests of both the office
workers and the University to select this
union as their bargaining unit."
— President Donald Kennedy

In this one, we only have one,
but my position is that it is not in
the interests of both the office
workers and the University to
select this union as their
bargaining unit.
I emphasized in the letter and
I'll emphasize to you now that
that's not a general decision
about the validity of unions, it's
a specific decision on this union,
for this group of workers in this
election
You have talked about the
hostility USE has
brought to the University
and the atmosphere that has
prevailed since they unionized
nine or 10 years ago. Could you
be a little more specific about
the things that USE does to
engender this hostility?
I think that there are two
areas that have troubled us par
ticularly over the past 10 years.
One is their style of collective
bargaining in which it has often
been difficult for us even to sort
out the initial issues and get
agreement about what's on the
table and get things considered
in a comprehensive way. There

is really a lot of wheel-spinning
which has been necessary be
cause of an attitude that I have
found to be confrontational.
The other and possibly more
serious problem for us is the
level of grievances, some of
which are important but some
of which seem not so important,
a large percentage of which are
taking a lot of time. If that ac
tivity were productive — pro
ductive from the union's point
of view — in that it yielded a
large proportion in favor of em
ployees, you could understand
the argument that that level of
confrontational activity is nec
essary.
But in fact, a rather low per
centage of those have resulted
in actions for the employee —
indeed a lower percentage, sig
nificantly lower, than of the

grievance procedures installed
by the University for non
bargaining unit personnel.
Have the Election Bulletins
discussed the essential issues of
this campaign?
I think you have a limited
number of points you can make.
It seems to me that those made
by the University center around
the basic question of this elec
tion, which is: "Shall this par
ticular union represent these
employees and will that be of
advantage to them, and do the

employees understand how
many of their rights they are
surrendering as they cast their
vote?"
I've said all along that there
are some important questions
which need to be addressed. Our
employees know and can ex
amine our record of addressing
the main ones
I think the most important is
sue, the one that's really basic,
is the issue of compensation. We
did address that essentially, and
we showed something that
we've known all along and
something that has in fact ap
peared in published data. That
is that unionized employees —
USE employees at Stanford —
have not done as well unionized
as clerical workers have done
without benefit of a union. His
torically, if you compare the in
creases of USE bargaining unit
employees at Stanford, with the
increases received by clerical
workers, the fact is that the
clericals have done better here
over the past five years.
But aren't you comparing
different classifications
of workers — comparing
apples to oranges?

Look, there are some experi
ments that nature just doesn't
make for you. and that's one of
them. There are two available
experiments: How do unionized
and non-unionized workers at
the same salary levels at Stan
ford compare with each other,
and how do workers in
equivalent job classifications at
Stanford and elsewhere —
nearby, in the same neighbor
hood. unionized and non
unionized. compare.
What we have shown is that
our people have done better in
both experiments. Now you can
say that a third experiment
would be desirable if we only
had it. But of the two we have, I
think they are as reasonable as
you can get.
What solutions has the Uni
versity proposed for such spe
cific problems as childcare and
the grievance procedure?
With respect to the grievance
procedure I think the one the
University has produced regu
larly better results for employ
ees than the one that USE has.
The only way I would think that
you could evaluate the griev
ance procedure is in terms of its
outcome for the employees who
are using it and it seems to me
that USE has difficulties, that
theirs is not working as well as
the one the University has in
place for non-bargaining unit
employees.
What about childcare?
Childcare is something that
we've been working on fairly
regularly over the past several
years. I think many women find
Stanford's childcare arrange
ments less than they should be.
But you have to look at childcare
and other fringe benefits as part
of a general package that in
cludes compensation and all
other benefits.
It does have the difficulty In
that a class of people is sub
sidized by another class of non
beneficiaries and I should think
the union would want to work
that out very carefully before it
decides to push for that in con
tract negotiations.
How would you respond to the
union's feelings that the issues
have not been adequately ad
dressed?
Every one of the issues you've
mentioned except childcare —
which strikes me as one that's
not right at the top of the list —
has been addressed in the elec
tion bulletins. We've addressed
comparative compensation and
we've addressed the adequacy
of the union's grievance pro
cedures.
How do you formulate the
opinions expressed in
your letters?
I think them through. I've
written two letters. In the first

make for you. and that's one of
them. There are two available
experiments: How do unionized
and non-unionized workers at
the same salary levels at Stan
ford compare with each other,
and how do workers in
equivalent job classifications at
Stanford and elsewhere —
nearby, in the same neighbor
hood. unionized and non
unionized. compare.
What we have shown is that
our people have done better in
both experiments. Now you can
say that a third experiment
would be desirable if we only
had it. But of the two we have, I
think they are as reasonable as
you can get.
What solutions has the Uni
versity proposed for such spe
cific problems as childcare and
the grievance procedure?
With respect to the grievance
procedure I think the one the
University has produced regu
larly better results for employ
ees than the one that USE has.
The only way I would think that
you could evaluate the griev
ance procedure is in terms of its
outcome for the employees who
are using it and it seems to me
that USE has difficulties, that
theirs is not working as well as
the one the University has in
place for non-bargaining unit
employees.
What about childcare?
Childcare is something that
we've been working on fairly
regularly over the past several
years. I think many women find
Stanford's childcare arrange
ments less than they should be.
But you have to look at childcare
and other fringe benefits as part
of a general package that in
cludes compensation and all
other benefits.
It does have the difficulty In
that a class of people is sub
sidized by another class of non
beneficiaries and I should think
the union would want to work
that out very carefully before it
decides to push for that in con
tract negotiations.
How would you respond to the
union's feelings that the issues
have not been adequately ad
dressed?
Every one of the issues you've
mentioned except childcare —
which strikes me as one that's
not right at the top of the list —
has been addressed in the elec
tion bulletins. We've addressed
comparative compensation and
we've addressed the adequacy
of the union's grievance pro
cedures.
How do you formulate the
opinions expressed in
your letters?
I think them through. I've
written two letters. In the first
one I did a very simple thing: I
announced my own position. I
gave considerable thought to
whether it was the wisest thing
to do to announce that position. I
concluded that it was and that it
was the fairest thing to do.
Basically, I think that the union
and many others believe that
the president should remain
neutral on this issue and I don't
see how a president could or
even wish to remain neutral on
an issue like this.
But should you have argued
that position?
Maybe I shouldn't have de
clared a position so early. As a
matter of fact, if one has a posi
tion and is providing informa
tion and pledging the staff to
provide information, it seems to
me that it is only fair to disclose
your position. I said what I felt
about the union. The main
purpose was simply to inform
people that: a) There was an
election and b) what we would
be doing about it. It was very
important that supervisors and

other people representing this
position understand what the
National Labor Relations Act
says what they can do and can't
do.
Whom did you consult with in
writing your letters?
It varies for different things.
Obviously, the people with the
most knowledge are the ones in
the University Counsel's office.
I also consult with the provost as
he is a member of the faculty
and represents them.
Do you consult with any out
side sources?
President Kennedy shook his
head, indicating no. We like our
legal staff just fine.
What reaction did you ex
pect the election bulle
tins would inspire in the
clerical workers?
The reaction depends on what
they feel. The reaction we've
hoped for is that the bulletins
would inspire people to ask
questions. For almost everyone

"I SE employees at Stanford have not done
as well unionized as clerical workers have
done without benefit of a union. "
— President Donald Kennedy

of those issues there are places
where an appropriately
launched question can produce
some information. There are
challenges to be made against
the University's information
and the way it's presented.
What we want are a lot of vot
ers who are really qualified to
vote. We want the people that
turn out to have really thought
about the issues and listened to
both sides.
If we lose the election to vot
ers like that, then we will accept
that and bargain in good faith.
The thing I don't want is an elec
tion with a low voter turnout be
cause the people don't under
stand that not voting is not
equivalent to a no vote.
Also, we still find some peo
ple who don't know that this is
an honest-to-God secret ballot.
You would think that that's such
a rich American tradition that

everybody understood it. But
there are those who don't be
lieve that the union or the Uni
versity can't somehow after the
fact find out how they voted We
want them to understand that
the National Labor Relations
Board supervises the election
and there isn't any possible way
for anyone to find out how they
voted.
How much influence did
OSOC's organizing effort have
on policy changes?
So many people make policy
here that it's hard for me to say.
I know that while OSOC was still
a relatively small group, the
personnel department made a
compelling case for improving
our competitive position which
had seriously eroded in the local
market. In the past two years
we had noted serious drops in
our ability to recruit and retain J
clerical workers. We were slow
in formulating the meaning ot
these drops and slow in for

mulating the salary increases,
but I want to make it very clear
that this study preceded the or
ganizing effort.
Did the unionization move
ment speed up the process of
changing the pay structure?
No, it may have produced
stronger and quicker consensus
on recommendations which
were being made for changes
but it certainly didn't generate
it. The total package is the re
sult of our struggling with our
market position.
How would unionization!
change the atmosphere in Uni
versity offices? Would the rela
tionship between professors and
secretaries become ad
versarial?
I'm not predicting anything so
dire, but relatively few of our
faculty have encountered a shop
steward before. It would inject
a new element into faculty-staff
relations.
