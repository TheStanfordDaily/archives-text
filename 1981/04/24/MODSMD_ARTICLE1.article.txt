# Government exploitation of oil-rich tribal lands debated
## 
### Leah Halper 
Though all participants in Wednes
day night's debate on development of
Native American lands said they mis
trust the government's interests in
tribal coal. gas. and oil reserves, there
were sharp disagreements about
future self-determination for energy
rich tribes.
"If the U.S. government needs
energy, they'll take it. Indians will not
have a choice in the matter," said Ed
Gabriel, Executive Director of the
Washington-based Council of Energy
Resource Tribes (CERT). CERT's
pilrpose. Gabriel told some 200 per
sons in Kresge Auditorium, is to neu
trally advise tribal leaders on the
technical, economic, and environmen
tal impacts of development so those
leaders can make choices that min
imize damage to tribal lands and
health.
CERT's claim to objectivity was
sharply criticized, as representatives
of the American Indian Movement
(AIM) confronted CERT directly for
the first time since CERT was
founded in 1975.
"I oppose any development where
by Indian nations have to dig up their
own land, their Mother Earth, to sur
vive, and I oppose any organization
that will help tribes along a suicidal
path," said Russell Redner, a Nevada
Shoshone and AIM activist.
CERT cannot be neutral. Redner in
sisted, by continuing in the tradition of
"moderationists" who have his
torically helped the U.S. government
"relieve native peoples of their
birthright."
The stakes involved are high, both
sides agreed. Lehman Brightman.
who is a South Dakota Sioux now
teaching at Contra Costa College, said
that the natural resources of U.S.
tribes make them sixth in the world in
terms of energy potential.
Twenty-six of the tribes, or about
halt the Native American population,
have joined CERT, hoping to avoid
graft and misrepresentation by feder
al "advocates" like the Bureau of In
dian Affairs (BIA). But Brightman
said he and many other Native Ameri
cans' suspect that CERT's initially
good intentions have degenerated into
another means of pushing develop
ment upon Native Americans.
AlM's policy against reservation
development was explained by Dennis
Banks. The South Dakota Ojiba as
sumed the chancellorship at D.Q. Uni
versity Survival School near Davis

since being exiled to California in the
early 1970s He has played an active
role in documenting health hazards of
development to Native Americans.
In '970. Banks said. AIM reacted
against black lung deaths among
Southwest Native American miners,
strip mining, oil extraction processes,
and water contamination on reserva
tions with a statement condemning de
struction of the earth Faced with the
hazardous tycle of uranium mining,
processing, and radioactive dumping
of waste in 1974, 50 tribes signed an in
ternational declaration to stop de
velopment on their lands.
Echoing AIM leaders' concerns
about environmental and health is
sues, Gabriel said that development
often has neither safely employed
Native Americans nor benefitted
them with electricity or business pa
trons. CERT was chartered, he said,
to give tribal leaders more choice in
these matters.
Gabriel admitted that CERT "gives
assistance to local tribal governments
more than to people on the local
level." but he defended the election
process whereby tribal leaders be
come CERT members. Each election,
he said, is ratified by local councils to
insure that those elected represent
their peoples' interests.
AIM panelists answered that CERT
will only benefit tribal leaders
"If you are at all aware of tribal pol
itics, you will know that the majority
of the constituency does not necessar
ily agree with the chairman." said
Lisa Chavez. Using her own San
Felipe Pueblo tribe as an example,
Chavez added that most Native Amer
icans cannot travel hundreds of miles
to hearings on tribal policy.
"When push comes to shove, there
will be mass migration back to the res
ervation to stop the despoilation of our
land," said Brightman.
"People will leave colleges and uni
versities and urban areas and begin to
stop development through open war
fare," Brightman added
Redner added that persecution of
AIM leaders, including Banks and
himself, has left Native Americans
"between a rock and a hard place" in
choices about their future.
"People on reservations who want
to survive cannot sit down and makg
logical, sound decisions â€” they want
to eat." Redner said "Each and every
activist and our families have been
chased around the country by the FBI
to eliminate the voice of the people,"

he added.
CERT cannot represent Native
Americans, Banks said, while getting
funds the same time for reserves and
resources on reservation lands.
Gabriel maintained that CERT is
independent of federal and corporate
influences despite allegations of hav
ing sold out.
When department officials pres
sured him on more than one occasion
to withdraw his support from funding
proposals made by other Native
American groups, he said, he "told
them to go to hell. " And though he ac
knowledged that AIM will get no fed
eral monies in the foreseeable future,
he reaffirmed his support for other
Native American projects
