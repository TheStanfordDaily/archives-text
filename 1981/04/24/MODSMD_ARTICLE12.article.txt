# Stanford art gallery features Aymara Indian weaving
## 
### Karen Johnson 
Most people think of weaving
as a craft; some, like George
Collier, Associate Professor of
Anthropology at Stanford, con
sider it an art form.
Whatever your views, the cur
rent exhibition of Aymara
weavings at the Stanford Art
Gallery is well worth a visit. Or
ganized by Collier, Rosa Men
doza de Rick, a former curator
of a Peruvian textile museum,
and Steven Berger, a private
collector, the exhibition of nine
teenth and early twentieth cen- v
tury weavings from Highland
Bolivia is a delightful departure
from the run-of-the-mill shiw.
According to Collier, it's an
attempt to do something dif-

ferent with ethnographic mate
rial.
"It displays ethnographic
material as art, but also tries to
convey an understanding of
what the ethnographic materi
als meant to the Aymara Indi
ans," said Collier.
The weavings, which cover
the walls of the three rooms of
the gallery, are dark and
somber in color. Nevertheless,
they give an impression of ex
treme vitality. The dark reds,
purples, browns and blacks fit
harmoniously together, and it is
their simplicity that draws you
to them. Collier compares their
style to that of the paintings of
Marc Rothko.
What makes the exhibition

different from most is the way it
is set up There is a large
amount of written background
material accompanying the
weavings, which explains where
they came from, what they were
used for, how the geographical
set-up of the Andes contributed
to this type of weaving and so
on, In addition to the written
material, are photographs from
the period showing the textiles
in actual use.
In some instances Collier has
used an anthropological set-up
to recreate the manner in which
the textiles were used. An ex
ample is a case showing cloths
and other paraphrenalia laid out
the way they would have been
for a typical ritualistic ceremo-

One of the interesting things
about the weaving is that they
were not merely used for utili
tarian purposes The Indians en
dowed their weavings with com
municative powers. In pre
historic and colonial times they
used the weavings to keep rec
ords by weaving symbols into
the textile to record informa
tion.
Many of the textiles on dis
play are woven with what is
known as Z' spun yarn. This
type of weaving was thought to
have protected the wearer
against danger while travelling
and to have kept bad spirits
away.
The textiles were also used to

delineate social standing. Cer
tain patterns, wools, and weav
ing techniques were reserved
for the nobles, while the
peasants made do with cheaper,
coarser materials.
While the weavings are the
main body of the exhibition,
there is an assortment of other
interesting items from Aymara
culture on display as well. A few
knitted pieces, (such as caps),
are shown. They are com
plimentary to the weavings in
that they replicate the design of

the patterns and from a distance
it's difficult to tell what is
woven and what is knitted.
Two memorable items on dis
play are the hats. One is made
from flamengo feathers, a won
derful swirl of muted orange
against the sombreness of the
weavings. The other is in the
middle room of the gallery and,
despite its size, is easily missed.
It's suspended from two ceiling
beams over the middle of the
room and could almost be mis
taken for a lampshade. It's an

ostrich-feather headdress that
measures a good two feet in
diameter and was worn by male
dancers. The size is impressive,
and one wonders how they ever
managed to keep it on, let alone
dance in it.
If you're in the mood to ab
sorb a bit of South American
culture, the exhibition runs until
Sunday, April 26th. The or
ganizers have made a genuine
effort to make the culture ac
cessible and understandable to
people, and the show is well
worth a visit.

One of the interesting things
about the weaving is that they
were not merely used for utili
tarian purposes The Indians en
dowed their weavings with com

the textile to record informa
tion.
Many of the textiles on dis
play are woven with what is
known as Z' spun yarn. This
type of weaving was thought to
have protected the wearer
against danger while travelling
and to have kept bad spirits
away.
The textiles were also used to

delineate social standing. Cer
tain patterns, wools, and weav
ing techniques were reserved
for the nobles, while the
peasants made do with cheaper,
coarser materials.
While the weavings are the
main body of the exhibition,
there is an assortment of other
interesting items from Aymara
culture on display as well. A few
knitted pieces, (such as caps),
are shown. They are com
plimentary to the weavings in
that they replicate the design of

the patterns and from a distance
it's difficult to tell what is
woven and what is knitted.
Two memorable items on dis
play are the hats. One is made
from flamengo feathers, a won
derful swirl of muted orange
against the sombreness of the
weavings. The other is in the
middle room of the gallery and,
despite its size, is easily missed.
It's suspended from two ceiling
beams over the middle of the
room and could almost be mis
taken for a lampshade. It's an

ostrich-feather headdress that
measures a good two feet in
diameter and was worn by male
dancers. The size is impressive,
and one wonders how they ever
managed to keep it on, let alone
dance in it.

effort to make the culture ac

Most people think of weaving
as a craft; some, like George
Collier, Associate Professor of
Anthropology at Stanford, con
sider it an art form.
Whatever your views, the cur
rent exhibition of Aymara
weavings at the Stanford Art
Gallery is well worth a visit. Or
ganized by Collier, Rosa Men
doza de Rick, a former curator
of a Peruvian textile museum,
and Steven Berger, a private
collector, the exhibition of nine
teenth and early twentieth cen- v
tury weavings from Highland
Bolivia is a delightful departure
from the run-of-the-mill shiw.
According to Collier, it's an
attempt to do something dif-

ferent with ethnographic mate
rial.
"It displays ethnographic
material as art, but also tries to
convey an understanding of
what the ethnographic materi
als meant to the Aymara Indi
ans," said Collier.
The weavings, which cover
the walls of the three rooms of
the gallery, are dark and
somber in color. Nevertheless,
they give an impression of ex
treme vitality. The dark reds,
purples, browns and blacks fit
harmoniously together, and it is
their simplicity that draws you
to them. Collier compares their
style to that of the paintings of
Marc Rothko.
What makes the exhibition

different from most is the way it
is set up There is a large
amount of written background
material accompanying the
weavings, which explains where
they came from, what they were
used for, how the geographical
set-up of the Andes contributed
to this type of weaving and so
on, In addition to the written
material, are photographs from
the period showing the textiles
in actual use.
