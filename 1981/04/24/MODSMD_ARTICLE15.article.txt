# Bob Pahre
## A 						'phoney' call — son of a gun 
### 
I was lying in bed counting the holes in the ceil
ing "When my phone rang
"Hello?" I said.
"Hello — may I speak to Senator Digbee.
please?"
"Speaking," I lied — I figured this could be one
of the most interesting wrong numbers I'd ever
had.
"As a voter in your district, I just wanted to
take this opportunity to inform you that I am op
posed to any sort of gun control or registration
that Congress may be considering at this time."
"Oh, may I ask why?"
"Well, as I see it, guns are an important part of
our country 's heritage. From the pilgrims on, we
have used them to tame this land ..."
"Kill Indians, buffalo, Mexicans and each oth
er, you mean. "
"Well, yes, but only in a nice sort of way, and
only in order to make this country the greatest on
earth. As I see it, we need guns to continue this
tradition and to protect our homes and families
with, should the communists invade our shores.
"Wouldn't a nuclear bomb be more practical?"
"Yes, but not everyone can afford one. The
right to kill belongs to every American, regard
less of their socio-economic background."
"How egalitarian of you," I replied. "Does this
mean we should make gun distribution one of our
social programs?"
"Yes, but only for the truly needy."
"What sort of program do you recommend?"
"Oh, maybe Saturday hight specials for those
on fixed incomes, magnums for the handicapped,
bazookas and grenade launchers for large one-pa
rent families ..."
"What about flamethrowers?"
"Flamethrowers are dangerous." he said
sternly. "They should be licensed."
"How foolish of me."
"Don't feel bad. A lot of people aren't very well
informed on the firearms issue."
"I suppose you're right."
"For instance, not many people know that more
people would be killed in an average American
city by a major earthquake than by handguns in an
entire year."
"And they don't try to make natural disasters
illegal."
"That's right," he said. "There's a double stan
dard at work here. "
. "But then, it's a lot easier to conceal a handgun
on your person than an earthquake."

"No," he replied. "That's a common mis
perception. Actually, it is impossible to hide a
handgun on your person. You have to use your
clothes."
"Maybe clothes are the problem then," I sug
gested.
"No, there's no problem. If people have the
right to kill in the privacy of their own home, they
should have the right to kill in public. This can
only be done by permitting concealed weapons."
"Of course — otherwise the victim could get
away unharmed "
"Exactly. We want him to fight back."
"Make it sporting "
"That's right," he said. "Sporting like hunt
ing."
"Oh, are you a hunter?" I asked.
"And proud of it. I'm doing my part to keep the
environment in balance."
"By killing animals?"
"Yes. Only by having concerned people kill
animals can the animal population continue to
survive."
"Makes perfect sense to me."
"I'm glad. A lot of people have trouble under
standing that."
"But just one thing I wonder about," I said. "If
you're a hunter, why are you concerned about
handgun legislation? After all, you don't hunt with
handguns, do you?"
"Actually, I always carry a handgun with me
when I hunt."
"Why?"
"To protect myself from other hunters."
"Yeah, I guess they're kind of crazy some
times."
"Yep."
"But not you. of course."
"But not me."
"Say. my secretary has just informed me that
the President is on my other line, so I'll have to let
you go now."
"I understand. Thanks for taking the time out to
listen to me."
"I'm always more than happy to talk with my
constituents. Oh. and one more thing . . "
"Yes?"
"I'm not Senator Digbee. You have the wrong
number."
(Despite all efforts to the contrary. Bob Pahre is
still an undeclared freshman. His column ap
pears every other Friday.)

bazookas and grenade launchers for large one-pa
rent families ..."
"What about flamethrowers?"
"Flamethrowers are dangerous." he said
sternly. "They should be licensed."
"How foolish of me."
"Don't feel bad. A lot of people aren't very well
informed on the firearms issue."
"I suppose you're right."
"For instance, not many people know that more
people would be killed in an average American
city by a major earthquake than by handguns in an
entire year."
"And they don't try to make natural disasters
illegal."
"That's right," he said. "There's a double stan
dard at work here. "
. "But then, it's a lot easier to conceal a handgun
on your person than an earthquake."

"No," he replied. "That's a common mis
perception. Actually, it is impossible to hide a
handgun on your person. You have to use your
clothes."
"Maybe clothes are the problem then," I sug
gested.
"No, there's no problem. If people have the
right to kill in the privacy of their own home, they
should have the right to kill in public. This can
only be done by permitting concealed weapons."
"Of course — otherwise the victim could get
away unharmed "
"Exactly. We want him to fight back."
"Make it sporting "
"That's right," he said. "Sporting like hunt
ing."
"Oh, are you a hunter?" I asked.
"And proud of it. I'm doing my part to keep the
environment in balance."
"By killing animals?"
"Yes. Only by having concerned people kill
animals can the animal population continue to
survive."
"Makes perfect sense to me."
"I'm glad. A lot of people have trouble under
standing that."
"But just one thing I wonder about," I said. "If
you're a hunter, why are you concerned about
handgun legislation? After all, you don't hunt with
handguns, do you?"
"Actually, I always carry a handgun with me
when I hunt."
"Why?"
"To protect myself from other hunters."
"Yeah, I guess they're kind of crazy some
times."
"Yep."
"But not you. of course."
"But not me."
"Say. my secretary has just informed me that
the President is on my other line, so I'll have to let
you go now."
"I understand. Thanks for taking the time out to
listen to me."
"I'm always more than happy to talk with my
constituents. Oh. and one more thing . . "
"Yes?"
"I'm not Senator Digbee. You have the wrong
number."
(Despite all efforts to the contrary. Bob Pahre is
still an undeclared freshman. His column ap

I was lying in bed counting the holes in the ceil
ing "When my phone rang
"Hello?" I said.
"Hello — may I speak to Senator Digbee.
please?"
"Speaking," I lied — I figured this could be one
of the most interesting wrong numbers I'd ever
had.
"As a voter in your district, I just wanted to
take this opportunity to inform you that I am op
posed to any sort of gun control or registration
that Congress may be considering at this time."
"Oh, may I ask why?"
"Well, as I see it, guns are an important part of
our country 's heritage. From the pilgrims on, we
have used them to tame this land ..."
"Kill Indians, buffalo, Mexicans and each oth
er, you mean. "
"Well, yes, but only in a nice sort of way, and
only in order to make this country the greatest on
earth. As I see it, we need guns to continue this
tradition and to protect our homes and families
with, should the communists invade our shores.
"Wouldn't a nuclear bomb be more practical?"
"Yes, but not everyone can afford one. The
right to kill belongs to every American, regard
less of their socio-economic background."
"How egalitarian of you," I replied. "Does this
mean we should make gun distribution one of our
social programs?"
"Yes, but only for the truly needy."
"What sort of program do you recommend?"
"Oh, maybe Saturday hight specials for those
on fixed incomes, magnums for the handicapped,
bazookas and grenade launchers for large one-pa
rent families ..."
"What about flamethrowers?"
"Flamethrowers are dangerous." he said
sternly. "They should be licensed."
"How foolish of me."
