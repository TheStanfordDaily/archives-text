## Julie Kulhanian/Richard Hovannisian Recognize Armenian genocide 
### 
April 24 is observed by Arme
nian communities the world
over in remembrance of the
fateful day in 1915 that marked
the beginning of the "final solu
tion" of the Armenian question
by the Turkish government. The
result of that solution was the
expulsion of an entire people
from its ancestral lands of three
thousand years and the scatter
ing of the survivors over six con
tinents. Ironically, the twen
tieth century has provided the
means for tiiose perventers in
power to take bold, aggressive
measures to eliminate racial,
religious, and ethnic elements
deemed undesirable.
The first step of this "final
solution" in the Armenian case
began on the night of April 23,
1915, with the mass arrest of na
tional religious, political lead
ers and their ultimate exile and
murder in desolate places in
Turkey. Then, in every Arme
nian province and community,
the carefully prepared plan un
folded: arrest of prominent in
dividuals who might lead the
population or inspire efforts at
selt-defense; disarmament of
the public under threat of severe

punishment; segregation of
Armenian military recruits into
special labor battalions and
their subsequent executing; and
finally the massacre and de
portation ot between 1.5 and 2
million Armenians. ~
In most instances during the
death marches, the adult male
population was quickly sepa
rated and killed with rifle fire,
bayonets, and axes. The worst
torment, however, was fated for
the women and children, who
were driven for weeks under
blistering heat toward the
deserts. All along the way, they
were confronted by degrada
tion, dehumanization and then
outright slaughter at the hands
of the Turkish soldiers.
Not until months after the de
portations and massacres had
been set in motion did they at
tract sufficient foreign atten
tion to become the subject ot
diplomatic correspondence.
With the world then at war. the
Allied and Associated Powers
made numerous declarations
that, once they had defeated the
"inhuman force" that had au
thored the massacres, the
Armenians would be freed and

restored to their ancestral
lands, whereas the criminals
would be held personally re
sponsible tor the outrage
against humanity. Yet, the poli
tics of expedience soon re
asserted itself, and the Arme
nian survivors, were denied
fulfillment of any of the highly
principled pledges. An embar
rassment in international rela
tions, the Armenian genocide
was relegated by governments
to a dark closet of history. The
"forgotten genocide" had in
fact opened the way for other
similar experiments in the
twentieth century.
Unlike the Armenian case,
the atrocities of World War II
did not pass unrequited, nor
have they been allowed to blur
in public awareness. Historians
and sociologists who have ex
plored the field of victimology
have nonetheless drawn startl
ing parallels between the deci
mation of the Armenian people
and the annihilation of millions
ot Jews and other peoples in Eu
rope during the Nazi regime a
quarter ot a century later.
These include the per
petration of genocide under the
cover of a major international
conflict, thus minimizing the
possibility of external interven
tion; conception of the play by a
monolithic and megalomanic
clique; espousal of an ideology
giving purpose and justification
to intolerance and racism, im
position of strict party dis
cipline and secrecy during the
period of preparation.
In observing April 24 as a re
minder of a man's inhumanity
to man, most Armenians also
approach the day as an occasion
for renewal, rededication and a
subdued celebration of survival.
Although the genocide changed
irreversibly the course of Arme
nian history by dispersing the
few survivors new generations
have managed to become pro
ductive citizens in their various
adopted countries.
Even now, Turkey refuses to
acknowledge or atone to the
Armenian Genocide of 1915, and
the world takes little notice. For
the Armenians, therefore, April
24 represents more than a com
memoration. It is a date that of
fers many lessons and demands
a response: acknowledgement
of the genocide in Turkish gov
ernment and the return of The
Armenian homeland in easter
Anatolia.
