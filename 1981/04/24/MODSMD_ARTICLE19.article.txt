## Left follows self- righteous course 
### 
The most unfortunate aspect of the elec
tion of President Ronald Reagan, with its
concommitant mandate for a more conser
vative approach to national government, is
the opportunity provided the advocates of
liberal policies to beat their breasts (in an
asexual manner, of course, as befits their
enlightened status as sole proponents of sex
ual equality), tear out their hair, and lam
ent the obvious demise of progress, social
and economic justice, and public rock mu
sic. College campuses have found the in
stallation of a conservative government to
be the best excuse for vehement protests
since the Viet Nam War. (The recent pro
pensity for imperialism and genocide on the
part of the North Vietnamese has somewhat
reduced their popularity among the Left in
this country.-)
So, in ivory towers across the nation, the
banners are out, Joan Baez sings tearfully
from the window, Jane Fonda plans her next
visit to victims of brutal capitalist im
perialism, and righteously indignant stu
dents rant of social injustice and pay vast
sums of their parents' blood money for tui
tion."
A little education is a dangerous thing —
sometimes a little more education is even
more dangerous, since it often tends to in
culcate the student with a sense of his or her
own intellectual righteousness by virtue of
four years of sheltered perusal of world af
fairs.
A column in this paper last week lam
ented the fact that the New Right sees all
world conflict as "Us vs. Them." The New
Left seems to view all matters as "Them vs.
Us," with Them always in the right (moral
ly speaking, of course — not politically.)
The Right is continually accused of possess
ing obsolete and unintelligent stands on key
issues, a survey of which will follow.
The draft is needed in this country to im
prove the state of readiness of our armed
forces, which at the moment is poor largely
due to the lack of skilled manpower. Speak
not of conscientious objection — that is a
valid excuse for avoiding military service,
not national service. Speak not of constitu
tional invasion of privacy and involuntary
servitude — The Constitution was not
handed down on stone tablets. Rather, it
was written by Americans for Americans
with the understanding that it would take
much more than the force of its ideological
beauty to survive in an emphatically non
idealistic world. Simply speaking, the Con
stitution would not exist as such without
having been defended by a strong military,
Speak not of freedom to live solely as one
chooses — that freedom has been earned

and must continue to be earned by a limited
sector of the population so that the rest
could enjoy it, and a draft is the most
equitable way to determine who will be in
that limited sector.
Incidentally, an improved state of read
iness does not invite war but deters it, and a
lack of ability to wage conventional war ren
ders more likely the horror of nuclear war.
As'to the environment, the new adminis
tration stands accused of encouraging the
rape of our nation's natural resources
without regard to preservation of beauty or
maintenance of high standards of cleanli
ness. We need energy, and we need to be as
self-sufficient as possible in its generation.
At the moment, and for decades to come,
our only viable sources for mass energy gen
eration involve nuclear, petroleum, and
hydroelectric plants. It is pointless to pro
test the use of those sources without first
making tangible strides toward develop
ment of alternatives.
No one wants to alter the landscape — it is
simply a question of priorities, and the en
vironmental movement has been unwilling
to offer other than negative solutions to
these problems.
Concerning the cuts in social programs,
again, the simplistic interpretation is that
the callous Administration is taking desper
ately needed money out of the hands of the
poor and throwing it to the Pentagon milita
rists. First of all, the focus of the cuts is on
wastage of money, not on the truly helpful
programs. Secondly, the idea that the Fed
eral government is responsible for ensuring
full employment, full stomachs, full tanks
of gasoline, and so on, is not a uniformly ac
cepted concept. The hope is to remove gov
ernment from everyday life insofar as is
possible, except where such centralization
is required, as in ensuring uniform civil
rights, or in national defense, since the use
of scattered militias comprised of local
citizens is technologically and strategically
outmoded. (No offense intended, Liber
tarians.)
U.S. foreign policy is also a point of cur
rent debate, particularly in view of the con
flict in El Salvador. It is true that it would be
best for our country to avoid becoming in
volved in the internal affairs of another, ex
cept of course for providing what agricul
tural and economic aid is practical. The
fighting in El Salvador, however, is not an
internal affair (nor was the fighting in Viet
Nam). The Soviet Union is committed to ex
tending its sphere of influence by whatever
means it finds effective, with the fomenta
tion of revolutionary wars being very help
ful. When playing the game of international

power politics, one must play by the tougher
set of rules no matter how morally objec
tionable they seem to be.
It is hard to understand just why it is that
Marx as modified by Lenin as modified by
Stalin as implemented by Brezhnev seems
to feel that capitalism is doomed to destruc
tion and therefore it is the duty of all good
communists to hasten that end, but that is
unquestionably a guiding policy. Un
deniably the Russians have no right to in
terfere in El Salvador, nor in Poland, nor
did they in Afghanistan or Czechoslovakia
or Hungary, but undeniably they did in
terfere and will continue to do so when it
serves their interests.
We also have no right to interfere, but in
some cases it serves our interests to do so.
The question then becomes one of making a
comparison between interests. We have not
been selfless in our foreign policy, but cer
tainly we have done much more to pro
mulgate political freedom and economic
self-sufficiency than have the Russians.
This survey of current issues is not in
tended to be comprehensive, nor to provide
self-sufficient arguments on each topic. The
intent is to bring home to "liberals" and
"progressives" that they are not dealing
with a mass movement of uninformed, unin
telligent fascists, nor even with corporate
conglomerations of callous capitalists
whose priorities are based on profits. (Even
rightists love alliteration — remember
Spiro Agnew?)
The parochialism of the Left is even more
dangerous than that of the Right, for the
Left believes itself immune to such a condi
tion. Self-proclaimed intellectualism is as
narrow a basis for opinions as is Biblical
fundamentalism. It is also just as self-jus
tifying and just as prone to intolerance, and
even less amenable to introspection.
The election of a new administration is
not a rejection of the goals for which our so
ciety has striven, such as economic prosper
ity, social justice, and international peace,
but a call for a modification of the processes
used to attain those goals. The Left is not the
sole proprietor of idealism, but its criticism
of the Right is based on that premise. It is
not fair to caricature the Left as I did in the
first part of this column (although it is a lot
of fun). But I hope to bring across the point
that the same shallow characterization of
the Right is not seen as unfair merely be
cause it is done by those who count fairness
as one of their virtues.
I suggest that they count again.

was written by Americans for Americans
with the understanding that it would take
much more than the force of its ideological
beauty to survive in an emphatically non
idealistic world. Simply speaking, the Con
stitution would not exist as such without
having been defended by a strong military,
Speak not of freedom to live solely as one
chooses — that freedom has been earned

and must continue to be earned by a limited
sector of the population so that the rest
could enjoy it, and a draft is the most
equitable way to determine who will be in
that limited sector.
Incidentally, an improved state of read
iness does not invite war but deters it, and a
lack of ability to wage conventional war ren
ders more likely the horror of nuclear war.
As'to the environment, the new adminis
tration stands accused of encouraging the
rape of our nation's natural resources
without regard to preservation of beauty or
maintenance of high standards of cleanli
ness. We need energy, and we need to be as
self-sufficient as possible in its generation.
At the moment, and for decades to come,
our only viable sources for mass energy gen
eration involve nuclear, petroleum, and
hydroelectric plants. It is pointless to pro
test the use of those sources without first
making tangible strides toward develop
ment of alternatives.
No one wants to alter the landscape — it is
simply a question of priorities, and the en
vironmental movement has been unwilling
to offer other than negative solutions to
these problems.
Concerning the cuts in social programs,
again, the simplistic interpretation is that
the callous Administration is taking desper
ately needed money out of the hands of the
poor and throwing it to the Pentagon milita
rists. First of all, the focus of the cuts is on
wastage of money, not on the truly helpful
programs. Secondly, the idea that the Fed
eral government is responsible for ensuring
full employment, full stomachs, full tanks
of gasoline, and so on, is not a uniformly ac
cepted concept. The hope is to remove gov
ernment from everyday life insofar as is
possible, except where such centralization
is required, as in ensuring uniform civil
rights, or in national defense, since the use
of scattered militias comprised of local
citizens is technologically and strategically
outmoded. (No offense intended, Liber
tarians.)
U.S. foreign policy is also a point of cur
rent debate, particularly in view of the con
flict in El Salvador. It is true that it would be
best for our country to avoid becoming in
volved in the internal affairs of another, ex
cept of course for providing what agricul
tural and economic aid is practical. The
fighting in El Salvador, however, is not an
internal affair (nor was the fighting in Viet
Nam). The Soviet Union is committed to ex
tending its sphere of influence by whatever
means it finds effective, with the fomenta
tion of revolutionary wars being very help
ful. When playing the game of international

power politics, one must play by the tougher
set of rules no matter how morally objec
tionable they seem to be.
It is hard to understand just why it is that
Marx as modified by Lenin as modified by
Stalin as implemented by Brezhnev seems
to feel that capitalism is doomed to destruc
tion and therefore it is the duty of all good
communists to hasten that end, but that is
unquestionably a guiding policy. Un
deniably the Russians have no right to in
terfere in El Salvador, nor in Poland, nor
did they in Afghanistan or Czechoslovakia
or Hungary, but undeniably they did in
terfere and will continue to do so when it
serves their interests.
We also have no right to interfere, but in
some cases it serves our interests to do so.
The question then becomes one of making a
comparison between interests. We have not
been selfless in our foreign policy, but cer
tainly we have done much more to pro
mulgate political freedom and economic
self-sufficiency than have the Russians.
This survey of current issues is not in
tended to be comprehensive, nor to provide
self-sufficient arguments on each topic. The
intent is to bring home to "liberals" and
"progressives" that they are not dealing
with a mass movement of uninformed, unin
telligent fascists, nor even with corporate
conglomerations of callous capitalists
whose priorities are based on profits. (Even
rightists love alliteration — remember
Spiro Agnew?)
The parochialism of the Left is even more
dangerous than that of the Right, for the
Left believes itself immune to such a condi
tion. Self-proclaimed intellectualism is as
narrow a basis for opinions as is Biblical
fundamentalism. It is also just as self-jus
tifying and just as prone to intolerance, and
even less amenable to introspection.
The election of a new administration is
not a rejection of the goals for which our so
ciety has striven, such as economic prosper
ity, social justice, and international peace,
but a call for a modification of the processes
used to attain those goals. The Left is not the
sole proprietor of idealism, but its criticism
of the Right is based on that premise. It is
not fair to caricature the Left as I did in the
first part of this column (although it is a lot
of fun). But I hope to bring across the point
that the same shallow characterization of
the Right is not seen as unfair merely be
cause it is done by those who count fairness
as one of their virtues.
I suggest that they count again.

rights, or in national defense, since the use
of scattered militias comprised of local
citizens is technologically and strategically
outmoded. (No offense intended, Liber
tarians.)
U.S. foreign policy is also a point of cur
rent debate, particularly in view of the con
flict in El Salvador. It is true that it would be
best for our country to avoid becoming in
volved in the internal affairs of another, ex
cept of course for providing what agricul
tural and economic aid is practical. The
fighting in El Salvador, however, is not an
internal affair (nor was the fighting in Viet
Nam). The Soviet Union is committed to ex
tending its sphere of influence by whatever
means it finds effective, with the fomenta
tion of revolutionary wars being very help
ful. When playing the game of international

power politics, one must play by the tougher
set of rules no matter how morally objec
tionable they seem to be.
It is hard to understand just why it is that
Marx as modified by Lenin as modified by
Stalin as implemented by Brezhnev seems
to feel that capitalism is doomed to destruc
tion and therefore it is the duty of all good
communists to hasten that end, but that is
unquestionably a guiding policy. Un
deniably the Russians have no right to in
terfere in El Salvador, nor in Poland, nor
did they in Afghanistan or Czechoslovakia
or Hungary, but undeniably they did in
terfere and will continue to do so when it
serves their interests.
We also have no right to interfere, but in
some cases it serves our interests to do so.
The question then becomes one of making a
comparison between interests. We have not
been selfless in our foreign policy, but cer
tainly we have done much more to pro
mulgate political freedom and economic
self-sufficiency than have the Russians.
This survey of current issues is not in
tended to be comprehensive, nor to provide
self-sufficient arguments on each topic. The
intent is to bring home to "liberals" and
"progressives" that they are not dealing
with a mass movement of uninformed, unin
telligent fascists, nor even with corporate
conglomerations of callous capitalists
whose priorities are based on profits. (Even
rightists love alliteration — remember
Spiro Agnew?)
The parochialism of the Left is even more
dangerous than that of the Right, for the
Left believes itself immune to such a condi
tion. Self-proclaimed intellectualism is as
narrow a basis for opinions as is Biblical
fundamentalism. It is also just as self-jus
tifying and just as prone to intolerance, and
even less amenable to introspection.
The election of a new administration is
not a rejection of the goals for which our so
ciety has striven, such as economic prosper
ity, social justice, and international peace,
but a call for a modification of the processes
used to attain those goals. The Left is not the
sole proprietor of idealism, but its criticism
of the Right is based on that premise. It is
not fair to caricature the Left as I did in the
first part of this column (although it is a lot
of fun). But I hope to bring across the point
that the same shallow characterization of
the Right is not seen as unfair merely be
cause it is done by those who count fairness
as one of their virtues.
I suggest that they count again.
