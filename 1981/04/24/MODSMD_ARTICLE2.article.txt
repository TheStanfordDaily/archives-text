After boasting sign-up and waiting
lists totalling 576 students, John An
derson's lecture class, "Transition in
Congress," is running considerably
below its initial enrollment.
The registrar's mid-term class
lists, which came out this week, listed
293 students as taking the class for

lectures were disjointed, unclear and

Rich Visek, a junior in the class. "The
expectations were too high A lot of
people expected him to walk on wa

Many who attended the first lec

derson or disappointed that the class
was one about Congress — not one
about John Anderson, filled with anec
dotes about the 1980 presidential cam
paign.
"A lot of people went there because
they wanted to see Anderson," said
senior Steve Mitchell. "They didn't go
for the subject matter. I like the class
because I'm interested in what he's
talking about But when his political
