# Students drop Anderson's course
## 
### Mike Oneal 
After boasting sign-up and waiting
lists totalling 576 students, John An
derson's lecture class, "Transition in
Congress," is running considerably
below its initial enrollment.
The registrar's mid-term class
lists, which came out this week, listed
293 students as taking the class for
credit.
The drop in enrollment comes as
somewhat of a surprise after the ex
citement and publicity generated by
the class when it was announced last
quarter — even considering the natu
ral attrition which affects most lec
ture classes.
But a combination of occurrences —
a slow start by Anderson and a dissipa
tion of the mystique surrounding the

course — has led to declining interest.
"It just didn't turn out to be ev
erything it was supposed to be," said
freshman Becky Williams, who
dropped the class yesterday.
According to Paul Karps, head TA
and organizer of the course, a number
of the original 576 who signed up
missed the mandatory organizational
class at the beginning of the quarter
because the room and day were
changed. That — combined with stu
dents on the waiting list who decided
to stop waiting and others on the class
list who dropped the course tor anoth
er — diminished enrollment.
The first two Anderson lectures
caused more students to drop Most
persons in the course agree that those
lectures were disjointed, unclear and

somewhat boring
"He had to get his feet wet," said
Rich Visek, a junior in the class. "The
expectations were too high A lot of
people expected him to walk on wa
ter," he added.
Many who attended the first lec
tures were either disappointed in An
derson or disappointed that the class
was one about Congress — not one
about John Anderson, filled with anec
dotes about the 1980 presidential cam
paign.
"A lot of people went there because
they wanted to see Anderson," said
senior Steve Mitchell. "They didn't go
for the subject matter. I like the class
because I'm interested in what he's
talking about But when his political
side comes out, that's what people
want to hear. The class perks right up
when he gets on Reagan and Carter."
Anderson's shaky start, according
to many, has reversed itself. One stu
dent commented that the difference
between the first week of the lecture
and the third has been like "night and
day."
The Political Science Department,
which sponsors the class, also is hap
pier with the course's progress.
"It would be great if we had a lec
turer the caliber of (Political Science
Prof.) David Danelski up there," said
Karps, "but then he wouldn't be John
Anderson, would he? It's damn hard to
get up and lecture, especially at Stan
ford. He (Anderson) has just had to
get used to it."
Tod Bergstrom, one of three
freshmen representatives on the
ASSU Guest Professorship Board,
elaborated.
"The point of the board is to bring in
people from the real world. You can't
expect them to be great lecturers

right away," he said.
According to Assoc. Political Sci
ence Prof . David Abernethy, head of
undergraduate studies in the depart
ment, the class was designed to be
fairly intensive, and this, he said, may
have scared some students off.
The department was interested in
discouraging students who were look
ing for an easy course with a presiden
tial candidate as lecturer. Conse
quently, the course requires a lot of
reading, mandatory section atten
dance, and two hours of lecture.
Furthermore, it is worth only three
units.
The group in charge wanted to make
it challenging despite its popularity.
"We're not interested in numbers tor
their own sake," Danelski said.
Compared to other public figures
who have been guest professors at
Stanford, Anderson has drawn quite
well. Daniel Ellsberg who lectured
here two years ago, had only 158 stu
dents, and Angela Davis, who lectured
in 1975, ended up with about 100 stu
dents, after starting with 1000.

right away," he said.
According to Assoc. Political Sci
ence Prof . David Abernethy, head of
undergraduate studies in the depart
ment, the class was designed to be
fairly intensive, and this, he said, may
have scared some students off.
The department was interested in
discouraging students who were look
ing for an easy course with a presiden
tial candidate as lecturer. Conse
quently, the course requires a lot of
reading, mandatory section atten
dance, and two hours of lecture.
Furthermore, it is worth only three
units.
The group in charge wanted to make
it challenging despite its popularity.
"We're not interested in numbers tor
their own sake," Danelski said.
Compared to other public figures
who have been guest professors at
Stanford, Anderson has drawn quite
well. Daniel Ellsberg who lectured
here two years ago, had only 158 stu
dents, and Angela Davis, who lectured
in 1975, ended up with about 100 stu
dents, after starting with 1000.
After boasting sign-up and waiting
lists totalling 576 students, John An
derson's lecture class, "Transition in
Congress," is running considerably
below its initial enrollment.
The registrar's mid-term class
lists, which came out this week, listed
293 students as taking the class for
credit.
The drop in enrollment comes as
somewhat of a surprise after the ex
citement and publicity generated by
the class when it was announced last
quarter — even considering the natu
ral attrition which affects most lec
ture classes.
But a combination of occurrences —
a slow start by Anderson and a dissipa
tion of the mystique surrounding the

course — has led to declining interest.
"It just didn't turn out to be ev
erything it was supposed to be," said
freshman Becky Williams, who
dropped the class yesterday.
According to Paul Karps, head TA
and organizer of the course, a number
of the original 576 who signed up
missed the mandatory organizational
class at the beginning of the quarter
because the room and day were
changed. That — combined with stu
dents on the waiting list who decided
to stop waiting and others on the class
list who dropped the course tor anoth
er — diminished enrollment.
The first two Anderson lectures
caused more students to drop Most
persons in the course agree that those
lectures were disjointed, unclear and

somewhat boring
"He had to get his feet wet," said
Rich Visek, a junior in the class. "The
expectations were too high A lot of
people expected him to walk on wa
ter," he added.
Many who attended the first lec
tures were either disappointed in An
derson or disappointed that the class
was one about Congress — not one
about John Anderson, filled with anec
dotes about the 1980 presidential cam
paign.
"A lot of people went there because
they wanted to see Anderson," said
senior Steve Mitchell. "They didn't go
for the subject matter. I like the class
because I'm interested in what he's
talking about But when his political
side comes out, that's what people
want to hear. The class perks right up
when he gets on Reagan and Carter."
Anderson's shaky start, according
to many, has reversed itself. One stu
dent commented that the difference
between the first week of the lecture
and the third has been like "night and
day."
The Political Science Department,
which sponsors the class, also is hap
pier with the course's progress.
"It would be great if we had a lec
turer the caliber of (Political Science
Prof.) David Danelski up there," said
Karps, "but then he wouldn't be John
Anderson, would he? It's damn hard to
get up and lecture, especially at Stan
ford. He (Anderson) has just had to
get used to it."
Tod Bergstrom, one of three
freshmen representatives on the
ASSU Guest Professorship Board,
elaborated.
"The point of the board is to bring in
people from the real world. You can't
expect them to be great lecturers

right away," he said.
