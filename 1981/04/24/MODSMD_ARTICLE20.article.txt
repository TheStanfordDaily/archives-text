Salaries 'earned'
On April 20 the 6 p.m. news on
KPIX aired a story about Na
tional Secretaries' Week that
resembled a campaign com
mercial for USE/LOCAL
S.E.I.U. One person was pro
union because she believes the
secretaries would become more
"professional."
Professionals such as doctors
and lawyers are not unionized.
After years of rigorous school
ing and training they earn high
salaries for services requiring
highly specialized skills. They
are professionals because they
conduct themselves in a pro
fessional manner. They devote
themselves to the services they
agreed to perform with high
standards or ethics. Their high
salaries are earned, not nego
tiated through union contracts.

New hearing
This is to express my disap
proval regarding the hearing in
the case of Rita Mazon, Office of
Development versus the Uni
versity.
The hearing should never
have been heard by John Hayes
or any member of the Office of
Development, but rather by an
entirely disinterested unpre
judiced person.
I personally feel Rita Mazon
is entitled to another hearing by
an entirely different panel and.
hopefully, the decision will be as
it should be — in favor of Rita
Mazon.

As an exempt employee I am
not involved with the fight for
unionization within the Univer
sity's clerical forces, but after
seeing such unfair decision
handed down as in the Mazon
case, no wonder unionization is
wanted by employees.
I've known Rita for ten years
and have always found her to be
a most conscientious and coop
erative worker and, I might add,
at the present time the only em
ployee in Gift Processing with a
true knowledge and background
of the department.
Let's give her a fair and fight
ing chance! If Rita gets that,
she'll win. Here's to you, Rita.

is apparently under the misap
prehension that graduate stu
dents do not work. I wonder how
many of the jobs she draws our
attention to in the San Jose
Mercury involve working seven
days a week, often in long shifts
late into the night.
Schedules such as these leave
little room for work-study jobs,
and stopping out for a few years
to earn money constitutes a
damaging break in the continui
ty of one's studies.
Students in the hard sciences
are the fortunate ones, earning
between $400 and $SOO a month.
In the social sciences most
graduate students are paid
somewhat less, and after sub
tracting off half this amount to

cover rent, it is clear that there
is little left over to cover food
and other essentials.
This wage compares badly
with jobs in industry involving
equivalent skill and prepara
tion. Yet we do not expect to be
paid an industrial wage — all
most of us ask is that we be paid
enough to allow us to be inde
pendent of external sources of
money. It would also be nice if
graduate study was recognized
as a job in its own right, rather
than something people do be
cause they want to party for a
few more years.
Finally, there is a very real
danger that if the University al
lows its pay scale to get de
valued any further, only people
with private means will be able
to go to graduate school. This
would drive many very talented
students onto those self-same
employment pages in the Sun
day Mercury. In my opinion this
would be a great tragedy for our
school.
Perhaps Stanford is an ivory
tower, but if it is, it is one where
most people work very hard to
keep it that way.

It was with the utmost regret
that my husband and I found he
could not visit your Museum last
Tuesday because he is confined
to a wheelchair. When we
called, we were led to believe
that he could at least visit the

first /loor, which he was most
interested in because it contains
the Rodin collection, which the
Museum spokesperson in
dicated was open. When we ar
rived with our party, we found
we were misled on both counts,
so my husband and I sat outside
while our companions visited
the museum, minus the Rodin
collection which was closed.
It is my opinion that the Stan
ford Museum is one of the best
and most interesting museums
in the Bay Area, and has con
tinued to maintain its reputa
tion and to upgrade itself
through the knowledge and sup
port of its many patrons and the
Committee of Art. Considering
such a standard, I find it appall
ing that, with the continued ac
quisitions of so many fine
pieces, you have not upgraded
this building in other areas,
such as rewiring and installing
an outside elevator which would
make all floors accessible.
I realize you are a private uni
versity and very possibly do not
receive state and/or federal
funding, and therefore are not
obligated to provide such a ser
vice, but I feel you should con
sider it in your best interests to
do so. in the name of humanity.

On April 20 the 6 p.m. news on
KPIX aired a story about Na
tional Secretaries' Week that
resembled a campaign com
mercial for USE/LOCAL
S.E.I.U. One person was pro
union because she believes the
secretaries would become more
"professional."
Professionals such as doctors
and lawyers are not unionized.
After years of rigorous school
ing and training they earn high
salaries for services requiring
highly specialized skills. They
are professionals because they
conduct themselves in a pro
fessional manner. They devote
themselves to the services they
agreed to perform with high
standards or ethics. Their high
salaries are earned, not nego
tiated through union contracts.

New hearing
This is to express my disap
proval regarding the hearing in
the case of Rita Mazon, Office of
Development versus the Uni
versity.
The hearing should never
have been heard by John Hayes
or any member of the Office of
Development, but rather by an
entirely disinterested unpre
judiced person.
I personally feel Rita Mazon
is entitled to another hearing by
an entirely different panel and.
hopefully, the decision will be as
it should be — in favor of Rita
Mazon.

As an exempt employee I am
not involved with the fight for
unionization within the Univer
sity's clerical forces, but after
seeing such unfair decision
handed down as in the Mazon
case, no wonder unionization is
wanted by employees.
I've known Rita for ten years
and have always found her to be
a most conscientious and coop
erative worker and, I might add,
at the present time the only em
ployee in Gift Processing with a
true knowledge and background
of the department.
Let's give her a fair and fight
ing chance! If Rita gets that,
she'll win. Here's to you, Rita.

is apparently under the misap
prehension that graduate stu
dents do not work. I wonder how
many of the jobs she draws our
attention to in the San Jose
Mercury involve working seven
days a week, often in long shifts
late into the night.
Schedules such as these leave
little room for work-study jobs,
and stopping out for a few years
to earn money constitutes a
damaging break in the continui
ty of one's studies.
Students in the hard sciences
are the fortunate ones, earning
between $400 and $SOO a month.
In the social sciences most
graduate students are paid
somewhat less, and after sub
tracting off half this amount to

cover rent, it is clear that there
is little left over to cover food
and other essentials.
This wage compares badly
with jobs in industry involving
equivalent skill and prepara
tion. Yet we do not expect to be
paid an industrial wage — all
most of us ask is that we be paid
enough to allow us to be inde
pendent of external sources of
money. It would also be nice if
graduate study was recognized
as a job in its own right, rather
than something people do be
cause they want to party for a
few more years.
Finally, there is a very real
danger that if the University al
lows its pay scale to get de
valued any further, only people
with private means will be able
to go to graduate school. This
would drive many very talented
students onto those self-same
employment pages in the Sun
day Mercury. In my opinion this
would be a great tragedy for our
school.
Perhaps Stanford is an ivory
tower, but if it is, it is one where
most people work very hard to
keep it that way.

Wheelchair access
It was with the utmost regret
that my husband and I found he
could not visit your Museum last
Tuesday because he is confined
to a wheelchair. When we
called, we were led to believe
that he could at least visit the

first /loor, which he was most
interested in because it contains
the Rodin collection, which the
Museum spokesperson in
dicated was open. When we ar
rived with our party, we found
we were misled on both counts,
so my husband and I sat outside
while our companions visited
the museum, minus the Rodin
collection which was closed.
It is my opinion that the Stan
ford Museum is one of the best
and most interesting museums
in the Bay Area, and has con
tinued to maintain its reputa
tion and to upgrade itself
through the knowledge and sup
port of its many patrons and the
Committee of Art. Considering
such a standard, I find it appall
ing that, with the continued ac
quisitions of so many fine
pieces, you have not upgraded
this building in other areas,
such as rewiring and installing
an outside elevator which would
make all floors accessible.
I realize you are a private uni
versity and very possibly do not
receive state and/or federal
funding, and therefore are not
obligated to provide such a ser
vice, but I feel you should con
sider it in your best interests to
do so. in the name of humanity.
