## Bright prospects for '81 Gridders sign top recruits 
### Sally Jenkins 
Cardinal football coach Paul
Wiggin cornered the great soun
ding name department when he
signed his high school recruits
this year. Whether his choices
are as classy as their names re
flect remains to be seen.
However there are those who
think that a great sounding
name can't hurt if you want to
be a great football player. Milt
Plum, for instance, never be
came a great quarterback. Fran
Tarkenton and Joe Namath did.
Wiggin grabbed eight All-
Americas, of the total 17 high
school seniors who signed let
ters of intent on February 18 to
attend Stanford next fall. Not a
single one has an average name.
Start with Garrin Veris. He is
the best athlete of the group,
earning Parade, Football News,
and National Coaches All Amer
ica honors as a tight end, and de
fensive end. At 6-foot-6, 240
pounds, he isn't afraid if he
hears the footsteps behind him
when he goes for the ball.
He caught 16 passes for 276
yards and two touchdowns last
season, and made 61 tackles.
That's despite missing the first
four games with a broken ankle.
He also starred on the basket
ball team in Chillicothe, Ohio,
averaging 22 rebounds and 19
points per game. He won the
state shot put and discus as a
junior. "He is a great player, a
great athlete. You wouldn't be
lieve it if you saw him," said

Wiggin.
Shaun Avant is a fullback
from Ontario, California. "He
represents the best of what we
have coming next year/' said
Wiggin. Avant had 1000 yards ofl
the ground both his junior and
senior years. "A player like
Avant was a priority with Dar
rin Nelson leaving, and Vincent
White becoming a junior," Wig
gin continued.
These kids are multiple
players, they are great re
ceivers, and good blockers as
well. It's so rare that you can
find players like that. You get
spoiled by those kinds of kids."
Avant is 5-11, 200 pounds.
Emile Harry represents the
great receiving hope of the new
kids in town. He is from Foun
tain Valley,Cal., stands a flat six
feet tall, weighs an even 175
pounds. He was the C.I.F.
Division 1 Player of the Year in
Southern California, snagging
52 passes for 1041 yards, and 12
touchdowns.
"He is a better receiver than
(Ken) Margerum was at this
stage of his career." said Foun
tain Valley coach Mike Milner,
who also coached Margerum
once upon a time.
The fight over Margerum's
now vacant position will be be
tween juniors Mike Tolliver and
Don Lonsinger. However, Wig
gin said "Don't count Harry out.
He is highly skilled young man.
Style-wise he resembles Andre
Tyler (starting flanker, senior)

more than he does Margerum."
Quarterback John Elway is
about to learn, at a very young
age, what it's like to look over
your shoulder. Incoming
freshman Fred Buckley was the
no. 1 and most highly recruited
high school quarterback in the
nation last year, just as Elway
was three years ago. The 6-2,190
pounder was twice named All-
America by Parade, once by
Football News and The Catholic
League. From Ft. Lauderdale
Florida, he completed 59 per
cent of his passes for 1956 yards
and 19 touchdowns. In his three
year career, he completed 4714
for 44 touchdowns.
Believe it or not, the em
phasis was on offensive and de
fensive linemen this year. Of the
eight All-America's, four were
linemen: defensive tackle
Terry Jackson (Washington
D.C.), offensive tackle John
Barnes (Dallas, Texas), center
Brent Martin (Madera), and
and linebacker Matt Soderlund
(Boise, Idaho).
Jackson and Barnes seem to
represent the best of that group.
The 6-7, 260 pounder racked up
103 tackles and 18 sacks in 10
games, and was named All-
America by The National Catho
lic League and The National
Coaches Association. Regarded
as the best offensive lineman in
the state of Texas, Barnes is 6-6.
There they are, America's
youth. Where do we get such
men?
