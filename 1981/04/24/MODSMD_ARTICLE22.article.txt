# Travel to Arizona this weekend
## Diamonders to face Cats 
### Ralph Walker 
When asked if the fans at Wildcat Stadium were
a little on the incongenial side, University of Ari
zona baseball coach Jerry Kendall replied,
"That's the nicest thing anybody has said about
them in a long time.''
But the Stanford baseball team has a lot more to
worry about this weekend than escaping alive
from the some 4000 Arizona fans that help to make
Candlestick Park look like a playground. The
Cardinals will also be struggling to stay alive in
the race for second place in the Southern Division
of the Pac-10.
Arizona (11-10) is currently in second place in
the SixPac, two games ahead of the fourth place
Cards. According to Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess, his team will probably have to win at least
six of their remaining nine games to harness a
second place finish and qualify for a playoff berth
in the Western Regionals. So, it is almost im
perative that the Cards win at least twice this
weekend in their three-game series with Arizona,
that starts today and runs through Sunday.
"Everything revolves around the pitching," as
serted Marquess, whose staff walked 23 batters
last weekend against UCLA. "We're going to
score runs," he maintained, "and if we can put the
ball over the plate, we have a good shot at sec
ond."
The absence of junior hurler Brian Mignano
(most likely out for the season with a bad elbow),
and periodic injuires to other moundsmen has
forced Marquess to manipulate his starting rota
tion. He has been throwing freshmen Brian
Myers, Steve Cottrell, and Gregg Lomnicky for
three innings each in the first and third games of
recent series, but may deviate from this strategy
against the Wildcats.

"We don't want to lock ourselves into a situ
ation," said Marquess. "We feel that if Myers is
throwing really well on Friday night, we'd stay
with him and go with (Paul) Grame on Saturday
and Cottrell on Sunday."
The experience of junior Mike Sullivan may
prove to be invaluable. Sullivan has lately been
the Cards' most dependable hurler and may see a
lot of action out of the bullpen if the evils of youth
have their way with Myers, Cottrell, and Lom
nicky.
The Cards have their work cut out for them. The
Wildcats, according to Kendall, have improved
since Stanford took two out of three games in their
previous series at Sunken Diamond. And, of
course, Arizona will be playing at home.
"Our fans really give us a boost," said Kendall.
"There is a small group that is causing a lot of
trouble and we're ashamed of it. We don't want
vulgarity and bottle-throwing and we're trying to
see that they are removed. All in all, we do have a
home field advantage. Our fans are very en
thusiastic."
Kendall has also enjoyed watching the improve
ment of his pitching staff.
"Our pitching is a little better," he said, in ref
erence to when the 'Cats last tangled with the
Cards. "Two of the pitchers we weren't counting
on two and one-half months ago (Dan Powers and
Rich Lucero) have been doing real well lately."
Powers and Lucero will complement one of the
league's better hurlers, sophomore Ed Vosberg
(7-2, 3.86) who beat Stanford 9-4 earlier this year.
"We're where we want to be," said Kendall.
"Our destiny is in our own hands and that's how
we want it. We can't ask for anything more."
Except maybe for a SWAT team in the stands.
