## Mascot: no Cardinals thank you 
### Sally Jenkins 
We have stomped on, run roughshod over, and kicked
around the mascot issue for some time now. When it did not
appear on the ballot this past student-election many of us
thought it had disappeared forever.
Beware. It is merely lying dormant in the corners of our
minds, bleeding and half-dead to the naked eye perhaps, but
with its vital signs still deceptively strong. All it needs to re
awaken in a storm of fury is one word. Indians.
Well, I said it. I'll say it again, too. Indians What, after all,
is so terribly wrong with the notion of using a nation of people
as a symbol of courage, nobility, and sportsmanship? Some
might consider it a compliment.
The Stanford administration has its own word whenever
the issue crops up. Cardinals. An all encompassing sense of
apathy sweeps the campus and surrounding community when
it is mentioned. Our voices sink into unintelligible murmurs,
our hands, previously waving in anger, fall harmlessly to our
sides.
No self-respecting student likes to buckle under to the ad
ministration, but do we really have a choice? We are pow
erless, handcuffed by incredible and overwhelming boredom.
When we hear the word Cardinals we feel the strength being
sapped out of us, we barely have the strength to hoarsely
whisper one phrase: "Who cares?"
It is, of course, a ploy by the administration to keep us
quiet. After all, what do we really know about the term
"Cardinals 0 " What does it mean? v '
Do they mean the bird kind of Cardinal, and if so, what does
it look like? Nobody has ever actually seen a picture of a
Cardinal. Do they mean the color? What color is Cardinal, is it
closer to maroon, or red, and what shade? And why, if we are
indeed the C ardinals, has the administration left the two stat
ues of Griftons-Griffens-Gryphons standing outside of the
athletic building? Nobody knows what a Gryphon-Griffen-
Griffon is either.
It is a very clever and insidious tactic, designed to per
manently confuse us, and bore us so utterly that we can't find
it in our hearts to fight back.
No self-respecting student likes to buckle under pressure
from the alumni, either. "Indians," however, remains the
only clearcut answer, the only viable alternative that conveys
a sense of pride and dignity.
Actually, there might be one more. There's this pro football
team down in Los Angeles, they call themselves the "Tro
jans. No college team has ever used that one before, and we
could do all kinds of neat things with it. We could dress the
band in cool outfits with swords and helmets, and put a guy in
a skirt on a white horse and let him ride around the field.

Sneaker-to-Sneaker is a commentary written by sports edi
tors Steve Odell and Sally Jenkins. Each week we debate a
different controversial issue in sports, usually one conerning
the Stanford community.
This week's issue is the highly original one of deciding on a
Stanford mascot.
By Steve Odell
Remember when you were in junior high and you had to
write a paper for health class? And you'd always start out
your paper the same way?
"According to Merriam & Webster, athlete's foot is. . .
Just when you thought you were above all that, here I am,
starting out my Sneaker to Sneaker with, "according to Mer
riam and Webster, a gryphon is a fabulous beast with the
wings of an eagle, and the body of a lion.' "
But why not? It fits my purpose. The mascot issue is one
which has been troubling this campus for a long time now,
ever since the Cardinals was chosen instead of the Indian.
Everyone wants a solution. And the Gryphons is the answer.
Sounds great, doesn't it? The Lions from Detroit and the
Eagles from Philadelphia all rolled up into one mascot.
And Merriam and Webster must have been pretty cool
guys, considering they wrote dictionaries for a living. Even
they recognized the gryphon as a "fabulous beast."
Lions are strong and agile, and eagles are proud and have
the power of flight. Sounds like a regular superhero. Plus
gryphons has got a little class. Which is more than I can say
for some of our other suggested mascots.
The proposal for Trees as our mascot is not only a joke, but
it is one which can be cut down rather easily.
As for the Indians, there's the obvious moral and racial is
sue at hand. (Would you want to be called the Stanford
Guatemalans?)
The Gryphons were meant to be our mascot, as witnessed
by the statues outside the front of the Athletic Department.
Why let them go to waste?
And what's with the current mascot, the Cardinals? What
are we supposed to put on our uniforms, little red Crayolas?
Gryphons is an original name, also. It fits the unique Stan
ford community perfectly. Plus, it doesn't offend anyone.
Besides, can you imagine a gryphon swooping down from
the rafters of Maples Pavilion and beating the crap out of the
Cal Bear?
