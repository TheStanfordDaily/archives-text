# Spikers lose to Hawaii, end season tonight

The Stanford men's volleyball
team lost to the University of
Hawaii Wednesday night, in
three straight games as usual.
The Cardinals have been out
sized, outmanned, and out
played all season long. They will
face Loyola-Marymount tonight
at Maples Pavilion, the last
game on what turned out to be a
very difficult schedule.
The University of Hawaii was
supposed to be one of those
teams the Cardinals could play
well against. "Of all the people
we play, they are the team that
most resembles our style of
play." said coach Fred Sturm,
before the match. "If we ex
ecute and play our game we will
be sucessful," he concluded.
The game was taped by
ESPN, a cable sports network,
and will be televised nationally
sometime next week. That fact
may have contributed to the
Cardinals poor performance, as
they lost 15-5, 15-9,15-12.
Inconsistency has plagued the

team and players, with few ex
ceptions, all season long. This
match was no different. "There
wasn't a real good effort by any
one," said assistant coach Don
Shaw. "It seemed like everyone
took turns making mistakes, it
changed hands. Five people
would be playing alright, but
one guy would start making mis
takes. It was not a good team ef
fort."
Shaw did cite Kip Engen as
one player who managed to put
together a fairly consistent per
formance.
The Cardinals found them
selves at an immediate disad
vantage when outside hitter
Steve Saeta began feeling ill
only moments into the match.
Saeta is a freshman, and one of
the season-long consistent per
formers on the team. He left the
match halfway through the first
game with a case of food poison
ing, and had not returned to the
team as of practice-time yester
day afternoon.
