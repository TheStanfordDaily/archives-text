## NBA playoffs no tourney of champs this year 
### 
Magic Johnson is getting an-
noyed. "C'mon Kareem, it's
• name time!. . .Where's thepop
corn?" „ .
"Chill out, E.J.," growls Ab
- dul-Jabbar, his game face firm-
ly in place. "You'll get your
grub as soon as D.J. comes up
mine. Hey Dennis, my hot
vdogs ready yet?"
; "Sorry Big Guy," Dennis
■» Johnson mutters from the kitch
en. "I can't help it if Truck's
playing much tougher defense
* on your hot dog buns than he
ever did on Reggie K ng."
"Quiet," roars Le< nard Rob
inson (who is actually playing a
zone on the rolls). ->u all bet
ter keep it in your pants 'cause
you're not getting no hing till
; Ice brings me my ice tta."
"Your ice tea!.,' snaps
George Gervin, fresh out of the
men's room. "Damn T/uck, you
already got 220 ppunds of ice tea
ion you. You. don't need any
J more. Besides, Marques prom
'* ised me some pretzels."

Marques Johnson just shakes
his head "Get serious, guys;
it's game time."
And with that he flicks on the
television set.
The above is fiction. That's no
surprise. What is a surprise,
however, is the final four of pro
fessional basketball. Sure, even
your resident fellow could've
told you that the Boston Celtics
(62-20 in the NBA s 24-week pre
season) and the Philadelphia
76ers (also 62-20) would still be
in action at this time of the year.
But the Houston Rockets
(40-42)? or — perish the
thought! — the Kansas City
Kings (40-42)? Is that basketball
or mud wrestling?
And say Magic, Marques.
Kareem et al are tube-side this
weekend. How do you think
they're going to feel, watching
two hours plus of Ernie Grun
feld posting up on Alan Leavell?
Undoubtedly, they will end up
feeling like the rest of us —

dazed, confused, and cheated.
Here's what wasn't supposed
to happen (and what did):
Houston's unheradled Bill
"Poodle"' Willoughby wasn't
supposed to snuff Kareem's
dreaded sky hook with the open
ing game on the line. But three
weeks ago, he did just that. The
Rockets' relentless Moses
Malone wasn't supposed to eat
the Lakers alive on their Forum
Blue Floor. But all season he
did Earvin (Magic) Johnson
wasn't supposed to cast up that
rock with the Laker's entire sea
son dangling in the balance But
he did.
And then there's the Phoenix
Suns — the archetypical regular
season terror post-season patsy
outfit. Having won 57 games,
the Suns weren't supposed to
fold up against crippled Kansas
City (especially when Otis
Birdsong joiqed fellow all-star
guard Phil Ford on the Kings'
injured list la e in game one).
But you can guess the rest.

Kansas City-Houston was
supposed to be the inside joke at
CBS Sports. But who's laughing
now?
All is not lost though. Even as
K.C.-Houston is a crime against
nature, there's still the Celtics
versus the Sixers in the Eastern
finals. And the Celts are the pick
here to bring some order back to
the NBA, first by putting away

resourcetul Houston in a six
game tiff Since both series are
presently deadlocked at one-all
(with Philly and Houston enjoy
ing home court edges), these
predictions are not giveaways.
Boston vs. Philadelphia
The Celtics and Sixers are oh
so similar Both teams are big,
deep, and poised. And both play
great defense. Last April, Dr. J

and friends :auf at Boston at the
wrong time jf tJ e month and ran
the Celts out in five games. The
opposite nay happen this year
Seven-fot t Rol ert Parrish has
been a re/elation for the Celts,
and he, Lr.rry Bird, Tiny
Archibald, and rookie Kevin
McHale have all been devastat
ing down the stretch Cham
pionship banner number twelve
should be hinging in the Boston
Garden next month.
Kansas City vs. Houston
, The Branniff series. And a
real snoozer. The keys in this
fray are Rocket center Moses
Malone and King forward Reg

gie King In game one. Moses
was unstoppable and Houston
romped by 19 points. Wednesday
night. King returned the favor,
dropping 31 points on the Rock
ets as Kansas City coasted 88-79.
While the Kings are as de
termined as they come, they are
also pitifully slow. Take Moses
and company to strip Cin
derella's garb in six games.
That's when the fun ends. Hous
ton and Kansas City combined
could not beat either of the
Eastern finalists. But then
again, I thought Phoenix would
still be playing.

■» Johnson mutters from the kitch
en. "I can't help it if Truck's
playing much tougher defense

ever did on Reggie K ng."
"Quiet," roars Le< nard Rob

zone on the rolls). ->u all bet

"Your ice tea!.,' snaps
George Gervin, fresh out of the
men's room. "Damn T/uck, you
already got 220 ppunds of ice tea
ion you. You. don't need any
J more. Besides, Marques prom
'* ised me some pretzels."

Marques Johnson just shakes
his head "Get serious, guys;
it's game time."
And with that he flicks on the
television set.
The above is fiction. That's no
surprise. What is a surprise,
however, is the final four of pro
fessional basketball. Sure, even
your resident fellow could've
told you that the Boston Celtics
(62-20 in the NBA s 24-week pre
season) and the Philadelphia
76ers (also 62-20) would still be
in action at this time of the year.
But the Houston Rockets
(40-42)? or — perish the
thought! — the Kansas City
Kings (40-42)? Is that basketball
or mud wrestling?
And say Magic, Marques.
Kareem et al are tube-side this
weekend. How do you think
they're going to feel, watching
two hours plus of Ernie Grun
feld posting up on Alan Leavell?
Undoubtedly, they will end up
feeling like the rest of us —

dazed, confused, and cheated.
Here's what wasn't supposed
to happen (and what did):
Houston's unheradled Bill
"Poodle"' Willoughby wasn't
supposed to snuff Kareem's
dreaded sky hook with the open
ing game on the line. But three
weeks ago, he did just that. The
Rockets' relentless Moses
Malone wasn't supposed to eat
the Lakers alive on their Forum
Blue Floor. But all season he
did Earvin (Magic) Johnson
wasn't supposed to cast up that
rock with the Laker's entire sea
son dangling in the balance But
he did.
And then there's the Phoenix
Suns — the archetypical regular
season terror post-season patsy
outfit. Having won 57 games,
the Suns weren't supposed to
fold up against crippled Kansas
City (especially when Otis
Birdsong joiqed fellow all-star
guard Phil Ford on the Kings'
injured list la e in game one).
But you can guess the rest.

Kansas City-Houston was
supposed to be the inside joke at
CBS Sports. But who's laughing
now?
All is not lost though. Even as
K.C.-Houston is a crime against
nature, there's still the Celtics
versus the Sixers in the Eastern
finals. And the Celts are the pick
here to bring some order back to
the NBA, first by putting away

resourcetul Houston in a six
game tiff Since both series are
presently deadlocked at one-all
(with Philly and Houston enjoy
ing home court edges), these
predictions are not giveaways.
Boston vs. Philadelphia
The Celtics and Sixers are oh
so similar Both teams are big,
deep, and poised. And both play
great defense. Last April, Dr. J

and friends :auf at Boston at the
wrong time jf tJ e month and ran
the Celts out in five games. The
opposite nay happen this year
Seven-fot t Rol ert Parrish has
been a re/elation for the Celts,
and he, Lr.rry Bird, Tiny
Archibald, and rookie Kevin
McHale have all been devastat
ing down the stretch Cham
pionship banner number twelve
should be hinging in the Boston
Garden next month.
Kansas City vs. Houston
, The Branniff series. And a
real snoozer. The keys in this
fray are Rocket center Moses
Malone and King forward Reg

gie King In game one. Moses
was unstoppable and Houston
romped by 19 points. Wednesday
night. King returned the favor,
dropping 31 points on the Rock
ets as Kansas City coasted 88-79.
While the Kings are as de
termined as they come, they are
also pitifully slow. Take Moses
and company to strip Cin
derella's garb in six games.
That's when the fun ends. Hous
ton and Kansas City combined
could not beat either of the
Eastern finalists. But then
again, I thought Phoenix would
still be playing.
Magic Johnson is getting an-
noyed. "C'mon Kareem, it's
• name time!. . .Where's thepop
corn?" „ .
"Chill out, E.J.," growls Ab
- dul-Jabbar, his game face firm-
ly in place. "You'll get your
grub as soon as D.J. comes up
