Le Pot au Feu is listed in the Palo Alto
phone book as Le Pot au Deu - one letter
away trom being The Dish of God.
That's the way it is at Le Pot au Feu: ev
erything is one letter away from being
great. On the other hand, no one wants man
na every night, and Le Pot au Feu, while not
up to the standards ot La Terrasse or Mad
dalena's, does offer cozier surroundings,
less pretentious service, and lower prices
than those haute rxez joints — as well as
good basic French food.
I have a friend who when faced with an un
known architectural style immediately pro
claims it Early or Late Eclectic depending
on its ornateness. Le Pot au Feu's interior is
Late, Late Eclectic, so much so that it has
heavily discernible influences of Friendly
Clutter. The room is long, and half of it is
raised on a platform. The half that's raised
is designed to look like a French cafe in a
courtyard: there are shade umbrellas,
plastic tablecloths, fake red-tiled roofs, and
even — high above the diners' heads — a few
windowboxes filled with plastic geraniums.
All in all a great re-creation of someone's
high school Gay Paris Prom Night. I loved
it. The level below the platform, for some
unknown reason, is in a more serious tone,
and includes framed works of art on the
wall. The lights are low, encouraging tete a
tetes.

The waitress hands us the menu and we
get down to serious business. Pate, esca
rgots, Beet Wellington, sole, chocolate
mousse, etc., etc. Julia Child could recite
the recipes for most of these things in her
sleep. So could any self-respecting, cul
turally enlightened cook who lived through
the era when every home dinner party had
to be Francois and better than the neigh
bor's. But then Le Pot au Feu doesn't try tor
innovation, it just tries to do well with the
standards.
My appetizer arrives. Six snails stare
glumly up at me trom a dish of garlic butter
sauce. I cut one in halt to give some to my
dinner partner, who is shy of committing
himself to a whole one. (Never cut a snail in
half. After seeing what's inside, I am unsure
as to who is more desperate — me or the
snails.) The snails are good, however, and
even though the sauce is a little light on the
garlic I put on a shameless display of glut
tony by dipping the bread in the leftover
sauce. Too bad the bread is a little stale.
We all know pea soup, but few of us love it.
It's a real underachiever. Le Pot au Feu's
pea soup, however, is wonderful: rich,
creamy (no lumps here), and subtly
flavored with bacon. The salad that comes
with dinner, on the other hand, is a boring
plate of lettuce with an even more boring
vinaigrette. I sleep through it and give
solace to myself with the wine.
For an entree, my partner orders salmon.
It comes — surprise — in a pretty goldfish
shaped pastry shell with a small dish ot

Hollandaise-like sauce beside it Next to the
pea soup, this is the best part ot the meal
It's hard cooking fish or meat inside pastry,
but someone in the kitchen obviously knows
what they're doing where this is concerned
the salmon is great, and my partner won't
share,
This, as it turns out, is tragic My entree
is more complicated and not as good It's
flank steak wrapped around pate and
cheese, and sliced in thin vertical slices like
a chocolate roll. It's so peppery that I can't
taste anything but the pate, and so heavy
that I can't finish it.
Perhaps Le Pot au Feu should stick to
simpler productions — dishes like the one
the restaurant is named tor, which I re
member from previous visits as being a
good, hearty peasant beef and vegetable
stew in a casserole.
Other entrees offered include stuffed
sole, Beef Wellington, and medallions of
beef with Hollandaise sauce. All average
about $10. Desserts include chocolate
mousse, a strawberry tart, and a sundae
made with chestnuts — once again, good
basic food but not the stuff ot which interna
tional chef competitions are made.
So it ain't manna. But it's not bad either.
It's moderately priced, and if you don't
know basic French cooking, it will make a
good introduction.
And then when you're through, you can
move into the big leagues and make your
reservations at La Terrasse or Mad
dalena's.
