# Making butter turn to gold at the natural Prolific Oven
## 
### Vince Waldman The Prolific Oven 
550 Waverly, Palo Alto
326-8485
Open daily, various hours
It used to be a hardware store; now the
storefront window displays old-fashioned bak
ery machinery, announcing The Prolific
Oven's dedication to traditional ingredients
and methods. The beige walls are covered with
homey quilts, and plants sedately occupy cor
ners of the bakery. The ceiling is high and the
lighting bright, making the place look some
thing like a library. Reading materials are in
tact scattered around for the patrons, who
range from stockbrokers to panhandlers.
This is not a place that makes concessions.
Harriet Bauman, who opened this bak
ery/coffee house last August, used to run a
wholesale baking operation, and she still sells
her wares to restaurants all over the area. At
The Prolific Oven she can offer baked goods
that don't have the long shelf life demanded by
her wholesale customers. She is proud of her
refusal to use any artificial ingredients — and
she is contemptuous of other bakeries which do
employ preservatives or ingredients such as
artificial vanilla or bulk cake mixes.
"You can't weave straw into gold,'' Baumain
says. The most conspicuous gold at The Pro
lific Oven is butter: the bakery goes through
three 68-pound blocks of butter every week.
The luxurious aura of pure ingredients pene
trates all the shop's products.
Chocolate, carrot, and orange cake are gen
erally available every day. When I visited,
there was also a delightful chocolate-amaretto
cake encased in whipped cream and filled with

almonds. A different bread is baked each day
of the week , on Friday it is a beautiful challah,
colored a very pale yellow instead of the "elec
tric yellow" which Bauman says comes from
artificial coloring.
Without detracting from the general ex
cellence of the bakery, at least three items de
serve special mention. The croissant is per
fectly flaky on the outside, but the interior is
wonderfully moist, and it has an incomparably
rich buttery flavor. The cheese danish is made
with rum and nutmeg , it gives new nobility to
the humble danish, and is perhaps the break
fast equivalent of the three-martini lunch The
chocolate-walnut cookie is as flavorful and
moist as a brownie, but more compact, so that
the pleasure is more concentrated
The Prolific Oven will also do special-order
baking — but only on its own terms. Bauman
recently rejected an order from a woman who
wanted a birthday cake with bright pink roses ;
artificial coloring would have been required.
(Instead, she uses real flowers.) A unique wed
ding cake can be requested, with cream cheese
frosting and champagne glasses separating the
tiers: as good a reason as I can think of to get
married in Palo Alto.
During the day the store is very light and
commodious. Some students actually come in
to study while lingering over a cup of espresso,
capuccino, or herb tea. At night spotlights are
turned on, giving the place a neon glow. On
Wednesday nights Nina Spiro plays the flute,
sometimes alone, sometimes with others. One
week there were five flutes and a cello: a com
bination as distinctive and alluring as this
marvelous bakery.
