# Move delayed to incorporate East P.A.
## 
### Peter Finch 
A group of East Palo Alto citizens
has been denied an important step
toward incorporating their communi
ty as a city.
Understandably, the group — the
East Palo Alto Citizens Commission
on Incorporation (EPACCI) — was
bitterly disappointed.
Commissioned by the East Palo
Alto Municipal Council last April,
EPACCI has spent the last year striv
ing to acheive incorporated status for
their community of some 18,000 resi
dents.
An EPACCI spokesman said that on
April 10 the group applied to the San
Mateo County Local Agency For
mation Commission (LAFCO) to
place a measure calling tor the city's
incorporation on the November elec
tion ballot.
At the April 15 LAFCO meeting, the
spokesman said the application was
rejected on the grounds of "insuffi
cient information "
"It was simply a delaying tactic
said one EPACCI member, who
wished not to be identified.
"They (LAFCO) are well aware
that East Palo Alto has the only avail
able land on the Peninsula that could
possibly serve as a bedroom com
munity and solve our current housing
imbalance," the spokesman added.
"If you read the story in the Penin
sula Times-Tribune," said EPACCI
head Carmelite Oakes, "it's just the
opposite. We did everything they
(LAFCO) said They deliberately

gave us false leads and miscolored in
formation. •»
"We're going to move forward."
She continued. "We're making every
effort to make them put everything
(LAFCO wantsi in writing."
Sherman Coffman. director of LAF
CO. however, had an entirely different
account of the issue.
"That's a bald-faced lie," hesaid. in
reference to Oakes' claim of "false
leads."
"I'm fed up with this kind of mis
representation," he said, adding that
LAFCO's needs have been on record
for years.
According to Coffman, LAFCO re

fused to agree to EPACCI's November
ballot proposal for a variety of dif
ferent. and clearly stated reasons.
"Our concern is that this is a fairly
complex issue," he said. "This com
mittee (LAFCO) wants a "sphere of
influence" study — a genial plan de
tailing land use and general structure
— and a community plan before any
thing else happens."
EPACCI ha 4 been well aware of the
process for some time, according to
Coffman
"I told them that the community
plan would be finished in July 981.
And that's about when the 'sphere
study' will be completed, too," Cof

fman said
"We've held task force meetings
with all the parties for two months
We sat down with a blackboard and
listed everything that needed to be
done You need to have everything
ready to go 114 days before an elec
tion, and there just wasn't enough
time." he said.
Still. EPACCI members felt unfair
ly treated.
"We're not so naive as to believe
that they intend to work cooperatively
with us." said one member. "We're
almost certain that when next April
comes around thev'll tell us to wait un
