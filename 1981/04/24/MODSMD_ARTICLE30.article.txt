y Chef Louis Borel is a garrulous Frenchman
J; with a full shock of salt-and-pepper hair and
dark eyebrows. He is almost
.apologetic as he explains why he and his part
ner Lorenzo Armanno are changing the name
£of L'Omelette to Chez Louis. L'Omelette was
jv)opened in 1932, and it was a popular watering
in the days when liquor couldn't be ob
tained closer to campus. But after its founder.
'.Andre Frelier, sold the restaurant in 1970, the
affinity between "L'Ommies" and
began to erode.
* For a while the place was a rock club, alien
bating the old customers. Newcomers to the
'area often assume L'Omelette is a breakfast
This obviously pains Borel, who has
,-been creating haute cuisine in the Americas
1963. For the last 34 years he and
> Armanno have been trying to restore the his
torical status of L'Omelette; but finally they
decided the name change was necessary. And
so. as soon as the new sign arrives, Chez Louis
.'will be in operation.

By any name, the restaurant has a charm
ing setting: like a French country cottage, it
sits back from the frenzy of El Camino. and
the interior is spacious and relaxed Copper
pots and lanterns decorate the main dining
room; one banquet room has a collection of
china from Brittany and looks like a rococo
lounge at a provincial inn.
The piano bar has been remodeled in a dark,
subtly elegant style, and the restaurant's fa
mous collection of hats will be moved into its
own glass display case The partners also plan
to install a glassed-in garden for all-weather
dining
The changes may be distracting the staff a
bit On our arrival for dinner, my partner and
I were promptly seated The maitred'grandly
laid our napkins in our laps. But then we sat
for almost 10 minutes without menus or even
water.
The meal proceeded with an erratic
rhythm: a long wait for soup, but no wait at all
between soup and salad, and then another long
wait before the entrees. Somebody has ap
parently told the waiters here that the worst
thing they can do is leave an empty dish on the
table Hence they swoop down and sweep
away the dishes almost before you're done.
They should expend as much effort on ensur

ing that meal goes smoothly from course to
course
In his rush to empty the wine bottle and get
it out of our way. the waiter poured the last of
the wine into my half-full water glass He
rushed away without ever realizing his error.
Fortunately it was an inexpensive wine
(Wente Bros. Grey Riesling, $4 for a halt-bot
tle ) The wine list is actually quite extensive
and interesting, with quality German and Ital
ian vintages as well as the expected French
and domestic. Many good choices can be had
for $8-$ lO a bottle; of course, the cost can go
much higher.
Soup and salad come with the meal The
soup was a very fine cream of vegetable, in
which the simple flavors of the vegetables
combined to create a quiet but distinctive
opening course. The salad was also very
simple — just lettuce and egg topped with a
creamy, slightly bitter dressing The menu
also offers appetizers ranging from ceviche
($2.75) to coquilles St. Jacques(s6 95).
The menu is notable for its emphasis on
lighter meats: steaks and roast beef are avail
able. but the most interesting dishes involve
veal or seafood. The veal chop in wild
mushroom sauce ($13.95) was excellent. The
veal was tender as it should be, the

mushrooms were succulent, and the sauce
was savory and thick without being unduly
heavy. Fillet of sole Deauville (with lobster
sauce, shrimp, and mushrooms. $10.95) was
not quite so successful: the sauce was lovely
but the fish itself was undistinguished The
owners plan to offer a nouvelle cuisine spe
cialty nightly; prawns, rabbit, duckling,
trogs' legs, and salmon are among the other
entrees In price the menu ranges from
chicken breast Viennese ($8.95) to rack of
lamb ($15.95) and roast beef ($2B for two).

Desserts include a refreshing creme
caramel ($1.75) and strawberries Romanoff
( $2.75). With a lower-priced wine, the total
bill tor two will probably be $30-$4O, plus tip.
Despite the disorientation of change, the
restaurant maintains much ot its popularity
among old Stanfordites. Jim Plunkett was
dining at a nearby table, and the owners were
ardently trying to persuade him to donate one
of his old helmets to their hat collection. 1
don t know if they succeeded, but he did look
satisfied as he departed.

The changes may be distracting the staff a
bit On our arrival for dinner, my partner and
I were promptly seated The maitred'grandly
laid our napkins in our laps. But then we sat
for almost 10 minutes without menus or even
water.
The meal proceeded with an erratic
rhythm: a long wait for soup, but no wait at all
between soup and salad, and then another long
wait before the entrees. Somebody has ap
parently told the waiters here that the worst
thing they can do is leave an empty dish on the
table Hence they swoop down and sweep
away the dishes almost before you're done.
They should expend as much effort on ensur

ing that meal goes smoothly from course to
course
In his rush to empty the wine bottle and get
it out of our way. the waiter poured the last of
the wine into my half-full water glass He
rushed away without ever realizing his error.
Fortunately it was an inexpensive wine
(Wente Bros. Grey Riesling, $4 for a halt-bot
tle ) The wine list is actually quite extensive
and interesting, with quality German and Ital
ian vintages as well as the expected French
and domestic. Many good choices can be had
for $8-$ lO a bottle; of course, the cost can go
much higher.
Soup and salad come with the meal The
soup was a very fine cream of vegetable, in
which the simple flavors of the vegetables
combined to create a quiet but distinctive
opening course. The salad was also very
simple — just lettuce and egg topped with a
creamy, slightly bitter dressing The menu
also offers appetizers ranging from ceviche
($2.75) to coquilles St. Jacques(s6 95).
The menu is notable for its emphasis on
lighter meats: steaks and roast beef are avail
able. but the most interesting dishes involve
veal or seafood. The veal chop in wild
mushroom sauce ($13.95) was excellent. The
veal was tender as it should be, the

mushrooms were succulent, and the sauce
was savory and thick without being unduly
heavy. Fillet of sole Deauville (with lobster
sauce, shrimp, and mushrooms. $10.95) was
not quite so successful: the sauce was lovely
but the fish itself was undistinguished The
owners plan to offer a nouvelle cuisine spe
cialty nightly; prawns, rabbit, duckling,
trogs' legs, and salmon are among the other
entrees In price the menu ranges from
chicken breast Viennese ($8.95) to rack of
lamb ($15.95) and roast beef ($2B for two).

Desserts include a refreshing creme
caramel ($1.75) and strawberries Romanoff
( $2.75). With a lower-priced wine, the total
bill tor two will probably be $30-$4O, plus tip.
Despite the disorientation of change, the
restaurant maintains much ot its popularity
among old Stanfordites. Jim Plunkett was
dining at a nearby table, and the owners were
ardently trying to persuade him to donate one
of his old helmets to their hat collection. 1
don t know if they succeeded, but he did look
satisfied as he departed.
