Friday, Kresge
George Cukor directed this
rather stodgy film adaptation of
the Lerner and Loewe musical.
Though it's not a great movie, the
play and the music are so appeal
ing that they more than outweigh
any weaknesses in direction and
pacing As nearly everyone knows,
Mx h'uir Ladx is based on the Shaw
play, "Pygmalion" (or, more ac
curately, it is based on the
screenplay Shaw worked up for the
1938 movie version). Rex Har
rison, recreating his stage role,
plays linguistics expert Henry
Higgins; Audrey Hepburn plays
the dialectically underprivileged
Eliza Doolittle. Lerner and Loewe
supplied the tunes: "I Could Have
Danced All Night," "On the Street
Where You Live," "I've Grown
Accustomed to Her Face," and
many others.

★ ★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Alec Guinness, playing all eight
members of the aristocratic
D'Ascoyne family, gets brutally
murdered eight times and each
murder is funnier, and wittier, and
more stylish than the one that
came before. TheD'Ascoynes, you
see, are prigs and bigots, and —
though I know, in my heart of
hearts, that this isn't right — they
seem to be asking for it, Louis
D'Ascoyne Mazzini, played by
Dennis Price, is the man doing the
killing; not coincidentally, he's
ninth in line for the family fortune.
Guinness is brilliant, Price is ter
rific, and the movie's great.
Plays through Wednesday with

One's frail hopes that this will
turn out to be a witty comedy
about the revenge three* abused
secretaries take on their

smashed when the plot unfolds.
This is a gooey situation comedy

Frank Capracorn ending. Lily

Coleman salvage as much as they
can, but Jane Fonda gives a dis
graceful performance: trying to
play a woman of average in

Thief ★★★'4
Royal, San Francisco
Michael Mann, who is making
his commercial film debut with
Thiefj has a feeling for lonely
milieux and a juicy, trashy energy.
Thief is a terrific pulp movie. It is
so fiercely kinetic (like the score
that Tangerine .-Dream performs
behind it)- and so unerringly deft
that it seems to have been as
sembled unconsciously. This mov
ie has two of the most exciting —
and most instructive — heist
scenes I've ever encountered; if
Mann's career as a director ever
falters, he could make it as a safe
cracker.
But the picture belongs to star
James Caan. In Thief, his best
\york to date, he plays Frank, a
diamond burglar who prides
himself on his expertise and his in
dependence; he speaks straight
and rejects the efforts of other
men to claim ownership of his ser
vices. Thief may be urban
western junk, but it's highly
charged and beautifully made.

The newest version of James M.
Cain's taut, mean little potboiler,
starring Jack Nicholson and
Jessica Lange. has a convincing
period look, and the director, Bob
Rafelson, has done a good job of
recreating a desolate, under
populated patch of rural Califor
nia. Oddly enough, f'ostman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong , it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist. and well heeled:
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige — in
cluding the casting of Jack Nich
olson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direction,
which seems to be telling us to

itudy carefully what requires no
more than a glance. For if you take
away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.

The Deer Hunter
Fox. Redwood City
A rrr\ rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
contradictory or confusing or
both But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell em I died tor Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of Iwo
Jima; the movie puts you face to
face with the horrors of war.
The actors rise above the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cen
tral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in the
same way that he has been starkly
individualistic in practically ev
erything else he's made — and oc
casionally he restores the movie
when things get pushed out of
shape. The Deer Hunter is more
than a little misshapen — some
times unbelievably wrong — but
there is a masterpiece buried in
there somewhere, and it more
than repays an attempt at excava
tion.
Plays tonight and Saturday with

This movie puts its tasteful ley
cold grip on you right away — after
the first tew minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some

time discovering fundamental
truths about each other — they're

you feel that you've really cap

Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master

his airtight, squeaky clean shot

Jerry Lewis doesn't smile much
in Hardly \Vi>rl;inu, his firstmovie
in about 10 years. There are fewer
jokes, and less schtick, here than
in any other Lewis movie I can
think of He's no longer a likeable
klutz who gets swept into chaos by
the strength of his own good inten
tions. he's merely a klutz. When he
does something stupid, we don't
laugh, we politely avert our eyes.
It's not nice to laugh at people who
can't help themselves.
The movie is not without its mo
ments. In a simple, marvelous
scene. Lewis has a telephone con
versation with an answering ma
chine that chastises him for his
rudeness. Offended, he wraps the
cord around his hand until the
voice chokes on its own words. If
Lewis had been as free, and as
tierce, with the rest of the movie
as he was with this scene, he might
have had a comeback on his hands.
Instead, he prepared something
that seems a lot more like a wake.

The newest version of James M.
Cain's taut, mean little potboiler,
starring Jack Nicholson and
Jessica Lange. has a convincing
period look, and the director, Bob
Rafelson, has done a good job of
recreating a desolate, under
populated patch of rural Califor
nia. Oddly enough, f'ostman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong , it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist. and well heeled:
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige — in
cluding the casting of Jack Nich

curiously overweighted direction,
which seems to be telling us to

contradictory or confusing or

war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell em I died tor Betty"

The actors rise above the

is starkly individualistic in the

when things get pushed out of

Jerry Lewis doesn't smile much

in any other Lewis movie I can
think of He's no longer a likeable
klutz who gets swept into chaos by
the strength of his own good inten

does something stupid, we don't
laugh, we politely avert our eyes.
It's not nice to laugh at people who
can't help themselves.
The movie is not without its mo
ments. In a simple, marvelous
scene. Lewis has a telephone con
versation with an answering ma
chine that chastises him for his
rudeness. Offended, he wraps the
cord around his hand until the
voice chokes on its own words. If
Lewis had been as free, and as
tierce, with the rest of the movie
as he was with this scene, he might
have had a comeback on his hands.
Instead, he prepared something
that seems a lot more like a wake.

Michael Mann, who is making

Thiefj has a feeling for lonely

Thief is a terrific pulp movie. It is
so fiercely kinetic (like the score
that Tangerine .-Dream performs
behind it)- and so unerringly deft
that it seems to have been as
sembled unconsciously. This mov
ie has two of the most exciting —
and most instructive — heist
scenes I've ever encountered; if
Mann's career as a director ever
falters, he could make it as a safe
cracker.
But the picture belongs to star
James Caan. In Thief, his best
\york to date, he plays Frank, a
diamond burglar who prides
himself on his expertise and his in
dependence; he speaks straight
and rejects the efforts of other
men to claim ownership of his ser
vices. Thief may be urban
western junk, but it's highly

ments. In a simple, marvelous
scene. Lewis has a telephone con
versation with an answering ma
chine that chastises him for his
rudeness. Offended, he wraps the
cord around his hand until the
voice chokes on its own words. If
Lewis had been as free, and as
tierce, with the rest of the movie
as he was with this scene, he might
have had a comeback on his hands.
Instead, he prepared something
that seems a lot more like a wake.

the Lerner and Loewe musical.
Though it's not a great movie, the

Mx h'uir Ladx is based on the Shaw
play, "Pygmalion" (or, more ac

screenplay Shaw worked up for the

plays linguistics expert Henry

Michael Mann, who is making
his commercial film debut with
Thiefj has a feeling for lonely
milieux and a juicy, trashy energy.
Thief is a terrific pulp movie. It is
so fiercely kinetic (like the score
that Tangerine .-Dream performs
behind it)- and so unerringly deft
that it seems to have been as
sembled unconsciously. This mov
ie has two of the most exciting —
and most instructive — heist
scenes I've ever encountered; if
Mann's career as a director ever
falters, he could make it as a safe
cracker.
But the picture belongs to star
James Caan. In Thief, his best
\york to date, he plays Frank, a
diamond burglar who prides
himself on his expertise and his in
dependence; he speaks straight
and rejects the efforts of other
men to claim ownership of his ser
vices. Thief may be urban
western junk, but it's highly
charged and beautifully made.

The newest version of James M.
Cain's taut, mean little potboiler,
starring Jack Nicholson and

period look, and the director, Bob
Rafelson, has done a good job of
recreating a desolate, under

weak in the very places where the
book is strong , it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist. and well heeled:
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige — in
cluding the casting of Jack Nich

of the "tell em I died tor Betty"

The actors rise above the

is starkly individualistic in the

scenes I've ever encountered; if
Mann's career as a director ever
falters, he could make it as a safe
cracker.
But the picture belongs to star
James Caan. In Thief, his best
\york to date, he plays Frank, a
diamond burglar who prides
himself on his expertise and his in
dependence; he speaks straight
and rejects the efforts of other
men to claim ownership of his ser
vices. Thief may be urban
western junk, but it's highly
charged and beautifully made.

The film's human characters
aren't so richly fleshed out. The

this film version of Chaucer's

The newest version of James M.
Cain's taut, mean little potboiler,
starring Jack Nicholson and
Jessica Lange. has a convincing
period look, and the director, Bob
Rafelson, has done a good job of
recreating a desolate, under
populated patch of rural Califor
nia. Oddly enough, f'ostman is
weak in the very places where the
book is strong , it is listless, stolid,
lacking in drive.
The movie is beautifully shot,
by Sven Nykvist. and well heeled:
it's obvious that Paramount spent
money on it. All this prestige — in
cluding the casting of Jack Nich
olson — may account for the
curiously overweighted direction,
which seems to be telling us to

itudy carefully what requires no
more than a glance. For if you take
away James Cain's scummy
speed, what remains isn't really
worth filming.

The Deer Hunter
Fox. Redwood City
A rrr\ rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
contradictory or confusing or
both But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell em I died tor Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of Iwo
Jima; the movie puts you face to
face with the horrors of war.
The actors rise above the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cen
tral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in the
same way that he has been starkly
individualistic in practically ev
erything else he's made — and oc
casionally he restores the movie
when things get pushed out of
shape. The Deer Hunter is more
than a little misshapen — some
times unbelievably wrong — but
there is a masterpiece buried in
there somewhere, and it more
than repays an attempt at excava
tion.

Jerry Lewis doesn't smile much
in Hardly \Vi>rl;inu, his firstmovie
in about 10 years. There are fewer
jokes, and less schtick, here than
in any other Lewis movie I can
think of He's no longer a likeable
klutz who gets swept into chaos by
the strength of his own good inten
tions. he's merely a klutz. When he
does something stupid, we don't
laugh, we politely avert our eyes.
It's not nice to laugh at people who
can't help themselves.
The movie is not without its mo
ments. In a simple, marvelous
scene. Lewis has a telephone con
versation with an answering ma
chine that chastises him for his
rudeness. Offended, he wraps the
cord around his hand until the
voice chokes on its own words. If
Lewis had been as free, and as
tierce, with the rest of the movie
as he was with this scene, he might
have had a comeback on his hands.
Instead, he prepared something
that seems a lot more like a wake.

Friday, Kresge
George Cukor directed this
rather stodgy film adaptation of
the Lerner and Loewe musical.
Though it's not a great movie, the
play and the music are so appeal
ing that they more than outweigh
any weaknesses in direction and
pacing As nearly everyone knows,
Mx h'uir Ladx is based on the Shaw
play, "Pygmalion" (or, more ac
curately, it is based on the
screenplay Shaw worked up for the
1938 movie version). Rex Har
rison, recreating his stage role,
plays linguistics expert Henry
Higgins; Audrey Hepburn plays
the dialectically underprivileged
Eliza Doolittle. Lerner and Loewe
supplied the tunes: "I Could Have
Danced All Night," "On the Street
Where You Live," "I've Grown
Accustomed to Her Face," and
many others.

Royal, San Francisco
Michael Mann, who is making
his commercial film debut with
Thiefj has a feeling for lonely
milieux and a juicy, trashy energy.
Thief is a terrific pulp movie. It is
so fiercely kinetic (like the score
that Tangerine .-Dream performs
behind it)- and so unerringly deft
that it seems to have been as
sembled unconsciously. This mov
ie has two of the most exciting —
and most instructive — heist
scenes I've ever encountered; if
Mann's career as a director ever
falters, he could make it as a safe

and rejects the efforts of other
