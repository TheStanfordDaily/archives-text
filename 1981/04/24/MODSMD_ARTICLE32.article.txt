Reagan set to lift grain embargo
Washington — President Ronald Reagan plans to
lift the grain embargo against the Soviet Union to
day, after the stock and commodity markets have
closed for the weekend, according to White House
officials.
The embargo has been a thorn in Reagan's side
since his inauguration. He campaigned against it
and pledged to lift it, but when he took office he was
persuaded that he would send the Soviet Union a
wrong signal if he followed through on his pledge at
that time.
White House counselor Edwin Meese, who in
sisted to a group of newspaper editors yesterday
that "I have no basis to tell you when ißeagan)
might make a decision," added a new note. He said
that one factor the president would take into account
in making an embargo decision would be whether he
has been in office long enough tor the Soviet Union to
have come to understand the signals he is sending
them.
The embargo, imposed by President Jimmy
Carter in January 1980 in an attempt to punish the
Soviets for their invasion and occupation of Afghan
istan, apparently is being lifted with the justifi
cation that the Soviets have not invaded Poland or
sponsored an internal crackdown against its labor
unions.
Reagan has consistently opposed the embargo on
the grounds that it is unfair to farmers, demanding
that they shoulder a burden he says should be borne
more generally.
White House deputy press secretary Robert
Woolsey insisted yesterday that Reagan "has not
yet made a decision on whether to lift the embargo."
Despite the denials that a decision had been made,
there were indications that European allies were
being informed yesterday that the embargo was
about to be lifted.
One U.S. diplomat stationed in Europe reacted
with dismay. He said that lifting the embargo would
undermine efforts to continue condemning the Sovi
et invasion of Afghanistan. He also expressed fear
that it would strengthen the determination of those
in the Kremlin, who argue that if they just hang on in
Afghanistan and anywhere else, the United States
will cave in.
Riots erupt over hunger strike
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Rioters stoned police
and troops in Catholic West Belfast yesterday after
the British turned down Bobby Sands' request to see
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark and
Father Daniel Berrigan.
Police reported no casualties and said the vio
lence in West Belfast was on a smaller scale that
previous rioting over the hunger strike by Sands, a
jailed Irish Republican Army guerrilla demanding
political prisoner status and approaching death af
ter 54 days of fasting.

The government's decision to refuse the meeting
with Clark and Berrigan came only days aiter Sands
was allowed to see three legislators from the Irish
Republic. Although sympathetic to Sands' cause,
they said they were willing to try to convince him to
halt his fast. They failed.
Sands immediately asked to see the Clark and
Berrigan. but the British government's Northern
Ireland Office refused, saying such a meeting would
serve "no useful purpose" since the Irish legislators
had failed to get him to stop fasting.
Berrigan. who declared on arrival at Shannon air
port that Sands and other Irish guerrillas had been
jailed "for political purposes." told reporters in
Belfast the two Americans would "continue to make
representations" to the British government to visit
the Maze prison where Sands is held.
Senate abortion probe protested
Washington — Amid angry protests that he had
embarked on a one-sided inquiry, a freshman sena
tor yesterday set out to establish something that the
ologians have been debating for 2000 years — when
does human life begin?
Sen. John East, one ot the most outspoken new
conservatives in Congress, found — not surprisingly
— that five eminent physicians he had invited to tes
tify before a subcommittee he heads agreed with
him: that life begins at the moment of conception.
On the opening day of what promises to become an
emotionally charged debate on the abortion issue,
East was also greeted by strongly worded pleas
from fellow senators that he invite anti-abortionists
to testify, and by scores of demonstrators who added
a circus atmosphere to his effort.
At issue is a bill introduced by East's mentor. Sen.
Jesse Helms, that would allow states to outlaw abor
tion. The bill, an attempt to make abortion illegal
without a constitutional amendment, proposes that
"human life shall be deemed to exist from concep
tion." If it passes, abortion would be the taking of
human life, and thus a crime
The doctors called to testify were slightly amused
by the spectacle and the central question poised by
East. "There is nothing new in what we're telling
you," Said Dr. Jerome LeJeune, a world renowned
geneticist and professor at the Medical College of
Paris. "There are no revelations before you. We are
telling you what we tell every student."
A coalition ot groups favoring abortion have
mounted an extensive lobbying effort in recent days,
complaining that the East hearings are one-sided
and unfair Twenty-one groups, ranging from the
American Jewish Congress to the National Abortion
Federation, released separate press statements
criticizing the bill and the hearings yesterday.
Soviet delegation visits Poland
Warsaw. Poland — A high-level Soviet delegation
led by the Kremlin's chief ideologist. Mikhail Sus
lov, arrived here unexpectedly yesterday as Polish

communists prepared for a crucial meeting of their
policy-making Central Committee.
Suslov, who is regarded in Moscow as the second
most influential figure in the Soviet Politburo after
President Leonid Brezhnev, was met at Warsaw air
port by Polish communist leader Stanislaw Kania.
Later he held talks with the entire Polish Politburo.
During a talk with a group of Western correspon
dents, however, a senior Polish Communist Party
official insisted that Suslov's visit was not directly
connected with next week's election session. Jozef
Klasa, head of the Central Committee's Information
Department, said the Soviet delegation would be
briefed about a "new political situation" here since
last month when a general strike over alleged police
violence was narrowly averted.
Shuttle maiden flight 'perfect'
Houston —The two astronauts who last week flew
the winged space shuttle Columbia yesterday de
scribed it as an incomparable flying machine that
will give the United States "routine access" to
space for the next 20 years. At a news conference at
the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Columbia
Commander John Young said, "I tell you, we're
going to get this thing operational sooner than any
body thinks."
"Nothing failed," said Crippen. "Statistically, I
didn't think that was possible. We've been working
three years to learn how to handle catastrophes and
all we did the whole time was sit back and enjoy it."
The two astronauts saved most of their praise for
the way Columbia handled during its 5000-mile glide
over the Pacific Ocean to a pinpoint landing in Cali
fornia's Mojave Desert. Young said he could have
used the wings, tail, and elevons to fly it all by
himself through hypersonic flight right to touch
down.
Said the 50-year-old Young: "We hardly used our
brakes. I tell you, that was quite a performance, tak
ing 99 tons out of orbit and getting it back down all in
one piece."
Stocks fade after early rally
New York — Some favorable inflation news
sparked an early rally in stock prices yesterday, but
the advance faded toward the close. The Dow Jones
average, up almost 10 points at its mid-session peak,
wound up settling for a 3.25 gain at 1010.27.
New York Stock Exchange volume reached its
highest level in almost a month at 64.20 million
shares, against 60.66 million Wednesday.

with dismay. He said that lifting the embargo would
undermine efforts to continue condemning the Sovi

that it would strengthen the determination of those
in the Kremlin, who argue that if they just hang on in
Afghanistan and anywhere else, the United States
will cave in.
Riots erupt over hunger strike
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Rioters stoned police
and troops in Catholic West Belfast yesterday after
the British turned down Bobby Sands' request to see
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark and
Father Daniel Berrigan.
Police reported no casualties and said the vio
lence in West Belfast was on a smaller scale that
previous rioting over the hunger strike by Sands, a
jailed Irish Republican Army guerrilla demanding
political prisoner status and approaching death af
ter 54 days of fasting.

The government's decision to refuse the meeting
with Clark and Berrigan came only days aiter Sands
was allowed to see three legislators from the Irish
Republic. Although sympathetic to Sands' cause,
they said they were willing to try to convince him to
halt his fast. They failed.
Sands immediately asked to see the Clark and
Berrigan. but the British government's Northern
Ireland Office refused, saying such a meeting would
serve "no useful purpose" since the Irish legislators
had failed to get him to stop fasting.
Berrigan. who declared on arrival at Shannon air
port that Sands and other Irish guerrillas had been
jailed "for political purposes." told reporters in
Belfast the two Americans would "continue to make
representations" to the British government to visit
the Maze prison where Sands is held.
Senate abortion probe protested
Washington — Amid angry protests that he had
embarked on a one-sided inquiry, a freshman sena
tor yesterday set out to establish something that the
ologians have been debating for 2000 years — when
does human life begin?
Sen. John East, one ot the most outspoken new
conservatives in Congress, found — not surprisingly
— that five eminent physicians he had invited to tes
tify before a subcommittee he heads agreed with
him: that life begins at the moment of conception.
On the opening day of what promises to become an
emotionally charged debate on the abortion issue,
East was also greeted by strongly worded pleas
from fellow senators that he invite anti-abortionists
to testify, and by scores of demonstrators who added
a circus atmosphere to his effort.
At issue is a bill introduced by East's mentor. Sen.
Jesse Helms, that would allow states to outlaw abor
tion. The bill, an attempt to make abortion illegal
without a constitutional amendment, proposes that
"human life shall be deemed to exist from concep
tion." If it passes, abortion would be the taking of
human life, and thus a crime
The doctors called to testify were slightly amused
by the spectacle and the central question poised by
East. "There is nothing new in what we're telling
you," Said Dr. Jerome LeJeune, a world renowned
geneticist and professor at the Medical College of
Paris. "There are no revelations before you. We are
telling you what we tell every student."
A coalition ot groups favoring abortion have
mounted an extensive lobbying effort in recent days,
complaining that the East hearings are one-sided
and unfair Twenty-one groups, ranging from the
American Jewish Congress to the National Abortion
Federation, released separate press statements
criticizing the bill and the hearings yesterday.
Soviet delegation visits Poland
Warsaw. Poland — A high-level Soviet delegation
led by the Kremlin's chief ideologist. Mikhail Sus
lov, arrived here unexpectedly yesterday as Polish

communists prepared for a crucial meeting of their
policy-making Central Committee.
Suslov, who is regarded in Moscow as the second
most influential figure in the Soviet Politburo after
President Leonid Brezhnev, was met at Warsaw air
port by Polish communist leader Stanislaw Kania.
Later he held talks with the entire Polish Politburo.
During a talk with a group of Western correspon
dents, however, a senior Polish Communist Party
official insisted that Suslov's visit was not directly
connected with next week's election session. Jozef
Klasa, head of the Central Committee's Information
Department, said the Soviet delegation would be
briefed about a "new political situation" here since
last month when a general strike over alleged police
violence was narrowly averted.
Shuttle maiden flight 'perfect'
Houston —The two astronauts who last week flew
the winged space shuttle Columbia yesterday de
scribed it as an incomparable flying machine that
will give the United States "routine access" to
space for the next 20 years. At a news conference at
the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Columbia
Commander John Young said, "I tell you, we're
going to get this thing operational sooner than any
body thinks."
"Nothing failed," said Crippen. "Statistically, I
didn't think that was possible. We've been working
three years to learn how to handle catastrophes and
all we did the whole time was sit back and enjoy it."
The two astronauts saved most of their praise for
the way Columbia handled during its 5000-mile glide
over the Pacific Ocean to a pinpoint landing in Cali
fornia's Mojave Desert. Young said he could have
used the wings, tail, and elevons to fly it all by
himself through hypersonic flight right to touch
down.
Said the 50-year-old Young: "We hardly used our
brakes. I tell you, that was quite a performance, tak
ing 99 tons out of orbit and getting it back down all in
one piece."
Stocks fade after early rally
New York — Some favorable inflation news
sparked an early rally in stock prices yesterday, but
the advance faded toward the close. The Dow Jones
average, up almost 10 points at its mid-session peak,
wound up settling for a 3.25 gain at 1010.27.
New York Stock Exchange volume reached its
highest level in almost a month at 64.20 million
shares, against 60.66 million Wednesday.

Reagan set to lift grain embargo
Washington — President Ronald Reagan plans to
lift the grain embargo against the Soviet Union to
day, after the stock and commodity markets have
closed for the weekend, according to White House
officials.
The embargo has been a thorn in Reagan's side
since his inauguration. He campaigned against it
and pledged to lift it, but when he took office he was
persuaded that he would send the Soviet Union a
wrong signal if he followed through on his pledge at
that time.
White House counselor Edwin Meese, who in
sisted to a group of newspaper editors yesterday
that "I have no basis to tell you when ißeagan)
might make a decision," added a new note. He said
that one factor the president would take into account
in making an embargo decision would be whether he
has been in office long enough tor the Soviet Union to
have come to understand the signals he is sending
them.
The embargo, imposed by President Jimmy
Carter in January 1980 in an attempt to punish the
Soviets for their invasion and occupation of Afghan
istan, apparently is being lifted with the justifi
cation that the Soviets have not invaded Poland or
sponsored an internal crackdown against its labor
unions.
Reagan has consistently opposed the embargo on
the grounds that it is unfair to farmers, demanding
that they shoulder a burden he says should be borne
more generally.
White House deputy press secretary Robert
Woolsey insisted yesterday that Reagan "has not
yet made a decision on whether to lift the embargo."
Despite the denials that a decision had been made,
there were indications that European allies were
being informed yesterday that the embargo was
about to be lifted.
One U.S. diplomat stationed in Europe reacted

undermine efforts to continue condemning the Sovi

tor yesterday set out to establish something that the
ologians have been debating for 2000 years — when
does human life begin?
Sen. John East, one ot the most outspoken new
conservatives in Congress, found — not surprisingly
— that five eminent physicians he had invited to tes
tify before a subcommittee he heads agreed with
him: that life begins at the moment of conception.
On the opening day of what promises to become an
emotionally charged debate on the abortion issue,
East was also greeted by strongly worded pleas
from fellow senators that he invite anti-abortionists
to testify, and by scores of demonstrators who added
a circus atmosphere to his effort.
At issue is a bill introduced by East's mentor. Sen.
Jesse Helms, that would allow states to outlaw abor
tion. The bill, an attempt to make abortion illegal
without a constitutional amendment, proposes that
"human life shall be deemed to exist from concep
tion." If it passes, abortion would be the taking of
human life, and thus a crime
The doctors called to testify were slightly amused
by the spectacle and the central question poised by
East. "There is nothing new in what we're telling
you," Said Dr. Jerome LeJeune, a world renowned
geneticist and professor at the Medical College of
Paris. "There are no revelations before you. We are
telling you what we tell every student."
A coalition ot groups favoring abortion have
mounted an extensive lobbying effort in recent days,
complaining that the East hearings are one-sided
and unfair Twenty-one groups, ranging from the
American Jewish Congress to the National Abortion
Federation, released separate press statements
criticizing the bill and the hearings yesterday.
Soviet delegation visits Poland
Warsaw. Poland — A high-level Soviet delegation
led by the Kremlin's chief ideologist. Mikhail Sus
lov, arrived here unexpectedly yesterday as Polish

communists prepared for a crucial meeting of their
policy-making Central Committee.
Suslov, who is regarded in Moscow as the second
most influential figure in the Soviet Politburo after
President Leonid Brezhnev, was met at Warsaw air
port by Polish communist leader Stanislaw Kania.
Later he held talks with the entire Polish Politburo.
During a talk with a group of Western correspon
dents, however, a senior Polish Communist Party
official insisted that Suslov's visit was not directly
connected with next week's election session. Jozef
Klasa, head of the Central Committee's Information
Department, said the Soviet delegation would be
briefed about a "new political situation" here since
last month when a general strike over alleged police
violence was narrowly averted.
Shuttle maiden flight 'perfect'
Houston —The two astronauts who last week flew
the winged space shuttle Columbia yesterday de
scribed it as an incomparable flying machine that
will give the United States "routine access" to
space for the next 20 years. At a news conference at
the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Columbia
Commander John Young said, "I tell you, we're
going to get this thing operational sooner than any
body thinks."
"Nothing failed," said Crippen. "Statistically, I
didn't think that was possible. We've been working
three years to learn how to handle catastrophes and
all we did the whole time was sit back and enjoy it."
The two astronauts saved most of their praise for
the way Columbia handled during its 5000-mile glide
over the Pacific Ocean to a pinpoint landing in Cali
fornia's Mojave Desert. Young said he could have
used the wings, tail, and elevons to fly it all by
himself through hypersonic flight right to touch
down.
Said the 50-year-old Young: "We hardly used our
brakes. I tell you, that was quite a performance, tak
ing 99 tons out of orbit and getting it back down all in
one piece."
