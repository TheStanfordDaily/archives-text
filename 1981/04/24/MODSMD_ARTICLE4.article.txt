# Poll shows students oppose US intervention in El Salvador

### Debbie Walker 
A majority of Stanford's students
polled are opposed to current U.S. mil
itary iavolvement in El Salvador, ac
cording to a report submitted last
week by an ad hoc ASSU Committee on
El Salvador.
The committee conducted two stu
dent opinion polls, the first a telephone
survey directed at 100 random stu
dents, and the second a questionnaire
handed out at a forum on El Salvador
held recently in Kresge Auditorium.
The polls also revealed that many
students are in favor of the ASSU tak
ing an active role in political educa
tion on campus.
"We found that people would like
the ASSU to take on the responsibility
of providing political education on na
tional and international affairs,"
ASSU Senator Ellyn Pildes said
Pildes said she and several other El
Salvador committee members had
hoped that the ASSU would take a
more active stance and come out with
an official opinion on the issue
The initial telephone poll conducted
in February showed that 66 percent of
students surveyed were opposed to
U.S. military involvement in El
Salvador and 5 percent supported it.
while 29 percent withheld opinion
The small size ot the poll sample
means the "confidence interval" of
the results is 10 percent â€” large by
polling standards This means there is
a 95 percent chance that the true per

centages of support and opposition are
within 10 percent of the stated results
Pildes said the poll "accurately rep
resented' the student body's opinions
on El Salvador.
Responses to the questions also in
dicated that only 8 percent of the sam
ple considered themselves knowl
edgeable about the situation in El
Salvador and related U.S. policy.
As a follow-up to the expressed stu
dent concern and seeming lack of in
formation surrounding the issue, the
ASSU committee organized the recent
forum on El Salvador which featured
Prof John Wirth, Asst. Prof. William
Durham. Assoc. Prof. Barton Berns
tein and Dr Lewis Gann, of the Hoo
ver Institution.
"Our goal was to provide informa
tion on the issue for the student body,
and also to attract a group of people
that more specific sponsoring or
ganizations might not have reached,"
Pildes said.
Responses to the questionnaire
circulated at the conclusion ot the fo
rum indicated that 83 percent of those
attending were opposed to American
military involvement in E3l Salvador, 3
percent were in favor of involvement,
5 percent had mixed feelings and 9 per
cent were undecided.
As to opinions concerning the
ASSU's role regarding El Salvador
and political education in general,
only 1 percent felt that the ASSU
should not be involved in political

education on campus. Seventy-one
percent ot students surveyed in
dicated support for more community
forums on political issues, and 35 per
cent encouraged the ASSU to come out
with a resolution concerning El
Salvador
One student commented, "A refer
endum would be great. 1 thought a stu
dent union was founded as a political
body, and I wish they wouldn't confine
themselves to purely Stanford ser
vices We can't isolate ourselves."
Another student wrote. "The politi
cal role of the ASSU is only valuable if
it remains non-partisan."
Pildes said that the ASSU has not
seen it fit to come out with a definite
stand on El Salvador, but she said that
political education has emerged as a
new task for the senate.
"I saw no mention of political
education in the recent ASSU cam
paigns, but it is something all new sen
ators should be aware of," Pildes said
"It is a new issue for the ASSU."
Senator Eve Rodler, one of the El
Salvador forum organizers, expressed
her views in a written statement at
tached to the committee's report.
"I firmly believe that it is theroleof
the ASSU Senate not only to become
involved in political education at Stan
ford. but also to articulate stands on
major national and international is
sues in cases where the issue is ot par
ticular concern to students and where
a majority voice rings clear "
