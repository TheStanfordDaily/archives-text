# Women's groups start planning for rape awareness program
## 
### Marianne Villanueva 
Representatives of Stanford women's
group have been meeting since late March
to plan a week-long program of activities,
called "Working Against Rape "
The program, which is being coordi
nated by the Office of Student Activities, is
scheduled for October 5-9 of the coming
autumn quarter.
The program will feature the following:
• A symposium on rape prevention and
the effect of the fear of rape on women. At
least two of the symposium's speakers
have been selected They are Pauline Bart
of the University of Illinois, and Stephanie
Riger of Lake Forest College.
Bart has recently published a major
study comparing strategies used by wom
en who were attacked and were able to
avoid being raped and those who were not
able to avoid being raped
Riger has done research on the effect of
fear of rape on women's lives.
The program organizers are still trying
to find one member of the Stanford faculty
and one graduate student to take part in the
symposium.
• A discussion on issues of self-defense
for women and demonstrations by various
self-defense groups on campus.
• An assertiveness training workshop
• An hour-long videotape, "Working

Against Rape." which will be shown in all
freshman dormitories.
The videotape was produced about a
year and a half ago along with a pamphlet.
The pamphlet discusses rape as an issue,
outlines precautionary measures that
women can take against the threat of phys
ical assault, and provides a step-by-step
description of what rape victims can ex
pect from legal and medical procedures
and from the emotional aftermath that fol
lows a rape
The videotape augments these themes.
It shows men and women in a Stanford resi
dence discussing prevalent myths about
rape, interviews four rape victims who
talk about their experiences, and has an in
terview with an attorney who talks about
the prosecution of rapists. The videotape
also discusses various legislative ap
proaches to the issue of rape.
In addition to the main features of the
program there will be a discussion —
"Roots of Violence" — which will examine
the causes of violence against women, as
well as a workshop and slide show — "Men
Working Against Sexist Violence — which
will focus on how men can participate to
help end violence against women.
The five-day program will culminate
with an evening of poetry at Tresidder
Union featuring Susan Griffin, a Bay Area

writer and poet, whose articles on rape in
clude "Rape: The All-Amencan Crime."
The program organizers are still trying
to obtain sponsorship and funding. Funding
proposals are being sent to campus or
ganizations, the departments of Sociology.
Anthropology, and Psychology, and the Of
fice ot the President.
Although the departments of Sociology,
Psychology and Anthropology have been
singled out for providing possible financial
support or sponsorship for the program,
the program organizers plan to ask support
of each department chair.
Patricia Brandt, assistant dean tor the
office of student activities and the or
ganizer of "Working Aginst Rape." says.
"We hope people in all the departments
will understand that this is important for
the women in their departments. If a wom
an taking physics can't use the physics lab
at night because she's afraid, that's dis
criminatory." Brandt says.
The fear of rape is as important an issue
as rape itself. Brandt says. "When we're
afraid that we can't do things we need to do
— like go to the library and work late —
we're being deprived of freedoms every
person should have," she says.
Measures currently are under way to in
crease personal safety on campus by im
proving the lighting The Stanford Police

Department is planning a "safe walk path"
— a commonly used walkway with plenty
ot lights and tire boxes — that will be fin
ished by the coming school year and that
students will be encouraged to use.
In addition, there is the SURE escort
service, which Raoul Niemeyer of the
Stanford Police Department says is "not
used as much as it should be "
For the organizers ot "Working Against
Rape," however, the problem is not mere
ly how to increase the level of personal
safety on campus, but how to change
rooted attitudes.
Brandt says one of her greatest concerns
is the so-called acquaintance" or "date"
rape, which occurs when the rapist is
someone the victim knows. Contrary to
popular belief, many rapes fall into this
category. Moreover, victims of these rapes
tend not to speak out because of a feeling of
guilt that they may have in some way pro
voked the attack Brandt says: "We want
to build an environment where there is nev
er an obligation to have sex when you don't
want to, and where the use of force is never
acceptable."
Trini Tonies. the coordinator of the stu
dent-run Rape Education Project, which
so far has committed $500 to the "Working
Against Rape" program, feels rape is "not
taken seriously enough by our society right

now." She says that many people fail to re
alize that rape traumatizes the lives of
many women.
A main feature of the publicity cam
paign for "Working Against Rape" will be
a poster discouraging people from using
"sexist, racist, and homophobic language
and jokes." The poster and a leaflet on the
same theme will be included in Regis
tration Packs during autumn quarter
Tonies says, "It's amazing that people
have no conception of the horror of being
raped " She describes how, in her
freshman year at Stanford, a male student
in her dormitory said he "didn't see why
rape was such a crime She explains that
one of the most damaging attitudes is the
prevalent myth that women have a secret
"rape wish "
Tonies says she feels that programs like
"Working Against Rape" are important so
that people can correct their mistaken at
titudes about rape But the final result de
pends on a woman's own strength and on
her capabilities for action Tonies says that
the program is designed "to reaffirm and
develop women's strength rather than
their dependence on men's strength and
protection, which is fostered bv a culture
which socializes us to be fearful,"
After all. Tonies says, "We shouldn't
have to freak out every time we're alone "

Against Rape." which will be shown in all
freshman dormitories.
The videotape was produced about a
year and a half ago along with a pamphlet.
The pamphlet discusses rape as an issue,
outlines precautionary measures that
women can take against the threat of phys
ical assault, and provides a step-by-step
description of what rape victims can ex
pect from legal and medical procedures
and from the emotional aftermath that fol
lows a rape
The videotape augments these themes.
It shows men and women in a Stanford resi
dence discussing prevalent myths about
rape, interviews four rape victims who
talk about their experiences, and has an in
terview with an attorney who talks about
the prosecution of rapists. The videotape
also discusses various legislative ap
proaches to the issue of rape.
In addition to the main features of the
program there will be a discussion —
"Roots of Violence" — which will examine
the causes of violence against women, as
well as a workshop and slide show — "Men
Working Against Sexist Violence — which
will focus on how men can participate to
help end violence against women.
The five-day program will culminate
with an evening of poetry at Tresidder
Union featuring Susan Griffin, a Bay Area

writer and poet, whose articles on rape in
clude "Rape: The All-Amencan Crime."
The program organizers are still trying
to obtain sponsorship and funding. Funding
proposals are being sent to campus or
ganizations, the departments of Sociology.
Anthropology, and Psychology, and the Of
fice ot the President.
Although the departments of Sociology,
Psychology and Anthropology have been
singled out for providing possible financial
support or sponsorship for the program,
the program organizers plan to ask support
of each department chair.
Patricia Brandt, assistant dean tor the
office of student activities and the or
ganizer of "Working Aginst Rape." says.
"We hope people in all the departments
will understand that this is important for
the women in their departments. If a wom
an taking physics can't use the physics lab
at night because she's afraid, that's dis
criminatory." Brandt says.
The fear of rape is as important an issue
as rape itself. Brandt says. "When we're
afraid that we can't do things we need to do
— like go to the library and work late —
we're being deprived of freedoms every
person should have," she says.
Measures currently are under way to in
crease personal safety on campus by im
proving the lighting The Stanford Police

Department is planning a "safe walk path"
— a commonly used walkway with plenty
ot lights and tire boxes — that will be fin
ished by the coming school year and that
students will be encouraged to use.
In addition, there is the SURE escort
service, which Raoul Niemeyer of the
Stanford Police Department says is "not
used as much as it should be "
For the organizers ot "Working Against
Rape," however, the problem is not mere
ly how to increase the level of personal
safety on campus, but how to change
rooted attitudes.
Brandt says one of her greatest concerns
is the so-called acquaintance" or "date"
rape, which occurs when the rapist is
someone the victim knows. Contrary to
popular belief, many rapes fall into this
category. Moreover, victims of these rapes
tend not to speak out because of a feeling of
guilt that they may have in some way pro
voked the attack Brandt says: "We want
to build an environment where there is nev
er an obligation to have sex when you don't
want to, and where the use of force is never
acceptable."
Trini Tonies. the coordinator of the stu
dent-run Rape Education Project, which
so far has committed $500 to the "Working
Against Rape" program, feels rape is "not
taken seriously enough by our society right

now." She says that many people fail to re
alize that rape traumatizes the lives of
many women.
A main feature of the publicity cam
paign for "Working Against Rape" will be
a poster discouraging people from using
"sexist, racist, and homophobic language
and jokes." The poster and a leaflet on the
same theme will be included in Regis
tration Packs during autumn quarter
Tonies says, "It's amazing that people
have no conception of the horror of being
raped " She describes how, in her
freshman year at Stanford, a male student
in her dormitory said he "didn't see why
rape was such a crime She explains that
one of the most damaging attitudes is the
prevalent myth that women have a secret
"rape wish "
Tonies says she feels that programs like
"Working Against Rape" are important so
that people can correct their mistaken at
titudes about rape But the final result de
pends on a woman's own strength and on
her capabilities for action Tonies says that
the program is designed "to reaffirm and
develop women's strength rather than
their dependence on men's strength and
protection, which is fostered bv a culture
which socializes us to be fearful,"
After all. Tonies says, "We shouldn't
have to freak out every time we're alone "
Representatives of Stanford women's
group have been meeting since late March
to plan a week-long program of activities,
called "Working Against Rape "
The program, which is being coordi
nated by the Office of Student Activities, is
scheduled for October 5-9 of the coming
autumn quarter.
The program will feature the following:
• A symposium on rape prevention and
the effect of the fear of rape on women. At
least two of the symposium's speakers
have been selected They are Pauline Bart
of the University of Illinois, and Stephanie
Riger of Lake Forest College.
Bart has recently published a major
study comparing strategies used by wom
en who were attacked and were able to
avoid being raped and those who were not
able to avoid being raped
Riger has done research on the effect of
fear of rape on women's lives.
The program organizers are still trying
to find one member of the Stanford faculty
and one graduate student to take part in the
symposium.
• A discussion on issues of self-defense
for women and demonstrations by various
self-defense groups on campus.
