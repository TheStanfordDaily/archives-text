## Hollywood stars avoid drug inquiry 
### Washington Post 
Los Angeles â€” Hollywood
personalities Wednesday de
nounced and boycotted a con
troversial congressional com
mittee whose hearings here
have been characterized as a
"witch hunt" to identify users
of cocaine and other drugs in the
entertainment industry.
At the opening of two days of
hearings by the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse
and Control, committee mem
bers denied the "witch hunt"
charges and heard testimony
that among cities, Los Angeles
is a major consumer of drugs,
with $300 million in illegal co
caine sales alone.
Many celebrities expected to
testify yesterday have declined.
Federal law enforcement of
ficials dealing with drug traf
ficking here have said that the
huge salaries of entertainment
industry lawyers, producers, di
rectors and performers have
helped create a booming busi
ness for expensive and usually
non-addictive drugs such as co
caine.
Expensive habit
"One Beverly Hills physician
reported clients spending up to
$300,000 per year on their co
caine habits," Los Angeles po
lice narcotics division com
mander Robert Blanchard said
in a statement to the commit
tee.
Grant Tinker, whose MTM
company produces the tele
vision shows "Lou Grant,"

"The White Shadow" and "Hill
Street Blues," said he decided
against testifying because he
concluded that the committee
"could not help asking who
snorts" cocaine and that he had
no useful information about
that.
"I am absolutely sure that co
caine use is no more of a prob
lem here than it is on Capitol
Hill," Tinker said.
Coke provides contracts
In an interview, Tinker was
critical of two recent articles in
TV Guide magazine that sug
gested television and movie
deals sometimes depended on
the producer's ability to provide
entertainment executives with
cocaine.
"They suggested that in order
to sell a program I have to supp
ly National Broadcasting Com
pany President Fred Silverman
with cocaine, and that's patent
ly ridiculous," Tinker said.
One of the most outspoken
critics of the committee, Lou
Grant star Edward Asner, has
charged the panel with opening
a vendetta similar to the anti
communist crusade in Holly
wood in the early 19505.
Political maneuver?
Asner charged that commit
tee member Robert Dornan (R-
Calif.) wants to punish movie in
dustry supporters of his two
time Democratic opponent,
Carey Peck, son of movie star
Gregory Peck. Dornan denied
the charge, and committee
chairman Leo Zeferetti (D-

N.Y.) said any suggestion the
committee was "engaged in
some sort of witch hunt or in
quisition ... is simply not
true."
Committee staff members
said that despite the defections
of many potential witnesses be
cause of publicity about the
hearings, they expected actors
Dennis Weaver and Greg Morris
to testify yesterday.
Actress Cathy Lee Crosby,
who had initially welcomed an
informal committee look at the
drug situation here, said
Wednesday that she had
withdrawn because "media
hype and sensationalism be
came more important than find

ing the solution to the problem."
Witnesses ranging from Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley
and California Attorney Gener
al George Deukmejian to police,
Coast Guard and customs of
ficials told the committee
Wednesday that drug abuse af
fects all age, ethnic and income
groups and may be involved in
more than half of the crimes in
the area.
Drug enforcement officials
testified that they seize only
about 10 percent of drugs enter
ing the area. They traced the co
caine trail from growers in Peru
and Bolivia to refiners in Colom
bia and then to Mexico for
shipment by air or sea across
the border.
