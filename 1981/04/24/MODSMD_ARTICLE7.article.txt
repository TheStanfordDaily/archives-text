# Atlanta 'witness' to be investigated
## 
### 
Atlanta (AP) — Police say they will be able to determine quickly
whether a civil rights group that has come up with an unidentified
"witness" has solved some of the 25 slayings of young blacks that
have plagued Atlanta over the last 21 months.
"I don't consider the nature of the information something that
will take a long time" to evaluate, said Public Safety Commissioner
Lee Brown. He did not say exactly how long it might take. He also
said late Wednesday that police did not have enough evidence to ar
rest anyone.
Roy Innis, staff director of the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE), announced Wednesday his investigators had found a "psy
chopath" they believed responsible for the slayings. Innis said the
investigators also had found a witness who could link the "psy
chopath" to at least six of the killings. He did not identify the wit
ness or detail the evidence.
However, an editor who spent five hours Monday interviewing the
witness said he felt the person's story was "plausible."
"I'm emphasizing that I'm using the word plausible, not believ
able or anything else, but plausible," said John Schaffner, man
aging editor of The Atlanta Constitution.
"I wouldn't literally call this person a witness, but it is a person
that possibly might be able to shed some light" on the investigation,
Schaffner said.
He would not discuss the results of the interview.
"We are very convinced we have broken this case, and we can
prove it," Innis said, producing an envelope he said contained a pic
ture of the "psychopath." Innis, fighting to retain control of the fad
ing civil rights group, would not make the picture public.
However, the New York Daily News quoted Larry Mitchell, a
spokesman for Innis, as saying the CORE suspect was a black man.
Mitchell added the group's investigation indicated a conspiracy in
volving whites.
Innis said his investigators would''collar'' their suspect by 1 p.m.
Saturday if police had not arrested anyone or made some progress
by then. Innis said CORE had the person under surveillance.
"I certainly consider it (Innis' information) important," said
John Glover, special agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office. "We
will be checking it out."
Wednesday night, Atlanta television station WAGA reported that
Innis's witness was a Miami woman who had received information
by telephone from an Atlanta man.
According to the station, the woman said she was told that a black
man and whrte man were responsible for several recent slayings.
Brown declined comment on the WAGA report.
