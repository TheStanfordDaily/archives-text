Angel's cross
Volunteers place a cross in the vacant lot where the body of 12-year-old Angel Lanier was found
last year. The memorial service for Lanier, who was one of the first of a long line of Atlanta
black children to be murdered, was held last weekend prior to a search of a deserted apartment
complex.
