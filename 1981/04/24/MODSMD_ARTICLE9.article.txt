# Wished Reagan had died
## Columnist threatened in wake of anti-Reagan article 
### 
Philadelphia (AP) — Domi
nic Manno made a mistake: He
wished, in public, on paper, for
the death of the president of the
United States. Now he worries
that someone may be wishing
the same for him.
"It's a sobering thought.
There are 20 people out there
that want me dead," the 23-
year-old University of Pennsyl
vania senior said in discussing
the threats he has received
since the appearance in print of
his college newspaper column
commenting on the assassina

tion attempt on President
Ronald Reagan.
"You ddn't worry about the
people who call. It's the people
that don't call. They worry
you," he said, shaking a head
framed by curly black hair and a
beard.
In the weekly column he
wrote for The Daily Pennsylva
nian's op-ed page, Manno said
he set out to portray the national
outpouring of grief and horror
over the Reagan attack as
"somewhat hypocritical" when
so many others suffer violence

every day.
"When the news first broke
with the report that Reagan had
not been wounded, my first re
action was. 'Too bad he missed.
That's the result of sending an
amateur to do a professional
job,' " Manno wrote in the April
1 edition. "Then with the news
that he had been shot, my reac
tion had changed to, 'I hope he
dies.' "
The words seemed to pain
him as he recalled the chain of
events in an interview. "It was a
first reaction. It was a gut reac
tion to the news and it wasn't
well thought-out or rational,"
he said.
"Later, I was surprised I ever
felt that way. I let my hatred for
Ronald Reagan the politician

overwhelm my respect for the
man, which everyone de
serves."
Coming so soon after the
March 30 attempt on Reagan's
life, the words set off a blast of
criticism from readers. The
fallout is still raining down on
him, his family and the univer
sity.
Manno knew something was
amiss when he arrived at the
newspaper office the afternoon
of April 1.
"The phones were ringing off
the hook, which is unusual at
that time of day,"he said. "The
callers would say something
and then hang up. A lot of them
were obscene — your standard
impossible anatomical sugges
tions."

Then, just hours after the col
umn appeared, two Secret Ser
vice agents appeared at the of
fices of the 96-year-old, five
day-a-week paper. They told
Manno they were checking his
background and wanted to know
whether he was a person who
would act out violent ideas.
Callers have plagued Manno's
family, too. His younger brother
has been taunted for being re
lated to "a communist."
Although no criminal action
was taken against Manno, The
Daily Pennsylvanian was not so
lenient. The student board of di
rectors stripped Manno of his
column and he resigned from
the paper. Two other writers
quit the paper in protest.
