Managua, Nicaragua (AP) —
Daniel Ortega Saavedra, leader
of Nicaragua's left-leaning rul
ing junta, says his nation will
accept no more U.S. funds that
have strings attached.
He apparently referred to
Washington's suspension last
month of the final $15 million of
a $75 million economic aid pack
age for Nicaragua. The funds
were cut off after the Reagan
administration accused
Nicaragua of helping to funnel
arms to leftist guerrillas in
neighboring El Salvador.
Ortega told reporters Tues
day that he complained about
the suspension to three U.S.
Democratic congressmen, here
on a fact-finding mission. He
also said he denied Nicaragua
was moving arms to the
Salvadoran rebels.
Commenting on reports here
that the United States will grant
$10 million to Nicaragua to help
it buy grain, Ortega told re
porters, "Nicaragua will not ac
cept any help from the United
States if it comes with condi
tions.
"We have no illusions about
what economic help the new
U.S. administration might
give." he added, without
elaboration.
Sens. Thomas Eagleton of
Missouri, Christopher Dodd of
Connecticut and Rep. Michael
Barnes of Maryland, arrived
here from Costa Rica where
they discussed Central Ameri
can problems with President
Rodrigo Carazo. No details
were released.
