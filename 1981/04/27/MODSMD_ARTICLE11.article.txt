# Research uncovers the story behind Mem Chu's facade
## 
### Tina Essey 
Students and faculty often stop to admire the
grand facade at the front of Memorial Church,
yet very few know the meaning of the Biblical
story it depicts, or the history behind its ex
quisite crafting.
The scene on the facade does not portray
"The Sermon on the Mount," (Matthew 5-7), as
many believe. Instead, the mosaic ol Christ
blessing men, women and children, shows
"The Judgment ot Nations at the End of the
World," taken from Christ's words in praise of
charity.
This historical fragment was discovered by
Gail Stockholm while researching her new
book, Stanford Memorial Church — An Ap
preciative Guide for the Not-So-Casual Vis
itor. Assisted by Don Carlson, director of Uni
versity relations for the Office of Public Af
fairs, and Ftoxanne Nilan, University
archivist, Stockholm conducted more than a
year's worth of exhaustive research into the
letters and papers of Mrs. Leland Stanford.
Following the death of her husband in 1893.
Jane Stanford decided to make the church a
memorial to his honor, just as the entire Uni
versity had been a meorial to their son, Leland,
Jr. According to Stockholm, the widow decided
to decorate the church lavishly, spending more
than $1 million. The mosaics alone cost $97,000.
Because it was a durable, colorful medium
that would not fade in strong sun, she chose a
mosaic for the exterior artwork. Maurizio
Camerino, manager of the Antonio Salviati
studio of Venice was contracted to supervise
the five-year project, and chief artist Antonio
Paoletti was to design the mosaic under his
client's direction.
Stanford wished the scene to depict these
charitable words from the Gospel ot Matthew
(Chapter 25, Verse 34):
"Come, ye blessed of my father; inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
ot the world. For I was hungry, and you gave

me meat; I was thirsty and you gave me drink;
I was a stranger and you took me in; I was na
ked and you clothed me; I was sick and you vis
ited me; I was in prison and you came to me."
The widow's letters reveal that she had
always thought of Christ with his arms "out
stretched in love to others," Stockholm ex
plains. For this reason, she chose "The
Judgment of Nations," which occurs when
Christ welcomes the righteous into Heaven, as
the theme of the mosaic. Paoletti was in
structed to show women as well as men in the
mural.
A highly ornamental mosaic vine, an ancient
art motif called, "the tree of lite," supports
the huge mosaic, and ties in with its figures of
faith, hope and charity. During the Stanfords
time, Stockholm explains, the tree was a sym
bol associated with Christ's healing and com
passion towards the underprivileged. "The
theme of the church, then, is charity," she ex
plains. "It was at the heart of the gift of the in
stitution."
The largest mosaic in America at the time it
was built, the mosaic was too large tor the
Salviati firm to contain in their workrooms. It
was put together for a final inspection in Ven
ice, and then divided into numbered sections
two feet square, crated and sent to New York
by ship, and transported by rail to Palo Alto
where it was worked onto the facade of the
church. Mosaic installers were still adding
final touches two years atter the church was
officially dedicated in 1903.
After the quake of 1906, the church was re
built around a steel framework, and the
smaller windows, carvings and mosaics were
carefully restored. Fortunately, Paoletti's
sketches of the facade had been saved, and
they were invaluable in reconstructing the
scene into the impressive mosaic of today, one
of the most photographed and most marveled
at wonders on campus.

The facade of Memorial Church was completed in 1903 at a cost of $97,000. Fresh research into the
letters of Mrs. Leland Stanford by Gail Stockholm has revealed information about the meaning of
the mosaic and some of the history behind the facade.
