### Carl Johnston 
Former Stanford Chaparral
editor Bruce Handy and two col
leagues may be on their way to
fame and perhaps even fortune
after their new book is published
next spring.
Hellbent on Insanity a Holler
Coaster Ride with the Best Col
lege Humor of the '70s and a
Smattering from the Ms While
Your Bach Was Turned is the
full title of their new book to be
published by Holt. Rhinehart.
and Winston. It is an anthology
of works from college humor
magazines of the disco decade.
"You can refer to it as
H.0.1.R.C.R W . ." quipped
Handy, "But it's still going to be
tough on the little old ladies in
the libraries who have to write
the title out on those little
cards."
Why the Seventies? The edi
tors of the book say that 1978
was a watershed year for cam
pus humor. That period, chiefly
remembered for Star Wars. Bil
ly Carter, and Charlie's Angels,
brought back college mirth, ac
cording to Handy. Sexism be
came popular, and college
parody found its element.
"There was plenty of tits and
ass and potty," said Handy.
The '80s should also be good
for a few laughs, Handy noted
sarcastically, especially with
the Reagan administration and
the various assassinations of
public figures in this country.
The three editors of the book,
Joey Green, and Alan Corcoran,
both former staff members of
the Cornell Lunatic, and Handy
bring with them an impressive
set of credentials to their work.
According to many ob
servers, while Handy was edi
tor, the Chappie's quality im
proved greatly. This year, the
Chaparral was named by News
week one of the nation's leading
college humor magazines.
Green and Corcoran, in addition
to their work at the Lunatic,
both contributed to the best-sell
ing book A Nostalgic Look Hack
at the 'HOs, a very successful
spoof published in 1979. .
"We should get more bucks
from the royalties this time."
said Corcoran.
When asked how much they
were expecting to make from
sale of this book, however, the
three editors blushed demurely.
and refused to answer, except to

say that it was "a handsome fig
ure, " and that they had "all put
down-payments on Jags."
The three met through their
correspondence as editors of re
spected college humor maga
zines. Two summers ago they
met on the East Coast to put to
gether the book
They "really scoured the
countryside" looking for college
humor magazines to contribute
to their book. In the end they
found only 30 such publications,
but these provided enough ma
terial.
When asked whether their
own publications, the ('haparral
and the Lunatic would be dis

proportionately represented in
the anthology, they all nodded
eagerly.
Right now the trio is gearing
up tor a national tour to ad
vertise their book. "We'll be
going on a promo tour," said
Handy, leaning back in his
chair. "You know, Carson, To
day Show. Merv . . lots of blow
jobs."
It seemed at the time of this
interview that the three tanned
and relaxed gentlemen sucking
on their cans of Malt Liquor Bull
were living the easy lite. But,
according to Corcoran, this
Buddha-like calm only hides the
scars from a long period of dis
appointments they experienced

while waiting tor their book to
be accepted by a publisher
Green sent the manuscript to
many publishers but it was re
fused 16 times betore it was
finally accepted, according to
Corcoran Ironically the book
was refused twice by Holt.

Now Holt. Rhinehart. and
Winston likes the triumvirate so
much that the firm has asked
them to do another book
"We're working on a parody
of the "Book of Lists'' said
Handy. "Shopping lists, laundry
lists. Franz Liszts. . . ."
