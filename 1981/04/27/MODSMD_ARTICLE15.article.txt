## Simon Bending Lesson in earthquake survival 
### 
For an hour I lay still in the
dirt, my neck broken and blood
pouring from a gaping wound
behind my head. Above me, on
the staircase from which I'd
fallen, I could hear a girl moan
ing. her face scorched and her
eyes blinded by fire.
These are some of my initial
experiences as a victim of the
earthquake of '81, which was, of
course, a simulation. My in
juries had been made
gruesomely realistic by cemen
ting a moulded plastic gash' on
the back of my neck — painted
in sufficient detail to turn the
strongest stomach. In addition

to this, some fake blood had
been poured down my back, and
my lips were tinged blue. A doc
tor from the Medical Center
(who was obviously having
great tun inventing ambiguous
symptoms for his colleagues to
diagnose) briefed me on my
condition — numbness and tingl
ing in my hands and slight dif
ficulty breathing.
At the appointed hour. 10
a.m., I hurled myself to the
ground at the foot of a staircase
outside the Engineering Build
ing. Alarms rang, and we pa
tiently waited to be rescued —
and wait we did.
Finally, an hour later a
runner arrived to assess my in
juries — at which point it occurs
to me that I would probably
have been long dead. I was
rolled onto a stretcher with
great concern for every part of
my body except my head. The
runner joked, "We just broke
your neck, eh!"
I was then bumped oft to the
Medical Center in the back of an
old pickup truck, where I was
diagnosed as a possible C-spine
injury. A nurse proceeded to
stabilize me by taping an I.V.
tube to my arm, and giving me
oxygen.
"I won't put this mask right
over your face," she promised
— as she proceeded to do just
that, nearly suffocating me as
the oxygen was turned off. I was
taken to the X-ray room, where

my spine was going to be ex
plored. There the doctor told my
nurse that my head should have
been sand-bagged immediately
to hold it still — she responded
by packing two bottles of rather
cold plasma either side of my
neck, and then totally disap
pearing.
I was beginning to suspect
that I'd been forgotten when a
doctor stopped at my stretcher
and decided that the X-rays
showed no evidence of a break.
"But my neck was broken when
I started," I complained.
A couple of cleaning ladies
seized my trolley and began pro
pelling me in the direction of the
overflow room. This ride was
reminiscent of the Indianapolis
500 — screeching around blind
corners, avoiding other trolleys
by inches.
In the overflow room I was al
ternately diagnosed as having
and not having a broken neck.
Finally, I felt it my duty to point
out that there was a bleeding
gash behind my head which still
hadn't been discovered 2V4
hours after the earthquake.
By lunchtime, I was getting
hungry, and it was clearly time
for a miracle cure. I arose trom
my bed, threw otf my injuries
and walked away, not a little re
lieved that the whole disaster
had been make-believe.
