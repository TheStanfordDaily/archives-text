## Reagan could achieve effective gun control 
### 
Monday, March 30: My taxi
driver from the airport to down
town Seattle chatted pleasantly
about solar energy, jobs in the
shipyards and the unseasonal
weather. It wasn't until he
dropped me oft that the driver
thought to mention that the
president had been shot 30
minutes earlier.
Thursday. April 2: I'm having
morning coffee in a Santa
Monica restaurant, poring over
the news of the attempted as
sassination. A woman across
the aisle sees the headlines and
asks, in a spaced-out tone. "Did
the president get shot, or what?
Is he dead yet? I haven't heard
any news for a couple ot days."
She stirs her coffee.
Americans are becoming
numb to assassinations. Any
American 18-vear old has lived
through the attempted or actual
killings of three presidents and
two presidential candidates, not
to mention several civil rights,
political and cultural figures.
Assassination is becoming
banal and routine, but it's the
worst plague a society can sui
ter. for it eats at the foundation
of all hope for progress.
Assassinations in particular,
and violent crime in general,
can be reduced and prevented.
Here are some ways:
The Secret Service did not
have the name of John Hinckley
in its computerized suspect
files, even though he was de
tained in Nashville on Oct. 9
with three guns, had been there
for three days, and mentioned to
his interrogator that Ronald
Reagan had canceled his Oct. 6
speech there. He was fined only
$62.50 and released.
The same Hinckley was writ
ing bizarre letters to actress
Jodie Foster and even visiting
her Yale dormitory between
the Nashville incident and the
attempted assassination. Cam
pus police had the letters,
signed in his name, as recently
as March 6. A computer check
could have uncovered the fact
that Foster's maniac "lover"
was actually armed and danger

ous.
The president. James Brady
and the others were shot during
a staged "media opportunity,"
not amidst the necessary in
terplay of a democracy. Such
"opportunities," as any journal
ist or politician knows, invite an
unpredictable street scene for
the Hinckleys of the world. Any
would-be assassin knew that
Ronald Reagan customarily
walks from a hotel door to his
limousine, waving and pausing
for a brief word or two with re
porters. There are more secure
ways for a president to have
dialogue with American
citizens.
The registration and in
creased control of handguns is
more vital than ever. True, it
will not stop the dedicated and
desperate killer. But can gun
control hurt? We have had con
trols on the import of Saturday
night specials since '968, but not
on the import of their compo
nent parts. The gun Hinckley
used was produced in Germany
and imported to Miami, where it
was assembled.
Greater penalties and en
forcement eftorts are also
needed for offenses in which
guns are employed. There were
1500 cases in Los Angeles last
year where individuals carried
a gun with no permit, or bran
dished or used a gun to assault
someone. In 37 percent of the
cases, the convicted individual
served no jail time. The average
jail sentence for the rest was
only three to five days.
On the national scene, one
target ol Reagan's budget cuts
is the Treasury Department's
firearms regulatory unit, which
is scheduled to be reduced from
87 persons to 29. In this isolated
example, Monday's assassina
tion attempt is already having a
positive effect: Treasury Secre
tary Donald Regan announced
Wednesday the reconsideration
of this proposed cut.
More important than any spe
cifics. however, is the question
of gun control as a statement of
national sentiment. The oppo

nents of gun control are saying
that a free society has to be an
armed one, and even worse
armed with weapons that are
concealable and can only be
used to kill human beings. The
right to bear certain arms is not
in question, nor the right of
hunters to hunt. What is in ques
tion, is whether society stands
for any controls at all on the
wanton and unregulated dis
tribution of murder weapons.
The gun lobby has confused
freedom with barbarism.
The violence of television and
film must also be blamed. We
now have seen the tragedy of a
cowboy-actor turned public fig
ure encountering the bullet of a
citizen apparently caught up in
movie fantasies.
While being sensitive to the
censorship issue, could we not
ask television stations to at
least justify the "dramatic"
and "cultural" reason for so
much murder and mayhem on
the air? Is it a curtailment on
freedom to insist on ceilings on
the amount of violence our chil
dren are exposed to nightly?
Finally, it has become accep
table, even fashionable, lately
to openly state that much crimi
nal violence is caused by black
youth. While there is some truth
to this statement — and it should
be said without the slightest lib
eral guilt — it is only fair to also
note that our assassins of na
tional figures are all white (ex
cept for Sirhan Sirhan), and in
creasingly middle class.
The killer of Allard Low
enstein was a Stanford gradu
ate. a former civil rights worker
gone mad. The killer of John
Lennon was a quite middle-class
Christian fellow who worked
with refugees before going
berserk. And now we have John
Hinckley, a young vagabond
from a rich corporate family
with ties to the very respectable
George Bushes.
The are too many kooks to
blame the problem on kooks.
And there is too much middle
class violence to blame the
problem on race. Our homicide'

rate is the highest in the world.
We beat our children, our men
kill their wives and most vio
lence is between Americans
who know each other, frequent
ly in their own homes.
We still live out the frontier
culture symbolized in the mov
ies of Ronald Reagan. Don't
fence me in or I'll draw my gun.
Island nations know better
than frontier nations. The
homicide rate in Japan and Eng
land is one per 100,000. while
ours approaches 10 per 100.000.
In an era of limits, frontier in

dividualism will have to be re
placed by human interdepen
dence. The frontier is.gone, yet
we live in a culture that con
tinues to confer status on
badmen.
Reagan is the one — perhaps
only — president who could tell
us to lay our guns aside, that the
Wild West is over, that a new
agenda is in order. I pray he
will.
