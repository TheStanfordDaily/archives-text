## Curb handgun emotionalism 
### 
I'd like to thank Douglas Smith (Daily, Apr. 19)
for providing a public illustration of the main
argument of my recent column on gun control:
that is, that support for gun control rests not on
any acquaintance with the facts but solely on ig
norance and naive emotionalism.
To prove the effectiveness of gun control in low
ering the murder rate, Smith offers as examples
Washington. D.C. and Texas. Metropolitan Wash
ington does have a slightly lower homicide rate
per capita than the state of Texas, and one might
conclude that this results from the tact that D C.
has stricter controls on firearms than does Texas.
However, had Smith chosen different examples
for comparison he could just as easily have
"proved" that gun control increased the murder
rate. For example, New York City, which has one
of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, has
a homicide rate even greater than Texas. Idaho, a
state which is staunchly opposed to gun control,
has a murder rate which is only a fraction of the
murder rate of New York City or Washington,
DC.
By Smith's logic, a comparison of Idaho and
New York City "proves'' that widespread own
ership of firearms is a deterrent to potential
murderers.
The problem with such "proofs by example,"
whether used by supporters or by opponents of gun
control, is that by choosing one's examples
carefully one can "prove" any conclusion one
wishes. A number of lactors besides laws controll
ing guns — rate of urbanization, ethnic makeup.
regional subcultures, etc. — determine the
homicide rate. To take an isolated example and to
ignore all factors except gun laws is hopelessly
naive.
The only realistic approach is to make a careful
statistical study of a large number of examples
taking into account these other factors and at
tempting to discover whether other factors being
equal, gun control laws have any real effect in re

ducing crime.
Although Smith refers to such studies as "mys
tery 'studies,' " implying that they are nonexis
tent (perhaps he intended to state that his knowl
edge of such studies is nonexistent), such studies
have been made. For example, a careful
statistical study conducted at the University of
Wisconsin and reported in Social Problems in Oc
tober 1975 concluded "inevitably, that gun control
laws have no individual or collective effect in re
ducing the rate of violent crime." Other studies
are cited in Kates' Restricting Handguns and in
the report of the Wisconsin study.
It would be unwise to view even such careful
statistical studies as totally conclusive. However,
Smith's claims that such studies don't exist and
that there is a closed case in favor of gun control
are simply false. The existing evidence points
rather strongly to a conclusion exactly opposite to
Smith's hysterical beliefs.
