## Need rape discussion, awareness 
### 
Last quarter, Residential
Education and the Rape Educa
tion Project sponsored the pres
entation of a Canadian
documentary on rape entitled
"A Scream from Silence." The
audience oi about 40 people in
cluded students, staff members,
and members of the communi
ty-
The film begins by portraying
the brutal rape of a young
female nurse by a violent, angry
man. The initial rape scene and
the victim's reactions are used
as the framework within which
the director. Anne Clair Poirier,
analyzes the problem of rape
and why it happens.
In the discussion which fol
lowed the presentation, two ma
jor criticisms of the film were
expressed. The first concerned
the violence and explicitness of
the rape sequence. A tew
viewers felt that the amount of
violence shown was more than
what was necessary to get the
point across. Some men in the
audience admitted being
aroused by the violent rape
scene, which they regretted, but
wanted to acknowledge never
theless.
The ending of the film, in
which the rape victim commits
suicide, was also strongly
criticized. In Poirier's film, af
ter the woman is raped she re
treats from the world. She stops
going to work, she doesn't eat,
she is depressed and lethargic,

she cannot make love with her
former lover, and finally, she
takes her life. Many women who
saw the film felt that such an en
ding perpetuated the myth of
women as helpless victims.
They would have preferred the
filmmaker to show a strong vic
tim who experiences outrage
against the violence and vio
lation of the rape and uses her
anger to reclaim her sense of
self and her strength to act on
her own behalf.
While we share these con
cerns about the film, we want to
draw attention to something
that "A Scream from Silence"
does that no other cinematic
treatment of rape has done
before. In Poirier's film, the au
dience views the rape scene
from the vantage point of the
victim. You literally feel the
rapist closing in to hit the vic
tim, to bang her head against
the walls of the van in which the
rape takes place, to urinate on
her. This film makes very clear
rapists' desire to dominate
women and their hatred of wom
en. The film's rapist says,"I
can't hate you enough." He
vents his frustration at not feel
ing powerful in the world and in
relation to women by beating his
victim, abusing her, and finally
raping her. There is no question,
for anyone viewing this film,
that rape is about power, not
sex.
Admittedly, any one film on

the subject of rape cannot cover
every relevant issue and per
spective. Poirier's choice to fol
low the story ot one rape victim
inherently limited the scope of
topics she could address. The
Stantord-made videotape
"Working Against Rape" ap
proaches the topic of rape from
another perspective. Four vic
tims are interviewed in the
tape. All are young and attrac
tive, like the woman in "A
Scream from Silence."
In the videotape the four vic
tims talk about the circum
stances of their rapes and about
how the rapes affected their
feelings about themselves and
about men. In each case, a peri
od of time has elapsed between
the rape and the interview; you
see the women calm, strong,
capable, whole. The rapes dis
cussed are no less horrible and
upsetting, but they are less im
mediate, less vivid, than the
rape in "A Scream from Si
lence."
In the videotape there is a
form of reassurance in seeing
prior rape victims angry, self
assured, and on the road to re
covery (it a woman can ever re
cover) from their rape ex
periences. In Poirier's film, the
audience is tace-to-face with the
brutality of rape, the complete
denial ot the woman as a person,
the obliteration of the woman's
previous sense of self, and the
use of oppressive power to sub
jugate a woman in a rape situ
ation.
One strength of "Working
Against Rape" is the positive
portrayal of rape victims as
capable — adjusted to and able
to look back upon their ex
perience. Yet the videotape's
weakness is one of the most im
portant strengths of "A Scream
from Silence": never does
"Working Against Rape''
portray so powerfully the fact
that the complete violation of
rape devastates some women's
lives, that some women never
do become whole and strong
again. Some ot the short
comings of "A Scream from Si
lence" could be alleviated by a
period of discussion guided by
experienced facilitators follow
ing the film. The portrayal of
the destructive effect of the
rape of the young nurse, for ex
ample, could be coun

terbalanced by a discussion of
other women's reactions to
being raped, such as those
portrayed in "Working Against
Rape."
Poirier, herself, employed
two innovative techniques in an
effort to overcome these limita
tions and give a more complete,
multi-perspective representa
tion of rape. Throughout the
film conversations between two
filmmakers are interjected into
the unfolding story of the rape
victim's experiences. In this
fashion, both issues that the
Stanford audience found most
troubling were discussed by the
filmmakers as part of the mov
ie. For instance, the camera
cuts away trom the suicide
scene to show the filmmakers
talking about their intentions in
ending the story with a suicide,
and trying to predict how the en
ding is likely to be perceived.
Their comments answered
many questions evoked by the
tilm, even while the film was
still in progress.
In another innovative move,
Poirier interspersed footage of
women in other cultural and his
torical contexts — Vietnamese
women fleeing from their
beseiged villages and a girl in
Africa undergoing clitoridec
tomy, for example this footage
dramatizes the similar ele
ments of various forms of vio
lence against women in the
world. While providing a more
complete analysis of rape, the
inclusion of this footage also
helped to underline Poirier's
message that the phenomenon
of rape is rooted in power, rath
er than sex.
While we recognize the limi
tations of "A Scream from Si
lence," we did want to com
municate what we think the film
has to offer. Most importantly,
"A Scream from Silence" stim
ulated emotional reactions and
much discussion, from which
we all learned more about rape
and about ourselves. Whatever
vehicle is used to raise the issue,
rape is a topic that women and
men at Stanford need to talk
about.
