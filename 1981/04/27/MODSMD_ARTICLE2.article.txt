# Hunger strike causes IRA riot in Belfast

From the Daily wire services
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Hun
dreds of rioters battled hundreds of
police in Belfast and London yester
day in support of jailed IRA guerrilla
Bobby Sands, reported at a skeletal 98
pounds in the 57th day of a hunger
strike.
Prison officials denied widespread
rumors Sands had died, but other
sources indicated he was a few days
from death.
About 500 Sands supporters demon
strated at a subway station and near
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
10 Downing Street residence in Lon
don. Thirty-eight people were ar
rested, and three ambulances carried
away an undetermined number of in
jured.
In Belfast, rioters pitched tire
bombs at a bus depot in the Roman
Catholic Ardoyne district of Belfast.
Then hundreds of youths broke away
from some 6000 people attending a ral
ly for Sands and hurled bricks, stones
and lead pipes at a fortified police
base.
British troops with armored vehi
cles moved into the post in the heavily
Roman Catholic Andersontown dis

trict but made no immediate attempt
to disperse the rioters.
The rally came at the end of three
mile march led by Sands' sister,
Marcella Kelly, who held aloft a
poster-sized photograph of her 27-
year-old brother, who was elected to
the British House of Commons earlier
this month.
If Sands dies, the IRA has pledged a
new terror campaign which Protes
tant militants say could mean civil
war in this British-ruled province,
which has been torn by 11 Vz years of
sectarian violence.
On Saturday, two members of the
European Commission on Human
Rights spent eight hours at the Maze
prison in an unsuccessful bid to per
suade Sands to end his last.
Sands began his hunger strike
March I to demand that the British
government grant political status to
jailed IRA activists. By yesterday, he
had lost 56 pounds of his original
weight.
He refused to see the mediators
from the European Commission.
The two commissioners spent B'z
hours at Maze prison near Belfast to
see whether Sands would support a

formal application for an inquiry into
his case made by his sister.
They said Sands refused to as
sociate himself with the application,
rejecting what could be the last legal
effort to get him to break his "fast to
the death."
Sands sent word to the com
missioners, Carl Norgard of Denmark
and Torkel Opsahl of Norway, that he
would agree to see them only in the
presence of three witnesses of his own
choosing — two members of Sinn Fein,
the political arm of the Provisional
Irish Republican Army, and a fellow
prisoner.

British authorities reportedly re
fused to allow the Sinn Fein members
into the prison.
Meanwhile, Sands issued a
statement through the Sinn Fein office
in Belfast, declaring that his sister
had been misled in her meeting with
Charles Haughey, prime minister of
the Republic ot Ireland, in seeking in
tervention by the human rights com
mission.
Sands, who is serving 14 years tor
possession of firearms, said
Haughey's overtures were a "cynical
and cold-blooded manipulation."
Sands said it was up to the British
government to concede to the IRA
prisoners' demands for various privi
leges, which prison authorities say
would be like giving them the status of
political prisoners, a concession the
British government firmly opposes.
In a statement sent out of the prison
with members of his family, Sands

said, "The issue is basic and fun
damental."
In 1978, four IRA prisoners at the
Maze prison formally petitioned the
human rights commission to find that
the British government had violated a
number of articles of the European
Convention on Human Rights in the
government's dealing with IRA pris
oners.
