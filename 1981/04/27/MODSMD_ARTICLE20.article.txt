1, 2, 3 Draw

I, for one, am really happy to
know that there are enlightened
administrators at Res Ed who
are trying to make it easier for
me to obtain housing. The re
cent reform they have im
plemented is going to be a tre
mendous help.
Now, instead of having to en
dure the "intense" process of
changing my housing prefer
ences after learning what my
draw number is, I can just relax
and accept the assignment

which Res Ed gives me.
Never mind that my draw
number may again be above
3000 or that hundreds of Univer
sity housing spaces are auto
matically unavailable because
of Res Ed's nifty "returning
residence priority" policy. At
least I will have the satisfaction
of having to go through only one
round of an unfair housing sys
tem instead of two.
