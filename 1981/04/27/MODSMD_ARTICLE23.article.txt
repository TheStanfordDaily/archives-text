### Steve Odell 
The Stanford men's tennis team won the Pacif
ic-10 title on the strength of Jetf Arons' and Mike
Falberg's victory in the doubles finals yesterday
afternoon in Ojai. The Cardinal duo beat Blaine
Willenborg and John Davis from UCLA in three
sets, allowing Stanford to take the conference
crown over the Bruins by a single point, 16-15.
Earlier in the day, the Cards also took the
Pac-10 singles finals in an all-Stanford affair be
tween Tim Mayotte and Scott Davis. Mayotte de
fended his No. 1 status on the team in knocking off
Davis in the battle for King of the Hill, 7-6, 6-2.
Stanford and UCLA were tied in points for the
four-day competition heading into the finals of the
doubles, which Arons and Falberg had advanced
to courtesy of their 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 win over USCs
Roger Knapp and Billy Nealon on Saturday.
The Cardinal women's team was also in action
at Ojai, and coach Frank Brennan was fairly
pleased with his team's performance, although
what concerned him the most was the the continu
ing problem that Susy Jaeger is experiencing with
her feet. "All in all, it was a good weekend," Bren
nan said, "but I'm very worried about Susy's
feet."
Jaeger advanced to the round of 16 in the wom
en's intercollegiate singles divison, before losing
in three sets to Santa Barbara's Diane Farrell,
5-7,6-4,6-3, alter being ahead 4-2 in the second set.
"It was touch and go on whether she could even
play (against*Farrell)," Brennan said. "She was
in a great deal of pain, but once she started (the
match), she didn't want to default. She's a tough
kid. It was probably my fault, I shouldn't have let
her play. Her teet were the biggest disappoint

ment of the whole weekend."
There were some bright spots over the weekend
tor the Cardinal women, too. Caryn Copeland ad
vanced to the semis in the women's open singles
competition, before dropping a 7-6, 6-3 decision to
the number one seed. Lindsay Morse. "Caryn had
a pretty good tournament," Brennan said. "She
had a couple of very nice wins."
What pleased Brennan the most, though, in
Ojai, was the play of one of his rookies on the
Farm this year, Michelle Weiss. "She beat two
girls that are really pretty good, and just ran them
right off the court. She never lost her concentra
tion Weiss eventually lost a tough match to 26-
year old pro Tina Mochizuki, 6-3, 7-5. '
"I was also very happy with Chan and Hardey,"
Brennan went on. The doubles team gave the
coach good reason to be pleased, advancing to the
semis in the women's intercollegiate doubles,
before losing to number one USC's number one
team of Linda Siegel and Kelly Henry, 6-2, 6-2

Willenborg and John Davis from UCLA in three
sets, allowing Stanford to take the conference
crown over the Bruins by a single point, 16-15.
Earlier in the day, the Cards also took the
Pac-10 singles finals in an all-Stanford affair be
tween Tim Mayotte and Scott Davis. Mayotte de
fended his No. 1 status on the team in knocking off
Davis in the battle for King of the Hill, 7-6, 6-2.

four-day competition heading into the finals of the
doubles, which Arons and Falberg had advanced
to courtesy of their 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 win over USCs
Roger Knapp and Billy Nealon on Saturday.
The Cardinal women's team was also in action
at Ojai, and coach Frank Brennan was fairly
pleased with his team's performance, although
what concerned him the most was the the continu
ing problem that Susy Jaeger is experiencing with
her feet. "All in all, it was a good weekend," Bren
nan said, "but I'm very worried about Susy's
feet."
Jaeger advanced to the round of 16 in the wom
en's intercollegiate singles divison, before losing
in three sets to Santa Barbara's Diane Farrell,
5-7,6-4,6-3, alter being ahead 4-2 in the second set.
"It was touch and go on whether she could even
play (against*Farrell)," Brennan said. "She was
in a great deal of pain, but once she started (the
match), she didn't want to default. She's a tough
kid. It was probably my fault, I shouldn't have let
her play. Her teet were the biggest disappoint

ment of the whole weekend."
There were some bright spots over the weekend
tor the Cardinal women, too. Caryn Copeland ad
vanced to the semis in the women's open singles
competition, before dropping a 7-6, 6-3 decision to
the number one seed. Lindsay Morse. "Caryn had
a pretty good tournament," Brennan said. "She
had a couple of very nice wins."
What pleased Brennan the most, though, in
Ojai, was the play of one of his rookies on the
Farm this year, Michelle Weiss. "She beat two
girls that are really pretty good, and just ran them
right off the court. She never lost her concentra
tion Weiss eventually lost a tough match to 26-
year old pro Tina Mochizuki, 6-3, 7-5. '
"I was also very happy with Chan and Hardey,"
Brennan went on. The doubles team gave the
coach good reason to be pleased, advancing to the
semis in the women's intercollegiate doubles,
before losing to number one USC's number one
team of Linda Siegel and Kelly Henry, 6-2, 6-2
