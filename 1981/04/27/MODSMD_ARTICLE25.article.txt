New Orleans (AP) — Tom
Watson birdied five times in an
eight-hole stretch, pulled away
from Gil Morgan with a four-un
der-par 68 and successfully de
fended his title yesterday in the
USF&G New Orleans Open.

Sportfolio

Watson, the Masters cham
pion, scored his second victory
of the season by a two-stroke
margin with a winning total of
270, a distant 18 strokes under
par on the 7080-yard Lakewood
Country Club course.

$63,000 from the total purse of
$350,000 and boosted Watson's
earnings for the year to $193,465.
The leading money-winner and
Player of the Year tor the past
four seasons.

career triumphs in only nine
events. And he has successfully

times since the start of the 1977
season.
He set up this one with a
brilliant, eight-under-par 64 in

Saturday's third round that put
him in a tie with Morgan for the

a burst of three birdies in a four
hole stretch over the back nine.
Bruce Fleisher came out of
the pack with a 66 in the bright,
warm, sunny weather and took
second at 272. The runner-up
check of $37,800 was, by far. the
largest ot his 11-year career and
was more than he'd won in any
previous season.
"I haven't been in this posi
tion in a long time. It was nice,"
said the former national
amateur champion who was
forced off the tour most ot last
season by the serious illness of
his wife.
Morgan, playing with Watson
in the last threesome on the
course, slipped back to third at
273. Morgan, who hasn't won
this season but has three fin
ishes of third or better, had a
closing 17, including a birdie on
the last hole.
Barry Jaeckel and Jay Haas
were next at 275. Jaeckel had a
69, Haas 70.
Tied at 276 were Lon Hinkle,
Ron Streck and Fred Couples.

New Orleans (AP) — Tom
Watson birdied five times in an
eight-hole stretch, pulled away
from Gil Morgan with a four-un
der-par 68 and successfully de
fended his title yesterday in the
USF&G New Orleans Open.

Sportfolio

Watson, the Masters cham
pion, scored his second victory
of the season by a two-stroke
margin with a winning total of
270, a distant 18 strokes under
par on the 7080-yard Lakewood
Country Club course.
The triumph was worth
$63,000 from the total purse of
$350,000 and boosted Watson's
earnings for the year to $193,465.
The leading money-winner and
Player of the Year tor the past
four seasons.
The victory also extended
Watson's history"bf acquiring
multiple titles in a few, key
events. The dominant figure in
golf now has scored 21 of his 27
career triumphs in only nine
events. And he has successfully
defended a tournament title six
times since the start of the 1977
season.
He set up this one with a
brilliant, eight-under-par 64 in

Saturday's third round that put
him in a tie with Morgan for the
lead. And he nailed it down with
a burst of three birdies in a four
hole stretch over the back nine.
Bruce Fleisher came out of
the pack with a 66 in the bright,
warm, sunny weather and took
second at 272. The runner-up
check of $37,800 was, by far. the
largest ot his 11-year career and
was more than he'd won in any
previous season.
"I haven't been in this posi
tion in a long time. It was nice,"
said the former national
amateur champion who was
forced off the tour most ot last
season by the serious illness of
his wife.
Morgan, playing with Watson
in the last threesome on the
course, slipped back to third at
273. Morgan, who hasn't won
this season but has three fin
ishes of third or better, had a
closing 17, including a birdie on
the last hole.
Barry Jaeckel and Jay Haas
were next at 275. Jaeckel had a
69, Haas 70.
Tied at 276 were Lon Hinkle,
Ron Streck and Fred Couples.
Hinkle matched Fleisher's 66
for the best round of the day.
Streck shot 69. the rookie
