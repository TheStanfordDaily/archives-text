### Sally Jenkins 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team concluded its 1981 season
Saturday night, against Loyola-
Marymount. The Cardinals
hung on, dragging the contest
out, but were finally overcome
by Marymount 15-9, in the fifth
and final game.
Stanford has a season record
of 7-18 overall, 1-15 in league
play. The loss to Marymount
capped a 15 game losing streak.
Marymount breezed to a 15-5
win in the first game, but were
never to have so easy again. The
Cardinals responded with an ex
hibition of tooth and nail, net
and ball fighting that has
marked them all season as a
team more than capable of an
upset.
They visibly stiffened in the
second contest, refusing to let
Marymount have the crucial
points it needed to put the game,
and probably the match, away.
After a series of nerve racking
exchanges, the Cardinals picked

up the two points they needed
and won the game '8-16.
The third game was equally
as close, with both teams strug
gling to control the momentum
of the match. The Cardinals got
a healthy grip on it when they
won by the same margin of two
points, but a little more quickly
this time. 15-13.
Stanford head coach P'red
Sturm described the Cardinals
main season-long problem as
one of "depth " They were
plagued by the same difficulty
once again, as they couldn't pull
another game out.
They had a chance at winning
the third game, in the end the
turning point of the match. They
let it slip away however. 15-12.
Marymount then made com
paratively short work of Stan
ford in the fourth contest. 15-9.
The depth problem was added
to by the absence of outside hit
ter John McColl. who was ill
with what may have been food
poisoning. Outside hitter Steve

Saeta left last week's contest
against the University of Ha
waii in the midst of the first
game, when he was mys
teriously stricken with what
now appears to be the same ill
ness.
When asked about the coin
cidence and it's possible causes
Sturm replied. "You got me.
It's an element that comes on
very strong and quickly, which
is verv much like food poison
ing."
Sturm is proud of his team,
which has been an underdog
from the first day of practice.
"We knew at the beginning that
we were going to have to have
everybody playing well all the
time, and light for everything if
we were going to have any kind
of success." he said.
"A lot of times we went onto
the court knowing we were
going to lose, that it was almost
decided beforehand, but the
guys did their best every time."
