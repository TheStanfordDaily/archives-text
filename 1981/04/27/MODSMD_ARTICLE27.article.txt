Tom Pagani cannot help but be a con
tented man this week. Who is Tom
Pagani? He's the coach ot the Stanford
track team in throwing events, the male
half of which avenged an early season
loss to Oregon State by defeating the
Beavers, 85-78, at Stanford Stadium Sat
urday.
At the same meet, however, the men
lost to UC-Irvine 101-58, and the Cardinal
women lost a close contest to Oregon
State 77-50.
Pagani's satisfaction stems from the
tact that his strong-armed contingent,
both men and women, won six of seven
throwing events, and provided the
groundwork for a good overall team ef
fort.
Dave Thomson contributed half of the
men's overall individual victories by
winning both the hammer and the discus,

with solid marks of 207-feet-3 inches, and
181-8, respectively.
Brian Holloway put the shot 55-11 to
win that event. The ex-Stanford football
player (offensive tackle) is expected to
go fairly high in the pro football draft,
which will occur this Tuesday and
Wednesday.
For the Cardinal women. Carol Cady
won both the shot-put and discus, and
javelinist Mary Osborne won her special
ty, to complete their own sweep of the
throwing events.
Saturday's meet was by no means just
a lot of throwing and putting tor the
Cardinals. Junior John Schaer used his
patented powerful kick to win an exciting
1500 meter race in a tast 3:46 6. Schaer
appears to be returning to his 1980 form
after starting off slowly this season.
The men's team battle was exciting
throughout the afternoon. After Oregon

State developed a good bit of mid-meet
momentum by winning five straight
events, the tide seemed to change when
their World C«p champion 400-meter
runner Kasheef Hassan was disqualified
from his specialty for false starting.
After that it was a Stanford show, and
the Cardinal distance trio of Bill
Graham. Rod Berry, and Tom O'Neil put
the meet out of reach by sweeping the
beaver runners in the 5000.
In other women's action, Pam Donald
provided early excitement by popping a
school record 20-5.75 in the long jump.
Her jump stands as the third best by a
collegian this season.
Freshman distance runner Ellen
Lyons came back from a leg injury in
style, by upsetting Kim Schnurpfeil in
the 5000 meters with a time of 16:23.8.
The race marked Schnurpfeil's first 198'
loss in the distance.


Freshman Chris Patrick placed fifth overall in the high Jump
