Giscard, Mitterrand face runoff vote
Paris — President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Social
ist Party leader Francois Mitterrand emerged from the
tirst round of voting yesterday in the two-stage French
presidential election as the contenders who will confront
each other in the runoff vote in two weeks
Early returns and computer projections indicated that
the runoff, a replay of the Giscard-Mitterrand race seven
years ago, is likely to be at least as close as in 1974. when
Giscard won by about 450.000 votes.
A count of half of the 30 million votes cast by the elec
torate of 37 million gave Giscard 4 3 million votes, or 29
percent, and Mitterrand 3.9 million votes, or 26 percent.
Later returns from the large cities were expected to
change the picture by one or two percentage points.
Giscard went on television to challenge Mitterrand to
two televised debates — one on economic and social poli
cies and the other on-foreign and domestic policies The in
cumbent indicated a major theme of his runoff campaign
by stressing that "Mitterrand needs Communist votes" to
win.
Regardless of the outcome of the runoff, the French
Communist Party has already come off as the election's
biggest loser, with about 16 percent of the vote, its lowest
showing in 45 years. Significant numbers of Communist
voters apparently voted for Mitterrand rather than Com
munist candidate Georges Marchais to eliminate any dan
ger that he might be displaced by Gaullist candidate Jac
ques Chirac as Giscard's challenger in the runoff between
the top two.
Israelis bomb Lebanese port, kill 15
Beirut — Israeli warplanes bombed Palestinian posi
tions around the southern Lebanese port of Sidon yester
day, and hospital workers said at least 15 persons were
killed and 40 wounded, mostly civilians.
At the same time, in the north, Syrian troops closed
their noose on strategic mountain ridges dominating the
Lebanese Christian heartland and leftist Lebanese forces
mortared the Christian port of Jounieh on the coast below
The fighting north and south marked one of the most vi
olent days in a month-long escalation of hostilities in this
nation that has been the scene of intermittent warfare for
six years. The attacks on the mountains and Jounieh re
called similar threats to the center of Christian territory
at the height of the "975-76 civil war.
Israeli planes carried out the raids against guerrilla
targets north and east of Sidon exactly one week after Is
raeli-backed Christian militia artillery killed 17 Lebanese
civilians in random shelling of the port city 25 miles south
of here. Palestinian positions near Nabatiyeh. once a pros
perous market town 10 east of Sidon and now a guerrilla
stronghold, also were bombed Casualty figures for those
raids were unavailable
Witnesses in Sidon said the Israeli planes came in out of
the afternoon sun from the Mediterranean and spent more
than 40 minutes attacking targets with normal bombs and
delayed-action ordnance that exploded after they flew off.
The raid, described by the official Beirut radio as one of
the heaviest in some time, set several fires, according to
reports from Sidon.
Congress returns, faces budget work
Washington — Members of Congress returning to Wash
ington after a two-week recess face tough decisions on
President Ronald Reagan's proposals to revitalize the

economy.
Many of the lawmakers spent part of the recess talking
with constituents to see how they feel about Reagan's
plans for reducing taxes and the growth of federal spend
ing. Several members received personal calls from the
president, seeking support.
The House and Senate will get another reminder of the
importance Reagan attaches to his economic plan when he
addresses a joint session of Congress tomorrow night
Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee will try to
reach a compromise among themselves today that would
reverse an earlier setback on the president's budget That
compromise would be aimed at reducing the federal defi
cit under the $45 billion level that the committee antici
pates for 1984
Three conservative Republicans who complained that
the projected 1984 deficit was too large joined with com
mittee Democrats earlier this month to defeat a spending
plan similar to Reagan's proposal.
During the week, the House likely will complete the first
phase of its action on the spending reductions. Debate is
scheduled to begin Thursday on a resolution that would set
spending limits for the budget year that begins next Oct. 1
Japan Power Co. admits nuclear leak
Tokyo — The Japan Atomic Power Co.. under fire for
covering up a major radioactive waste overflow last
month, disclosed Saturday that 45 workers were exposed
to radioactive waste in another unreported accident at the
same plant in January.
Power company officials said radioactive materials
dripped from three holes in piping connecting waste-water
condensing tanks Jan. 19 and 21 at the Tsuruga plant 192
miles west of Tokyo.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which
has been investigating plant operations since it was dis
closed recently that 16 tons of radioactive waste water
spilled out of a tank in a March 8 accident, said the leak
was small and confined to the tank room.
Ministry officials said the 45 workmen repairing the pip
ing and cleaning up the waste were exposed to a maximum
of 92 millirems — a measure of radiation — and an average
of 55 millirems per day. The power company safety stan
dard allows exposure of 100 millirems a day.
Officials of the power company said the leak was not re
ported because it was minor. But ministry officials, said to
be "chagrined" by the latest in a series of revelations of
slipshod operations at the plant, ordered an immediate in
vestigation. It was the fourth accident this year that
Tsuruga officials failed to report in what has become a
major scandal in this nuclear-sensitive nation.
Congress receives high poll rating
New York — With a Republican majority in the Senate
and a born-again commitment to cutting government
spending. Congress is getting its highest rating in almost
tour years from the public.
And President Ronald Reagan gets high marks for his
efforts to work with Congress, the Associated Press-NBC
News poll says.
The view of Congress is most favorable, as one might ex
pect, among Republicans, now in control of one chamber
for the tirst time since the 1950s But Democrats and inde
pendents have raised their opinions of the House and Sen
ate as well, showing the shift is not a purely partisan
phenomena.
Twenty-nine percent of those interviewed rated Con

gress' work as excellent or good Fifty percent said only
fair and 15 percent rated the work poor. Six percent of the
1604 adults interviewed by telephone across the country
April 13-14 were not sure.
That's more than double the congressional job ratings
measured in the AP-NBC News polls in late 1979 and 1980
and equals the peak found in the June 1977 NBC News sur
vey
For example, in the January 1980 AP-NBC poll, only 14
percent rated Congress' work as good or excellent; 50 per
cent rated it only fair and 32 percent said it had been poor.
The rest were ndt sure.
In this latest AP-NBC News survey. 32 percent of the
Republicans gave Congress' efforts top marks. That com
pares to 28 percent of the Democrats and 27 percent of the
independents.
For a poll based on about 1600 interviews, the results are
subject to an error margin of 3 percentage points either
way because of such chance variations.

clerk who is 12 years younger than his new wife.

a March 30 assassination attempt, and he flew to Camp
David. Md., on Saturday.

missed one ot his children's weddings. Ronald Jr., 22,
didn't invite his parents to his Nov. 25 wedding to Doria
Palmieri, 29, in a New York judge's chambers.
