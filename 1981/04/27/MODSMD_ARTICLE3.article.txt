# Atlanta to provide safer day camps this summer
## 
### 
Atlanta (AP) — Parents and city of
ficials are hoping that city-run day
camps, with color-coded T-shirts for
each age group, will mean a safe sum
mer for Atlanta's school children and
keep the list of slain young blacks to
25.
The alternative for parents and chil
dfen worried by the string of unsolved
slayings and the disappearance of one
young black since July 1979 is a hot
summer indoors.
In a program that will boost its sum
mer recreation budget by almost $1
million, the city will operate 47 closely
supervised day camps with space for
about 33,000 children aged 6 to 15.
The day camps, which will be open
from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. weekdays,
will be held in existing recreational fa
cilities around the city, which is
dotted with parks.
"We can't do it all ourselves," cau
tioned the city's "Safe Summer" coor
dinator, Richard Monteilh, who said
federal funds were available for about
$400,000 of the program's nearly $1
million added cost. "We can ensure
their safety, but without more help by

the private sector, we can't be as ex
tensive in the range of our programs."
The camps will strive to provide one
counselor for every 15 children and
one professional staffer for every 45
children, Monteilh said
Day campers — blacks as well as
whites — will be issued two T-shirts
each, color-coded to designate their
age group and printed with their
name, group number and camp, said
Roma Harper, Atlanta's deputy com
missioner of parks and recreation.
"It won't be a prison," said Harper,
"but we are going to insulate the chil
dren so they can play without tear of
any strangers."
Strict supervision is planned at the
day camps, and supervisors will take
attendance three times a day. If a
child misses a roll call, his or her pa
rents will be called immediately, the
deputy commissioner said.
In addition to the city-run program,
about 14,000 youngsters are expected
to attend supervised programs in 55
recreation facilities operated by non
profit agencies
