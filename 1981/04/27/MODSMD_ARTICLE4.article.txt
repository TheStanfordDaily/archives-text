# Rep. Lantos cites pilots' letter in opposition to bomber sales
## 
### Pat Carroll 
U.S. Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San
Mateo) Friday released details of a
letter from 12 U.S. Air Force pilots
who said the proposed sale of sophisti
cated F-15 weaponry to Saudia Arabia
would seriously jeopardize American
security if political instability there
resulted in the equipment falling into
Soviet hands.
Lantos said before a meeting of the
Palo Alto Democratic Association
that the letter would be made avail
able to the press tomorrow.
"During the course of the last three
and a half months, no foreign policy is
sue has come before Congress with
more ominous implications than the
proposed sale of our most sophisti
cated weaponry to Saudi Arabia." he
said.
Lantos has been an outspoken critic
of the proposed sales.
The attempt to strengthen U.S. rela
tions with Saudi Arabia and introduce
sophisticated weaponry into that
country was begun in the last days of
the Carter administration and in
herited by President Ronald Reagan
when he took office in January.
Lantos said that the pilots urged
him in the letter to continue his fight
against the sale to the Saudis of "en
hancement packages," equipment
which increases the offensive
capability of F-15 fighter planes.
' Pilots not political people'
"These pilots really are not politi
cal people and do not wish to become
involved in the controversy, but as
U.S. fighter pilots they are concerned
that this ultra-sophisticated equip
ment will get to the Soviet Union,"
Lantos said.
He said that the sale "would direct
ly undermine the physical security ot
the U.S. Air Force and fighter pilots."
"Three years ago I drafted a resolu
tion opposing the sale of the F-15.
which lost," Lantos said. "7'he secre
tary of defense under the Carter ad
ministration pledged that the F-15
never would be equipped with addi
tional offensive capability."
Lantos was referring to a letter

from then-Delense Secretary Harold
Brown written in 1978 to members ot
Congress which was instrumental in
preventing a Congressional vote
blocking the sale of 62 F-15s.
Brown assured them that the
fighter planes would be used for de
fensive purposes only and would not
have special range-enhancing
capabilities and extra armaments
that would pose a threat to Israel.
Lantos said that one of the first de
cisions of the Reagan administration
was to announce the intended sale to
the Saudis, contrary to the pledge of
the previous administration.
According to a report compiled by
reporters at The Washington Post,
President Jimmy Carter, in a last
ditch attempt to garner Jewish voters,
publicly ruled out providing multiple
ejection bomb racks for the F-15s. In a
televised statement last October,
Carter said: ' There will be absolutely
no change in the assurance given to
the Congress in T 978 by Secretary
Harold Brown, acting under my in
structions. on the sale of F- : ss to the
Saudi Arabians."
The I'ost reported that Carter began
to modify his position after he lost the
election, however. Brown and former
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
said in a letter to Senator Carl Levin
(D-Mich ) April 1 that the Carter Ad
ministration "arrived at a tentative
conclusion" that it was "favorably
disposed toward an early and positive
decision" on the sale of F-15 en
hancement packages.
Lantos said that in addition to the
F-15 controversy, the Reagan admin
istration has proposed for sale to the
Saudis the sale ot AWACS (Airborne
Warning and Control System), a high
ly advanced, surveillance system used
to coordinate an air-ground attack

Brown and Muskie reflected early
support by the Carter administration
tor Much « move. '" Wo w<*re also /jj vor
ably disposed toward an eventual
future sale of AWACS," they said.
Sale proposed to Shah
Sale of this system to the Shah of
Iran was proposed several years ago.
according to Lantos. " The only rea
son the sale of AWACS was not com
pleted was because the delivery was
not consummated while he was in
power," Lantos said. "Had it been
(completed), the Ayatollah Khomeini
now would be in possession of our most
highly sophisticated surveillance sys
tem."
According to Brian Rosman. legis
lative assistant to Lantos. AWACS is
the most advanced U.S. surveillance
technology available today.
"AWACS consists ot a 747 with a
radar on top and eight television
screeens inside, all monitoring mili
tary action on the ground and in the
air." Rosman said. "Any instability in
Saudia Arabia could lead to the Sovi
ets getting it."

Lantos said he will continue to op
pose the proposed sale. In a statement
presented before the Congress in Feb
ruary. Lantos said that remarks made
by Saudi officials indicate "that un
less Saudi Arabia receives every so
phisticated. offensive weapon it
seeks. America will have failed this
latest test of friendship, and Saudi
Arabia will retaliate."
Lantos was referrring to a
statement made by the Oil Minister of
Saudi Arabia. "(He) implied that his
country would cut its oil production
unless the United States changed its
Middle East policy." Lantos said
before Congress.
Counsel phase-out
Lantos also addressed the proposed
dismantling ot the Department ot
Energy's (DOE) Office of Special
Counsel which he said '' would result in
a multi-billion dollar rip-off of the
American public," if the Reagan ad
ministration's proposed budget cuts
are allowed to go into effect.
According to Lantos. the DOE's Of
fice of Special Counsel, which was
created to "go into the bowels of the
oil companies, to investigate and pros
ecute violations," has collected $550
million of the $8 billion identified in
overcharges. The Reagan adminis
tration has proposed a $36 million
dollar cut in the Office of Special
Counsel, from $44 million allocated
under the Carter administration to $6
million for the current fiscal year.
"Under the guise ot a budget meas
ure, they save $36 million and the oil
comapanies. who have publicly ad
mitted overcharging, save billions,"
he said. "This is essentially a phase
out budget and a ripping off of the
American public."
Responding to an audience question
about his views on El Salvador, Lantos
spoke of the bill he is cosponsoring to
make aid to El Salvador dependent on
American certification (bat certain
human rights conditions were being
met. He declined to state how he
would vote on a bill that would cut off
aid to El Salvador for one year, and
added that in shaping his opinions.
"Numbers will not sway me. Only the
logic of your argument will sway me."

Lantos said he will continue to op
pose the proposed sale. In a statement
presented before the Congress in Feb
ruary. Lantos said that remarks made
by Saudi officials indicate "that un
less Saudi Arabia receives every so
phisticated. offensive weapon it
seeks. America will have failed this
latest test of friendship, and Saudi
Arabia will retaliate."
Lantos was referrring to a
statement made by the Oil Minister of
Saudi Arabia. "(He) implied that his
country would cut its oil production
unless the United States changed its
Middle East policy." Lantos said
before Congress.
Counsel phase-out
Lantos also addressed the proposed
dismantling ot the Department ot
Energy's (DOE) Office of Special
Counsel which he said '' would result in
a multi-billion dollar rip-off of the
American public," if the Reagan ad
ministration's proposed budget cuts
are allowed to go into effect.
According to Lantos. the DOE's Of
fice of Special Counsel, which was
created to "go into the bowels of the
oil companies, to investigate and pros
ecute violations," has collected $550
million of the $8 billion identified in
overcharges. The Reagan adminis
tration has proposed a $36 million
dollar cut in the Office of Special
Counsel, from $44 million allocated
under the Carter administration to $6
million for the current fiscal year.
"Under the guise ot a budget meas
ure, they save $36 million and the oil
comapanies. who have publicly ad
mitted overcharging, save billions,"
he said. "This is essentially a phase
out budget and a ripping off of the
American public."
Responding to an audience question
about his views on El Salvador, Lantos
spoke of the bill he is cosponsoring to
make aid to El Salvador dependent on
American certification (bat certain
human rights conditions were being
met. He declined to state how he
would vote on a bill that would cut off
aid to El Salvador for one year, and
added that in shaping his opinions.

logic of your argument will sway me."


Tom Lantos
U.S. Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San
Mateo) Friday released details of a
letter from 12 U.S. Air Force pilots
who said the proposed sale of sophisti
cated F-15 weaponry to Saudia Arabia
would seriously jeopardize American
security if political instability there
resulted in the equipment falling into
Soviet hands.
Lantos said before a meeting of the
Palo Alto Democratic Association
that the letter would be made avail
able to the press tomorrow.
"During the course of the last three
and a half months, no foreign policy is
sue has come before Congress with
more ominous implications than the
proposed sale of our most sophisti
cated weaponry to Saudi Arabia." he
said.
Lantos has been an outspoken critic
of the proposed sales.
The attempt to strengthen U.S. rela
tions with Saudi Arabia and introduce
sophisticated weaponry into that
country was begun in the last days of
the Carter administration and in
herited by President Ronald Reagan
when he took office in January.
Lantos said that the pilots urged
him in the letter to continue his fight
against the sale to the Saudis of "en
hancement packages," equipment
which increases the offensive
capability of F-15 fighter planes.
' Pilots not political people'
"These pilots really are not politi
cal people and do not wish to become
involved in the controversy, but as
U.S. fighter pilots they are concerned
that this ultra-sophisticated equip
ment will get to the Soviet Union,"
Lantos said.
He said that the sale "would direct
ly undermine the physical security ot
the U.S. Air Force and fighter pilots."
"Three years ago I drafted a resolu
tion opposing the sale of the F-15.
which lost," Lantos said. "7'he secre
tary of defense under the Carter ad
ministration pledged that the F-15
never would be equipped with addi
tional offensive capability."
Lantos was referring to a letter

from then-Delense Secretary Harold
Brown written in 1978 to members ot
Congress which was instrumental in
preventing a Congressional vote
blocking the sale of 62 F-15s.
Brown assured them that the
fighter planes would be used for de
fensive purposes only and would not
have special range-enhancing
capabilities and extra armaments
that would pose a threat to Israel.
Lantos said that one of the first de
cisions of the Reagan administration
was to announce the intended sale to
the Saudis, contrary to the pledge of
the previous administration.
According to a report compiled by
reporters at The Washington Post,
President Jimmy Carter, in a last
ditch attempt to garner Jewish voters,
publicly ruled out providing multiple
ejection bomb racks for the F-15s. In a
televised statement last October,
Carter said: ' There will be absolutely
no change in the assurance given to
the Congress in T 978 by Secretary
Harold Brown, acting under my in
structions. on the sale of F- : ss to the
Saudi Arabians."
The I'ost reported that Carter began
to modify his position after he lost the
election, however. Brown and former
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
said in a letter to Senator Carl Levin
(D-Mich ) April 1 that the Carter Ad
ministration "arrived at a tentative
conclusion" that it was "favorably
disposed toward an early and positive
decision" on the sale of F-15 en
hancement packages.
Lantos said that in addition to the
F-15 controversy, the Reagan admin
istration has proposed for sale to the
Saudis the sale ot AWACS (Airborne
Warning and Control System), a high
ly advanced, surveillance system used
to coordinate an air-ground attack

Brown and Muskie reflected early

future sale of AWACS," they said.
Sale proposed to Shah
Sale of this system to the Shah of
Iran was proposed several years ago.
according to Lantos. " The only rea
son the sale of AWACS was not com
pleted was because the delivery was
not consummated while he was in
power," Lantos said. "Had it been
(completed), the Ayatollah Khomeini
now would be in possession of our most
highly sophisticated surveillance sys
tem."
According to Brian Rosman. legis
lative assistant to Lantos. AWACS is
the most advanced U.S. surveillance
technology available today.
"AWACS consists ot a 747 with a
