# Reagan to allow input on Saudi arms agreement
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
President Ronald Reagan has de
cided not to send the administration's
controversial arms sale agreement
with Saudi Arabia to Congress until
the House and Senate have had a
chance to make a "major input" in the
plan. Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker said yesterday.
The decision means that the deal to
provide the Saudis with sophisticated
radar surveillance planes probably
will not reach its congressional ap
proval test until late in the year, long
after Israel's national elections and
probably after Congress has con
cluded work on the budget and the ad
ministration's major economic pro
posals.
The decision followed warnings
from Baker (R-Tenn.) and other con
gressional leaders that the entire
package might be rejected by Con
gress if it were brought up for con
sideration now
Baker said the president agreed to
the postponement last Thursday.
In a meeting at the White House.
Baker said, he told the president that
the agreement has strong opposition,
particularly in the Senate, and asked
that Congress be given a chance "to
give advice on the final shape and
form of the package that might be sub
mitted."
"It is my understanding now that
there will be an opportunity for ex
tensive consultation between Con
gress and the State Department and
the Defense Department and perhaps
with the president as well." Baker
said.
Baker was interviewed on the CBS
news program "Face the Nation."
The debate over arms sales to the
Saudi government erupted into a ma
jor political issue in the United States

and triggered angry reaction in Israel
when the administration announced
last week that the package would in
clude five AW ACS radar surveillance
planes. Because ot the planes' ability
to track and control aircraft over a ra
dius of 250 miles, opponents of the sale
contend that Saudi possession of them
would dangerously upset the military
balance in the Middle East.
The sale package finally negotiated
by the Reagan administration actual
ly began when the Carter adminis
tration agreed to sell to the Saudis —
the United States' No. 1 oil supplier —
62 F-15 fighters, outfitted solely for de
fensive missions.
Five AWACS (airborne warning and
control system) planes were added at
the same time that the Reagan admin
istration moved to sell the Saudis addi
tional equipment for the F-15s — so
phisticated air-to-air missiles, long
range fuel tanks and tankers for in
flight refueling.
Baker, who returned last week from
a 10-day visit to the Middle East, said
yesterday that Congress might con
sider dozens or even hundreds of op
tions that might make the proposed
sale less objectionable to Israel.
But he indicated that the president
plans to stick with the strategy of a
single arms package rather than sepa
rating the F-15 and AWACS agree
ments.
In an effort to cool the Saudi reac
tion following the announcement,
White House officials emphasized last
week that more than 400 U.S. civilian
technicians, in addition to about 30 Air
Force personnel, would go to Saudi
Arabia with the AWACS planes.
Their assignments would range
from flight training to contract man
agement, officials said
While Israeli officials did not like

the initial decision to sell F- : ss to the
Saudi air force, they were reported
ready to offer any pro forma opposi
tion. But when AWACS became a part
of the so-called F-15 enhancement
package, the Israeli government re
acted with "unreserved opposition."
Baker said yesterday he believes
that Israel has legitimate reasons for
concern over the prospect of the Saudi
air force gaining AWACS capability,
but he added, "it is also clear that se
curity ot that region extends beyond
just the borders of Israel."
Baker said that while the United
States is mindful of its commitments

to Israel, the arms sale must be con
sidered in the context ot this countrv
overall strategic interests in i
Middle East.
Saudi interest in acquiring the sur
veillance and control aircraft
parently sharpened when the I'nitec.
States dispatched four AWACS planes
to Saudi Arabia during the Irani, n
crisis.
It had been expected ever since the
announcement of the decision that tin
administration would wait until after
the June 30 national elections in I c , jei
before sending the agreement to * on
gress.
