The American people give Presi

approaches the end ot his first 100 days
in office, a Las Angeles Times poll has
found.
It is a strong "B." More than a third
of the public grades the president with
an "A."
The attempt on Reagan's life clear
ly boosted his popularity, the poll also
showed
While the public's impression ot
Reagan has always been high, it had
been declining slightly during the
weeks leading up to the attempted as
sassination on March 30 â€” the 70th day
of his presidency. The assassination
attempt reversed the downward trend
and Reagan's popularity rose signifi
cantly.
In the latest nationwide telephone

cent ot the people said they have a fa
vorable impression of the president, a
10 percent increase over a mid-March
survey.

now in Reagan than it did shortly after
he was elected president last Novem

by the Times poll five months ago.
showed that more people now believe
Reagan will be able to balance the ted
eral budget, cut taxes, make the Unit
ed States stronger militarily than the
Soviet Union, reduce unemployment
and "keep America at peace."
