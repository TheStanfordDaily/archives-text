## Zimbabwe's first anniversary new nation thrives under Mugabe 
### Los Angeles Times 
Salisbury, Zimbabwe — The
first year of independence has
been full of surprises, most ot
them pleasing, for this African
country's 7 million blacks and
200,000 whites.
Prime Minister Robert
Mugabe. 57, a former guerrilla
leader, seems to have per
formed the remarkable feat of
being all things to all people.
Swept into office when his
party won overwhelmingly in
British-supervised elections a
year ago, Mugabe won an
absolute majority in Par
liament, thwarting the plans of
rival black leaders and the bloc
of 20 whites headed by lan
Smith, a former prime min
ister. Smith had hoped to retain
white influence in what he ex
pected to be a divided and
bewildered black government.
Exile
Before Mugabe's return from
exile as a black nationalist,
whites knew only that he was a

Marxist and the commander of
the larger and more aggressive
of the two guerrilla armies that
had fought the Smith govern
ment to a standstill in a bitter
seven-year war. The stalemate
led to a British-negotiated set
tlement, the end of British colo
nial rule, elections open for the
first time to all black citizens,
and the Mugabe landslide.
Formerly known as Rhode
sia, the country was renamed
Zimbabwe as it formally gained
independence under a new flag
on April 17 a year ago. Whites
were filled with foreboding
while blacks danced and sang in
the streets, eager to become
equal to their white former
masters.
Such conflicting hopes and
fears did not augur well for the
stability of the new govern
ment, and from the day that he
took office, Mugabe sought to
assure whites that he believed in
racial conciliation. He appealed
to whites and blacks alike to let
old hatreds fade.
Whites suspicious
Most whites remained sus
picious. They could not believe
that a man who had condoned
guerrilla atrocities could be a
moderate, or that a man who
promised white man's farm
land to landless blacks did not
intend to take revenge for 90
years ot white rule.
Only after many weeks, dur
ing which Mugabe made elo
quent pleas for racial harmony,
did whites begin to voice grudg
ing compliments. Mugabe, they
said, is "smooth . . . dignified
. . . smart ... no mush-mouth
when it comes to speaking Eng
lish."
But while gaining support
from whites, Mugabe was losing
some among his own people.
They wanted jobs, promotions,
more money, housing, farms —
and Mugabe was cautioning
them to be patient. Expecta
tions could not be fulfilled until
the war-ravaged countryside
had been reconstructed, he said.
Recovery
Although political and eco
nomic hazards remain, the
country has recovered surpris
ingly well under Mugabe's lead
ership. His close associates, po
litical observers and whites who
have come to admire his savvy
and intelligence generally agree
on these reasons for his initial
success:
« Mugabe has curbed postwar
unrest in most regions, though
outlaws remain active in a few
remote areas ot the country. In
a major achievement, he has

brought undisciplined former
guerrillas under control.
• Mugabe has rapidly estab
lished relations with Western
nations and those of the Soviet
Bloc as well.
Thirty-four nations now have
diplomatic representation in
Salisbury. They and interna
tional agencies showed their
faith in Mugabe's Zimbabwe
last month by pledging $1.4
billion in grants and loans to
help the new black nation de
velop. Zimbabwe's leaders and
their friends hope it will grow
into an industrial and agricul
tural powerhouse in Africa and
eventually become a challenge
to the racist regime in South
Africa.
♦ Mugabe has persuaded 95 per
cent of the whites who were
here a year ago to stay and
"share in the future." Part ot
the credit tor this goes to his
moderation in introducing so
cialist measures. The govern
ment, for instance, has paid
market value for farms whose
white owners wanted to sell.
• Agriculture, the country's
main source of export earnings.
Little more than a year ago,
farmers were embattled, their
livestock slaughtered and fields
burned by guerrillas. Now there
is a bumper harvest of almost
all major crops. Production is
estimated at 50 percent to 60
percent above last year's. An
ideal growing season helped,
but farmers also praise the
Mugabe government for author
izing a "realistic price struc
ture." Most crops are sold
through government agencies.
* There has been a resurgence
of life in the countryside, which
was badly disrupted by the war.
When Mugabe took office three
months after the war ended,
700,000 children were attending
rural schools. Seven months lat
er there was double that number
of students, mainly children
from embattled tribal areas,
their schools rebuilt and with
teachers and books available.
Warn of trouble
Not everything has gone well
during the first year of the
Mugabe administration, and the
same people who praise the
prime minister for his achieve
ments warn that in some poli
cies he is headed tor new trou
ble.
Economists are concerned at
what they consider to be
Mugabe's misguided idea that
he can rapidly raise Zim
babwe's living standard to the
equal of those in Spain and Por
tugal.
The government is subsidiz

ing food prices by $385 million
this year to make staples cheap
for the poor. At the same time,
Mugabe has increased by 50 per
cent of the minimum wages for
all workers. The result has been
an inflationary spiral that is ex
pected to dampen the present
healthy economy. Last year,
Zimbabwe had a real growth
rate of 10 percent.
Prospective foreign investors
complain about the uncertain
ties in Mugabe's programs to at
tract private capital from
abroad.
Uncertainty over Mugabe's
future course causes major
doubts for potential investors.
Is he really a Marxist, as he pro
fesses to be? If he is, when will
he start to dismantle Zim
babwe's capitalistic system?
