# China's five-year power struggle nears end
##

From the Daily wire services
Beijing — The five-year struggle for suc
cession to Mao Zedong's authority over the
Chinese Communist Party appears nearly
over — with Hua Guofeng clearly out, Deng
Xiaoping moving toward final retirement,
and a coalition of middle-roaders taking
over in late June or early July.
Official sources indicated Thursday that
a climactic formal plenary session of the
party's 340-member Central Committee has
been summoned to seal the transition within
10 weeks. The official press is already pre
paring public opinion for the changes, diplo
matic analysts said.
On the present evidence, there will be no
supreme authority like Chairman Mao, who
died Sept. 9, 1976, nor even a commanding
central figure like the 76-year-old vice
chairman Deng, who has held the divided,
bickering leadership together since 1977
largely by his own sheer grit. The new party
leader, general secretary Hu Yaobang. 65,
will head an 11-man Secretariat and may or
may not receive the title of party chairman
at first.
New definition
Last week newspapers across China
began publishing excerpts of a major
speech by Hu explaining the party's — and
presumably his — new definition of Chinese
style "dictatorship ot the proletariat" to a
secret party meeting. Simultaneously, the
government launched its new Western-style
news magazine. Observation Post, with a
story disclosing that China's senior surviv
ing war hero, Marshall Ye Jianying, had de
clared "the Secretariat is in the forefront,
and the Politburo in the second front."
The plenum, or formal Central Commit
tee session, had been scheduled last sum
mer and successively postponed as argu

ments developed within the leadership and
the country over a broad spectrum of issues.
As recently as February, Chinese sources
were cautioning that the meeting might not
take place until the end ot the year.
These delays were the visible evidence of
a vast subsurface chess game with
thousands of political moves — and not a
few military ones — taking place in every
province as the constituencies jockeyed for
power or survival.
Crackdown on dissidents
The conservative wing, fearful that too
much modernization might undo the admit
tedly strained fabric of the party, won a
crackdown on so-called dissidents. Two
men associated with a short-lived pro-de
mocracy magazine in Beijing were arrested
April 10.
The more progressive wing, which ap
parently believes the Chinese public can be
trusted to "build socialism" without
thought control, scored several crucial
points.
In the subtle but usually legible symbol
ism of Chinese politics, the appearances
were that both extremes (as understood in
the West, the terms "left" and "right"
don't apply to China > were being ruled out ot
tuture influence and the moderates estab
lished in power. As Mao's handpicked suc
cessor and therefore the standard bearer ot
one extreme, Hua Guoteng, had to relin
quish the chairmanship. But atter bitter
contention reaching deep into the army's
ranks as well as the provincial leadership.
Hua reportedly will be dealt with in a "mod
erate" way — retaining a largely mean
ingless title as lowest-ranked party vice
chairman.
Hua's replacement, under the heading of
"personnel," was one of the three main

items originally scheduled for discussion at
the long-awaited Sixth Plenum. The others
were a reassessment of Mao's errors and
contributions to history and the adoption of
drastic measures for combatting China's
economic problems.
Of these, the judgment ot Mao proved
most difficult — so emotional that for a time
it threatened a public split within a Polit
buro that had survived such tense periods as
the overthrow of the Gang of Four, accep
tance ot the United States as a friend, if not
ally, and the costly 1979 invasion of Viet
nam. Apparently the architect of com
promise is Deng, who is expected to become
a member of a new Council ot Senior Ad
visers under a constitutional amendment
now being considered.
The apparently-agreed verdict on Mao
came earlier this month in a long personal
statement by a former army chief of staff,
who said the late chairman made mistakes
but still should be revered for giving China
its national identity and philosophy.
From that point on, things seemed to be
moving into place for the long power strug
gle's final resolution. The latest evidence
was the decision to call the People's Con
gresses of Shanghai and Beijing, the two
biggest cities, into session this week to clear
legislative calendars in time for the party
meeting.
What remains to be seen is the timing ot
the National Party Congress after the Cen
tral Committee Plenum. The Congress
elects the Central Committee and the Cen
tral Committee elects the leadership, so Hu
Yaobang's slate lor Secretariat will not be
finally in place until the new Congress has
met and. in effect, confirms the decision by
the last Central Committee.
