# Doctors speak on nuclear war
## 
### Richard Salas 
At last night's first meeting ot the
new Stanford and Midpeninsula
chapter ot the Physicians for Social
Responsibility (PSR), doctors spoke
of the need for action by all physicians
to prevent the use of nuclear weapons.
The physicians speaking at the
meeting in Fairchild Auditorium at
the Medical Center included Dr.
Herbert Abrams, head ot radiology,
visiting from Harvard; Dr. Perrin
French, assistant protessor (clinical)
of psychology and behavioral sci
ences; and Dr. Jack Frumin, an
anesthesiologist active in the San
Francisco chapter ot PSR.
Abrams, the first speaker, de
scribed the history of the PSR. In 1962,
while there was a debate over the pro
posed atmospheric nuclear test ban
treaty, the first PSR was formed in
Boston. They published a series of
articles on the medical consequences
of nuclear war in the respected New
England ■Journal of Medicine.
The group became inactive after the
test ban treaty was signed in 1963 until
Dr. Helen Caldicott, who later be
came the national president of the
PSR, and other physicians resur
rected it in 1978.
The new PSR was tormed to deal
specifically with the issue of nuclear
weapons and nuclear war. The group
attended symposiums held by the In
ternational Physicians for the Preven
tion of Nuclear War (IPPNW).
The Soviet Union played a major
part at these meetings, which were at
tended by Premier Leonid Brezhnev's
personal physician.
Abrams said, "It was an incredible
learning experience," and expressed
his hope tor the future of the cause.

strate the effects ot nuclear weapons
He began by mentioning the great
power ot a single nuclear bomb and
the danger ot a nuclear war, and
warned of world leaders who have
made "first-use threats."
French said that action can work to
prevent nuclear arms use, such as
when public reaction forced former
President Richard Nixon to drop his
"secret plan" to end the war with
threats of weapon use.
Discussing the consequences of a
nuclear war, French explained how
there would be more patients than the
doctors could handle atter the nuclear
holocaust. Medical facilities would be
destroyed. The survivors would be so
helpless, French said, that he com
mented, "If a doctor really wanted to
help, his most effective approach
would be to go around killing people in
order to spare them a horrible after
math."
Educating people of the potential ef
fects of a nuclear war is one of the
steps toward preventing nuclear dis
aster, French said. It is also impor
tant to make people more aware of the
"psychological denial" behind the nu
clear issue, he added.

For example, he used the analogy of
a football game to illustrate people's
attitudes toward nuclear weapons.
"They think of it as some kind of foot
ball game with Russia — when we
throw a nuclear pass into Russia or
they into us, we don't get a touch
down," French said.
French also spoke of the need for
physicians to push for a change in U.S.
policy on nuclear weapons, similar to
past decisions outlawing chemical or
biological warfare. Since physicians
are in a non-competitive role, they can
form international groups to oppose
nuclear weapon use. The IPPNW. for
example, is bilateral so it can have as
its goal an arms freeze in the U.S. and
the Soviet Union, with an eventual dis
armament.
Frumin said the PSR has not em
phasized how Americans can prevent
nuclear war. "What is the major prob
lem facing us, the Americans, in pre
venting the holocaust?" he asked.
He mentioned how an "anti-Soviet
paranoia" in this country has helped
cause nuclear weapons control to be
stalled in the U.S. Though SPR is
bilateral, physicians in each country
can concentrate on their own govern
ments.

The group became inactive after the
test ban treaty was signed in 1963 until
Dr. Helen Caldicott, who later be
came the national president of the
PSR, and other physicians resur
rected it in 1978.
The new PSR was tormed to deal
specifically with the issue of nuclear
weapons and nuclear war. The group
attended symposiums held by the In
ternational Physicians for the Preven
tion of Nuclear War (IPPNW).
The Soviet Union played a major
part at these meetings, which were at
tended by Premier Leonid Brezhnev's
personal physician.
Abrams said, "It was an incredible
learning experience," and expressed
his hope tor the future of the cause.

French showed slides to demon
strate the effects ot nuclear weapons
He began by mentioning the great
power ot a single nuclear bomb and
the danger ot a nuclear war, and
warned of world leaders who have
made "first-use threats."
French said that action can work to
prevent nuclear arms use, such as
when public reaction forced former
President Richard Nixon to drop his
"secret plan" to end the war with
threats of weapon use.
Discussing the consequences of a
nuclear war, French explained how
there would be more patients than the
doctors could handle atter the nuclear
holocaust. Medical facilities would be
destroyed. The survivors would be so
helpless, French said, that he com
mented, "If a doctor really wanted to
help, his most effective approach
would be to go around killing people in
order to spare them a horrible after
math."
Educating people of the potential ef
fects of a nuclear war is one of the
steps toward preventing nuclear dis
aster, French said. It is also impor
tant to make people more aware of the
"psychological denial" behind the nu
clear issue, he added.

For example, he used the analogy of
a football game to illustrate people's
attitudes toward nuclear weapons.
"They think of it as some kind of foot
ball game with Russia — when we
throw a nuclear pass into Russia or
they into us, we don't get a touch
down," French said.
French also spoke of the need for
physicians to push for a change in U.S.
policy on nuclear weapons, similar to
past decisions outlawing chemical or
biological warfare. Since physicians
are in a non-competitive role, they can
form international groups to oppose
nuclear weapon use. The IPPNW. for
example, is bilateral so it can have as
its goal an arms freeze in the U.S. and
the Soviet Union, with an eventual dis
armament.
Frumin said the PSR has not em
phasized how Americans can prevent
nuclear war. "What is the major prob
lem facing us, the Americans, in pre
venting the holocaust?" he asked.
He mentioned how an "anti-Soviet
paranoia" in this country has helped
cause nuclear weapons control to be
stalled in the U.S. Though SPR is
bilateral, physicians in each country
can concentrate on their own govern
ments.
