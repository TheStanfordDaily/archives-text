# Balloonists race in high- flying competition
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
History's first balloonists were a duck,
a rooster and a sheep, sent alott by the
Montgolfier Brothers in 1783 in a suc
cessful demonstration for King Louis
XVI of France.
Nowadays, the sport is confined most
ly to humans, two dozen of whom
ascended from Mile Square Park, Foun
tain Valley, California, in 11 helium
filled balloons Saturday afternoon on the
first day of the Gordon Bennett Interna
tional Cup Race.
Where they were headed tor, no one
knew, least of all the balloonists, who
cast their fate to mild breezes on a sunny
day before about 10,000 people,
"I hope we don't go north again —
we've seen that country," said Corky
Myers, of Denver, whose team finished
first last year with a 528-mile flight into
Northern California's Mendocino Coun

ty-
This year, Myers and co-pilot Jerry
Tepper showed up with a new trans
parent balloon, Cloud Dancer 11, which
they anchored before takeoff to a 1969
Cadillac.
You can't be too careful. In the 1921
Gordon Bennett, a Belgian entry shot off
into space unexpectedly, taking with it a
soldier who became entangled in the
ropes. The Cadillac never budged, how
ever.
Restauranteur Rocky Aoki, co-pilot of
the Japanese entry, Benihana, was com
peting although he had bruised two ribs
in a collision a tew weeks ago.
"My balloon landed on a parked car
during a test flight," he said.
In the old days, each team in the
Gordon Bennett carried a bottle of cham
pagne, a practice said to have begun
when an 18th century pilot was almost

lynched as an evil spirit by French
peasants after landing. He was saved
when he gave them a bottle of the bubbly.
These days, however, most pilots are
interested above all in winning, and re
gard such cargo as unnecessary waste.
An exception was the French team,
which brought two bottles.
"We like to mix the wine with sand and
pour it on our heads," crewman John
Willis said. "That's why I'm bald."
Poland's team never appeared despite
having sent in an entry.
The Gasbag Gala, as it was dubbed
when it first began in 1906, was staged in
a festive atmosphere that included vin
tage planes buzzing overhead, jugglers,
mimes, a demonstration by karate ex
perts (kept a safe distance from the
balloons) and a troupe of belly dancers.
At one point, the public address an
nouncer declared that the German

balloon was scheduled to lift off in 15
minutes, and added that in the nearby
concession area, the belly dancers had
begun to perform.
A minute later, he said, "The German
balloon's takeoff has been postponed one
hour."
This was the second straight year the
race originated from Fountain Valley, a
city that has come a long way since the
area was known as Gospel Swamps in the
early 1900s.
One of the most unusual balloon deco
rations was a pirate flag carried by Bob
Penny's Ghost Rider. Penny, who has
something of a macabre sense of humor,
also owns the Skull Ranch near Tipton,
Missouri.
He's in the right sport. The Gordon
Bennett balloonists call their post-race
dinner "The Survivors' Banquet."
