# U.S. cited as 'unclear and often contradictory'
## Policy in Middle East criticized 
### Allie Giles 
The United States is the larg
est exporter of military aid to
the Middle East In Saudi Ara
bia alone, military aid has ex
ceeded $5 billion in the last five
years. American investments
totalled $682 million before the
1978 revolution in Iran, and the
United States is still the second
largest exporter of non-military
goods to that nation. In addition,
there are 35,000 Americans liv
ing in Saudi Arabia.
But despite these real and
pertinent interests, U.S. policy
in the Middle East "seems un
clear and often contradictory,"
according to Howard Reed, pro
fessor of Middle Eastern and Is
lamic history at the University
ot Connecticut. Reed spoke at
Bechtel International Center
last Tuesday.
It is necessary for the U.S. to
promote better understanding
between the Western and Islam
ic worlds if relations are to

work, according to Reed.
The U.S. government is cur
rently faced with the task of co
ordinating the conflicting goals
of working toward "peace, jus
tice and stability" in the Per
sian Gulf while also protecting
the oil, military stations and
billions of dollars invested
there, said Reed. This has some
times resulted in an American
foreign policy that is conflict
ing, according to Reed, and he
cited some examples.
In January 1980, President
Jimmy Carter said that the Per
sian Gull was vital to the U.S.
and that the U.S. would be will
ing to take any necessary steps
to preserve peace there. A few
days prior to that announce
ment, according to Reed,
Carter congratulated the com
pilers of a study recommending
that the U.S. keep quiet on the
Persian Gulf issue.
This recommendation was
based on two conclusions. First.

that threatening talk would only
have a destabilizing effect on
the countries involved. Second,
the United States could not back
up its threat, according to Reed.
Despite this, in a complete turn
around, argued Reed, Carter
went ahead with his statement.
Another policy that Reed saw
as misguided is the U.S. em
phasis on protecting oil fields
that are almost "totally in
defensible." There are "ex
tremely difficult problems to be
faced" if attempts are made to
protect a resource that is so
spread out, said Reed. There
are 3000 miles of pipeline; the
perimeter of the five largest
fields totals more than 10,000
miles. It would be impossible
for the United States to protect
such a vast territory, according
to Reed.
"Even if it were the best poli
cy. we don't have the means to
do it â€” for years," said Reed.
Another obstacle in the way of
smoothing out U.S.-Mid East re
lations stems from demo
graphics. Much of the popu
lation in the Middle East is very
young. In some countries fully
half the people are under 15, ac
cording to Reed, and some ex
perts predict that the population

will double in the next 15 years.
These young people represent
"the second generation of rising
expectations" in the Middle
East, said Reed. These rising
expectations will cause dif
ficulties in dealing with these
nations in the future as the
younger Arabs reach maturity.
Reed also stressed the grow
ing role which Islamic faith will
play in foreign affairs. Islam is
the fastest growing religion in
the world, according to Reed.
Fully one-fifth of humanity is
Muslim, in an area that
stretches from Morocco to the
Far East.
Reed concluded with a plea
for a better society.
For the cost ol just two mis
siles, said Reed, a widespread,
effective program could be im
plemented to familiarize U.S.
citizens with Middle Eastern
culture and improve relations
on an individual level. Reed
stressed that people in the U.S.
need to realize and exploit "the
infinite dignity and potential of
each human being."
'' In striving to achieve our na
tional ideals ... we can learn
to cooperate with our brothers
and sisters in the Middle East."
