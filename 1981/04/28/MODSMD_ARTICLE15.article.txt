## We have conservation in space — why not on earth? 
### 
Like a nervous adolescent on
his first date, the space shuttle
Columbia found its way into
space two weeks ago for a quick
peek at the future. I stayed up
late — very late — on that
Thursday with a surprisingly
large group of voyeurs from my
dorm, seeing if the new kid
would go all the way after all.
Almost as if it was offended at
the attentiort, the surly space
craft just sat there, refusing to
budge but stringing us along on
the vainglorious hope that
something interesting would
happen. John Chancellor,
apologizing for the guest's rude
ness. tried to explain its con
struction to the TV audience:
"You see, the great big thing
over there is the main fuel tank
. . . " You tell em, John. Final
ly, we were told of the two-day
delay, in an atmosphere more of
pity than anything else. The new
kid let us down.
Still. I was back on Saturday,
with slightly fewer disciples ot
The Hiffht Stuff for another 4.00
a.m. launch. Even more than
before, this episode ot the mis
sion carried a feeling of in
trusion around it. If you want
anyone in heaven or hell to know
what you're doing, you don't
schedule all the fireworks for
4:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning.
Maybe, after five years of inac
tivity, NASA felt we could catch
the universe oft guard.

Whatever the reason, things
went oft right on (revised)
schedule. The television com
mentators. after their invoca
tions of the Muses of technolo
gy. let "The voice of Columbia"
take over. 4:00 came around, a
ridiculously-shaped object was
thrown off the planet into a
hostile void, and thousands at
the scene cheered.
What did they cheer? The re
porters tell us the dominant
shout was. "We're Number
One!" Great. Nothing likegood
old-giant-step-for-mankind-
sure-but-put-our-flag-on-the-
moon patriotism.
That may sound cynical, but I
really don't mean it to be. To in
terpret the achievement of the
space shuttle as a simplistic
show of scientific strength just
doesn't give anyone who helped
the program the credit they de
serve. And that "anyone" in
cludes all ot us. Even though we
got bored with the Apollo pro
gram after No. 13, even though
our frenzied space race with our
favorite enemy had been trans
formed to the meaningful-but
dull Apollo/'Soyuz hookup, even
though NASA had done nothing
in manned flight in five years,
we as taxpayers paid tor the
program. And as human beings,
we can gather the benefits — not
just on a purely scientific level,
but in terms of inspiration and
possibly in a new feeling in the

American people.
This new feeling, rather than
being a faraway gleam in a
glassy eye. is actually coming
about in other current events.
Last week, just after the Colum
bia left its virgin cruise behind,
the Sierra Club announced a
drive to petition the government
to remove Interior Secretary
James Watt, claiming his lack
ot concern tor the environment
as a crucial factor. Even though
i as far as I know) this public ac
tion is unprecedented, it does
not sound like a radical step
away from rationality.
Watt, simply put. is anti-en
vironment. or at the very least,
substantially in favor of busi
ness development. His goal in
the Reagan Administration, as
he told the San Francisco
Chronicle, is to "inventory the
land, and it doesn't matter it it
is covered with trees, grass, or
water." Sure. And it doesn't
matter that you have to kill a
beaver to get the pelt. Or ex
terminate the Indians to get the
land in the first place. For man
("man" being white, upper
class and God-fearing, ot
course) was given dominion
over the earth, and it is his to
use and subdue endlessly, for we
are the best of all. Doodah. doo
dah.
An Interior Secretary's job,
however, is to care about the en
vironment, and because of that,

the drive to oust James Watt is
reasonable in its own right.
More important, though, is its
possible role as a symptom of
growing awareness in our cul
ture — an awareness of what's
around us and what's going to be
around us it we're not careful.
In this way. I'd like to think of
the space shuttle and the Watt
petitions as events that are
somehow related.
On the most immediate level,
the space shuttle is a break
through in the use ot conserva
tion in space exploration. If we
can recycle newspapers, why
not spacecraft? In addition, the
shuttle gives us new possi
bilities of branching into space,
a possibility steadily growing
with the population and the
spectre oi an overcrowded
earth. Imagine an "Earth Hous
ing Draw 2004" and see what I
mean. "Hey Dave, what'd you
draw?" "I got 5 billion — looks
like I'm otf-planet next year."
Though it's difficult to imagine
any sensible system of non-ter
restrial life, we at least need to
work on opportunities to put
plans in action if the need
arises.
This caring for the future!
though carried out in a different
way than the Sierra Club's con
cern, indicates the same sense
of responsibility as the petitions
to fire James Watt. Un
fortunately we didn't get an in

struction book for the care and
feeding ot Earth when we began
our existence. As a result, we
have to teach ourselves to care
more for the environment that
keeps us alive. This awareness
ot our surroundings is more than
just helping in conservation ef
forts on Earth — with our space
technology, we also must know
how to use our universe wisely.
The space shuttle is a key to
that forthcoming lesson, and the
first class that met in Cape Ca
naveral two weeks ago could be
an inspiration to others to care
where they haven't before. As
the people begin to see their in
finite possibilities in space, they
can also see that they don't have
to be stuck with what's given
them here on the ground. Like
James Watt being given to us as
Secretary ot the Interior.
I hope that the Sierra Club's
petition to depose Watt does
succeed, and that this is just the
beginning of public involvement
in conservation. The universe if
full ot new things patiently wait
ing for our wits to grow sharper.
Perhaps with the space shuttle
firing us up, we can stop our
dull-witted acceptance and
move forward to discover what
we have, what we should keep,
and what we can reach.

substantially in favor of busi
ness development. His goal in
the Reagan Administration, as
he told the San Francisco
Chronicle, is to "inventory the
land, and it doesn't matter it it
is covered with trees, grass, or
water." Sure. And it doesn't
matter that you have to kill a
beaver to get the pelt. Or ex
terminate the Indians to get the
land in the first place. For man
("man" being white, upper
class and God-fearing, ot
course) was given dominion
over the earth, and it is his to
use and subdue endlessly, for we
are the best of all. Doodah. doo
dah.
An Interior Secretary's job,
however, is to care about the en
vironment, and because of that,

the drive to oust James Watt is
reasonable in its own right.
More important, though, is its
possible role as a symptom of
growing awareness in our cul
ture — an awareness of what's
around us and what's going to be
around us it we're not careful.
In this way. I'd like to think of
the space shuttle and the Watt
petitions as events that are
somehow related.
On the most immediate level,
the space shuttle is a break
through in the use ot conserva
tion in space exploration. If we
can recycle newspapers, why
not spacecraft? In addition, the
shuttle gives us new possi
bilities of branching into space,
a possibility steadily growing
with the population and the
spectre oi an overcrowded
earth. Imagine an "Earth Hous
ing Draw 2004" and see what I
mean. "Hey Dave, what'd you
draw?" "I got 5 billion — looks
like I'm otf-planet next year."
Though it's difficult to imagine
any sensible system of non-ter
restrial life, we at least need to
work on opportunities to put
plans in action if the need
arises.
This caring for the future!
though carried out in a different
way than the Sierra Club's con
cern, indicates the same sense
of responsibility as the petitions
to fire James Watt. Un
fortunately we didn't get an in

struction book for the care and
feeding ot Earth when we began
our existence. As a result, we
have to teach ourselves to care
more for the environment that
keeps us alive. This awareness
ot our surroundings is more than
just helping in conservation ef
forts on Earth — with our space
technology, we also must know
how to use our universe wisely.
The space shuttle is a key to
that forthcoming lesson, and the
first class that met in Cape Ca
naveral two weeks ago could be
an inspiration to others to care
where they haven't before. As
the people begin to see their in
finite possibilities in space, they
can also see that they don't have
to be stuck with what's given
them here on the ground. Like
James Watt being given to us as
Secretary ot the Interior.
I hope that the Sierra Club's
petition to depose Watt does
succeed, and that this is just the
beginning of public involvement
in conservation. The universe if
full ot new things patiently wait
ing for our wits to grow sharper.
Perhaps with the space shuttle
firing us up, we can stop our
dull-witted acceptance and
move forward to discover what
we have, what we should keep,
and what we can reach.

Like a nervous adolescent on
his first date, the space shuttle
Columbia found its way into
space two weeks ago for a quick
peek at the future. I stayed up
late — very late — on that
Thursday with a surprisingly
large group of voyeurs from my
dorm, seeing if the new kid
would go all the way after all.
Almost as if it was offended at
the attentiort, the surly space
craft just sat there, refusing to
budge but stringing us along on
the vainglorious hope that
something interesting would
happen. John Chancellor,
apologizing for the guest's rude
ness. tried to explain its con
struction to the TV audience:
"You see, the great big thing
over there is the main fuel tank
. . . " You tell em, John. Final
ly, we were told of the two-day
delay, in an atmosphere more of
pity than anything else. The new
kid let us down.
Still. I was back on Saturday,
with slightly fewer disciples ot
The Hiffht Stuff for another 4.00
a.m. launch. Even more than
before, this episode ot the mis
sion carried a feeling of in
trusion around it. If you want
anyone in heaven or hell to know
what you're doing, you don't
schedule all the fireworks for
4:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning.
Maybe, after five years of inac
tivity, NASA felt we could catch
the universe oft guard.

Whatever the reason, things
went oft right on (revised)
schedule. The television com
mentators. after their invoca
tions of the Muses of technolo
gy. let "The voice of Columbia"
take over. 4:00 came around, a
ridiculously-shaped object was
thrown off the planet into a
hostile void, and thousands at
the scene cheered.
What did they cheer? The re
porters tell us the dominant
shout was. "We're Number
One!" Great. Nothing likegood
old-giant-step-for-mankind-
sure-but-put-our-flag-on-the-
moon patriotism.
That may sound cynical, but I
really don't mean it to be. To in
terpret the achievement of the
space shuttle as a simplistic
show of scientific strength just
doesn't give anyone who helped
the program the credit they de
serve. And that "anyone" in
cludes all ot us. Even though we
got bored with the Apollo pro
gram after No. 13, even though
our frenzied space race with our
favorite enemy had been trans
formed to the meaningful-but
dull Apollo/'Soyuz hookup, even
though NASA had done nothing
in manned flight in five years,
we as taxpayers paid tor the
program. And as human beings,
we can gather the benefits — not
just on a purely scientific level,
but in terms of inspiration and
possibly in a new feeling in the

American people.
This new feeling, rather than
being a faraway gleam in a
glassy eye. is actually coming
about in other current events.
Last week, just after the Colum
bia left its virgin cruise behind,
the Sierra Club announced a
