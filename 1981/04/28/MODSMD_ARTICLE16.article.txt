## 'Haigism' the new foreign policy mindset 
### 
Haigism. if you haven't heard
by now, is the brash new politi
cal force of the 1980s emerging
from our new Secretary ot State
Alexander "I'm in control"
Haig. The United States has wit
nessed the emergence of many
such doctrines before in recent
history, from the Truman doc
trine to McCarthyism to the
Domino theory. All ot them
seemed to be variations and
clarifications of the same basic
anti-communist theme. But the
latter doctrine, it appears,
lacked the intellectual force and
sophistication which Haigism in
its pure form will bring to bear
on the U.S. political scene in the
1980s. Indeed, we may wonder
(as Emily Littella) what is all
this fuss about Reaganism? It
sould be clear by now that
Haigism will provide the real
driving force for the remainder
of the present administration.
Let's examine the major
aspects of this bold doctrine.
In the words of the honorable
Secretary of State, "Soviet pro
motion of violence as an instru
ment of change constitutes the
greatest danger to the world."
In other words, the Soviet Union
— those diabolical instigators of
international terrorism and all
around bad guys — is public ene
my number one. The United
States must stop the diabolical
enemy of the virtuous Western
powers in order to protect the
world from the greatest of all
dangers. Obviously this historic
mission ot United States is the
cornerstone of Haigism.
A simple reiteration of past
doctrines of the 50s and the 60s,
the General infuses this tradi
tional approach with unac
customed vigor. Now the ques
tions are posed in the more fa
miliar dramatic terms of the
1980s Will the United States be
able to tame the Darth Vader of
International politics? Will the
United States find the "force"
necessary to satisfy its mis
sion? These answers to these

questions we can not know for
the time being. Meanwhile, the
General otfers some necessary
clarification on the means and
the assumptions for attaining
those goals.
A major premise ot Haigism
is that misery and social in
justice are no longer viable ex
planations of revolutionary
movements. Because the
solutions to these age old causes
ot revolution are often concep
tually perplexing, the United
States should concentrate its ef
forts on a more tangible foe.
Besides it would be just too hard
to conceive of a proper de
terrence strategy. Starving
peasants are not easily im
pressed by the United States nu
clear arsenal. The Soviet Union
is decidedly an easier enemy in
this respect.
A major method of Haigism is
international crisis fabrication
(not to be confused with the
traditional crisis prevention
strategies of previous adminis
trations). Prime items on the
future agenda might include the
following: Guatemala is start
ing to worry Haigist indoctri
nates. Word has it that
peasants in this Central Ameri
can country are showing so ie
restless tendencies like their El
Salvadoran counterparts — def
inite signs of the nefarious
workings of Soviet agents. In
line with the "white" paper.
State Department officials are
undoubtedly working on a
"blue" paper for Guatemala.
Eventually Haigist disciples
hope to have a different color
paper to cover all threatened
Third World countries, that is if
there are enough colors to cover
all of them.
We need not say much on the
Haigist anti-human rights
stand. Obviously, Haig feels we
need to get rid of the cum
bersome, self-defeating Carter
policy. Just think what the
world would be like if we let the
humanists have their sentimen

tal way! And what about the
rights of right wing dictators to
oppress their people and in this
manner protect the free world?
Haigism correctly points out
that bleeding heart liberals and
humanists are definitely biased
in their preferences.
Alternative interpretations of
apparently well understood
events and documents will be a
key factor in the Haigian
analysis of world affairs. Clear
ly. thanks to the General's
unique interpretive powers,
nuns all over the world have
learned the dangers of careless
ly running a road block. Indeed,
after the General's unique in
terpretation of the constitu
tional succession clause, many
experts have undoubtedly de
cided to undertake a long
needed review in order to pre
pare for the General's next as
sault. For the time being, we
should thank these experts for
pointing out the Secretary of
State is fifth in line after the
president, instead of third as or
iginally claimed.
Personally, if he were 500 th in
line, he would still be too close
for me. I know this view is
biased, but since this column is
being written by a self-right
eous leftist radical, some biases
are inevitable.
Last but not least in our re
view of Haigism is the Gener
al's valiant attempt at restruc
turing the English language.
Shakespeare would have been
envious of the General's unique
mode of self-expression. Rarely
have such commonplace words
and phrases been expressed in
such an eloquent manner The
following illustrative extract ol
Haigian English first appeared
in the Feb. Bth Manchester
(iuardinn and was reprinted in
the April 15-21 issue of the Vil
lane Voice. It seems that the
General may have an ulterior
motive behind his personal in
terpretation of English gram
mar:

"Haig, in Congressional hear
ings before the confirmatory,
paradoxed his auditioners by
abnormalling his responds so
that verbs were nouned, nouns
verbed and adjectives ad
verbized. He techniqued a new
way to vocabulary his thoughts
so as to informationally uncer
tain anybody listening about
what he had actually implica
tioned. At first it seemed that
the General was impenetrably
what at basic clear. This it was
suppositioned was a new
linguistic harbingered by NATO
during the time he bell
wethered it. But close observers
have alternatived that idea.
What Haig is doing, they con
cept, is to decouple the Russians
from everything they are moded
to . . . Experts in the Kremlin
thought they could recognition
the word forms of American
diplomacy. Now they have to
atreshingly language them
selves up before they know what
the Americans are subtling . . .
If that is how General Haig
wants to nervous breakdown the
Russian leadership he may be
shrewding his way to the biggest
diplomatic invent since
Clausewitz. Unless, that is, he
schizophrenes his allies first."

Give Haig credit for a
brilliant strategy here. The So
viets will be confused for years
to come. Oxford and Webster
dictionaries are certain to come
out with a new edition lauding
the new Haigian grammar.
Clearly, it allows more room for
creativity. Writers will also be
indebted to Haig ior years to
come. For my part, I can't wait
for the new school of military
prose to emerge as a driving
force in American literature.
At the present rate of
progress, Haig should master
the ever famous cognitive proc
ess of doublethink by 1984, just
in time for Orwell's predictions.
The main question is whether
the American population will be
intellectually nimble enough to
follow the General's lead. What
ever the outcome, one thing is
certain. The General will enrich
immeasurably our political
heritage. In keeping with A 1
Haig's enhanced status in the
U.S. political environment,
henceforth we should call our
eminent Secretary of State
"Alexander the Haig."

on the U.S. political scene in the
1980s. Indeed, we may wonder
(as Emily Littella) what is all
this fuss about Reaganism? It
sould be clear by now that
Haigism will provide the real
driving force for the remainder
of the present administration.
Let's examine the major
aspects of this bold doctrine.
In the words of the honorable
Secretary of State, "Soviet pro
motion of violence as an instru
ment of change constitutes the
greatest danger to the world."
In other words, the Soviet Union
— those diabolical instigators of
international terrorism and all
around bad guys — is public ene
my number one. The United
States must stop the diabolical
enemy of the virtuous Western
powers in order to protect the
world from the greatest of all
dangers. Obviously this historic
mission ot United States is the
cornerstone of Haigism.
A simple reiteration of past
doctrines of the 50s and the 60s,
the General infuses this tradi
tional approach with unac
customed vigor. Now the ques
tions are posed in the more fa
miliar dramatic terms of the
1980s Will the United States be
able to tame the Darth Vader of
International politics? Will the
United States find the "force"
necessary to satisfy its mis
sion? These answers to these

questions we can not know for
the time being. Meanwhile, the
General otfers some necessary
clarification on the means and
the assumptions for attaining
those goals.
A major premise ot Haigism
is that misery and social in
justice are no longer viable ex
planations of revolutionary
movements. Because the
solutions to these age old causes
ot revolution are often concep
tually perplexing, the United
States should concentrate its ef
forts on a more tangible foe.
Besides it would be just too hard
to conceive of a proper de
terrence strategy. Starving
peasants are not easily im
pressed by the United States nu
clear arsenal. The Soviet Union
is decidedly an easier enemy in
this respect.
A major method of Haigism is
international crisis fabrication
(not to be confused with the
traditional crisis prevention
strategies of previous adminis
trations). Prime items on the
future agenda might include the
following: Guatemala is start
ing to worry Haigist indoctri
nates. Word has it that
peasants in this Central Ameri
can country are showing so ie
restless tendencies like their El
Salvadoran counterparts — def
inite signs of the nefarious
workings of Soviet agents. In
line with the "white" paper.
State Department officials are
undoubtedly working on a
"blue" paper for Guatemala.
Eventually Haigist disciples
hope to have a different color
paper to cover all threatened
Third World countries, that is if
there are enough colors to cover
all of them.
We need not say much on the
Haigist anti-human rights
stand. Obviously, Haig feels we
need to get rid of the cum
bersome, self-defeating Carter
policy. Just think what the
world would be like if we let the
humanists have their sentimen

tal way! And what about the
rights of right wing dictators to
oppress their people and in this
manner protect the free world?
Haigism correctly points out
that bleeding heart liberals and
humanists are definitely biased
in their preferences.
Alternative interpretations of
apparently well understood
events and documents will be a
key factor in the Haigian
analysis of world affairs. Clear
ly. thanks to the General's
unique interpretive powers,
nuns all over the world have
learned the dangers of careless
ly running a road block. Indeed,
after the General's unique in
terpretation of the constitu
tional succession clause, many
experts have undoubtedly de
cided to undertake a long
needed review in order to pre
pare for the General's next as
sault. For the time being, we
should thank these experts for
pointing out the Secretary of
State is fifth in line after the
president, instead of third as or
iginally claimed.
Personally, if he were 500 th in
line, he would still be too close
for me. I know this view is
biased, but since this column is
being written by a self-right
eous leftist radical, some biases
are inevitable.
Last but not least in our re
view of Haigism is the Gener
al's valiant attempt at restruc
turing the English language.
Shakespeare would have been
envious of the General's unique
mode of self-expression. Rarely
have such commonplace words
and phrases been expressed in
such an eloquent manner The
following illustrative extract ol
Haigian English first appeared
in the Feb. Bth Manchester
(iuardinn and was reprinted in
the April 15-21 issue of the Vil
lane Voice. It seems that the
General may have an ulterior
motive behind his personal in
terpretation of English gram
mar:

"Haig, in Congressional hear
ings before the confirmatory,
paradoxed his auditioners by
abnormalling his responds so
that verbs were nouned, nouns
verbed and adjectives ad
verbized. He techniqued a new
way to vocabulary his thoughts
so as to informationally uncer
tain anybody listening about
what he had actually implica
tioned. At first it seemed that
the General was impenetrably
what at basic clear. This it was
suppositioned was a new
linguistic harbingered by NATO
during the time he bell
wethered it. But close observers
have alternatived that idea.
What Haig is doing, they con
cept, is to decouple the Russians
from everything they are moded
to . . . Experts in the Kremlin
thought they could recognition
the word forms of American
diplomacy. Now they have to
atreshingly language them
selves up before they know what
the Americans are subtling . . .
If that is how General Haig
wants to nervous breakdown the
Russian leadership he may be
shrewding his way to the biggest
diplomatic invent since
Clausewitz. Unless, that is, he
schizophrenes his allies first."

Give Haig credit for a
brilliant strategy here. The So
viets will be confused for years
to come. Oxford and Webster
dictionaries are certain to come
out with a new edition lauding
the new Haigian grammar.
Clearly, it allows more room for
creativity. Writers will also be
indebted to Haig ior years to
come. For my part, I can't wait
for the new school of military
prose to emerge as a driving
force in American literature.
At the present rate of
progress, Haig should master
the ever famous cognitive proc
ess of doublethink by 1984, just
in time for Orwell's predictions.
The main question is whether
the American population will be
intellectually nimble enough to
follow the General's lead. What
ever the outcome, one thing is
certain. The General will enrich
immeasurably our political
heritage. In keeping with A 1
Haig's enhanced status in the
U.S. political environment,
henceforth we should call our
eminent Secretary of State
"Alexander the Haig."

my number one. The United
States must stop the diabolical
enemy of the virtuous Western
powers in order to protect the
world from the greatest of all
dangers. Obviously this historic
mission ot United States is the
cornerstone of Haigism.
A simple reiteration of past
doctrines of the 50s and the 60s,
the General infuses this tradi
tional approach with unac
customed vigor. Now the ques
tions are posed in the more fa
miliar dramatic terms of the
1980s Will the United States be
able to tame the Darth Vader of
International politics? Will the
United States find the "force"
necessary to satisfy its mis
sion? These answers to these

questions we can not know for
the time being. Meanwhile, the
General otfers some necessary
clarification on the means and
the assumptions for attaining
those goals.
A major premise ot Haigism
is that misery and social in
justice are no longer viable ex
planations of revolutionary
movements. Because the
solutions to these age old causes
ot revolution are often concep
tually perplexing, the United
States should concentrate its ef
forts on a more tangible foe.
Besides it would be just too hard
to conceive of a proper de
terrence strategy. Starving
peasants are not easily im
pressed by the United States nu
clear arsenal. The Soviet Union
is decidedly an easier enemy in
this respect.
A major method of Haigism is
international crisis fabrication
(not to be confused with the
traditional crisis prevention
strategies of previous adminis
trations). Prime items on the
future agenda might include the
following: Guatemala is start
ing to worry Haigist indoctri
nates. Word has it that
peasants in this Central Ameri
can country are showing so ie
restless tendencies like their El
Salvadoran counterparts — def
inite signs of the nefarious
workings of Soviet agents. In
line with the "white" paper.
State Department officials are
undoubtedly working on a
"blue" paper for Guatemala.
Eventually Haigist disciples
hope to have a different color
paper to cover all threatened
Third World countries, that is if
there are enough colors to cover
all of them.
We need not say much on the
Haigist anti-human rights
stand. Obviously, Haig feels we
need to get rid of the cum
bersome, self-defeating Carter
policy. Just think what the
world would be like if we let the
humanists have their sentimen

tal way! And what about the
rights of right wing dictators to
oppress their people and in this
manner protect the free world?
Haigism correctly points out
that bleeding heart liberals and
humanists are definitely biased
in their preferences.
Alternative interpretations of
apparently well understood
events and documents will be a
key factor in the Haigian
analysis of world affairs. Clear
ly. thanks to the General's
unique interpretive powers,
nuns all over the world have
learned the dangers of careless
ly running a road block. Indeed,
after the General's unique in
terpretation of the constitu
tional succession clause, many
experts have undoubtedly de
cided to undertake a long
needed review in order to pre
pare for the General's next as
sault. For the time being, we
should thank these experts for
pointing out the Secretary of
State is fifth in line after the
president, instead of third as or
iginally claimed.
Personally, if he were 500 th in
line, he would still be too close
for me. I know this view is
biased, but since this column is
being written by a self-right
eous leftist radical, some biases
are inevitable.
Last but not least in our re
view of Haigism is the Gener
al's valiant attempt at restruc
turing the English language.
Shakespeare would have been
envious of the General's unique
mode of self-expression. Rarely
have such commonplace words
and phrases been expressed in
such an eloquent manner The
following illustrative extract ol
Haigian English first appeared
in the Feb. Bth Manchester
(iuardinn and was reprinted in
the April 15-21 issue of the Vil
lane Voice. It seems that the
General may have an ulterior
motive behind his personal in
terpretation of English gram
mar:

"Haig, in Congressional hear
ings before the confirmatory,
paradoxed his auditioners by
abnormalling his responds so
that verbs were nouned, nouns
verbed and adjectives ad
verbized. He techniqued a new
way to vocabulary his thoughts
so as to informationally uncer
tain anybody listening about
what he had actually implica
tioned. At first it seemed that
the General was impenetrably
what at basic clear. This it was
suppositioned was a new
linguistic harbingered by NATO
during the time he bell
wethered it. But close observers
have alternatived that idea.
What Haig is doing, they con
cept, is to decouple the Russians
from everything they are moded
to . . . Experts in the Kremlin
thought they could recognition
the word forms of American
diplomacy. Now they have to
atreshingly language them
selves up before they know what
the Americans are subtling . . .
If that is how General Haig
wants to nervous breakdown the
Russian leadership he may be
shrewding his way to the biggest
diplomatic invent since
Clausewitz. Unless, that is, he
schizophrenes his allies first."

Give Haig credit for a
brilliant strategy here. The So
viets will be confused for years
to come. Oxford and Webster
dictionaries are certain to come
out with a new edition lauding
the new Haigian grammar.
Clearly, it allows more room for
creativity. Writers will also be
indebted to Haig ior years to
come. For my part, I can't wait
for the new school of military
prose to emerge as a driving
force in American literature.
At the present rate of
progress, Haig should master
the ever famous cognitive proc
ess of doublethink by 1984, just
in time for Orwell's predictions.
The main question is whether
the American population will be
intellectually nimble enough to
follow the General's lead. What
ever the outcome, one thing is
certain. The General will enrich
immeasurably our political
heritage. In keeping with A 1
Haig's enhanced status in the
U.S. political environment,
henceforth we should call our
eminent Secretary of State
"Alexander the Haig."
