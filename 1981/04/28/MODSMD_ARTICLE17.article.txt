## Thomas Moore Inching toward conscription 
### 
rhere are many reasons to be
against military conscription:
it is unjust; it is slavery; it
might lead to our sons and per
haps our daughters being sent
off to a foreign land to be killed.
Let me review the reasons usu
ally given for bringing back the
draft.
The first reason is that a draft
ma\ be more fair. Recruiting
needs are not expected to ex
ceed 30 percent of the popu
lation of young men in any
future year. Since volunteers
will fill most of those places, a
draft will only select a few from
the many.
A draft, therefore, would
focus the "obligations of
citizenship" — as proponents of
the draft like to put it — on only

a tew individuals. How would
those few be chosen 9 In the
past, certain individuals have
been exempted, and some pro
visions for exemption would
clearly be required. Those that
are physically and mentally
handicapped would clearly not
be dratted. Bright kids, the chil
dren of upper income parents
will find ways to be exempted.
They can find doctors to certify
their handicaps; they will claim
conscientious exemption; they
will go to Canada. In any new
draft law, Congress will cer
tainly include requirements for
administrative due process.
This will help ensure that indi
viduals are treated fairly by the
system ; but this will expand the
opportunity for middle and up
per-class draft eligible youths to
manipulate the system to their
own advantage.
The ability of the upper
educated to manipulate the sys
tem was obvious during the
Vietnamese war. The medical
exemption rate was twice as
high for whites as for blacks, al
though few believe that white
males are less healthy than
blacks. Thirty percent of quali
fied blacks were drafted, as op
posed to only 18 percent of quali
fied whites.
If a draft could not be fair,
would not universal national
service be the best way to
ensure that the "burden is
shared equally?" To be univer
sal, it would have to include
women, conscientious objec
tors, the handicapped, and the
mentally detective. Surely
many would be excused.
Moreover, what would the
government do with the approx
imately four million young men
and women turning 18 each
year? If they were all forced to
serve in the military, it would be
bloated out of proportion and so
would our military budget. Do
we want to quadruple the size of
the armed forces? If some were
allowed to have civilian jobs,
how would the selection be
made fairly? What type of civil
ian work could this mass of
young do? Since organized labor
would protest any use of con
script labor to compete with or
dinary work, the government
would have to provide make
work jobs. Would they be paid
the minimum wage — a very ex
pensive proposition?
The cost of universal service
would also be high for the tax
payer. The congressional
budget office estimated in 1978
that universal service would
cost over 23 billion dollars per
year. In 1981 dollars this would
be considerably higher. In addi
tion, a new bureaucracy would
have to be established to train,
supervise, and provide jobs for
the approximately 4 million
teenagers that would come un
der government control each
year.
The cost of an nil-volunteer
system is too high. At present
pay and force levels, a return to
conscription would save less
then $500 million, less than one
half of one percent of the De
fense Department's annual
budget.

Larger savings could be
achieved by cutting or not rais
ing military pay, but it is al
ready inadequate. It has de
clined steadily since 1973. Pay
for the lowest ranks is already
significantly below the min
imum wage. The biggest man
power problem faced by the mil
itary is not new recruits but re
taining skilled personnel.
.4 draft irould produce a more
representative armed force. The
military, however, has never
been representative. Even in
World War 11, only 56 percent of
the draft-eligible males served.
Black Americans suffered dis
proportionate casualties in
Vietnam, as did whites in World
War II and Korea — all of these
wars were fought with the draft.
Would the proportion ot blacks
be affected by a return to the
draft? Certainly not. The
number of blacks in the military
began to increase during the
draft era and has grown even
more since.
The quality of the the armed
force is too low under an all-vol
unteer force. By most measures
the quality ot the volunteer
force is as high or higher than it
was during conscripton. Like in
dustrial plants, a mix is needed
in the military. College gradu
ates tor the managerial or of
ficers corps, high school gradu
ates tor plant foremen and ser
geants, and young men with
varying education tor the new
recruits and new assembly line
operators. If the military and
Congress believe that there is a
need to attract more college
bound youths, the draft is not
the answer ; but a generous GI
bill would do it.
Registration and/or the draft
is needed for quick mobilization
in an emergency. Clearly a draft
cannot speed military training;
it takes as long to train a con
script as a volunteer. In past
wars, volunteers, as least in
itially, have been plentiful. Dur
ing the Civil War about one mil
lion men volunteered for the
union army out of a population
of about 10.5 million white
males. During World Warsl and
II volunteering was eventually
banned partly because the ser
vices could not train recruits as
fast as they volunteered. If the
•war is felt as just and right by
the American people, there will
be ample volunteers; if it is not
supported by the public, it
should not be fought.
The problem facing our all
volunteer forces today is gross
ly inadequate compensation.
With such low wages and tough
working conditions, it is surpris
ing that any patriotic volunteers
join the service. Congress
should delete the appropriation
tor registration. It should be re
membered that a peace-time
draft is not in the American
tradition; it only developed in
the post-war period. For the
first 164 years of our history we
relied upon volunteers to man
our armed services in peace
time, and we should continue to
do so.
