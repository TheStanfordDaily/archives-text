# Next year's work-study nearly halved

The University's federally-funded
work-study program will receive less
money from the government next
year, but the decrease cannot entirely
be blamed on President Ronald Rea
gan's budget cuts.
According to Vincent De Anda, as
sistant director of student em
ployment here, next year's allocation
should be about $1 million, a decrease
from this year's allotment of
$1,889,000.
"It could be tight meeting student's
needs next year." De Anda said. "I ad
vise students who really need work
study jobs to get their applications in
early next fall."
Because of the government's al
location formula. De Anda said the de
crease may be due to more schools re
questing money at the state level or
less money being left over after the in
itial conditional guarantees.
The work-study program is funded
by a grant from the federal govern
ment and is designed tor financially
needy students. As part of the aid
package, the student is placed in a job
with a non-profit organization, which
includes all University jobs.
The government grant to the Uni
versity covers 80 percent of the salary
of each work-study job and the Univer
sity must then pay the remaining 20
percent.
De Anda explained that the govern
ment follows three basic steps in its
procedure tor allocating money.
First, each school is conditionally
guaranteed 90 percent of what it re
ceived the previous year.
Second, the remaining funds are
distributed among the states and al
located to schools according to their
percentage use relative to other
schools in the state.
Following these two steps, any lef
tover money is distributed by the gov
ernment based on national percentage
use.
Last year Stanford received
$547,161 from the state allocation, but
this year it will not receive any money
from the that portion. And Stanford's
1980-81 allocation of $349,324 from na
tional leftovers will be reduced next
year to only $38,557.
"It's a decrease we're going to have
to contend with. Departments will
have to look for more funds. It will be
uncomfortable, but it won't be the end
of the world," De Anda said.
DeAnda added that the work-study
program has generally increased dur
ing each of the past five years. In the
i 979-80 school year 706 students were
employed under the program and al
though the figures for this year are not
available yet, De Anda said he be
lieves that the number has risen.
De Anda said that the inclusion of
graduate students into the program
accounts for much of its expansion.
I* ederal guidelines no longer require
that graduate students be paid on an
hourly basis, allowing the University
to pay teaching assistants and resi
dent assistants who qualify, based on
financial need, out of the work-study
funds.
Though the work-study program has
been successful this year, students
have not taken full advantage of it.
"This year we have lots of money,
but still have work-study positions un
filled." De Anda said. "There are
many more positions available than
students wanting to fill them, at the
undergraduate level."
The Student Employment Office
has a two-inch thick binder filled with
descriptions of work-study jobs still
unfilled, and a binder one inch thick
filled with descriptions of non-work
study positions still available.
Work-study offers wide em
ployment possibilities, including

clerical duties, research, light manual
labor, laboratory assistance, tour
guiding, gardening and technical
work.
"It's a seller's market in terms of
labor." De Anda said. "Students can
be choosy."
Students on work-study earn be
tween $3.45 and $4.85 per hour, depend
ing on the job level and the student's
experience in the position.
