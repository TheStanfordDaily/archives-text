## Boyar peddles cultural bike tours 
### Helen Casabona 
In 1976, before entering Stanford, sen
ior Mark Bovar started his biking career
on a 15-month biking trip around the
world. Now he is starting a touring busi
ness of his own.
According to Boyar, Open Road Folk
Tours offers bike tours that feature trad
itional highlights of American culture.
His original intention, said Boyar, was to
offer the tour to Europeans who want to
explore the non-commercial folklore of
America, but because many Americans
are unaware of their own heritage these
tours are open to anyone.
"You go to places like Greece and ex
pect to see people dancing in the streets
but that doesn't happen." he said. So it is
the same for foreigners who come to see
the United States, he added.
Boyar first got the idea to start Open
Road Folk Tours three years ago, when
he was on his last major bike trip in South
America. Passing through a town in Co
lumbia, he came upon a huge carnival
that was "the most exciting thing I'd
ever seen in a foreign country."
Most visitors would have missed such
an event and lost out in their experience
of that country, said Boyar. So when he
returned home, he started setting up
tours for travelers who like the outdoors,
and might otherwise miss out on the
traditional side of America. "None of my
friends were interested in the idea so I
did it on my own," he said.
To date, Boyar estimted that he has
put up approximately $500 since this
project began. Expenses included ar
ranging tours, booking facilities, making
"hundreds of mailings," printing
brochures and promoting his tours by
various other means," he said.

Along with the bike tours. Boyar
planned to run tours for the handicapped,
"so they could see the places they they
would otherwise never get to see," he
said. But he is not adequately qualified to
lead disabled tours, and his reputation is
not yet established, he added.
So he is now a liason between an as
sociate in Sweden who has 300 handi
capped people interested in such a tour,
and Wings on Wheels, a touring company
in Seattle that runs tours for the dis
abled. Northwest Airlines has agreed to
fly the people to Seattle for the Wings on
Wheels tour, he said.
When starting a business, "the hardest
thing to do is legitimize yourself," Boyar
said. "Who would send 300 handicapped
people overseas to just me?" he asked.

It\s a mistake when 'people
forego eating at the little
restaurants that rejlect the
whole mood of the culture'

Boyar has received help from the Con
cil of International Education Exchange
(CIEE) in San Francisco. He is also af
filiated with the Overseas Travel Re
source Center in the Bechtel Interna
tional Center on campus, where more in
formation about Open Road Folk Tours
can be obtained.
Boyar's tours are two to three weeks
long, and cost $30-$35 a day. This includes
all expenses on the road except bike ren
tal, and food while riding through major
cities. "That's where package tours

make their mistake," he said. "They re
quired people to forego eating at the lit
tle restaurants that reflect the whole
mood of the culture," he explained.
Costs that are taken care of in the in
itial price include all of food on the road,
lodging, events, and bike parts as they
are needed, he continued. In order to se
cure all of the lodging and make prepara
tions for the main events on the tours,
people must apply by six weeks before
the tour.
Financially, Boyar hopes to break
even this summer. According to Boyar,
it all goes well, there may be as many as
ten tours next summer. By then he may
have a regular staff of qualified tour
guides. But this summer, he will be lead
ing the tours himself.
Boyar's first tour, which is scheduled
for July 25 through August 10, will start
in Seattle and visit the Indian Cultural
Center. Then it will head over the North
Cascade into the National Park. From
there bikers will ride to a ranch in Win
throp. Washington where they will stay
ior a few days, and finish up the trip in
Omak, Washington. "That's cow coun
try, with rodeos, dancing, an incredible
Indian festival and great gambling,"
said Boyar.
A second tour in September will ride
from northern California, down the coast
through the wine country, to a harvest
festival, and end up in San Francisco.
Future plans for Open Road Folk
Tours include expanding the disabled
tours to people all over Europe and the
United States, said Boyar. At the mo
ment, "I don't have enough qualified
people to handle such tours, but then
we're just starting," he added.
