## George Carlin is still funny, even if he's getting old 
### Trey Ellis 
On a rainy day, after you've gotten lost and
>our car has conked out, all you want to do is
sit in the I ircle Star and let George Carlin
make you laugh. I m glad to say that although
he s no longer the ne plus ultra of stand-up. he
can still make you forget all vour problems
and laugh — a lot.
The show started with Travis and Shook, a
musical-comedv team fnftn Cape Cod. Mass
After a fast, pop song called "Two to Tango."
Travis stepped back up to the microphone and
said. Here s a song we never really cared
for. And before the laughter had died away
they had started singing a verv funnv song
called I Don't Want To Be Jello."
And then came Carlin Wearing a dark shirt
and dark pants, he hopped up on stage and
calmly said. "You ever notice that you don't
get laid much on Thanksgiving? . Because
the coats are always piled up on the bed ." Af-.
ter some intense snickering, he delivered his

standard preface explaining his style of com
edy. "I think up goofy shit that nobody else
thinks about, or stuff that everybody knows
but forgot to laugh about the first time."
This first hour of his two-hour show was fan
tastic. Joke after joke with that patented
Carlin, "D'you ever notice. . ." brought guf
faws. chortles, giggles and snickers every sin
gle time.
"Did you ever notice how people always say
have a nice day!'?.. It puts all the pressure on
you."
"Did you ever notice how your shit is stuff
and their stuff is shit 0 "

Then in one of his funniest routines Carlin
looked deep into the audience and paused,
finally coming out with his "different ways to
freak people out ." Those included going into a
gift shop and asking for your gift, and when
someone offers you a drink in the bar. saying.
"No thanks, but I'll take the money instead "
Unfortunately, after the "ways to freak
people out," his act got slow. Real slow The
last 45 minutes should have been cut in half
"If you actually threw up you'd have to get out
of the way." and a piece about dog farts were
two ot the only jokes up to the high standard
set by the first half. The rest of the jokes were
not stupid or poorly told — they were just not
that funny.
One of the reasons why the last half of the
show slowed so much is that George Carlin is
old From the moment he came on stage, he
was panting, stopping every few minutes to

catch his breath Right before a drawn-out
joke about the foods lett in the refrigerator,
Carlin just babbled, finally admitting that he
was stalling until he got his wind back
Finally, you know a comedian's gotten old
when he repeatedly says, "In my day . . ."
before his jokes.
Hecklers were also a problem Throughout
the evening, drunken slobs would blurt out
some unintelligible garbage. I was hoping for
one particularly nasty heckler to say some
thing, only to be completely faced by a Henny
Youngman retort like, "Isn't it a shame when
cousins marry?' But Carlin ignored the loud
mouths, preferring to slide right into the next
joke. Unfortunately, the heckling towards the
end ot the act threw off some of Carlin's tim
ing. making much of the already weak materi
al entirely humorless.
On the other hand, Travis and Shook han
dled one heckler brilliantly. The jerk had
made some asinine comment, and before he

had a chance to recoil in defense. Travis was
on him with a quick, "Hey. We don't go down
to vour job and tell you how to sweep."
Hecklers and age plague George Carlin, but
on the whole, he rises above both. And no mat
ter what mistakes he makes, no matter what
jokes fall flat, you cannot be too critical of the
comedian who produced some of the best hu
mor this decade has ever heard. His narc who
doesn't know that "shit" is slang for pot. and
his seven (now 10) dirty words you can never
say on television — are truly classics. And the
first half of his act was a solid hour of hilarity
every bit as funny as his older stuff. So per
haps now is just a bad time for George Carlin.
His transition from college cult figure to
satirist of middle-class living has been a rough
one. But it he can produce more jokes like
not getting laid on Thanksgiving," and some
of the others he told, he is well on his way to
once again becoming one of America's
greatest comedians.

once again becoming one of America's
greatest comedians.

On a rainy day, after you've gotten lost and
>our car has conked out, all you want to do is
sit in the I ircle Star and let George Carlin
make you laugh. I m glad to say that although
he s no longer the ne plus ultra of stand-up. he
can still make you forget all vour problems
and laugh — a lot.
The show started with Travis and Shook, a
musical-comedv team fnftn Cape Cod. Mass
After a fast, pop song called "Two to Tango."
Travis stepped back up to the microphone and
said. Here s a song we never really cared
for. And before the laughter had died away
they had started singing a verv funnv song
called I Don't Want To Be Jello."
And then came Carlin Wearing a dark shirt
and dark pants, he hopped up on stage and
calmly said. "You ever notice that you don't
get laid much on Thanksgiving? . Because
the coats are always piled up on the bed ." Af-.
ter some intense snickering, he delivered his

standard preface explaining his style of com
edy. "I think up goofy shit that nobody else
thinks about, or stuff that everybody knows
but forgot to laugh about the first time."
This first hour of his two-hour show was fan
tastic. Joke after joke with that patented
Carlin, "D'you ever notice. . ." brought guf
faws. chortles, giggles and snickers every sin
gle time.
"Did you ever notice how people always say
have a nice day!'?.. It puts all the pressure on
you."
"Did you ever notice how your shit is stuff
and their stuff is shit 0 "

Then in one of his funniest routines Carlin
looked deep into the audience and paused,
finally coming out with his "different ways to
freak people out ." Those included going into a
gift shop and asking for your gift, and when
someone offers you a drink in the bar. saying.
"No thanks, but I'll take the money instead "
Unfortunately, after the "ways to freak
people out," his act got slow. Real slow The
last 45 minutes should have been cut in half
"If you actually threw up you'd have to get out
of the way." and a piece about dog farts were
two ot the only jokes up to the high standard
set by the first half. The rest of the jokes were
not stupid or poorly told — they were just not
that funny.
One of the reasons why the last half of the
show slowed so much is that George Carlin is
old From the moment he came on stage, he
was panting, stopping every few minutes to

catch his breath Right before a drawn-out
joke about the foods lett in the refrigerator,
Carlin just babbled, finally admitting that he
was stalling until he got his wind back
Finally, you know a comedian's gotten old
when he repeatedly says, "In my day . . ."
before his jokes.
Hecklers were also a problem Throughout
the evening, drunken slobs would blurt out
some unintelligible garbage. I was hoping for
one particularly nasty heckler to say some
thing, only to be completely faced by a Henny
Youngman retort like, "Isn't it a shame when
cousins marry?' But Carlin ignored the loud
mouths, preferring to slide right into the next
joke. Unfortunately, the heckling towards the
end ot the act threw off some of Carlin's tim
ing. making much of the already weak materi
al entirely humorless.
On the other hand, Travis and Shook han
dled one heckler brilliantly. The jerk had
made some asinine comment, and before he

had a chance to recoil in defense. Travis was
on him with a quick, "Hey. We don't go down
to vour job and tell you how to sweep."
Hecklers and age plague George Carlin, but
on the whole, he rises above both. And no mat
ter what mistakes he makes, no matter what
jokes fall flat, you cannot be too critical of the
comedian who produced some of the best hu
mor this decade has ever heard. His narc who
doesn't know that "shit" is slang for pot. and
his seven (now 10) dirty words you can never
say on television — are truly classics. And the
first half of his act was a solid hour of hilarity
every bit as funny as his older stuff. So per
haps now is just a bad time for George Carlin.
His transition from college cult figure to
satirist of middle-class living has been a rough
one. But it he can produce more jokes like
not getting laid on Thanksgiving," and some
of the others he told, he is well on his way to
once again becoming one of America's
greatest comedians.
