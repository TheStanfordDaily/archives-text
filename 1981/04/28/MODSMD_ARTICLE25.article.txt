# 'Twelfth Night' not far away
## 
### 
Rehearsals are underway for the Stanford Dra
ma Department's Spring Quarter production of
William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, opening on
Tuesday, May 19, in Memorial Auditorium. Per
formances will continue through Saturday. May
23.
Twelfth Night, which according to scholars
was commissioned by the lawyers of London's
Middle Temple for their Christmas celebration in
1601, is a comedy peopled by characters who
create for themselves lives of deceit and self-de
ception and who are incapable of knowing the
truth about themselves. They are trapped by their
illusions which they prefer to candid self-ap
praisal. The plot, filled with confusing and amus
ing situations, involves disguise, misconception,
and mistaken identity and finally leads to the rec
ognition scene and the play's happy conclusion in
which virfcye is rewarded and folly exposed.
Director Jim Carmody, a third-year doctoral
student in drama, has transported the play to the
early 19th century, a time of aristocratic elegance
in the process of decline. Carmody feels that
Twelfth Night is Shakespeare's most intensely

musical play, where the closest integration of mu
sic with action is achieved. "Not only does the
play begin and end with music in the traditional
sense, but the constant shifting between prose and
lyrical verse creates a lovely music of its own,"
according to Carmody. "The final marriage
dance to Chopin's sth Polonaise is a lively, joyous
dance by exuberant participants which changes to
an elegant but mechanical minuet symbolic of the
change in society." Dan Birnbaum has composed
and adapted the music for the production which
will be played by a trio of piano, violin and cello.
A lecture in connection with the production and
a part of the Drama Forum Series will be given by
Prof. Eleanor Prosser entitled, "Twelfth Night
and the Director," on Wednesday. May 13 at 4:15
p.m. in the Forum Room of Meyer Library. There
will be no charge tor the lecture and the public is
invited.
Tickets for Twelfth Night are on sale at the
Tresidder Ticket Office and at major Bay Area
agencies; by telephone (497-4317) with major
credit cards. General admission is $4; students
and seniors are $1.
