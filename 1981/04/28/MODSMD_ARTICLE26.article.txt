# 'Metro' nothing but charming fluff
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Francois Truffaut s The Last
Metro is such a pleasant,
polished diversion that one may
not realize until quite late that it
isn't really about anything
Truffaut and his co-writer,
Suzanne Schiffman, have
chosen a fabulous setting — the
theater world in Paris during
the Occupation — and as the pe
riod details surface, we wait in
vain for the film to bring us
closer to the experience of those
years.
Catherine Deneuve plays
Marion Steiner, a stage star who
is running her husband Lucas
Steiner s theater in his absence;
a Jew, he is believed to have fled
the country, but in fact he is hid
ing in the cellar of the building,
where he prepares extensive
notes on the production that is
being rehearsed above — he lis
tens through an air vent — and
then communicates them to the
surrogate director (Jean
Poiret). He also intuits, through
the overheard rehearsals, that
Marion has fallen in love with
the new leading man, Bernard
(Gerard Depardieu), who is se
cretly working for the Re
sistance. And when there is no
activity above, Lucas listens to
the rabid anti-Semitic radio
growlings of the most influen
tial critic in Paris. Daxiat
(Jean-Louis Richard).
But The Last Metro (the title
is a reference to the subway the
atergoers had to catch in order
to reach home before the Nazi
imposed curfew) doesn't move
into this provocative milieu;
Truffaut stays determinedly on
the surface. One could almost
say that he was being perverse,
but we've had this kind of sweet,
well-crafted, trivial movie from
him before — Stolen Kisses,
lied and Hoard, l)av for Nitfht
— and so we recognize what he's
doing. These are Truffaut's
crowd pleasers, and judging
from the enthusiasm of the au
dience at The Last Metro the
night I saw it, it may be his first
popular success in a long time.
But I wonder what goes
through Truffaut's mind when
he makes these bits of fluff;
does he realize that they use the
least impressive part of his tal
ent — his gift for being charm
ing — while the insight and ad
ventureousness of a movie like
Wild Child, or even Two English
(iirls, is switched off? The tone
of The Last Metro, despite its
roster of social atrocities per
petrated during the reign of the

Nazis, is amused, lightly wry.
The movie seems to be telling us
that it would be a mistake to
take all of this political intrigue
too seriously — and the fatuous
farce ending (which is a
stylistic intrusion) is the final
confirmation of this message
Some of the moments Truf
taut tinds are lovely, and most
ot the best ones involve Heinz
Bennent as Lucas Steiner Ben
nett is a graceful comic actor
with a streak of ham in him; he
is adept at humorous rage and
frustration — in one scene,
furious because he can't attend
the opening night celebration in
the theater above, he shoves a
scarf into the vent so he won't
have to listen He carries oft ev
erything he tries except tor his
one completely serious mo
ment: his attempt to escape
(until Marion, panic-stricken,
persuades him to stay). Bennett
and a chubby, Renoiresque
character actor named Maurice
Risch, who plays the stage man
ager, come off best in this mov
ie, though Catherine Deneuve,
who looks gorgeous in 1940s
suits and an upright hairdo,

gives a surprisingly warm per
formance (She has a poignant
silent reaction to the news that
the ' free zone'' to which she ar
ranged to send her husband has
just been appropriated by the
Germans.)
Jean-Louis Richard is quite
good as Daxiat, but the role is
impossible — it's all written on
the same note. There are other
talented people in the case,
though they don t have a great
deal to do: Poiret, Andrea Fer
reol. pouty Sabine Haudepin —
whose world-weary eyes con
tradict her adolescent looks,
and whose character, a tight,
ambitious little actress named
Nadine, inspires the funniest
line in the picture Paulette
Dubost, who played the
flirtatious maid in Rules of the
<lame so many years ago. shows
up. too. looking much the same,
though more distinguished
i Who would have guessed that? )
And then there's Gerard De
pardieu. It's hard to think of an
other actor as good as De
pardieu who is constantly work
ing and yet is used so badly over
and over again His first scene
— he tries to pick up a woman on

the street — has a derivative
charm about it (it might have
come out of det Out Your
Handkerchiefs, in which he was
splendid I, but the rest of his per
formance doesn't even manage
that — he seems to be straining,
and so he isn't much fun to
watch His character doesn't
make sense, which is a large
part of the problem: when we
learn of his political commit
ment. it jars so much against
the frivolous buffoon we've been
seeing that we can't believe in
it And the great alleged attrac
tion between him and Deneuve
is not merely hidden — it's sup
pressed beneath the audience's
level of perception
The I.ast Metro is clearly
supposed to be Truffaut's trib
ute to the theatre, just as Dnx
for \'iuht was his hommatfe to
movies, and it's full ot tell-tale
signs, like Lucas's line, "I want
to breathe in the smell of the
stage.' They are similar in an
other way, too: since the play
Marion and Bernard are appear
ing in is as banal as Meet
I'amela, the film-within-a-film
in Da\ for Xiuht. both movies
seem to be, incomprehensibly,
worshipping mediocrity.


Thursday night: guitarist Alex de Grassi will perform in Tresidder's large lounge at 8. Accom
panying de Grassis will be pianist Scott Cossu and percussionist Paul Dunn. Tickets are $2.75

riod details surface, we wait in
vain for the film to bring us
closer to the experience of those
years.
Catherine Deneuve plays
Marion Steiner, a stage star who
is running her husband Lucas
Steiner s theater in his absence;
a Jew, he is believed to have fled
the country, but in fact he is hid
ing in the cellar of the building,
where he prepares extensive
notes on the production that is
being rehearsed above — he lis
tens through an air vent — and
then communicates them to the
surrogate director (Jean
Poiret). He also intuits, through
the overheard rehearsals, that
Marion has fallen in love with
the new leading man, Bernard
(Gerard Depardieu), who is se
cretly working for the Re
sistance. And when there is no
activity above, Lucas listens to
the rabid anti-Semitic radio
growlings of the most influen
tial critic in Paris. Daxiat
(Jean-Louis Richard).
But The Last Metro (the title
is a reference to the subway the
atergoers had to catch in order
to reach home before the Nazi
imposed curfew) doesn't move
into this provocative milieu;
Truffaut stays determinedly on
the surface. One could almost
say that he was being perverse,
but we've had this kind of sweet,
well-crafted, trivial movie from
him before — Stolen Kisses,
lied and Hoard, l)av for Nitfht
— and so we recognize what he's
doing. These are Truffaut's
crowd pleasers, and judging
from the enthusiasm of the au
dience at The Last Metro the
night I saw it, it may be his first
popular success in a long time.
But I wonder what goes
through Truffaut's mind when
he makes these bits of fluff;
does he realize that they use the
least impressive part of his tal
ent — his gift for being charm
ing — while the insight and ad
ventureousness of a movie like
Wild Child, or even Two English
(iirls, is switched off? The tone
of The Last Metro, despite its
roster of social atrocities per
petrated during the reign of the

Nazis, is amused, lightly wry.
The movie seems to be telling us
that it would be a mistake to
take all of this political intrigue
too seriously — and the fatuous
farce ending (which is a
stylistic intrusion) is the final
confirmation of this message
Some of the moments Truf
taut tinds are lovely, and most
ot the best ones involve Heinz
Bennent as Lucas Steiner Ben
nett is a graceful comic actor
with a streak of ham in him; he
is adept at humorous rage and
frustration — in one scene,
furious because he can't attend
the opening night celebration in
the theater above, he shoves a
scarf into the vent so he won't
have to listen He carries oft ev
erything he tries except tor his
one completely serious mo
ment: his attempt to escape
(until Marion, panic-stricken,
persuades him to stay). Bennett

suits and an upright hairdo,

gives a surprisingly warm per
formance (She has a poignant
silent reaction to the news that
the ' free zone'' to which she ar
ranged to send her husband has
just been appropriated by the
Germans.)
Jean-Louis Richard is quite
good as Daxiat, but the role is
impossible — it's all written on
the same note. There are other
talented people in the case,
though they don t have a great
deal to do: Poiret, Andrea Fer
reol. pouty Sabine Haudepin —
whose world-weary eyes con
tradict her adolescent looks,
and whose character, a tight,
ambitious little actress named

flirtatious maid in Rules of the

And then there's Gerard De

other actor as good as De

the street — has a derivative
charm about it (it might have

part of the problem: when we
learn of his political commit
