Violence erupts as Sands nears death
Belfast. Northern Ireland— A booby-trap bomb planted
in a hijacked truck exploded in Belfast yesterday, killing
one policeman and injuring three others The bombing,
claimed in the name of the Irish National Liberation
Army, followed the arrest of 20 prominent supporters of
jailed hunger striker Bobby Sands
An anonymous caller to a Northern Ireland radio station
later claimed responsibility for the blast on behalf of the
terrorist splinter group INLA. which claimed responsi
bility tor the 1979 car-bomb assassination of Conservative
politician Airey N'eave at the House of Commons in Lon
don.
Sands. 27, a convicted Irish Republican Army guerrilla
recently elected to British Parliament, was reported drift
ing nearer to death on the 58th day of his fast at Maze Pris
on. Sands was reportedly drinking mineral water, unable
to digest the fluoride in tap water.
Northern Ireland's security chiefs canceled all police
leave as the British province prepared for widespread vio
lence if Sands dies.
In London. Scotland Yard said a letter-bomb sent to a
Conservative member of Parliament was safely detonated
but that it might be part of a new IRA offensive against
prominent Britons. It was the second such mail-bomb in
three days, and Scotland yard expects more in the days to
come.
Later a mob of 200 youths in the staunchly Catholic Falls
Road area of Belfast, near Andersonstown, stoned police
and hijacked two buses which were set afire, police said.

Rioters dispersed when police moved in
Cease-fire hopes dim in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon— West Beirut, a predominantly
Moslem area, came under heavy shelling for the first time
in five years yesterday in mounting violence rivaling the
worst days of Lebanon's 1975-76 civil war
At the same time, Israeli warplanes caused heavy loss
of life and property in their second straight day of raids
against Palestinian guerrilla positions in southern Leba
non.
In Washington, the State Dept. said a takeover by Syrian
forces of key high points in the mountains of Lebanon has
brought a "major change in the status quo - ' between the
warring parties. The department stopped short of criticiz
ing Syria's move into areas previously held by Christian
militiamen, but cited it as one of the "serious develop
ments which concern us."
The shelling was seen as a retaliation for the bombing of
predominantly Christian areas on Sunday.
The mountain fighting and the rising tempo of shelling in
Beirut appeared to compromise official hopes of a rapid
end to the nearly month-long round of fighting. A sched
uled conference to discuss terms for an end to the war was
reportedly cancelled by the Syrian president.
The renewed Israeli air raids coincided with reports
trom Israel that Prirre Minister Menachem Begin s gov
ernment had warned Syria through diplomatic channels
not to step up its current offensive to wrest .control of
strategic mountain ridges from the Christian militia.
The Christian leadership has been sending out recent
signals that it is disappointed in the level of Israeli help
since the battle for the eastern Christian city of Zahle
began April 1. Only yesterday. Pierre Gemayel. the 76-
year-old leader of the Phalange Party that fields the most
important of the Christian militias, said. "Israel is the
only beneficiary of what is happening - Lebanese killing
each other."
Agnew ordered to repay kickbacks
Annapolis, Md.— Former Vice President Spiro Agnew
accepted kickbacks from engineers while he was governor
of Maryland and must pay the state $248,735 for violating
the public trust, a circuit judge ruled yesterday.
"There is no question that Mr. Agnew violated his public
trust." said Judge Bruce Williams. The sum consists of
$147,000 in kickbacks and more than $100,000 in interest.
The judge said evidence presented at a civil trial proved
that in 1967 and '968 Agnew was engaged in unlawful prac
tices to solicit kickbacks from consulting engineers who
were awarded highway contracts.
The case grew out of the fedejal investigation that led to
Agnew's resignation in 1973 as Richard Nixon's vice presi

dent and his plea of no contest to one count of federal in
come tax evasion.
Agnew s lawyer. Thomas Harrison, said he would ap
peal the ruling within 30 days.
Harrison insisted that the ruling was not a finding that
Agnew actually accepted any kickbacks.
But Michael Milleman, an assistant attorney general,
said Williams "specifically found that Agnew accepted
$147.1)00 in kickbacks It (the ruling) establishes clearly
that Mr Agnew took kickbacks "
Chirac weakly commends d'Estaing
Paris— Political jockeying in the second round of the
French presidential campaign opened yesterday with
Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac offering only a half
hearted endorsement for President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing in his re-election fight against Socialist Fran
cois Mitterrand
Chirac, who drew 5.2 million right-wing votes in the first
round of polling, pointedly refused to issue any call to the
Gaullists now to rally behind Giscard d'Estaing in the May
10 runoff.
"For myself," he said, "if the Socialist leader were
elected. I cannot ignore the consequences France would
face with the Communists participating in the govern
ment. In view of the tone I have set. and the kind of society
I envison, I can only vote for Mr Giscard d'Estaing. From
now on. the French people have the floor."
Chirac's failure to throw full political weight behind

Giscard d'Estaing now is an ominous setback The balance
of electoral strength between the lett and right wings of
French society is so close that a handful of abstensions or
voting switches may well determine the final outcome.
Only 600,(XX) votes out of just under 30 million separated
Giscard and Mitterrand, less than 0 5 percent of the total.
Mitterrand has had no further political pronouncements
to make apart from commenting that he did better than he
had expected on the first round and "a victory for me is
now possible He has not yet accepted Giscard
d'Estaing's challenge to television debates.

Violence erupts as Sands nears death
Belfast. Northern Ireland— A booby-trap bomb planted
in a hijacked truck exploded in Belfast yesterday, killing
one policeman and injuring three others The bombing,
claimed in the name of the Irish National Liberation
Army, followed the arrest of 20 prominent supporters of
jailed hunger striker Bobby Sands
An anonymous caller to a Northern Ireland radio station
later claimed responsibility for the blast on behalf of the
terrorist splinter group INLA. which claimed responsi
bility tor the 1979 car-bomb assassination of Conservative
politician Airey N'eave at the House of Commons in Lon
don.
Sands. 27, a convicted Irish Republican Army guerrilla
recently elected to British Parliament, was reported drift
ing nearer to death on the 58th day of his fast at Maze Pris
on. Sands was reportedly drinking mineral water, unable
to digest the fluoride in tap water.
Northern Ireland's security chiefs canceled all police
leave as the British province prepared for widespread vio
lence if Sands dies.
In London. Scotland Yard said a letter-bomb sent to a
Conservative member of Parliament was safely detonated
but that it might be part of a new IRA offensive against
prominent Britons. It was the second such mail-bomb in
three days, and Scotland yard expects more in the days to
come.
Later a mob of 200 youths in the staunchly Catholic Falls
Road area of Belfast, near Andersonstown, stoned police

Cease-fire hopes dim in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon— West Beirut, a predominantly
Moslem area, came under heavy shelling for the first time
in five years yesterday in mounting violence rivaling the
worst days of Lebanon's 1975-76 civil war
At the same time, Israeli warplanes caused heavy loss
of life and property in their second straight day of raids
against Palestinian guerrilla positions in southern Leba
non.
In Washington, the State Dept. said a takeover by Syrian
forces of key high points in the mountains of Lebanon has
brought a "major change in the status quo - ' between the
warring parties. The department stopped short of criticiz
ing Syria's move into areas previously held by Christian
militiamen, but cited it as one of the "serious develop
ments which concern us."
The shelling was seen as a retaliation for the bombing of
predominantly Christian areas on Sunday.
The mountain fighting and the rising tempo of shelling in
Beirut appeared to compromise official hopes of a rapid
end to the nearly month-long round of fighting. A sched
uled conference to discuss terms for an end to the war was
reportedly cancelled by the Syrian president.
The renewed Israeli air raids coincided with reports
trom Israel that Prirre Minister Menachem Begin s gov
ernment had warned Syria through diplomatic channels
not to step up its current offensive to wrest .control of
strategic mountain ridges from the Christian militia.
The Christian leadership has been sending out recent
signals that it is disappointed in the level of Israeli help
since the battle for the eastern Christian city of Zahle
began April 1. Only yesterday. Pierre Gemayel. the 76-
year-old leader of the Phalange Party that fields the most
important of the Christian militias, said. "Israel is the
only beneficiary of what is happening - Lebanese killing
each other."
Agnew ordered to repay kickbacks
Annapolis, Md.— Former Vice President Spiro Agnew
accepted kickbacks from engineers while he was governor
of Maryland and must pay the state $248,735 for violating
the public trust, a circuit judge ruled yesterday.
"There is no question that Mr. Agnew violated his public
trust." said Judge Bruce Williams. The sum consists of
$147,000 in kickbacks and more than $100,000 in interest.
The judge said evidence presented at a civil trial proved
that in 1967 and '968 Agnew was engaged in unlawful prac
tices to solicit kickbacks from consulting engineers who
were awarded highway contracts.
The case grew out of the fedejal investigation that led to
Agnew's resignation in 1973 as Richard Nixon's vice presi

dent and his plea of no contest to one count of federal in
come tax evasion.
Agnew s lawyer. Thomas Harrison, said he would ap
peal the ruling within 30 days.
Harrison insisted that the ruling was not a finding that
Agnew actually accepted any kickbacks.
But Michael Milleman, an assistant attorney general,
said Williams "specifically found that Agnew accepted
$147.1)00 in kickbacks It (the ruling) establishes clearly
that Mr Agnew took kickbacks "
Chirac weakly commends d'Estaing
Paris— Political jockeying in the second round of the
French presidential campaign opened yesterday with
Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac offering only a half
hearted endorsement for President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing in his re-election fight against Socialist Fran
cois Mitterrand
Chirac, who drew 5.2 million right-wing votes in the first
round of polling, pointedly refused to issue any call to the
Gaullists now to rally behind Giscard d'Estaing in the May
10 runoff.
"For myself," he said, "if the Socialist leader were
elected. I cannot ignore the consequences France would
face with the Communists participating in the govern
ment. In view of the tone I have set. and the kind of society
I envison, I can only vote for Mr Giscard d'Estaing. From
now on. the French people have the floor."
Chirac's failure to throw full political weight behind

Giscard d'Estaing now is an ominous setback The balance
of electoral strength between the lett and right wings of
French society is so close that a handful of abstensions or
voting switches may well determine the final outcome.
Only 600,(XX) votes out of just under 30 million separated
Giscard and Mitterrand, less than 0 5 percent of the total.
Mitterrand has had no further political pronouncements
to make apart from commenting that he did better than he
had expected on the first round and "a victory for me is
now possible He has not yet accepted Giscard
d'Estaing's challenge to television debates.

Army, followed the arrest of 20 prominent supporters of

terrorist splinter group INLA. which claimed responsi
bility tor the 1979 car-bomb assassination of Conservative
politician Airey N'eave at the House of Commons in Lon

Cease-fire hopes dim in Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon— West Beirut, a predominantly
Moslem area, came under heavy shelling for the first time
in five years yesterday in mounting violence rivaling the
worst days of Lebanon's 1975-76 civil war
At the same time, Israeli warplanes caused heavy loss
of life and property in their second straight day of raids
against Palestinian guerrilla positions in southern Leba
non.
In Washington, the State Dept. said a takeover by Syrian
forces of key high points in the mountains of Lebanon has
brought a "major change in the status quo - ' between the
warring parties. The department stopped short of criticiz
ing Syria's move into areas previously held by Christian
militiamen, but cited it as one of the "serious develop
ments which concern us."
The shelling was seen as a retaliation for the bombing of
predominantly Christian areas on Sunday.
The mountain fighting and the rising tempo of shelling in
Beirut appeared to compromise official hopes of a rapid
end to the nearly month-long round of fighting. A sched
uled conference to discuss terms for an end to the war was
reportedly cancelled by the Syrian president.
The renewed Israeli air raids coincided with reports
trom Israel that Prirre Minister Menachem Begin s gov
ernment had warned Syria through diplomatic channels
not to step up its current offensive to wrest .control of
strategic mountain ridges from the Christian militia.
The Christian leadership has been sending out recent
signals that it is disappointed in the level of Israeli help
since the battle for the eastern Christian city of Zahle
began April 1. Only yesterday. Pierre Gemayel. the 76-
year-old leader of the Phalange Party that fields the most
important of the Christian militias, said. "Israel is the
only beneficiary of what is happening - Lebanese killing
each other."
Agnew ordered to repay kickbacks
Annapolis, Md.— Former Vice President Spiro Agnew
accepted kickbacks from engineers while he was governor
of Maryland and must pay the state $248,735 for violating
the public trust, a circuit judge ruled yesterday.
"There is no question that Mr. Agnew violated his public
trust." said Judge Bruce Williams. The sum consists of
$147,000 in kickbacks and more than $100,000 in interest.
The judge said evidence presented at a civil trial proved
that in 1967 and '968 Agnew was engaged in unlawful prac
tices to solicit kickbacks from consulting engineers who
were awarded highway contracts.
The case grew out of the fedejal investigation that led to
Agnew's resignation in 1973 as Richard Nixon's vice presi

dent and his plea of no contest to one count of federal in
come tax evasion.
Agnew s lawyer. Thomas Harrison, said he would ap
peal the ruling within 30 days.
Harrison insisted that the ruling was not a finding that
Agnew actually accepted any kickbacks.
But Michael Milleman, an assistant attorney general,
said Williams "specifically found that Agnew accepted
$147.1)00 in kickbacks It (the ruling) establishes clearly
that Mr Agnew took kickbacks "
Chirac weakly commends d'Estaing
Paris— Political jockeying in the second round of the
French presidential campaign opened yesterday with
Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac offering only a half
hearted endorsement for President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing in his re-election fight against Socialist Fran
cois Mitterrand
Chirac, who drew 5.2 million right-wing votes in the first
round of polling, pointedly refused to issue any call to the
Gaullists now to rally behind Giscard d'Estaing in the May
10 runoff.
"For myself," he said, "if the Socialist leader were
elected. I cannot ignore the consequences France would
face with the Communists participating in the govern
ment. In view of the tone I have set. and the kind of society
I envison, I can only vote for Mr Giscard d'Estaing. From
now on. the French people have the floor."
Chirac's failure to throw full political weight behind

Giscard d'Estaing now is an ominous setback The balance
of electoral strength between the lett and right wings of
French society is so close that a handful of abstensions or
voting switches may well determine the final outcome.
Only 600,(XX) votes out of just under 30 million separated
Giscard and Mitterrand, less than 0 5 percent of the total.
Mitterrand has had no further political pronouncements
to make apart from commenting that he did better than he
had expected on the first round and "a victory for me is
now possible He has not yet accepted Giscard
d'Estaing's challenge to television debates.
