# Foreign policy said to match ' Cold War rhetoric '
## 
### Patty Kammerer 
The Reagan administration is still
groping for a foreign policy to go along
with its revival of Cold War rhetoric,
said ASSU Guest Prof. John Anderson
at the second Dickinson Symposium
on Public Policy in Kresge
Auditorium last night.
Though he said Reagan is following
a consistent path in domestic affairs,
steadily pushing his budget-cutting,
proposals through Congress, An
derson said he was contused about
where the Reagan foreign policy is
leading, particularly in relations with
the Soviet Union.
This slow policy development is not
necessarily a poor approach, accord
ing to Samuel Berger, former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's deputy director
of policy planning.
Berger pointed to Carter's rapid an
nouncement of his foreign policy as a
cause for later inconsistencies and
misinterpretations of U.S. priorities.
Still, Berger said he was surprised
about the mixed signals coming from
the administration, and the "uncer
tainty in forming U.S. policy on El
Salvador, the Middle East and arms
control.
"There's no question that the Soviet
military posture has become more
ominous. But there is quite a dif
ference between perceiving a Soviet
threat and forming a policy to deal
with it,"he said.
Berger's major criticism of Reagan
policymaking was the persistent em
phasis on reducing every world prob
lem into East vs. West terms.

Berger questioned Reagan's in
sistence on El Salvador as a "place to
draw the line against the Soviet
Union."
"To say that El Salvador is an East-
West problem is not only mistaken,
but counterproductive. A military,
rather than political, solution to El
Salvador will only accelerate the
polarization."
Reagan State Dept. official Robert
Baraz analyzed the Soviet approach to
the Third World as opportunistic, not
subject to definition in geopolitical
terms.
"Should the opportunity arise, no
area is free of Soviet pressures," said
the director of research and analysis
tor the USSR.
Turning to the arms control issue,
Baraz described the Soviets as using a

"damage limiting strategy."
According to Baraz, the Soviets rec
ognize the militarization of U.S. for
eign policy under Reagan, and are
therefore willing to engage in arms
control negotiations.
Berger took no issue with efforts to
limit nuclear arms. With military
technology moving at the speed it is to
day, arms control is not a favor to the
Soviets but clearly in our own self in
terest, he said.
"Without an arms control treaty we
will be faced with several thousand
additional nuclear warheads by 1985.
We would in turn try to meet them at
enormous financial cost,"he said.
"Once we fall off the arms control
wagon, it will be very difficult to
climb back on."
