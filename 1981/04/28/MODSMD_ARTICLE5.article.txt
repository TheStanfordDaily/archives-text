# U.S. asks Japan to up its military strength
## 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo â€” The Japanese government,
hoping to satisfy U.S. requests for a
military buildup, is expected to prom
ise today a fixed deadline tor bringing
its defense power up to a target set
more than five years ago.
The expected decision would not
project a major increase in Japanese
military strength and appears to be
primarily a talking point for Prime
Minister Zenko Suzuki when he meets
President Ronald Reagan next week
in Washington.
Defense is expected to be the major
issue on their agenda, and it is likely
that Reagan will seek a general com
mitment for more Japanese as
sistance in the defense of northeast
Asia.
But Suzuki already has ruled out any
major new military initiatives and,
according to reliable sources, has de
cided on the alternative of setting a
target date for achieving a modest
buildup planned in : 976.
The decision is expected to come out
of today's meeting of the National De
fense Council. Japan's top military
policy organization.
The most significant practical ef
fect will be a commitment by Japan to
fill out its naval and air forces to the
levels fixed in a national strategic
plan in 976. Suzuki already has hinted
he favors setting 1987 as the target
date, and this is likely to be the out
come of today's meeting.
It would mean buying more modern
ships and planes for the purpose of air
defense and anti-submarine warfare.
In terms of military ground forces, it
would mean only a modest increase in
the number of soldiers under arms.
There is no indication that the idea
of fixing a deadline tor these improve
ments will satisfy the Reagan admin
istration or some members of Con
gress who contend that Japan is lag
gard in the defense field.
Unlike former President Jimmy
Carter's defense officials, those in the
Reagan administration have been
rather vague so far in defining what
they expect Japan to do.
Former Defense Secretary Harold
Brown hammered hard on the theme
that Japan should raise defense spend
ing as a percentage of its gross na
tional product.
Reagan's defense secretary,
Caspar Weinberger, has told Congress
he expects Japan to do considerably
more in the way of defense. But the ad

ministration, unlike its predecessor,
says it prefers to talk more about
Japan's defense role in northeast Asia
than about specific numbers, costs or
percentages.
In general comments from Wash
ington. Japan has been urged recently
to prepare for a bigger role in defend
ing sea lanes and patrolling for Soviet
submarines in waters near Japan The
Reagan administration hopes that this
country would take up some of the
slack caused by the U.S. shift of some
naval forces to the Indian Ocean.
The Carter administration was dis
appointed last summer when Japan
approved only a routine budget in
crease for its defense forces after first
having appeared to promise a more
substantial contribution. Its reversal
was due mainly to a budget-pinching
Finance Ministry, which keeps a tight
rein on all government spending in or
der to cut back Japan's financial defi
cit.
The decision to come today is ex
pected to promise that by 1987 the fun
damental defense plan adopted in ; 976
would be fulfilled. The 1976 plan had
set general targets for the numbers of
troops, planes and ships, but it did not
specify when those targets would be
achieved.
For example, the 1976 plan called
for the air self-defense force to main
tain about 430 aircraft. Now, five
years after the plan was unveiled, it
has only 310 of them. The decision ex
pected today would in effect require
the addition ot about 120 planes "by
1987.
It would also commit Japan to a
force of 60 anti-submarine surface
ships, eight more than it now has The
maritime self-defense force would be
required to add about 40 aircraft, most
of them sub-spotters, to bring its
strength up to the 220 planes author
ized by the 1976 plan.
The ground self-defense force now
has about 155,000 troops and would ddd
about another 25,000 to bring its
strength up to the authorized 180,000.
Some government officials, princi
pally in the Foreign Ministry, are
known to have advised Suzuki to avoid
going to Washington with the promise
of a target fixed for 1987. They re
portedly contended that this would
merely provide a firm guideline that
the U.S government would use to urge
even faster completion of the 1976
plan.
