# Reagan to address Congress tonight
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan, preparing a dramatic return
to public life before a joint session ot
Congress tonight, appeared close to
victory in the House of Represent
atives yesterday on his government
spending cut plan.
Even Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill,
D-Mass., virtually conceded that Rea
gan had the votes to win as the presi
dent prepared for his first public ap
pearance since he was wounded in an
assassination attempt March 30.
Reagan's lieutenants also reported
administration agreement with three
Republican Senators who had side
tracked his budget proposal by their
unexpected opposition in committee
before the Easter recess. As a result,
the way was clear for passage of the
president's spending cut in the Senate.
The president, who worked on his
15-minute speech at his mountain
hideaway at Camp David, Md. before
returning to the White House late yes
terday, will inform Congress that the
day of decision is near on his economic
package, an aide said.
Republicans expressed confidence
that the president would win a major
victory when the House votes on
spending and taxation targets, possi
bly later this week.
Democrats, with many conserva
tives defecting to Reagan's camp and
others balking at an alternative
budget backed by O'Neill, were in dis
array as they awaited the president's
message.
Republicans were jubilant.
"We're in really good shape We're
damn well close to having it," said an
aide to a House Republican leader who
asked not to be identified Reagan's
personal appeal for his program, the
aide said, will be "icing on the cake."
Confirmation that many Democrats
would vote with Reagan came from

O'Neill, who spent Congress's two
week Easter recess on a trip to Aus
tralia and New Zealand while his GOP
counterpart. House Minority Leader
Robert H. Michel, R-Ili., stayed home
to drum up votes for the president.
"I can read Congresses and legisla
tors and we go with the will of the peo
ple and the will of the people is to go
with the president," O'Neill told re
porters yesterday before the House re
convened following its recess.
The president's telephone calls to
wavering lawmakers, O'Neill said,
had a tremendous impact.
However, White House deputy press
secretary Larry Speakes said only
that the House vote would be very
close on a Reagan-backed resolution
to be offered by Rep. Del Latta, R-
Ohio, and Rep. Phil Gramm, D-Texas.
Gramm said that 26 Democrats
among the 44 in the Conservative
Democratic Forum had agreed to
back the Latta-Gramm resolution,
which now has administration en
dorsement and which provides for $6.1
billion more in spending cuts than the
president had proposed in his budget.
If the 190 House Republicans all
stand by the president, it would take
only 27 votes from the 242 Democrats
to reach the required majority of 217
in the present House. There are three
vacancies in the 435-member body.
Latta and Gramm have proposed
spending $689 billion in the year start
ing Oct. 1, with a deficit of $40 billion.
A Democratic budget approved by the
House Budget Committee calls for
spending $714.5 billion but provides for
a smaller tax cut than Reagan wants
and a smaller deficit of $24 6 billion.
The president projected spending of
$695.3 billion and a deficit of $45 billion
in his March 10 budget message.
Speakes said that the thrust of Rea
gan's speech to Congress will be that
he was elected last November with a
mandate to do something about the

economy, and nothing has yet been
done.
"The public is demanding that
something be done," Speakes said.
"The economy itself demands action.
And the president feels that the day of
decision is near and that it's ap
propriate that the Congress act as
quickly as possible on his economic
program."
An aide to a Republican member of
the committee said that budget as
sumptions were changed to reduce the
estimated deficit from $60 billion to
$48.7 billion for fiscal year 1982 in the
Senate resolution. In addition, the re
vised resolution would assume un
specified spending cuts of $20 billion to
$25 billion in 1984, the aide added.
Vice President George Bush pre
dicted that Reagan's program would
be passed intact or "in a form very
close to what the president has pro
posed."
"The president deserves the chance
to do what he said he was going to do,"
Bush told 1500 business executives at
the annual meeting of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
David Stockman, director of the Of
fice of Management and Budget, ad
dressed the same audience and at
tacked the Democratic alternative
budget as an "artful impostor. . .with
far more warts than dimples."
Stockman said that the Democratic
plan would increase spending for
domestic programs by $86 billion in
the next three years over that of Rea
gan's program.
At the same time, Stockman said, it
would push up federal taxes by 12 per
cent in each of the next three years;
the president proposes a 10 percent tax
cut in each of the next three years.
The House vote on the budget reso
lution. Stockman added, will be "the
single most important test of the pres
ident's economic program."

specified spending cuts of $20 billion to
$25 billion in 1984, the aide added.
Vice President George Bush pre
dicted that Reagan's program would
be passed intact or "in a form very
close to what the president has pro
posed."
"The president deserves the chance
to do what he said he was going to do,"
Bush told 1500 business executives at
the annual meeting of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
David Stockman, director of the Of
fice of Management and Budget, ad
dressed the same audience and at
tacked the Democratic alternative
budget as an "artful impostor. . .with
far more warts than dimples."
Stockman said that the Democratic
plan would increase spending for
domestic programs by $86 billion in
the next three years over that of Rea
gan's program.
At the same time, Stockman said, it
would push up federal taxes by 12 per
cent in each of the next three years;
the president proposes a 10 percent tax
cut in each of the next three years.
The House vote on the budget reso
lution. Stockman added, will be "the
single most important test of the pres
ident's economic program."
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan, preparing a dramatic return
to public life before a joint session ot
Congress tonight, appeared close to
victory in the House of Represent
atives yesterday on his government
spending cut plan.
Even Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill,
D-Mass., virtually conceded that Rea
gan had the votes to win as the presi
dent prepared for his first public ap
pearance since he was wounded in an
assassination attempt March 30.
Reagan's lieutenants also reported
administration agreement with three
Republican Senators who had side
tracked his budget proposal by their
unexpected opposition in committee
before the Easter recess. As a result,
the way was clear for passage of the
president's spending cut in the Senate.
The president, who worked on his
15-minute speech at his mountain
hideaway at Camp David, Md. before
returning to the White House late yes
terday, will inform Congress that the
day of decision is near on his economic
package, an aide said.
Republicans expressed confidence
that the president would win a major
victory when the House votes on
spending and taxation targets, possi
bly later this week.
Democrats, with many conserva
tives defecting to Reagan's camp and
others balking at an alternative
budget backed by O'Neill, were in dis
array as they awaited the president's
message.
Republicans were jubilant.
"We're in really good shape We're
damn well close to having it," said an
aide to a House Republican leader who
asked not to be identified Reagan's
personal appeal for his program, the
aide said, will be "icing on the cake."
Confirmation that many Democrats
would vote with Reagan came from

O'Neill, who spent Congress's two
week Easter recess on a trip to Aus
tralia and New Zealand while his GOP
counterpart. House Minority Leader
Robert H. Michel, R-Ili., stayed home
to drum up votes for the president.
"I can read Congresses and legisla
tors and we go with the will of the peo
ple and the will of the people is to go
with the president," O'Neill told re
porters yesterday before the House re
convened following its recess.
The president's telephone calls to
wavering lawmakers, O'Neill said,
had a tremendous impact.
However, White House deputy press
secretary Larry Speakes said only
that the House vote would be very
close on a Reagan-backed resolution
to be offered by Rep. Del Latta, R-
Ohio, and Rep. Phil Gramm, D-Texas.
Gramm said that 26 Democrats
among the 44 in the Conservative
Democratic Forum had agreed to
back the Latta-Gramm resolution,
which now has administration en
dorsement and which provides for $6.1
billion more in spending cuts than the
president had proposed in his budget.
If the 190 House Republicans all
stand by the president, it would take
only 27 votes from the 242 Democrats
to reach the required majority of 217
in the present House. There are three
vacancies in the 435-member body.
Latta and Gramm have proposed
spending $689 billion in the year start
ing Oct. 1, with a deficit of $40 billion.
A Democratic budget approved by the
House Budget Committee calls for
spending $714.5 billion but provides for
a smaller tax cut than Reagan wants
and a smaller deficit of $24 6 billion.
The president projected spending of
$695.3 billion and a deficit of $45 billion
in his March 10 budget message.
Speakes said that the thrust of Rea
gan's speech to Congress will be that
he was elected last November with a
mandate to do something about the

economy, and nothing has yet been
done.
"The public is demanding that
something be done," Speakes said.
"The economy itself demands action.
And the president feels that the day of
decision is near and that it's ap
propriate that the Congress act as
quickly as possible on his economic
program."
An aide to a Republican member of
the committee said that budget as
sumptions were changed to reduce the
estimated deficit from $60 billion to
$48.7 billion for fiscal year 1982 in the
Senate resolution. In addition, the re
vised resolution would assume un
specified spending cuts of $20 billion to
$25 billion in 1984, the aide added.
