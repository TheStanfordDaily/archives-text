## Non-lethal equipment, technology sales to China bog down in budgets, red tape 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — Although the Unit
ed States offered nearly a year
and a halt ago to sell China non
lethal military equipment and
advanced technology that could
be used tor military purposes,
Beijing has not made a single
major purchase under Washing
ton's liberalized guidelines, in
formed sources said.
The reasons are diverse —
budget problems. Beijing's in
terest in different equipment
and technology, U.S. red tape in
licensing sales — but the net re
sult casts doubt upon the pro
fessed American option of help

ing arm China should the Soviet
Union invade Poland.
The transfer to China of ad
vanced U.S. technology, usable
for military as well as civilian
purposes, was an important ele
ment in the Sino-American
strategic "alliance of in
terests" developed under the
Carter administration But that
transfer has yet to begin, ac
cording to sources well placed
to monitor the two countries' re
lations. , m

been completed, though it was
announced with much fanfare
by former Secretary of Defense
Harold Brown during a January
1980 visit here.
The planned purchase of
three U.S. broadcast satellites,
worth $150 million to $200 mil
lion. has been postponed for sev
eral years largely because of
the cost.
Although more than 400
licenses have been issued to
American companies to sell
China non-lethal military equip
ment and advanced technology
with possible military applica
tions. China has made no signifi
cant purchases, according to the
sources.
A suspicion has grown among
some American officials in
Washington that Beijing is
trying to find out what the limits
are on what the United States
will sell before it makes any
final commitments on
purchases, and that the same
pattern characterizes Chinese
discussions with West European
capitals.
Carter promise
The Carter administration
had said that the United States
would sell such military equip
ment as air-defense radar, tac
tical air navigation systems, ra
dios. transport aircraft and heli
copters and trucks, and it ac
tively promoted the sale of
American technology to mod

ernize the Chinese military and
the arms industry here
Although portrayed as ele
ments in a broadening rela
tionship between China and the
United States, the measures
took on stragetic implications
when they were adopted in the
wake of the Soviet intervention
in Afghanistan in December
1979.
The Reagan administration
at first expressed misgivings
about such deals, worrying
where they might lead, but since
the threat of Soviet intervention
in Poland, it has seemed willing
to go even further in arming Chi
na. Caspar Weinberger,
Brown's successor as Secretary
of Defense, said recently in Lon
don that providing China with
new weapons systems and
modern military technology is a
definite American option to re
spond to any Soviet move into
Poland.
Diminished interest
But Chinese interest, once
keen, appears greatly
diminished. A senior Chinese
government official said that
Beijing remains interested in
acquiring military and in
dustrial technology from the
United States to help modernize
its armed forces, but not weap
ons themselves.
The non-lethal equipment the
United States offered to sell
does not match the presumed
Chinese priorities of new air-de
fense and ground-support war
planes, anti-aircraft missiles
and anti-tank defenses.
The second difficulty, the sen
ior Chinese official noted, is fi
nancing any purchses during a
period of great austerity, in
cluding cuts in the Chinese de
fense budget. China would pre
fer the technology to make its
own weapons.
A third obstacle has been the
slowness of the U.S. govern
ment. whether under the Carter
or the Reagan administration,
to approve the requests of
American firms to sell military
equipment and dual-use tech
nology to Beijing, according to
Chinese and other informed
sources here.
Little more has been heard of
the Carter administration idea
of buying from China metals
like titanium, vanadium and
tantalum, all lightweight, heat
resistant and vital to aircraft
construction.

Beijing — Although the Unit
ed States offered nearly a year
and a halt ago to sell China non
lethal military equipment and
advanced technology that could
be used tor military purposes,
Beijing has not made a single
major purchase under Washing
ton's liberalized guidelines, in
formed sources said.
The reasons are diverse —
budget problems. Beijing's in
terest in different equipment
and technology, U.S. red tape in
licensing sales — but the net re
sult casts doubt upon the pro
fessed American option of help

ing arm China should the Soviet
Union invade Poland.
The transfer to China of ad
vanced U.S. technology, usable
for military as well as civilian
purposes, was an important ele

strategic "alliance of in

Carter administration But that
transfer has yet to begin, ac

announced with much fanfare
by former Secretary of Defense
Harold Brown during a January
1980 visit here.
The planned purchase of
three U.S. broadcast satellites,
worth $150 million to $200 mil

the cost.

licenses have been issued to
American companies to sell
China non-lethal military equip
ment and advanced technology
with possible military applica
tions. China has made no signifi
cant purchases, according to the
sources.
A suspicion has grown among
some American officials in
Washington that Beijing is
trying to find out what the limits
are on what the United States
will sell before it makes any
final commitments on
purchases, and that the same
pattern characterizes Chinese
discussions with West European
capitals.
Carter promise
The Carter administration
had said that the United States
would sell such military equip
ment as air-defense radar, tac
tical air navigation systems, ra
dios. transport aircraft and heli
copters and trucks, and it ac
tively promoted the sale of
American technology to mod

ernize the Chinese military and
the arms industry here
Although portrayed as ele
ments in a broadening rela
tionship between China and the
United States, the measures
took on stragetic implications
when they were adopted in the
wake of the Soviet intervention
in Afghanistan in December
1979.
The Reagan administration
at first expressed misgivings
about such deals, worrying
where they might lead, but since
the threat of Soviet intervention
in Poland, it has seemed willing
to go even further in arming Chi
na. Caspar Weinberger,
Brown's successor as Secretary
of Defense, said recently in Lon
don that providing China with
new weapons systems and
modern military technology is a
definite American option to re
spond to any Soviet move into
Poland.
Diminished interest
But Chinese interest, once
keen, appears greatly
diminished. A senior Chinese
government official said that
Beijing remains interested in
acquiring military and in
dustrial technology from the
United States to help modernize
its armed forces, but not weap
ons themselves.
The non-lethal equipment the
United States offered to sell
does not match the presumed
Chinese priorities of new air-de
fense and ground-support war
planes, anti-aircraft missiles
and anti-tank defenses.
The second difficulty, the sen
ior Chinese official noted, is fi
nancing any purchses during a
period of great austerity, in
cluding cuts in the Chinese de
fense budget. China would pre
fer the technology to make its
own weapons.
A third obstacle has been the
slowness of the U.S. govern
ment. whether under the Carter
or the Reagan administration,
to approve the requests of
American firms to sell military
equipment and dual-use tech
nology to Beijing, according to
Chinese and other informed
sources here.
Little more has been heard of
the Carter administration idea
of buying from China metals
like titanium, vanadium and
tantalum, all lightweight, heat
resistant and vital to aircraft
construction.
