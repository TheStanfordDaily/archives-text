Kiev, U.S.S.R. (AP) — Jew
ish activists say they are suffer
ing a new wave of beatings and
arrests in this Ukrainian capi
tal. ' The atmosphere is hostile,
very hostile. Our situation is
similar to a wartime under
ground," one of them said.
Jewish sources, asking not to
be identified for fear of retribu
tion, said 195.000 of Kiev's 2.2
million people are Jews, and
that 7000 of them have been de
nied permission to emigrate.
A half-dozen of them in
terviewed here said they and
others were subject to periodic
harassment, including beatings,
arrests and dismissal from their
jobs.
"Most often the beatings are
at night, when no one is
around," said one man. He said

the violence was carried out in
collusion with authorities.
Candid anti-Semitism
"The Ukraine has long been
noted for anti-Semitism of the
most candid kind." he said. "If
we don't get permission to leave
the country, our lives are fin
ished. That goes for our children
and grandchildren too."
Interviewees said 90 percent
of those who apply to emigrate
are tired from responsible jobs
and support themselves with
lesser work.
Several said they had been
told by KGB secret police of
ficers they would never be al
lowed out.
"One KGB agent told me I
would never be permitted to
leave because relations with

America are worse, and al
though we are not guilty, we
must pay tor this," one said.
"We do nothing illegal. Noth
ing they can punish us tor. But
they charge us with made-up
hooliganism."
An estimated 600,000 Jews
live in the Ukraine, to which
Jewish settlement was largely
restricted by the czars from
1791 to 1917, the year ot the
Bolshevik Revolution.
Jews, Armenians and ethnic
Germans are the only groups
regularly allowed to emigrate
from the Soviet Union.
About 5 : .000 Jews emigrated
in ; 979. a record, but the level
dropped to 21,000 in 1980. and is
not expected to exceed 15,000
this year, based on January-
March tigures.
