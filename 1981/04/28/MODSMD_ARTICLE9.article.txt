# Nestle under fire again in Brazil nursing campaign
## 
### Washington Post 
Rio de Janeiro — Responding to a scientific
study showing that a large percentage of bot
tle-fed babies in Brazil's largest city are un
dernourished, the conservative military gov
ernment of Brazil has launched a campaign to
encourage mothers to breast-feed their chil
dren.
The campaign was yet another blow to Nes
tle, the Swiss-based multinational corporation
that has been under fire for several years for
promoting the use of infant formula in under
developed countries. Nestle, the sole com
mercial supplier of infant formula in Brazil,
has been accused of encouraging poor mothers
to use its formula even though the women often
dilute it with unsafe water or are unable to pre
pare it under sanitary conditions.
Human rights nominee
The worldwide campaign against Nestle
may even become an issue in the debate over
confirmation of President Ronald Reagan's
nominee for assistant secretary of state for hu
man rights, Ernest Letever, of the Ethics and
Public Policy Center in Washington. The cen
ter, which reprinted Fortune magazine arti
cle defending Nestle and describing its church
supported opponents as "Marxists marching
under the banner of Christ," has accepted a
$25,000 contribution from Nestle.
Brazil's campaign to promote breast-feed
ing, launched on the 17th anniversary of the an
ticommunist coup that brought the military to
power here, is undoubtedly the Third World's
largest such campaign.
Bearing such slogans as "Infant mortality is
five times lower among breast-fed babies,"
millions of posters of nursing infants are being
tacked up in school rooms, health clinics and
maternity wards. Soap opera idols have been
mobilized tor a blitz of radio and television ad
vertising. Starting this month, all light, gas.
water and telephone bills — even betting cards
for the immensely popular national soccer lot
tery — will carry the slogan: "Nurse your
child."
Milk for babies
"I tell mothers their milk is for their babies
— cow's milk is good for calves," Dr. Yedda
Paschoal de Oliveira, director of the na
tionwide drive, commented when interviewed
recently in her Brasilia office.
Dr. Paschoal calculated that last year fami
lies in Brazil spent $100 million on powdered
milk, which she said meant 180 million quarts
of mother's milk was wasted.
Although breast-feeding was virtually uni
versal in Brazil until the 19405, today only one
quarter of Brazilian babies are nursed past two
months. By six months, the proportion has
dwindled to 2 percent.
Report
Paschoal cited a studv by the Sao Paulo
School of Medicine that is the backbone of the
campaign in Brazil, and has implications tor
other Third World countries.
The report found that:
— 32 percent of the bottle-fed babies suf
fered from malnutrition, compared to 9 per
cent of the breast-fed babies. Experts here say
70 percent of the weight of the brain is formed
during the first two years of lite, and malnutri
tion at this age often causes irreversible men
tal deficiencies;
— 23 percent of the bottle-fed babies had to
be hospitalized, while none of the breast-fed

babies had to be hospitalized; and
— Most of the hospitalized babies had diar
rhea. which is the most frequent cause of in
fant death in Sao Paulo.
A separate study of infants from six to 11
months in Sigulem, a Sao Paulo suburb, found
that 96 percent of deaths registered were
among children breast-fed less than six
months.
A Nestle spokesman in Sao Paulo said re
cently that he was not aware of the School of
Medicine research.
Not aware
But the survey findings were echoed in ran
dom interviews with mothers in Rocinha, one
of Rio's largest — and worst — favelas or shan
tytowns.
"I started giving Nestogeno (formula) to my
baby boy at IV2 months, but he got a stomach
infection that almost killed the child," one
woman, known only as Nicinha, said as she sat
in her two-room house, partially roofed with
flattened soy oil cans.
Across the sewer and down a narrow, slip
pery alley Maria da Conceicao sat in her dark
ened room, nursing her 1-year-old son, Vito.
"They are much stronger," she said of
breast-fed babies. "They don't get sick with
diseases."
Dr. Amandio Ferreira de Souza, head
pediatrician at Rio's Poor Mother Hospital,
agreed with Maria da Conceicao's comments.
"Almost all the diarrhea cases I see are bot
tle-fed babies," he commented.
Without hesitation, Dr. Amandio said his fel
low pediatricians in Rio are "100 percent" in
favor of breast-feeding, but for many years his
profession was the target of a multifaceted
promotional campaign by Nestle.
Nestle spokesmen maintain that the com
pany never advertised their infant formulas to
the general public, but critics charge that pro
motion occurs in subtle forms.
"The cans always say, 'Mother's milk is best
for your child, but in the absence of milk. .
commented Dr. Paschoal, director of the
nationwide nursing drive. "It is that 'but' that
creates doubt in the mother's mind. Studies
show that doubt and worry cause the milk to
dry up."
In another case, the February issue of
Claudia, Brazil's largest circulating women's
magazine, carried an unsigned "debate" on
breast-feeding. The article contrasted "moth
ers of the most savage tribes of Africa (who
carry) their babies slung around their necks"
to "professional, active, independent, women
(tor whom) breastfeeding can constitute a
prison." Sandwiched among the pages of the
"debate" was a full-page advertisement for a
Nestle baby cereal.
Claudia's readers are middle and upper
class, and such advertising has been very suc
cessful, according to Ines das Gracas Maria,
head nurse of the nursery at Santa Lucia
private hospital, located in Rio's affluent
southern zone.
"The mothers here come up with any pos
sible excuse to get out of breast-feeding: their
breasts hurt, they don't have milk, their
breasts will tall — sometimes they almost
come to blows with the pediatricians over it,"
she said.
These attitudes quickly filter down to lower
class mothers, many of whom work as
domestics for middle and upper-class families.

has been accused of encouraging poor mothers
to use its formula even though the women often

Brazil's campaign to promote breast-feed

largest such campaign.

Milk for babies
"I tell mothers their milk is for their babies
— cow's milk is good for calves," Dr. Yedda
Paschoal de Oliveira, director of the na
tionwide drive, commented when interviewed
recently in her Brasilia office.
Dr. Paschoal calculated that last year fami
lies in Brazil spent $100 million on powdered
milk, which she said meant 180 million quarts
of mother's milk was wasted.
Although breast-feeding was virtually uni
versal in Brazil until the 19405, today only one
quarter of Brazilian babies are nursed past two
months. By six months, the proportion has
dwindled to 2 percent.
Report
Paschoal cited a studv by the Sao Paulo
School of Medicine that is the backbone of the
campaign in Brazil, and has implications tor
other Third World countries.
The report found that:
— 32 percent of the bottle-fed babies suf
fered from malnutrition, compared to 9 per
cent of the breast-fed babies. Experts here say
70 percent of the weight of the brain is formed
during the first two years of lite, and malnutri
tion at this age often causes irreversible men
tal deficiencies;
— 23 percent of the bottle-fed babies had to
be hospitalized, while none of the breast-fed

babies had to be hospitalized; and
— Most of the hospitalized babies had diar
rhea. which is the most frequent cause of in
fant death in Sao Paulo.
A separate study of infants from six to 11
months in Sigulem, a Sao Paulo suburb, found
that 96 percent of deaths registered were
among children breast-fed less than six
months.
A Nestle spokesman in Sao Paulo said re
cently that he was not aware of the School of
Medicine research.
Not aware
But the survey findings were echoed in ran
dom interviews with mothers in Rocinha, one
of Rio's largest — and worst — favelas or shan
tytowns.
"I started giving Nestogeno (formula) to my
baby boy at IV2 months, but he got a stomach
infection that almost killed the child," one
woman, known only as Nicinha, said as she sat
in her two-room house, partially roofed with
flattened soy oil cans.
Across the sewer and down a narrow, slip
pery alley Maria da Conceicao sat in her dark
ened room, nursing her 1-year-old son, Vito.
"They are much stronger," she said of
breast-fed babies. "They don't get sick with
diseases."
Dr. Amandio Ferreira de Souza, head
pediatrician at Rio's Poor Mother Hospital,
agreed with Maria da Conceicao's comments.
"Almost all the diarrhea cases I see are bot
tle-fed babies," he commented.
Without hesitation, Dr. Amandio said his fel
low pediatricians in Rio are "100 percent" in
favor of breast-feeding, but for many years his
profession was the target of a multifaceted
promotional campaign by Nestle.
Nestle spokesmen maintain that the com
pany never advertised their infant formulas to
the general public, but critics charge that pro
motion occurs in subtle forms.
"The cans always say, 'Mother's milk is best
for your child, but in the absence of milk. .
commented Dr. Paschoal, director of the
nationwide nursing drive. "It is that 'but' that
creates doubt in the mother's mind. Studies
show that doubt and worry cause the milk to
dry up."
In another case, the February issue of
Claudia, Brazil's largest circulating women's
magazine, carried an unsigned "debate" on
breast-feeding. The article contrasted "moth
ers of the most savage tribes of Africa (who
carry) their babies slung around their necks"
to "professional, active, independent, women
(tor whom) breastfeeding can constitute a
prison." Sandwiched among the pages of the
"debate" was a full-page advertisement for a
Nestle baby cereal.
Claudia's readers are middle and upper
class, and such advertising has been very suc
cessful, according to Ines das Gracas Maria,
head nurse of the nursery at Santa Lucia
private hospital, located in Rio's affluent
southern zone.
"The mothers here come up with any pos
sible excuse to get out of breast-feeding: their
breasts hurt, they don't have milk, their
breasts will tall — sometimes they almost
come to blows with the pediatricians over it,"
she said.
These attitudes quickly filter down to lower
class mothers, many of whom work as
domestics for middle and upper-class families.
Rio de Janeiro — Responding to a scientific
study showing that a large percentage of bot
tle-fed babies in Brazil's largest city are un
dernourished, the conservative military gov
ernment of Brazil has launched a campaign to
encourage mothers to breast-feed their chil
dren.
The campaign was yet another blow to Nes
tle, the Swiss-based multinational corporation
that has been under fire for several years for
promoting the use of infant formula in under
developed countries. Nestle, the sole com
mercial supplier of infant formula in Brazil,
has been accused of encouraging poor mothers
to use its formula even though the women often
