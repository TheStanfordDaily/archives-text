An adultress condemned to death by stoning
was surrounded by a group of village people,
ready to stone her Jesus walked up to the
group and said. Let those of you who are
without sin cast the first stone " An old lady
carried a huge rock to the young woman and
dropped it on her, crushing her to death
Jesus turned to her and said Mother, some
time you really piss me off
