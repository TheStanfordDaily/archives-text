# Problem kids find student help from 'partners' here

Executive Director Mike
McDevitt says it best when he
describes the Bay Area Part
ners Program; "What we're
about is really so simple: taking
young people who are not coping
and putting them together with
people who are."
"Partners," though similar
to organizations like Big
Brothers, is the only organiza
tion that "has as a special target
children in trouble," according
to Carol Blackman, a consultant
for the group.
Several students here are in
volved with the Partners or
ganization.
Children 10 to 18 years old are
referred to Partners by proba
tion departments and other
youth service bureaus. Partici
pation is totally voluntary;
there is no trade-off of pun
ishment for participation
Once the child has signed up.
the search begins for an adult
volunteer. .According to As
sociate Director Becky Cooper,
there is an eight- to 10-week
waiting period between signing
up and actually being assigned
to a Senior Partner. This long
wait results both from attempts
to make compatible match-ups
and from a shortage of adult vol
unteers.
Match-ups are, in most cases.

successful; McDevitt said that
in 80 percent of all match-ups,
the relationships work, meaning
that the partners stay together
at least one year. Even if the re
lationship doesn't work, the
children seem willing to try
again. Seventeen-year-old Nic
ole's first partnership did not
work, but she signed up a second
time and is now quite happy
with her "Senior Partners,"
Stanford students Cindy Thom
as and Lise Rehberg.
Relationships
Not only do the personal rela
tionships seem to work, but also
the program seems to be effec
tive in reducing recidivism (re
peat of crime) rates, according
to McDevitt. Independent stud
ies have shown a 20 to 30 percent
decrease in recidivism among
children who have gone through
the Partners Program,
McDevitt said.
A SCIRE course offered this
quarter has helped alleviate the
problem of a long waiting peri
od. Students in the class attend
lectures and serve as temporary
Senior Partners. Jeff
Maltzman, a sophomore here
and one of the students that first
approached Partners with the
SCIRE proposal, hopes that the
class will be held all year in the
future, so the class members
can be permanent Senior Part

ners (i.e., serve a full year). Co
oper, who is also the instructor
of the course, would like to see
both programs offered
The Bay Area Partners Pro
gram is one of six branches na
tionwide — four in Colorado and
one in North Carolina in addi
tion to the Bay Area program —
each of which was established
and is run independently. In its
first two years, Bay Area Part
ners has made 90 match-ups; tor
all six branches, there have
been 6000 in 13 years. With a
budget of $83,000 this year, all of
which was privately donated,
the $750 per child per year cost
of running the program is
"about one-twentieth of the cost
of sending the child to an institu
tion," according to McDevitt.
Partners sponsors free or dis
counted medical and dental
care tor children in the pro
gram, much of which is con
tributed by local practitioners;
training and counseling for the
adult Volunteers; group ac
tivities for the partners, such as
trips to Disneyland, picnics, and
fishing trips; and fundraising
events. This Friday, for exam
ple, Stanford's Men's Volleyball
team will play against the 1980
NorCal USVBA champions;
there will also be an exhibition
match played by members of
other Stanford varsity teams.
