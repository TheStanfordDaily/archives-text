"This is one of the most excit
ing things I've ever been in
volved in. I've never seen any
thing take off with such speed.
Everyone involved is motivated
and willing to work."
That's one sophmore's reac
tion to a new program on cam
pus to promote more class ac
tivities and increase alumni
student contacts. The program
is called the Student Alumni
Network (S.T.A.N.).
"The organization was
created to promote interaction
with alumni as well as to estab

lish a little bit ot class identity,"
according to Margot Nelson, ad
visor for the Student Alumni
Network. "After freshman ori
entation, the class doesn't get
together until senior year," and
many students are unhappy
with this lack of class activities,
she said.
By contacting students she
knew by "word of mouth''
Nelson established a commit
tee. and the group already has 57
active members. "There are
more people at every meeting,"
according to Kevin Casey, a
sophmore.

The group has sponsored a
luau, a pub night, an ice cream
bash and dinners at the house of
alumni; other activities are
planned During winter quarter,
S.T.A.N. organized several pub
nights and hopes to establish a
regular Junior Pub Night to
take place every Wednesday.
Last week's "Frolic in Frost"
was one ot the events sponsored
by the group
On May 4. S.T.A.N, willgivea
luau for the freshmen. Each
dorm will sponsor a bar in one of
six areas to provide food and
drink for the three to five hun

dred people expected to attend
Class activities, however, are
only part of the group's effort.
The group is also trying to pro
mote alumni interaction
through a number of innovative
programs.
"Home-Away-From-Home"
is one of the ideas intended to
bring alumni into direct contact
with students. In this program,
interested freshmen will be
matched with a local alumni
family. The student will then
join the family tor dinner at
least once each quarter. In addi
