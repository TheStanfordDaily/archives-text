"This is one of the most excit
ing things I've ever been in
volved in. I've never seen any
thing take off with such speed.
Everyone involved is motivated
and willing to work."
That's one sophmore's reac
tion to a new program on cam
pus to promote more class ac
tivities and increase alumni
student contacts. The program
is called the Student Alumni
Network (S.T.A.N.).
"The organization was
created to promote interaction
with alumni as well as to estab

lish a little bit ot class identity,"
according to Margot Nelson, ad
visor for the Student Alumni
Network. "After freshman ori
entation, the class doesn't get
together until senior year," and
many students are unhappy
with this lack of class activities,
she said.
By contacting students she
knew by "word of mouth''
Nelson established a commit
tee. and the group already has 57
active members. "There are
more people at every meeting,"
according to Kevin Casey, a
sophmore.

The group has sponsored a
luau, a pub night, an ice cream
bash and dinners at the house of
alumni; other activities are
planned During winter quarter,
S.T.A.N. organized several pub
nights and hopes to establish a
regular Junior Pub Night to
take place every Wednesday.
Last week's "Frolic in Frost"
was one ot the events sponsored
by the group
On May 4. S.T.A.N, willgivea
luau for the freshmen. Each
dorm will sponsor a bar in one of
six areas to provide food and
drink for the three to five hun

dred people expected to attend
Class activities, however, are
only part of the group's effort.
The group is also trying to pro
mote alumni interaction
through a number of innovative
programs.
"Home-Away-From-Home"
is one of the ideas intended to
bring alumni into direct contact
with students. In this program,
interested freshmen will be
matched with a local alumni
family. The student will then
join the family tor dinner at
least once each quarter. In addi

tion to providing an opportunity
for alumni to keep in touch with
their alma mater, the dinners
will provide students with a
change of pace from daily col
lege life.
It is hoped that students can
remain in contact with their
"families" throughout their
years at Stanford. This summer
future freshmen will be con
tacted by S.T.A.N, to invite
them to join the program.
"Experience by Degrees" is
another project organized by
S.T.A.N. It will provide stu
dents the opportunity to speak
with recent graduates holding
the same undergraduate aca
demic degree. Receptions will
include discussions on various
degrees such as English, his-

Tory, international relations,
human biology, psychology and
sociology On May 6, for exam
ple, a reception is planned for 20
alumni who graduated with po
litical science or economics
degrees.
Next year, S.T.A.N, hopes to
establish a "Day-on-the-Job"
program to give students a
chance to spend a day with a lo
cal alum at his or her place of
work to give students further in
sight into various careers. An
internship information day is
also being discussed. In addi
tion, various on-campus and off
campus internship programs
will be invited to set up tables in
White Plaza to give out informa
tion on opportunities they offer.
"There are so many internships

and very few people know about
them," said Nelson.
This year's programs have
been limited, however, due to
lack of funds, according to
ST.A.N. organizers. S.T.A.N, is
now operating on $1500 from the
Alumni Association. If a fee
assessment were approved the
organization would gain $8000.
In the A S.S.U. elections held on
April 16, however, ST.A.N. did
not garner enough votes to gain
the needed assessment.
S T A N, along with nine other
of the 17 organizations on the
ballot did not get the 20 percent
vote- needed to get an
a*»ses6ment. Various means of
funding these organizations are
now being considered by the
ASSU Senate.
