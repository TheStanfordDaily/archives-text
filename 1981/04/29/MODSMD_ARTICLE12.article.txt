# 'Chaparral' to celebrate its 75th
## 
### Trey Ellis 
The Hammer & Coffin society (H&C),
publisher of the Chaparral, will cele
brate its 75th anniversary this Saturday
at the San Erancisco Press Club. High
above the "City by the Bay," more than
200 Stanford funnymen will gather for an
evening of drunken merriment. From as
tar away as Paris and Australia, "old
farts" will relive the good old days with
their younger counterparts, reminiscing
about past run-ins with deans and other
administrative types.
Two of the more famous alumni atten
ding the banquet will be Everett Opie. a
cartoonist tor the New Yorker, and an ex
ecutive in the entertainment industry
whom the H&C "would rather not name
for fear of reprisals against his chil
dren," according to H&C member Bruce
Handy.
For all the women who helped publish
the Chaparral throughout the years, this
reunion will be a special one. At this
meeting some of the women will become
recognized members of the club for the
first time. Although Stanford has always
been coeducational, the H&C did not ac
cept females until 1975. Belore that time
they were allowed only to join the wom
en's auxiliary â€” which was considered to
be an inferior honor. At this reunion all
members of the old women's auxiliary
will be officiality admitted as full
fledged H&Cers.
The reunion promises to be a wild one.
Last year's banquet, held at Vanessi's on
Broadway in the City, ended when an un
identified H&C member urinated out of a
second floor window onto the sidewalk
below. All those interviewed hoped no
such mishap occurs this year. "It was a
most unfortunate incident . . . , but it's
kind of a tradition," said one member of
H&C, the mysterious Al X. Still, none
present would explain why 15 gallons of

cottage cheese now sit in a bucket of ice
in the Chappie office.
What is the H&C? "One purpose of the
Hammer & Coffin society is to preserve,
protect and defend the Stanford Chapar
ral . . . the other purpose is secret," said
current editor Mike Wilkins. But when
pressed, next year's editor, Doug
Steiner, boasted, "We are to the Elks,
Masons and Rotarians, what Porsche is
to Ford. Chevy and Chrysler."
Members of the Hammer & Coffin
were, however, willing to discuss their
public service and other charitable ac
tivities. "if we had any." quipped

Wilkins. "But seriously, we keep people
on their toes. When this campus starts
taking itself too seriously, we remind
them that 'it is better to have lived and
laughed than never to have lived at all."'
Wilkins recently ran on the H&C slate in
the Council of Presidents election. He
lost.
Surprisingly, the H&C claims to have

vast financial holdings in major corpo
rations. "Ask our thousands of high-tech
employees how the Silicon Valley got its
start." smirked H&C "economist"
Steiner. But when pressed to elaborate,
Steiner said. "If I told you the truth, you
wouldn't believe it. It's too con
troversial."
However, the H&C has always been
steeped in controversy. Four hours after
its inception on April 17,1906, the entire
Bay Area was reduced to rubble. When
asked if the secret society was in any
way responsible for the holocaust, Chap
pic Business Manager Jim Gable re
plied, "No! Emphatically not! In no
way, shape or form did we have anything
to do with that most unfortunate inci
dent."
In recent years, pranks have been the
trade the H&C. It all began when
one Hammer & Coffin member fed David
Jordan, Stanford's first president, some
of Jordan's own prize chickens. Then in
the 19405, according to Handy, one mem
ber. living in the then-male dorm Encina
Hall, would shoot at a bell in Hoover
Tower adding an extra note to its midday
song. Every day he would shoot and ev
ery day the carilloneur would get more
puzzled After weeks of investigation.
University officials found rifle shells
scattered all over the bell-room floor.
Then it was just a simple matter of ex
amining trajectories and waiting until he
struck again. The mischievous culprit
was severly punished. "Just one more
example of Hammer &, Coffin per
secution by the uptight administration,"
said A 1 N, another mysterious figure,
and an H&C groupie.
In recent years, according to many
here, H&C has not done anything particu
larly funny.
