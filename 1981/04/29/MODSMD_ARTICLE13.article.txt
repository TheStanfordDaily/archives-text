## Computer facilities inadequate 
### 
For a school considered number one in the com
puter science field, Stanford shows woefully little
interest in taking advantage of the greatest
educational tool to come along since the printing
press. It is content with providing just enough
computer resources to handle the courses which
explicitly require the use of a computer. For
years it has been apparent that it has not even
been doing this much
Yet for a school which offers no bachelor's
degree in computer science, the University has an
awful lot of undergraduates who think some
knowledge of computers is useful to them in their
own field. LOTS is used by thousands of students
each quarter. It is probably the single most widely
used resource on campus, and certainly the most
thoroughly used. Right now, due to underfunding.
it is so overloaded that it is nearly impossible to
use.
One way to understand just how little sense this
makes is to compare LOTS to the libraries, which
are traditionally the most widely used academic
resource. The libraries here are reasonably well
funded. Meyer even enjoys the luxury ot allowing
entrance to the general public. Imagine that Stan
ford funded its libraries the way it funds its com
puter system. The one library generally available
to students might be called the Stanford Minimum
Investment Dangerously General Educational
Nook, and this is what it might be like:
SMIDGEN Library is located in one of the
lJuildings occupied by the School of Education,
which has kindly allowed the library the use ot
halt of the first floor. It is the only library avail
able to students without charge, except tor some
smaller ones owned jointly by the departments of
English and history, are used only by their
graduate students for doing research projects.
Because of its limited facilities. SMIDGEN
may only be used by students taking classes which
explicity require the use of the library. Each stu
dent may use it for up to two hours a week per unit
of such classwork. but everyone gets unlimited
use after 2 a.m. As a result, many English majors
develop nocturnal habits, staying up until 4 a m
to finish their reading and sleeping through their
morning classes.
In spite of the restrictions on its use. SMIDGEN
is crowded at all hours of the day and night. You
usually have to wait for several hours to get into
the building, and are allowed to work for only an
hour and a halt at a time; after that you must get
back in line. Once in. you rarely have a book all to
yourself; you have to share it with several other
people.
Fortunately, the books have been read so often
that they've fallen apart, and there is no money to
rebind them. This makes is possible for several
people to read one book at once, by swapping
pages. Of course, the pages you want usually wind

up on the floor, so it can take hours of grueling
work just to do five pages of required reading. The
professors have reduced their standards accord
ingly.
SMIDGENs three staff members are very con
cerned about these problems They feel that many
of them are due to student abuse. Students who
edit their papers by the cut-paste-and-copy meth
od are supposed to use the standard hand-cranked
ditto machine described in the SMIDGEN Over
view Manual. But many refuse, claiming that the
machine is frustrating to use, and insist on using
the sleek copying machine donated by MIT, which
the SMIDGEN staff keeps hidden in a back room.
Besides being too expensive to run.it is too easy to
use and only encourages students to do more copy
ing instead of spending more of their own time de
ciding how to do their work with the least drain on
the"library's resources.
Even worse, some people like to read books
from the light fiction collection-books which have
nothing to do with coursework This is only al
lowed at those rare times when the library is rela
tively uncrowded. The staff is thinking if for
bidding it entirely and disposing of the collection
Besides contributing to the severe shelf space
shortage, the availability of these books tends to
encourage the use of the library. It gives people
the idea that the library is a place where they can
just come in and read, instead of doing serious
work.
There have been many cases where a student
who had never read a book before has come into
the library to read some light fiction, and enjoyed
it enough to take an English class the next quarter
and start reading other books. Clearly, this is a se
rious problem.
In order to discourage overuse,
posts a list of its heaviest readers, marking it
"Pig List" in large letters, in the hope of shaming
therji into curtailing their reading. Most of these
people are doing more than the assigned reading
for their classes: they actually read for fun. The
staff considers them parasites, but tolerates them
because they do volunteer work in exchange tor
extra hours. (They are allowed in the building
while working and get an extra hour for every two
hours of work).
I don't think anyone would stand for it if the li
braries got this bad. But libraries have been
around for a long time; everyone knows their val
ue. and demand for them doesn't usually double
every tew years. It is easy to fail to notice the in
creased need for computer facilities until it is too
late. (Too late means that a lot of potential appli
cants decide to find a place that can offer them
better resources). It is time to notice, and at least
give LOTS enough money lor a second computer.

better resources). It is time to notice, and at least
give LOTS enough money lor a second computer.

For a school considered number one in the com
puter science field, Stanford shows woefully little
interest in taking advantage of the greatest
educational tool to come along since the printing
press. It is content with providing just enough
computer resources to handle the courses which
explicitly require the use of a computer. For
years it has been apparent that it has not even
been doing this much
Yet for a school which offers no bachelor's
degree in computer science, the University has an
awful lot of undergraduates who think some
knowledge of computers is useful to them in their
own field. LOTS is used by thousands of students
each quarter. It is probably the single most widely
used resource on campus, and certainly the most
thoroughly used. Right now, due to underfunding.
it is so overloaded that it is nearly impossible to
use.
One way to understand just how little sense this
makes is to compare LOTS to the libraries, which
are traditionally the most widely used academic
resource. The libraries here are reasonably well
funded. Meyer even enjoys the luxury ot allowing
entrance to the general public. Imagine that Stan
ford funded its libraries the way it funds its com
puter system. The one library generally available
to students might be called the Stanford Minimum
Investment Dangerously General Educational
Nook, and this is what it might be like:
SMIDGEN Library is located in one of the
lJuildings occupied by the School of Education,
which has kindly allowed the library the use ot
halt of the first floor. It is the only library avail
able to students without charge, except tor some
smaller ones owned jointly by the departments of
English and history, are used only by their
graduate students for doing research projects.
Because of its limited facilities. SMIDGEN
may only be used by students taking classes which
explicity require the use of the library. Each stu
dent may use it for up to two hours a week per unit
of such classwork. but everyone gets unlimited
use after 2 a.m. As a result, many English majors
develop nocturnal habits, staying up until 4 a m
to finish their reading and sleeping through their
morning classes.
In spite of the restrictions on its use. SMIDGEN
is crowded at all hours of the day and night. You
usually have to wait for several hours to get into
the building, and are allowed to work for only an
hour and a halt at a time; after that you must get
back in line. Once in. you rarely have a book all to
yourself; you have to share it with several other
people.
Fortunately, the books have been read so often
that they've fallen apart, and there is no money to
rebind them. This makes is possible for several
people to read one book at once, by swapping
pages. Of course, the pages you want usually wind

up on the floor, so it can take hours of grueling
work just to do five pages of required reading. The
professors have reduced their standards accord
ingly.
SMIDGENs three staff members are very con
cerned about these problems They feel that many
of them are due to student abuse. Students who
edit their papers by the cut-paste-and-copy meth
od are supposed to use the standard hand-cranked
ditto machine described in the SMIDGEN Over
view Manual. But many refuse, claiming that the
machine is frustrating to use, and insist on using
the sleek copying machine donated by MIT, which
the SMIDGEN staff keeps hidden in a back room.
Besides being too expensive to run.it is too easy to
use and only encourages students to do more copy
ing instead of spending more of their own time de
ciding how to do their work with the least drain on
the"library's resources.
Even worse, some people like to read books
from the light fiction collection-books which have
nothing to do with coursework This is only al
lowed at those rare times when the library is rela
tively uncrowded. The staff is thinking if for
bidding it entirely and disposing of the collection
Besides contributing to the severe shelf space
shortage, the availability of these books tends to
encourage the use of the library. It gives people
the idea that the library is a place where they can
just come in and read, instead of doing serious
work.
There have been many cases where a student
who had never read a book before has come into
the library to read some light fiction, and enjoyed
it enough to take an English class the next quarter
and start reading other books. Clearly, this is a se
rious problem.
In order to discourage overuse,
posts a list of its heaviest readers, marking it
"Pig List" in large letters, in the hope of shaming
therji into curtailing their reading. Most of these
people are doing more than the assigned reading
for their classes: they actually read for fun. The
staff considers them parasites, but tolerates them
because they do volunteer work in exchange tor
extra hours. (They are allowed in the building
while working and get an extra hour for every two
hours of work).
I don't think anyone would stand for it if the li
braries got this bad. But libraries have been
around for a long time; everyone knows their val
ue. and demand for them doesn't usually double
every tew years. It is easy to fail to notice the in
creased need for computer facilities until it is too
late. (Too late means that a lot of potential appli
cants decide to find a place that can offer them
better resources). It is time to notice, and at least
give LOTS enough money lor a second computer.
