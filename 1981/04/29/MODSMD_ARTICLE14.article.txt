## Chris Cramer/Cindi Wheeler Mascot unrecognized: a 'Cardinal' sin 
### 
"What a stupid idea to have
the color cardinal as the official
Stanford mascot!" This
statement often dribbles from
the mouths of students these
days, and the record should be
set straight. Unrealized by most
people, the color cardinal is
steeped in Stanford history and
is .the most appropriate mascot
for the University.
Cardinal is the official color
of the University. However, it
has not always been so. Back in
the fall of 1891, a powerful con
troversy convulsed the Univer
sity campus. Various student
body meetings were held to
select an official color for the
new university. At those heated
meetings, a red silk
hankerchief, now kept in the
Stanford Archives, was vigor
ously waved in support of adopt
ing the color cardinal â€” but to

no avail.
Gold was finally chosen. A
few months later, in the spring
of : 892. final preparations were
underway for the first Stanford-
California football game. Unex
pectedly. a special meeting of
the Stanford student body was
called. The small, unrepresen
tative group of students in atten
dance reversed the decision of
the previous fall and adopted
cardinal as the school color.
An uproar ensued, bitterly
dividing the campus. The day of
the first Big Game, Mar. 19.
1892. saw half of the Stanford
fans clad in red and the other
half wearing gold. The re
porters present mistook the
gold-shired Stanford fans for
Cal rooters and when Stanford
unexpectedly won 14-10, the
headlines of the San Francisco
Sunday papers screamed

CARDINAL TRIUMPHS
O'ER GOLD AND BLUE. The
color controversy at Stanford
had been settled by the Press.
For the next 30 years. Stanford
and its athletic teams were
almost exclusively identified by
the nickname "Cardinals."
In the early 19205, the press
began referring to Stanford's
athletic squads as the Indians,
perhaps because the red jerseys
they wore made them
"Redskins." The name caught
on and the Indian was officially
adopted as the school mascot by
an ASSU executive committee
in 1930. In : 972, 42 years later,
after the Native American com
munity had made its objections
known, the Stanford Athletic
Dept. reverted to the nickname
Cardinals in lieu of the Indian
mascot.
It should be noted here that
the color cardinal was never the
University mascot. The only of
ficial mascot the school has
ever had was the Indian. How
ever. with the Indian mascot
properly and permanently dis
posed of, the color cardinal
should now be adopted as the
school mascot, thereby keeping
the traditional nickname
cardinals tor the University's
athletic teams. Our reasons are
many.
The color cardinal, as already
demonstrated, has tremendous
historical significance for the
University. We have been
"Cardinals" for 47 years, Indi
ans for only 42. So purists and
many conservative alumni
should support permanently re
instating the original nickname
cardinals. Also, it would be fit
tingly ironic if a school color
born in controversy could end
the mascot controversy.
Having cardinal as our school

mascot would aptly capture the
whimsical spirit ot this cam
pus, poking fun at the idea of
even having a mascot by adopt
ing a color as one. Cardinal
would be as nebulous and un
defined as the student body
itself, allowing each individual
to develop his own creative un
derstanding of and appreciation
tor the University mascot.
Now consider two other
meanings of the word
"cardinal" besides bright red.
"Cardinal," according to
Webster's means "ot main im
portance." Does this not aptly
characterize the preeminent
position of our school among
U.S. universities? And every
student is familiar with the four
Cardinal virtues so prevalent
here at Stanford: justice,
prudence, fortitude, and tem
perance!
Regardless of what action the
Mascot Selection Committee
finally takes, some things will
remain the same. The tree will
still be the symbol of the Band,
and those silly looking griffins
will remain in front of the Ath
letic Dept. And no doubt some
insensitive alumni will continue
to push tor reinstating the Indi
an mascot.
But those offensive and inef
fective cries of "bring back the
Indian" should really be re
placed by more fervent and
more historically accurate
shouts to permanently "bring
back the Cardinals." The time
has come to once again pull out
that famous red silk hand
kerchief waved almost 90 years
ago, using it as a rallying point
around which to reunite the
school and end the mascot con
troversy forever.
