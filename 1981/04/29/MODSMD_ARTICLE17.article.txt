## Applaud Watt's domestic policies 
### 
As a peace-loving member, of
this society, I find it difficult to
understand why anyone would
denounce the policies pro
mulgated by Interior Secretary
James Watt or call tor his re
moval. If the United States is
unable to develop its domestic
energy and mineral resources,
it will become increasingly de
pendent on the goodwill ot na
tions otten hostile, or under
pinned by an American military
presence for ensured provisions
until alternative processes or
synthetics are invented.
Sqch dependence on others
for support ot our industrial
base cannot be considered char
acteristic of a great, independ
ent power. As an illustrative
analogy. I offer the scenario in
which we had built the space
shuttle by virtue of unsurpassed

technical knowledge, but the
Russians held the key dictating
its missions.
Such scenarios increasingly
seem to be indicative of Ameri
can foreign policy in the last
decade. We have had to make
the difficult choice to vigorously
support the supremacist South
African regime despite the
legacy of our Civil War and in
defiance of the hallowed visage
of the Great Emancipator star
ing at Congress from the other
end of Capitol Mall. The Saudis
have vigorously protested the
accumulation of a strategic pe
troleum reserve which would
negate the threat of a future pro
longed OPEC embargo; we
have acquiesced. The Danes
have signed a treaty with the
Saudis whereby an implicit veto
of Danish foreign policy was
granted to the latter.
Moreover, we are being told
by the Saudis that we owe them
the masterpiece of American
conventional military hard
ware, the AWAC aircraft. This
is despite the perceived in
stability of the House of Saud
which unnecessarily places a
valuable military secret in the
hands ot others whose fate is
dubious at best.
Although the prospect of a
future Arab oil embargo has had
the beneficial result of changing
American foreign policy in the
Middle East from unswerving
endorsement ot Israel right or
wrong, to a more even-handed
stance in recognition of the
claims of the people ot Palestine
to a West Bank state does
not threaten the security ot Is
rael, the potential exists where
by the unthinkable position of
being prepared to sacrifice the
integrity of Israel for continued
oil supply might someday be
considered.
Former President Jimmy
Carter asserted that any further
Soviet thrusts toward the Per
sian Gulf-Arabian Sea will be
met by appropriate American
military action; the Reagan ad
ministration has embellished
such warnings. Even When the
United States was the unrivaled
military power on the globe, de
fense of 12,000 miles
away without a torce already in
place and unrestricted access to
forward supply bases against

armies ot preponderant num
bers operating only 700 miles
trom their home base would
have been extremely difficult.
If this nation is to effectively
back its words with armed
might in this instance, tactical
nuclear weapons will have to be
introduced; we would have to
press the button first. A little
more coal exhaust or more off
shore oil platforms on the con
tinental shelf seems a bargain if
we can extricate ourselves from
having to make the nuclear de
cision.
Further, especially in the
Midpeninsula area, such rabid
environmentalism and Sierra
Club membership tend to be lux
uries of wealth; as most peopje
here and in Los Angeles who'
profess this are not in marginal
financial straits, a few extra
dollars added to a tank of gas or
tor valuble minerals will be of
little effect.
Also, as these same individ
uals derive their wealth from
the economies of such con
gested areas, they often seek to
vacation away from the areas
whose environment they
fostered; this being so, they
wish that the hinterland be kept
inviolably pristine for them to
enjoy a few days a year. As they
realize that they have strength
in numbers on the state level as
well as the federal, they seek to
employ these governmental
agencies on their behalf to dic
tate the course ot development
in these hinterland areas.
A good case in point was the
proposed Disney Mineral King
development which was over
whelmingly supported by the
residents ot Tulare County,
where it was to be located. It
was stymied by backpackers of
the Sierra Club who would only
be around seven days a year,
who ignored the wishes ot the
area residents. However, many
of the same who opposed the
Mineral King development wish
the Peripheral Canal to be built,
tapping the water of Northern
California, and are benefitting
from the rape of the Owens Val
ley to supply thirsty Los Angel
es.
Unwittingly, a pernicious
domestic economic im
perialism is the result pro
mulgated by people in metropol

itan areas under the banner of
environmentalism. Unlike their
metropolitan counterparts,
those in the areas affected by
these environmental-economic
decisions cannot pick up and go
home after a vacation. They are
saddled with bourgeoning wel
fare rolls as they are forced to
sustain an unstable cyclical
tourist economy as their only
means of support.
When the Department of Ag
riculture curtailed logging in
the Northern California coastal
counties of Del Norte, Hum
boldt, and Mendocino, the areas
became economic backwaters
with only marijuana cultivation
to take up the slack. Resource
extraction is overwhelmingly
favored in such areas as evi
denced by unemployed loggers
jamming Capitol Mall.
The most hypocritical fact of
the matter is that those who are
best able to subsidize the high
price of rare materials are
those best able to hire lawyers
in efforts to evade draft laws.
Those who are unwilling to pay
the blood tax necessary to de
fend the liberty they enjoy and
economic benefits which are re
sultant have no basis to oppose
the development of domestic re
sources.
To sustain the liberties we ap
preciate without the bloodshed
which will ultimately result
from overseas dependence on
strategic material, all domestic
resources will have to be fully
and aggressively developed.
Further, this will improve the
lot of those in the areas in which
these resources rest by provid
ing a stable base for the local
economies.
One cannot have it both ways
it one wants to enjoy the bene
fits of this society; either
further extraction and limited
desecration in necessary cir
cumstances, or a draft and a
large military force to be used
often, is needed to ensure the
safety ot overseas supplies. If
one accepts the fruits of the
United States, the former
seems to be the less exacting.
Thus, we should all be thanking
Watt for doing us a favor.

those in the areas affected by
these environmental-economic
decisions cannot pick up and go
home after a vacation. They are
saddled with bourgeoning wel
fare rolls as they are forced to
sustain an unstable cyclical
tourist economy as their only
means of support.
When the Department of Ag
riculture curtailed logging in
the Northern California coastal
counties of Del Norte, Hum
boldt, and Mendocino, the areas
became economic backwaters
with only marijuana cultivation
to take up the slack. Resource
extraction is overwhelmingly
favored in such areas as evi
denced by unemployed loggers
jamming Capitol Mall.
The most hypocritical fact of
the matter is that those who are
best able to subsidize the high
price of rare materials are
those best able to hire lawyers
in efforts to evade draft laws.
Those who are unwilling to pay
the blood tax necessary to de
fend the liberty they enjoy and
economic benefits which are re
sultant have no basis to oppose
the development of domestic re
sources.
To sustain the liberties we ap
preciate without the bloodshed
which will ultimately result
from overseas dependence on
strategic material, all domestic
resources will have to be fully
and aggressively developed.
Further, this will improve the
lot of those in the areas in which
these resources rest by provid
ing a stable base for the local
economies.
One cannot have it both ways
it one wants to enjoy the bene
fits of this society; either
further extraction and limited
desecration in necessary cir
cumstances, or a draft and a
large military force to be used
often, is needed to ensure the
safety ot overseas supplies. If
one accepts the fruits of the
United States, the former
seems to be the less exacting.
Thus, we should all be thanking
Watt for doing us a favor.

As a peace-loving member, of
this society, I find it difficult to
understand why anyone would
denounce the policies pro
mulgated by Interior Secretary
James Watt or call tor his re
moval. If the United States is
unable to develop its domestic
energy and mineral resources,
it will become increasingly de
pendent on the goodwill ot na
tions otten hostile, or under
pinned by an American military
presence for ensured provisions
until alternative processes or
synthetics are invented.
Sqch dependence on others
for support ot our industrial
base cannot be considered char
acteristic of a great, independ
ent power. As an illustrative
analogy. I offer the scenario in
which we had built the space
shuttle by virtue of unsurpassed

technical knowledge, but the
Russians held the key dictating
its missions.
Such scenarios increasingly
seem to be indicative of Ameri
can foreign policy in the last
decade. We have had to make
the difficult choice to vigorously
support the supremacist South
African regime despite the
legacy of our Civil War and in
defiance of the hallowed visage
of the Great Emancipator star
ing at Congress from the other
end of Capitol Mall. The Saudis
have vigorously protested the
accumulation of a strategic pe
troleum reserve which would
negate the threat of a future pro
longed OPEC embargo; we
have acquiesced. The Danes
have signed a treaty with the
Saudis whereby an implicit veto
of Danish foreign policy was
granted to the latter.
Moreover, we are being told
by the Saudis that we owe them
the masterpiece of American
conventional military hard
ware, the AWAC aircraft. This
is despite the perceived in
stability of the House of Saud
which unnecessarily places a
valuable military secret in the
hands ot others whose fate is
dubious at best.
Although the prospect of a
future Arab oil embargo has had
the beneficial result of changing
American foreign policy in the
Middle East from unswerving
endorsement ot Israel right or
wrong, to a more even-handed
stance in recognition of the
claims of the people ot Palestine
to a West Bank state does
not threaten the security ot Is
rael, the potential exists where
by the unthinkable position of
being prepared to sacrifice the
integrity of Israel for continued
oil supply might someday be
considered.
Former President Jimmy
Carter asserted that any further
Soviet thrusts toward the Per
sian Gulf-Arabian Sea will be
met by appropriate American
military action; the Reagan ad
ministration has embellished
such warnings. Even When the
United States was the unrivaled
military power on the globe, de
fense of 12,000 miles
away without a torce already in
place and unrestricted access to
forward supply bases against

armies ot preponderant num
bers operating only 700 miles
trom their home base would
have been extremely difficult.
If this nation is to effectively
back its words with armed
might in this instance, tactical
nuclear weapons will have to be
introduced; we would have to
press the button first. A little
more coal exhaust or more off
shore oil platforms on the con
tinental shelf seems a bargain if
we can extricate ourselves from
having to make the nuclear de
cision.
Further, especially in the
Midpeninsula area, such rabid
environmentalism and Sierra
Club membership tend to be lux
uries of wealth; as most peopje
here and in Los Angeles who'
profess this are not in marginal
financial straits, a few extra
dollars added to a tank of gas or
tor valuble minerals will be of
little effect.
Also, as these same individ
uals derive their wealth from
the economies of such con
gested areas, they often seek to
vacation away from the areas
whose environment they
fostered; this being so, they
wish that the hinterland be kept
inviolably pristine for them to
enjoy a few days a year. As they
realize that they have strength
in numbers on the state level as
well as the federal, they seek to
employ these governmental
agencies on their behalf to dic
tate the course ot development
in these hinterland areas.
A good case in point was the
proposed Disney Mineral King
development which was over
whelmingly supported by the
residents ot Tulare County,
where it was to be located. It
was stymied by backpackers of
the Sierra Club who would only
be around seven days a year,
who ignored the wishes ot the
area residents. However, many
of the same who opposed the
Mineral King development wish
the Peripheral Canal to be built,
tapping the water of Northern
California, and are benefitting
from the rape of the Owens Val
ley to supply thirsty Los Angel
es.
Unwittingly, a pernicious
domestic economic im
perialism is the result pro
mulgated by people in metropol

itan areas under the banner of
environmentalism. Unlike their
metropolitan counterparts,
those in the areas affected by
these environmental-economic
decisions cannot pick up and go
