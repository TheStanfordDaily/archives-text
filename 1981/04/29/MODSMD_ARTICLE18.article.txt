Remote viewing
The Daily of April 10 carried
an article by a Stanford gradu
ate student, Jerry Russell,
which criticized our research
into "remote viewing," an ap
parent ability to perceive dis
tant locations by so-called "par
anormal" means.
Russell's criticism rests en
tirely on repeating earlier
criticisms put forward by two
New Zealand psychologists,
Marks and Kammann. Ap
parently unknown to Russell is
the fact that detaled analyses
and empirical tests ot the M&K
criticisms, showing them to be
invalid, have been published in
Nature and elsewhere (see,
e.g., Target al., Nature, March
13, 1980). Beyond that, further
amplification of these
criticisms in M&K's book The
Psychology of the Psychic (ref
erenced by Russell) are simply
incorrect, being based on their
erroneous assumptions as to the
order of target usage in series ot
remote viewing trials, and their
lack of understanding of ran
domization techniques used to
label subject transcripts and
target lists.
Also needing correction here
is Russell's characterization ot
the remote viewing work as "ir
reproducible." This is con
tradicted by the fact that the re
mote viewing work has been

successfully'replicated in sever
al laboratories, including Mun
delein College in Chicago, J. B
Rhine's laboratory in Durham,
and, most recently, a laboratory
under the direction of the dean
of the School of Engineering and
Applied Science at Princeton
University. In these labora
tories typically half of the re
mote viewing trials or better
are of such quality as to permit
blind matching of subject tran
scripts to target sites, results
which far exceed what is re
quired for statistical signifi
cance.
With regard to such
matching, Russell's portrayal
of judging as a "Rorschach
test'' irvwhich a judge can "read
in" matches where there are
none shows a complete lack of
understanding of the judging
process. All judging is done on a
double-blind basis — not know
ing which transcript goes with
which target site — so' that any
tendency to "read in" matches
applies across the board, and is
therefore of no use.in helping a
judge to discriminate correct
target/transcript 'matchings.
What, then, is the state-of-art
in remote viewing research?
The quality of description gen
erated in remote viewing trials
is best demonstrated by ex
amples.
In our original nine-trial

series with a gifted subject,
when the target site was a boat
marine, the subject gave a con
sistent narrative that began
with "What I'm looking at is a
little boat jetty or boat dock
along the bay." For a Hoover
Tower site, the subject sum
marized impressions with the
statement "The area — I have a
place — seems like it would be
Hoover Tower." For a recrea
tional swimming pool site with a
75' x 100' rectangular pool and
and a 110' circular pool, the sub
ject made a drawing of two
pools of water, which he
dimensioned as a 60' x 89' rec
tangular pool and a 120'
diameter circular pool; and so
forth.
Blind judging of this series
confirmed objectively the sub
jective impression of above
chance correspondence that one
infers from examples such as
these; seven out of nine
target/transcript pairs were
blind matched correctly.
The ongoing replication of
these results in our own and oth
er laboratories, the bulk of
which is successful, continues to
provide support for the
hypothesis that remote viewing
is a viable human perceptual
capability.
