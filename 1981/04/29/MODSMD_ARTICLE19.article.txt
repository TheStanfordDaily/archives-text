## Body discovered in Atlanta river 
### 
Atlanta lAP) —Just as police were decid
ing not to add Jimmy Ray Payne's name to a
list of 25 slain and missing young blacks, the
body of the 21-year-old was found floating in
a river — the fifth body to be dumped in an
area river in less than a month, police say.
A few hours later, Public Safety Com
missioner Lee Brown said that the death of
the 5-foot-7, 130-pound man will be in
vestigated by the task force probing the 25
deaths and disappearances, which began 21
months ago.
The cause of Payne's death was not de
termined immediately and medical of
ficials said his body, found Monday, bore no
obvious injuries. An autopsy was to be per
formed today. Brown said at a news con
ference.
Police are worried about a change in pat
tern, Brown said, because "we now have
four adult victims of homicides. Previous to
that, all the victims were under 16, the
youngest being 7."

All the adult cases have similarities, in
cluding the fact that the bodies were found
in rivers, he said.
"Our people have been meeting all eve
ning to determine what this means," he said
late Monday.
Payne was last seen April 22 as he headed
for the Omni sporting and entertainment
complex in hopes of selling some old coins,
4 according to his sister, Evelyn.
He lived about a block from the home of
Patrick Baltazar, 11, who was last seen
alive at the Omni. Baltazar's body was
found Feb. 13 in a DeKalb County office
park.
Like 13 of the other victims, Baltazar had
been asphyxiated. Six of the last seven vic
tims were asphyxiated or probably asphyx
iated, authorities said. The cause of one vic
tim's death was unknown.
Payne's body was found in the Chat
tahoochee River, just north of Bankhead
Highway, which runs northwest out of At

lanta. Four of the other victims lived or
were staying in residential areas north ot
that highway, in an area a mile or two closer
to the inner city.
They were Milton Harvey, found Nov. 5,
1979; Curtis Walker, March 6; Clifford
Jones, August 21, 1980; and Terrv Pue, Jan
13.
Payne's body, tangled lace-down in a
fallen tree, was spotted by two fishermen,
about the time police were deciding not to
put his name on the list of cases being in
vestigated by the special task force.
Brown said police had been given in
formation that Payne had been seen alive.
The sighting reports on Payne were simi
lar to those that trickled into the Missing
Persons Bureau after Timothy Hill disap
peared March 13. Hill's case was not added
to the task force list until after his body was
pulled from the Chattahoochee on March 30,
about 15 miles downstream from where
Pavne's body was spotted.
