# Reagan says he's better but economy is still sick
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Still recovering from
his gunshot wound but determined to
build new momentum for his econom
ic program. President Ronald Reagan
told a joint session of Congress last
night that he himself is "much im
proved," but that the nation's econo
my continues to be in poor health
The passage of his program, he de
clared, is essential to "lift the
crushing burden of inflation oft ot our
citizens."
The president's appearance before
cheering members of the House and
Senate — only 29 days after being shot
and on the eve of his 100 th day in office
— was a personal and political
triumph that promised to bring new
pressure to bear on Congress to pass
his tax-cutting and budget-cutting pro
posals.
In warning against repeating "the
mistakes of the past," Reagan said:
"The old and comfortable way is to
shave a little here and add a little
there. Well, that's not acceptable any
more. I think this great and historic
Congress knows that that is no longer
acceptable."
Tightened security
Congressional police officials no
ticeably tightened up their security
precautions for Reagan's appearance.
One spectator who arrived on Capitol
Hill an hour before the president's ad
dress had to present his credentials
for inspection eight times from the
moment he arrived by cab on the
Capitol grounds until he reached the
gallery of the House chamber where
the president spoke.
Before Reagan arrived, German
shepherd dogs patrolled the area
around the chamber, sniffing tor ex
plosives. As is customary, the presi
dent's limousine delivered him to a
side door of the Capitol, while spec
tators were kept 100 yards away.
Reagan, walking a little stiffly, but
smiling and shaking hands with mem
bers ot both parties, marched to the
podium of the House to a tumultous ov

ation.
The president appeared thinner
than before he was shot on March 30.
And as he started speaking, he choked
with emotion. But he was in good hu
mor, as always.
'Get well quick'
Ad libbing as he usually does, he told
of receiving a letter from a second
grader who wrote, "I hope you get
well quick. If you don't you might have
to make a speech in your pajamas."
The House chamber roared with
laughter and the pesident added that
the youngster had included a p.s.: "If
you do have to make a speech in your
pajamas, I warned you." That set off
another round of laughter.
Reagan appeared to move with
greater stiffness in his torso than nor
mal and held his arm close to his body
as he shook hands with the con
gressional leaders who greeted him.
Apparently relishing being back in
the middle of a congressional fight,
Reagan endorsed a substitute econom
ic program dratted by Republicans
and conservative Democrats that is
strikingly similar to his own — except
for providing $6.1 billion more in
spending cuts. At the same time, he
strongly denounced a spending pro
posal offered by the Democratic-con
trolled House Budget Committee.
Supports substitute bill
The substitute measure he sup
ports, proposed by Reps. Delbert Lat
ta (R-Ohio) and Phil Gramm (D-Tex
as) would "achieve all the essential
aims of controlling government
spending and reducing the tax burden ;
building a national defense second to
none, and stimulating economic
growth creating millions of new
jobs," Reagan said.
But the alternative proposed by the
House Budget Committee, he said,
projects more in spending than the
substitute proposal does, cuts more
than $14 billion in "essential defense"
funding, and "adheres to the failed
policy of trying to balance the budget
on the taxpayer's back."

"In short," Reagan said, "the com
mittee measure reflects an echo of the
past rather than a benchmark for the
future. High taxes and excess spend
ing growth created our present eco
nomic mess, more of the same will not
cure the hardship, anxiety, and dis
couragement it has imposed on the
American people."
Reagan began his 15-minute speech
by saying he wanted to digress from
"the all-important subject" of govern
ment spending and taxes and "say a
few words directly to all of you and to
those who are watching and listening
tonight."
Appreciation expressed
"This is the only way I know to ex
press to you on behalf of Nancy and
myself our appreciation for your
messages, your flowers, and most of
all, your prayers — not only for me but
for those others who fell beside me,"

he said.
The assassination attempt that left
Reagan with a bullet wound in the lung
also resulted in gunshot wounds to a
Secret Service agent and a District of
Columbia policeman, both of whom
been released from the hospital
and are recovering, and to press sec
retary James Brady, who is still hospi
talized and in serious condition with a
brain wound.
"The warmth of your words, the ex
presssion of friendship and, yes. love,
meant more to us than you can ever
know," Reagan told the American
people. "You have given us a memory
we'll treasure forever. And you've
provided the answer to those few
voices that were raised saying that
what happened was evidence that ours
is a sick society.
"The society we heard from is made
