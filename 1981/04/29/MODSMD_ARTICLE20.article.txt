# Chattahoochee: a gruesome setting
## 
### Washington Post 
Atlanta — In what has be
come a gruesome, gather-at
dusk ritual along the Chat
tahoochee River, police Monday
night recovered the decom
posed body of a black male, Jim
my Ray Payne, clad in red
shorts — possibly another vic
tim in the string of slayings of 25
young blacks here since July
1979.
Redding wouldn't say if
Payne would be added to the
task force's list of 25 blacks who
were murdered — all but two of
them males — and one 10-year
old boy missing since Septem
ber. But Redding's presence
was foreboding on a sultry
spring night along the muddy
river.
Cobb County Public Safety
Director Bob Hightower said

the body was that of a small
black male, and appeared to
have been in the water for a
week or two.
It took rescue units more than
an hour to retrieve the body,
which had snagged on debris in
the river.
The body was discovered
about 3 p.m. by Tony Gibbs, 23, a
house painter who had just
downed a few beers on his day
off and landed two small catfish
when he noticed "something
floating down the river that
looked like a body." climbed out
on a tree limb and saw a pair of
shoulder blades bobbing in the
water.
"I fish up here a lot," said
Gibbs. "But I never expected to
catch anything like that."
"It looked like an inner tube,"
said Mark Arnold, 22, Gibbs'

stepbrother and fishing compa
nion. "I didn't know what it
was."
Together, the two ran up from
the bank shouting, "There's a
body down there," said Jessie
Grimes, 13, an Bth grader who
took the day oft from school to
help his father, a welder for a
heavy equipment company, on
the river. Jessie reluctantly re
turned to the river with the pair
— "I was scared because you
don't know who you can trust
these days" — and said he saw
the body of a black male face
down in the water "stuck in the
weeds. He was wearing red
shorts, nothing else. His back
was bare."
Five bodies — including the
one found Monday — have been
found in the Chattahoochee;
three were discovered in or near

the South River.
The 25th victim, Michael
Cameron Mcintosh, 23, was
pulled from the Chattahoochee
on April 20. He was buried here
Monday.
