# Boston schools go bankrupt
## 
### 
Boston (AP) — The last pen
nies trickled out of the coffers of
the nation's oldest public school
system yesterday, but Boston
Mayor Kevin White said he had
no money to bail out the schools
and pledged to fight if a judge
ordered the city to keep them
open.
"The schools have overspent
by $40 million, but what do you
do?" said White, locked in a bit
ter dispute with the City Council
over funding. "We don't want to
close them and we can't print
money."
Superior Court Judge Thomas
Morse said last week in extend

ing a previous deadline for a
solution that the city would have
to come up with aid by today or
he would order White to keep
schools open for 64,000 students
until June.
But White said Monday the
judge "can't do it unless he
helps us find some money," and
said he would appeal any such
court order.
"It's a simple question — it's
nice to say we'll stay open, but
what do you do the next day?"
White said.
School officials said their $210
million budget would run out to
day. The mayor and his foes on

the city council have tried for
weeks to agree on a plan to float
bonds to raise the $30 million
needed to keep the schools open
for the 180 days required by
state law.
The city also must repay $90
million in court-ordered proper
ty tax rebates and is trying to
cope with budget cutbacks man
dated by Proposition 2'/2, a tax
cutting measure approved by
the voters.
The council's various spend
ing programs have carried
amendments that would curb
White's authority over the city
budget and would allow voters
to recall him and other munici
pal officials from office.
Charles Haar. a court-ap
pointed mediator, said last
week that a compromise was
being blocked by "political in
fighting."
Officials said before classes
adjourned for spring break
April 16 that the schools' budget
was exhausted and classes could
not reopen without aid. But of
ficials said Friday there was
enough in the budget — about $3
million — to keep the schools
open for the first two days of
this week.
