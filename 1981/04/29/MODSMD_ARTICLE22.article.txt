Cape Canaveral, Fla. (AP) — The space shuttle Columbia,
perched atop a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, completed its trip back to
Florida yesterday, touching down not far from the spot where it
blasted into space two weeks ago.
The shuttle left Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma at 8:01 a.m.
EDT, soaring into a clear blue sky with the mercury at 64 degrees.
The flight to Florida's Atlantic coast lasted about 3V2 hours.
Although Tinker was closed to the public yesterday morning,
thousands of people watched the take-off from nearby highways.
The shuttle arrived there Monday afternoon to a cheering crowd of
about 200,000 Oklahomans. The sightseers backed up traffic about
two miles on Interstate 40, which runs by the sprawling military
base in southeast Oklahoma City.
The overnight stopover was intended as a refueling stop for the
shuttle's carrier.
The final leg of the piggy-back flight took the jet and its precious
cargo over Greenville, Ark.; Jackson and Meridian, Miss.; Selma,
Montgomery, Troy and Dothan, Ala.; and Tallahassee, Ocala and
Orlando, Fla. to the space center.
The spacecraft terry touched down at 11:25 a.m. EDT to the
cheers of a small group of spectators, said NASA spokesman Rocky
Raab.
He said the Columbia will be removed from the back of the 747
this afternoon and taken into the orbiter processing building for ex
haustive tests.
"We're going to go over it inch by inch, stem to stern," Raab said.
The shuttle rocketed into space on April 12 and made a perfect
landing on a dry lake bed in California two days later.
Once back at Kennedy Space Center, the spacecraft will be out
fitted tor the second of perhaps 100 missions. NASA says the next
Columbia mission may be within six months.
