# Rehnquist calls for tougher death penalty
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Declaring that
the nation can no longer protect
the lives of children in Atlanta
or Supreme Court employees on
Capitol Hill, Justice William
Rehnquist urged the court Mon
day to change its procedures so
states may impose the death
penalty more quickly.
Rehnquist said that the re
peated appeals allowed in capi
tal punishment cases had
created a stalemate in which
persons are sentenced to die but
not executed. The result, he
said, is that at the moment, "the
existence ot the death penalty in
this country is virtually an il
lusion."
"When society promises to
punish by death certain crimi
nal conduct and then the courts
tail to do so, the courts not only
lessen the deterrent effect ot the
threat of capital punishment,
they undermine the integrity of
the entire criminal justice sys
tem," Rehnquist said.
The justice made his remarks
in a blistering written opinion in
a Georgia death-penalty case.
They touched off a new round of
debate within the Supreme
Court on the sensitive question
of capital punishment, with two
other justices defending the
court's handling ot death penal
ty cases.
After all. death cases are in
deed different in kind from all
other litigation," wrote Justice
John Paul Stevens. "The penal
ty, once imposed, is ir
revocable." Justice Thurgood
Marshall voiced similar views,
saying that it a mistake is found
in a death-penalty case after a
person is executed, "the wrong
that has been done can never be
corrected."
Rehnquist's opinion also pro

vided a rare glimpse at the
court's concerns for the secur
ity of its own personnel. Last
Feb. 1, a 26-year-old librarian
who had been working at the Su
preme Court for only three
months was murdered during a
nighttime robbery on a Capitol
Hill street near the court. No
suspect has been arrested.
In formal terms, Rehnquist's
opinion had no effect on the rest
of the court. Rehnquist wrote it
in the case of a death-row in
mate, Wayne Carl Coleman,
who was convicted in 1973 of
murdering six members of a

tamily in Donalsonville. Ga.
The court refused 6-3 Monday
to hear Coleman's challenge to
his state-court conviction, but
Rehnquist said in his dissent
that Coleman still retained the
right to raise the same legal
contentions in a new challenge
in the federal courts.
He urged the justices to hear
the man's appeal and resolve all
outstanding issues in the case
now — so that, he said, if the
murder conviction is upheld, the
death sentence "would presum
ably be carried out."
Coleman is one of 794 persons

who have been sentenced to
death in the United States. Since
1967, only one man has been ex
ecuted against his will: John
Spenkelink in Florida in 1979.
Three other men have been put
to death after voluntarily
withdrawing their legal ap
peals.
Stevens, in his rejoinder to
Rehnquist, said that if the Su
preme Court were to hear all the
death penalty cases brought
before it, the justices would
spend more than half their time
on those cases alone.
