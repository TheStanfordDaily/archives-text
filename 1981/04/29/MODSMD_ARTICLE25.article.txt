# Justices oppose late abortions

Washington (AP) — States may outlaw abor
tions performed outside hospitals on women more
than three months pregnant, the Supreme Court
ruled Monday.
The decision was a significant victory for the
"pro-life" or anti-abortion forces in the heated le
gal and political battle sparked by the Supreme
Court's 1973 ruling that legalized most abortions.
Without waiting to conduct oral arguments or to
write an opinion, the court voted 6-3 to uphold an
Indiana law that makes it a felony for a doctor to
perform an abortion, other than a first-trimester
one, away from a hospital.
A doctor who runs a Gary, Ind. abortion clinic
and three women identilied in court records only
by fictitious names sought to block enforcement
of the law.
In separate action Monday, the court left intact
Patricia Hearst Shaw's 1976 bank robbery convic
tion, turning away arguments that famed trial
lawyer F. Lee Bailey gave her "insufficient" le
gal help.
The justices refused to consider ruling that de
tense lawyers always fail to provide adequate le
gal help when they contract for the exclusive
rights to write a book about a trial before it be
gins.
Mrs. Shaw, now represented by San Francisco
lawyer George Martinez, asked the justices to

rule that F. Lee Bailey's involvement in an ex
clusive publishing contract about her case auto
matically deprived her of a fair trial.
Monday's denial, however, does not end Shaw's
attempt to overturn her bank robbery conviction.
Her new lawyer now will have a chance to con
vince a federal judge that Bailey's conduct "ad
versely affected"' her chance of acquittal.
The daughter of newspaper publisher William
Randolph Hearst and his wife, Catherine, Shaw ,
was convicted of participating in the 1974 armed •
robbery of a San F>ancisco bank.
In other matters, the court:
— Agreed to decide whether a list of street ad-v
dresses Compiled by government census-takers
falls under the Freedom of Information Act.
— Left intact a ruling in an Ohio case that states
can be ordered to enforce a clean air program im
posed by the federal Environmental Protection
Agency.
— Agreed to study the constitutionality of two
laws aimed at helping workers put out of work
when the Rock Island railroad ceased operations
in 1979; and
— Agreed to decide in a Texas case whether
states may require mothers to file paternity suits ...
aimed at collecting child-support payments from
asserted fathers before the children reach their 'J.
first birthday.
