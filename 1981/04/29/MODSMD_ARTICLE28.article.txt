# Will superconductors end energy crisis?
## 
### Marc Gimbrere 
The Energy Crisis. This
phrase has been bandied about
so frequently in recent years
that one can easily lose per
spective on the future of Ameri
ca s energy program. To many,
this future is uncertain. But to
others, like Applied Physics
Prof. Theodore Geballe, the
energy crisis is merely a barrier
which will soon be broken.
Geballe and his graduate stu
dents comprise one-half of a
Stanford research team which
is intent upon developing and re
fining methods tor electricity
transport. Their efforts center
on one method which has been
soundly proven over the last 20
years, but which must be im
proved. . . and without which
many hopes for America's
energy future would be dashed.
This method is super
conductivity.
A superconductor is a conduc
tor which, in theory, transports
electricity with no resistance.
Resistance has traditionally
been the nemisis of many elec
trical engineers, for with re
sistance comes heat, which
means loss of energy, which
means waste.

In simple terjns, a super
conductor works like this:
a wire is at room tem
perature, its structure is vibrat
ing This is known as lattice vi
bration. The electrons, free to
move, are the particles which
transfer electric current
through the wire.

The resistance is zero in some cases. Just
think: unlimited travel with no energy loss.

But when they are moving
through a vibrating lattice, they
constantly bump into all the at
oms which keep getting in the
way. The net effect is one step
backward for every two for
ward. This is resistance.
With a superconductor, how
ever, the main difference fea
ture is temperature: the wires
are cooled (with liquid helium)
to temperatures close to
absolute zero (four degrees
Kelvin). The effect of this is to
almost completely stop the lat
tice vibrations. The electrons,
paired up through interaction
with the lattice, become in
phase as opposed to being scat
tered. They move through the
wire at much higher speeds and

much lower resistance. The re
sistance is zero in some cases.
Just think: unlimited travel
with no energy loss.
Cynics first said it would take
more energy to cool the super
conductor than it would to waste
the energy through resistance
loss. But this is not the case â€”

once a system has been brought
to extremely low temperatures,
it takes very little energy to
keep it there.
The applications of this tech
nology are far-reaching. Gener
ator losses can be cut by a factor
of two. Particle accelerators for
atomic research can be made
much more efficient. Electric
power transmissions over long
distances with minimal losses
are foreseen. High-efficiency
electric engines can be de
veloped. Additionally, because
of the high speeds at which cur
rents can travel through the
wires, the possibilities for much
higher speed digital computers
are enormous.
The most important applica

tion for superconductive mate
rials is in the development of
thermonuclear fusion Fusion,
the joining of particles (as op
posed to fission, the separation
of particles, with residue radi
ation), is the future's energy.
Superconductors are essen
tial to the development of this
process because the super
conducting wires can be wound
to form high-efficiency mag
nets. These magnets are neces
sary to hold the 00 million
degree centigrade fusion fuel in
one place long enough for it to
transform into energy.
Without the research which
Geballe and many others con
duct internationally, this proc
ess would be hopeless.
Geballe feels that it is now up
to industry; the research has
been done. It is now a question of
developing the correct ex
trusion processes which will
make large, reliable super
conducting systems reliable.
"The most important techno
logical challenge to be met in
the next five years are con
nected with the final steps in
bringing laboratory-scale oper
ation into commercial prod
ucts," says Geballe.
