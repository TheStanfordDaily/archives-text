# Science today: new goals, new role
## 
### Ted Jardetsky 
The following is the second of two articles
addressing the changing role of science in
society. Last week, part one considered the
withering of funds and enthusiasm for basic
science research, which has been dwindling
since a I96r> peak in science-related fields.
Where, then, if not in research, is the em
phasis of this sector shifting to?
Over the last decade, the role ol science
and scientists in society has taken on new
dimensions. There remains a high premium
on technical efficacy and extensive scholar
ship. But there has been a substantial upstep
in interactions between scientific academia
and business and government!
Administrators, caught by the workings
of the burgeoning high-technology society,
increasingly must turn to the scientist for
determining policies and methods.
In response to these demands, a new facet
ot science is emerging, a system striving for
increased communication and collabora
tion between the traditionally divergent
areas ot research science and policy admin
istration.
What does this mean, in real changes?
Science consultants, advisors, planners —
and more committees.
The National Science Foundation (NSF),
for example, has fostered a program called
the National Innovation Network. This
network consists of groups of government
officials, scientists and technicians trying
to solve the day-to-day problems of- state

and local governments. It is still develop
ing, with plans to form a group for the Mid-
Atlantic states.
Meanwhile, t"he New England Innovation
Group has initiated the use of infrared tech
nology to determine the heating efficencies
of hospitals, schools and government build
ings. This has helped reduce fuel costs.
The project is also expanding to provide
quality control inspections of residential in
sulation jobs. And another group has
pioneered the use of a military radar device
as an underground utility locator.
Funding for research is not obsolete, of
course. Monsanto, for instance, is con
tributing $23 million to Harvard University
for studies in the biochemistry of malignant
tumors.
But concordant with this, the chemical in
dustries are promoting advisory roles by es
tablishing a Chemical Research Council ot
both academic and industrial represent
atives. This body can direct research funds
from industry to university, and generates
closer work between business and science
research through direct funding. (Current
ly, only 3 percent of university research is
industry funded, compared to 76 percent
from the government.)
Projects like these increase the techno
logical options available to local com
munities, and bring scientific and technical
personnel in direct contact with policy
makers and managers. As this communica

tion becomes increasingly important for
business and society tunctionings, a new
class of scientists and engineers acquire a
stronger voice in policy formulation.
The new government administration is
feeling this new tug as well: though Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's scientific task force
initially planned on cutting the Carter ad
ministration's science advisory board,
further consideration prompted the task
force to come out in favor of restoring the
science advisory board and appointing a
chief science advisor.
The council, say task force members,
would advise the president based on testa
ments from renowned science voices and
sometimes public forum, thereby further
integrating scientific perspective into the
nation's administrative machinery.
And many wish to see the council even
larger than projected. Says William Baker,
a task force member and one-time board
chairman at Bell Laboratories, "I don't
think they (the administration) have yet
had a chance to understand the importance
of it (science advisory program), and the
way in which such an office can support
their mission."
Others feel scientists should partake in
funding cut decisions. James D'lammi,
former president of the American Chemical
Association, said. "There's no doubt we
have to make cuts, but I am very unhappy if
all this is being done without advice from
the scientific community."

tributing $23 million to Harvard University
for studies in the biochemistry of malignant
tumors.
But concordant with this, the chemical in
dustries are promoting advisory roles by es
tablishing a Chemical Research Council ot
both academic and industrial represent
atives. This body can direct research funds
from industry to university, and generates
closer work between business and science
research through direct funding. (Current
ly, only 3 percent of university research is
industry funded, compared to 76 percent
from the government.)
Projects like these increase the techno
logical options available to local com
munities, and bring scientific and technical
personnel in direct contact with policy
makers and managers. As this communica

tion becomes increasingly important for
business and society tunctionings, a new
class of scientists and engineers acquire a
stronger voice in policy formulation.
The new government administration is
feeling this new tug as well: though Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's scientific task force
initially planned on cutting the Carter ad
ministration's science advisory board,
further consideration prompted the task
force to come out in favor of restoring the
science advisory board and appointing a
chief science advisor.
The council, say task force members,
would advise the president based on testa
ments from renowned science voices and
sometimes public forum, thereby further
integrating scientific perspective into the
nation's administrative machinery.
And many wish to see the council even
larger than projected. Says William Baker,
a task force member and one-time board
chairman at Bell Laboratories, "I don't
think they (the administration) have yet
had a chance to understand the importance
of it (science advisory program), and the
way in which such an office can support
their mission."
Others feel scientists should partake in
funding cut decisions. James D'lammi,
former president of the American Chemical
Association, said. "There's no doubt we
have to make cuts, but I am very unhappy if
all this is being done without advice from
the scientific community."
