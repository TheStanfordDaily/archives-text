# University undergoes review
## 
### Debbie Walker 
A team ot reviewers from the
Western Association of Schools
and Colleges (WASC) will pre
pare their recommendations for
renewal of the University's ac
creditation today through Fri
day.
The University is evaluated
for accreditation every ten
years.
"This will not be a detailed
review of every department or
program on campus," Assistant
to the Registrar Laurie Mathers
said. "The University hires spe
cialized accreditation agencies
to look in depth at special pro
grams and departments. The
kind of review going on now is
looking more at a global picture,
focusing on a few large areas."
Dean McHenry, chancellor
emeritus of the University of
California at Santa Cruz, will
head the team ot 10 reviewers.
To aid the team in their eval
uation, the University has pre
pared a detailed self-study re
port. The report is divided into
sections dealing with topics of
general concern to the Univer
sity and includes evaluations of
the University's performance
according to nine standards out
lined by WASC.
The areas of performance set
forth by WASC for evaluation in
clude : "Purpose"; "Gov

ernance and Administration";
and"The Educational Pro
gram."
Those who prepared the re
port included additional areas
for evaluation. "Residential
Education"; "Undergraduate
Education"; "Overseas Stud
ies"; and "Co-terminal Pro
grams."
According to Mathers, resi
dential education is an area of
potential interest to the ac
creditation team.
' 'Some think students need in
tellectual stimulation and that
residences should be an ex
tension of the classroom,"
Mathers said. "Others feel resi
dences should be a place to get
away from it all. Stanford is
wavering in between right
now."
Mathers said that there is no
real possibility that the Univer
sity's accreditation will not be
renewed, but that this does not
mean the review process is
meaningless.
University President Donald
Kennedy said in a memo an
nouncing the review that the
University "is committed to
voluntary private accreditation
of colleges and universities. "
"There seems greater benefit
to institutions and to society in
voluntary accreditation than in
bureaucratic governmental al

ternatives," he said.
Mathers said that if private
institutions can maintain a sat
isfactory accreditation system,
that government will not be
tempted to intervene.
"If there were no accredita
tion process, you would see all
sorts ot colleges popping up and
offering credit, "she said. "In
this sense, the process protects
higher education."
According to Mathers, a stu
dent coming here from a non-ac
credited institution would not
receive credit for previous
work, except at the discretion ot
the registrar.
She said that the University
pays all costs involved in the ac
creditation process, including
preparation of thfe self-eval
uation and all accomodation ex
penses for the review team.
The University has partici
pated in the accreditation proc
ess since 1949 when WASC was
formed, and has undergone
evaluation for accreditation ev
ery 10 years since that time.
"It is an attempt to pull things
together and summarize the
present situation at the Univer
sity," Mathers said.
Members of the campus com
munity are invited to meet with
the team on Thursday at 3.15 in
conference room 20, building
170.
