New York (AP) — George Rogers, the Heisman Trophy winner
from South Carolina, was the No.l selection by the New Orleans
Saints Tuesday and led a group of six running backs chosen in the
first round of the National Football League draft
Bum Phillips, former coach of Houston whose selection v three
years ago of "franchise" back Earl Campbell turned the Oilers into
an NFL power, went the same route in his first draft as the Saints'
toach.
He tabbed Rogers, the 6-foot-2, 220-pounder who plowed through
as well as around tacklers en route to 1781 yards last year and 5091
for his career with the Gamecocks.
Other first-round running backs selected were Freeman McNeil
of UCLA, by the New York Jets; Randy McMillan of the University
of Pittsburgh (Baltimore), David Overstreet of* Oklahoma (Mi
ami), James Brooks of Auburn (San Diego) and Booker Moore of
Penn State (Buffalo).
Linebackers, too, were highly prized, four of them going in the
opening round. One of the biggest names among them — Lawrence
Taylor from North Carolina — was also regarded by many as the
t'best athlete available," a phrase used by teams that prefer not to
draft just to fill a specific need. Pittsburgh and Dallas have con
sistently done just that and between them have appeared in nine Su
per Bowls.
Taylor, the 6-3, 240-pounder, was taken N0.2 by the New York
Giants, who were in the enviable position of sitting just behind the
Saints in the selection order. If New Orleans had taken Taylor, the
Giants would have jumped on Rogers. "Whichever they take, we'll
take the otier One," Giants General Manager George Young had
said.
The remaining first-round linebackers selected were E J Junior
of Alabama (St. Louis), Hugh Green of Pitt (Tampa Bay) and Mel
Owens of Michigan (Los Angeles). All four linebackers were among
the top nine picks.
Matching the running backs in volume were defensive backs, six
of them also going in the first round. UCLA's Kenny Easley (Seat
tle) was first, followed by Ronnie Lott of Southern California (San
Francisco). Dennis Smith of Southern Cal (Denver), Ted Watts of
Texas Tech (Oakland), Hanford Dixon of Southern Mississippi
(Cleveland) and Bobby Butler of Florida State (Atlanta).
The' Chicago Bears, with one of the premiere running backs in the
league in Walter Payton, picked one of the premiere tackles avail
able' to open some holes for him. Southern Cat's Keith Van Home
was the first of five offensive tackles to go in the opening round, the
others being Brian Holloway of Stanford (New England). Outland
Trophy winner Mark May of Pitt (Washington). Curt Marsh of
Washington (Oakland) and Howard Richards of Missouri (Dallas).
Two trades livened up the proceedings. The Baltimore Colts
traded running back Joe Washington to the Washington Redskins
fer three draft choices. And Tony Reed, a 1000-vard rusher for Kan
sas City three years ago and an excellent blocker hobbled by knee
surgery two seasons back, was dealt to Denver in exchange tor two
draft choices, one this year, one next
