As expected, Stanford
football stars Brian
Holloway and Ken
Margerum were selected
during the early rounds in
yesterday's NFL draft. What
proved to be unexpected,
however, were the teams
that picked them.
Holloway. the Cardinals'
All-Conference offensive
tackle, was chosen by the
New England Patriots in the
first round. The 6-7, 270-lb.
behemoth, widely regarded
as the nation's best pass pro
tector. was the 19th player
selected.
Margerum, a two-time

consensus All-America
flanker, went in the third
round to the Chitago Bears
NFL teams picked four wide
receivers ahead of the 6-1.
175-lb. Margerum. whose
lack of size prompted skep
ticism among professional
scouts.
Contacted by telephone at
his home in Potomac, Md.,
where he returned to be with
his family and his agent,
Holloway at once expressed
enthusiasm and astonish
ment at joining the Patriats.
"I'm exhilarated,"
Holloway said. "Turk
Schonert. Chuck Evans and
James Lofton (former Card

football standouts) said I
was picked by the team they
least expected. It came to
me as a real surprise."
Holloway added that the
Kansas City Chiefs "called
me a lot bet ore they made
their pick," who turned out
to be Willie Scott, a tight end
from South Carolina.
The Patriots opted for
Holloway despite boasting
one of the league's finest of
fensive lines. Left guard
John Hannah ranks as one of
the very best, and left tackle
Dwight Wheeler, center Pete
Brock, right guard Bob
Cryder and right tackle
Shelby Jordan are young but
proven veterans,
"It (New England) just
might provide the ideal con
ditions for me to learn and be
taught by the veterans,"
Holloway said eagerly.
The Patriots traded 10-
year veteran offensive line
man Sam Adams to New Or
leans last Thursday for an
eighth-round draft choice,
making Holloway's status
appear quite secure.
Margerum also ought to be
secure this season at Soldier
Field, although he figured he
would be playing his home
games elsewhere. The Super
Bowl champion Oakland
Raiders was one of the teams
that expressed considerable
interest in the Fountain Val
ley native.
"It was a surprise,"
Margerum said of becoming
a Bear. "I never expected
Chicago — I never heard
from them."
Margerum jokingly
speculated that the at
mospheric conditions in the
Chicago area might have led
to his selection.
"Lake Michigan has lots of
wind, so they probably took

me because I'm a wind
surfer," he quipped
James Scott, the Bears'
best receiver, recently
signed with the Montreal
Alouettes of the Canadian
Football League, leaving be
hind him a modestly talented
pass-catching corps of
Rickey Watts, Brian
Baschnagel and Emrrjanuel
Tolbert, among otherfc.
Quarterbacks Vince
Evans, the starter, and Mike
Phipps, the backup, won't re
mind anybody of the Craig
Morton-Roger Staubach duo
Dallas had in the early 70s.
But Margerum remained
optimistic He said the Chi

cago receivers coach told
him that his ability and
Scott's departure give him
an excellent chance of be
coming an immediate
starter.
Nor was Margerum frus
trated at being chosen behind
receivers David Verser
(Kansas), Mark Nichols
(San Jose State), Cris Col
linsworth (Florida) and
Mardye McDole (Mississippi
State).
"I went in expecting (to be
picked in) the third round,"
Margerum said. "I couldn't
say I'm disappointed. If it
had gone on longer than it
had I might have been."

Ex-Cardinal gridder Ken Margerum is shown above looking
over spring work-outs, but the look on his face was probably
quite similar yesterday when he found out that he had been
drafted, NFL type, by the Chicago Bears in the third round.
Margerum had expressed a strong desire to stay on the West
Coast.

Former Stanford teammate Brian Holloway, on the other
hand, couldn't have been happier upon hearing the news that
he was the second offensive lineman chosen. Holloway was
picked by the New England Patriots in the first round and was
the nineteenth man taken overall in the NFL draft, which will
continue today.
