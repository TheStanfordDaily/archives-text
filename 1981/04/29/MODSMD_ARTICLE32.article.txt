The Stanford women's golf team placed
third in a field ot the toughest 18 teams in
the country last weekend, in the Women's
Southern Intercollegiate, played at the Uni
versity ot Georgia.
The Cardinals finished with 949 overall,
ahead of No. 1 ranked University of Miami,
and No. 3 ranked Fresno State in the par-74
three-day tournament.
Georgia won the tournament, virtually
ran away with it that is, with an overall 913.
Tulsa finished second with 934, while Miami
took fourth place with 95 L
Georgia will host the AIAW Cham
pionships next month on the same course.
Stanford, as reflected by last week's per
formance, should be among the favorites to
win that title. The course, traditionally a

tough one, has been compared to Spyglass
Hill in Carmel, one ol the three courses
played in the Bing Crosby Pro-Am each
year.
Their finish should be particularly pleas
ing to the Cardinals, maybe even surprising,
because they were without head coach Tim
Baldwin. Baldwin is still recuperating from
a severe heart-attack; his brother Pat
Baldwin has taken over coaching duties in
the meantime.
A definite surprise tor the Cardinals was
Kathy Nino. The freshman from Santa
Clara finished fifth individually and first for
Stanford, ahead of senior teammate Lin
da Bowman, usually the top finisher for the
Cards.
Nino shot a tournament score ot 232 to tie
with Georgia's Terry Moody, while

Bowman placed eighth with 233.1t was
Nino's best individual finish ever. Mitzi
Edge of Georgia shot a one-under-par 221 to
win the tournament.
Lori Castillo shot a total ot 240, Joanne
Pacillo finished with 248, and Debbie
Barbario filled out the Cardinals field with
251.
The Cardinals were in a tie for fifth place
through the second day of the tournament,
but put together an outstanding final-round
effort to move up two places. They finished
the round with a team score of 311, the sec
ond lowest score for the day behind only
Georgia.
Stanford will compete next in the Nor-
Cal's this weekend, to be held at the Olym
pic club in San Francisco. They will travel
to Pebble Beach May 4 for the Pebble Beach
Peaches.

The Stanford women's golf team placed
third in a field ot the toughest 18 teams in
the country last weekend, in the Women's
Southern Intercollegiate, played at the Uni
versity ot Georgia.
The Cardinals finished with 949 overall,
ahead of No. 1 ranked University of Miami,
and No. 3 ranked Fresno State in the par-74
three-day tournament.
Georgia won the tournament, virtually
ran away with it that is, with an overall 913.
Tulsa finished second with 934, while Miami
took fourth place with 95 L
Georgia will host the AIAW Cham
pionships next month on the same course.
Stanford, as reflected by last week's per
formance, should be among the favorites to
win that title. The course, traditionally a

tough one, has been compared to Spyglass
Hill in Carmel, one ol the three courses
played in the Bing Crosby Pro-Am each
year.
Their finish should be particularly pleas
ing to the Cardinals, maybe even surprising,
because they were without head coach Tim
Baldwin. Baldwin is still recuperating from
a severe heart-attack; his brother Pat
Baldwin has taken over coaching duties in
the meantime.
A definite surprise tor the Cardinals was
Kathy Nino. The freshman from Santa
Clara finished fifth individually and first for
Stanford, ahead of senior teammate Lin
da Bowman, usually the top finisher for the
Cards.
Nino shot a tournament score ot 232 to tie
with Georgia's Terry Moody, while

Bowman placed eighth with 233.1t was
Nino's best individual finish ever. Mitzi
Edge of Georgia shot a one-under-par 221 to
win the tournament.
Lori Castillo shot a total ot 240, Joanne
Pacillo finished with 248, and Debbie
Barbario filled out the Cardinals field with
251.
The Cardinals were in a tie for fifth place
through the second day of the tournament,
but put together an outstanding final-round
effort to move up two places. They finished
the round with a team score of 311, the sec
ond lowest score for the day behind only
Georgia.
Stanford will compete next in the Nor-
Cal's this weekend, to be held at the Olym
pic club in San Francisco. They will travel
to Pebble Beach May 4 for the Pebble Beach
Peaches.
With spring quarter finally getting into full
swing, so too are the Intramural Sports activities
rising to their full peak.
There are more than 170 teams competing in
softball, the most popular of spring athletics.
Three other sports, volleyball, water polo, and ul
timate frisbee, have more than 60 teams compet
ing.
Important upcoming events for aspiring ath
letes include the Intramural Bike Race, which
will be held this Sunday at 10:30 a.m.. All partic
pants must register by 10 a.m. at the registration
desk located on Escondido road adjacent to
Wilbur Hall. The course is 10 miles long, and all
riders must wear headgear.
next big I.M. event will be the Swimming
and Diving Meet, to be held May 12 at 2 p.m. at de-
Guerre pool. As in the bike race, contestants
should sign up thirty minutes before their particu
lar event. Competition promises to be keen, as the

defending champions, the Delta Upsilons, set a
national record on their way to capturing the title.
The final major event for spring quarter will be
the Track and Field Meet, to be held May 15 and
16. at Stanford Stadium. The meet kicks off with
the field events at 2:30 p.m. Friday, followed by
the preliminaries in the running events.
The finals for the running events will be held
Saturday beginning at 4 p.m.. Once again, all com
petitors should sign up a half hour before their

A large turn-out is antincipated for the meet, as

tending champion Bootables from their throne.
Speedsters Lowell Bennett and Eddie Harris re

against what promises to be stiff competition.
