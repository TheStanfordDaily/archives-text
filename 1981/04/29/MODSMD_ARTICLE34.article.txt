# Play SJS, Pepperdine, Cal
## Netmen to face busy week 
### Ivan Maisel 
The NCAA champion in men's tennis is often
not only the most talented, but the team with the
most endurance. Four matches in as many days in
the stifling humidity of Athens, Georgia can turn
even the best players into walking pools of sweat.
Having been to Athens more than any other col
legiate coach save Vince Dooley, Stanford's Dick
Gould knows full well it's time to start preparing
the troops for marching through Georgia. Hence
this week's itinerary, which includes hosting
"two of the top five teams in the country," ac
cording to Gould.
After today's "breather" against San Jose
State (1:30 p.m.. Tennis Stadium), the Cards host
Pepperdine tomorrow (noon) and Cal Friday
(1:30 p.m.). The latter two teams are ranked sec
ond and fifth respectively in the latest In
tercollegiate Tennis Coaches Association (ITCA)
poll, which is usually about two weeks behind
what is actually happening in college tennis.
Stanford is ranked % third behind UCLA and Pep
perdine, but the votes were tallied before the
Cards beat UCLA 6-3 two-and-one-half weeks ago.
Whatever their ranking, the Cards could easily
lose it this weekend.
The Waves are led by the one-two punch of
Glenn Michibata and Rocky Vasquez. Take the
word "punch" quite literally where Vasquez is
concerned, for he is one of the premier kick-box
ers in the country. He hits big in tennis too. utili
zing a rocket serve to defuse most opponents.
Unlike his teammate, Michibata is a scrambler
who will run to the next county to chase a ball
down. He can hit more returns than a brick wall.
Both of coach Allen Fox's players are ranked in

the ITCA's latest top ten, as is the Waves' Rich
Gallien
' They have pretty much the same team back
trom last year," said Gould, whose : 980 champs
beat Pepperdine 6-3 in the NCAA semifinals.
They will be good practice for the nationals."
Pepperdine has lost but two matches this year,
8-1 at UCLA and a 5-4 loss at home to the Cal
Bears Gould feels that was a significant win for
Stanford's cross-Bay rival.
"Cal has played awful good in the last two
weeks. They've really come on strong," Gould
said Stanford beat the Bears 6-3 in Berkeley April
3. but Phil Wright's young team has begun to
blossom lately.
With tremendous challenges ahead of them, it
might be easy tor Stanford to overlook the
Spartans, who they manhandled 8-1 last month in
San Jose.
"They're not bad," Gould said of the Spartans.
"We should beat them. 1 don't think we'll look past
them. We're pretty good about that."
Gould added that he will probably keep a couple
ot starters out of tomorrow's match as a safe
guard. One will probably be Scott Bondurant. who
has been having back problems.
NOTES — The ITCA poll ranked Scott Davis
No. 1 in their new poll. Not bad — for the No. 2
placer on campus. Tim Mayotte still rules Stan
ford's roost . . .UCLA beat USC 7-2 yesterday in
Westwood, raising their Conference
record to 7-1 (19-2 overall), one-half game behind
Stanford. The Bruins took five of six singles
matches, including Marcel Freeman's 6-4,6-0 win
at No. 1 over recently promoted Roger Knapp of
USC. The Trojans are now 24-8, 3-5 in the Pac-10.


Stanford's Jim Gurfein will be hitting a lot more backhands just like
this one this week when the Cards entertain three guests at Stanford
Tennis Stadium, beginning with San Jose State today at 1:30. Pep
perdine is scheduled for Thursday at noon, and Cal travels to the
Farm for a match on Friday.

Stanford baseball coach Mark Marquess was showing signs
of displeasure at this umpire's call in a game earlier this sea
son, but he couldn't have been too much more frustrated then
when his team lost at St. Mary's yesterday, 3-2. The Cards led
2-0 for most of the game, before losing on a bases-loaded
double that drove in the three Gael runs in the bottom of the
eighth inning. Stanford also had a chance at victory in the
ninth, when I)ave Meier led off with a base hit and was ad
vanced to third via two passed balls, only to be left stranded.

(1:30 p.m.). The latter two teams are ranked sec
ond and fifth respectively in the latest In
tercollegiate Tennis Coaches Association (ITCA)
poll, which is usually about two weeks behind
what is actually happening in college tennis.
Stanford is ranked % third behind UCLA and Pep
perdine, but the votes were tallied before the
Cards beat UCLA 6-3 two-and-one-half weeks ago.
Whatever their ranking, the Cards could easily
lose it this weekend.
The Waves are led by the one-two punch of
Glenn Michibata and Rocky Vasquez. Take the
word "punch" quite literally where Vasquez is
concerned, for he is one of the premier kick-box
ers in the country. He hits big in tennis too. utili
zing a rocket serve to defuse most opponents.
Unlike his teammate, Michibata is a scrambler
who will run to the next county to chase a ball
down. He can hit more returns than a brick wall.
Both of coach Allen Fox's players are ranked in

the ITCA's latest top ten, as is the Waves' Rich
Gallien
' They have pretty much the same team back
trom last year," said Gould, whose : 980 champs
beat Pepperdine 6-3 in the NCAA semifinals.
They will be good practice for the nationals."
Pepperdine has lost but two matches this year,
8-1 at UCLA and a 5-4 loss at home to the Cal
Bears Gould feels that was a significant win for
Stanford's cross-Bay rival.
"Cal has played awful good in the last two
weeks. They've really come on strong," Gould
said Stanford beat the Bears 6-3 in Berkeley April
3. but Phil Wright's young team has begun to
blossom lately.
With tremendous challenges ahead of them, it
might be easy tor Stanford to overlook the
Spartans, who they manhandled 8-1 last month in
San Jose.
"They're not bad," Gould said of the Spartans.
"We should beat them. 1 don't think we'll look past
them. We're pretty good about that."
Gould added that he will probably keep a couple
ot starters out of tomorrow's match as a safe
guard. One will probably be Scott Bondurant. who
has been having back problems.
NOTES — The ITCA poll ranked Scott Davis
No. 1 in their new poll. Not bad — for the No. 2
placer on campus. Tim Mayotte still rules Stan
ford's roost . . .UCLA beat USC 7-2 yesterday in
Westwood, raising their Conference
record to 7-1 (19-2 overall), one-half game behind
Stanford. The Bruins took five of six singles
matches, including Marcel Freeman's 6-4,6-0 win
at No. 1 over recently promoted Roger Knapp of
USC. The Trojans are now 24-8, 3-5 in the Pac-10.


Stanford's Jim Gurfein will be hitting a lot more backhands just like
this one this week when the Cards entertain three guests at Stanford
Tennis Stadium, beginning with San Jose State today at 1:30. Pep
perdine is scheduled for Thursday at noon, and Cal travels to the
Farm for a match on Friday.

Stanford baseball coach Mark Marquess was showing signs
of displeasure at this umpire's call in a game earlier this sea
son, but he couldn't have been too much more frustrated then
when his team lost at St. Mary's yesterday, 3-2. The Cards led
2-0 for most of the game, before losing on a bases-loaded
double that drove in the three Gael runs in the bottom of the
eighth inning. Stanford also had a chance at victory in the
ninth, when I)ave Meier led off with a base hit and was ad
vanced to third via two passed balls, only to be left stranded.
The NCAA champion in men's tennis is often
not only the most talented, but the team with the
most endurance. Four matches in as many days in
the stifling humidity of Athens, Georgia can turn
even the best players into walking pools of sweat.
Having been to Athens more than any other col
legiate coach save Vince Dooley, Stanford's Dick
Gould knows full well it's time to start preparing
the troops for marching through Georgia. Hence
this week's itinerary, which includes hosting
"two of the top five teams in the country," ac
cording to Gould.
After today's "breather" against San Jose
State (1:30 p.m.. Tennis Stadium), the Cards host
Pepperdine tomorrow (noon) and Cal Friday
(1:30 p.m.). The latter two teams are ranked sec
ond and fifth respectively in the latest In
tercollegiate Tennis Coaches Association (ITCA)
poll, which is usually about two weeks behind
