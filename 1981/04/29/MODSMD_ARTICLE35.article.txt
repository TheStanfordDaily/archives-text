Ultimate Frisbee
Stanford will host an Invitational Ul
timate Frisbee Festival Saturday and
Sunday May 9 and 10, at Stanford Stadi
um. The tournament will consist of two
sections: Ultimate, and Frisbee golf.
Over 250 world class players from the
western United States will be competing
for the Ultimate title; the golf competi
tion is open to the public.
Saturday's action will consist of pre
liminaries and semi-finals, while Sunday
will be reserved for the final competi
tions and awards ceremonies.
Ultimate frisbee is a fast paced game
of two 7-player teams, with action simi
lar to football, soccer, and basketball.
The object is to pass the disc to a teamate
in the end zone. In frisbee golf, the
players follow an 18 hole "course" and
toss the frisbee at targets, with each
throw counting as a stroke.
The Stanford Frisbee club, currently
in it's third year, has quickly developed
one of the top five Ultimate teams in the
western United States. They compete in
the tall and spring in the Northern Cali
fornia Ultimate Frisbee League, as well

as in numerous tournaments.
The Stanford club has competed in five
major tournaments since 1978, and
reached the semi-finals in three, the
most recent of which were the Western
Regional Championships, and California
State Championships, In addition, the
club captured the 1981 NCUFL title.
Ice Hockey
The Stanford Ice Hockey club team
closed out their league play last weekend
by triumphing in a four-team round-rob
in tournament, held in Monterey. The
final game, against the Monterey Kings,
provided a spectacular show of the
Tunicates offensive prowess.
Due to a tie-breaking rule between
teams with equal won-loss records, Stan
ford had to not only beat thÂ£ Kings, they
had to score eight goals in the process in
order to win the overall title. They did
exactly that, defeating the Kings 8-5.
Stanford played the last five minutes
without goalie Paul Estey in favor of an
extra attacker to score that eighth and
deciding goal. The final score, pounded
in by Brian Murphy, came with a mere
five seconds left in the game.

The Tunicates were paced by an
awesome hat-trick performance by Dave
Grabb, who scored one of his three goals
on his knees, after walking through the
entire Kings team. Stanford's venerable
high scorer Dave Wright also popped in
three, goals, and assisted on two others.
Virtually the entire game was played on
the Kings half of the ice as the Stanford
skaters literally forechecked their oppo
nents to death.
In earlier games, Stanford beat the
Fresno Suns 4-1 in a hard fought and very
physical game, and lost a heartbreaker
to the San Jose Desperados, 3-2.
Stanford's loss to San Jose was proba
bly the best game of the tournament,
with hard skating and clean playing. Les
Landsberger led off tor Stanford, blast
ing a 60 loot slapshot midway through the
first period.
Down by a score of 3-1 with two
minutes to go Stanford pulled goalie
Estey for a sixth skater. The Tunicates
manged to eke out one more score as
Wright drove home a neat pass from
Landberger. but they couldn't repeat the
effort. It was Stanford's only lpss in
league play this season.
