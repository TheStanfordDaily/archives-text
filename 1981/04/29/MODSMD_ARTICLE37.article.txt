Pope sends envoy to Ireland
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Pope John Paul li s person
al secretary, Monsignor John McGee. flew to Northern
Ireland yesterday to visit the Maze prison in a dramatic,
llth-hour effort to persuade Irish Republican Army ter
rorist Bobby Sands to end the hunger strike that has
brought him near death.
McGee said his trip was a "spiritual mission, not a polit
ical one."
He was said to be carrying a personal letter from the
pope to Sands, the 27-year-old convicted terrorist who was
elected to the British Parliament from Ulster earlier this
month.
McGee, who himself comes from Newry in County
Down in Ulster, will be making a last ditch effort to save
Sands' life Sands has conducted the hunger strike to press
inmate demands tor concessions His death could end in
bloody violence in Northern Ireland.
In Belfast, the Protestant religious leader, the Rev lan
Paisley warned that the government must take "the nec
essary precautions" to meet the "savage war that is no
doubt going to be unleashed" after Sands' death.
Sands yesterday completed the 59th day of his hunger
strike and was said to be drifting in and out of conscious
ness as he was again given the last rites of the Catholic
church.
The British government says the concessions he is de
manding would amount to granting the IRA prisoners con
victed of terrorist offenses a special political status.
Israel downs Syrian helicopters
Beirut, Lebanon — Israeli warplanes shot down a Syrian
helicopter gunship yesterday about five miles from the
Syrian border in central Lebanon, killing four Syrian sol
diers, newsmen on the scene reported. Israeli sources
called it a warning to Syria not to broaden its onslaught
against Lebanese Christians.
Later, government sources in Beirut said Israeli jets
downed a second Syrian helicopter and rocketed Syrian
positions near the Christian city of Zahle.
The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv, in a
statement issued before the later attacks were reported,
said a helicopter was downed because it was "attacking
and murdering Christians," but did not provide details.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin s government, mean
while, reiterated that Israel "cannot acquiesce in the at
tempt of the Syrians to conquer Lebanon and liquidate the
Christians in that country." the official press office an
nounced.
It was a renewed warning from Jerusalem that Syria
should cease its attacks on Lebanese Christians in Beirut
and in the besieged city of Zahle in eastern Lebanon.
The military command s>»id Israeli gunners fired into
Lebanon yesterday after Palestinian guerrillas shelled Is
rael's northern Galilee panhandle with Soviet-made
Katyusha rockets.
Congress criticizes foreign policy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's foreign poli
cy got caught in a cross tire of bipartisan congressional
criticism yesterday as House Democrats and Republicans
lined up to tell Secretary of State Alexander Haig of their
confusion and dismay over such administration moves as
lifting the grain embargo against the Soviet Union and de
ciding to sell sophisticated radar planes to Saudi Arabia.

The occasion was Haig's appearance before a House Ap
propriations subcommittee to testify about the adminis
tration s foreign aid program The members, representing
a broad cross-section of congressional opinion, made clear
their view that administration policy seems so erratic as
to be unintelligible to America's allies and adversaries.
In addition to salvaging the lifting of the grain embargo
as a sign of indecisiveness and the AWACS deal as a danger
tb Israel, the subcommittee members complained about
such other front-burner issues as U.S. activities in El
Salvador, allegations of a U.S. tilt toward South Africa in
dealing with Namibia and alleged lack of clarity in spell
ing out the administration's approach to human rights.
Haig defended lilting the embargo as fulfillment of a
Reagan campaign promise and said the Soviets were un
der no illusions about U.S. intentions to oppose any new ag
gressive behavior by Moscow.
He insisted that the AWACS deal would not harm Is
rael's security and said it was important both to maintain
U.S.-Saudi friendship and to guard against Soviet en
croachment in the Persian Gulf.
In reply to questions about whether the administration
has lost interest in El Salvador. Haig asserted that the is
sue has moved off the front pages largely because of the
administration's success in helping the government there
resist the challenge of leftist guerrillas.
Court limits environment suits
Washington —The Supreme Court, blunting an impor
tant legal weapon of environmentalists, ruled yesterday
that private citizens and organizations such as the Sierra
Club cannot sue under a federal law they have used to pro
tect rivers and wetlands from pollution.
The decision to enforce the law is now exclusively up to
the federal government, which is expected to reduce its
enforcement efforts dramatically under the Reagan ad
ministration.
The court reversed a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruling sought by environmentalists in their decade-long
battle to block construction of the Peripheral Canal — a
controversial 42-mile-long channel in California that is
among the largest water-diversion projects in the country
— planned to help bring tresh water from the moist regions
of the northern part of the state to the arid south.
Watt denies state control
Washington — Interior Secretary James Watt said yes
terday the proposed sale of oil drilling rights in environ
mentally sensitive tracts off the northern California coast
cannot be vetoed by state officials.
Watt, testifying before a House Government Operations
subcommittee, said the state role is purely advisory. He
said state objections can be overruled by a simple finding
that the national interest overrides state objections.
"The controversy over offshore leasing is the classic
problem of public interest versus local interest," Watt
told the subcommittee on environment. "... Local and
state concerns do not always reflect the overriding na
tional need or perspective."
California Gov. Jerry Brown has led state officials in
protesting Watt's decision to reconsider the possibility ot
drilling in four environmentally sensitive areas off Cali
fornia's northern coast.
Watt said he has made no decision on the tour northern
tracts — known as the Santa Cruz, Point Arena. Bodega
and Eel Point basins — and will not until late May or early

June.
Arts cut draws fire
Washington — A proposal by the Reagan administration
to dismantle the National Endowment for the Humanities
in favor of a single independent, semi-public corporation
reflects "an attempt to impose a board-of-directors' men
tality" on matters ot the arts and humanities. Arts Endow
ment Chairman Livingston Biddle said yesterday.
Along with Joseph Duffey, head of the National Endow
ment for the Humanities, Biddle testified yesterday
before the Senate Appropriations Committee's subcom
mittee on the interior. The Senate panel was continuing its
inquiry into the administration's proposed 50 percent cuts
for the arts and humanities for the 1982 federal budget.
Biddle called the White House plan to create a federally
chartered non-profit arts agency similar to the Corpo
ration for Public Broadcasting "an effort to maintain a
strong commitment to the arts."
But he rejected the notion that the two endowments
should be replaced outright.

"I would say that we have a very welt tested and well
proven vehicle" that has operated successfully for 15
years. Biddle said.
From a figure of $22 million when the endowment was
founded in 1966, corporate giving to the arts has grown to a
current annual amount in excess of $450 million, Biddle
said
