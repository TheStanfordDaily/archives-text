## 
### Chris Butchko 
Speaking before a crowd at San
Francisco's Norse Auditorium, Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
yesterday castigated Japan for not
pulling its weight in its defense treaty
with the United States.
Weinberger said that Japan's ef
forts to augment its defense and share
in the financial burden were "much
appreciated," but that "the increas
ing threat to Japan and to freedom ev
erywhere clearly requires significant
ly greater efforts."
Weinberger pointed out America's
commitment to its allies in the face of
Soviet aggression and cited the Treaty
of Mutual Cooperation and Security
with Japan as evidence, calling it the
"linchpin of U.S.-Japanese rela
tions."
He cited as examples of Japan's de
pendence on the United States the
American troops stationed there, the

aircraft carrier docked there, and the
fact that Japan is protected by Ameri
ca's "nuclear umbrella."
Weinberger was careful to state
that the United States will continue to
provide nuclear protection since
Japan's constitution prohibits the con
struction of nuclear weapons, but em
phasized that Japan is not doing all it
can for itself He said that the U.S. is
not looking to lessen its support tor
Japan, but hoped that the Japanese
would add their forces to America's to
strengthen the common defense.
"Japan would find it exceedingly
difficult to defend itself with current
forces," he said "We are concerned
that Japan's capability for self-dr
fense at this point remains short of
what is clearly required. "
According to Weinberger. Japan al
locates Qne-sixth of its wealth for
defense in proportion to U.S. defense
spending.
Weinberger also addressed two ma
jor points of the Reagan adminis
tration's foreign policy. He said that
the United States must view defense
policy in a "global context' and that
this country must be strong enough to
protect its interests in any corner of
the world He added as £ second point
that America is now "an island na
tion" since the resources this country
needs are no longer coming solely
from within the nation's borders.
Soviet build-up matter of concern
Concerning the possibility of a
threat in the Pacific Ocean. Wein
berger said that the rapid buildup of
Soviet military 'strength is "far
beyond legitimate defense .needs
"The deployment of that Soviet
growth (is) a matter of continuing
concern," he said.
•'The Soviet Pacific Fleet now in
cludes about a third of all its sub
marines, and about a fourth of its prin
cipal combatant ships. Nearly a third
of all their naval aviation is in the Pa
cific, and Soviet ground troops have
moved back into the northern territo

ries taken from Japan at the end ot
World War II," Weinberger said
Weinberger contrasted that action
with that of the United States in giving
Okinawa back to the Japanese, and
criticized the USSR for its plans to use
Vietnam as a proxy in Asia, having
"purchased .*ir support."
Weinberger called the government
of North Korea "one of the most re
pressive in the world," and said that
the Republic of Korea is an 'ally ot
enormous strategic importance." He
expressed gratitude to Australia and
New Zealand for their friendship, and
said of China that "We share a com
mon concern."
Weinberger defended the sale ot
radar planes to Saudi Arabia and said
that they do not pose a threat to Israel.
He said that the planes would serve
asprotection against an attempted So
viet invasion He said that plans were
in the making to ensure that the planes
could not be used against Israel, and
that they are "as vulnerable as any
specially equipped B-iO aircraft,'
raising an unanswered question as to
their effectiveness.
Weinberger said that resumption of
grain exports was justified since the
embargo did "not really hurt the Rus
sians." He added that it was a case of
"a politician keeping his promise,"
since Reagan had campaigned against
the embargo
Speaking on the Polish crisis, Wein
berger mentioned what may become a
Reagan administration catchphrase.
He said that certainly, now. in Poland
there is peace, but it is not "peace
with freedom," and he pledged that it
be an "indivisible goal."
After his speech, Weinberger re
sponded to questions from the au
dience. Two members of the audience
insisted on asking a question that
hadn t "been carefully screened." and
interruptions continued until the
meeting was ended shortly before the
scheduled time.

Weinberger was careful to state
that the United States will continue to
provide nuclear protection since
Japan's constitution prohibits the con
struction of nuclear weapons, but em
phasized that Japan is not doing all it
can for itself He said that the U.S. is
not looking to lessen its support tor
Japan, but hoped that the Japanese
would add their forces to America's to
strengthen the common defense.
"Japan would find it exceedingly
difficult to defend itself with current
forces," he said "We are concerned
that Japan's capability for self-dr
fense at this point remains short of
what is clearly required. "
According to Weinberger. Japan al
locates Qne-sixth of its wealth for
defense in proportion to U.S. defense
spending.
Weinberger also addressed two ma
jor points of the Reagan adminis
tration's foreign policy. He said that
the United States must view defense
policy in a "global context' and that
this country must be strong enough to
protect its interests in any corner of
the world He added as £ second point
that America is now "an island na
tion" since the resources this country
needs are no longer coming solely
from within the nation's borders.
Soviet build-up matter of concern
Concerning the possibility of a
threat in the Pacific Ocean. Wein
berger said that the rapid buildup of
Soviet military 'strength is "far
beyond legitimate defense .needs
"The deployment of that Soviet
growth (is) a matter of continuing
concern," he said.
•'The Soviet Pacific Fleet now in
cludes about a third of all its sub
marines, and about a fourth of its prin
cipal combatant ships. Nearly a third
of all their naval aviation is in the Pa
cific, and Soviet ground troops have
moved back into the northern territo

ries taken from Japan at the end ot
World War II," Weinberger said
Weinberger contrasted that action
with that of the United States in giving
Okinawa back to the Japanese, and
criticized the USSR for its plans to use
Vietnam as a proxy in Asia, having
"purchased .*ir support."
Weinberger called the government
of North Korea "one of the most re
pressive in the world," and said that
the Republic of Korea is an 'ally ot
enormous strategic importance." He
expressed gratitude to Australia and
New Zealand for their friendship, and
said of China that "We share a com
mon concern."
Weinberger defended the sale ot
radar planes to Saudi Arabia and said
that they do not pose a threat to Israel.
He said that the planes would serve
asprotection against an attempted So
viet invasion He said that plans were
in the making to ensure that the planes
could not be used against Israel, and
that they are "as vulnerable as any
specially equipped B-iO aircraft,'
raising an unanswered question as to
their effectiveness.
Weinberger said that resumption of
grain exports was justified since the
embargo did "not really hurt the Rus
sians." He added that it was a case of
"a politician keeping his promise,"
since Reagan had campaigned against
the embargo
Speaking on the Polish crisis, Wein
berger mentioned what may become a
Reagan administration catchphrase.
He said that certainly, now. in Poland
there is peace, but it is not "peace
with freedom," and he pledged that it
be an "indivisible goal."
After his speech, Weinberger re
sponded to questions from the au
dience. Two members of the audience
insisted on asking a question that
hadn t "been carefully screened." and
interruptions continued until the
meeting was ended shortly before the
scheduled time.
Speaking before a crowd at San
Francisco's Norse Auditorium, Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
yesterday castigated Japan for not
pulling its weight in its defense treaty
with the United States.
Weinberger said that Japan's ef
forts to augment its defense and share
in the financial burden were "much
appreciated," but that "the increas
ing threat to Japan and to freedom ev
erywhere clearly requires significant
ly greater efforts."
Weinberger pointed out America's
commitment to its allies in the face of
Soviet aggression and cited the Treaty
of Mutual Cooperation and Security
with Japan as evidence, calling it the
"linchpin of U.S.-Japanese rela
tions."
He cited as examples of Japan's de
pendence on the United States the
American troops stationed there, the

aircraft carrier docked there, and the
fact that Japan is protected by Ameri
ca's "nuclear umbrella."
Weinberger was careful to state
that the United States will continue to
