# Expert predicts more arms control talks
## 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
The control of arms has hit another
trough in its cyclical history but may
not stay there tor too long, a key figure
in the SALT I negotiations ot 1972 said
here yesterday.
Dr. Phil Farley, senior research fel
low in the Arms Control Program here
and former deputy director of the U.S.
Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency, said, "Arms control has a
logic in it that will resume."
"Our allies in Europe and Japan
will not understand a policy that
doesn't keep open arms control possi
bilities," he said. Such a policy would
make collective defense more dif
ficult for the United States to pursue
and "we are going to find ourselves
back to peacemaking and arms con
trol."
Parley declined to say how long
arms control will be on the back
burner but did not hesitate to disagree

with sentiments in the Reagan admin
istration against arms control.
"I do not agree with the (Secretary
of State Alexander) Haig analysis that
the root of insecurity in the world is
the Soviet Union," he said. The real
cause for insecurities in the world
comes from strains on resources and
the clash of national aspirations.
Arms control is just one of many
strands that bind the world for better
relations — it can help cure the symp
toms, not the causes, of world stress,
he said.

Farley said pressure for arms re
ductions will also come from develop
ing countries. He pointed to figures
which showed that in 1978 the United
States, the Soviet Union and OPEC na
tions spent $23 billion on international
aid while arms expenditures tor that
year topped $480 billion
"When the Vietnam War ended, the
savings did not go to international
aid," Farley said. Third World leaders
are upset by what they see as a great
waste ot resources, he concluded.
Farley said the Reagan adminis
tration may be breaking with the gen
eral opinion that has prevailed in the
White House since the Eisenhower ad
ministration of the '50s. Since World

War 11. he said, although the govern
ment has been skeptical of interna
tional arms agreements, it has sought
stability.
"No military establishment the
U.S. can create is capable of defend
ing the people in the event of a nuclear
war." he said, adding, "To focus ex
clusively on nuclear weapons will not
give you as much security as a bcoader
international view."
Past efforts praised
Farley praised past arms control ef
forts and accords.

"Have we negotiated agreements
that are dangerous to American in
terests?," he asked Farley said he
couldn't see how treaties banning the
use of biological weapons or above
ground nuclear tests might work
against the interests ot the United
States. Also, it is clear SALT II failed
in the Senate "not because ot flaws but
because of Soviet behavior." he said
Farley called arms control "a
modest, gradual approach" to solving
the problems caused by an arms race.
Right now arms control appears to be
on the defensive because no nego
tiations are underway. In December,
a treaty was drawn up banning certain
inhumane weapons — incendiary de

vices, booby traps and mines — but
has not been ratified by the United
States, he said.
Farley warned that "'an open-ended
arms race obviously has a lot of draw
backs." Ultimately, you wind up with
the same insecurities at a higher
plateau of danger, he said.
Three views
At least three different views of
arms control are prevalent in the
United States, Farley said
He called the first group pacifists
who see arms reductions as a personal

goal or may believe there is an ex
ternal "war system" that has to be
stopped.
A second group he defined as the
"arms control constituents" — people
inside or outside the government who
think complete disarmament is un
realistic but would like to control the
growth of nuclear and conventional
weapons as best they can
The last group — "more prominent
now" — see military force as the best
means for security and are suspicious
of most arms control efforts. Farley
said.

Parley declined to say how long
arms control will be on the back
burner but did not hesitate to disagree

with sentiments in the Reagan admin
istration against arms control.
"I do not agree with the (Secretary
of State Alexander) Haig analysis that
the root of insecurity in the world is
the Soviet Union," he said. The real
cause for insecurities in the world
comes from strains on resources and
the clash of national aspirations.
Arms control is just one of many
strands that bind the world for better
relations — it can help cure the symp
toms, not the causes, of world stress,
he said.

Farley said pressure for arms re
ductions will also come from develop
ing countries. He pointed to figures
which showed that in 1978 the United
States, the Soviet Union and OPEC na
tions spent $23 billion on international
aid while arms expenditures tor that
year topped $480 billion
"When the Vietnam War ended, the
savings did not go to international
aid," Farley said. Third World leaders
are upset by what they see as a great
waste ot resources, he concluded.
Farley said the Reagan adminis
tration may be breaking with the gen
eral opinion that has prevailed in the
White House since the Eisenhower ad
ministration of the '50s. Since World

War 11. he said, although the govern
ment has been skeptical of interna
tional arms agreements, it has sought
stability.
"No military establishment the
U.S. can create is capable of defend
ing the people in the event of a nuclear
war." he said, adding, "To focus ex
clusively on nuclear weapons will not
give you as much security as a bcoader
international view."
Past efforts praised
Farley praised past arms control ef
forts and accords.

"Have we negotiated agreements
that are dangerous to American in
terests?," he asked Farley said he
couldn't see how treaties banning the
use of biological weapons or above
ground nuclear tests might work
against the interests ot the United
States. Also, it is clear SALT II failed
in the Senate "not because ot flaws but
because of Soviet behavior." he said
Farley called arms control "a
modest, gradual approach" to solving
the problems caused by an arms race.
Right now arms control appears to be
on the defensive because no nego
tiations are underway. In December,
a treaty was drawn up banning certain
inhumane weapons — incendiary de

vices, booby traps and mines — but
has not been ratified by the United
States, he said.
Farley warned that "'an open-ended
arms race obviously has a lot of draw
backs." Ultimately, you wind up with
the same insecurities at a higher
plateau of danger, he said.
Three views
At least three different views of
arms control are prevalent in the
United States, Farley said
He called the first group pacifists
who see arms reductions as a personal

goal or may believe there is an ex
ternal "war system" that has to be
stopped.
A second group he defined as the
"arms control constituents" — people
inside or outside the government who
think complete disarmament is un
realistic but would like to control the
growth of nuclear and conventional
weapons as best they can
The last group — "more prominent
now" — see military force as the best
means for security and are suspicious
of most arms control efforts. Farley
said.

The control of arms has hit another
trough in its cyclical history but may
not stay there tor too long, a key figure
in the SALT I negotiations ot 1972 said
here yesterday.
Dr. Phil Farley, senior research fel
low in the Arms Control Program here
and former deputy director of the U.S.
Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency, said, "Arms control has a
logic in it that will resume."
"Our allies in Europe and Japan
will not understand a policy that
doesn't keep open arms control possi
bilities," he said. Such a policy would
make collective defense more dif
ficult for the United States to pursue
and "we are going to find ourselves
back to peacemaking and arms con
trol."
