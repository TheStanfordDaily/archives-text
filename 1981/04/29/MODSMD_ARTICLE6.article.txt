## Stanford experts address the energy issue Energy and the year 2000 
### Chris Rogers 
When the Arab oil-producing
nations turned off the tap on the
flow ol oil by placing an em
bargo on exports to the West in
1973. they did more than cause
inconvenient gas lines and raise
prices above the level needed to
sustain cruising; they brought
to the fore a new problem with a
distinctive catch phrase: the
Energy ('risis
The fact that fossil fuels are
finite was well known, but the
realization that our supply of oil
could be effectively cut otf
fueled interests in developing
alternative energy resources
toward independence from im
ported oil
The University, in the past
decade, has been particularly
active in energy resource
development, and boasts ex
tensive assets in energy ex
perts. Expertise, however, does
not mean these leaders agree on
energy answers for the future
Physicist Edward Teller of
the Hoover Institution, for ex
ample. warns that closure of the
Straight of Hormuz. through
which 60 percent of the tree
world's oil passes, would leave
the West and the U.S. "prac-

tically helpless" and goes on to
say, "It is a sad fact that we
have obviously been on notice
tor more than six years. Today
we could have 200 nuclear power
plants rather than 70. and in that
case the impact of less oil would
be bearable."
In response to the awareness
of energy needs and sources
brought on by the : 973 embargo.
Teller places faith in nuclear
power to provide the energy
supply of the future.
Speaking from his office at
the Lawrence Livermore Labo
ratories. Teller confirmed that
the energy crisis was "impor
tant in many respects,"
branching into strategic and ec
onomic implications. He con
firmed that he believes nuclear
energy to be extremely impor
tant. although not necessarily
the strongest possibility, as an
alternative. Teller went on to
say that "nuclear power is rela
tively cheap and. in spite of
false rumors, is clean and very
safe."
On the subject ot the disposal
of nuclear waste. Teller said
that "nuclear waste has been
handled without problem in mil
itary usage" and was first done
under primitive conditions
"with no difficulty, no com
plaint. He went on to say
that nuclear power is "clean
and very safe and waste dis
posal is even safer." He feels
that the "public is bamboozled"
by the press. Nuclear waste is
reprocessed, the reusable mate
rials are extracted, and what is
lett is buried underground and is
harmless, according to Teller.
Other experts do not see the
future as being mostly powered
by nuclear fission. John
Weyant, head of the Stanford
Energy Research Forum, said
there is a role for nuclear
energy, but voiced reservations.
"On the surface, when I con
sider the alternatives, I don't
object strenuously. But I am
concerned that nuclear power
will grow exponentially and this
will result in occasions such as
Three Mile Island, by leaping

torward in unplanned bounds."
Weyant believes that around
the 19905, breeder reactors will
be in operation, but will only be
supplying a small part of the to
tal energy source. He believes
that around the turn of the cen
tury tossil tuels will still provide
the greatest source of energy,
with the oil and natural gas con

sumption slackening as the use
ot coal increases.
"There will be no major use
of synthetic fuels or solar
energy at that time," he said
But these, along with sources
such as geothermal or
hydroelectricitv. will be part of
the future source as a number of
"small contributions from a
larger pool of energy alter
natives."
He stresses the need tor con
servation of energy, both to help
stocks last and cushion the time
between now and choosing new
energy sources "Conservation
can delay the choice between
nuclear power and coal, should
that time come. This would
mean that we would not have to
commit ourselves to a possibly
irrevocable path.'' he said.
Weyant does not believe that
energy concerns will alter our
lifestyles much more, though he
notes they have already
changed some: after 1975 there
was no doubt that the much
higher oil prices scared con
sumers and manufacturers and
produced a positive reaction.
"Gas consumption has dropped
by il percent." he claims. "Oil
imports have been reduced as

well." In 979. the U.S. imported
8 million barrels of oil per day.
In '980. it was down to 6 million.
And this year is down to 5 mil
lion per day.he added. The dis
ruptions of oil supplies provide
incentive to switch the source of
energy, according to Weyant.
"The response is heightened
awareness of the alternatives."
Weyant's studies indicate one
or more disruptions ot the oil
supply in the next 10 years. He
also agrees with Teller, who be
moans the lack ot adequate
preparation of stockpiles.
"President Carter set a goal of
stockpiling 100.000 barrels a
day. but due to inconsistent poli
cies, targets were not met."
There are now about 750 million
barrels stockpiled which would
be consumed in 18 years at pres
ent levels of consumption, ac
cording to Weyant.
Stanford's Prof, ftobert
Eustis of the Mechanical Engi
neering Dept. sees the sun as the
energy source ot the tuture, but
warns that solar energy is the
power source of "the far
future."
At present, Eustis believes
that solar energy is only eco
nomically viable when utilized
for space heating ot domestic
houses. "The generation of elec
tricity by solar power can be
done technically, but as an eco
nomic reality is a number ot
years away," he says.
Eustis sees fossil fuels as con
tinuing to provide the major
source of energy for the near
future. But because they are
being used at an increasing rate,
there is a need to look at all
forms of energy sources, ac
cording to Eustis. He believes
that conservation will help but
that it will not alleviate the de
mand for energy, especially
from"the growing Third World
countries."
Eustis feels that our lifestyles
are going to be further affected
by the changes in the energy
supply, chiefly because the cost
to consumers is rising. As peo
ple use less energy due to costs,
their lifestyles will have to
adapt, according to Eustis.
When mapping energy re
sources, Eustis feels that en
vironmental considerations are
of prime concern, as "damage
to the environment is ir
reversible and potentially
lethal." He sees nuclear power
as preferable to fossil energy,
saying that it has less impact on
the environment.
Another expert in the energy
field, Stanford Mechanical En
gineering Prof. Bill Reynolds
also foresees a variety of
sources supplying energy in the

future, primarily fossil, nuclear
and solar. He believes that new
sources of fossil fuels will be ex
ploited over the next hundred
years, and coal will be utilized
to a much greater extent.
Reynolds also sees a greater
role for synthetic fuels, pointing
out that they are fossil fuel de
rivatives. He also thinks that
nuclear fission may become
commercially feasible in the
next century.
Gil Masters, civil engineering
professor and champion of Stan
ford's sprinkling of alternative
energy courses (such as Small
Energy Systems) has a dif
ferent perspective on the energy
issue.
Masters believes that im
provements in energy efficien
cy would have no costs in terms
of changes in lifestyle. He says
he thinks of such things as im
proving the efficiency of auto
mobiles and the internal com
bustion engine, and insulating
buildings to prevent heat loss. In
other words '' improve the use of
the energy that we get and re
duce consumption." says Mas
ters.
These improvements would
not take great breakthroughs in
technology, according to Mas
ters. For example, "if everyone
drove VW Rabbits, at 30 mph as
opposed to standard cars at an
average 15 mph. that would be a
50 percent saving in gas con
sumption," said Masters.
Masters stresses that energy
efficiency is really an energy
supply option. "When lined up
with other supply options as a
supply resource in itself, con
servation is the most cost effec
tive." he explained. "Soft tech
nologists have a different point
of view from supply-conscious
hard technologists." he added.
With energy efficiency and
renewable resources as the pos
sible solution to the "energy
crisis," Masters sees no future
for nuclear power. "It is too ex
pensive for the utilities to buy
new nuclear plants," he said.
"What do we need so much elec
tricity for. airyway, if it is main
ly used to produce heat? There
are other, cheaper and more ef
ficient ways of providing heat. "
He does agree that research
should be funded on a modest
scale for nuclear power, in
asmuch that there must be re
search into all alternative
energy sources, according to
Masters.
These are just some opinions
voiced by Stanford represent
atives prominent in the field of
energy research and develop
ment. Their solutions differ,
and viewpoints clash, but all
agree there is an energy crisis
and solutions must be accepted.

Weyant believes that around
the 19905, breeder reactors will
be in operation, but will only be
supplying a small part of the to
tal energy source. He believes
that around the turn of the cen
tury tossil tuels will still provide
the greatest source of energy,
with the oil and natural gas con

sumption slackening as the use
ot coal increases.
"There will be no major use
of synthetic fuels or solar
energy at that time," he said
But these, along with sources
such as geothermal or
hydroelectricitv. will be part of
the future source as a number of
"small contributions from a
larger pool of energy alter
natives."
He stresses the need tor con
servation of energy, both to help
stocks last and cushion the time
between now and choosing new
energy sources "Conservation
can delay the choice between
nuclear power and coal, should
that time come. This would
mean that we would not have to
commit ourselves to a possibly
irrevocable path.'' he said.
Weyant does not believe that
energy concerns will alter our
lifestyles much more, though he
notes they have already
changed some: after 1975 there
was no doubt that the much
higher oil prices scared con
sumers and manufacturers and
produced a positive reaction.
"Gas consumption has dropped
by il percent." he claims. "Oil
imports have been reduced as

well." In 979. the U.S. imported
8 million barrels of oil per day.
In '980. it was down to 6 million.
And this year is down to 5 mil
lion per day.he added. The dis
ruptions of oil supplies provide
incentive to switch the source of
energy, according to Weyant.
"The response is heightened
awareness of the alternatives."
Weyant's studies indicate one
or more disruptions ot the oil
supply in the next 10 years. He
also agrees with Teller, who be
moans the lack ot adequate
preparation of stockpiles.
"President Carter set a goal of
stockpiling 100.000 barrels a
day. but due to inconsistent poli
cies, targets were not met."
There are now about 750 million
barrels stockpiled which would
be consumed in 18 years at pres
ent levels of consumption, ac
cording to Weyant.
Stanford's Prof, ftobert
Eustis of the Mechanical Engi
neering Dept. sees the sun as the
energy source ot the tuture, but
warns that solar energy is the
power source of "the far
future."
At present, Eustis believes
that solar energy is only eco
nomically viable when utilized
for space heating ot domestic
houses. "The generation of elec
tricity by solar power can be
done technically, but as an eco
nomic reality is a number ot
years away," he says.
Eustis sees fossil fuels as con
tinuing to provide the major
source of energy for the near
future. But because they are
being used at an increasing rate,
there is a need to look at all
forms of energy sources, ac
cording to Eustis. He believes
that conservation will help but
that it will not alleviate the de
mand for energy, especially
from"the growing Third World
countries."
Eustis feels that our lifestyles
are going to be further affected
by the changes in the energy
supply, chiefly because the cost
to consumers is rising. As peo
ple use less energy due to costs,
their lifestyles will have to
adapt, according to Eustis.
When mapping energy re
sources, Eustis feels that en
vironmental considerations are
of prime concern, as "damage
to the environment is ir
reversible and potentially
lethal." He sees nuclear power
as preferable to fossil energy,
saying that it has less impact on
the environment.
Another expert in the energy
field, Stanford Mechanical En
gineering Prof. Bill Reynolds
also foresees a variety of
sources supplying energy in the

future, primarily fossil, nuclear
and solar. He believes that new
sources of fossil fuels will be ex
ploited over the next hundred
years, and coal will be utilized
to a much greater extent.
Reynolds also sees a greater
role for synthetic fuels, pointing
out that they are fossil fuel de
rivatives. He also thinks that
nuclear fission may become
commercially feasible in the
next century.
Gil Masters, civil engineering
professor and champion of Stan
ford's sprinkling of alternative
energy courses (such as Small
Energy Systems) has a dif
ferent perspective on the energy
issue.
Masters believes that im
provements in energy efficien
cy would have no costs in terms
of changes in lifestyle. He says
he thinks of such things as im
proving the efficiency of auto
mobiles and the internal com
bustion engine, and insulating
buildings to prevent heat loss. In
other words '' improve the use of
the energy that we get and re
duce consumption." says Mas
ters.
These improvements would
not take great breakthroughs in
technology, according to Mas
ters. For example, "if everyone
drove VW Rabbits, at 30 mph as
opposed to standard cars at an
average 15 mph. that would be a
50 percent saving in gas con
sumption," said Masters.
Masters stresses that energy
efficiency is really an energy
supply option. "When lined up
with other supply options as a
supply resource in itself, con
servation is the most cost effec
tive." he explained. "Soft tech
nologists have a different point
of view from supply-conscious
hard technologists." he added.
With energy efficiency and
renewable resources as the pos
sible solution to the "energy
crisis," Masters sees no future
for nuclear power. "It is too ex
pensive for the utilities to buy
new nuclear plants," he said.
"What do we need so much elec
tricity for. airyway, if it is main
ly used to produce heat? There
are other, cheaper and more ef
ficient ways of providing heat. "
He does agree that research
should be funded on a modest
scale for nuclear power, in
asmuch that there must be re
search into all alternative
energy sources, according to
Masters.
These are just some opinions
voiced by Stanford represent
atives prominent in the field of
energy research and develop
ment. Their solutions differ,
and viewpoints clash, but all
agree there is an energy crisis
and solutions must be accepted.

case the impact of less oil would

In response to the awareness
of energy needs and sources
brought on by the : 973 embargo.
Teller places faith in nuclear
power to provide the energy
supply of the future.
Speaking from his office at
the Lawrence Livermore Labo

the energy crisis was "impor
tant in many respects,"
branching into strategic and ec
onomic implications. He con
firmed that he believes nuclear
energy to be extremely impor
tant. although not necessarily
the strongest possibility, as an
alternative. Teller went on to
say that "nuclear power is rela
tively cheap and. in spite of
false rumors, is clean and very
safe."
On the subject ot the disposal
of nuclear waste. Teller said
that "nuclear waste has been
handled without problem in mil
itary usage" and was first done
under primitive conditions
"with no difficulty, no com
plaint. He went on to say
that nuclear power is "clean
and very safe and waste dis
posal is even safer." He feels
that the "public is bamboozled"
by the press. Nuclear waste is
reprocessed, the reusable mate
rials are extracted, and what is
lett is buried underground and is
harmless, according to Teller.

by nuclear fission. John

tricity by solar power can be
done technically, but as an eco
nomic reality is a number ot
years away," he says.
Eustis sees fossil fuels as con
tinuing to provide the major
source of energy for the near
future. But because they are
being used at an increasing rate,
there is a need to look at all
forms of energy sources, ac
cording to Eustis. He believes
that conservation will help but
that it will not alleviate the de
mand for energy, especially
from"the growing Third World
countries."
Eustis feels that our lifestyles
are going to be further affected
by the changes in the energy
supply, chiefly because the cost
to consumers is rising. As peo
ple use less energy due to costs,
their lifestyles will have to
adapt, according to Eustis.
When mapping energy re
sources, Eustis feels that en
vironmental considerations are
of prime concern, as "damage
to the environment is ir
reversible and potentially
lethal." He sees nuclear power
as preferable to fossil energy,
saying that it has less impact on
the environment.
Another expert in the energy
field, Stanford Mechanical En
gineering Prof. Bill Reynolds
also foresees a variety of
sources supplying energy in the

future, primarily fossil, nuclear
and solar. He believes that new
sources of fossil fuels will be ex
ploited over the next hundred
years, and coal will be utilized
to a much greater extent.
Reynolds also sees a greater
role for synthetic fuels, pointing
out that they are fossil fuel de
rivatives. He also thinks that
nuclear fission may become
commercially feasible in the
next century.
Gil Masters, civil engineering
professor and champion of Stan
ford's sprinkling of alternative
energy courses (such as Small
Energy Systems) has a dif
ferent perspective on the energy
issue.
Masters believes that im
provements in energy efficien
cy would have no costs in terms
of changes in lifestyle. He says
he thinks of such things as im
proving the efficiency of auto
mobiles and the internal com
bustion engine, and insulating
buildings to prevent heat loss. In
other words '' improve the use of
the energy that we get and re
duce consumption." says Mas
ters.
These improvements would
not take great breakthroughs in
technology, according to Mas
ters. For example, "if everyone
drove VW Rabbits, at 30 mph as
opposed to standard cars at an
average 15 mph. that would be a
50 percent saving in gas con
sumption," said Masters.
Masters stresses that energy
efficiency is really an energy
supply option. "When lined up
with other supply options as a
supply resource in itself, con
servation is the most cost effec
tive." he explained. "Soft tech
nologists have a different point
of view from supply-conscious
hard technologists." he added.
With energy efficiency and
renewable resources as the pos
sible solution to the "energy
crisis," Masters sees no future
for nuclear power. "It is too ex
pensive for the utilities to buy
new nuclear plants," he said.
"What do we need so much elec
tricity for. airyway, if it is main
ly used to produce heat? There
are other, cheaper and more ef
ficient ways of providing heat. "
He does agree that research
should be funded on a modest
scale for nuclear power, in
asmuch that there must be re
search into all alternative
energy sources, according to
Masters.
These are just some opinions
voiced by Stanford represent
atives prominent in the field of
energy research and develop
ment. Their solutions differ,
and viewpoints clash, but all
agree there is an energy crisis
and solutions must be accepted.

When the Arab oil-producing
nations turned off the tap on the
flow ol oil by placing an em
bargo on exports to the West in
1973. they did more than cause
inconvenient gas lines and raise
prices above the level needed to
sustain cruising; they brought
to the fore a new problem with a
distinctive catch phrase: the
Energy ('risis
The fact that fossil fuels are
finite was well known, but the
realization that our supply of oil
could be effectively cut otf
fueled interests in developing
alternative energy resources
toward independence from im
ported oil
The University, in the past
decade, has been particularly
active in energy resource
development, and boasts ex
tensive assets in energy ex
perts. Expertise, however, does
not mean these leaders agree on
energy answers for the future
Physicist Edward Teller of
the Hoover Institution, for ex
ample. warns that closure of the
Straight of Hormuz. through
which 60 percent of the tree
world's oil passes, would leave
the West and the U.S. "prac-

tically helpless" and goes on to
say, "It is a sad fact that we
have obviously been on notice
tor more than six years. Today
we could have 200 nuclear power
plants rather than 70. and in that
case the impact of less oil would
be bearable."
In response to the awareness
of energy needs and sources
brought on by the : 973 embargo.
Teller places faith in nuclear
power to provide the energy
supply of the future.
Speaking from his office at
the Lawrence Livermore Labo
ratories. Teller confirmed that
the energy crisis was "impor
tant in many respects,"
branching into strategic and ec
onomic implications. He con
firmed that he believes nuclear
energy to be extremely impor
tant. although not necessarily
the strongest possibility, as an
alternative. Teller went on to
say that "nuclear power is rela
tively cheap and. in spite of
false rumors, is clean and very
safe."
On the subject ot the disposal
of nuclear waste. Teller said
that "nuclear waste has been
handled without problem in mil
itary usage" and was first done
under primitive conditions
"with no difficulty, no com
plaint. He went on to say
that nuclear power is "clean
and very safe and waste dis
posal is even safer." He feels
that the "public is bamboozled"
by the press. Nuclear waste is
reprocessed, the reusable mate
rials are extracted, and what is
lett is buried underground and is
harmless, according to Teller.
Other experts do not see the
future as being mostly powered
by nuclear fission. John
Weyant, head of the Stanford
Energy Research Forum, said
there is a role for nuclear
energy, but voiced reservations.
"On the surface, when I con
sider the alternatives, I don't
object strenuously. But I am
concerned that nuclear power
will grow exponentially and this
will result in occasions such as
Three Mile Island, by leaping

torward in unplanned bounds."
Weyant believes that around
the 19905, breeder reactors will
be in operation, but will only be
supplying a small part of the to
tal energy source. He believes
that around the turn of the cen
tury tossil tuels will still provide
the greatest source of energy,
with the oil and natural gas con

sumption slackening as the use
ot coal increases.
"There will be no major use
of synthetic fuels or solar
energy at that time," he said
But these, along with sources
such as geothermal or
hydroelectricitv. will be part of
the future source as a number of
"small contributions from a
larger pool of energy alter
natives."
He stresses the need tor con
servation of energy, both to help
stocks last and cushion the time
between now and choosing new
energy sources "Conservation
can delay the choice between
nuclear power and coal, should
that time come. This would
mean that we would not have to
commit ourselves to a possibly
irrevocable path.'' he said.
Weyant does not believe that
energy concerns will alter our
lifestyles much more, though he
notes they have already
changed some: after 1975 there
was no doubt that the much
higher oil prices scared con
sumers and manufacturers and
produced a positive reaction.
"Gas consumption has dropped
by il percent." he claims. "Oil
imports have been reduced as

well." In 979. the U.S. imported
8 million barrels of oil per day.
In '980. it was down to 6 million.
And this year is down to 5 mil
lion per day.he added. The dis
ruptions of oil supplies provide
incentive to switch the source of
energy, according to Weyant.
"The response is heightened
awareness of the alternatives."
Weyant's studies indicate one
or more disruptions ot the oil
supply in the next 10 years. He
also agrees with Teller, who be
moans the lack ot adequate
preparation of stockpiles.
"President Carter set a goal of
stockpiling 100.000 barrels a
day. but due to inconsistent poli
cies, targets were not met."
There are now about 750 million
barrels stockpiled which would
be consumed in 18 years at pres
ent levels of consumption, ac
cording to Weyant.
Stanford's Prof, ftobert
Eustis of the Mechanical Engi
neering Dept. sees the sun as the
energy source ot the tuture, but
warns that solar energy is the
power source of "the far
future."
At present, Eustis believes
that solar energy is only eco
nomically viable when utilized
for space heating ot domestic
houses. "The generation of elec
tricity by solar power can be
done technically, but as an eco
nomic reality is a number ot
