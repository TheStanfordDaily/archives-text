# Solar more than just hot water
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff 
The sun's rays are heating more than clusters
of tanning bodies at Stanford this Spring. Solar
technology applications are supplying domestic
hot water, either actively pr passively, at three
student residences.
Roth House, located on Santa Ynez, depends on
30 percent of its hot water through an active hot
water solar system utilizing solar collectors.
Synergy's passive domestic hot water system
uses an insulated box with glazing surrounding 40
gallon tanks — no mechanical pumps or valves
are needed.
"This type of system is becoming very popular
because the initial cost is a lot less than an active
system and for residential application, in the
summer, it could supply as much as an active one:
'00 per cent," explained John Eaton, director of
the Housing Energy Conservation Center here.
The Energy Center helps students design
projects to become working installations.
Domestic hot water is only one application for so
lar energy, however. Columbae House employs a
simple passive space heating system consisting of
insulating window curtains that shed light into one
students room that contains five 17 gallon storage
tanks tilled with water. The drums absorb heat
during the day and radiate heat into the room at
night.
The Housing Energy Conservation Center is not
alone in its involvement with solar application.
Facilities and Services, the office attending to all
service and operational needs of the University,
has a distinct Energy Program Office responsible
for investigating energy provision every time the
University constructs a new facility.
An "exhaustive" tour month study was just
completed by the office that investigated the
feasibility of installing solar hot water systems in
the new student residences. "Solar hot water does
not give us back the conservation that traditional
gas and steam does. It is just not cost effective,"
said Lynda Weisberg, Energy Program Manager.
Weisberg commented that improved efficiency
within existing plumbing and heating systems
was more cost effective than the alternative of
retrofitting the facilities with solar systems. She
mentioned heating, air conditioning and ventila
tion systems as three specific targets for im
proved energy efficiency.
Although the study concluded that immediate
solar installation in the new student residence at
Lake Lagunita was not advisable, the construc
tion design will leave room in the plumbing ducts
for a solar system at that time when the system's
cost may not be as prohibitive.
A more popular and publicized application has
been solar pool heating. Stanford has applied for a
Department of Energy (DOE) matching grant to

partially heat deGuerre pool. "Solar hot water
heating for swimming pools is the most cost effec
tive application at this point," explained
Weisberg; "you use a little bit all day long."
Solar energy's scientific component has not
been overshadowed by the practical nature of its
installation on the campus. Research conducted
by professors in the Electrical Engineering and
Materials Research departments here is attempt
ing to decrease the cost and increase the efficien
cy of photovoltaic solar cells.
These type of photovoltaic cells, usually
created by silicon crystals, are used as semi
conductors to convert the sun's energy into viable
electricity outputs.
Prof. Robert Feigelson, director of the Crystal
Technology program through the Center for Mate
rials Research, and Senior Research Associate
Dennis Elwell have been experimenting with a
single-step electrolyte process to fabricate silicon
from molten salt solution. This process could
potentially decrease the cost of silicon kilograms
from $70 to $80 per kilogram to $1 to $3, a re
markable breakthrough in the search for ways to
make solar cells more cost effective.
Feigelson and Elwell have been working on the
process for two years and are scheduled to con
tinue their experimentation through September of
1981, "By that time we should have a pretty good
idea of how feasible the process is," commented
Feigelson in an interview published by The Stan
ford Energy Report.
Richard Swanson. assistant professor in Elec
trical Engineering, is researching improved effi
ciency of energy cells from silicon. "We're shoot
ing for getting the system efficiency for
photovoltaics over 25 percent," said Swanson,
who is working with two full-time technicians and
four students on the project which is funded
through the Electrical Power Research Institute
in Palo Alto.
The silicon cell installation is "a descendant
from the space projects now being developed for
terrestrial application," Swanson added.
An alternative to the silicon cell, thin films con
sisting of cadmium telluride or zinc phosphide, is
being explored by Prof. Richard Bube. chairman
of the Materials Science Engineering Depart
ment. Bube's research is focused primarily on
laying a foundation for future engineering design.
"It is purely experimental," he said. 10 to 20
square meters of solar photovoltaic cells could
potentially supply the energy needs of an average
household "if the sun is out," he estimated.
Whether on the roof or in the laboratory, the so
lar research and application at Stanford is one av
enue for reduced consumption and increased
education about energy alternatives.

process for two years and are scheduled to con
tinue their experimentation through September of
1981, "By that time we should have a pretty good
idea of how feasible the process is," commented
Feigelson in an interview published by The Stan
ford Energy Report.
Richard Swanson. assistant professor in Elec
trical Engineering, is researching improved effi
ciency of energy cells from silicon. "We're shoot
ing for getting the system efficiency for
photovoltaics over 25 percent," said Swanson,
who is working with two full-time technicians and
four students on the project which is funded
through the Electrical Power Research Institute
in Palo Alto.
The silicon cell installation is "a descendant
from the space projects now being developed for
terrestrial application," Swanson added.
An alternative to the silicon cell, thin films con
sisting of cadmium telluride or zinc phosphide, is
being explored by Prof. Richard Bube. chairman
of the Materials Science Engineering Depart
ment. Bube's research is focused primarily on
laying a foundation for future engineering design.
"It is purely experimental," he said. 10 to 20
square meters of solar photovoltaic cells could
potentially supply the energy needs of an average
household "if the sun is out," he estimated.
Whether on the roof or in the laboratory, the so
lar research and application at Stanford is one av
enue for reduced consumption and increased
education about energy alternatives.
The sun's rays are heating more than clusters
of tanning bodies at Stanford this Spring. Solar
technology applications are supplying domestic
hot water, either actively pr passively, at three
student residences.
Roth House, located on Santa Ynez, depends on
30 percent of its hot water through an active hot
water solar system utilizing solar collectors.
Synergy's passive domestic hot water system
uses an insulated box with glazing surrounding 40
gallon tanks — no mechanical pumps or valves
are needed.
"This type of system is becoming very popular
because the initial cost is a lot less than an active
system and for residential application, in the
summer, it could supply as much as an active one:
'00 per cent," explained John Eaton, director of
the Housing Energy Conservation Center here.
The Energy Center helps students design
projects to become working installations.
Domestic hot water is only one application for so
lar energy, however. Columbae House employs a
simple passive space heating system consisting of
insulating window curtains that shed light into one
students room that contains five 17 gallon storage
tanks tilled with water. The drums absorb heat
during the day and radiate heat into the room at
night.
The Housing Energy Conservation Center is not
alone in its involvement with solar application.
Facilities and Services, the office attending to all
service and operational needs of the University,
has a distinct Energy Program Office responsible
for investigating energy provision every time the
University constructs a new facility.
An "exhaustive" tour month study was just
completed by the office that investigated the
feasibility of installing solar hot water systems in
the new student residences. "Solar hot water does
not give us back the conservation that traditional
gas and steam does. It is just not cost effective,"
said Lynda Weisberg, Energy Program Manager.
Weisberg commented that improved efficiency
within existing plumbing and heating systems
was more cost effective than the alternative of
retrofitting the facilities with solar systems. She
mentioned heating, air conditioning and ventila
tion systems as three specific targets for im
proved energy efficiency.
Although the study concluded that immediate
solar installation in the new student residence at
Lake Lagunita was not advisable, the construc
tion design will leave room in the plumbing ducts
for a solar system at that time when the system's
cost may not be as prohibitive.
A more popular and publicized application has
been solar pool heating. Stanford has applied for a
Department of Energy (DOE) matching grant to

partially heat deGuerre pool. "Solar hot water
heating for swimming pools is the most cost effec
tive application at this point," explained
Weisberg; "you use a little bit all day long."
Solar energy's scientific component has not
been overshadowed by the practical nature of its
installation on the campus. Research conducted
by professors in the Electrical Engineering and
Materials Research departments here is attempt
ing to decrease the cost and increase the efficien
cy of photovoltaic solar cells.
These type of photovoltaic cells, usually
created by silicon crystals, are used as semi
conductors to convert the sun's energy into viable
electricity outputs.
Prof. Robert Feigelson, director of the Crystal
Technology program through the Center for Mate
rials Research, and Senior Research Associate
Dennis Elwell have been experimenting with a
single-step electrolyte process to fabricate silicon
from molten salt solution. This process could
potentially decrease the cost of silicon kilograms
from $70 to $80 per kilogram to $1 to $3, a re
markable breakthrough in the search for ways to
make solar cells more cost effective.
