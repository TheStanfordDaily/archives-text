# Physicist says politics and science mix

Contemporary scientists and engi
neers, especially those who are engaged
in the development of new weapons, have
something in common with the Greek
mathematician Archimedes. They face
the same dilemma he did, according to
Wolfgang Panofsky, director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator and a strong ad
vocate of arms control.
"Don't disturb my circles" were the
last words of Archimedes before he was
run through by a Roman soldier during
the Roman invasion of Syracuse in 212
B.C.
Archimedes was busily drawing
circular figures in the sand searching for
a mathematical proof as Syracuse was
being overrun. Archimedes had quit his
earlier job as "a weapons technician" at
the disposal of the government, a role
similar to today's nuclear weapons phys
icist, so he could devote himself to pure
science.
"I am sure he felt did not see his role in
defending Syracuse against the Romans
as immoral or illogical in any way,"
Panofsky said during a Daily interview,
"but he did at the same time want to con
tribute to humanity as a whole and be
above it all. "
For scientists and engineers, especial
ly ones engaged in developing weapons
systems, the decision to actively partici
pate in politics presents an uneasy dilem
ma.
If scientists decide to get involved they
open themselves up to criticism from
their colleagues and outside critics for
abusing their stature; if they remain si
lent on the dangers ot applications of
their research, they are accused of being
irresponsible or callous. "They get the
devil either way," Panofsky said.
But Panofsky is very much in favor of
a more active role for scientists He has
been saying for years that communica
tion between the scientific community
and political figures needs to improve.
So far, the record is poor, says Pan
ofsky. Part of the problem is that politi

cians are "scientifically illiterate." For
example, they see nuclear weapons as
political instruments rather then the in
struments of tremendous destructive
power that they are. This kind of misun
derstanding was in part responsible for
the decision to drop bombs on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, according to Panofsky.
After the first nuclear weapon was
detonated in 1945 at Alamogordo, many
thought that this weapon would make
further wars impossible and that stock
piling of the weapons would not occur.
But until now, Panofsky said in a paper
presented at a January Colloquium on
Science and Disarmament, "No govern
ment has answered the question. When is
enough enough? applied to nuclear weap
ons." Today there are 50,000 nuclear
weapons and they have not made any
body any mors secure.
It is too mucji to expect the nuclear
physicist to quit, according to Panofsky.
"People build weapons because they
have persuaded themselves'that in this
world, short ot negotiated arms control
and disarmament, each country has to
protect itselt," he told the Daily.
"I don't think that you will or should
find that people working on nuclear
weapons think they are doing something
immoral," Panofsky said. Rather,he in
dicated, scientists have consider
carefully the implications of,what they
do.
Perhaps everybody would agree that
increasing our understanding of nature is
to our own good. But once the new knowl
edge exists, it is difficult to apply re
straints against its abuse.
Rather then asking the military to stop
nuclear build-up, Panofsky believes that
scientists should become more involved
in policy making.
The Reagan administration has so tar
not been good at seeking advice on sci
ence and technology issues, he said Rea
gan has not yet appointed a science ad
visor, a post which Panosky says is vital
for getting an objective assesment of pol

icy alternatives on such complex issues
as the neutron bomb or the MX missile,
projects that are as complex as they are
expensive. Each has a great deal of in
stitutional support.
"The president and his staff should
have access to experts who work for him
so that he can be told by people who work
tor him what is what,"Panofsky con
tinued.
In the area of weapons development,
the problem of making intelligent de
cisions is especially acute. The problem
is often that "the political prestige" of a
perceived breakthrough in technology is
"simply too valuable a commodity for
decison makers .to forego, even if the
true military significance is minor or
non-existent."
Panofsky's example is the highly con
troversial neutron bomb, which has been
advocated as a weapon which minimizes
the blast from the explosion. The neutron
bomb is also said to be a powerful weap
on against the crew of enemy tanks while
minimizing damage to friendly popu
lations and buildings.
"Yet. . . the physical differences be
tween the neutron bomb and other nucle
ar weapons are minimal," Panofsky
said, adding that the bomb is unlikely to
be of any military use.
Another problem facing decision
makers is what Panofsky calls "the tech
nology imperative." New technology
"tends to generate its own momentum",
preventing both unilateral and nego
tiated attempt to control it. But technolo
gy is not the main barrier to halting the
arms race, says Panofsky. Politics is. It
is here that scientists can be a lot more
active.
The political clout of ''scientists in
Washington appears to have decreased,
but, Panofsky speculated, the decrease
is not intentional.
"I'd rather think that there has been a
difficulty in finding qualified scientists
who me<?t the rather stringent political
criteria."
