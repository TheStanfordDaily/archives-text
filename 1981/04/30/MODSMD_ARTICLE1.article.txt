### Peter Finch 
Concern about congressional ac
tions which may jeopardize the legal
ity ot abortions was expressed last
night at a Pro-Choice Forum, at
tended by about 200 people in Kresge
Auditorium.
Organized by the Stanford Pro-
Choice Alliance and the Women ot
Stanford Law <WSL), the forum con
sisted of speeches by Dorothy Erhlich,
executive director of the San Francis
co American Civil Liberties Union,
Professor Tom Grey ot the Stanford
Law School, and Sylvia W'einstein, co
chairwoman of the National Organiza
tion of Women's abortion rights group.
A brief question and answer period fol
lowed the speeches.
, According to Bebo Andrews of WSL,
the forum didn't claim to be anything
other than a pro-abortion event.
"We are very concerned about cur
rent events going in Congress and
throughout the country that might un
dercut a woman's right to obtain a

safe and a legal abortion," she noted
in her introductory remarks. Â»
Ehrlich, who held the first spot on
the evening's agenda, briefly dis
cussed abortion legislation currently
being debated in Congress. By defin
ing the beginning ot life as the moment
of conception, as the anti-abortion
groups would like Congress to do,
abQrtion could very easily become de
fined as manslaughter, and once again
become a criminal offense.
In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled
that abortions during the first
trimester of pregnancy were legal.
"It's important to immediately rec
ognize that we are not talking about a
question of whether or not an individ
ual woman should choose or not
choose to terminate her pregnancy,"
she said. "Because regardless ot how
the abortion question is resolved,
women of all walks of life will con
tinue to need to obtain abortions. The
question is simply whether that action
will again become an illegal act;
whether we'll all return to an era of il
legal, unsate back-alley abortions."
Ehrlich told ot the strategies of the
Moral Majority-type anti-abortion
groups, as well.
She claimed that they also "intend
to support other, more conservative
issues. They want to bring prayer back
in the schools, they want to get rid of
homosexuals in the schools and
elsewhere, they want to teach the
biblical account of creation. Those
forces, and you can call them anti
choice, you can call them Moral Ma
jority, you can call them anything you
want to call them, but you have to re
alize that they are already on
march. They want to capture the
power of the government and use it to
establish a nightmare of religous and
political orthodoxy.
"In the '80s," she continued, "it will
be up to all of us to assure that these
rights are preserved, and there is
something that we can all do about
that."
Grey spoke next, touching mainly
on the constitutionality of the most re
cent attempts at new abortion legisla
tion.
"This new proposal (the Human
Life Bill) presents danger in two
ways," he said. "First, it purports to
declare that the fetus is a person at the
moment of conception, and thereby is
afforded due process of law.

"Second." he continued,"this legis
lation would create a constitutional
right to life, and it fully carried
through would force the states to
treat any abortion as homicide.
"Now, there are arguments either
way, but I do not believe that the court
will let Congress do this," he said.
Weinstein, who has two children
and said she had undergone two illegal
abortions, spoke last, exciting the
crowd with her determined pleas for
action.
"If we in this country," she started
out, "were to depend on the courts tor
our freedom, there'd be young men
going on the plane tomorrow for Viet
nam, because the war would still not
be over. Most ot the justices we've
won, we've won because we've fought
like hell for them."
She went on to blast the Reagan ad
ministration and her other opponents,
which brought considerable applause
and laughter from the audience.
"Look who we've got for a presi
dent," she said. "We've got a 'flat
earth er'! I'm telling you, he thinks the
world is flat. And I don't know why
they call themselves creationists'
when they haven't had a creative idea
in 4000 years. "
Weinstein also described her op
position as a coalition of the church,
the state and corporate powers and re
tered to anti-abortion groups as the
"immoral minority."
"They're absolutely the minority,"

she said "The only difference is they
have television and they have the pres
ident."
Furthermore, she said, most people
don't realize that most churches, with
the exception of the Mormon and Cath
olic Churches, are in favor of the
"freedom to choose an abortion."
"And even still. " she said. " the
vast majority ot Catholics are in tavor
of it."
Finally, Weinstein called tor nation
wide pro-choice demonstrations to
shake up the anti-abortion groups.
"That's what we have to go out and
do!" she said "We have to make it
very uncomfortable for some 'pro
deather' to come out and tell me my
daughter can't get a legal abor
tion. . . and we've got the power to do
it."
