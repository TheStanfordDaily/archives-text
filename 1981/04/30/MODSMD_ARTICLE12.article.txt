# Station to station... the par course challenge
## 
### Karen Springen 
Not all courses here are
classes — ask runners of the
Perrier fitness course around
Roble and Lake Lagunita.
The balanced, self-guiding
Parcourse system was dedi
cated officially last Oct. 31,
making Stanford one of 200 com
munities with the trail.
The University paid $2000 tor
the initial construction. Lack of
tunding stalled production in
1978 until Bruce Nevins, presi
dent of Perrier and an alumni of
the Graduate School of Busi
ness, footed the rest of the bill.
The entire set-up cost $6400.
Course description
Similar to (but more scenic
than) the Olympic Gamefield at
Angell Field, the Parcourse is
heartily recommended for those
interested in cardiovascular fit
ness. Exercises include warm
ups and stretching, strengthen
ing, and toning.
Each of the 18 "holes" (ex
cercise stations) works the
heart and blood vessel network
and a different muscle group of
the skeleton system. The first
stations (in front of Roble) con
centrate on stretching. Subse
quent "holes" work on the lower
and upper body.
Resist the impulse to skip
measuring your heart rate at
the start ot the trail, since the

check provides a good measure
of cardiovascular conditioning
You should rate well if you aim
for FIT, the Parcourse acronym
for frequency, intensity and
time of your training exercise.
The trail is challenging to
both novices and Parcourse ad
dicts. Each "hole" offers start
ing, sporting and championship
par suggestions. Starting par
tor chin-ups, tor example, is
only one.

Timing the run offers another
gauge of improvement. The
course runs about IV2 miles and
takes about 25 minutes to com
plete — if all goes well and ac
cording to schedule. Un
fortunately for some first-tim
ers, this time estimate as
sumes both a certain minimal
level of fitness and a sense of
direction.
Despite warnings by veteran

Parcourse runners and the in
structional signs which give ar
rows pointing the direction, we
managed to get lost If you are a
novice, be wary of the jumping
jacks station. Otherwise, you
may join us in needing to run an
additional mile between the
fifth and sixth stations.
We exercised the option to
walk part of the trail. Neither of
us had had CPR training so we
decided not to take any unneces-

sary risks. Overdoers should
be forewarned that Cowell
Health Center is some distance
away.
Runners should bring a friend
to help maintain a consistent
pace. Unsurprisingly, tellow
runners were few and far be
tween during our 7 a.m. run.
Peak times — when trail traf
fic is heavy — are Sunday morn
ings and right before dinner. Al
legedly, running the course en
hances the taste ot meals.
We tound the stations to be a
relief since they are relatively

stationary. The sit-up hole even
provides a wooden seat. Need
less to say, this was a favorite
station.
The high bar is just that: high
But, as in most of the other sta
tions, there are three height or
difficulty options So, barring
any major arm disorders, you
should be able to chin-up and
take it. Just strengthen your re
solve along with your muscles.
There will be time to beam
later if you finish the last station
without losing your balance on
the slender board

We also appreciated the close
placement of the first stations
which helped us "warm up" to
the course both physically and
psychologically. (Our "tone"
improved in the same manner!)
Graduate student Bert
Patenaude, who describes
himself as a trail addict, heard
of the course through friends.
He now runs it daily.
The course is not a pushover,
he emphasized "You realize
how few muscles in your body
you use." Patenaude called the
course "a total exercise."
"Total exercise" can be em
barrassing, however. Some of
the exercises, such as kicking
the legs from side repeatedly,
are performed along Campus
Drive. One student even re
ported seeing a Peeping Tom
lurking near the toe-touch sta
tion.
Overall, the exercise pro

gram is fit for an amateur new
to the athletic field or tor a pro.
So, of course you should dash
over to Roble and begin a firm
campaign to combat flab With
a flexible schedule — and body
— you can enjoy the
Parcouse. . . or so rumor has it!
If you are like me and have to
jog your memory to recall the
last time you ran, decide to
sweat it out. I stretched my im
agination — and body — and am
still alive.
Afterwards, you can shower
yourself with water and praise.
And if all this fails to entice you,
remember that the course ends
near The Store. The course
sponsor might say to buy their
water — but you deserve more.
