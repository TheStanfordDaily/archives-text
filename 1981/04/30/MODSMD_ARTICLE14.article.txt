# Humanities lecture series continues
## Profs address today's problems of literary criticism 
### Kimberly Brown 
The recently created Stan
ford Humanities Center spon
sored its third lecture Tuesday
night, featuring French Pro
fessor Rene Girard and E D.
Hirsch, Professor of English at
the University of Virginia. The
two spoke on current problems
in the field of literary criticism.
An audience of about 150
gathered in Bishop Auditorium
for the interpretations on how
literature should be approached
and taught in the 1980s.
Prot. Hirsch attributed the
conflicts over literary criticism
currently dividing the country's
universities ,to a greater liter
ary debate that originated in
Europe. The 'great debate',
which began at Cambridge Uni
versity, involved a discrepancy
between two poles ot thinkers:
basically, the 'ancients' and the
moderns'.
Hirsch paralleled the conflict
between ancients and moderns
with that between professors
and undergraduates in today's
universities. The ancients are
scholars who "want to teach old
authors in historical ways,"
whereas the moderns "want to
teach old authors in new ways,"
Hirsch said".
From the ancients' view
point. the teadher's primary

task is to help students discover
the historical meaning of a liter
ary text, or to "look at the liter
ature of the past and discover its
past meaning," said Hirsch.
The moderns, on the other hand,
have launched a two-pronged
attack on their more conserva
tive counterparts.
Hirsch said he views the
moderns' objections as both the
oretical and cultural: first, they
argue that the true aim should
be a current, or secondary' ap
proach; and second, they say it
is naive, and not perceptually
feasible for critics belonging to
the twentieth century to analyze
historically. From the modern's
point of view, Hirsch said, the

ancient's mode ot criticism is
just "pinnning old dusty but
terflys to the walls of
museums."
Hirsch sees undergraduates in
the 1980s as wanting to discover
the primary meanings in a work
of literature. They want to know
why the great works are labled
as "great" works, they want to
know what great authors be
lieved and thought, he said.
Thus, today's students are ac
tually "ancients" in their ap
proach, Hirsch said.
Hirsch sees this strug
gle within the universities as re
sulting from a greater soci
ological cause as well. He said
that professors today seem

more concerned with secondary
criticisms because "for the past
25 years, their chief literary
work has been to publish prima
ry interpretations ot works
whose primary meanings have
already been interpreted."
Thus, both professors and stu
dents are "caught in the
vortex" of an institution while
the educational factor becomes
secondary, he said
"During the 1980s we need to
strike a balance," Hirsch con
cluded. "Although it means a
return to history, it does not nec
essarily mean a return to a his
torical interpretation."
Professor Girard's lecture,

entitled "Mimesis Now", dealt
with the shifting theories ol
mimesis, itself, in Western lit
erature. ("Mimesis" in literary
terminology means imitation in
art and literature.) In a highly
textualized argument drawing
from The Bible, Girard demon
strated how certain traditional
forms of criticism have 'lost
their significance.
Ancient texts can have social,
theological, and ideological val
ue, he said. "The current re
bellion against mimesis is justi
fied in that the concept is too
narrow, yet in the final analysis,
we must not abandon but
broaden it,"he said.

Thus, today's students are ac
tually "ancients" in their ap
proach, Hirsch said.
Hirsch sees this strug
gle within the universities as re
sulting from a greater soci
ological cause as well. He said
that professors today seem

more concerned with secondary
criticisms because "for the past
25 years, their chief literary
work has been to publish prima
ry interpretations ot works
whose primary meanings have
already been interpreted."
Thus, both professors and stu
dents are "caught in the
vortex" of an institution while
the educational factor becomes
secondary, he said
"During the 1980s we need to
strike a balance," Hirsch con
cluded. "Although it means a
return to history, it does not nec
essarily mean a return to a his
torical interpretation."
Professor Girard's lecture,

entitled "Mimesis Now", dealt
with the shifting theories ol
mimesis, itself, in Western lit
erature. ("Mimesis" in literary
terminology means imitation in
art and literature.) In a highly
textualized argument drawing
from The Bible, Girard demon
strated how certain traditional
forms of criticism have 'lost
their significance.
Ancient texts can have social,
theological, and ideological val
ue, he said. "The current re
bellion against mimesis is justi
fied in that the concept is too
narrow, yet in the final analysis,
we must not abandon but
broaden it,"he said.
