"Think about money."
"Think about touching money . . about run
ning your hands through it. Think about spending
nriioney. Look at it."
No, I was not listening to a cashier at Wells
Fargo; the speaker was the instructor for an un
dergraduate special — The Stock Market — and he
was asking an auditorium packed full of healthy
capitalists to think about money.
So I did.
What about money?
It is the single most frequent answer I receive
when asking about life, ambition, future plans and
"what do you want to do?" s.
"I want to make money."
The statement echoes over Tresidder jazz
bands, in Bookstore cookie lines, in the foulest
depths ot the stacks, between three-piece suits,
and even i can you believe it? i in some of the co
ops.
It is as if the preoccupation of accruing money
has transcended the occupation that will yield
that benefit.
If people are so committed to "making mon
ey." why don't we have interviews at the CPPC
for jobs with the Bureau of Engraving' 1 You could
spend your whole life surrounded by the stuff!
Think &bout money.
Its origin was to render payment for a service.
The "root" was merely nurishment for human
production; sustenance for other types of value.
Can you imagine the ancients sitting around in
Greece and some of the sandal-footed
philosophers approaching Plato and asking.
"Hey, when you finish the Republic, what are you
going to do? What do you want from your lite?*'
And old Socrates would answer, "I want to go to
biz school and make 40,000 drachmas."
If that were the attitude in those times. I doubt
Western Civilization would have developed at all.
This is not a treatise condemning capitalist
pigs. I in no way advocate a proletarian revolu
tion. I even liked Ayn Rand I'm just asking if
most of us have ever really considered what we
really want to put into a career What we really
desire and demand ot ourselves, not merely the fi
nancial aspect we'll gain
Has our society become so hungry tor materials
that the paycheck, the bank account, the stock
portfolio — all these economic symbols of success
have they evolved as the ultimate end instead of'
gifts to make the means easier along the way?
This whole phenomenon which finds triumph in
symbol crawls into several facets of planning for
the "real world."
I ask a buddy about plans and they say "law
school." "marketing training program," "taking
a year off tor Europe."
Those are descriptions I could have read in a re
cruitment catalog. Few talk about essence.
You don't otten hear: "Iwant to practice law; I
want to learn about marketing to create my own
products successfully; I am anxious to see Europe

and live in another culture. "
Perhaps we are so conditioned to spew out 30-
second renditions ot 50-year goals that we do not
choose to elaborate on the emotional, intellectual,
moral or purely practical reasons for embarking
on our post graduate journey in our chosen pro
fession
But. too often, I get the feeling that the "rat
race" has started. The graduates line up in Frost
each June with a diploma in one hand and an ac
countant's ledger in the other. Ready, set. go
make money!
If one ever really thinks about money, the whole
notion of spending a life accumulating it seems ri
diculous It's not attractive (green?); it falls
apart in the wash; it can not leap tall buildings in a
single bound.
Money itself is vulnerable, tearable; it fades,
wilts, hey. it is cer\ finite.
The strength, the infinity, the power lies in our
accomplishments. The issue is not what we are
paid, but what we are paid for.
Our individual capabilities may be affirmed or
rewarded by our purchasing ability, but the real
tests and challenges will emerge when we use our
skills, when we create, when we turn all our poten
tial into kinetic production.
Dante. Michelangelo. Bach and Dickinson may
not have been able to afford yachts ot" charge
cards at Brooks Brothers, but their contributions
to civilization have made them humanities' mil
lionaires.
I realize that altruism will not pay the bills; but
paying the bills will not satisfy me.
I do want to make money. But it is secondary. It
is not a pursuit, a conviction, a source of fulfill
ment. It is the return, on paper, for the output I
choose to make.
Think about money.
Think about making money.
Is it enough?

I do want to make money. But it is secondary. It
is not a pursuit, a conviction, a source of fulfill
ment. It is the return, on paper, for the output I
choose to make.
Think about money.
Think about making money.
Is it enough?

"Think about money."
"Think about touching money . . about run
ning your hands through it. Think about spending
nriioney. Look at it."
No, I was not listening to a cashier at Wells
Fargo; the speaker was the instructor for an un
dergraduate special — The Stock Market — and he
was asking an auditorium packed full of healthy
capitalists to think about money.
So I did.
What about money?
It is the single most frequent answer I receive
when asking about life, ambition, future plans and
"what do you want to do?" s.
"I want to make money."
The statement echoes over Tresidder jazz
bands, in Bookstore cookie lines, in the foulest
depths ot the stacks, between three-piece suits,
and even i can you believe it? i in some of the co
ops.
It is as if the preoccupation of accruing money
has transcended the occupation that will yield
that benefit.
If people are so committed to "making mon
ey." why don't we have interviews at the CPPC
for jobs with the Bureau of Engraving' 1 You could
spend your whole life surrounded by the stuff!
Think &bout money.
Its origin was to render payment for a service.
The "root" was merely nurishment for human
production; sustenance for other types of value.
Can you imagine the ancients sitting around in
Greece and some of the sandal-footed
philosophers approaching Plato and asking.
"Hey, when you finish the Republic, what are you
going to do? What do you want from your lite?*'
And old Socrates would answer, "I want to go to
biz school and make 40,000 drachmas."
If that were the attitude in those times. I doubt
Western Civilization would have developed at all.
This is not a treatise condemning capitalist
pigs. I in no way advocate a proletarian revolu
tion. I even liked Ayn Rand I'm just asking if
most of us have ever really considered what we
really want to put into a career What we really
desire and demand ot ourselves, not merely the fi
nancial aspect we'll gain
Has our society become so hungry tor materials
that the paycheck, the bank account, the stock
portfolio — all these economic symbols of success
have they evolved as the ultimate end instead of'
gifts to make the means easier along the way?
This whole phenomenon which finds triumph in
symbol crawls into several facets of planning for
the "real world."
I ask a buddy about plans and they say "law
school." "marketing training program," "taking
a year off tor Europe."
Those are descriptions I could have read in a re
cruitment catalog. Few talk about essence.
You don't otten hear: "Iwant to practice law; I
want to learn about marketing to create my own
products successfully; I am anxious to see Europe

and live in another culture. "
Perhaps we are so conditioned to spew out 30-
second renditions ot 50-year goals that we do not
choose to elaborate on the emotional, intellectual,
moral or purely practical reasons for embarking
on our post graduate journey in our chosen pro
fession
But. too often, I get the feeling that the "rat
race" has started. The graduates line up in Frost
each June with a diploma in one hand and an ac
countant's ledger in the other. Ready, set. go
make money!
If one ever really thinks about money, the whole
notion of spending a life accumulating it seems ri
diculous It's not attractive (green?); it falls
apart in the wash; it can not leap tall buildings in a
single bound.
Money itself is vulnerable, tearable; it fades,
wilts, hey. it is cer\ finite.
The strength, the infinity, the power lies in our
accomplishments. The issue is not what we are
paid, but what we are paid for.
Our individual capabilities may be affirmed or
rewarded by our purchasing ability, but the real
tests and challenges will emerge when we use our
skills, when we create, when we turn all our poten
tial into kinetic production.
Dante. Michelangelo. Bach and Dickinson may
not have been able to afford yachts ot" charge
cards at Brooks Brothers, but their contributions
to civilization have made them humanities' mil
lionaires.
I realize that altruism will not pay the bills; but
paying the bills will not satisfy me.
